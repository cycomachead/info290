"O: Technically well made. A touch too sweet but no bad aftertastes. An interesting drink."
"I was expecting a lot more from this beer. It wasn't bad but lacked some boldness and bitterness that i enjoy in a higher abv beer. All in all not bad for the style."
""
"Intense but great ancient ale"
"Very good beer, sweet aroma and taste. Very smooth"
""
""
"Pours honey colored with a thin, white head.  Sweet malt and honey smells.  Tastes are very interesting, malt, honey, mild grape in the background.  Mild carbonation with a very nice finish.  A combination of a malt forward beer, but with a mead blend.  Overall a very interesting beer."
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow with a quick dissipating head. Smells of light spices and maltiness. The taste is complex. Starts with Muscat grapes that lingers into honey followed by a malty finish. This beer is refreshingly different almost like a blend of mead, moscato wine, and beer. Very unique and easy to drink.You won't even know that it's 9% ABV. I'd drink it more often if it wasn't $12 for 4 bottles."

"Pours yellow, amber with a tint from the saffron making it bolder.  Nose is grape skin, mild earth, slight hops herbal.  Grass with a bit of sweetness.  Malt is sweet and the grape skin flavor is bright, light and really easy to like in this beer.  Juicy middle, herbal back notes.  Dry, bubbly.  The honey on this one is like a raw floral scent and taste is  light.  Orange and a fruit rind scent that I can't place.  Spice , Bread crusts and a mild ester from alcohol.  A bit of alcohol sweetness on the palate too but not even any warming.  Delightful!  The malt was so deep on this pale beer.  The flavors crisp and the breaddiness surprising."
"This stuff is freaking great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I only give it this score because i did drink it but glad I have an DIPA to wash this taste away quickly"
""
""
"Overall, this is a fairly complex beer that will please the white wine lover. The grapes and spices give it a rather dry wine-like flavor profile on the whole. Not a bad beer in the end."
""
""
"Just had this on tap for the first time and it's even better than the bottled version. Midas has such complex flavors that just tickle every single taste bud. It goes down smooth and leaves a pleasant aftertaste on the tongue. If you see this on draft - GET IT"
""
"I liked it very much, is that enough?"
""
""
""
"Easy drinking, not bitter. Flavors of grape and honey, but not overpoweringly sweet. Hard pressed to find a beer with a higher ABV and lower IBU."
""
"Beautiful beer, taste of raisins very crisp and dry"
""
""
"O: Interesting. Definitely worth a try. Pretend you're a Pharaoh."
""
""
"Not a bad offering!"
"Honey and grape on the nose with some hints of the advertised spices. Fermented honey flavor plus butter, allspice, and raisins."
""
""
""
"Could have been a dud bottle, this was bought in Australia, and was rather old."
""
"This has got to be the smoothest beer to have ever been poured down. I wasn't too excited about the taste though, so it was a disappointment. I would have loved more grape flavor."
""
"Overall, it's nice and different, but not something I'd go out of my way to get."
""
""
"Not a big fan of the sweetness. I love Dogfish and I was excited about the line of ""ancient"" beers. Not my thing with the honey but it was pleasing to the eye and had a nice aroma."
""
""
"O: Great flavor that surprised me.  A super mix of subtle flavors.  And I love the dryness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice -  not for every day but good taste but sometimes the funky cheap lager taste surfaces"
"O: tasty first Beer that's sweet but dissent overdue it. Great Beer/wine feel."
""
"Described as an ""ancient"" ale, it pours a cloudy yellow-orange with a head that foams up nicely, but retreats quickly.  The nose is complex with honey, bananas, muscat grapes.  The hop character is very subdued if present at all.  The flavor is very sweet but in a good way, like in a Belgian-style.  Again, there is good flavor of honey.  It is full bodied with a nice alcohol heat that is equal to the carbonation and cream.  I had one of these in my wine cellar for about 11 months after purchase and it was just as good as the first one I ever opened."
""
""
""
"Glass- Perfect Pint"
"Good, but not great beer. Definitely not one to turn down when gven the opportunity."
""
"V - I gave the lowest rating because this stuff is over 14 dollars for a 4 pack locally."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Please enter at least five"
"t/m/o - the first thing that jumps out at me is the feel, fairly full bodied...but smooth. Finish is kind of macro grainy and a bit off putting.  The flavor is similar, very grainy and malty. The white wine grape is the only real redeeming quality of the beer, kind of like a imperial adjunct lager...with some white wine and honey hints.  Not bad but not great either, but good enough. While I find the concept of ancient ales to be an interesting science experiment, my overall feeling is that if these beer recipes didn't survive time, there might be a reason. Definitely one for the tickers and potential crossover beer for the macro fans."
""
""
"I appreciate it for what it is but wouldn't choose it over others. Strong grape taste."
""
"Yeah, that's right.. It's a perfect beer."
""
""
""
"Not what I expected.  I wanted to like this beer, but something just seemed off about it.  I may have to give it another try at a later date, just to be fair."
""
"Very sweet, floral and boozy with a sticky, syrupy  mouthfeel. More like a mead than a beer. Worth trying, but once was enough for me."
"Unique beer with lots of different flavors, Sweet from the honey but interesting hops add to a very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very out there, seems almost a split personality in mixing a melange of strong flavoured ingredients and  also creating a beer with a broad appeal. I did really enjoy the skill that went into crafting this, given that ingrediant list I doubt I could replicate something with this complexity and nuance,  for that I will forgive some of the critiques and say this was a beer I was certainly glad to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes:  This is simply an awesome classic."
""
""
""
""
""
"The label tells you it includes honey, and the honey is what makes this so smooth. If it weren't for all the other ingredients that remind you you're drinking beer and NOT honey, you'd think you were guzzling from one of those plastic bears. The sweetness is kept in check by the saffron and other fun stuff included and I would drink this beer every day for a long time if I could."

"O - An interesting flavor profile, delicious, highly unusual.  At 9%, this delivers the hammer, but the alcohol remains largely hidden.  It reminds me of ciders and, yes, wine, in its flavor profile, but the close is all about grains and beer flavors.  Not something I'd grab often, but something I might share with my wine drinking friends to illustrate the range of what a beer can be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like this beer in that like many of DFH's other products, it is unique and challenges conventional beer. As others have commented, I wouldn't drink it everyday, but would certainly buy again and have on occasion. Would be great with a meal."
""
"I am more of a stout/porter guy so I'll get straight to the point. You will like this, most everyone you offer it to will like this. It's a bit pricey which is preventing me from giving it any higher. But a great beer all around. Heard others bring comparisons to Bell's Venus, this IMO trumps it easily."
"O: Very cool brew, glad I got to try it, though not something I'd buy on a regular basis."

"12 oz Bottle poured into a 20 Firestone glass.Poured a golden color with one inch head.Smell is very sweet with a hint of grapefruit.Taste remained me of the time I drank mead.Very sweet.Once again this is one of those times where i can`t recommend this to a beer drinker because it`s more like a mead.It`s just to sweet for me.I have loved all the other Dogfish Head beers I have drank before but this one was not up to there standards.Motley out."

""

"Golden colored with excellent clarity.  A fingernail of white foam covers most of the top.  I detect the muscat grapes and the honey in the aroma.  The saffron gives it a slightly herbal edge. The flavor is initially favored by the honey and barley,but the back of the palate is initially the muscat grapes and then the saffron really heads to the forefront and it finishes with the strong herbal kick.  The mouth is moderately carbonated and the honey lends dryness."

"O: I was very intrigued by this beer, and wanted to buy it for a long time, but found myself complacent with more contemporary beer styles, and seeing as this beer is near 14 bucks for a 4 pack I found it hard to justify the purchase. However, I am glad I purchased this beer, because it really feels like a timemachine in glass. It is hard to rate this beer, because considering the template they used to make it is archaic I don't really have a viable frame of reference. I saw other reviews lamenting about how it didn't meet their expectations, and how they would rather drink an IPA, but such a comment sounds ill-founded to me.  In all honesty, this beer is simply a tribute to the history of beer, and if you can't appreciate it as that, and would rather judge it with a contemporary and biased perspective, then this beer obviously isn't for you. If you want to taste the diversity Dogfishhead has to offer, and their love for the craft and its history, then this beer is definitely for you."

"Pours an interesting pink color. No head. Carbonated more like a white wine. Interesting smell. Is much more reminiscent of a wine than beer. Little bit musty. Well, it doesn't really taste like wine. Very fruity, along with the sweetness of honey. Tastes more like a beer than wine. The mouth feel though, is again like wine. Most interesting ""beer"" I've had in a long time. Although I don’t think this is actually classified as a beer. Definitely never had anything like it before."
"Poured from bottle to glass with very little and fine head. A rich, golden color, with very good clarity. This does not look or taste like a 2700 year old recipe at all. It's a bold, beautiful beer with hint of malt and white grape aroma and sweet honey taste. Dogfish head use a wonderful yeast that I have come to associate with a series of wonderful beers over the years and the Midas is no exception. Thanks to my friend who found this beer at a beer store and picked it up for me."
""
""
"O: An excellent beer that often gets overlooked as it isn't a hop filled or deep and dark full concoction. If you appreciate beer and have an open mind, this beer will fulfill your wants. A definite purchase for the occasional glass at $12.99 a 4 pack."

"Bottle poured into glass.  There is a thin white head.  The appearance is golden, hazy yellow with visible carbonation bubbles.  Very sweet and wonderful aroma on the nose.  Honey and grab are prevalent.  Very carbonated in the mouth. Sweet, can taste the honey and the grape followed by alcohol.  Interesting and unique, quite tasty."

"O: A good beer, but nothing great. I appreciate the taste of saffron, but this beer was quite expensive for me ($5 for a 12 oz. bottle at my local bottle shop) and it was not as special as a lot of people make it out to be. Definitely worth trying, but nothing special besides its high alcohol content and its white grape based taste"

"O: This beer is strange to say the least but nevertheless its extremely cool for the one of the most respected breweries to resurrect this ancient style. I drink this and daydream I'm king midas drinking with my many wives and not worrying bout much. This beer is hardly a considered a beer by today's standards and is more closely related to a mead or alcoholic concoction of some sort. love it all the same"

"Considering the price I paid I was hoping for a beverage with ""The Midas Touch"". Instead I got something that was mediocre at best. Pours out a hazy yellow with a minimal head and very little retention. The smell actually reminded me of adjuncts, not malt or hops. The taste was even on the ""hot"" side, particularly after the beer warmed a bit and the mouth feel average at best with poor carbonation. Overall it was OK, but just marginally. I am sorry I bought a 4 pack and will be going back to 90 Minute IPA if I want something from DFH. This is not a beer that is worth 3+ bucks a bottle at retail."

"Smells of white grapes and malt with a small amount of saffron to follow. Tasting it the grape is the strongest with hints of honey and saffron. The malt does come through after a few sips. After a while I feel as I have been drinking white wine as well. The finish is crisp and has a aftertaste of grapes. I would buy again."
"Overall: I love Dog fish Head and this brew is from the ancient Ale series my first one and i am very excited to try them all. i would recommend this brew and Dog fish head brewery, and since they were just on a recent Brew Dogs episode I am sure they are going to gain a lot more popularity. well done my friends."

"I really love this one! It is complex but simple enough to get the major notes of what the beer is going for. I get strong notes of honey and spice which lead into a dry, herbal finish. Its fresh and round with a great balance! I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys drinking chardonnay!"

"O - I've got to say, I was really surprised by this beer. The spiced beer category is incredibly vast, and I have had almost nothing but bad experiences with spiced ales, but I was more than pleasantly surprised by this beer. If it has one downside, it is that it might almost be too rich for me to have more than one glass at a time. That said, it is not bad by any means, and I applaud Dogfish Head for creating something incredibly unique. Props."

"I love Dogfish Head's Ancient Ales program for many reasons. But the main one is that opening up a bottle of one of these brews is a way of trying to understand the tastes of civilizations past. This beer is, as much as it is asking you to evaluate it based on your contemporary tastes, try and imagine living in a world where while you knead your bread and prevent the swirling dust from getting into your eyes and the dough in your hands. It asks us to reevaluate our position and our expectations of a ""beer"" and of what we can enjoy and by what criteria. This beer may fall a bit flat to ordinary standard, but it's not an ordinary beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good and interesting brew. Good fruit esters with a nice sweetness that is big but far from cloying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I wanted to love this beer. After reading ""Sacred and Herbal Healing Beers"" I was very happy to remember this beer by Dogfish head and get a chance to experience an old recipe. Honestly it underwhelmed me. I'm glad a tried it, though. Not something I would buy again considering the price, but I admire Dogfish Head for putting this out."
""
""
""
""
"Lemon, honey color and transparent. Weak head with minimal lacing. Lots of white grapes in the aroma. Sweet and spicy at the same time. Dense malt flavor up front followed by white grapes. Hint of honey ads to the sweetness. Weak hop character, just a mild leaf quality. Medium to full bodied with a sugary texture. Decent carbonation. Overall,a little sweet for my taste but ok for something different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Following a toast to those who inspired this recipe I sipped the beer and found myself pleasantly surprised to taste a beer with an actual mouthfeel. While beer aficionados frequently laud those brews with a long mouth feel I tend to believe the abundance of carbonation precludes a mouthfeel on par with what a complex wine can offer. In contrast, this honey heavy concoction has a buttery quality that coats the mouth and makes it a great selection to pair with food."
"O. Glad I bought a 4-pack but this isn't something I will be rushing out to re-purchase. Interesting tasting brew with a unique aroma and mouthfeel profile."
""
" 3.5 overall. I like how this toes the line with quite a bit of wine elements, it is very unique. I've certainly never drank a brew that reminded me of wine for all the right reasons. I would recommend this brew to fellow craft enthusiasts that also want to try out an B.C. -era style& also to have it be consumed on a golden autumn evening. I will buy this brew again when I'm feeling like a truly unique experience."

"Overall- I was blown away by this. This is one of the most complex brews I have had. So incredibly complex. Extremely light, easy drinking, hard to imagine this is 9% abv. This beer should be in a style all to its own. Leave it to Dogfish Head to go totally out of the conventional box. This will now be among my top list of favorite beers."
""
"I'll admit, I only bought this because it was billed as a ""Handcrafted Ancient Ale"" and I wanted to try something new that wasn't an IPA, stout, or porter. I liked the aroma and the taste, although I had trouble identifying exactly what it was I was smelling and tasting. The only thing I could reliably identify was honey. I even went and smelled different spices from my spice cabinet to try to narrow it down. The bottle said saffron and white muscat grapes, neither of which I am familiar enough with to make any sort of comment on. At any rate it was enjoyable enough and I was happy to expand my palate with it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks like golden honey. Smell is of grapes and honey - subtle but sweet notes almost like a flower that I cannot directly name. Taste is honey and grapes as well. Almost similar to champagne/cider combination. Quite delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into my trusty pint glass. pale to copperish color. small to medium head. Taste of honey and muscat grapes. an addicting flavor over taste is amazing and mouthful is that of wine so i gave 4.75 instead of a 5. Another great beer from Dogfishhead"
""
""
"Peter out"
""

"O- Although I would certainly seek out a fresh bottle for a more accurate sensory experience (and am fortunate to learn this is a year-round offering), I am nothing but blown away by what I have sampled at just over a year old. As much as I have endorsed Theobroma and Sah'Tea in previous reviews, this now stands to be my second favorite (to Theobroma and just edging out Sah'Tea) in DFH's Ancient Ale series. As a matter of fact, this just might find its way into my top 20 (if not 10) beers of all-time. 4.5"

"2008 bottle. Amber color, mild head, fruity aroma. A balance of fruit, spice, and sweetness, with mild carbonation and medium body. Overall, a really nice, distinctive, balanced beer--nothing I would want a lot of or often, but a very nice experience."

"This unusual brew is a welcome alternative in the high ABV class. Pour it like a traditional Belgian, but don't expect the overt yeastiness. What awaits is more similar to a double lager: refreshing and gulpable with instant satiety. Notes of grape and honey permeate and bitterness lingers. The aroma is hard to place. Is it a similar smell or something altogether different? Ponder saffron as you drink with king Midas in the afterlife: this beer lives on and so must he."

"O - not unbalanced but the finish could be more agreeable. I've enjoyed some of the other ancient ales Dogfish has done - this one doesn't excite me very much however."

"Overall - Good beer time and time again. A little different with high abv yet is incredibly refreshing that you almost forget."
"O: I loved this beer the first time I had it. It was one of my favorites, but the last time I had it was more than a couple years ago. My notes are extremely minimal, and this was tried (I'm assuming) less than a hundred beers into my journey, when most of the beers I had tried were lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Different and enjoyable. I'm sure if I would buy this again but it was kind of cool knowing that I'm drinking a beer brewed from an ancient recipe."
""
""
"Overall: Very interesting beer, unlike any beer I've had before. Seems like a hybrid of mead, beer and champagne. Even though the taste could be a little more complex ideally, and the booziness and mouthfeel aren't quite up to the standards of the rest of the beer, it's fantastic. Smells AMAZING, and tastes quite excellent as well. Not to mention the *idea* of this beer is really awesome. Will be picking up again, highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"At the end of the day, the idea of this beer (the recipe is partly a reverse-engineered ancient Mesopotamian recipe) is better than the beer itself, and for it's relatively high price there are equal or even better beers to be had. Still, it is worth a try. Or two. Or three."

"Serving type: bottle"

"Pours a crystal bright hay with a light head that fades quickly with decent lacing. Anyone who rates any of these ancient ales low on smell isn't paying attention. Grape forward, very floral and fruit similar to some of the whites from california. The nose gives way to barley and honey blended together in a complex aromatic together. The saffron isn't as visible on the nose for me. Immediately when tasting the honey and barley come together. On my palate, this is honey nut cheerios and it is awesome. The saffron is blended in well, and hardly noticeable as a direct spice. The grapes themselves make the backbone of the taste and lead it into a long finish. The mouthfeel is light with small bubbles and decent carbonation. Overall a very good beer."

"I saw this at my local store and thought it looked good. The description made it sound like the nectar of the gods but it was a hige let down. It looked decent when poured and smelled ok. Lots of grapes and sweetness. But the taste is what killed it. It tasted like grape flavored bud light. The mouthfeel was almost like water. I was severely disappointed."

"Pours well, it is an almost perfect honey color. Not much head, not highly carbonated, which is nice - this helps with the mouthfeel. The aroma is sweet and has strong notes of the saffron used to spice it. It tastes sweet at first but fades to a spiciness that finishes smoothly. Good overall flavor - sweet and spicy. Very malty."

"Aroma: orange zest, herbs, cinnamon, nutmeg and plum wine. Appearance: see through copper with a thin foam top. Taste: grape juice overtones with fairly complex notes of slick molasses, plums, figs, sweet orange peel, saffron, herbs, resinous hop oils and graham cracker malt base. Overall, this is a very interesting beer with a huge grape fruit juiciness to it. I can also taste the honey and it works well with the graham cracker tasting malts. Very unique beer. A rating."

"Very nice again from Dogfish Head but nowhere near as good as their 90 Minute IPA which goes to show just how good that particular offering was. I enjoyed this one more and more as I worked my way down the glass, possibly due to the alcohol content but it was certainly a good beer."

"Interesting brew, with more malt than I recall. Not as complex as it could've been, especially for the price. There's a diacetyl note that surfaces in the aftertaste and detracts, as well."

""
""
"Overall: I'm disappointed by this Dogfish, and I won't likely buy it again. It tastes pleasant for its ABV, but that's also not a saving grace for a beer. The fruitiness does not do enough for the bitterness and strong taste of alcohol."
"Bought a 4-pack at Table and Vine. Beer poured nicely and has a very clear, yellow appearance. Definitely lives up to the ""gold"" theme. Very thin head at first until nothing much was left and thin lacing. Fruity aromas of grapes and honey, along with a spice I cannot put my finger on. Definitely an attractive smell. Taste was decent; the beer was sweet with grapes and a citrus flavoring with a touch of that honey that you can smell. Nothing that made me go ""wow", but it is enjoyable nonetheless. Very refreshing beer; light and crisp, but the drink warrants slow drinking thanks to its almost wine-like flavoring. Overall, an interesting drink indeed."

"Bottle at Ashley's in Ann Arbor. Excellent fruit beer by DFH. Pours a light golden with a quickly receding white head. Aroma of pears, honey, and a bit of light spice. Sweet and tart, with pears dominating, a bit of honey. Not too sweet, and has a nice dry finish. Medium high carbonation. Worth a try!"

"I was really interested to try this beer after reading that Dogfish Head made this recipe from findings in a burial tomb in Sumeria. I thought of what the ancient people thought of such a ""mind altering"" beverage. Beer is one of the worlds oldest forms of payment and this still holds true today. I mean hell, I have helped friends move and do other things for a case of beer. Haven't you? Although I don't think I would worked all day in the desert heat building a pyramid for a ration of beer. Either way, great job Dogfish Head, thanks for taking me back to ancient times."

"Sweet yet dry but very tasty, good with spicy foods. Almost tastes like a mead meets a moscato meets a beer. I don't see how they compare this beer to chardonnay as it is more like moscato and honey. I definitely enjoyed this beer and would get it again based on the food I am having. It is a bit pricey."

However, the butter smell and flavor, whether intended or not, is a bit much, and the alcohol, while well hidden during the first 80% of the test, overpowers everything in the finish. A good beer to try to say you had it, but not something that would work as an everyday beer."

"Dogfish Head beers are hit or miss with me. This one has been in my cellar for a while and I was ready to hate it. What a pleasant surprise this beer was. I thought it was one of the better DFH beers I have had. Complex and hearty, yet also quite refreshing and easy to drink. I don't know what I'd compare this beer to. It has the malty character of a Biere de Garde and the herbal qualities of a Saison. Very well done DFH!"

"Overall: This is my kind of a summer beer! Extremely tasty, extremely smooth and sippable, and very refreshing. And even at 9% ABV, it’s easy to kick back, and have a few of these and enjoy a lazy summer weekend afternoon. Just be careful when you stand up. You’ll soon realize where that 9% ABV went. This is the third of the Ancient Ale Series that I’ve tried and it’s the third that I’ve really liked by Dogfish Head."

If you like odd and strange beers, this one's for you. Not my favorite DFH, but a very good beer and I love how they're not afraid to try something new. GOes really well with grilled steak, if you like red wine and beer, you will probably find something in this that you will like. Hats off to Sam Caligione."

"A very interesting beer, the nose had me both intrigued and a bit apprehensive. The taste reminded me a bit of an English barleywine."
""
""
""
"O: an interesting 'beer' that I would try again, but out of curiosity rather than a strong desire to have this again."
"O - decent but I would not buy again"
"Midas Touch is a beer that I'll always misunderstand. But, the truth of it is that it's a decent beer that I just can't seem to really like all that much. But, I now know (after revisiting) that it's much more enjoyable since the last time I had one... about three years ago."
"Poured into teku glass. Clear light orange/yellow with a fizzy single-finger white head that dissipated quickly. As it poured, it smelled like a white wine/champagne. In the glass however it smells different; yeasty, but with a hint of grape and sweetness. Taste-wise, it has a similar profile to the others in the ancient ale series, especially the Sah'tea. Smooth and yeasty, sweetness predominates. Spice notes come in towards the end, along with a little warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium but slick, a bit fizzy. I was expecting something more wine-like, such as the Noble Rot, but this was still an interesting beer. Not sure if I'd pick it up again, but always worth a try."
""
"I guess the one thing that throws me is this malt liquor-ish taste going on. I think it is due to the melding of malt and the grapes and booze mainly. I like the history involved with the beer, the thought behind it. But it's not something I will be dying to have or go back and get anytime soon. I more or less bought this for the take on history. It's a conversation beer maybe for mixed crowds of people who do and don't know a lot about beer. Worth the try. Just not for my palate I guess."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Why the disparity between the smell/taste and overall scores? This is a simple example of a brew greater than the sum of its parts. My initial opinion of the aroma and flavor profile isn't particularly positive - and yet, the whole thing kind of works after several sips. I'm not sure if it's because the dry finish gives it great drinkability for 9% or what not, but it ends up being pretty decent. I can see wine drinkers enjoying this a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This isn't a bad brew by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't imagine actively seeking it out beyond just a single bottle in the future, just for something a little different. The sweetness I find a bit overwhelming - I've never had much of a sweet tooth - but I could see a lot of people really getting down with this brew."

"Midas Touch is a beer I've been interested in trying, so I'm glad to have had it, but it's just too much for me.. I find that it almost drinks like a high ABV wine cooler. Drinkable, yes, worth the price, hell no. Of course, that's just one guy's opinion. If you're a wine drinker, you'd enjoy this one quite a bit. If you're in the mood for a BEER, then order something else."

"O: A very different beer for me but very good, would definitely drink again."
"The beer pours a fiery orange-yellow that sits in the glass close to copper in color with a huge army of bubbles racing through the beer constantly to replenish the head. The head sits nicely atop the beer as a creamy off-white color, with the bubbles holding to a size just below medium. The beer’s body is murky and full of chunky particles floating in the glass. It looks like swamp water with algae in it. On the nose, the beer smells raisiny sweet, with some definite candied grape/raisin notes and strong currents of sweet candied wine. I presume the saffron is one of the fruity candied smells I am detecting but I can’t be sure as I have never taken the time to pick out the smell of saffron before… Honey is also very prevalent in the nose, giving it a gooey sweet feel in the nostrils. On the tongue, the beer tastes very sweet with some light acidity and a touch of bitter on the sides of the tongue. The flavor begins as sweet caramelly barley, slowly working its way towards a sweet muscato wine with lovely nuances of mead and very slight bread from the barley. The finish is a medium in length, tingling with sweet wine flavors and a touch of sweet honey. As I drink more of the beer, and it warms in my hands, I also begin to detect a strong earthy sweet bitter spice on the middle of the palate that has some lasting power. The aftertaste rings with the cloying aftereffects of the wine and honey flavors. On the mouth, the beer feels medium thick in body, but the carbonation is quite strong and prickly, actually working to scrub some of the cloying nature of the beer off the tongue before it becomes unpleasant. The mouth is left neutral with a slight sticky sweet astringency to the tongue. Overall, this is an interesting beer. I totally dig everything that the ancient ales project represents and I think it is awesome to try ancient styles of beer/wine/mead-hybrids, but overall this drink is a little too sweet for me. I’m also noticing a little bit of heat from the alcohol in the back of my throat, especially after the beer has passed through. This is an interesting beer that is worthy of a try, but certainly not one you could chug, and not really a return worthy beer for me."

"Post-script: Pouring the remaining residue in is recommended after all. It gets slightly smoothened out, with a yeasty profile becoming slightly more predominant and reducing any thinness or excessive sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's a unique brew for sure, but one that comes across as too flat. The flavor profile is too simple for a beer with such a dead mouthfeel. Despite this, it's a decent beer, but one I'm not too keen on having again."

"At first I was a little put off by how much it tasted like honey and white wine, but after a bit it was easier to taste the balance between wine flavor and beer flavor. It's quite pleasant. I probably won't by this beer again because I don't care too much for sweet wine or beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a unique, straight forward beer. I enjoyed the flavor and consistency. I am surprised that it doesn't have a higher rating on this board.

"All in all, a very fun little connection to history (although, of course, tweaked for the modern palate). My best advice for you in tasting this beer is this: Just don't take it too seriously. This is a light, somewhat spicy, and fun connection with a bygone (VERY bygone) era. Enjoy it as such."

"O: the 9% ABV kicks your taste buds hard and the bitter taste does the rest. It is not a bad beer if this is what you are looking for, but I've tasted better. Drink it only slightly below room temperature to enhance the flavor and spices."
""
"Poured this spiced beer into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. This ale poured a hazy golden orange color, produced a very thin white head, poor retention and left no lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of grapes and honey- Im detecting something floral which i can only imagine would be the saffron. Can't say I have ever smelled saffron to know for sure. Medium to full bodied, this ale boasts a 9% ABV, A nice base of a buttery biscuit is a segway to the flavor of honey, grapes and spicy saffron. This brew has many wine like characteristics and is also somewhat tart and warming at the finish. Overall, this is a awesome concept beer- Creative and fun- Great for a session or dinner with family and friends. Prost!"

"Had to try Midas simply because of the 2700 year implications and mystery. Dog Fish Head did a great job making this a very drinkable beer while certainly leaving you with a taste of Chardonnay in your mouth. I would recommend this beer on the sheer history of the recipe alone."

"An ale made with honey, saffron, and muscat grapes? I wasn’t sure what to expect, but Dogfish Head is all about the quality so I had to try it. Malty at first, with a nice honey and grape aftertaste. The 9% ABV is well hidden by the complex flavors. Last Christmas I treated myself to a bottle of Samuel Adams Infinium, and this blows it away at a fraction of the price. Not for everybody, but the best marriage of wine and beer I've found."

"Pours out a crystal clear light blond color, it has plenty of carbonation and is topped off with a nice semi thick white head that slowly thins out; Very good lacing. The aroma is rather light, mild grasses and herbs come through, small amounts of lemon. The flavors are pretty complex, I can taste some apple, apricot and peaches, mild orange and some spices in the after taste. Honey, grapes, and a very slight sweet-tart flavor are also in the mix. The alcohol is well hidden and only detectable as you swallow for a brief second. This is a semi dry beer and has a light-to-medium mouth feel but is very interesting and goes down pretty smooth."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some light notes of honey. Taste is different, alcohol is certainly present, a bit wine like with some grape flavors, a bit of honey as well. Unique to say the least. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"cool idea, weird final product. pours clear golden with some yeast floaters and a thin white head that dies fast. it literally smells like feet, or like babies, or something that im kind if indifferent to at best, but the honey notes are the most obvious. the flavor too is honey heavy, which im fine with, and the other ingredients come together in a strange sort of way. not totaly palatable or delicious, but clever and unique. the mix of spices and herbs in this is downright odd and its hard to tell if there is balance here or not because its all totally foreign to me. the dry finish is nice though, and its welcomed here as a respite from the weirdness. alcohol is invisible somehow. good carbonation and a medium to full body. overall a strange creation, worth a try because its dogfish head, and because its one of the archeological beers, which i feel like are our duty to try to comprehend. i certainly enjoyed the challenge of this one, but i wont buy it again."
"Scents are fruity and sweet, a little red wine and spice notes. Very clear gold with a fluffy white head that leaves a bubbly lace scattered on top and around edges. Tastes a bit tannin like, ever so slight tartness with a spicy red wine finish. Light carbonation, viscous body with dry finish. Aftertaste is very reminiscent of red wine. Very warming. Fairly enjoyable, almost taste like an under carbonated dubbel."

"O – I think it’s very cool that I am able to drink a beer made with ingredients from King Midas’ 2,700 year old tomb, but that novelty will only get you so far. This is a very unique beer, and I’m glad to have drank it, but it is not outstanding really. Unique does not equal great unfortunately. Is this good? Absolutely. Do I recommend you try it? For sure. But know that I am not recommending this because I think it will knock your socks off, so much as because I think it’s cool, and definitely good. Just not great."

"I am definitely on the love it end of the scale with this stuff. Beautiful clear, golden color with a small, tight white foamy head. Amazing cross between beer, mead, and white wine. Tons of fruit aroma - raisins, maybe apricot/ peach, nicely carbonated and light. To me the malt hits late. The grape taste shines, as does the honey. To me the malts are taking a supporting role here - the other flavors shine through much more on top of the malty backbone. It certainly is different with mead, beer, and wine characteristics all rolled into one. Great change of pace and unexpected. Keeper."

"Final Thoughts: Far from being my favorite DFH offering, Midas Touch is an interesting beer that delivers on it's promise of barley, honey, and white grape flavors. Would I drink it again? Probably not."

"Strange brew here, for sure. I'm not exactly sure how to put my finger on it. It wasn't awful, but I would probably never have it again. Alcohol was present, but still didn't feel quite like a 9% beer. Overall pretty average."

"Interesting brew....the smell has a touch of something that somewhat turns me off. I can't really put my finger on it though. Color is a hazy dark straw color. Head diminishes quickly and legs receed quickly. Taste is...unique. There's a mild sweetness that makes itself known in the middle of the sip, almost a grape like quality to it. Moves into a honey finish that subsides fast. I find that a lot of the 'unique' brews aren't good for drinking on a semi-regular basis but this I could drink a few times a year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not impressed. Too bad, I had heard a lot about this beer."
"Overall quite the interesting brew. The honey makes the beer and the saffron keeps it unique."

"deep straw color, no head.  nose and taste are a yeast, honey and dry champagne mix.  dominant honey and bread sweetness, very little bitterness.  good carbonation.  extremely odd, but drinkable."
""
""
""
"The uniqueness of Dogfish Head's Midas Touch makes it a very difficult beer to review. Because there are so few spiced beers like it, and because its ingredients are so interesting, I am compelled to recommend it to anyone who is curious to try it. Perhaps with more saffron and a different malt profile I'd enjoy it more. This is a quality beer brewed with love, finesse, and ingenuity. But it is also a beer that I won't be drinking again."

"Maybe should have used my DFH signature glass. Not a bad beer, especially for being made from millenias old recipe. But, far from being on par with many other DFH brews. I think the novelty of the beer is what made me spend a high price for the 4-pack after seeing it on various shelves for ages, and what I still use to justify it."
""
""
""
"It's good. It's different, but good. It's not my type of beer though, and it was a lot sweeter than I thought it was going to be. I was happy to try it, but I don't think I'll buy it again."

"O - An interesting beer for sure. There is a nice white wine character throughout. Very easy to drink, refreshing and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The nose is light and sweet with notes of honey and white wine up front that fade into a caramel-esque sticky sweetness. I've used the word sweet twice but it doesn't smell overpoweringly sweet, it actually smells kind of dry but there is a sticky sweetness throughout the whole smell, probably from the honey. It actually smells very similar to another Ancient Ale, Chateau Jiahu. The taste is slightly sweet with grapes, apples and pears blending nicely with a touch of booziness and fading into a sweet but dry finish. The body is very light but it has some heft to it and the alcohol heat doesn't kick in until the sip has settled in your stomach. This is one of their best Ancient Ales. I put two of my 4-pack away to age a bit and see where it goes."
""
""
""
""
""

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 4/20/2012. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of honey, grape, earth, apricot, herbal, clove, raisin, pepper, bread, floral, and light yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with decent strength; quite pleasant. Taste of grape, biscuit, honey, pepper, clove, saffron, herbal, earth, raisin, floral, and light yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of biscuit, honey, grape, herbal, earth, and light yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors; no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth to sip on. Overall this is a very nice ancient ale style. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; with nice smoothness. Very enjoyable stuff."

"O: The aroma and taste were a bit more mild than I was hoping for. The strongest thing this beer has going for it is its drinkability."

"O – This is an interesting beer that I can’t really place into a category. It has lots of unique aromas and flavors going on. But while this beer is unique, I simply don’t think it tastes very good. The idea of making an ancient ale is cool, but I won’t be getting this one again."
"O: Extremely drinkable and tasty. If you like your beers on the sweet side, then be sure to seek this one out."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the grape and spice in the taste. At first it was a bit synthetic, but it really flourished, adding to the flavor rather than detracting from it. The grain was a bit too basic at times, but the flavoring throughout matched exactly to what we’ve come to expect from the Dogfish Ancient Ales series."
""
"O- This is pretty awesome stuff. It is barely beer in my book but if your looking for something a little different this is your beer. Absolutely worth trying. I applaud Dogfish for their ability to redefine what makes it into our glasses."

"A very interesting beer, and unlike any I've had before. Heavy on the white wine and the honey, but they're both in good balance with the other ingredients. I guess that's the impressive thing - that these unusual flavors can be so prominent, but not feel overwhelming or out-of-place. Tasty stuff."
"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear orange amber with a small head with light lacing. Spicy honey, fruit aroma, similar to a tripel. Nice fruit and honey, light malt. Pleasant sweet vinous flavor in the middle; sweet honey finish. I like this quite a bit and evidently better than most reviewers. Definitely pick up periodically."
""
""

"O: Unique but not altogether pleasing. I could definitely see this being a gateway beer for wine lovers."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours pale golden with a white head. Some tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The beer smells mildly sweet. There are bready scents with the honey. I can pick up those mild white grape aromas as well. The taste is more similar to a mead than a beer. I also pick up the white grap flavors as well as some spiciness. I don't really notice the alcohol so much in the taste. The body is medium with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth and has high drinkability. This is a very good beer that is also very interesting."

"A friend poured me a 12 oz bottle into a tulip presenting a nice straw colored beverage topped with a gentle loose head that stuck longer than I thought. The smell of this reminds me of breakfast. Fresh baked raisin bread with honey. The taste starts with a tingle of wheat then gently the honey flavor comes in. The carbonation fizzles away in your mouth and as the honey flavor comes out the texture becomes quite creamy. Aftertaste is sweet. This Is an enjoyable beer that's good to chill out with or with a light snack. No huge show or presentation here but a good solid taste that I may seek out again. This seems like something a newcomer to beer would very much enjoy"

""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good beer from start to finish, but not as complex as I was expecting from everything I've heard about this beer. I was really interested to try it since it seems be very limited production and uses an ancient strain of yeast. Even though this beer has a higher ABV, you really don't notice it."

""
"Out of curiosity had to try this...golden color with big eggshell colored foamy head. smell like white grapes, sweet and boozy tastes kinda like a chardonnay no bitterness to speak of. to me it tastes like a cheap malt liqour. very little carbonation. overall im dissapointed. I didnt know what to expect, i guess this is what they were goin for when they brewed this but i wont ever buy this again and its way too expensive. I paid 3.39 plus tax for a 12oz. glad i only bought one. dog fish head has a lot of very different and unique beers so i give them credit for that. and no disrespect to cheap malt liqours, but this really tastes similar to colt 45. one of the better malt liquors."

"O- This is a strange beer, one that I don't see myself being in the mood for often, but i felt it was a ""must-try," the ancient ales being a very cool concept if you ask me. I don't regret this one at all- it's very well-done."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really interesting mix of flavors, but the beer as a whole is nicely balanced. The sweet flavors are a bit bold, but there are a lot of other flavors to balance."
"Dogfish Head Midas Touch pours a dark, hazy orange, with just faint lightening at edges of the glass. There's maybe two fingers of off white foam, and neither head retention nor lacing are particularly impressive. The nose is nice, giving all the special ingredients a chance to shine. Juicy muscat grapes are the centerpiece, sweetened up a bit by the unmistakable aroma of honey. Saffron is present as well, albeit not quite as immediately noticeable as the other two. Grapes jump out again on the flavor palate. It's not nearly as acidic as some beers I've had that were brewed with them. Honey flavor comes through, as well as a bit of apples, to give the illusion of sweetness. The saffron that comes in on the back end is a bit too loud and brassy though, and ruins the delicate balance found at first. The body is nicely dried, not as much as a well made Belgian beer (Belgian Strong Pale seems to be a good close comparison for this beer), but enough to serve the beer well. The carbonation falls a little bit flat though. Midas Touch is the rare ""just OK"" beer for me from Dogfish Head, I usually tend to either love or hate their brews."
""
""
""
""

""

"O: Alright, I was looking for a light beer and this fits the bill but with a much higher abv than most beers that taste/feel this light. Glad to have tried it, but again, another DFH beer that I would not go back to"

"O: Good beer. Makes me think of a vineyard making a working mans beer with the leftover ingredients sitting around. Would highly recommend."

"*This may be the only fruit/spice beer that I've found bearable. I'm still not the biggest fan of this one either, but I'm starting to think I may never like this style. However, I'll rate it according to others I've had in its category. The back-end of this beer's taste is it's highlight, as you get a lot of different flavors. I just never felt like this beer knew where it was going. Also, I would drink this really cold as I enjoyed it less as it heated up (unlike usual)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall; Good for the pilsner or Belgian pale ale drinker. One was all i need at 9% ABV Couldn't tell thou."
"Pours a dark, golden colour – viscous and looks like honey. Bottle dated Dec. 2011 has little carbonation. Aroma is surprisingly malt forward, given the impressive list of other ingredients. My palate's not developed enough to find the saffron, but the honey and grapes are definitely present in both aroma and taste. The flavour backbone is of sweet malts and champagne with a surprisingly dry finish, nicely bitter."
""
"O - This is a very interesting beer. It comes across almost like a wine to me, which makes me want to drink only about half a bottle in a single setting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I wasn't a very big fan but I appeciate the uniqueness here and how everything seems to come together despite the lack of enjoyable flavors."

"O- A very good and unique beer. Interesting flavors and very drinkable especially for 9%. A nice change of pace from traditional styles."
""
"Overall: A truly interesting brew from a brewery that makes just that. This one has some interesting flavours that are great to let the palette explore. I'll be coming back to this one."
"D - It's definitely a sipper and drinks like a wine/mead/beer combo. Worth a try, though I don't think I'd have it again. This may be more of a braggot and not a beer (though I'm not sure the honey was fermented)."

"O: I do like this beer. Just not quite my cup of tea. Definite honey flavors, but doesn't taste of Mead like Port City Tidings. Grapes are giving it the champagne taste. Very good sipping beer. Would probably drink again for a change of pace. Would probably give it a 4.2 out of 5."

"Drinkability/overall- this beer was very easy to drink as the 9 percent was really not noticeable at all, reminded me of most closely the noble rot I had recently tried but not quite as winy and lacking that tartness, I overall enjoyed this beer and think I would visit it again I would say the biggest surprise for me was the balance as I think I expected sweeter beer, interesting beer and really great story behind worth the shot and experience"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Too sweet for me - I guess this might be a nice dessert offering (like a dessert wine) but I'm not much of a sweet tooth. This is a beer that you only want/need to sip a small amount to enjoy."

"Update 4/1/13: tastings subsequent to this review found the beer to be a little too sweet and syrupy. Scoring adjusted."

""
""

""
""

"O: 3/5, although I do lean toward Tripels and IPAs. It was worth trying but not one of Dogfish Head's better beers. There is too much grape, giving a wine taste without a sweet finish. The carbonation was the most pleasant part of the glass."
"O - An interesting beer. Tastes like a wine/beer hybrid. Definitely an odd taste, but one that really works. It goes down easily with regard to its gravity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall –The feel of the beer was fantastic, but the taste was a bit unbalanced. In the beginning it tastes more like a beer that then seems to turn into a boozy wine. It has some very nice individual characteristics yet the transitions of them from one to another don’t really make for a “smooth” drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Other than the color saffron gets lost in the overall complexity of this beer. I think this beer is one of the recipes that just works. You would think on paper that is would not be a very strong concept, but the proof is in the pudding. Sweet, crisp, lite tannin notes, and a delicious skunky herd overtone that is adjusted harmoniously with the rest of the beer."
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""

""

"overall - 5/5 - For a sweet beer, this is far from overwhelming. I think the sweetness is at the right balance. I've tasted many other sweet beers that really put me off, but not here. This beer is chill haze away from being perfect."
""
"O: Not really my cup of tea. I found it pretty bland and not very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this beer, however it isn’t one of my favorites from DFH. There was a nice balance between sweetness and fruitiness in this beer although it could have maybe used a little bit more. The muscat grapes definitely gave this beer a little bit of a white wine quality. If you appreciate white wines, then you will probably appreciate this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty good beer. It's an easy drinker and at 9% it's not a lightweight. I could definitely have a few of these in an evening but I'd have to space them."
""
"This is a clear golden color with some light foam. There’s an obvious grape aroma (muscat?) but also something more akin to champagne. Tastes light, more on the sweet side of things. Honestly, although this doesn’t sound flattering, it reminds me of sweet white grape juice. I don’t mean that in a negative way, it just has the similar flavor profile in my mind. Effervescent, nuanced, and enjoyable."
""
"O: very delicious beer, very different than anything i've tasted. wow. I'm so glad i've discovered dogfish head beers. This was just the right amount of sweet and just the right amount of everything else. Truly a great beer."

"The taste is very unique and distinct. It has a lot of qualities not typically found in beer, but still retains a strong beer-like presence. It's a bit sour in the way that sour apples or sour grapes are sour. Not the green apple taste of a poorly brewed beer. This actually compliments the beer quite nicely. It has a honey flavour as well and despite my usual aversion to honey, this flavour compliments the beer quite nicely. There are some hops and other spices that balance out the beer very well. I can't place what the spices are. The bottle says saffron. I'm not an herb expert, so I don't know what saffron tastes like. Maybe that's what's making this beer so awesome. The hops are light, but present enough to give the beer just the light astringency it needs. Overall, the beer is sweet and light in flavour and the alcohol character is quite discernible, which I like, but no so harsh that most beer drinkers might have a problem with it. I personally like an alcohol presence in my beer, so I welcome lots of strongly alcohol-flavoured beers. I'd consider this one to have a medium alcohol character. It's not overbearing. Basically, this beer is fucking sweet. If you have the funds and the availability, try it."
"Overall a very interesting beer, in flavor and backstory."

"O: tastes a lot like a high ABV lager with white grape mixed in. Maybe best described as a wine-lager cocktail. I had this a few years ago and I don't remember it being so lagery. It's interesting but not something I'd have again."

"This beer pours a hazy golden color with a very slight head. I like the unfiltered look and bright gold complexion. The nose was stronger than I'd been expecting after reading some other reviews, and different in its fruity malt odor than most other beers. I'm used to strong fruity flavors deriving from the hops, but a first taste reveals a smooth, fruit malt backbone. Instead of a flavor balance provided by hops, the malt counterpoint instead seems to be the champagne-like aspect built into this beer. Thus, the grape and honey promised on the bottle appear, but not in a sweet fashion, as in a dry champagne, much to my delight. The honey almost manifests in the smoothness of the mouthfeel, which is light and crisp but full, like a golden ale/champagne cross. Overall, excellent, and I cannot recall a beer of this style that I would recommend any higher. Well done Dogfish Head."

"Overall: One of the better ""fruit"" beers I have had with a floral taste and fruits in a pretty good combination you will tend to love Midas Touch. Despite not smelling like much it makes up in every other category. Cheers to all and hope you all enjoy!"

"Thanks to wyatt for this one!"
"Body-Very active effervescence on the tongue, pretty light, almost chalky but not unpleasant. Alcohol is mostly hidden. This is really good stuff, good for slow sipping and also after dinner: Just enough sweetness to make it a combination of dessert and a nice drink, though not that sweet. Would get it again, even for the price without question. Truly an individual, nothing I've tried quite like it"
"Pretty unique but I don't think I'll try this one again."
"O - Very crisp and clean beer with ABV very well hidden. I would recommend this beer."
"Yellowish with a finger of fizzy head. Not much aroma to this offering. Fruit flavor up front and along with another sweet undertone that is difficult to place and slightly unpleasant. This is an interesting concept, but definitely NOT something I would repeat or recommend."
"Overall... how to put this. An interesting beer. Glad I tried it. Glad DFH took the time and effort to brew it, and that they keep boldly trying new things. Really. Not going to be stocking up on this one though. Most likely a one-and-done for me. Just thankful it wasn't a drainpour."
"O - This is a very interesting beer that reminds me of Belgian dubbels, minus the yeast. This is a great experimental beer with a solid malt backbone, interesting ingredients, and no hops."
"Pours a golden honey-like color into my glass with no head at all. Aroma of grapes, honey and saffron, taste follows the nose, tasty and fairly easy to drink for what it is. I couldn't drink this every day but man is this a nice treat. A great beer overall"
"O: Somewhat intriguing, though not a home run by any means. Probably could not put down more than one of these in a sitting...or every couple months."
"all 4's is kind of boring. i know. this is kind of unremarkable. interesting, but not ground breaking. good but not excellent."
"Interesting, smells like a freshly opened box of breakfast cereal. But... Its rather weak and doesn't really impress, decent but not a door-buster. Appearance... Well, very little bubbling little lacing and an absent head. It is apricot yellow/orange. Great taste, white grapes, sugars, very spicy- Saffron is very present. Not alot of hops for dfh but rather tasty nonetheless. The saffron is real interesting to find in a beer, quite unique. If you are a fan of dfh, this is one to try. Likewise if you are a fan of spicy beer."
"Overall, I so wanted what was on tap, the bottle is but a shadow..."
"Overall, pretty decent as far as balance and creativity but im pretty sure I wont be pickin' this up anytime soon. Another strange and ambiguous brew from DFH"
"O: solid beer, wasn't too excited by the smell or look of it at first. Interesting flavors that aren't overwhelming."
"A pear like, honey and Yeast like aroma, very intricate. Golden orange appearance with a head dispersal to the rim. Tastes of honey... the muscat grapes leave an impression.. almost like a honeydew melon wine. Palate is medium, creamy and soft to no carbonation. Finish is long and sweet. Very complex and satisfying."
"I will finish in favor of the 9% ABV"
"O: Quite pleasant. Not a lot of ""wow"" (I guess I was hoping for something a little more exotic from a 2700-year-old beer recipe) but definitely drinkable (and it paired well with broiled chicken I had for dinner)."
"O: An enjoyable beer."
"86."
"O - Surprisingly good, although I wasn't expecting anything bad from Dogfish, the ingredients caught my eye as a possible poor choice. This is a great light beer that would go great on a warn summer night. A child between a beer and a white wine, the light sweetness goes well with the perfectly dry finish, while the malt still lingers. I would definitely recommend everyone to at least trying a bottle, even if the style wouldn't be everyone's thing."
"This Beer is Great. Being from CT and living on LI its hard to find this beer. My girlfriend and I were up in CT this weekend and found a 4 pack at CT beverage. I'm happy this beer still exists. I used to be able to get it at my current place of work Port Jefferson Beverage, but there are apparently shortages. I wish that they could brew more. It upsets me that they leave us hanging!"
"Overall, this is a cool beer, but it comes off a little more like wine than beer. The grapes are a little heavy and between the grapes and honey there's a little too much sweetness. It's different and definitely off-centered. Worth a try if you're looking for something new or if you're a big DFH fan."
"It has a slick fairly thick feel. I think is a decent beer with an interesting story. I'll keep a few bottles around."
"Overall - Obviously a treat for those of us outside DFH’s distribution range, this is also just a treat of a beer. I think it’s perfect for a “just one” sort of occasion - before or after a meal, on a sunny afternoon, as a nightcap, or maybe at the beginning of a session. The beer is light, drinkable, but with a big character and a heavier hit than a first sip reveals. A great fusion of many styles that, with such a semblance to wine, falls outside many beer styles. Definitely worth a try."
"Cheers Sam"
"O - After half the glass, the sweetness becomes somewhat overpowering and distracting. Hard to finish."
"O: Excellent. If you have not had Midas Touch it is a must. Even if spice beers are not your thing or wine for that matter, this beverage is a must try."
"A very nice approach of something different or ancient. That's why we all love Dogfish!!"
"Overall, this one is really great. I get this one pretty frequently and it pairs great with sweet and sour pork and saffron rice."
"All in all, it's a fun beer to try but I am not sure I would pick it up again. If I were Midas a few thousand years ago, I might say this is incredible!!!....but then again, King Midas probably didn't have a choice. Your majesty, may I suggest a DFH 90min IPA?"
"This is not your average beer by any means, but it is one of my favorites for an every now and then drink. It's just extremely well done. I've heard it described as somewhere between a beer, wine and a mead. This is exactly accurate, and an amazing example of what you can do with beer. This is one of the beers that opened my eyes to the world of unique and different beers, and for that I am very grateful. Thank you Sam and DFH."
"OVERALL: Midas Touch is a unique and tasty beer. It isn’t something that I would reach for every time, but I will reach for it again when I am in the mood for something out of the ordinary. The spice and unusual fruit flavors work remarkably well together."
"This is a great beer, the colour is a clear golden. I was quite surprised that this was 9% alcohol, it goes down remarkably smooth. I defiantly get the hint of grape and honey. It leaves a bit of a bitter after taste, which I don't mind at all. The smell I got from it was a musty sweetness, reminds me of a white wine scent. I couldn't taste the saffron, but I could see it having some influence in the colour."
"O- A nice change of pace brew for sure. Well put together, enjoyable. Solidly in the ""good"" range."
"The grapes and saffron does not point out, wich was a small disapointment, but it's a really good beer anyways."
"Taste presents very much the same. Strong grape flavors and honey. Even a bit of bitterness. A hint of spiciness that I guess comes from the saffron? it's like drinking a carbonated chadonnay. The finish has a bit of a regular ""beer"" flavor coming from the barley. Medium bodied witha slick oily buttery mouthfeel. It's actually a pretty fun beer to try. Not something I could drink too any of but it's interesting and it's good. It's worth a try every once in awhile."
"O: This is one of those beers I am glad I had the opportunity to try and while I did enjoy it, I am not sure I would seek it out again. But I would not shy away from having more."
"Pours a hazy golden peach like color with good lacing around the beer. Smells of honey, citrus, white wine and spice. tastes of bread, honey,wine. This beer has just the right amount of carbonation and for being a 9% abv they did a good job of masking it. I will be buying some more of this stuff.."
"Cheers."
"O- Having never smelt or tasted saffron this one isn't living up to it's potential. Much more appreciated now than when I had my first bottle of this last summer."
"Overall an very good beer that has some interesting characteristics. But this reviewer thinks it better as a history exercise than a truly drinkable beer."
"2010 Bottle in the hotel room in DC - Pours a hazy deep golden with a frothy off white head...aroma is very malty and grain forward, very light herbal spice with some fruuity esters as well...flavour is similar, sweet gritty barley, dry white vinous grapes, honey and alcohol...hated this the first time I had it and now I really like it, this would be an awesome fall beer..."
"Pours a pale, opaque gold color with little head in the tulip glass. Notes of coriander, honey, and ... lavender? Not much to speak of in the nose. The beer is light in the mouth with little carbonation, which is an interesting combination. Serious lack of malt, almost like a lager. Strong grape taste which fades to alcohol to light herby flavor. Bitter aftertaste is the only hint of hops in this 'nectar'. I'm not sure if this is a beer or a mead, it's so sweet. But the bitterness at the end really saves it. This would be good in 100 degree weather, but I'm not sure if it's something to keep on the shelf for regular use. Like most DFH brews, this isn't much more than a curiosity."
"Future outlook: I'll throw a few downstairs to forget about for a long time, and see if a magical transformation takes place..."
"Overall Drinkability - Depends what you're in the mood. This beer has a big kick in the middle, so if that's what you're looking for."
"Overall, I think this is a great beer. It's not quite on the ""excellent"" scale, but it is a remarkable brew, and worth a try."
"O - Overall a very interesting beer, not one I would drink every day but definitely one of my favorites."
"Pours a hazy straw like color with a small white head. The smell is a little musty, a little sweet and a little bready with a little spice. Feel is medium with good carbonation. The taste first of alcohol, then a little sweetness, maybe some honey, ripe fruit, and spice, not much hop bitterness. Overall this is okay, not one i'll get again, someone told me its the direct opposite of their Palo Santo and I think that pretty true. A little too sweet / different for my taste."
"Overall: The taste is unique, and not in a bad way but also not in an exciting way either. A nice beer to try out but my biggest issue is that this beer gets old fast and it starts to taste more like stale wine then beer."
"This one pours a see through golden copper hue with average carbonation that leaves behind a one finger fast vanishing head and sporadic lacing,the smell is sweet toffee,honey,maple syrup,caramel and boiled candy,it has a light-medium bodied syrupy mouthfeel and has strong tastes of sweet sweet toffee,honey,caramel,boiled candy,sweet grapes,maple syrup and finished with a warm sweet candy syrupy finish and overall i found this drop very sweet and the high ABV very well hidden so it definately would suit desert cheeses but lacks a herbal hoppy punch for me and probably would not revisit anytime soon as i like my hops."
"Overall, like a perfumy golden bock."
"None of us all that impressed with it, but I wouldn't pass up the chance to try it again. It seems like each successive time I drink it, the flavor improves, or maybe I'm more able to discern its subtle taste."
"interesting and enjoyable while definitely unique. remarkably drinkable."
"O-Great beer, very interesting and another unique beer from dogfish head. Very drinkable"
"O- One of my favorites from DFH. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a beer experience. Just wish it weren't as pricey as it is."
"O- very unique beer. It is good and could be a beer to sip on a warm summer day. Its refreshing even though the high avb"
"O:Overall I really like this beer! Never tasted one like this which makes it interesting and unforgetable."
"O: While this beer is without a doubt interesting, after a while I stopped finding it entirely enjoyable. Great for 12oz, but after that, meh."
"overall: very unique style, its nectar-like qualities make it complex and pleasant to drink, abv is good yet not overpowering either."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with almost no carbonation, a heavy body and chewy heavy feel. This is a slow sipper, that was interesting and enjoyable, but probably my least favorite tastiing Dogfish Head beer to date. The aging may have made this even more like an old time beer, which while clever didn't do much for the flavor to me and made it almost seem stale."
"O: Good beer, but it can't quite justify the price. I won't refuse this beer from a friend, but I'm not sure if I will purchase again in the near future."
"Overall really nice. I enjoyed having an '09 that's had a little time to cone into it's own."
"I poured this beer into a glass, it has a hazy orange color body with a little white head that disappears quickly. The smell is sweet of grapes and a hint of honey. The taste starts off a little weird, i get some honey taste then a raisin like on the back, and a spicy finish. Mouth feel is ok. Overall this is a decent beer. I'm glad i tried it."
"O: This is a great brew, much more beer like than I was expecting (this is a good thing!). Very dangerous at 9% abv, I could drink this all day. I'm wondering what this would be with some wild bugs in the mix. Would be a good idea as the ""original"" definitely had some funk."
"Overall: A fine brew. Descriptions on their website and elsewhere lead me to believe this brew would be a little more on the mead or wine side but it turned out to be very much a light bodied beer. Terrifyingly sessionable. Tasty but nothing to write home about. Taste is like a light-bodied lager in its refreshing character but the aroma lets you know how much effort those yeast and their masters put into it. Worth a try but be careful - few 9% beers are this easy too drink."
"O: Another beer that surprised me as to how enjoyable it was. Will definitely have again."
"Still, I'm glad I tried it, and I recommend all beer drinkers to try it just to get a taste of the old world."
"This beer probably seemed like a good idea, but I thought it was really awful. I couldn't even finish it."
"O- I'd heard great things about this beer, and can picture it taking the place of Reisling or other sweet wines on my dinner table. It's gonna ROCK with spicy Thai food!!! I've gotta grab some of this for my Reisling Loving Mom!!! She's gonna flip for this!"
"I went with an aggressive pour since no directions were given on the bottle, plus I did not see any lees in evidence. I had a rocky finger of off-white head briefly until it went back into the ages from whence it came. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity that would have made King Midas proud to have it named after him, plus he would be able to see well into the future with this one. I definitely caught the grape vinousness on the nose, but also the honey sweetness as well as a dry mustiness, no doubt the result of the yeast. Mouthfeel was very viscous, not honey-thick, but full for beer and with an effervescence that seemed to wash my mouth clean. On the second mouthful, following Midas' Cleansing, I was getting a definite white wine dryness along with an underlying honey sweetness. Man, I may need a lay-down after this. Finish had a unique honey/grape/malt admixture that swirled around in the back of my throat. It was a mellow beer for its given ABV and that may be its only drawback - it is too smooth to lay on the unsuspecting and even the more seasoned veterans may be caught unawares. I suddenly began to feel it coming on like a freight train ... Zounds!"
"Overall I still enjoy this in the taste and drink. I've had this many times before, but I think I needed a fresher bottle (or just go for on tap). I seem to remember liking it more in the past, perhaps a re-review is in the cards for this one."
"O: Good but not great. Worth trying but not an everyday drinker."
"I will have to try this one again, although I still thought it was a great brew as is to be expected from Dogfish head."
"At first site with a nice somewhat strong head but later to be paired with a mediocure appearance overall, I expected more from midas touch. The first inhale was of a deep honey mixed with a little spice. I expected the barley to be one of the main features of this beer, but along the lines of the 3rd sip quickly realized this was a beer and white wine match made in heaven. From my personal beer preference it was flat out just too winey for my liking. A giant fan of dogfish at heart...but this one is definitely 60 & 90 minutes apart from the IPA."
"Overall, this is a very one-dimensional beer, and that dimension just doesn't really do it for me."
"O - Its not bad by any stretch, but it is not my cup of tea. I dont like white wine and this is very much like the beer equivalent of a white wine."
"Had gotten this beer for the first time on tap a tthe brewery after the tour. This beer poured out as a crystle clear golden yellow brew with a pretty nice looking head on it. The lacing was minimal but not bad. The smell of this beer had a lot of fresh white grape aromas in the nose, it's very sweet smelling. The taste had the same sweetness on the nose had some very subtle spice flavors throughout. The mouthfeel is medium bodied I think. Overall this beer could be seen as a Braggot or something similar. A spiced ale is fitting as well. I really enjoy this beer, but in small quantity. Very tasty stuff."
"Overall - A wonderful change of pace beer, very easy to drink even at 9% abv. I will purchase again and try aging some as well."
"Mouthfeel:This is a good quality to the beer. Just above medium bodied, the beer coats the mouth well and suits the beer well."
"overall this is a middling brew. moderately enjoyable though dogfish head churns out some much better stuff IMO. 'good' at best; nothing to write home about."
"I really enjoyed this beer; I thought it was delicious. While somewhat thin in body and not overly aromatic, I thought it was delicious and a pleasure to drink."
"O - My girlfriend loves it, I don't. The best thing about this beer is that it weighs in at 9% and its very easy to drink, dryness aside"
"The mouthfeel is fairly full and gently carbonated, it goes down very smoothly. The drinkability is a bit of a mixed bag. The 9% alcohol is absolutely 100% masked, and this'd drink as easily as an American Pale Wheat if it weren't so damn sweet! Overall, this is a good and unique beer that's just a bit away from being great. It's just too sweet to be a full-bore favourite, but I'll probably still pick up singles of this every once in a while."
"O: An interesting beer, reminds me of a tripel. You can tell this is a high alcohol beer. Not something I'd probably pick up again but worth the try."
"It has a mouthfeel very similar to a Miller Lite (which I don't think is a real beer) and overall just doesn't work for me. Like I said, I am a HUGE fan of DFH, but I think they missed the mark on this one. But hey, the girl I date likes it, so maybe it's just me."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a finger of white foamy head that retains and laces very well. The aroma has strong notes of floral and honey. The taste starts malty sweet, then becomes floral, then has hints of honey and finishes with a slight bitterness. The mouthfeel is very smooth and well balanced. Overall a very unique beer that doesn't conform to the usual types... I would definitely recommend."
"O - Ummp, ok."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a SA Perfect Pint glass. This beer pours a clear honey/amber color,the low carbonation produces a thin head that disappears quickly,but leaves some lacing. The nose has a herbal quality with scents of honey,notes of banana and spices. Honey flavor is right up front with sweet grapes following behind. There is also a nice spiciness on the tongue,and a  bready quality. The mouthfeel is medium thick and somewhat oily. This beer has almost no bitterness but somehow avoids being overly sweet and it hides the relatively high ABV very well. Not an everyday brew for me,but a nice change of pace beer. "
"Must applaud DFH on turning back time and bringing this one back from history. A good mix of creativity and knowledge, proves that not all beers need a ton of hops to pull off quality."
"overall - this is definitely not a sessionable beer for me. regardless of the high alcohol content, which the beer hides decently, it's just got such a unique and out there flavor that it's a little hard to drink. tastes pretty good, and maybe with some food, the rather annoying, dry bitterness would subside...but on it's own, the weird bitterness is pretty tough."
"O: overall this beer is worth the try.. I really didn't know what to expect on this one, but it wasn't bad.. pretty decent."
"O- Decent brew, although not my favorite from this brewery. Worth trying out once though."
"The beer is good. The beer is very good. I can’t quite give it a perfect rating here… but it’s close. There needs to be more on the aftertaste for me to go for a perfect score. Regardless, it’s delicious and I can’t wait to try this brew again. Well done Dogfish… well done."
"Can't picture having more than one."
"Notes: Great with any dinner or a night cap beer. Truly should be in your weekly rotation if you have one. Dogfish has done it again!!!"
"O-C-"
"O: This beer doesn’t disappoint. It has a unique flavor with a kind alcohol punch. A nice sipping beer."
"Pours a hazy Orange color with visible carbonation. It comes with a one finger white head that dissipates to a ring around my glass, no lacing is present. The smell is of grapes and an odd sweetness I can't pin down. Taste is less potent than I expected, up front I get that honey like sweetness, then the white wine flavor shows up in the middle of my tongue. Mouthfeel is medium, with average carbonation. I don't think i'll drink this often, but it was a fun beer to have. The taste is unique and I am impressed at how well it hides the high ABV."
"O- an interesting beer that I believe is bet described as a combo ""white-wine-beer"" It is different and I would try it again"
"Poured cloudy golden-yellow with a foamy white head that dissipates relatively quickly. Aroma of sweet sugars and fruits. Taste of white wine, honey, grapes and cherries, with a little hop bitterness for balance. Medium mouthfeel, with some syrupiness that lingers in the mouth. Very complex and tasty, extra points for innovation, as with many DFH brews. This used to be among my favorites when I first started my journey into craft beer, but it's not something I desire to drink too often these days."
"Pours a clear golden color with one finger of white head that leaves a little bit of lace. Taste is sweet but not overbearing, some belgian characteristics for sure. Fruity and somewhat vinous with a bit of yeast and honey maybe. Light/medium bodied and very smooth. Alcohol is very well disguised. A great beer, I'm surprised it doesn't have a higher average rating."
"Drinkability - decent, especially for the ABV. On the other hand this is expensive and at 9% you can't have more than 1-2 at a time."
"D - I probably won't finish the beer."
"T: Goes down sweet and smooth. Lots of honey and white grape-like sweetness with a touch of sourness that's very reminiscent of wine. On the finish, bready malts and some yeast come in. The mouthfeel is really what saves this one. If it was a bit thicker, the sweetness would be overpowering."
"While I am not a huge fan of this beer, I did attempt to keep this review somewhat subjective. While listening to my personal opinions on this beer, I still gave some leniency considering this beer was brewed according to a 2700-year-old recipe with little room for variance by the brewer."
"The smell really intrigued me, kind of like mead with a little bit grape and malt way in the back. I could have used a lot more hop in this beer, it was kind of sweet and almost bland. All the same, the grape and honey part was really interesting because you could actually taste that aspect, so I want to give them credit for at least that unique aspect, although it is probably my least favorite Dogfish Head beer. I also tried it on tap at Howie & Sons a few weeks later and it tasted a little less sweet with the extra carbonation, but it just didn't change my mind. The batches varied alot it seems to me..."
"Overall, this is a white wine lover's beer, and almost a beer lover's wine. It seemed like a Belgian Golden ale and white wine mixed together. Interesting flavors, though not one I would return to often."
"Overall: One of Dogfish Head's few disappointments."
"It was drinkable and the 9% ABV was well concealed. Not bad by any means but I probably wouldn't return to this offering from Dogfish."
"M - Pretty viscous and the malt/honey/grape juice backbone provides for a sticky mouthfeel after each sip."
"Pours a light copper with a foamy white head. Lots of carbonation. Smells much like a saison or some other lighter spicy brew. There's saffron, grapes, and honey. Very light for this level of ABV. Hops are on the sweeter side. Interesting, but not my deal."
"Overall a good beer. Not one of Dogfish's best, in my opinion, but definitely worth trying."
"Poured a cloudy caramel color with an average amount of tight white head. Great lacing on this beer as well. Some spice and malt in the smell, maybe a little honey in there as well. Taste is sweet and malty up front. Then the herbs and spices come on in the finish along with a little bitterness as well. This is an intersting beer, but it's growing on me. Medium mouthfeel, goes down pretty smoothly despite the 9% abv and spices. Overall a pretty decent beer. I didn't think I liked it at first, but by halfway through, it grew on me. I would probably try this again but not until it's available in Wisconsin again."
"Overall I would say that this was a good unique brew. Midas Touch blurs the line between beer, wine and mead. There were a lot of different things going on with this beer that made it pretty complex but not over done. This may not be everyones cup of tea, but I am pretty adventurous beer drinker so this feeds my need to search out the odd and unique. This ins't a beer I could drink more then one of or keep around in the fridge, but it is good for mixing things up a bit and I feel like the wine like quality's this beer has would appeal to women. If you like unique beers and enjoy a glass of mead and white wine on occasion then this brew might be for you. I was a little late hopping on the Dogfish head train but I am really starting to like their style, wonder what other odd beers they have waiting for me to try."
"It reminds me of a sauvignon blanc with hops. Not the best beer I've had from Dogfish but it's definitely worth a try if you're interested in the whole ancient ale thing."
"D-Not the best beer that DFH has to offer, my first endeavor into their ancient ales, worth a try buy not really worth the price of a 4 pack. EDIT-After having two more the drinkability is not the same level as other DFH products. The spices do not make for an easily sessionable beer."
"O: An interesting combination of flavors. The honey gives the smell a sort of sweetness not often found in beer and grapes remind one of wine."
"I've also tried the 60 minute IPA from DogFish (I thought it seemed good for what it was, but IPAs are one of the few beers I am still working on acquiring a taste for). It was pretty good, though, which help influence me to grab this one. I am happy I did. I will definitely be buying this again."
"So like I said, this is not my favorite offering from DFH but it was intriguing enough that I will enjoy drinking the other three bottles from the four pack."
"D- 4 A hair more of the grapes than I'd prefer has me thinking wine and not beer at moments, but there is just enough going on otherwise to keep me interested and generally enjoying this brew. It is certainly 'different' - like a lot of DFH brews - but I like it. At 9% ABV it can sneak up on you; I thought the alcohol was pretty well hidden. It is a little pricey... Nonetheless, I'll likely buy it again. It's something I could enjoy every once in awhile."
"Thanks Sam."
"Overall a nice selection I think the best quality of this beer is its ABV the high alcohol really compliments the other flavors."
"Considering this is year round brew I expected a more complex taste. Not that this is flavorless but I'd prefer a spicier Tripel as appose to this sweet style. Nothing much left to say, just wasn't mind blowing as I anticipated. Stay thirsty my friends."
"Midas Touch has always been one of my favorite ""off centered ales"" because it is different enough to be interesting, but not so much so that it is cliché. I think this is a great brew for those in the mood for something different, or looking for a beer to give to wine loving friends. Maybe part of my high drinkability score is due to a near religious experience I had trying this at the Milton tasting room while on one of the best vacations of my life, but I am totally okay with that."
"O: Just not really my kind of beer. Have had this a few times and just can't get over the flavor/sweetness combination. It does taste a little better with some food though, probably because the food mutes some of the sweetness. I give DFH some credit for making this though, I really do like the concept behind it."
"Overall - This a very unique beer. Doesn't really fit into any great style, but fits well into just about any white wine drinkers bill."
"Overall excellent. I'd happily drink four of these and call it a night, it would take all night to drink since they sip so slow. Expensive, I know, but worth it for a special occasion."
"Into a tulip glass on 3.6.11., this pours a very clear and bright amber highlighted gold color. What a brilliant shine! Smell is that of an earthy and tart fruit spice, perhaps from the saffron and grapes. Aroma is very similar to a crisp and sweet white wine with its bright malt sweetness. A moderate and crisp body lets the earthy fruit and spice play on the palate and empty on a delicate honey noted finish. Next time I try this, I'd like to pair it with a light salad and/or a mild seafood dish. This is also an ultra cool time-machine into the ancient past..."
"Bottled 1/6/11"
"D/O: Definitely glad this comes in 4-packs and not 6-packs because of the abv, I'd be in trouble with the latter! This is definitely another solid brew from DFH"
"Perhaps it was the particlar bottle (and considering that it's DFH, I'm certainly willing to take a second chance)... but this brew was much more sour than spicy."
"Served from bottle in goblet glass at refrigerator temperature. Pours with thin head which dissipates quickly. Aroma is much more of a tart, young wine than of beer- quite intriguing. Flavor is extremely complex but is mostly of the advertised muscat grapes. Is this a sparkling wine or a beer? After a few sips the flavor of honey emerges subtly, adding to the questions surrounding this brew. Given the 9% abv, I'd say wine. Not necessarily a session beer but not one to pass up- this one is too cool to miss. I would love to quaff the next one at a renaissance faire with a giant turkey leg. Recommended."
"disappointed. I swear when I first tried this beer a few years ago that it was much better. odd, but all 4 bottles in this pack taste the same."
"Complex and tasty, Midas Touch is an ancient ale that transcends contemporary styles. Superb."
"Much more of a delicious malt to this offering. It's been a good six months since I've had this beer on tap. The malts and grains here are delicious and I get less of that grape taste. Still, it proves to be sot of a berry/wine type beer. I updated my review for taste on this one."
"D - Very easy to drink, and can't wait to get it again. Friends really liked this beer too."
"After drinking this and a Dunkleweizen, I definitely have to go for a hopbomb in about 30 minutes."
"Poured a meager 1/4"" head which almost immediately dissipated to nothing. Hazy honey colored. Smells of malt and honey and has a slightly floral or herbal smell which I'm supposing is from the saffron. Taste is basically a lager with honey. And the whole thing is a little salty. So hey, decent beer, interesting, I understand it's based on a historic recipe and all that, but when all is said and done what you've basically got is a sweet pale beer."
"D - Not likely to have more than one of these at a sitting."
"Flower & Herb adventure gets my thumbs up"
"d: this is pretty good drink to just kick back with. The fizzy sweetness gets you up front, then you get a smooth roasted flavor with honey. Quite good, though almost (almost) a bit too sweet up front for a beer. Really does remind you of a wine."
"The beer is bright golden with a tall fluffy head. smells of honey, grains and white grapes. The taste is very sweet and just a bit tart. There are flavors of honey, bread and grape with a hint of alcohol. The sweetness makes my cheeks pucker, it's heavy and chewy. This is an interesting beer, it's easy to drink but you probably wouldn't want to drink too many."
"D: Although I did enjoy the history behind the beer and the different style using grapes, barley, honey and saffron I wasn't a huge fan of the beer. I did enjoy trying something different from my regular IPAs but mixing white wine and mead together...not my thing. I would not buy this beer again unless I wanted to use it to teach a history lesson."
"D - Not a bad drink by any means, just not my cup of tea."
"D: like it, it has its place, but I won't be getting it every weekend."
"Drink - Another DFH beer that I thoroughly enjoyed. The alcohol was very well hidden and the flavours were unique. This is definitely something I will buy again."
"An off-centered beer for sure. This blurs the line between beer, champagne and wine, but that was what the brewers intended. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it has a great story behind it. My only complaint was the alcohol seem to step over some of the flavors. You could easily pair this up with various dishes. Very interesting beer! I'll pair the rest up with some good food."
"Overall I thought that it was an alright beer, but that strong steel reserve flavor really overpowers the complexity of what they have going on here. I really liked it at first, but the more I got into the bottle the more I started to dislike the nasty aftertaste. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I honestly don't think I'd ever buy this again, especially at the exorbitant price they're asking for it."
"This ""elixir"" pours a golden hue/light straw color in my glass. The head was a one finger white cloud that dissipated quick and left no lace. I pick up some raisin, honey, a bit of earth, and grape juice in the nose. This ale leans on the sweet side. As I sip the raisins present themselves again and it has some white wine characteristics. Honey sweetness all the way through. Not much in the way of hops but I don't feel they are needed. Medium body, medium carbonation round out the brew. This was better than expected after reading the ingredients listed. Very sweet but good. Perhaps a wine drinkers gateway to the better beverage."
"D- Great beer, if you have the penny spend it for this unique experience! Sweet for my taste, but i appreciate this beer, and will buy it again."
"one of my favorite beers, and interestingly a bit more spicy on tap that from the bottle."
"Poured a clear dark amber with a very small fizzy head that fully dissapated and had no lacing. The aroma was of light cereal malts, piney hops and a doughy yeast with mild notes of grapes, honey and spices. It tasted bitter and mildly sweet at first and ended with a bitter acidic flavor with hints of grapes and had a strong alcohol finish. Mouthfeel was light in body and oily in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall an interesting ale."
"Drinkability: Too sweet to enjoy a second. The high ABV is not masked at all and leaves a somewhat unpleasant alcohol/solvent note in the aftertaste."
"D - Overall another fine concoction from Dogfish; I really enjoyed this beer and thought it was original and flavorful; packs a good punch of unique flavors; I would have another for sure"
"D: smoothness allows this brew to go down easily; not too heavy; sweetness keeps it from being session-worthy, but overall a great beer to drink"
"midas touch is a very unique beer indeed. The taste is bitter at first but not overly bitter. Then it changes to a sweet honey-like sensation paired with the grapes and saffron. The finish of midas touch is really smooth for a beer with this much flavor. I really love this beer it's one of my favorites."
"I'm quite disappointed with this brew from Dogfish Head since I like just about all of their beers. What a letdown."
"D - well, its not bad tasting, but the harshness of the mouthfeel and the abv slow you down a bit."
"All around a good beer. Its not on my short list of must haves but enjoyable no less."
"12 oz into a snifter...this should be interesting...color is not what I expected...not sure what I expected, but it's a fairly normal color. Not a huge head. Wow, I can definitely taste the alcohol. It's also exceptionally sweet. I'm not going to accuse it of being unbalanced however, because this is a unique beer and I respect the brewer's efforts to recraft a historical beverage. Not one I can drink two of in a row, but recommended to try."
"Pours a clean golden yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, dry grapes and a small spice. In the taste, dry fruit, mainly grapes, and spicy. A spice bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with adry spice in the aftertaste. Quite spicy, and lots of fruitiness. Interesting, but just OK."
"Dogfish is a great brewery."
"D. Strange beer but really good to try. I would give this one a try if you have yet to sample it."
"Drinkability, i hate this part of the review. You could potentially drink a 6 pack if thats what you're in to."
"Serving type: Bottle"
"drinkability; taste very interesting and quite drinkable for 9% abv., still the alcohol could be better hidden."
"Bright golden peach orange. Body and head is a tad thin but lacing is really sticky. I am actually getting more of a really sweet non bitter pineapple like DIPA on the nose. Smells really sweet and not bitter or hoppy at all. I am also picking up a bit of the grapes. I am picking up several things in the taste. First off there actually does seem to be a bit of a bitterness on the backend. I get lager like cereal, white grapes and the honey is not so prominent to me. Mouthfeel is very slick and oily. Almost kind of sludgy quality. The only downside for me is the heat. This is one big alcohol burn. Overall I expected not to like this. Wasn't near the overly sweet mess I was expecting. Actually thought it was pretty well rounded and crafted. Doesn't taste too abnormal to me at all."
"D - This was my gateway to craft beer, and I still drink it regularly. Maybe for the purpose of nostalgia. Also, not the cheapest beer available, so that's another knock, but if I could find it on tap, I'm sure I'd drink more."
"drinks average. not super anxious to have this one again, but it's pretty good anyway."
"Overall a nice beer, very different from the norm which is also good."
"Pours hazy orange with a foamy, lasting, white head. Aroma is of yeast, grape juice and bready malt. Full tangy body. Taste is of bready malt, sweet honey, some grapes, herbal hops and alcohol. Massive, long, dry finish. Strong, unusual brew. It must be made by Dogfish Head."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability is great. I feel like I haven't drank as much as is gone from my glass! Would recommend for all DFH fans. Another great ale!"
"The aroma is sweet with wheat, yeast, malt, fruit, and spice. The appearance is orange and gold with a smaller head. The taste is like the aroma with a rich sweet and buttery finish. The plate is smooth. Overall this is a great beer but the aroma does not smell as good as it tastes."
"D: For me, it's a one bottle session. Can't really see myself drinking one after another. Still, a good brew!"
"Overall, I'm not a huge fan of this. It's a little boring."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass or straight out of the bottle. From notes: A - Slightly hazy saffron golden orange. Decent sized white creamy head. S - A lot of grape and honey. Also a good deal of spice and floral smell. T - Lots of honey and semi-acidic grapes. Decent amount of malt present. A variety of spices dance around along with some floral and herbal taste. Sweet wine-like taste with the spices giving it a bit of a kick. Alcohol taste is present but not overly so. M - Medium starting to go toward full body and moderate carbonation. Sticky feeling and flavors. D - not a bad beer."
"D: Very good drinkability for a 9% abv."
"D - interesting flavours, refreshing without cringing from the 9% ABV, a risk that pays off well"
"D - Low. This beer is not the style that I like. I had big hopes though, but it is just not for me."
"I had had enough after about half a bottle; literally drank the 2nd half the next day."
"D - Between the florals in the smell and the dry grapes in the taste, it's not one I could drink one after another. That said, it's still a great brew and I'd enjoy having it each time a batch is made."
"Taken for what's it's made of and the fascinating story behind it, it's quite a treat. While it's surprisingly crisp and dry, the mellow honey roll and kiss of malt gives it a touch of weight. Leave enough space of time in between having a glass of this. In other words, if you enjoy it as I do, I wouldn't suggest drinking this more than once every 3-4 months. It's a tasty respite from the norm. But you can't/shouldn't knock back too many."
"I let this pour warm up a little, but I like this one better cold. Drinks like a white wine, but not one to repeat often in a session for me due to the sweetness. Something you should try at least once."
"D- This beer is a nice drinker when you don't want a ""normal"" beer. Nice for a after dinner beer. The ABV is a little higher on this but doesn't really show until the beer warms up. A nice above average beer from Dogfish Head."
"Dogfish Head is known for specializing in fine brews of near-incomparable uniqueness, and Midas Touch, to my mind, is one such beer (especially considering its historical background). The sweet and inviting aroma opens up to a most pleasant flavor profile, characterized by a tasty honey sweetness akin to a traditional mead, accentuated by the sweet and tangy grapes, well balanced by the barley, which is followed by a most delightful aftertaste that lingers nicely. From start to finish, i would say this beer is superb in many respects, and therefore highly recommend it to those who seek something truly unique in a beer. I will gladly buy it again."
"D - Very Drinkalble beer if you enjoy the sweet stuff. Higher ABV could sneek up on you if you kept going. Personally would prefer this more as a meal finisher / dessert beer. Another great beer from DFH."
"this beer is too sweet to be considered drinkable. I will give DFH credit, they certainly created an ""off-centered beer"" but this off-centered fella didn't get it."
"D - It drinks smooth. It goes down easy with no taste of alcohol."
"as stated above I'm glad I took the plunge and bought this ancient ale. For nothing else it was cool to drink an ale that the recipe came from a 2,700 year old tomb, Can't beat that on the cool scale."
"I bought this beer at uptown liquor in whittier, and i must say i was pleasantly surprised.This had one of the most complex tastes i've ever had. every time i took a drink i noticed something new about the flavor.The slight crispness and the kick from the grape after taste gives it a wine feel to it that is unexplainable. I drank three at one sitting only because i was intrigued by the beer itself to the point where i couldn't get enough.The name itself really describes the beer.The first drink is rough but if u give it a few seconds u will really appreciate the craftsmanship.I think the only down side is the label, not very attractive almost looks like a mini bottle of wine."
"D-well considering i buy this beer a lot and have never regretted it, i'd say the drinkability is decent. i've never had more than one in a one sitting, but i wouldn't mind doing so. doesn't drink too much like other 9% beers but its not quite as drinkable as say...a 90 minute. the taste continues to be unique and satisfying through out the experience."
"Picked up a loose bottle at the local beer store. The beer pours a bright golden-yellow color, with a slight head that quickly disperses. The beer has an almost Saison aroma to it. There are notes of fruit, roast, and green spices (which I had a hard time placing...basil and something). The beer is sharp and crisp as it passes your lips, and quickly followed by a roasted barley and peppery flavor. The spicy notes continue through into the aftertaste, combined with a very slightly sour malt character. Lingering finish, which allows some time to take in all the different flavors before the next sip. This is a very unique brew, and rather tasty, but not one I would tackle 'en mass'."
"Well-bodied, never feeling too thick or thin, and the nice dry semi-sweet finish keeps it drinkable."
"D - Well, you aren't going to throw back a ton of these, it's definitely a sipper. Still, I really like this beer and applaud DFH for taking a chance on this amazing brew."
"D: This is a beer I drink a lot, to me it is just like a cheaper, readily available toned down version of Chateau Jiahu."
"Pours a clear dark yellow, almost gold. Very little head and lacing. Aroma is of grapes, herbs, and hone. Flavor follows suit with the aroma. Flavor is dominated by grape sweetness and floral honey. Big flavor impact from whatever herbs are used. No forthright grain or hop flavor and aroma. I enjoyed this beer the first third of the glass, but things turned south quickly and it ended up being a drainpour. The bitter herb flavor became too dominant as the beer warmed, and the grape flavors were also unpleasant and warmer temperatures."
"Very interesting, but I would never choose to drink a six pack of this or anything like that."
"I'm glad I finally got to try this."
"For a 9% this drinks very easy."
"Definitely not bad, but a bit overpriced I think. Still, try it if you can, it is a refreshing departure from most beer and a great offering of an ""off-centered ale"""
"D- Not really something I could take more than one of because of the vinous quality. Cool idea for a beer and should be experienced. This gets considerably better as it warms to room temperature and perhaps that holds truer to the original essence of the brew being made without nifty refrigerators or electricity for that matter"
"It's cool that they resurrected something ancient that tastes like a lightly carbonated white wine. But I'm not sure why they've chosen to brew this year-round."
"Going by memory again but I can't forget this beer since I've never really had a beer that tasted as close to wine as possible as this does. I don't like wine so I'd take this beer over wine any day which tells you that it still is beer. The first thing I smelled was those white wine grapes and the malt they used to match the honey. The malt and the honey mixes in well together the honey being subtle. Couldn't detect any hops at all which also contributes to the wine like character of this beer. Light carbonation adds to a very smooth mouthfeel and body. I really couldn't detect the 9 percent either which means they really used quality ingredients which makes it such a top notch beer when it comes to quality. When I smell wine the alcohol always comes out the most but this since its so well crafted and almost as much in alcohol as wine it smells of everything they put into it. Because of this it makes me come out liking this beer even though I probably wouldn't drink more than 2 in one night. This is good if you want a diversion during a session."
"After several bad beers, I have lost almost all hope in DFH for anything besides IIPAs"
"O- Overall, this is a great beer. It definitely opens your eyes to the evolution of beer from the nearly 2,700 year old recipe to the beer we normally consume today."
"D: Alcohol was quite noticeable (not surprised that it's 9% ABV) and the overwhelming grape taste hamper this one's drinkability a bit."
"Drinkability: I would've given this a perfect 5.0, but that's only when it is served at cellar temperatures. If served in the high 30's to 40's like most beers a lot of the taste is closed off and the beer becomes underwhelming."
"Clear golden body with a light head that disappeared quickly leaving a decent lacing. The nose was full of fruit and caramel with a hint of lime. The body of this beer is very present, yet it's a drinkable beer at 9.0% ABV. Malty, bread presence finished with a grainy bitterness. The lingering tasted like fried bananas. One of the reasons I like this beer is it's a good conversation piece. I've introduced it to friends that are non-craft beer drinkers and share the story behind it and the reactions have always been ""this is a good beer!"" While it's not an exceptional beer, it sort of embodies the craft beer culture."
"A worthy experiment, as many of Dogfish's brews are. I agree with the Bros. that this would go well with spicy/garlicky/meaty dishes. Not sure if this goes with nachos and the game, but it's worth a shot regardless."
"Not a beer I would buy all the time, but a good one to get every once in a while in a mix sixer."
"Enjoy!"
"Oily, slim but sharp bubbles. Full bodied, robust."
"O - This one stands alone as a unique beverage. I'm all for experiments along the lines of this one. Don't expect I'll be coming back to this one but glad to have met it along my tasting journey."
"This is a great one. Clear beautiful golden ale with a good sized white head and nice bits of lace here and there. Some light carbonation evident. Smell is light sweet malt, fresh bread and a bit of pepper. Yeasty fruitiness folds into faint pears and apples and in the back some grapes. Taste is like the nose but bigger and broader. Subtly complex. Malt core is big and bursting with golden ale flavor. Sweetness is balanced by a vinous tartness and yeasty bread center. Saffron adds depth to the bread and is the perfect accent to the artful malt blend. Light fruits flow in and give a platform for the muscat grapes to meld with the hops in the finish. Hops are earthy and mild. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. Feel is crisp and creamy at the same time. The weight is perfect as it flows like a session ale but caresses the tongue like velvet. Something this strong should not go down this easily. Super drinkable and about to become a staple in my house. Nice brew Sam!!!"
"Very expensive brew not what I would look for next time."
"Kudos to DFH for skating on the edge, and looking good while doing it. poured medium gold from a 12 oz bottle, decent white head that faded quickly, aroma of mead and young white wine. Not much malt or any hops. Flavor true to aroma, with a medium to light body with a honey & grape juice sweetness kept in check by a light tannic and possibly hop bitterness that kept the palate clean. A light boozy note for an aftertaste. overall a nice change of pace, leaning more toward the wine end of the spectrum than beer, worthy of a sampling or as a gift for the gastronomically adventurous."
"Drink- The first couple sips were the best. I'm glad I could chalk this one up. I'll have to try the other ancient brew series."
"Drinkability is top notch. While it is a sweet tasting beer, I personally would drink it in cycles. This is a great beer anytime of the year, but it's definitely best around the holidays. My extreme appreciation goes to the makers at Dogfish Head for making such good products. Keep it going!"
"The aftertaste lingers around for a while. Great beer overall not something you would drink every day but definitely a beer i will revisit."
"Definitely one to try if you haven't just to say you've had it. It is an interesting brew especially since its considered to be one of the oldest recipes still in existence."
"I recommend trying it - Seasoned pro or amateur"
"D - A truly unique brew, this is definitely worth trying, though I can't entirely recommend it. It's also just a bit too strange to drink more than one in a session."
"D: Grape as teh main flavor of a beer is not my favorite, this is an interesting beer and worth trying but not one to have all the time. Very complex."
"It is not very drinkable, because due to the sweetness and alcohol, if you do not take this with food, you may be choking down the last gulp. Lastly, DO NOT LET THIS BEER GET WARM!! It turns into a beast."
"Okay atmosphere. Appearance is pretty nondescript. Nose is a bizarre balance of grain and [mostly] sweet and tart components. Flavor has only a touch of grain pull through, but the other components rule the day. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Drinkability: Not to interested in trying this one again. Its OK. I do like the idea."
"This is a different brew - not in a bad way. Easily one of the best of the style that I've had. I actually could session this. Caseworthy - although the abv and initial taste (let it warm) may leave more for me if I'm sharing...giggity, giggity..."
"Smells of light honey sweetness, floral notes and a general light fruitiness. Tastes a good deal sweeter than it smells, but a touch of crispness, some husky grain and a quick flare of grassy/herbal bitterness at the swallow keep the sweetness somewhat in check. Fruitiness of the tangy variety- tart apple peel, white grapes. An elusive sweet spiciness. Smoothish body with tight, prickly carbonation. Rather warming finish, yet it doesn't taste ""big"" beforehand. Could really sneak up on you."
"Drinkability: Definitely a sipper beer. Should be drank like wine, but it definitely can go down smooth and often. Every Dogfish head fan should give this beer a try. Reminded me of a spiced up hef in some regards."
"D: Easy drinker with great flavor."
"Ok i've never been good at describing wine or beer but here I go... It's more of a dessert beer than anything else. Nice saffron finish, but if you dont like saffron don't even bother. It would pair well with fish, not oily, Ceviche, blue cheese, tart fruit, Keylime pie and or Cioppino. I liked it but would not drink it alone."
"D: This should be summer sipper, can go down very easily. Enjoyed this totally different beer. Every Dogfish fan should give it a go and an adventurous newbie who likes hefeweizzens."
"Not my favorite."
"Pours an ultra clear, golden honey color. A thin off-white microbubbled ring occurs. Smell is very much on the white grape side, with a slight floral quality. Tastes better than the nose, imo. The pronounced grape is tart and effervescent, like a champagne, but the honey smooths it out in the end. Maybe it feels a bit oily, but this is not a typical brew, and is suitable for what it is. The end is bitter and reminds me still of the bubbly.. an interesting brew for sure."
"Pours a pale orange color with a white head that dissipates quickly and not much lacing. Smell is very sweet with grapes, honey, alcohol, perfumey. Taste is pretty complex, spice esters, honey, saffron, grape skin. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, low to medium carbonation. Overall, an interesting brew that pushes the limits and I appreciate it. I will try this again and finish the 4 pack but probably won't buy it again."
"D--Even though this is a 9.00%, I don't really feel it. But the overly sweet taste is a put off for me."
"D: Despite the intense sweetness, it didn't become cloying or overbearing, which is sort of rare for a Dogfish Head beer."
"The beer pours to a dark golden color with a white thin head that disappears fairly quickly. At 9% ABV it gives off a slight alcoholic smell mixed with fruity and sweet scents. The taste is light with grape, honey and subtle hoppy notes. Im a big fan of this beer, the mouth feel is not overpowering and leaves a clean flavor on the tongue."
"D: A fun, unique and interesting beer. Kudos to Dogfish Head for pushing the limits. I wouldn't want more than a few ounces of this. Midas Touch is an intriguing brew, and worth a try."
"D - almost a borderline sessionable brew if a little less sweeter, all in all a very flavorful imaginative creation that I wouldn't hesitate having again"
"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of biscuit malt, flowers, honey, grapes and a little bit of alcohol. The flavor is mainly grapes and flowers, with some honey, biscuit malt and alcohol mixed in. As the beer warms, I start to get a little more caramel malt and spices, although the spices are hard to identify. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"poured a hazy golden yellow with slightly brownish yellow highlights that had a thin head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was really vinous with some candy sweetness, honey, slight spice and citrus notes lurking in the background. The honey and grape character was also more potent palate with sweet citrusy notes but had a candy sugar punch. the brew was light to medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, citrusy, vinous, sticky finish . It drank very good and was surprisingly better than I thought it was from the firt time I tasted it."
"Salud!!"
"D: Drinkable, Not an everyday beer, something you can't ""slam", overall something I'd drink again."
"D: Overall pretty good. Uniqueness makes this beer what it is, would not want to spoil it by drinking too much at once."
"This brew has a higher ABV at 9%, but it was great. A great sweet, almost wine like flavors, but a nice heat that comes along with the brew. Another great brew by DFH."
"Drinkability: An exceptional and unique beer. Before trying this, I assumed it would be some earnest but ultimately lackluster attempt to resurrect some ancient beer style. What I got was a tasty and expressive beer that really doesn't taste like anything else I've tried. This beer is definitely worth a shot and really sums up DFH's commitment to making ancient and unique beer styles."
"Overall: Midas Touch is a cool idea for a beer. It's got some interesting flavors and some good qualities. I'm glad I tried it but it's not really something I would drink again. Seems more like a novelty. That being said. It's not bad beer."
"I'd take the draft over the bottle any day, though they both have their place."
"It drinks ok, defiantly a sipping beer in the same sense as a wine, for the same reasons a wine is good for sipping I don't like the wineyness of it though not for me but objectively speaking definitely worth a try."
"D= Not a bad beer, I'm not too much into fruity winy beers, but it is a good once in a while drink. And giving the history and process of the Midas formula i good to at least try it."
"I liked the idea of this beer ever since I'd heard about it, though I could never force myself to shell out $15 for a 4-pack. Luckily, my girlfriend surprised me with it today and we split a bottle over dinner. While a little too sweet and expensive to enjoy on a regular basis, I wouldn't mind having a couple around for special occasions (not to mention to see how it ages!)"
"Poured a golden amber with a two fingered white head with a desending lace vail the entire glass. Aromas of honey, booze, and yeast. Grapes and honey on the palate with a musky oak finish with enough effervesence to make it most interesting if not wine like."
"Im am very suprised with this beer and must say its a win in my opinion!"
"Drinkability: Unique and a nice twist. Almost a cross between a dessert wine and a ale. Will drink again and again."
"D- Really good. Clean taste that pleases the palate. The initial reason I was hesitant to try this was the $15 price tag for a four-pack of a style I am unfamiliar with. I am glad that I caved because it is great. the alcohol presence is covered well and the ancient ale concept is really cool. I think this would pair well with any kind of fruit based or lighter dessert."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall, I found the Midas Touch a uniquely enjoyable beer with an interesting flavor profile. It leaves a few things to be desired but definitely worth a try in my opinion."
"Overall, I like the flavor of Steel Reserve Malt Liquor more than this (and in all honesty, as a craft brew drinker, steel reserve is NOT BAD AT ALL! try it some time)."
"Poured a nice clear pale orange color from a 12 oz bottle, with ABV and date of bottling on the label. Little to no head, with the aroma being high on honey. Mild carbonation and little to no lacing. The taste is a blend of honey and hint of saffron with a sweet yet fruity and tart aftertaste. It is a complex blend of flavors that mask the high ABV very well. Drinkability is very good, with a nice crisp finish. Another interesting brew from Dogfish Head; they keep churning out interesting brews to keep the palate guessing. Absolutely worth a try."
"D: Like drinking a wine rather than beer. BUT. It's even easier to drink thank wine, so beware."
"D- I didn't hate pushing through the 4 pack, but I didn't relish it either"
"I just really enjoy this beer, I wasn't sure at first...but didnt have a glass with me so I had to drink it out of the bottle. When I drank the other 3 in the pack I used a pint glass, and it was SOO much better. In the glass it definately brought out the different depths. I could definately sense the ""dryness", and got a touch of the saffron. I couldnt really taste any melon or papaya (that was in the description). Just a good brew!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, but on the full side. There is a low amount of carbonation and finishes dry. This is a beer that you have to sip. Not something that goes down extremely easily, but it is definitely enjoyable."
"overall, its a tasty beer."
"A nice easy-drinking beer from DFH."
"Excellent beer! Served with a nice, foamy, frothy, white head that lasts and good lacing. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is malt, sweet, vineous, Flavor is like nose, but far more rich - really pick up on the honey and grapes, saffron not so much.... perhaps a little in the bitterness. Body is full and lush with perfect. Finish is like flavor and actually fairly long, with the alcohol mellow."
"an ale made with saffron....who would do this?....only dogfish head"
"Drinkability: A very unique brew to say the least. I like the concept and the experimentation, but I'm not sure this would be in my regular drink rotation."
"Wow! This seems more like a desert beer. Very sweet. Complex and unique to say the least. I can't really even describe it. This has to be one of the best ""sweet"" beers I've had, if you consider it beer at all. Very pricy at about four dollars a 12oz. bottle. In my opinion it would be the perfect beer after a heavy meal to finish the night. At 9% ABV three or four and you'll finish the night right with a great desert finisher. Would go great with multiple deserts like heavy chocolate, cheese cake, etc... Only a 4 on drinkability because I think more than 3-4 would overwhelm most. In my opinion this is a classic, true, above average cutting edge brew that challenges the norms of beer making. A must try at least once."
"O: Really disappointed with this one."
"Dr. One is good, but I'll save the others for another night. So, I guess my inability to come up with 250 words is some indication of the nature of the beer."
"D - Regardless of how much I hated it and how even by the end the taste never evened out, I applaud dogfish head for creating a beer little have tackled. It wasn't so bad that it would have been a drain poor but for the price I could have gotten something heavier, better tasting, and with more covered up Alcohol. Only drink this if you love wine!"
"Taken during hurricane ""alex"". Served in a bayern-pilsener glass. Look: Amber right color, thin and creamy foam head, good lacing, head lasts forever. Smell: Green grapes and honey. Taste: Cascade of spices and spicy hops, some alcohol too. Mouthfeel: Fruity and spicy, viscous body, evident the abv. Drinkability: A beer with a lot of grapes and alcohol, i liked watching the rain."
"D - this was a cool beer to try. Obviously, I haven't had anything similar to this before, but really enjoyed it. It was almost like a white wine / triple combination. I would definitely buy this again."
"Drinkability is where this beer loses some points. Very enjoyable in small quantities, but the honey sweetness is a little much and means that one bottle of this can be a little bit difficult to finish. If one split a bottle between two or three this would work well as a dessert drink or possibly as an apperitif."
"O: A combination of high ABV and strong flavor makes this a ""one and move on"" type of beer. It'd be best as a night cap."
"Pours a hazy orange yellow color with a thin white head and good lacing. Smells of muscat grapes, saffron, white wine, malts. Godly. Tastes sweet from muscat grapes, saffron, some citrus. Hops are there but they only lighten the sweetness just a tad. Mouthfeel is exceptional and drinkability is insane. One could drink half a gallon. Not good for your liver that it tastes so awesome."
"Overall a great brew as ive come to expect from DFH, Probably my third favorite of theirs behind 60 min ipa and their IBA respectively."
"This beer poured a very nice dark golden color with a small head that left not lacing on the glass. the color was also surprisingly transparent, which I thought made it look really appealing. You could smell the yeast and maybe a hint of alcohol. The first sip took me very much by surprise. It is malty and sweet, but not too sweet. It was a nice change of pace to what I have been drinking lately. You can really taste the honey in this beer, and it gives it a very nice sweet finish. You can taste the alcohol just a wee bit in there too. I was actually surprised when I looked and saw that this beer was 9% because it is definetly hidden well in this which is also surprising since it is such a nice easy going beer. The mouthfeel was great on this, it coated the mouth nicely, had a nice medium body, and decent carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is just awesome. I could drink these all day. I will for sure be drinking more of these in the not too distant future."
"Overall this has a high drinkability, pick up a 4 pack and dip in every 6 months; that's my plan anyways."
"Too close to a fruity white wine for me. I appreciate the beer for what it is, but not for me. Will explore again I'm sure."
"Meh. The first sip was great, no joke, but it just degrades with every warmer sip as each change in degree brings out the alcohol more and more. They must have used a crap load of honey to clear this one up so much. Were any specialty grains used at all? Am I tasting saffron? Is it really worth trying to taste for?"
"D- More of a unique beer, and not one I would consider buying in bulk. It has some qualities that I really enjoyed, and I love seeing breweries mix things up, but this brew just seemed a little far off and too far on the sweet side for me. On the other hand, for a herbal/spiced beer, it's one of my favorites. If that's your thing, I think you'll like this one. A good effort, but not completely my cup of tea."
"D - It has it's time and place. For me, I'd love to work on pairing this with food. Maybe Thai? I think I'd prefer it as a nice departure from my normal beers without getting something ridiculously strange."
"D: This is a very good beer in regard to flavor profiles and overall drinkability. I feel that I would have a hard time drinking a few of these as I would get rather bored with the strange taste that is a relic of the past. I love what DFH has done with these ancient beers, and do like this one, but a very nice beer to try, not to session."
"Overall, drinkability was rather nice. Could have done with more hoppiness."
"Overall, I am mildly ambiguous on Midas Touch. On the one hand, it's decent. On the other hand there's enough of a balance here, as well as the sentimental value of it being an ancient recipe to make it something I occasionally indulge in, and recommend greatly to beer newbies."
"D: If I put away several of these, I'd have to say ""bekos", too. (Look up your linguistic history.)"
"Well worth a try, and the beer itself is a very interesting idea. It just doesn't hit me right."
"Drinkabilty - Well, i must say this was alot better then i figured. Its different and fun to drink on occassion. High alcohol also wont let you drink too many. Would sample again in a few months. Would love to have some homemade authentic mead to match this up with."
"D: I think I let this age a little too long (about 2.5 weeks) and the alcohol is a little stronger than I remember, but even so, the beer holds up. But this beer is very drinkable for its 9% abv and is just fun to have. Once again DFH, an interesting concept leads to an interesting beer that's almost great."
"Notes [from the website]: ""This recipe is the actual oldest-known fermented beverage in the world! It is an ancient Turkish recipe using the original ingredients from the 2700 year old drinking vessels discovered in the tomb of King Midas."" That's pretty damn cool if you ask me."
"Conslusion: An interesting beer for sure, and not a bad one at that. I can find no fault except the higher ABV, but as this may be a bonus to some, I will not detract any points for it. I don't taste the other ingredients listed on the label, only honey. I do taste something else I think, but I can't put a finger on it. Good job once again Dogfish Head..."
"Notes: I was very dissapointed in this beer. I wanted to try it and was VERY intrigued by it when I first read about it as I'm somewhat of a history nerd. I was expecting a crazy array of flavors but find it difficult to believe all the work that went into this."
"D - An interesting beer that is nice enough but wouldn't drink more than one."
"A huge applause for the work that dogfish put into this. You can tell from the start they really worked hard to make this stuff. Sadly it's just not for me."
"This is absolutely an adventure in beer and well worth the above-standard price. A 4 pack cost me $12 in houston. This is a good blend of beer meets mead. Strong honey notes and very noticeable saffron presence. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Makes me want to put it in a wine glass and enjoy it slowly one sip at a time. Great occasional treat. I'll be buying more of this for sure."
"All of these flavors are present in almost equal amounts. With each sip you can detect one and then the other. By the time you see how many you can detect the beer is gone."
"Well they say its hard to go backwards, this must be why. For those reading drink this FIRST then find the Theobroma. this is delicious. However, to from the aztec treat to this is a small but noticeable step down. these are both beers that the public deserves on a regular basis. i just got spoiled by being able to drink the Theobroma first."
"I respect this for what it is. DFH, all around, for what they do, is my favorite brewery, but I just did not like this offering at all."
"a very interesting brew. supposed to be the oldest known recipe for an alcoholic beverage which adds to the appeal. A dark get complex brew with hints of grapes honey and other unknown spices, also very strong in alcohol but with only a mild pleasant alcoholic bite."
"Clear and gold and sporting a respectable white head that diminishes quickly and leaves some thin streaks of lace behind. Smells of honey, grain and straw, and by the look and aroma it wouldn't be a stretch to think this was a adjunct lager. Still have a ways to go before we make any final judgments, so I'm keeping an open mind. Tastes sweet and spicy, and any preconceptions are tossed out the door. Another sip reveals some well-blended light fruits and a big alcohol heat. Goes down a bit creamy with a medium to heavy mouth-feel. Was skeptical of this one at first, but a damn fine brew for something different."
"D - I have and could drink several of these, the only problem is the price tag!"
"D- This was a good beer and an interesting experiement, but it's just a bit too ""out there"" to be a regular. Definitely a recommend for a one time purchase."
"It's an interesting beer. Fun to drink simply because of how different it is. But the more I drink it, the less I like it. I started to grimace. The booziness mixed with the strange earthy/yeasty/grape taste just wasn't pleasing. I'll have to pass."
"The pour revealed a clear golden color with a nice head and some lacing that remains on my Duvel chalice. The beer looked thick on the pour and has some apparent viscosity. The nose smells of grapes, honey and spice. The taste is full of grapes and honey, spice from the spice added(hard to pinpoint) and some peppery notes from the yeast; with honey being the main player in the beer. The honey and grapes engage the palate leading into the spices and pepper like notes, the finish is a very reminiscent of honey. The carbonation levels are good. Overall, I really enjoy this beer and think this is one of DFH better offerings."
"I mean, the one bottle was drinkable, but I wouldn't have more than one in a night. Cool beer though."
"Mostly a long malty finish with a bit of peach taste underneath it all. Kinda tripel-ish minus the dark fruits, but still fruity plus honey minus fizzy carbonation. Very sweet and high ABV maybe limits the drinkability on this one. Still quite a nice brew and pleasant enough."
"Overall a tasty diversion but barely worth the price and probably not worth having again."
"This beer poured with a pretty crappy head that dies quickly and there wasn't that much carbonation either. The smell is of faint honey. They honey flavout comes through immediately and even as the aftertaste becomes slightly bitter, there is still honey. There is also a slightly sour taste in there too. Is that the grape skin or the alcohol? Anyway, I like this"
"I left the unfinished bottle by bedside in a 60 degree room over night and picked it up again in the morning to find that the grape did mellow out and after a bit of oxidation it was a bit more enjoyable, and drinkable. I don't think I'll go after this again too soon."
"I had high hopes for this for some reason. I got about 6oz in before a drainpour which I rarely do. I can't understand how anyone could enjoy this."
"This is definitely a different beer, but that is what we have come to love from DFH. The alcohol is definitely apparent in the taste, but not overbearing. The same goes for it being sweet, they include honey in the recipe so of course its going to be sweet but it's not too sweet like many other beers. Definitely would recommend this beer to anyone who is looking for an easy to drink sipper."
"Pretty good. It's a sipper."
"D: The alcohol strength makes this beer a sipper and since it's not that well hidden, the drinkability is hurt a bit--but it's a damn good and slightly odd brew"
"D: Midas touch occupies a space that straddles beer, mead and wine, and this is a great alternative beverage if you're accustomed to drinking those three and want a change. Not something I'd drink on a regular basis, but it's mighty tasty. An excellent choice for your next viking funeral or D&D match!"
"Crisp and dry with lingering bitterness and booze. As it gets warmer, the booze makes it almost wretched. Just not a good beer IMO. It's not gold, Jerry, not gold at all."
"For me, I always find this one to be a treat - but in small doses. The wife is a big fan, and will definitely be drinking this one again."
"I had some trepidation going into this one, but I'm very happy with the outcome. Can't wait to try this again."
"Thick in the body with a slight syrupy feeling. Alcohol is very well hidden, so it goes down easy, but the syrupy character eludes that this is a sipper. It will be a little sweet for some but overall, it's a good beer and definitely worth a try!"
"D - Interesting...I was expecting a beer but this is Dogfish Head we're talking about...this elixir was almost cider or mead like...if I wanted a beer I wouldn't go to this but if I wanted something different and wine like I'd go for this"
"D: I'm not sure I'd have more than one of these with some food. It's quite sweet and that doesn't really appeal to me as something I'd session. It's a fun beer for sure, perhaps a good one to bring to dinner for something different than wine. I enjoy something completely different from time to time and I think this beer would work."
"D. I like and respect Dogfish Head, but this beer is just not my cup of tea. I understand the idea and the principle of this. However I will take modern recipes over this one any day of the week."
"M&D-medium to light body very crisp and easy to drink"
"Overall- The story behind this beer is very unique and so is the taste. Probably one of the most unique alcoholic beverages you can find. It defies classification and is a smooth drink. For me, this is every once in a while beer. The taste though unique and worth trying isn't beery enough for me and the cost of this beer deters me from purchasing more than a 4-pack once a year."
"Pours a honey tinted golden orange color with a thin netting of head sitting above. Ice wine like in the nose, sweetness with depth. Golden raison and honey with a delicate sweetness and a calm alcohol note at the very end that dries out the sip just enough. Awesome what this beer has turned into.."
"D: A smooth 9% indeed, very wine like in taste but overall a good beer that you won't come by to often, grab a glass and give it a try."
"Cracked open a bottle dated from September of '09 and poured it into a New Belgium snifter. It poured a light amber with good clarity. It featured a quarter inch cream colored head which sat on top of the brew. The smell was very boozy. It almost smelled like wine so I guess that's where the muscat grapes come in. The taste was like a combination of a light, light Belgian mixed with a light white wine. It had good, sweet flavor with a little alcohol on the backend. It drank very smoothly and was pretty light bodied. I really like the Midas Touch. It's definitely worth trying, especially when you add in how unique it is."
"D - Sold in a four-pak, and about two bottles of these are about all I would want to consume, especially at 9.0ABV. Pairs well with food, especially grilled foods and pizza. Very enjoyable brew, made more so by enjoying with a friend at the brewpub!"
"drinkability: Not bad for how strong it is. Much more than a 6-pack may be a little much."
"D - Poor. Bad aftertaste and too carbonated."
"This is a worthwhile rbew to try. Go ahead and step into the past."
"D- Disclaimer - I love mead (honey wine). This beer taste like mead with floral notes. It's very drinkable and quite pleasant. However, if you don't like the taste of honey, you may not like this beer."
"Drinkability - this really assumes the role of a fortified wine or desert wine. Its definitely for sipping. Very sweet, fruity, and well spiced. Worth a try, a very unusual beer."
"12 oz. poured into my Stone I.R.S. tulip. Pours golden-copper with a small, fizzy head. Honey, sweet grapes, orange, and lemon fill my nose. The tastr is in segments: honey first, then sweet moscato wine, and hoppy bitterness to finish. It leaves the lips and glass sticky. Magnificently original."
"D: Not hard to drink but probably one and done because of the strong wine-like sweetness; not for everyone and I'm not a big-wine drinker."
"Overall impression: rich, crisp and unique with high alcohol. very drinkable."
"D- Very interesting beer and it is refreshing, but the alcohol and the grape sweetness do catch up in the long run."
"D - I love this and it does not leave a bad flavor in my mouth. I could have a lot"
"(Also, I have never had this beer in its fresher state for a new vs. aged comparison. Therefore, my review may greatly differ from a newer dated botle.)"
"D- real easy to drink and real easy to kick your ass. Tastes like a saison on steroids. I like it a lot but the expense makes it a rare buy."
"For me it is very important to have this beer fresh, because as with most spiced or fruity beers, the defining flavors fade over time and it becomes either bland or nasty. The grapes really come through so well in this beer, I think a lot of folks are turned off by the fact that this isn't balanced by sourness, like in a lambic, but I really dig it. Not a beer for all occasions, but definitely unique and well crafted."
"Drinkability: well, it is tasty, but more of a small-quantity drink for me. I will note that the alcohol is entirely masked in the flavor, but the warmth and strength really start to hit me as I pass the half-way mark. Not bad; I think I would enjoy this beer again in a few months or a year: it's tasty, but not an everyday brew."
"D-Interesting brew, but not my cup of tea....glad I tried it though."
"It taste full of mealy sweetness, a slightly bitter fruitness comes through at the end of a sip, then the spicey sweetness lingers luring one back. The fruits that come through are green melon and white grape."
"Drinkability is somewhat limited due to sweetness and alcohol is pretty apparent in this one. An interesting beer."
"All in all, man, this one is only ok. Not much to make this brew good or great. Don't hunt and don't bother..."
"D: Not for everyone. My parents hated it. Unique and worth a try."
"D: It's a little heavy to finish more than a single 12oz bottle in one sitting, but it's pretty solid. I enjoyed it."
"Carbonation is quite high. Mouthfeel is very slick. Very noticeable astringency."
"This is a good change up brew; nice flavors, nice drinkability. I am enjoying this one. Not sure I would want this all night though. A few of these to start off with would be very cool. And with the high alcohol level it would work pretty well. Good stuff."
"- Quite good, and better than I expected... though just a touch too sweet... would much prefer a dryer less sweet version of this... but overall it's a nice touch... the midas touch!"
"On it's own this beer doesn't have the greatest drinkability but I'm sure it would go great with the right food."
"Wow, quite the ride but definitely not a sessioner, old King Midas must've woke up with a bitching skull ache if he downed quarts of this."
"Drinks: unlike a beer. The spices and disparate flavors of Midas Touch blend well to create a drink that's altogether original and challenges the usual palate. Wouldn't be bad on a summer's day -- 4000 years ago."
"Major points for how unique it is.. what else would you expect fropm DFH? Recommended to anyone who loves grapes and a solid beer."
"2/26/11 Edit: Gave this one another try and my palate definitely despised some flavor in the taste that sealed the deal between me and this beer ever again in the future."
"D- it's easy to drink but it's overly sweet, i think more than one of these would probably upset my stomach"
"Bright, translucent golden body topped with fizzy, white head that decorates the sides of my glass with a little lacing. Aroma filled with spices, floral notes, ginger, light fruits (kiwi), and alcohol. Boozy citrus mixes with lemon, kiwi, spices, sour notes, honey, and then just for a brief moment: barley, grains, some hop flavor. Fizzy in mouthfeel with a tickling carbonation and light body. A strange, boozy spiced brew that I would find hard to crave again."
"Like a trippel with some honey and clover sweetness. Pretty enjoyable beer. Would definitely have again but too strong to drink a lot of."
"Notes: Eh, don't think I'll revisit this one. Tastes like a glorified macro. I am usually able to accept the concoctions that DFH produces, but this one was a ""miss"" in my book"
"Beer is medium bodied with little in the front palate but some OK sweetness at the back. Finishes with a mild bitterness that is OK. Overall the beer is pretty drinkable but its not my favorite beer from DFH. Its worth the novelty but its just OK."
"Drinkability: Too sweet to drink en masse; It pairs well enough with kettle korn, however"
"M, D- A viscous, sweet mouthfeel tends to slow the pace of drinking."
"D. Great. I've recently had a lot of honey inspired beverages that I've quite enjoyed: sahtis, meads, and now this. I'll have to see if there are any other styles of beer that heavily rely on the influence of honey."
"Like drinking an extremely full-flavored champagne or white wine. Very enjoyable and creative offering, though I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting."
"purchased as a 12 oz bottle in SF CA. Beer pours a seriously dark golden honey color and has little head to speak of. Very little carbonation on this one. Smell is of white grapes and a funky malt and honey scent, a little off in my opinion.Taste is alcohol up front with a big sweetness at the finish. In between is hard to describe but its a bit sour and funky. Mouth feel on this beer is quite nice, its smooth and easy going. The drink ability is quite high for such a strong beer, hardly notice that its 9 percent. A good beer for fans of the unusual."
"I got a small draft of Midas Touch at a great price during happy hour. I'm not sure that I would pay full-price for it however, which is probably evidenced by the fact that I have never picked up a bottle before. With that said, I liked this beer and wouldn't hesitate to suggest that someone try it."
"D- I did find this to be an enjoyable beer. Not too malty or hoppy, infact the additional fermentables that give it a champagne/wine flavor and burn are what won my girlfriend over for this beer. So I suggest this for those looking for a good beer to try, that are not looking for your typical super hopped or complex malty american beer."
"The last of DfH's 'Ancient Ales' that I've tried, and I'd say it's the best for sure."
"For me, this is kind of tough to put more than one down. The booze is very up front. I can appreciate what they are doing historically with this beer, but very much a sipper."
"Overall: Overall I thought the beer was pretty good. I liked the honey taste to it, but the flavor was a little imbalanced. The beer is drinkable, but I wouldn't have too many of these in one night. I'd recommend this for someone to taste because of the honey goodness, but overall, I guess I was expecting a little more from Dogfish. All in all though, I did enjoy the beer."
"Sorry for the lacking description, its just hard to put into words what I drank with this one."
"Hmm, not sure if I'd want another one of these. This is definitely a unique experience and I give kudos to Sam and the guys and gals at DFH for attempting this historic brew. Now when are they releasing Theobroma this year?!"
"D: The alcohol is well hidden but the beer is definitely needs to be sipped given the amount of sweetness."
"I definitely appreciate what DFH is doing by recreating recipes from olden times but this one is not overly impressive. It's not bad but it's seriously sweet and not overly complex."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Poured a golden yellow with minimal white head. There was no evident lacing throughout. The aroma consisted of a light malt hint. The taste was sweet that was light on the palate and low in carbonation. Overall this was a nice refreshing beer that was nice. Not great, but not bad. It actually reminded me of a Chimay to be honest... Take that as you will."
"I love the history of this beer and was glad to try it. I will revisit this one when given the chance."
"Pours golden with a slight head. Aroma is sweet and malty, like a kolsch. The flavor is like an extreme kolsch, with honey and grape and a wheaty grain. It's heavy and a little cloying. The mouthfeel is thick and unpleasant."
"Drinking this beer makes me finally understand why Dogfish Head so frequently polarises people. I appreciate their passion and their esoteric love of all the wonders of beer, but uniqueness doesn't make this a great beer, or even a good beer. God bless them, but frankly if I were given the choice between this and a Corona... well, hmmm... It might make me think about the choice, let's just say that."
"D: Disguises the abv pretty well and one of those sweet drinks that you want to drink pretty fast."
"I can't say I'm a big fan of this. The wine notes are prominent, but there's not a huge amount of interest otherwise, and it feels as though it is far too alcoholic. An interesting experiment perhaps from Dogfish Head, but not one that I'd care to experiment with again."
"D: Ehh, alright fresh, but it should age better than this."
"Overall I enjoyed it, and will order it at least one more time."
"not bad, I can see a ancient heritage in this beer...."
"Overall and interesting beer. Not my favorite, but I'd have it again."
"D- A bit of a sipper with the alcohol. This is definitely worth trying."
"Overall, This one has way too many white wine like qualities for me to enjoy. Alot of yeast and alot of grapes. Can't say it was what I expected, or that I'm enjoying it much. Maybe someone who appreciates beer AND wine could get into this. Buzz is still good though, and I can't complain about that."
"A fine and interesting brew marred by some little problems."
"Dogfish Head Midas touch poured a darker golden color, with a good size head. It smelt sweet, and hoppy. It tasted very smooth, at first had a sweetness to it, and then a very smooth aftertaste. IT was rich but easy to drink. A very unquie beer that is worth giving a try."
"Drinkability: I'm not a wine drinker, but you could probably pair this with anything you would pair with white wine. It'd be interesting to cook with for sure. A very drinkable brew in my opinion, but you probably won't be slugging one after another. Sip and savor this one, it grows on you. Try this one out if you get the chance."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: Well this is a bit different, but still pretty good. I really would find it hard putting down more than one or two of these. It does match up nicely with something fairly flavorful."
"D - moderately drinkable - not one I'd have by itself again, but would be well suited to have with food. Very complex."
"D - I am glad I tried this one. The back story about its ancient roots is pretty cool. However, I wouldn't get this one again. The whole time I was drinking it all I could think of was how wine like this seems to me."
"D: Drinkable, in a weird way. This is one of those beers that's good to try out, but not one to come back to."
"D- This is a great dinner beer. It is different than most beer but goes down very easy for 9% ABV, which is nearly impossible to taste. This is a beer that I buy one four pack at a time but always it stocked."
"D- I guess even DFH can have some brews I don't enjoy. I did like the look in the glass though. This is not for me... I'm sure that some will disagree with me"
"Nuff said!"
"A solid beer, but not spectacular."
"Overall, very good brew."
"I enjoyed this a lot."
"Drinkability - Alcohol is very well hidden, so it goes down easy. It's a little sweet for my tastes, but I'm definitely happy I picked it up. Overall, I'd say it's a good beer and definitely worth a try!"
"After seeing the story behind the making of this beer on TV, I knew that I had to give it a try. While that's what made me want to try this particular brew, my decision to actually do so was more a factor of Dogfish Head's quality. This beer is definately unique, and I suppose that it's an accurate recreation of what some of the first beers were like. While it's a little sweet for my liking, it's still quite good and definately worth a try even though it lacks the balance which is found in most decent modern craft beers. It's definately a ""special"" specialty beer, if you get my drift."
"D- I refuse to believe this is 9%. I don't taste much alcohol at all. This is a perfect gateway beer for a non-craft drinker. And its not bad for the craft drinker either!"
"D - If it wasn't for the spice in the beer I would like this a a lot more, I give DFH props for their experimentation though."
"D - This one could be fairly drinkable for the right person. If you know someone who loves white wines and you want to introduce them into the world of craft brewing, this might be a start. As for me, I am not a huge white wine fan, so this one just didn't do it for me."
"D: strange flavor make for an interesting drink, yet is easy to put away."
"Drinkability- It's certainly isn't sessionable, but it's not a bad drinker."
"D-very smooth and sweet, I understand how some people wouldn't like it, but it is a very interesting beer and even more so when you consider the recipe is was based on"
"D: Can only drink once a year of so. This one is a real sipper!"
"D- A decent beer. These ancient brews arent my favorite thing but they are always worth a try."
"D: This brew actually doesn't gain character as it sits in your glass. Its best quaffed quickly. The story behind the beer is better than the brew."
"Overall way too much like wine/champagne for me. I prefer medium to full body ales."
"Very drinkable beer for 9%. I highly recommend this."
"D - Sweet beers are hard for me to do unless they are hoppy or tart. Good taste makes it averagely drinkable, but couldn't do tons."
"D - I think this is very drinkable. Its 9%ABV may argue, but I don't feel an overwhelming alcohol flavor. I want to drink at least one more to discover more subtle flavor nuances, and feel I'll have no problem doing so. And, its ""fruity"" enough that my wife likes it and thinks its ""yummy""...we'll see how she feels after a couple."
"D: Decent drinkability, but not a session, but a sipper. This is not only because of the alcohol content, but because the taste and more specifically the finish of the brew, is somewhat odd and might become tiresome after two of these. This is one and done for me for now. But I'd have it again when I want something different."
"D this is a very smooth, very drinkable beer, I would be quite happy to sip a couple of these over the course of an evening"
"Mouthfeel is medium, drinkability is good"
"I've been waiting to try this for a long time. It has the color and aroma of a standard American Lager. That supprised me a bit. It poured clear with a small head and medium carbonation. I don't quite know how to explain the taste. It seems bitter at first but then changes to a heavy almost stale flavor. I had two and the second one was more palitable than the first. Maybe it is the high alcohol content that gives it the most overpowering flavor. Sort of like an Imperial Stout in that manor."
"Notes: Really interesting concept and a unique tasting beer. More like a mead/wine hybrid, more wine than mead. It's a beer that one has satisfied me for a while, but at sometime I may crave it, and there is nothing really quite like it. Good, but not amazing, tasting beer with a great story behind it, and a uniqueness."
"A nice tarnished golden color embodies the name for this one. A very subtle aroma lends itself to a very crisp initial taste. Reminiscent of mead or (I really hate to compare it to) a cider without the sugary mouthfeel, Midas finishes more like a Riesling. Definitely a beer to be paired with food and will win over any wine drinker."
"Dogfish Head Midas Touch pours a very slightly hazy gold with a moderate head. The aroma is sharp and slightly vinous with a bit of harsh phenolic character. The flavor is very lightly malty. It's sweet, but not cloying. The phenolic quality is there, but much milder than the aroma indicated. There is more on the vinous character, but I wouldn't have guessed it was actually from grapes. There is a slight bitterness to be found if you look for it, but I think it's just enough to balance the sweetness. There is some wine like fruitiness that leads into some soft, fragrant honey. This is an interesting and complex beer, but not necessarily something I would drink often."
"D- Really an interesting brew; one that I have been hesitant to try, but I'm really shocked at how much I enjoyed it."
"D: another interesting and unique concoction from DFH. I wouldn't say it is as successful as some of their other ventures, but it is worth a try"
"Drinkability- Easy to drink and enjoy, no alcohol flavor, slightly more carbonation would have been preferred but I will definitely have another :)"
"Poured clear golden honey with a thin white head. Lots of honey and white wine aromas, similar taste but a hint of herbal aftertaste. Alcohol warmth in the finish. Thin bodied and bubbly carbonation. All in all, a decent beer but I'm not crazy about it."
"Pours a golden honey amber with a small bit of white foamy head that doesn't lace too much at all. The smell is overwhelmingly in fsvor of honey and white grapes, though not overly sweet. A modicum of floweriness also comes through, but only as background radiation. The taste follows, with the honey and grapes once again taking a preeminent role, and just as in the smell the sweetness is nicely toned down. The flowers from the smell are replaced by an equally mild bit of hoppy bitterness, creating a nicely balanced flavor. The body is nicely moderate and very smooth, lending this brew a high level of drinkability, though the ABV may try to say otherwise."
"The feel wasn't very dry until the finish, which was once again wine-like and begged for another sip. The drinkability was excellent. Good beer."
"D- I couldn't drink a bunch but for a sharing occation with my brother I'd do it again. Different and unique beer worth a try now and again."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Well crafted and interesting, but not something that I would buy all of the time."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied. Crisp carbonation. An interesting beer but a little too sweet for me to call it very drinkable."
"Dogfish Head has created a masterpiece with this one. An all around beauty."
"Medium carbonation is good, but I wouldn't have more than one of these. The alcohol flavor stumbles through a little too much."
"My advise: if you're into the extreme, this is definitely a beer for you. If you're skiddish, I may suggest some easier brews."
"D - As I have heard before, this particular beer was brewed in the style of ancient beers. It has a very interesting and unique flavor which almost takes you back in time. Nice body and mouthfeel. It takes a few drinks to really get into this one, but after that, this beer is highly drinkable and very enjoyable. I have to say I havent experienced a beer quite like this before. Great job Dogfish Head!!!"
"I highly recommend giving this a try."
"Overall: really interesting brew, very well crafted. This is so odd and so good that there's definitely some talent and hard work behind it."
"Dogfish Head always seems to provide me with a beer to ponder over. Interesting concept, sort of an amalgamation of all beer/wine/mead. It works pretty well I'd say. I like it better than I thought I would. The only thing holding it back is the finish, which seems a bit dry and hot to me. I may find myself coming back to this beer every few months for a change of pace."
"D: Fun to drink, especially with the historical nature of the beer recipe, etc. The sweetness gets a little overpowering - and I enjoy sweet beer. Although its not the ""best"" beer I've ever had, definitely worth it for the novelty and a great conversation starter if shared with friends."
"Plentiful carbonation, thick and slightly tart."
"Slightly tart medium body with plenty of light crisp fruit, especially apple, grape, fig and dark berries. Slight zesty peppery spice with a touch of molasses and honey. Creamy texture with a good amount of sweet alcohol and a dry tart finish."
"Side Notes: This is definitely not one of DFH's best in my opinion. I'm a big fan of their IPAs but its beers like this that let me down."
"I've had this beer many times and just got around to reviewing."
"The saffron added flavor but not color, surprisingly, and the balance of flavors was nice. Quite an interesting taste, actually. If only it were gold colored."
"I believe this would be a great transition beer for that wine loving friend you may have."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. You'd never know how strong it is from the taste. Goes down easy. Overall, however, the aroma is much more interesting than the flavor for me. This is a good beer from one of my favorite breweries, but not their best."
"An interesting brew, not exactly my cup of tea, but a beer I've been wanting to try for some time."
"Overall, an interesting brew. Hard to classify. Definitely worth a try."
"This is a terrific pairing beer as it can play well with so many foods, from salads thru desserts."
"Is it beer, wine, or mead? After drinking the entire bottle I would have a hard time picking out many beer components. Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that had good retention. The head settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is dominated by the muscat grapes and honey that has been fermented into mead. Smells like a combination of muscatel and mead. A little research results that such a concoction does exist, it is called Muscadore. The aroma is so strong there is no sign of the 9% ABV. The flavor also results in strong grape flavors. The honey does not play as large a role but it still gives some mead-like qualities. The body brings some beer qualities back. It is medium bodied with enough carbonation to keep the beer from being slick or sticky. An interesting ""beer experiment"" that is worth trying or surprising guests with. Not something I would consider drinking on a regular basis."
"I had out of a 12 ounce bottle. This is one of the most unique tasting beers I've ever had...but I'm not a fan. It's very acidic. The grapes (Which seem to give it a very strong scent) come through. Kind of burns the back of the mouth. Quality, but not for me."
"I wouldn't quite call it gold, but it is one of my favorite spiced beers. Works very well as a pairing, so-so on its own."
"Bottle. Clear golden yellow body. Looks a lot like a typical BMC offering with a thing white head. Aroma is sweet with a lot of grape and alcohol smell. Smells very fruity. Taste follows the aroma with a lot of white grape and is still kind of boozy. Very good though with a small tart bite. Body is light to medium. Kind of a dry beer."
"Pours a nice orangish color with a one finger white pillowy head that stays around with minimal lacing. The aroma is of barley and grapes with a sweetness as well. The aroma is faint. The taste is of sweet malt with barley and grape overtones. The taste is very complex. The mouthfeel is very dry and moderately carbonated. The mouthfeel is like champagne. Overall this is a very solid and drinkable beer. The taste and aroma are complex and leave you wanting more. The alcohol is very well masked."
"12 fl. oz bottled on 09/15/09. My first beer sampled on January 1, 2010. Hopefully this is a sign of good beers to come. It pours a copper color very much like a freshly minted penny with a thin but persistent off-white head. The aroma comes across as subtle and mild with a bit of barley, malts, and grapes. The taste is more conspicuous with a powerful balance of sweet honey, spices, and a biscuit-like under tone. It ends a tad dry. This was very likeable."
"D: Incredibly high. Cannot believe this beer is 9%. Can finish off a four pack easily."
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"There is only a slight hotness on the aftertaste. The brisk carbonation keeps this from becoming a syrup-y affair. The high ABV makes this a good sipping beer."
"Had a second bottle at a different date, and completely reviewed my score. Had this one on it's own, not while trying a bunch of beers. Much better, much more interesting beer this way. This one might be good paired with spicy, savory foods?"
"Excellent aroma of spices. Nice golden color. Excellent overall taste of spices and some herbiness, not quite sure exactly what herbs though. A little alcohol on the finish, but not objectionable and not indicative of the 9% ABV. This one could easily sneak up on you. Has a somewhat traditional and pleasing Belgian taste to it. Overall, one of the better Dogfish Head's I've had, other than their IPA's."
"D: Easy to drink but not as nostalgic as the concept."
"this beer is extremely drinkable for 9% and while it is not my favorite type of beer i would definitely consider drinking it again."
"D: This one just begs to be sipped for me....the slight booziness and carbonation make you slow down and enjoy. Very nice overall."
"Interesting...yes, but the level of desire for this on a repeat basis would be limited. I am shocked at how hot this beer tastes for a 9%. It doesn't hide the alcohol well, and the flavor just reminds me of sipping on a good riesling."
"Poured into a shaker pint. I was amazed at the golden color and thought how aptly it was named. Nice head to start and minimal lacing. This is one of the most aromatic beers I ever smelled. This was almost like drinking carbonated wine. Very high grape flavor but sweetness of honey come through. I doubt too many of these could be drank at one sitting but this was a great experiance for the palette. I love that DFH does this."
"I enjoyed trying this one but it isn't something I will seek out on a regular basis. It's something different and worth trying though for sure."
"D - Quite a nice beer. I haven't had one of these since much earlier in my Beer Geek career and I was not expecting it to have held up to my fond memories, but if anything I enjoy it more now than I did then. The honey character is fantastic and combined with the herbal hops and spices it is pleasantly reminiscent of a good pilsner. The flavors are much less subtle than those of a fine German lager, but they are eerily similar and tickle a lot of the same parts of the palate. I also appreciate that despite its powerfully sweet finish it manages to avoid becoming cloying (at least for one bottle). I wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting, but it is a very nice beer and I am glad I revisited it."
"Overall Impressions: Drinks like a light bodied beer, but with a lot of flavor. Seemingly a direct midpoint between beer and champagne. Very pleased to have tried and quite different than anything I have tasted to date (that I can recall)."
"Pours a very light light and clear orangish-straw color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is of strong fruit notes - primarily grapes, as well as hints of citrus and honey. Taste is dominated by the sweetness of grapes and honey, but balanced by bitter malts. Finishes very nicely."
"Poured unhurriedly into a scored goblet, a thin, sudsy head forms, not sticky. Color is an orangish gold. Aroma is underwhelming for what is advertised, maybe some honey. Flavor is mostly clean maltiness with a grape dryness on the finish, but not drying like a saison. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and clingy. Overall, disappointed, will pull the bottle just placed in my aging cupboard back in the refrigerator and share it with an acquaintance."
"Really, really liked this. A lot of fun, kudos to Dogfish Head for creating this."
"This is now my new favorite beer. It pours a really deep gold color. Not alot of carbonation. It's all in the taste. This is a novelty beer, but it does it very well. At first, you get an intense muscat grape flavor; which I personally enjoy. After a few seconds, you get a spice kick with the saffron. It's almost like a wasabi effect; a rush of spiciness for a few seconds, then gone. After a few seconds of spiciness, it fades back into a subtle muscat grape. Very complex."
"overall a good beer, don't think you want to drink a bunch in a row but great as an occasional treat"
"Leans more towards wine but this is a treat. I would expect nothing less from Sam and Dogfish head."
"This is one of the most unique beers I've ever had. It contains many taste elements that you would expect to find in a wine, but it's still unmistakably a beer. Very interesting all around, and a great beer, but it'd be tough to have too many of these in a row because of the sweetness and high ABV."
"Drinkability - at 9%ABV it's not something I could find myself drinking a lot of, and since the flavor isn't growing on me I think this is one of those experience beers. You have it once because it's interesting, but not because it's outstanding and everyone says you should try it. Still, no regrets - I'm glad I tried it but I can't see myself getting it again."
"D- subtle nuances captivate me as i drink, as if forever chasing that fleeting bit of fresh grape that briefly visits my taste buds. the rest of it seems only to work in conjunction with that moment. not necessarily a wine lover, but in a grain based beverage it is a welcome treat. though there's some alcohol smell and flavor, in the overall experience it isn't all that noticeable, and this golden elixir disappears quickly. as with many big beers i've had lately this one is used for enjoyment and not thirst, but a second wouldn't be out of the question. and for the herbed beer category, this is definitely a good one from america."
"Poured golden with a thin white head that left no lacing. Aromas were fruity with a mild herbal hop aroma; also somewhat funky. Tastes of sweet apple and grape cover the palate with fruity notes of apricot and peach as well. Herbal hops with spice provide some balance to the malty sweetness. Finishes with a prickle of white pepper on the tongue. Mouth-feel was thin with moderate carbonation. At first I didn't like this at all, but also didn't know what it was. As I became accustomed to the odd flavors, I seemed to enjoy it more. The ABV surprised me as it is noticeable, but also well concealed."
"The carbonation is high and there is a bit of a syrupy consistency in the finish. It's fairly drinkable."
"D - I kind of expected that I wouldn't like this, but I was pleasantly surprised. Different for sure, but highly recommended."
"Overall, I doubt I'll be getting this one again. Its a good beer and I think everyone should try it (it'd especially make a good beer for those who like wine). Its interesting just to try something that people drank thousands of years ago to get in touch with your humanity."
"D) Not very good. I didn't really enjoy this, although the idea and theory of the beer is interesting. The taste was okay, but the alcohol was too present. Not my cup of tea or beer. But props to DFH for doin something else unique."
"Not your everyday beer, but worth a try."
"Mouthfeel slight bitter with a harshness that hopefully will receed with a bit of cellaring. Drinkability is low due to the harshness of the flavours."
"Perhaps women do have more of a refined palate..."
"D: Interesting, well made, but not one I could drink all night. Try it out for yourself. An interesting ""Specialty"" beer."
"salud!"
"Overall this is certainly a distinguised beer however I'm not sure if a general beer drinker had this they would identify it as beer as much as they would carbonated mead. Worth a shot for the novelty."
"Drinkability- ok I would probably drink it again but I think they have done better with other beers though."
"D- Did not enjoy this one very much. A little too medicinal for me."
"Not my kind of beer. It's not drinkable beer. I have hard time to finish the bottle. there is something that holds me back. i don't know even what is that. simply it's not smooth. I had enough of this beer. i don't think I'll order it again. good job Nina!!!!"
"Drinkability- Great, Good beer with a different taste."
"D: Midas Touch is a nice break from the norm. one or two of these at a time is about it though. great beer to bring to a dinner party- at the very least it's a pretty good conversation piece."
"Pours a brilliant gold with an average head and minimal spotty lacing. Nose is interesting - kind of a green grape scent with honey. To be honest, my first instinct was that it smells like wet hair in a barber shop. Taste, fortunately is nothing at all like wet hair - spicy, sweet and hints of honey. Medium bodied and a bit too much carbonation. Alcohol leaves a noticeable burn. Driankability is decent - a sipper. Good beer, but kind of a disappointment."
"D: I can't say I didn't like it, and it was great to try it... but this isn't something I'd want to drink all the time. Definitely something cool to bring out for others to try."
"drinkability - There is definitely a right place and time for this brew. However, this is a fantastic beer with a great story and a uniqueness that cannot be matched. I waited 2 years to try this beer...a mistake that I won't make again."
"The beer is surprisingly not that hard to drink, considering the high alcohol content. It is enjoyable and refreshing. Dogfish head continues to live up to its slogan as the most creative brewery."
"Pours a light, clear amber, with little head and a little lacing. Smells like I don't know? Dried apricots, malty, earthy, alcohol, and kind of grape? Very hard to place I thought. Tastes sweet, can taste the alcohol, can taste the grape influence at the end of the sip. Beer was pretty smooth, lots of carbonation and a pleasant mouthfeel."
"glassware: tulip"
"Pour me another! I'll be returning to Midas Touch pretty soon."
"Overall, a good and interesting beer that I'll have again, but I'm not sure it'll go into the regular rotation. Worth trying."
"Pours a slightly hazy, light gold, similar to a Belgian pale. Aroma is reminiscent of white wine, very strong grape character with plenty of alcohol and a mildly peppery spice. Tastes at first of bushels of sweet malt, with a quick detour into boozy spice before resolving into grape and honey sweetness, and a warming finish. Mouthfeel is outstanding, slick and effervescent. Between the complexity and the ABV, it's hard to drink more than a couple, but the first one or two are very good."
"D: This is a sipper. It has good complexity and it is very original but not my favorite from Dogfish Head. It is strong so one or two bottles is enough."
"Drinkability: This is where I have to take this beer down a notch. Since it tastes and feels much like champagne, it's too sweet for me to have more than one in a sitting. Plus, the high alcohol content doesn't help either. It is very good though, and could enjoy this from time to time."
"What can I say I enjoyed this beer, different but good"
"Poured into a glass. One finger head. Great lacing, beautiful to look at. The smell is very nice, notes of spices with a good hint of honey grape and barley. Very nice tast a again, I'd say the grape is easiest to taste, but not too strong by any means. Nice notes of the honey as well. Slight alcohol when its going down, but nothing too strong. I enjoy this beer a lot, get it semi regularly even though its 13.50 a 4 pack. Definitely recommend it."
"overall, personally, the beer is okay with a star rating of i give a tiny shit in the scale of ""who gives a shit to i give a total effing shit repository."""
"Drinkability: This is a super interesting beer, because its so sweet, and because it has a relatively high alcohol content I really wouldn't be drinking more than a glass or so."
"Overall, it is a unique beer and at 9%, I don't think I will have a problem finishing the bottle. It is filling, but the uniqueness keeps it going for me. Worth a try, in my opinion."
"A wonderful beer that gave me something to talk about when I have nothing else to say."
"Drinkability: At this ABV this is a one a night beer which I'm enjoying sampling but I'm not at all sure how often I'll return to this one. I definitely would not want more than one a night, even with a lower ABV. I'm really on the fence here, I expect I'll try this one again but have no desire to pop open another."
"M-D: This is a beer that all the flavors just explode once you have taken a sip. Decent beer to drink, will definitely be purchasing another!"
"Reviewed on: 09-22-2009 02:12:02"
"This beer pours a clear golden-orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is honey, pears, pale malt, and flowers. There is a lot going on in this aroma with a lot of complexity. I really like the way this beer smells. The taste is just as bold as the aroma with lot of flavors all competing with each other. Again, I really like the way this beer tastes. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with effervescent carbonation. Overall, this beer really impresses me. I can't see myself drinking this all the time, but I could easily see myself pairing this with food often and successfully. Way to do DFH for recreating this fine beverage."
"Drinkability: Aside from the rareness of this beer it's moderately drinkable, the alcohol content is a little bit much for some I assume, but it's not too bad, I'd say it's worth it. It's an occasional, not really a session beer, it's a sipper."
"Overall: Another finely crafted brew that was worth imbibing to take in an ancient recipe. Would love to try again with a nice paired meal to see how the sweet honey and bits of saffron fare."
"a good ale to say the least,a unique blend that is drinkable but not to often .i'll get this again with some good food that pairs well."
"Drinkability - It's good, and makes for a nice meade-like alternative to beer occasionally. Given it's sweetness, I probably wouldn't do a session with this, but I could definitely see sipping on one from time to time."
"D- This is not really a beer for me at all. Way too dry. I really had to struggle to get through it with the alcohol presence and dryness."
"First thing that hit me was the honey, luckily the heavy carbonation makes it less sticky then one would expect, the aftertaste is a little winey, but not too strong. I am not sure what temperature to drink this on, when I poured it right out of the fridge it was too cold to get all the flavor but now that it has warmed up a bit it is getting stickier. Tricky, but it won't stop me from having more of this!"
"I was certainly surprised by this brew. Definitely one of the sweeter-smelling beers I've ever had, but the taste was a little too wine-like for me. Don't get me wrong, the sweetness was there, but so was that complex bouquet I wasn't expecting. I most certainly recommend sipping this beer over the course of a few hours."
"Poured a clear, golden yellow color with a touch of head that faded quickly. Smells a bit grapey/juicy, some wet hay and a sweet aroma. Woo - dis is a sweet beer. The front end features a lot of carbonation and a is really crisp. That fades to a sticky sweetness with some astringent and medicinal notes and then fades out with a slightly harsh, lingering finish. On the plus side, this beer does have good body. Another interesting beer from DFH, but no one I would try again."
"Golden amber color, almost no head, and no lace. Smells of grapes, honey, and saffron. Taste is the same as the smell, the alcohol comes through. Has a sweet flavor. Heavy carbonation, medium bodied, and easy to drink. Another solid offering from Dogfish Head."
"This beer is very drinkable, especially on a warm day. I have had this one before and will continue to treat myself to a bottle every now and then."
" I'll drink the other three for sure. It's good stuff but with so many other choices..."
"D - For me, I can see having at most, maybe two in a sitting. Like I said, not exactly my thing, but nice for a change."
"Notes: It's a rare and enjoyable brew. The story of the experiment and the history behind it make for great conversation and a nice brew to lighten up any table."
"Overall: wine drinkers would have not problem with this beer and I wish I would have cellared all of them."
"	 The result is a drink that never lapses into one dimension (the way mead does, as much as I like it) and yet also does not exhaust you with too much. There is a harmony of aroma, flavor and after-warmth that is quite pleasant; and in all of that the malt plays first violin. It does not stand out too obtrusively, but without it the rest of the experience would be flat, discordant or uninspiring."
"D: The only harsh characteristic of this odd beer is the mild overcarbonation, and for that I'd call it drinkable, especially considering the 9% ABV. There are many pleasant flavors here and probably more going on than my palate can cope with. An enigma. This would make a good alternative to white wine, even Champagne, and is probably best paired with food."
"D: Very flavorfull and unique beeer from DFH. Seems to have more in common with a white wine or champagne. Well crafted, but not something I could drink alot of."
"D: No thanks, this will be a workout to get through this one. Just tastes like a mess to me, too many flavors, and none of them that I even like. A beer that someone who enjoys champagne would probably like, but I don't, and those flavors really put me off on this one. The flavors just don't work well together, the grape and barley just don't blend it doesn't taste that great at all."
"D: I only had one, I could have had two, but I didn't think I wanted to go there. Not to say it's bad, it's unique for sure, but I never had that light go off in my head that said ""hey, I want more of this and I want it now!"""
"really smooth and crispy, not a big beer. the alcohol by volume throws it off somewhat. drinkable. overall a curious beer with above average success."
"On tap. Pours a clear gold with a somewhat creamy white head. Sweet, slightly vinous aroma with plenty of grainy malt. Some notes of honey. Tastes kind of bleh. The same honey-like, slightly fruity character is there, and not much else. Too sweet. Light-medium body. Surprisingly characterless."
"O- It's not too different of a beer. And its good. Interesting play on a sweet malty beer."
"D - ABV makes this one a sipper. Interesting brew; I like it, but there are other DFH offerings I prefer. I wouldn't have a problem drinking it periodically, though."
"This was an interesting one, but what did I expect from a recipe that is 2700 years old. King Midas approved and so do I."
"Notes: Again, DFH (along with Palo Santo Marron and I am sure others) defies categorization."
"Pours an interesting almost translucent golden. Decent little head on it, with a boozey whiff of something interesting - some sweet concoction, almost like a mead. This seems like it would be very well suited for a cold winter night - sweet, and alcoholic. As it warms, it melds quite nicely, even though it is still evident. Not the biggest mouthfeel considering, it slides off the tongue pretty well, but it is an interesting go at what it tries to be, some sort of sweetwine/mead hybrid."
"I always enjoy drinking this beer, but would never spoil the experience by having two consecutively. Not because of the relatively high ABV, but simply because I don't think I would enjoy the unique flavor of the Midas Touch tripping on its own heels. Plus, the romance of drinking a beer of ""antiquity"" would certainly diminish if it became too familiar. As a tale, the Midas Touch is cautionary; so don't be too greedy: Enjoy, but one at a time."
"Prost!"
"Interesting to try, but not great in my opinion."
"Overall, I am not sure what to think of this one. I'll break it down. One was enjoyable, I don't think I want another, some other time I would like one, just not right now. Take that for what you will."
"the mouthfeel is light medium bodied, with a pretty decent drinkability that might even have me going back to the fridge for another one."
"This lighter brownish copper color beer poured out with a copious amount of foam. Reducing to lighter amounts of lacing. The aroma of malts and hops with a hints of flower. The taste of the beer is a good balance of the malts and hops with the flower showing through and tones of the warmer aspects of the alcohol."
"Pours a clear gold with a fluffy white head. Smells sort of like a pilsner. Some sweet honey maltiness and a little bit of hop aroma. As the beer is swirled, a strong alcohol aroma comes off of the beer. There is a warm alcohol flavor up front that mellows out into a bready, sweet, honey-like flavor with a little bit of bitterness. There is a spice in there too but I can't put my finger on it. There is a dry peppery mouthfeel in the finish...kind of nice. The high alcohol in this mellows out as you drink. It is drinkable in small doses and is a nice option if you are going to have a couple to sip and relax."
"Verdict: To be perfectly honest, I liked this beer before I ever opened a bottle; the concept of time travel in a bottle is pure brilliance. Now that I've finally got my hands on some tasted it, I'm delighted to find that the beer itself is actually complex and quite enjoyable."
"The beer pours with very little head, and it doesn't last long. The yellow appearance is interesting, but more yellow than golden. You can definately smell the essense of honey, with a hint of grapes that almost makes it seem like you're smelling a wine. It is quite an interesting balance. It's almost like it's a hybrid between a beer, a mead, and a wine. It definately tastes sweet, which I like, but with a lingering sweet aftertaste that bitter beer lovers definately will not enjoy. This is the only reason taste does not get a 5. I'm not a fan of hops-bombs, but this beer could definately use just a little more hops to help balance it out, though not too much to kill the sweet taste of the honey and grapes completely. The use of saffron is noted and gives the beer a nice spicy taste. Depite its 9% abv I cannot detect much alcohol, and the beer has a good mouthfeel, aside from the lack of carbonation. At times it's little like drinking a flat soda. This explains the lack of head on the beer, and I would probably score it better in mouthfeel, taste, and appearance if it just had a little more carbonation. Still one of my favorite beer, and has a potential for perfection."
"I poured into a nonic to a small off white head. It is dark yellow in color and clear. I was actually surprised by the color. I bought some in Maine last summer, but I drank it from the bottle. I assumed it would be darker. I got grapes and bread in the initial whiff. As I drank I could smell the alcohol. I taste the sweetness of the grapes and honey up front, followed by the alcohol. Normally, I would not consider this a session beer, but after the day I had at work, it is tonight. It is a nice change of pace. I wouldn't want to drink it all the time."
"Pours a nice clean amber without any hazing or clouding and nice carbonation bubbling up to a nice film on top. Smell is grapes, honey, spices, cardamom, malt and caramel. Taste is very malty and just maybe a slight hint of cheese. Mouthfeel is almost syrupy and drinkability is ok."
"CHEERS!!"
"The taste is big let down. I has no real front end and ends almost skunky and bitter. I guess I would drink this over a bud light, but I wouldn't add this to my rotation. A very disappointment DFH."
"I'm really biased here. This is one of my favorite brews of all time. I've had it maybe 20 times from various batches and vendors. Each time the beer was golden with a luscious head. The mead-like qualities from the honey are balanced by the spicy floral notes of the saffron. The muscat grapes add another dimention of sweetness. The citrus from the hops is a nice touch since muscat is generally low in acid. The muscat jus adds a beautiful fruit component of apricot and I could gush on and on. I'll quietly step back and finish my brew."
"Notes: I feel like this is a wine drinkers beer, I quite like off dry floral white wines and strange beers. This beer is totally unique and dogfish deserves praise for this expirement"
"D- Just as long as I dont smell it, I can stand this, but im glad I purchased a single. Not sure if a uber fresh bottle would help as the hops would be blocked by the crazy ingredients, and I dont see aging this helping any as im not in love with it."
"Overall this is an interesting beer, nice experiment but would not buy again."
"Drinkablity: The taste does not sour or age poorly. I finished this beer without effort."
"An interesting balancing act with this beverage. I would serve this in place of a Gewurtztraminer or a Riesling without any qualms. It would go well with Ethiopian food as well."
"D: ABV is hidden well, but the sweet/tart becomes much when finisging a bottle"
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. This beer poured a clear golden color with no foam. Makes me wonder if the bottle is a bit old? Aroma is of grapes. Medium bodied, it tastes of grapes up front and malt sweetness in the finish. Seemed very one-dimensional -- I was expecting more depth of flavor."
"Some white froth on the pour but gone in almost an instant, no lacing, just a few lilypads of bubbles along the glass walls. Faded orange-yellow in hue, mostly transparent, slow moving and dispersed bubbles visible. Your nostrils feel full but not heavy with scents of cinnamon paste, white grape, pear, yellow apple fruit, honeycombs, lilacs, candied orange peels, sweetly glazed bread, touch of caramel, because of its general fullness it is a little difficult to separate out the individual scents. Full-bodied, the relatively weak carbonation results in a bottom heavy drink, enters the mouth smoothly and then lounges about some. That said, satiny texture, there's no roughness and while it is sweet it never gets cloyingly so. Grape, apple, pear, kiwi and pomegranate fruit flavors abound. Clove, nutmeg spice is soft and relaxed. The orange, lemon, grapefruit citrus concentrated and juicy. Lightly bready, not much of a hops presence. Never sour but there is a diminishing of the sweetness through the finish and aftertaste."
"D- How much can you handle? At 9%, watch out. 1/2 way through and I'm buzzing. A couple of these would be asking for it. But man, does this beer taste good. I'm shocked at how well the alcohol is hidden in this brew. Cheers, DFH!"
"Drinkability: No idea, but I like it and keep sipping away. However, the aftertaste is a slight deterrent. So, how about a 3.5?"
"Very good beer. One of DFHs experiments gone right. I'm intrigued by the combo of grapes & beer, which has worked very well here, & seems like a natural fit. This seems like an excellent candidate to lay down for a few years to see how the flavors integrate. Good idea. I just may do that."
"drinkability is good. pretty nice balance, with just a touch more alcohol than everything else. interesting, though not a huge personal favourite."
"Excellent."
"Low carbonation, drink sweet and sugary. Careful to overdose on the sweet flavor and you may forget this suckers for 9%."
"Day two tasting Dogfishhead beers. Got bottles at Total Wine & More in Glendale AZ. Appearance - great golden wheat field color. Great initial head off pour...head lasts couple minutes, lingers to nice white ring. Excellent appearance. Smell - nice, light smell...fresh buttermilk biscuits. Taste - barley, orange peel, chocolate syrup. Strange aftertaste. Mouthfeel - lingers long...I like it, full, rich. Drinkability - really good beer. Just noticed 9% which I don't like. Maybe occasionally."
"Many of the flavors linger in the mouth at the end. This is a very enjoyable brew. The story behind it is quite interesting."
"Overall, this is a good beer and reasonably easy to drink. The alcohol is decently hidden. I think it is not more drinkable primarily because of the sweetness."
"Drinkability: Very easy drink - ""I can slam down about three of these, it's very easy to drink!"" - Anonymous"
"I would definitely drink it again."
"Dogfish Head Midas Touch pours a finger of head over a golden brew. That head collapses to a disk of foam maintained by steady carbonation. The nose is mildly yeasty fruity yeast funk and barley malt. The flavor is sweetish malt and fruit up front, with notes of grape skins and oak. Off the back it dries out a bit of herb and alcohol nip. Mouthfeel starts fairly round going semi-dry. Not an everyday kind of a drink, this is notbeer/notwine/notmead but it's own peculiar thing and well worth revisiting."
"A drinkable beer has to taste better; it is, nevertheless, a beverage worth sampling."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my Maredsous chalice. Midas Touch appears a clear, effervescent, bright golden yellow color with about two fingers of fizzy bone white foam. Aromas and flavors are of sweet fruits such as white grapes, floral honey, mildly spicy yeast, not a lot of alcohol going on for an 9% beer. Medium in body with a medium to moderate carbonation level. Glad to have tried this unique brew."
"Tastes like that too, a very sweet brew that is overpowered by the honey and coreander, doesn't really allow the fullness of the grape to peer through although the aftertaste is laden with the flavors missing from the initial, just a great sort of expermental that was too dependant on the honey."
"This beer is pretty easy to drink, the 9% ABV was apparent but not very much."
"D: Alcohol is only slightly picked up, even though i can feel it...decent flavor helps"
"Bottle Pours a clear orange gold with a small white head. The head leaves quickly. Has an okay aroma of fruits, spices and sourness. Has a good carbonation and a good mouthfeel. The flavor is tasty. Well balanced with a good alcohol kick. A real good middle of the road beer. Has an oily texture. A good solid finish and a nice aftertaste. I like this beer, very well done"
"J"
"I am blown away by the subtle and beautiful mix of flavors in this brew. It is the perfect marriage of tastes that are not quite mead or wine or beer. Far from simple, but simply delicious."
"The first bottle I had of this I was quite excited. Some of its charm has worn off though, as tends to happen to me with any mead flavours. Still not bad, but not a big deal."
"Hard to put into words, try it for yourself if you have the $ and want to try something different."
"(D)- This is definitely a multi-dimensional beer. It is complex and should be sipped to enjoy all that it has to offer. At 9%abv, I have no idea where all of that is but its in there somewhere! I really couldnt have more than one at a time though because of its richness, but its enjoyable nontheless."
"D - i really enjoyed this beer, it was different. It looked and smelled like wine, but tasted like a beer. I couldnt have too much of it at one time, but i do think its an enjoyable beer."
"Very clear dark gold color. No head to speak of and lots of bubbles clinging nicely to the sides. Very blunt sweet smell upfront, honey and grapes. Smell is remniscent of gummy bears or something of the like. Wow is this beer sweet. Slight metalic twang but lots and lots of honey. Very thick mouthfeel and the alcohol is somewhat apparent. A very interesting beer but could not drink more than one of these at a time due to the ridiculous sugar high I would be afraid of."
"I really like this one, but the nature of it is such that it is a once in a while drink, to be enjoyed on occasion. Recommended."
"Notes - Extremely interesting and complex. The alcohol is well hidden. The lack of carbonation is probably true to a historical standard but I would have liked a little more. A beer you have to try."
"With only a slight alcohol warming and lots of fruity, easy flavors, I'd say this is quite drinkable."
"Pours a light yellow, fizzy with alcohol. Aroma of light grapes and slight honey. Reminds me a lot of Champagne or a grape-y saison in the taste. Very dry but with lots of flavor. I'd say this is my beer substitue for champagne or wine, should I ever need to have one. A lot of the more astringent grape flavors combined with a honey sweetness and a light malt base to dry it out. Really great combo."
"D - not my thing, don't want another."
"This brew is quite different, making it the standard for DFH. There is a lot of character in the palate, and overall very pleasing. Somewhere in the middle of the DFH food chain and certainly enjoyable. Not sure I could drink too many of these in one sitting, but definitely worth a second look."
"Poured a cloudy yellow/orange with some decent head and lace. Has a funky, almost sour smell with spices, some sugariness and heaveir fruits poking through. Tasted smooth and semi-creamy with notes of wine taste like grape. Again, a light malt taste that isn't quite caramel but something closer to honey/syrup (it tastes sticky). Also somewhat of a dry taste thanks to some hop bitterness and tartness from the fruits. A different beer indeed, but one worth trying."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature tulip pours a crisp bubbly gold with a thin diminishing head that lasts as a thin layer. Aroma is an interesting blend of sweet malts and spice with a touch of mead-like honey. Taste is a nicely complex blend of honey, sweet malts, sweet fruit and spice with just a trace of hops. The beer is certainly on the heavy side of medium, but it is subdued by a dry smoothness and slight carbonation. I remember having this one a few years back and not liking it, I must say, I like this one now!"
"A big, full carbonation make for a nice frothy mouthfeel for this complexly flavored beer, but not something that I would drink more than one or two of."
"This is a very unique and enjoyable beer. I think it would be a bit better if it was a little less sweet and if there was less alcohol flavors. If that was the case then the saffron, herbs and grape flavors might be allowed to shine brighter."
"Overall this beer is a little out there but I really enjoyed it. Might not go into regular rotation but something I'll crave again at some point. Have to give it high marks if rated for style. Surprised it doesn't have a higher rating here. Have to give it to DFH for putting out another interesting and highly enjoyable ale."
"D - the only thing holding the drinkability down is the higher abv. because this beer has amazing smell/flavor. (so much so it's hard to narrow down what makes it so great, perhaps i will have to buy more and update my review) must try!"
"This is one of a kind and you won't find anything else like it on the market."
"drinkability: an extremly easy drinkin because of how thin the consistency is."
"This bottle had cellared for 5 months, but I doubt this had much of an effect."
"Drink is good for a 9% ABV but you can taste the alcohol on this one. A little heavy probably for a nice fall day."
"Rating a bottle at UC's international beer tasting. I've previously had it a few times. Poured clear with a slight honey color. Almost like a BMC. Poured a little thicker than average which would make sense with a higher gravity beer. The first thing I noticed on the taste was the total lack of hops (hooray for a beer recipe that pre-dates the widespread hopping of beer. There is a slight taste of white grapes, similar to a whine with a huge honey follow-up. The honey taste is pretty heavy but the beer is still incredibly drinkable. at $15 per four pack its an occasional drinker at best, but still a personal favorite."
"I started drinking this while reading a book about the Lost Boys of Sudan. I continued drinking it thinking if the Lost Boys can dodge helicopters, starvation, and lions I can finish this beer. Alas, I could not..drainpour."
"D: Drinks like a skunk lager. It really does. Fruity Bud-Light. I'm sorry Sam! Besides that weird resurgance thing the fruits do there just isn't that much to this beer. It's quite drinkable but kind of boring."
"Following the Raison D'extra this tasted light and smooth. Let's assume that the saffron was added to promote the ""mida's touch"" of the golden yellow color. I could drink this all night. This would be a crowd favorite and the 9% is well hidden."
"There is a great hint of white grapes in every sip along with an after taste of saffron just as you'd expect by reading the label. Very unique, an instant classic."
"The wine taste makes it less drinkable than it should be."
"For me, this beer is interesting in that it has this wine-like aroma, but upon tasting, I realize I would prefer a basic wine table wine to the Midas Touch."
"D: This is where the strange taste fits in. Good tasting beer all around, but it's one you don't want to have more than a single bottle of."
"Very unique, and something I'd like to try on tap at some point. As always Dogfish Head gets big points for experimentation, and the chutzpah behind it to follow through. I'd have to drink a few more bottles of Midas Touch to get a better familiarity with it before I could alter my taste and drinkability scores, however this stuff is good and compelling enough in its own way that that won't be too difficult to motivate."
"The mouthfeel presents that higher ABV, but remains smooth until the aftertaste hits you with the spice and herb. Overall I will buy this again and appreciated its distinct character."
"I would definitely drink more of these, though I do not think they are much of a session beer. This recipe was a hit for DFH"
"D: The spiciness keeps this from being too sweet. This is great as a sipping beer. It would be great as a session beer as long as it is limited. I would love to use this to introduce some of my novices to the bigger world of beer."
"This is nothing awe-inspiring but is really quite a unique, interesting brew. The saffron and grapes give it a fresh feel and there is still enough beer presence to give it some depth. I would drink a couple."
"By the way try it with thin crust Pizza."
"D - Awesome beer but its barleywine flavor and 9% don't lend well to the drinkability of this beer."
"D- cant seem to find anything special about this beer. the one i had was more than enough. not one of dog fish's better offerings. i probably wont try this again. it wasnt offensive, it just isnt anything i could see myself craving again."
"M/D- I guess i just wasnt into this one... especially for the price. Filmy on the tongue"
"I can't say this is a beer I'd care to have again. It was far too sweet and thin to be enjoyable. So while it was interesting to try once, that's all I'll have of this one."
"Easy drinking. Nice to know where the beer may have originated from - possibly taken on the form in order to tempt aggressive beer tasters like most of us on here. higher abv"
"D= Not very high at all. I'll get sick of this after one I'm sure. I appreciate the effort and the history lesson but not for me."
"D--The carbonation actually becomes tiresome for my palate, so one bottle is enough. Fairly easy to drink though."
"T: Saturated in honey sweetness. Relatively light body, mild spices, and then a deluge of yummy honey sweetness. Not the most complex and not, by any means, unpalatably saccharine - in fact, you keep wanting to go back for another sip! The sweetness lingers in your mouth forever!"
"Highly drinkable. Especially considering its ABV."
"All in all, I was impressed with this beer and glad that I tried it."
"Drinkability: At 9% it's definitely a sipping beer for me, but overall very drinkable. I could certainly make an evening out of a 4-pack of these. Not necessarily the most sessionable of beers, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Drinkability: I'm going to say moderately high - this is a great tasting beer and it's got a lot of positive attributes to it. The ABV is a little high, but I would defnitely sit down for a couple of these in a sitting."
"Overall: Not bad drinkability considering ABV but alcohol is still noticed, all around reminds me of a bubbly white wine, good flavors not typically found in beer and really sweet."
"Over all I think this is an under rated beer, worthy to sit in the beer halls as a good experimental beer that came off just right. With this great taste and cute story how can you go wrong?"
"D: I remember a drinking vessel in the ancient Greek section of the Boston MFA. On one side it read something like ""Koidros is handsome"" and on the opposing side, ""Praise him and drink."" I really want one of those, but with my name in place of Koidros. When I get it, this is the first brew I'll fill it with and pass it round the room. We'll have a symposium, and speak of politics and poetry. Or, just have a party and get pissed."
"Drinkability: This is a very unique beer. A nice sweetness, tasty spices, and refreshing. This is a great brew to drink if you want to unwind from a tough day at work (which it just so happens was today for me). I wouldn't have more than one or two in a night, but I attribute that to the overall sweetness and my preference for bitter deliciousness of hops."
"Beer poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass is golden straw colored with a lazy and limited amount of bubbles rising through the beer. Little head and no retention. Smell is pungeant and floral, but not hop floral, very unique and hard to describe for me. Taste is unique as well . . . remarkably smooth with little hint of the 9% alcohol. Grapes are very present. Not sure I'd drink it regularly but a very interesting and different beer."
"Looked like a chardonnay with a slight head and carbonation: light orange and nearly perfectly clear. The smell was complex and unique: sweet, a little malty, with honey, a mild mix of spices, a pinch of citrus acid. The grapes were apparent too. The smell was clean and crisp. The taste was the closest thing to wine that I've ever had in a beer. It was dominated by white and green grapes, plus there's honey and fruity tones. I couldn't taste the safron as much as I thought I would, but there were some other spices though. There was a pinch of alcohol and yeast thrown in too. The aftertaste was a little acidic and dry, which was good, because the mouthfeel had a bit of a sweet, syrupy aspect to it too, which may have gone a little overboard without these factors. The carbonation is a little tingly on the tongue. It's a nifty beer, and I really like the idea behind it. This one is a sipper, and I feel satisfied (and a little lightheaded) after this one. I wish I had it sitting outside on a warm: I think I'll save the rest of the 4-pack for the summer."
"I'm really happy that I decided to try one of these. I'll add this to my, positive DFH list."
"I have heard that different types of yeast were used to make this which i could definately tell when drinking this. I have also heard that alot of people cant handle the yeast and be careful with it i did not experience this and did thoroughly enjoy this beer/mead i would go back try this one agian."
"Drinkability- A very delicious and complex brew. Definitely different from most of the beer I've tasted. If it weren't for the price tag, I'd like to think I'd pick up quite a few of these and sit around with friends drinking this with a good meal."
"D- Good drinkability, however the alcohol could make it hard to pound a four pack and keep drinking."
"I bought this beer after hearing the story behind it. Would've liked the choice of buying one bottle to sample but splurged for the 4 pack. I poured the beer into a belgian goblet glass. It poured a golden copper color with about 3/4 inch of head that quickly reduced to about 1/8 inch and maintained. First smell hinted of sweet musk and malt. Second pass picked up the sweetness of sugar and honey with a fruitiness of ripe raisin. Final pass picked up some vanilla and pepper on the back end. First taste was a surprise. I expected it to be very intense and ripe but it was nicely balanced. I immediately felt the carbonation on my tounge which was quickly followed by the flavor of ripe fruit tones, maybe grape or raisin? Hard to really tell for sure. I was shocked at the finish which I did not expect. The finish quickly turned malty and then balanced out perfectly with a nice finish of intense wheat. I loved the finish and it left me wanting more. This was almost like two different drinks in one. It was as if the beginning was there to set up the end. Very strange yet very interesting and impressive. Not a top 10 but an interesting offering worth the cost if you like sampling unique offerings!"
"Overall impression: Interesting - certainly pushing the definition of beer. Not something I would want much of, but its an interesting thing to try with a nice depth of flavors."
"With too much grape and the high ABV, it's not very drinkable. Interesting, yes, but very hard to drink."
"Overall - A cool change of pace, but not something I see myself having many times in the future."
"D- Interesting brew for sure and worth a try for sure."
"Verdict: This beer was made on a recipe based off of molecular analyzation of the residue inside flasks found in King Midas's tomb. I'm thankful we have come along so far in the millenia that have passed."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. Think of this as a spiced tripel and you'll know what to expect."
"Once again I have nothing but respect for what DFH does. While I have tried a few of their beers that aren't my favorite, they always impress me by doing something different. I plan on buying a four pack of this soon to share with my friends at our next beer night because of how interesting it is, but beyond that I don't expect to buy it anytime again the in the future."
"A little too sweet to be imminently drinkable, though extremely interesting, especially thanks to the lack of hops used in brewing. Certainly a curiosity that deserves to be examined, and probably a fairly decent approximation of what would have been enjoyed by those in Midas' time, albeit assuredly clearer and more refined than the unfiltered brews of the day. Certainly a good choice for wine-lovers."
"hate to just flat out rave about this one but i have to. it may not taste the best to everyone but it tastes like nothing ive had before or since. the history behind it is amazing and the fact that it only comes in a limited release and once a year makes me have to go and buy it as soon as i see it in stores. and at 9% abv it makes you feel like you are king midas.taste is only a little above average but everything else is an a plus."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and creamy. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is light. This is an interesting beer it is not to bad. I rather enjoyed drinking this beer. I am glad the DFH resurrected this beer from beerdom."
"This is a fairly drinkable brew, however I find it more enjoyable when savored. At 9% ABV, you wouldn't want to drink these too quickly anyway."
"The body and feel is very thin. A little heat on the end that is preceded by dry astringent red grapes. The honey that is prevalent in the smell has seemed to disappear. This beer is still a little rough around the edges, but I'm assuming this is how the egyptians liked it way back when!"
"What a bizarro brew. Off-centered to the hilt and very confusing. I'm confused..."
"I could drink a couple of these, but probably wouldn't. Not quite as intense as I was expecting. A little bit bland. I do, however, love the experimentation and the historical refurbishings of DFH."
"Mouthfeel is medium and very dry. Drinkability is not that great. I can't see myself wanting more than one of these. I'm glad I got to try it, but I doubt I'd buy it again."
"Overall, this is an above-average beer. It's not exactly my style, but it's a nice change. I'm worried it's a little gimmicky, not my favorite Dogfish Head."
"D: Did not care much for this one. The beverage seems confused as to whether it is a beer or a wine. While I like experimental beers, this one just does not do it for me. I find this very similar in aroma and taste to DFH 2008 release of theobroma."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy pale golden colour, very apple juice-esque, with a minimum of fizzy white head, that leaves no lacing. The smell blew me away - how on earth did they get my Mom's Concord grape juice popsicles' essence into this beer? Oh yeah, the Muscat grapes. Wow, this smells good - the barley malt becomes more evident, and the sweet grape recedes, as the beer warms. The taste has a sweet, herbal note at first, and then a fair dollop of field honey, with the malt backbone holding things up nicely. The carbonation is noticeable, but not detracting, and the significantly elevated alcohol appears only as a nice warming. It finishes dry, with the muscat sweetness pleasantly sticking around. A lovely and interesting beer, nice to point out the historical methods employed to make our favorite beverage."
"As previously stated, this has quite a kick to it and almost taste like a strong belgian beer. It's not complex enough to fall under that category but then again, it doesn't have to. Take it for what it is - a nicely crafted spice beer with the most mellow of flavors in it. A surprise indeed!"
"As many have said, this is an interesting beer. Pours clear and golden, not much head really. Smell at first was bland and somewhat ""macro-ish," almost like a warm bud light. Then, upon closer inspection, there is a strong sweetness to it along with some spice. I cant say I necessarily smelt honey, but it was sweet. Taste is pretty good. A strong malt backbone, very sweet, along with some grape and more sweetness. It was almost like a white grape juice with some added suger. It wasnt bad though. Mouthfeel was light, at first sip it was very crisp but as it warmed, it thickened some. Overall not a bad beer. Well worth a try and very good for a style I'm not all that fond of. And the high ABV is not detectable at all IMO."
"D - it's different and worth a try."
"saw something on the history channel on beer about this, two years ago or so, and havent been able to forget about it. finally picked one up. real unique beer. looks, seems like a lager or pilsner. golden color with a nice white head that does stick around, but doesnt really do much on the glass. the smell is a nice honey and fruit ester tones. same with smell, let this beer warm up. i had one cold and it literally had nothing going on. i let it sit for a bit on the second, warm up, and the results were much, much better. tastes is very unique, lots of fruit again, grapes or raisins. lots of light flavors, similar to a lager. sweets like honeys, as well. unique, different, fun beer. definitely not one id expect to see on tap or on menus, not really one to have too much of."
"D: With no overpowering notes, this is a pretty easy drinking beer. Don't let the alcohol creep up on you. This one packs a 9% wallop, but it's not readily evident."
"Driakabilty was great. I found it smooth and tasty, but I do perfer slighty bigger beers with this level ABV. I did expect it to be a bit stronger, but I'm not complaining."
"D - This beer is what you make of it. If you expect the standard offering from most craft beers, then Midas Touch may disappoint. If, on the other hand, you enjoy both wine and beer and expect a weird hybrid of the two, you will probably enjoy what Dogfish Head has done here. This could easily stand in for Moscato d'Asti where a somewhat heavier offering is desired."
"D - Not very drinkable, very boozy."
"Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed his beer, as it was certainly worth a try. It would make a grea brew for a warm spring day."
"D: A bit too sweet to have too many."
"Nice to sip and a refreshing change from my usual DIPA's. Not something I would expend the finances for, considering the $14.99/4 pack pricing. Well made nonetheless, which is the norm coming from DFH."
"D 3.5 - very sip-able with spicy food or to share a wine like brew, but not a session beer for sure! An interesting attempt for a unique brew from DFH."
"A nice golden straw color with a small bubbly white head that left a little lacing. Aroma of dry white wine(grapes),and spice (must be the saffron) and pale malts. Flavor is sweet up front leading to a dry fruityness,kind of like Mead. Very fruity and flavorful,with some sweet honey notes.Medium to full sticky mouthfeel with lively carbonation and a long dry spicy finish. A very interesting brew,it took me a few sips to get into it,and by the end I thought it to be pretty good."
"D: Goes down at first fairly well but is a little sweet for a lot of consumption."
"Bottle. Pour was a medium gold, head is almost non-exsistent. Aroma was flowery and sweet. Taste was right away sweet and flowery, just like the aroma promised, but not overly annoying, My wife enjoyed this also. Not sure I could drink more than a few at a sitting, but good regardless."
"D - This is very drinkable, although it is a bit pricey. I imagine that is because of the saffron. Worth the little extra though."
"(D) The unique make up of this brew is intriguing and provokes continual sipping to answer the question, ""what is that taste?"""
"D - This really is unique. Very sweet and yet quite spicy."
"Started the pour soft, but due to lack of head forming I stepped it up a coupe notches...got a nice 2-finger white head, but it left as soon as it came...no lace...look on this ""beer"" is crystal-clear light amber...Smell is pure fruit&booze... I can tell this is going to be a hard brew to review(poet, diden't know it)because it doesn't fall into ""normal"" beer style ranges... The honey taste seems subdued compared to a hopslam...the grapes seem to come through the strongest. Alcohol is warming in a nice way. I could have perhaps three of these before I'd grow tired of it(good thing I only bought 1!). However; I must say it's really cool of Dog Fish Head to give us this history lesson!"
"It might appeal to some people who like Golden Monkey (Victory's Tripel), which I liked."
"Pours a golden/reddish color. Average white head, fizzy. Sweet aroma of honey, flowers. Strong earthy scents, syrupy smelling, sugar and alcohol--tempting. Strong taste of honey, flowers, strong aftertaste, a little cough syrup, alcohol. Strong unique flavor. Warming up..still a strong flavor, especially the cough syrup aftertaste."
"Drinkability: Better than I had hoped. I actually kinda like it. Doesn't taste a whole lot like a typical beer - kind of resembles a syrupy white wine. Nice to try, but not something I would drink all the time."
"Interesting beer that is definitely worth the try. Dogfish head does it again."
"Overall a very interesting beer. I'd hit that again."
"Dangerously drinkable for the abv. Many people that find this brew to be a bit too much for high drinkability out of the bottle find no such problem with it on tap as it becomes quite a bit more mellowed (thought I find it to be almost as satisfying bottled). An exceptional brew not to be missed!"
"This beer poured a copper color with a two-finger beige head. The smell has some grapes and honey, almost meadlike. The taste is almost wine-like with some sweet grape taste and honey that gives way to some spiciness with a dry finish and some alcohol warming. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry with some fine carbonation. A very interesting beer, I'll definitely be recommending it to anyone looking for something unique. This is a pretty drinkable beer, especially for such a high alcohol content."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle..Compared to most beers, this is very different. The grapes give a dry aftertaste/mouthfeel similar to a wine. The lack of hops gives this beer a very sweet taste. The aroma also has that distint stingy smell that a dry wine has. You can taste the honey. The color is an amberish red with almost no head. Very different beer but I for and I bought into the hype that it was revived from an acient recipe."
"D - A very drinkable beer, very interesting, but in a good way"
"D - Not something that I would drink a whole lot of though I appreciate the efforts to reconstitute history!"
"Drinkability: I can taste the alcohol. I would have this again, but perhaps only one in a sitting..To me it has a chardonnay taste to it..Not a bad beer, just not an excellent one either"
"Medium gold in color and has a quickly fading head. Smells slightly like honey, but the white grapes come out in the taste. It actually has the aftertaste of a hoppy white wine, which is starngely nice. Mouthfeel is good with medium carbonation. The hidden alcohol makes this quite a nice beer. Very unique."
"Pours a three finger white head that leaves some lace. Clear amber color. Slight honey nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Smooth, malty and sweet from the honey. Different from anything I have had. Also has grapes and saffron - the ancients had good taste. The high ABV is hidden. $9.95 for a 750ml from Lukes and $3.20 for a 12 oz from Tullys Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Very drinkable"
"Drinkability: As I mentioned above in the taste, this one's plenty interesting and unique, though perhaps a little too strange to be classified as highly drinkable. Also, it is starting to get ""up there"" for a beer (though not for DFH, so at least you know what you're getting yourself in to). Give it a shot at least once though."
"Drinkability is hard to report on this beer as it is not something that you would drink a bunch of in a sitting... But I have had no problem finishing this snifter."
"Poured into a 12 ounch snifter. Color is light amber and crystal clear. Has a scent of honey. You can taste the grape's slightly and honey and leaves a bit of an alcohol finish. Overall a good offering from Dogfish head but the price was a bit steep for a 4 pack. Would recommend to try."
"D: Definitely a good brew.. Worth a taste for it's pure deliciousness, not to mention it's historical significance. I would get it again, but not an everyday beer."
"All in all a decent beer for originality but I wouldn't necessarily buy it again just to drink beer."
"Drinkability: The way the taste fades so quickly leaves you wanting more, and makes it difficult for this to be a sipper. It's not really a session beer, either, as it is fairly sweet. The alcohol will sneak up on you. I'd by this again to have some lying around, but I'd have to be in the mood for it to drink it."
"Quite a tasty beverage from the Dogfish head brewery. I thought this would be too sweet considering the muscat grapes and saffron. However, this beer had almost everything needed to pull off the right amount of malty bitterness to sweet after taste. The golden amber smooth coloration was pleasing to the eye and the sweet but subtle smell allowed for enjoyment to be had all the way through. I rather enjoyed this beer."
"As for drinkability, I probably wouldn't get this again, but I'm glad I tried it and I certainly can't fault DFH for experimenting. It is pretty easy going down in spite of the rich flavor."
"M + D: Medium body, but the tartness makes it a little tough to take down. Add to that the big 9% and it's not the best drinker. Not too bad, but not really my thing."
"Pours a golden yellow color with an inch high white head quickly recedes but leaves little lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Aroma is lightly sweet and bready with hints of white grape coming through. The lightest underlying sourness in the nose. Taste is sweet, plenty of floral honey flavors, more of the grapes coming through on the tongue, slightly sour and acidic, bready, and warming alcohol. The flavors are very interesting together, but not sure if I'm picking up any saffron. Medium to full bodied with a good carb bite on the finish. Alcohol is not completely hidden, but it's not overpowering at 9%. This is a very interesting beer but not one that I would go out of my way for. Definitely one to try at least once."
"This is a fantastic beer from dogfish head. The pour is very nice, it's golden, like the name implies. It's got a deep golden color with little to no head. This is one of those beers that really is closer to a wine. It taste and smells similar to what a fruit based wine should be. It smells of rich sweet malts, a few hops hints and lots of sweet mild spices. The taste is similar to the smell and has a great crisp after taste. It's a little too sweet for every mouth but I would definately say it's a must have on the dogfish line up."
"Mouthfeel also is a little off for beer. I'll give it a go and because I'm the perservering type I'll try to be openminded and make it through the bottle but this is not my glass of beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"D- This is a nice unique beer, with some nice fruity notes. This has plenty of food pairing potential. It's decently reminiscent of a Sauternes."
"d--the alcohol is well hidden and i could go for another bottle immediately. that said, i can't imagine making an evening out of this beer. but then again, if it was cheaper..."
"I'm very pleased with this herbed/spiced beer."
"D- one is more than enough for me. Too syrupy sweet. Like drinking grape corn syrup. I don't really have anything comparable to compare this brew to, just too much sugar for my palate."
"First taste is of grapes, Vino TASTE, followed by some great spices. Pretty well rounded, spices are a litttle to strong with the grapes for my liking. Overall pretty refreshing. The 9% is masked reallly well."
"While I applaud the effort I will probably not be a repeat drinker. But alas, I will continue to spend my money on their beers....though the Bay Area seems to only have a few (in bulk) to choose from namely 90 Minute IPA, Midas Touch and Palo Santo Marron."
"I'd recommend trying this beer to anyone, because as my friends have diverse tastes and palates, they all liked it."
"Not the greatest flavor profile imaginable, but it wasn't too hard to put down."
"Easy to drink beer, went great with chicken and malanga rice."
"Super interesting concept from DFH. Aroma smells dry, almost vinous. Taste is super, super dry, also vinous, lots of honey in there also. Overall it's not my style at all and I didn't enjoy it very much, but I can respect it for what it is."
"Drinkability is moderate. A decent overall brew, strange and not alltogether amazing. Mead like at times. Good for a tasting but not for extended drinking."
"(rated Jun 12, 2007)"
"This one pours a golden color with a bold sweet smell. The saffron and honey are very apparent in the taste with the white muscat grapes giving it and interesting characteristic. I thought I wasn't going to like this one but I was very impressed. The only reason I wouldn't go back to it is because of the price, but it is a good one to try."
"Interesting brew to say the least - and glad I tried it. Definitely shows the wide range that beer can bring. Just not my cup of tea. My girlfriend, a non beer drinker, though, loved it."
"Though this may be a bit sweet for some, it is far from being excessive. I bought this totally for the historical/""novelty"" factor: it is based off of a recipe derived (probably with a fair amount of liberty) from beer residue in an ancient tomb! Imagine a dry Mead meeting an Asti Spumante meeting an Ale! Definitely worth a try if you have the opportunity."
"Pours, not surprisingly, clear gold. Forced a small white head out of the bottle. Nearly no carbonation to speak of. The grapes and honey dominate the aroma. Taste is very sweet, lots of honey and the grapes give it a wine overtone. Some spice, the barley is nearly undetectable. I have no idea why they said an IPA drinker would like this, its barely a beer."
"Interesting beer and interesting concept. I have been rating on ratebeer (when it is up) and on here, and I think my rating here might be completely different... as this one warms, it becomes more like beer with honey flavors, whereas initially, it tasted like mildly hopped mead. Pours pale orange, with minimal head. Aroma is weakly malty... nothing to write home about... the flavor is the funky part... mead... winey... with a strong layer that I can best describe as a less sweet tripel. Somehow this one all seems to work ok, but I doubt I would beat down any doors to get this one regularly..."
"Kudos to DFH for pushing the envelope but this isn't a direction that I'm interested in."
"D - Another Dogfish Head brew that is a little too sweet for me. I had to give it a shot though."
"Overall - The beer surprised me, I didn't think it would be that good. The taste was pretty fruity sweet though and I don't think I could take this in huge proportions."
"D: A little heavy to be highly drinkable, but that seems to be intentional."
"Overall, this is an awful beer. I bought one bottle because I saw a segment about it on the History Chanel and was interested. Yes it was interesting because of the story behind it and the fact that it was different, but as a beer this was awful. I'm so sure of how bad this beer is that I won't even re-visit it again. Too many good beers out there."
"D - Unique... Imaginative... Interesting... While all of these treats are commendable, they don't always come together to equal a great beer..."
"Poured into a tulip it had a decent, transient head. Light copper color with great clarity and effervescence. Smelled primarily of grape, some honey and sugar. Clean taste - surprisingly simple flavor profile. Begins with grape and honey very briefly then gives way to sourdough-esque barley and a little spice (saffron perhaps). Pretty light body, crisp and bubbly on the tongue. A bit astringent and lots of alcohol warmth. This is my second time (first time was about 2 years ago) having this brew and I remember liking it a lot more. As it stands now, it is an interesting beer but not all that impressive."
"D - Too sweet for too many, but a very good single beer."
"The taste begins with a blast of ABV and then the other flavors emerge. This is definitely a vinous compound, with grape skin, and liqueur like qualities. There are some raisiny flavors in addition to the grape, plenty of orange rind, and perhaps a fig like note or two. The beer is strong, a sipping type beer with a high ABV that isn't masked over, and one gets the impression it was intended to be hidden in any fashion. The beer is very smooth, a bit syrupy, enjoyable, but not great."
"Medium heft in body with a semi-syrup like mouthfeel. Decent carbonation and reasonably drinkable for the big 9% ABV. Worth tasting for the style if you can handle the sweetness."
"D - Interesting. Grapes are quite strong but don't obliterate the rest. Tastes a bit like a blond Belgian with grapes. I imagine the DFH version is much better than whatever the ancient brewers were making..."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Val-Dieu goblet. This beer pours a slightly hazy golden with almost no head and left just a slight lacing. The aroma is spicy, with hints of barley and honey but with nothing else from the label coming through. The taste is funky but not necessarily in a good or bad way. Barely and honey come through with an odd spiciness. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing with a good balance of carbonation. While, I have a 4 pack I think I might want to try to unload this on some of my curious friends."
"Very drinkable, were it not for the abv. Personally, I could drink it all night. And I would feel it in the morning. Definitely considering finding this for New Year's eve."
"D - An interesting beer, with really neat flavors which would be nice to have with dinner or to have one to try. Not, obviously, a session beer but a nice diversion and definitely worth a try."
"D: Well, I was glad I gave this brew a chance but I have to say it greatly underperformed on all expectations. Wife hated it, which kind of ruined the purpose, and I was certainly no fan. Definetly not a brew I'll be revisiting or recommending."
"I'm glad that I tried this product of ancient brewing techniques. Will it ever be a regular in my fridge? No. Why? Because it is a special beer best saved for the right occasion. Midas' vinous qualities recommend it for pairing with fine gourmet - it is just as sophisticated as any good wine, but so much more interesting..."
"Pours gold with stark white head. OK retention and little lacing. Aroma is weaker than expected. Muscat grapes, honey and spices peek through. Taste is sweet malt, honey and spiced fruit. No hop presence and maybe a lack of complexity. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, full and nicely conceals the alcohol. A tasty brew that I will revisit."
"d. Hmm. It's interesting. and worth trying. But I can't ever see trying it again. I was hoping for more, but was left with a sweetened grassy and underspiced brew. It's hard for me because I love experimental beers, and I'm, in general, a fan of most of what DFH does. This one just falls short, and I can't really find a compelling reason to drink it. The sweet/syrupy is similar to a light barleywine, while the barley and light grape notes hearken more toward a spicy lager. Not really feeling this one, from the first sip to the last. Definitely worth trying for the experience. but that's about it."
"D- I am very happy that I got to try this. Otherwise, I would not go for it again. Decent, but not amazing. Worth a try just to experience it."
"Overall, not nearly as extreme as I had expected/hoped. Still worth a try though."
"One of the most unique beers I've ever had. I like the fact that the history of this beer is so awesome and whoever thought to conjure up a beer recipe from a tomb is the man. The beer itself is hard to judge just because it's so different. I've never had saffron so I'm not sure what it even smells/tastes like which made it hard. Overall though it smelled decent, had a good well balanced taste and hid the alcohol well for being 9% ABV. Worth a try for sure."
"Hard to say how this beer lines up. Is it beer, is it wine, is it mead? All the ingredients make classification hard. Either way, I find it very good."
"Hrmnnnm... I've had this several times and keep hoping it gets better. So far, no luck. Worth a shot for the weird factor, but the Jiahu is much better. Buy a single and see for yourself."
"A bit cloying in the sweetness department, not to say that it is bad - just not for me. Glad to try though!"
"The taste is similar in overall character and in being reminiscent of something like Steel Reserve but more refined and smooth with greater complexity. It is rather sweet with a meaty, pungent, fruity alcohol quality, freshly baked bread at first, plus grapes and raisins, hint of grass and spices, grape skins, sweet wine and raw honey, hint of burnt butter or burnt caramel. Alcohol is quite evident in oily, spicey, feel and warmth but mostly pleasantly so. After the first few sips, the fresh bread quality dies down and the alcohol starts to take over a bit, threatening to become too rough and interfering with the drink a bit but never really dragging the drink down. The fresh bread element, though weakening in the front and middle, remains in the finish."
"Very drinkable beer, different but very good."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Light sweetness and esters up front. Honey is faintly noticed, but I can't taste the saffron at all. There's a touch of spiciness, but coming more from the yeast. Light acidity. The finish is reasonably dry and only slightly bitter. This isn't nearly as cloying as it sounds, but it's not as interesting either. Not a bad brew."
"Drinkability is good, but I'd have this only once in a great while, as it's really to sweet and spiced for me to have often."
"I dont think its a very drinkable beer, maybe two in a night, maybe. Though still a decent offering from DFH. Not something I see being a hit, though I dont think it was meant for that either."
"Experimental beers are usually interesting. This one is no different, but not one I could drink very often because of its sweetness."
"Another consistently well made brew by these guys. No rough edges here, and they achieved exactly what they set out to do, unfortunately. This beer goes beyond beer snobbishness (something I admit to), right into the kingdom of the beer nerd. All palates are different, as is a level of openmindedness, but this is more about conversation and image than taste here. I can't imagine someone enjoying his, period. Overly sweet. Too damn much grape. I cannot think of what I'd want to eat with this (maybe middle-eastern fare, rice and currant dishes?), or even imagine sitting down with a snifter and sipping this. As I said in the beginning, absolutely be adventurous and try it, mooch one if you can, but do not buy this."
"The first drink had so much going on. It felt like silk on my tongue, left a zing. Crisp taste, tasted like a mix between a pilsner and a kolsch. It had a wheat taste but not strong. You could tell the alcohol was there but it tasted smooth, not overpowering. I am very happy I tried it, and I might get 1 again.. but I'm not sure about a 4 pack. Try it"
"For me i could only have one of these it was way to sweet and just wasnt my kind of beer. Definitely not a session beer. I wont be getting this again which i thought id never say for any kind of dogfish head beer."
"Anyway, Midas Touch is a light golden beer with little head but plenty of carbonation. The nose is honey, spices and grape. The taste is stronger on the barley with a lot of sweet grape following it. There's enough spice and malt to balance things out for most of my way through the bottle but not quite enough. The sweetness lingers a bit, like drinking too much Welch's white grape juice. I used to love that stuff, but the flavor defines the term cloying. While Welch's is an over-comparison on my part, the grape flavoring needs to be toned down. The mouthfeel is fine but gets a little sticky, or that could be a flashback to my brown bag lunches in grade school. Drinkability really suffered for me as I made my way to the end of the bottle. I was ready to be done with the lingering sweetness. It's not a bad beer, particularly for the variety, and I wouldn't turn down a free one, but I won't be paying 35 cents an ounce for it again."
"D-A decent, interesting brew, but not something I see myself ever craving. Dogfish head consistently delivers, but this one is far from my favorite."
"Below average drinkability on this one. Full flavored but a little too busy and too much ABV to be sessionable Maybe just one at a time?"
"I read about this one when it first came out, so naturally when I saw it on a local shelf, I had to get it. Bottled 6/27/08 - Poured from the bottle into a mini snifter, ""beer"" is golden in color with a thin ring of carbonation that forms around the edge of the glass. Small amounts of bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. The smell is a wonderfull boquett of grapes, a touch of barley and a hint of alcohol. The taste starts off sweet with honey and grapes, transitions to a warming alcohol bite and finishes with a malty, grainy finish. What a transition! The mouthfeel is fuller than I had expected, the carbonation is there but not overly aggressive. Overall, this is pretty drinkable for what it is but it is definitely a sipper although I believe one could easily quaff this. A very interesting beer and worth trying. Hats off to DFH!"
"Very different brew, outside the box brewing. While it is respectable for what it is I am not sure I would want more than one."
"Out of the bottle this beer was a clear, 24 karat gold color with a thin white head. Visible carbonation rising, sub-par retention but good lacing. Aromas are slightly sweet, wet barley, grapes and apples. The flavors were impressive because they are well blended, especially because they totally conceal the 9% ALC. Honey sweetness first hits your palate followed by the green grape and assorted spices. Gets a little hoppy at the end when a bit of bitterness shows up. The mouthfeel is great, smooth and creamy at first but a little frothy as it goes down. This is (if you dare!) a sessionable brew which amazes me given its knockout punch alcohol percentage. Easy to drink, clean and nuanced without being in-your-face. A little better retention is the only thing it lacks. This brewery makes some great beers but this one is a must try."
"Pours a clear light copper color with a very thin white head that lasted until the final sip. Sweet grape, honey and a light lavender aroma. Grapes are the main flavor, starting sweet like a grappa and ending aged like a port wine, there is a sweet honey and raisin taste. Medium body, highly carbonated this has a very dry finish. Nice experimental brew but one per sitting is enough."
"If there is one aspect of this that stands out, it's the absolute drinkability. The sweet grape, smooth texture, nice malt, all combine to make this one that's easy to down. It's not the best, most complex beer, but it's certainly good, worth trying, and a good effort from Dogfish Head."
"Making this review all the more exciting. If I could remember where I saw it, I will update the review with a link."
"Very drinkable for its strength."
"D: I enjoyed this beer, but at the same time it was much more subtle than I was expecting. It is a very interesting concept, but I probably wont be buying too many of these bottles."
"An complex and interesting ale. I can honestly say I haven't had anything like this before. I have had a few examples of ales claiming to be made with ancient recipes. Those were either too cloying or too mundane. This one has the right balance. For that reason, I'm going to rate it higher than typical reviews. You have to be able to pick out the flavor in order to truly enjoy this ale. As I said, it might be even better with some aging and might take on more of a port-like quality. I'm no expert there but this is worth a shot at least once. Try it. It won't hurt you."
"Overall, a very interesting beer. Not really what I would call drinkable, but it's pretty tasty."
"Pours a golden yellow with quickly disappearing head. Honey is there in the aroma-but I also get a slight soda sweetness as well. Taste reminds me of mead, but also I get a 7-up taste from the sweetness of the honey. Mouthfeel is light and at the same time smooth. Drinkability isn't very high for me. I can't see drinking more of this soon. I like this beer from DFH, but I think I will pass on having another one of these for a while."
"Dark golden colored topped with a foamy white head that settles down a bit. This is sweet and tangy with lots of grapes and honey and a bit wine-like. Some alcohol shows and the whole thing seems a tad too sweet. Aftertaste is sour. Pretty good sipper and not surprising with Dogfish Head it's a bit different."
"Pours a crystal clear medium golden color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is interesting! I'm picking up some sugary candy smells as well as some dried fruits like cherry, grape and plum. Little bit of spicy/phenolic in the background. Taste isn't what you'd think from the smell. Tastes like a port mixed with a beer fermented with a Belgian yeast then flavored with cooking spices. A bit of alcohol as she warms. Finishes kinda sweet with a lingering spice that holds the taste buds hostage. Thick body, sticky mouthfeel, ample carbonation. Different to say the least. I couldn't see myself drinking this one very often, but I'm glad Sam brewed this for me to try."
"A bit sticky and absolutely chewy, a lot of unfermentable. But all in all, a great addition to the wall."
"Drinkability- It was great sipping beer and I would dink it again."
"not my first choice of a beer but definately different. my only complaint is that its too sweet and too expensive. damn you King Midas!"
"Smooth and medium bodied, this one is easy to drink despite the 9% abv. However its not a great drink. Its a little too sweet for my taste and has a slightly rough bite and aftertaste. Worth a try but I wouldn't want more then one."
"D- i couldnt get past the strong alcohol flavor and on the way down it burned. If it was warm it would be good. a definite sipper but good nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Mouthfeel is medium-light. The honey in here gives it some body, carbonation is spot on. Great beer, one that everyone should try. This is one for wine drinkers, it would be a nice crossover for them in my opinion, and if you love mead than this one is also for you. This is one I'll definitely be buying again, easy to drink, however, I can't see drinking more than two in a sitting. Just a nice beer to sit and relax with."
"D: This really reminds me of a Belgian Pale. I certainly note the flavors mentioned on the bottle, but the end result is nothing that out of the ordinary. Everything about this beer is well balanced though, and very nice. The alcohol is well masked in the flavor and feel, but still quite strong. My only real complaint is the aftertaste...everything else is very well done. Nothing really stands out, but noting to complain about either. A solid offering."
"Pours a lovely golden amber, looking like a mead or a pilsner with lightly foaming white suds. The nose reveals something quite different then the pilsner expectations you may have had grape and honey with alcoholic undertones, intriging. The flavor is out of this world, grapes, saffron, honey you can taste it all. It may be a bit too sweet (and strong) to put away several at a sitting, but it is outstanding never the less. Truely an Ale of Kings."
"The recipe is based on 2700 year old drinking vessels found in the tomb of King Midas. It is a smooth sweet but dry ale. Can be compared to a cross between a wine and a mead, which is more accurate, since way back when wines and meads were made. I found it refreshing and tasty, another winner from the ""Head of Dogfish""."
"D: It is just too sweet in my opinion. The concept is very cool but I can't say I'll be having this again."
"I am glad I got the chance to try this. A unique beer from a unique brewery. I don't think I would buy this often, but I do enjoy experimental beers like this."
"Pours light gold in color with no head forming on the pour at all. Smell is wine-like. There is quite a bit of mead like qualities coming through in the taste. A very different beer. This is why I love Dogfish Head. Perfect amount of carbonation and good mouthfeel. There is much more of a fruity taste coming through in subsequent sips. A little coating/cloying, but doesn't get old. I like."
"The secrets of the beverage were revealed by the new methods of Molecular Archaeology. Dr. Patrick McGovern of the Museum discovered that the residues inside the vessels belonged to a ""Phrygian cocktail," which combined grape wine, barley beer and honey mead. Starting with the ancient chemical evidence, Dogfish Head Brewery ""re-created"" a marvelous golden elixir, truly touched by King Midas."""
"A week later a had the chance to try a bottle, and I have to say that the carbonation was higher and it seemed to be an easier drink."
"An interesting experiment, probably worth a try, but this wasn't that exciting for me. Not completely unlike Keystone Ice, which is much cheaper."
"This is another unique brew from dogfish. It pours a clear golden and has a light creamy beige head. The nose has honey, candy malts, fruity hops and delicate spices. Taste is also very nice. Good blend of sweet sugars well balnced by the herbs and hops. Full, well carbonated body. Easy drinker for 9%."
"Good end of the night (at home) beer. I think it would take a while to get through a whole sixer of this. Recommended, but share if you can."
"At first this brew seems to combine aspects of beer, mead, and wine, but despite the wealth of flavor it is beyond me why DFH chose to amp up the ABV and carbonation so much. A great idea, but a mediocre attempt."
"Very unique, a must try for any beer geek."
"D- This one is really a lot like a champagne. The mild flavor makes it quite drinkable, epically on a hot summer day. You can taste the alcohol a little bit more than I prefer but it is still very good. It was nice to try a beer as different as this one."
"Recommended tasting just because of the uniqueness, but I wont be buying a 4-pack of this anytime soon."
"I saw the history channel special that featured this particular DFH brew and have been intrigued about it but at 12-13 bucks for four beers, I don't think this is something that I would really think about getting again. It's just too expensive. I like Palo Santo and Immort for about the same money!"
"Sigh, I always look forward to any DogFish head beer, but this one is a big pass for me, I guess I like the fact that its different, but different doesnt always mean good. It was really sweet and spicy, tasted like dessert wine. I dunno what to say about this beer and Im sure alot of you will be in the same boat. I guess I can say that its forgettable, I wouldnt order it or buy it again but It was nice to try. not really drinkable at all, Id be suprised if anyone could finish a four pack, I guess I cant like all dogfish head beers or varietals, but I like most, so for me this beer is a ""will not order again"" but I do recommend trying it."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a light amber crystal-clear body with virtually no head. Smells like honey, caramel, grape.. Tastes like grape, honey, spice, floral, with hints of alcoholic phenols. Otherwise, no apparent presence of alcohol, either in the body or flavor. In fact, probably among the most refreshing beers of this abv I've had. Light-bodied with moderate carbonation. An interesting brew for sure, and damn tasty. Definitely will be getting this one again."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, but crisp enough to be refreshing."
"D- Interesting sweet beer. I enjoyed it. It's not exactly a session beer, but something that should be experienced at least once. I'd have another or consider cloning this."
"Drinkability is good. A good beer with an intersting taste. The kick is a little harsh to drink a lot of these and it isn't incredibly exciting. An interesting beer to try, but not something I would rave about."
"This is an interesting beer but I doubt I will revisit. Not really my thing. Too sweet and one-dimensional and the smell is not at all appealing."
"Overall, its very delicious, and if you get the chance to try it on tap do yourself the favor. It may begin to weigh you down a bit and feel syrupy, however, so you might not want too much of a good thing."
"Given to me as a ""tip"" at work one night. Poured a beautiful rich amber color. Heady aromas of sweet spice and hops. The flavor was not as exotic and complex as I was expecting, but it was pleasant enough. I don't think I'd kick down the $13 for a 4-pack, but I'd like to try it again sometime."
"A very easy drinking beer. Due to it's sweetness and 9% alcohol content, it probably wouldn't lend itself to drinking more than one or two in a sitting."
"D - Deliciously easy to drink, but at its high ABV, it's TOO easy to drink, while out. On the upside, that nearly forces you to slow down and savor it."
"D: The ABV and the spicing make me go a little slow on this one. I do not think I could session this one."
"D- Easy to drink, a definite for the summer time liking."
"My first review...gotta say something, right? Nothing I have ever drunk[en] has done what this one has...I am in a better mood [not that I was in a bad mood beforehand...] upon drinking this brew. I must say...the ancient Egyptians were certainly onto something, indeed! I know no beer-ology terms to supplement this subjective observation but I do know that, despite the approximate $13/4-pack cost, this brew is truly exceptional..Hands down. If you like good fruit beers, then you will love this as it is arguably the best ever!"
"D: An interesting beer for sure. I applaud Dogfish for being so experimental and pushing the brewing boundaries. With that said, I probably won't be putting down a bunch of these in one sitting or in the future. Likely pairs well with food."
"D - I really had no idea what this was before I tried it - just that the recipe was found in King Tut's tomb or something. Overall not a bad offering from DFH - it would be great as a desert beer imo."
"There's almost no carbonation, but this beer still has a substantial enough body. It starts to get a bit syrupy & sticky on the mouth as it warms, but it doesn't become too cloyingly sweet."
"Drinkability- A strong sweetness will let this beer sneak up on you quick, definately a tasty beer but personally I'd only drink one or two before switching to something else."
"D - Not a bad beer, would like to see this as a year round offering."
"Excellent drinkability, no hint of the alcohol blast this one is packing til you start taking off clothes and opening windows. Heat!"
"D: Non-detectable alcohol despite the heft of its' abv %. I found this to be an excellent after dinner dessert beer."
"This beer is amazing... Great smell, strong sweet sweet wine smell. very little head even when you pour fast. The taste is so complex... strong moscato feel to this with a brief honey aftertaste...short review for a great beer...too busy to type, must finish my beer!!"
"This beer has a particularly jasmine-like floral nature that reminds me of a favorite green tea, so perhaps my score is a bit higher based on personal preference. I certainly find the endeavor interesting, and enjoy the output as an unusual ale."
"A very different beer drinking experience. Recommended."
"Gold, clear, hardly any head, seemingly very low carbonation. Smells primarily of grapes and honey. Tastes like the same. 9% alcohol is present in a thick syrupy mouthfeel. Quite sweet. There's no hops to balance it out. In that aspect I suppose this might be good as a desert beer."
"This was the last of three Dogfish beers I needed to try that have came to California so far, another quality brew but quite expensive, have not had many beers of this style, would drink again, recommended"
"The first thing I noticed in this beer was the grapes. It was like a light grape juice flavor. The beer itself appeared light yellow with a white suds head as if the beer was masquerading as a pilsner. This is no pilsner though. The smell is strong of grapes and barley. Taste is spicy with grape undertones and the barley malts noticable reminding me some of Abey ale only sweet. Has a slick tongue feel and a bit of an alcohol burn (Well it is 9% ABV after all) overall I'd say it's a good ale which is pretty darn drinkable though it's a bit pricey and probably not something people who think beer should be noticeably hoppy would like."
"D: Smooth, mellow, and incredibly easy to drink. If this is truly based on an 'ancient' recipe, I would love to have it. Although it's a little different from the usual, I found it to be an absolutely enjoyable experience."
"Pours a brassy golden color with an average head that goes away quickly -- but there's a continuous stream of beautiful sparkling bubbles throughout. The aroma is floral, somewhat grassy, with saffron. The flavor is just beery enough, with saffron and honey coming through in good proportion. Bittersweet and surprisingly drinkable. A fantastic change of pace."
"I had this one with a cheese course of Petit Munster (stinky French cheese) and Smokey Blue cheese from the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, I believe) and had a blast with it. Even if you're not a fan of stinky cheese (what we used to call ""Fumundah cheese""), you have to respect the wonderful balance and pairing this beer creates with it. Given the opportunity, I'd do it all over again. It would also go solidly with Brie, and not-too-spicy curry dishes as well."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good. Carbonation is a bit low, but the body is nice and full and there's really no booze in the flavor. Interesting beer, but not great."
"Poured a golden, honey color with little to no head. Lacing was present but minimal. The smell was of grapes and honey. The taste was incredible. Tasted like a grape Jolly Rancher with a touch of honey. Not much bitterness dtetected. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy and the carbonation was minimal. Overall and incredibly different beer but great tasting."
"It makes me hoppy! Me so hoppy!"
"Even the wife liked it! It's nice to try something exotic. I can absolutely see how this wouldn't be most beer drinker's cup of tea, but I really dug it."
"Overall-I would not buy this beer again. It was interesting to try because of the recipe, but definitely not worth 10 bucks a 4 pack."
"D: This is interesting and worth revisiting."
"D: A tad sweet so one is enough in a sitting. Noticeable alcohol also may hinder drinkability."
"Taste packs a punch, feels stronger than the 9%, the honey aspect of the beer really shines through, quite sweet with a sharp alcoholic presence, the alcohol isn't necessarily noticeable, but you certainly feel some warming sensations, other spices are present but the honey takes the cake."
"D - Alcohol gets a bit hot as this beer warms, but the flavor stays interesting throughout. An admirable brew and one that expands your definition of what beer can taste like. Almost like a combination of mead, white wine and beer."
"Overall I wasn't really a fan of this beer. By the end of the glass I was wishing that I had split the bottle with someone as I had gotten sick of the over-the-top sweetness about half of the way through."
"This poured a clear bronze with absolutely no head. It smelled like honey wheat bread. It tasted like golden roasted hops, fairly sweet with a little bitterness in the aftertaste. The texture was watery with no carbonation. This was basically like a reasonable version of the 120 Minute - sweet, but not sickeningly so. It still had a pretty unique flavor, but it was also very drinkable. Sweet beer!"
"D: Another great brew from DFH. I had this with dinner. Went very well with grilled rosemary chicken. Nice."
"update: a bottle acquired sometime in 2008 was opened feb '12 and held up very well. floral, spice, and grape notes still prominent and the beer didn't seem to have lost anything."
"Interesting beer, exactly unlike anything I have tried before. I can't say I love it, but I'm glad I had it."
"Overall, this is a great beer. It's very unique and different. BUT, its very well done."
"The smell and taste are very unique. There is a bit of sourness, and some sweetness that lingers in the mouthfeel. I really don't know how to describe it, but it's incredibly unique and very interesting. There is a honey taste to it. I don't quite know what else to say, but I recommend trying it."
"Overall, a pretty interesting experimental beer (""elixir""), but I probably won't get it again."
"Definitely a different brew, good for a changeup every now and then when the usual IPA and RIS's get to be too repetitive. A must try."
"This beer was different that what i normally drink. A different kind of spiced up brew. This poured a nice light gold color with a decent head that faded to a very thin white head quickly. This smelled of honey, very sweet aromatics, but was nicely complimented by the buttery malty grain. A small amount of alcohol was detected, but certainly not overpowering. Tasted nice, first sip was mostly honey. Then the following sips were nice and you could taste the malt, and something on the back of the tongue. Not really saffron... at least was I could pick out.... maybe grapes?? It reminded me of some of the mead I once drank in Ireland. Overall, the mouth feel and drinkability of this beer aren't too bad. I think it is a perfect dessert beer, while sitting and talking with friends."
"I relish in experimental beers like this one. Props go out to Dogfish Head! It doesn't fit into a style I am familiar with, and for that, I'm really enjoying the experience as much as the flavors, aroma, and drinkability."
"Drinkability: There are quite a few good flavors stirring around in here, but it's not a beer I'd recommend having too often. It's a great novelty and it can pair well with some herb-spiced food, bread and some light cheeses."
"Something different to try and another good effort from the dogfish."
"Midas Touch is a very unique beer, and I enjoy it quite a bit. Its the kind of stuf I would share with a wine drinker to get opinions. I'm gonna stash some of this stuff for the summer."
"Last 4-pack at Jess' Market in Rockland. Pours a nice orange yellow color, head vanishes quickly. Smells sickly sweet like honey and and a cheap lager, Taste is quite better but very sweet, honey, bubblegum, sugar water, malt, no bitterness to be found, but it really isn't that overwhelming. Mouthfeel is good, if thicker it may have not tasted as good. Overall an intersting beer, a little sweeter than what I usually like but it is good and I can recommend. Dogfish always have really intersting brews and love what they make and offer."
"Pours a nice golden with minimal lasting white head. Smell is a slightly grainy honey sweet smell as it opens up a bit. Also a twinge of something else, which I think is the grapes. Kind of a slight wine like aroma to it as well, but something I can't quite pinpoint for sure, but I don't notice the saffron... A bit unusual. Wow, taste is quite sweet, but not at all what I expected... Honey is prevalent, a grain taste as well, but almost none of the 9% alcohol is there which is a huge plus. Has a bit of a white wine crossed with a sweet beer feel to it. Very unique for sure, and not as crazy and undrinkable as I feared it might be. Although it is a sipper beer, rather than a session type. It's still a bit sweet, but I kind of like it..."
"I wasn't sure at first, but this beer seemed to taste better with every sip. And it's easy to drink for being such a unique brew. Try drinking this piece of history."
"Copped a single 12oz bottle from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... bottle logo says ""Handcrafted Ancient Ale with barley, honey, white muscat grapes, and saffron""... clear, lucid, apple-juice like appearance with no carbonation and minimal head... strong, sweet, cloying smell dominated by cloves, honey, and sugar... taste is slightly overbearing and a little too sweet to be truly enjoyable... grapes, florals, citrus, lemons and honey are noticeable... ultra-sweet, thick, rich taste is somewhat overbearing and dominating... watery mouthfeel and average drinkability at best due to the heavy combination of sweet flavors... not Dogfish Head's best for sure..."
"The beer poured a clear golden color with a finger thick head that quickly dissipated into the liquid. The head did not leave much lacing around the glass, but that isn't very surprising. A good amount of carbonation is evident in the glass. The beer did not burst with powerful scents, however, it did have a nice faint aroma of white grapes, almost a chardonnay(ish) flavor, with a nice dose of a pale barley malt. The initial taste was one of dry honey notes, white grapes, and a nice bready backbone. A little further into the beer some notes of saffron come out in the beer. I was surprised at what a heavy body the beer had; I did not expect that such a light beer, in many respects, would drink so heavy. I think a lot of it had to do with the large amounts of honey added to the beer. Though heavy, it was not unappreciated. This one will creep up on you. Drink with caution."
"D - Great beer. Tastes stronger than 9%. Better on draft at the bar in Rehobeth."
"D - Definitely worth a try, but this is far to sweet and honey-like to really drink again. Maybe as a desert beer with flan or something, but I couldn't drink another one of these."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, overall not a drink for a king, more like a blend of lager and Belgian blond maybe? No grape character, no honey character, thin malt character."
"Drinkablity: Interesting brew to sample, but not something I will be making a habit of."
"D - a sweet taste that can be savored for at least an hour w/ a boozy yet smooth feeel and easy to drink relatively for the strength. A nice honey blend w/ the flavor and balance of barley and spice, very drinkable and intense. I admire the effort of Sam Calagione and Company for producing this ancient ale from a faraway place."
"Bright and crisp but not necessarily due to higher carbonation; rather the flavor itself enhances the up-beat mouthfeel. Otherwise the brew is smooth and medium bodied. A good deal of warmth is present along with a juicy finish that processes a bit of a metallic quality that somewhat mimics dryness. Interesting and different to be sure."
"D- For 9% alcohol it was very drinkable. It had a very unique taste that I don't think I could drink often. Might go well paired with foods instead of wine. This beer is tough to compare to anything else and seems to be in a category all its own."
"Pours a yellow/gold/light orange clear elixer with head that dissipates immediately. Nose is malty with alcohol and some lighter fruits and honey. After tasting the first thing that comes to mind is Bad elf. Similar taste, but this is crisper and cleaner, and seems to be more fresh and less rotten. There is certain fruity fructose sweetness to it as well. The mouthfeel is nice, maybe a little too carbonated. drinkability is very good for a %9 brew, that is for sure. A good beer, but not one I would seek out or buy more often than when i forget what it tasted like."
"Pours a yellow-copper color. Initially a good head but dies pretty quickly after pouring. Honey and grapes dominate the smell. The taste is definitely unique. The honey, grapes and saffron mix well with the malt to give a spicy yet sweet taste. The alcohol comes through a bit but isn't so strong as to dominate the flavor. While I enjoy this brew every once and a great while, I found that the novelty has worn off. After trying it again after some time I wasn't nearly as impressed as I was the first time. That said it was nice to sample an interpretation of how beer was in its infancy."
"drinkability - Nice sipper, nice beer to age, even though it is aged LOL Read up on this beer on Dogfish, interesting."
"Medium yellow as it pours from the bottle, light orange in the glass. The flavor is interesting, but not as strange or different as I expected. The sweetness of the honey is clearly noticeable. The mouthfeel is not watery, but not heavy, either and the finish is slightly sticky. It is extremely drinkable which is surprising with 9% ABV."
"Served out of the bottle, this pours a clear golden color, with a minimal white head that dissipates quickly, with no lacing, but some bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The smell is sweet and faintly of concord grapes. The taste is sweet and malty, but not cloyingly so. I taste flavor of honey, a touch of grape and a hint of spice. This is a very flavorful and refreshing beer, and a big thanks to my brother for bringing some(Dogfish Head is not available in Minnesota where I live). I'd say the ancients were onto something here. Also a big thank you to the brewers at Dogfish Head for bringing this ancient recipe to life. If only all history lessons could be so pleasurable!"
"Update - 5/5/08 - Bought my first 4-pack of this nectar in SoCal, whohoo!"
"Pours clear with an orange hued golden color. Not much head. Smell is almost rustic with a smoked lemon edge. Heavily sweet on the tongue, no doubt due to the muscat grapes and honey used. The feel is light and bubbly at first and ends with a silky aftertaste, and you in no way can tell this one has a 9% ABV. Definitely a unique brew that is worth trying, though for some it might be a bit too sweet or soft. For me though I really liked it and would go for it again. But to drink many at one time might be too much because of its sweet tone. Definitely good as an after dinner beer because of its sweetness."
"Beautiful sparkling golden color with refreshing champagne bubbles, active throughout. Head is less than spectacular, but lacing is decent. Smell is huge, think I'm getting the saffron, in addition to the raisins. Taste brings forth more of the honey, as well as very noticeable alcohol content. Mouthfeel is a little thin, not unlike a white wine. A very good, highly original beer."
"It is good, but there are much better beers that cost much less. This stuff is TOO expensive."
"Drinkability: Although a slightly high ABV, this is a beer that I could drink all night. It is unique, complex, and delicious, and you could not ask for anything more than that. Highly, highly recommended beer."
"Another great, weird brew from Dogfish Head. The whole ancient recipe thing seems to be an ongoing trend with these guys, and if they keep producing brews as tasty as this golden elixer, they'll be in the historic beverage market for some time to come."
"Overall Drinking Experience : I would invite those who enjoy sweeter German white wines to try this. I love it with pasta heavy on the garlic w/ a light coating of olive oil and romano cheese."
"Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad, haute cuisine beer lunch at Apotekergaarden. ABV was 9%. Accompanied the goose liver. (Also had a bottle on its own later on.) Deep golden colour, minimal head. Lovely complex aroma with vinous notes, oak, honey and hops. Spritzy mouthfeel. Sweet, fruity (Muscat grapes), oaky and well balanced flavour. The honey and saffron are fairly subdued elements."
"This beer is an interesting curio, but I think it's not one of DFH's noteable brews. Given a line-up of DFH's products, Midas Touch isn't one I'd reach for first. Nevertheless worth a try-- you might like it!"
"D = Alcohol is not too strong in the taste. As for whether it's good enough to return to? I'd say no. Glad I tried it, but it really is more like a funky mead than a spiced beer. I am not a huge mead fan, but I do have it on occasion. If I were going to do that, I would get a real mead. If I want a beer, I will choose a more normal beer."
"Another nice offering from Dogfish. This is quite the interesting beer, and tasty too. Well worth trying at least once. This one might even inspire future purchases for me. Recommended."
"Drinkability: This is a bit too reminiscent of a wine cooler for me. It isn't hard to drink, bit it gets to be a bit much, and doesn't really leave you wishing for a second one. This is interesting but probably not a regular visitor for me."
"D- It is a very interesting beer. Doubt I will try it again but am glad I tried it."
"D- No way I can drink a lot of this one. Too sweet and syrupy for my taste. This one will do it for me. Maybe another day though..."
"B) This one is quite expensive when i can find it in my area. But i consider it worth the wait and the price on certain occasions."
"It's hard to rate this beer because of its special nature. I rated it on what it's supposed to be and my personal perception entirely. I was not raised in King Midas' day, but I'm sure Sam did him proud."
"Serving type: 12z bottle in St. Bernardus goblet."
"Final Statement: A beer to be paired with the right dish, not to be enjoyed on it's own."
"This would work well as in a dessert course, drinks good, but too far away from my likes to drink more than 2. Does hide the ABV well though"
"Drinkability: ther eis a good amount of stuff going on with this beer, but it's a little overly sweet to make a great session out of."
"D - This a good beer that you have to try at least once. Good taste and pretty smooth its worth a try."
"D-I enjoy this but can only have one at a time due to the sweetness. I would say this a good mead."
"Overall, I would recommend this to a person that likes malty, sweet beers. I was curious to try it after reading the history and lore of it, but not all beers are suited for every person. I bought it as a 4-pack and know 2 people that will appreciate it much more than I do. It won't go to waste."
"D - The complex flavors and light mouthfeel really worked for me. Goes down pretty easy."
"The taste is definitely unique and different. Notes of honey, sweet pale malt, fruits ( the white grapes come through nicely again) and alcohol. Glade to have tried this beer and the other three will not go to waste."
"Poured out an excellent copper-golden color, very thick, almost like a shot of honey had just been mixed in. Has a nice scent, crisp and refreshing with great hints of honey. It tasted more like a mead to me than anything else, with wonderful spices and a great honey taste and fruit hints. It has quite a powerful aftertaste, so if you don't like a spicy taste lingering for awhile, this is not for you. Goes down fairly smooth, and is a nice, different beer."
"This is an interesting beer. It was made from the remains found in urns in King Midas' tomb. It has a very nice dark color to it (I drank it out of the bottle so I didn't actually pour it to see what it exactly looked like and what the head looked like) and had a very strong alcohol and fruity aroma. The taste had almost a wine flavor strong with sweet berries, which would makes sense that this is what King Midas would have drank. A really interesting aftertaste similar to the aftertaste of a sweet wine. This is not a very drinkable beer, but that would explain why it comes in a 4 pack. It is well worth the try because it may be the oldest known recipe which is definately worth looking into."
"The Midas Touch pours with no foam head at all. It had no freshness date so hopefully it wasn't flat. The color of the beer is a light orange. With the smell there wasn't much there but the faint tinge of the muscat grapes. The taste was malty with the grapes stealing the show from the other flavors. There was a soft honey taste on the tip of the tongue. I will have to try this one again to make sure it wasn't sitting on the shelf too long."
"As expected the flavor is quite complex. Begins with sweet grain balanced by sour dark grapes, then finishes with a distinct grainy bread flavor accented with edges of alcohol. Spices are lingering throughout, and complement nicely. Initially I could have sworn I smelled hops, but I am having trouble tasting any; this isn't a bad thing though as it has enough going on with the flavors as is."
"D: ok drinkability. The highly sweet taste was starting to get to me later on. May be able to have a few of these, but I do not see this as a beer you can drink a lot of in a row. Still, a good brew."
"Overall Just Not Impressed"
"Had to try this one as the description from Dogfish Head was too enticing. Served in a port glass. Beautiful gold and honey color. Very little head, however the glass did retain a little lacing and demonstrated the slightest bit of effervescence after the pour. Difficult to place the smell, but it was very sweet and somewhat floral. Taste of honey and white grapes reminded me very much of a mead with some mild carbonation. Nice mouthfeel with a mild bite. Very drinkable with a slight taste of alcohol at the finish. I really enjoyed this, but at $12/4 pck., Midas Touch won't be a frequent choice."
"OKay, calling this a beer may be stretching it a bit. It really does come across more as a sparkling mead or pyment than anything else. But whatever it happens to be, it's really pretty damned good. Enter into it with an open mind. Remind yourself that ""beer"" covers a broad spectrum of flavors, not all of which may meet our preconceived notions. If you look at this in that manner, you may find this to be as enjoyable as did I. If not, you may rate it low. To each their own, obviously. But my own says ""wow, more please!"". Worth seeking, if you know what you're getting."
"Drinkability: The epic saga behind this beer is far, far more interesting than the beer itself."
"side not for all DFH beers. keep trying, keep going for the weird wild brews, you get em right some times. and at least you are not a follower! CHEERS!"
"http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2007/08/session-6-fruit-beer-by-bill.html"
"Poured into a chalice a nice slightly cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, there is a very nice small creamy off-white head, which leaves some nice oil slicks/islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, sweet, slightly tangy/bitter, yeasty, and slight spice. The taste is very nice consisting of malts, yeast, honey, and some spice's. Medium body, a well rounded and complex brew. Very drinkable, a true to style brew from Dogfish Head, highly recommeded."
"Pours straw gold in color, good haze of sediment, a small white head quickly dissipates to a ring. Very strong white grape aroma mixes with a little lemon, sweet honey and musk melon. Sweet honey taste up front mixes with a nice candy sugar and white grape flavor, white wine like with hints of a lemony grassy hoppiness as well. Mouthfeel is nice and fairly full from the sugary body and low carbonation. Very much like a lighter mead in some ways or like a sweet white wine, interesting for sure. This bottle is probably 2-3 years old and the beer is drinking quite nice and will possibly improve for a year or two more."
"D: This is a bit of a novelty for me and wouldn't be something i reach for beer after beer. It went down alright, however."
"A beer that falls way short of my usual high DFH expectations. I would definitely avoid this one, especially since it's rather expensive."
"An interesting brew all around. I've done a bit of cooking with saffron, so I am able to pick up a small bit of it in the smell and taste. Then again, if I didn't the saffron it was in there, would I be able to pick it out. Probably not. And that's how saffron should be used."
"Notes: An intense high alcohol brew(?) like this seems unlikely to be a crossover beer, but try sharing with friends who would usually be drinking chardonnet or hard cider and see what happens."
"Alcohol aside, this ""ancient ale"" is rather refreshing. However, I think it serves better as a nightcap. Might pair well with some grapes or pungent cheese."
"Drinkability - Interesting and well worth the experience. Reminds me of an Italian dessert wine in body and taste. Wonderful experience and well worth keeping around for that ""here, try this one"" effect."
"Pours to a bright orange-red color with thick off-white head that lingers long and leaves good lacing. Aroma is a very pleasant malty dark fruit, predominantly grapes, along with an unknown spice. Moputhfeel was tingly and spicy, and the finsih was spicy, long and warming, thanks in great part to the 9% ABV that kicked in late in the glass. Once again, another fine effort from DFH."
"This is an interesting brew to say the least but Dogfish Head pulls it off nicely. It's definitely got some wine characteristics to it, from the big grape presence to the mouthfeel, but is very much a beer at the same time. Recommended."
"Overall, an interesting beer. The concept behind it is very cool. Worth picking up a single to try."
"I hope I don't get labeled a beer terrorist for this review, but this beer was not for me. The first thing I noticed was the horrible odor of urine. This beer smells and looks and smells like urine. The taste is a little sweet for my tastes and the flavor of the saffron didn't win me over. This is an resounding ""No"" from me."
"Obviously the brewers intended to produce a period/historic beer, and in the process re-created something totally alien to most contemporary ales and lagers. But I appluad thier innovation and score this generously because the applied beer catagory is indistinct and varied and because I like it."
"I wouldn't drink another because of the sweet candy flavors go unbalanced and higher alcohols are a bit harsh. I kind of expected this."
"Thanks for the bottle demcorhip!"
"Pours a brassy golden color with an average head that goes away quickly -- but theres a continuous stream of beautiful sparkling bubbles throughout. The aroma is floral, somewhat grassy, with saffron. The flavor is just beery enough, with saffron and honey coming through in good proportion. Bittersweet and surprisingly drinkable. A fantastic change of pace."
"Drinkability is good, but not one I'd plan on having many of."
"Pours a copper color with a light amber tinge. One finger of white head that disappears quickly. Nose is spicy, but with a slight chemical tinge too, as well as the sort of standard lager-y nose. A little sweetness and corn as well. Taste is crazy and all over the place. Mad assortment of flavors. First is that light, grainy taste, which is quickly replaced by malt, warming alcohol, and sweet fruit flavor (the bottle claims grape, which seems legit). Body is solid, medium, good carbonation. Overall, a bit of a surprise. Didn't really know what to expect from an herb beer, and the nose didn't get me, but great flavor."
"Nice, really hits the spot."
"d - so sweet, would be good for dessert. the 9% ABV is not detected at all. nice little sipper for a change of pace plus it's an interesting concept."
"Drinkability: Interesting brew. To me it tastes like it has Belgian sweetness, saison flavor, and hef spice, also some scotch style stickiness."
"It pours a crystal clear gold -- its initial frothy head dissipated into a thin lace on the top of the beer, and a touch of lace on the sides of the glass. When I first poured it, the nose was completely dominated by alcohol, but after it warmed a bit, the muscat grapes came out with a lot of melon. I can detect the saffron after a swirl, but this really smells like a white dessert wine, and not a particularly good one. The taste starts sweet, in the front of the tongue, with honey and grapes, and works its way back towards the bitters -- melon rind & tobacco -- with some earth and spices in between. It's interesting, but cloying and boozy. It does have quite an interesting mouthfeel, very honeyish, but enough carbonation to keep it smooth and it certainly works all parts of the tongue. My major problem with this brew is that it wears its 9% on its sleeve -- I've had stronger beers that are much more discreet. Regardless, worth a try, and I'd be interested to see how it ages..."
"Pours a golden copper color, with a much thinner head than I would have imagined which dissipates quickly and leaves a very thin film on top. Not much lace here. Smells fruity and spicy. Grapes and honey, like the bottle proudly claims, are discernable, as are myriad spices I'm not sure I can place. Some banana in the aroma as well. Maybe some light peach scent too. Taste is sweet and full-bodied. Some honey here, with other malted sugars. There's a pleasant hop kick too, to balance things out. I find the mouthfeel thick and chewy. This is a great concept-brew by DFH. I wouldn't (couldn't) drink this all the time, but I'm glad to have tried it again. When it's cold, you know it's a beer. But when it sits for a while and begins to warm up, it takes on much more of a honey-mead quality. At 9% ABV it will certainly leave an impression on you. Worth a try, even if you're not a fan of meads or spiced beers. Makes a fine after-dinner treat."
"This was a decent enough beer, and for it's abv., very drinkable. I would never guess I was drinking a 9% abv. beer. Interesting (if not overwhelmingly wonderful) beer from DFH."
"D- Easy to drink nice paired with food would only drink this once and a while but I would keep one or to around."
"Overall. not one of my favorites (I hear this one improves with age) from Dogfish Head, but still better than many out there."
"Drinkability: This would be a session beer however the ABV doesnt lend itself to that  overall I think this is a good beer and especially since it reminds me of a wine"
"D- Alcohol is not covered well at all. I think this is a bad wine characteristic to inherit, and that limits the drinkablity of this one. It is also interesting and different but probably too much grape flavor to make it interesting for all that long."
"Pours a medium amber with bright golden highlights and minimal head. The aroma has a sweet fruitiness to it, an aroma that wouldn't be out of place in a dessert wine. Golden delicious apples and bubblegum esters are hiding in there, too. Very little in the way of malt aromas. Sweet on the palate, but not heavily so -- lots of fruit notes, lots of bubblegum. The overall flavor impression reminds me of grape flavored Big League Chew. In spite of the cloying apsect of the flavors, the lightness of the mouthfeel and the smoothness of the beer make this very drinkable. Overall, this is an OK beer, historically interesting and unoffensive, but a bit too fruity-sweet for my taste."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Very smooth and easy to drink. This is especially true considering the 9% abv. Alcohol is masked very, very well. Overall, it's a pretty good beer. I wouldn't frequently stock it in the fridge, but it's certainly worth checking out."
"This is an interesting offering from Dogfish Head. I would recommend trying it because it is very different but something you would expect from Dogfish Head."
"Pours a nice gold, small head which disappears quickly. Smell is sweet with some fruit, grapes perhaps. Quite sweet upfront with lots of grape flavor. There is some herbal bitterness and nuances in the finish - must be from the saffron which is a fantastic spice and very subtle. Are there hops in this beer? Overall very sweet and not much balance but balance isn't what this is going for. Mouthfeel is think almost syrupy. Not extremely drinkable but again it's not supposed to be. Good overall."
"Mediocre looking appearance with a below average head that fizzled out quick to almost nothing. The color is a nice gold with a touch of cloudiness. I've had this bottle in my fridge for at least 2 to 3 years. Very strong and complex aroma. It smells strongly of raisins, cherries, figs, prunes, and grapes. It has a thick syrupy smell that gives it a real sweet note. The taste is very over the top sweet right from the start. The first sip will make you pucker. Slight carbonated mouthfeel with an alcohol bite on the finish. The aftertaste is very dry coupled with a sweet and bitter finish. The mouthfeel is kind of flat and could use more carbonation. Has a thick body and texture . The alcohol is not seen directly in the taste, but only upon swallowing. This is definatley a well-crafted brew, but just not to my liking. It is not very drinkable to me, mostly because of its overly sweet taste."
"Wow, let's just say this beer is all over the place. VERY unique. Appearance was very weak, poured a clear tinted orange with very little head that died down to nothing soon after. Lacing is non-existant whatsoever. Smell, now this is where it gets interesting. Honey, apricot, cherry, and grape. Taste is much of the same. Sweet all around with honey overpowering any other taste. This almost seems like a wine, very different. I just don't know where the 9% abv is? Drinkability isn't there just because it's so sweet for a beer. I definitely couldn't have more than one of these in a night. I had a tough time just finishing this one, not because it wasn't enjoyable, just because it was so sweet. Give this one a try if you enjoy experimenting with beer or if you can tolerate sweet/fruity beers, otherwise avoid this one. What else do you expect from Dogfish though?"
"and blend very well"
"At 9% this is still a very drinkable brew. The alcohol is very present, but I think that adds to its depth. Nice drinking overall. Very different and definitely worth trying at least once."
"I normally don't like spiced beers but this is a mellow version. There spice gives good character without taking over the mix."
"This beer poured a clear golden/yellow with a thick head. It had small bubbles and some decent lacing. The smell is sour and of fruitthe grapes are noticeable in the aroma. The taste is a bit malty, the grape and spice flavors are apparent as is the sweetness from the honey. The mouthfeel is on the light side. The carbonation and alcohol make for some interesting character in this category. Overall, I think this is a fairly smooth beer that does show off some of the unique flavors added. Definitely worth a try  but may not be for everyones palate."
"Ultimately, tastes like a session beer but that's what Mike Tyson said about Buster Douglas."
"Color is a clear, beautiful beer-golden. Aroma is quite fruity and has a zing to it. Flavor has a strong ale taste with some bite and a whisper of lemon. Although it is hoppy, Midas Touch is surprisingly and pleasantly not bitter. The pleasant and jazzy mouth-feel make this a good sipping beer."
"Overall: This is what it is. There have been improvements in beer making over the last couple thousand years. Interesting to try, definitely more like a mead than a beer. It does remind me a little of a Belgian golden ale without the yeastiness."
"D: Not that bad for something different. Too high ABV and too expensive to be very drinkable. Tastes decent though for the ABV."
"This beer is said to be brewed with ingredients found in an anchient pot/bowl. This was enough to give it a try. I am still not sure if i like this beer or not, it is said to be made with grapes honey and saffron. I feel i could defiantly pick up on the honey and saffron. Its high in alcohol. and certainly has a strange taste, so drinkability is probably not too high. Its worth a try just because of what it is, but its a pretty good beer on its own."
"A touch better than average. Glad I tried it."
"I drank a 12-oz. bottle of this Ancient Ale about eight months after it was bottled, which should be a safe timeframe for a 9% ABV beer. Nothing seemed amiss, but I consider this little more than a fun novelty."
"Disappointing. I question the accuracy of the re-creation, but appreciated it all the same. It is a little bit like part wine - part beer - part mead - and for that it is pretty neat. Although again, far less exciting than its background would have you hope."
"Another expensive ale from Dogfish Head, but I had to give this a shot. It poured with a curious consistency, carbonated, but more fizzy and less airy than most things we recognize as beer. Its shiny yellow-orange. The aroma is interesting musty, almost meady, honey-laced and thick. As I sip this, I am intrigued by this barrier-breaker ... its alcohol warmth reminds me of ice wine ... its got a big malty undercurrent that almost tastes like a big, thick malt liquor ... and it leaves a sweet honey-like glaze on my tongue like mead. Interesting to be sure, but doesnt make me want to plop down $8 for a bottle again. Id rather get a 4-pack of the 90-minute IPA. Wonder how well Dogfish could do making a regular ol lager. (#2751, 3/15/2007)"
"Pours clear golden yellow with medium carbonation and no head or lace. Mostly sweet aroma. Sugary grain & honey are balanced with sour grape and herbal notes. Flavor is dominated by strong honey tones at the beginning and end, with bitter grape and leafy saffron notes in the center. Body is syrupy, medium-thick, with moderate carbonation. Not as bad as the Raison d'Etra, but not a winner either. Dogfish Head should stick to barley & hops; stop the fermented grape experiments."
"A deliciously different beer than i've had before. Pours with almost no head, and what little there is quickly dissipates. Color wise, i'd put it somewhere near a strong tea color. Smells more like a mead than an ale. You can really smell the honey and grapes used in the recipe, and taste them as well. Very sweet, like a Gewurztraminer or ice wine. Can't tell it's 9% abv.... Very well done. Highly recommended, but if you are not a fan of sweet, then you wouldnt like it."
"Worth buying a bottle just to taste something similar to what passed Midass lips. Not the best Beer youll ever taste but dammed if its not an interesting and yet still tasty drink."
"D - I could drink this couple of times a week, but at the price (3.50 for a 12oz) I don't think I will. Good experiance, great beer. Well done."
"If I did not know that there was honey, grapes and herbs in it, I probably would not have guessed it."
"Midas Touch, when poured into a pint glass, looked quite similar to a Belgian Strong Pale Ale due to its clear, highly bubbly, golden body, and a head that was big and pillowy at first. The head settled down to a steady layer of foam, with a good deal of lacing. The smell of the also seemed inspired by Belgian styles, as there was the noticeable saffron and spice presence, followed by the muscat grape smell, which is not too different than candi sugar. The taste was sweet and light, which was different than most Belgians which generally tend to be a lot drier. I could taste the sweet honey and white grapes, sense the floral delicateness of the saffron, and got a little hint of citric sourness at the back end of each sip. Alcohol was evident in a warmth, but not abrasive. Mouthfeel was light but sticky. Different than most beers, but not as different as I was initially anticipating. Would have no problem finishing off the rest of this four pack."
"When poured into the stein, the head dissapates quickly leaving just the golden body. (Looks exactly like apple juice) Rich in color, not much active carbonation. The smell, IMO, is the best thing about this brew, spicy with a strong presence of grapes, red more than white. Also some apples and light cherry. Very sweet taste, with the ripe grapes and a sour finish to go along with a bready aftertaste that eases back into the grapes. Watery in the mouth with light carbonation combined with the heavy sweetness. The finish will make you think you are drinking chardonnay. The fact that this is very, very sweet really damages its drinkability but this is a good brew to turn to for something very unique."
"I paid $13 for a 4-pack. Steep, but Im willing to support Dogfish on this one at least once for their innovation (or replication?) of this beer. I would recommend trying once, but wouldnt suggest buying a 12-pack of it."
"Poured a clear light amber, no head, no lace. There was a touch of bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass, but not much. Overall I thought it could have looked a little more lively. The smell was a dead ringer for a white wine. Very sweet grapes and alcohol were all over this one. Hints of honey and grain as it warmed, but really looks and smells like wine. The taste, well lets just say, is this a beer? Don't get me wrong, its not all bad, I just really think this has all the earmarks of a glass of wine. Heavily carbonated white grape taste hits you from the start, as it warmed maybe some honey in there, grainy bread flavors and a touch of alchol, which is not suprising given 9%abv. It has a very light, and lively feel and consistency. Very easy to drink, again though it really felt like a wine. I guess its the style. I will be trying it again though, as it did not really leave any bad inpression."
"Drinkability: the high ABV makes it hard to drink more then 2 without getting piss ass drunk, the price makes me not want to buy it very often. When I drink this beer I frequently want to drink quite a few, it feels like a beverage that ancient man would drink large quantities of while celebrating."
"The aroma coming off the pour was a lot of fun. It was sweet and spicy and strong... I wanted to just sniff for a while. This looks exactly like a cream soda and has a somewhat similar taste. The honey gives it plenty of sweetness while the grapes steer the flavor. The result is something like grape Bubblicious, but in a restrained, non-offensive way. I couldn't drink too many of these in a session; either the sweetness or the ABV would overwhelm me."
"Pours a copper brown with practically no head which completely disappears quickly. Has a sweet taste with a hint of hops. Finishes like a belgian wheat ale. Not bad, has a good alcohol bite to it. Very good enough beer, but way overpriced ($12/4-pack)"
"Poured into a pint glass. My immediate impression is that this looks like soda. There's a lot of carbonation and the head looks like one you'd find on ginger ale. The color is a pale amber & is quite clear with lots of carbonation bubbles. The smell is almost caustic like solvent or a cleaning product, but beyond that is honey, grapes, & some spice. The taste is the most interesting part of this experience - sweet and spicy. It's nice, but nothing to write home about, reminiscent of a spiced wine spritzer. Mouthfeel is harsh due to the ABV and carbonation. I don't know if I could drink more than one of these - ever. If I caught it on tap, I might give it another shot. Recommendation to avoid."
"Poured into tumbler at 45 dgrees. Noticed right away there was absolutly no head. Straw colored brew smelled like beer I use to make with Mr. Beer kit. Tasted like it also. Very flat tasting. Still it was interesting to try a beer that was made so long ago. I think you should try it and see what you think. Personally I'm glad we have better beer today. Not buy again."
"I like this beer, but I just don't know what to think of it. This is so far out there from any other beer I've ever had, that I don't know how to think of it, or compare it to others. This is almost more of a mead than a beer. But any way you look at it, it's delicious, well made, and a cool project. Another winner from DFH I say, and worth trying. At the very least, it's something completely different from anything else you've ever had (unless you've recently had Chataeu Jiahu....)"
"Not so easy to drink - It's certainly a slow sipper. An interesting brew, but I can't say I particularly enjoyed it too much- not really my thing - but worth having as a conversational piece and good enough try. This is my second or third one in the last one, and I doubt I would get again, esp. considering the hefty price."
"I enjoyed this beer, but considering the pricetag, I won't frequent it. Worth a try, of course."
"D: I have to give it to DFH, I think this is one of the coolest things ever done in brewing. I'm not too much of a wine drinker so this isn't my favorite, but it is full of flavor and well balanced. This is a great brew to try atleast once."
"Midas Touch is a very sweet sticky honey brew  a nice mead. The price automatically pushes it into the special occasion category. It is nice and fun to try, but I think once is enough."
"Bottle courtesy of Beerandblues2: Poured a golden bright yellow color ale with a big thick foamy head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt (probably due to the honey) is interesting and quite intriguing. Taste is very sweet with a champagne like feel with lots of fine bubbles. While this beer was quite sweet I never thought it was exceedingly so. The presence of Muscat grapes were well balance with the malt and the honey. Im not sure I really pick-up any saffron but this beer was very good nonetheless."
"I often compare beers to riding a roller coaster, with all the peaks, valleys, hills, dips, turns, etc. This one has 2 huge hills at the start and the end, but yet very little in between. I admit I wasn't expecting it to be so scotch like in some regards, but I'm not complaining. That said, I really think this could benefit from something between that big nose & big swallow. If you are looking for something different, this is it. I'd drink it again, and recommend it as an unusual experience that, like vacation amusement park roller coasters, are nice places to visit but I definitely wouldn't want to live there."
"After watching History Channels Modern Marvels on Brewing, I've been anticipating to get my hands on this. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed. The body of this brew was too clear and had no head retention. The brew did smell of honey and saffron, but seemed to maybe victimize of oxidation. Honey is the dominant flavor here, but there is a hint of the grape juice here. I can't really say the malt and the hops are vivid here, but they are detectable. Overall this is unique and palatable. Dogfish Head is very innovative at trying to recreate this ancient recipe, so kudos to yall."
"At first the aroma reminds me much of a Chardonnay wine; white grapes on the nose along with some sweet sugary honey. Lots of alcohol hits my sinuses on this one which probably kills much of that aroma; maybe the word ""tart"" comes to mind. Not looking full-bodied, this tastes much like an old ale with lots of sugar up front (probably ages well); A slight bitterness comes through with a sucralose flavor which doesn't do it any justice, but grapes definitely jump out at me throughout, and the alcohol really hits me throughout the entire experience; wow! A bit tingly up front on the sides of my tongue, but a medium-to-full body which drys out a lot at the finish due to the alcohol burn. I actually like it but it is a ""wee bit"" HOT! wow! Due to abv. this one is a sipper. Probably too sweet to drink much of. I'd like to age one, but I'd probably not recommend unless you like the old ale/belgian type. This is probably my lowest rated brew from Dogfish Head, whom I love greatly."
"Overall, this isn't my style beer. I bought it for the history behind it, and mostly out of curiosity. I doubt I will try this beer again, as the cost is rather high, and the taste is only so-so. It gives you something fun to talk about though."
"Elixir seems like an appropriate description as this stuff is closer to the consistency of syrup than beer. It is very un-beery in my opinion but I can't quite categorize it."
"Drinkability - again, are you kidding me? 9%? This is going down way too easily for 9%, though I am noticing a little warming in the finish. Still, all too easy to drink quickly, especially if you have a weakness for sweets. If I didn't know this was 9%, I could see myself tossing back at least 3 of these in short order without realizing the extent of the problem I'd soon have."
"Worth trying."
"I havnt had this beer since it was first released in clear colored 750 magnums. Told them that at the brewery and was given a bottle to take home and try. That being said-it is a deep golden color, fair amount of carbonation in the pour though it leaves no head to speak of. Aroma has a lot of honey and grape smells to it. Quite bready. Taste is very mead like to me-has a mellow spiciness to it overall. again quite bready in the flavor-slight alcohol note in the finish. Above average body-suprisingly thin. An ok beer overall. The smell and flavor characteristics really stand out though all a bit too much for me. Interesting to try but not my thing. I certainly wont tear it apart. Seems more developed and balanced then what I remember though."
"Eric"
"Drinkability: I couldn't do more than one of these."
"Recommended."
"this is cool. DFH deserves credit for blazing this trail of beverage history (more like retracing steps, i suppose), and this product is yummyand not just in a relative way"
"D: Flavorful, but not my type of flavor, not filling, doesn’t go down as easy as most beers, I suppose this would be a good transitional beer for a wine-drinker, but to this beer-lover it seems a bit off. The one good thing I can say about it is that it’s certainly unique, such is DFH’s MO."
"Odd mouthfeel, but very enjoyable."
"This is wonderful, I gave it a drinkability of 5 as I really wanted a second one, but at this level of sweetness and ABV two is plenty."
"Pours light straw with hints of purple or blue (I hope I'm not letting the label influence me there), light on the head too. Smells strong of spiceness with which I'm not too familiar. Tastes of malt and honey, I don't get much of the grapes in it. A more knowledgable guy at the local spec's said that his had some kind of funky taste, and reviews here differ too. I'd venture to guess that the batches differ a good bit. Feels big and broad on the tongue, sharp enough to bring the flavors out, but smooth enough to go down well. I get more honey and alcohol at the end. A unique taste and I'm glad to have had it, but I don't think I'll crave it like my favorite stouts or warmers."
"Drinkability: Maybe I'd grow used to it after a couple more bottles, but too different to want to buy again. Glad I've tried it, though!"
"A interesting offering in a broad style. Gret beer for cocktail hour before a party. Not an everyday beer, but if I am looking for something in this style, I can see this one as a session beer."
"I would say that a wine drinker would enjoy this beverage."
"MuenchenerKindl was nice enough to send this one my way..."
"I'm usually not a fan of beers that have a lot of perfume-like floral flavors (e.g., DeuS), but this was a good brew. Just a great mix of flavors and aromas and a nice chance of pace."
"Wow, so much going on with this beer, the smell, taste mouthfeel, like no other beer ive had. It really felt like the beer was more than a 9% abv, not a beer for the faint, and a slow drinking beer. Def try it if you can get your hands on it"
"Conclusion: I enjoy Dogfish Head brews but this one is a toss up for me. Though I wouldn't refuse it (there was nothing bad about it), I wouldn't necessarily go back for it. Though I liked what they tried to do, I was expecting something a little more complex in taste but the white muscat grapes are just so over powering there is little complexity to the drink. Possibly brewing it with a different grape would change things?"
"Unless you like the taste of sweet wine mixed with beer you might want to skip this one. As many other reviewers have noted, kudos to DFH for innovation but I'll stick to their IPA's in the future."
"Drinkability/notes: Quite unique, as it possesses the characteristics of both beer and mead."
"A 12 oz. bottle (dated 7/06) poured in a pint glass, the Midas Touch is a light orange with a very thin head that dissipates quickly, leaving little lace. The aroma is very faint and unassuming, not much different then a Budweiser, or maybe a bit like a club soda. The taste however was nowhere near as subtle, almost entirely dominated by the sweet taste of honey with a touch of champagne. I have never tasted a honey beer that tasted so much like raw honey, almost as if it didn't fully ferment, or they added some extra at bottling. This made it to sweet for me, and I generally favor a sweeter beer. I did not pick up any traces of the saffron, and my Mom makes a mean paella, so I'm pretty familiar with it's taste. I guess it just got lost in the honey. I really liked what I assume I was tasting of the white grapes, reminding me a bit of a Saison, and wish that had been brought out more. As it was, with a fairly thin mouth feel and overbearing sweetness, I did not find this beer to be that drinkable, and would probably not bother with it again, unless I had cellared one for a good year or two, in hopes of easing the sweetness."
"Very interesting brew that is like a rich wine."
"Despite the excellent level of carbonation and the warm alcohol phenols, this is pretty thin-bodied, but very smooth and refreshing, even a bit silky. Average drinkability at best. Very unique beer and definitely worth trying, though there's nothing that particularly stands out about it."
"Drinkability is just above average. This is certainly a once-in-a-while beer that is extremely unique and enjoyable to sip."
"This beer pours a deep gold with a fizzy just off white head that dissipates after not too long. The smell is very sweet with a lot of the white grapes and honey coming through. The taste is sweet up front and honey folled by the grape flavor which echoes raison d'extra a bit because of its raisin flavor. Still the taste still says beer despite these unfamiliar flavors. The mouthfeel is quite full bodied with very lively carbonation. Due to all of the residual sugar, it is also a bit sticky. Overall, I really like this beer. It masks the alcohol very well and is quite enjoyable. It is quite different but wow what a good beer."
"The Midas Touch was a surprise- I expected a beer with more complexity in flavor, but it was as advertised. A very pale golden pour with a vanishing head and no lacing, aromas were not attractive, almost like a skunked import, but thankfully tasted nothing like it. Immediately the taste was overpowering honey sweetness, followed by a slight sour grape, champagne-like finish. Mouthfeel was lighter than I would have expected, and the sweetness hides the ABV very well. I was hoping for something more interesting, but this beer was another good one from Dogfish."
"I was given two 12 ounze bottles by a friend who already had a full case. I poured one into a pint glass. There was about one quarter inch of head that dissapeared as fast as it appeared. There was a ton of carbonsation though. I never thought about it, but I guess that the amount of carbonation is negatively corralated with amount of head (beermail me if I'm wrong). The smell was definatly that of honey, very sweet. The taste was also similar to the smell. I do wish it was more ""spiced"" though. The mouthfeel was that of a soda, but with a nice smooth twist to it (curious I know). A great drink. Don't drink and review."
"I love the story behind the inspiration for Midas Touch Golden Elixir. It's just too bad that it isn't better beer. Dogfish Head continues to be an interesting craft brewery that thinks and brews outside the box. With a few notable exceptions, however, the end product doesn't match the hype."
"Possibly the smoothest fermented beverage I've ever had, but not sticky. Being neither tart, nor sappy, nor bitter, and not even boozey, it's almost hard to sip slowly enough to really enjoy the depth in this one."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an amber color with a small white head. It smells sweet, like honey, grapes, and something I'm not exactly sure what, I assume that's the saffron. The taste is very sweet as well, like honey and grapes, and some other unfamiliar light spicy taste (like the smell, I assume it's the saffron like it says on the label). There's also some alcohol warming in the taste too. The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, with medium body. The drinkability is OK too, but one might be my limit at a time since it's very sweet. Overall this is a very unique beer. I still don't know what to make of it. I'd drink it again, but it's something I would have to be in the mood for, since I don't think this is a beer I could drink all the time."
"A clear golden color with a reddish tint and very little head. Some sweet smells of grapes and spicy alcohol. The taste is a bit on the sweet side with grapes, honey, and some strange spice flavors. I'm not sure if its the style but it taste more like a wine to me than a beer and is something I don't much care for."
"Overall: This beer is great. I am definately going back to O'Brien's for a few more before they run out."
"All-in-all I wouldn't ever bother with Midas' Touch again."
"Thanks Lando for this, another sample, of DFH."
"I found this to be a kingly drink indeed. Would love to drink this all night long in a great hall lit by torches and candlelight in a big tin mug. Them rich bastards had it good in the old days... Ill be drinking this one again!"
"I wasnt sure what to expect for its style, but this beer left me very impressed. While I might not by another 4-fer, I would love to find this on draft somewhere as something to start my noght off with."
" This was interesting and the taste was actually not bad. This is not something I could see myself drinking occasionally, but not in any real quanity."
"Mouthfeel is good, certainly drinkable."
"I don't know what to think of this one. It's definitely not for an undeveloped palate, as the complexity and overall weirdness of this beer may intimidate some drinkers. Try this one for yourself and see for yourself, just remember to keep an open mind when you do."
"I'm planning to brew my own version of this but up the gravity, IBU's and alcohol. If any of you BAs have tried brewing this, let me know how it turned out."
"A very creative beer here. The flavors are quite unique and are put together well, considering the ingredients. Definitely worth a try if only to experience the uniqueness of this brew. While it was good, I probably won't be buying anymore."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Fairly drinkable. Just remember the alcohol content, as it is well hidden."
"The mouth is a little syrupy, but complex and sweet, slighty drying on the finish before a sugar smack developing on the lips. Both of these brews are great, but I wish there was a little more differentiation between the two. I would give the nod to the Chateau Jiahu for being more well rounded and complex. However, they both strongly illustrate why DFH is one of, if not the most innovative craftbrewers in the land."
"The taste is very smooth despite the higher abv. This is accomplished through the nice honey, grape and spice taste that you get while enjoying this one. The body is medium but filling due to the mead like character of this one. Very enjoyable. Although the beer is a filling brew, I find it pretty darn drinkable...takes me back to the Midas Touch era..."
"Drinkability: Abundant flavor that I find very appealing. Indulgent, pastry-like sweetness is a treat to imbibe. Quite relaxing and warming, but not overly inhibiting. Fine beer."
"A pretty unique beer which I see almost infinite food potential for. Give it a shot if you're finding your beer variety becoming a little stale."
"I'm aging the rest of these and will give them another shot next year. A very different beer that should be experienced, but may not be to everyone's taste. A bottle was nearly too much for me to drink."
"Sparkling 18K gold. Modest, gold tinged small and medium sized white bubbles, that quickly dissipates to a small pile at the margins. A handful of large bubbled carbonation streams diminish and are replaced with a few sluggish small bubblers. Thick, sweet aromas of cloves, grapes and honey. Initially sweet and a bit thick, white wines such as sweet Rieslings instantly come to mind. There is a tingly spiciness that permeates all corners of this as well as a clove-derived flavor. The spices seem to pile up through consumption. Lots of honey sweetness in the finish, but this is partially offset by the spiciness so that it is not overly cloying. I still pick up a bit of alcohol, but it is well integrated with some white fleshed fruit flavors. Medium-full body, the carbonation is on the low side which adds a bit to the heavy, but slightly slick mouthfeel. Perhaps a bit sweet and a tad heavy, but still interesting. I found the draft version to be a bit more enjoyable."
"i bought a four pack of this in chicago a couple of weekends ago. it was expensive but it was the first time i'd seen it so i figured it was worth a try. poured orange/gold with a good amount of carbonation and a little white head which faded quickly. looks a bit a like an apple/strawberry cider might. Smell is pungent and spicy with some green apples, alcohol. smells a bit like a slightly spicier version of old english to me, which is a strange thought. whoa! that's a new taste. strong alcohol and spices....cardomon, coriander, alchol and some peatiness and smokiness and malt on aftertaste...almost like a mead (but no honey flavor really). i dont like it all that much and i dont think i want another necessarily...but its interesting enough that im happy to have had it and i might share it around or bring it to a gathering of beer-o's"
"Pours a crisp and clear golden color with light orange hues. Got a very thin cap as I poured, but it was gone very fast, and almost looks like a still wine or mead. Aroma is full of honey, floral, and freshly crushed muscadines. Very faint hint of alcohol on nose. Flavor is very sweet, but not cloying. Honey and wine is up front with suprising delicate floral spiciness. Reminds me of a dessert wine as it finishes. Surprisingly refreshing with all the honey and sweetness. Medium crisp carbonation, medium body, dry finish."
"Overall, without saying, not like any other beer i've had before. Very nice experience. Would love get my hands on some more of this"
"Recommended"
"D: This is a great desert beer as it's pretty powerful. High abv is slightly noticeable with the spicyness and a warming of the chest. For some reason this beer reminds me of tea--though it would have to be thick sticky tea...Grab one for the expeirence."
"12oz brown bottle with a bottled on date of 7/28/06. Pours a orage yellow with a one finger head and OK lace. Smells of honey and malt and has some fruityness to it. Very sweet. They honey and malts are quite obvious. Has a wine like fruityness. Kind of like a not as full bodied barleywine. Alcohol is present. Somewhat syrupy. Leaves my lips sticky. Not a great deal of hop presence. A very unique beer and should be tried if you are able to pick some up."
"Pours a semi-translucent golden honey color, slightly vigorous pour only produced the slightest thin off white cap of tightly packed fizzy bubbles before vanishing to the faintest ring of white glass lining lace. Aroma is sweet and grainy, light grassiness, some grapey notes present as well. Slight alcohol warmth teases the nostrils, smells very much like a barleywine. Taste is sweetly of honey and malt up front, crisp white grape flavor, rounds out with a sugary alcohol aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full bodied, moderately carbonated, goes down slippery and smooth. This beer's characteristics remind me very much of a good smooth barleywine, strength to boot. Drinkability is above average but given the price and strength of this brew I can't see drinking more than two to a sitting. Definitely suggest trying at least once."
"Pours a light honey almost peach color with just a ring of bubbles around the surface. Hardly any carbonation. These don't osund like good attributes, but this manages to be very aesthetically pleasing. Smells like harsh alcohol, faint grapes, and almost malt liquorish. Sweet grape juice and residual honey is what I get most from the flavor. Not much saffron to note, really. Extremely sweet. Not really that interesting. Thick and slick mothfeel feels apropos for the honey sweetness. Decent flavors but lack of anything really interesting (from a beer with such an interesting concept) really don't make this very drinkable. Too syrupy sweet."
"Pours a clear orangish amber color that produces a thin white head with decent lacing. Smell is predominately sweet raw honey with some grapes and alcohol. Taste is sweet with malt and a lot of honey much like the nose that finishes with quite a kick of alcohol. Overall, I find this brew far too sweet and boozy for my personal taste. I think the concept of this beer is awesome, it is just not my cup of tea."
" Definitely something special here, albeit a bit pricey, but worth a try for sure."
"You gotta give the Ancient's real credit if they had beer anywhere as good as this!!"
"Mouthfeel is oily-sweet and spicy due to the spices and carbonation. A great fall desert ale, but I couldn't drink more than one or two in an evening."
"Overall, I am glad I tried this. Not going to become my house beer, but it is pretty cool that Dogfish Head would do something like this. I am interested to try the Chinese and Etheopian beers they are making."
"I really like the mouthfeel of this beer. It coats the mouth and forces you to taste every aspect of it. I highly recommend this beer, especially to those who enjoy Belgian ales and fortified wines."
"My wife and I first had this brew about 2 months ago and we are hooked. As soon as you pop the top a blast of well balanced honey, saffron and a hint of vanilla hits your nose. Poured a copper hue w/ a small head that fully diminished. The good thing about this brew is what you smell is what you are going to taste. Full body, syrupy, honey sweet and full of spices that goes down warm and w/ a hint of alcohol. Careful this brew packs a punch at 9% ABV a four will start off a nice buzz. Way go to Dogfish Head for making a one of a kind of brew."
"A very enjoyable brew by DFH...went great as a dessert beverage."
"Wow! What a brew. This beer had a superb taste that I enjoyed to the last sip. Honey and saffron tickled my tastebuds. The purple labeled bottle with a big gold thumb print was also attractive. I whole heartedly recommend this beer to anyone who wants a distinct, flavorful beverage. It's even nine percent alcohol so it'll get you krunk!"
"-Oelergud"
"Is it a beer? A mead? A wine? If nothing else, Sam and the rest at DFH are creative. I think its been suggested earlier, it might be good to give to a non beer drinker. However, in some respects, not 'beer-y' enough for me. Still worth trying though."
"Pours a darker amber color, not much head to speak of. Honey, spices and alcohol dominate the aroma. Taste is sweet, to me the meade is the most dominate flavor here. The alcohol is quite evident in both taste and I feel a little bit of a burn. I wouldn't want this more than every so often, but it is interesting."
"For a Mead type of brew it's not bad. I was just wishing I could get more of the honey flavor coming through."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Mouthfeel is thin and smooth but the sweetness keeps it merely sippable. Has a bit of a riesling quality that I like. Would make a great introductory/crossover beer for a wine advocate to try. Definitely a unique brew."
"Picked up a bottle of the Midas touch to see what the ancients used to drink. Poured into a pint glass, very reddish golden color with no head and heavy carbination. Smell is amazing with fresh sweet ripe fruits, I can smell graps and mangos along with some roasted malt. Taste really got me, very fruity but tasty you want to make sure you swish this beer around your palate to truly appreicate the ripe fruit flavors, very good tasted like sweet grapes. Another good addition from the master crafters at DogFish head."
"Most remarkably, the tomb held the largest Iron Age drinking set ever found--157 vessels, including a ram-headed and lion-headed situla--for preparing, serving, drinking and libating a special beverage at the funerary feast of the king. The secrets of the beverage were revealed by the new methods of Molecular Archaeology. Dr. Patrick McGovern of the Museum discovered that the residues inside the vessels belonged to a ""Phrygian cocktail," which combined grape wine, barley beer and honey mead. Starting with the ancient chemical evidence, Dogfish Head Brewery ""re-created"" a marvelous golden elixir, truly touched by King Midas."
"Midas Touch Golden Elixir pours a hazy orange with a minimal head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit fruity. The taste is really interesting, kind of fruity, honey is noticeable, the alcohol is quite noticeable. Kind of a malty, sweet beer I would say. I wouldn't drink it often, but it's really pretty good. I would have to recommend trying it, but personally, one bottle is enough, I don't need a four pack."
"Cheers!"
"The smell has a lot of honey and muscat flavor. Lots of spice comes through in the taste. The mouthfeel is light and fairly sharp. Drinkability is high; the big alcohol is not detected at all."
"This beer was an intersting beer to say the least. It poured a honey color body with a white head that disipated fairly quickly and left little lacing. The smell and taste where very strongly filled with honey. I really couldn't detect anything else, well maybe but I have no clue what Saffron smells or tastes like, I'm pretty poor. So I could of detected some of that just not known it. The mouthfeel was rather light a carbonated. The taste lingered a while. It was a slow beer that was extremely similar to a mead my friend made with a Belgian strain of yeast as the starter."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no freshness date. Had a golden/lt amber color with minimal head and fair amount of carbonation.Definitely doesn't have your average beer smell. It actually smells closer to mead or even wine but it is a great sweet smell. Taste is really good but one is enough as the sweetness would tend to overpower. Also, has 9% alcohol so that should stop you at one anyway. A great ""beer"" - they call it an elixir - to try once. (2,NA,ML,N)"
"D- I honest think if you try and do anymore than sip this beer, your head will blow from that intense finish or you'll choke. This would be a fun one to keep around and share with some good friends while enjoying a good conversation."
"I could not bear to finish this drink. The Egyptians may have invented beer but it's obvious that their recipe had changed for a reason. This beer is absolutely retched."
"I first saw this beer on PBS as they deciphered an ancient beer recipe. Worthy of a taste if only to taste ""history""."
"Notes: I liked it. It wasn't something I'll pursue. I have to thank my wife for lugging this back from the east coast on her recent trip to Boston."
"A truly unique brew. There's a lot going on in here, and I'd definitely like to try it again at some point. While I wasn't drinking with food, I'll bet this would be excellent with Indian food, many types of Greek and Middle Eastern dishes, and lots of desserts - especially anything with honey."
"thanks rwitter for the opportunity"
"Sam states in his book that Midas Touch was initially brewed primarily to appeal to wine drinkers, and that he expected sales to come from that demographic for the most part. I'm certain that time has proven that this beer survives not due to the support of the wine community but because of craft beer lovers."
"DFH always has a different stroke for a different folk. But why does the label say Ancient Ale and BA say herb beer??"
"Drinkability: It's definitely a drinkable beer. However, I'd be hard pressed to drink it like a regular session beer...it's a special occasion beer for me. But then, I had to beg, borrow and steal to get some, as it's not available in my area, so take that for what it's worth."
"This beer pours a traditional dark amber color. The smell is impressive, mostly like dark malts with a hint of alcohol. The taste is pretty original. A lot like the dark malts, but there are a few spices and things added that make it unique it a lot of ways. A coriander-like taste gives it a light touch, while the hops give it a lingering taste on the tongue. Very easy to drink."
"this is a very interesting beer? i would call it a mead, a high breed of braggot, metheglin, pyment."
"The complexity of the beer makes me want to keep drinking more, it is a little unusual, so I like this as a beer to end the evening, not as a session beer."
"Golden color. No head at all but i'm not sure it's supposed to have one. What do you compare and ancient egyptian ale too? Smell of honey sweetness. Taste is also very sweet. The grapes really show up in the taste giving it an almost winelike quality. Finishes with a note of alcohol. This beer is worth a try just for the experience alone. Nothing about it made me say wow but hats off to dogfish for even trying something like this."
"Taste begins with a slippery fruit juice and honey tone and melds into a prickly alcohol coated hop bath. Sweetness is perceived only for a flash in the middle. The brew ends with a organic grain laden aftertaste. Taste is not all that complex and is reminiscent of watered down fruit juice. A hopped fruit juice. Not what I expected but it isn't a total loss. Worth a try at best."
"Alchohol esters are noticable right away, slightly malty with spicy tones. Grape sweetness along with hints of honey and grainy maltyness, nice dry finish. Honestly not as strange as I was expecting. Sweet spicy flavor, a bit slick on the mouthfeel but overall an interesting flavor that is fairly drinkable, all things concidered. Not a typical beer at all but I like the historical value of this beer. A taste of what it may have been like long ago."
"Pours honey colored with an average white head. The smell is amazingly complex. Grapes are prominent, fruits, sugars and malts, and lots of other things I can't put my finger on. The taste of this brew evolved quite a bit from start to finish. At first I tasted lots of honey and barley malt, then some strange caramely tastes that reminded me of some sort of fruity, nutty candybar, but those flavors gave way to sweet white wine and fruits. However, those flavors were overpowed by cidery/sugary alcohol midway through the glass, which really hurt drinkability. Also, I'm not sure I tasted any saffron, which seemed like a waste to me since saffron is expensive. The mouthfeel was thing and slightly syupy, with medium-low carbonation. Overall, this is a strange brew indeed. Glad I tried it, but this is not on my Christmas list."
"Opinion: This beer is an experience, and one that I think that everyone that fancies themselves as a beer aficionado should try. Even though it is an anomaly of beer, and really isn't much of a beer at all, it is still something to challenge your palate. I am enjoying the mix of flavor, but I also know that one will do me for a while. I would like to let this one sit for a year or two to see how the fruit mellows and the spiciness comes out. It really needs to age cool, so I will hopefully have an update to this post in a year or so."
"D - apart from those who dislike sweet beers, any beer lover should enjoy this beer and find it highly drinkable"
"It would be interesting to give this beer to a pure white wine drinker, to see what they had to say."
"I had this beer for the first time years ago when the allure of drinking ancient brew let me smile smugly at my Coors-drinking friends. And when I had a bottle tonight, the recipe still has that mystique for me. Some may say it's the hype but I think it's because it truly is a different beer. For one, I can't decide if it's more like a barleywine or a mead. It pours like an elixer, but more silky, and with a deep gold color. Its taste reminds me of a mead, with a combination of fruity tones, but they are not sweet. At some points it feels like a wine, with a dry grape flavor. It's a complex beer that alters as you drink it, as the temperature changes, and as the alcohol settles in. It's a nice sipping beer, but I think it begs to be paired with something like a stinky cheese."
"Drinkability is good, certainly not a quaffable beer but nice, sip this as an after dinner drink. MK"
"Interesting beer, perhaps good for a nightcap."
"Pours a clean, clear light amber color with barely any head that dissipates into a whisper. Aromas of riesling, honey and an overall impression of sweetness. Flavors of honey, a little maltiness, and like a sweet wine. No hops detected, saffron is hard to discern. Very sweet like a tripel, but more wine like. This is a hard beer to describe because it's not very beer like at all. Would be a perfect dessert beverage and digestive."
"Okay, I have to say that I didnt know what to expect from this beer, as I have read high remarks on it, as it comes from a brewery that has produced so many great beers. But when I actually sat down and tasted it, I felt a bit disappointed. Not cause it wasnt good, but because it was not what I expected from this beer. The colour was beautiful, almost like an orange honey colour. The smell was heavy, but not overpowering. Then came the taste. I couldnt really pick out one specific taste, but the alcohol bite was very noticeable almost too much, similar to a heavy barleywine beer. Again, not what I had expected from this beer. But I do have to say that for a beer of only 9%, it gave me a wallup like a much heavier beer would, so I would say that the alcohol rating was a bit under rated. I have mixed feelings if I would consider drinking this beer again. Perhaps its a good one to drink after a good dinner, sitting on the porch with friends. I dont think this will make my top 15 beer list, but I will at least give it a second chance."
"Color is a clear, sparkling golden orange. Head is short, creamy, and just a bit off-white. Retention is weak. Aroma is very sweet, honey is most noted mixed with malt and maybe just a touch of grape. Taste is also sweet, with honey being the most apparent flavor. Grape mixes in as well a provides a fruity edge and is joined by a mild spice flavor. Alcohol flavor is notable, especially in the finish. Drinkability is pretty good, however I find this to be more interesting as an experiment, and not as something I'd want to have very often."
"Drinkability - very good, able to drink a few of these (although a case will run you $60 in PA)."
"Lots of caramel and sticky vinous flavors. Raisin and honey. Grapes and sweet spice. Finish is very sticky. Carmelized sweet raisin lingers. Lots of honey. Did I mention the mouth was sticky? Lots of big flavors, not alot of meshing of those flavors, they seem to battle each other. Not that drinkable. An interesting beer and one you should probably experience once. And once was enough for me."
"The body is big and makes this beer unique. Almost like a dopplebock without the yeasty notes. I think this is as good as an example of a malt bomb as there is."
"D- I really enjoyed this beer and will be picking up another 4 pack this week."
"I just wish it had more ""substance."" Particularly in the case of the lack of foamy head; I poured it like I pour all of my beers and this one just didn't foam up. Otherwise, that's my only complaint. Nice job DFH!"
"Had this one in the cellar since last fall (probably september/october): Pours a hazy, burnished golde with a thin biege head that doesnt stick around. The aroma has notes of honey, fruits (pear, apple, white grape), along with some saffron, toasted bread and a touch of alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with a honey sweetness, along with some fruits (pear, apple, white grape), slight hints of saffron, and toasted bread. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with little carbonation; drinkabilty is good and the alcohol has mellowed. This beer has lost some of it's initial complexity while the alcohol has mellowed, a good and interesting beer but probably not one to cellar."
"The uniqueness is appealing. This is an enjoyable ""and now for something different"" kind of beer."
"It is a very rich, thick brew with a decent amount of carbonation. The aromas are just as complex as the flavors, I definately picked out the honey and white grapes."
"Light orange color. Mild aroma of saffron and sweet muscat grapes, with hints of honey layered fruits and booze. Flavor is really unique and hard to describe, strange, but really nicely balanced and quite tasty as well. Rich body, heavy, but not creamy. Hint of caramel and toffee, muscat grapes and saffron, with a definately herbaceous tone. Light notes of vanilla and honey on the finish."
"M&D: surprisingly refreshing on the mouthfeel, thanks to the subtly-carbonated body; the overall body is more than full yet the alc. hides pretty well behind the malty theme, but the structure is still simplistic. All in all, this is a barleywine-style beer IMO, a little too sweet for my taste, and I suppose some ageing might bring about an even more balanced performance(?). Still, this is a fine and rare ""hybrid"" beer I feel so lucky to have tasted--all credit goes to Steve!!"
"Mouthfeel is prickly, tangy, and much, much bigger than the inital smell/sight would have you believe. Very tasty, but watch for that 9%!"
"I could have a few, but the flavor kind of builds up to be a little much. Still okay drinkability."
"This beer just looked pretty, a nice orangey amber mix with a solid but fleeting head. Served in a snifter I believe, or whatever the 90 Minute is usually served in. The smell is where things got rocky, as there was a very strong astringent alcohol/cleaning supply fume. This didn't really reflect on the taste, but the taste left me wondering. I see a lot of the reviews on here got very fruity, and I got some fruits in the end but not before some strange coffee bitterness followed by what seemed to be very sweet and SWIRLIN' belgian yeast. There is a definite alcohol chunkiness there, but that is welcomed as it rounds things out. This was a nice sipper which paired well with my comfortable chair (I swear) and this went down without a hitch. I might get it again sometime once I know more about the beer."
"This is something else. Not bad, not at all, but too intense to really handle."
"I would say this is an eating beer though and would be great with a nice cheese and fruit platter."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed an airy 3/4"" white head over the crystal clear light golden brew. Head fades at a quick pace, with average lacing. Aroma is minimal, honey sweet with a touch of grapes. Taste is upfront pale malts, then the dry grape essence comes in, and lastly the alcohol kicks it up a notch, leaving a somewhat harsh aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit tough, due to the alcohol being so forward, and drinkability is limited by that and the fact that the syrupiness gets to grating after awhile. Another one of those interesting experiments, have to appreciate what they're trying to do, but I don't have to go there again..."
"A very special offering from DFH. Glad I was able to get some when it came to Houston this year. I see this as being a perennial favorite of mine."
"Drinkability - goes down like cheap white wine, that is, it's too sweet and the alcohol taste is too strong. I was interested in this as an interserting experiment, but having had it, I would not ever get this again."
"Grapey, alcoholey aftertaste. Not very drinkable -- wouldn't have more than one, and had trouble with that. Weird beer."
"Kind of a thick, syrupy mouthfeel....the carbonation gives it a champagne like feel. . Alcohol is hidden pretty well, but the warming affect slowly works itself into the picture. Interesting beer, and definately better as it gets warmer. There is so much going on, though, that one in a sitting is about all I'm good for."
"I could never drink this again and in fact, the only things keeping me for pouring this right now are a) the fact that I'm too cheap and b) the rapidly disappearing thought that I should pound it instead."
"Drinkability: Very unusual concoction, but I rather enjoyed it; not something to drink in quantity, but I am saving the rest of the bottle to complement tonight's curried roast pork with mango salsa"
"I received this as a gift for designated driving a few Carolina Brewmasters to the Hickory Hops festival. This one was well worth it. Honestly, I cannot think of anything to make this one taste better. One of the most complex tasting beers I've ever tried -- spices, lots of honey at the end, fruit, a little hoppy. Just beautiful in a tulip shaped glass. I'm really falling in love with Dogfish Head."
"Quite a complex beer here, with layers of easily identifiable strata, but still needing to be explored. Not a stand alone beer, I'd like to have this with a grilled salmon fillet or something. Good effort on a beer with tons of character"
"Sampled through dnrobert24 and 2MBBIF."
"Drinkability could be a factor because of the somewhat obscure finish. Leaves a gritty, dirty tannic taste in the mouth that is not so pleasant."
"I'm not sure what to think of this beer. Overall its pretty complex and I can smell and taste alot of different things, and they work together sort of well. However, I'm left with a feeling that there should or could be more. These flavors should meld well together but it's just not happening for me."
"I'll keep a few around to age."
"Man, this beer is funky. It poured a golden amber color with little head. The smell is like a light beer. The taste reveals a touch of honey and there is also a slight bitterness. The mouthfeel is a funny bitter feel. Not a beer I think I will have again. This brewer is putting out some strange brews. This is one of the wilder ones. The alcohol is hidden pretty good."
"So this might be similar to some of the world's earliest beers. Not bad. Its like a history lesson in a bottle."
"The story behind the drink really helps the drink out, but its still a good mead wine beer hybrid"
"This beer pours a light amber-orangish color and not much head at all. The smell is of the grapes and saffron definately. The taste is very characteristic of all the Dogfish Head beers, slightly sweet, slightly sour with a very distinct yeast flavor. Its a good novelty brew to try, but not one that I would drink often."
"The mouthfeel is thick. The honey and spice create a front and the buttery diacetyl carrie the malt, corn, and concord grape over the tongue and in the finish is a sweet warmth from the alcohol and a piney sap bitter linger."
"Light copper with rose colored hues, high clarity. No head, just a fine light ring suspended along the edges that remains throughout the experience. Delicate streaming bubbles present. Smell is faint, with notes of bready malt, candy sweet fruit- apples, grapes, and light spice. The taste is very sugary and sweet, with a touch of fruit and honey. The flavor kind of gently fades into a slight alcoholic finish that is a bit herbal/plastic. Unique combination of flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, almost wine-like, with decent carbonation. This beer is overly sweet with nothing to balance it out, and the finish is unremarkable. Interesting and worth a try..."
"cheers..."
"Overall, this is quite an unusual brew. A hopped honey mead. This brew is definitely an aquired taste. This might be a good summer brew. I'm really intrigued with the idea of a great brewery like Dogfish remaking anceint beer recipes."
"Drinkability is average, this beer is so unusual that it makes it a little harder than normal to drink, but I think it could grow on me if I got more used to it."
"I'm not saying that this is a bad beer. It's simply not my thing and maybe my palate is not adventurous enough to fully enjoy the Midas Touch."
"Slick feel on the teeth. Fairly full bodied. Average drinkability for a less than average beer. I was very dissappointed in this beer. At almost $12 for a four pack, I feel I was ripped off."
"aftertaste is very sweet and atypical, the beer is quite nice but not one I could drink more than one of at a time, the taste is quite heavy. I dont taste the 9% but I do feel its effects and moderation is advised!"
"The smell of the beer was of sugar (most likely from the muscat grapes(they are very sweet) but possibly honey like it boasts) and alcohol. The hops and carbonation are the first thing that you taste. There is sweet fruity sugar(confirming that it is mostly the grapes giving it the sweetness) in the body of the beer, and a strange but good finish. The finish remained me of an oaked wine or a bourbon. The oak was prominent, slightly spiced, and just a hint of alcohol. The alcohol was noticeable, but the sweetness from the fruit really helped to disguise it. Drinkability/mouthfeel: Drinkablility is above average for this beer, but if you are not a fan of wine in general in might not be up your alley...mouthfeel is very much of a slightly carbonated wine, and does have some bourbon characters. Another interesting brew from dogfish....they always keep me coming back."
"An interesting beer worth the experience but by no means something I'd drink on a regular basis"
"An excellent summer drink with a complex flavor profile that helps hide the higher ABV a little too well. The first time I had this was autumn '05, sitting on a friends' porch while watching a parade of hundreds of runners running a Raleigh road race, glad I was partaking of this fine brew and not doing all that running."
"all in all an awesome brew. paired with a light plate of fruit and cheeses with success."
"This brew poured a clear gold color with a small head. The beer leaves a tiny bit of lace on the glass. Aroma is winey, spicy and I could also pick up some notes of malt on the nose. Taste is very unusual. Grapes, spices, grain and honey were all present in the flavor. The beer was medium bodied in the palate. The finish was fruity, sweet and spicy with a touch of bitterness. At times I felt like I was drinking a beer/wine/mead hybrid. Isn't that the point behind this brew? To sample something that ancient humans may have partaken of? I don't know how close Midas Touch is to the actual product that was inside those unearthed vessels, but it's worth a try just to have something very different. Cheers to Dogfish Head for putting out a very bold product."
"The uniqueness and complexity of this drink gives something beer lovers should try several time before they make up their mind. The background spicyness grows as one drinks this and it contributes to a cap on the number of these one could have in a night. One is ok, two is good, three may be great, but four in a row is likely to many. The carbonation and grapes combine to give this beer a pseudo-wine or champagne like feel. Others have mentioned this beer is good upon occasion, or if one is in the right mood. I think this beer should be approached as if it were a wine or champagne. Any gathering where alcohol is served, but the goal isn't be get trashed is a good time to bring out this beer. There's no way anyone could pound these. They sort of cap themselves, but before you get sick of them, they are really good. Celebrate it's uniqueness at celebrations."
"Not sure what to make of this beer; I don't think I've ever had one this sweet. It was a pretty orange color with a small white head and very bubbly. It had a sweet grainy odor, and a very sweet fruity taste. I thought it to be quite carbonated, and thus not very pleasing in the mouth. The sweetness makes it only average for drinkability."
"This pours a yellow/red straw with a large foamy head. The smell has a honey sweetness to it with a raisin or prune aroma also. The taste is a real treat. It starts out creamy with a real alcohol bite to it. The dark fruit,prune and raisin,flavor is very prevelant with a almost white wine presence make this a sweet beer that is good,but not very drinkable. The m/f is medium with a good malt sweetness that really hides the high alcohol. This is an OK brew,but I don't think I could have more than a couple of these."
"The pour is clear amber with a one finger white head that fades down to a halo. This has a appealing aroma when I'm not getting a nose full of alcohol- white wine, honey, and a ton of spice. The taste is off and on in the same way. In one sip, I'm enjoying the honey, candy-sweet malts, and spices; in an another sip, I get an overly alcoholic cooking white wine. In theory the flavors should join forces to create a nice Riesling taste, but that never happens. All in all, Midas Touch a fun beer to try because of it's unique history, plus it's from a brewery that I'd been wanting to try for a while. Thanks BRoss242!"
"Cheers!"
"In all, this is certainly worth a try. It's a pretty good beer that will wear out its welcome by #2, so stop there. But in that, you can really get some enjoyment with a few to relax with."
"Pours a transparent golden amber, I got virtually no head at all and very little active carbonation...appearance of a hard alcohol such as whiskey.. Nose was very fascinating as it excites the palate with unusual aromas of figs, raisins, white wine, as well as some heavy musk laying in the background. Taste is completely original and very strong, sweetness of honey with tart apple and grape followed with a dry finish which includes plenty of alcohol. The mouthfeel is a bit flat with very little carbonation which is a shame but this is certainly worth a try just for the experience."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is limited by a 9% abv price tag. But the backstory on this ale (check out dogfish.com) makes it worth a try."
"An excellent quality beer!"
"Tastes are quite interesting. They seem to vary from sip to sip. Honey, grapes, alc. saffron? Definitely an interesting beer, and the concept is a good one. However- that being said this is beer made me appreciate all the progress brewers have made since the days of King Midas. Not something I'd seek out again but it's something completely different from anything else I've ever had and for that reason alone I believe it to be worth trying."
"Disappointed."
"Overall: This is an interesting beer, definitely very wine like. It's a neat idea for a beer, and the execution isn't bad. It's almost a little too strong."
"Overall a very diffeent beer. What I had seen on the History channel was that this recipe was taken from scriptures unearthed from a tomb believed to be King Midas's. So no hops. But something to seek out for the adventurous beer afiucionado."
"Beer pours a nice amber golden color. Has a quarter inch head that goes to a film after a while. Smells unlike any other beer I have ever tried with the grapes and saffron noticeable. Taste is also very unique. Has some characteristics of wine, taste of saffron and honey. Very different from other beers I have tired. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected but not that bad. This beer is drinkable but not my favorite."
"D- This beer is very soft and the flavors are very foreign. The notes of grapes are distinct but faint and the malt is very soft aswell. I don't taste a lot of depth but it is and interesting beer and it starts to grow on me after awhile."
"One important note: Even though I find this brew undrinkable, I do appreciate DFH's experimentation. And imagining beer-loving Indiana Jones in search of King Midas' tomb to discover the secret of the ""ancient ale"" is just plain cool! I'll add some extra points to mouthfeel as my way of encouraging DFH's contant search for new and cool ideas in brewing."
"Mouthefeel is kind of one the thin side, but It's one easy to drink beer. It's disappearing before my eyes."
"This is a hybrid beer / mead that is truly an undertaking as only DFH could do...and while it is very good, it leaves one happy to be alive during the current state of beer!"
"This one is definitely worth trying if you are into experimenting with unique styles. I probably wont buy this again, but it was worth my time and money."
"Drinkability- If ever the term sweet and sour would be used for a beer, this would be it. Very interesting style that leaves you wanting another. Tastes like it could be a great poolside beer, or at the same time, be a nice beer by the fire."
"This beer appears a bit cloudy with a soft golden color and just a bit of cream colored head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of honey, grains, bread, and rice come to mind; very unique. The taste is a blend of honey derived sweetness with starch derived bitterness that just rolls over the tongue and leaves behing some nice spice flavors. A bit too dry in the finish for it's texture and components, especially for the alcohol content. The complexity of the flavors was just too much for me to crave more than one of these."
"Cheers!"
"I hadn't had a lot of luck finding Dogfish beers that I would rebuy to this point, but Midas Touch is a very tasty offering and I highly recommend it to people who love sweeter beers with the malts dominating the hops."
"I love Dogfish Head's brews, but I'm going to have to pass on this one the next time I'm at my local store."
"Mouth feel is thick and syrupy with high carbonation levels."
"Drinkability: Overall a nice sweet beer that was very different. I've never tasted anything like this before. An expensive brew that ever beer drinker should try for themselves. This also made a nice representation of my first Dogfish Head brew."
"Drinkability is on a par with mead. I enjoy one when I go the the Renaissance Fair every year, but don't miss it in between. It's sweetness limits it to a single serving, in my book. But it is very enjoyable, if I were more of a wine person, I might enjoy it even more."
"Strange brew this one. Kind of smells like dirty socks as it warms up. Pours a hazy orange yellow color with very little head. Very fine carbonation makes it way up from the bottom of the glass. Taste is hard to describe, initial thoughts were that it was like a combination of beer and white grape juice. In fact, that thought still persists so that's how I'll describe it. I could not drink more than one of these in a sitting. Pretty disappointing for the price really."
"Like I said, I am thrilled to be able to try this ancient reproduction, but it really isn't anything too drinkable, much less good. I didn't expect to like it, but I wanted to try it anyway due to the backstory. Not recommended for anybody but history buffs."
"Music: Judas Priest - Defenders of the Faith"
"Drinkability: This is a very tasty drinkable concoction. This will probably be able to replace wine with a meal. Hell if you have wine snobs over break this one out. This beer will puzzle the hell out of them. I bought two more packs for cellaring purposes."
"Poured a ""sparkly"" honey-golden color. Head was really strange in that is popped and fizzed....yet nearly instantaneously disappeared. Quite strange. Lots of sweetness in the nose, maybe some earthy notes, and spiced grapes. Flavor pulls a lot of the honey flavor out. Malt backbone and grape wine flavors. Sticky sweet aftertaste. Surprisingly thick mouthfeel and good drinkability. A different beer."
"The Midas Touch Golden Elixir might very well be a great crossover beer for introducing your friends to craft beers. It is smooth, very drinkable, and light. Perfect for summer or fall days."
"Overall this is a very sweet little ditty but it just doesnt make the grade when price is factored into the equation."
"A perfect drink for before dinner or with dinner. Poultry seems like it would fair well, and anything with fresh herbs would bring out the best in this sipper."
"I had this with Thanksgiving Dinner, not for complementing flavors, but for a delectible drink on a special occassion. Nevertheless the Midas Touch held its own against spice rubbed turkey, rosemary flavored stuffing, mashed potatos, aromatic sweet potatos, tumeric flavored corn, and pear salad. In fact the unintened Indian-type flavors in the meal really complemented the beer as it warmed up. The only thing that drowned out the flavor of the beer was the cranberry relish."
"M&D At 9% this beer is highly drinkable. First experience with this type, so I have nothing to gauge it against. Worth a try."
"I could definitely enjoy several of these, with something on the dry side in between. The sweetness makes it prohibitive to drink more than one in a row."
"Overall = I'm glad I tried it and it's a very interesting, unique beer from Dogfish. I most lilkely won't buy it again though. It's a little too potent and sweet for me and in its place, I'd rather drink a nice dessert wine or port."
"Pours a dark honey color that is slightly murky with a smooth off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells doughy with a bit of teriyaki? Theres also a bit of citrus and pear but I still get a bit of teriyaki, but not in a bad way. Much maltier than I expected in flavor with noticable alcohol. Theres a plumb flavor that fits well with the maltiness. This beer finishes very well with an almost electric lingering sourness and spice that dances on the tongue. This flavor leaves the mouth with almost chocolate taste to it. Wonderfully complex and dynamic. Very thick mouth feel that is deceptively carbonated. Im thinking this would go well with a smoked gouda. I dont know If Id have two of these in a night, but its a very well done brew."
"It had the aroma of some citrus, somewhat malty hints and sweet fruits. The taste, however, immediately hit me with spices, and a lot of alcohol taste. It wasn't overpowering but definitely there. It started bitter and ended up pleasantly sweet; can truly say it was a taste I had never encountered. It was smooth and refreshing, definiely a beer to be served somewhat chilled. I have to respect the creativity Dogfish Head has and the chances they take in brewing. it often leads to exciting things, this being one of them."
"Oh yeah, and I paid $18 for four of these?! Kill me."
"Nice and flavorful and very drinkable. A good beer, but a bit pricey at $3/bottle."
"An interesting brew, but not sure I would drink it again. I think the honey was a bit overpowering. But definitely glad I tried it once."
"Slick but not overly thick & heavy, the carbonation is next to non-existant. A very tasty sipper."
"drinkability: Definately not a session beer; not due to the alcohol, but to the sweetness and complexity. My taste buds were worn out after this one. Still, it is drinkable in the sense that it is very good."
"The flavor, mouthfeel, and aroma all scream ""too young mead"" to me. It's hot, harsh, and not something I care to drink again. Perhaps cellared for a year or two it would be wonderful. If I ever buy another bottle, it will be with that in mind."
"The beer after its disinterment from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a deep copper color with a modest off white head and the lace a thin veil to conceal the glass. Nose has the aroma of honey, quite sweet with a slight hint of fusel alcohol also a bit grassy, start is sweet with a bountiful grain presence, and the top is moderate in feel. Finish has a determined acidity, the hops pleasantly spicy and the aftertaste dry, alcohol warming noticed, a quite nice beer, as I need a big beer today."
"Drinkabiilty: I would say this is more of a metheglin, with it's strong honey flavors and spiciness. It is a pretty good example of that, but this kind of defies being labelled."
"Hey, I rated it even lower this time around. Ain't that a hoot."
"A unique brew from Dogfish Head. Poured out to a deep, dark gold color with a hint of amber in it. Head was rather short lived, but a very thin layer of foam remained after a minute. No lacing. Medium level of carbonation. Aroma was similar to a Monster Energy Drink; scents of herbs, honey, earth and sweet spice were all present, with only a touch of malt toward the middle. Taste was good, but also different; flavors of buttery fruit, floral notes, and grain were all present and well received; some minor malt and earthy characters were also present. Mouthfeel was good, with a thicker syrup like character present, giving the beer a touch of viscosity. Decent drinkability; this beer is probably not one you'd have more than one of in a sitting, but likely one you'd want to revisit. Recommended."
"Pours a golden amber, slightly cloudy, with a finger of white creamy foam in my chalice fit for a king. Smell is spicy/herbal up front, like baked goods. Taste starts with the spicy cinnamon, nutmeg and subtle clove, very similar to their Punkin' Ale, then belgian pale fruit, ending in a unique saffron tickle. Mouthfeel is crisp and syrupy, but refreshing. An interesting mix of Punkin' Ale spiciness with some unique belgian like notes. I could drink a few but that's about it. More than just a quirky concept, but not transcendent."
"Well, I'm reviewing this DFH offering in my DFH pint glass that I received as a part of a trade about a year ago. Pretty sure I got the glass from Sulldaddy as part of Secret Santa '04. The beer was obtained from Total Beverage. As it just appeared on the shelves there, I'm guessing this was recently brewed by DFH. Pours a one finger mostly white, but partly drab yellow head. The beer itself is a midly cloudy light pumpkin orange with some particulates suspended within. Smells, oh...stingy rough alcohol, pumpkin, sweet malty and sweet esters, some caramel, wax. Tastes sweet esters, sweet amlt, thick body, with a rough alcohol ending. This is a really rich malty beer and I'll bet it would age really well. Said to be brewed with honey, grapes and saffron. I don't see the honey or grapes and I don't know what saffron tastes like. I guess I just get a malty dark flavor with a hint of spicy flower and a late alcohol burn. Thick body and moderate carbonation. An okay beer that needs time for the alcohol to settle and malty sweet to develop."
"John"
"Notes: Wierd beer. One that I definitely don't hate but also don't love. however because it's such a unique flavor I can see having an ""itch"" to drink this every now and then. All in all good, just not the first or second beer I'd pick for the price on most trips to the store."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out a clear copped color. The aroma is candy sweetness with grapes, like the grapes in grape juice. This beer tastes really weird. It took me a while to figure out if I like it or not. It sort of has a cream ale malt flavor that I don't like. It's much stronger than a cream ale, though, and I do enjoy the fruity grape flavor. Some honey sweetness too. This beer isn't great, but it's certainly unique."
"Overall, a bit too sweet (and expensive) for me, but very interesting considering the backstory."
"This brew ours a deep golden honey with a quickly fading head. No lace, Aroma is of grapes and honey, I get more of a green grape juice sweetness to this than the honey. Saffron? couldnt find it or anything that could be considered saffron. Taste is smooth, honey, green grapes and a touch of alcohol. Sticky on the lips and a bit warming in the belly. Be a good winter beer when the cold winds blow. For a high ABV I could enjoy a few of these to sip on while Im lost in T.V land or just chillinTastey"
"Finish is long and lemony sweet. Tasty Can't drink more than one in a sitting tho."
"HOWEVER, this is a singular beer, and it's more worth a shot than most, as this is a rarity for the most part as far as beers like this. Try it, definitely. DFH continues to experiment, and I'll buy anything they put out because they're tenacious, and really, sometimes it seems like they don't give a shit about how everyone's going to take it. And I love that about them."
"Note that Midas Touch is another name for grog. A mix of beer, wine, juice and honey. That's actually pretty much what this is."
"Pours from the 12oz bottle a bright copper color with just a touch of a fizzy white head. Decent carbonation in the form of tiny, tiny bubbles. Interesting aroma - all ingredients stated on the bottle come through, especially the muscat grapes. Hints of saffron, honey, malt, and a general sweetness pervade the nose. Palate is even more interesting. Sweet with honey and grapes, offset slightly by the sweet malt and herby saffron. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky from the honey, but I guess that's to be expected. Big alcohol kick from the start makes this a longtime sipping beer. Nice, and very interesting."
"Beer has no limits. Give this one a shot. If you can, get a single bottle rather than a four-pack."
"I split this with another BA and we had a bit of trouble drinking it. The different taste, texture and high alcohol warrants you from drinking this more than twice a year. This beer was good, but I don't know if I'd reccomend this to everyone."
"Medium bodied, stick-sweet, and almost syrup-like texture. Interesting and tastey, but no more than one in a sitting."
"Thanks to ski271 for the bottle."
"Imbibability: A tasty beer, but the sweetness gets a bit thick near the end of the bottle, to the point that it's trying."
"Drinkability: This is a weird one for sure. Wasnt sure if I liked it at first, but once I knew what to expect, it was much more enjoyable. Its surprisingly smooth and VERY easy drinking, especially considering that its 9%. This is a mood beer, something Id enjoy on a rare occasion, and thats a good thing considering its price. But it was a pleasant break from the norm, and Im glad I tried it."
"This ""beer"" is difficult to rate because it is so strange. Dogfish Head continues too impress me with their creativity though. Shame I can't make it to Bocce."
"Picked up a single 12 oz bottle for 4 bucks. Steep, but my curiosity got to me. Pours a hazy, murky gold with light carbonation. Looks like a big glass of honey, actually. Strong aroma of pure, fermented honey. The fermented, semi-sweet honey is the first and strongest flavor. White grape is next up, with only a bit of malty ale character noticeable in the end. Alcohol warmth is strong and lasting. Seems to be a mead first, then a wine and a beer. More of a braggot than anything else? Bleeding edge weird experimental beer, this is not something you could drink often but is certainly worth a try."
"It's quite a neat drink-thing. It's somewhat mead-like, but more like a braggot with the carbonation and dainty head. Aromas are right on a chardonay with honey and sweet spices. Tastes also chardonay like with more sweetness, corriander, allspice, and some others that I can't describe. High alcohol boarders on phenolic. Quite perfumy and sweetly tart throughout. A well formed experiment. I like it, though only on occasions."
"Drinkability is good goes down smooth and easy, certainly worth a try. But for myself personal wouldn't buy repeatedly for the price."
"Golden-yellow color with no real head but plenty of bubbles, something like a dark champagne. Smells of hops & honey on the nose, strongly and very appealing. Tastes roughly the same with some malts and hoppiness quickly giving away to honey/mead tastes and very decent acidity/feel. Very drinkable for a nine-er and two bottles went missing between ""innocent"" looking friends."
"Another winner from Dogfish Head."
"The aroma is buttery bread with hints of fruit. The taste will surprise you at first. It is spicy like gingerale with a good deal of carbonation. There is a good deal of alcoholic taste in there as well. I found it kind of hard to finish as the alcohol flavor was so high. Definitely not your typical beer."
"Drinkability: Yikes. I wouldn't want more than one of these. It'll put you in a fog if you're not ready for it. I'd recommend this as an after-dinner drink."
"This beer is very different from other beers and just as different from DFH's other brews. It is very much worth the high price and is a great beer for special occasions."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side and this could use a little more body. However, the alcohol is well hidden and this one goes down like water. I could see myself finishing off a four pack quickly...well...probably too quickly at 9%. Another well done experimental brew from Sam & DFH. I hope they keep up the good work."
"the taste was sweetness up front from the grape and honey that finished slightly dry from the alcohol. Very wine like at its essence. very enjoyable but sneaks up on you"
"Kind of a bizarre beer, I had wanted to try it simply because of its background. Pours a light, clear amber, with little head and a little lacing. Smells like I don't know? Dried apricots, malty, earthy, alcohol, and kind of grapy? Very hard to place I thought. Tastes sweet, can taste the alcohol, kind of winish, can taste the grape influence at the end of the sip. Beer was pretty smooth, lots of carbonation and a pleasant mouthfeel. Would maybe try this again however the novelty has worn off, honestly worth a try though, very different. Thanks JoeyC."
"Winey aroma, lace, hoppy plumb white grape content. Alcohol drying that cleas the palate. Meadiness. If I want fruit wine, I will have that. If I want mead, I will obtain that. Apple taste on finish. I guess unique with some dinner. OK, had it. Thanks JoeyC."
"I can barely finish this one. I feel the need to shoot up some insulin by the middle of the glass. Way too much sweets."
"Not sure how to take this beer. I look at it as almost a braggot, mead/beer mix due to the honey in it. It's great that way. Looks like a lightly carbonated, well, mead. Slightly spicy aroma. Can't put my finger on it, probably saffron, except I'm not sure what saffron smells like. Taste is really interesting and well layered. First taste is beer like, slight hop bite there, then a hint of honey. In the aftertaste, I really pick up the sweet muscat grapes. Full mouthfeel, no alcohol burn that I can pick up on. Well put together and interesting at the same time!"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a chalice."
"D&N: A nice beer to try, I don't think I'll be buying a six pack of this anytime soon."
"Tasty, and would never know that it packs the punch that it does; always enjoyed the 750s of it."
"Shared 750ml bottle with fellow ba mtanji. poured a hazy amber color with almost no head. There was absolutely no smell. The taste pretty much mathced the smell because there was no taste either. Mouthfeel was of alcohol. I wonder if this bottle went bad"
"A one finger frothy head sits atop a clear golden honey colored beer. Few streams of carbonation were seen. Aromas detected started with honey, fruit, grapes, spice and a slight sourness. The taste was a complex mixture of malt and spice, wine and candy. A mouthful ends with a nice honey coating on the mouth. Very smooth beer here. A great session beer, but too rich to drink one after another, in my opinion."
"This peer poured a crystal-clear orangish yellow, a bit more, umm, lumiscent than most beers (the saffron?). The aroma is very much like a bock, with some sweet honey notes, with just a hint of grape around the edge giving it a fruit note. The taste is very sweet and meadish, but with the muscat grape having a fairly strong presence (in a good way, unlike, say, Corcorde's Concord Grape Ale), with a dry mouthfeel. It's a fairly pleasant beer, but with a funky enough taste that it's a bit low on the drinkability scale (i.e. one of these is plenty, it'll be awhile before I finish the 4-pack)."
"This is a strange, wild, intriguing beer. It sort of reminds me of a cross between a sweet mead and a bock. The beer pours a cloudy, hazy orange color with a soda-pop head. The aroma is distinctly honey-like, with a strong alcohol background. Also mingling in the smell are fruit and spicesapple, grape, pepper, sugar. The taste is intensely sweet, with a serious honey quality. Its a relatively heavy brew, and I dont think that Id be able to have too many. Its interesting, and worth a try.Its actually pretty good for what it is, but this ones not something Id seek out."
"CHEERS!"
"A chilled 12 oz bottle from a 4 pack label notched Jan. (no year) from Corral Liquors. The color is a pale, slightly hazed orange. The aromas of honey, grape skins, tart sweet white grapes and alcohol spiciness (saffron?). The head dissipated very quickly with some patchy lace. The carbonation is low. Strong nearly astringant alcohol warming on the swallow. This beer merges with wine in its characteristics. Like a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor that cuts beer from wine DFH's sweet Midas crawls, slithering, along the edge of a straight... razor... and survives as a beer. Very little hop or malt flavors present. Super sweet, sugary, honey flavor with roasted earthy grains in the background. Buttery from an high diacetyl but tollerable with the sweetness provided by the grapes. Hops provide a nearly herbal spice - corriander and citrus. The aftertaste is dry, tart, and crisp. A moderate-to-full body with 9% abv, but drinkable if you like sweet liquids. Suggest you try one from tap or just a single bottle. Many reviewers have asked to have the curse of the Midas touch removed finding it too overwhelming."
"Probably the closest thing I've had to a mead. I didn't really notice to much in the way of grapes, but this beer seemed busy enough as is. Interesting, glad I tried it, but not one I'll look for."
"For me, drinkability is low, but I am not a huge fan of spiced beers...I am glad I gave it a try and would try it again if I found it on tap."
" The color is very nice, a very rich honey appearance that sprouted a light, bubbly head that faded to a circle around edge. Slightly cloudy. The aroma is less sweet than I was anticipating. The flavor is kind of earthy with subtle fruit notes. I find this beer to be very much drinkable although not a session beer. Very unique and definetly worth a try. Yet another big beer from DFH."
"This one poured a light copper color with a small off white head that fell to a ring around the glass. Smells like bread and honey, a good combination. The distince flavor of honey and alcohol at the start, then a nice malty near the end, and finally a bit of hop bite to cap it off. The mouthfeel is pretty decent, with good carbonation and smooth feel. This beer is fairly drinkable. I would enjoy drinking this one again."
"The appearance is a very beautiful hazy copper with a very thin head. The aroma is pleasant and has a strong rotting fruit backbone. I can also smell the phenols with a belgian touch. The taste is strange, but enjoyable. There is a sour start, followed by a candied sugar taste. The honey really shines at the end of the sip. The only bad thing about this beer was the burning sensation left on my tongue. It almost felt raw after a few sips. Either way, I can't let that deter me from saying this is one interesting beer that everyone should try to experience. I don't know if I would be buying this by the bottle in the future, but I would like to try it on tap."
"D-only problem here. High ABV and not a style where you want more than one."
"at 1st taste I thoght I wasted 13.00 for this 4 pack and as the beer warmed we got to be friends. poured golden amber with no head. aroma honey, grapes alcohol, white wine, fruity. flavor honey, fruity, alcohol very strong, had to check bottle to make sure I was drinking beer and not wine this would go well with stir fry chicken. as it warmed the flavors blended nicely."
"Not a bad beer to sip, but not particularly compelling either. At 9%abv, I don't think it would make a particularly good session brew."
"Drinkability: It's interesting enough to keep taking sips of as one decides what it is exactly that is being tasted. I couldn't imagine drinking a six pack, or even a four pack as DFH packages them. It's an interesting beer, or something close to beer. I'd reccommend everyone try one, so they can reference other obscure styles by it (gruit seems rather similar)."
"Pours pale orange (shouldn't something named Midas be gold, at least?) under a very thin 1/3 finger off white head that fizzles as quickly as it forms. Purely from the appearance, it reminds me of some pretty bad Russian beers of the Zhigulovskoye line. The nose is, well, distinctive: grape and malt, with a touch of spice (I assume that's the safron) and slightly sour. These are not good images here. The mouth is very prickly and quite thick/heavy, presumably from the fruit juice. Taste? Oh my. Grapes and safron are definitely noticeable, sweet and sour, almost like grape juice on drugs. There's definitely malt here, and even a dash of coniferous hops that lends a dry bit element to the finish, but this tastes and feels much more like a mead than a beer. Not a very good mead either. Glad I got just one, as I couldn't bring myself to finish even that much."
"I was very much looking forward to this Dogfish offering, many good things I have heard. It poured with a big inconsistent head that was quick to dissipate and a beautiful amber body. The honey malt aroma is enticing to say the least. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth and seductive, leaves you yearning. The honey and saffron walz together on the palate in perfect fashion. From the mouthfeel to the finish is magnificent. A grape wine-like flavor kicks in while the taste buds continue to be pulled in several different directions. Absolutely a winner, what a beer!"
"12 oz. bottle, packaged in month 6 according to the notch. Pours a slighlty hazy orange, with a white thick head. The head disappeared almost immediately. Some tiny bubbles still coming from the bottom of the glass. Not much lace. Smells like a white wine. Grapes, slight spicy and earthy smell. Very sweet up front from the honey. As it warms, a bit more of the spicy flavors come out. Very thick on the palate, but fairly low carbonation. Not much bitterness here, mostly honey sweetness. An interesting experiment. Not something to have all of the time. Suffers in drinkability. Still, worht a try."
"Very drinkable at a respectable 9.0% ABV. Another winner from Dogfish Head."
"Pours a nice golden color with a head that barely hangs around to say hello. Aroma is immdiately interesting. Strong honey aroma but i also detect a lot of that grape fruitiness with some faint spice sneaking up from behind. Taste is a marvel. A lot of grape flavor mixed with a bit of honey which is all backed up by a warm alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. I can only drink 1 bottle of this a night but I have a feeling I'll be coming back often as i always try to pick up a 4 pack when I head down to Jungle Jim's in Cincy."
"Pours hazy medium amber with very minute head that swirls around like a little galaxy in your goblet (if you're using a goblet). Immediately, the intense smells of honey and spice emanate from the brew. Very nice and sweet! Taste did not match the smell. Even still, mainly honey and grapes are maintained in the taste along with some spice (I assume is saffron from the label). It is very sweet for a beer, seems a bit meadish to me (which I greatly enjoy). Mouthfeel is very nice, creamy, and consistent. A pleasure to drink. But, I could barely finish one, let alone have another. It's a bit too intense for just slugging down a few."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The carbonation helps diffuse the syrupy feel increasing the beers drinkability. This beers honey syrup notes mimic the characteristics of a Barleywines malt character."
"The beer pours a clear golden color with about a finger and a half of head that drops quickly to cover the beer with a nice ring around the top. I can really smell the honey and the grape in the nose, sweet from the honey and spicy from the grape. There is definately more of a honey flavor that I expected from the nose. It overpowers the grape easily, leaving me wanting a bit more. As I let the beer warm, the honey falls to the back and the spicy grape comes through more. Much better. The beer is nice and thick in my mouth, but the honey is again what dominates the mouthfeel. I'm just not that crazy about this much honey outside of a mead. I don't think I would want to have a full big bottle of this or a full 4 pack. I'm glad I went with the single 12oz-er. I think this is a beer worth trying once, but much more than that is probably overkill."
"Medium bodied. Weird but interesting for awhile, nice to try but I wouldn't get it again."
"I ended the day quite pleased with my find. This was, I will admit, not the easiest thing in the world to drink 750 ml of by one's self. But no one ever said science was going to be easy..."
"Clear orange with a substantial cap of white foam. Head fades rapidly and leaves just a touch of head. Aroma is sickly sweet with a spicy, herbal note. Flavor is sweet and all the ingredients make an appearance. Mouthfeel is good, but sadly the flavor is really unbearable. I really wanted to like this beer because the concept is beyond cool. Sadly it seems there is a reason the recipe was lost for thousands(?) of years."
"A bit too sweet considering the 9% abv. I just can't see drinking more than one in a night, but that's not stopping me for giving dogfishhead the nod for such a creative concoction. I would definitely recommend this just based on the uniqueness."
"A bit hazy. Melon orange and rich, dark gold in color. Intense spiciness. Incredibly aromatic -- floral, honey, golden raisins (wrong DFH beer, I know; but it's there, I'm sure of it), and pulverized, dilluted plum skin lending a mouth-wateringly unripe sort of fragrance. Definitely alcoholic. A big sweetness. Honey and exotic spices. I suppose that characteristic aroma and flavor I can't put my finger on might be the saffron that this is brewed with. Very much a sensory overload sort of beer. Sheer experimentation. While not all that subtle, it's fascinating stuff."
"Beer is good. Happy strong spicey beering."
"Definately worth trying, both because of the history, and because it's so out of the ordinary."
"I've had this beer in a 750 mL bottle for 2 years now, but have been afraid to open it, because they weren't making it anymore, so I was ecstatic to these in a 4 pack that could be easily sampled with no guilt. I have to say this is some intriguing brew."
"This pleasant historical recreation pours golden and forms little head. the grape and grain aroma is interesting but not all that exciting. I really enjoyed the flavors mingling mead and wine as there were string grassy notes, grape skin and dry wine flavors - all brought together with diacetyl. There is an alcohol presence giving the beer a light and dry mouth feel. It's enjoyable, and drinkable - but not something that I would routinely pour for my self. I would break it out at dinner parties."
"Orangey copper color with a thin white head that starts out low and quickly drops. Very clear, with thin rows of tiny bubbles rising up. Aroma is light, consisting of hops and honey. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a little tingle toward the back of the tongue. Flavor is semi-sweet, with notes of corn and honey, and a bit of butterscotch. Some white wine notes in the finish, probably from the muscat grapes, but not too overpowering. A sweet malt flavor lingers. Not as complex as I hoped, but it gets better as it warms. Even so, there's a part of me that can't help thinking that this tastes a little like Budweiser with sugar added."
"It wasn't a bad drink, just not what I expected. Quite refreshing, makes a great dessert."
"Not very good in my book. An interesting brew, but thank god for hops. The mouthfeel is sickening and urges me not to finish this bottle. But I must, I must, for the love of the beer gods. I would only ever drink this with another beer geek. Big does not equal better."
"It is difficult to pigeon hole this beer in a specific style. It is interesting in that it has a little bit of everything. It has an orange gold color with a slight haze. The aroma is fruity, winey, perfumey and the saffron is evident. The body is coating, almost syruppy with some grape and malt character evident. It finishes with a slight spice. Not bad. It is different from anything that I have ever had. I'm not sure there are many occasions to drink this beer/mead/wine, but it is something that I'm glad I tried."
"The mouthfeel is of thick malt and is slightly syrupy. Slightly dry aftertaste that has a mild citrus bite. Very unique brew, and I definitely want to try this again."
"large champagne bottle, with cork and cage. Pours cloudy orange/golden. Nice nose of fruit, wine, raisins. Lovely soft flavors of fruit, wine, grapes, spice,pepper. Buttery mouthfeel, tastes similar to a saison to me. with the spice and earthyness of the flavors. Interesting beer. Vinious notes, grape skins etc. Dogfishhead continues to amaze. Innovaters and risk takers. Try their beers, visit their locations and be thankful for em!"
"Quite an interesting attempt at resurrecting a bit of history. I am duly impressed by any brewery that is willing to take the risk to brew beers like this on a regular basis."
"How often do you get to drink of ancient history? Yes it is cloyingly sweet, but there's considerable depth in it's flavor elements, and memorable for its historical context. The dense honey sweetness is no surprise in a big DFH beer, nor is the substantial ABV, but they do limit this beer somewhat. The blend of flavors make it palatable, but that alcohol, and the fact it sips more like a cordial than a beer, seriously truncate how much you'd want. Sure, it is a curiosity, but it's also one more intriguing experiment from the first state's gutsy brewery. And I'm glad I tried it."
"This beer is a unique treat, and the historical mystique behind it (if a bit conjectural) makes drinking this that much more interesting. I'm only disappointed that I waited so long to try this."
"My buddies and I saw Dogfish Heads Midas Touch and it looked very apealing to us. It came in a 4 pack and was high priced at $10.99 but we decided to try it anyway and it paid off. This stuff has to be the smoothest and best tasting beer ive had, stouts excluded...theyre pretty smooth. Midas Touch has a nice honey flavor which is probably why it is at 9%. I had this beer about 6 months ago and seeing it on this site again i am going to get another 4 pack tonight just because how good it is. Iv noticed that Dogfish Heads beer seem to be kind of harsh tasting and insaine but this is their best work. cheers to brewer/owner Sam Calagione"
"This is a beautiful color, a true amber with a wonderful glow. The head isn't as impressive, an off white, on the small size, but a thin layer lingers and it laces nicely. Very winey aroma, a bit earthy, but not a lot else. The flavor is really nice. Light caramel, late summer grapes (especially of the scuppernong/muscadine variety) and honey. Light sweetness, but not too sweet. I really like this. It's definitely interesting. Makes me think of late summer for some reason."

"Drinkability: A very interesting brew, both from a historical and flavor standpoint. Nothing to drink on a regular basis, but definately good to have around. A surprisingly good beverage."
"12oz. bottle: This one poured a dark golden color, with just a hint of haze to it. There was absolutely no head to it at all, and I even tried halfway through the pour to make one. The aroma is sweet and a bit spicy. Possibly floral and grape notes also. The taste is fairly sweet and almost a little syrupy. Definite grapes and honey in there. The sweetness lingers a bit in your mouth. Very interesting, and very good! I love it when these guys push the envelope!"
"Pours a nice amber color with a slight haze and some white particles drifting around the glass. Medium sized head on top that reduces quickly to a thin lace on the surface. Lots of carbonation rising to the surface. Wonderfully complex aroma. Malty and fruity grapes are apparent, and a bit of apple is also noticeable. I can detect some spice on the nose. It may be the saffron that is mentioned on the label, but I never would have know if it wasnt on the bottle. A touch of floral hops and alcohol are also in the aroma. Palate, like the nose, seems to be quite complex. Theres a smooth sweet slightly malty start shortly followed by fruity flavors. Some sweetness and smoothness is also added by the honey. Grapes and grape skins are quite noticeable, and Im still detecting a touch of apple. The finish is sweet, yet is also slightly hoppy and fairly tart. The malt comes through a bit more again in the aftertaste. Theres a bit of a warming sensation as this brew goes down. Full mouth feel with a nice carbonation. Great brew that is pretty complex and definitely unique. Im finding it a bit tough to piece together all the flavors in this review. It would probably make for a nice desert beer and is certainly a nice change of pace."
"Cloudy orange colored beer pours with a minmal amount of white foam. The aroma is very earthy, and reminds me of wild honeycomb right out of the hive. Taste is very sweet, with a strong honey notes. Also a hint of grape jelly. A slight graininess and earthy overtone are evident on the finish. Mouthfeel is rather full. Drinkability is OK, but this beer seems very filling. This is a unique beer. One bottle was enough."
"This beer has a looong finish an great mouthfeel. It hangs around your mouth for a while and reminds you how good it is. The buttery honey taste and a malty backbone keep it balanced. A stupendous effort, but like a rich dessert, I wouldn't consume one after another. One at a time is plenty for me."
"This beer poured a honey/orange/reddish color, I assume the color was somewhat influenced by the use of saffron. It was fairly clear with a slight chill haze to it. Decent carbonation. The head that was produced was of a butter cream/tan color that when first poured rose and stayed for a time before it fell to a ring on the edges. Its body was cloud like fluffy. There was some lace present. The aromas were different then I expected, sweet, honey and grapes dominated the aroma with hints of spices (allspice), saffron, light herbs and alcohol. The tastes were fairly simple, flavors of honey, and alcohol hit you first, then sweet malts, followed by some dark fruit and apricot, and sweet grapes, then as it left my mouth hints of saffron and wine were left. The aftertaste was fairly faint, mostly sweet honey and wine. The body was medium. Once warm it became thicker, creamier and slightly sweeter in the mouth. A pleasure to drink and would drink again on a cool night. Enjoyable served cold and a punch as it warmed, which I enjoyed. Better to let it warm a few degrees."
"Drinkability  Plan on drinking this just as you would a bottle of white wine and youll be fine. Pour it in a tulip glass, dont let it warm, and drink it with fish or chicken or something light."
"This is all over the place when you go through it, for me, it is rather hard to really narrow down for a review. While I would not have this all the time, it is def worth trying, and enjoying. Cheers!"
"12 oz bottle with freshness date on label. Reviewing a DFH is never boring, and this one is no exception. Pours a slightly hazy honey amber. No head worth noting, even with an aggressive pour. Label says it contains barley, honey, white muscat grapes, and saffron. Aroma is, of course, complex and confusing. Honey, grapes, vague spices, and many other fruits to confound the nose. Mouthfeel is thick and somewhat vinous. Taste is fruity sweetness upfront, with apples, apricots, and grapes. Sweet caramel and honey also jump into the deluge. Spiciness, alcohol, and a touch of floral hops provide the balance. Surprisingly drinkable for a big beer. I am really developing a fondness and appreciation for DFH, for their bold endeavors in experimental brews and pushing the envelope. This one is, definitely, worth trying."
"Drinkability: Very good for this truly remarkable beverage. Not an everyday beer, but great for a special treat."
"Midas Touch is very different and a touch strange, but I like it. It's a lot like a mead, with the important distinction that I can actually drink this. Midas would be an excellent dessert brew, used similarly to a sweet, full-bodied dessert wine. Definitely worth a try, though I'm sure not everyone will like it."
"I think the recipe needs some work."
"Poured a dark honey color with no noticeable head. Plenty of effervescence, though. The smell is flowery, cidery, and it makes for no misgivings about its potency. Bit of earthiness to it, very pleasant. The taste is a vertiable explosion on the pallate - very complex. Sweet honey, herbal notes, almost a trappist-like dark fruitiness, but sweeter. Exceptionally tasty. Mouthfeel is very sweet, and the carbonation level is very very fine. Very tasty beverage, and a welcome change."
"Midas Touch will probably not please the hardcore beer traditionalist - a group to which I do not belong. But what from DFH will? Personally, I LOVE this stuff. You should drop the $5 for this brew just to experience the incredible tastes that this one offers."
"This does not even make it as a novelty beer, best to avoided at all costs."
"Drinkability: An interesting experiment. Availability in 12 oz bottles (I was lucky to be able to get a single) should help get this one tried. ABV & sweetness limit prolonged consumption. Great conversation piece or gift for an archeology buff."
"Pours a clear golden color with orange hues. White head forms quickly, but doesn't stick around. Mostly white grapes with honey thrown in. You almost forget this is even a beer. There is so much flavor in here that suggests mead or white wine. A lot of sweetness. Overall, it was enjoyable and a good cross-over beverage for wine drinkers, but not something I would make a habit of drinking."
"The man at the beer store was correct, this is a rather interesting brew. If you are expecting a typical malty or hoppy beer this is not for you. But if you enjoy trying every beer you can get your hands on grab one of these. Just try one though, it is very possible that you wont like this one."
"Barely any head to speak of. Good taste up front, but it is too sweet (fruity?). It really lowers its drinkability. But then again, I'm not sure what I was expecting. I would definitely try this again, and I would recommend getting it again. Avoid the expensive 4-pack and try to but this one at a time. There is a high liklihood you won't like this. But you will definitely find this interesting."
"In the end, I see this as a good offering from this brewery. I don't know that they should be charging $10/four pack for it, but it's good, and I'm glad I picked up a single."
"Midas Touch is wonderful! I love the idea that they got the recipe from King Midas' tomb, it was a great move for history and beer. The color is great, being a dark orange or red-amber color, and I just have to smile when I start pouring. I'm a sucker for sweetness, and this is sweet! The taste isn't sickeningly sweet, though, tasting a lot like spiced wine mixed with beer. Strong and thick, it makes me feel nice and warm inside!"
"Midas Touch pours with a deep amber/orange color with small head that dissipates soon after being poured. Midas is extremely sweet with prounced tastes of grapes and honey with an aftertaste of spiced apples, very similar to a hard cider. A very enjoyable drink especially after learning the fabled origin of the beer. Congrats to Dogfish Head for taking the chance and brewing something so unique."
"The feel is full, creamy and a bit syrupy. The finish is a bit surprising in that this is drier than I expected from the intial tastes. Not a beer that you'd drink often or have multiples bottles of, this is more of a complement to special meals, rather like wine. A good brew for occasions."
"I respect Dogfish Head for making this beer and trying something completely different. However, somewhere from King Midas to the 21st century something much have been lost in the translation."
"Pours with quick fizzle of head maybe lasts 10 seconds and is a dark yellow color with a cloudy haze. Smells of fresh grapes and alcohol with a tad bit of grain coming to the nose. Tasted initially of grape juice that had been watered down. A slight bit of malts accompanied by floral flavors show threw in a somewhat thin mouthful. No real bitterness comes across the palate but it is not cloyingly sweet. Interesting to say the least and is quite good."
"Deep orange color. Large orange white foamy head. Aroma is fruity, grape-ish and fairly sweet. A medium bodied ale. It a very interesting tasting beer. Malts are sweetish. No hops. There is a grape-like and ciderish quality to this beer. It has touches of orange (Muscat) honey and spices. Im not really sure I would call this a beer if I were handed some in a blind tasting. It has some of the qualities of a late harvest desert wine and some of a dry cider. It has an interesting origin, and I will always try this kind of beer. I applaud brewers who are not afraid to try different things, and this is one thats out there. It is definitely worth trying. Very little of the 9% alcohol is evident in the taste. Light and refreshing, fruity and smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and dry. Aftertaste is sweet and appleish."
"Overall it's a very interesting beer. Not something I'd go after everyday, but I honestly enjoyed it quite a bit. Fruit, honey, safron, it's a little weird, but imo, a yummy beer."
"Bought a 12 oz. single before I could read the previous reviewers final warnings - oh well. Poured a fizzy orangish color with not much head at all. Aroma similar to a barley wine, a sweet candy apple alcohol scent, along with a grape juice aroma and a hint of spice. I noticed surpisingly little taste until I had swallowed - Maybe just a little grape sweetness on the tip of my tongue. However, after swallowing it was a very soft, smooth sweet finish, with the grapes again being the dominant flavor. Although I do agree with the previous reviewer that this was like a soda, I was satisfied with the way it tasted. It was just very subtle in its ways, and I noticed no apparent alcohol besides the slight touch of sweetness. If it weren't for the high price on these puny little 4-packs I would buy more. In my opinion this was better than average."
"NB: Avoid the 12oz. bottles in particular. Although marginally sweeter, they are much harsher and overtly alcoholic."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light honey color with one finger of head that dies quickly. There is no lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of ginger, honey, and malty sweetness. There is a little bit of fruitiness to the smell. The taste is also malty and sweet with honey, saffron, and a bit of alcohol. There is a bit of hops to the finish. The mouthfeel was fairly strong. The drinkability is fairly nice for a 9% brew. Very unique and very good."
"This one poured hazy into the glass with almost no head bad almost sickening aroma. An almost grotesque taste was accompanied by an even worse aftertaste. I had this one at a tasting with my friends I wasn't the only Unhappy customer It almost killed the whole night!"
"The beer poured a hazy gold color with almost no head. This did not impress me at all. The aroma was horrible. It smelt cidery. The taste was also bad. It tasted syrupy. There seems to be little complexity. It boasts a 9%abv.. The mouthfeel was lacking. This is a full bodied beer. No very drinkable."
"Definitely a good beer to start the holiday weekend with.A small sized creamy ivory head that consisted of fine-small sized bubbles that fully diminished.The body was cloudy and uncarbonated.The hue was a dull orange and the lacing was fair.The nose was that of grape and some fruit along with a bitter, tart, alcohol and malt flavor.The mouthfeel was smooth, tingly and medium bodied."
"Pours to a copper-orange color with a thick tan head. The aroma is super strong of sweet raisins and grapes. It also has an aroma that I cant figure out; possibly the saffron. The flavor has the sweetness of the raisins and grapes up front. The body is light-medium and smoothly sweet. It is light compared to its strength. It is almost wine-like in its sweetness. Avery tasty, complex brew. Another good beer by Dogfish Head."
"Smelled of grapes, cumin (though its really saffron) - hard to detect much else because of these. Taste was sweetly of white grapes, lightly syrupy (from the honey?), but dissappeared. Then a strange herby spice flavor from the saffron came on. Not much else. Couldnt detect alcohol at all. With a softly dry finish, nice easy mouthfeel, its different but not compelling."
"Other comments: Not certain what temperature to serve this at. Muscat wines are generally served bone cold, beer and mead less so. I'd recommend chilling it to almost freezing and see how the taste develops as it warms for kicks. Another interesting and genre bending/breaking brew from Dogfish Head."
"From one of the now-rare 750 ml clear bottles, this pours a glowing apricot hue with a fairly frothy white head which retains much better than expected. Leaves patches of lace down the glass. The nose is of mild sweetness, fruit (notably the muscat grapes), honey, and alcohol. Very interesting. The taste is where this beer gets most interesting, as it's possible to detect every ingredient listed on the label. The main flavor here is upfront, sweet honey, followed by notes of graininess, wine-like muscat grapes, mild saffron, and an alcoholic finish. Sweetness dominates, however. Mellow carbonation gives way to a smooth, syrupy mouthfeel overall. Not an overly drinkable brew, but one I'll sample again. Seemingly, only Dogfish Head makes beverages like this. A classy effort."
"Wow this is something different,pours a nice hazy copper/orange color with real nice sticky head that stays for quite awhile,a pretty sweet aroma of honey with a slightly tart tinge to it.Taste is pretty sweet to begin with a litle spiciness lingers.A pretty complex beer,very well made.Dogfish Head likes to try different things and for the most part are sucessfull."
"I didn't know what to expect upon sipping this, and I must say now that I have that it is indeed unique. Slightly sweet, fruity, malty, and has a woody character...and Dogfish Head makes no effort to hide the alcohol! This is not a bad thing, but you know the alcohol at 9% is there. This would pair well with a meal, as wine does well, and I would like to have it try it that way. This is not a beer I could drink much of, but it's pretty tasty and certainly is unique. My numbers for this beer are not that high, but beer lovers should give this one a try. It rates high on the ""uniqueness"" scale."
"Great, great stuff, and the 9% really hits your head so drink slowly and enjoy."
"Amazing creation and just another reason that DFH gets my vote as the most revolutionary American brewery that I have experienced. Appears a hazy golden orange with an orangish peach tint to the mammoth head that leaves a decent amount of trickled lacing. Aroma contains slightly musty grape notes with a big aroma of alcohol to the nose along with a sharp pleasant honey richness to it. Taste has a wine like finish very sweet rush with slight hints of spice and honey. Very good but doesn't tie it all together for me, I may just not be into mead. Mouthfeel has high carbonation with that bubbly mouthfeel and it's all contained in this light to medium bodied slight syrupy rich consistency. Drinkability is desireable especially seems it would pair well with some good mediterranean style food, but the 9% abv doesn't allow this beer to be one for session drinking."
"Originally sampled on 29 September 2002. Honey colored w/ a lemon chiffon colored head. Has an aroma of a Chardonnay, w/ a slightly sweet taste. It's alcohol isn't hidden at all. It's Very different. I actually liked it. Big thx to ARMed for supplying it."
"Not something I'd have every day, but something different for a special occasion. Definitely a conversation piece, and the 9% ABV will loosen some tongues, as well!"
"Pours a clear sparkling golden color with a tall white head that fades into a good amount of lace at first that eventually completely vanishes. Nose is sweet honey, barley, saffron, and a bit of perfume. Fairly full in body with a texture similar to a buttery chardonnay. Taste is very complex with flavors of raw honey, sweet grapes, and saffron followed by some tart acidic notes. There is a touch of alcohol, but overall the 9% ABV is very well hidden. This is one of the most unique drinks I have had, and it certainly has a remarkable story behind its creation. A marvelous brew and truly a golden elixir. Purchased from Vintage Cellar."
"Pours a golden honey color with some slight carbonation and a small head that turns into white lacing around the rim of my glass. The aroma is very sweet and alcoholic, rather inviting, with a plum scent. VERY warm going down, the alcohol is not masked here. Not a great taste, but LOTS of taste. Honey, pears, apples and plums detected, with alcohol vapors filling the sinuses. Quite syrupy but there is enough carbonation to make for a decent mouthfeel. Considering I was expecting a novelty beer this is fairly drinkable. While not my favorite beer by any means, I love the adventurous spirit. Beers like this should come around more often."
"The most interesting beer I've ever experienced. The story is worth trying the beer for alone (read the story behind it if you're not familiar with it). This beer pours a cloudy amber/orange color and doesn't create much head no matter how it's poured. There is no lacing from this beer. The aroma is very odd, containing scents of honey, alcohol and some spices. The beer is very thick - much more thick than a wine or something, but surprisingly drinkable for the pouring characteristics. I want to classify the taste as a mix between good beer and good champagne - that becomes a fairly good tasting result. I couldn't drink more than a few pints of this at a time, but the story of the beer makes the taste even more interesting than it would normally be. My hat is off to Dogfish Head for coming up with this one - it is indeed one of a kind."
"**Update** This stuff definately loses character in 12oz bottles. The aromas are subdued and the taste is definately ""less fresh"". Stick with the 750's for this one!"
"Flavor is sweet and malty. The spices and bitterness are kept in the distant backround as sweet malts and honey are the major contributers on the tongue. Aftertaste gets fruity and very sweet like maracino cherries (sp.). The alcohol is almost completely hidden, but you can pick it up just a little bit. This is a fine brew that is good for any season. Thanks again to Miller, my fellow sampler for this one."
"Acquired via trade. Pours a foggy orange color with a medium off-white head. Very little lacing. Very sweet aroma of grapes, honey and peach. The flavor is crisp and sweet, and there are really no hops to speak of. Tastes of honey, herbs and spices. Finish is rather dry. Definitely unique."
"Ok, the bottle was cool, with the little story and all, so I admit it, this hooked me on buying it. Really, it looked pretty similar to Bud Light, but maybe a shade darker. I got no head what so ever either. I figured if it was good enough for Midas, then it was good enough for me. It actually tasted like a light mead, but with a little more fruit in it. Had a smooth finish, but had a little bit of an alcohol aftertaste to it, but not too bad."
"Interesting is all I can really say. To bring back a beer that has beed dead for thousands of years; wow! Served to me honey colored with no head whatsoever. Tastes of honey and that's gotta be saffron. I bought a cup because I knew that there would be never another chance for me to try this on tap (and for so cheap as the bottles run up to $15.) I'm glad I had this. This is a very unique beer. I'm glad that there are brewerys like Dogfish out there that will take a risk like this with a beer."
"This is only available in 750 ml bottles. It pours a clear, gently sparkling, deep orange-ish amber body with a creamy yellowish head that drops shortly but keeps a decent collar and leaves some minor spotty lace. Sweet, and almost candyish grapes (like Concord grapes) sweep across the nostrils accompanied by a distinct honey-ish character. It's very mead-like with some alcohol and a slightly herbal note. The aroma is interesting; not really welcoming, but not off-putting either. The full body is enhanced by a fine and moderate carbonation that caresses the tongue. The flavor is most reminiscent of a mead, but also like a fortified wine; and it even has some sherryish notes. There's not much beer character to it, but I think the malt component helps to add to the body; and also softens the alcohol component. Definitely interesting, althought I view it as more of a wine or mead than beer. The high alcohol helps to keep the sweetness from becoming cloying, but it had its drawbacks - most importantly a lacquer-like quality. Still, fairly well done for what it is."
"The whole premise behind this drink (a combination of a mead, wine & beer) is really innovative. Poured a golden tan in color with a white head. Aroma consisted of honey, grapes and saffron. Mouthfeel was smooth. Taste had hints of fermented honey, grapes and alcohol. Alcohol is not overpowering at all and flavors seem to balance well within this complex elixir. Congratulations again to Dogfish head for pushing the envelope and coming up with something truly unique."
"Well, a look back in time to ancient brews and brewing methods. When served cold, it had a very distinctive nearly caramel quality that reminded me strongly of Victory's Ol' Horizontal Barleywine Ale. While not altogether bad, it wasn't altogether good either. Letting it set awhile so it could come close to room temperature was the midas touch it needed to really shine. The caramel receded, to be replaced by a more balanced ale flavor, vaguely reminiscent (as has been already noted) like mead. While I liked it well enough, I think this is more of a ""tasting"" beer than a ""drinking"" beer for me. As always, your mileage may vary. Kudos for Dogfish Head for being so experimental in bringing this brew to market."
"Great stuff, and reminds me of the best Belgians I've enjoyed."
"This beer poured a dark gold color and formed a nice foamy white head that left circular lace as it subsided. A good deal of carbonation is present. An aroma of honey, grapes and spices. A flavor of honey and grape. Buttery finish. Not bad for an experimental beer."
"Opaque and thick yellow tan color, head settles at 1/4 of an inch after some early action.  Grapey nose, like a grape soda,  with a cheesy up smell.  Thick mouthfeel, sense of grapes, honey thickness as a mellowing agent and some molasses flavors.  Little balance.  Saffron gives it a weird color.  Since everything but the kitchen sink is thrown in this brew, maybe this does approximate ancient recipes with its thick Meade-like sweetness.  OK, I suppose...I'll pick up another bomber the next time I get an invite to a pagan ritual.  Kind of insipid."
"This is a very experimental brew. Very similar to Mead but much better. I have never been a big Mead fan. Too sweet for my tastes and so is this. Very candy like tastand very similar to a heavier dessert white wine. I could not have more than one."
"Orange in color with little head and a lot of carbonation.  You can definitely taste the muscat grapes they use in here and not much else.  For what it is, I really enjoyed it as a beverage.  The only reason I would dock it points is if I knew there were going after a certain style and did not follow specs.  Very interesting and worth a try, especially if you enjoy dessert wines."
"Pours with a yellow head.  Golden orange in color with little bubbles.  Smells of honey and grapes.  Sweet grape /honey taste.  Totally different than anything that you have ever tasted in a beer.  They drank this 2,700 years age at a grand funerary feast and it is as unique as the history it represents.  Not an everyday beer (mead) but a nice trip back in history."
"A nice golden-orange clored brew with plenty of apparent carbonation.  It has a thick, rocky, white head.  Solid head retention, with residual lace almost completely coating the glass.  Smells and tastes like a mild mead.  Grape comes through somewhat in the taste & smell, mixing with a slightly yeasty aroma.  Very smooth and easy drinking beer.  Overall, a bit too mead/wine-like to become a regular, but a good brew for a change of pace."
"This one was a bit much by itself, but would be superior escorting some grub.  I Dig it.  Drink at sight. Cheers!"
"Gold...frothy 1 1/2 inch head...nose is wine like...grapes and some mustiness...sweet, wine cooler like taste...unique but not beer-like....some honey sweetness and smoothness emerges...everything the bottle lists is here, but not a true beer...good...I wouldn't call it a beer but it's decent....very easy drinking for the alcohol load...all these badasses do is make high alcohol beers don't they???...I'd hate to party with these f'ers.."
"This beer is golden with orange highlights.  Nice head.  Nice retention.  Sweet aroma.  Honey.  Smells like a braggot.  This beer tastes fairly bland to me.  There are some sweet honey tones.  The impressive thing about this beer is that it is 9% a/v.  If you want an easy drinking high a/v beer, this is it.  Dangerously smooth and easy drinking.  Personally, there is not enough complexity in the taste for me to sample this one very often.  (Especially given the price.)"
"This beer was to say the least,Interesting.Nice gold amber in color.Sight head with fine champagne bubbles.Light nose of tart grapes.The first taste is a little tart then comes the honey and barley,You can't go into this beer with the thought that it is like any beer you have ever tasted.Great beer/wine/mead to be sipping on in the summer."
"This brew was a bit different than I expected.  I was looking for a strong malty brew with a harsh alcohol character and a finish to take paint off the family vehicle.  What I found was a hazy golden pouring with a thick foamy off-white head. with a complex aroma of musky grapes and slight hint of alcohol.  The first taste uncovered a complex heavy grape and honey sweetness with a musky oaky finish.  This concoction was very smooth for teh alcohol content and is reminiscent of a fine aged wine.  Nice work."
"Luminous hazy orange.  Bright white head.  Citrusy aroma, slightly winey like Chardonnay.  Alcohol perceived in nose.  Nice effervescent flavor, tight carbonation.  Could serve as a great replacement for champagne.  Slight Belgian yeast flavor.  Creamy and smooth throughout.  Very dry, wheaty finish."
"Unique - gotta' admire Dogfish Head for taking a shot at reproducing an ancient grape/barley/honey ale.  Not like anything I've run across before.  The aroma is that of wine, or a wine flavored malt beverage like cold duck.  First sip was sweet and very wine-like.  Only at the end did any hint of malt slip in.  I was not terribly taken with this at first, but as it warmed, the malt became more noticeable (but the grapes never gave much ground).  At about room temperature, it seemed like some strange hybred between a Belgian dubble and a barleywine.  An interesting experiment, but I'm ready to move on."
"Notes: Great to have an experimental brew here and there, bring this to a dinner party to funk things up. After a couple of bottle of this they won’t know up from down or wine from beer. Other than that it is not a beer that would be considered an everyday beer nor a beer you can drink much at all. More or less a beer to share with a meal … seems to pair well with garlic studded pork loin with brown rice (that could be cooked with saffron) and a sun-dried tomato spinach and goat cheese salad."
"I must admit from what I've read and the description on the label, I really didn't know what to expect from this brew. It was really more beer like than I anticipated. Slightly hazy peach colored liquid. Nice pillowy, lasting tan head. Grapes, honey are evident in the aroma and flavor along with a touch of alcohol. Definitely sweet, but not cloying. Considering all the unique components in this brew, the flavors blend pretty well. Overall a unique, worthwhile treat."
"I would love to give King Midas some Immort Ale. just to let him witness how far beer has progressed the in past few millennia."
"The first sip that I took of this beer, I thought that it was going to be too sweet for me, despite the amazing complexity of mixing mead, wine, and beer. Not too often you get to try a beer that has been reported on by the New York Times as a matter of archeological interest. The muscat grapes do add a tartness that was not here the first time that I tried this beer. I think it detracts from the drinkability. Not as much of a fan anymore, but still a great, unique brew."
