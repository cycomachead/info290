Obviously it pairs well with Mexican food, but it's really good just on its own as well.  Seek this one out if you want a little something different.  I'll look for this one again for sure.","dcscientist","Feb 28, 2015"

4.09,3.3,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter.  Pours a very dark mahogany brown, passing light only at the edges of the glass and a thin, light brown head that dissipates to patches with slight, slippery lacing. Aroma of mild toasted malt, vanilla, Mexican chocolate and cinnamon. Flavor is milk and Mexican chocolate, toasted malt with light char, light vanilla and cinnamon, well integrated, like a milk shake. Medium bodied with light creaminess and maybe a hair less carbonation than expected. A very nice dessert porter, like drinking a chocolate shake made with Mexican chocolate for light sweetness, cinnamon and vanilla. Balanced and very tasty. I enjoyed this a great deal.","LiquidAmber","Feb 15, 2015"

3.8,-4,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Bottle #01754. Something about watching Iron Chef and drinking a horchata-inspired beer just makes sense... Anyway, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises brown sugar, light molasses, buttercream, very light cocoa, and the lightest possible kiss of roasted malts. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a vein of straight vanilla bean. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly thin feel. Overall, what is generally a tasty brew is sabotaged by its far-too-thin feel. VDubb86 and I agreed that if it had more heft, more physical substance, more chewiness, it would be an exceptional beer. We just wanted the flavors to hang around for a while, rather than book it like lubed jelly...","TMoney2591","Mar 05, 2013"

4.08,3,4,4,4.25,3.75,4,"this is everything stone's vertical epic series wished it could be, all wrapped up into a single brew. yeah, I said it! a huge porter dressed up with cinnamon and vanilla, it really is a thing of beauty. pours an intriguing dark brown with an obsidian luster and a noted density. the head is mocha in color and quite fluffy, leaving sticky rings as it drinks. the nose is big surprise, whole vanilla beans and cinnamon sticks in equal proportion take front and center with a massive roasted barley and chocolate malt body behind. the alcohol is not at all detectable in the aroma. the flavor is more balanced than the nose, but the prime position of the additives is welcomed yet again. the vanilla is sweet and earthy, almost greasy in its contribution, and the cinnamon is intensely spicy in flavor and fragrance. the bitter cocoa character of the malt calms both down and unites them exquisitely. the alcohol only comes out when the beer warms, and even then only in the very late stages of the otherwise sweet and mellow finish. wow this is lovely! full body, relaxed but noticeable carbonation, and a mouth coating thoroughness to the mouthfeel. overall maybe the best thing ive had from elevation in terms of both creativity and execution.
