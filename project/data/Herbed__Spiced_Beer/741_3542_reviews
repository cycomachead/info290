"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/29/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, plum, fig, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, spices, and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, plum, fig, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, and herbal/spice earthiness. Slight spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, plum, fig, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, spices, and dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with a small-moderate warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent winter spiced ale. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, spices, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Root beer flavor.  Excessively sweet."

"Mild flavor, smooth, subtle hints of spice.  This will be my go to this holiday season."
"A well-made, well-balanced (for the style) ""Holiday"" lager. The spices do grow as the beer warms.  Alcohol is very well-integrated, adding a bit of ""winter"" warmth rather than ""heat"".  Nicely done!"

"Worth $0.99 for sure. Not worth $9.99 for a 4 pack in-season. Maybe I'll grab another to age for a year, but... eh."

"I found myself enjoying this concoction of spices. It's easy to drink considering its' big body."

"Make sure you have something to eat before you try drinking this. It WILL knock you on your ass if you aren't careful. I love the flavors and the smell. They say holidays to me. Had I not read the label I would have thought it to be a dark, winter ale."
"Hands down, this is the most well spiced holiday beer I have had yet. Next year at Christmas time, I will be eagerly looking out for this beer. It is one thing to have nice spicing, it is another thing entirely to have that and a solid malt base to build off of, which Lakefront definitely does with this beer."
""
"O: Overall a bit unbearing sweet and over-spiced and one that didn't sit well with me. A hot mesh of spicy sweetness, unbalanced, a hard one to consume and not one that i will miss next holiday season."

"O: Definitely worth a try... smells good, tasty but I think it wuld be better balanced if the alcohol were a point or two lower"

"Holiday Spice Lager is only the second herb/spiced beer I have had. To date Holiday Spice is by far my favorite in the style. This lager goes well paired with BBQ potato chips."

"Pours a reddish brown with a nice off white head that sticks around for awhile. Smell is clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet notes, very powerful, mostly inviting. Taste starts with the clove and cinnamon and moves to the nutmeg, and stays sweet throughout. A hint of orange comes in at the aftertaste, then the cinnamon and clove linger. The high ABV comes through at the end of each sip, easy to tell that it is much higher. A medium mouthfeel, not super smooth, but nice, the noticeable ABV takes away from the beer. Overall a nice holiday beer, super spiced, tons of flavor, not for those looking for subtle. Worth a taste."
""
""
"Overall: an interesting beer, definitely one to limit to once a year. It is a lot like a pumpkin beer without the pumpkin (read: cinnamon and nutmegy), and has some flaws, but overall it is drinkable and perhaps worth a try if you're into this sort of thing."
""
"It pours a dark, clear red/brown with a tan head with poor retention. lacing is moderate while the head lasts. It reeks of clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The malt, however, shines through that dense jungle of spice brilliantly. The taste is nice and malty with all of those wonderful holiday spices. there is also a moderately bitter hop presence. The finish is very bread-like, almost to the point that you can chew on it. There is moderate carbonation with a moderately full mouthfeel. The finish is a bit on the dry side, but it's quite pleasant."
"O - I can't believe how well they hide the 11% abv, and I also can't believe I've waited till now to try this one. This beer rivals other holiday brews I've tried recently, I think I'll be picking up a 6 pack soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"A spicy robust beer with a heavy smell of nutmeg. Couldn't really get the ""orange peel"" but don't know that I cared to. Poured with a less than 1"" head, not too heavy. Definitely would recommend this for a second round. Abv was very masked behind the rich robust mouthfeel of spices."
""
""
""
"Had this at a work Christmas party, now I'm on my second six pack. I'm not usually a fan of holiday beers/ spiced beers but I tried after a recommendation from a friend. For me this spiced beer hits it right on the head. It's not over the top but is very spice forward. I feel like all of the spice have their place on stage with this one. It's a little sweet but just what I'm looking for after trying all the messes of Christmas past. And at 11% this beer is crazy drinkable. I almost think it has to be a typo, haha."
"O; LB manages to pack a lot of flavor in this holiday lager without going over the top on spicing. Should age well: I need to try to get a few more for my cellar."
""
"O - Nothing ushers in winter and the Christmas spirit better than some Kenny G holiday classics and a snifter of Lakefront's soothing Holiday Spice. The beer's spicy aroma and full, rich flavor work well with it's high alcohol and warming feel but I seem to enjoy this (especially when compared side-by-side) with a year on it. Luckily Lakefront released a plethora of Vintage 2011 where the alcohol is more subtle and the spice, believe it or not, seems to shine with a little more cheer. Whether you enjoy it fresh or aged, this beer is certainly a holiday staple, worthy of any celebratory occasion!"
"O- The best seasonal LF has to offer, I usually get a six pack of this each holiday, a nice spiced beer to mix it up once in while"
""
"Update: had no idea this beer was that strong until I looked at the above criteria! Wow, it really hides the alcohol well, would have expected an 11% beer to be much less sessionable!"
""
""
""
"Overall: nice surprise. Big beer, nice and balanced. Great holiday treat."
""
"Overall I tried their other beers and it seems this has the most balance and taste I ever tried from them. Worth picking up a single which was hella cheap at around 2 bucks."
"Overall- Being really close I tend to want Lakefront to be more than they are but this is another in a lineup full of decent beers. Not sure I'd seek this one out again but I definitely would try to talk someone out of getting it."
"I did just have an ohmygosh moment when I looked up here and see the ABV at 11. I was thinking it was a 6. 11 is hard to believe - that is completely hidden. So there is the redeeming qualtiy of this beer! It is an extremely drinkable beer of this strength and a complete fooler."
"O - A brown-sugary sweet, fruity and mildly spicy strong lager. Clean yet complex, this would be an excellent choice for the Christmas season."
""
""
"Overall- A beautifully spiced lager that smells out of this world and tastes very nice. The very well hidden abv doesn't hurt either."
""
""
""
""

"O- Good winter warmer, but even better considering the abv. Will have to look for this next winter."
""
""
""
"Most Winter Wamers that I've had went down slowly since they felt so strong and spicy. This was not easy to quaff since this had a heavy feel to it. Still, it was a good beer and fans of the style won't be disappointed here. I could see myself having this again next year, with a nice plate of oatmeal cookies. This isn't a must-try but I don't think anyone would be let down by this either."
""
"Very drinkable for 11%... I enjoyed the spicing on this one; it didn't overpower the base beer but was prominent enough to be easily noticed."
""

""
"4.5 D: I'm going to have to look for this next year. I only wish I drank this a few weeks ago when I first bought it so I could buy some more. Very good example of the style."
"O - a good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There's some good stuff in there, but something that really shines on the nose. Perhaps it's a lot harder to make a winter warmer out of lager. Nevertheless, this is a solid effort and worth a single pickup."
"Wow, this one turned out to be a good pick. The brownish red color suggests a heavier brew, and the aroma of sweet malt, cinnamon, and plumb encourage it even more. When I took my first sip my tongue was bombarded with flavor of plumb, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of wine barrel aging. This made for a great combination that I found most appealing. It's tasty and thick and smooth, perfect for a night by the fireplace."
"Pours a murky brown with a 1/2 inch beige head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random streaks of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and lots of spice aromas. Taste is of malt, caramel, honey, and a spice overload. There is no real bitterness per se but the spices do linger on the palate with each sip. This beer has a crisp mouthfeel which feels weird with the spices in the beer. Overall, this is a pretty good Winter warmer but nothing I would buy again. None of the spice smells and flavors really stand out which creates a muddled spice quality."
""
"This is my favorite winter warmer. I like most of the ones I've tried, but this one I keep on coming back to. I do have to second that note on the side of the page that says it isn't recommended for cellaring. I attempted to cellar a 6 from last years batch, and it just ended up tasting like bad bananas with some spice. So don't ruin the beer, drink it while it's fresh."
"O: One of the better winter beers I've had this year."
""
"O- This beer bring much merriment. Probably my favorite holiday beer (which i tend not to like). I would say its a doppelbock lager thats got the perfect amount of spices; not too much but you can notice them. Maybe not the best beer for the new craft drinker due to the heavier body and powerful flavor, but aficionados will appreciate it. Get a six pack for a loved one, or a case for yourself. Either way, this lager is a holiday must."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's my favorite winter warmer so far. This is closer to what I was expecting from the others. The lager part of it comes through as it's very like a dopplebock that's been dressed up for the holidays. I think I need a 6 pack of this around."
"Really, one of the more enjoyable winter beers out there that is easy to get a hold of."
"The flavor profile is big, with fruits and spices figuring prominently. The finish is dry and boozy. One to sip, but quite enjoyable."
"Overall, a very good beer."
"Pours as a deep amber color with a nice white head on top that doesn't leave much in way of lacing. The aroma is heavily spiced to the point where it almost doesn't really have aberration aroma. The taste was pretty strong, found that this beer goes well with food because the spices are really powerful in this brew. The mouthfeel was a little thick and very warming. Not a terrible brew, I'd drink it again."
"Pours a dark cloudy brown, with a minimal tan head. Aroma of orange peel some cinnamon and sweet spices, some fruitiness, caramel malt. Taste is bitter orange peel, some sweet spices, dark toasted malts. Moderate carbonation and full body. Finish is sweet dark malt with bitter orange peel and sweet spices. The alcohol esters really come thru in the end. Overall an interesting and complex brew."
"The 11% ABV is completely masked and is nearly undetectable. The thick mouthfeel makes this a definite sipper but the excellent flavors and smells keep me wanting more. This will definitely be in my glass next Christmas morning."
"My aggro pour revealed a VERY active beer that was capable of creating an abundance of deep-tan head with great retention. In fact, there was initially so much head that the beer seemed to be cascading as it settled. A good whiff of the nose led me to believe that (at least) clove, cinnamon and allspice went into its production. There was an orange-citrus scent also, but the honey was lost in the mix. Color was a deep dark-brown with cola highlights. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a lot of spice evident in the mouth. I stand by my claim of cinnamon and clove, since they were the most powerful flavors on the tongue. Finish was dry, spicy and pleasant. My headache began to subside and I was ready for another beer, not necessarily another of this one, but another beer all the same."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very spicy, nutmeg and ginger standing out. Taste is also full of spice, some oranges, lots of flavors blending well together here. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a very good beer."
"Great beer for the holidays."
"Poured into imperial pint glass. Color was a dark caramel brown that was very slightly opaque. Thin caramel white head that clung nicely. Aroma was banana bread with some cloves with some nice spiciness. Taste was very nuanced. Tastes started as a milky lactose, then shifted to a banana bread, and then finished up with a peppery spice. Outstanding mouth feel. Coated very well, but wasn't too thick. Slightly bubbly in the mouth. Great for a winter warmer. Very drinkable. A solid sipper that kept me wanting more."
"DB- One of the better Winter beers I have come across. The alcohol builds with warmth and makes this a one bottle experience."
"This was a gift form upper Midwest relatives, when here at Christmastime, oh my Gawd, didn't know this was 11% until I opened this review page, might be a record for me (on second check it's #2 on my personal ABV). Well then, let's give it a whirl! Serving slightly chilled, not cold as this should bring out what this selection has to offer. Popping the top I get a big waft of cloves, allspice and cinnamon, not unlike a pumpkin pie. Pours into a tulip glass a deep root beer color with a medium bubble head that wisps away. On the taste, this brew start with a big syrup-thick mouthfeel, very high viscosity. The taste has an upfront spicyness just like the smell. The middle taste has some roasted malts, then the finish has a dry chocolate slight bitterness. All this while maintaining spice flavors through the whole taste. This is one holiday brew.To sit next to the fireplace or as a desert beer, I don't know how this brew could be beat. Outstanding."
"This beer is pretty good. I couldn't drink too many as the high alcohol is getting to me already. I compare this to Anchor's Christmas ale which in my opinion has a better appearance, a richer, more unique aroma and taste as well as a silkier mouthfeel, but that's it. I like this one better than all the rest of the winter warmers I have had this year next to Anchor's."
"D: This is a nice brew to try in the winter months, one that I would get a six pack of and save some for years to come. A nice warmer for sure."
"This is definitely a unique one. A nice beer to look forward to come winter. If you're into holiday beers w/ cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, honey, etc.. definitely check this one out. You can definitely age this one."
"The beer pours a caramel brown color with a cap of foam that dwindles to a wisp. The aroma is bursting with nutmeg and clove and orange. This a very flavorful brew. Malty, but mostly fruity and sweet, perhaps a bit too much. The fruity sweetness plows through the center and finishes with sweetness and a dash of spice. The chest fills with warmness after a few sips. A big beer for the holiday season. The large ABV makes me wish I would have saved it for when the in-laws come over."
"Overall- a lot going on here! Big and bold and a pleasant experience, though probably not in my top 3 holiday brews."
"Mouthfeel is medium, with a light moderate carbonation. Slightly above in all aspects but should be expected because of the ABV. Regardless there is a lot of spicing, but as a fan of a well done holiday ale I enjoy adequate spicing and flavor so I still enjoyed this. No way you can tell it is 11% ABV. I sure didn't, time to go to bed."
"This is the quintessential holiday lager, no doubt about it, I thought it would be overpowering but it was smooth and delightful"
"Lakefront Brewery makes consistently good seasonal brews. The holiday spice lager is no exception. Pours a hazy amber color. Nice aroma and taste of oranges, honey, vanilla, nutmeg, spices, and yeast. This beer taste like Christmas and will certainly get better with age."
"No way I would drink another one of these, I can barely finish one. The sweetness is overwhelming. I could never drink this to complement any food. It reminds me of overly sweet, cheap whiskey. It's not enjoyable to drink; I found it hard to get down. I don't often give bad reviews but this beer is nearly undrinkable."
"Seems a bit early for something like this, but I don't care enough to argue. It pours a murky burnt auburn topped by a mere few layers of small glowing off-white bubbles. The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, mandarin oranges, some pinches of brown sugar, and an underlying aquifer of bland liquid pumpernickel. Honestly, I think I was expecting a bit more in my 'strils. The taste reminds me of gingerbread drizzled with a tropical fruit cocktail, the kind Dole likes to overcharge for. You know what I'm talkin' about. A hint of what seems like spearmint comes forth in the finish, but luckily this is a minor occurrence. Unfortunately, following this is a blast of sickly sweet nothingness. Those were the words my brain formulated on the spot, and those are the words I'm gonna stick with. Suffice it to say that the back end of the finish is rather cloying. The body is a lumbering medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly wet feel. Overall, what was probably a delicious-sounding recipe comes out a bit below par. I hope this is just last year's vintage; if it is, I'll make a second visit and see if things are any better fresh."
"D - Drinkability is fairly high considering the ABV, but the tasted kind of knocks it down for me, personally."
"Like I said before, not for the faint of heart. After buying cases for cheap, they were passed around to friends, while a couple loved it, including myself, the others dispised it after a couple of sips. For beer lovers, especially winters and other darks, definitely an interesting brew to try."
"(D)- A good beer that I enjoyed, but much more fitting for the holiday season for sure. Good stuff."
"D - This is a great desert brew or nightcap for a cold winter evening spent in pajamas. I wouldn't want more than one, but that's okay. This one will last me a while as I swirl sniff, and slowly sip. I've been less than impressed with Lakefront in the past, but this is a really well built brew."
"D: Rough on the after taste with the ginger and higher than average alcohol content. Not really light on the stomach."
"The website states that this beer weighs in at 11% abv it's hard to believe that one. All I get fron the nose is holiday spices with a bit of honey sweetness, dark fruits. Mind numbing spices including cinnamon, ginger, allspice etc. Hints of vanilla and clove dance around as well there was a thread about some guy talking about how he was able to finish a whole six pack of this beer and he called it the Holiday Spice six pack challenge now that's what I call the Biggest Loser. Cloyingly sweet honey tones coats the palate with this shite, what a mess of a beer. Dark syrup with spice infused layers some orange peeel and honey with holiday spices. I can't finish this is pure shit. Mouthfeel is like lighter fluid with spice and booze burn as it warms. Drinkability sucks and I can't make it any more intricate than that."
"D - A solid straight forward spice beer. 9.5abv not noticeable at all."
"I am really not sure where the Lager comes into play. I really don't detect anything like any style I ever had. For good reason. My first winter warmer. It is like Pumpkin Ale (most notably DFH Pumkin Ale) with a twist of Christmas. Be a great one to show to macro drinkers just for them to see how complex and different a beer can be."
"D: this is a nice winter warmer but the alcohol will sneak up rather quickly and the spices get to be a tad overwhelming"
"It was unique for"
"Drinkabiliy: nice beer for a cold winter day. Slow sipping but more than one could be enjoyed in a session."
"This is a full flavored beer that packs quite a wallop. However, it's quite drinkable for a nearly 10% abv beer."
"Drinkability: Why, bless my soul, that was all kinds of alright and one I'd recommend, provided you're in the mood for something sweet, spicy, and warming. Generally, Lakefront's brews neither please nor displease, being very middle-of-the-road for me, but this, this Spiced Lager, much to my surprise,"
"Drinkability: An average winter warmer that is at minimum slightly overspiced. I have had way better this holiday season. Not a bad beer, but nothing I would search for again."
"It is a fine Holiday brew!"
"This is a big time, full strength holiday beer with plenty of everything. Although it does not have the urbane subtlety of Anchor's ""Our Special Ale", it nevertheless is one of my favorite holiday/wassail beers brewed in the United States. Whatever it lacks in nuance is compensated by the bold festive nature of this recipe. This is quite good."
"This beer pours a dark red/brown color. The head is at least two inches. It leaves a spot of lace around the glass after settling. The aroma is quite spicy. I also smell fruity hints. A kiss of hops is present as well. The flavor is cinnamon all the way. A bit of clove and a definite alcohol flavor bites on the backend. This beer feels substantial. Which it should since it's a winter warmer. I've spent a few christmas get togethers sippin on this beer. I will most likely be pickin it up again this year."
"This beer pours a cloudy brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of vibrant cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, with a firm malt backbone. The taste is even more spicy than the aroma, and I'm not sure that is a good thing. I really like the aroma, but the taste is just too much. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this would be a really good beer if it were a bit mellower. As is I don't think I'll be drinking this again."
"I wonder if they make this beer without the spices, as that might be a hell of a beer."
"M/D - A little bit too fake spice for me. I like winter beers, but this one just seems a little bit over the top and reduces its drinkability to just one and probably not again."
"Drinkability: Not good. Too spicy for me. All these winter type beers are very spicy. Not for me."
"Overall- Too tart and fruity sour."
"D - Now this is a holiday / winter seasonal... A sipper to sit and relax with while thinking of all the holidays bring... Bold and exciting... Not something I could drink a lot of annually, but something worth seeking out year after year..."
"D - As I mentioned, this one is sneaky. It goes down super easy. Definitely the type of beer I'd like to have while I sit around the fire at the theoretical family lodge."
"D-One of the better selections from LB. This one is aged 13 months (brewed Nov 2007, week 3). It is interesting and rather tasty, but it gets a little cloying partway through, and it is slow to finish."
"I also wanna say that on occasional burps and even sips, there is quite an alcohol burn trying to come out from behind the flavor. But given the potent ABV this stuff has, I'd say they actually mask it quite well."
"It's not called Holiday Spice for nothing. True, it's a bit too much but definitely something different to try."
"The spice joined with the cloying sweetness dominates the palate. If the unfermentable sugars and spice additions were cut back, this could be a nice beer in my opinion. I have a hard time believing the ABV, but if it is true, it is VERY well hidden...maybe behind that extra ginger they threw in."
" ~ Minus the taste this beer is pretty good. Unfortunately, because of the flavor I'm not to excited about finishing off the sixer I have in the basement fridge."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep orange, red tint color, with a off white head that leaves minimal lacing and doesn't last long. The aroma is extremely strong with orange, spice, honey, and clove very present. The taste is very over powering with spice notes. This is just not my style. It is hard to say if this represents the style b/c it is not a usual brew for my taste. It seems to stand for what it is and I respect that."
"Drinkability... NOT"
"Conditioning in the bottle since last winter has turned this into a real winner in my opinion."
"This beer had barely a head at pour - only a small froth in the center of the glass and a ring of tiny bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. The color was orangy-red. I was hit with the smell of oranges, cloves and cinnamon with the same taste that followed. Clean finish, must be the honey - just a hint of tingling on the front portion (not tip) of my tongue. Very refreshing in the evening after 100 degree F weather - Christmas in July! Did attract a few gnats - one took a bath...I hope the beer was safe to drink due to alcohol content (9.5%) after the tiny carcass was removed! I personally prefer Brown Ales, Porters and Stouts without too much coffee and I found this beer very nice considering it was a lager. Not a beer I want to drink frequently or several at one time."
"Holiday Spice Lager is Lakefront Brewery's best offering by a country mile. I'm amazed at how seamlessly integrated and how delicious it is after a mere six months in the bottle. It probably ages exceptionally well, but I can't imagine that it'll be any better in the future than it is right now. This is a 'case' beer for sure."
"Lagerish mouthfeel and above average with surprisngly sourness within a lager. It works, with orange and spices following. Imagine a toned down honeyed up cantillon.Some beige transparency and quality aromas. Yeah cloves, honeyed over, and worth trying this beverage."
"Eric"
"drinkability is decent. this is a big brew, with a notable amount of alcohol. though the alcohol is fairly well covered, the presence is still there. a decent brew, but one should usually be enough."
"D - This is a really good winter brew. One of the better ones that I've had this season."
"D - Not great. This beer smells great and looks good but the flavor is so confusing for you tastebuds. One or two strong flavors with a bunch of supporting spices is ok but this has a ton of all of the spices. It's too much."
"I think this beer would be much better if the spices were toned down to work with the malt and hops, rather than trying to bully them out."
"I purchased mine at The Anderson's General Store in Lima, OH"
"The beer is not a sipping beer. Many spiced beer are too over powering and this is not one of those beers."
"Deep amber/brown smells of cider/cloves spice. Tastes pretty much as it smells - a little stong on the back of the pallet finishes dry and spicey. Well carbed not great mouthfeel. Drinkability okay, I guess would tire on you after more than one or two."
"Wow I had no idea this was 9.5 abv. Poured a very nice firm head that quickly disappeared and left no lace. Orange/tangerine and Honey come straight off the nose with cinnamon and nutmeg along side them tasting a little flat. Maybe because it is a 2006 but I figure this should cellar well. Almost have some egg nog flavor with orange and honey. Not my favorite winter release but Very drinkable beer for 9.5abv I may go back to the store and gobble up all holiday spice from the breakage bin or maybe just maybe I will grab a 6 pack when lakefront releases it. Cheers to good beers"
"I would recommend you it, based purely on its polarizing nature."
"Pours a very dark brown, with reddish edges and a black center. Very little head. Big spice aromas first off -- nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice -- and something that reminds me of diacetyl that I can't put my finger on. The spice smells get in the way of the malt smells, which show through with only the faintest glimmer. On the palate, huge, bludgeoning sweetness hits at first... though you become habituated to it with time. Cloying spicyness melds with the sweetness, yielding something like spiced eggnog mixed with a can of One Pie. Not too appetizing. Thick mouthfeel, relatively mild carbonation. With this and many other winter warmers, I keep thinking of the word ""restraint!"". As in, the brewers should use some. Too much spice, too much sweetness, nothing subtle or balanced here."
"thanks goes to a person in Wi. for this beer. poured a brown copper with a small off white head that left no lacing. aroma sweet cinnamon, honey, ginger, alcohol got most of that before it got close to my nose, than got raisins, caramel. flavor honey just jumps out there in 1st place than all those spices the alcohol is well hidden, nice dryness good beer, wish I had this at the holidays"
"This is a really weird brew, but I highly recommend the adventurous beer tryers out there seek this one out!"
"dirtylou saved a bottle of this for me to bring back from my trip to Madison"
"Drinkabilty: Not my kind of session beer, but appropriate for the holidays, would work well with ginegrbread or a nice pork roast!"
"drinkability: pretty darn drinkable"
"Fantome...Happy Holidays (in August) to you my friend. Thanks for the bottle."
"A fantastic holiday beer."
"Another Spicy-Cinnamon-Honey-Roll-Hesperidium BigCheers to Sir BigHuge for this one."
"788"
"Clear maroon color, small off-white, slightly red head. A very well spiced beer, lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in the nose. Really doesn't smell or taste anything like your average beer of any style, that's what's great about the winter warmer, it's a style based on a goal, rather than ingredients or brewing style. Taste is dominated by mulling style spice flavors combined with alcohol to do exactly what the style suggests. Medium mouthfeel, with some alcohol burn. Good drinkability. A perfect beer for a cold winter's night."
"Surprisignly delicious. Follows a path similar to that of their Pumpkin Ale, but goes far beyond anything that beer will achieve. Not only is the flavor a welcomed surprise, its body is also quite memorable. Rethinking my holiday strategy once again...."
"Mouthfeel is good...it has a nice creamy quality to it, body is a little bit thin though. I probably couldn't drink more than one or two of these due to the powerful spiciness. However, it does make for a nice treat on a cold December evening."
"Dark copper appearance, clear. Head builds to just under 1/2 an inch, lasts a good amount of time. Punctuation mark laces on the glass. The aroma is largely from spices, seems typical in the pie spice realm, nutmeg, cinnamon, some mace. Body is lightish but the carbonation is lower, giving the impression of a coating texture. Starts out with flavors that mirror the smells, a bit of orange adds brightness, but nutmeg and spice dominate the beer. Surprising for a brew with honey, the sweetness is low and the overall profile ends with a bitter and almost tobacco-like aftertaste. Hard to tell where a hop contribution begins. Not cloying or overly sweet, this is a nicer beer in the holiday mix."
"I got the first batch off the line and this year's may blow other years out of the water. Last year's weaker ABV is no longer present. This baby packs old school Holiday Spice punch. The Spices are blended masterfully and the aroma screams Winter! I have been waiting and it paid off! On Thanksgiving, sip this with a nice turkey dinner and give thanks that you are in Lakefront's distribution radius."
"notes: sorry for saying such things about a beer respected by others.. maybe I got a bad pack but I struggled through these beers honestly, I just couldn't handle the smell, if others can I could see them really enjoying this around chrsitmas.. maybe mix it with egg nog or something .. but I cant' handle it"
"The taste is not unlike the aroma, very heavily spiced with, well, Christmas spices, and a hint of pine. There is also a very significant blast of orange flavor as well, interesting taste, but if it were not for the carbonation you'd almost think this was a spiced wine. In addition, I wonder how this would taste if I were to warm it up. Point being it is that spiced of a Holiday/Christmas beer. Great between Thanksgiving and St. Swivens day, not as appropriate on Good Saint Patricks Eve, but still tasty. Its rather high in alcohol, and a pint goes a long way, but I'll look for this next Christmas."
"Stumbled across this one in a health store of all places. Pours a dark amber with a small head. Aroma is full of holiday spices as promised. Ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg you name it, it's all there except for the 9.5 Abv. Body is medium to light and smooth finishing with a crispness. Flavor is on the sweet side with most of the spice coming on top of a light hop flavor. Warming alcohol in the finish. Overall a fairly decent winter warmer."
"Pours a reddish brown sort of hue with a very long lasting white head which leaves nice lacing down the sides of my glass. A strong but not overpowering cinnamon/nutmeg aroma. A very smooth spicy malty flavor, ABV is very undetectable. An outstanding winter warmer."
"This beer is very drinkable, and unlike most holiday beers (mainly ales), this one doesn't appear to be too high in alcohol and makes for a wonderfully refreshing brew. The perfect beer to accompany a dinner of spicy chicken curry!"
"Medium amber colored, lightly hazy, tight head of small bubbles. Mega spicy aroma. Honey, all spice, coves & ginger bread all come & go. Taste is apples & crisp at first, & becomes warming smooth creamy malt in the middle. Stays a bit too thin in the mouth feel. Never sits down on the pallet. Could probably stand a year laying down. Seems like its maybe 6+%."
"Taste was very nice and full of malts and spices,that carry through and well into the slightly hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light, but this IS a lager and stays within character. A wonderful offering from this brewery and I can see it gaining a lot of popularity among the masses."
"Mmmm, this was a bottle whose contents did not falter at all throughout it's stay on my palate and I hoist my glass to Mr. Jeffboo for providing this sumptuous repast!"
"Light brownish, burnt orangy yellow color thats quite clouded and has a strange glow from the bottom up with a medium ivory colored head from a vigorous pour, sits soft and thick but dwindles down somewhat fast; minimal stringed lace. Aroma is a whole lotta spice! Allspice, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, fly across the air and is very fresh and lovely into the nose, a light touch of dulled plum and sweet potato and toasty malts are in the back but are hard reaching due to the very spicy array this holiday keeper has. Taste is much more subdued then the smell gives way too, which is a good thing, I don't think I would like a glass of allspice, would you? But the spices are there but favorably mixed with a soft toasted Vienna-like maltyness with a slight sweetness underneath some of the allspice and ginger. Quite a nice semi-milding taste thats very pleasant and subtle. Good medium body feel and has a lingering spiced dryness for the finish. The 9.5% ABV surprised me, its no where to found if that is truely the ABV, no where. This was gone in no time and goes down super easy with a good little zip of spice. More please. Thanks jeffboo!!"
"I'd pay up to $20 for a sixer of this I love it so much...What I wouldn't do for a kegger of this on tap in my basement....2-or 3 a night would help me fight through these -25 below Northern Minnesota Winter nights...If you see this buy it and drink it...and hord it for the future..."
"Thanks Ryan!"
"Thank you Pieman for the sixer."
"As a warning: Do not come near this beer if it is any cooler than 55 degrees. It is almost undrinkable until it reaches cellar temp."
"I had to drink this one out of the bottle, but it still was one of my favorites of the night. Aroma was mostly of spices with cinnamon dominating. Flavor was of cinnamon, orange, hops, and some alcohol. A good holiday beer to make the conversations with relatives a bit more lively."
"I first sampled Lakefront's Holiday Spice back in 1993 or 1994 in a special tasting held in the old Riverwest brewery...since I moved, I have missed its yuletide presence every year...it is a great beer to go out of the way to purchase if you are ever in Milwaukee when the mercury drops below zero."
"This beer poured a murky amber color and formed an off white head that formed a nice circular lace as it subsided. An aroma of cinnamon(?sp) and nutmeg that kind of sneaks up on you. The flavor is of cinnamon, nutmeg and some citrus. An interesting finish to the beer that features element of the nutmeg and is a touch astrigent."
"I have really enjoyed trying all of the deifferent holiday beers I have been finding lately. This beer pours a dark amber color with a thin light beige head. Aroma immeditattely reminded me of cinnamon-flavored dental floss. Orange smell was also present. The flavor consisted of spices, hops and honey and while slightly unbalanced it was still enjoyable with a rather dry finish."
"Uncapped one of these while putting up the Christmas tree the other night. Bottled the first week of November, 2002. Poured a hazy dark ruby brown with a large rising light tan head. Festive aroma consisted of nutmeg, cinnamon, plum, ginger and malt. Medium bodied and smooth with a slight tingle upfront. Hint of orange zest. Intringuing gingerbread-like malt finish. The heavy alcohol is transformed into an almost brandy-like flavor in conjunction with all the spices. A very delicious and potent winter beer."
