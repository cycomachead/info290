"O: I am amazed at the marvel that is Small Town brewing, that they can put out this root beer in different ABV level, and it all taste the same, except the higher you go the faster you crash... believe me, I found this out personally"

"Well, it tastes like my dad's root beer.  And every other root beer.  Which is to say that it's delicious, assuming you enjoy root beer."
"Wonder what ice cream would taste like with it?"
"I'm not opposed to brewing with adjuncts, but this might as well just be a can of soda with a shot of vodka added.  And, yes, I'm dinging it on appearance for using artificial coloring."

"Growing up I remeber drinking Dads rootbeer with my dad. It was our root beer of choice at home. So naturally even the name not your fathers root beer had me. Then the taste. Incredible. Taste just like the best root beer you've ever had (similar to the tastes of dads) lots of spices and bite and has a great ale after taste that is incredibly smooth on the palate! If you like root beer you will love this beer!"

"Tastes just like rootbeer. Have an open mind that it isn't your traditional beer and you have it made"
"Tastes and smells so much like root beer and cannot even taste the alcohol. It's great in small portions but it is cloying. I couldn't finish my 10oz pour because it started to get too sweet. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall - shitty."

"Smells like root beer, a touch of vanilla. Tastes straight up like root beer. No alcohol taste.  A bit sweet. Wow."

"An alcoholic root beer-beer at 10% ABV you say? I had heard about this from a colleague at work who raved about it to me. Saw it on tap and had to try for myself. Draft pour into snifter. Pours dark brown/black, with a cola hue and very light carbonation present. Great presence of vanilla and toasted oak. The booziness only becomes more apparent when this one warms up, otherwise it is soda pop all the way. A unique tasting experience and one to definitely snap up if you see it in your area."
"i like root beer.. i love beer.. this is the most overrated beer IMO EVER... and people trade for it!"

"It tastes good but there's absolutely nothing remarkable about it.    Yeah, its10% ABV...so in high school, this would have been ""deadly"". ;)"

"People either love or hate this. Small town accomplished exactly what they set out to do, brew the very best root beer flavored strong ale. It is easily the best root beer brew I've ever had.  It is very very sweet, but packed with real root beer flavor, very easy to forget what you're drinking.  I prefer the 10% abv(tap only) version over the 5.9% version."

"I tried this beer at a festival in Wauconda, Illinois .  This taste was unexpected, for sure.  A very rich and flavorful root beer with only a minor hint I was drinking an alcoholic drink.  I enjoyed several glasses and the taste never dulled.  I would recommend this beer to anyone that enjoys a home made style root beer."

"This is a short review because there's not really much you can say! This beer tastes incredibly close to root beer. It's sweet and syrupy and spicy and filled with herbs. I have no idea how they made it - did they mix grain alcohol into a keg of Barq's? Maybe! I don't care. It's great. Do you like root beer? You will like this beverage. If you think that regular (non-diet, that is) root beer is too sweet, then you should not even bother trying this."

"This is not beer"
""
""

"What an absolute joke, lets face it, this 'beer' is just a way for people to get loaded and pretend that they are experienced beer drinkers."

"Overall: I honestly can't think of a better way to explain this beer. It's root beer with alcohol, though you can't even taste the alcohol, or at least I couldn't. If you like root beer, you will love this beer. If not, then you probably won't like it. That's all there is to it. Since I love root beer, this is easily one of the best beers I've ever had."

"I was in Chicago last week for some training for work.  Me and my co-workers stopped by Harry Caray's 7th Inning Stretch restaurant and I saw, ""Not Your Father's Root Beer"" on the menu and decided to give it a try.  I was glad I ordered a glass of it!  This brew is incredibly tasty.  The version I was served was the 10% ABV.  Like several of the other reviews have stated, you do not taste the alcohol at all.  The flavor is a delicious creamy/sweet root beer flavor.  The root beer flavor reminded me of a freshly poured A&W root beer  served at the root beer stand.  This is in contrast to say a flavor like a Barq's or MUG root beer.  The creaminess and hints of vanilla come through slightly at the finish.  I highly recommend trying this excellent beer if you get the chance.  Looking at the Small Town Brewery's website, it appears that it is only available in Illinois.  With me being in Ohio, I am hoping to find a local place that can order some for me.  Small Town Brewery really should consider a wider distribution than just within Illinois.  I am sure it would be a big success wherever it is sold."

"Can not give anything a perfect score because there is always room for improvement but this beer is exactly what u think it is 10% abv and tastes just like  Root Beer! It is really sweet with strong sarsaparilla and vanilla. you have to remind people that there is alcohol in it."
""
"Had this on tap in Chicago last spring. Incredible root beer flavor-couldn't tell it was anything other than root beer. Very sweet, and a heavy hitter if you're not careful."

"Going to echo Trifecta1 here, except to add that this looks, smells, and tastes like a VERY GOOD root beer, i.e., without the cloying sweetness of HFCS. Inviting spicy aromas of vanilla, sarsparilla. Taste follows. I took my time to finish my $3 PINT, but this is easily crushable. May look thin, but very creamy."
"Overall - It's loaded with vanilla. It's just root beer with alcohol. Way too sweet for me."

"It's premium root beer. Looks like root beer, smells like root beer, feels like root beer, tastes like root beer. Alcohol is well hidden. Any qualities that resemble beer are hidden. How they brewed this beast is a mystery, but it is tasty, and no one can deny that."

"O- This beer is definitely one of my favorites. Now that I have seen a picture of a bottle of it on BA, I am determined to find it and stock my fridge with it! If you can find this beer in bottles or (if you can purchase) a keg, buy it, you won't be disappointed (that is if you like root beer)."

"I could see this one as great dessert beer. In talking to the manager, he said this is one of their top five sellers which surprised me given their great tap choices but upon drinking it, I can now see why. Well Done!"
"Lucky to try this at a tasting event in Memphis. I will simply echo what reviewers have said...this is ridiculous. I cannot believe this is 10% abv, I can't even believe its alcoholic. It tastes like really good craft root beer. Really sweet, not heavily carbonated. Wish I could buy this all the time, it's one of the most surprising beers I've ever tasted. Bravo."

"Aside from my tasting glass, I made myself a root beer float with some vanilla ice cream and it is a real throwback. It works perfectly. I highly recommend it."
""
""
"22oz bomber, love love it.  Think barrel aged hint of bourbon sassafras root beer with teeth.  Must go back to Kroger to get Jeni's vanilla ice cream for a 5-star float NOW.  Starting to feel the coolness through my vertebrae now.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

"O: This is the best craft root beer I've had, alcoholic or not. So ridiculously creamy, which makes it stand above the rest. I'm not a huge soda drinker, but honestly, if this were available to me locally, I would go out of my way to have a few bottles on hand at all times."

"Best beer I've ever had."
"Pours brown with minimal head... Looks just like root beer. The nose is ridiculous... Is this really beer?? Smells like a nice creamy root beer. Heavy notes of vanilla, saspirilla, and birch come through. Literally nothing in here smells like there is a beer in there. No hop bitterness, no yeasty notes, nothing, and I'm totally okay with that! Taste is... Surprise surprise, root beer! A pretty heavy sweetness in the middle along with all the notes that a good root beer delivers. Mouthfeel is fizzy and somewhat viscous. Aside from a little hint of booziness at the end, this beer tastes identical to root beer. I can't believe that 10% of alcohol is hidden within this beverage. This could be dangerous!"

"I acquired this via trade from blue-dream. Thank you, sir. It was shipped to me in swing top bottles, securely fastened and taped. So, I will call it a growler for reviewing purposes. I poured it into a mug, as I thought a root beer should be served. It looks a lot like root beer. The head isn't quite as frothy as a root beer, but that is probably due to being pours into a bottle and shipped two states away. Basically, this looks and smells like a root beer. It smells exactly like it. As far as I can tell it tastes exactly like root beer. I am not a big root beer drinker, but the thought of a 10% abv root beer is appealing. The only thing that detracts, is that when it warms I get a little alcohol taste. As long as it is ice cold it is root beer all the way. It is not overly carbonated, but once again, that goes back to the pouring and shipping. Overall, it is fantastic. I wish I had some ice cream to make a float with it. Can you imagine a 10% ice cream float? I am definitely glad I got to try this. This stuff is scary as the drinkability and high abv make a highly potent combination."

"I tell you what...put this against any of the root beer brands in a blind taste taste...and watch out...you'll have a bunch of drunk adolescents!!! The beer was root beer in appearance....no head and no lace. The scent was root beer. The taste was...root beer. The mouthfeel felt like a slightly more body than a...root beer. Overall I thought I was drinking root beer...wait....maybe I was...who knows...I would hate to think the establishment was selling a glass of root beer for $8!"
"It mimics a good craft root beer in look, taste, smell, and mouth feel. The carbonation is refreshingly low. I recommend it."

"D - As far as hard root beer goes, this is a pretty good one. Curious what the base beer is, as I'm not sure I'd even guess there was 'beer' in here at all. In any case, enjoyed my mug and would order again; seems to be on-tap a lot in Boystown for some reason."
""
"Overall - if I knew about this when I was younger I would be an alcoholic"
""
""
"Overall, hands down the best hard root beer I've had to date, aside from their heftier Not Your Grandfather's variant ;)"

"If you're ever in the Illinois area, seek out a place that has this beer. Search far and wide for you while you're there and try it. You may find yourself as happy (then sad) as I did."

"The only real critique I could offer is that it's perhaps too sweet/syrupy, but this is an insane beer. If you get the chance to try it, do not pass it up."
""
"Man its taste just like rootbeer. I couldn't between the taste of this. Very smooth with no after taste. Its even smells like rootbeer. Can't wait to taste the stronger one. If you have the change to try it and you like rootbeer you won't be disapponited at all."
"Be careful with it, it would be very easy to over indulge. I am thinking that it would be interesting to try as a float. You could call it a Drunken Cow."
""
"O- This is a great beer that I look forward to having again. Very unique style that hardly tastes like a beer at all. I have found myself craving it since I tried it. This is a must try if you find it on tap."
"A friend had a keg of this at his place so I tried a glass. Only had one because of how dangerously drinkable this stuff is. Wow! Smells like a root beer, but better, somehow. Taste is fresh root beer, maybe a little creamier, with some vanilla hints in there. No detectable alcohol whatsoever, which is what makes it so dangerous. This was definitely a hit at the party. Seek this out if you can. I will be looking to buy a 5 gal keg ASAP."
""
"Finally putting down my thoughts on the 10% version of this ridiculousness. It pours a nearly opaque black-brown topped by a finger of light sandy tan foam. The nose comprises light molasses, mild wintergreen, cola, and even a bit of cocoa and maple syrup. Frankly, it smells like root beer. Yup. The taste brings in more of the same, a traditional-tasting root beer with a slight intimation that there might be some alcohol back there somewhere. Imagine your uncle (not the creepy one, though) surreptitiously spiking his own soda during an otherwise boring family party, then possibly (you're not entirely sure, though) doing the same for you, despite your youth. Yup. The body is a fluffy medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a damn tasty beverage, one that combines my love for a well-made root beer with my love for a good-tasting beer. I can't say this vehemently enough: GET SOME!"
""

"Alcoholic root beer. Tastes like a really well made root beer. No real sense of any booze. Root beer color (dark). Smells like a great root beer- herbal. Fuller bodied than a non-alcoholic root beer. How they do this is a mystery to me. I love root beer, and of course I love this stuff."
