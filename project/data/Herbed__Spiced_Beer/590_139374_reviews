"Nice pumpkin, good bit of cinnamon and spice.  But it ends of being a tad watery in the end."

"Disappointing - for a NG fruit/ vegetable beer"

"Decent but not my normal style"

"Pours a nice creamy head with a hazy brown golden brown.  Leaves yeast on bottom of bottle.  Smells cinnamon, pumpkin.dark fruit tones with pumpkin coming through.  I do catch a slight banana that I like in a Weiss.  Actually finishes quite nicely.  I had this earlier in the week and I like it better now.  I couldn't drink a bunch of these, but isn't bad."

"O:  I'm normally not a big pumpkin beer fan, but this one was enjoyable, and very easy drinking."

"11/26..pours reddish brown amber with 1/4 inch thick white foam. Snow like. Pumpkin pie nose, sweet, nutmeg spiced. Taste is a chewy sweet pumpkin filling malt, cookie taste. Very little hop or bite to balance out. Straight and simple."

"Overall a decent pumpkin beer. Background notes of pumpkin in the smell and taste.  Not overpowering.  Clean finish."
"12 oz. bottle purchased at the brewery, unknown brewing/bottling date, poured into my New Glarus flute-like glass, drank over 30 minutes"

"Pumpkin Pie Lust pours a hazy deep brown color with a small but long lasting lacing head.  There is a very mellow aroma, with hints of cinnamon and pumpkin.  The taste has pumpkin flavors, hints of cinnamon and all spice.  Good body, weaker flavors.  Overall its a very easy drinking pumpkin ale, lighter flavors, but still enjoyable."
""
""
"Pours deep wood brown with a haze and a finger and a half billowing fluffy tan head that retain nicely. Smell has pumpkin wheat and nutty malt aromas forward along woth a slightly musty smell. Some light cinnamon, nutmeg, and spice aromas are on the back end. Taste has more musty pumpkin and sweet malt flavors forward followed by an interesting flavor I can only describe as coca cola. Light spice flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg in the finish. Medium light body is cut by high carbonation."

"The smell was promising but the upfront wheat came as a shocker. After a while all I could taste was the wheat. Seems to be the same weizen yeast used in Dancing Man Wheat (not a fan)."

"Overall: I'm not a fan of the style, but this one was pretty well done. I won't go out of my way to find it again, but I  would gladly drink it if it was available."

"T - Spice.  Light wheat.  Squash."

"perfect balance in the mouth feel between dry and stickyness. stickyness is not to sweet which is nice."
"Taste veers toward a waxy vegetal taste, supported by the requisite nutmeg and cinnamon notes, but the body is a bit thin and flaccid. The bones are there but the balance isn't. Could use a touch more body, and a little vanilla sweetness to round things out. As it is, it's merely good."

"It's an interesting beer.  A lighter dunkelweizen, with pumpkin spices added."

"Poured from a bottle. Everything about this beer, from nose to finish, is pumpkin pie. It's exactly as advertised. It leaves me craving whipped cream. It's not the best pumpkin beer, but it's quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Overall an okay beer. I like it for a pumpkin beer but it is lacking a certain beer like quality."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good German style twist on a pumpkin beer. Good presence of Weiss yeast with the fall spices."

"Pour is a cloudy dark brown with a tight tan head.  Nose has grain, cinnamon, all spice, and light phenol notes. Taste is grain, lighter pumpkin spice, a hint of phenol and lightly metallic.  Some clove, moderate carb, lighter body."

"Dark wheat, pumpkin spicing...nutmeg, clove, cinnamon though no pumpkin, yeast....plenty of dunkel with a nice addition of spicing. Unique and something different that separates itself from many current pumpkin beers."

"The first 2 bottles out of the 6er i bought were more spicy than pumpkin, actually didn't really taste pumpkin in either one. That being said, i enjoyed the hefe style of the beer with the added spice, very drinkable. Good beer!"
""
""
""

"Overall: Certainly a different take on a pumpkin beer.  Not sure I'm in love with it but at least it is different.  I could certainly use a lot more pumpkin and spices."

"It was nice to have a pumpkin beer brewed as as a hefeweizen. I do wish the taste was more pumpkiney."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Smells like pumpkin pie but the bright, citrusy flavor throws of the balance of what we'd expect to be a smooth, wheat-forward, pie spice finish. Not bad, but not the best pumpkin beer we've had."
""
"Final score: 3.96"
"Awesome that NG finally came out with a pumpkin beer, and did a great job on it.  This beer is a beautiful cloudy orangish brown (it is a part-wheat beer and brewed using weisen yeast, so it is supposed to be cloudy).  nifty lacing.  The spices are there, heaviest on the nutmeg, but not at all overwhelming.  the style is almost perfect for a pumpkin beer, which imho does not benefit from a crisp lager treatment.  not very sweet, but this aids in the drinkability department.  I sure as hell hope they bring this back in future years--I'll certainly be enjoying it while it lasts this season!"

"Spicy aroma. Dark brown hazy body. Sweet tasting. Has some spice as well. Actually a little tangy. Sort of like pumpkin pie. I've had better and worse. This is average."

"O - New Glarus' first pumpkin beer; long has it been anticipated! And, instead of going the normal route, they've carved out a brand new path in the world of pumpkin beers - a pumpkin weiss! (I've yet to experience one - even the pumpkin beer connoisseur I am.) Pumpkin Pie Lust's aroma is immediately different and hard to pinpoint with both pie spices and weiss yeast being used in conjunction but, this beer has a great malt profile that carries through the flavor into the soft feel making it a unique and quite drinkable pumpkin beer from one of my favorite breweries!"
"This pours a murky brown color with a foamy light brown head. The aroma is rich with pumpkin and spices. The flavor is smooth and rich with pumpkin and spice flavors. Delicious and well-made."

"This one smells amazing.  The flavor is okay (above average), and the body is thin.  Good enough to get it again, but not my favorite pumpkin bier."
""
"I was hesitant to try this beer due to the pumpkin ales I have tried in the past.  This one tastes great and should be given the credit it deserves."
"A solid pumpkin beer. I don't want a pumpkin beer that is too in your face with pumpkin pie spice but I could have used just a little bit more from this one. Also, the appearance was very cloudy which reminded me of a homebrew that doesn't have proper clarity."
"Better than pumpkin pie in a bottle! It is very fruit forward and almost creamy in the mouth. Not bitter or abrasive, but most notes of cinnamon, cardamon, and clove are hidden deep within this amber."
