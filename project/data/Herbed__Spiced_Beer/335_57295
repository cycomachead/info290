It could be that I've never had good mole but at the same time I feel like this beer is underwhelming.  I love the crap out of Xocoveza and some other offerings of a similar nature but this beer is just sad in comparison.  the peppery flavor is there but nothing else supports it and the entire beer just seems to fall a little flat in the area of flavor.","SHODriver","Feb 13, 2015"

4.5,28.2,,,,,,"Popping the cap reveals a tart nose scented with a little ripe fruit just on the verge of getting too ripe and some reconstituted dried dark chilis. The beer pours ruby chestnut under a 1‚Äù white foam cap that dissipates to a quick film. The palate starts tart and fruity and then the Mexican chocolate flavors come forward and a dried chili flavor, possibly ancho, slight smoke, a green chili vegetal taste, a hint of coffee, a very light tartness suggesting vinegar and pickled green chili to finish with a touch of chili heat. Although the idea of the beer sounds outrageous, everything is restrained and very well balanced here, exquisitely layered and deliciously complex without getting too muddied. The beer contains a wide variety of flavors but allows each to speak for itself. The beer is very creamy with a medium full body and medium carbonation. The carbonation is smooth and not harsh.","pat61","Nov 16, 2014"

3.78,7.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/11/2013. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, raisin, plum, pear, caramel, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, chili pepper, light coffee, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, raisin, plum, pear, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chili pepper, light coffee, herbal, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Slight pepper heat on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, raisin, plum, pear, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light coffee, light chili pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with light-moderate chili/coffee presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and fairly smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good chili beer. Good balance, robustness, complexity of malt, yeast ester, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 16, 2014"

4.21,19.9,3.25,4,4.5,4,4.25,"Reddish brown pour had a small amount of fizzy carbonation, and formed a fleeting, and small head. The overall look was very similar to a glass of Coca Cola. The smell had a lot of cherry in it, along with the fruit were hints of chocolate. The taste showed off the chocolate a lot more than the smell. The dry fruit flavors (prune, raisins, dried cherries) were also there, and the chiles showed up strongest in the finish. Lots of complexity here, along with similarity to the Mexican sauce this beer was named after. Very soft in the mouth, with a velvety texture. Looking at the other reviews, this beer seems to me underrated to me.","rajendra82","Dec 15, 2013"

The chile heat is at the right level, but the chocolate is thin and watery, and there is no solid malt background to support anything, and no other spice notes to play off of the chile and chocolates. A nice idea for a beer, but needs some retooling.","Georgiabeer","Nov 17, 2013"

3.87,10.3,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer, I was a little gun shy about pepper beers ever since I tried Original C Cave Creek Chili Beer but this beer wasn't nearly as spicy while still retaining a nice authentic chili pepper taste and the chocolate was dark, rich and represented well, those two different flavors went together pretty well. This beer had pretty good drinkability for what it is, the 8% alcohol was covered up pretty well by the chocolate and slightly warming chili's, I don't think I could take out the whole bomber but it's the perfect amount to split with someone else so I am glad I got my brother to help me drink this. What I liked most about this beer the flavor, the chocolate and chili's went together nicely and it wasn't overly spicy, pretty good balance. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad but it was little sticky and the carbonation was pretty low and could have been bumped up a couple notches. I wouldn't buy this beer regularly but it makes for a nice once in a while beer and I can only imagine that this beer would go good with some nice Mexican cuisine, I will have to test that out sometime. I would recommend giving this beer a try, don't let the fact that there are chili's in it scare you off, they offer a lot more flavor then heat and this might make a good entrance into the Chili Beer style. I am starting to really like some of New Holland's more experimental beers, they got a good knack at trying something a little different, so I think they should take more risks on more different beers like this one. So far this is the best beer I have had from the High Gravity Series, and the best chili beer I have had to date. Keep thinking out of the box every once in a while New Holland, you guys got some talent when it comes to some of these crazier beers.","StoutHunter","Oct 29, 2011"

The nose is a lambast of burnt cocoa, backed by a strange melange of toasted caramel, roasted marshmallows, and nicely seered salmon. Something here just doesn't seem right. The taste echoes a bit, starting with some burnt gingerbread and overdone banana bread, followed by some caramelized sugars, mole sauce (just as advertised, I guess), and a finish of smoked nutmeg, coffee, dark chocolate, and cinnamon. I have no idea what to think. It's sorta good and sorta horrible. Wow. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a strangely dry and almost sticky finish. I like the idea behind this, I suppose, but the execution was thoroughly botched.

Curiously, while the liquid is actually fairly clear, the grimy reddish-brown color more reminiscent of clay-based mud, more zinc orange hues brighten the rims. Huge jelly roll of milk chocolate, caramel and toffee dominates the nose, that said, cumin, paprika spices present along with a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper, these elements occluded by bodacious prune, plum, black grape, raisin, black cherry fruit scents, if you have the patience you might be able to get some charcoal dust and peat moss, overall the nose gets the "truth in advertising" award vis-√†-vis the label. Full-bodied and close to heavy, the sheer mass of it pushes the carbonation off the tongue and outwards towards your cheeks. Oodles and oodles of chocolate, accompanied by butterscotch and caramel, could be sold in the candy aisle as much as the beer aisle. The "Mexican spiciness" gets sort of lost in the shuffle here, if anything more heat than flavor. Focus teases out orange citrus, granola and scone notes. This is a very enjoyable "sipper" that does not deviate much from the script, arguably for the best.","farrago","Jun 08, 2010"
