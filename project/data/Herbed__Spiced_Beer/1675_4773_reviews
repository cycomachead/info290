"I have been getting really really into the Italians lately, and these guys are among the best. this is a cool little beer, definitely overpriced, but they all are I feel like from Italy. a wheat base it feels like, hazy and just bronzed a little, with a tall white head. it smells herbal, but I cant place any of the herbs. its not quite tea, not quite dried flowers, not quite citrusy, but in proximity to all of that. still it seems simpler than that on the taste, delicate for sure, with a really distinct and pungent yeast strain and a definitely fruit quality in the finish. a touch of sweetness like clover honey brings it together, and the hops are like dried straw in a field. carbonation is awesome, feel is rich and round for what it is. I had a really hard time picking out exactly what the spices in here were, but the whole is a really nice drink. I wish we could get four packs of this for what single bottles cost, that's my only complaint"

"O: hmmm... guessing this might be a tad aged... I would imagine this would smell and taste much more dynamic fresh... the way it stands now, I've had several American beers (IPAs) that taste quite similar to this, minus the peculiar peppery element... curious to try it again, just have to be willing to fork over the dough otra vez"

"Dark, cloudy, unfiltered appearance. Orange-brown in color. Wonderful sweet smell. Delicious full citrus, spicy flavor. Minimal carbonation, fairly flat. Full bodied feel in the month; fairly heavy. Great flavor. Delicious. I had two glasses when at a restaurant tonight and want more!"

"D - Very good herbed beer; well-brewed; great spice taste (not too overpowering) and very nice malt flavoring; I recommend to anyone who likes light Belgian style or herbed beers"

"maybe my senses are off or the style doesnt suit me, not impressed."
"I am glad I saved this for a special occasion as it deserved my full attention. This review is a little bittersweet, as this is the last of the brews I brought back from my Italy trip. Alas, now all I have left are my memories."
"High carbonation works well."
""
""
"Thanks to Cameron (TheBishopco) for this brew!"
""
"O: This is pretty interesting as the beer initially has a smell like a Belgian pale ale that then the spicy notes really come out and take over. The taste is similar to the smell and there is quite a bit of complexity to both. Enjoyable but not sure that I could have more than one of these in a session."
""
""
""
""
""
"O...Overall a stand out beer, and a surprise since I've never heard of it. Great melding of flavors with fruit and spice. A great beer to have anytime, but I would especially like on a cold holiday night around a fire with family and friends."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: What a unique brew. I can't identify half of the flavors in this one (no idea what myrrh or kamut is) but I can tell you that is has quite a complex variety of well-balanced flavors. And they are all pretty damn good. This is an excellent beer for the style, albeit quite unusual and unique. Not in a bad way either. Not sure I'd pay $20 for this beer on a regular basis but it stands alone in its category. Never had anything even remotely similar to this one."
"2006 Edition: Bright sparkly golden in body with white bubbly head that stays. Smells of tart cider, apple pie but without the crust, little citrus. Tastes cider-like: apple pie mush, tart, sour notes, light cinnamon pear. Light in body with prickly carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very interesting and complex spiced beer that keeps you coming back for more. I wish I had more than the 8.45 oz. bottle, but that's all they had in stock. Definitely recommended"

"I am really glad to have come across this. A great beer, and something I will grab in the future if I see it. Recommended."

"O: A bit too sweet for my liking, but complex and interesting."
"Golden orange clear body, a finger of quick dissipation head, some visible carbonation. Cedar dominates the nose, significant myrrh backbone with orange pith not peel citrus notes, floral hops. The ginger is prominent taste-wise though the cedar and especially the myrrh adds complexity, not very hoppy, more botanical than spicy IMO. Mouthfeel is medium, decent effervescence. A nice end to a epic day of beer tasting, pairs well with Italian cookies :)"
""
""
""
"O: An odd beer. Nice to taste but immensely difficult to analyse."
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed Nora; the perfumed notes (which I will presume to be the myrrh) added an extra dimension to an already solid Belgian pale ale. If it weren't so expensive I would be happy to buy this again."
"Overall this has suddenly jumped into my top 5 beers. Highly recommended to have with bread/crackers. Absolutely delicious."
""
"This poured out with a hazy golden color and a decent sized white fizzy head on top. The lacing is nowhere to be seen and the retention is gone within minutes also. The smell of the beer is sweet, a little boozy with some nice soft wheat like aromas. The taste of this beer is spicy, it has elements of pepper, and it also has some hints of apple and orange in there. The spices really set this off. The mouthfeel has a bit of a sting to it. The tastebuds are left tingling and dry after each sip. Overall I found this brew to be really interesting. If the price tsg was a little lower I could see myself buyin this one again in a heartbeat."

"Really interesting, spicy ale."

"O: A very interesting beer, very different from anything I have had before, it is very easy to drink, but has a lot going on. I probably would not buy this often because of the price, but I wish I could afford to have this all the time. Highly recommended."
"A pleasant, quite sweet beer, lots of wheat beer notes here. Most of the flavours here are really lifted from page one of ""how to brew a wheat beer""."
"Exceptionally fresh and drinkable, and very, very refined. It reminds me in some ways of a Bi√®re de Champagne. Certainly the dry finish and sophistication give it this character. The spices are so beautifully done. They complement the style and the flavour of the beer, and never seem like a gimmick. In fact, this beer almost makes you feel like this *is* how beer should be made."
"O: I've known of this beer for years, but never got around to trying it since it's so expensive. Seeing it on-tap I jumped on the chance. Quite a good beer, complex, very tasty, a contemplative effort."
"Mouthfeel is wonderful. Chewy, sweet up front, sugary, filling out the palate, with a viscous wheat body, and mild tart notes with smoothness running down the tongue with a semi dry finish."
"Pours hazy tinted golden color with all kinds of stuff floating around in there. Aroma is spicy and yeasty at first but the more I smell the more I get a sweet citrus fruit (tangerine). Spicy with ginger taste. It is hard to describe it perfectly. It has some sourness to it which I wasn't expecting, but it is balanced with sweet citrus. Strange aftertaste, kinda metalic, maybe the myrrh? Medium body with the perfect amount of carbonation imo. Very clean tasting. Very good drink. Easily the best beer I've had from Italy."
"Poured into a standard italian table wine glass and drunk from the apartment terrace in Spolleto, May 2011. Have been seeking to further my Baladin education and this one is the best for me so far. The complexities begin with the nose, honeyed sour sweet, excellent head on the pour, great glass lacing, the belgian yeast makes for a candied carbonation. the first sip discerns a taste profile that reminds me of Duvel, only deeper richer. The color and the glass lacing are the same but a more complex flavor profile; wasn't sure of the spice notes, thought ginger and per BA I guess I am right othe spices I cannot identify but find this beer extremely, extremely drinkable and balanced. Great finish makes me more than ready for the next sip. No discernable alchohol burn, the beer is so smooth. Would pair with a fish or chicken couscous, would be so yummy. A great eye-opening beer from a game-changing and ever-evolving brewery."
"WS"
"overall: IMO, not that great, my friends thought so as well. someone mentioned it reminded them of sam adams cranberry lambic which i agreed with. definatly not worth the 12$ price tag (and that was on sale!). one of the most wine like beers ive ever had."
"Overall, a really well put-together and easy drinking spiced beer that won't offend anyone."
"Overall: This Italian product of Egyptian influence certainly exceeded my expectations, which were moderately high. The Egyptians must have had it pretty good if their beer was anything like this."
"This is a prime example of excellence in beer, ladies and gents. Cheers!"
"Bottle: Poured a clear light golden color ale with a large pure white foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some light fruity notes. Taste is sweeter then expected with a solid malt backbone and some light fruity ester. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed though too sweet for my own taste and different malt are hard to distinguish."
"Dryness of the acids and carbonation gives a spicy and snappy finish after the fullness of the bubbly senesation first. The mid palate is firm and medium that allows for a characterful transition from the early expansion to the late spicy dryness."
"Review from notes. Tasted from bottle at The Purple Pig. Pours a cloudy pale orange with a thick white head that leaves heavy lace. Nose has the signature aroma of Belgian yeast with some banana and fresh orange peel. It almost smells like white wine with a grape and earth aroma. Flavor is bittersweet orange peel with some spices and banana yeastiness. The body is full and coating with lively carbonation and a long yeasty orange finish. There is an acidity that makes this beer great with food."
"Beer is medium in bodied and finishes pretty dry, it tastes like flowers....it's very flavorful, like lavender and tea leaves. It's deceptively strong flavored. Interesting but probably not my cup of tea."
"Let's start with the bottle. It sets up the whole experience with Nora. It's a unique shape for a unique beer. The beer itself is exquisite, smooth and highly drinkable. So far I have tried Nora and Super and overall I am quite impressed with this brewery."
"D: Very drinkable, only knock is a slight booziness for the 6.8%, needs to be a little more balanced, but very nice beer overall!"
"D: High. Delicate and well done. It brings good reputation to the new generation of Italian beers... :)"
"pale strong with herbs floating around at the bottom of the bottle. pour is a cloudy golden. thought i was getting a saison at first. but the head was leaner. nose was very herbal. quite of bit of licorice and peppery hops. palate was just that. pepper, licorice, coriander and a bit of an astringent citrus sweet. extremely herbal. undetectable abv."
"In all a good beer but not living up to the hype."
"Drinkability is good, a really nice Belgian style ale, complex without being overwhelming to the palate, digestible and smooth. Still, one 750ml bottle is plenty."
"Poured a moderate gold with a few orange highlights. Plenty of visible carbonation bubbles. The nose is full of spices, along with some citrus and a tiny bit of earthiness. Flavor takes it up another notch with loads of well-balanced spice and intricacies. Very complex. Mouthfeel is good with the right amount of carbonation. Excellent drinkability, as the brew is intense yet quite quaffable."
"D: Interesting, but difficult to finish. Is this really a beer?"
"Feel and Drinkability: Body is medium-heavy with low carbonation. Alcohol seems to creep through a bit. Low carbonation helps to complete this one. Upon closer inspection I think that the warmth from the alcohol and the spices-especially the oakiness/piney/fragrant incense-gives off a minty type of deal, like a menthol cigarette, but not as obnoxious or as strong. This is one that I'll gladly drink the rest of and will be on the look out for again. Such a unique beer, if you see this grab it."
"Drinkability: Not a particularily memorable ale, and not knowing the additives did nothing to aid the drinking experience"
"Split a large bottle at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA. They say the beer has some Egyptian inpriation, but it basically drinks and tastes like a spiced Belgian pale ale. It's very smooth and light on the palate with obvious orange peel and a white pepper finish. There are hint of ginger along with the vanilla spice and white bread. If you don't mind the spice, it's worth a try."
"Pours a cloudy orange-gold with a fizzy white head that disappears rather quickly. Smells very spicy, with loads of ginger and something else that I'm guessing is myrrh. Slightly citric, floral, and with an overall bready malt character. The same spices are strong in the taste as well, along with floral notes and some earthy character. Quite tangy overall with a dry finish. Light-medium body that is pretty effervescent. Interesting to be sure, though overspiced."
"D Fine drinkability but this is not my favorite Baladin."
"I tried it for the first time last week with a Spanish dish of roast pork loin stuffed with figs & prunes... probably the best food & beer match I ever had. Would do amazingly well with real sharp cheeses and the fruit perserves that are often served alongside, I reckon. It's expensive but I plan to keep a bottle on hand at all times."
"I can't say that I understand this beer but I like it, just don't know how much I could drink."
"Ok - still not sure what to think. drinkability is pretty good (less the phlegm). I like it - then I don't like it - then I like it again. worth a try."
"Purchased at Whole Foods on the Bowery with a bottle of Sella Del Diavolo and Nice Chouffe 08. Poured into a Lucifer Snifter. First impressions: the color is definitely a Saison. Orange-amber hue with the color of clover honey. Thin, pure white head with persistent retention- some lacing. The aroma is pungently bitter herbs and orange. This is certainly a good looking beer but something suprising is how little effervescence there is in this- it's very dry and the effect is somewhat flat on the tongue. Flavor throws a kind of a curve ball too. It was barnyardy, hay-like and with a strong perfume of myrrh. I know this beer is brewed with an ancient Egyptian grain and this drinks like an ancient recipe. I drank this solo and I think it's better suited to drinking with food than enjoying on it's own."
"Overall this is one interesting beer, although I'm on the fence about how much I like it. I'm glad I gave it a try, but I think one will be enough."
"Quite the holiday treat and a nice beer to see on draft in the NW."
"The aroma is sweet with yeast, malt, spices, and fruit. The appearance is hazy amber gold. The head is decent. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall it's OK but nothing special. This is another disappointment with a nice bottle but too expensive for what it is."
"Other reviews well explain the taste,all I can add is the notable drinkability,you can justify it with the curiosity but when you are aware of the 6.8 ABV all you can say is : good beer."
"Good stuff..."
"D: This one was pretty drinkable; nice spice, refreshing. Glad I tried this."
"D: moderate drinkability but failed to leave me wanting more."
"T: My first reaction was... celery seed? Even cold the spices came through nicely. I don't know what's in there, exactly, but it sure is good. There's a hint of sourness in the background but nothing on the level of a Lambic. Maybe a little coriander in there? Very interesting stuff. Like a Flemish Red crossed with Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray. Finishes very dry. Delicious, super-drinkable. I don't usually associate spiced beers with ""summer brews"" but this one was crazy refreshing on a blazing hot day. Would go great with Indian food, I think. Definitely be buying more of this one..."
"Very easy to drink with complex flavors slowly coming to the forefront the more I tasted. Light on the tongue with a sudden blast of bubbles as it hits the top of your mouth. It would be very easy to finish the bomber in one sitting."
"This bottle was purchased at Winchester Wine and Spirits. Poured in to a wide mouthed wine glass a hazy orange, with little heading, and lively carbonation. Smell has essences of honey, chamomile, ginger, cinnamon and wild flowers. All in all very spicy in aroma. Taste is more of the same, with a prickly spiced character that curiously sneaks around the palate. Body is on the light side, with very little alcohol present in the taste. I must say that it was a bit difficult to drink. The spice and overall huge complexity make it one that I would drink in small samples. Cheers"
"This beer pours a nice golden amber color. An off-white head disappeared quickly but left a trace of itself. It smell earthy and spicy, but not overpowering. There is a hint of a woody smell. The flavor is wonderful. Not too sweet, but a little sweetness. I taste orange, but not citrusy. It definitely has an earthy taste upfront followed by a mild herby spiciness. It is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Definitely a quality beer. For some reason it makes me crave Jamaican Jerk Chicken."
"Recommended. I had neglected this too long and was afraid the age would have negatively affected it. However, this drinks beautifully. My guess is those spices help this beer keep."
"D: A unique, well-made spice beer, find this if you can. It really does remind me of DFH's Midas Touch, and I'd love to attain another bottle for a comparison. A bit thin, but incredibly drinkable."
"The color of the beer is dark golden moving toward orange capped off by a nice fluffy head that dissipated quickly. The aroma is spicy and sweet with some earthy herbs. The beer is light on the palate with a bit of carbonation. The flavor is complex: sweet fruit in particular oranges, spiciness, dry with some residual bitterness and acidity. The finish is long and dry. This beer is complex and very unique and I like it for that. I could finish off the 750 mL bottle in no time."
"This beer is a a total pleasure to drink. At 6.8% ABV, it would be all too easy to drink two or three if the price tag wasn't a bit on the steep side (12 or 13 dollars if I recall correctly). I originally chose a 4 for ""drinkability"" in the pull down menu above, but as I've been sipping on this fine ale and writing this review, I moved it first up to 4.5 and then finally to 5. I'd recommend this brew to anyone, whether they be a fan of beer in general, or even a wine connoisseur. This is certainly one for anybody who loves the ""spiced"" style. Drink up. Amazing!"
"The drinkability is very good for the type of beer it is. Usually a spiced beer is hard to drink a lot of, but this was surprisingly drinkable."
"This beer almost defies classification. Good head that deflates quickly, rich if murky color, and HUGE chunks of yeast upon pouring. Not much lacing. Some say it is best with food, but I think the opposite: drink this by itself to get the full experience. Not much hop presence, if any. Aromas of rose water, nutmeg, and feminine musk. A bit like sniffing panties while drinking beer."
"Drinkability? Well, I'm drinking it. The alcohol isn't all that much, and it would seem to go over well with many different foods. I like it and would buy again."
"I was not a fan of this beer and would not recommend it."
"The mouthfeel was one of the highlights for me, great levels of carbonation and a nice light feeling make this a great beer to drink a lot of, but it's not packaged or priced like a beer that's a session beer. Regardless, i loved bits and pieces of this, while overall i felt like it was missing something."
"D-very nice outdoorsy beer and very good with some brie goat cheese and brasaola. This is a very unique beer and one I will get again despite the high price."
"Pours a hazy dark golden with a pretty nice head that fades to a thin cap and leaves some light lacing. The smell is intriguing with the aroma of lightly fermented honey, sweet orange peel, fresh ginger, and light muskiness. The taste is more of the same but a good deal more intense than the smell, with bright orange, a sweet and sour flavor reminiscent of fermented honey, ginger, and perhaps some grapes as well.There is alittle bit of a sweet spicy hit on the finish. Mouthfeelis creamy and spritzy and on the light side. Very refreshing and quite interesting.I'm definitely interested in their other products now."
"Cheers!"
"A good beer. Interesting. Good for pseudo-special occaisions."
"Explodes out of bottle with a thick creamy head that takes a while to fade leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Spicy/floral nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet and sour, hints of pepper, different from other spiced beers. Pricey, $12.40 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Pours a clear orange with a medium white head that leaves almost no lacing. The smell is very ""bisquity"" with corriander,pepper, clove,banana, and a champagne ""dryness' to it. The taste is crisp with a hop bite along with a creamy bunch of flavors. Cloves,banana,hops,corriander,pepper.and lemon make this a complex flavor mixture. The m/f is medium,but alittle syrupy and medicanal,but not bad. A decent beer,alittle flawed,but you can drink it easily enough. Cheers."
"It pours golden orange color into the tulip glass. The scent is strong: vanilla, clove and coriander dominate. The taste reminded me of a ginger snap. There wasn't a terribly gingery taste per se, just the sugary and spice mix. It was a very interesting beer, that I enjoyed. I was drinking some Unibroue's offerings previous to this and that was more of my speed."
"Interesting, really like a Belgian ale with amped up carbonation and some mouth puckering/dryness. Very champagne-like, but sweeter with the addition of malts. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: Lots of unusual and interesting flavors goign on; hard to drink the whole bottle, however"
"Nora is expensive but well worth it, goes great with roasted pork tenderloin."
"This brew is a hazy golden, honey-colored beer. The head is dense, thick, and quite sticky. It sports an interesting aroma¬Öa wheat-like twang, a little cinnamon and sugar, lemon and orange peel, yeast, and a slightly wild vinous character. It¬ís a spritzy aroma, very much alive, and almost champagne like. The beer is moderately dry, with a lot of malt and spice flavor. Soft mouthfeel, with a medium body, and a refreshing dryness. The spice, with some peppery notes, is accentuated in the finish. Although I¬ím usually partial to more traditional beers, this one is sure an interesting and flavorful brew."
"Notes: This was a nights worth of depth. So many spices and fruits that I'm spent and done for the evening. Not sure what could possibly follow this. I liked it and reccomend it."
"Pours a beautiful hazy golden with an initially robust white head that leaves behind thick, persistent lace. Sweet malt and ginger in the aroma. The flavor of this one, unlike so many other ¬ìherbed/spiced¬î ales, is pleasantly dry and more subdued. It¬ís got a nice ginger spice that is sharp but not too overbearing and a nicely balancing malty sweetness that features hints of honey, some definite pale malt fruitiness and a light graininess. The overall flavor is rich, spicy but still quite drinkable. Be warned, though, if you just can¬ít stand ginger in beer, avoid this one. Otherwise, highly recommended."
"Served from a beautiful champagne like bottle, this was an excellent surprise when I went for dinner at Prune in NYC. Pours out a hazy light amber, with a champagne like head that dazzles, then dissapears. This has such a complex and unique nose to it, almost like something between a lambic and a saison. It has some apples, ande incense, and ginger in the nose. This continues to develop into white wine, some spice like cinnamon, and sourness (lemon, soap?). The taste is so very individual and expressive, banana, clove, grass, ginger, rain, citrus zest, corriander/cilantro, flowers, honeysuckle, pepper, and crysanthimum. I can go on, every time I drink it, I get something new. Wonderful! It's a little chewy in the mouth, and the finish is full of the honeysuckle and crysanthimum floralness, there's no getting away from it. A nice treat, but honestly, I can do only so much of it. A great beer experience, it's quite choice. If you have the means, I highly reccomend it."
"Nora is yet another unique Italian beer that doesn't live up to its reputation from where I sit. Any brewery can come up with a list of ingredients that sounds interesting on paper, but turning it into worthwhile beer is a whole 'nother matter. Maybe Super Baladin will be what I'm looking for."
"Overall one of the more or most unique beers i've had. Very interesting and quite delicious."
"Mouthfeel- A palate of ancient times. Of beating, pyramid building, and mummification. A little yeasty, but the moldy kind, the bready kind. Has a good overall nuance of acidity and dryness."
"I can't say thanks enough to Tom at the Blind Pig in Champaign, IL for the opportunity to try this."
"Light haze, soft peach with copper highlights, topped by a thick finger of clingy, off-white head. Beautiful. Nose is fairly complex and inviting with notes of lightly sweet malt, kinda sugary and marshmallowy, wheat tang, fruit (banana mostly), pepper, coriander, and lots of citrus zest. Taste is centered around soft, tangy, sweet wheat malts. Notes of graham cracker, and banana cocktail, before spice and citrus zest take over. Finish is yeasty and peppery. Very soft mouthfeel, with a medium body. Very refreshing and complex. Different in a gruit sort of way, but way citrus-ier. Goes well with lots of different foods I bet."
"75 cl bottle. $12.49 at Lee & Edwards in Roanoke, Va."
"Thanks to merlin48 for bringing this one our way. This one pours a cloudy yellow color with a small head that falls off fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is just wild. Tons and tons of flowery aroma, with a lemony kick. The flavor is just as odd. Tastes like chewing on flowers, mixed with a little bit of pepper. Just wild. The mouthfeel is slightly thicker than expected, but very nice and very drinkable. What a strange and tasty brew."
"So, now I know what ""horse-blankets"" smell like. Hefe-weizen color of hazy gold. Small but lasting head of white froth. Funky nose, as I said, and at first taste I didn't like this beer. A little medicinal and metallic, and flavors I generally would describe as tart. After a while, this beer grew on me, and the mellowing effects did as well. Alcohol warmth combined with a saliva inducing sourdough bread flavor and a dry, tart finish."
"Notes: really nice label (on all the Baladin brews), I like this style of 750 bottle too, just like the DeuS. Definitely a bit pricey at $12.99 (Harrington's in Chelmsford) but it is a fine Italian beer."
"A big thanks to merlin48 for giving me and clvand0 the opportunity. What a champ. The brew pours a hazy straw color with a 2 finger head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is really nice. There is a lot going on in the nose. Sweet, lemoney-citrusy, spicey and floral. Damn. The flavor is very floral...kind of like I'm drinking flowers. there is a light spiceyness in there..nit quite peppery but not something I can put my finger on. Very interesting. The feel is moderate to thick, slightly creamy ith a moderate carbonation. I really do like this beer. It is nice to be drinking it with the windows open here in the spring. This one will keep me really looking forward to the other brew we have from this brewery. Thanks again Sam."
"This beer pours a hazy flourescent orange color with a tall fizzy white head. A little lacing shows along the glass. Aroma is of peaches and spices but they're very light here. Then there's an acidic note, like citric fruit. Taste reminds me of a Belgian Pale with lots of spices added in. It's a soft beer with soft flavors. Light fruits mix with pale malts and other grains. I can't find any hops in here. Spices take their place and are really the dominant show here. There might be coriander but I'm only guessing here. Anyways the spices are complex but overtake the other nuances that this beer has. Finish is drying from the spices and yeast but lingers a bit. A good beer, but probably not worth it for me to spend the $$ to get this again."
"Drinkability: I really like this one. Definitely, it's different than anything I've ever tried, but overall it has some characteristics of a fine Saison tucked inside the myriad of exotic spices, florals, and fruits. A bit expensive, but worth the effort to seek out. I would never have guessed this was brewed in Italy, if I were tasting it blind. No hint of the alcohol content is able to poke through all the complexity here."
"03/04 is stamped on the back of the bottle, don't know if that is a bottling date or a drink-by date. The Baladin website says this is modeled off of an ancient Egyptian beer, that's very cool in my book. Nora is cloudy peach-orange in color, the head is short and creamy. The aroma is lightly sweet and of orange peels. The smell also contains just a tiny bit of spice. The taste is lightly sweet and citrusy. Spices are noted as a means to balance out the beer. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth which leads to great drinkability. This seems like a good choice for summertime."
"This is a little unusual. Doesn't really taste like anything I've ever had before. It is however, quite tasty. It poured a cloudy orange with some tiny bits of what I would guess to be yeast and other debris. Nice fluffy white foamy head that subsides to a thin white ring arong the perimeter of the glass. The smell is quite sweet and certainly contains alot of spice and quite a bit of an apricot smell. The taste is much less powerful than the smell. The taste, like the smell, has some spice and some apricot to it, but much less concentrated than the smell. The mouth feel is very pleasant. I can't tell if it has no carbonation, or if it is carbonated but has tiny, tightly knit bubbles. Either way, it's quite easy to drink. Very pleasant."
"Vaguely hazy but it is basically clear, the liquid is a beautiful gold in hue with a slight coppery highlight. The head was an active, bubbly white foamy mass that rested gracefully on top of the beer. Head retention was fair; it quickly turned to a soapy island with naked pockets, thin collar. There was no subsequent lacing. On a whole the appearance is attractive. The nose is soft. The potency is moderate. In fact it seems a little fickle, at first anyway. The more I sniffed the more I noticed. Flowers. A greenhouse filled with flowers¬Ö on a sunny day. Can a beer smell sunny? Nora does. Traces of fresh honey, light sweetness too. Peppery. Spicy, ginger it seems. Fruity, apricots and peaches I believe. Malt is cracker-like. Herbal. The nose is great; it is like Duvel mixed with a saison. If the smell were more forceful it would be perfection. Inviting. The palate is unique. I translated a blurb on Le Baladin¬ís website but that didn¬ít quench my thirst on this beer. Regardless, I think this is a fantastic beverage. It is so light in body, so soft with its touch and yet some flavorful. There are tons going on with this beer yet my tastebuds don¬ít get slaughtered, they get rewarded. This beer is amazingly complex. I can think of very few beers that have such a vast flavor and none taste like this one. The palate is dry and sweet and spicy and herbal and fruity. Details¬Ö the dryness is cracker-like at times. However the overall dryness is like Brut Champagne. Nice. The sweetness is soft and playful, kisses of honey, very light caramel notes. Juicy. Fruits are in play. There is a citrus zip, apricots, peaches, and a smidgen of grapes. Spiciness seems to be, in part, derived from ginger. Peppery. Then it becomes herbal towards the back, before ending on a sweet note and the slightest bit of alcohol heat. On the whole the palate is very tasty. This beer is amazing; it is so delicate! It is beyond comparison. Medium in body, the carbonation is moderately high (but not lively enough, IMO, as this beer is just a little tacky) but the mouthfeel is very pleasant and ideal for the flavor profile. Is this beer drinkable? Yes, you ass! Haven¬ít you been reading my review? The delicate flavors could be matched with equally delicate foods like fish or waffles at brunch. Maybe even a very, very mild cheese and some rye crackers. Maybe the best pairing for this beer is a couple glasses so it can be shared with friends. I really like this beer; I wish I could drink it again (soon). But I haven¬ít seen it in my usual hangouts (not in Nebraska because we don¬ít get shit here, I mean in Kansas City or Iowa City). I purchased this bottle in Burnsville, MN. Unforgettable. World Class."
"Drinkability: This a smooth drink for special occasions, would pair well with any meal that is heavy in carbohydrates and salty. Its a little expensive versus the beer's quality."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very mellow pale malt scent with spices and a fruity yeast finish. I heard from someone that it is supposed to have the aroma of an old cathedral. The taste is good as well. It has a nice pale malt flavor that boasts of spices. It goes down smooth and finishes a bit tart. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine spiced Belgian ale. It has it all: aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel; a good drinker."
"Poetry."
"The acidity and sweetness really accentuate the fresh apple character of this beer. Also the acidity almost seems to have a tamarind character to it. This is quite tasty, and has an herbal quality to it that only adds to the beer."
"pours out a highly carbonated copperish colour, with a big foamy snow white head. lots of must and fruit aromas. ample head leaves lots of lace. initial estery flavours of ginger, honey, melon, apricot, and orange. all very subdued and intertwined. malt tilts toward the caramel spectrum, although very lightly. ghostly spicy...alcohol lends some pepper. there is a flowery aspect of this ale that i'm not sure comes from the light hopping or the fruity essence. the mouthfeel is astounding. with all the charged up carbonation, i was expecting a soda like fizzy mouthfeel, but i am pleased at the silky smooth, well rounded and succulent body of this ale. goes down exceptionally well. some warming in the belly is detected, also. finishes light and dry with a bit of musty fruit lingering in the aftertaste. this is a very nice quaffer and a sweet treat in summer. recommended!"
"Medium gold, almost orange with a pale tan, frothy and vigorous head. Candy, citrus and mild bread notes on the nose. Similar to a belgian pale ale, IMO. Sweet, spicy finish. Some ginger is noticable, along with some white peppercorns. Sugary throughout. Slightly yeasty finish. Good mouthfeel overall. Flavorful and coating, but not heavy. A nice brew. Not sure of the style they were going for; belgian pale ale meets a spice beer, i guess. Solid. Give it a try if you find it."
"Pours out a hazey orange amber with a large off-white head. Sweet is there very much, but in an unusual way. Almost Belgian in style, but with a twist. Spicey turns down the sweets with some citrus and pepper, and maybe ginger. Tastes very interesting. Mouthfeel is solid. Certainly worth checking out. A very good brew."
"Highly Recommended and well worth the coin. Took me a while to find it, but it was well worth the wait. Cheers SirJim!!"

"This is a beer hardly to define and to classify in a style. But it is surely interesting to prove. And very good to drink."
"Be aware of the yeast on the bottom as I did not know this was bottle conditioned."
"I have to say the bottle is what got my attention right away but the beer itself stole the show,pours a hazy orange/golden with a nice blooming head that leaves some decent lacing.Aroma is yeasty,spicey,citruisy just a mix of some really good stuff.Taste is almost a cross between a Belgain Pale and a German Hefe Weizen spicey and clovey with a yeasty sweetness to it with a great citruisy fruity taste that lingers and gives it a great aftertaste.Wow what a great brew and incredibly easy to drink for the alcohol content I wish I would have bought more,next trip to Premiere Gourmet in Buffalo and Iam grabbing three or four."
"Comments ¬ñ I suggest refrigerating this fifth-sized bottle in between pours."
"This has a thin mouthfeel and a clean finish. The carbonation levels are just right. The 6.8% ABV is not noticeable at all. Extremely drinkable because of its light refreshing texture and unique flavor. Not a cheap beer either - $12 in NJ and $15 in NY."
"It drinks mostly like a wheat beer, but with a ton more character and a spicy zing you won't have ever encountered before."
"(P.S., I didn't check the price until check-out time, and it was $11.99 for this 750ml bottle...awfully pricey, compared to others, but there really are no comparisons to this incredible brew, so this high tag may be deserved..."
"Get it!"
"Highly recommended. =)"
"Penso che questa birra abbia un sapore magnifico!"
"A fabulous beverage."
"Drinkability & Notes: Extra points for being some damn interesting, so flavourful and expressive that it annihilated my taste buds for the rest of the night. I‚Äôd like to do a side by side tasting with Midas Touch from Dogfish Head and see what comes of it."
"Nice presentation in a custom shaped and embossed 25.4 oz bottle with a nice label. It pours a slightly hazy golden-peach body topped by a full and frothy white head that holds quite well. The nose is perfumey, floral, mildly spicy (ginger) and lightly fruity (apricot) with a gentle touch of alcohol. Very clean. It's medium body combines with a fine carbonation to create a gently creamy mouthfeel. The flavor displays a strong floral character, gentle spice and light fruit over a softly sweet malt. It finishes dry with a light touch of malt and a delicate spiciness (ginger). A very clean and somewhat complex ale that's well done and quite enjoyable."
"Highly carbonated and almost champagne like.  Hazy gold with a persistent white head. Only slightly bitter.  Spiciness in the nose and in the mouth with some sweet and fruit flavors.  As it warms the sweetness comes out a bit more."
