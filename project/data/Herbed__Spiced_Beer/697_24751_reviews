"It was ehhh okay not what was expected"

"The taste of ginger is so strong that I  couldn't really enjoy it. The sweetness was overpowered by something in between floral and sour."

"O: Quite good, could benefit from a tad more of the citrus presence in the beer to balance it out. it is very interesting and different, definitely worth a try"

"Overall: You have to love ginger to truly appreciate this beer. I happen to be a big fan of ginger, which is why I enjoyed this beer so much. It gets better as it warmed. If you like ginger then give it a try. This is my first beer from Kiuchi Brewery. I’m looking forward to trying more of them. Enjoy…"

"O: caramel-y malt and powdered ginger are core to the taste here... it appears that it could be a goopy mess, however, the flavors seem to have decent balance and it thankfully ends up surprisingly dry... if you dig malt and ginger anything, this is a good one"

"24.3 oz bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 3/2012. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of ginger root, caramel, pear, apple, citrus zest, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, toffee, herbal, floral, grass, light clove, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of ginger, malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, ginger, toast, brown sugar, pear, apple, light citrus zest, brown bread, toffee, herbal, floral, grass, light clove, and herbal/toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, ginger, toast, brown sugar, pear, apple, brown bread, toffee, herbal, floral, light clove, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, ginger, and moderate yeast fruitiness; with a good malt/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice spiced amber ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of malt, ginger, and moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - Very satisfying beer. I like the scent and flavor profile much more than expected and will probably buy again."
"A passable beer, with a subtle ginger flavor, certainly less aggressive than Crabbie’s. More of a novelty beer."

"Poured a cloudy, fresh apple cider brown, with a one finger off-white head that receded to a nice ring of lacing. Very good looking. Scents of overripe fruit, earthy, musty and funky aromas, ginger, and some faint honey and malt sweetness. A very nice, earthy, fruity and sweet aroma with some unexpected funk. Far more complex than I was expecting, very nice. Flavor begins with sweet malt and caramel, moves into some white grape, raisin and dried fruit, apricot and apricot pit with some slight spiciness, some earthy and musty yeast flavors, coming out on the finish and aftertaste, slight sour funkiness and some slight hints of ginger in the background in the middle, finish and aftertaste. Very good, the ginger is not as big in the flavor as I expected, but it has a good, Belgian quality to the flavor, with some wild notes and the spiciness, malty sweetness, stone fruit and dried fruit flavors of tripels and quads. Quite unique and very good. The flavor hides the 8% ABV entirely. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with moderate carbonation that barely pricks the tongue, yet enough to give the beer a sipping quality. There is also a slight creaminess in the feel. Very nice to drink and swish, excellently crafted. Overall this is an amazing beer. I went in expecting a ginger heavy gimmick, but got a good, Belgian-like beer with a surprising complexity in aroma and flavor, with just a bit of ginger. Its a well crafted beer, showing the brewer's care for the final product. Highly recommended."
"This beer has a huge head when first poured and lacing remains throughout. Nice reddish caramel color. There is some dark sediment that comes out at the end of the pour. You can really smell the ginger and taste it as well. Nice spicy finish from the ginger without being harsh due to the sweetness of the beer. If you like ginger, this is the beer for you. I was not expecting such a true rendition of the ginger flavor but this one hits it on the spot. This is what a true ginger beer should be. The ABV of 8% also gives you a nice double whammy when combined with the ginger :)"

"O: i am a fan of the korean candy, 'yeot', so i couldnt get that thought out of my head as i continued to drink it. kiuchi brewery has once again won me over. will i drink it again? absolutely."
"Overall: OK, it's not the best thing in the world. But it's a decently interesting beer. It's definitely worth a try if you're into the more exotic brews; otherwise, probably not worth your time."
"O- Polarized beer. Very good parts and pretty bad parts."

"Pours a fairly murky honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small particles of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, and ginger aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and subdued ginger flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the ginger that is present in the aroma and flavor is fairly underwhelming in my opinion."
"O- Decent ginger beer. I think the beer aspect could be improved, but I enjoyed the ginger character. A lot more in the final product than other ginger beers I've had."
"Poured from bottle into tulip during hitachino tasting 2013. Nice brownish orange color with a finger of head. Ginger and sugary dried fruit aroma...actually quite nice. Taste is ginger and belgian dark quad like...dried fruit a bit...the ginger is much stronger in the aroma than the taste. Its actually a good brew"
"O. It is solid. It has a unique taste. Definitely worth a try, but can't have more than one or two. But I enjoyed."
""

"Overall: I admittedly haven't had any other ginger beer so this was interesting, I'd probably order this if I was getting sushi although I paid almost $5 for a 12oz bottle so I'd have to be in the mood for it."

"Jury out. It's not beer just not as we know it. Have to say would not buy again..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another interesting attempt at a ginger brew. Overall, not my favorite Hitachino offering and probably not something I would have again."
""
""
"An interesting and different ale, enjoyable and worth trying. Strikes me as something that might pair well with certain savory foods. On it's own, might be a little too weird to warrant a second try for most, but I am personally happy drinking it the first time at least."
""
"Given the name of the beer was Real Ginger Brew, I was expecting a more ginger-forward flavor. In truth it did have notifiable ginger flavor, but if you are expecting something akin to ""ginger beer"" (soda) then you will be disappointed. The color was a beautiful amber with a light, foamy head. Overall this was an enjoyable brew, but I would probably not pay the more than $5 per 12oz bottle that I did again."
"I really enjoyed this. I wish it weren't so expensive."
""
""
""
"O: I bought two of these and had one with dinner which was Japanese pepper steak and one by itself to test its worth. Personally, I thought It went nice with dinner and by itself. I'd come back to this if I can find it cheaper because the price was $4.59 for a 12 oz bottle, yikes."

"Dark murky amber body with a huge finger of yellowish head. The nose has as a mild ginger spice and a mild hop up front with a few roasted aromas as well. The first sip is rather sweet with big caramel And candied ginger with light citrus. The finish is quite dry and somewhat warming....now realize its 8%. Overall well balanced and tasty for sure"
""
""
""
"Rather sweet and spicy, but that was probably expected."
""
"Descent ginger brew. Would appreciate a little less sugary flavor and feel so the ginger character can show through."
"Appearance is brown and amber but most notable is the unfiltered, cloudy appearance. Head is present at pour but disappates quickly to just around the rim of the glass. The smell is unique - ginger, banana, clove, other fruits (maybe some candied dates). And the taste is the star - I've tried other ginger beers and find the ginger hard to pick out - not so in this beer. Well done. The ginger is present from start to finish - finally a ginger beer that meets expectations of having that flavor. Other spices and some malty breadiness to the flavor."
""
""
""
"Not as offensive in the ginger department as I had feared with all the flavours coming out well balanced and making a refreshing beer as a result."
""
"O - the ginger is not overdone as is easy to do with this style, pleasant and refreshing while being a fairly big brew, a nice slant on the style"
""
""
""
"More ginger in the flavours, but not dominant; there's also some faint bready malt. A bit of herbal astringency shows later. The base beer doesn't seem that great."
""
""
"O - Overall this was a relatively disappointing beer from Hitachino. Way too malty for my tastes with not enough bold ginger. Waste of money for the price."
"O: Very enjoyable but slightly too gingery and too strong in ABV to be sessionable. This beer paired very nicely with my sushi dinner and is definitely one that I would have another time."

"Overall, an unexpectedly delicious, and certainly unusually caressing ginger-infused brew. There's something utterly unique about it, but also utterly disarming about it. Although almost everything about it is unexpected, you're happy to let it do what it needs to do. An unexpectedly pleasant experience."

"O: Kiuchi is by far my favorite brewery. Even though I didn't think I'd care much for a ""ginger"" beer, once again the Hitachino Nest series pulls through and puts forth a winner. Absolutely great."
""
""
"Bottle. Copper color. Off-white head quickly fades. Great aroma: lots of fresh ginger with dandelion and wildflower, citrus zest, caramel in the malt. Medium to full, slick body with light bubbles on the tongue. Lots more ginger with grass and wildflowers in the flavor; great malt balance in behind with citrus zest. Dark fruit in the finish. Good Stuff."

"I love (non-alcoholic) ginger beers, so thought I should give this guy a chance. Pours a very hazy orange-yellow color with a tiny head. Aroma is ginger and sweet malts. The taste has that ginger kick for sure, but the sweet malts (caramel and sugar) really don't work with the ginger kick. There's some other spices in here that also kinda muddle the whole thing. It works, but could be a bit better. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and strangely drying on the finish - it's almost like my tongue is dry, but my throat is still wet. Overall, it was an alright beer, but as a huge ginger fan, I really wanted more."
""
""
"This may be the best ginger beer on the market."
""
""
"Beer is light in body, sweet and spicy, the ginger comes through nicely. The finish is a little dry but not too bad. A decent beer but not great. This brewery makes better beers and I've had them."
"Taste is very interesting, the hops and Ginger blend and increase the power of the bitterness. A nice malty backbone to balance the flavors. A very assertive beer with probably the best ""ginger"" i've ever tasted in a beer. Be prepared for some deep and strong flavor. If you like Sushi ginger you'll enjoy trying this."
"Pours a clear amber color with a off-white head with good staying power. A touch of lacing. The nose brings some light spicing. Nothing too over-the-top. Flavor has a bit of light malty sweetness along with plenty of cinnamon. Could be a pumpkin beer or a winter warmer. Hard to distinguish with strong cinnamon and not much in the way of malt backing. Light-medium body with quite a bit of fizz. Dry."
""

""
"O: very quaffable but not all that outstanding in expression of flavor. Not worth the price, these beers have become very expensive in the last two years."
"overall: unique infusion of ingredients, well complemented, very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But if you are looking for a ginger beer, you could do much worse. Because this offering has the ginger without being a bummer to drink. And that makes it okay in my book."
""
"Overall (4): The smell and look are great for a ginger beer and the taste is bang-on the goal. Couple this with some sushi and you have the perfect match. I'm struggling to place this as a ""refreshing"" or ""savory"" beer, likely because its a bit of both depending on when you're drinking it."
"Well, ginger, in many, if not most, of its forms pervades this offering, and despite its inconsistencies (which seem sort of endearing at times) this would kick ass on the usual Sapporo or Kirin lager options at each and every sushi joint on the planet. More drinkable and enjoyable than I would have initially imagined."
"for once the taste didn't mimic the smell, interesting stuff and I feel I should powering back Unagi, and Ebi with a California Roll on the side"
"Overall a good beer, but a full bomber bottle is tough to manage single-handedly."
"Overall a great beer and one of the best ginger brews that I have tasted. (Though if you want that sweet, candied ginger character this is NOT the beer for you! This tastes like the ginger you get at sushi restaurants. YUM!)"
"This beer poured out as a nice looking copper gold color with a foamy white head on top. The smell of the beer was pretty good, it had some subtle malts with a touch of ginger in there. The taste of the beer had a slightly sweet herbal spice flavor to it. The mouthfeel was pretty good, lighter bodied with a decent carbonation to it. Overall this beer is pretty good, I enjoyed it but I don't know if I'd go out of my way to have it again."
"My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it--not what we were expecting from a ginger beer, surprised us and knocked it out of the park. Will be buying again."
"a nice hazy brown body with a thin head that has ok retention and minimum lacing. nose is spicy ginger cinnamon and bread malts. taste is big spicy ginger crackers and a nice hop bite with a dry finish. carbonation is moderate to low. overall this is a fine beer. its interesting and definitely worth the try as a one off."
"If I can get another bottle, I'll re-review."
"The one drawback is that it's a tad expensive at >10 a bomber."
"Nothing terrible though, and if they really just wanted to make a very ginger tasting beer I'd say their execution was flawless. If you're in the mood for ginger and a beer and want to knock out two birds with one stone this is your beer."
"Mmm, better than I anticipated. Poured with a large, foamy, thick, cream colored head that slowly settled and a little lace. Color is a brownish amber with lots of flecks of stuff and no bubble trails. Aroma is malt and spice. Flavor is like nose with a little sweetness and ginger showing up more. The carbonic tang perfectly offsets the sweetness and ginger. Body and carb are decent. Finish is like flavor and about medium in length. I could see having several of these."
"O: Herbed or spiced beers are frequently considered novelty beers. It is true that this beer has a very unique flavor (and color), but it is not brewed for kicks and giggles. The sweetness and spice of the ginger work together to create a beer that has balance. The beer can feel a little heavy (slight syrup); I wish it has higher carbonation."
"O: Tastes a lot like a heavier, sweeter ginger ale. Not bad really. I was expecting a lighter, crisper beer, but this did just fine."
"Worth trying and I'll get it again if I can find it."
"D- I could absolutely drink this beer all night, if you enjoy a hoppy beer this would be enjoyable because ginger adds spicy hop-esque kick"
"Those are my initial opinions at first couple tastes. But, after attempting the whole bottle, the ginger was a bit too much and overpowering. Hard to finish. Not something to drink more of a glass of."
"Pours a murky dark burnt amber color, soapy white head, gone quickly. First whiff prongs some spicy ginger notes, but quickly covered up by a stong malt sweetness - quite corn syrupy. Taste comes through with stong notes of spicy ginger, the sweetness cuts through at the end and takes over - a touch less ginger and more then a touch less sweetness would improve this beer. Medium bodied, slightly chewy, lingering spicyness. I liked this, but 10oz should be enough. A beer with the strongest ginger profile i have had, but the 7% ABV gives hint to the amount of malts used in this, all while residual sweetness takes over the palate."
"O - Nothing special here...ginger is lacking the punch I was looking for and the base beer really is pretty non-descript for me. A bit malty, not much for hops, ginger is a let down...just ok overall. Pretty expensive 12oz experience at $6+...don't think I will be revisiting. Having my doubts about the other bottle of Hitachino Nest beer I bought..."
"O = I liked this because of the creamy malt factor. Kudos to Kiuchi Brewery for always trying to do something interesting. But the sweet notes seemed slightly unnatural. But I think I can get past that. This would pair well with wagu beef or bulgoki."
"d- i was expecting a little more. worth a try but once."
"For a beer labeled ""Real Ginger"" I'd expect more of a spicy presence. Hard to pick it out although it did assert itself more as the beer warmed."
"Was expecting much much more from this one. The aroma was of sugars and syrup. Just a bit too sweet for me as far as a beer goes. Great color and nice head, which settled down so a nice thin ring around the surface. I can't think of anything to pair with it, so it'll probably be a drain pour. Will think about trying this one again if I know it's a fresher batch (which may not be for a while), the shop I purchased this from often has outdated brews on the shelves."
"I like the attempt here, but the flavor is kind of all over as mentioned before. Unique for sure, but I won't need to have this one again personally."
"This beer pours ruby red with some hanging sediment, a thin head that dies down to nothing, and no lace. On the nose the ginger hits hardest and first, but underneath that are some subtle fruit aromas. In the mouth the ginger is less assertive that I thought, a good thing, and there are some fruit notes. I think one reviewer mentioned watermelon, and that doesn't sound outrageous to me. I had a hard time picking out the individual flavors underneath the ginger, which kind of covered everything for me. The body is pretty light but the ginger sticks around on the front of the tongue for some time. I guess I just don't like ginger, or at least in beers. For someone who does, this may be a better brew."
"First sip is a bit more citrus-like than I expected it would be. In terms of mouthfeel, I would agree that it's pretty rewarding. Overall flavor and consistency mirror that of some beers made with wild yeasts. And as those are some of my favorite, I would contest that this might end up on the top of your list."
"I'm not into this one; glad I only bought the one bottle out of curiosity. Of all the Hitachino Nest offerings the LCBO could have brought in, why did they choose this one?"
"D: I liked the balance in the herbal character which was not overwhelming, drank decent, and was a decent herbal brew."
"Drinkability. Not a great drinker. A little too herby."
"Mouthfeel with smooth, light and crisp, with light carbonation and a refreshing sensation overall. Low drinkability; this was a nice experiment, but not a beer I'd seek out again."
"Disappointed with this. Everything seems out of balance."
"Verdict: Quite nice, unique and refreshing. Too expensive, but worth trying if you see it."
"Japanese beer provides me with happy memories of vacations past, and its easy for me to look at them with rose-tinted glasses, but I believe this is the real deal. An ode to one of the world's greatest tuberous roots."
"D: The beer clears your palate and is quite refreshing."
"Hazy reddish brown color. Nice cream colored head. Head holding nicely. Has an almost Belgiany aroma. That is most likely the spice replicating yeast esters. I like how this is still a delicious malty flavored beer with inclusion of ginger. The base of the beer would be delicious without the ginger addition (which works quite well ion the brew.) Just a hint of ginger at the end of the sip with the bitterness. I really like this beer! best ginger beer I have ever had. Biterness and ABV work well together. Tastes fresh for Japanese beer. I am quite happy with the purchase."
"A very interesting beer, I would not have expected it to be as dark and malt heavy as it was. It certainly works well the ginger standing up well to the richness of the malt, quite enjoyable."
"is added to the aroma as beer warms. Average carbonation. Light in finish, very drinkable. Color clears as it warms. Spiciness also nellies out with warmth. Breadiness and alcohol increase slightly with warmth. Still very good."
"All in all, it's worth trying, but I'm not sure I'd buy another bottle."
"As a side note, something about that bizzare orange cartoon owl on the bottle creeps me out for some reason. It's like his unrelenting steady gaze, slowly bores into my soul. It wouldn't stop me from buying it again, but for some reason it seems...unsettling."
"Overall this is decent ginger brew and hopefully only a sneak peak into more craft beers from Japan. Would be best paired with food, but on it's own it's still a treat. Could have a few in a session."
"somewhat creamy, medium-bodied mouthfeel. obviously i'm not going to find this one very drinkable. i'd be open to sampling other offerings from the brewery, but this particular beer just isn't for me."
"Stronger than the other ginger beer I have had. While the other one I found somewhat sessionable, this one (while enjoyable) feels more like it needs a food accompaniment."
"Certainly smells a bit gingery. Pours a chill hazed amber with an average sized, but impeccably creamy head. Nose has ginger of course, and hints of honey. A bit of a spicy flavour, and very dry. Gingery bitterness (does that make sense?) and bit of a husky grain round out the flavours. Not a lot of acidity and did I mention very dry? Moderate body but sharp carbonation and ok drinkability. Maybe a bit of novelty here, but not much else."
"And yet it's still a beer. Rice and thick, bitter barley dominate the back end, along with zippy yeast and pleasant alcohol burn. This is maybe a bit too thick, seeing as the opening end is more like a nice old timey cough drop."
"Nice to see a ginger beer that is big enough to work with the ginger flavour and make it food friendly. Darkish ale with lots of ginger but a goodly amount of hops and malt to back it up. I probably wouldn't want to drink more than one but as Ginger beers go this is pretty good"
"D: I can see why not everyone would like this but to me it is a gem. I find its challenges, if well met, are worthwhile. Like a young art student she will break your heart and keep you coming back for more. You may not marry her but you will sleep with her again given the right circumstances."
"Certainly a specialty beer to pair with the right dish / mood, but a good drink for the right person looking for something different."
"Overall an interesting brew. Definitely a firm solid brew. Best suited for working at slowly while sitting in your favorite comfy chair. I'd do this one again."
"D - Tasty but I've had better... I wouldn't consider myself a connoiseur of the style, however, I would've liked something with a little more ginger."
"This was very well done, and is easily the best ginger beer I have ever had. I will be very excited to try it with Asian dishes made with ginger, but also burgers, steak, roast beef, and sharp cheeses will work fabulously with this fascinating and enjoyable beer."
"D - I love ginger. I love cooking with it. I love eating it. I love drinking it. Just really not loving drinking this one. Halfway through the drink down the drain it went."
"Despite the weird disconnect between the nose, tongue, and mouth this beer was remarkably average. Not offensive, but nothing worth wasting one's time drinking IMO. Sorry for the short review, but I'd rather not waste my time or creative energy BS'ing about this. Would not drink again unless other available brews are few and far between."
"Notes: Meh. Ginger beer. Wish it was carbonated..."
"The mouthfeel is good. Full and smooth with tiny carbonation. Drinkability is decent. The beer goes down well and another would be enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is a light/medium body that finishes clean. The tartness makes this a refreshing summer beer, even at 7% ABV."
"Hitachino Nest Real Ginger Brew is a hazy amber in colour, topped by an insubstantial off-white head that doesn't lace the glass. It has an intense ginger aroma over a biscuity malt background, effectively making it smell like ginger snap cookies. The ginger is tastes less intense than it smells, but manages to give the beer a mildly spicy flavour that is complemented by some sweet caramel and honey. Finishes with a very mild bitterness. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated; smooth but not heavy. As far as beer brewed with ginger goes, this isn't as complex as Albino Python from Schmaltz Brewing. Nice beer with a good balance between malt and ginger flavours. A hell of a lot better than I remember."
"Not something I would be naturally drawn to but I am struck by how well integrated the ginger is and how surprisingly drinkable it is for a malt-heavy ginger beer."
"D-The higher abv doesn't hit you over the head. I found this to be very drinkable. I might get tired of the ginger after about 4 or 5 though. I think this beer might be better served colder. Mine sat in the freezer for about 10 min so it was only slightly chilled."
"I simply feel that ginger lends itself more to lighter beers. Give me a ginger infused Hefe or nice refreshing Pale. It's an interesting beer, but is out of place in the LCBO summer release in Ontario."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of deep caramel malt and toffee with some very subtle ginger notes. Taste is also dominated by caramel malt with sweet toffee notes while ginger is hidden quite well in this whole mix. Body is full with limited filtration and some average carbonation. Not bad overall but I was expecting a beer more focus toward ginger then strong caramel malt."
"Hitachino Nest's Real Ginger Brew is a very likable and appreciably unique offering but now, having tried an alcoholic Asian ginger beer, I can say for certain that I prefer the Caribbean-style non-alcohol version and that when it comes to incorporating ginger into the gastronomic realm, I prefer it best in cookie form or with seafood or meat."
"A world class specialty beer. Well carried off, substantial and deeply flavorful."
"I like it for what it is, even if I don't love how the ginger builds and dominates with every sip. It's definitely not one I could drink more than one of at a time."
"Well done Kiuchi - I will seek more of your beers."
"Pours a murky copper colour with small head and minimal lacing. Tons of ginger up front in the smell and I'm not getting too much else. Flavour has lots of the ginger, with a small amount of bitterness from the hops. It really is one dimensionally ginger. If you are in love with ginger, I'm sure you'll love this. While I like ginger, it is a bit much. I just wish I it was a bit more subtle."
"Honestly maybe the worst-looking brew I've ever had. Sure, some beers have sediment but this just looks a bit nasty with the color and cloudiness. The flavor doesn't particularly strike me as ginger for some reason - more herbal. For the very curious only - I won't be getting this one again."
"value: $4.89 for 11.2 oz i kinda expensive. also, my expectations for hitachino nest were extremely high because of their absolutely phenomenal white ale. i have no constructive criticism on how to make this beer better, but i would like to see something else happen here."
"well...doesn't really taste like ginger. but something is going on that i don't recognize. that must be ginger. mmm...ginger"
"D: would be much higher if the ginger weren't so dominant."
"The beer gushes out the top when opened and then pours a murky orange color with a white head. The aroma is tart lemon with some nice malt and brett character. The flavor is very tart with some brett funk as well as some lemons and oranges. Tart, funky finish. High carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"Not the simplistic beer I thought it could be, this will demand a bit of your time and attention. Overall, I really like this. Why am I always surprised that I like a Hitachino Nest beer? I should know better by now."
"This brew pours a deep copper hue with decent carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and a ring of lacing,the aroma is suprisngly not full on ginger which i was expecting with a ginger beer its more sweetish like candied ginger and boiled candy,it has a nice full mouthfeel with tastes of sweet boiled candy,fruity hops and a little ginger kick but by no means overpowering in fact the ginger in my mind plays a nice co-host in this brew to accomodate the other flavours while still displaying the ginger qualities even though its a Real Ginger beer almost like a beautiful curry which has ginger in it but does not overpower the other flavours and still shows its qualities,overall a tasty brew and even if your not a fan of ginger dont let the label scare you as its more a brew with ginger in it than a Ginger beer."
"Notes: Nice surprise from the Hitachino beer, typically very nice brews but this one was something else. Sure one needs to like ginger to enjoy this one but it is not overwhelming, and in fact works well as a rich malty complex brew with a long finish."
"I think this is quite drinkable, but I would want to pair it with food rather than drink by itself. Would pair well with sushi, maybe some noodle dishes."
"Overall: It's a solid brew and unusual. Really liked the added ginger which is thinking outside of the box and when your thinking outside the box, I'm all for it! Maybe not for everyone, as I can see that ginger and sour wouldn't go over well in some crowds, but if your looking out of the ordinary, give it a shot."
"D – This is a ridiculously good beer. I think if it were brewed by monks in Belgium it would probably be exalted."
"Overall a subtle spiced ale. Nice."
"This is an amazing beer. I was surprised from the start, as a big foamy head greeted me before I could even start pouring. Once poured, the head stays bubbly and lacy. The body of the beer is a rusty orange color, and you can see big chunks of sediment resting on the bottom. The smell is unsurprisingly of ginger, with some citrusy notes that actually remind me of a weizen or Belgian blonde. The taste is where things really get interesting. The ginger is predominant, but acidic, sweet, fruity malts and hops follow after. Again, I'm amazed how much this tastes like other styles: lambics, bdsas, weizens, and wittes are all represented. The mouthfeel is smooth and effortless, which is good because there's a lot of flavor to process. If you had handed me a glass of this stuff without telling me where it came from, I would have immediately guessed that it was Belgian or a north-eastern American micro. I'm absolutely floored that it came from Japan (aka Beer Hell), and I can't wait to go back and try another brew from Hitachino."
"This is my second beer from this producer and I haven't been disappointed yet - only surprised in both cases."
"I haven't had very many ginger brews, but this is probably the best of the ones I have had. I have had Left Hand Juju Ginger, and Dogfish Head Pangaea, both of which were rather disappointing. This has a more full and complex flavor to it. Definetly worth checking out."
"D: An interesting and weird brew. The ginger may be over the top for me, but it doesn't dominate the brew entirely. Unique. It's a beer that's hard to quantify. Definitely not for everybody."
"Avoid. It tries but certainly fails."
"Hitachino Nest Ginger Brew is a translucent (but not at all transparent) orangish red ale. It's very sparkling with lots of particles. It has a thick multi-colored head, marbled from white to rusty brown. It's dense, with outstanding retention and lacing. There is a lot of dirty ginger in the aroma with a touch of sweetness. It has a very fluffy medium body that's very smooth with a sharp, slightly gritty finish. There's not really any sweetness. It's tangy. The ginger is pretty prominent, but not dominant. It's tangy, leathery, Belgian-like, almost salty. It's very unique!"
"This bottle was bought maybe six months ago. There was a ginger ginsing aroma whafting from the mushroom cloud head on a dark yellow body. But the taste was a skunky medicine disaster,it had an stringent finish. medium mouthfeel,and really not too drinkable."
"Overall decent, but not flavorful enough."
"a rather herbal amber ale that comes out sweet. nose of ginger... not ginger powder. a sweetness that is similar to that of pickled ginger. not palate is milder ginger astringent than expected. has a sweet caramel with a mild warm from the ginger and somewhat the alcohol also. sort of hard to tell. ginger is definitely not as punchy as expected."
"Hitachino is interesting and refreshingly unique, but hardly easy to consume. Definitely have this with subtle-flavored foods."
"Notes: Overall this beer is very interesting with many layers of complexity. This is not a beer you can drink a lot of but I did enjoy it and would highly recommend this beer to someone who is looking for something different maybe odd and defiantly special."
"Normally don't like ginger flavor beers, but in this case, the ginger flavor is nicely integrated into the rest of the flavor profile. Nice beer."
"D: Great. Both refreshing and flavorful. A multi purpose beer. Would be great with sushi or pork dishes."
"The beer pours a cloudy amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a spicy, fresh ginger aroma that blends well with the pale and crystal malt scent. The taste is average. It has a thick, malty flavor that goes down slow and finishes sweet with a spicy, ginger character. There is a mild tartness in there as well. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is decent ginger brew. It's quite prevelant in the aroma and the taste. A good example of the style. I'm just not sure that I like the style that much."
"Eric"
"taste is tangy, lots of ginger, tangerine, tart on the tongue, and some hops, ends a little bitter and tart."
"The ginger and spice are crisp and refreshing. But, it is hard to ignore the bitterness that seems a little unablanced, and at times, overpowering."
"D - I don't know if this is really something to be consumed all that often, but it's worth a shot. It's probably food friendly."
"i can't get over the ""syrup"" i get in the nose and on the tongue."
"This brew has a bit too much ginger flavor in my opinion (and I really like ginger). It's also a bit too sweet for my taste. I just wish it was slightly more complex with other flavors."
"D: This is an interesting brew, but not one I'd come back to time and again. Still, like most Hitachino products, it's a well made beer."
"I want to give this beer a better grade for the effort, but the fact of the matter is that I had trouble finishing it. It's just too damn sweet. I'm glad for having tried it, but wouldn't buy it again."
"MF&D the feel is a bit thin, though I agree with the brewer I wouldnt want to be drinking a ginger slurpee, I think a bit more carbonation or viscosity would have done well to make the beer pack a bigger concentrated ginger punch. the drink ability, however, is great as it is. For if it were to get a heavier body then it wouldnt be quite as light and refreshing. thus we have a paradox."
"D: refreshing and tasty beverage all around, ABV well hidden. Almost like a soda."
"NOTE: five minutes after trying, the ginger is starting to come through with a slight burn, much like after having ginger with sushi."
"Overall, I would definitely recommend this beer. It would be great for an Asian night or any night you are feeling adventurous. If you see it, grab it."
"first sip was very gingery. then all i could taste was sweet vermouth. that flavor got stronger the more the beer warmed. all i could think was that i was drinking a huge glass of sweet vermouth. herbs and spices and faint sweetness with a puckering bitterness in the finish. not my thing, exactly. i guess if you like sweet vermouth - i mean REALLY like sweet vermouth - , you'll dig this."
"D- I could have a couple but I don't think all night long and certainly not at $5.00 a bottle. but for someone who loves ginger this was a really nice brew."
"Poured a nice cloudy golden brown with a thin off white head. As for the smell, yep, it's made with ginger. It's noticeable in the taste as well. A little too noticeable for me. It's intense. Then I realize the beer is cloudy with pieces of ginger. Lots of em. I tried hard but just couldn't finish this one and had to send it seaward. This one is for the true ginger lover, not necessarily the true beer lover."
"D: Very drinkable indeed. Hard to compare with other beers of its type but I rather enjoyed it. I could certainly have more, but couldn't see myself enjoying this all night."
"Never was expecting a trip tp Mexico, complete margaritas spiked with excess salt. The head was so soft, floating like soap atop the ocean. Hit tangy at first, definite salt, rasberry tart ride. An earthy base supporting gueze. Reminds of the exotic, live culture potential with a hint of lime spritzer."
"I've had another beer from them and I don't doubt that they are a decent brewery, but WOW that was toooo much!"
"I really tried to be open-minded with this one. Oh well, at least now I know this is not my kind of beer."
"A fine little ginger beer from Hitachino Nest. Quite drinkable and worth a try when you have the chance."
"D: i enjoyed the beer itself, would probably get it again."
"Hitachino Ginger Brew pours an orange-amber color with a medium-dense head. The head quickly dissipated, with no lacing (although I suspect there may have been some soap on the inside of the glass). Initial note of ginger predominates and lasts throughout the drinking. Tastes initially of ginger, with a malt undertone, and finishes with a nice ginger-malt combination. Mouthfeel is nice, light to medium. Overall a refreshing summer beer, with a very good drinkability. My only qualm was a weird aftertaste at the bottom of the glass, but I suspect that there was some soap residue (which also may have caused the head to disappear so fast)."
"D - A rich and spicy beer, a bit thick for my taste, but fairly drinkable. The ginger character is weaker than I expected, but the malt is quite nice and what ginger is present plays off of the malt in a nice way."
"Hitachino Nest Real Ginger Brew pours a georgious dark orangish amber, with a nice stiff medium lasting head. The smell is moderate and pleasantly spiced with ginger. Ginger is also the backbone of the taste coming out very nicely with a slight tartness at the end. Mouthfeel is great. It sports a smooth, moderately dense feel with a medium to low amount of carbonation. For a ginger beer this is right on. It really has everything that I could possibly want from a specialty brew of this kind. Overall this is really pleasant and enjoyable, a good benchmark for what a ginger brew should try to be."
"I remember thinking these beers were pretty expensive. And, on my first trip to bottleworks since joining BA, the guy working at the time asked me if Hitachino nest beers were also expensive in Japan. I said yes, they were. But actually, they are really not bad compared to some other J-craft-beers! Definitely recommended."
"Pours a hazy brown with one finger of light tan head. Decent retention and no real lace. Aroma is nice. Sweet yet spicey ginger, a little hoppiness and a sweet maltiness. Taste is nice. A malty backbone with a sweet ginger touch. Kind of weaker than I was hoping. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is moderate. Low alcohol and decent flavors make the beer drinkable but in small doses."
"Overall not bad. I am really not a fan of the ginger beers, but even I have to admit that this one was not bad at all. I think I might even try it again one day, and would sure to take a test of it on tap if given the chance. If you see it and its reasonable, its not a bad bet."
"Drinkability: Better than expected. Seriously! Plenty of ginger without being off-putting."
"Pours a very nice brown orange reddish color with a small thin head, almost no lacing. Below average carbonation with a fairly strong smell of flowery hops followed by spice. Tastes or ginger and light malts with hops as a backbone. Light body. Flavor is medium with the ginger not over powering."
"Pours dark amber with a lasting offwhite head atop. Pretty nice looking beer. Nose is malty, with some spicy ginger notes and hoplike aromas wafting up. Somewhat full bodied, and malty with tartness and some light ginger spiciness, with a semi-rich body and a light ginger flavor in the finish as well. Not bad and you actually get some of the advertised ginger."
"Pours out a slightly hazed copper body with some slow moving bubbles and a thinnish head that manages to maintain itself. Smells of some soft bready and caramel malts with a fresh ginger crispness that is rather strong yet melds well with everything. Flavor starts off with a touch of sweetness and maltiness that I would best describe as a mix between breadiness and crackeriness. The bright ginger introduces itself in the middle. The finish is very dry with a touch of bitterness and a lovely lingering ginger spiciness. Mouthfeel is one of the creamiest I've come across in a long while. Moderate in weight. Really drinkable. I could drink this all night. This went amazingly well with a cracked black pepper encrusted goat cheese."
"Drinkablity: This would be a great beer to pair with food. Very interesting and unique."
"Taste is of ginger. Nice flavor sort of expands on the palate with sweet hints of brown sugar. Not overwhelming. Also faint hops. A really nice beer. I like the occasional ginger brew, and this one is well worth looking for."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Another from Uwajimaya in Seattle and my first Japanese beer. Appearance is a very dark amber with a dissapating head that leaves a thin film. Ginger dominates the aroma with a sweetness along with other herbs and spice. I'm going to have to say the same for the taste, with a slight burned sugar aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a good solid viscous medium with good carbonation for this type of beer. An interesting beer with some charactoristics I did enjoy."
"VERY cool beer."
"i'm a fan of hazy, murky, muddy looking beers. this one was all that. nice and muddy. like swamp water. reddish brown with dark pumpkin colored feet. almost seemed to glow. maybe it was like magic radioactive voodoo swamp water. big, thick, light tan head that held really well. only reason i don't give it a 5 is because there was barely any lace left behind. nose was great, but not as powerful as i was hoping for. sweet caramel malt was the first thing i noticed. sweet, spicy caramel malt as a matter of fact. ginger was the highlight, but the hops and yeast also added another faint dimension. to me, it tasted wonderful. ginger came out more and more as it warmed. taste was almost like liquid candied ginger for adults. well balanced with a long lasting gingery finish in the bottom of my throat. a pleasant warming caused by the ginger was a cool change of pace from a hop or alcohol type burn. the sweet malt really was the perfect vehicle to ride that ginger down as well. soft, silky and medium full bodied. easy and fun to drink and enjoy the complexities, but not something i'd want all day everyday. best ginger ale (w/alcohol) i've ever had."
"This beer pours a ruby re color. The head is massive, thick, and creamy. It recedes slowly into nice thick lacing. The aroma is of ginger, cream, and nutmeg. The taste is like the aroma. It had tones of ginger, but no real complexity. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but if I am in the mood for a spiced beer I would much rather have an Anchor OSA."
"Thankfully the bartender did me right by pouring it into a pint glass. The aroma was nutty with an obvious ginger kick. The taste was more sutle until the finish which was all ginger. It was interesting to drink one, but I think all that ginger wouldn't be great for more than that."
"Wow, they weren't lying about the ginger! This tastes almost more like ginger beer, than a beer brewed with ginger. Molasses/brown sugar flavors prevail throughout as well, though the ginger is in complete control of the palate.	This is not an everyday drinker here. It's fun to try once, but I won't be revisiting this ever again."
"As with all the other Hitachino beers I have sampled, this was an utter disappointment."
"Picked up several Hitachino Nest beers on a recent trip to Nashville. Pours the color of a thick and dark honey. Some slight lacing, but an aggressive pour yields no head. Not picking up much in smell either, but this is definately malt over hops. The ginger seems to stand out in the taste more when this beer is on the cooler side. It lingers on the tongue and in the aftertaste, but there is no burn from the ginger. Quite mild. I enjoyed this less as the beer warmed. It just seemed to get maltier and maltier. Mouthfeel and drinkability are fine. Alcohol is well hidden. All in all, a nice beer, but I'd have prefered a more dominant ginger presence."
"This beer pours a pretty brown color that almost turns to amber when held up in the light. There is virtually no head when poured. The smell is mostly malty, but there is a special addition of ginger that forces its way through and is very inviting. The taste is great. It tastes a lot like normal Ginger Beers on the market (Reed's is the most popular), but the slight addition of malt tones down the ginger and couples to form a really interesting mixture. There is very little carbonation, so the mouthfeel reminds me of a generic malt beverage. The lingering taste is thick, and sits on the back of the tongue with a pungent ginger kick that begs for anther sip. A very special beer."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a dull rust color with a thinner white head,the ginger is light in the nose intermingling with some floral hop and toasted grain.Same as the aromas really on the palate the ginger comes thru late and gives a little edge at about mid swallow up front is a mix of floral citric hop and toasty lightly sweet malt.Hmm not half bad but the ginger could be a bit more pronounced before the lingering finish,glad I tried but not sure I would go back."
"D-I have had other Hitachino prodcuts and defnitely was underwhelmed. They seem to be a bit overrated to me. However with this one, they really knocked it out of the park. While this maybe pricey, it will be an occasional treat in my fridge. i would love to have this on cask if it were available. Highly recommended to anyone who likes ginger."
"I really like this but it's a subjective thing with a lot of spice ales. I can see how people would think this is spicy and nasty but I really enjoy this beer."
"One i enjoyed and glad i tried, but not one i would search for."
"D - Good. It isn't a great beer, but it is a nice delivery of ginger in a beer. Ginger is the sort of spice that has a fine line between unnoticable and overkill - this does pretty well at walking that line."
"Over all, an interesting beer. It's spicy enough for me to first think it's a winter warmer. but it's gentle and subtle enough to be refreshing on a hot night. I find Hitachino to be VERY hit or miss, but this one is pretty tasty. I'd buy it again. I'm glad that I tried it again ad reviewed it, but don't bother scouring the globe for it."
"Appearance was a caramel color, like a dark IPA. Aroma is lightly sweet and ginger-y, with some other unidentifiable other spice character (anise?). Flavor was very strong ginger, and this made the mouthfeel quite crisp and pretty good. But the ginger notes also made this beer not all that drinkable/sessionable."
"D- This beer has to much ginger and not enough supporting flavors. I like ginger but I just couldn't find the beer in this glass."
"Drinkability: Very expensive for a bottle, around $4. But if you're curious, be curious. I think they were when they brewed it. And honestly, for the singular experience this crazy and enigmatic ginger brew brings, I say at least grab a bottle and see what you think."
"Pours into a pilsener glass at Muramoto in Madison, WI a blushing chestnut with a creamy khaki head. The ginger is not overdone, (what a pleasant surprise), it just lingers throughout while still allowing for wonderful fruit notes, mainly strawberries, to shine. Flavor matches with a healthy amount of caramel. Body is light and palatable. Complimented our deserts of strawberry eggrolls, ginger sorbet, and black sesame cream Brule perfectly."
"I couldn't finish this one... it really goes against me."
"Drinkability - this is a unique beer and could grow on me. An expensive session beer though at $3.79 per 12-ounces."
"Hitachino Nest Real Ginger Ale (along with Celebration Ale and White Ale) is the cream of the Kiuchi crop. One probably has to like ginger to like it, so it won't appeal to everyone. It sure as hell appeals to me though. I just wish I could remember where I bought the bottle since I'd love to lay my hands on a few more."
"It's an interesting, unique brew. Ginger dominates, but does not overpower other flavors. As tasty as it is, one is enough. As the drink progresses, more alcoholic sharpness becomes noticeable. A good one to try because it's something different, but not anything to have with any regularity. It has a rawness about it. Might be good to have with a spicy Asian cuisine that has ginger as a main ingredient. On its own - a bit much."
"Probably won't appeal too much to ginger freaks but I find this to be a very good application of ginger in a beer. Japan stand up and be proud. Kono biru wa totemo sugoi desu!"
"One of my new favorites. Head pours thick and with a slightly reddish tint. No single taste or aroma is overwhelming, but the ginger shines through and wakes up the whole palate. A bunch of yeast was present in the bottle, leaving a haze in my second glass. Pour carefully."
"Pours coppery orange with a fat offwhite head that faded very fast. The has lots of ginger, some sweet malts, and a very tiny bit of hops. The taste has some nice citrusy ginger (almost like orange peel), some malt and ale yeast flavors, and a tiny twang of hops. The mouthfeel is slightly rich, but the carbonation and ginger flavors make me perceive it as lighter and more refreshing. Actually, I like this beer a whole lot. This is probably my favorite Japanese beer and my favorite herbal brew as well."
"The tan head on the copper colored beer fell quickly, but a citrusy nose with a lot of spice promised a lot. And, a lot is what it is. First, a lot of ginger, with an overwhelming initial taste followed by a bitter, bitter finish. It improves after a few sips, and the taste buds acclimate (surrender???) to the ginger. Also, a lot of alcohol (7%) taste comes through as well, blended with a soda like high carbonation bite as well. It did clear my sinuses for a bit. With that said, it has some balance and if you like ginger (which I suspect is my main problem with this beer), I can see where there are some really ravenous ginger fans who are terribly loyal to this brew from Japan. Enjoy with caution."
"Drinkability: Certainly not Kiuchi's finest effort, but worth a try nonetheless. I want the ginger flavor to be kicked up a little more, because as it is this is just kind of a blasé pale ale."
"Nice on the nose, not quite as nice on the palate."
"Good mouthfeel...not as carbonated as Granville Island's Ginger Beer, and thus not as ""soda-ish."" Great summer drink, one that excels served ice cold."
"Overall: I was worried that the ginger in this beer would be overpowering (like a Ginger Altoid), but they did a really good job of allowing the ginger to be the focus of the beer without letting it overpower the other flavors."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The beer is explosively carbonated. The ginger taste is dominate and lingering as a ginger sting. This is a very interesting beer. The beer is very refreshing and easy to consume."
"Pours a hazy, bright bronze in color, with a dense tan head of moderate duration and enough lace to pique my interest  this looks sturdy! Nose offers a hint of pineapple and spice, with the ginger being surprisingly subtle (think of liquid Pineapple Upside-down Cake without the cherries!) Im also catching a bready, ale-yeast component (strong/old ale), ginger snaps, and just a touch of bittering hops. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, the ginger and firm alcohol work in a point-counterpoint manner, delivering a spicy kick within a medium-full bodied strong ale. Hop bitterness is present but more as a compliment to the sharp, tangy ginger, and there is a touch of resin-y pine in the aromatics. The malt profile is obscured by the spice and warming alcohol, but adds just enough sweetness to this dry, spicy, strong-yet-very drinkable brew. A very good tipple!"
"A slightly cloudy dark amber beer. Has a small fizzy head that evaporates quickly. There is a definte belgian like floral and herbal character to the aroma ( similar to beers that I have had from Offshore Ales and The Tap when Mr Paquette was there.) That whole floral and herbal texture carrys over into the taste. With hints of malty sweetness in the middle and a dry floral hop finish Quite a suprising brew."
"Quite plesant in its herbal, spicy, and intriguing character. Expeimental brews rarely contain the finess and roundness as this one. Aromas are floral and flowery with ginger, honey, suckle, and flowers. Basically a potpouri to the nose. Tastes less bitter and bite-ey than expected. Starts with, what would be, a fine pale ale. Throw in a ton of ginger, but without the heartburn qualities that are associated with bold spices. Melded to the tone that is expected from corriander. Lightly peppery and lemony to top it off. Finishes with a prickly and numbing carbonation and a dry powdery texture. Leaves a light ginger, alcohol, and honey flavor to reflect upon."
"Yum, I like. If you hate ginger, you won't. But then, who can resist the smiling ginger root mascot on the label?"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, rather dry with well placed carbonation. Goes down smooth, but the finish gets to be a bit much after each sip. Not a brew I'd drink regularly, however it's quite intriguing and definetly brings the ginger flavor. Worth trying if you enjoy Kiuchi's brews or if you like ginger."
"Pours a murky copper with a few fine trails of carbonation rising through the middle. A small oatmeal colored head forms, but doesn't hold out very long. Smells like a malty pale ale, but with a dash of ginger. Actually it reminds me of spiced pumpkin smell for some reason. Solid, caramel maltyness holds up against the modest ginger. The finish is only slightly bitter, and there's a mild bite to the ginger. The hops are hard to pick out, but I think there's some piney hops in the mix. Almost chewy body does well to carry the sweet flavors and keep the ginger in check. Wow, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm impressed. Not as hot as I thought it would be, but that is good. Well balanced, flavorful, and I'm a ginger fan so I could drink a few of these."
"I will buy it again, but only occasionally due to the cost of $3.50 for a 11.2 oz bottle."
"Tried this rarity on tap at the Lazy Boy in White Plains NY. I sampled it before I went for a pint, it tasted pretty good, sort of ""interesting"" after a few sips I knew I had made a mistake. This is heavy very flavorful brew, usually not a bad thing, but here were talking lots of ginger, lots of mint, clove, spruce, pine etc. This stuf was just plain nasty IMHO. To much personality, here equals tough to drink. Over the top in the ""herbed/spiced"" department for my palate."
"A heavy pour and got a one-fingered head that vanished leaving no lace. Hazy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Faint ginger nose. Starts with sweet ginger flavor but very mild, finish - hops are there but not overpowering. $3.89 for a 11.2oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Overall, a very drinkable brew. I definitely recommend this one."
"finishes rather clean for such an experimental beer, but the drinkability suffers. a good accompinament for food.. good sipper, but not the strongest thing from kiuchi."
