"Overall - Very enjoyable and not overly sweet. Perfectly refreshing on a hot summer day and plenty of flavor available as well."

"Tall boy can. I was fairly convinced this would be horrible, but it's not that bad. This is not to say that it's particularly good. If I hadn't known this was 'lemon tea' I might not have noticed those flavors, but they are definitely there albeit subtle. The tea is in the initial taste while the finish is a standard, somewhat aqueous lager."

"Pours a clear gold colour with a nice chunky head that quickly dissipated into nothing, leaving behind no lace. Smells of iced tea, lemon, and wheat beer. Apparently, they used a blend of orange pekoe and earl grey to make this beer. I could taste the earl grey. Reminded me of when I drank earl grey tea as a kid because of Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek. Strong lemon aroma, with some grainy malts and tea leaves. Tastes a little stronger than it smells. Like someone mixed in lemon iced tea with a rather boring hefeweizen. I could see myself drinking this on a hot summers day after mowing the lawn. Then again, I could also have an iced tea after mowing the lawn as well. Would I drink it again? If it were offered. Would I buy it again? No."

"Excellent beer on the whole - super refreshing and very tasty. If you like beer and tea, this is a no brainer. Coors Light Iced T can eat its heart out."

"The carbonation is average, the body light, would make a great hot weather / summer drink."

"Pours a hazy, maize color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of strong earl grey tea, slight pale malt, slight sweet malt, and a hint of hop. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Fits the style of a Herbed / Spiced Beer. Tastes of strong tea, slight pale malt, slight sweet malt, and slight hops. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body. Since, this was a 'tea' beer the domination of tea in body and aroma was very pleasing. I also enjoyed the distinct and discernible flavor of the Earl Grey."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with light but decent flavors and aromas."

"Awesome to see this as part of the Summer mixed pack for 2012. This is a very unique Summer beer that uses the Tea notes and the Lemon in a balanced and understated way. You can tell its a Wheat beer but the tea flavours add some depth and dryness and the lemon adds a citrus note to the finish. Nice full mouthfeel and long finish, I will be buying more of this as the days get hotter."

"Overall- A great summer sipper by Mill Street. The unique tea flavours make this beer one of a kind. I'm pleased that the lemon and sweetness levels are well balanced and not overpowering. Session worthy on a hot summer day."
"O: I'll definitely buy this again -- it's a great summer beer that's more interesting than your average lager."

"had good carbonation and was easy to drink - overall an enjoyable beer to try."
"Different, refreshing, flavourful, but a bit too much like iced tea for my liking."
"O: It was a neat experiment, and its not a bad beer in the heat, but overall its not my thing. I probably wont get this again."
"O - an interesting brew however somewhat unbalanced - still plenty drinkable"
"D - Decent, but not all that enjoyable. Something different, and worth a try, but probably not worth revisiting."
"Overall- Very interesting beer here from a very quality Ontario craft brewery, I know it’s not your average beer and I haven’t seen any other lemon tea beers out there (and I make trips down to the states monthly). But for how out there this beer may be, it is something that you probably don’t want to miss, especially for you lemon and tea lovers this is a no brainer. I would definitely get this one again to sit down on my patio and drink it during a hot summer night, congrats Mill St. yet again another very quality beer, you keep showing us Ontarioins what you’re really made of."
"Overall. Very nice beer for a hot summer day. The flavours work much better together than I would have expected."
"I have a feeling this is the kind of brew people either love or hate, and I think I tend toward the former. If you're a purist and don't like the taste of tea or fruit in your beer, you probably shouldn't bother with this - without those pretensions though, this is a refreshing summer beer and is worth a try."
"Pour yields a murky light golden beer with a single-finger white head that dissipates pretty quickly and leaves a few spots of lacing behind. The nose brings forward a bit of lemon and not too much tea. Maybe a slight herbal character. Hint of toffee. The flavor reveals a strong diacetyl presence. The lemon is completely covered up. No bueno. Mouthfeel is pretty bad with a thick buttery character. Mild carbonation. Yuck."
"I'm surprised that this is 4.9% ABV from the light taste. Interesting and alternative beer but doesn't have enough kick to it. If you want to try something different, check it out, otherwise it's nothing special."
"Overall? This beer is getting a 3/5. Worth a try would say, but up to you ultimately whether it's your thing or not. Neat idea and props to a great Canadian Craft Brewery...Mill St!"
"Poured a filtered golden amber, with 3 or so fingers of fluffy head that fades as fast as it appeared. A thin ring of head remains, no lacing and no retention. Nose has some lemony and grassy hops, loads of lemon tea (surprise, surprise!), a general sweetness to it and darker (almost Earl Grey-like) herbal notes. Taste is super fizzy initially, again some thin and watery lemon tea, sweet malt and very mild hops. Some tea 'leafiness' in the finish. Mouth was thin and watery, super high carbonation. Drinkability isn't horrible, and definitely suited to the summer patio. Lemon tea for sure, and I'll give it a little more credit for nailing that, if unspectacularly."
"drinkability is bad. looked okay and smelled nice enough, but it was all downhill from there..."
"Overall: Not feeling it. I guess it's not my cup of tea (*groan*)."
"This one goes down easy. This is a great beer for summer, and a good beer for any old time."
"The Lemon Tea Beer from Mill Street Brewery is quite drinkable, avoiding being too sweet or having an overpowering or unnatural taste to it."
"D-I want to drink these all day at the beach. Not what I'd reach for all winter, but still great as an after-work beer. I really enjoy this brew."
"nice change of taste in a beer."
"Drinkability - Something different to try, i would not go out and get it again but was happy to have sampled."
"Medium/light body but lightly carbonated. I think that more carbonation might help but the lemon probably kills it. Minor quibble. Drinkability is good. Makes a refreshing summer wheat. Overall a nice take on a wheat beer, a field dominated by WTF? oddities."
"Drink - Another one of those beers that gets points for originality. I can see how it may appeal to some, especially on warm days, but it is not my style of beer. Definitely worth a try though."
"I could see lots of people loving this beer on a summer day but it's a little and weird and not what I would think of when I'm thinking beer"
"Sorta like someone added some lemon to that snowfresh beer, but watered it doen slightly. For what it's intended for, the patio in summer ( not that I would know after this year), it's a refreshing take on our favorite beverage."
"Very approachable yet nothing remarkable. No off flavours though. Hot summer weather lawnmower beer at best, and it would do the job well in that aspect."
"Copper looking beer and slightly hazed, even though I did swirl the can after pouring 2/3rd of it. The head looks creamy but disappear quickly. The aroma is nicely balanced from citrus and tea. Couldn't expect anything else. This is actually not bad and it is inviting. On the taste, it doesn't taste like a beer but actually a lemon tea. It is very refreshing and it feels like drinking a beer. I really like this beer. Very high drinkability on this one. The taste is not off putting too so I would say this is a very good refreshing beer. I don't see myself drinking this during an evening watching football or a movie, however, this is the ultimate beer for an afternoon at the park."
"D - Torn on this. If you can get past the fact it doesn't taste like beer than sure, give 'er. Easy to drink though."
"While I wouldn't reach for this if I wanted a beer, this is a very thirst quenching and enjoyable summer drink. I would hope that it'd attract many new non-beer drinkers to the craft beer world."
"D- Hits the spot and it's very accurate to the name. Unoffensive by any means. I would actually put ice cubes in this one. The more beerlike version of a long island iced tea."
"This is exactly what it says on the label; ""Lemon Tea Beer"". If you don't like real ice tea then saty away. This is a beer for a mood. If you want to sit back on a sweltering day and have some ice tea with a kick then this is absolutely perfect. f what you really wanted was a 'beer' then have your beer. I like this for what it is. I wouldn't want it to replace beery beer but it is hitting the spot on a 43C August evening in swampy Ottawa."
"D - Good drinkability."
"M: A medium lasting ending not really incredible, with a bitter and dry feeling at the end."
"Body is light and drinkability is a good. While not first choice on a patio there is some appeal there and all things being equal I think Mill St. have done a bang up job with this one."
"It's not bad, worth a shot."
"Pale amber orange in colour, very lightly hazy. It's thin head fizzles out fast. Aroma of lemon and tea with a slight floral edge to it, and a mild ""beeriness"" in the background. The packaging promises you it will taste like lemon and tea, and delivers on that promise. It's sweet but not overly so. It's a bit tangy from the lemon and wheat malt. It has mild tannic finish that any tea drinker will recognize. It's light, refreshing, easy drinking, and tastes very natural. It may not taste like beer, but it delivers on what it promises to taste like. It seems well made in that respect - this is no highly processed and artificial tasting alcopop. It's definately not Bud Light Lime or Miller Chill either, though it might appeal to the same demographics. It doubt it would appeal to the geeks. A quality summer quencher with mass appeal."
"Interesting, but not something I'd go looking for. Not quite in the same league as a proper fruit beer."
"Clear gold with a decent head of foam. Honey, tea, lemon-citrus dominate the nose. Flavour has a bit more general beeriness with a wheaty twang. Fairly honey-sweet and tea flavour is understated. Tea and herbal hops mix nicely. Definitely interesting. Sweet, but not too sweet. Strong points of this brew are balance and drinkability. Good summer beer that has a bit more oomph."
"Final Thoughts: Another solid offering by the folks at Mill St. who are probably one of the best brewers in Ontario. I think honestly, if they brought this down to about 4.5% or 4.2% abv and maybe gave it a bit more sweet malt it would be a thing of exceptional greatness."
"Overall this is a unique beer and very refreshing, but perhaps a bit too sweet, but still a good summer beer nonetheless."
"If I wanted an alcoholic beverage that didn't taste like beer / booze (why drink then?) I would get a cooler. If I wanted a beer I wouldn't want this either."
"Not a bad seasonal from Mill St - certainly better than I had expected, but probably not something I'll pick up on a regular basis. I don't think I could drink too many of these in a night. Worth a try though."
"Tangerine hue with a large foamy beige head to start out with, sheet lace slips down the glass. While the retention was not very good, it did regenerate admirably with a swirl to the bitter lemon end. Smell was citrusy, tea aroma is unmistakeable with a lemon-lime backdrop. Taste is appropriately tart lemon with a doughy consistency, tea-like astringency is not offensive. This beer has huge novelty appeal, curious and interesting, well done for what it is and above average refreshment value. The mouthfeel has a cleansing quality to it but a slight artificial feel as well, a saccharine element of sorts that keeps it from being an exemplary beer. Still it is far superior to those coolers out there that pretend to be what they're not. Overall, this beer experiment works just fine and I'd recommend you try it, you might well want to have this on hand for a patio or pool party this summer, it would be a big hit in mixed company; bravo to Mill St. for making the effort."
"A unique experiment but not something I would rave about. A few tweaks could make this quite nice though."
"Not impressed. No body to speak of."
"d-Very drinkable....I was almost completely done my can when I was done my review."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep golden color ale with a large foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of orange and tea is more dominant then expected and very unique. Taste is quite intense with lots of notes of tea and orange with a bland malt bill. Body is slightly fuller then I would have expected with good carbonation. I must admit that this was a more intense experience then I was expecting and even now I am not sure if I would want to try this often thought I wouldn't say this was a bad beer."
"Pours a pale yellow with almost no head nor lacing. It smells like lemon herbal tea. If I had my eyes closed, I would think this was lemon hearbal tea, not beer. Taste has lots of the lemon tea, with a little bitterness and some sour lemon flavour. Nice carbonation level. If you like lemon tea, I'm sure you'd like this, but it is too one dimensional. I still could see this being a hit for Mill Street, I just don't have plans to buy anymore."
"d - pretty easy drinking, reminding me of the ""white"" beers that have become popular in Canada in the last couple years. Would make a nice summer patio beverage."
"D - I must say that I was quite pleased with this one. My expectations were not all that high, but they well exceeded those. Although rather bland on the appearance and scent, the flavour came through for the win!"
"D: flies down the hatch in no time. A first class example of the style, and probably my highest-rated fruit beer. Nice work, Mill Street!"
" Really a nice refreshing summer beer...enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
"It's incredibly drinkable. That said, it's not something I'll repeat, as a good lemony hefe or crisp pilsner is more my summertime thing. But according to the back of the bottle this will come in cans this summer and I might have to keep a small stash in my fridge for visitors who say they don't like beer. This might change their mind."
"If Mill Street was aiming for the perfect summer beer, they hit it almost spot on. I was lucky enough to find this in the loose bin, allowing me to not commit to the mixed 6, but with their Pilsner thrown in, I'd say it's definitely worth picking up. In terms of their bottled beer, I'd say this one sits on par with the best Mill Street has to offer."
"Tastes something like a 30/70 mix of iced tea to beer. I honestly think that if I had never tried Tornado, I would have a different opinion of this beer. For what was intended, it's a good effort; just not one that I'm entirely appreciating. I could see lots of this stuff being consumed this summer but don't think I'll be helping out with that. If I want a refreshing wheat beer in Toronto, I'll grab a Denison's."
"I have to admit that before trying it I thought the only thing a lemon tea beer would prove is that some things are better left alone - boy was I wrong! This is an exceptionally refreshing ale that is perfectly suited to warm-weather drinking. Provided the sound of this beer sounds remotely appealing to you, then I guarantee it will be."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. I was skeptical at first about this but after having it a couple times, it is pretty damn good."
"Edit: Just got back from Volo. The humidex is at 40 and I've got to say this is the perfect summer seasonal. Drinkability through the roof in the weather its intended for. I've upped the drinkability to 5."
"A very good approximation of when lemon-flavoured black tea and a plain-ass 'stock' ale collide. I'm duly glad that the Earl Grey's bergamot oil, which I'm altogether less than partial towards, is well obfuscated by the lemon, and equally buoyed by the workaday (my days, usually) Orange Pekoe in the mix. A decent summer quaff, overall."
"D: I could see people drinking this on a patio."
"On tap at C'est What Spring Festival of Craft Brewers. Average beer. Yellow with lots of lace. Middle-mouthfeel, drinkable. Yeah some lemon black tea taste. If I want that, I will get my unsweetened snapple. Probably some will like it, a novelty really, a fruit beer. Might be better with honey, I do put honey in my tea."
"This is an excellent, straightforward summer sipper. Its light in taste but interesting with the understated tea flavors. Very easy to quaff. Another winner from Toronto's best brewpub."
