Flavor follows the nose - real nice malt bill, the orange zest and coriander are subtle and the honey is nice, finishes with light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, light carbonation and a dry finish.

Nose is heavy pilsner grain, lightly toasted, with light notes of citric orange and a honey tinge underneath. Taste is more balanced, the honey gives it a creamy body and adds gently to the toasted grain. Also some caramel malt notes, sweet but well attenuated, with citrus notes and a bit of herbal hops.

The taste has a little bit of honey in it which might be interesting if the rest of the beer was more solid. Because the rest of the beer is so lacking, the honey just seems like it's an attempt to hide the impurities and imperfections in the beer. The mouthfeel is pretty flat and unremarkable.

Nose was orange, lemon and some spice (coriander and nuttiness) and some belgian-like yeast. Taste was very sweet, with oranges and honey in the forefront. There is some hint of spice in the back but this beer stays on the same theme throughout — sweet. Since I love the hoppy offerings of this brewer, I was disappointed to find not much here. I felt like it should be syrupy, but actually it has a pretty light mouthfeel. It has very little carbonation (and seems to beg for more). Alpine has so many good beers but sadly this isn't one of them. I wouldn't go out of my way for another of these.","regspeir","Jul 29, 2011"

I might be crazy, but I also smell some caramel in there also. I get a bunch of caramel in the flavor also. The orange really takes a back seat in the flavor.

Taste is sweet with the malt hitting you upfront followed by orange peels. The orange oil lingers in the mouth. This is perhaps a bit too sweet. As it warms a spiciness comes through that was masked by the cold. Mouthfeel is light. Almost soda like. This will appeal to those who like fruit beers but it may just be a tad too sweet for me. One should be enough. This isn't bad for a novelty. I just don't think I could sit here downing too many of these.","sleazo","Jan 15, 2007"

The smell was a strong mandarin orange aroma with some malt. The taste was dominated by orange flavor, but there was also a good maltiness. It reminded me of an orange milkshake. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and strong carbonation. Fruity orange and malty flavors gave this a nice feel.

The orange flavor was quite subdued as was any hint of hops. The mouthfeel was very flat and could have used a little more carbonation.
