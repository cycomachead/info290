4,18,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 2/4/2015. Pours hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, clove, wheat, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of bready malt, agave, and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, clove, wheat, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness and light wheat tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, clove, wheat, biscuit, honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. very nice robustness and balance of bready malt, agave, and fruity/earty yeast flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a damn nice pale wheat ale style. All around great robustness and balance of bready malt, agave, and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 06, 2015"

3.5,3.2,,,,,,"I bought this on grand opening day from a big box wine chain store. Some earthy fruit on the nose, a hint of mustiness and a shot of skunk. Pours hazy, murky straw under a ½” off-white foam cap that quickly dissipates to a thick film. I try to swirl off the skunk but it still interferes with the big fruity flavors over white wonder bread that lead to a tart finish and a suspicion of wet cardboard. Well carbonated with a very creamy medium body. My rating gives this beer the benefit of the doubt, assuming that some of the flaws in my bottle derived from mishandling.

Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. The brew smells like wheat, apples and honey/agave nectar. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and apricots noticeable too. It's mostly sweet tasting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has a decent amount of carbonation. I think it's an OK brew, but it really doesn't do anything for me.

No agave taste, but agave syrup doesn't have a strong flavor either so maybe expecting too much. Good mouth feel, medium bodied. Taste not very strong, bready wheat flavor, didn't pick up multiple flavors. A beer without an assertive personality.","beermemarge","May 12, 2014"

The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN. Before I could initiate the Glug, The Old Lady looked over and exclaimed, "Oooh, I've never had it in the CAN!" ROFLMAO! Not wanting to waste another second, I got the Glug going and then really gave it to her. Color was an extremely cloudy golden-yellow, near pineapple juice, with a turbidity like river water. SRM = 6. Nose had a soft mandarin orange scent. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a nice orangish flavor in the mouth. Finish was semi-sweet, still orangish and really much better than I have ever had this beer either in a bottle or on-draft. Score one for the CANs!","woodychandler","Aug 05, 2013"

There's the wheat and broad sweetness in the smell, and the taste is full of the wheat with the touch of agave, which doesn't add much in terms of flavor but does seem to provide an unbalanced sweetness, which seems to be the main problem with this one. Mouthfeel is relatively dry, with moderate thickness and a sticky aftertaste. Overall, it doesn't offer much, and again, it's too sweet and too sticky for me to drink in a session and not interesting enough to seek out again.","DeFaz","Aug 03, 2013"

This beer is underrated, but I understand why as it is different and feels a little weird for a beer taste-wise. Personally I think this agave-flavored style has a future and I'd like to see more of it. I could see agave ales becoming a class of their own. It has a good malty sweet characteristic that isn't cloying and pairs well with biscuity malts while keeping a beer light and sessionable. Give it a try.","Cylinsier","Jul 11, 2013"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and crisp, but that flavors couldn't hold my attention at all, one is enough, I want something that delivers what they advertise. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were both a little better then average. What I liked least about this beer was the bland flavors and the fact that the agave didn't show up in the aroma and taste at all and that should have been showcased in this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have an Oberon, I don't recommend giving this beer a try, it's a waste of agave. This is the second beer I have had from Breckenridge and it was another unimpressive and average at best beer just like their Lucky U IPA, I am still down to try another beer from them, but it better be a good one if they want to hold my interest, so far I'm not impressed with them.","StoutHunter","May 25, 2012"

3.03,-10.6,3.5,3,3,3,3,"This stuff has always been interesting, but not enough for me to buy any. Thankfully, there are tastings at Bliss. It pours a cloudy straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises fake blueberry (think pretty much any blueberry wheat ale available on the market), dark wheat, light orange rind, and a dash of nutmeg. The taste holds notes of wheat, coriander, white grapes (lightly tart, and only just barely that), nutmeg, and grapefruit peel. A vague astringency lingers on the tongue. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, I cannot say I was a fan of this beer. The agave nectar doesn't do much for it, and it comes off as astringent and medicinal regardless. Luckily, things aren't exactly offensive, either. Just not very good.","TMoney2591","Aug 05, 2011"

There was the wheatiness that comes with unfiltered wheat beers and sour fruit that matched the smell, but I was hoping for an even stronger showing of sour fruit based on the smell. Nevertheless it was still good and it finished with a lingering tartness that I enjoyed. Definitely had some zip of carbonation to it. Mouthfeel was fairly watery and light.

3.88,14.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Welcome to Kentucky Agave Wheat. And just in time to meet the heat of the summer, it should go over well. A firm wheat base malt is evident throughout the beer giving low bananna, clove, or bubblegum notes. Instead, an estery apple, lemon, berry, and pear mix gives the beer a refreshing, fruity taste. The lemon notes are complemented well by the agave flavors-- not so much tequilla, but a crisp, acidic, citric, vegitable/fruit character that stands out well without dominating the beer. The base beer is substantially better than most American wheats, but doesn't try to become too rich with breadiness or creaminess. Refreshing, minty, citrus flavors in the finish. A very nice summery beer.","BEERchitect","Aug 08, 2008"
3.06,-9.7,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours a cloudy pale yelow color with a white head. In the aroma, fruity, agave and banana, a nice yeasty aroma too. In the taste, dry fruitiness and a dry banana flavor. A small bite, but mainly smooth mouthfeel, with a semi-dry and fruity aftertaste. Kind of fruity, and a nice dryness, good and different.","OWSLEY069","Aug 07, 2008"

The flavor is a nice wheat with the expected hint of cloves and banana and some earthiness to it. This was obviously very easy to drink and went well with enchiladas.","ArrogantB","Jul 08, 2008"

3.57,5.3,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"D - A very well made American wheat w/ the addition of agave makes this a step up from a wit/wheat IMO. The drinkability is high since it is a very quaffable refreshing beverage w/ a flavor that is hard not to like if you enjoy wheat beers.","Slatetank","May 12, 2008"
3,-11.5,3,3,3,3,3,"A yeast clouded golden color with a white head. The nose is of wheat and some very light fruits. The taste is similarly uncomplex.

Aroma citrus sharp wheat notes with powdered yeast pack accents. Agave nectar I'm not quite sure how that's coming across in the taste, but the citrus and wheat notes strike me initially with soft yeast notes in the finish and an unique quality not a bad American pale wheat much better than the typical version. Mouthfeel is light carbonation is prickly and finishes with more citrus peel zestiness. Drinkability is okay especially in the summer months not sure if this is a seasonal offering or a year rounder but it's okay.","WVbeergeek","Apr 26, 2008"

The flavor is a touch dry with a sweet honey-like taste from the agave. There's a bit of wheat in there too. Not a great beer, but refreshing and worth a try if you're into American wheats.","tempest","Apr 24, 2008"

3.83,13,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by this wheat variation using agave. The golden yellow clear coloration and aroma was just average for a wheat with hints of bananas and pears. The taste, however, was very smooth with a sweet aftertaste. The agave taste is subtle with a pear/citus flavor and very enjoyable. This brew could be enjoyed by itself or with a light meal. It's more of a summer brew, and I would definitely buy this beer again. I like it better than their Hefe Proper.","Norsebrew","Mar 13, 2008"
