Bready and clean with the wheat particularly noticeable, the spice additions complement this aspect quite well. Lemony and citrusy with some herbal characteristics, this seems to suggest that the brewers were striving to interpret a saison and a witbier as a lager. Faint coriander character is present as well. The palate opens juicy, mildly sweet with honey, bread and the orange peel lending a big juiciness. The coriander appears mid-palate, along with the floral chamomile. Mildly earthy too. Hop character is light. Drying on the finish, mildly watery (disappointingly so), this beer is crisp, highly carbonated and has a wonderful, lingering chamomile flavor on the finish. Refreshing stuff.","DefenCorps","Nov 24, 2014"

The middle of the beer seems to glow a bit with a light as it passes through the haze. The nose is gracefull and has the malt up front. Wheat sweetness with a bit of the corriander laid in earthy. So it's what but a bit edgy. There's chamomille and that's floral and sweet. There's a soft breath of lemongrass faintly in the background and the orange peel comes up earthy to the nose as well. The taste is subtle but spicy. As the ingredients combine they create a very unique flavor. The what is dry and crisp, the chamomille floral and sweet the lemon grass is also faint on the palate. The surprise is the subtle and gentle orange. it's not loud but it is powerfull. It too has an earthiness but it brings the sweetness of the orange t the drink in a way that is light yet juicy. Drinks softly and pleasantly. Crisp lager carbonation that is perfect with a just enough bite. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy in defiance of the spicy character.","utopiajane","Jul 01, 2014"

It’s creamy while still being crisp and very clean. I’m surprised that this isn’t rated more highly as I thought it was really tasty and extremely drinkable. I’ve been really impressed with all of the Jack’s Abby beers that I’ve had and I hope that lagers become more widely-brewed. When done well, they can be very special.

Easy to drink regardless, especially with the abv. Price reflects that, at $2.69 for a 500 mL bottle.

4.3,15,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,"The beer pours a pale and hazy yellow, with a big, bright, eggshell white head of smooth bubbles on top. The head sits at a little over a finger’s width and leaves a lacing of medium thick sheets on the sides of the glass. The beer’s body is properly cloudy with a wheat protein haze and a steady stream of bubbles that are slowly working their way to the beer’s head. On the nose, the beer tastes clean and light with whiffs of cardamom and citrus orange peel interplaying with light wheat flakes. The orange occasionally steps over into a more lemony flavor on the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes crisply sweet with light bitter spice and a touch of citric tartness. In flavor the beer begins as clean wheat malt that slowly builds towards a full bodied wheat flake flavor. As the wheat flavor builds, spices move in on the tongue to give big bursts of cardamom and then a snap of citric orange peel and lemongrass and just a touch of chamomile. The finish is a whirlpool of all the flavors with a final hiccup of wheat flakes, and the after taste of light, clean wheat malt and a slight citric tart bite of lemon on the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels on the plus side of light in body with a crisp and fluffy carbonation that snaps the tongue at the beginning of the sip and then cradles it. The mouth is left wet with acid neutralizing spittle, and begging for more beer. Overall, this is one hell of a summer beer and a great light sipper with terrific flavor and complex simplicity. I love the spices and the citric snap on the palate, and I could knockback this beer all day long. They should can this! If you are looking for a beer to put back this summer, try this!","Maxwell","May 22, 2013"

It is light and crisp with a pleasant amount of carbonation so it goes down very smooth. It’s flavorful but not overpowering which makes it a great beer to compliment any meal. And my favorite part about all Jack’s Abby beers beside the creativity is it’s affordable as hell!","RummyRedbeard","May 19, 2013"

3.73,-0.3,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"500ml bottle served in a nonic. Summer 2012 indicated on the back label. Pours a hazy, yellow-gold, almost buttery hue, with a dense, 2.5 inch bright white head. Head eventually settles into a consistent half inch cap - cat scratch swaths of lacing are revealed during the session. Nose reveals lemon, citrus rind, a suggestion of coriander and a yeasty/wheaty character somewhat akin to a Berlinner Weisse. Taste is a bit subdued but is comprised of chamomile, a light, lemony quality and just a kiss of wheat. There is an extremely faint orange presence towards the finish that drops off almost as soon as you experience it. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation and just a hint of astringency expressed as a light tingle towards the back and side of the tongue. Overall, a decent, albeit not particularly flavorful, witbier. There are definitely some interesting nuances, but the spiciness one's tends to associate with the style is not really present. Nonetheless, easy drinking and refreshing. Definitely worth a try.","Jwale73","Aug 27, 2012"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"What a well named beer. It’s not a true weis beer at all, but it has just enough wheat to give it that pale sipping weis flavor. That combined with the tradional light type lager, and amazing very mild spices, it’s such a great hot summer day leisure time lager. The spice additions are really what make this beer rock though. If it was just a wheat/lager it’d be boring, those little spice notes are the cherry on top. Actually, you know what this beer really reminds me of… a Berliner weis. But instead of adding syrup, it was steeped with a very mild tea of chamomile, lemongrass, orange, coriander and a very mild honeycomb (I know there’s none in it, but damn it I taste honey). Cool beer.","taez555","0"
