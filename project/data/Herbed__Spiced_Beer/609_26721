It's got a bit going on here, but it's not quite strong enough to get your anticipation up. Flavor begins with sweet malt and a yeasty ale character, moves into a slight bitterness and ends with the taste of fresh basil. Basil also dominates the aftertaste. It has a medicinal quality that reminds me of chewing fresh basil. It's not bad. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Standard, easy drinking feel. I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. The herbal flavors imparted by the basil really work with the sweet malt flavors and the dryness from the honey, making it a nice refreshing beer. It's a nice herbed beer to try if you don't want something too extreme.","Auraan","May 16, 2013"

Bison Organic Honey Basil pours out a red-amber color with a finger of head. The aroma is basically what the nose says. Honey and basil. On the tongue though ... hey, is this a pumpkin beer with honey? Of course, pumpkin beers very rarely taste of pumpkin, they taste of the various spices. And I'm getting this big-time behind the basil and the honey. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability isn't all that great. Too much on the spice for me.

Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it tastes like honey, basil and herbs, but there's also a slight medicinal flavor.

Aroma is basil and garlic with just a touch of honey, only a mild malt presence appears on the nose. The taste is sweet malts up front with an interesting spice balance. The beer is light, smooth and very easy drinking. I believe this beer would pair nicely with pizza, I'll have to try that sometime!","atsprings","Jun 06, 2010"
3.3,-5.7,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a murky orange amber with little head. What head there is fades to a very thin swirl. Smells very sweet. with lots of honey and a vague herbal flavor on top. I'd like the expression of basil to be clearer, as is the aromas are too sweet and muddled. Almost medicinal at the end. The flavor is a little better, with less sweetness and more balanced herbalness with a finish that has some more noticeable basil flavor, and some light firm maltiness. Drying toward the end. A little bit watery, but overall fairly drinkable.","Georgiabeer","Apr 14, 2010"
3.59,2.6,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - This is an odd beer, it tastes much more like a spiced winter beer than I would have expected. The honey is present in the aroma but only survives as a background note in the flavor. The spice character is all over the place and is clearly influenced by the caramel malt character. The only clear basil note I get is in the aftertaste and even then it is obscured by toasted malt and lightly fruity yeast that seem to produce spice notes, such as coriander, that apparently aren't there. Interesting, but a bit cloying on both the sweetness and the spice notes and not all that drinkable. Worth a try, but I'm glad I don't have a six pack of this.","nickfl","Apr 05, 2010"

3.45,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3,4,4,"Pours into a general ale amber color, with a standard creamy head. The aroma is similar to an amber as well, with hints of hops, a sort of wheatiness, and (and here's where it starts to get unique) there is a hint of, surprise surprise, basil. The taste follows suit, with the basil receding a good deal into the background. There isn't much of a honey flavor involved, though I do believe it added a bit of lightness to the body (without resorting to uber-effervescence), which made this brew a rather drinkable one, despite it's overall lack of general character.","TMoney2591","Nov 23, 2009"

3.8,8.6,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Appearance was a pale amber with decent carbonation. Smells is dominated by basil, but not an overwhelming aroma. The taste is also dominated by the basil. The honey is very subtle at first, but seems to come through more in the finish. A bit thin on the mouthfeel. I really wasn't sure I'd like this style, but it's actually pretty good. Not a beer you'd want in mass quantities, but still a good change of pace in the summer and probably is an excellent food pairing for chicken and the like.","HoosBrews","Apr 01, 2007"

3.36,-4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Crystal clear mellow gold. Towering, glass-filling head of loose packed dusty white foam of mixed size bubbles. Heavily dimpled surface that slowly settles, but leaves a thick chunk on top all the way down. There were a few wide, thick strands of lacing. Minimal carbonation streams drift upwards. Sweet, light honey and zest comes through along with a ginger ale soda aroma. The lightly sweet honey fills out the initial flavor with just a touch of pale malt. There is a spiciness that shows up in the finish that is barely discernable as basil. Had I not known to expect basil, I probably would not have identified it as such. There is a general saison component to the taste that is perhaps more suggestive than actual. The spiciness changes over to a bitterness which clings at the edges for a tad bit too long. Medium body and smooth to soft mouthfeel, the carbonation is on the low side. Nice that this is a certified organic beer which includes basil from Watanabe Farms and honey from Britts Honey, but the basil was barely discernable. Still, this was enjoyable.","hopsaplenty","May 22, 2006"
3.64,4,3,4,4,3,3,"This beer poured very golden and clear with no head, not what I expected from other reviews. Its smell is very nice and reminds me of the times that I have made mead, ""very faintly"" but it did really. This beers taste has little resemblance to mead though, the basil stands out a little bit which makes me wonder where the hints of garlic. (Should I brew a pesto beer or just add honey and beer to my next pesto?) Over all this Honey Basil Beer is very welcoming, especially strait from the freezer on this first 80+ day of the year. I would recommend this for a Mid-Summers Day picnic serve as cold as you can get it. Cheers","DeGrog","May 05, 2006"

I am a true believer in organic foods, especially meat and milk products. But I've yet to have an organic beer really wow me.

3.44,-1.7,3,4,3.5,3,3,"Received a bottle from our local rep the other day and figured I'd give it a try. Pours a slightly cloudy golden color topped by a big, foamy white head. Aroma offers what the name promises - light honey, sharp basil, some lavender notes, and some astringency. Palate is more of the same - basil is the dominant character, with light hops and a tinge of honey sweetness. Body is nice, light and refreshing, but there's a good bit of tangy astringency that's slightly off-putting. Maybe this floats some people's boats more than others, but I found it difficult to finish the bottle. Nevertheless, an interesting offering.","ElGordo","Mar 31, 2006"
3.95,12.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a pint glass out of a 22oz. bottle. Pours a golden color with a head that soon disappears into a few bubbles. Slight hop aroma with strong hints of honey and some lemony smells. Taste is good, had nice hop backbone with honey and cirtus flavors. The basil flavors seem less noticable. Feels a little thinner in the mouth than I would like, but still pretty good. Very drinkable.","gosurfobx","Mar 22, 2006"
