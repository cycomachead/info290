"I don't even like root beer, but this is awesome. really phenomenal."
""
""
"Wow, I can't even taste the alcohol, taste just like root beer. And I really don't know what to say about it but it is really good in a strange way."
""
"Tastes like root beer. Not even like alcoholic root beer, just root beer. Can't wait to find a higher abv version"
""
"Not really sure how to rate this beer, but it's really really good.  Tastes like root beer, not root beer flavored beer, but just straight up tasty root beer."
""
"Pretty incredible how well the alcohol is hidden. Tastes like very good root beer....but watch out."
"First couple sips I loved it. By the time I was done it had gotten weird"
""
"Basically a lower carbonated root beer soda. How does this have alcohol in it? Pretty good, but don't think I can drink a ton of this in one sitting. I liked the 10% better as the alcohol cut the sweetness a bit more."
"So wonderful. I haven't had a soda in over a year and this just rang true."
""
"O: To be honest, in a blind taste test I could see how someone could confuse this with a root beer. I loved it!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks like root beer. Smells like root beer. Must be root beer! Oh wait..."
""
""
""
"Different than anything I've ever had."
""
""
"My favorite hard root beer...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally got my hands on a 6 pack around here and it is a very good tasting beer that is if you like root beer of course."
""
"Unbelievably similar to actual root beer. Amazing 1st taste and goes down smooth and tastefully with a slight boozy ending. As great as it is i wouldnt be able to drink more then 2 in a day....Overall would love to always have a 6pack handy in the fridge, solid...solid brew. Must try!"
"Taste like a good root beer, don't even know there is alcohol in it"
""
""
"Overall - I would like to pick the right day, and drink 12 of these to make sure it has alcohol."
"Bottle. This recently (and aggressively) hit Massachusetts distribution. Clearly all of these 'Root Beer Beers' are highly regarded on this sight. So this is apparently an actually beer brewed with flavor added. Is it a Mike's Hard sort of scenario? I truly do not know. The beer pours dark, clear brown. Looks like root beer. The smell is goddamn root beer. I'm not going to describe specifics; its root beer, bro. Sweet Christ, it's root beer in the tongue! The only difference between this and a Barq's is a touch of alcohol after each sip. Very sugary and bubbly. Actually made my cheeks flush. This is beer? Is it? Does it taste good because it tastes like root beer? I'm confused, again. I'm not the biggest root beer guy anyway but hell, they nailed it."
""
"This is actually insane. It tastes exactly like root beer. I guess I expected a beer with root beer-like qualities. Nope. This is a root beer with no beer-like qualities. I don't understand how it was crafted to taste like this. Great work, Small Town Brewery."
"It's root beer, almost perfectly realized. The head is finer and more uniform than the irregular foam of real root beer, and the flavor carries a faint harshness of alcohol to it, but otherwise it is spot-on. Totally deviant from classic 'beer', but totally delicious. Cheers!"
""

"Smell is amazing. Exactly what it says, it's root beer. Taste is really sweet, I mean really sweet. I can't drink much of this but I'm impressed with nailing what was intended."
""
"Really good, tastes a lot like root beer, I get a little malt/hop taste on the finish, this would go great over vanilla ice cream"
"Hopefully it will be available in Florida soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's freaking root beer people. Not sure why people are losing their GD minds over this. It tastes like...root....beer. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. A good root beer with booze in it. "
""
""
""
""
""
"This is straight up amazing. It is exactly what you want it to be and I don't see how it could be improved at all."
""
""
"This is some legit stuff right here. Looks like root beer. Smells like root beer. Tastes like root beer. Makes a good vanilla float like root beer. No alcohol detectable, and yet it's there. Dangerous stuff. Would I drink this all the time? No. But for what it is, it's pretty much perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"After a 4pk myself I convinced myself I liked this beer more for the novelty than the actual taste. A strong alcohol odor wafting from this once in the glass. Very close to that of vodka. The vodka smell seemed stronger while the head was present, never leaving the nose throughout the drink."
""
""
""
""
"This vanilla bomb does not taste at all like anything an adult with an even marginally developed palate would enjoy. It's a vanilla bomb, no discernible sarsaparilla or traditional oak notes at all. Good gateway ""beer"" for 12 year olds and man children."
"Tastes exactly like root beer but you feel it after a couple"
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells just like root beer and tastes delicious.  Not overly sweet, and does a great job of highlighting the sassafras.  I wish the carbonation would have been higher to more closely resemble that of a root beer, but overall this is pretty damn tasty.  Big thanks to bshemansky for sending this as an extra."
""
"I rate this highly because they've accomplished what they set out to do. You can make adult Root-beer floats with this stuff."
""
"This probably would have been my favorite ""beer"" when I was 15, now, not so much."
"Rating it as a beer is difficult because this looks, smells, tastes, and feels exactly like a really, really good root beer. Well, I like it and I think they hit what they were trying to brew perfectly, so I will rate it as such. This takes me back to when I was a kid and my family would get a jug of root beet at the root beer stand. It is amazing what people can brew."
""
"Not a lot to say it taste like root beer I can see where people can really like this one decent brew here"
""
""
""
""
"Tastes a lot like root beer."
""
"Straight up...with alcohol or not this is the best root beer I've ever had. Epic."
""
""
"Not a lot of say about this one other than that it looks, smells, and tastes EXACTLY like root beer. Not a beer with root beer flavors; exactly like root beer. I dug it, as did most people, and I couldn't taste any alcohol in it at all. Really cool, don't know how they do this."
""
""
"Fantastic."
""
"Way too sweet for me.  Tastes more like bubble gum.  Does hide the alcohol well if that is what you are after."
"Everything else is root beer. A little alcohol aftertaste. If you like root beer this is for you. Or you can buy your favorite root beer and add ever clear. I don't know."
""
"I'd say it's a novelty, and I can definitely see where some would enjoy it. I wasn't crazy about it though."
"Unique beer. Not really something I'd want all of the time but maybe if your in the mood for some booze that tastes like rootbeer."
""
"I was really looking forward to trying. I was disappointed with the taste. Should be easy to get rid of, I'm the only person I know that isn't raving about this. It's a cool idea, but not my fancy."
""

"This pours a dark brown color with little to no carbonation. The aroma is big and rich with a root beer scent with a hint of booze. The taste is smooth and easy drinking. The root beer flavor is very evident with little bit of an awkward chalky aftertaste.  Very interesting and unique to say the least."

"You are a pretentious d bag if you don't like this brew"
""
"Root beer smell and taste is spot on. More like a mixed drink than beer though. Would like to try the heavier versions."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is good, but it would be great if they had more carbonation. It is basically like drinking a flat root beer. There is absolutely no alcohol taste. I may try a root beer float with this."
""
""
"Overall, I rated this as world class in smell and taste because it does smell and taste exactly like root beer. Not one of the best root beers, but certainly isn't a Mug or Barq's. Well worth the price, and I can't imagine many root beer fans being disappointed with this."
"I don't drink pop anymore but when I did I loved root beer.And this stuff reminds me of old fashioned root beer very tasty."
""
""
"Loved this beer!  Very smooth but, has a little bite at the end.  Could be dangerous!!"

"I had no idea that it would look, smell, and taste this much like root beer... I gave it a 3.75 because I'm impressed at how much this looks and smells like root beer, but I really don't like it much.  All that being said, I'd still kind of like to try the 19% version to see if all the added ABV balances out the super sweetness."
"Overall this is awesome if you love root beer. I can see some people saying that this is too sweet, and I probably wouldn't drink a bunch of these, but one ever now and then is a great treat."
"Impressive; this is not only spot-on as a root beer, but is the best root beer I've ever had. No hint that this is alcoholic, apart from the label."
"There is not much to say about this other than it is indistinguishable from root beer.  It is an interesting gimmick of sorts, but I'm just left thinking ""what's the point?""."
""
"This is a novelty that is way over hyped. Tastes like someone dumped some liquor in some rootbeer and bottled it. If you like wine coolers this is your thing else stay away from it. Drain poor. Yuck."
""
""
"Good if you like rootbeer"
""
"This Is Not your father's root beer...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's entirely too sweet for what a good root beer aims at, and there's a lingering aftertaste that sort of falls into more of a diet root beer one that brings the mouth feel of artificial sweeteners into the picture as well.  You cannot taste the alcohol at all, which is probably a very good thing. Oh I found it.  It took a swishing, and yeah. This is just not working. And, it's certainly not a root beer that I would want my father to drink either."
""
"Disclaimer:  I love root beer.  Looks like a normal root beer with its rich brown color.  Great carbonation.  Smells similar to Dad's root beer initially with that distinctive root beer spice, but then opens up with artificial caramel and a weird take on root beer bottle caps.  It tastes like the smell of an overheating vacuum and cheap whiskey with a hint of burnt sugar.  I'm talking about a pot of sugar left on the stove way too long after some one's first attempt at making caramel.  The cheap whiskey flavor isn't the only alcohol flavor present by no means!  The aftertaste tastes like off-brand cough syrup with black licorice lit on fire with a blow torch.  Biggest disappointment in awhile.  After this and the abysmal Sprecher's hard root beer, I am convinced alcohol ruins root beer.  Now, I need to go drink some delicious root beer like Boylan's, Stewart's, Frostop, Dad's, Jones, etc.  Don't buy into the hype."
"I can honestly say that I've never had anything like this. I'm surprised it's rated so highly. It's probably the sweetest beer I've ever had. Not crazy about it."
"This literally looks like, smells like, and tastes exactly like root beer. A&W root beer, specifically, thanks to a heavy vanilla presence. This is a brewing marvel, though at the end of the day, I probably wouldn't want to pound these, just like I wouldn't drink more than 1 root beer in a sitting. It really is remarkable though. Very, very tasty."
""
"I found it impossible to finish a 8oz. pour.  The sweetness is overpowering and gives the ""beer"" a cola like quality."
""
""
""
""
"Other thoughts: I was waiting for Wilford Brimley to jump out of my glass and tell me I have the diabetes from drinking this sugar filled mess."
"Gimicky as shit, but cool to show people who don't like or are very picky about beer"
"Honestly, if you poured someone a glass of this and didn't tell them it was alcoholic, they would never be able to tell.  It's hands-down one of THE best root beers I've ever had, let alone having booze in it!!  Can't wait to try the 10% and 19%.  Where has this been all my life?!"
""
""
""
"Not a fan of rootbeer. This beer is waaaay to sweet for me"
"A novelty, nothing more."
""
""
"Certainly a brewing accomplishment, but just comes across as a bit of a gimmick."
""
"I'm not feeling this . . . A brewing feat maybe. But this doesn't even taste like a good root beer let alone a root beer with an abv% behind it. Glad I got a crack at it though."
""
""
""
"this is not beer... way to sweet... and just not great"
""
"This is a 5 as it tastes like the name suggests."
"This beer is dangerously drinkable, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes exactly like root beer. Was hoping more for a root beer flavored beer...instead it is more accurately called an alcoholic root beer. Wish the carbonation and mouth feel was more like a beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - it's good for what it is, but would I ever want to drink this? Probably not, and even if I did I would not have more than one. In my opinion, it's just ok."
""
"Hard to believe this is actually beer ..., dug it! Bizarre."
""
"O- When I had first heard of the 19.5% version of this, I really wanted to try it because I love root beer.  Now that I've had this version though, I'm not sure if it's something I'm into.  I like to chug my root beer and I can't approach this the same way.  Sipping it is fine but the alcohol throws off my perception of what I'm drinking.  Then there's that cough syrup aftertaste that just bothers me plus there's not as much carbonation as in actual root beer.  Part of the reason I like root beer is for that sharp fizz but there's almost none here.  Fine for what it is, but I wouldn't purchase this again.  Glad I got a chance to try it though."
"It tastes like root beer cool, but then it becomes super cloying and annoying."

"Tastes like Root Beer, but isn't beer.  Great to have a couple times.  The 20% tastes close to the 6%"
""
"Delicious. Tastes exactly like root beer"
""
""
""
"If you like root beer, you're gonna love this.   I love root beer!  Only problem is this thing is sickly sweet.  I could only finish about 1/3 of the bottle.  Even my wife, who is a sugar-a-holic, could only handle a few sips.  Solid offering, but you may wanna break this thing up into three 4 oz pours with friends.  If not for the intense sugar rush, I would have rated this higher."
"This beer is called Not your Fathers Root Beer. So do not expect a beer. Expect the best root beer you have ever tasted but at 5.9%. The beer is hard to taste. But this is awesome."

"Root Beer all the way!!!!! Slight hint of alcohol"
"O - 4.5 - Was surprised just how much I enjoyed this. Definitely something off the normal beaten path. If you enjoy root beer, you'll really enjoy this, drinks like a really high quality root beer soda, such as Jone's Soda or BJ's in-house brewed soda!"
""
""
""
"Damn good beer. This coming from a guy who hates root beer."
""
""
""
"this is by far the best alcoholic root beer I've ever had"

"Tastes like root beer. This is crazy!"

"Literally tastes and looks exactly like rootbeer. Not quite as syrupy as the 10.7% but just as good. Really love this beer, if you like rootbeer, you will like this."
""
"Okay so my rating/review of this is based off of personal opinion of what an ale should be. Not what an ale trying to be something else is. Looks like a carbonated dark brown pop/soda. Very little ale like qualities to the appearance. Smells like a high quality craft root beer. also it tastes like a great root beer, more like a traditional soda pop and not an ale or stout. Beyond that I really don't have much to say about this brew other than that it is a tasty gimmick, not really an ale or stout."
""
"Bottom line is, if you enjoy flavorful, sweet drinks and don't mind getting tipsy, the this beer is the perfect for you.  It is called a dark lager, but it is really just amazing tasting root beer in disguise. Please don't blame me once you are hooked.  Thank you."
""
"Much better on tap.  The bottled version is good, on tap is outstanding.  The bottled version is much sweeter and lacks the carbonation.  I found myself having one bottle at a time, all the stomach could handle."
"O:  Interesting beer.  A bit too sweet for my taste, but glad I tried it.  Maybe I will get the opportunity to try one of the higher ABV versions since this might offset the sweetness somewhat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes really bad and I'd rather not mix beer and root beer ever again."
"tastes bad; would rather just drink beer or root beer"

"It's taken the time for this to get bottled and distributed in order for me to try this particular version.  It pours a clear midnight sienna topped by a finger of relatively short-lived light tan foam.  The nose is a blast of sweet root beer, frankly, with some vanilla and pie spices crackling along.  The taste brings in more of the same, the sweet and spicy nature of root beer shining throughout.  Unlike the higher ABV versions, there isn't even the slightest twinge of booze.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel.  Overall, this is damn tasty.  Straight up."
"O - really surprised how much this tastes like root beer.  Would love to get a hold of the bigger variants of this."

"Overall:  This is pretty tasty. The bourbon barrel is pretty mild, but adds a lot of vanilla notes to this beverage. I dont know if I would consider this a beer though. This is a cool novelty item that I think is pretty well done. 12oz at a time is plenty for me because it is pretty sweet.  Now I would not mind trying the 10% and 19.5% ABV versions of this beer."
"Overall, this smells incredible, but without the high ABV like it's Father and Grandfather (10% & 19.5%) this is just way too sweet to enjoy more than one at a time. Great for a root beer float however."
""
""
""
""
"Good flavor, but slightly too sweet for my taste. Couldn't see drinking more than 1 of these per night."
"O- this is pretty spot on, and a nice option to switch it up, worth a try!"

""
""
""
""
""
""

"This tastes exactly like a root beer should. My wife loved it as a float."
"this is a OK beer if you like root beer, which I do, but a one time novelty beer worth trying"
""
""
"Very good, as everyone else says it tastes just like root beer and cannot even taste the alcohol.  Would give it a 5, but really sweet and hard to have more than 1.  Not a soda fan either though, so take with a grain of salt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not going to spend time trying to get all wordy here. It looks, smells, and tastes exactly like root beer. I actually like this version better than the 10% because it removes the boozy aspect. It's pretty unreal how much this mimics root beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"It is root beer through and through. Taste, smell, look, viscosity. It's delicious and dangerous. Does not feel like I'm consuming alcohol at all!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It tasted just like root beer barrels. Before I knew it the six pack was gone and I was drunk."

"I really couldn't figure out a way to take points away. Not only is it one of my favorite craft root beers out there, there's booze that is almost undetectable. I don't understand the wizardry involved and maybe it's best I leave it a mystery. All I know is I'm now seeking out all variations and can't wait to try this again."
"Got to taste this, and it is the real deal.  I did not taste any alcohol.  Tastes better than A&W.  Dangerously easy drinking.  This beer is a game changer.  I'd pick it up in a heartbeat if it was available in my region."
""
"Poured basically like root beer. Looks and smells like root beer. Tastes like root beer, and a pretty decent root beer at that. Basically, tastes like a good root beer mixed with vodka."

"Not nearly as good as the 10%. While the 10% tastes completely like root beer this version allows for the taste of alcohol to seep through. Not as clean of an after taste."

"so glad it's in 6 packs now but wish they wouldn't have messed with the abv."
