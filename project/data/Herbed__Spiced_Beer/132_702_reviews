"A lovely beer full of flavour, distinct after taste."

""

"I would not recommend this beer.  The feel was assaulting and there was barely a hint of Juniper in it.  I love Rogue and most of the beers I've had from them have been superb.  That being said, you can't win them all and this beer is proof that even Rogue produces duds every once in a while."

"Overall: Not half bad, although like others I'd be hard put to pick out the juniper if I didn't already know about it. A nice balance between hops and malt, in stark contrast to some of the hop-bombs I've had recently, and the juniper adds a nice twist. The rogue in me thanks you."

"Pours a mostly clear gold with average head and decent lacing. Aroma is light, smells between a good pale ale and a light IPA. Don't pick up much of the juniper in the aroma. Taste is of a nice, hoppy pale ale, with a light touch of the juniper, not too much. Overall, I might not know the juniper was in there unless you told me. Overall, though, a good pale ale, balanced well and feeling good on the palate. Light aftertatste, pretty clean finish.."

"I disagree with all the average reviews, this juniper ale was a well-balanced, juniper pine spices were quite noticeable, which went great with the honey malt flavors and the hops at the finish. Worth getting again."

"O: Nothing great about this beer, easy drinker, but was expecting different flavors from the herbal notes but didnt find them."
"Overall: once again an average beer from Rogue for an exhorbitant price. This is the third I've had, and the third that is way over-priced. I would compare this beer (at AU$140+ a case) to Matilda Bay's Fat Yak (at AU$52 a case)."

"Overall - A good pale overall. Nothing mindblowing, but great balance in flavor and mouthfeel and entirely drinkable; quite quaffable."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, lemon zest, juniper berry, floral, grass, honey, biscuit, cracker, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and juniper berry notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange zest, lemon zest, juniper berry, floral, grass, honey, biscuit, cracker, light pine, and floral earthiness. Slight floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, juniper berry, floral, grass, honey, cracker, biscuit, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of hop, malt, and juniper berry flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale. Good balance of hop, malt, and juniper berry flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

" I will definitely have this beer again. It's refreshing and I could easily put back several of these. Would like to try this one on draft."
""
""

"This beer is alright, though not at the same level as other Rogues. Nice to know how a beer with Juniper tastes, which was a more common ingredient in the past. The one I had a while ago seemed fresher with less papaya (this is due in 6 months)."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Just not that impressed with this one. The bitterness is dull and not that pleasant, and there isn't really much flavor."

"O: It is a really enjoyable beer, reminds me of Spring time and has a great drink ability. I absolutely love this beer because it is surprisingly light, the experience I have with Rogue is usually a large big beer taste (which I typically favor). I like the strong fruit flavors from this beer."
""
"Overall: Fruity and light. Not what I was expecting at all out of a winter seasonal brewed with juniper. Reminds me slightly of a witbier."
"A decent new one for me, but can't say it rocked my world."
"Juniper pale ale pours a darker golden color with a small lacing head. There is a dry fruity aroma, with a sharp malt notes. The taste has a sharp and strong malty backbone, with some juniper flavors coming through near the end, finishes dry, which I like. Good flavors, good body, but cheap beer base. Overall its almost a good beer, I like the juniper flavors, but the cheap beer base really hurts this."

"hazy apple juice yellow with a thin large bubble head. smells pretty good, a little bit of crunchy fruit and a bit of grass - that might be the juniper - I'm not sure I would be able to pick out the juniper smell without knowing it was there already. likewise with the taste. i think i got some juniper flavor - but i was looking for it. tastes like a pilsner with a little bit of lawn clipping. i like it and would not turn one down, but as this isn't one of rogue's most common beers there will probably be something I'd prefer if I'm in a place that has it."

"O: A unique American ale with some juniper flavours. Reminds me most of an American IPA with slightly more bittering hops. Love the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"A strange but enjoyable beer with an unusual balance between the berries and the sweet malts that seems to follow it in both the taste and smell. A nice one but perhaps one that could have been a little stronger throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: I have had better beers from Rogue, it was okay but I will not buy this one again."

"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours dull hazy yellow with a thick white head and lots of streaming bubbles. There are some nice bready malt aromas with some floral hop aromas. I also get some of that juniper in the nose. The bready malt provides some nice flavor and there's some sweetness. I get some of that juniper as well, but it's not powerful. I get some of that spiciness that is presumably coming from the juniper, which plays well with all the flavors here.The bready malt provides some nice flavor and there's some sweetness.

The body is medium with strong carbonation. The finish is dry and the drinkability is high. This is a good and refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. Rogue's quality. Recommended"
""
"Pours a sunny yellow/orange hue with decent clarity. The initial 1/2"" head is retained fairly well, with a little bit of lacing clinging to the glass. In the aroma I could pick up sweet maltiness, a spray of citrus and a little bit of the juniper. After a taste, I get sweet bread out of this, and European hop bitterness. The finish comes off as herbal and is where one mostly tastes the juniper. It's very subtle, I wish it was more dominant. This beer is primarily an APA, and there are better ones out there. Still worth a try if you want a dash of something different in the mix."

""
""
""
"O: Quality brew."
""
""
"A very pale and lean APA, more like a lager. Nothing here tastewise that couldn't have come from an overdose of hops, so I'm not sure I get the pine of juniper. Not bad, but not what I expected or wanted. And far more summer than winter."
"Overall in a way I am happy this beer is not skunked since I left it in the backseat of a hot car overnight but its close to it with bitters and pale malts it's just not that great."

"Overall: I’m classifying this in the “it’s a good craft beer to try for craft beer newbies weaning themselves off of Bud Light” category. It’s nothing extraordinary to a seasoned craft palette – it’s got some flavor, but it’s got a slight underlying taste that falls in line with something that tastes similar to a domestic. It’s got better flavor and hoppiness to it though, which shouldn’t come off too strong for a newbie palette. Would definitely be a good lawn-mowing beer on a hot summer day when you need something crisp and refreshing. Good session beer."
""
"O - This is light, refreshing, and very drinkable. This makes a great session beer."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent hue, slight head, and a little lacing. Nose is bready and piney. Piney hop accentuated with a little Italian spice. Dry and bitter. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
"the juniper doesn't really come out as much as it should I don't think in this brew, not nearly as out there as the john john ale, but still a decent pale ale for what it is. hazy brassy colored with a short white head, rather generic, yet still really appealing with a little foam running down the side of my frosted pint glass. slightly fruity nose, slightly astringent, slightly bland. American malted barley and west coast hops in lower dose for the style. the flavor is balanced, but more malty than hoppy I think, a touch of toasted grain bread to it, and the juniper comes in at the end with a fresh pine medicinal vibe. its not out of place really, just sort of a funny addition. I much prefer the john john for juniper, although I didn't love that beer either. bright carbonation and a drinkably medium body, if it wasn't so funny in the stomach id have several. not my favorite thing from rogue, but I certainly appreciate the attempt."
""
""
"O - Beautiful looking beer. Not the freshest example I'm sure. Aroma was modest and the flavor was unusual. Had near the same mouthfeel as a good pale ale. Unique in its own right but I didn't especially enjoy the strange twanginess to the flavor. Worth trying once but not quite worth seeking out again."
""
""
"I don't feel like this is an ideally fresh sample, but I know it has been treated well (refrigerated). The Juniper isn't overwhelming at all, in fact, it seems barely there to me, but it's nice."
""
"This is a good tasting brew. There is nothing really outstanding about any one facet, except that it is all-around enjoyable; a great warm, summer day drink. I would get it again, but wouldn't go searching for it."

"However, even it has a bit more flavor than that, it really just cuts off the tongue really quickly. This helps the drinkability, but not what you expect from a ""Juniper"" Pale Ale. Not a great beer for me."
""
"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its lightness and drinkability. The flavors blend nicely, giving a light and fruity, yet citric and juicy balance throughout. This keeps things lively and drinking easily to the last sip, especially when coupled with the soft feel. The nose was comparatively weak, with adjuncts and corn ringing heavily. This is a nice, refreshing beverage, but we do wish that the fruitiness was just a bit more prominent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, decent carbonation, crisp and clean on the tongue. I was able to detect some juniper elements here, but I was really hoping for some more expressive flavor, especially in the hop profile."
""
""
""
""
"From a bomber, this beer is a clear, pale golden color. Not much of a head. Medium carbonation. The juniper and a little spice is very dominant in the smell...malt, pa,e, with some flowery and resiny scents. Yeast and a little musty earthiness. Semi-sweet and malty...spice follows to the taste, with a bit of to tongue-numbingness. Medium body. Overall quite good."
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably."

""
"Great Pale ale and makes thanks giving a blast."
""
"Poured coppery, clear, obviously fizzy. Thick soapy head that persisted for some time. ARoma - didn't get much there. Very light citrus, no juniper, maybe a little malty. VERY bitter on the taste - not citrus, and no juniper initially. A little sweetness, some malty notes but extremely bitter. Very dry at the finish, and then get some juniper/gin flavor. It was an OK beer to try, but not one I would go out of the way to find."
""
""
""
""
"I wish it were more intoxicating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What is most disappointing about the mouthfeel is that the beer neither tastes like juniper, nor a pale ale. Its just some weird amalgamation of a beer that doesn't know where it is going, where its been or what is inside of it. Ultimately, it is less than average for a pale ale, a Rogue beer, or an herb/spice beer. Pass. I think I like Rogue generally more than the average beeradvocate, but definitely not this one. Hand me a chocolate stout instead please."
""
""
"Overall, this is basically an average American Pale Ale. I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me, but I don't think I will seek it out again in the future. Been there, done that, time to move on."

"Juniper Pale Ale - The bottle says: ""NA"""
""
""
"This is a pretty decent beer. It's a bit malt forward and the juniper berries are faint, but it's easy to drink and enjoyable. I'm not sure I'll buy it again, but I'd never turn it down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a beautiful Bright Golden color with a tight 2 finger head and some decent lacing. The aroma was faint but nice with a hint of spice, hops adn malt all balanced but far from overdone or in your face. Taste was also subtle and that was not what i was expecting. Slight spice from the Juniper, light on th ebitterness but it was there. the malts were very well balanced with the bitterness and slight sweetness. Refreshing and light to medium bodied. Overall I really liked this beer much more than I was expecting."

"Overall: A decent beer, but not quite what I was expecting."

"Bottle poured into a glass"

"O: Drinkable and refreshing, but really not super exciting on the flavor front, especially for something as promising-sounding as a juniper pale. By no means bad, but far off the mark of either my favorite pale ale or herbed/spiced beer."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow gold with a medium slowly dissipating white head. Aroma and Taste is biscuit malt, sweet light berries notes, and some yeast, Some light bitterness in the taste. Palate is a medium body, slightly crisp with moderate carbonation. Finish is a combination of sweet light fruity notes, some yeast, biscuit malt and some hops bitterness for balance, a bit of nutty notes. Overall an average brew, nothing special about this brew."

"T- bland. Not bad, but very bland. Grain, slight yeast taste, malt profile is ok, slight floral hop, slightly herbal. I like juniper berries and love them in the only other beer I've had with them which is Mammoth 395 IPA (one of my favorites specifially because of the juniper), but this beer has none that I can really taste. Pretty disappointing but my expectations keep going lower and lower for Rogue beers. 3"

"O- Rogue sometimes dosent get enuff credit IMO b/c they have been making good beer for a long time. There are not the latest and greatest but everytime I pick one up Im pleased. This is the 2nd or 3rd time I've had this brew and will continue to pick it up as the spring seasons come and go. Its an enjoyable citrus pale ale thats not going to knock your socks off but will satisfy most pale ale lovers taste bubs year in and out."

"O - While the flavours improved as the beer warmed, this beer was not memorable for either the flavour or the scent. I was looking forward to a herbaceous complex flavour or smell, but was left trying to finding it all the way through. While I didn't find the juniper anywhere - I find this easy to drink, but not something I'd reach for."
""
"O - Terrible beer on my palette. It wasn't the quality, just the taste does not suit my liking."

"If it were only available in six packs I'd start reaching for it instead of the other stand by pales."

""
""

"Taste. Not real strongly hopped. Slight touch of grain and sweetness. The finish is rather dry without much flavor except some sweetness."

"Overall, this beer is subtle and balanced. It could have gone wrong in many ways, but it manages to stay on track. At the same time, I wish the Juniper was a bit more pronounced."

"I'm really disappointed in the lack of juniper flavor in this beer, but moreover it's not really that great a pale ale."

"Singer finger white head on a hazy golden with slight crimson hues. Aroma is nice but faint sweet juniper aroma with a slight almost noble hop like aroma. Flavor is mildly hoppy with a subtle nobel hop, musty almost wet sock hop flavor. Light malt. Moderate to high carbonation and light to medium body. A nice beer if u like noble hop tasting beers."
""
"Pours a crystal clear light orange with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a thin film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grains and some slight herbal (juniper?) aromas. Taste is of malt/grains up front with a finish that has hints of herbal flavors. A mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the juniper that is supposedly in this one does not stand out very much."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"What is left, is the base pale ale. And while this base is not bad, it really needs that juniper to make it one I would want to return to it again."

""
""
"Overall, a unique brew that would be worth trying again next season."

"O- A gentle, earthy, plant-like pale ale with some added fruity sweetness and spice. Still had body, mouthfeel was a bit odd, but this could be a great beer for an occasion or food pairing, or even to throw at someone who typically prefers wine or sugary cocktails. Maybe this could act as a gateway beer?"
""
"D: not a bad tasting brew, but not really worth seeking in particular. more on the APA side of that and a herbed beer. like i stated above wouldnt hate more juniper on both the nose and the palate. drinkable for sure, but leaves me longing more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a disappointing effort from Rouge. Plenty of citrus notes (lemon rind, most notably), and of course, juniper. The taste, however, was too dry and left almost nothing on my taste buds on the finish. The mouthfeel was really watery, even for a spiced beer. It is quite refreshing, however, and the smell is pleasant. This is the sort of spiced beer that could have worked on a hot, summer day, except for the juniper, Christmas-tree-like aftertaste. Not bad, but disappointing considering Rouge has put out some great stuff."
""
""
""
"Juniper Pale Ale pours a golden yellow color into my snifter. Only a sliver of an off-white head, which disappears completely within a minute. Average to below average lacing for this brew. The nose is mainly lemon, pineapple, hops and malt. There's an earthy-ness to the nose as well. The taste is fairly underwhelming. I get the hops, but beyond that.... not much. It's also so dry that I can't really get much- the flavors evaporate off your tongue so fast I can't identify them. The earthy/lemon quality is still there in the taste as well. Feel is super thin and way too dry. Overall, this one misses the mark for me. Cheers."
"O: Has a nice bitterness for a Pale Ale. The juniper berries are a nice little touch in the finish. Nothing extraordinary even for a Pale."
""
""
""
"Overall. Nice beer. Good bitter flavours."
"Overall- A good ale but I expected more juniper in this. An easy drinking ale that is sure to please any Rogue fan."
"This brew is a good companion for a Lake Superior whitefish broiled with fresh herbs and lime."
"Although, I would not feel the need to seek it out too frequently."
"(And thus concludes my first beer review on this site!)"
"O: Yeah, this is pathetic. I hate beer that is not tasty. I hate beer even more, that is not even close to it's labels indication."
"In a personal shocker, I can say that I don’t give a Schlitz for Rogue Juniper Pale Ale. It’s about as rogue as John McCain."
"Overall a very nice Pale Ale, light and refreshing with a nice soft hop flavor that worked well with the berries."
"Taste is very hoppy, the juniper berries come through a little on the back end although is seems like the hops slightly overpower everything else. Mouthfeel is pretty good, well balanced. Overall a pretty good brew, but nothing more."
"I would recommend it, at least to try once."
"O - Rogue's juniper pale ale is a pretty good beer. It's an odd beer, but a fairly good beer. I didn't know what to expect from this when I picked up a single 12 oz bottle. The presence of juniper berries are delighting enough for a person to at least try this experience. It's a very odd and unique style of brew, and to me this is what Rogue set out to do. Create a pretty good beer that's unique. That's what they've done with this. Not world class, but it's still pretty good."
"Overall: Pretty good beer overall. Not my favorite Rogue offering, but it's worth a shot."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on August 25, 2011. The pour is an above average golden yellow with long simmering fizzy white head and delicate carbonation bubbles. On the nose there are a few malts, a few hops, and a little grass with a stronger berry element. The body was in the medium range and very comfortable for the style. The taste does embellish the bittersweet berries and they mix with your basic pale ale malt-hop character. Decent enough."
"The taste is a pale ale slight malts up front, biscuit with a slight drying finish. The taste of juniper comes in but it is very light."
"D: Its quite drinkable, but would I actually want another? Well, it's better than a lot of other choices."
"This is an interesting beer, but it's not something I really see myself buying again."
"Overall, very solid brew. It's so subtle, that I'd have to say that if you didn't tell most people it was classified as a spiced beer they'd never know the difference, thinking it was a uniquely hopped pale ale."
"Very drinkable. Though if I hadn't been told up front about the Juniper, I would have assumed it was just the hop variety."
"Serving type: bottle"
"This ale was a great choice for me. If you're looking for something that isnt too heavy and has a really clean finish I highly suggest this choice. I'm not big on the real hoppy stuff, but I do want to taste it. This was perfect for that. Like i said it was had a clean finish, and was very refreshing. The place I was at had alot of taps, and many more I wanted to try, but i couldnt get enough of this one, i had 3 and was completely satisfied just having tasted this one."
"D: Very good drinking pale. Interesting and unique but not overwhelming or a novelty."
"From a 22 oz bottle. Pours a rather cloudy golden color with an orange tinge. Aroma is floral. Strong unmistakable flavor of juniper berries stopping just short of too much. The juniper adds a bitterness much sharper than the 34 IBUs would suggest but this actually makes the beer taste very clean ...almost refrshing. Strong malt presence balances this out nicely."
"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Nice spicy pale ale I could drink all day."
"O: Interesting juniper beer. Well balanced and the addition of the juniper berries makes it an extreme beer."
"Overall - I didn't really know what to expect with this beer but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It drinks like an IPA with a touch of juniper - which adds a nice kick to the the taste. I'd buy this beer again"
"M - Thin body with a juicy, quenching finish (uncharacteristic for an IPA). Good carbonation."
"I doubt if this review will be the highest rating I've given to a Rogue beer, but I'd say this is the most interesting thing I've had from the brewery so far. I'd buy it again."
"Interesting taste, light to medium body with a small hop hit in the middle and then not much else with the hops. A berry bitterness is noticeable throughout the taste and even into the aftertaste, which I have to say is different than I thought it would be. Its bitter like a berry's rind actually, which, never having a juniper berry before, I can only assume is the juniper. Its unique at the very least and I do give it credit for that. Incredibly easy to drink and yet still enjoyable for the complexities of the berries and floral hop combination. The mouthfeel is quick, clean, and dry, lending itself to the style nicely. The hops actually come through more and more throughout the beer, but they never take over. They instead take a seat on the side and let the other flavors do the work, which is a plus for the style. All told, I'm enjoying the easiness and yet thoughfulness in the balance of this one. Didn't know what to expect with this, but I am pleasantly surprised."
"I was so excited to try this beer and it left me completely bummed. The pour was decent with golden colored liquid accompanied by a white head that left some lacing. The smell of the beer really didn't give me any reason to believe there was any juniper in there. The taste was kind of on the typical ale flavor side with not too much else really jumping out at us. The mouthfeel was decent, it was a bit heavier than some ales but not by much. Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer at all. Better luck next time I guess."
"Overall - not a bad brew, but not terribly exciting either."
"There's a little malt in the flavor, which works well with the pine flavors. Overall, a nice summer beer if you're looking for something a little different."
"O - There is nothing life altering about this beer, but it is pretty enjoyable. I may not revisit this soon, but I'll probably purchase this again. It goes go down really, really (I mean really) easy, so for a hot day this might be a good beer to pick up."
"I had been wanting to try this one ever since I saw it at Green's in Atlanta back in March, as I'm a gin lover, and I'm pleased with it. It has a nice taste and it's very easy to drink. I don't think I'll be keeping my fridge stocked with this one, but I'd drink it again and I'm glad I tried it."
"D - The bitterness, maybe astringency, is tingly on the tongue. An easy drinking light pale ale."
"Overall - It's a hot day in NY; and this beer satisfies! Drinkable enough to enjoy when needing a cool refresher and interesting enough to keep me drinking. I think the brothers said it best: a good conversation beer! However, lets be real here, I cannot write it off as the best of anything."
"overall; a tasty beer and a must try for juniper/gin lovers, would go nice with game or as a sauce with game."
"O- This is a pretty solid pale ale with a nice refreshing hop bitterness. Unlike some spiced beers the juniper berries are subtle, but play a nice role."
"A good drinker. Very pleasant."
"Solid ale made to drink at nearly any hour. I've had tastier beer before, yet this beer put me in a good mood during lunchtime."
"A good beer with some nice hop. The glass is ringed from top to bottom with white foam head, meaning it was freshy fresh. Nice"
"O - This was pretty good. I've always passed on it in liquor stores but it was worth a try."
"Pours a Golden Yellow with a Yellowish head. It goes down smooth and tastes like any other IPA. To be honest, after having other beers brewed with Juniper berries (DFH Sah'Tea & GSB Sleigh Ryed) I was expecting the Juniper berries to come through a bit more. It's still really good for a Pale Ale though and I do enjoy it."
"D: very nice pale ale; rogue does a nice job. This is a solid brew. Give it a go, you will be happy. I could drink a 6 pack with ease."
"Drinkability: nice, balanced ale with plenty of complexity but very refreshing and definitely drinkable"
"Herbel bite up front, a little spicy.. sappy and earthy. Grainy malt at the end. Dry finish. Body is light, carbonation is pretty mild."
"12 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV not declared on the bottle. Hazy pale golden colour, big white head. Sweetish aroma of pale malts with strong notes of honey, some fruity hops too. The juniper berries are not dominant. Fairly refreshing flavour, medium sweet, well hopped, the juniper berries are there but not dominant. They should have crushed the juniper berries instead of adding them whole. Okay, but not brilliant."
"Drinkability: Not an outstanding beer, but an interesting and very enjoyable one. This one definitely leans more towards malt as opposed to hops, but it has a very unique character."
"D - Possibly the most drinkable IPA for me. I feel like someone took a Bell's Two-Hearted Ale and dropped a few berries in it and now I'm drinking it. Delicious."
"D - I got a 6 pack and I have had 2. I will probably have another but I am not craving it. It is good, but nothing that I'd make a night of drinking. I am glad I tried it though."
"Sidenote: what the hell is free range coastal water? is that worthy of advertisement?"
"This beer pours a golden color- like straw. Huge white head. You can really smell the juniper- along with herbal hops and a bit of honey. I can taste what I smell- very balanced and mellow with a dry finish. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Yummy beer but the dryness hinders session ability."
"Another good beer by Rogue. Moderate alcohol and no offensive hoppy bite make this a pretty smooth drinking beer."
"Notes: I was kind of expecting a very heavy woody pine sap character but found a well balanced and interesting beer."
"D - Pretty drinkable. The pale ale taste is supplemented by juniper rather than allowing the supporting role to take over."
"Drinkability: A unique and fun-to-drink pale ale. The addition of the juniper gives this beer a nice kick to it that really sets it apart from your typical pale ale. I'd procrastinated in having this beer and am disappointed that I did. Say what you will about Rogue as a whole but this is a solid beer in my book."
"Poured a 2"" head which took awhile but dissipated completely. Hazy straw yellow. Smell of malt. Taste was strong lager with a pretty crisp finish. They say juniper was used in the making and I'd kind of expected hints of gin in it but if the labelled hadn't said juniper I'd have never known."
"My initial pour created just over a finger of off-white head with low retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had an earthy characteristic, less ""floral"" as noted on the bottle and more herbal, if that makes any sense. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a peppery blast of spiciness on the tongue. Finish was as advertised: ""dry [and] spicy"". Mmmm. Let's see how I feel about it after a bomber's worth all to myself, but I would say that this is certainly worth a try, if not something for an occasional drink."
"I could drink this beer all day long but I don't think I'd really want to. I would lilt it to have a bit more flavor and punch to it."
"D: I do not think that this would beer I would drink again. Enjoyed about the whole glass and thats a fine taste for me."
"The mouthfeel is pretty solid though, it's on the lighter side and satisfyingly carbonated. The drinkability is also pretty high, at the very least this still remains somewhat enjoyable and easy to drink. A disappointing beer from Rogue. I can't really call it a bad beer, it just lacks flavors. An amped up formula here would be appreciated."
"Tasty and enjoyable, but sort of pricey for what it is. Nevertheless, definitely worth trying and I'll likely get it again at some point."
"well balanced taste, with just a bit of bitter piney flavor. medium body, smooth carbonation. very easy to drink"
"This beer is lacking almost everywhere. I don't think I'd bother with it again."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a pint glass. The beer pours a cloudy orange-gold color with a sparse, foamy head about half an inch on pour that disappears as I write this. Not sure if I was expecting a nose full of gin smells, but I am pleasantly surprised by the subtle aromas; flowery and a hint of hops. The juniper absolutely comes through on the taste, and actually overpowers any taste of hops. It has a weird dynamic of being flowery and sour at the same time, and that doesn't necessarily blend all that well together. There is also a note of roasted barley somewhere deep down in the taste. The beer is dry and a bit harsh in mouth, with a sour aftertaste. Rough on the finish, this might be a tough bomber to polish off."
"Very bubbly with a great tingling of the citruses. has the dry Berrie feel to it."
"Verdict: Juniper Pale Ale is a cheery little beer, but ultimately pretty forgettable. The aroma was pretty promising, but the flavor ended up being a little too muddled and boring."
"D - Great hop character but the bitterness slows you way down."
"D - It is defiantly a drinkable beer, only disappointment was the lack of juniper flavour. But over all pretty average, wouldn't class this as a spiced beer."
"D and notes - Very sessionable ABV with good balance of flavor. The juniper in this is mostly lost on me. Juniper should be very aromatic, and I really felt like I was searching for it in the flavor. I guess if it's in the name of the beer, I expect it to be more present."
"A solid base beer, kinda like a hoppy Maibock. The juniper is interesting, but not for me. If you like juniper or gin, give this a try."
"D: Very drinkable, just not good. I would never pay money for this again. I had high hopes since I love gin so much, but this is an enormous disappointment. More proof that Rogue is a mediocre, overpriced brewery."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Rogue overcharges for their beer, and for that reason alone, I won't be buying this again anytime soon. It's a decent pale, but I'd rather have Stoudts Pale, Troegs Pale, or Southern Tier Pale and they're all available in my area (and cheaper too)!"
"When you first open it up, it smells of hops and pine trees... reminds me of home. That gives you an idea of how you expect it will taste. Starts with a mild malt flavor then brings the hops to attention. Finishes with the juniper, which sort of hits you in the mouth and lingers for a while. Pours a golden color with some nice head that leaves behind its mark when you drink it. Definitely something unique for the craft beer enthusiast."
"Pours a very clear, very light golden yellow. A nice white head sticks around and to the glass. Smell is a nice blend of biscuity malts and moderate hops. The taste is where things get interesting.. It starts off tasting like a good, mild pale ale but as soon a nice hoppy finish begins the feeling turns much dryer. In turn, the juniper squashes the mellow finish and leaves the beer feeling flat and a little barren. Kind of feels like I chased a decent pale ale with a shot of gin. I don't know what to think about this brew, but it is interesting. It would pair well with some sort of salad.."
"My dream in life is to hook up with my friend Fred Savage and hitchhike to Meth Mountain in Oregon because not only is it a beautiful state, but the beer is divine. My only goal besides shooting meth would be to take the Rogue brewery tour. The Juniper Pale Ale is exquisite reminding me of how much I used to love sipping Hi-C after a hard day of water polo."
"The beer pours a dark yellow color, almost copper, with a white head. The aroma reminds me of grains, and a hint of pine. The taste is sweet, and has a hint of pine to it. Overall it is more sweet and malty. The taste is very interesting, I want to say a biscuit malt flavor to it with some hops, and a hint of pine. Overall its interesting and impressive. The mouthfeel is light, and the carbonation is slightly fizzy. This one is very drinkable!"
" ~ This is a lightly malted and easily drinkable beer. The after-taste leaves a hint to be desired but overall, this is a decent brew."
"D: Nice aroma and flavors. You can slug this one back. I had a several of these at the bar."
"a milder looking pour of orange with a head of about 1 finger. the nose is fantastic though. a nice herbal nose of musk and pine that is something of a hybrid saison and APA. this is quality deterred by the very one dimensional hop character. the herbal note is the only thing that carries the beer with a nice quality of fire ash."
"This beer is gold in color. When it is poured it has your typical white foam head. The beer is flora in aroma from the juinper berries. A balanced, crisp, clean malt flavor. And has a slight spicy flavor and a heavy dose of floral junipers at the end. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable aside from the touch of dryness at the end."
"Decent enough of a brew, while I like it, I won't be rudhing out to buy a six pack of this."
"D- Drinkable beer but not quite what I was expecting or desireing from a beer that highlights the juniper, especially from a brewery know for being strong with flavor."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a hazy gold with a thin, white head. Biscuity malt and a bit of piney hops in the aroma, or is that the juniper. Light to medium bodied. Dry malty finish with a light hop bitterness. I really did not get the juniper at all. Subtle to the point of non existent. Decent base beer however."
"O: Nice beer, will drink again if found again in my hometown."
"No"
"D: The Juniper Pale Ale is a beer that I would gladly drink at any given time, but I don't see myself spending my own money to do so."
"D - An easy drinking beer that could work equally well on a cold day (thanks to spice) or a warmer day (thanks to the lightness and hops). Versatile and tasty, a typically drinkable offering from Rogue."
"Overall, an OK pale. It's pretty bitter, but no real interesting flavors and it's very watery."
"just doesn't seem like it can be called an 'extreme' beer."
"D - Not a bad brew, and fun to try (especially if you like gin), but I expected a little more from Rogue."
"If your afraid of juniper or youy have previous gin nightmares, relax."
"D -- While very easy going down, I just have to ask, juniper? For those unfamiliar, take a whiff of your favorite gin -- that's juniper. This beer is a nice Pale Ale, but I wonder if I got an ""aged"" bottle. For those of you worried about laying some down, the most I can say is that if the juniper faded, at least there's a good Pale behind."
"This is a great example of what extreme beer can be--simple but still extreme. You have a Pale and add juniper berries to it--right there the brewer is thinking outside of the box. Toss the turkey to the dogs, a juicy glazed ham will do the trick for the holiday pairing. If not for the pairing it is at least a good conversation beer."
"D: It's a decent beer. It didn't live up to what I anticipated it to taste like, but it's still a well-crafted beer."
"Anyhow, it makes for an interesting and easy drinking pale ale. Not one that I would go after, but definitely not something I would turn down."
"Poured a hazy dark copper color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate floral hop and small malt aroma. Medium body with a dry texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy spicy bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met."
"D - i found it to have a nice mix of hop bitterness and spicy juniper for a nice take on a pale ale, milder than an IPA, and fairly easy drinking"
"D: This was a nice change of pace. The juniper adds a nice layer of interest that kept me going back to the glass."
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of strong spice (juniper), slight wheat, slight hop, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Herbed/Spiced ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong spice (juniper), slight sweet malt, slight hop, and a hint of yeast. Overall, very strongly spiced, as far as Juniper beer goes, it's the best I've had ... and only."
"Pours a pale golden color with slight haze, modest head, but still some residual lacing. Not all that appetizing. Nose has a mixed citrus aroma, with a faint resemblance of cantaloupe rind. On the palate there's a good dose of malt with mixed tropical fruits, and some edgy bitterness. Nothing much to get excited about."
"DB- The Rogue price is usually pretty good, as with this one. A decently good taste with no real off-flavors. Not a ton of juniper, it is hard to notice. Just a semi-bitter pale ale. Probably wont have again but could session it."
"Overall, I'm super impressed by this beer. I wasn't expecting this to be so good, but it's really a nice balanced beer. I'm thinking of making a beurre blanc or a mussel pan sauce with this to see if the lemon flavor comes out more, and what that minty aspect does also. Great beer! Cheers!"
"I do not like to see this beer described as a spice beer...there's nothing spicy about it. Hopefully, calling it a spice beer isn't a deterent for those who are curious about giving this very tasty beverage a try."
"EDIT: Read the other reviews and I'm seeing discrepancies, especially in regards to the mouthfeel. So I'm guessing I may have gotten a subpar bottle."
"Drinkability: quite a refreshing and quaffable beverage. The overall impression is greater than the sum of its parts."
"D: Big time on a hot summer day."
"Light aroma with a moderate amount of carbonation. Taste was hoppy and fresh, but nothing overtly juniper-like. Very pleasant. Almost reminiscent of an amber such as Mac and Jack's. Very drinkable!"
"Poured a very hazy golden yellow into a pint glass with a thick white head, good retention and lacing. Smell is sweet and malty up front, then earthy and piney hops behind. Taste was similar, bready up front, then piney and spicey in the finish. Well balanced, a bit light body with medium carbonation, but quite good to pair with a meal."
"Very drinkable, doesn't really draw me into it too much, the flavors are all there and everything but not blended too well to impart a great kind of drinkability I find in some other pale ales."
"Given the fact I like ales in general and enjoy chewing on pine needles whenever I get the opportunity, its not too surprising I do like this brew. Despite its drawbacks, definitely worth my time. I do think I'll have another..."
"D: Light and good for a warm spring/summer day (especially the first warm day of spring!) Good, and low enough abv where it doesnt get you going too fast, but really not interesting enough to keep me wanting more. I really doubt I would want another one after the first one. Disappointing in general...I was definitely looking forward to more pine tree in my beer."
"D: I drink a six pack of Sierra Nevada, and I'm feeling like I've eaten a big meal. These pale ales go down easy but leave your tongue wanting it bit more. Just to say it's not too heavy but has a somewhat satisfying taste."
"- Overall this isn't bad... and for a pale, it certainly has a whole world of flavors. Certainly worth a shot if you haven't tried it."
"You can't really smell the juniper on this rogue offering. But they make up for the lack in smell with flavor. The juniper comes out in the finish. Using juniper in brewing an IPA is damn innovative and scores major points for creativity. I usually go for dogfish head 60 when looking for an IPA but this is a step up in my book."
"D- nice crisp refreshing brew. good all around, but i still can't taste the juniper. thinking i might be crazy, i went and grabbed my little can of berries and crushed one between my fingers. side by side smelling the fingers of one hand and tasting this beer with the other... and still nothing. i dig a good martini and i keep these berries cuz i like the flavor with saurkraut so i'd like to think i could percieve the juniper in the beer. but i just can't. i know it's in there i just think it blends in too much with the hops to be noticed. great all-around pale ale though."
"Drinkability: I will pick up a six pack next time I have a chance, but this is a one at a time beer."
"This is fair in the drinkability area. The aftertaste is a little medicinal and if you don't like juniper berries, it's not for you. The hops make it worthwhile."
"Finally, I appreciate the brewers ability to incorporate a respectable amount of alcohol hp into a pretty unassuming package, like a geo metro with a v6."
"D: Not familiar with the Herbed/Spiced Beer style, but certainly not representative of what I'm looking for in a Pale Ale. Mediocre at best."
"Slainte"
"Notes: I reviewed this using the american pale ale as the style guide, with the understanding that the brewers believe that it is a Herbed/Spiced Beer. I don't extremely enjoy Rogue's offerings. But this beer tastes how it should."
"Watery but quite nice. Again, while I accept this is not by any means a world class beer, I quite like it and if it were cheaper I'd drink it quite often I think."
"Mostly clear yellow-orange color with a big full foamy head that stuck around and had decent lacing. Smell is interesting, some citrus hops and a little sour fruit from the berries. Balanced taste, but lacked a little something vs what I was expecting. Mouthfeel is a little watery. Not bad, but lots of other Rogues I like better."
"D: Not liking bitter pale ales without a range of spice flavors, one bottle is more than I really wanted."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a small head. Smell is mild, some berries. Taste is of sour berries with hops, not bad but nothing great. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent but unspectacular beer."
"Kind of golden colored, bubbly. Smells very strongly of berries. Taste begins sweet of a wild berry but finishes with a strong bitter taste that ends in hoppiness. Not a bad beer, I wasn't sure what to expect when I popped the top on this bottle. It would probably go very good with some boneless honey wings. It goes down easy enough to go back for seconds"
"Poured into my samuel smiths pint glass, this beer is a pale hazy gold color with a lot of carbonation. It left a very big creamy head, 3 1/2 fingers that left a lot of lacing. In the nose I get hops the easiest and then some berries and malt. The taste is hops up front followed by malt and berries at the finish. Slightly watery. Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable. I'd definitely recommend this beer, its very good and easy to drink."
"D: The heavy carbonation and bitter aftertaste make it a nice beer to sip, but not something I would want to drink as a session beer. Overall though, I like it quite a bit."
"D: A littler lighter on tongue than would be appreciated, but very smooth and refreshing. Flavor profile doesn't blow one away, rather more concentrated in a few well picked areas."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. This is both my first juniper beer, and my first Rogue ale, and I will definitely be seeking out more Rogue beers"
"Note: perhaps this would work better if you used it to cook with or paired it with a meal that would bring out certain flavors. by itself however, not too enjoyable."
"Tasted like a malty pale ale with an added bitterness from juniper berries. Only had one other Juniper brew and this one ""pales"" in comparison but it is good and glad to have tried it. Medium Carbonation, aftertaste is mainly of bitterness from the Juniper berries. This is a nice brew, but would probably not want to have more than one in a sitting."
"A little like blending gin with a Pale Ale. An interesting blend of hops, not aggressively bitter (certainly not as bitter as my usual preference)but with a pleasant enough muted edge. A little thin on the palatte. I can imagine drinking this beer, poolside, on a hot summer day. I popped a lemon slice into my second glass and it gave the beer a mildly pleasant sour taste like a mixed drink. Not my favorite Rogue (there's no such thing as a bad one)but I'd have another should the occasion arise."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Clear pale amber color. Slight juniper nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is juniper and hops, finish is hoppy and bitter. $1.80 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"D: Not for everyone, distinct gin like flavor (I like gin) especially in the finish, good beer just not a regular of mine."
"Drinkability: The taste gets better as it warms and is only slightly different than most pale ales. Very dry and on the hoppier side I could have two. A sipper."
"This ale is flat looking and tasting. The odd flavor may grow on me (I hope so) but I will never seek it out again. There just doesn't seem to be much to distinguish this. It beats things that don't try very hard, but it's just an off taste. Maybe it will be better very cold. That is how I intend to drink the rest."
"D: This isn't a bad brew to split a six pack with friends, but I think the unusual floral accents might get tiresome after 2 or 3. Something I would drink again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try and find it."
"This could be a session beer for me. Refreshing and the juniper is not at all overpowering. A good, of not basic pale ale."
"Notes: Gimmicky idea for a beer that Rogue seems to do repeatedly. This one did not work for me."
"Juniper Pale Ale pours a pale orange color with a white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit hoppy. The flavor is surprisingly light, I was expecting a more intense hop flavor or for that matter a more intense juniper flavor. It is fairly hoppy, with a good amount of malt in the background. The juniper imparts an evergreen like flavor which is fairly mild (much to my satisfaction, I can't stand gin which juniper is the main flavoring and I was almost dreading this one). Decent, worth a try."
"A quite enjoyable pale ale, the guest star complementing the standard bittering tropes to produce an interesting, and rather drinkable dry beer. And I'm glad that gin never crossed my mind while I made my way through this."
"This brew pours an impressive nice semi see thru amber colour with a good looking sudsy,foamy two finger head which then settles down to a nice tier of foam across the top of the beer,i really like the aroma of this it comes across with a nice clean,crisp,herbal smell very nice,it has a good medium moutheel to it with that clean crisp aroma coming thru on the taste and i also can taste a nice taste of the juniper berries in there aswell but i dont find it overly dominant in the brew just nicely paired and it does finish quite bitter,overall a nice brew that is easy to session on and afterall being a beer by Rogue im not suprised."
"Pours a clean, clear pale golden with some amber and orange highlights and a sudsy, stark white head. Great looking light beer, and leaves spotted rocky lacing in spots on the glass. Has a clean herbal bread and yeast smell with some floral notes, maybe some vinous hints. Very smooth beer that has a very light malt base followed by more herbal quality that cuts through the bitterness as it shows. The juniper is revealed mostly as the grain dissipates. The herbs and hops mix to create a light crisp finish with green grassy flavors lingering. The beer has a light to medium mouthfeel. The herbal and green qualities of this beer creates a very refreshing and delicately flavored pale ale."
"D: Juniper Pale Ale is underrated. It's very easy to drink, and has a great flavor profile. It's definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is good. Thicker than I expected and a long lasting finish that's satisfying."
"Bottom line: Rogue, you make very nice, but not exceptional, beers. Cut your advertising budget, sell these beers for $6 instead of $8."
"D - Very refreshing and smooth, a unique and successful spin on the pale ale style."
"D - This was an odd beer for me...you have to give it up to Rogue for using juniper berries in a beer...there is definitely a spicy, hop-like presence in this beer that makes it likable...but there is something there that makes it unusual for me"
"Yeah, an odd little beer, but a pleasant enough one. It just jolts me in odd directions, so it keeps my interest, while challenging me at the same time."
"Hazy golden with a frothy eggshell head with great retention and plenty of sticky lace left behind on the glass. The smell is piney and citrusy with an herbal quality I'm attributing to the addition of juniper berries. Well balanced flavors of mild citric hops, pine resin and dry cracker like maltiness. Creamy on the palate and medium bodied, finishes dry. An enjoyable pale ale for sure."
"I'm drinking this from a bottle labelled ""Yellow Snow IPA"" which according to the Beer Advocate is an alias for Juniper Pale Ale. It has great head retention. Smells of pine (Juniper i guess) and has a very earthy, grassy hop scent. I'm not a fan of the name but it is good beer. Much better than the stuff i had earlier in a can from Belgium."
"Poured a cloudy, golden yellow with a 3/4"" head that maintained through most of the beer. The aroma was a hoppy one. The taste was lightly citrus with an almost bitter after taste that was odd, maybe the juniper? The feel was light to medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. Whatever the juniper taste was, it was not offensive, not sure what it added though, either."
"D: Interesting brew with the addition of the junipers, but not enough top wow me. Good, but I wouldn't spend the high price to try this again."
"This beer is a little weak in the aroma, but certainly a solid brew, plenty enjoyable and quite sessionable."
"Overall, not something I would session with, but certainly worth a try"
"I suppose it is drinkable. A tasty beer, for sure, but too unbalanced to be thoroughly enjoyable."
"D - This was not a beer I would seek out again, to many other great APA's in the market"
"T&M: Smooth with a crisp malt and mild bitter hop taste. Light juniper berry flavor. Mild fruitiness with malty sweet light carbonation."
"-easy, could go through a lot of those."
"I could drink a lot of this... for a really long time. Thanks for another solid showing, rogue!"
"I enjoyed this beer. The pour, appearance, etc were all standard pale ale offerings, while solid, not outstanding. The incorporation of juniper to this beer is tasty and unique. The flavors work well (if you dig juniper, that is). As I drank this beer I found it to be crisp, refreshing, and full-flavored for a pale ale. I really enjoyed how well Rogue was able to work the juniper into this equation. I was searching for this beer for a while and am glad I found a bomber; I will be buying more of this. Highly recommended."
"I like this a lot, glad I didn't review it the first time I had this, I think that bottle was old. This is a perfect beer for a tornado loaded MS day. I'll have one any other day too though :)"
"D: good for a hot day."
"This is a unique offering from a brewer not afraid to experiment. This one is a success."
"Overall, another solid offering from Rogue. I think next time I fall upon some, I might go with their stronger, fuller bodied offerings for a chnage but wouldn't mind having this one again."
"If you like spiced beers and Rogue, or you want to check out the style more, try this beer. It's not the best in the genre but it's a great sipper or introduction into the style. And if you're a fan of Rogue, why not try it?"
"D: As a gin drinker, I was hoping to experience a lot of the juniper herbalness, but it was absent. The beer still tasted okay, but I don't think it highlighted the juniper at all. Could have just been any pale ale."
"D - I liked this one. As the juniper berries don't overpower the beer, it is pretty balanced brew throughout. It wasn't particularly fascinating, but by no means offensive. I found myself swilling it quite hastily."
"The juniper does not stand out much at all, and being a gin-lover I was rather looking forward to a flavor explosion. However, it's a great pale ale I will return to when I feel like dropping the dough for a bottle."
"Nice drinking beer. I enjoyed it."
"Pours golden with plenty of foam. Nose is of vanilla (or something to do with baking besides yeast), hops, and spice...seems pretty balanced. Just a touch of alcohol. Very crisp, spicy and actually quite light. Understated malt and hop flavor. Juniper is somewhat difficult to detect, although it's in there somewhere. Pretty good, definitely worth a try, but maybe not again any time soon. Not quite as much as I had hoped for especially for someone who likes gin as much as I do."
"D - Very drinkable, refreshing good for 95 degree days like right now."
"4.5 on the soft and muted side, moreso than would expect given the relative dryness. the hops hang back to try and let the juniper take a leading role, but the berry might not be quite up to the challenge. perhaps a little dull at times and i thought now and then could use a touch more carb, but still enjoyed this one. an easy drinker with a slight twist. a certain german character (from the malt), and for some reason i imagine drinking this from a stein at an ancestral family reunion. definitely evoking the old world, an aspect of the brew i am appreciating more and more as i near the end of the bomber. just read that it's 5.3 abv, which leaves me even more impressed."
"D- A pretty good brew here. Not fantastically deep or my favorite from Rogue, but definitely a good session."
"D: Not at all unpleasant, but not enough here to make me crave more."
"Not a bad beer and I'm glad I tried it. If you want some bitterness, it is one beer to go. Not the most bitterness beer but it is bitter!"
"Rogue Juniper Pale Ale is a slightly hazy pale golden ale with a thin white film of a head that has good retention and lacing. It has a bright, fresh, spicy aroma that carries notes of hay, pine, orange peel, dough and, well, juniper. It is medium-light bodied and very smooth. The finish is so clean it seems like it vanishes from the mouth. The juniper isn't carried away at all. It provides a piny flavor that blends with the citrusy hops. This is a well balanced American Pale Ale here."
"Quite impressed with my first Rogue."
"Highly drinkable offering from Rogue. This beer has character to it. While it's not my favorite Rogue, I certainly would drink this one again"
"Drinkability: Good, but not sure about the juniper. If I didn't know I was drinking a juniper pale ale, I probably wouldn't have picked up the sweet/herbal notes. Still not entirely sure I wasn't reaching for it. I won't be revisiting this one, it is simply a decent cream ale, nothing more."
"Lighter color than I expected--yellow and a bit hazy. Head disappears quickly leaving a light ring around the edge. Smell is sweet and slightly alcoholic. Light and sweet with understated hops. The picture of the pine needles on the bottle had led me to expect a piney-hoppy exotic IPA-esque pale ale. This isn't that. It's subtler. Tastes just slightly reminiscent of a wheat beer. The juniper berries (I think that's what I'm tasting) brings a little funk twist. Works well paired with a flavorful meal, though it takes the role of a palate cleanser more than a standout."
"i actually quite like the unique character imparted by the juniper."
"A decent beverage, but nothing that really stands out to set it apart."
"At first I was worried that there wouldn't be enough juniper in this beer, but Rogue manages to use just enough to showcase the ingredient and make it tasty to boot. A very interesting concept and they managed to pull it off. This isn't one I would have regularly, but it would be nice to complement a meal every once in a while. Definitely worth trying."
"D- Pretty drinkable, but the strong grapefruit and juniper might get old after a couple of these. This would be refreshing on a hot summer day though. Recommend giving this a try!"
"Overall: Good mouthfeel, well carbonated and pretty drinkable seeing as how light it was in taste. Not bad, not good."
"For me, this beer is missing something... I can't put my finger on it. I'm glad I tried it, but will opt for the Yellow Snow when it comes to Rogue pale ales."
"When I first tried this beer, I thought that I had made a terrible mistake in buying it. The initial taste was hard to place, but reminded me of mint and medicine. After I let it set for a few minutes I did warm up to the flavor. Not too heavy, but the juniper taste seems to linger for a while (at least I'll guess it's juniper as I'm not sure when or where I last had anything with juniper in it). Light body, had a huge head when I poured it that stuck around for a pretty respectable amount of time. Was an interesting drink, glad I tried it, but no interest in having another."
"Out of a bomber this ""World Champion Pale"" was hazy golden-orange color. The head was two fingers of off-white foam that displayed pretty good retention and very consistent bands of lacing. The aroma was a nice balance of citrus and herbal hops along with a notable spiciness and some sweet malt behind that. The flavors were similar, but nothing I was immediately stunned by. The balance was still excellent, but the hop profile, starting on an herbal note which was also reflecting the juniper they used, quickly gave way to more citrusy hops followed by the pale malt that was a little biscuity. It was, however, also sweet enough to offset the hops. Lightly spicy and rather dry but not too acidic. The finish was pleasantly bitter but not biting. The mouthfeel was smooth and clean, the body medium/full and the carbonation excellent. Very, very sessionable. I've got to be honest, though I could quaff this all night I found it unremarkable. It is nether a great APA nor a great Rogue beer, and the juniper berries were so understated you wouldn't know they were in there. Worth a try? Yes. Worth a repeat? No."
"Easy drinking and pretty enjoyable. Not one of my favorite beers but I can appreciate its character."
"This is a decent pale ale, fairly quenching if perhaps a touch on the sweet side. Goes down easily enough."
"Mouthfeel was zippy and medium bodied. Some slickness after the swallow. Interesting but not one I would really seek out again."
"Pours medium gold with a big two-finger head that sticks around. Big nose with hints of citrus and pine. Hits the tongue hard and stays that way through the finish. Mouthfeel is spot-on. Aggressively hopped and very dry. One of Rogue's better offerings."
"Hazy orange with a tint of green. Off white head. Juniper aroma for sure. Dry and bitter, nice. Effervescent mouthfeel. Kind of washes away, weird. No strong aftertaste, maybe gin though. Good for one bottle to split with a friend. The juniper started to wear on me, a bit too much for me."
"A bit dissapointed, but not terrible."
"Overall - Very good, but not necessary my favorite"
"D-Drinkable? Absolutely, but there are so many other excellent choices, even from within the brewery that I think I'll be reaching for something else next."
"D - An excellent session brew, and quite unique. This is a great beer that I'm glad that I had the chance to enjoy."
"Pours a hazy dark golden yellow with a white head that fades fast with some good lacing throughout. The smell is a usual rogue, with some malt, hop, and spice notes. The taste starts malty with some nice spicy notes, then stays malty throughout with a nice bitter and dry finish. The aftertaste stays somewhat bitter and a little hoppy. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth with a nice balance in flavor. This is an easy drinker, full of flavor that isn't overwhelming and has plenty of great attributes that contribute to a great beer. This beer, like all rogues, is worth drinking. Another great beer from Rogue."
"Highly recommended beer, would love to have it again."
"D-The juniper is subtle enough that it melds enjoyably into the beer's flavor, instead of overwhelming and drowning out the beer character. Overall, a good, not great, brew."
"I tried this beer, because I've been looking at it for a while and I was having some wings and I thought it would be a great pair. I really enjoyed the little juniper bite in there! It was very drinkable and enjoyable. it went well with wings, but not sure what else I'd like it with. This is a beer I'll have once a year in the right situation! Not bad!"
"Drinkability suffers- its tastes good, but I wouldn't want a lot of this at one sitting."
"This is one of Rogue's better beers. I didn't have problems with it. I might go for another one these. A growler of this might be too much for me. A draft pint or a 22 oz bomber bottle should be sufficient."
"One of the measures that our beer club uses is ""would you buy a six pack of it?"" and my answer would be yes..."
"I believe this brew was once called Yellow Snow in 2001/2002 as a Celebration Ale for the Winter Olmpics in Salt Lake and the name was changed after the Olympics..I could be wrong. Either way it was a good beer. Poured a dark yellow out of the bottle almost like a light honey. The head was 3/4 inch and nice white. You could smell the Junipers and the taste was evident. Floral and citrousy. Worth a try for sure."
"Poura a nice dark amber color with a great two finger off white head. Decent lacing. Has a very strong aroma. A lot of berries, malt, hops, pine, and citrus. Has a decent taste but nothing astounding. Almost tastes like its watered down with a hint of malt at the end. Definitely not at the top or even middle of the charts. Has a great aroma but no taste to follow. Easy drinkability but nothing to the mouthfeel."
"Cheers!!!"
"Pours a clear orangy amber with an off-white head. Rich, malty, spicy and slightly hoppy aroma is quite appetizing. Flavor is malty and spicy and surprisingly hoppy, more so than the aroma suggests. Texture is pleasingly smooth."
"D- Very easy to drink, will probably get again when I see it."
"Very carbonated, refreshing mouthfeel with a nice light hop aftertaste. Very drinkable. You can't really go wrong with a Rogue, in my experience."
"Overally, a very good brew to get into the American craft beers. It gives that hoppiness that seems to be what the Americans are all about, but it's not overly harsh. A fantastic Pale Ale that has thus far put most of the Australian efforts to shame from just a glassful of it."
"Drinkability: A surprisingly unenjoyable beer - not much at all going on here. Not that anything was offensive: just very bland. Give it a try if you must, but I likely won't be havin' it again."
"I like it, though it is hard for me to get and I won't likely search it out again."
"Found this ale to be full of promise on the aroma but somewhat disappointing in the taste with the astringency of the hops removing any hope of a rewarding complex and floral taste. Overall an ok beer but for sessionability it is best to followe it with something slightly more balanced."
"This was an easy pint to drink, refreshing and fairly well put together."
"D - Kind of underwhelming. Juniper isn't leaving much of an impression. FWIW a nice drinkable beer though."
"D: Very drinkable, dont know if i would order it again, left me wanting more flavor"
"22 ouncer, pours semi cloudy light amber, lifts a nice looking, loose, light oatmeal head, that then goes to a tiny bubble film and leaves better then average plentiful and fine lace. Leafy hop nose, with a hint of mint. Tasty bready malts up front, then dove tailing with resiny and more minty hop notes. Nice balance and better then moderate interest here. One of the huge line of BA worthy Rogue offerings. I dont get much in the way of the advertised juniper, which would have been nice. Worth a try, but nothing too special."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy golden orange with 2-3 cm of white fluffy head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma of weed more so than hops. Initial flavor is sweet, almost sugar sweet. Flavor changes quickly to a dry, hoppy, bitter, floral flavor that has a long aftertaste. Light to medium body, limited carbonation, light lacing, and slight alcohol presence. Overall, on par with Rogue beers, but one of their weaker beers."
"Interesting brew from Rogue. What else is new? Rogue is typically hit or miss for me. Although this one is somewhere in the middle."
"D: Very drinkable, able to finish the whole bomber with no problem and would gladly go back for more."
"The beer smells a bit like a lager, sweet malt backbones. Pretty much no hops. The beer has a really nice head and dark golden colour. The beer is really fruity and the junipers come out to the end. There is also a bit of bitterness. Pretty balanced beer. Pretty average flavour. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy, and decently drinkable."
"Pours a darker golden. Not quite red. Lots of bubbles and a two finger head. Nice lacing marking ewach sip. The smell definately carries more juniper than the taste, lending a sweeter smell. Taste is expected plae ale flavors, strong hops, grains, and malt. Very light in the mouth feel due to the high carbonation. Easy drinking for a pale ale."
"Good clean beer with big hop flavor."
"Bomber. Pours a hazy orange color with a small fizzy, off-white head. Aroma is mainly hops, pine, and a hint of juniper. Flavor is buttery, but bitter. A light malty, but again mainly hop flavor. Finishes easy, decent beer. Rogue just makes good beer."
"Drinkability is near perfect."
"Ok, it doesn't look like yellow snow. Thought I'd get that out of the way... it's more like a hazy copper-orange color. Aroma is sweet and what I thought was hops. The flavor however is slightly sweet and malty, with a bitter hop bite finishing it off. Very well balanced and smooth."
"D: A nice twist on a pale ale. I prefer darker brews, but for a pale ale, this was a pleasant surprise. The juniper played nicely in the background...well balanced. And I'm not sure you can get much more drinkable...excellent sessionability."
"Drinkability: I probably would only drink one within any drinking span. It certainly is an acquired taste, but one atleast worth trying. Rouge pulls through again."
"Overall this beer isn't great, but it's worth a shot."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, it's a little bit different from your regular pale ale and is a decent lighter beer to drink, but there are several beers I would pick first."
"This was a nice beer which I'll return to on occasion. Not too heavy but with enough taste to make it a great session beer. I just wish they sold it in six packs."
"I enjoyed this with a grilled tuna steak and rice salad w/avacado, tomatoes, etc. The fish made for a nice combo!"
"Rogue always delivers. This brew is fantastic. From the bottle it pours a thick and fairly well lasting head. The bubbles seem to find permanent residence on the sides of the glass. The smell is unusually sweet and malty for a pale ale. Once on the pallet there is a distinct but by no means overwhelming bite. The taste of the brew has coolly strolled into my personal top five. Casually sweet, with remarkably well balanced malts and hops, this beer delivers an easygoing flavor that is just too good to treat with any insouciance. With a mildly dry and equally mildly bitter aftertaste, one can easily relax and enjoy this beer. Pick it up and enjoy with no regrets."
"D - Hop bite in finish keeps it from being super drinkable, but that's Rouge."
"D- drinkable and tasty, nothing outstanding but a solid brew, do try this"
"Very nice and enjoyable. Real quality brew good for something a little bit different than normal, while still mellow enough for the not so serious."
"D - Much better than expected. I would love another."
"Crisp, medium-bodied, and refreshing with excellent carbonation, this pale ale works very nicely."
"Drinkability is good however. A bomber of this stuff goes quickly. My suggestion is to grab at least 2 or 3 of these babies for a great weekend, for you will not be disappointed."
"Poured a hazy amber-orange color with straw yellow highlights around the edges. Two inches worth of foam and lots of lacing down the glass. Looks nearly perfect. Smell is not so great. Smells like a typical pale ale, but not catching much in the way of juniper berries that are reminiscent of gin. Taste is of some sweet barley malts, good hop profile, some piney-ness, hints of spice and juniper, but nothing out of this world. Dry finish, light carbonation, and pretty easy to drink. More carbonation would make this one zing a little more. I like Rogue Ales, but this one I would probably not revisit, as I've had better."
"much different from a ton of other ones."
"Nice balance of bite, smooth, and aftertaste. One of my favorite everyday beers."
"Drinkability - Easily drinkable."
"When I saw ""juniper"" I suppose I was expecting something akin to gin. I know this brew is vastly different than something like gin, but even still I wasn't impressed by the juniper, and I wasn't impressed by this ""pale ale."""
"A really nicely balanced and flavorful beer. I did not know what to expect with the Juniper berriers but it was more of a complimenting element than a featured flavor."
"Drinks pretty good, but nothing special as far as pale ales go"
"D: Average at best drinkability. Worth a try for something new. Good as a single and to try something unique but probably wouldn't need to sample and try again."
"D: Most enjoyable. Easy to drink, very fresh tasting, and definitely something that I would seek out again in the future. Nice."
"A solid beer from Rogue."
"drinkability is good. for the hop oriented BA, this one comes off as a mellow and deceptively smooth brew, with an underlying hop quality that builds upon itself as the tasting goes on. nicely crafted, but nothing special here."
"D: Easy to drink. I just wish that there was more juniper. Rogue brews some big flavors and I was surprised to find this was a bit ordinary."
"This is a smooth drinking, full-bodied beer that goes rounds to a nice finish, and would make an excellent session beer."
"Drinkability: Session strength and body, however, the hops and juniper will likely be fatiguing after more than 2 glasses."
"Smooth, almost creamy, full-bodied Pale Ale. Good hearty Pale that is pretty sessionable."
"Mouthfeel is light, and drinkability is superb. A real nice brew!"
"Notes: I had this brew at David Copperfield's and it was ok,nothing bombastic and nothing to reget over ordering it. I would have it again but not in a hurry to do so."
"Great head. Thought it was maybe overfermented; but could not find a best by date. The carbonation was overflowing out of the 22, but when poured into glasses it had about a one inch head. (as a sidenote; this beer was served at around 8000 ft. elevation and brewed at around sea-level) Nonetheless This was a delicious american pale ale from Rogue. Not quite as much juniper flavor as I had expected though. With the price of beer rising, and this one was five bucks, it was well worth the buy, but only for a try. I will usually buy based on pricepoint and this brewery usually aims just above my line. But always worth a taste of something new and interesting."
"D: A nice pale that does not go over the top with juniper, yet I would only have one at a time."
"D = Only fair drinkability on this one. It is basically a pretty standard APA but with a slightly unpleasant aftertaste of juniper berries. Too bad, I had wanted to like this one."
"Pours mid gold with a big head, this is a beer that reveals its charms with time and a little warming up. The nose is hoppy and slightly piney . The beer at first is a normal APA with the tradmark Rogue yeast taste but after awhile the juniper comes out in the finish as dry and herbal. A nice drinking beer with subtle influence from the juniper"
"D- All on all a note worthy brew. Very interesting and memorable. Not a session beer but one i will enjoy again."
"D: Pretty drinkable, I got through the whole bomber pretty easily, quite interesting, but I wouldn't be able to drink another in one night, just not that level yet. A fine beer, but nothing that I'd keep on hand."
"I haven't had anything from Rogue in a while and this one caught my eye. Pours clear amber in color with an initial big head that hangs around a little bit, and leave some good lacing. The smell is of sweet malts with some hints of lemon zest and some bready aromas. The taste starts of with some light spice followed by an average malt backbone well balanced by hops. I pick up some light juniper flavoring at the end, but if I was not looking for it I wouldnt have picked it up. This could pass as a session beer if it diddnt only come in $5 bombers, some good but not overpowering flavor and a high level of drinkability."
"Drinkability: A worthwhile experiment but not something I would seek out on a regular basis"
"Almost completely clear gold color with a small white head. Smell is very faint. Some sweetness and very light hops. Not sure I'm getting any juniper from the nose.. Taste is pretty balanced for a pale, perhaps bordering on the malty side. Noticeable sweetness and light hop flavors and bitterness towards the finish with an overall lively, crisp mouthfeel. Pretty muted flavor overall, but nice, and very drinkable. I'm not too sure on the flavor of juniper but I didn't get anything that bowled me over and screamed juniper berry. Nice pale ale."
"poured a cloudy gold from a 22oz bottle, not a lot of head. i really expected this beer to be a lot sweeter. bit of pine and fruity smell. taste is good nice hop balance. i could use a bit more hops my self but hey.. it is good. after taste is a bit of bitter hop then nice and malty.... but not too malty. all in all this beer is really good. will buy it again for sure. although would be cool to be able to find it in 6 packs. really very drinkable. i could drink a bunch of these. good job rogue! i like it!"
"This large bottle went down easy. Nothing earth shattering, but very pleasant. A good blend of hop bite and smooth sweetness."
"Just picked up a bottle at the Perfect Pour in Columbia, MD. Pours a nice light amber with some pinkish hues. Had a nice fluffy head that left some good lacing as it dissolved. Has some nice maltiness in the nose, as well as some spicy notes. I was expecting something a bit stronger in that department. Herbal initial taste, followed by a solid bitterness, and then finished with a nice malty back bone. Medium bodied with a nice clean finish. I could see this being a nice session beer, just finding it this one time was a big enough problem."
"Nothing I'm crazy about, but more than willing to drink this again."
"Poured the bomber bottle into my glass and received a dark gold body with a two-finger head that stayed with the beer and left minor lacings. A dry, hoppy smell with some floral aromas and some citrus to it also, but nothing too descript. Not the greatest tasting brew, but it has a fuller citrus flavor from the juniper and there is a nice malt mix to give it a full body. A little too hoppy and dry on the back end makes it a little less smooth than it should be, but it goes down easy. Just a little too dry and not as sweet as I though - just not something I would repeatedly buy."
"D: A delicious pale ale, extremely drinkable as well. Too easy. I'd like more juniper and there's nothing that particularly stands out about this one, but I'd pick it up again. Recommended."
"D-Not my favorite stuff, but this beer is still delightful. A double deuce goes down smoother than most twelvers, and it's enjoyable."
"Thought this would be a try-once bottle but we've had at least a sixer. Very drinkable and not as much juniper considering the name. The pretty hop aromatics are assertive and complex. Would make a great everyday pale ale if it was local. One of my favorite Rogues."
"Poured a clear gold with a pale head. Hop-forward smell, although I missed the juniper here. The taste brought out the juniper for me, but this is a hop-heavy beer. Sharpness in the mouthful and a medium to light body. Overall, this is a nice (the good nice, not the bad ""nice"") choice in terms of drinkability. Different and worth trying"
"D: Easy to drink. Nothing to object to, but there's also no reason to go out of the way to get one."
"D - For hop or gin lovers, this should be pretty easy to put down. I hadn't had this beer for some time and I am a bit disappointed to find that its gin-like character is not as intense as I remember it. Nevertheless, this is an unusual beer that has some good herbal notes and just enough sweetness in the finish to be reminiscent of a gin and tonic."
"A good, but not an above-and-beyond selection from Rogue... their Juniper Pale Ale is a nice rendition of the style and is very crisp, refreshing, light, and satisfying... a good brew for a hot, summer day... Copped a 22 oz bomber from Gary's in Madison... Pours a very light copper color with minimal or no head and some visible carbonation... smell was very faint, not too apparent, and I had expected more from the Juniper berries that were advertised on the logo sticker... taste is light and sweet with a slight Juniper berry essence... somewhat hoppy with a strong floral character... pleasing bread and butter flavor with no bitterness detected at all... vanilla and light-caramel taste with a pleasing and satisfying taste laden with quality... Overall, this is a very good brew and a step above most other Pale Ales out there... Recommended..."
"Pours out an ambercolor with a thin flimsy white head and minimal lace. Has an aroma of oily hops that remind me of melon and sycamore trees. Very good smell. Tastes incredibly well balanced. The sweet foundation of malts stands up very well to the hops that taste exactly like they smell. The beer has a light/medium body that lends well to enjoying this beer through the night. Another solid beer from Rogue."
"D - Very refreshing. A good summer or spring beer. Not so much winter ale."
"Drinkability: Maybe I need to lighten the fudge up, but unless the juniper berries ever decide to drop by, I say just skip this one."
"Bartender served with a head that looked more like lacing. Dark olden in colour, and fairly clear. The Juniper flavour seemed to get lost in the excessive hoppinness early on. Not much malts, and it finished off a little disappointing to be honest. It did look and smell nice, if only the flavour had more resembled its appearance. Interesting, but nothing to write home about."
"As a matter of personal taste I like my herbed / fruit / oddball beers a little over the top. This is a fine pale ale, but grading within the style, it loses points for juniper failure."
"Pours a clear gold with a very nice off white head. Flavor is extremely smooth. Nice crisp juniper edge that carries a nice berry tone. The juniper definitely appears more as time goes on and it warms. Nice feel on the mouth. I think this is a very good beer. Sure it is heavy on the juniper. But Ive never been opposed to having an interesting ingredient in my beer if it provides a unique drinking experience."
"Overall- Just Ok. Decent ale, but is somewhat watery to me. It may be because this was from the tap, but I will definitely give another try to distinguish if this is indeed true."
"Not Rogue's best, thought it was worth trying because I only see it about one month out of every year and it seems to sell out pretty fast, recommended if you are curious but not the best pale out there, average beer that did not do to much for me overall"
"Overall, a solid pale ale that when fresh, would no doubt taste much much better."
"Drinkability- This brew is not too shabby at all. Im not really sure where the juniper berries come into play but something is a bit different about this brew. Another pretty quality brew from Rogue."
"Drinkability is decent with this beer. I'd drink it again if it were offered, but I doubt I'll seek it out."
"A drinkable pale ale, but average. The juniper gimmick doesn't do much for it."
"I think this is just a barely above average beer. I was expecting a harder juniper punch to it but instead I got a very malty and middle of the road beer. I like that the aftertaste is this mix of malt/hops that comes out at exactly the same time, giving it some unique character I've never had before. Really nice snowy head. Really light mouthfeel, like you're drinking less than you really are. I probably won't buy this again but it's worth trying."
"D: Not the worst, just not up to what I expect from Rogue as nothing really stood out or distinguished itself. My macro loving friends thought this was phenomenal"
"Rogue has better stuff out there."
"To me, this starts out like a fine APA but then tries to be something else...something it has no business trying to be and Rogue just misses the mark with this one."
"Not impressed at all. The initial taste is barely detectable sweetness, followed by a metallic hop burn, ending with a spicy juniper berry burst. Not too enjoyable - almost like this ale started out as a good idea, but ended up loaded with probelms. I'm not going to waste another 5 bucks on this one."
"D - Very decent drinkability wise. This is a nice NW pale w/ plenty of hop flavor and the juniper is hinted at also. The balance is very good, I would definitely pick this one up again."
"The beer has a considerable bitterness and a nice sweetness, a bit generic. After reading the back of the bottle I discovered that some of that bitterness may come from the juniper berries. They're noticeable on the aftertaste, a bit spicy. There was a good amount of carbonation. Very smooth and pretty drinkable, would go good with dinner if you happen to make something thats a bit too bland for your tastes."
"A decent pale ale, I only wish the juniper was more pronounced. I felt that it was barely noticable."
"D: An interesting experiment that complements the APA backbone nicely. I like it when brewers do stuff off the beaten track that works. Good job Rogue."
"Drank this on-tap at the Rogue Portland brewpub. Poured a clear, honey yellow with a small, foamy white head. Pretty good retention. I'm not sure what juniper is supposed to smell or taste like, so it's hard to judge the beer. The predominant flavor and aroma is honey actually: a sort of tasty sweet/sour combination. Some herbal elements - is that the juniper? Surprisingly hoppy on the center of the tongue, with a distinctly grainy finish. Appropriate mouthfeel, good carbonation. Overall, easy to drink, just not that amazing."
"i'm not gonna lie, the juniper character is minimal. in fact, i would never have identified a juniper influence. it sure would be nicer if it were more noticeable, as that would make the novelty of the whole thing a little more palatable. i would say there is something i don't recognize, but it's not enough to make the beer great (or particularly good, even)"
"Poured out a nice light tan color, good head, good lacing. It has a great scent and taste, a nice crisp, hoppy aroma and taste with great hints of juniper. Although it's listed as an herbed/spice beer, it reminds me partially of a fruited wheat beer, except it's a great pale ale in place of the wheat beer. It goes down quite easily, I could drink one or two all on my own quite easily."
"The mouthfeel was smooth and buttery. This was really nice to drink. My notes from that evening say ""De-liscious."" It went down quite smoothly with a nice aftertaste."
"Good session beer but Dead Guy is a better choice."
"D- A little disappointing. I will have to get this again when I can be more confident with the age of it. Still a worthwhile beer, but didn't knock my socks off."
"One of my favorite Rogue offerings. Nothing crazy, but a solid, well hopped, easy to drink pale ale. Rogue doesn't really have an IPA they put out regularly but I'd put this as close to an IPA as anything else Rogue offers. A definite buy again."
"A nice treat from Rogue, a little bit of variety. This nice pale ale has a good amber color, with a nice off white head. The smell is citrusy and piney, with some fruity notes that I imagine are the juniper berries. The malt also lends a creaminess and some caramel aromas. The taste offers the same notes as the smell, with more complexity, fruitiness, maltiness, creaminess, caramel, etc. The mouthfeel is medium and fairly full, and the drinkability is very good. This is easily sessionable. Recommended."
"D: This is one of my favorite rogue beers, very drinkable."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. I don't know if it would be something I'd want to drink all the time, but it's a nice change of pace."
"Juniper pours a cloudy light orangish color with a minimal head. The smell is hoppy and aromatic. It tastes spicy and the hops are the powerful ingredient. The mouthfeel lingers quite sometime. My wife said it reminded her of Jubelale from Deschutes. It was the spice added that gave the impression. It is a good refreshment and I will try again to see it a second time."
"For some reason this brew was not as good the first few times I had it. Pours a cloudy pale amber, with a decent pal ale head that sticks to the glass. Aroma is big and malty, with some nice understated hops there as well, like cut grass. Taste is a little thin, remember being a bit hoppier. The hops are there with a citrusy spicy bite, but I was hoping for something more assertive. A solid brew, but I may have to revisit in case this isn't a fresh example."
"d- well-balanced pale ale with nice blending of 4 malts and 2 hops, alcohol is well-hidden, not the most outstanding choice in the pale ale category, I doubt I would have an urge for a repeat tasting"
"This stuff would be great to bring along on any summer outing."
"Who knew that Juniper berries would complement a nice Pale Ale? The beer does not appear to be anything noteworthy -- it has a really pale, yellowly appearance. But appearances aren't everything. This beer has a nice combo of floral and fruity taste character that is truly unique and worth trying. I would not consider this an everyday beer, but this is perfect if you're in the mood for something different."
"Unfortunately, I didn't think this beer really worked. The hop and the juniper seem to have created a perfect storm of astringent bitterness that even a Rogue's blend of malts could not overcome, I'm sad to say. I was disappointed by this one and wished I'd spent my money and sobriety on one of the other delectable brews available that night (like the dry-hopped Brutal Bitter... mmm....)."
"From a 22oz bomber into a pint glass it pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head. Smells of floral hops and slightly piney. tastes nice a hoppy, with a nice malt balance, i not sure if i tasted juniper berries since i dont know what they taste like. mouthfeel was on the lighter side of medium-bodied, and goes down very smooth. this is a pretty good beer, i will most likley buy this one again."
"The feel leaves a film, with a nice coating. A bit creamy and even bubbly. Not bad. All told, it's a well-balanced ale. Dry but a little bitter and a little sweet. Pretty good indeed."
"D: The disparities from my expectation made this interesting and refreshing; in particular, the forbearance shown by Rogue in the level of juniper was an uncharacteristically subtle and excellent decision."
"Strange brew, not unlike other coastal brews except this one showcases Northwest hops that stand up to any lightly heated malt. Interesting ale, may come back to it in a pinch."
"Pours a slightly hazy pale orange with a thin but lasting head. The aroma is a nice blend of citrus hops and juniper with a hint of spice. The taste is very well balanced between earthy citrus hops, sweet malts and robust juniper flavor. The beer is rather crisp and light bodied. This is yet another extremely enjoyable beer from Rogue."
"Another nice brew from Rogue. Blends the juniper in well with an earthy bitterness. Interesting."
"On-tap at the Rogue Alehouse in Portland."
" quickly becomes understood"
"Pours a bright gold orange with a small white head. Aroma is light, sweet, a touch of juniper, a bit of citrusy hops. Big malty flavor. Piney juniper flavor is definitely noticable and rather nice. Some citrusy hops are also prevalent. Medium bodied and well carbonated. This is different, but not all that different. Juniper really goes fairly well as a flavoring in beer. Pretty drinkable stuff."
"D: I expected more from this Rogue beer, and sadly it didn't really deliver. It's a fair beer but it seemed rather bland."
"Nice session beer actually, but I wouldn't go out of my way to sample this one."
"D- Yes please. I'll have another."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. I think it's a tad to sweet to session, but it's fairly drinkable. Carbonation seems very light. Overall, it's okay. Not one of my favorites from Rogue, but it's worth a try."
"Don't drink and review."
"i was pretty dissapointed in this one. being a big gin fan, i was really hoping rogue would put out some kind of gin-like beer explosion but wow did this fall short of expectations. pours a urine like yellow. no real smell, slight juniper but only very very slight. the flavor is smooth and not overpowering. there just isn't much flavor there to work with. maybe with a kicked up juniper flavor this could be really enjoyable, but right now it was just great."
"The moutfeel is dry and a little slick, with mild carbonation. Pretty drinkable, but hardly a juniper beer."
"overall a great craft beer."
"Pours a pale hazy copper with a thin splotchy top. The nose is of honey toffee malt sweetness, tropical fruits, and some hoppy florals. Mellow malt character and ripe fruit start but a bitter astringent hop character moves in that is metallic and then ends with some big pine flavor. As it warms the bitterness lays down and becomes a more apparent juniper spice and toffee malt, spruce, and tart fruit notes get bigger. The finish is dry and bitter with some hop tones and juniper providing a boozy gin effect. Medium high carbonation and an even mouthfeel that is crisp on the edges."
"Taste is much more hoppy than I expected, but piney, resiny hops. Bitter and sour is the name of the game here. It's strange, but even though the flavour is a bit awkward, it reminds me of the Pacific Northwest in a big way. Wet leaves, pine, forest, grass, earth. There is a little bit of clover honey sweetness in the back but the malt presence is light and dosen't really shine through much. Taste mellows as the beer warms but this is definitely a unique one. Not offensive, just different. Mouthfeel is very drying and light bodied. Not a heavy beer but it's a little sticky. Carbonation is a little bit high in my opinion. I'm not sure if more than one of these would be in order, but it's not a dreadful brew. Very unique and worth trying at least once. It reminds me of nature and all the things my Grandfather loves."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow/golden color with a thick head. The smell is strong of hops and a bit floral. The taste is hops bitter and the juniper berries are just detectable enough to add some interest. The mouthfeel is full and fits the beer. This is a nice beer that is refreshing and Id consider quite drinkable. My chef friend suggests drinking this with pastrami."
"D: Gin mixed with beer??? Thank goodness that didn't turn out to be true. Still, wouldn't want to drink more than a bomber of this really."
"Shared this one with 3 others as we tryed numerous beers that night and all of us like this one."
"drinkability: decent"
"D- This beer has a great fresh malt flavor but the bitterness is big and one-dimensional. This is a very nice session beer."
"Very refreshing and well made."
"Decent and easy to drink. Out of the ordinary and worth advocating, not really."
"D - The slightly complex flavors make this out to be better than it is...I felt like there should be more to this beer. Still an enjoyable selection, but I won't be looking for another one anytime soon. More of an APA than anything."
"Excellent, tasty, smooth, super easy drinking beer."
"Appears honey yellow in color with a nice thick head that quickly dissipates into a layer of thin lacing. Smells of sweet bread, some citrusy hops, and a bit of fruit. Taste is yeasty up front followed by some citrus, a hint of the juniper, and then a nice sweet finish. Medium in body and very smooth, moreso when it warms up. Easy to drink, though not something I'd rush out to have again."
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers. This has to be drank slowly for appreciation."
"Flavor is odd. Sweet with the first impression. Then slightly evergreen from the hops. That is quickly followed by a Granny Smith apple flavor and then something else I do not recognize. i imagine that something else is juniper berries. However, I do not believe I have ever had a juniper berry so I am just guessing. Mouthfeel is very light and pleasing. I imagine this would be a great beer after a long, hot day working outside."
"This one doesn't go down too quickly for me, but does get better as I progress through the bomber. Not bad, but I but I don't see myself buying it again."
"Poors a very nice clear golden color, with no head to speak of, no lace, not very impressive to loook at really. Smell is good, piney, hopey, not very strong though. Taste is very nice, smooth, and a great backend to it. Has that nice piney, grassey, hops taste to it. fairly well carbonated, not overally so at all though. This is a great session beer. Could easily put down a few of these without blinking. Its not your drop down, fantastic hop explosion by any means, but a great pale ale. It may not be too impressive on the eyes, or nose, but I would definatly have another."
"Taste is much like the smell, faint, very faint juniper berry and crisp pale malt. Finishes clean, almost no finish or aftertaste. This is drinkable but very disappointing. The juniper is very faint when it could have shown nicely against this malt profile. Barley distinguishable from many light pale ales. Boo."
"A decent pale ale, although I'm a little dissapointed that a beer having the word ""juniper"" in its title is, at least to my taste buds, pretty much completely absent of juniper flavors or aromas. Worth a try, and probably a good sessioning beer."
"I expected a little more tang in this beer than was actually there. Less juniper taste than anticipated, but this is actually just the new name for Yellow Snow Ale, which I have always enjoyed. No recipe changes to speak of just the name alone. The appearance and mouthfeel were both better than average, but nothing to write home about. The aroma actually contained more juniper than the taste which was mild with a very subtle hint of a gin like flavor. Much like gin, I cannot personally tolerate too much due to the acidity. This limited the drinkability score for me, which holds true, as after one or two pints of Yellow Snow I'd usually switch to something else. Those who favor hopped bitterness should really seek out this beer. I just wish they had kept the name."
"Hazy sunset gold. Short, crackling head of loosely packed off-white bubbles of mixed sizes. Slow to settle, eventually falling to a tall collar and a handful of scattered dust. Citrusy floral hop aromas and a touch of sweet malt. Floral citrus hops lead the flavor with a bit of raw bitterness. There is a lingering spiciness in the finish that has a tingly quality about it and is a bit peppery. No obvious signs of juniper berries. The hops are the main flavor contributor. The finish is a bit drying and the hops linger a short while. Medium-light body with nice, tingly carbonation. As a pale ale this was ok, but I could not detect any juniper berries which was the reason I decided to try it in the first place."
"Poured a very hazy yet goldish hue. And the smell is very hoppy and you can really smell juniper, smells a lot like the forest in my honest opinion. Very good hop taste that is very crisp that is really not to overpowering. Juniper tastes very interesting as well. I would say try this at least once but it is definetly not an all the time type thing."
"Drinkable and pleasant, would definitely drink this ""out on the town," but not earth shattering. Also being a fan of gin, I was intrigued when I saw a juniper pale ale. However, I was kind of underwhelmed by the result."
"Mouthfeel is fine, about right for an pale ale, and drinkability is very good."
"Although the taste is not at all bad (actually, almost restrained for being a Rogue product) the mouthfeel really makes this the type of beer than youre happy to have once & be done with it."
"Drinkability - not for me. The metallic bitterness isn't all that appealing."
" Overall it's still an enjoyable beer from Rogue who I enjoy every brew in their lineup to some extent. That being said, I won't be buying this brew again, but I'm also not disappointed either, merely a slightly above average satisfaction."
"This is a really good pale ale with plenty of character. Too bad it is no longer being made."
"D - Drinkable. This is a nice brew from Rogue, but I would consider it a Pale Ale."
"On tap at Brix in Jacksonville Beach. Slightly hazy, yellow orange in color, essentially no head. Aroma was non-existent, salt and lemon? The taste was a lemon hops primary with some malt balance. Juniper was AWOL. Aftertaste was unpleasant. Body was light and the carbonation was medium. Flavor, overall was good but nothing special. Aftertaste hurt my scoring of the flavor. I would not have another."
"Overall, a good to very good pale ale. Worth a try."
"Pours a hazy orangish yellow with a thin layer of white lace. Nose consists of a nice buttery malty aroma, citrus and hops. Taste is dominated by malt that finishes with a bitter hoppiness that is not overpowering. Overall, this is not a bad brew but not a brew I would go out of my way to get again. It kind of grew on me the more I drank it."
"Starting Gravity is listed as only 13 deg Plato, but seems strong, and over the course of 22 ounces, the maltyness began to cloy. Maybe it could be a little more balanced? I wouldnt drink more than one of these bombers in an evening."
"This is a well-balanced brew that I find highly drinkable. The juniper is enough to keep me intrigued the entire glass."
"No two sips were the same, though I liked this beer even more when I stopped trying to deconstruct it and just enjoyed the experience."
"-Oelergud"
"Amber Straw color, I guess you could say saffron. Pours up with a nice distinct head. A decent looking brew. I had expected a vibrant aroma from this one, with the name juniper pale ale and the greenery laden bottle. Instead I get a watery mix of mollases honey and....pennies...metallic in the back with some grains as well. The taste is decent light fruits in the front with some grainy notes and a lot of alchohol in the finish....more than is expected in a sub 6% easy drinking brew. The mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated and not supported with enough body. Overall a drinkable brew...but I can drink better, more affordable bottles from Rouge and other outlets before this one."
"Hop profile is very similar to Dead Guy Ale, with a touch of anise as well as a subtle floral quality. Malt presence is quite prevalent, leading to a nice sweet midbody. Finish is a bit bitter, though with a nice aftertaste."
"I'd be hard pressed to tell you this was made with juniper, which is a contrast to Rogue's otherwise genuine knack for bringing out the best flavors when using adjunctive ingredients (chocolate, chamomile, chipotle peppers). Ultimately, this beer is a total disappointment, just like the last few Rogue's I've had. Definitely not recommended."
"I didn't really notice the Juniper at first, but it became more apparent as I drank more. There's a very malty smell and taste, and the finish stands out as having a very sharp bite. It's good. Very good."
"Sampled as ""Yellow Snow Ale", so I don't know how old this bottle may be. Color is a hazy pale shade of copper. Carbonation is fairly high. Head is average-sized and barely off-white. Aroma is of that sweet earthy malt that I've noticed in quite a few Rogue beers. Not bad, but not too interesting. Taste is similar to the aroma, that ""Rogue"" malt is joined by a zesty hop. Bitterness is relatively high. A hint of something sweet near the finish may be juniper berries. This isn't one of my favorite Rogue beers, it seems plain by their standards, still it's a good drinker that offers a somewhat unique taste."
"Drinkabilty- I really liked it. Nice aftertaste, nice smell, good all around beer."
"This is a beer that I have really enjoyed and would buy again although it is a little on the pricey side. Also I think this is a nice idea for a flavored beer that is subtley flavored and not overpowering and gimmickey. I might throw some juniper berries in my next batch of pale ale I am making and see if I can make something similar to this beer."
"D: I was looking foward to this one, hoping that the juniper would add a unique complexity to the beer. Nope. Lots of better pale ales, and lots of better beers."
"Just like the bottled version, feels good going down and is very drinkable. I wnet back for seconds, and if there hadn't been a Widmer Bros. stand, may have drank this exclusively."
"Nonetheless, it remains a very refreshing brew from Rogue that pairs well with creamy pasta dishes."
"This reminds me a lot of Alba Scotts Pine Ale, except with a little more hops. (more hops than a gruit you say) Ill definitely find a bottle or two of this to take up to the cabin on the 4th."
"Easy drinking, firm summer session ale."
"This is a great beer. Definately will put this on my list of favorites."
"Drinkability: This beer is well done, but I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to get from it either. There are many pale ales that do more for me, and the herbed character wasn't especially impressive."
"A fairly solid pale ale all around, but that extra peppery spice of the juniper on the finish doesn't really do it for me in the end, I'm quite content finishing this bottle but have no huge urge to run out and grab more."
"An overall average beer. It poured into my ,5 l Rastal stange, decent amount of carbonation. Puffy head until I took a sip then diminished into a thin film. It tasted like an I.P.A. There is a slight aftertaste of raw plant. Nothing special about this beer."
"Rogue's Juniper Pale Ale (renamed Yellow Snow Ale) is good variation on a pale ale recipe, solid but nothing spectacular. All the main aspects are in order and I enjoyed drinking this, but for $5.50 per 22-ounce bomber, I expect a bit more than ""above average."""
"I will conceed that the cloudy nature and the relative flatness may be evidence of an old beer. I will attempt to sample another bottle."
"Odd for Rogue to make an under-hopped beer. C'mon guys, where's the West Coast influence? By the way, what the hell is a juniper berry!?"
"Pours a slightly hazy light gold with a smallish creamy head that dissipates in what I'd call an average period of time and leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is disappointing, with some slight hoppiness and a bit of earthiness all that seperates it from a very bland lager. Taste is better though, with a sharp floral bite from the hops at first, followed by a unique bitterness which accompanies the sweet malts, but the two don't quite blend for me. Mouthfeel is crisp at first, but gets muddy as it warms, and drinkability is reasonably good. I sometimes think that Rogue should put a few of their beers in smaller bottles, and this is one of them. Not bad, but not my cup of tea....er, beer."
"Ok, is this note of diacetyl, given how sensitive I am to this particular chemical compound, actually here, or is it just the manifestation of the juniper. Actually I have realized that it is the combination of the diacetyl and the juniper flavors that have mixed. The two actually form a spicy mix that makes the otherwise objectionable diacetyl all that much more bearable, and actually a positive contributor to this beer."
"D - An interesting take on a standard Pale Ale indeed, although this beer seems to have been lumped into the ""spiced/herbed beer"" category. The alcohol content on the lower side is nice, as it helps to keep you on the straight and narrow, should you choose to have more than one. A nice springtime drinker, even if a smidge rough around the edges."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: more than moderate carbonation, medium bodied. I feel that this is more balanced than, but still representative of the american pale. Great american pale ale...I'm really glad I gave it a try...and will probably pick it up again."
"Anyways, poured a dark golden body with a white head about three fingers wide. Leaving lacing around the glass as it was slowly consumed. A faint hopiness and a little sweetness to the nose. Hop bitterness is mellow and doesn't linger too long. I can't quite tell where the juniper is at, but this has a sweet flavor to it. Something I don't associate with Pale Ales. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and a little fuller than most beers of this style. This would make a good session beer. A very easy drinking beer."
"*Note: This beer was very good for a beer brewed roughly 4 years ago. One of the best I have had of the style."
"There is very little balance between the malt and hops. Almost no hop aroma is present. The beer is clean but dull. I guess that I was expecting a more robust beer from Rogue."
"No dates to indicate what, when, where, but I have a feeling it was pretty fresh. All its characteristics were very lively and very jumpy. I am not a huge fan of this style, but I did very much like this beer."
"Mouthfeel- A little sharp on the bitterness and a slight hint of acidty. The malt makes a cameo on the palate. Mostly bitter and citice. A little one sided."
"Good dark yellow color with a solid head with nice lacing left. Smell is much that of a usual pale ale nice crisp sweet malt with pleny of hop tones these being more of a piney and floral variety. The taste doesn't really hold any of the juniper berry qualities too strongly, if I wasn't really looking for it I might have missed it and dismissed it as hops. I would have liked it a little stronger to really display the juniper flavor. It has a good body and it is a very drinkable pale ale, I just wish they would take the bolder step and really go with the juniper."
"This was one I had heard about and never had the opportunity to buy, so when I saw a 1pt.9.6oz. bottle of the Yellow Snow, I had ot go for it. It poured copper-orange with a large white foamy head, which stuck around. It had the aroma of honey and malts, mild hoppiness, virtually nothing else.The taste was the same, lots of sweetness, malts and mild floral hops and yeasts. It was smooth and crisp, but a bomber of this was almost too much to drink by onesself. At the very least it was very interesting, and I once again applaud Rogue for branching out and trying something I hadn't seen before, and haven't seen yet."
"The bottle blurb describes the beer as saffron color and I think that is pretty accurate. Good size head that never completely disappears  leaves some lacing. Sweet bouquet with some honey and a touch of pine underneath. The flavor has a lot of round malt tastes, not as piney as I was expecting (hoping) given the juniper berries, really no gin character. Perhaps slightly underhoped. Still, quite tasty. Mouthfeel is round and soft, with a delicate finish."
"I bought this as Yellow Snow Ale not the Juniper as listed. This beer pours a very cloudy orange with a nice foamy 2 finger head that disappears quickly. The smell is a very strong malt scent,not alot of spices but the malt is huge.Taste wise, malt is the king.This whole beer is about malt.The m/f is light and the flavors are well balanced. This is an unsual beer,but very tasty.I've only seen this once,so if you see it,buy it."
"Smooth malts and strong Earth hops make up the flavor profile, with a light juniper element accent. The hops finish strong and spicy."
"I like this. Fairly unique for a pale ale. This is an easy drinking and tasty beer. I'd like to pair one of these with a gourmet sandwich or salad."
"A clean light amber/orange beer. Has a big foamy white head and some lace. There is a very interesting cereal grain aroma with hints of corn in the background. Not what I expected from ""juniper"". as it warms there is a light floral character in the background. There is a creamy character to the mouthfeel. The flavor is mostly a cereal grain maltiness with a light floral bitterness on the finish."
"Perfectly clear copper with a light white head. Not much aroma really, just some light grassy hops with a hint of sweetness. Lightly sweet flavor with a crisp hop finish. Slightly dry with a medium mouthfeel. Pretty refreshing, just nothing too exciting."
"Pours a golden color with a 1 inch head. The juniper berries are evident in the smell. Juniper again dominates the taste but is not overpowering. The mouthfeel is good. There is a slight hint of hops but not overpowering like most of Rogue's brews. All in all this is not a spectacular beer but has very good drinkabilty and I'll buy it again."
"Hazy light brass color with a good head to go with it. Nose consisted of various items. Orange, lemon, ginger, junipers in the background. Citrus hops and pine hops come out of the woodwork as well. Taste is rather herbal and earthy with orange and spices coming together that work well together. Junipers come out in the finish and last into the aftertaste. I like how the flavors go together in this brew. Mouthfeel was mediumish with good carbonation. Almost seems to be a full bodied beer, but the carbonation sets is straight. Solid beer and perhaps one of Rogue's underrated beers."
"d:a very drinkable...its a nice and easy to drink pale ale...not for the hopped up american drinker i'd say but its def worht a try...right on!!!"
"Slàinte!"
"Pours cloudy amber with a short off-white head. Looks like a pale ale should. Smell: Bright, fresh hops upfront backed up by a mellow malt sweetness. Taste: Nice crackery yeasts upfront, followed by a narrow hop bitterness that rapidly turns citrusy, even juicy; the finish lasts long as and pulls out some piney accents and an even more pronounced malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is clean with enough weight to hold itself down."
"Poured into pilsner. Nice vanilla head with minimal lacing. nice and simple golden color. Smells good and malty with good hops. The taste is nice and buttery, maybe caramel. Lots of carbonation and very drinkable. regular mouthfeel. Overall nice beer, its a rogue what can I say. I recommend it to anyone."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin and prickly. Despite its flaws, it is actually quite a drinkable beer. I probably will not buy more, but I didn't have a problem sucking this down."
"Somewhat hazy gold color, lots of carbonation clearly seen streaming from the bottom. Head is off-white and holds decently enough, leaving bits of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is somewhat musty malts with some light spices thrown in as well. Taste is actually floral hops up-front with some piney & spicy notes..all resting on a dusty malt profile typical of many Rogue beers. The juniper doesn't do anything for me other than try and be a purposeful off-flavor. Very clean finish and smooth all the way down. Not a bad offering from them, and an interesting pale ale, but I've had much better from Rogue."
"650 ml bottle. Rogue's Juniper Pale Ale, aka Yellow Snow Ale, Pours out a hazy amber color with little head. The aroma is sugar, malt, west coast hops, honey, and ginger. Malty flavor, but not as strong as I expected from the aroma. Strong hop flavor, but it doesn't completely overwhelm the malty sweetness. In fact, this beer has good balance. A little bit of a fruity flavor. Perhaps some juniper flavor, but it could be my imagination. Very much a Rogue beer in flavor. Medium mouthfeel. Good drinkability. This is a nice pale ale, as I have come to expect from Rogue."
"The Juniper Pale Ale was a light, slightly transluscent gold/yellow beer in color with a half inch head. There was some streaky lace. It had a nice floral bouquet that lead into a slightly sharp initial taste that led into elements of fruit and evergreen with some malt sweetness. The evergreen and fruit tastes lasted into and throughout a dryish flavorfull finish. I had this beer paired with the gumbo at the Rogue brewery and it pretty much held its own."
"Purchased this for a beer tasting under the title Yellow Snow Ale, which really caused a few bits of laughter with the crowd. Paid only $4.99 for a 500 mL bottle. A bit on the disappointing side for a Rogue brew. Lighter in color and taste, this one never screamed anything too exciting to me. Okay head and carbonation, no real lacing on the glass. Would like to try on tap, however."
"Drinkability  Great pale ale. Solid beer."
"I'd buy it again."
"This beer is light and goes down easy with a dry finish. This is a relaxing beer to drink. With just a 650 ml bottle, I'm disappointed that this is the only I have at the moment. The price ($3.99) is reasonable for such a quality brew."
"Cloudy apricot colored with an orangey white head that dissipates quickly. Faint aroma of ripe apple and vinegar. Flavor is not overly complex, some light malt and piney bitter. Wouldn't know it was juniper if you didn't tell me ahead of time. Mouthfeel is watery, not overly carbonated, but finishes dry and crisp. Some piney citrusy zest, but not overly ambitious. Somewhat bland, but an orange peel bitter lingers in the aftertaste. Seems to be lacking something - juniper."
"Pours solid light coppery color with a finger of head that falls to a nice coat over top. Nose is defintaly APA. Earthy and slightly sweet hop, with a moderate caramel sweetness from the malt. Flavor is a little light. There is a moderate sweet citrusy hop, moderate bitter on the finish with a hint of the juniper flavor right at the end. I'd like a touch more robustness in the flavor. Feel is moderate with a light-moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty nice brew. Nothing really keeps it down, but I would like more flavor boldness."
"Smells like a pale ale should, with some slight smell of spices. Pours a golden and slightly cloudy color with a good amount of head. Oddly it tastes a bit watered down to me at times (perhaps because it is extremely smooth?) but I could be crazy. Ends with a very slight bitter taste. I find it hard to taste the spices that I can smell. I do however taste and smell a bit of honey. I have no idea what Juniper tastes like, but apparently it's in this beer."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"This brew pours a cloudy orang-red color with a small white head. The aroma of juniper and pine with some fruit peaking through. The taste is like a pale ale softened by juniper. It reminds me a lot of Fraoch. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, and medium bodied. Overall, this brew is a nice change of pace."
"Taste is malt and more of the citrus. For me, it's a nice taste that I've enjoyed many times before and I'll have again without a whim. Good pale ale."
"D - I'd have to rate the drinkability at a later time for sake of a newer beer, but not bad even as such."
"The taste of the juniper was fairly subtle, which I guess is a good thing, because I know gin is flavored this way, which I really don't like much (gin I mean). I rated the taste average, because the hops weren't pronounced enough to call this a pale ale, at least not to me."
"The golden yellow colored pour, out of the 22. oz. bomber labeled Yellow Snow Ale, was attractive due to lots of carbonation and a thin but lasting head. The smell was sweet and perfumey, with a hint of wood. The taste was bready and sweetish, with a mineralized buttery flavor typical of English Pale Ales. Hops were earthy and spicy, and the juniper berry taste was not quite evident until the sediment was poured in. At that point a spruce like bitterness crept in, which I presume was due to the herbs used. Mouthfeel was crisp initially, but became much softer and thicker after the yeast pour. A very sessionable beer far superior in complexity to its other Pale Ale brethren that clock in around 5.2% ABV. For some strange reason, not distributed in Georgia."
"Pours a hazy, goldish, orange. Smells of malt and citrusy hops, neither one to excess, creating a nice balance. Tastes of a faint honey sweetness along with a minimal hop bitterness and malt smoothness, with a crisp, tart bite at the finish. Different from other Rogue brews, but good just the same."
"Overall: A decent selection from Rogue, but I was expecting more. Not their strongest brew, but worth a try nonetheless."
"Average mouthfeel and a pleasant drinkability. May try this once more but would most likely go for another Rogue offering."
"Pours a deep golden color. At first smell a nice floral hop aroma, also a nice white head. Super smooth a great balance of malt and hops. Leaves a small trace of hops between each sip. Lacing is minimal, but who cares when the beer is so tasty. A great selection awsome beer."
"I used to drink this when it was called Yellow Snow ale, and I seriously had no idea that it had juniper berries in it because I couldn't taste anything fruity- and that's still the case. Pours a very slightly hazy golden color with practically no head. Aroma is balanced, with some citrusy hop flavors and a good amount of malt showing through. Taste is really balanced too, which makes this a good beer to introduce non-BAs into craft beer. The hops I would say are a little more powerful than the malt, with a lemony taste still on my tongue 10 minutes after finishing, but not over powering hop flavor like Hazed and Infused. An above average pale ale."
"Drinkability- Perfectly fine Pale Ale almost towards an IPA. Nice and fruity and refreshing."
"Not what I was expecting. I think this beer should be simplified a bit and hit a little heavier with the juniper to really allow this unique ingredient to shine. I think that the flavor combinations work against each other and down play the key player in this one."
"Pours a hazy yellowish orange with a thing white head that lingers for a while. Aroma is spruce and grapefruit hops over a big bready maltiness. Taste is a strong pale malt flavor followed by the piney hops and clean berry aftertaste which I'm assuming is the juniper. Medium bodied, very smooth, and just a slight hop oiliness, this is has a good mouthfeel. Not really familiar with juniper, I was apprehensive about this, but it's really just a solid APA with a slight berry taste--very nice."
"Deep yellow in colour, with minimal carbonation. Mellow malty aroma. Good creamy body. Not a whole lot of juniper or gin flavor, just some nice Munich malt, and a sweet honey like taste. A good sweet v. bitter balance too. Not really what I had expected (juniper wise), but still very enjoyable."
"this beer is bangin. its a fine lookin brew, hazy sunset with a big frothy head. smells spicy, citrus up in hurr, a touch herbal, a pinch piney...im hyped. taste? good. very good. big and malty, yes its hopped but not intensly so like some rogues. a bit grainy with an awesome spicy hit. different than your ordinary pale. medium in the mouth, yet fullfilling in all areas. an outstanding beer, beautiful and tastey...my new favourite ""pale ale""."
"Damn nice beer, no surprise, from Roque."
"The beer after its release from the 22-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a translucent golden amber color with a monsterous creamy light tan head that lingers long, leaving a thick and sticky sheet of lace to obscure the glass. Nose has a nice malt sweetness, spicy, grass like, with a slight hint of Juniper, fresh and clean to the senses, start is sweet with a moderate grain profile and the top thin to medium in feel. Finish has a brisk acidity with the hops spicy and pleasing to the palate, quite dry and somewhat bitter aftertaste, a drinkable beer, but not one of Rogues better offerings."
"The body is crisply medium, with small dancing bubbles resulting in a fluffy mouthfeel. The finish is very hoppy and bitter with grapefruit peels and juniper. A decent beer, worth trying. But just a notch below what I am accustomed to from these guys."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twenty-two ounce brown glass bomber with a pop off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Overall: I saw this one in Nashville, and I'd never seen it, so I picked it up. Glad I got to try it, but I won't hit this one again, I don't know if it's the juniper or what, but it's not my favorite."
"Orange-amber color and has a big white head. Head retention is good. Smells big and malty with some hop bitterness. I do not really detect and berries of any kind. Taste balanced. Has a big maltiness followed buy a oily hoppy aftertaste. Great drinkability!"
"A really well crafted brew! Buy it. Too bad its not called yellow snow anymore."
"Pours with a fluffy tan head which settles pretty quickly. The color is a murky deep yellow-orange haze. The nose is nice, a touch of honey, malt.. but the spices, juniper..? very faint. I think if this is going to be a spiced ale it could be alot more forward in that aspect of the profile. Right away the taste reminds me of caramel and citrus fruits, followed by raw honey into a medium bitter finish. The balance, honeyish and citrusy without being overly sweet, goes to its credit in my book. The mouthfeel is interesting. Full, seems almost heavy, coating the mouth, yet it feels alot like soft spring water too. Smooth, soft, somewhat sweet. This is a fairly drinkable pale ale, and the price is also very reasonable."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark gold, almost amber color. Not much head but good lace. The first whiff I got upon opening the bottle was a nice hop floralness. Once in the glass I also got the rich malt aromas and some slight citrus. Flavor is what I consider a standard craft pale ale, slightly carmelized malt followed by a slightly spicy hop flavor. Nothing special, but not macroized (if thats a word) either. A bit watery but that makes it more drinkable to me as I am not a huge hop head. All in all a decent beer but nothing special."
"I appreciate the concept inherent in this herbal beer; however, this ale is less charismatic than most of Rogues other efforts. Juniper Pale Ale (also known as Yellow Snow) is clouded chamomile color with a relaxed sudsy head and broad draping lace. It tastes like a clean and handsome pale ale in a curious juniper dress. An agreeable curiosity and a welcome diversion, but not a standout on Rogues roster."
"This pale ale poured a clear, golden color with off--white foam that settled. The smell was very malty with a very good mix of bitter and floral hops and faint juniper spiciness. The taste was first and foremost a pale ale: pale malt with a nice mild hop bitterness and some fruity hops and floral hops. The juniper was barely noticeable, but was there if you concentrated. There was the faintest taste of alcohol as well. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and low to moderate carbonation feel. This ale was relatively clean overall. This was a rather nice pale ale with a little something extra. Yellow Snow Ale is an odd name for a beer, however, but I see from Rogue's web site that they changed the name to Juniper Pale Ale in Jan. 2005."
"This beer pours a yellowish orange color, decent head, leaving a nice lacing behind. Smell is wonderful, a heavy dose of bread and floral hops. The taste is even better, a nice malty start, followed by a generous amount of spicy hops. In the end there is a slight taste of bread left behind. Mouthfeel is a nice combination of a nicely weighted Pale and is nicely carbonated and lively on the palate. This is a very enjoyable beer, a nice change of pace with the spicy hops and the bready finish. Nice job brewing this one!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange/golden color and a very small, whispy white head. Hoppy, yeasty aroma holds notes of fruit and bread, with a vague spiciness in the background. Palate begins with fruity hops, accented by the juniper berries up front, and becomes a tad bitter towards the back of the mouth. The significant alcohol is evident in the nice and warming finish. Very nice, substantial body makes this a winner. Would rate higher for drinkability if not for the kick. Probably should limit myself to one of these in a session."
"Pours a hazy amber, golden color. I can see that there's good carbonation in this beer. Smell is citrusy and fruity but also bready. I didn't know what style this beer was but I could tell there was some kind of spice put in, later I see it's juniper berries. Taste has a straightforward caramel malt flavor and it's assertive. The middle brings a citrusy flavor along with some yeast notes. Earthyness comes in then a crisp bitter attack hits the palate. This is noticeably a Rogue offering and a good one at that. Well balanced yet each flavor shows itself. Easy drinking with just enough but not too much going on which makes me want more. I could drink a few of these easily. A nice beer to have."
"I had a pint of this on tap at Loco's Deli and Pub where I work as a delivery driver. It was poured with no head, but I assume it has decent head as do other Rogue beers. Smell is of usual pacman yeast and malt. There's a huge caramally maltyness up front in the taste. Spicy, herbal hop finish. Overall flavor leans ever-so-slightly in favor of the malt character. This is a tasty beer. I could have a few of these on tap. Wish there were more Rogue bottles to be had in Alabama."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is nice and light, smooth across the tongue and well carbonated to carry its carefree stature. It strikes me as odd that this is released as a winter seasonal, but then again, something this nice and drinkable might be the perfect choice to liven a cold gray day. Excellent."
"D&N: This would make a great IPA, as an APA, this beer rocks hard. Well done, and I was sad to see the keg die."
"Mouthfeel has a creamy aspect throughout along with good carbonation and body. It's a shame this is only a winter seasonal because I could drink this stuff year round. A couple bottles would make a nice session. Check this one out if you're a pale ale fan!"
"Tastes very good. Hops, malt and juniper berries predomiant. Good head and nice lacing as well. Alcohol is well cloaked. Nice bitter aftertaste. I hope to get my hands on more of Rogue's brews."
"Nice bright yellow colour with very nice off white head and great lacing. Very strong hoppy aroma and a nice fruity taste with a pear aftertaste. A quite hoppy ale, more than I am used to but quite balanced. Would like to have a few more of these to see where they fit in. Good mouthfeel, kinda spicy and pretty drinkable. A nice beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a tightly-packed white head that has good retention and some lace. Smell was a piney malt with a lot of hops, more than most Rogue Ales. Taste was a very refreshing hops up front, with the piney-ness of juniper berries. Very long finish, with some maltiness finally arriving. Very crisp, yet full-bodied. I love this, I could drink this all winter, I had better stock up."
"Pours an amber colour, creamy head and a thin layer of foam that persisted. Floral aroma, hoppy, berries. Hopped up, fruity and dry. Sweet fruit, balanced by a good amount of bitterness. I always like a hopped up pale ale, and this one suited me just fine. Would drink this more often, but a bit pricey around here. Anchor liberty is a better and cheaper alternative."
"I had this on tap at Anam Cara. The color was gold to light brown and cloudy. No head or lace to speak of. The aroma had a fruity character. Both from the hops as well as from something I discovered later (reading Rogues site) was juniper berries. The taste had more of the citrus character along with a tartness that had to come from the berries. The malt is blended well to provide a balance to the rest of the beer. The tartness and flavor lent by the juniper carries through the entire beer. This had a nice light mouth feel and is very drinkable. Once you get used to the addition of the berries, this beer grows on you."
"This is one great Pale Ale with plenty of hop flavor and an incredibly complex malt profile. Excellent stuff."
"Nice beer, I still cant figure out the sourness, but I enjoyed it!"
"Dull copper hue; a decent hop aroma with some freshly squeezed lemon and oranges that graze the nose. Creamy, a quick in yer face blast of citrus hops; fresh fruit, in the way of orange and berries  you try to taste the juniper berries. Massively dry palate; 99.9% rounded mouthfeel; rich and satisfying, very well done."
"Pours a lightly hazed golden color with some amber highlights. Thin white head. Bready, malty aromas, sharp hops and a spicy yeasty aroma. Faint holly bush aroma, likely from the juniper berries. Malty and husky, a light fruitiness and a yeast character that comes across as spicy, mixing well with the light astringency of the hops. Juniper berries show up in the finish, adding a light spruciness and complementing the hops well. Solid APA with some winter-like qualities in the sense of the light presence of juniper berries."
"Somewhat disappointing. This had all the makings of an interesting beer, but all in all is rather pedestrian."
"Saffron colour with no head. A ring of lace settles where the beer sets for a little while. Despite that, no lace at all. Smells of malt, gin, dry hops and cigar leafs. Is tobacco brewed in this beer? Tastes okay. Earthy, tobacco and gin taste mellowed out by a sweet malt character. Mouthfeel is a little too astringent. This was my first beer from Rogue. I was disappointed. It's actually a bit of a bland beer. Personally, I find very little to write about it. Yeah, it was drinkable. But this is one beer I won't be purchasing. Hopefully, my next Rogue experience will be a much more pleasing one."
"Taste is light and malty, and cascade hops are noticeably absent. It's a pleasant dry taste which adds a little more drinkability but at the expense of complexity. Fine beer even if you miss the hint of juniper berries like me, because I really don't know what they taste like."
"Brown 650 mL bottle with freshness date printed on the side of the bottle."
"I could drink this one all the time and never tire of it. It disappeared quicker than I would have liked."
"22oz. bomber with the signature painted label. The pour revealed an interesting clouded golden-orange ale with a nice 1 finger tight fluffy cap and tiny spiraling bubbled carbonation. The nose is a pleasant fragrant hop bouquet..floral, grassy, fruity, with a sweet undertone.( Im reminded of anchor liberty here) Front side is a mellow blast of sweet malts and fruity/floral hops in almost perfect balance...peaches and pine, apricots and sweet dough...wonderful layered tastes...medium bodied, silky with some substantial malts...moderate finish where the creamy-peach-doughy impression gives way to a slow metallic drying with a fruity very drinkable character. I like this better than Anchor Liberty.It would be my standard session ale if it were available here...recommened for those who like a fruit character in an aromatic ale."
"Bender Factor: Solid to style intrepretation. It isn't an IPA, keep that in mind. Solid session brew, almost to drinkable. However, with Saranac readily available (and cheaper), this won't be a regular in my cart. Still, the compexity of the flavor range netted it a 4.5."
"Pours gold, not really yellow, with spicy and toasty hop aroma. Fairly light bodied with some great zesty hop flavors, spread on top of a toasty malt backdrop. The finish is crisp, almost sweet, with residual light spiciness of hops. This is a good lighter pale ale, but I fail to detect the presence of the juniper berries listed as an ingredient on the bottle. This beer should be a little more complex given all the ingredients silk-screened on the side of the bottle. Still a good beer, though."
"Light amber with a white head not much lacing. Aroma is malt with hops citrus dominates but also some earthy floral also nice west coast aroma little subdued though. Flavor is malt with a nice hop flavor citrus flavors coming thru but not overpowering nice earthy lightly bitter finish. Not as hoppy as some pale ales which I like but little sweet with a good hop flavor would be a good cross over beer. I enjoyed it mediumish mouthfeel a nice little ale very drinkable."
"Pleasant pale, hoppy, creamy like an icemaker's beverage. Mild, some watery mouthfeel. Cloudy Yellow appearance. Good floral and spice aroma. Good example of APA. Popular import into Ontario. Interesting dry edge from Juniper berries. Easy drink. Another good balanced brew from Rogue."
"Overall this is a fair pale ale. So far this is my least favorite Rogue Ale. It seems very status quo for a Rogue beer."
"The taste was indicative of APA's and seems to me to be a very good example of the type. The mouthfeel is standard and I'm sure most APA fans would find it highly drinkable. I'll keep my stouts and porters thankyouverymuch."
"Medium to full bodied, just a great and interesting take on the APA."
"From a 22 oz. bomber comes a cloudy copper or bronze beer with a thin white foamy head. The head disappeared a little too quickly for me, however there was a fair amount of lace on the glass. Smells citrusy like lemon zest and oranges, slightly herbal and piney. It says juniper, and juniper can be smelled. Suddenly, I am thinking of Christmas for some reason. Nice malt flavor, which seems to be shallow compared to the hops and spices. The hops seem kind of musty, followed by some slight spicyness, and a hint of what I would again call Christmas Tree flavor. Fair amount of carbonation. Overall, this is an interesting brew. It may be a bit unbalanced if you care about that. Maybe not the most drinkable over a session, but a good beer nevertheless."
"I like this one a lot. One of the most drinkable Rogue ales that I've sampled. Highly recommended."
"It's good stuff, but it could probably be toned down a little bit. It's not too far from being great."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This had been on my to-get list for sometime now and when I saw it I just had to grab it. The name alone is fancy,comically classy enough and I have pasted it up in the past til today and now I realize I shouldn't have done that. I'm rambling...good stuff! Get it, drink it, and enjoy...I did."
"Poured very cloudy and orangey-yellow. Alot of head quickly dissapated into light and fluffy bubbles. Looks similar to natural, unfiltered apple cider. Scents of fruits and perfume. Tastes of hops and pepper, juniper berry -taste of gin... Good flavor. Was kind of worried about trying this one, as it listed styrian hops, and I have noticed that I just plain dislike them -find those beers skunky, but did not notice the styrian in here. I have always enjoyed Rogue, and this one fits right in. Nice drinkability."
"I love Rogue beers. I have come to cherish these beers, especially the Shakesphere Stout and the Mocha Porter. I am a big fan of of Pale Ales, too, and I thought that this offering would be an interesting twist to the somewhat mondane pale Ales I am so often presented with. I am disappointed with this beer, and might try it again only if I see it on tap again. Perhaps I got a bad bottle (?). Anyhow, this will not stop me from loving and trying as many Rogue beers as I possibly can....just maybe this one."
"Juniper Pale Ale is interesting beer, but isn't one that I'll pick up again. I give Rogue credit for trying something different, but this one doesn't rise to the level of some of their other, better known, offerings."
"I could drink three 22s without thinking. Easy."
"I like this one a lot, both the idea of it, and the taste. I nice switch up from a standard pale ale. I really regret not trying this on draft when having the chance. Theres always next time though."
"OK drinkable, but an unbalanced brew. I would pick a Stone Pale Ale or Sam Adams Winter Lager over this."
"The lighter malt profile blends rather uniquely with the solid hops character, making it different and quite good. The sweetness is milder than the hops would lead you to expect, in anticipation of balance, and the surprise is worthwhile. The basic elements are cleverly balanced, and refresh rewardingly, making another a virtual certainty. A fresh departure from so many more complex beers, it's proud of its simplicity, as it should be. And so I'll watch out where those huskies go, because I'll likely want to drink more of that Yellow Snow."
"Ahh...not bad, but not a world-beater. Thank you to my youngest brother for a sample. Rogue makes so many good beers, but this one just doesn't blow my mind the same way the others do."
"A little haze in it's golden color, moderate white head. Smell of juniper berries is very apparent, paired with a nice hops aroma. Taste is spicy and bitter. This is a very unique brew, I split a bomber with a macro drinking buddy of mine, and he didn't have many kind words for it. I thought it was good, and something I would consider getting again."
"Appearance: Golden amber hue with an off white cream colored head leaves behind ample lacing fluffy appearance nice. Aroma: Touch of Juniper berries brings about an herbal tea quality to the flavor along with the pale malts and mild citrus tone hops are light here different from most Rogue products. Taste: Slight sweet spicy golden ale with an herbal hop profile not bad just nothing blowing me away I did enjoy. Mouthfeel: Light medium bodied decent carbonation slightly fluffy texture. Drinkability: Strange unique quality added from the juniper berries can't say I would frequent drinking this beer but it was nice for something different."
"Bottle  Poured a yellow brew with a nice large head with standard retention. Aroma is really sweet with nice touché of hops and malts coming out of my glass. Taste is incredible with the usual sweetness and refreshing taste of a pale ale but with added bonus of juniper berries. I love the taste of gin and I think I find here again but without the strong alcohol content. Another truly great beer from Rogue and one underrated beer in my own opinion."
"Overall, good plus."
"crystal clear orange-tinted golden. frothy white head that dissapates to a minimal collar. small patches of lace on the glass. earthy, herbal aroma...almost cooking-spice like. very crisp and fully carbonated, big herbal malt flavor. quite zesty and dry, finishes sort of raw with a crisp tobacco leaf hop snap. an interesting brew that is easy to drink, though not one of my favorites from rogue. something to have when you want someting different."
"It is surprising that for a winter seasonal, this is one of Rogue's lighter and more drinkable offerings. Also I am not sure why this is classified as an herbed/spiced beer, since the only extra ingredient is juniper berries although juniper berries could be considered to have a somewhat spicy flavor. There is no actual spice in the beer though. A fruit beer, perhaps? Well, not really. This is essentially a light-ish pale ale with an accented hop bite, and a bitter tartness from the juniper berries which are not at all sweet berries, they're used to make gin remember? A light, clear gold, with average head and lacing. The malts are the high point of the beer, and are generally light and biscuity but there is a roastier, almost chocolatey undercurrent that really appeals to me. A very crisp, clean, appealing taste in which no yeast intrudes, the end result being refreshing if maybe a little one-dimensional. The hops close things out with a tweak of bitterness. Aftertaste is dry and a bit metallic, not particularly good. It's that malt that keeps me intrigued though."
"This is definitely whacked out stuff. It's so incredibly bitter that it's endearing, and I challenged myself to another pint. I could stand for a bit more malt, but for some reason balance doesn't seem like an issue with this one. I have no clue what juniper tastes like, but it's definitely piney and real damn bitter in a floral, vegetal way. No one else seemed to think this was especially bitter, and I recall being a bit ""meh"" about the bottle when I had it a couple years ago. The tap version was seriously bitter stuff. Maybe it was dry-berried? If you like punishment that transcends anything a hop can produce, seek this keg out."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick white head. The aroma is good. It boasts of pale ale malts and an array of floral hops. The taste is good as well. It is a light, pale beer with an awesome hop flavor and a dry finish. It says it is brewed with juniper berries, but I don't taste them. It is a good beer nonetheless. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer drinks very well. I've never had a bad beer from these guys. It didn't know what to expect with this only because of the name, but I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks Quaffer for helping me reel in my ""white whale."""
"One of my favorite Rogue bottles thus far. Pours a medium straw yellow with a puffy off-white head. Smells of light, macro-ish malt, with palpable un-macroish floral and citrusy hop notes. Taste is light, crisp, smooth malts with a touch of fruitiness. Hops are the main event here; very grapefruit-citrusy in flavor, but not too bitter. Finish is a touch oily, bitter, and thirst-quenching. I'd rather drink this in the summer than in the winter. Reminds me a little of New Belgium's Loft (but I like the Loft more)."
"Poured a hazy orange-yellow with a sizable white head that dissipated over time. The aroma was light, fresh, and sweet. Tasting it caught me by surprise, as the light aroma indicated that it would be a delicate mouthfeel. Not so -- it was firm and almost 'chunky'. The aftertaste was bitter and effervescent, while the flavor was almost sugary. Its a fairly easy drinking brew -- for something called 'Yellow Snow' it really seemed more appropriate for a summers day. Good, but not great, I'd buy it, order it, and drink it -- but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Drinkability/Notes: Kind of your run of the mill pale ale. Nothing to get too excited about, just a good drink. Reminds me of a not quite as powerful Anchor Liberty Ale."
"I'll have to revisit it at some time I suppose, see what I think later on."
"Just above average, I was kind of exspecting more. Nice yellowish amber color with a lacey head. It is kinda ""flat"" however. Subtle hops, just barely there. Nothing really jumps out at you, except the name. I would drink this again, but I won't go out of my way to find it."
"The nose is good and gives note of the hops and the nice malt base. Flavors tend toward citrus fruit notes though the lighting spicing sharpen the edge and give this brew some nice tight tartness. The feel is smooth but has nice crispness in the ending. Eminently drinkable and refreshing."
"Pours a colour of saffron infused beer. I almost wanted to make risotto milanese with this at first glance. Smelled of hops with a definate piney hoppy smell. Taste was Hoppy with a hint of gin like spice from the juniper berries. Fortunately the jumiper didnt overwhelm as I find Gin disgusting. It was more of the subtle juniper used in german or czech recipes. Mouthfeel was a bit sticky due to the hops but good none the less. I found this beer VERY drinkable and another great offering from Rogue. I wish it were around more of the year."
"A very odd ale, but enjoyable. I'll have to try this again -- but probably not for a while."
"Pours a golden orange color with a thick creamy head. The head lasted through most of the drink, and glass lacing was produced. The aroma is of malt and honey tones. The malt flavor is quite smooth, and some bitterness and spiciness arrived on the tongue after swallowing. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp, and I noticed the bitterness from the hops sticks to the back of your tongue well after swallowing. Enjoyable and drinkable, even though the name of this one gets you thinking..."
"This one poured with a medium frothy head and left frothy lacing. It was yellow with a tinge of orange. It tasted mildly hoppy with some subtle spicyness perhaps? Mouthfeel was a little thin and lacked excitement. A decent beer but is missing the oomph and vibrancy I enjoy."
"A light yellow pour with a good size head. It had a semi floral smell, nothing spectacular. I didn't care much for the taste I was upset with the lack of balance that rogue usually exceeds in. I like hoppy, but this was too much."
"Pours foggy yellow orange with quite a bit of head that recedes fairly quickly. Citrucy aroma that fades fairly quickly. Taste? Uhhmm... its bitter. A bit grainy and bready in the end before more bitterness puts a stop to all that. Mouthfeel is a bit weak, but not too bad."
"Pours a clear light orange with e decent white head, resembling your average american lager in appearance. Aroma is heavy on the grainy side, with a good dose floral hops backing things up. Taste is nothing special here. Mostly bitter from start to finish, there is some grainyness in the background. Not really malty, just a slight taste of cereal grains. This beer could use some balance. Mostly floral bitter hops, not much else besides a funky aftertaste. Mouthfeel is fairly clean but nothing special. Too bitter without enough flavor to be very drinkable. Nothing special here - your average rogue ale, only not as good. Don't drink the yellow snow either."
"Now off to see if that whole violets thing is true."
"Slightly thinner bodied than I had hoped, however this would make a good ""left-field"" session beer just because it's a unique concoction."
"A most drinkable beer..at any time of the year."
"Drinking this beautifully balanced beer is an intense experience. I can see the hops on the trellis. I can taste the grain. At the end I enjoy the pretty cascade of lacing, and look forward to picking up some more of these."
"Well, I was told not to eat yellow snow, but noone said anything about not drinking it. Poured a bright orange color with a decent white head atop - looks sticky and has retained at a film. Aroma is very floral, full of hops much like an IPA. The taste is as delicious as expected. Begins with a bitter hop taste, hints of roastyness, and a sweet 'n' spicy finish, dry like the bottle says it is. As we come into winter, this was a great beer to break up the monotony and also a nice break from many of the dark and heavy seasonals."
"Highly recommended."
"An orange pour with a medium white head. The smell nicely hoppy and had a mellow fruit sweetness....berries and maybe some apricot as well. The taste had a decent combintaion of hops and fruitiness giving it nice balance. Fruitiness is present up front and then becomes more dry, malty towards the finish. Smooth mouthfeel with a semidry finish. Decent drinkability. Not one of my faves."
"Drinkability: A good, easy-drinking offering from Rogue. Juniper berries offer an interesting twist. Try this one if you can."
"ng"
"Appearance is a typical yellow-amber color.Head dissipation is also typical.Hops are immediately present in the aroma although I didn't pick up on the junipers and spice all that much.That's good that they weren't overwhelming.Light and a bit watery mouthfeel and I would consider it highly drinkable.I actually think this beer could pass as a lager.I've had this in a bottle as well, but on tap is the way to go."
"Even though it is not as ""big"" as many other Rogue brews, Yellow Snow is still quite good. This is a beer to give someone you are trying to bring into the Rogue Nation."
"Seems to pour more of an orange color than a urine color but what the hell,with a decenthead that left a light lacing on my pint glass,definent Northwestern ale smell of zesty hops.Taste does have a nice malt firmness to it with a slight juniper taste finishing with a hop atttack wich kinda brings this beer together.Apretty good beer but Rogue makes better."
"Good effort."
"Even so, the Juniper backing gives this particular beer a bit of a subtle spicy edge which other beers might do well to emulate. A great example of how one or two unusual ingredients can add considerably to a beer!"
"not one of rogue's best, yet still a relatively good brew. pours a light amber/orange colour that is slighly hazy, but has a nice frothy/chunky head to it. i was quite surprised to see this from this type of beer. the smell is hoppy and a bit citrusy, with a sweet berry-ness dominating. the taste echoes the smell, the the hops are more balanced with the sweetness than in the smell. an easy drinking brew that i'd certainly try again, but would rather just about any other rogue beverage that i've tried thusfar over this one."
"22 bomber. Cloudy golden to dull orange color. Nice dense white bubbly head. Tiny bubbles. What ? Nice inviting smell of fresh hop leaves. Cascades. Not sure what a juniper even smells or tastes like. But this had a fresh crisp, snap to the flavor. Slight fizzyness dulls the flavors. But the citrus snap comes back, lots of hops, and earthy spiciness to it. Medium bodied, nicely carbonated. Really cleanses the palate, and leaves you dry and puckering, waiting for more. Another quality product from Rogue. I had this right at the beginning of my beer advocating life and was intimidated by it. It's really very good and well worth trying."
"Impressive."
"22oz. Bomber.Hazy honey color with standard Rogue fluffly head. Good lacing. Aroma is of hops, juniper and pacman yeast.(gotta love that pacman). Medium bodied and smooth. A tad bitter and a slight watery taste. Maybe the least favorite I've had from Rogue. Nothing like any APA's I've had yet every Rogue is a new adventure."
"Medium gold color, medium head. A medium bodied pale ale. Smooth malts and spicy hops are nicely balanced. Brewed with whole Juniper berries. They give the beer a nice spicy finish. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly spicy and very slightly bitter. Painted/etched beer bottle."
"According to the bottle, this came from the 2002 batch, so it may have been sitting on a shelf for too long, explaining the bit of funkiness. I'll certainly give it another chance."
"Overall Impression: Regardless of advice you have received in the past; don’t pass up this yellow snow. The juniper berries on the label concerned me, I can’t stand Gin, but I didn’t note any gin-like tastes here. Like all Rogue products, this is very well made, and a tongue pleaser. Drinkability, hmm, thinking this isn’t for everyone, but I enjoyed it. The taste is very drinkable, but the aftertaste and the firm alcohol level (guessing around 6%) will probably slow you down. If you’re a hophead, scoop up some yellow snow."
"(22 oz.)"
"Mouthfeel is good. There is an oily quality to it that is a little unpleaseant. It drinks well with a dry finish. Finish lasts a bit too long. This is a very nice ale. It has some flaws but the good points more than make up for them."
"While poured from tap, the color of it was a dark golden with medium foam and no lace. The smell of this ale had a floral/herbal and spicy aroma that really wasn't that good. The taste was of a hoppy, spicy/herbal, floral flavor that just didn't move me. It did nothing for me, because the spicy/herbal flavor of this ale just wasn't what I was expecting to taste!"
"This 2002 brew poured a small head of small bubbles. It had a transparent light amber colored body with carbonation rising in the mug. It has a floral aroma and a very tart initial taste that was overcome by and even stronger bitter/tart finish that left behind some spicy elements."
"22 oz bottle. Poured a dark golden color, with a moderate head that slowly receded, leaving some fine lacing on the glass. Aroma is hops and some malt. Taste is hoppy with some malt sweetness. Good carbonation, and a fairly strong mouthfeel from the hops. All in all not a bad beer, but not something I'd go out of my way for."
"22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a clear amber color with 2 fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell has a spicy citrus aroma with a good hops nose also. Just a little too faint. The taste is spicy at first, you really notice the saffron in there. The strong hops help balance it out. The mouthfeel is fairly strong, and the smoothness gives it a nice drinkability. Nice to enjoy while just relaxing."
"22 oz. bomber. Pours a clouded honey golden color with an off-white head. Aroma consists of spicy hops, malt and hint of fruitiness. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, creamy and smooth. Taste has a nice caramel malt backbone. Hops are spicy, yet not overwhelming. Use of juniper berries adds a uniquely subtle pine flavor to the beer. Great tasting all-around. Some of the flavor aspects (mainly the hops, but on a lesser intesity) of Yellow Snow sort of reminded me of Rogue's Santa's Private Reserve. Definitely enjoyable and worth a try."
"Dryness and bitterness are a little much and restrain me from giving this amazing beer a higher mouthfeel and drinkability dispite the amazing flavor."
"Poured with  tiny bubbles......pretty orange/gold color, white head, and nice lace. Signature Rogue hoppiness but this one has some floral spicy kick to it as well. The hops are well balanced with a nice malt flavor. Very drinkable  I could knock back many of these."
"Clear golden color with a creamy off-white head. Leaves a good amount of lacing when sipped down. Definitely not the color of yellow snow. The aroma is fruity, grainy, and bready. The flavor is of sweet malt, bread, and spice. It is a light-medium bodied beer, smooth and tasty. Not a bad brew."
"Bottled in 2002. This brew poured a very small head. It had good lacing on the side of my mug. It poured a good amber color. In my opinion it had a fruity and citrusy aroma. It was bitter tasting and it left a lingering aftertaste. Not a brew high on my list."
"This beer poured a dark golden color and formed a small bubbly head that left trace lace. An aroma of malt, caramel and floral hops with a touch of citrus. A flavor of malt, caramel and spices. The finish has a tangy aspect to it. Also some elements of wood that lend just a touch of astrigency to it."
"This beer first poured into the glass a clear well carbonated golden straw color, but with each pour it became progressively cloudy. The head was white in color with a fairly decent head semi-dense and creamy. It left no lace behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of malt, a slight burnt sugar, faint milk chocolate, spicy and floral hops, juniper berries, caramel and earth tones. The tastes that rolled across the tongue and to the back of the throat were of sweet malts, juniper berries, floral hops (which seemed dominate) yeast, pine trees and some herb tones through out. Some hoppy aftertastes were present. Medium body made this beer pleasant and not overbearing. The flavors seemed to become more pronounced as it warmed. I wasn’t sure if this beer would be my cup of tea, but after tasting it I discovered that it is. I rather liked it. Another good beer from Rogue."
"Overall, this was a decent brew. I wish it was a little more balanced and had a cleaner, drier finish to it, though."
"A very well-balanced and intriguing beer. Clean, crisp and highly quaffable. Well worth a try, though some may not understand its restrained complexities."
"The flavor is very welcoming and interesting. It is sweet with nice malts and fruits at the start. As is slides down, it starts to get bitter and spicy from the hops. I guess that the juniper berries have something to do with that also, but I am really not familiar with juniper berries, so I can't really say for sure. It is very crisp and refreshing. I would imagine it to be a great warm weather drinker, but I am enjoying it just as much after walking through knee deep snow. Maybe I will go make some yellow to honor this fine brew from Rogue."
"Pours a brilliant burnt orange color that is hazed a bit and produced a modest white head that dissipates to a light layer covering the beer like a blanket. It has a very, very faint aroma with nearly no discernable aromas. This is a very unique characteristic, or lack there of from an awesome brewery. The taste reveals lightly sweet malt with a well-pronounced hop. It is light bodied and finishes with a slightly dry bitter. Not a great representation of the style, but it could be a great crossover beer to get a macro drinker familiar with hops without shocking their taste buds. Cheers!"
"The smell is an amalgam of candy-like caramel malt, herbal hops, and some pungent pine which is distinctive and quite different from the piney character of PNW hops. The taste is of spicy and herbal hops which are accentuated by the green piney flavor of juniper. Some light crystal malt comes up in mid palate, peeks in the window, sees all the hops and juniper having a party, and decides it's in the wrong neighborhood. The mouthfeel is light yet a bit creamy. The finish is sharply bitter which I personally enjoy, but I could see where this would turn off others. A tasty brew, imo, but not something I'd want all the time."
"My first sample from Rogue. I expected more but I'm not a big fan of herb/spice beers. I'll try a stout or pale ale and see how that goes."
"This seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it beer. I place myself squarely in the former category. Crystal clear, and golden in color, this beer sports the typical huge Rogue pillowy head, and leaves a nice lace down the side. The aroma is of floral hops and a bit spicy. Flavor starts off with a smooth malty body which soon develops a pleasant fruitiness from the juniper berries. Slightly acidic with a bit of a hop bite at the end, but a bit of honey sweetness kicks in to make this an incredibly well-balanced beer. Crisp and well-carbonated, but with just enough complexity to make this a great session beer for genuine beer lovers."
"Pours a cloudy deep orange gold. The white head dissapeared almost as quickly as I poured it. Aroma is musty and and slightly fruity, with very reserved scents of biscuity malt and herbal hops. Flavor is quite bold, especially considering how subdued the aroma is. Beginning with slightly sweet toasted malt, then becoming quite spicy and a little bit fruity, finishing quite bitter with some notes of Gin... obviously the juniper berries at work. Has a medium body and a slightly rough mouthfeel. A very interesting brew that is pretty drinkable."
"Poured from a brown 22oz. bottle labeled 2002. Slightly hazed brownish gold in color with a small amount of white head. Aroma comprised mainly of citrusy hops, but malt is also detected. Yellow Snow has a good tasting, smooth malt backbone. Well hopped, but not nearly as aggresively as I had anticipated. Citrusy, floral hop flavor barely edges out the malt. Taste almost seems to bounce back and forth between the malt and the hops. This balance of flavor keeps it interesting. Good mouthfeel and drinkability. Overall, a very good beer, but not as bold as many other Rogue offerings."
"It is a golden orange color with a thin white head and minimal lacing. The smell was fruit and hops, with a bit of a doughy smell. The flavor packed some spice, but nothing overwhelming like some other spiced varieties. The hops provided the most flavor in my book- making this beer seem pretty traditional to me. A solid brew."
"Pours a hazy bright orange amber color with a creamy white head. Nose is floral hops, spices, and is a bit herbal. Taste is crisp and refreshing and is a bit slick in the mouth with notes of fruit, juniper berries, and sweet bready malts with a strong oily and bitter hop finish. This is a pretty good beer, though the bitter hops seem to overpower the other flavors."
"22oz 2002 bottle.Hazy dark yellow-golden color, small white head, floral hop aroma, nice balanced bready flavor, dry hoppy finish, can really taste the juniper berries in a dry sticky aftertaste, medium body, not a bad brew, yet lighter than I had hoped, but still a fine ale."
"I will have to find a couple more bottles of these."
"While not one of Rogue's best brews, it is an interesting pale ale."
"- A highly drinkable pale ale with a unique twinge imparted by juniper berries. Another round, bartender!"
"Not bad, but seems like something is missing in this beer. Not one of Rogue's best, nor a top Herb-Spice brew, but it is drinkable."
"A very fine brew from Rogue, a brewery that, for one reason or another, I have tried very little. While the name may turn some off, this brew pours a wonderful golden color that still offers more character than your regular old golden beer. The head is respectable and apparent for a short time. This is one of the more drinkable brews I have had in quite some time. The taste is extremely palatable and would go well with just about any fare - in my case, it was German food. Find it, try it! Prost!"
"Hazy, light amber with a creamy white head that holds well and leaves some decent lace. The aroma offers bold floral and citrusy hops over a softly sweet and buttery malt. Very inviting! The flavor starts with a very nice, gently sweet malt that's laced with toasty biscuit and caramel. A creamy mouthfeel enhances the maltiness. The body is deceptive - seemingly fuller than it actually is - and the gentle carbonation is very fine. Hops emerge with both bitterness and flavor (earthy, lightly citrusy, fruity - or is that the juniper?) just prior to the swallow, and the finish is dry with a lingering maltiness and some minor hops notes. Although I cannot distinguish the juniper berries, there is something very distinct about this beer and I can only assume that they are the cause. Quite a unique and charming beer that offers some good malt character (although not alot of complexity), but also retains the Rogue signature hoppiness. Very drinkable, and a nice change of pace from the usual winter beers!"
"Pours golden. Very nice aroma smells of citrusy hops. The taste reveals a nice maltiness with strong hops bitterness. The beer seems to change flavors as I drink the glass. At the top was mostly bitterness by the bottom third of the glass I'm getting more citrus taste. I like the very specific ingredients list on the bottle detailing the type of hops, malts, and yeast used. Listed on the bottle as a pale ale. There is a pleasant lingering aftertaste that coats the tongue."
"Nice, toasted-honey wafts 'steam from the cup,' as it were.  Little charred-oak hop slap on the front end. Crunchy malts, and sweet honey flavor dominate in the midtaste while hops hang tough.  Finishes squeaky apple."
"Trenchant, cured herb herb character on the inside."
"Hazy amber / orange in hue, topped by a creamy, bumpy, ivory white head that leaves lace.  Buttery and lightly toasty malt & caramel sweetness upfront in aroma ensued by lightly citrusy hop nose accompanied by sweetly herbal herbal juniper.  A snap of sharp, perfumy, slightly soapy herbal Juniper flavors quickly yield to assertive hop bitterness that offsets the medium caramel malt sweetness, but leaves the dextrinous body and resulting smooth mouthfeel intact. A combination of earthy and orange like hop flavor emerges along with a resurgent but mellowed pseudosweet Juniper once the initial hop bitterness fades.   Finishes slightly buttery, but otherwise clean and bitter.  Yellow Snow is quite a tasty and enjoyable brew. Although the strong hop bitterness considering the low gravity does throw the balance askew, what else does one expect from Rogue?  All around it's a hoppy, aromatic, and unique session beer."
"Don't eat the yellow snow, but by all means, drink it! This ale pours a nice, dark golden hue from the tap and features a durable, bubbly head. The nose, typical of most Rogue products, is quite hoppy, leaving not much else to the imagination. The taste is very pleasing and balanced, featuring a nice amount of bittering hops, malt, and some fruit (Juniper berries). The carbonation is just right on this one, and drinkability-wise, Yellow Snow scores high. A quality offering, and well worth seeking out on tap."
"2001 edition. Many bubbles ascend rapidly to form a frothy white head with great staying power. Pale orange/copper in color, definitely pale ale. Sweet floral hop aromas abound in the nose. Hints of toasted malt and what I'm guessing is the product of juniper berries from the bottle's statement (but I've never had juniper berries, so I wouldn't know). Flavors appear that jump between malty and hoppy as it rolls over your palate, and combine in a well-balanced sweetness. Medium body. Hints of what I again assume is the juniper abound. Later on, a small amount of rind-like flavor appears and leaves a bit of bitterness behind on the edges of your tongue. Although I expected more of a spicy brew, this is a great, well-balanced beer that I find very satisfying."
"Rogue beers never fail to impress me. This one never failed to impress me either. Nevermind the juniper berrries, this is just good pacific northwest ale. Excellent head, very tasty, clean bitterness. I like it."
"pours out of the 22 oz. bomber a cloudy hazy orange colour. northwest hop aroma with some pale malt notes too. really nice full creamy mouthfeel. sessionable taste. nothing really stands out over the other. balanced. pale ale characteristics, definite rogue hops with an earthy, dry finish that i'm assuming is due to the use of juniper. a nice pale ale with a twist. the ultimate rogue session ale. tasty."
"First taste of Amarillo hops that I'm aware of, and I like 'em. Creamy full mouthfeel. Floral nose with a definite malt presence. A draught takes you through a wide range of flavor, but this beer's unique characteristic is the bitter juniper finish that sits on the back of your tongue for hours. I wanted to drink it out of a martini glass with a fat garlic stuffed olive rolling about."
"Quite tasty winter brew with a clean taste and smooth finish.  Dad always told me not to eat the yellow snow, he never had this stuff."
"Orange-gold and hazy body.  Initially poured to a big, bubbly, white head.  Head fades quickly, but the carbonation keeps a rich lace on the top of the beer - thin here, thick and bubbly there.  The aroma is rich and earthy - reminds me of being in the woods at my uncle's place, surrounded by evergreens.  A hint of fruit is also present in the nose.  Herb flavors are strong, but not overpowering.  They're most notable on the finish, where they blend incredibly well with hop bitterness.  Overall, this is one helluva beer!  It recently became available in Indy (along with quite a few other Rogue brews), and I hope it's here to stay."
"Big head, clearish orange-amber.  Fresh and deep malt aroma, touch of evergreen.  Malty flavor but a nice, light body without a lot of syrupy qualities.  Very nice subtle bittering aided by the slight pine taste, non-assertive but gradual.  Again Rogue shows an uncanny ability to balance its brew's flavor profiles.  Malts are wonderfully combined, this Ale is inherently drinkable.  I could drink this on tap all night on a cool evening.  After the pour tasting, I took a pull right out of the bottle.  This method concentrates the juniper flavors more."
"Pours a beautiful pale golden color with a nice creamy head and a clinging lace.  Citrus aromas from th hops blend well with the piney smell from the juniper berries.  Slick hoppy flavors with a nice gin like flavor from the juniper berries again.  A very slick and refreshing mouthfeel to it that makes this beer extremely drinkable.  Yet another great offereing from Rogue.  A pale ale with a twist that definitely wouldn't be for everyone but if you like beer and you like gin then you will probably like this."
"I'd like to try this one again. Very unusual for the type of beer it was. The addition of the slight juniper/evergreen taste to the lighter beer was not unpleasant. I'd have to drink it again to say if I really liked it or if it was just another beer that was a little better than the rest, though."
"Re-rate 12/7/02..Adjusted the ratings a little...nose is unremarkable...kind of a grassy hop texture to it....the Juniper is very hidden in the taste and nose....this time it wasn't charged up at all...I'm not real high on this beer...it's OK but not as good as I expect a Rogue winter seasonal to be.."
"The appearance is what you'd expect from the source of yellow snow -  a pale straw color.  A very nice unassuming hop boquet on the nose.  This beer tastes great.  The one word that comes to mind is Delicious.  I think the blend of hops and Juniper berries give this beer a very unique and wonderful taste.  I was surprised to finally find this beer in MN.  I'm glad it's here and will be getting more."
"Big and malty like all the other Rogue beers, but there's something lacking. Hops are a bit off too ... pungent with a strong, raw/oily aftertaste."
"What impressed me about this ale was how sharp the spicy/floral hops were at the middle, but then became quite dry at the finish with relatively little hops residual."
"Notes: Not a bad brew at all though hops seem to over take the brew with an earthened hop flavour that may not be agreeable with some beer drinkers."
