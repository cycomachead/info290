"This was an excellent beer.  Not your typical vanilla porter - the cinnamon really adds a great flavor to it.  Obviously it pairs well with Mexican food, but it's really good just on its own as well.  Seek this one out if you want a little something different.  I'll look for this one again for sure."
"let me start by saying i got this beer after failing to get my hands on xocoveza.... after saying that im glad i didnt find it and got this. its smells great taste amazing feels ok overall i give it a 9.8 close to perfect... another great brew from our friends at elevation beer company."

"Pours black with a thin brown head.  Smells of dark malts, chocolate and vanilla.  Tastes of dark chocolate, dark malt, some spice, vanilla, a little astringence.  Medium body light carbonation with chocolate malt aftertaste."

"Slight vanilla in the aroma and taste.  Didn't get much cinnamon at all.  Very solid but wished it was a little more spiced for the style"
"Poured into a Fremont small snifter.  Pours a very dark mahogany brown, passing light only at the edges of the glass and a thin, light brown head that dissipates to patches with slight, slippery lacing. Aroma of mild toasted malt, vanilla, Mexican chocolate and cinnamon. Flavor is milk and Mexican chocolate, toasted malt with light char, light vanilla and cinnamon, well integrated, like a milk shake. Medium bodied with light creaminess and maybe a hair less carbonation than expected. A very nice dessert porter, like drinking a chocolate shake made with Mexican chocolate for light sweetness, cinnamon and vanilla. Balanced and very tasty. I enjoyed this a great deal."

"Incredibly easy to drink. Dangerously, even."

"Poured from a corked 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted July 2014."

"A big ol' bottle that pours black as midnight with a creamy slight tan head. Smell is vanilla, cream, cinnamon, and the local Starbucks. Taste is cinnamon, burnt biscuits, some vanilla, and a bit of cream.The mouthfeel is creamy and slick. This review seems to be holding the record for use of the word ""cream"". Not including that one even. Overall, its interesting. A bit heavy handed with the flavors for me but probably this not being my favorite style is affecting my judgement. If you like the style, give it a shot. If you don't...well, you probably wouldn't have anyway."

"The cinnamon is not overly powerful, but this does taste more like cookies than beer. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Grapevine Liquors in Denver."

"An OK imperial porter. A big sweetness from the vanilla, but not much else. No bad, but just kind of flat overall."
""
"On tap at Hops and Pie. Dark black, decent head, looks like a tasty porter. Aroma was cinnamon and malt. Flavor was as advertised: cinnamon, vanilla, malt, hint if chocolate. On the face of it it sounds awesome but it was really just ok. Glad I did not purchase a bottle of this."

"Decent enough, but another beer that's remarkably unremarkable. Nothing to set it apart from dozens of other decent porters on the market."

"O: As a porter, this beer is quite easy to drink as it has a relatively light body but the interesting flavors almost make this a beer that you can pleasantly sip."

"The Horchata Porter lacked the reason I bought the beer... the horchata. Vanilla and cinnamon flavors were very light and almost unnoticeable. The porter itself was decent although a bit bitter. The 8.2% was smooth though with no signs of ABV."
""
""
"O: Really nice porter. Wish there was a little more cinnamon to spice this up, it's barely discernible. Sweet and creamy regardless, nice flavors that meld together well. Definitely a sweet beer as you'd expect for the style."

"Solid overall for sure. Glad I got to try it."
"Bottle #01754. Something about watching Iron Chef and drinking a horchata-inspired beer just makes sense... Anyway, this stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises brown sugar, light molasses, buttercream, very light cocoa, and the lightest possible kiss of roasted malts. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a vein of straight vanilla bean. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly thin feel. Overall, what is generally a tasty brew is sabotaged by its far-too-thin feel. VDubb86 and I agreed that if it had more heft, more physical substance, more chewiness, it would be an exceptional beer. We just wanted the flavors to hang around for a while, rather than book it like lubed jelly..."

"this is everything stone's vertical epic series wished it could be, all wrapped up into a single brew. yeah, I said it! a huge porter dressed up with cinnamon and vanilla, it really is a thing of beauty. pours an intriguing dark brown with an obsidian luster and a noted density. the head is mocha in color and quite fluffy, leaving sticky rings as it drinks. the nose is big surprise, whole vanilla beans and cinnamon sticks in equal proportion take front and center with a massive roasted barley and chocolate malt body behind. the alcohol is not at all detectable in the aroma. the flavor is more balanced than the nose, but the prime position of the additives is welcomed yet again. the vanilla is sweet and earthy, almost greasy in its contribution, and the cinnamon is intensely spicy in flavor and fragrance. the bitter cocoa character of the malt calms both down and unites them exquisitely. the alcohol only comes out when the beer warms, and even then only in the very late stages of the otherwise sweet and mellow finish. wow this is lovely! full body, relaxed but noticeable carbonation, and a mouth coating thoroughness to the mouthfeel. overall maybe the best thing ive had from elevation in terms of both creativity and execution. I hope this gets some recognition. truly one of a kind excellence."

"Pours black with a nice off white head. Aroma is sweet and lightly roasty; vanilla beans, some milk chocolate, lactose sugars, and a kiss of cinnamon. Flavor pretty much followed suit. A creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, another solid brew from Elevation. They continue to impress me with what they are capable with. This one isn't my favorite from them, and it kinda pales in comparison to their regular porter (IMO) Little Mo, but I certainly enjoyed what I was drinking as I drank it."

"O-This is an enjoyable porter. There is nothing mind-blowing here, but some good flavors nonetheless. If you like your dark beers on the sweet and mild side, instead of the smoke and char side, Senorita is a good option. Pair this with some dulce de leche or flan (or, just drink it alone, it is sweet enough) and desert is served."

"Big head and lace remains...aroma of dried out brownie. Rich chocolate flavors, dark roasted malts and vanilla stand out. Very nice."
"Too thin and missing complexity for high ranks... It's nice and drinkable, however, relatively unremarkable. Nice blend of flavors, nothing is over powering. Barely Recommended @ ~$14."
