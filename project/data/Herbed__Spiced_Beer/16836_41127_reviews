"Is it a beer I'm going to go out and buy all the time? Probably not. Did they hit the nail on the head with a beer that tastes like pizza? Absolutely."
""
"I like it! The herb-y aroma and actual pizza taste!"
"Rating this not against other beers but more for what the aim was and this beer is spot on !!! Great paired with --- you guessed it pizza"
""
""
"Tastes like pizza, if that's what you were looking for in a beer."

"Interesting novelty beer. If i wanted pizza I would eat it and not drink a beer."

"O: interesting to try - a novelty at best... this could actually be a lot better if they jacked up the spicing (this was likely an older bottle - this ain't flying off the shelves), maybe added a touch of sweetness and perhaps some toasted malt to enhance crust flavors... who knows?"
"If I could go back and give myself advice last night, I would say ""order it"" every time (but just one, and only drink about 10 of the 16 ounces, which is exactly what happened)."

"I was visiting my parents and saw a bottle of this at a local liquor store, and curiosity got the better of me. I could only handle a few sips of this beer, and yes it does kind of taste like pizza. I mostly remember tasting lots of oregano and a bit of tomato. The flavor wasn't awful, but just not what I would want in a beer. On the other hand, my husband found this beer to be rather delicious."
""
""
""
"I actually think I would love to have this with a slice of NY pizza. That would be awesome."
""
"The taste here is pretty damn bad, but the appealing aroma and overall novelty of this beer save it, but it's still pretty bad - worse than I expected. Glad I tried it, glad I never have to try it again. The aroma really is nice, though."
""
""
""
""
"O: better than other reviewers would have made me believe. Not a great beer on its own, but certainly not bad. Paired with pizza? Quite wonderful without being distracting."
"O: OK. That was interesting. Not nearly as offensive as I expected it to be. It pulls off having obvious pizza flavors without rising to the level of being obnoxious. This is for sure a novelty or fluff beer, and less than a half-bottle should be more than enough to try. But still, it's interesting and different, and expands yet again what I thought a beer could taste like."

"An interesting novelty beer."

"Overall - Tastes like a cheese pizza. If you'd like to drink your pizza and get a tiny buzz then this is the way to go. If you'd rather not drink your pizza, stay away. It's hilarious and interesting all in the same."
"Overall - It isn't terrible. Just isn't good or worth drinking."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this isn't horrid, but I can't feel like I would ever want to have this again, it tastes like watered down cheap pie in a glass. However, it is what it is."
""
"O: This beer is much better than I thought it would be, especially after reading the reviews. It's drinkable, especially for those who like pizza! :)"
"No head really on a gold and burnt orange body with no lacing really. Both the aroma and the flavor are light overall. For the aroma, you mostly get mozzarella, pale malts and pepperoni. Flavor is more herbal with the oregano coming through more, also your typical pizza flavors. This beer could be a lot worse. Each flavor is understated and actually far better, although not good, than I imagined. We had a big beer tasting tonight and saved this for last, it could have been the first we had. Not at all a palate recker. light in body and light to medium carbonation."
"Pours with a small white head if foam on a lightly hazy, golden body. An aroma of, well... pizza. Crust, oregano, tomatoes, everything, and it is actually not unpleasant. The flavor is a more subdued version of the same thing with bready crust notes and subtle tomato and herbal notes. Medium body, moderately high carbonation, and a balanced finish. Shockingly not bad, the aroma is strange, but not really unpleasant, the flavor is just mild and a bit bland. I expected something horrible and what I got was a bit odd, but decent."
""
""
""
"Overall...it's a bland Blonde Ale spiced with oregano, basil and garlic... For a pizza beer it's rather boring."
""
""
"In my opinion, much better than what the average rater is saying. Smells like frozen pizza. Tastes like cheaper frozen pizza with the un-risen dough. Has the generic vegi-pizza sauce tastes. It's what we expected, right? Props for a good description that lives up to the drink. I've had way worse spiced beers. This one is average to slightly better than average and definitely worth trying at least once. I'll probably have one more or even more later in my life. I agree with a previous post, this is much better on a not-so-full stomach. Definitely drink before a meal, not afterwards."
""
""
""
"O - different, strange."
""
"This beer tastes really pizzaey. And that might sound like a strange idea, but it actually works perfectly, because the beer is quite yeasty and tastes like pizza crust, so the pizza flavors fit with it perfectly. I guess on just pure beer merits this is just decent, but the flavor is really delicious in my opinion. I would definitely drink this again. There's nothing at all I would fault this for, and the pizza flavor works surprisingly well. I drank this from a Chimay goblet."
""
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden orange with a small white head. Aroma and Taste of sweet oregano, pizza dough, yeast, with a bit grains and light fruity notes. Palate is a medium body, fairly smooth with mild carbonation. Finishes with a pizza dough, oregano, yeast flavor. Reminds me of a margherita tomato pizza, I actually enjoyed this brew."

"O - not as bad as I expected, very weird beer, and very unique"
"Overall i wasn't a fan of this beer and I thought it was a slightly below average example of the style, it had all the flavors as advertised, but the savory pizza flavors didn't go well in the beer, it doesn't keep me wanting to drink it. This didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and the flavors didn't do a good job at holding my attention, the pizza spices really started to wear on me and there is no way that I would want to drink multiple bottles of this. What I liked the most about this beer was how close to pizza the flavors was, all the key tastes that I look for in a pizza show up in this beer, it just didn't work out that well. What I liked the least about this beer was the the lingering tomato and spices flavor, it just wouldn't go away. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it might be interesting to try with pizza, but it's not something I'm going to go out of my way to get, but I do recommend trying it, some beers are so unique that they have to be tried once and this beer is one of them. All in all this beer just wasn't for me, in my opinion they nailed what they were going for and it really does taste similar to pizza, it's just those aren't flavors that I really desire in a beer and I don't really have an urge to keep drinking. I appreciate the effort it took to come up with and make this weird brew, but it just wasn't my kind of beer."
"It is really a liquid pizza, donâ€™t drink this with your stomach full. Quite interesting, though not sure I could hold another one."
""
"It was definitely an interesting beer. A buddy of mine had one at his house that someone gave him. When I opened it, it definitely smelled like a pizza with pepperoni. I thought it was pretty tasty. It did take a swallow or two for my palate to adjust to the flavor, but after that I thought it was great. I can't wait to go buy a six pack tomorrow. It wasn't the best beer I've ever had, but it's a cool concept, and I'll definitely drink it again."

"Wow, this was putrid. I will not even dare to give this swill a proper review other than to say it tastes and smells like a rancid pizza burp. Getting past the smell was a major challenge. When I finally worked up enough courage to taste it , chocking it down was hell."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not that good of a beer and gets a bit tiring as the glass empties. Interesting but not a beer I can revisit."
""
""
""
""

"Thanks to millerbuffoon for pulling this one out as a joke and then actually opening it for us to try. The beer poured out as a typical yellow color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer honestly smells a lot like pizza, or at least pepperoni. The taste of the beer is surprising, not in a good or bad way but just interesting. There is actually elements of tomato, basil, oregano, garlic and crust in this beer. It tastes pretty freakin' close to a pizza. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied and carbonated well. Overall this is a novelty, but it does taste and smell like it's intended too. I wouldn't drink the beer again unless I had too but it was fun to try."
""
""
""
"With that said, a 6 pack between a few friends to critique would be fun."
""
"O: The beer started out interesting enough, sure i played along, an ok visual, an aroma of what was expected, though not necessarily enticing. In the end the flavor is what sends this over the cliff. Pizza and beer are fine individually, just not together. Overall a gag drink, that will no doubt make you gag in the end. A novelty sale only. Even dave's chilli creek was a bit more tolerabe then this one. Run, do not walk as far away as possible when you see this. A great gag gift for that snobbish beer drinker you dont like, how do you think i got a hold of this?"
"Cant expect much going into a pizza flavored beer, but it did the job. i could go into detail about the under notes of it but lets be honest, your question is ""did it taste like pizza?"" Pizza? no. Pizza sause? yea! but watered down sause and the flavor is one that should not be in the consistancy of such a smooth liquid and it throws you off your game. wouldn't buy it again but glad i tried it!."
""
""
""
""
"Expecting a murky reddish tinted brew, surprised to find a mostly clear dark gold liquid. Scent was mild and had notes or oregano and light vegetable. Taste lead with oregano again, but tomato sauce pokes through, a lightly salty note, mild bread, other faint notes of spice. Lighter side of medium, bubbly. Bought due to the novelty and was quite frankly afraid of what the outcome would be... overall i enjoyed it for what it was, but wouldn't need to drink again."
""
"So they made what they set out to make. Congratulations? Really does taste like drinking a pizza albeit a pizza that was liberally dosed with oregano. I'm glad I got to try it for the novelty factor, but who in their right mind would willingly want one of these, much less drink anywhere close to a full bottle."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt and the pizza spices like oregano, basil, and garlic. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that isn't as bad as I was expecting but definitely a novelty item in the beer world."
""
"Pizza Beer has a golden orange glaze to itself with some faint white bubbles that die off rather quick, no lacing on the sides. There is some small bubbles rising up, so this is not all together dead. This sure as shit smells like a slice of pizza. It's all there with the basil and oregano showing off the most. Yep, just pizza in the scent, tomatoes as well. No real beer scents, just pizza. Well, this tastes like pizza, the spices used pop out real bold like with tomato pie flavor. Not hoppy, a bit of malt in the finish. Delivered as promised. Body is light and a bit watery, and the carbonation is very light. The aftertaste is tomato, but not long lingering. This is not something that I will go to at all, the flavor does not move me like that, but this beer lives up to its name, which scores points in my book."

"o - Overall not a very good beer at all; even eating it with pizza did not improve it. Just a ton of basil and oregano all over the place, which is not what I like in a beer. Wouldn't recommend checking out."
"not a bad one-off.. honestly tastes like something DFH would've made, actually it's like a light version of saison du buff."
"You know, when you buy ""pizza beer", you have to think of how high your expectations really are for this thing. Probably not very high. With that notion, the beer isn't undrinkable, and it's a great novelty - it really is reminiscent of ""pizza"" in terms of the most recognizable portion of the pie, the sauce. I wouldn't sit down and throw back more than one of these, however. Actually, now that I've had it once, I'll probably never buy it again. I wouldn't go so far as to call it ""awful"".... but, highly unnecessary."
"O - My neighbor have me this bottle and of course it looked interesting. I approached it very open mindedly. As stated, I respect when a special beer presents its special characteristics in the nose, mouth, etc. It was a bit of a stretch and I wasn't blown away, but I would recommend this to others as a novelty."
"Okay, so I'm always game to try a gimmick beer. This one is a little stranger than usual...beer made with pizza. The beer itself is a hazy, slightly dark yellow color. No real head after a few seconds. The smell, though, is what fascinated me. It really smells like a pizza. Pizza spice (basil and oregano), pizza crust, and tomato (I'm not sure about the cheese). The pizza is backed by a very slight malt scent, but it mostly smells like a pie. I expected a beer brewed with pizza spice, but this one really surprised me. The flavor has some pizza spice to it, but otherwise is similar to an american all-malt lager beer. Hops are very restrained, and the beer is balanced slightly to the dry side. Finish is quick and the beer is very light in body. This one is very much worth a try, just for the unique flavor."
""
""
"O: This is an interesting beer, especially if you like oregano. It's worth a try given its uniqueness and because the brewer pulled off a successful beer using these ingredients. It's also not that difficult to drink."
"Overall, this is pizza in beer form. I can see no reason not to try a bottle, as it's extremely interesting. I applaud the makes for their innovation. Surprisingly, this beer is delicious to wash down with red wine. I alternated a few sips and was delighted by the combination on my palette."
""

""
""
""
""
"O - it is what it is, a novelty beer."
""
"This beer should never have been made. I'm not surprised."
""
""
""
"O: I did not have high hopes for this beer but rather bought it because how could you say no to a single bottle - I did not expect to like it, enjoy it, and figured it would be a drain pour. I merely purchased it because it seemed gimmicky. This beer delivers exactly what it claimed to be - it smelled and tasted like pizza and was rather enjoyable. Easy enough to drink but not something you would want to have numerous of in a session. I would definite have another one of these at some point in the future - definitely unique."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"O: a nice beer that would be tough to replicate. In addition, I could not imagine drinking 5 gallons of sub par pizza beer so hats off to the original brewers on this one!"
""
"The garlic /oregano being too loud is pretty much my only problem with this brew. It tastes like pizza beer, what they set out to do. But still, I wouldn't drink it every day, it remains a novelty beer in my eyes."
"O - Not particularly appetizing, but the nose is on point for pizza."
""
""

"I got a single 16oz bottle from Woodman's in Janesville, WI in Summer 2012. Pours a cloudy copper orange color with slight head, but diminishes fast. Has a mild scent of oregano, basil, tomato, and garlic. Mmm, it'll remind you of a pizzeria! Taste is mild with tomato paste and garlic being the most noticeable ingredients. Really lives up to its name on the bottle. A slightly better than average beer with a really unique taste. *As a side note, Chef Tom is a really cool and nice guy who makes a lot of different pizza based products that are delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - It's decent for what it is, but it really isn't much. Definitely worth trying once, but nothing worth seeking out ever again."
""
""
"O - it starts promising but gets a little blah towards the end, but big points for creativity, a must try for the novelty factor"
""
"a food beer perhaps? I really can't think of what would inspire anyone to brew this, well pizza I suppose. A must try beer, travel, trade, kill, steal, whatever it takes everyone should try this one"
""
""
""
"While not quite a sink pour, I can't say that this stuff really does anything for me, and I sure took my time finishing off the glass. May do a bit better when served with food, however I'm in no huge rush to find out."
"Not the hot mess I had anticipated, and a damned sight better as a lead-in to the sexy local indie pizza option that just rang the buzzer for all my Saturday night gustatory needs...coming!"
""
""
""
"O: Not the worst beer I have ever had, but very close. Maybe this was a cool idea to whomever thought this up, but the execution of this idea is lacking to say the least. The one good thing about this beer is that it does smell like pizza, and that's kinda cool. Otherwise, not good. The beer is not appealing to look at, the taste is like watered down pizza, and beer should not taste like mozzarella cheeze and tomato sauce. The mouthfeel was of a BMC beer. Please do not make any more of this beer."
""
""
"O - Well, I had to try it and I did. But I will never go back to it again. I guess I was expecting something different. Although what else could you expect from a beer called ""pizza beer?"""
""
"Got this beer from a friend and we were pretty excited on trying this new beer out. It was poured into two pint glasses. It looked like an average beer without any head. It's very hazy and you can see the herbs( I'm pretty sure it wasn't yeast floating around).It's aroam is very vinegary, i reminded me of a mixture of Worchestershire sauce and red vinegar mixed together and the taste resembled the aromas down to a ""T". I would say try this beer if you have an adventurous spirit, otherwise just stay away from it, it really requires an accquired taste."
"I've been wondering about this beer ever since being repulsed by the sound of it years ago. Time to take it down, once and for all. It pours a lightly hazy orange-amber topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises peppery cantaloupe, light basil, cilantro, dark greens, and lemon zest. It's not very pizza-like, but it's also not all that great-smelling, either. The taste is where the pizza comes in: notes of watered-down tomato juice, basil, plenty of garlic, light biscuit, black pepper, coriander, and a hint of what seems like it could be Swiss cheese. Most of this hits in the front, but then fades away into a sort of spicy melon flavor, complete with rind-y bitterness. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, this beer could have been horrific. Instead, it comes across as muddled, watery, thin, and generally uninspired, despite the cooky idea."
"O: I was surprised how much this actually smells and tastes like pizza sauce. It's a novel idea and quite good, but I'm not sure if I'd want to drink it very often... it's a little confusing to drink a pizza - I'd almost rather just cut to the chase and eat a piece of real pizza and drink a wheat beer to compliment it."
"The CPJ"
"Sip itâ€¦ Unless you like shoving a whole piece of pizza in your mouth!"
"D-Overall this was drinkable for about 8 oz then the last 4 were gross. It was werid but not horrible. Prob wont ever seek this out again but it was good to try liquid pizza once"
"T: Gross. Basil and tomato along with hints of grain and yeast. Honestly, don't try this. It's nearly undrinkable. So much pizza flavor here that it's nearly unbearable. This was a drainpour after about three sips."
"Thanks Terri! Poured into a tasting glass. It smells like an alien pizza sauce. Huge tomato and basil notes blend with oregano and garlic. The vegetal character is just horrendous. Awful smell. The flavor is just as bad, with a brutal blast of oregano and basil with a disgusting artificial tomato flavor. Epicly bad stuff."
"I gotta drain pour it. I refuse to give a second taste to see if I can pick out any other flavors."
"D - well I dint really like it, but I'll finish a four ounce pour."
"D-not terrible, but not close to the greatest..."
"Pours a murky orange. a bit of white head.. not really good looking. Smells like butter and wheat. maybe some tomato on the nose. Tastes sweet and buterry. Its kinda gross but I can definitely taste a bit of pizza in it. Wheat, tomato and oregano are fairly prominent. Its not awful but its certainly not good..."
"D- This is not drinkable at all and shouldn't be on shelves in a beer store. I've read a few reviews of this beer, and people have said it ""actually tasted like pizza", now, I dunno if i had a bad batch of this or something but that would have to be some shitty pizza. I would never buy or sip this again not even as a gag, or on a bet."
" ~ At the very least this is a very interesting brew. I'm told this beer is no longer made, so if you see one on the shelf at your local brew store, you probably want to nab one, even if only for the sake of saying you gave it a try."
"D - This beer is a novelty item in my opinion, but a fairly well done novelty item. They were aiming for fresh pizza flavors and they achieved that with flying colors. Does that mean I want to ever drink this beer again? Probably not. As a matter of fact, I'm not so sure I'm going to be able to finish this one."
"I fear I'll now have nightmares of rotten cheese, dough yeast, water, spoiled tomato paste, cut-rate herbs & a blender. This beer is what happens when your garbage disposal hates you."
"In the case of BA reviewers being way too generous, this is exhibit A."
"SUGGESTION-- if you're curious what this beer tastes like, do your own thing like I did, and shove some pizza into a half-full glass of beer and let it sit for a few minutes, then take a few gulps. It'll most likely be better than this beer. Plus, you have the advantage of choosing your own decent beer, and your own favorite style of pizza. I'd avoid the anchovies ;-)"
"D- Drainpour of my 1/3 of the bottle. Could not/would not drink again. My buddy was the only one who liked it and ended up drinking all the samples. But he also paid money to see 'Dragon Wars' in theatres, so his judgement is in question."
"I'd say it's a novelty beer, but something I think everyone should try at least once. I'd like to have a case at my house just to make guests drink it, because it tastes that much like a pizza."
"Pours a cloudy golden yellow. Smells like pizza! Straight up like tomato paste, garlic and oregano, wow they nailed it. Tastes like fucking pizza! If you were to take a pizza combo, liquify it and turn it into a beer, this would be it. Basil, garlic, the whole deal. I could barely finish this. I love pizza but there's something real weird about drinking it. They nailed it though."
"Overall: A nice try at a novelty beer, but it misses the mark. I would definitely use this when making pizza dough in lieu of water."
"D: Light ABV and a pretty pleasing taste (at least at this stage of its life)...know what? I'd buy/drink this again, absolutely. I enjoy trying unusual/experimental beers [see my previous review for Uncommon's Bacon Brown]; this is one of the better curiosities I've had. Worth a try."
"Pours a two finger white head that vanishes quickly leaving no lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hazy amber color. Nose is tomato and spice. Flavor is not pizza, it is doughy, some hops. I like pizza and beer but not together. Not worth $2.99 for a 16oz bottle from Liquorama Upland, CA."
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, basil, tomato, and garlic. It kind of smells like pizza sauce. In the taste, garlic, basil, and well, it kind of reminds me of drinking spaghetti sauce. A spicy bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry tomato and basil aftertaste. Big flavors, but odd. I like pizza, I like beer, but this was not right."
"pours a lively hazed amber with highlights of straw and a half inch fizzy white head that quickly dissipates. the smell is bold pizza sauce, which basically included oregano, garlic, bad tomatoes, and bready crusts. so... the goal was reached, but this is not appetizing to me. the tomato i got was more like ketchup (which doesn't go too well on pizza) and the sour yeast smell in the backround just jarred the senses. it was like getting sea sick smelling a beer. i knew it was a beer, but my brain started over loading. the flavor is very light and thankfully doesn't translate the smell. i just get bready yeast and very grainy corn adjunct that is short and stinging. it had a garlic aftertaste, which would be ok if it wasn't a friggin' beer. i need to go brush my teeth. i was the only one in the room of five that finished the beer."
"There is something vaguely nauseating about this beer, probably why Italy doesn't brew beer with tomatoes or garlic in it. A novelty beer you will only want to taste once."
"D- This is a interesting beer to say the least. I wouldn't drink a whole lot of this but for a beer to deliver what it set out for...well it hit the head on the nail."
"D: Let's face it, you're going to get this for the same reason I got it: novelty. Drinkability doesn't really play into it. But it is what is is advertised as, pizza beer. If you like fresh pizza, you're probably going to find this drinkable. Even if it is a bit unusual tasting for a beer. Not bad at all. I could see myself drinking another one of these or two."
"D: An interesting experiment, it is what it says it is - it tastes and smells like pizza. Hard to put a drinkability score as it's so strange, but definitely worth a pick up just for the experience."
"D: I was blown away by how they could manage to flavor a beer with a pizza,very intresting. I think I was the only one that enjoyed this brew in the beer tasting that we had."
"D: Drinking this beer was comparable to eating a stale hot pocket."
"Back to the drawing board on this one. Try Shorts Bloody Beer for a more successful example of a ""culinary beer""."
"D - Only got about halfway through and couldn't stomach any more."
"If all the beer in the world except for this was destroyed by nuclear war, I would ferment and drink my own urine before opening another bottle of pizza beer."
"D - Two sips and down the drain with this god-awful pint of barfbeer. This has to be THE worst beer I've ever had in my entire life. I've never found a beer to be so undrinkable it's made me a whiff away from puking. I have no idea where they get off saying ""Beer so good it deserves a wine glass."" and honestly, I'm even more appalled Sprecher would a) sell it in their gift shop and b) use their logo-embossed bottles for this when they only contract brew it (which is why I won't tarnish Sprecher with a review this terrible). I love pizza, It's one of my favorites, don't get me wrong, but this is just awful."
"Drinkability: Disgusting taste, amazing concept and style. I hope I never have to drink this again though."
"Stupidity in a bottle. Why does something like this exist? I read one of the reviews that said it smells like vomited beer and pizza. That about nails it. The taste is beyond words. What did I expect? It's beer with freaking basil, oregano and garlic in it. Garlic is not going to taste good in beer. That should be just about the most self-evident thing in the world. If you want an out of the ordinary conversation piece to put on a shelf, fine. But for the love of God don't open it."
"So my motto is, if you don't like it...chug it...but not possible with with this garbage. DP! DRAIN POUR!!!!"
"EDIT: Over a week later and I find myself wishing that I had another one of these. Maybe it is for me, after all. Hope to get the chance to grab a few of these in a couple of months, when I vacation up north."
"I didn't love it, I won't have it again, I don't regret it, I respect it. It tasted like pizza. Nicely done. Time to cross it off my list."
"D- definitely a one and done novelty beer. something thats nice to be able to say ive tried, but probably wont ever spend money on again. strangest beer ive ever had. i found this one a hard beer to score. its not something i was thrilled about, but the brewer started out with a plan for this one, and it was pulled off better than i would have expected."
"3.0 D: The 16 oz. bottle really is the upper limit of what I would want in a sitting. Still, I wouldn't mind one of these every six months or so and I would probably pick this over a PBR anytime. The creativity and innovation is there and for that I respect this beer more than it probably deserves."
"In summary, this is surely one of the worst beverages I've ever tasted. In that sense, it totally lived up to my expectations, possibly even surpassed them. I feel bad for anyone that actually spent money on this beer, though."
"A very unique beer and worth trying. The kind of bottle you keep in your fridge and offer to adventurous friends!"
"Drinkability rates about average. Ate it with pizza rolls and those added a dimension that made the beer more drinkable. Not terrible, as I said to my friends, but one is more than enough."
"D - Above-average actually. This is not a great beer for sure, but it accomplishes what it's trying to do: taste like a pizza. Would go decently well with a pizza I think."
"drinkability - awful - this is the beer that sceams never again"
"Overall I would recommend this beer to others (Kind of did when I went to a six pack shop shortly after) but I really couldn't see myself drinking more than one. Definitely a must try for people who need a brake for the typical beer."
"D - I would never drink this again, but I don't think I would stop someone from drinking it. It's just absolutely insanely weird and I think everyone should try this once."
"EDIT: My comments were based on drinking it by itself without an accompanying pizza or other food, but I've been told by Tom that this beer is very much meant to be paired with food, so I'm gonna try it again in the future with some pizza and see how I feel about it then."
"Thanks Eric.. I honestly never.... ever... seriously .. ever would have tried trading for this one... but I think it was actually pretty interesting... made better with some bites of salami.. :-) Thanks for the opportunity."
"The pour created a finger of bone-white head with good retention. Color was a medium-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had tomato, basil, and oregano. It was nowhere near as pungent as at the Roundhouse. Mouthfeel was medium with the tomato and garlic achieving prevalence on the palate. I know that I going to get dunned for liking this and not Chelada, but this was semi-palatable while the latter was simply awful. NOT recommended for all and certainly NOT with dessert. Calling a spade a spade - it is a novelty beer. Chefs Tom and Athena of the ""Original Seefurth Family"" probably had it brewed as a lark. Oakle doakle! This was a far cry from a national brand brewing up some Bob-awful crap and foisting it off on an unsuspecting audience. Chelada = Blah! This = Drinkable, but not overly so. I drank it while eating a pizza. I repeat - this is NOT a dessert beer! One with my pizza was just right. Finish was strong with tomato, basil and oregano. Sorry, garlic, but you seemed to get lost in the mix, amazingly. This or the W. P. R. H. version? WPRH. This or wine? Wiine with pizza? Ooof. This or an American IPA with pizza? I have had too many Hop Devils with pizza to make that a question. Mais oui! This was simply a lark of a beer that rates ""All 3s"" in my book. I was glad that I tried it, but equally glad to be finished. Call me ""Mr. C."" Ha!"
"Overall: They achieved what they set out for-a beer that taste just like pizza. I see this going the way of the 3 Stooges Beer several years ago."
"D- not a bad beer, but not something I would drink more than a few of."
"Drinkability? 1 is definitely enough at one sitting but I'm somewhat surprised that I finished the bottle without a problem. Btw, head retention was very good and it had some decent lacing."
"Of course the beer is quite a gimmic, but the beer is not a bust as a quality beverage. The average beer makes for great conversation, challenges the senses, and gives you another opportunity to say, ""just when you thought you've seen it all..."". The beer's first sip accompanies the pizza well, but after a few bites, the beer's flavors and nuances get washed out."
"Honestly, I can't believe I drank this whole beer. I've drank beers that are much worse than this, but not in a long time. I'm not sure if the people that make this novelty honestly think this is a good beer or if they make it as more for entertainment. IE, in college I had a friend that used to make the most god awful punch for parties; nobody liked it, not even him. Yet he made it for every party because inevitably it would get drank in its entirety because people would bet each other they couldn't drink it, or do the ol' switcharoo and give it to some unsuspecting individual. The fact that I drank this willingly just speaks volumes to how far I'll go to review a beer."
"This beer had a neat concept. Brewed with spices associated with a pizza flavor. When I tried this brew it was not 100% chilled so that may be why my scores are low. It had a lighter color and was a neat beer to taste test, but not really drinkable over a few ounces."
"D: Thanks, but I'll pass. My morbid curiosity has been satisfied"
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer. I like the taste and overall presentation, although the mouthfeel could have been better. I can't say that I'd want to drink it frequently, but it is definitely worth trying and enjoying, as I was surprised by the quality. I will be having it again."
"The taste is a little weird as it doesn't match the profoundness of the smell. The components that stick out the most are garlic and tomato, with the malts providing a little bit sweetness. Oregano is present. This beer really doesn't taste bad, if anything like a traditional lager with spices. I could easily drink another one of these, especially while scarfing down a slice of pie."
"Beware. You will taste pizza in this one."
"Serving type: bottle"
"(D) This beer definitely needs to be consumed while chilled. I took the last two swigs after the beer had warmed and it was not good. Pairs great with pizza, but if you eat some chocolate with it, the flavors of the spices will come to the forefront. No joke."
"D: zilch, I drain poured after three painful sips."
"A: Interesting looking beer, lots of champagne-like head, loads of bubbles lining the interior walls of the glass, medium copper, looks slightly anemic - 3.00, S: Geez, I'm struggling with this juxtaposition of beer and pizza, it truly smells like pizza, lots of oregano and even tomato paste, it's hard to pick out any elements of beer which push the rating scale down as far as a beer goes - 2.50, T: What little beer that comes through on the palate is macro and unappetizing, pizza flavors are very apparent, basil and oregano with the tomato sauce, maybe the slightest hint of hops - 2.00, M: Thin and lackluster body, even a touch oily - 2.00, D: I must be honest that I had very low expectations for this beer and the reality seemed to hold true, it's a gimmick that merits a taste and that's as far as it goes, I will not drink this beer again - 2.00"
"D - Good, but not stellar. Although I'm glad that I tried this one, and would probably buy it again for the novelty, one is enough for me. Id like to try this with a pizza and see if it holds its own or is too much pizza flavor for one meal. Although its brewed here in the states, this is a much better ""Italian"" beer than the usual Italian beers or pitchers of macro swill you'd find at a pasta/pizza joint."
"D- Well at first this is amazing and a true novelty. Its definitely worth a try because it tastes just like pizza. It does get somewhat annoying when you clearly haven't consumed any Italian food and you feel like you ate an entire Italian dinner and it stays on your breath forever. This is exactly what it claims to be-a pizza beer and tastes as such. Its been 45 minutes since consumption and its still on my breath."
"16 ounce bottle. Picked it up on a recent trip to Champaign/Urbana, IL. I saw this and figured why not try it. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a half inch white head. Head retention is average, not much lacing. Well, this beer definitely smells like pizza just like it says on the label (oregano, basil, tomato and garlic). I don't notice any hop or malt aromas, just pizza. It tastes the same as the aroma, but there's some hops I can taste too. Finishes a bit bitter. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's not watery but there isn't much to the mouthfeel at all. Average carbonation. Drinkability is OK, I guess. I'm pretty sure I couldn't drink more than one bottle of this at a time, though. This is definitely a unique beer, that's for sure. It's not great, but it's not awful either. All in all, I'd drink this again. For $2.29 a bottle, it's worth a try."
"I wish this was in Michigan, I would keep a few in the Fridge for cooking and to enjoy."
"Overall, it tastes like pizza. What did you expect? But really, it's one of the most unique beers I've ever tasted. Kudos to the brewers for thinking outside the box, and kudos to Sprecher for taking a chance on this beer. Believe it or not, this is the new ""Extreme Beer"". Beer brewed with food, it's the new fad. You heard it here first."
"Definitely not a beer to be taken seriously. Which may explain the unsold cases of it sitting around the Roundhouse in Aurora."
"Note: My friends were all super-sad when they saw the Sprecher name on the bottle, and some vowed to stop trying Sprecher products even after I explained that it is contract-brewed. So, if anyone from Sprecher is reading this... now you know."
"D= Not the worst beer I ever had, but also not one I would go out of my way for again. Its worth a try if you are curious though!"
"Pours a super fizzy golden orange with hints of red. The head is a fluffy off-white and recedes to a ring fairly quickly leaving no lacing. It smells like, well, a pizza, with strong basil and oregano aromas. The taste isn't exactly like pizza, but pretty darn close. There's the generic grainy lager taste but with serious pizza flavors of basil, garlic and oregano. The mouthfeel is light to medium and highly carbonated. I have to say that this is one of the more interesting brews I've tasted and was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely the best pizza beer I've tasted!"
"Overall, I wouldnt go for this again."
"Drinkability: I expected more from this beer - more impact, more complexity, more something. It's disappointingly boring, and slightly gross."
"D: Nice with a slice."
"It's not helped out by a weak, thin body, either. Nor by the Italiano dyspepsia it gives you."
"I would probably enjoy a beer with oregano, basil, tomato, and garlic, but this one had none of those characteristics. I guess the joke was on me."
"I drainpour a beer about once every two hundred reviews. This was absolutely disgusting. Even worse, I had to wait an hour before I trusted my palate to review anything else. I don't mind experimental brews, but we have to recognize that every once in a while things go awry."
"Call me crazy, but I kind of liked this one. Pours yellowish gold with a small whitish head. Smell is basil, oregano and dough. Taste is malty, doughiness with obvious oregano and pizza and pizza sauce like spices. The doughy, yeasty malt and pizza spices work pretty well together, and while not something I'd drink a lot of, it was fun to share and went down pretty easily for me. Definitely a pizza beer."
"D: The herbs kind of sour this beer when it warms. But I give mama a four when she's cold and a two when she's warm."
"Mamma Mia! Pizza Beer is one of the most unique offerings that I have ever had. Cutting back on the garlic is the only change that I'd make if given the opportunity. Even though it borders on gimmicky, the brewers have done a remarkable job of recreating the flavor of pizza in a glass of beer. Thanks to murrayswine for the bottle."
"Drinkability increases as a result of the pairing. Much more manageable when actually consumed as the brewer intended."
"The beer is golden colored with a thin white head. The aroma is a bit like tomato sauce with herbs. The flavor is moderately grainy, a bit sweet with medium body. There is little if any hop presence aside from some low bitterness. The beer finishes with an odd taste, kind of like V8 - but not as good. Overall I thought it was an ok beer with a bad finish - interesting idea but I wouldn't recommend. I didn't finish it."
"On its own this beer is almost a drain pour. How ever halfway through the pint my pizza came out of the oven and made the beer more tolerable. It is a great compliment to pizza. If you are in the mood for something wierd, this is it."
"It's mild enough to not overwhelm or offend, but also bland enough to not warrant a repeat visit. It's probably worth a spin just for quirkiness' sake. Just don't expect any ""wows""."
"D- I have been staring at this beer in the fridge for a few days a little scared to open it. It was not as horrific as I though but it was still gross, and I like pizza. The crust flavors were authentic but I don't like that in a beer and the tomato was spot on but I don't think I could drink a tomato beer. Interesting idea that should have stopped at that."
"Hm. Not to brag, but, it's a Pizza Parade, babies! Hands down, no question, it is pizza-y. That was the aim of Mister and Missus Seefurth and they achieved it. The nose is slathered in spicy, chunky, robust tomato sauce primarily, with just a slight bready background note. This, of course, carries over into the taste. Along the way, other flavors begin to develop -- some sweetish dough here, some chiffonade basil there. Even a pinch of red pepper spiciness. Oh, and packed with fresh garlic. Ah, the power of garlic. As with any pie, it's more of the same till the end, though the spices still had legs and carried on well past the finish. As you drink it down, the various flavors really start to come together as it slowly bakes in your gut, all of it settling vaguely under the definition of ""pizza", at least in terms of flavor and aroma. No complaints here. However, as with Short's Bloody Beer, I just can't see myself calling on this beer every day. Not bad at all, though. Easily the best pizza beer on the market."
" Looks like hazy clear apple juice. Thin white head. Pretty average. The nose is either a 5 or a 1, so I'll give it a 3. It really does smell like pizza sauce, which is quite disturbing. Old tomatoes, garlic, oregano, some basil... it's all there, and it's all quite odd. No hint of the crust and cheese though. Just canned pizza paste/sauce. So weird. Taste is lacking much of what was in the nose (which is probably a good thing). Mostly watery tomato beer, metallic, thin, with perhaps a slight white pepper taste. Not appealing. Too weird to drink much of it."
"Bottle purchased at City Wide and consumed with a pizza. Light amber in color, wispy white head. Looks like a light lager. Smells hugely of tomato sause and oregano, like i've opened a contained of generic brand spaghetti sauce. I have to say that it smells perfect for the style :). Taste is a watered down tomato sauce with mild, bland spices or oregano and garlic. Mostly just watery and not really pizza like or beer like. very thin and reminds me of Miller Lite. Eh, no thanks, even as a joke."
"Pours a deep a cloudy orange color with a below average head, and below average lacing and slightly under carbonated. Smells of pizza spices hops. Tastes of oregano, onion, and garlic that's complements nicely with a the hops. Not too bad...actually this is surprisingly fairly good"
"D-This is much better than I thought it would be,tastes better than it sounds,unique and worth checking out."
"Tasted on 4/7/08."
"Drinkability: Wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. I wouldn't seek this out again, but it is interesting."
"Didn't try with pizza this time - worth trying it with some once - not something I want to drink often - but I hope the restaurant had fun doing this! Thanks for trying this Sprecher! Why not have some pizza beer with your pizza?"
"drinkablility is not too good. this is a unique mixture of flavors, which does not work well in a beer. the flavor says something like pizza, but even that is somewhat of a stretch."
"drinkability: unfortunately this in the standard 16oz sprecher bottle - 8oz would be ideal"
"Like I said, mad props to the brewers of this beer. They created a very unique and well crafted product. I don't like it but I swear I hope the area bars start serving this. I can't wait to bet a coworker 10 bucks to drink two of these."
"For what its trying to be, it hits the mark. I'm just not sure if beer should be hitting this mark."
"I split this bottle with SurlySober, who bought it as something of a lark."
"carbonation."
"I could have seen this as more of an amber ale than a pale. Maybe some more hops to balance the pizza, though maybe the Seefurth family tried that and it didn't work. There is nothing to compare this one to, so if other pizza beers appear I will re-review."
"You may not like the concept, but you have to try it."
"Should not be used as a pizza replacement. As a beer it is definitely worth a try, but also not really a good choice of pizza accompaniments. It's pretty much just what it sounds like. Pizza Beer."
"The color looks like liquid pizza beer. Tomato mber mixed wth parmesan chee look. Very hazey and deep with no visible bubbles and no head. One of the most unique aromas I've ever smelled in a beer. The only time an aroma of cheese in a beer is ok. The combination of pizza spices just makes me think parmesan cheese. You can smell the spices very well with this beer. The first sip is up front herbal oregano and basil. The tomato and garlic hit the middle. Then all four meet at the end of the tongue to give a powedered parmesan pizza finish. Very vegetal and herbal palate. Just like liquid pizza,"
"Drinkability is low, this beer tastes like an unbalanced pale ale with sprinkles of italian/pizza spices, I would consider this to be a primarily novelty beer, I could see no reason to try this again nor would I recommend to any serious beer drinker, this may serve as a caution against replicating non-relevant food flavors in beer. . . maybe this would be complimentary with pizza but I couldn't vouch for that"
"Mouthfeel is on the thin side with fast moving carbonation that explodes with each sip. The body really disappointed me here as I think if it would have been fuller it would accentuated the beer much better. Overall, it's an interesting beer to try and fairly tasty being as the spicing is not overpowering. However, I can't say it leaves me wanting to run out and drink it again!"
