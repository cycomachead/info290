"Overall: not a bad beer at all.  It definitely drinks below its ABV, and the light hand used in the spicing works well in this application."

"Some yeasty fruit aromas with some spice – probably nutmeg dominate the nose. It pours reddish gold to garnet chestnut under a finely bubbled 1” tan tinted white foam collar. The palate begins with dried fruit flavors, a trace of earthiness, some toffee sweetness, dark sugars and a range of spices including nutmeg. It has a very creamy medium bodied texture driven by very fine soft carbonation."

"Besides being very interested in this beer because of the fact that it is brewed in a medieval castle... This is a damn good beer!  It pours a hazy light brown with specs of hops and spices floating around.  The color almost resembles an iced tea.  Right on the first taste, I noticed the crisp brightness.  It is very refreshing and the spices blended work well with the non-filtered brew.  Belgium beers never disappoint, this one is very good.  The 8.5% alc/vol is hidden well with the almost creamy aftertaste, but it warms you nicely.  I would love to drink this outdoors on a cold night.  Overall, I would highly suggest trying this one before the cold weather ends."

"Bottle. Poured a semi-opaque Amber color with a proud head. Smells neutral. A little sweet, a little spicy. Malt forward; no hops. Maybe a bit medicinal. The first sip did nothing for me. The yeast brings a strong bite. The spices aren't overwhelming by any means but they also make me rear back a bit. The second sip and those following after are mostly more enjoyable. I adjust to the flavor and pick out some nuances. Almost like a spiced bread. It's not overly sweet,mwhich is a plus for my palate. The Belgian aspects of the beer aren't all-encompassing. I like that but I am also a bit confused as to what the thesis of this beer is. It's kinda Belgian, kinda spicy, kinda bland. I don't know. The best part of this one is its body and alcohol masking. The Anne Frank of alcohol. I had no idea; this one shiv'd me with its alcohol content. To finish the story, this one was not a beer I would come back to."

"Decent, definitely deserves the 'spiced beer' categorization, though the spices themselves and the beer in general aren't very remarkable."
""
"I just couldn't turn this bottle down after seeing it on the seasonal shelf at Total Wine. Damn this ticking urge... Anyway, it pours a partly-cloudy sunset bronze-amber topped by a finger or so of off-cream foam. The nose comprises pumpernickel, clove, brown sugar, dark fruits, light candied orange peel, and toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, with an increased level of dark fruits, though, make no mistake, the rest (particularly the spices, especially newly-arrived ginger and cinnamon) doesn't fade without a fight. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a solid spiced Winter brew, if nothing all that special. I'd certainly have another, though."

"Poured into a brandy snifter. The beer pours dark hazy copper with a finger and a half length off-white head. There are bubbles visible rising along the side of the glass. There are malty aromas as well as some scent of toffee, fruit, and some spice. The fruity aroma is akin to plum and fig. The spice notes are mostly coriander. The flavors are of bready pilsner malt with a stronger spice note in the flavor than in the nose. The coriander comes out, but I also get some hints of pepper, orange peel, and anise that other reviewers picked out. The sweetness is pretty balanced out with the abundant spice bouquet in this beer. The fruity notes come out a little stronger as the beer warms. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and the alcohol provides a nice warming quality. Not much of the aftertaste lingers in this beer, allowing a stronger drinkability for this beer. This is a very good beer."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, honey, yeast, spices, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it smells better than it tastes."

"This is a great Christmas beer. Lots of sweet fruity flavor with a touch of spice. Quite drinkable, but better to sip and savor."
""
""
"Overall, this is one I'm going to look for each season to go with my other favorite Christmas ales."
""
"Despite its ""giant"" references, the beer is small on the palate and stomach, making it supple and elegant ale. It's both charming and soft. But its overall light profile keeps me wanting more strength, power, and complexity."
"O - lots of complexity bu too many disconnected flavors to be appealing"

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours cloudy red orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big raisin, prune, pear, clove, allspice, ginger, tea, cinnamon, molasses, bread, herbal, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of raisin, toast, biscuit, caramel, molasses, clove, ginger, earth, nuttiness, tea, allspice, herbal, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, toast, biscuit, molasses, nuttiness, ginger, tea, herbal, and clove on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of flavors; nice balance of malt and holiday spice flavors; zero cloying on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian spiced beer. Nice spice/malt balance and complexity; very smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable and unique offering."

"Pours a pale brown with hints of orange, with generous white head that is silky smooth and leaves ample lace. Nose is bready & fruity. Palate offers a good balance of dark fruits, dark bready flavors, fennel seeds and a few miscellaneous baking spices. Finish has a slight burnt, toasty sugary quality. Easy drinking."
""
"Overall - The taste reminded me a bit of a fruitcake, which is a good thing for a Christmas themed beer I guess. Problem is, I'm not a huge fan of fruitcake. Still glad i gave it a shot, but I wouldn't pick this up again."
""
""
"This is clearly a holiday specialty but should not be confused with the more spectacular beers of the season."
"It's one of the best X-mas beers I've ever enjoyed, and apparently it's under-rated. It's not a kick-you in the head with flavor beer, but it really satisfies as a unique sipper. Worth seeking out."
""
""
"O - This is a nice Belgian ale. I've enjoyed this Christmas 5 pack from Shelton Bros."
""
"O: Since this is a Belgian noel, I was not expecting the large amount of spice that dominates this beer. The finish is a bit abrasive and lingering. Overall, the spice could have been balanced better."
"O- Strikingly similar to Rosee d'Hibiscus but tastes a bit better IMO."
"It's a strange beer, but it worked for me. The ABV level of 8.5% is perfect for a beer and despite the highish number, it was well hidden making it very drinkable. I'd love to have another one in the future."
"O - one of the nicer winter ales."
"Overall, this is a neat Christmas beer, the belgian yeast plays nice with all the other flavors, the spices are in the right proportion. Would definitely drink this again."
""
"O: Again, this was good but not great. Wouldn't buy this again. 3.5"
"I like it! Very understated. Poured dark with a reddish hue. Head was off-white and dissipated quickly. Nice lacing on the glass. There is almost no aroma, the carbonation is adequate and it has an earthy taste that reminds me of good farming soil and old shoe leather. I did not pick up some of the plum and cherry mentioned by other reviewers, but that's probably my palate and not there's."
"Pours a dark brown color w/ a thin off white head. Minimal lacing on my snifter glass. The smell is really weak. I mean, REALLY weak... I barely get anything other than some woody notes, spices, and some malt. All extremely understated. The taste is slightly better. The woody-earthiness and spices are the main thing here, but still a little weak on taste. Feel is medium, with little carbonation and somewhat dry finish. Glad I got to try this, but probably won't look for it again. Cheers."
"Overall a pretty respectable brew and one that is good for cold winter nights."
"o - i have to say i was pleasantly surprised by this one. not sure i'd want more than one of these at a time, but i'd buy it again. seems just right for a cold winter night or a holiday celebration."

"Overall – not a bad brew at all. It wouldn’t be my pick for a fave, but it definitely is intriguing and thought provoking!"
"This brew is on sale at Rollin' Oats for $0.99 a bottle right now. Needless to say, my fridge is full of Christmas Giant beer. The brew pours a rustic golden mauve-ish hue, and is capped with a finger's worth of antique white head. The nose is spicy, and earthy, and seems to have notes of chamomile and ginger. The flavor is very similar, with a flavor best described as something between Sahti and BSPA. It is not terribly sweet, it hides ABV well, and is quite tea-like overall. I like it, but I could see it being a big turn-off for others."
"This beer poured out with a cloudy red colored body. The head was white and fluffy. It settles within a minute or so and leaves a light lacing. The smell of the beer has some spicy herbal notes on the nose. The taste of the beer is yeasty and a bit spicy. The mouthfeel of the beer is decent, had a nice carbonation level and body mass. Overall it's not a bad winter brew but I could have been better. I would probably try this one again if I saw it again."
"Overall this beer is pretty well made, the spices are not overdone. Initially i thought i was getting into a belgian dark strong ale but was very surprised to be greeted by the big spice nose."
"So in the first week of May, I'm bustin' out a holiday beer. Xmas year round...bottles were on sale for $1.99 each so I picked one up during my weekly beer run. Poured beautifully with a nice foamy head that held on for a good long time. Color was brown and ""warm"". Nose was fig like with hints of spice; cinnamon mostly. Taste was comforting and Christmas-sy. Alcohol was very well hidden, and the beer was extremely drinkable; kinda wish I had bought a few more at this price. I'd be opening up my second or third by this point. Nice beer overall."
"330 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is 8.5%. Dark amber to copper colour, cloudy in the end, big off-white head. Malty aroma with notes of brown bread and caramel, hints of brown kandi sugar and oak. The flavour is malty and medium sweet with notes of caramel, brown sugar and brown bread, some spicy notes too, moderate hops in the finish. Warming mouthfeel. Quite nice."
"D: Not cloyingly sweet like some holiday beers, and the spiciness is balanced by a nice, dry maltiness. Good stuff."
"O- Interesting brew... Tastes great, the spice was done to the max it can be done without being overpowering, creating a unite drink."
"drinkability definitely takes a hit because for me, the aroma distracts from the taste and makes it harder to drink and enjoy."
"Poured 11.2oz bottle into tulip. Deep caramel brown with a bit of a chill haze and thick egg shell white head. Aroma is sweet and malty...apples, caramel, brown sugar, candied cherries, with some earthiness. Tight Belgian carbonation and medium to medium light body feel. Some sediments linger which is a turn of for me personally. Sweet bready brown sugar flavor up front and then into some Belgian esters but mostly apple. Light spiciness and a pretty forward yeast flavor as well."
"Nice looking 750 ml bottle from Cost Plus World Market..no cork though. Only $2.79 on clearance. Slightly murky amber coloured ale..with a nice thick cream coloured head. Ok aroma, typically Belgian but kinda muted..doughy, some slight barnyard funk and a bit of fresh cut hay. The flavour is a bit more livelly though..very spicy/peppery..some clove.Earthy with a touch of ginger. Nice palate..well carbonated. Overall a nice winter ale and very good value for that clearance price."
"drinkability: this was aged for a year. disappointng. was expecting a homerun by any means but this was just plain."
"D - Not bad for a Christmas beer, a bit spicy but I wouldn't turn this one down if offered."
"Overall, I think this is a good beer. I think it's one drink a person should have at least once (because of the history behind the brewery) but the price of the beer reflects its rareness, and honestly...not its quality."
" The flavor is nice w/ mild dry spice and wood-cinnamony w/ a hint of date and light brown sugar like a spice cookie w/ some woody resinous textures playing off the spice and malt sweetness in a way that melds well. I dig the mild tannin keeping it in the front of the palate and slight blend of raisin, date and grassy elements with mild nuttiness in the finish. This is a seriously complex beer that I didn't think much of til it got warmer toward cellar temp it really opens up and the last drops of yeast added some nice belgian character along with the malty spice _ I would not drink multiples of but great for what it is"
"D: All of the spices make this beer a slow sipper, even though the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. The taste is rather complex and the spices leave you longing for another sip."
"Loving specialty Belgian beers, I had high hopes for this one. It's a golden-amber color, completely clear, with a white, thick, tuft-laden head. Wonderful! The smell is a little muted...a little spice, and a touch of pale malt. The smell could be a much more intense and interesting. The beer, however, has a very flavorful taste...malt, honey, peppery spice (peppermint-esque?). Great balance. The mouthfeel is almost silky...very soft and full. Room for improvement? Sure, but this is a wonderfully drinkable Christmas beer!"
"Pours a clody copper oranges with a deep thick head that lasted quite a while. Smells of ginger and spices. Taste is a bit one dimentional. It has no body or depth to it. As Belgian ales go this one is pretty light. Its seems like a well made beer I am just looking for more when it comes to a Belgian ale"
"D- christmas, my christmas i'm creepin up on a mothachristmas buzz from this bottle when the radiator is right by your computer and it's 18 degrees outside without the wind chill and you spent the last 7 hours in the mall and at kmart and the store with clothes for dogs and you picked up this beer at world market and it was... so-so. rambling on like this makes the bottle go faster, a bottle that i otherwise may have re-corked (capped) and put to the side while i popped that taddy porter that's been winking at me."
"Drink is decent with light warming and tingly booze, and spices that come on a little strong but not overpowering, a decent dry finish and for a winter ale not too heavy."
"D: This was more like mulled cider than beer, but it was quite interesting and tasty. Nice scent and flavor, with great body and no noticeable alcohol, so it was pretty easy to drink. Although, all the spices did become a bit tedious by the end of the glass. This seemed like a beer that would be best fresh, so don't bother cellaring unless you want to really experiment. Great change of pace drink."
"D- VERY a good holiday ale. Not as heavy, dark and warm as some of my favorite Christmas ales, but a very good one, and I will be getting again!"
"D - Very good seasonal drink; easy to consume especially with the complex nature of the herbal & earthy ingredients; a perfect drink for the holiday season; highly recommended"
"Overall impression: unexpected mouthfeel for a Belgian style; reminiscent of a domestic style. subtle alcohol."
"This is more cloyingly sweet after the first glass. While it is a good offering for the holidays, I'd rather just have one glass and move on to something else. Nevertheless, I did manage to finish the 75 cl bottle over dinner."
"This was OK. It definitely had that festive gingerbread cookie/fruit cake thing going on with it that a lot of these Christmas beers seem to shoot for. I don't know. I just didn't get the complexity out of this that some other reviewers did. This was a pleasant but ultimately didn't leave a huge impression on me."
"I decanted it slowly, ending up with less than a finger's worth of deep-tan head that quickly fizzed its way out of existence and into wisps. Color was a deep coppery-red with NE-plus quality clarity. Nose had a vinous grape-y quality up front along with the chewing tobacco sweetness mentioned by the previous reviewer. Mouthfeel was very full, with a lot of huge carbonic bubbles leading the way. The taste was unique, a blend of raisin, bourbon, tobacco, and lemon zest. Frankly, it was like a cocktail more than a beer. Oh, those crazy Belgians and the crazier Shelton Brothers for importing such beers. Finish combined the lemon zestiness with the vinous quality of the nose for a dryness that would have put many martinis to shame. Phew! This begged for an H2O chaser, I'll tell you. I am all for dry, but this was on a Sahara Desert scale with the Zephyr winds blowing past."
"** Recommendation - let this one warm into the high 50's before reviewing. **"
"Not a bad beer, it is showing a bit of age around the edges and is fairly complex, but seems to be missing a little something to really make it a great beer."
"Overall, enjoyable, but can get lost in the crowd of other Belgian beers out there."
"I can't taste the alcohol, and because it adds nothing past intoxication potential I can't see why this beer needs to be 8.5% ABV."
"Pours a murky caramel in color with an off white head. Little yeasties hang around. Smells malty, bready and boozey. Tastes chocolatey, some vanilla, plum. Even has some rum raisen notes. Ghost hops add bitterness. Medium to full bodied, a little chalky due to the yeast then finishes dry. Spices have died down to a slight notion . Easily drank, good beer."
"This beer doesn't really have enough going on to hate or love. It's just a ho-hum Belgian-style ale with a bit of spice. Pours a bright copper color with a fizzy white head. The aroma is mostly caramel malt, Belgian earthiness, candi sugar and spice (juniper berries?), but it doesn't amount to anything particularly exciting. Flavor is mildly sweet. Mouthfeel is too thin. Actually, the beer is generally fairly weak for 8.5% abv. Not a bad beer but not something I'd recommend with so many excellent Belgian ales around."
"D: Good for a single serving. The abv is moderate at 8.5%abv provides just the right amount of warmth without hinderance. Warm piney with licorice and dried honey gives this a wintery feel worthy of a try."
"My only regret is that I only bought one bottle and will most likely have to wait until next Christmas to drink it again."
"Drinkability: It does display a curious complexity, but I simply didn't care for the particular mix of flavors going on in this one -- like a first date where there was just no connection, no spark. However, it's one I may potentially revisit in the Winter of this new year. Look! I'm putting in on my 365 Days of Puppies calendar this very moment (Dec. 5th, a Golden Retriever pup)!"
"D - overall, what a great brew. this is a very solid beer with a lot going on. it's not your every-day kinda beer. even for a belgian! it's unique. thats what i like about it. i will be visiting this one again for sure."
"D- It's a good sipper but more than two would be a stretch"
"D: This is a tasty spiced beer. I was tempted to pick this up in December, but I waited and snagged a single for $1.50, which was a steal. A spicy, complex winter seasonal that scores points for originality."
"Pours a hazy iced tea color with a full finger loose light tan colored head that fades quickly leaving spotty patterns of lacing. The smell is really nice and complex; an aggressive earthy fruity fig apple and caramel. A nice amount of creamy effervescence, bright and tangy, the mouth feel is medium-full bodied. The flavors aren't as pronounced as the nose, but the earthy harvest fruit and caramel characteristics are savory. The 8.5% ABV is a bit of a warmer, but otherwise well integrated. I recommend giving this one a spin."
"This beer is called Christmas of the Giants because it is brewed in the Irchonwelz castle in Irchonwelz Belgium. The Gate stands high to allow the passage of the ocassional visiting giant. My visit with this giant was a good one and at 1.99 a 355 ml I might just have to revisit it again."
"Good drinkability."
"Drinkability: a nice flavored beer that is a bit of a slow sipper. More than one could be enjoyed in a session, but the well hidden alcohol will creep up on you."
"Nice Christmas brew that is easy and pleasant to drink."
"Spiced beer all the way. It's an interesting beer to try, and one whos attractiveness is enhanced by a ""save $2 off instantly"" coupon for the 330 ml bottle. Only $0.99 after that, making it one of my better buys of 2009."
"Pours a rich, golden-orange color, quite warm hues which are nice on a cold winter day. Minimal head, but does not really matter. Aroma and taste is mainly of spices --- clove, cinnamon and perhaps most of all nutmeg --- with hints of fruit and vanilla. Feel is rich, complex and warming. Very good winter warmer type beer."
"overall a solid brew."
"Way too easy to drink for an 8.5%. I wasn't expecting too much from this beer but it definitely impressed me."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid crystal malt and dark candy sugar aroma along with a classy Belgian yeast fruitiness. The taste is good as well. It's a smooth drinker with a nice, malty flavor and yeast fruitiness. There is a light spice character in the finish. I'm detecting coriander and something else I can't put my finger on. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good Belgian noel. It's mildly spiced and quite enjoyable."
"D: My second favorite Christmas beer of the 2009 season so far, very nice indeed."
"Not bad. Nothing too dramatic. Poured with a nice large off white to light tan head that lasts a a while and great lace. Color is a slightly hazy copper. Aroma is a little malty and caramel, a hint of fruit and yeast. Flavor is mild - mostly caramel and malt with a hint of perfume. Body is nice and so is carbonation . Definite alcohol in the finish. Decent beer in a general sort of way."
"D: Smells like a Belgian, but finishes very sweet & rich. I'll look for this in a singles store, but doubt I'd buy a case because I'm sure it fetches a pretty penny."
"When I poured the beer I noticed a lite head on it. Almost as if the beer appeared to be a little under carbonated. The color was a light golden brown and very clear. Aroma wise I picked up a nutty raisin like quality. Tasting this beer I got a nice nutmeg like flavor. I also picked up a yeasty character with hints of brown sugar. The after taste was mild tarty that left very little flavor. Over all I enjoyed this beer as it got warmer. This was a easy sipper that would be great after spending a full day shopping with the family."
"Soft carbonation up front with a lot of sweet estery belgian yeast providing some nice dark fruit notes followed by an earthy toasted subtle malt body and slightly syrupy cloyingly sweet medicinal flavor. Subtle spice, mostly peppery peppermint and pine needle. Very subtly tart with a bit of vinegar feel. Astringent alcohol taste in the finish."
" D- This beer has some nice layers of dry sugar flavors that balance with the fizz notes and the hop notes. There are interesting apple qualities that remain in the background."
"very attractive hazy brownish/burnt orange with an off white head that leaves tons of lace. nose is mild, but very nice. lots of burnt toffee, caramel, dark sugars, dark fruit and a touch of spiciness all on top of a bit of a musty, cellary character that is synonymous with proper belgian breweries. taste is more of the same ringing out in pretty good balance with a dry, earthy, herbal, finish that definitely involves a little bit of a hopping. relatively slick mouthfeel that carries a touch of bitter without being prickly. nice one. shelton brothers don't seem to dissapoint. try goliath from the same brewer if you can find it."
"D-The fact that this beer reminds me of apple cider significantly cuts into its drinkability. For me its a one and done beer. I was glad to try it, but its doubtful I will ever purchase it again."
"D: The carbonation and hops on the finish crisp things up nicely and make this very drinkable. But the spices and sweetness force you to slow down and sip on this one for awhile, which is nice during the colder months!"
"Drinkability: This is a very drinkable, with nothing being over done. There is lots of subtle balance and with moderate sweetness that refreshes rather than cloys and dominates. The operative words for this beer are ""balanced"" and ""subtle."" I certainly will be drinking this one again when the opportunity presents."
"D - Although this beer is going down mostly smooth without the alcohol peeking through, the intense spice component is a little rough after about half the bottle, as is the huge sweetness. Overall an interesting beer; perhaps a treat to share with a friend after dessert, but on it's own it's quite in-your-face."
"Pours a five finger, pale tan head that fades very slowly to a thin layer leaving a some lace. Cloudy brown/amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Woody/raisiny nose. Flavor is almost sweet, woody, spicy and herbal. $3.95 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Being glad that the bottle is only 330 ml rather than 750 ml is never a good sign. Noel Des Geants (Christmas Of The Giants... whatever that means) is decent beer that doesn't get it done because it doesn't have an overly appealing spice bill. Goliath (Gouyasse Triple) is still Brasserie Des Geants best beer."
"d: Pleasant enough up front, even if it was one dimensional. The finish was was quite harsh though."
"Poured at medium speed into a Westvletern goblet giving it plenty of room to form a nice 2"" medium tan fluffy head. Head did not last long or lace, left a ring around the goblet on top of the beer. Foam felt kind of like cotton candy and was almost chewy. Very nice mouth feel. Beer itself was cloudy dark amber to medium blonde color around the edge when held to light. Could not see much carbonation from side of goblet, but top of beer showed signs of medium fizz action. First scent was lightly astringent and bready. Also detected slightly burnt sugary notes. Other scents detected were light caramel, malt, barley, mild orange, apple, and raisins. Taste presents all the scents, some very subtle. This beer is well balanced and smooth which leaves a slight tingle on the gums and has a pleasant dry hoppy finish. I would be happy to try another."
"Drinkability- Good. This is a nice un-Christmasy Christmas beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with heavy carbonation."
"Fizzy mouthfeel with good heaviness, a nice drinker. No abv nicely hidden, goes well with main dinner or afterward with dessert. Nice winter accompaniment."
"Thanks to a friend for sharing this one, but I'm not a fan. I got a strong dry hay flavor over rubbery caramel. That sounds worse than this beer truly tastes, and I know some folks like this, it may just not be for me. The appearnce was a murky dark red-brown with a tan head. Overall, the beer is balanced, but I just don't like how it tastes."
"Pleasant."
"Drinkability: This highly drinkable ale is potentially dangerous, since it would go well with some strong foods, particularly certain creamy cheeses, and one might just keep on going without engaging the thinking area."
"alluring roasted vanilla aromas. tightly wrapped berry phenols seem to lurk inside. crunchy ripe red and black berry skins. on the palate it is very sweet with alcohol. nice, silky texture. very low acidity. i tend to like more. still, natural feel, with sweet plummy prune licuor flavors. Nice."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, highly carbonated, with some sugary fruit and heat found in the finish."
"Strong alcohol warmth, a little too potent for my tastes. Not as sweet as the smell would indicate. Relatively thin with a respectively high carbonation level. I can't detect any spices. The aftertaste is a pleasant blend of hop bitterness and the remnants of malt sugars. Still, the alcohol overwhelms all of the subtlety of this beer."
"pours a hazy orange amber with a nice head initially, but this fades to a ring. No real lacing. Smells of sweet malt and Christmas spices. Smells somewhat boozy and warming, in a good way. The taste is also malty, boozy, spicy, and with hints of vanilla and orange peel which blend nicely with the holiday spices. Warming and moderately sweet and well carbonated. This is a new brewery for me and based on this I'll definitely try some other offerings from them. There is a bite of ginger or some other spice on the finish that I particularly like. A nice holiday brew."
" A great Holiday ale that has depth and complexity. While alcohol is not invisible it never calls attention to itself, inviting a session that should never be. A beer worth seeking out."
"A hazy brown ale. Has a nice creamy egg nog colored head that leaves a nice lace. There sweet notes of peach and apricot up front in the aroma. Hints of cinnamon and clove hover in the background. At first the is a candy sweetness that brushes over the tip of the tongue. Followed by a herb/floral hop note that catches at the back of your throat. As it warms tabacco and cinnamon flavors dance around in your mouth."
"Drinkability is ok, there's a lot going on if you try to break it down, but they all seem to almost neutralize each other, leaving a peppery burn that isn't helped by the crisp, foamy mouthfeel. The ABV isn't apparent, however it's not to digestible for whatever reason, an overspiced, dark farmhouse."
"4/3.5/3.5/4/3.5"
"Pours a musty brown color with a nice pillowy head that slowly dissipated into a puffy cap. The aroma is faint, I pick up some candied plums with a hint of spice. The taste is earthy/sprucey, some dark bready malt, grassy hops, candi sugar and a light berry fruit. A different take on an Belgian X-mas brew, earthy and bitter rather than boozy and sweet. The feel is chewy with heavy carbonation, finishes slightly bitter. A nice christmas brew, not a cloying sugar bomb, quite drinkable."
"Pours a reddish to a deep amber color with a big light tan head. In the aroma, orange peel, cinnamon, and candy sugar. In the taste, cinnamon primarily, yet a nice orange like citrus, and an array of other spices in there. A spicey bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry orange citrus in the aftertaste. Nice spices, almost saison like, quite nice."
"Had on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured to a light reddish-brown with thin white head that lingered well and left good lacing. Nose was a pleasant mix of spciy clove and banana, as well as a hint of other fruitiness. Mouthfeel of this medium-bodied beer was carbonated and tingly with a spicy, malty flavor with just the right amount of hoppy fruit. This all rounded to a nice, dry, clinging finish."
"I really wouldn't consider this one a spiced beer. Very subtle to non-existent. Still, it's a solid Belgian brew and a nice drinker."
"d - tasts good and you could have more, but i'll probably just have one. too malty for me, and not enough spice."
"Nice cloudy, slightly translucent deep brown color, with a huge beige head that fades into a nice lasting lacing. Nose is very sweet malts, hay, and anise/spices. Taste is sweet Belgian malts, bourbon, and some vague nuttiness. Good mouthfeel. Nice wintery beer. Very drinkable, despite ABV."
"The taste is very complex. There is definitely warming alcohol, fermented candied sugars, sweet caramels and maybe some florals, spices that are difficult to pin down but maybe fennel, and maybe a dark licorice flavor towards the finish. There is an ABV bite towards the finish and this gets more pronounced as the beer warms. This is a fairly carbonated beer with a spritely mouthfeel, a bit pricklish on the tongue. The complexity of the beer and waves of overlapping experiences make this a very interesting and worthwhile beer to sample."
"Very esy to drink. The alcohol content takes over at the finish."
"May you have the happiest of Holidays!"
"Drinkability has to take a little hit because of the spiciness. It's OK, but that's about it. Nothing that stands out as memorable - it's not an easily identified spice, as clove or cinnamon would be, for example. It's more herbal."
"fair drinkability... the alcohol is a little too present and there is something odd about the bitterness at the finish. certainly not bad though."
"This is a beer that grew on me the longer I sipped on it and let it sit in the glass. There is almost a winter warmer aspect to this beer, reminding me of spiced apple pie. Very, very nice beer."
"No doubt this is one of the top winter seasonals I have had. The complex flavors are there and the drinkability is there as well, overall an exceptional beer."
"D - This was a decent Christmas beer, I like the subtle hop accents in it. However, I don't think I could have more than one per session - based on the sweetness."
"sampled from a 330ml bottle: Pours deep caramel with ruby highlights. Fluffy, off white, two finger head adorns the top of the glass. Aromas of candy sugar, dark fruit with sweet floral aroma. First taste is a bit sweet, with honey flavors. Then out of nowhere comes a strong herb flavor, which reminds me of a Chirtmas tree (The Shelton Brothers website says they use a special aromatic herb from the region of the brewery?). The aftertaste of this herb is a bit funky and it really dries out the mouth. Nothing special on this one, in fact it is tough to finish the 330ml bottle."
