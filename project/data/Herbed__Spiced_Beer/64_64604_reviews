review_text
"dark straw colored, massive wild head.  light fragrant chamomile scent.  taste is a bizarre champagne and floral, pungent fruit mixture (shades of overripe mango) which gets stronger as it warms.  almost a dinner-mint finish.  this is hilariously non-beer to my tastes, but after drinking it, i would absolutely substitute it for a celebratory champagne/wine drink. confounding."

"Never really had anything like this one. Quite delicious."

"Enjoyable"

"O- Interesting. Not much to it, but I think that's the point. A little fruity, and pretty bready."
"A very interesting beer. The pour is a light orange with an off white head. The smell seemed all over the place at first with hints of sage, the tea leaves, and other herbs before I caught the fruits. The taste was very earthy with all of the spices before sweet fruits coming out big near the end. It was very layered and complex and offered interesting insight  to ancient beer flavors. Worth a try although not an every day kind of beer."

"25 oz bomber in a tulip glass. bottled 2012. hazy straw in color. smells of sweet bread and fruit-cant tell what kind. taste is sweet, very unique. chamomile is pronounced, maybe some honey? its unique, a little abrasive with the chamomile so pronounced. im also unsure what effect the aging had. better rating due to uniqueness and ambition-probably would not drink again though."

"Chamomile, za'atar and doum fruit are perfectly intertwined into this awesome, (but a tad pricey), session ale."
"O: This is an excellent beer taking into account the purpose, not just randomly tasting a bunch of beers. Thinking of it as a liquid time capsule allows me to appreciate it to the fullest extent. With no offensive flavors or smell, and a light drinkable body, I am quite pleased with this brew. It has unique flavors I have not experienced before and is quite enjoyable. Instead of ""Walk Like an Egyptian"" you can now ""Drink Like An Egyptian"". Perhaps Dogfish should have used that line on the bottle :)"
""
"All those exotic spices and fruits I mentioned are evident in the taste more so than the toasted malts and crisp, clean but mellow hops at the end. I felt like watching ""Ben Hur"" after drinking this."

"This one is strange. it's thin and herbal. It's like an alcohol-infused carbonated tea with a turmeric-like spice suspended in it. It's not quite a beer which I like very much--but I also definitely knew what I was getting myself into when I picked up this bottle. I was expecting something a little chalky, a little herbal, and quite funky. I will remember it well but won't drink it more than once every couple of years I think."

"Overall a pretty interesting beer. Pretty neat of dog fish head to have an ancient beer line. It was good, but not $12 good"

"Overall: A very fun drink, despite the price of the bomber. Sweet, light, corny/wheaty. This will never be a regular drink for anyone, but it's an intriguing ""candy tasting "" beer that will make you smile. I haven't tried the other 'historical' brews from Dogfish Head, but I'm betting that this is among the most approachable of the lot. Thumbs up!"

"This is a unique brew. The flavors are plentiful and combine very well. This is something different, which is what Dogfish Head does best."

"On the lighter end of medium body with a slightly tart,funky yeast presence that dominates the flavor. This was really strong in the nose and stands out here as well. Grassy and herbal with resinous hops, straw, damp hay and wild bugs followed by floral rose water, sweet malts, light fruit and booze. Somewhat dry, chalky and earthy with sunflower seed oil, caramel malt, toffee and biscuit toward the end of the palate. Some dark and light fruit esters and boozy sweetness as well but there's not much heat. I would have guessed higher than 4.5% but it's still pretty easy to drink. Decent complexity but some of the flavors clash with each other. Not the most flavorful beer but its an interesting experiment and they successfully captured the wild Egyptian yeast. I don't think that I would buy this beer again but I enjoyed drinking it."

"Poured a semi-cloudy golden with a tiny bit of white head that dissipated quickly. Not quite as thick as some Egyptian beers are described in tomb finds, but I'll take it. Scents of fruit with a lot of sweetness and some apricot notes. A good scent, sweet and fruity. Flavor is light and crisp, slightly sweet, with light apricot and fig notes, and a backbone of grain and wheat cracker with some yeasty bread. The sweetness is balanced by the bready flavors and blends quite well. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Overall it's an excellent beer, and probably the best of the Ancient Ales I've tried."

"Taste echoes the nose -- very bready with a tinge of exotic fruit. This is an easy-to-drink brew, well-balanced and a little sweet, but still very much a beer, and an exceptional one at that. If this were bottled in regular 6-packs, I'd buy more! A superb beer, proving that the ancient Egyptians apparently knew what they were doing."
""
""
"O - as a history lesson this is cool, to think maybe this is what the Egyptians drank, but it's not what I drink or want to drink. Will pass on this in the future but was good to have it once just for the experience. That's pretty much why I love dogfish head, this was brewed to push envelope and provide an experience, not just to sell more beer."

"The aromatic spices in this beer are likely at first to remind you of ""feet."" Then, bread and middle eastern cuisine. If you read the reviews no one really knew what this was supposed to taste like so I recommend trying it anyway. Pours a golden straw color and a nice thick head that doesn’t last very long. Mouthfeel is ""syrupy."" The more you drink the more you will notice the spices in the beer. No real hops taste in this and it has has low carbonation as well which makes it sweet in a weird way. The fruit ( whatever kind of fruit that was) is noticeable because the flavor of it seems to go very well with those spices. It’s the strangest beer I have had but I’m not sorry I bought it. The bottle is freaky cool."

"A little surprised at such a low score here on BA. No it's not a hop bomb or R.I.S. but this was a delightful surprise. Well done !"

"A unique beer. Drinkable. Taste is nice. Aroma is a detriment. Get rid of that onion and smoke and you have an ok beer here."

"an easy drinker with not much complexity. not bad not great."
"Pale gold with a huge white head, minimal retention or lace. Nose has sweet bready malt, herbal character, chamomile isn't distinct on the nose. Taste has more sweet grain, obscure fruit and herbal qualities that I'm struggling to pin down (as with all of the beers in this DFH series). Medium feel, medium high carbonation. Couldn't find much I enjoyed from this, a struggles to put back."

"O- This is a well-blended crisp beer that has a touch of sweetness and lots of very interesting flavors. It was fun to try but it was a bit to much for such a big bottle. I just got a little tired of drinking it. Perhaps with the heat of the Sahara it might fit the bill."
"This is a peculiar beer and it grows a bit tiresome after not even half the bottle. Thankfully, the abv is reasonably low; if this were a boozy creation it's doubtful I could drink it."
""
""
""
"15/20"
""
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer. Definitely looking forward to having it again especially in the warmer months. I wasn't sure what to expect and I almost didn't get it because it is on the pricey side but upon seeing the Arabic seasonings my interest was peaked I am glad I went for it! Well done in my opinion."
""
"Lovely full head with a slow fade and decent lacing. Smell has a light breadiness with an unusual fruit component. Some almost lactic like sourness. Chamomile and other light spices as well and a very faint mint tea. Taste is light a crisp with a very mild bitterness. Sweet malt and bread, chamomile shows up here and the fruit I'm sure but not having eaten it I can't finger it. Feel is light crisp and refreshing with a high drinkability. A very good beer for what it is. As an attempt to recreate the Egyptian beer recipe this one scores"
"O- This was an interesting brew. Definitely not my favorite DFH, but not my least favorite. Actually definitely preferred this a little bit more then the My Antonia I had right after. Fairly exotic and definitely unique, however like I said it's not my favorite blend of fruits and spices. It was easy to drink and I enjoyed trying it, but probably not something that I would pick up again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Was hoping to really like this and was only midly enjoying it. Of the DFH ancient ales I'd put this below Chateau Jihau, Sahti, and Midas Touch. Just didn't find it too tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly leaving a trace of lace. Crystal clear light amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Mild fruity nose and flavor seems like bread, honey and chamomile, no idea what doum fruit tastes like. This would be good on a hot day, its 39. $14.00 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."

"O: Overall props for making something old, something new. Again not an everyday ale or one that will wow you, but interesting to see how an ancient beer might have tasted. With respect to homage, one is trouble on how to define and rate this beer, by authenticity, which is hard to confirm, or by style, herb & spiced, where it is at best average. Certainly worth a look if your a beer historian who wants to try something with respect to its beginings, just dont expect to be wowed even if your a die hard dogfish head, this wasn't the intended purpose."
"Decided to give this a try while visiting the Fairfax brewpub in Virginia. It's a deep orange amber color with a modest white head and fair lacing. Smells like mild chamomille dough with other floral dust ideas. A bit out of the ordinary but not bad. The flavor brings lemon tea and more of the smell theme with ideas of apple and heather and perhaps a touch of muted mint. Again, sort of odd but interesting. It's light bodied and somewhat watery in feel with delicate carbonation. Not my cup of tea but not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Weird. Weird, weird, weird beer. I can't believe I finished the entire bottle, as it was such a strange taste. I expected more (from Dogfish), especially at $14.99/bottle. There was just this really off-putting smell/taste that I couldn't get past. It was kind of like perfumed soap and basil. I usually enjoy Dogfish beers, but would definitely not recommend this one to anyone."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is not an easy beer to drink, even though the ABV is rather low the flavor combination is ""interesting"" and it makes it a tough beer to finish. Strangely, I have had this beer two times and it has given me a headache almost immediately both times."
"These ancient ales are always fun to try. Some I like more than others. I wasn't a big fan of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at The Thirsty Moose. The mint-bread aroma is different and reminds me of Moroccan Mint Tea, which I drink regularly. Light orange bodied, and big lace. A lighter mouthfeel. Some mint and other herbal tastes, I don't get it, not for me taste-wise, so not too drinkable."
""
"Well done and enjoyable DFG!"
"O- Relaxing. Unique. A wowzer. This stuff is fun to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer had some nice complex flavor, the spices were very apparent but not overwhelming, the flavors were very well balanced."
"O - An interesting beer with a great story behind it. Not wow, but not terrible either. Hard to describe."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – very interesting brew to think about, taste, and analyze."
""
"O: I was excited to try this beer in the spirit of being exposed to new and different things, and I'm glad that I did. I find the idea behind this beer laudable. But the bottom line is that, to me, it tastes like an acceptable pilsner - not so good for me."
""
"Ancient ale from DFH - so always prepared for something different. Color is somewhat perfectly orange - not yellow and not quite red. Head disappears in less than 15 seconds. Smell and taste is somewhat sour with a hint of lemon plus the other ""odd"" fruits used to make this beer. Low ABV allows it to be somewhat a session beer (ignoring price) with a strong flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I probably would not go for this beer again but I am still glad I tried it. I am always happy to experiment with new beers styles and glad that Dogfish Head frequently provides this opportunity!"
""
""
"T: I was hoping for some bolder flavors but this is actually good. Some hints of white peach, doughy yeast, cereal malt and some faint indistinguishable spices. Leaves a bit of a tart aftertaste. A very different beer. I don't know if I'd do it again, but it's a cool experiment."

"Overall – This beer is crisp, easy drinking and has some wonderful flavors. It is a very good brew, although I am not sure it is quite worth the price you will pay for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer is ok. Its a bit too sweet for me."
""
"Re-tick! This one pours a light bodied bright gold in color with a one finger white head. The nose is light and spicy. It has bready light spicing and of course specific fruit and spice that I'm not familiar with. The flavors folks suit. It is light and lager esque with an interesting array of spices. It drinks very light in body. As an ancient recipe, I could see this one being quite.popular and somewhat unique. It has more flavor than English ales. That's funny, almost two thousand years ahead of the Brits. This one is worth a try for novelty's sake."
""
""
" Caramelized malt clings to the roof of the mouth with sweet fruit caressing the tongue. Fruit is a bit plum-like. No hops sensed. Malt and fruit/spice dominant. Light on the palate yet complex enough to keep you wondering."
""
""
"Aroma is - like no other beer I have tried. I got some chalky and tuna whiffs, as well as malt, fruit and what must have been chamomile. Or was it the za'atar? It pours a clear solar yellow with an average, small-bubbled white head that leaves some OK lacing. Flavor is distinctive, if not fabulous, with a malty core, a fruity undertone, and notes of - what? Must be the za'atar. There is a whisper of something like tuna salad. Smooth texture has slightly above-average body and some good fizz. Even if this is not an outstanding beer, definitely worth a try just because it is so distinctive and unusual."
""
""
"The flavor is truly interesting. There is an exotic twist that is delivered mostly through the chamomile, though the fruit and special wheat do make a difference. The mouthfeel, however, was not as successful. It is fine that the beer had a light mouthfeel, but the watery nature to the finish distracts from the interesting flavor. Overall, this beer is worth trying, but it is not a ""hoard"" beer (a beer so good you buy as much of it as you can when you can). If they brewed it again, I would like to see a bit more heft in the body."
""
""
"Ta Henket’s a very good brew, drinkable and flavorful. I'd buy a six pack if it was available in small format. Too bad it's so expensive."
""
"O - One of the more enjoyable Dogfish Head experimental/ancient beers I've had. Light and easy drinking, quite complex and interesting. Not sure it is something I'd seek out again, but glad to have tried it...and I'd definitely have it again willingly if placed in front of me."
"Tasting this unique brewing approach, some getting used to it will take place. Wheat and chamomile are dominating. Bread, spices and tart will follow.this medium to light bodied beer is full of surprises. Interesting brewing."
"Pours a clear golden-hay color with a fluffy white head. Smells a bit like a saison, but with some interesting spices in there. Unfortunately there's also a smell that is somewhat akin to styrofoam that throws things off a bit. Flavor is certainly interesting and unique, though I can't say it's my favorite. There is a mix of spices that I can't quite identify here. It's very light and somewhat saisony, but the spices make it less refreshing than it could be. Mouthfeel is VERY light with some pretty big-time carbonation. It's a little too overcarbonated for my tastes, but it's not a huge problem. Overall, this is an interesting experiment, but it doesn't quite come together as well as it could. If you could eliminate a bit of the off flavors and aromas, it could've been a nice spicy saison, but it falls a bit short."
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Lots of different and unique flavors mixed in, but the overall beer is nice and balanced and very sessionable."
""
"Drinkability- I like it a lot. It is very smooth and refreshing."
""
"O: An interesting, but uninspiring, beer. Drinkable, pleasant, but ultimately meh."
""
""
""
""
"O - Unusual. If you aren't into spices, you may want to steer clear. The overriding smell and back end taste are unique. Could use some more heft."
""
"o - not a fan. Average compared to other beers but lacking when it comes to Dogfish Head ones. Felt a little underwhelmed with this one."
""
""
""
""
"o - this was a completely different experience than when i had it on tap and completely unenjoyable to say the least. i'm pretty disappointed because i remember actually liking this one a lot. maybe aging it for a few months ruined it, but i don't see how as it wasn't that long of a time span."
""
"D - Sam and Dogfish always try to push the bounds and do something very unique... They've certainly achieved that here and while I typically am a huge fan of there endeavors, this one was a struggle... I couldn't recommend in good faith to anyone than those seeking a truly unique beer and have a very open mind... I can honestly say that I would have no interest in drinking again..."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in late 2011(first bottling). Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a small 1 finger fairly dense white head with poor retention that reduces to a ring of lacing. Minimal glass lacing, and a slight stream of carbonation coming up. Aromas of chamomile, biscuit, pepper, black tea, lemon, herbs, grass, light citrus, honey, and yeast funk, and spiciness. Very interesting and odd aromas; but I wasn’t sure what to expect. Taste is more pleasant than the aromas: honey, lemon, herbs, chamomile, black tea, grass, licorice, wheat, bread, pepper, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of herbs, black tea, wheat, citrus, and spices on the finish for a bit. Nice flavor balance and good complexity. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth mouthfeel. A touch watery feeling, but still has plenty of flavor. No alcohol noticed on the taste or finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is a damn nice ancient ale recreation from Dogfish Head once again. Nice balance and good complexity with easy drinking. They did a great job on this. Definitely enjoyed this one."
"A good beer on the whole, but very middle of the road. More interesting is the story of the egyptian yeast, but doesn't offer up too much beside that"
"O- Very different brew for sure. I really like the idea and the attempt at history on this brew."
""
""
"O - Ok, nothing I need again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The taste is certainly better than the strange scent implies. An interesting experiment leaves me strangely drawn to wanting more despite not being too enamored; mildly repellant, oddly attractive."
"One of the downsides of this beer i'm noticing however is that it gets pretty phenolic after a bit almost band aid like. Maybe the bottle is best split amongst friends."
""
"Notes: Maybe one the best new big bottle releases from DFH I have tried in the last year or beyond… Nice to try and in the right context this could work great socially. The background is stimulating enough as it is, with the idea of a brew aiming at cloning ancient Egyptian brews, then tailored and upgraded to contemporary palates, I sure would have loved to try a sample with the sulphur, but how they got rid of it and let the fruit shine is quite nice too. Not top tier of their historic brews, but something that I might repeat..."
"Overall: Can't complain at all, most of the time when I think of DFH, I think of their stronger beers and ales...this is something unique that you would definitely love image summer months. Salud!"
""
""
"Interesting beer. A bit thin and watery and the spicing is not overdone. The funk from the wild yeast is very mild, hard to imagine a wild yeast not yeilding a product that is even remotely sour."
"O: Very interesting light brew in DFH's expanding ancient beer series, the Middle Eastern ingredients are like a history lesson on the palate. The 4.5% ABV is quite manageable, but I'd be searching for just the right pairing to have more than one glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - very unique, a must try, but I doubt I will repeat it"
"Nose is a bit sour, herby, slightly sulferous. Pours out dark yellow with huge frothy white head. Head reduces to a foamy film.No lacing at all. Taste is surprizingly mild. No bitterness, unhopped. Bready with a hint of chamomile and somewhat figgy (doum fruit?). I can see the Pyramid builders having something very much like this, very nice."
"O-this is definitely a unique beer. it reminds me of an oktoberfest style with a middle eastern touch to it! its extremely drinkable and has a such a nice and balanced complexity considering the low ABV"
""
""
"Overall - In the end, you have to take Ta Henket for what it is. The Ancient Ales are always interesting, so I had to take a step back and appreciate this beer from the perspective of what went into it. It tasted quite unrefined and rugged and while there was definitely a plain/bland quality to the depth of the beer, I picture it being an everyday brew of the masses in ancient Egypt. An interesting experience that I enjoyed. I have to say that the presence of chamomile was most intriguing as it really came through in the finished product!"
""
""
""
"O: I'm not a huge fan of chamomile, which probably prejudices me against this one. As a historian, I was really hoping to like this one, but... eh."
""
"Overall-I like this beer and I don't like it, I see what DFH was going for but I think it could've been executed better. Still a very unique brew."
""
"Overall: A very unique and enjoyable beer. Another unique exhibition by Dogfish."
"Pours a clear light orange with a puffy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. There is no lacing on the drink down. Smell is of grains and herbs that I cannot identify. Taste is of grains, herbs, and spices. There is a slightly spice forward aftertaste with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer for what it is but not something I could drink an entire bottle of. Very interesting story behind this one and I am glad I was able to try it."
""
"O: A Solid beer overall, a little less flavorful than I was expecting, but is solid against the style. Definitely would buy again, this is a great session beer."
"Overall/Drinkability: A very unusual beer. Glad I tried it but I can’t see getting it again. A beer worth expanding the palate with, and maybe with a pizza rather than the crab cakes I had, it would work even better, but by itself, just interesting to see an potential take on an ancient style, but not an everyday drinkable beer. However, I will again give it points for being such a creative and palate challenging beer."
"Drink- Won't creep up the ladder as a favorite of mine from DFH, but I am intriqued by what Sam and staff put out and will keep trying their beers."
"Into a wine glass pours a bright and clear yellow gold under a very thin head. Aroma is of mild earthy zesty fruit. Light bodied malt feel with a crisp carbonation sets forth a very subtle but flavorful blend of delicate herbs and fruit. The phrase ""less is more"" comes to mind here and I can't help but think of how much I'd like to introduce this to my green folk who ""don't like beer""..."
"Overall I think this beer is greater than the sum of its parts. I was especially interested to have it after seeing its creation on ""Brew Masters."" Was it worth trying? Certainly. Would I have it again? Probably not."
""
"O - Without a doubt, I have never had a beer quite like this before, and probably never will again. What brought me to try this beer was the Brew Masters ""Ancient Ale"" episode where Dogfish Head goes through a painstaking process to reproduce an ancient Egyptian beer recipe, dubbed Ta Henket. After watching their dedication and creativity hard at work, I can truly appreciate getting to finally experience this beer. I'll be honest though, I'm not sure how the Egyptians managed to drink this on a regular basis (I assume). After drinking a bomber, I realized two things: 1) A single bomber was more than enough for me, and 2) Beer has come a looong way over the last several thousand years. Evolution is a beautiful thing."
""
"Overall it was not good, and did not get better as I downed more of the bottle. I love trying new styles and experimental beers, but this was just not good at all to me and the taste and aroma were so far off that I couldn’t finish the bomber. Thankfully I have a 120 Minute IPA in my beer fridge to remind me of why I love DogFish Head, so I’ll give them another mulligan on this one; this was a valiant effort at recreating history, but this beer could have stay buried with the Lost Ark out in the desert."
"Dogfish Head certainly is a trailblazer. Ta Henket is one of its beers where the back story is a little better than the beer. Frankly, it just doesn’t have enough flavor to be a standout success. It’s not a total disaster. Maybe worth a try."
"This beer may have been hard for me to describe due to the ingredients. However, it is solid and different from the usual examples of the style. They are constantly trying to out-do themselves with each new release. I like it."
"O: Definitely an interesting beer, a distinct herbal flavour, so those that don't like that might want to stay away. But for the adventurous, this is worth a buy."
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a snifter. No head, with a slightly hazed, vibrant, honey-gold coloring. Light nose, with honey, bready, and earthy notes, all roasted into a subtle blending. Some interesting spice on the nose, too. Flavors are roasted, and almost tea like in nature, with a earthy and spicy profile that is light on the tongue but fills the sinuses. Honey sweet highlights, along with some floral essences keep the palate light and interesting. The beer is smooth initially, but the light body becomes sharp towards the end of the palate when the spicing becomes more prominent. The aftertaste is honeysuckle sweet and herby, leading to a light, clean finish. This beer is an interesting rollercoaster for the senses in both taste and feel. Pretty tasty."
"O- blah. This one is a miss from Dogfish. Hopefully, it was a one off"
""
"O: Aside from the smell, this beer was very enjoyable and extremely easy to drink given the low abv. A bit pricey overall, but certainly worth a try at least once"
"O: I enjoy midas touch and jumped at the chance to snag a bottle of this beer. As long as you are open about it being a departure from the standard drinking experience you should find it enjoyable."
"Ehh, it’s ok. Gotta give props to DFH for continuing to push the envelope here."

"C+"
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange amber with attractive lively carbonation. One finger moderate bubble white head that had good retention largely due to the continual carbonation. Earthy herbal aroma, probably due to the za'atar, unidentifiable exotic fruit, which is appropriate, somewhat musky. This is definitely outside the range of standard beer aroma, but it is intriguing. Definitely the most unusual flavored beer I've ever had. Light malt, wheat, oregano or thyme, somewhat nutty, and a hint of citrus; finishes with nutty sweet malt. There is a distinct flavor in the finish that reminded me of something I'd tasted before and it just came to me; a flavor very reminiscent of genmaicha, the toasted rice green tea from Japan. This is very enjoyable, the flavor combination really worked for me. Light to moderate body as expected for the ABV. No one has an absolute idea of what these early proto-beers tasted like, but this is as good a guess as any with interesting regional spices and a definite refreshing quality. This is an experiment that worked out quite nicely. I will definitely buy this again if it ever becomes available."

"O/D-Strange beer. I didn't hate it. Kinda glad I tried it. Gimmicky in my opinion, but it could have been worse. Perhaps the most memorable beer I had all night."
"D - not bad, it is light and weirdly earthy, but I find it to be strangely drinkable, kind if like a midas touch light."
"Single finger thick head with nice lacing on a slightly hazy golden body. Aroma is mostly light grain and malt but not very overwhelming. The flavor is interesting. I am getting a strong gingerbread flavor throughout however initially a grainy and pale malt flavor is present. Corn note and semisweet finish. Light bodied and moderate carbonation. This one is actually very drinkable and with the right amount if sweetness."
"The pour is fairly uninspiring, a deeper gold color with a tiny head. The aroma is spicy, fruity, and bitter. Smells interesting for sure. The taste is smooth at first, with a nice hit of wheat and herbs, then the spices roar in for the finish. The aftertaste lingers pleasantly with a touch of wheat and a nice spiced flavor. The mouthfeel is fairly light but nicely drying. Overall, an interesting beer that manages to skirt the Dogfish curse of being too sweet. It's probably a touch expensive, but it's a solid experience I'd recommend."

"O: Decent beer – not my favorite Dogfish head beer. Surprising low ABV for a dogfish head beer."
"O - It would be an good/average sessionable beer if not for the sourness which makes it taste like it has gone bad. I guess it is just ""different."""
"M: Initial thought: spicy but not quite as exotic tasting as the hieroglyphics would indicate."

"D - Great smell, even as the taste is completely different and unexpected; of all the ""Occasional Rarities"" that they put out, this is by far one of the few I would ever purchase again; while I have enjoyed some of the other ""Rarities"" in the past, I found them to be too much for my palate"

"4.0 D: I gotta give DFH a lot of credit for brewing something like this. It's superbly interesting, which is always welcome since everyone else is doing what everyone else is doing. I don't know if I'd want to drink this more than once a year, but it's a good departure from the norm."
""

"O - This has good drinkability. It is smooth, has nice flavor, and I would have no problem downing a few glasses of this one. Overall, I think it is a really cool and interesting beer. I love i can get a chance to taste something similar to what people brewed and drank so long ago. There is some nice sweetness and bread-like flavors in this beer, and I really enjoyed the spice notes. I didn't think they were too aggressive, and I think they worked well. I definitely think this one is worth trying, and I would drink it again."
"O - I liked this much more than expected given some of the hate floating around this beer. perhaps this is just the culmination of hipster backlash to Dogfish Head's success: the beer that symbolized the Brewmasters television show - the show being the embodiment of publicly selling out to some people. I say, get over yourselves, this was a fun experiment. If you expect this to be a daily drinker or insta-whale you're looking at it all wrong. I would never want to drink this regularly, but once in a while this could prove to be a fun change of pace."

"o - Overall an interesting beer, but wasn't a huge fan, and I normally like DFH beers. A bit weird and full of spices, I wouldn't seek this one out again."
"Overall: Interesting, from archeological point of view, but not something I would revisit"
"Seriously, if you can get past the smell, it's a pretty good beer."
"RVI"
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, floral, and nutty. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, nutty, perfume, toasted malt, and spices. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was an average brew. Nothing on this one really stood out to me at all. It was fairly complex, but it seemed like everything in this one was just clashing with each other. Worth trying to say you did, but not that impressive for my palate."
"Overall: this is an interesting beer that is a slow sipper. Another beer worth seeking out to at least give it a try. This may not be a beer you want to constantly drink, but it will shake the taste buds up."
"The pour is a very clear golden color with a short lived but tall white head. Smells strongly of cereal and grain, but very clean. Lots of bread, maybe even some corn bread, and tons of wheat. Maybe a little bit of yeast, too. The flavor is more of the same. Quite malty, but not overly sweet. Very bready with the same wheat and corn bread flavors. Some yeast as well. Medium body with medium carbonation."
""
"Overall, a weird beer that seems a bit out of place. The flavors are light, but never seem to come together in any meaningful way. The sugar content of the fruit combined with the additional sugar makes it too sweet too. A bit odd and too pricey for me to purchase again."
"Overall, it's difficult to find a way to objectively rate this as a beer, since it bears very little resemblance to anything else on the market. The beverage is certainly palatable and delicious on some levels, and if not told this was a beer--if, say, I were in Egypt and told this was a locally-made and traditional alcoholic beverage--I would think it excellent. The buttered toast and chamomile flavors are a bit strong (and I admittedly am not a fan of chamomile tea), but there are enough funky sugar flavors to bring me back for another mouthful. Definitely worth trying, even if only for the experience."
"Overall, this was really an odd one. I appreciate what Dogfish is doing in beers like this, but it's not great. Still not a bad beer though. Glad I got to experience it the once, but that will probably be it for this one."
"O - Mouthfeel and appearence are weak for a traditional beer, but I think this is what they were going for according to the style. Pretty good overall, drinkable, well balanced"
""
""
""
"I did noticed some of the flavors disappearing after the beer had warmed up a little towards room temp, I would recommend having this beer cold. It also has the smooth, crisp dryness of a decent lager or pilsener which I found quite nice."
"Pours a monumental head that fills half the glass with wispy of-white foam, not much retention, dissolves without dimpling, the microbubbles all knit together, average lacing, not a lot but what’s there sticks in wide splotches. Copper orange to yellow in color, decent clarity, hue depth also adequate, like zero bubbles to be seen, kinda just looks like “beer.” The nose is quiet to subtle, brown bread crust, pretzel dough, salt and pepper, orange to lemon reduction, peach, apricot, pear and melon fruit scents, the chamomile comes through clearly, honey and then some cloves but really no one element leaps out at you here. Medium-bodied, more savory than sweet, carbonation is low but still more than you’d expect from visual inspection, salt, pepper, sage, rosemary, metallic flecks and a light pinch of clove and cumin. The chamomile more muted here, however, the orange, lemon, white grapefruit citrus lasts fully throughout. As in the nose, mildly surprising strength in the apricot, peach, apple, melon fruit, nothing too sweet but ripe and consistent. The herbaceous element rises as it warms. As with many one-off beers from this producer it very credibly feels as if it was made according to some exacting ancient recipe. Naturally, this can be a good or a bad thing."

"Overall Impression- While having the chance to buy this @ Bruisin Ales (for $10+), I'm glad I didn't! This sure is an ""Ancient Ale"" and wouldn't let anyone around me make the mistake of buying this one. Such a shame because I've enjoyed almost ALL DogFish Head brews..."
""
"Bottle poured into a snifter. This is a light golden color, light and especially fizzy. Smells are some interesting hard-to-place spices. Wow, the taste is pretty out there. With all of the oddball ingredients (za'atar, doum fruit, chamomile, emmer farro', and free-range Egyptian yeast), it isn't too much of a surprise this tastes like nothing I've had before. The combination yields a pretty woody-flavored taste, very light, crisp, and barely alcoholic. It is different and worth trying at least once, although not one I will probably come back to often."
""
"M: light/medium bodied; mouthfeel is nice, just the right amount of carbonation. Very light and at 4.5% ABV, a very quaffable brew. Overall, I most likely wouldn't try it again, but recommend you try it at least once."
"Really interesting beer. Poured a nice light golden color with minimal lacy head. The aroma is just plain funky. I can't really place it, but it's really not that appealing. On the other hand, it tastes way better than it smells. It's really hard to describe the taste, I don't even know what 1/2 of the ingredients in the beer are. Still, it's floral, earthy, and utterly unique. Very drinkable and doesn't last long on the tongue. Very interesting beer."
"OK. I didn't finish."
""
"overall i'm a big fan of this beer, and glad i dropped 12 bucks on this unique style of beer!"
"Overall not that appealing to me, however, I appreciate the effort in attempting to replicate an ancient beer. Its worth trying, I'm glad I did, but once is enough."
""
"O - Probably the best new Dogfish Head beer I've had in a while, I hope we see this again!"

"O: Split with friends to try, don't expect much. A few friends liked it, but a few of us didn't."
""
"Notes: Besides the chamomile, I have no idea what any of these fruits and spices are. Between the exotic spices and the funk, I think many will be turned off by it. It is what it is though, and I applaud Dogfish Head for having the guts to put this into production. As always, it's great to see a brewery showing respect for thousands of years of brewing history. Still, I can't quite recommend it. It's not bad, and I'm very glad I tried it, but I don't think it's something I would buy again."

"O: Definitely a beer worth trying. Probably a better summer beer than anything."

"O - Overall this was a swing and miss for me. Very underwhelmed by this beer had such high hopes only to have them dashed. Way not worth the price point."
"O – Odd. Not bad certainly, not great. It has an interesting taste structure that I can appreciate and find oddly tasty. I wouldn’t drink a bunch of it but I would not turn another down. Worth a try."
"That is some cool shit."
"Kudos to DFH for having the balls to put this into production."

"Normally I'm a nut when it comes to dogfish head's crazy concoctions... this beer is not one of their better experiments in recreating ancient ales. The beer port gold with a white head that dispenses quickly. Smell is like wheat and some muddled herbs, pretty boring. Taste starts out like an ok wheat ale that quickly turns into a guessing game trying to figure out what the heck that finish is. The mouthfeel makes it almost feel flat, not much buble, not much feel. Asside from some peculiar tastes that aren't great but aren't offensive either, it's a pretty meh beer. It wouldn't be horrible if it wernt 14 bucks. It actually may have been better warm."
"I had expected it to be an indescribable mess, but wanted to try it since (like a lot of others) saw the Brewmasters episode where they conceived this one. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked this and could see how someone would accept two gallons of this stuff as a day's wages for work on the pyramids."
""
""
"Poured in a DFH pint glass. Semi-clear golden color with copious amounts of carbonation and bubbles rising to the top. The smell is almost undiscribable. Aromas of fermented fruit, strange herbs, and perhaps chili peppers? The taste only somewhat reflects the smell. Extremely smooth, and at 4.5 ABV, very easy to drink. Strange, almost spoiled yeast taste that I have never encountered, but was pleasant to my Hefeweisen loving palate. I fully enjoyed it. There has been alot of bad reviews for this beer, but if one takes the time to disect each flavor, and takes into conscideration the effort in gathering of the ingredients, I think it can be a great drinking experience. DFH has done it again with the Ancient Brew series. Nice work Sam! Priced at $14.50 for a 750ml, it is inline with the other DFH special brews, which is steep, but the quality speaks for it self. This is the only DFH beer my wife has enjoyed. Prost!"
""
""
"O - Did not enjoy this. I'm usually a big fan of these crazy dogfish head beers including the ancient ales. This was pretty terrible though. I respect the history and work that went into it, but its just awful. Waste of money..."
"Simple, savory-- seems like what an ancient proto-bread-beer would probably be like, or maybe a really light kvass."
""
"Truly unique ancient ale from DFH."
"I'm thoroughly enjoying the uniqueness of this beer. It's not the best beer I've ever had, but its very interesting and fun to dissect as it is so subtley complex and unique. Some will say that its just another gimmick from DFH, but its still a cool concept regardless. I like their ancient ales series and I'm very glad they take the time to make sure that they're not another cookie cutter brewery. They owe their great success to that."
"Got a chance to try this over New Years, interesting beer to say the least. First off... cannot get over the pizza flavors, specifically pepperoni pizza. A previous reviewer mentioned pizza flavored goldfish crackers which is exactly what it reminds me of. Nice bubbly, golden color in the glass.. taste is again quite odd. Seems to be a lot of different flavors going on with fruits/spices my mouth has never tastes before. Also get a random whiff of tuna? Yeah.. I'll leave it at that. I love DFH and I think the historical beers are amazing ideas and great to talk about in conversation, but this is a miss for me."
"O: Overall this would make a good marinade for chicken or something, but it's not really my idea of a good beer. If DFH makes ""off centered"" beers...this one is an ""off the rocker"" beer...the only thing that really saves it is how interesting of a story it has, which overall makes it slightly interesting to try. As a beer though, I wouldn't recommend or drink it again. Egyptian ingredients...maybe...snake oil...maybe..."
""
"O: This beer is not as undrinkable as some have made it out to be, but that is not saying that it is not one of Dogfish Head's lesser efforts. Unfortunately, the generic appearance, horrible combination of scents on the nose, and bloating, gassy mouthfeel conspire to ruin this beer. I'm glad I got to try this one, but I will not be purchasing it again."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought this was an awful beer. Nothing in it worked for me and I can't drink more than a few sips of this. What a waste of $14. This is definitely one of the worst beers, if not the worst beer I've ever had."
"O: a very unique ale. Would definitely recommend. Definitely likable and approachable. Even my wife liked it. My hat is off to DFH for always pushing the envelope."
"Beer is grainy, arid on the finish. Harsh, difficult to drink. Some tea comes through, a few spices but there is the underlying sulfury harshness that I can't support. Nope, not again."
"Pours a clear golden orange color with no head only edging and it leaves little to no lace on the glass. The aroma is of bread and nuts with some smokiness to it. The taste has a bread and nut backbone with a slight smokiness to it. There are also some notes of spice along with a fruit sweetness at the end. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it was a solid beer, it grows on you as you drink it. It is for sure worth a try."
""
"750 ml bottle. Served in a Dogfish Head pint glass, the beer pours a clear golden/orange color with about an inch frothy white head that stayed around for a while. There's a good amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is bready, fruity and a bit herbal. I notice some wheat and bready malt, but there's also a weird fruity aroma (which I guess is the doum fruit stated on the label), and some herbs and spices that I can't identify. The brew tastes like wheat/grain, yeast, sweet fruit and some herbs and spices (I think that's the za 'atar on the label). Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's moderately carbonated and easy enough to drink. I liked this brew more the longer I drank it. It's unusual (which was to be expected), but I thought it was good overall. I'd buy it again. $11.99 a bottle."
""
""
""
"O: A unique beer, but I enjoy it. It's definitely too expensive to convince me to buy another bottle, but it's tasty and smells good with a nice body. If it came in sixers for around the price of a single bottle, I would definitely buy more of it."
""
"Overall: This is a really different beer. I enjoyed my sample enough, but would have been upset if I had paid for a whole bottle. Glad I tried it, but probably won't have it again."
""
""
"O- I really enjoyed this beer. I can see how people are disliking this beer, but I think Dogfish Head did a great job with this beer. Going into this with an open wind is helpful, this is not a normal beer, but a unique and different beer that has a lot going on for 4.5% ABV. I will be picking this up again!"
""
"Overall - a disappointment compared to their other beers."
"Poured a crystal clear golden orange color from a 750ml into a Duvel tulip. Looks and smells similar to that of a domestic light beer, more over much like the Dfh Pearl Jam beer even a little sweet and yeasty. It's hard to judge the taste of this beer considering I don't know what ""doum fruit"" "emmer farro"" and ""za'atar"" are supposed to taste like. I certainly haven't picked up on the chamomile. It has a unique taste overall, I get an almost pepper like taste during and aftertaste. sweet fruit, and yeast spice."
""
"This is the first beer in over a year that I have not been able to drink simply due to flavor. Poured out half a glass and ended up with a horrible headache from drinking this beer. I really thought this would be good after watching the brewmasters episode about this. However, when you push the boundaries of beer, you're bound to make something bad. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
""
""
"Split a bottle of this with a good friend of mine tonight as a nightcap from a long Christmas day. This was something I had been hoping to try since I saw the episode of brewmasters that was about this beer. The beer poured out as a much clearer than expected gold color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer was sweet and had some earthy spice notes on the nose. The taste of this was really interesting to me, I was very pleased with the pepper like flavors I kept getting with every sip. There is a subtle sweetness in there too which I liked. The mouthfeel was well carbonated and had a light body to it. Overall I thought that this beer was a very nice addition to ancient ales the DfH puts out. I have always found these to really spark my interest. I would drink it again for sure!"
"Comparisons to buckwheat meads come to mind because of the smoky sweet (nearly mesquite) character, but the beer holds back on the richer molasses-like flavor and feel of those meads. Instead a licorice note of fruit and spice accompanies the lighter-than-expected body from mid palate through medium fruity finish."
""

""
""
"Cheers"
"Overall, an interesting concept but not for me. The flavor just doesn't agree with my palette. Again, I have to give DFH credit for pushing the envelope with their Ancient Ales programs. However, every time I drink an ancient ale, I'm glad we've come so far with brewing and beer."
"Wow, just terrible. I actually took a few sips and it kept getting worse. I'm going to have nightmares about this one."
""
""
"O: This is pretty terrible. Waste of 12 bucks."
""
"I recommend this one to people who are fans of the Ancient Ales series, and know what to expect in this type of adventurous beverage."
"I am not the biggest fan. A lot of unique flavors here."
""
"O-Not that good, but extremely interesting. Don't think I'd ever have it again but like everything DFH does it is an adventure."
""
""
"I can certainly see where they were going with this. It was interesting to drink something based on an ancient recipe, something I like a lot about this series. Ta Henket, however, was probably my least favorite of all of them. It's not that it's necessarily a bad beer but it's nothing I'd buy another bottle of. Fun to try, but I don't need this one again."
"Overall, at 4.5% I think this packs a lot of flavor and is a nice session beer at the brewpub. At $12 bomber though it's a nice treat yet doesn't leave you banged up so you can have another. Just a solid beer and good addition to the Ancient Ale series."
""
""
"O: This is probably the best ""big bottle"" DFH beer I have had in a quite some time besides BBrew. It's an easy drinking beer that many would enjoy once they get past the different smells that they might not know."
"Light bodied with good carbonation. I picked up a bottle and I hope that this one sees distribution soon in PA!"
"Clear golden color with a slight, white head, that soon disappeared almost completely. After a short waft, I could tell this was going to be a very unique one: scents of wheat bread, grains, a light sweetness, and a certain ""I don't know what"" that I supposed was attributable to the wild yeast and other unique ingredients--I've never had ""Dom palm fruit"" so I don't really know what it smells or tastes like, but presumably, that's a big factor here. Very full and in-your-face taste right up front, and the best way I could describe what I experienced was chicken boullion, which I got a strong sensation of up front. After that, flavors of wheat bread, raw grains, raw sugar, and light spice. It was hard at first for me to tell if I actually like the beer or not, because I've really never tasted anything like it. Medium mouthfeel, thick and chewy, considering how light the beer actually looks. Definitely drinkable, but I wouldn't want it in large quantities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: In a word, different. I liked it, but it was a little boring. If this gets bottled, and added to the ancient ales lineup, I look forward to trying it again."
"O - Very complex. One of the most unique beers I've ever encountered as far as flavor. While it does have a lot of ""new to me"" flavors its fairly easy on the palate as they all work well together to a focused center. This could easily be a session beer. I'm hoping that this one eventually gets bottled."
"O: Very drinkable and would definitly order this again without hesitation."
"In perspective, the taste is more tea-like than beer-like - I hate to say bland - perhaps expecting something more potent all around. Didn't help that there wasn't much malt sweetness - it drank fairly thin and dry. Such criticisms, such conditioned expectations shouldn't apply here, however. This is what I've been waiting for from the Ancient Ales. Something unique, something foreign (and I don't mean Belgium), something that truly stands out and inspires. I wholeheartedly appreciate the effort taken here do create something interesting. Thank you. Can't wait to try it again."
"Unique beer with a mild flavor, overall mostly appealing for its novelty but not quite fantastic. Still, good and refreshing and definitely worth trying if you can catch it."
" Light with good carbonation, slightly sticky. Not my favorite experimental dfh but definitely a tasty brew."
