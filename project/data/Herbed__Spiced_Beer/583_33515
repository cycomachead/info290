3.92,6.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"It may not be the Christmas season anymore, but the weather's close enough for me not to care too much right now.  This stuff pours a clear midnight amber-tawny topped by a finger of pale khaki foam.  The nose comprises candied orange peel, light cocoa, brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel, allspice, ginger, and a touch of sweetbread.  The taste brings in more of the same, the caramel drying out to a graham cracker-like situation and taking a back seat to the panoply of spices in play.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a tasty, spicy brew for these still-frigid times.","TMoney2591","Feb 18, 2015"
2.8,-23.9,3.5,2.75,2.75,2.75,2.75,"Deep amber-gold color with small head and average lacing. Aroma is full of nutmeg and other dry spice. Taste is similar with a mouthful of dry spice, especially nutmeg, alittle too much. Feels ok on thr palate and definitely has an alcohol burn. Overall, not that pleasant of a beer, maybe just my taste...","hophugger","Feb 13, 2015"

A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the glass in small spots. The aroma is very pleasant and is of sweet caramel malts with spices. Even more going on with the taste as the mix of spices (cloves, hint of ginger and juniper berries) with some orange zest. Very smooth and goes down easy. Love the mix of the above flavors on this seasonal brew. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Another great brew from Schlafly. MERRY CHRISTMAS!","BeerWithMike","Dec 23, 2014"

Looks like I am going to have a +rdev on this one based on the other scores. I think it could do without the orange/citrus aspect, and it does seem slightly boozy for what it is. However, it is an excellent winter warmer that I would likely enjoy again… if I wasn't surrounded by Great Lakes and Thirsty Dog :)","WesMantooth","Nov 21, 2014"

I tasted all the aforementioned spices built atop a solid caramel malt backbone with only light hopping which gave it a nice finish. Balanced and not overly spiced as many holiday ales tend to be. Additionally, there was almost no sign that the beer was 8% ALC and I didn’t realize it until after I’d enjoyed a few!

While the hops are there, the sweetness of the orange combines with the malt to create a beer that can be a bit of a toothache.

It tastes pretty much the same as it smells, but the clove flavor is the strongest. Also, I think it tastes more spicy than sweet. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated.

If I find it on tap again, I might try it again. But there are so many other fall ales that they have leftover by the time its around that it will probably get washed over by the fall leftovers and the spring releases.

A little lighter, but definitely Christmas: clove, cinnamon and nutmeg. Maybe a hint of orange. Taste if pretty good. Malt, clove, cinnamon, a touch of orange and pine.

Pine and citrus from the hops, an herbal character that I can't entirely describe, and a blend of spices with clove, cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Orange peel isn't as noticeable here, for some reason.There's a bitterness present that reminds me of grains of paradise for some reason. The alcohol is rather noticeable, even when cold, making this harsher than it needs to be. The booze also makes this more noticeably medicinal, which isn't entirely appealing. Medium in body with a high level of carbonation that is surprisingly creamy, this feels decent on the palate. Mildly bitter and mildly herbal on the finish, this is decent.

First taste yields a surprising amount of bitterness followed by a hefty and clear amount of alcohol warmth. Heavy handed carbonation keeps things from getting overpowered. Graham cracker sweetness starts up front, giving way to a cinnamon bitterness. Reminds me of their Pumpkin Ale, though with a slightly different spicing regimin. If I had to choose between the two I'd go with the Pumpkin, though this certainly isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination.

It tastes pretty much the same as it smells, but the clove flavor is the strongest. Also, I think it tastes more spicy than sweet. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, the alcohol in this brew is well hidden. However due to the amount of spice in this beer, I don't think I could drink more than 2 or 3 of these at a time.

Malty caramel malts in the nose as well. Flavor is of fresh spices and clove with a pumkin like taste. What I do enjoy about the flavor is that it's not over-aggressive like many spiced beers are. Subtle hop and malt balance, but they're a bit hidden. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a powerful carbonation. I was hoping this one would be a bit smoother in the mouth. I didn't even check the abv until about half way through the tasting and I was shocked to see the 8%. bort11 gave me two of these, one to try now and one to cellar.

This beer just looks good. Spotty lacing is left inside the large snifter I'm using for this beer. The nose is the Holidays in a glass. Strong aromas of holiday spices (cloves, cinnamon and citrus). Behind the spicy notes is a very pleasant roasted malt character. Smells festive in every way. The palate doesn't disappoint either - spices up front, intermixed with aggressive floral hops and dominant citrus notes (bitter orange peel, mostly). Due to the liberal use of hops in this beer, you get an over all dry taste with a lot going on in the back of the mouth. The finish is very herbal and citric, without being medicinal or cloying at all. Beautifully crafted. The mouth feel is medium and very fluid. The 8% ABV is well-masked in my opinion, but opens up a bit as the beer warms. I believe this to be one of my very favorite Christmas beers. It's very well balanced, incredibly tasty te. This is a nicely balanced spiced Christmas beer that is quite enjoyable. It's the type of beer I'd hit up for a and a nice departure from the typical winter warmer. For me, the citrus and bold hop presence makes this beer. These characteristics could well be why some won't like this beer, but it's what makes it stand out of the crown for me.

Smells like christmas. Piney, nutmeg, cloves. Not bad. The taste is overload of ginger, nutmeg, cloves, orange, pine... pretty much tastes like a christmas air freshener in beer form. On the plus side, the alcohol is very well hidden (errr... covered-up?). Mouthfeel is ok, a bit dry. Drinkability is hurt by the taste. But I bet if you simmered this stuff on the stove it would make your house smell really good.","shivtim","Dec 10, 2006"

Yeah, i know its a Christmas ale, and i know that some people like to put some spices in their Christmas drinks, but come on guys....this was just they dumped in a bunch of cloves and nutmeg and orange rind and figured that if you could taste all of that crap in the beer it would make it a good beer. I've all for those flavors in beer, now, dont get me wrong; but to the extent that they were all right up there hitting me in the tongue? and it was so muddled and unbalanced. Its the worst tasting spiced beer i've had since that Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin from 2 yeaers ago. way too many spices and it was a bit thin too. looked ok, and actually smelled fine, but yeah, downhill from there.","aforbes10","Nov 28, 2006"

3.75,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"It would be nice after shovling snow or just for holiday enjoyment. Medium/full bodied, nice mouthfeel and drinkable, but better for sipping. A little heavy on spices for pairing with most food but should be nice after dinner.","whynot44","Nov 22, 2006"
3.59,-2.4,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass, after a long day of eating turkey. Not a lot of head, leaves a very thin film of lace around the edges. Color is a warm orange-brown, hazy through the center with mild carbonation. Smell is of cloves, very strong and slightly bitter. Taste has a slightly bitter hardwood flavor with various spices mingling around the edges. More of the cloves, a bit of nutmeg. Finishes with some hop notes. Even though it is 8%, it doesn't feel as ""warm"" as some other winter warmers that are lower in ABV. It is an interesting beer, and one I will enjoy this holiday season. I think this one is better suited for after dinner rather witht he meal.","bort11","Nov 14, 2006"

3.98,8.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"It does hop bite just a tad too strong, a couple more malt seeds would have worked wonders. Oh well, it may be 8%, but I could drink these all evening long, although slowly.","Vancer","Nov 04, 2006"
