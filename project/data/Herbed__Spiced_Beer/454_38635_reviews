"I don't know if even the addition of pumpkin could have saved this one.  It was bad on so many levels."

"Overall: I rated it 3 across the board, but this is not good. That's average to most pumpkin beers though. This is a bottle of spices and little else."
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured with almost no head. Nothing stood out in the smell or the taste. It was not terrible taste just nothing stood out to make me ever want this again."

"Overall I thought this wasn't a good beer and i thought that it was a poor example of a Pumpkin Ale, instead of letting the pumpkin shine it was dominated by the cinnamon and that didn't let through any nice supporting flavors.  This beer didn't have good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, a little watery, not filling and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, I have no urge at all to drink another one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the only aspect that wasn't below average.  What I liked the least about this beer was taste, it just wasn't good and it didn't really have any redeeming aspects.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, now i see why i haven't had it in a couple years.  I wouldn't recommend this beer, it's just not a good example of the style.  All in all I didn't like this beer, Arcadia is a good brewery, but this isn't a good beer and I don't understand why they choose to release this below average Pumpkin Ale every year.  This is my least favorite beer from Arcadia and it's one of my least favorite Pumpkin Ales.  Better luck next time guys, this one needs some major work."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, fall 2014 bottling. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with god balance and solid complexity of dark/bready malt and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and solid complexity of dark/bready malt and spice flavors; with a good malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid spiced ale. Good balance and solid complexity of dark/bready malt and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A bit one dimensional, but nicely enjoyable otherwise."

"Fucking horrible. Undrinkable"

"PERFECT...Fall beer"
""
"I don't want to try this again."

"O- Probably one of the worst pumpkin beers I've had. No real balance in the flavor and the beer is pretty thin. There are many other pumpkin beers out there, I guess one plus on this one might be it's price, it comes in a 6 pack and is usually under 10 bucks."

"Pours clear golden orange with a small white head. Aroma includes citrus and nutmeg. Didn't taste the cinnamon at first but after I had a few sips it was prevalent. Could also taste some mild wheat notes. Would be difficult for me to drink while eating food due to its spicy cinnamon flavors."
""
""
""
""
"The best thing about this beer is that it looks like apple cider. And the bottle has some awesome artwork. The smell, oddly similar to over-ripe bananas, is off-putting. The flavor is lacking. There’s a harsh bite to it (someone called it sour and I agree), which makes it difficult to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"On balance, I like this beer. Maybe I'm just intoxicated by that pumpkin pie smell. The rest leaves a fair amount to be desired."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a great beer, lots of malty sweetness an a pumpkin pie taste if you think a pumpkin beer shuld taste like the pie this ones right up there in the top 10 maybe at 5 as pumpkin beers go this ones great!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So many better fall and pumpkin beers out there this one should be avoided."
"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a moderately fizzy mouthfeel at first, which gradually calms to a smooth and slightly foamy mouthfeel over a few seconds. Beer does not close dry, and leaves moderate stickiness on the lips and palate."

"Pours a clear copper color. Aroma of pumpkin pie spices and pumpkin. In the taste, strong all spice and raw cinnamon, just a little pumpkin flavor and tangy vegetable notes. Lots of spice, and a fair malt sweetness. Medium bodied feel with a strong carbonation. Overall, this is a decent pumpkin ale with lots of spices."

"EDIT: Read the description, I guess there wasn't supposed to be any pumpkin present. Those misleading bastards!"
""
""
"O - I recommend spending your next $5 elsewhere!"
""
"Arcadia has managed to capture and bottle the months of September through November and have made a near-perfect fall-time quaff; it's got me seeing bats and scarecrows and jack o-laterns as well as a bountiful dinning room table. Pumpkin Ale initiates will find love and even the style's most discerning critics shouldn't have much to bicker about. Greatly enjoyed!"
""
""
""
"Not a great pumpkin ale, but not terrible. I've had worse ones. Has an okay flavor and aroma with a slightly sub-par body. I probably wouldn't seek this one out again against other pumpkin ales, but I'm glad I tried it."
""
"This is a nice pumpkin spiced ale. It keeps its ale character while being spiced."
""
""
""
""
"O: When I first saw that this beer doesn't have any pumpkins in it, I thought that the balance might be off but the beer isn't really too spicy. It's definitely a nice beer for the fall, especially if you don't want something that's sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: spicy seasonal choice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Jaw-jacker is right. Doubt I'll be able to taste anything after this one. I do think there is an issue with this beer that was not intended."
""
"As it is, I find this beer to have below-average drinkability because of the unbalance. It really needs more sweetness. The spice mixture seems to contribute the right flavors to the beer, but for me there simply isn't enough sweetness to make it work properly. I'm afraid I didn't enjoy this one very much."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - What a joke. Good job at making a cinnamon beer Arcadia! I like how you added that faint hint of pumpkin in the flavor."

"Poures a light brown body with no head but a thin lace around the edge. the smell is well balanced of spices, cinnamon, nutmeg and some clove. the taste is the same asthe smell just you taste the spices, its like a brown ale with spices add to it. the mouth feel is good and overall a ok beer."
""
"So there's no pumpkin in this whatsoever it looks like. Nothing on the bottle or 6 pack box says anything about pumpkin being in this. Weird. They sure make it ""look"" like there's pumpkin in it. Oh well, 12oz bottle pours copper with a fluffy off-white head, good head retention & lacing. Funky aroma, earthy, spicy, cinnamon. Odd flavors are dominated by the spices. Cinnamon, allspice, & nutmeg, earthy hop, caramel, rye bread come to mind. Body is thin-to-medium, modest carbonation. Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this one. The spices dominate too much; lackluster effort...especially with no pumpkin. I feel ripped off. Wait - a friend bought these! He got ripped off..."
""
""

""
""
"O: A pretty good seasonal beer, its too bubbly for my tastes but it reminds me of pumpkin pie, so its worth a try."
"O- pretty average ""pumpkin"" style beer for having no pumpkin in it. Just average, not a bad one, not my favorite. Probably wont seek it out again. just another spiced beer for fall."
""
""
""
"Yes, this is too strong and yes, this is too spicy. Nevertheless, I liked it and it had just a bit of a toasted nature to it that tied everything in nicely. While I'm not a huge fan of these types of beers, this was sufficient enough to enjoy once and not need anything afterward to wash it down. Heck, I could even have a piece of Pumpkin Pie with this."
"Overall: This beer was not so bad going into it. Pretty average. Nothing exactly jumping out to make you want to explore the whole thing. I may try this again, but not exactly willing on a regular basis. I may recommend this to another friend. Cheers!"
"Taste is enjoyable, but nothing to get excited about. Arcadia's done a fair job of spicing this one for the season, but the pumpkin itself is sorely missed. Kind of tastes (and to segway) feels like a spiced octoberfest, considering the lightness of flavor coupled with the amber/brown coloring and additional ingredients. The mouthfeel is too viscous. This beer, overall, is worth a try - indeed, I'd give it major props as an accessible version of a pumpkin ale - but, in the end it leaves me reaching into the fridge for a darker, thicker, and, well, spookier brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Thin and almost flavorless. faintly sweet with barely noticeable earthy hop presence. Close to dead carbonation with a slight syrupyness. Finishes with a hint of allspice and cinnamon. Otherwise a palate cleanser. Drinks like water. Yet another disappointing pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feels medium in body, a little thirst quenching, and leaves the mouth a little dirty/sticky."
""
""
""
"O - A good example of an english take on a pumpkin ale. Somewhat tannic, but still very nice."
""
""
""
"No I would not recommed this beer to a friend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- It's ok, but it just doesn't stand out for an autumnal/pumpkin beer in the price range. The gritty, overspiced feel also detracts from it, even though the flavors themselves are fine enough. Something a little lighter would really take this one over the top- I would like to see a similar malt base and spice profile done as a cider-like sour."

"This looks hazy but vibrant in the glass, a bright bleached cardboard color along with considerable foam. The foam seems consistent with the Arcadia Ales I’ve sampled recently, and despite trying a pumpkin ale in March, 2012 it appears to have held up. There’s a noticeable holiday spice on the aroma— nutmeg, allspice & some clove—with the flavor matching the aroma. The spices are complemented by a sharp bittering. It’s effervescent, very light on the palate. It’s not boozy but there’s a boozy mouthfeel similar to that from bigger beers I’ve sampled. Although this brew is probably half a year old it’s still tasty."

"Light to medium in mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, just not great. Drinkable...give it a try once for the experience."
"Poured a hazy burnt orange with a small white head that leaves a bit of streaky lacing. Light aroma of pumpkin pie spices and caramel. Taste of nutmeg and cinnamon, light spicy yeast, pithy and a bit vegetal, even though there isn't actually any pumpkin in this one. A little bit bland, but not entirely without its charm. Light-medium mouthfeel, and moderately drinkable."
"O - I like a lot of pumpkin beers. This doesn't rate up there with my favorites."
"o - well, at least it's appropriately named. not awful, but not for me. certainly won't be returning to this one."
"Overall, not much of a pumpkin beer, but is well-spiced."
"O: Average spiced ale. Good, but not great."
"O: One of the better pumpkin beers I believe. Has the right amount of spice and does not taste like an over-sweet desert beer."
"Overall: Having recently had a bottle of Dogfish Head Punkin Ale and Southern Tier Pumking, it's clear that this beer isn't in the same league.. seems like they cut corners or something. Pass this one up; you won't miss much."
"O-""tastes like Thanksgiving"" said waitress and it didn't disappoint"
"Overall: This beer is really good. Spices up front with a pumpkin flavor and a pleasant aroma. Definitely recommend."
"O- Very disappointing brew. I am a huge fan of Arcadia's Cereal Killer and bought this hoping it would follow that brew's reputation for quality. Not only is this beer sub-par, it purposefully misleads the consumer. This is released in the fall and has a pumpkin on the label with no accompanying information? Come on! This is one of the few times I wish I would've remembered to bring my phone into the store so I could check BA and avoid this garbage."
"I guess I’m glad I tried this, so I know not to the next time."
"O: Would like to see more malt backbone to this."
"Dark orange amber in color with nothing but small spots of white froth as a head. Light scent, mostly seasonal spices like nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon, oddly placed yet solid notes of lemony citrus, lightly caramely sweet and faintly musty malt profile. Taste a little better than scent lead on, still not overpowering, rather standard blend of spice and caramel malt with, again, a quite oddly present splash of lemony hops. Comes across as lightly watery at the end, dry finish. All around a ""meh"" beer that doesn't do much wrong, it just lacks in most categories to make it worth while."
"If you see it, I'd pass because there are tons of better examples of the style. This isn't a knock on Arcadia, because I like some of their beers, but this is a complete miss, although it could've been worse."
"O: A great October ale, or something to remind you of the wonderful smells and tastes of Fall. I love the picture on the front - this may be my new favorite Halloween ale. Quite good."
"Mouthfeel and Overall - Extremely plain and flat. This sort of tastes like water with spice stirred in. Light-bodied and overall a bit funky tasting. This beer lacks complexity and taste. One of the most disappointing fall beers out there, especially in the spice department. Light-bodied but leaves my mouth dry. I had this a year ago and was also not too impressed. I will not be trying this again."
"Overall: I thought this was a nice spice beer. The smell was really the best part. I think it might get a bad wrap because they sell it as a pumpkin beer."
"This is a good beer but could use more pumpkin. Maybe my bottle was tame, but spicing wasn't harsh."
"On tap at the HopCat. I am starting to find pumpkin beers late summer. This one had significant and distinct pumpkin, as well as other spices to enhance drinkability. Cloudy yellow with some lace. Above average mouthfee. Not bad, and cinammon and nutmeg are spices I like. Mildly spicy aromas."
"Overall: It's certainly no pumpkin brew but it sure as hell smells and tastes like a holiday autumn pie which is pretty nice. But what this brew is missing is a big pumpkin presence to help even out all of those spices and sharp hop flavors on the end. Arcadia, your better than this."
"O - This beer is not to be confused with a pumpkin beer. This is a spiced beer and should be reviewed as such. That being said the spicing in this beer is a little over-powering. It's hard to taste or smell anything else with all the spicyness going on here."
"This is the most uninspired of the pumpkin ale's I've had. Did a search last year to try to find something like what I made with a brewer friend of mine and did not come close. This year I'm making one and I'm re-visiting my study. The mouthfeel is mediocre, too much bitterness for the style and no good flavors are present after the bitterness attacks your tongue. The color is fine, its a lighter orange color and the aroma promises far more than the beer delivers. Too much alcohol/bitterness."
"This pumpkin ale poured out as a deep copper color with a tan fizzy looking head. The lacing is not really noticeable at all here. The smell had some spicy pumpkin aromas with some light clove in there too. The taste was pretty light to me. There wasn't too much else happening here. The mouthfeel was average. Overall it's not the best pumpkin ale out there. Wouldn't have to buy this one again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy brownish/orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of cinnaimon and nutmeg, a touch of pumpkin. Taste is very spicy, lots of cinnimon, some nutmeg, a tad bitter, no pumpkin to speak of. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall while not being a bad beer, I feel it is just a bit over spiced."
"D - I am certainly enjoying this beer, but I don't know if I would want more than one in a sitting; nice to have a beer with the pumpkin spices without the sweetness of many pumpkin beers."
"very refreshing and worth a try. I'll say it once again, watch out for Arcadia they have some tasty brews"
"Morey's Bottom Line: It's not horrible, but why not have the pumpkin? I know there are no rules as far as craft beer is concerned, but this beer seems to need the smoothness of the pumpkin in a big way."
"D- Never again. I would give this to friends as a joke beer at best. It is probably the worst experience I've had with beer as of yet."
"D/M:Crisp and clean but packs a subtle punch. Strong flavors that blend together well. The label was also really cool which misled me to think this was a pumpkin."
"D - The smell and taste kill it. I'm not sure I'm going to able to finish and it's not sitting well with my stomach at all. I wouldn't be surprised if this was a bad batch."
"D. Again I think this is a very good pumpkin beer. Surprised not everyone feels the same."
"Do I really want my jaw jacked...? In any case, the brew pours a hazy sunset russet-amber topped by around a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, clove, and blood orange. The taste holds notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, orange rind, light caramel, and that apple-cinnamon combination you find in cereals and turnovers. You know the one. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a finish that borders on the dry. Overall, a nice and tasty spiced brew, nothing Earth-shattering but definitely enjoyable."
"This beer looks a slight hazy brown orange with a finger of puffy white foam. The aroma is akin to apple cider or perhaps a spicy caramel apple. There seems to be lots of cinnamon on the nose as well as some nutmeg and clove. The cinnamon taste is even more prominent in the flavor and the green apple is it's main counterpart. When mixed with the caramel malts it really gives that fall flavor and is quite nice. The mouth is a tad too watery for my liking, but be cause of the flavors you can power through it. I feel it's quite drinkable, there really isn't anything too harsh about this beer."
"Pumpkin Spice Pass!"
"Avoid the bottle at ALL costs, but do yourself a favor and stop in at the pub to have this on tap. It will be worth it!"
"Poured to a small half inch head. Head was gone in no time. Ale itself was brown in color. No lacing at all. Had a strong cinnamon smell also smelled of nutmeg. Also notes of fruit, maybe apple. Didnt taste as strong as it smelled. I thought that it actually didnt have a lot of flavor going on. Maybe a slightly sweet apple, and hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Felt okay in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was a little excessive. I wont buy again. There was a lack in flavor. Almost like carbonated water."
"D: An impulse buy that seemed at the time worth a stab; oh, how helpful some wi-fi would have been. As fun as it should be to try a new beer with seasonal flair like this - wow, just not very good. I've had other Arcadias and enjoyed them, but this is a 'pass' if the opportunity arose again from the pumpkin patch."
"D - As many have mentioned, there may some false advertising going on here... The label depicts a scarecrow with a huge pumpkin head with jagged teeth, however there is no pumpkin in this offering it's all spices..."
"D: An extremely unpleasant experience, and drinking the entire bottle is a chore. A beer this bad deserves a 1/5 in the drinkability category, because in such splendid company as Pumking, Night Owl, Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout... why bother with this?"
"Eric"
"Drinkable and pretty tasty. Wouldn't get a case of this, but it is worth a try."
"It's hard to get past the spicing here. Bringing in the buttery tone is where this beer loses it. A bit of a chore to drink, and the spicing alone just doesn't cut it for us. If you're going to attempt a Pumpkin Ale, do it right."
"Notes: very drinkable. Not a bad beer just not spectacular. Liked it enough that I would buy it again given the chance, but not so great that I would have it on hand readily at all times."
"D: I pass on this one. Not bad but not great. It does not utilize the flavors very well"
"Very enjoyable beer. Not my favorite for the style or season but solid none the less. Jaw Jacker is very drinkable with no real offensive qualities. Worth a taste."
"Taste: The initial taste isn't anything special, there are noticeable spices but not too strong. It does end up leaving a pumpkin spice aftertaste that is pretty good."
"Pumpkin ales are definitely a unique breed and something that not everyone may appreciate; but this one is well balanced and I think one of the better pumpkin ales out there. If you're not sure, try at least a bottle or a 6-pack, Jaw-Jacker is worth a try."
"My brother recommended this to me in a sixtel. I am glad he did! This draft beer is very drinkable and leaves no aftertaste. I poured it in a chilled glass and the lines to my beer meister were brand new - a perfect setup for a good fall beer. Can't wait to get home tonight and have another!"
"This is a truly excellent fall beer. The aroma when first poured reminds one of a freshly baked pumpkin pie. Upon tasting it you will not be disappointed in the aroma, it truly has that pumpkin pie taste. Hints of nutmeg linger on your tongue. The beer is very drinkable, not at all heavy, and refreshing on a crisp fall day."
"Drinks alright, would never buy another sixer of this when I can get Ichabod & Schafly's Pumpkin brews. A very average offering"
"The spices seem the lend themselves to the mouthfeel as well, giving the beer an unpleasant powdery, chalky quality. I couldn't even finish the glass. Starts out fairly decent, but goes downhill fast. Very disappointing."
"Drinkability: Interesting decision, to brew a pumpkin ale without pumpkin; ultimately, it is missing something in the depth of flavor beneath the spices"
"D Really nice drinkability. I finished my glass without any difficulty whatsoever. 4.5"
"Bottle to pint glass. Pours orange/light copper with a very small white head that disappears very fast to basically nothing. Leaves no lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell is pretty predictable, pumpkin and spices. Nothing really jumps out, the pumpkin could be stronger but at least you don't have to look for it. The taste is kind of bitter right away. It's followed by some spices and just a hint of pumpkin. The pumpkin isn't really as noticeable in the taste which is kind of a shame. The spices really come out in the aftertaste I think. A lover ABV makes this one pretty drinkable. A pretty decent fall beer. I wouldn't turn this down if available at a bar/on draft or if someone had one for me."
"Two thumbs down."
"D: Not bad, but not awesome."
"The medium bodied beer, feels pretty good, with a nice creamy quality to it, and a complimentary amount of carbonation but the spices pretty much ruin any redeeming qualities the beer may have. Just too much, IMO. I doubt I would buy this again, but I am not overly disappointed with my purchase."
"~ Purchased a 6-pack from Big Z Beverage in Huntington, NY. Pours a hazy orange color with a creamy white head. Cooler temperatures, leaves changing colors, and homemade pumpkin pies are just a few of the things that come to mind when I take a whiff of this beer. Aromas are of pumpkin spices, and it tastes pretty much the way it smells. This was satisfying, and I will have no problems finishing off the other bottles. ~"
"Drinkability: In terms of pumpkin ales, this one is average at best. Too heavy on the spices, not enough pumpkin coming through. I was glad I could try this one, but I don't think I'll be in a hurry to pick up a six pack in the future."
"d- nice and drinkable, i'd say it's more drinkable than a couple other pumpkin ales just because it doesn't have so much overwhelming spice to it, just wish it had more pumpkin."
"D- I drank four of these the other night...I have no idea how. Normally I wouldn't want more than one or two."
"Taste: Pretty much just a cinnamon ale. The other spices add a little depth and complexity, but the spices aren't in balance."
"Pours an amber-copper color with a small off-white head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is big on cinnamon, almost like big red, with some nutmeg and allspice to give that pumpkin pie character. The taste is quite spicy with the cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. This is balanced against a toasted malt which is a bit lemony and astringent. Some earthy hops round out the profile. The feel is light to moderate with extremely fizzy with a lemony astringency. A decent pumpkin pie style brew, would like to see some pumpkin added in to tone down the spice, though the malt does cut it a bit."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and biting, refreshing."
"D: Hearty enough for cool fall evenings, but light enough to enjoy more than a couple at a time. Good seasonal. (high level of spices may be a turnoff for some)"
"A clear deep copper color body with a two finger off white foamy head . Aroma is of sweet roasted barley and pumpkin pie , nice amount of cinnamon and other spices with just a hint of baked apple . Flavor is lightly sweet with some nice cinnamon , and nutmeg notes , a little brown bread . A light bitterness and citrus finish from the hops . Medium body , smooth mouthfeel . A good drinker for a style that is not my favorite ."
"The beer has the typical seasonal spices, such as pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice. The beer is good, it has a pumpkin pie like taste with a bit of a bite in the finish. Nothing exceptional, but it was an enjoyable herbal beer to have. There isn't much malty base here, more the spices and some thinness. It's a decent beer for what it is."
"Overall, it's a pretty standard 'pumpkin' ale that's just a little heavy on the spicing, although I appreciate that they were able to keep the nutmeg and all-spice in the mix where cinnamon usually dominates. I enjoyed one, but I wouldn't go for a second; and to be honest, although I quite often look at these beers as possible compliments to fall and winter holiday meals, I think I'd only go for this one merely as a novelty beer at halloween. Well, maybe with some sweet yams ;)"
"Drinkability: Fine in the context of a light spiced beer, I guess, but it's hard to refrain from letting out a discontented sigh for want of pumpkin. But if the pumpkins available to Arcadia are anything like the ones featured on the label, then I can fully understand their absence and omission from the recipe."
"Pours a clear light copper color with a small quickly dissipating head. Smells of light malts with some adjunct cereals present in the nose. First sip is light with the spices dominating the flavor. The flavor is good as the spices in the taste are not over powering the malts. Mouthfeel is only fair as it is under carbonated."
"D - Eh. This one is way over-spiced, and under pumpkined. The spices can get very annoying and distracting if you don't sip this very slowly, so that puts a session out of the question. I'd pass on this one next time."
"D: An ok drinkability overall. A fairly light mouthfeel and could have used a bit more of a robust taste to it. A fairly decent beer overall."
"Arcadia Ales Jaw-Jacker pours a dense brownish orange with an inital one finger froathy head. Looks like dark spices mixed into an inital orange liquid. The smell is medium strong with a bitter spice aroma. Taste like like what I would imagine the breath of the pumpkin on the bottle. The ale claims to have spices added (cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg). Thats kind of what it taste like. An over mix of spices in liquid with a bitter aftertaste. Nasty film develepment on the gums. The mouthfeel is actually pretty nice. I can enjoy it up till the point I start to taste the wicked culmination of spices. Feels dense, like it looks, with a medium sharp carbonation. Drinkability is worth putting one bottle in a pumpkin beer six pack mixer, and only for comparison. Six packs are over priced and would not be advised for purchase."
"The key with this one is to drink very slowly so as to catch what flavors do exisit, and don't plan on enjoying it as much as you might have liked."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Carbonated to the point of being tolerable... the volume and resulting burps are higher than expected, so it's a gassy experience in the belly. One's enough for me, it could use some taming with regard to the spices."
"I have had this a couple different times and sometimes it has been great and other times it has been slightly off. For the most part it is a good beer. It is not my favorite pumpkin but it is a good spiced beer if you are looking to break away from the usual spiced beer. It is quite bitter and you can tell there is a British influence. It has a deep bronze almost copper color with a lot of carbonation to the body. There is a tight head and lace. It has a strong aroma of pumpkin spice and hops. There is not much for malt but there is a strong pumpkin taste. It is medium bodied beer."
"Notes from 6/17/05"
"Wow, why would a brewer put out something like this? Glad this was a freebie bottle supplied by ME golfin' buddy that's diggin' the craft. Thanks for hooking me up."
"This one pours a orange hue with nice peach highlights. The cap is a small two fingers worth of small,medium and large bubbles all bursting rapidly,deflating away to nothing,except for a thin ring around the edge. The nose is greatly understated in comparison to the bold and spicy flavors within. I smell only a small amount of spice and subtle tangerine. The flavors are not overdone keeping this one away from some of the artificiality that is sometimes standard in these pumpkin offerings. I'm glad that Arcadia didn't add any pumpkin,it helps the spice to build off of the malt flavors creating a pumpkin pie feel without taking anything away from the natural flavors. The body is medium to thin with just a touch of slickness,the carbonation is on the high end,but acceptable for the style. A subtle drying aftertaste and slightly sticky fruitiness lingers for a moment after the last drop is gone. Very quaffable,a very light seasonal and a bad ass name!"
"There's better pumpkin beer out there, and I just learned that this has no pumpkin in it! This is a good way to get the macro beer people to try something different without freaking them out. Bring it to a Halloween party for the cool graphics on the bottles, and encourage those who don't normally drink beer to try it out."
"It's not a bad beer, just not what I'd call a spiced ale."
"Poured into a pint glass, the beer was an amber color with virtually no head, even with an aggressive pour. Mostly clove in the nose, with some faint background spice, all of which warmed/burnt my nose. Vaguely spicy taste, tiny bit of hops at the end. An OK beer, but there are certainly better examples of the style."
"D-I wish I could find 6 packls of this one I would like to have a few more."
"D: This is a drain poor for me. I have too much good beer in my fridge to waste my sobriety on this."
"D - it's ok as far as fall seasonals go."
"Drinkability - a pumpkin ale of last resort in my book. Bottle code B3..."
"Still, a good beer worth the purchase."
"Poured a thickish, dark coppery with a slight tinted head. It smelled very spicy of pumpkin and perhaps cinnamon. It seems moderately carbonated and has a decent body. It's finish is great--very spiced but not over the top. A great seasonal and another great beer from Arcadia. I would definitely have this one again."
"Overall this certainly wasn't bad, but there are better pumpkin beers out there. Worth a shot if you're into pumpkin beers."
"An easy to drink (and enjoy) festive ale here. A good representation of the style."
"Clear amber with some light beige foam that formed a ring of coarse bubbles with a fine skim covering the beer. Some short-lived lace. Very spicy aroma, aromatic nutmeg, some cinnamon. Low bitterness with a bit of malt, but mostly spice here too. Cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and a little lemon, with the spice lingering in the finish. Medium/light bodied with average carbonation, a little on the dry side. This was OK, but the character was heavy on spice and thin on beer."
"This poured with about a finger's worth of off-white head with low retention. The color was a hazy orangish-amber. The nutmeg and allspice really jumped out on the nose. The mouthfeel was medium with a bracing interplay of spices on the tongue. The finish had more of a cinnamon flavor than I had experienced on the tongue, but it still had a lot of spice lingering after the swallow. It was decent, but I have had much better pumpkin ales and probably would not return to this one right away."
"The flavor combination (sweet pumpkin pie characteristics and hop bittering) just doesn't work well together for me. Seems like it needs to tone down one or another."
"The taste has lots of similar flavors, a solid malt beer with lots of spice. Very flavorful, but without being cloying or artificial tasting. Lots of nutmeg and cinnamon, then a bit of clean hop bite at the end. One of the best pumpkin beers I've had. Perfecly spiced and flavored like pumpkin pie. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, which suits the style. This is one beer that I wish I had more of to enjoy as the weather turns, a good fall or even a winter brew."
"Mouthfeel is excellent. This is an very nice pumpkin beer that I believe is a great example of the style. Drinkable now through the new year!!"
"Appealing dirty orange in the glass, smells like a spice rack. Upfront, the taste is quite nice, but an out-of-place bitterness forms in the mouth at the finish. To support the level of spice here, it seems that some additional sweetness is necessary."
"Not bad... Not bad at all... This is a really good pumpkin ale, albeit a little strong for me... At 6% alcohol, a little less of a percentage would make this beer absolutely super... Otherwise, the taste, smell, and drinkability are top-notch... Definitely a must-try for all pumpkin beer fans... Although this wouldn't be my first-choice, I would definitely buy a six-pack again... Nice amber-orange color, and a wonderful autumn-pumpkin smell packs quite a punch... Without a doubt, worth a try..."
"The bottom line: you know what you're getting into with this one, it's a spicy Fall pumpkin pie flavoured beer. Of the variety, this is a good example though, and I have rated it by the style, which in my mind, is weak overall. I like a good spicy beer like this though, and it's whetting my appetite for the Christmas spiced beers."
"Overall- A good example of the style. It's something I'd pick up again as a nice fall drinker."
"Pours a deep orange. Smells of fresh pumpkin pie. Taste follows, with a nice spicy bite to it. The pumpkin taste is present, and finishes a little more bitterly than I would have liked. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is medium and sorta prickly on the tongue, not much creaminess to be had here. Overall, it's a pretty tasty pumpkin ale but it doesn't stand out from the pack."
"Update: This one is starting to grow on me, a sweet hoppy treat but still not very ""pumpkiny""."
"Mouthfeel is a little fizzy, Arcadia beers do tend to be a little over carbonated. However, the carbonation does create a creaminess that I have been looking for in a pumpkin ale. Light and enjoyable."
"Jaw-Jacker is delicious beer. The' trick' is that Arcadia has brewed a pumpkin ale without using pumpkin. The 'treat' is the quality and drinkability of the final product. If you have the opportunity to do so, pick up a sixer. I now wish that I had."
"Purchased a single for $1.49 at Rudy's Liquors, LaSalle, IL."
"The aroma had me thinking that this might be one of the best pumpkin ales I've had. The flavor though, while not utterly discrediting that possibility, did not represent nearly as well. This dichotomy winds things into a drinkable but not overly desirable offering. I wouldn't say no out of hand to another of these, but first you'd have to prove to me that there was nothing better available at the moment. I'm not sure how likely that is."
"D - This is a pretty good pumpkin ale. Nice spices and flavors."
"D - This is a fine example of a well made pumpkin ale - the spices are used deftly and the feel is great. I prefer a skosh less clove, but overall a very balanced and quaffable ale. It has session qualities w/ pumpkin and spice as accentuation of a very good ale."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Overly light(for a pumpkin ale) on the palate. I find that there is no other way to describe it. Its almost like it evaporates once one starts to swallow it. The brew has a pretty dry finish and is lightly carboanted, just doesn't do it for me. This is a beer one could easily drink all night, and even though it is somewhat enjoyable, I don't think that I'd want to specifically drink this pumpkin ale all night, there are others that I'd much rather have over this one. Most likely will never buy this one again, I'm not too impressed by any of Arcadia's brews."
"Pours a golden autumn color with a little head retention, but not much. The nose is of pumpkin pie spices and maybe a quick whiff of alcohol. It has flavors of pumpkin pie spices, as well as hints of a wheat ale. Actually, it almost reminds me of a wheat wine I had tried a year or so ago with the addition of fall seasonal spices. Its not going to strike you as a wheat ale of any sort, but when considering other pumpkin ales that Ive tried, it seems to lean in that direction more so than its peers. Not a bad beer, if you are fond of the style I would reccommend trying this one."
"6% ABV"
"Overall, a good beer. Not the best I've had, but I'm glad I bought a sixpack."
"Appears dark amber with some brown tint to it, 1/8 inch, very thin, white head with very little carbonation bubbles to the top, no lacing. Smells primarily of cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin spices, very much like a pumpkin pie. Taste is of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin spices, and some breadiness, with a sweet brown sugar pickup as the beer warms. Very smooth and creamy with little carbonation. Definitely a drinkable pumpkin ale, not too overwhelming in any of the aspects, nicely balanced with all of the flavors. Fantastic for a Fall brew."
"Slight foggy orange-brown color with a finger of head that dies down quickly to a solid looking film of fine bubbles. No lacing. Nose is tons of nutmeg aromas, some roasted malt. Maybe light citrus. A good aroma. Flavor's a lot like gingerbread cookies. Definite nutmeg presence, giving it an eggnoggy sort of feel as well. Nice, rough, bready mouthfeel appropriate for the style. I actually liked this one. It lacked the standard Arcadia sourness which I've grown fairly tired of - I think it's my favorite from them."
"Overall- Tough to find by me but buy it if you see it! Tasty stuff here."
"D- Very well done. A little on the rich side, but this has replaced O'Fallon's as my favorite pumpkin ale."
"This is the first time my store has carried this brew.Fall seasonals and pumpkin beers come few and far between....until this year.Pours a medium dark amber with only a ring of bubbles around the glass and does not seen to lace down at all.Actually it has no lacing down my pint.I have had a few other pumpkin brews and this one stands out!! Great warming pumpkin pie and nutmeg smell.I wonder if a little whip cream would be good?(snout of the whip cream canister in the beer....and easy does it. This beer in the fall around a fire with a light jacket and good buddies listening to great rock music will suit my needs and yours too!!"
"drinkability: good"
"Medium bodied, this is a very nice beer. Solid English ale base, complex and interesting without being overbearing, this is a world class pumpkin ale."
