"Okay beer. One is all I need."

"Easy drink...a little sweet, not a lot of carbonation,  but overall I really enjoyed it. Surprising for me because I'm not normally a Fatheads fan."
"Ginger and allspice dominate both aroma and flavor. Cola notes become evident in the aftertaste. There's a touch of toasted malt."

"Great label good Xmas spirit"

"Just about a carbon copy of Great Lakes Christmas Ale."

"Guess I gotta write a review cuz it's not letting me do a quick score. My buddy brought this down from his hometown in Ohio back here to Texas. Nice treat. Looks solid. Very clear. No head. Nose isn't too pungent. Nose and flavor are the same except the flavor has more malt flavor. Holiday spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla. Medium body, mellow carbo, solid brew"

"Very similar to the classic Great Lakes Christmas Ale. At 10.99 a sixer, this will definitely be added to my annual Christmas lineup"
"O - Fantastic! Probably in my top three christmas ales! Will definitely be purchasing more."

"O- Very good spiced Christmas Ale that tastes that is heavy on the spices of the season and a nice malt backbone.  This beer is very similar to Great Lakes Christmas Ale in my opinion with Holly Jolly being just a little more malt forward."
""
"O- I feel this is a great example of a christmas ale. Very spice heavy, not quite warming enough for me though. I'd go winter warmer over herb/spice ale next time."

"Taste mixes malt flavors with the spices better than the nose would indicate, still quite cookie-esque though. The honey comes forth in this beer more so than any other beer I have had, maybe even as much as DFH Midas Touch. The ginger seems to help that perception, as does the rich malt. Mouthfeel is great - full and silky. I like this one quite a bit but I could see it being too rich for more than one or two in a sitting."

"O-As it warms it becomes slightly bland, the spice is still there but nothing special. A good beer but not worth having again."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/24/2013. Pours moderately cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, caramel, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, honey, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, clove, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and spice notes; with great strength. Taste of raisin, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, honey, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander, clove, and herbal earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, honey, ginger, coriander, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, honey, and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice spiced Christmas ale! All around good balance and complexity of malt and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
"O: This beer is a meal in a glass, showing off enough spicy complexity to endlessly entertain the palate. If you’re looking for a pleasantly-spiced, drinkable beer for the colder months, look no further."

"Overall this is a nice spiced ale and a good holiday brew. The spices were not overwhelming, like in some renditions of the style. This is pretty good stuff, as to be expected from this brewery."
"Overall - decent session Christmas beer, though GLC still rules the roost. A toast of this beer to Steve who introduced himself at the King of the Hill IPA tasting at Incline Public House. He needed a sitdown and I was happy to share my table. Joined by his brother Frank and sister-in-law Leanne, I was about to leave but they bought me one, so thanks for that!! Meeting new friends over good beer is always a keeper in the holiday memories department. Great to meet you guys, cheers!"

"Overall this is one of the better Christmas beers I've tried. It's spicy without being overwhelming, piney without being too pungent, and has a deep, satiny body that goes down easily with a pleasant aftertaste. This beer is what I had hoped ST 2xmas would be like, the aromas are similar, but FH presents a much smoother and more palatable flavor in my opinion. Not something I'd want all the time, but I would certainly recommend trying it."

"The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with active carbonation, and there's a pretty sticky finish that you can feel for a good 30 seconds after each sip. Overall, this is a good winter beer / Christmas ale. Not the best style on earth, but this gets the job done when you're looking for something to warm you up or looking for something that fits in during the season."

"Six packs released with a deep mahogany brown crimson hue with light khaki tan head forming nicely in intricate patterns down the sides of my chalice. Aroma has spices for Christmas, ginger, cinnamon, etc. with a definite honey tone fermented out a bit. Strong spice character throughout each sip it's super spicy limiting the enjoyment of each sip, to how high your tolerance is to the honey, cinnamon, ginger, dry spice additions are. Mouthfeel gets cloying at times be ready to share this beer with those folks who love Great Lakes Christmas ale hell rim the glass with a mix of cinnamon and sugar if you have to. Overall I love Fathead's this beer is off my palate's radar for beers I truly love, but I consider it to be a good solid Christmas ale."

"Dark amber pour with decent head and retention. Aroma is light; nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon, primarily nutmeg. Taste is sweet, with cinnamon up front and the other spices following. Honey is in there somewhere. I like this as a holiday ale, but am not overwhelmed by it. Enjoyable but not the best."

"O - This is a pretty good winter warmer. I know it is July, but it has held up quite well."

"Holly Jolly is a pretty solid Winter Warmer from Fat Heads Brewery. Here in Ohio, it’s not a threat to dethrone Great Lakes Christmas Ale, but it’s a nice supplement to the Christmas season. If the strong sprucey, piney flavor could be toned down a little, it’d be even better. Easy recommendation nevertheless."

"Last year I went overboard buying Christmas beers and got tired of them really fast. This year, I only bought one - a sixer of this one. I probably won't buy it again. Not because I don't like it. I simply prefer Great Lakes Christmas Ale. It's a little sweeter than this one and feels a bit more festive somehow. Perhaps it's the label on the bottle."
""
"Pours a lightly hazy orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, a light spice and quite faint. In the taste, spices, especially all spice, but mellow in the end. A spice bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry spice in the aftertaste. Nice spice but mellow and faint."
""
""
"O: Excellent winter spiced ale. Very flavorful and balanced."
""
""
"Happy Holidays..."
"O - a good example of the style."
""
""
"Overall - Different style of xmas ale. Its a brown ale, with some winter warmer notes. The sugars and spices arent overpowering at all. Hops are minor, fruits are mixed in with added sugars. Ginger makes up the main flavor with the buttery malts. Good, not great, worth a drink."
""
""
"The body is moderate. The carbonation borders on high but is kept in check. Generally it's pretty smooth, definitely plenty crisp but not biting. Alcohol doesn't factor too much in the feel, which is good."
""
"Great nose and pleasant flavor. An accomplished winter warmer, or apparently, a spiced beer."
"A well-balanced, holiday spiced winter brew."
""
"** I'm not sure if this is the same beer/recipe as their Christmas Ale of years past. Seems very similar."
