"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours with about a finger's width of off-white foam.  Color is difficult to determine because of how murky it is. Looks like a reddish brown color. There is an overwhelming amount of particles floating throughout the brew. Has a strong fig and spice aroma (nutmeg and cinnamon?) with a hint of orange peel. Initial taste is of fig and spices followed by slight orange peel flavor. Malts and hops enter the taste palate as the fig flavors disappear but the orange peel and spices remain. Overall taste is very unique, but nothing impressive. An above average beer. Definitely wouldn't mind drinking again."

"Overall:  This is a very good beer!  Great notes of toasted malt and spices.  The only “negative” aspect of the beer is that the flavor of the beer doesn’t really match the aroma, meaning, there is less gingerbread in the flavor than is promised in the aroma.  That being said, it’s an extremely tasty beer and one that I will certainly get again next winter!"
"O-You want a spiced Christmas Ale?  Well, hear you go.   It accomplishes what it sets out to be but let's just say I am glad I bought a single and not a sixer....too overloaded to drink more than one.   Still, rating is for style and what is supposed to be."

"Overall / Drinkability:  Definitely right that this beer was labeled as an Herbed/Spiced beer rather than as a winter warmer.  This beer is very intense in the spices and while I've not had a Swedish Glogg, it definitely reminds me of a highly spiced tea/winter drink.  If there are hops in this I cannot detect them over all the spices.  Overall, a glass of Christmas spice smell in a glass.  Drinkability.....this one was hard to finish and while it was good to try for the concept, I could easily see one either loving or hating this beer.  I found it interesting, but I think I would be forcing myself to finish off a whole bottle - so I'm glad I shared it with others.  So not high drinkability, but I'll give it good marks for depth and intensity of flavor."

"Smells and tastes like Christmas."
"Thank You Southern Tier Brewing Company"
"I had never tried this type of beer before, and when I popped the top, I was kind of offput by the smell...very pot pouri smelling. I didn't like the taste of it at all. But I can't say whether it was brewed badly, or I'm just not a fan of the style."
"Perfectly balanced, and not too heavy - so you could easily drink this all night. You MUST try this beer."
""
"Overall this a great example of a spiced beer; especially one that is brewed for the holidays."
""

"O - Enjoyable. This beer looks and smells great. The flavor leaves a little to be desired as  it's a little bitter and almost too spicy. But it's a good, rich beer."
"This is a pretty darn good Christmas beer."
""
""
""
""
"Heavily spiced with nutmeg, clove and ginger. Overally hopped with little malt balance."
"Overall, not a style I'm fond of but a lighter touch on the spices would make this more palatable."
""
"Both the aroma and the flavor reflect a heavy use of nutmeg.  There are some other spices in here too, but the overall spicing level is just too high, largely masking the malts."
"I poured this one out for my homies."
"Was unable to do more than 2 sips of this.  This tasted like potpourri to me.  Much the same way potpourri stings my eyes, this really disagreed with my palate."
"Dark Amber color with great head and mild carbonation. You can smell this beer from across the room. Lots of spice, fruit like fig, sweetness for aroma. Very strong flavors of black pepper, spice, fruit. Overly spiced which ruins it. Not good this year. Someone had a heavy hand with those spices."
""
"Heavily spiced, and a little to thin to support it all causing the unbalancing act"

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  S/was amazing.  All the holiday spices you would expect from a holiday beer.  It smelled like mulling spices.  T/Was good, with light spices following the nose.  The taste was not as good as the smell, I was expecting more.  O/Good sipping beer but got kind of boring as I worked my way through the glass.  I would bring this out for a party as an easy beer for the non beer drinkers that would come over."

"Good head. A bit sugary malty thick feel. Which wanst too pleasant. But the taste makes up for it. Good hints of spice."
"Had this poured into a pint glass. The color is really nice, deep brown. Almost a maple syrup. Sweet flavor, spices, some citrus on the tail end, particularly orange. Reasonable carbonation. I actually think it's a bit underrated. Good stuff!"
""
"Does not taste as good as it looks or smells."
""
"Slightly hazy copper-amber pour with an off-white one finger head with minimal retention and decent lacing.  The nose is incredible!  Huge spice notes with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and orange peel.  The taste follows suit with the spices dominating.  Huge cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove along with hints of toffee and brown sugar.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation and tangy, spicy finish.  Overall, maybe I'm just in the Christmas spirit, but this is an amazing interpretation of the style.  The spices are bold, but not overpowering, and it's hugely drinkable.  One of my favorite Christmas beers yet!"
"Pours a transparent copper color with a thin tan head that evaporates quickly. Smells of cinnamon, oranges, caramom, ginger, lemon zest. Flavor is interesting, quite intense. It is sweet and rich but it has strong aftertaste of hops and all the other spices that are present. A bit off putting. It is medium bodied and well carbonated, strong after taste. Overall, this was alright, it wasn't horrible but I do need to wash out this weird aftertaste."

"Too much bull going on in this beer.  Smelling christmas and tasting christmas are two different things entirely...After forcing down another half a beer, if you can call it that, I have to say that this jagermeister diarrhea with cloves.  Absolutely terrible"
""
""
"Overall: Very, very good beer. It's not mind blowing, but it's very good. Definitely will put you in mind of Christmas with the aromas and flavors."
"Blech."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Way too heavy on the ginger. Taste similar to a very bitter shaving cream."
"Not for me. Way too much spice.  I haven't dumped a beer down the drain since summer, but this was just not enjoyable for me.  My ratings were generous."
"Overall: Easy drinking, flavorful, complex, a real winner."
""
"O - This one is tough.  I want so much to like this, but not sure I do.  I do like medicine flavors that are less sugary and normally along side good bitter hops.  But this medicine flavor is just too sweet and licorice.  In terms of nailing the Christmas flavor, it lives up to its name and I'd give it a 5.0.  But as a beer that I'd like to drink again, I can't rate it so high."
""
""
""
"This beer has a deep dark aged copper body with a thick beige head and some nice sticky lacing.  The nose is full of dry ginger with some other dry herbal spices, cloves notes in the finish.  The taste has bolder powdered ginger spice that leads to more herbal dry spice flavor with some allspice hints and coriander dryness in the finish. There is a medium mouthfeel and no alcohol heat.  The spice flavor really dominates and covers up any malt character.   It was ok to have one but the spice is just to much to make a second one enjoyable."
"Very spicy!  Love it for the season.  The beer is very good.  It pours very dark and reddish.  The aroma is all about the spices.  I get a lot of ginger, orange peel, and maybe nutmeg or allspice?  The taste is bold, hoppy and sweet.  I can taste honey?  Very good mixture of everything you would expect from a Christmas beer or winter warmer.  I recommend it!"

"Ginger and medicinal, not what I was looking for."

"Spice monster. I actually enjoy a lot of the distinct flavors this brings to the table with cinnamon followed by cardamom and orange peels leading to figs but it all clashes. The cardamom seems to grow with each sip and throws things off. I can certainly appreciate spiced beers but the after taste of this beer is off putting at times."
""
""
"Pours a copper reddish with a very small slight off white head. Head dissipates rather quickly. Smell is cloves and banana and cinnamon and bubble gum. My God it smells like Christmas. Medium mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. The taste is very interesting. It was a good bit piney-er than I expected. A bit of alcohol warmth. Honestly, there’s a little too much going on tastewise - all the smells are represented in the flavor - maybe just a bit too much. Not really sure if I like the taste, but I know I like the smell a whole lot more."

"Wow. That is unlike an any beer I've ever had. I appreciate it but not my favorite at all. The smell was pure pickled ginger, like the one you get when you get sushi. The overall taste was like a cleaning agent with lemon and ginger. I know that sounds weird but that's this beer in a nutshell. I usually love ST but this was not for me. First ever drain pour"
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost a slight barrel-aged tinge to it. Different and fun!"
""
""
""
""
"O. A good seasonal Christmas ale. I'm glad the spice profile in the taste is toned down compared to the nose. This is a good beer to get a person in the Christmas spirit."

"I enjoyed this beer but the flavors just didn't completely come together for me."
""
""
"Pours a deep clear mahogany with a thin cream-white head. There's a small amount of lacing left. The aroma is great, with unique spice tones. Once you know what's in it, you can recognize the cardamom and ginger, amongst the others. The taste builds on the aromas and the fruit additions play quite well. The body has a nice thickness and a little spicy tingle from the ginger on the finish. Pairs perfectly with Thanksgiving dinner."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Their are much better choices for this style.  Cheers!"
"VERY spice forward, with an aggressive, almost astringent cinnamon, clove, and allspice profile. Especially cloves. Huge cloves. And Cinnamon. There's allspice there, too. Not liking this. Not getting much else beyond the medicinal spices. Ugh. I'm not sure I can finish this. Not recomendied."

"If you love spices, especially cloves, you're in for a treat. Unfortunately, I despise cloves! Sadly, it's the 1st beer I've EVER poured down the drain after having 2 sips. Wish I checked my BA app before buying the 6 pack. My fault."
"Lots of spices... Perhaps too much. I like it better than their pumpkin beer tho."

"Overly spiced to the point that its not enjoyable"
"O- A pretty interesting spiced Christmas Ale.  The aroma was much more spice-forward than the flavor.  The flavor profile was a bit on the sweet side, but not too cloying.  I wouldn't really want more than one in a night, as it was a little boozy, but this is a pretty good ale that is reminiscent of the season."

"O- This is definitely a Christmas beer.  Lots of spiciness-nutmeg, cinnamon, orange, fig- think the way the yankee candle store smells at Christmas time.  Then to top it off- there is a big alcohol warmth.  The perfect beer for an ugly Christmas sweater party.  Its a pretty good beer- its a little over the top though."
"I really enjoyed this beer with some age on it. I'll have to pick a pack up this holiday season to see what it is like fresh."

"OVERALL: This is a big, spicy ale that drinks like a smaller, spiced ale. Pretty good brew once you get used to it, sampling this one does not do it justice, 2XMAS needs time to build. After that, its kinda nice."

"Taste is more ginger-forward, which isn't so bad, but this seems it would drink better if it were counter-balanced with sweet vanilla or creamier bread notes. This ginger flavor is more in line with the root than with the holiday cookie. Clove in here as well. Ends somewhat dry and peppery too. The biggest disappointment for me was the role the orange plays. The orange must contribute to the spicing, because it certainly doesn't lend any actual orange flavor (or citrus refreshment for that matter). Other than that, this beer seems to live up to resembling the spicier mulled wine flavors of the Norwegian glogg for which it's named. Not my favorite style, but pleasant.. and one and done."

"A totally different holiday brew experience. I'm glad I held off reviewing this because the first I drank last November ended up feeding my drain. This was at least palatable but still far from my flavor profile preference. I can't take off too much just because I didn't care for the taste because I think they did what they did well. But I'll never buy more."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is rich, with a touch of warming alcohol. This is a good holiday/winter warmer type beer."
""
"Pours medium to dark amber. Touch of foam on top. Light sweet nose. Jammy and figs. Cinnamon and nutmeg. Orange fig flavors, sweet malt, spiced finish. A touch sweet, but has a little bitter balance. Works for the season, nice festive beer."
"Southern Tier is usually pretty solid in my book but not this one here. What I detect to be Nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, cloves and conifer doesn't work well together. well, at least not for my palate."

"My last 2014 Christmas beer, (unless I pick up one more Krampus, I saw my local still has). Clear thin amber color, with light colored head. Smells is strong nutmeg, and spice. I pick up some cinnamon as well. Taste kind of,...well actually, just like potpourii. Mouthfeel is thin light and just slightly bitter, but definitely not really sweet. Overall, it's OK. I think I would have rated this a bit higher before Christmas, but now after the holidays, somethings wore off. With that said I will look forward to another six pack next Christmas, but I will drink all of it before the holiday is over. Guess some things aren't better if you wait."

"2XMAS, packed to the brim with spice like Santa's gift bag on Christmas Eve, smells and tastes like Christmas. Not wanting to ""Bah Humbug"" this beer, the sweet and decadent malt could be more forward, for an even more delectable holiday drinking experience. Great job Southern Tier!"

"Not my fave Christmas beer, but it's okay."
"I really like this seasonal ale brewed with ""figs, orange peels, and spices."" It is smooth and flavorful on the palate, not a all hoppy, and the 8 percent alcohol completely missed me until I read the label. It's a very nice ale flavor, not a strong ""anything"" in the mouth, except for good flavor, and perfect for a cold winter's day or night. Not my first tasting, to mention. This is my third or fourth over the past month, and it's still a whole lot of winter fun and flavorful ale!"

"O: Like black pepper on your fruitcake? I didn’t think so either, but this ended up being a tasty beer. I usually prefer holiday ales balanced more toward toasted malt; this, though, was a nice change of pace."
"(O)- I always feel like winter seasonals are a dime a dozen, however this one is a bit more on the sweeter side yet the spices complement; do not overpower the base. One of the better ones this year."
""
"Two fingers of dark yet oddly glowing tan foam, looks backlit or something, full mix of bubble sizes and pretty good retention for the category, same could be said for the lacing, sticks well. Crystal clear liquid, deep coppery brown, inclines more towards red than orange, not that many bubbles but they rise with swift insistence, pretty enough overall. The nose is all cardamom, anise, pine sap, clove and cinnamon, huge cleansing lift in the nostrils, milk chocolate and orange peels, not getting the figs nor other fruit here, basically smells like the bowls of seeds and stuff at the entrance to an Indian restaurant. Medium-bodied, tightly woven carbonation, erect posture, on the dry side given the constituent elements. Ginger, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, cola, chocolate, light caramel. Again, has a sort of mentholated cleansing feel, fresh and tingly. Still not getting much fig or other dried fruits, some light apple or peach maybe. Soft undercurrent of blanched nuts. Easy to see how the intensity of the spices could polarize, love it or hate it. Finding it food friendly and lack of sweetness adds to versatility. Could not do more than a couple in a sitting but they would be enjoyable start to finish."
""
""
""
"Pours a one finger light tan head that fades quickly to a ring and leaves no lace. Cloudy dark amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Orange peel nose and flavor is spicy orange peel, figs are hidden. $2.09 for a 12oz bottle from Madden Beverage Saco, ME."
""

"Possibly the best winter holiday beer this year."

"A nice winter warmer. Multiple bottles would warm you up nicely, and if you're a fan of the spiced beers, a handful of these would make for a happy evening. Easy to drink, as the spices approach the line but never cross it. A good choice for a seasonal because it would eventually wear on you."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good spiced winter warmer. I'll grab another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A decent beer. As noted the spices were a bit overbearing personally, but then again the style is an ""herbed/spiced beer"" so can't detract from that based on what it is. Still smooth however and does have ample complexity. Claims it is brewed with figs, spices, 4 malts and 2 hops which accurate to the taste. With an X-mas themed bottle and cool name, why not give it a try, tis the season!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the better examples of a winter warmer. I wasn't a big fan of the style...until I tried this one. Will drink again next Christmas."
""

"O: Definitely what I want to be drinking in front of the fire on a cold day. Tasty brew"
""
""
""
""
" The taste is good with lots of spice and and an orange zest and slight toasted malt with a mild caramel sweetness and very low alcohol in the taste with nice woodiness and a slight hint of cinnamon bark. The taste has a nice amount of dried fruit and hops bittering but not too bitter with a slight dry alcohol taste in the finish. Overall this is a great beer for celebrating -it is strong but you don't really taste any alcohol since the spice covers it pretty well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Talk about a full bodied beer! Had this ale back to back against another Christmas one and this wins in the taste category hands down. Pours a dark bet color. Significant amount of white grayish lacing at the top, quickly dissipates though. Nutmeg and other Christmas spices emanate from the glass. Get a hint of orange peel in the taste, along with a Carmel toffee taste. Bottle says that it includes figs which definitely comes out on the palate. Mentions that uses two hop varietals and 4 malts. Not sure what tradition of Swedish glogg brewing is but apparently that's the metho of brewing. An excellent Christmas ale."

"While I did not pick up any booze in the aroma I tend to pick it up a b it more in the taste. That could be the ginger but it tastes more like booze to me. Lingering finish. Still a nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As a Christmas brew, this did the job."
""
""
"This is a nice beer to grab one of for a change of pace, but not sure you can have too many without tiring of it."

"O- It left me craving for a hoppy beer."

"RJT"
""
""
"O - I enjoyed the beer, it is just not high on my list of beers to have if I have the choice. I was glad to try it, and I'm glad I only bought one, because with the sweetness, more than 12oz would have been too much for me. Just not my kind of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"So to sum up, it's quite an interesting beer. It's got some complexity to it. If you like spiced beers you'll love it. I really enjoy them at Thanksgiving and Xmas get togethers, and I always bring a few with me to pass around, but I have a feeling that Uncle Joe is NOT going to like this one. That's OK, he likes Old Fezziwig - I'll have another one of these!"

"Overall: Not a bad Christmas beer. I'm not a huge fan of cardamom but like Southern Tier using a spice you (or I) rarely see in other Christmas brews. They do a great job pairing the other flavors well with it. An enjoyable offering that I would order with a seasonal dessert or on a cold night around a fire."
""
"Pours a dark amber with dark ruby hue. Good head with nice lacing that dissipates . The nose is a WOW of spice. Ginger, cinnamon, clove and either cardamom or allspice against a slight dark malt sweetness. Medium body and carbonation. The taste is like the nose - an exceptional blend of spice against a slight malt sweetness. Well balanced with a focus on Christmas spices that is expertly taken to the limit of flavor. Clean finish with a burst of spice flavor and a nice warm burn. If you like spice, this beer is for you."

"A very tasted spiced Christmas ale, good flavor and feel and another winner in the 2x series from Southern Tier."
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this Christmas Ale but I don't think it's Southern Tiers greatest accomplishment. I do think it's good and worth drinking again."
""
""
""
"Tasted like someone dumped the whole spice cabinet into this mix."
""
""
"Overall, OK, at first it's not too bad, with the syrupy flavors and fruit, spices are nice at first too, but all that quickly wears out it's welcome and turns into a not so pleasant beer, everything becomes too much, too syrupy, too much bitter spices, bad bitter aftertaste, too much fusel alc, etc."
""
""
""
""
"OKAY, words cannot describe how bad this beer is. It has a beautiful color just like the 2X IPA, but it smells like a bad candle. And the taste, what on earth were they thinking? First off to take a beer as hoppy and citrisy as their 2X IPA and mix it with cinnamon seems bad enough, but it's like they put half a container of it in every beer. It has a painful taste, like chugging a bottle of cinnamon, I truly have no idea how anyone enjoys this beer and at the craft beer store I work at it is EASILY the most hated beer among the staff not just of the seasonals but of any beers. Never would expect this from Southern Tier."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Tastes like Christmas. No idea it was 8% abv until I went to write the review, it hides it very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a worthwhile seasonal. I picked up a couple unusual characteristics that were pretty neat. The first thing I smelled was freshly baked sugar cookies. I'm not really sure how or why, but there you have it. Secondly, the taste and maybe even mouthfeel had the sense of eggnog. Who knows. I'll update if for some reason my sniffer and tongue were nutty tonight. Overall, this was delightful. I would probably get this again."
""
""
""
"Low carbonation, dark complexion. Figs apparent in the smell as well as the spices, faint touches of eggnog (probably the spices). Nice medium mouthfeel, spicy flavoring with a hint of alcohol, not overwhelming. This is a solid spiced winter seasonal."
"O: Reminds me of fruitcake and gingerbread though the spicing is a little aggressive for my palate - it is a nice representation of a Christmas or Winter Warmer style. Alcohol is very well hidden."
"Draft version had less hot notes and more sweetness."
""
""
"Got a growler of this to share with my music listening buds. As expected, one of my buds brought a growler of Great Lakes Christmas Ale which this compared very favorably against. It wasn't a competition, rather just a means of expanding horizons. The spices of this work very well, as do the malts which underlie this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a good take on a Christmas beer. Spice may be a bit sharp for some, but if spices are your thing like they are mine then grab this offering. It's a well crafted style and a bit odd, but tasty nonetheless."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a reddish brown with a half inch white head that leaves behind scattered lace. Smell is nutmeg, cinnamon, clover, ginger, and vanilla. Taste all of that, a winter warmer that has loads of spices. Body is medium, nice amount of life, not dry, and goes down easy for its 8%. This is solid, a little more spicy than I prefer, but it is a nice change. Pumpkin beer fans should like."
""
"A good beer that oozes Christmas spirit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As I guy who typically doesn't like heavily spiced beers, I can still respect this. Especially since it is taking its inspiration from glogg, a drink that is quintessentially spicy and fruity. The malty richness provides a strong enough base to ground the spices, even if they do come on very strong. Any fan of spiced winter beers will enjoy this."
""
"Appearance is a deep clear red with tan head. Nice retention and lace. The nose is all Christmas. Tons of spices with cinnamon, ginger and spruce being the most prevalent notes. Some fruity notes are present, most significant is orange. Taste is much like nose plus some nice malty graham cracker notes. Moderate sweetness here with the spices hitting hard at the finish. The finish is dry and leaves lingering notes of cinnamon and ginger on the palate. Mouthfeel is moderate and well carbonated. Overall, a solid winter warmer, worth a try if you like your beer spiced."

"O:Very bold attempt by Southern Tier. The flavors are very in your face but they work well. Named perfectly since this does taste like a Christmas Tree. Bit of a spice bomb which I'm not usually a fan of but I could drink this again if the mood hits."

"Ruby colored beer with a billowing head khaki tan head leaves fine lacing. Aroma is full of nutmeg, cinnamon, clover and other Christmas ales, Meant to attract some of the Great Lakes Christmas ale following, but in a higher alcohol format. An ale brewed with figs, orange peels, and spices look I'm getting super malts and spice additions. Overall a super sweet cloying mess that should be drank in moderation I'm willing to vogue for this spiced beer but at the alcohol level and spice discomforts I would wait until this is your last option to drink an Xmas ale. Overall look forward to other highly spice and highly drinkable offerings."

"Pours a deep dark ruby cinnamon red with a small beige head. Aroma of sweet spices, cinnamon, dark fruity notes with a bit of orange peel. Taste same as aroma flavor is sweet bitter cinnamon and orange peel, and sweet spices. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation and a sweet spices bitter mouth feel. Finishes with a combination of sweet spices, lots of cinnamon with a bit of an bitter orange peel flavor on the end. A bit on the sweet side but overall an interesting yet drinkable take on a holiday brew."

"Pours a deep reddish brown coppery color with a half finger slightly off white head which leaves a little lace. The smell is christmas. There is dark fruits, cinnomon, nutmeg, fruit cake, and holiday spices with hints of citrus. The taste follows suit but not as powerful. There is a sweet dark fruit molasses flavor with hints of nutmeg and spices. A good flavor just not as there as the nose. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and a little slick and smooth. Overall its a very good beer, a nice addition."

"Overall- Not the best Christmas beer I've ever had (that goes to La Grivoise De Noel), but hits all the right notes and doesn't go overboard. It's also fairly easy to get a hold of (if Southern Tier distributes in your area) and reasonably priced. I'll definitely be picking this one up again."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/31/2012. Pours lightly hazy ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, fig, orange peel, caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, clove, nutmeg, floral, brown bread, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of malt, fruit, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, fig, orange peel, caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, clove, nutmeg, light anise, floral, brown bread, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, orange peel, brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, light anise, floral, brown bread, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity of malt, fruit, and spice flavors; with a great sweetness/spice balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice spiced Christmas ale! Great balance and complexity of malt, fruit, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

""
"The feel is nicely thick with a bit of heft in its sturdy body. It's smooth, and doesn't offer so much a crispness as a bite, even as it hits the lips. It does nip a little hard initially, but the smoothness wins out and tones it down."

"This pours a clear, medium brown color with a slight, beige head. The scent is slightly sweet with some spice and fruit. The taste is strong and bold but has great complex flavors. There is a great blend of malts and spices along with a slight hoppy finish. A great brew for those cold winter months!"

"I have had glogg in my time and as far as a beer representative goes this is a pretty accurate rendition. There is a lot of flavor going on and somehow the flavors harmonize. There's a little bit of clashing that goes on here and there with some of the more aggressive flavors, but that's par for the course. Fermented sweetness, a faint pine undertone, slight warnings of a vodka and red wine hangover. Southern Tier has earned some more brownie points by resonating with my semi-Scandanavian heart."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a great beer to drink in front of a raging fire in the winter. Slow sipping but very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, it did taste like an intense Christmas cookie so given the name I think they hit their mark. I do think however that the spices could have been toned down a bit to let some of the malty flavors come out. I think it compares reasonably well to other Christmas beers out there though overall."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, deep, blood-amber coloring with a thin, filmy, cloudy, off-white head that coats the surface. Aromas of heavy spicing and fruit, with a rich, sweet cherry and berries backbone giving rise to all-spice, coriander, and fennel. Smells very festive and warm. Flavors are rich and roasty, with a cinnamon and cider theme. Cherry cordial and licorice form the base of the brew, with the all-spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg filling the rest of the palate. Candied overtones, with an evergreen highlight throughout. It's like Yankee Candle made a holiday beer flavor in drinking form. Screams christmas time. The aftertaste is more of a linger of the spicing, with a strong herbal tea characteristic. Filmy, slightly lingering finish to the brew. Overall, you don't really notice the 8% ABV while drinking, which makes it easier to drink a few of these at a time, in turn keeping you nice and toasty on those cold winter nights. Interesting brew."
""
"O- It was OK. Nice to sip on it's own at a holiday party, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. There are plenty of other great holiday beers out there to drink instead."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall the 8.0% abv seems gentle at first but does provide a cough medicine like flair upon warming. The spicing, while event toned and refined, seesm more supplementary hiding in the background.The malting is good. This drank more like a bock with some fruity tones."
"D: not too shabby of a holiday brew. lots of residual sweetness and holiday spice makes this more of a sipper to me. enjoy during the right week and you will be happy."
"O - Too heavy on the nutmeg and the cinnamon to really enjoy, I had high hopes but after 2 the last 4 of the pack are going to be given away."
""
"A dark amber color with a bit of a head. The smell is cinnamon, sweet and roasted malt. Spices and flavors such as Cinnamon, nutmeg, and hops. Mouthfeel is medium This one is over the top and if your not an adventure seeking beer drinking look elsewhere."

""
""
"O-A solid winter brew, very spice heavy which hurt the balance."
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet figs, nutmeg, and spice. In the taste, light spice of nutmeg and cinnamon, with a dry faint fruitiness of figs and raisins. A mellow spice bite bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruitiness of figs and spice in the aftertaste. A small spice and dark fruits, quite a sleeper!"
""
"O: Not a bad holiday spiced beer that showcases the spices but has enough balance to still drinkable. I was nervous when about the brewers description saying this is double spiced but is isn't as strongly spiced as other beers I have both commercial and homebrewed."
"The Rest: Quite spicy, but with enough body underneath to make it tolerable. Overall a decent winter warmer."

"I'm usually impressed with Southern Tier beers. They always seem to be spot-on, challenging, and very rewarding. Unfortunately, that's not the case with 2XMas. It's a clear, reddish colored liquid with a thin tan head. Medium carbonation. The smell is fruit and spice, with a bit of toasted malt in the background. The fruit is hard to place. The label says fig, but I'm getting a lot of orange and lemon peel. The peel/rind theme plays into the taste as well, which is also full of fruit and spice...a bit of bitterness from the former, as well as the latter. Firm body, good balance. The beer just doesn't really come together, though...the bitterness is distracting. Not bad, just not up to my expectations."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber brown color with a half inch of off-white. Aromas of pine, clove, cinnamon and citrus zest aroma, a little yeast. Flavors of clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, anise and roasty malts. Tartness and warmth is certainly supplied by ABV and malt. Medium mouthfeel along with some soft carbonation throughout. Finish offers a doughy feel and a spicy taste. Overall, a really nice holiday surprise for 2012."

"1.5 finger head with nice lacing on a clear, deep copper amber body. Brown sugar, milk chocolate, caramel and bready malts, with herbs of cinnamon and nutmeg. Flavors follows well with caramel, bread malts, brown sugar and more spices, mostly nutmeg and cinnamon again which perfectly go with the season. Medium body ad light to moderate carbonation. A nice seasonal. Not all that different from many of this genre as a winter release but still good nonetheless."
"O: I've never had Swedish Glogg but I can imagine this being an accurate representation of the style because it goes well with cold weather. The flavors are strong as is the ABV but it comes together to make a good beer for the season. One bottle is enough, though, and I'm glad I didn't get a 6-pack."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had all the things that I look for in the style and little more complexity and balance than I normally find in this style, I thought that worked pretty well with this beer. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth and the flavor held my attention but I don't think that I would want to follow it up with another one. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma , it's pretty intense with lots of spices going on, like I said it smells like Christmas in a glass. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad at all, but I could go with out the stickyness. I would buy a couple bottles for Christmas next year but this isn't a beer I'll be really stocking up on, I recommend giving this a try if your in the mood for a good spiced Christmas Ale. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it was pretty fitting for the holiday season and the aroma and taste seemed to embody Christmas in beer form. Southern Tier seems to be a pretty solid brewery and I think all three beers in the 2X series are good, I hope to see some new beers added to this series. Good job Southern Tier this is a nice Holiday brew, it makes me want to throw some logs in the fireplace."
""
"O: This has become my favorite holiday beer this season. It was hard to find but worth the search. It is a rare find to have a holiday beer that you can come back to over and over without just a one off, ""That was fun, now back to a real beer."" attitude."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep amber color, with a thin white head. Poor retention and no lacing. Smells of holiday spice and malt, slight alcohol notes. Tastes similarly, rich caramel malts up front with a good amount of spice character. Slight alcoholic taste towards the finish along with a very slight bitterness. Hop bitterness is almost non-existent, so this beer is unbalanced and malty. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, for the style, this beer does a fine job. Very good beer for the cold winter season. Very drinkable, medium body and low to medium carbonation. I recommend giving it a try if you're looking for a good winter seasonal for those cold nights."
"2XMAS ale pours a clear brown color, with a decent size lacing head. There are strong hints of cinnamon, ginger, and figs aroma. There is a strong malty backbone, with lots of spices mixing together; tastes like ginger snap cookie. Easy to drink and full flavor. Overall a fantastic Christmas style ale, full flavor, sweet, and a bit unique."

"O-very unique holiday beer. The pine is something that is typical of christmas but I havent found in many holiday beers. I would definitely pick this up again"
"Tastes like dark fruit jam on the tip of the tongue on cinnamon raisin bread. Rich creamy mouthfeel. Mild carbonation. Finishes with holiday spice to balance the sweetness. This is an awesome beer with complimentary flavors that really work well together. The flavors are actually kind of mild which makes it a nice supper. Can't detect the alcohol at all."
"O: Overall, one of the best, if not THE best Christmas beer I've had this year. Better than Anchor Christmas (as that stuff is just too spiced) and not quite as sweet as Anderson Valley Winter Solstice...just a really sophisticated, top quality Christmas ale."

"O - Not sure what Swedish Glogg tastes like, but this is pretty good. A very Christmasy beer."
""
""
"Overall, the spice character was not as offputting as some. There's good balance of the various spices, as opposed to some that are more dominant in one spice. That said, it's still a spice bomb. The bready malt counters the spices fairly well, but the sweetness is also over the top."
""
""
"D - This Southern Tier offering screams Christmas Beer in a good way... If it weren't for the medicinal notes on the palate this would be a top notch seasonal offering... In it's current form it's a very nice brew and likely worthy of a six pack investment each and every holiday season..."
""
""
"Overall, can't say I am overly impressed with this beer. I don't like overly sweet beers and this is one of them. In fact, I prefer Anchor's holiday beer over this., Not something I'm likely to pick up again."

"Amber reddish hue, not much head or lace. Smell is nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel, buttery crust, reminiscent of Pumking. Taste is spices..cinnamon, nutmeg; orange marmalade, brown sugar, raisins and fig newtons, buttery crackers crust. There is a little of the Pumking magic flowing in this one, but with a figgy-orange Christmas twist. Medium body, silky, well crafted. Very enjoyable."
"O. Solid for the style. Exactly what a winter warmer should be."
""
"Overall: This beer just screams Christmas, with its crazy spices and ultra sweet core. But I think it is great."

"Deep amber in color with hints of brown and a slight haze. Poured with a short off-white foam that was constantly fed by streaming bubbles. Cinnamon, clove, all-spice, and orange zest aromas with sweet fruit and malt sweetness beneath. Smooth, delicate, slightly oily feel with pleasant carbonation. Solid caramel and sweet dark fruit flavors from beginning to end that carry cinnamon and spice flavors overtop. Slight hop bitterness near the end followed by a spicy finish. Sweet up front with a wonderfully balances sweet, spicy and bitter middle and a spicy finish. Southern Tier brews always have nice character."
""

"Overall a very spicy holiday beer. Well hidden ABV and lots of malt. Good choice if you are in the mood for a holiday beer."
"O: tried this beer at both room temp and out of the fridge to warm along the way and it represented well at all temperatures. A nice holiday beer in the same spirit as Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. Nice warming, easy compliment to most holiday dishes, great for easy drinking with a little more heart and holiday ambience than a pale or year-round beer."

"O-I'd call this a winter warmer. it's an okay beer, though I expect more from Southern Tier. I got a bit too excited when I first saw this...I didn't know what to expect, but when ST names a beer 2XMAS....i expect it to taste completely like christmas. I'm not sure what that would be, but it wasn't this beer. definitely a decent drinker though, I'm glad i got this...but I probably won't be getting it again. the nose is where this beer should stay."
"D/O Drinkability is quite good for the elevated ABV of this 8.0% beer. Overall this is a fine seasonal beer. I enjoyed it and I believe that you will too. 4.0"
""
"O- Definitely one of the best Christmas ales I've had. Beautifully crafted,and dangerously delicious."
"Try a bottle fresh and then put another bottle away for a few months and then try it again. I plan on doing so, except that the next bottle I buy, I'll promptly age. It has potential."
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Light beige head, good retention on a body colored hazy tudor brown. Oily, soapy, sticky lacing. Aroma is gingerbready with a touch of oatmeal cookie, some brown sugar and dark fruit (dates). Taste follows suit with a slight hint of alcohol taste. I suppose this tastes pretty close to what I would expect out of a Christmas beer from Southern Tier and thats a good thing."
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Spicy, nutmeg, cinnamon, underlying orange peel. Warming and flavorfull, a nice match for a plate of Christmas cookies."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. The mouthfeel was a little lacking but the overall flavor profile delivers what it advertises as a Christmasy spiced holiday ale. Sometimes the spices are horribly overdone (mainly with clove or ginger) but here they are restrained and work in balance with each other and the base beer."
"2XMAS is your quintessential ""Winter Warmer"" that's designed for those Christmas parties. And with the alcohol strength to sooth the mind, it may just make the office party tolerable this year! (...now off to find those damn sugarplums.)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Hope this becomes an annual offering, one of my favorite Christmas beers, best to let it warm a little though to let the mintiness? blend in with the other spices"
""
""
"Singed caramel up front. Slight herbal bitterness follows, quickly overtaken by sweetish malt. Figs, gingerbread, and milk chocolate. Spices gradually increase into the finish. Nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon. Slightly roasted bitterness in the finish. Lingering malt sweetness. Medium-full body with a nice, creamy feel. A very nice, not overly spiced, winter warmer."
"Heated differences: Heated on the stovetop, the head was the creamiest of all, with better retention and lacing present. Aromas gave more of a nod to the dark fruits (figs) than the spices. The taste when heated became significantly more bitter and astringent - not pleasant. Aftertastes are dominated by burnt, roasted flavors. Overall, the heated version was my least favorite and was not something I'd want to repeat."
"O - Great beer, would recommend a six pack every holiday season. I will 100% be in the mood for this beer many times over the cold months, and might have to buy another sixer soon."
"Overall: I would say its a crowd pleaser. I had a try from another bottle and this beer was amazing this time around it was more bland and thin. Not great for the price but not awful at the same time. Wouldn't buy again but wouldn't turn one down either."
""
"That's not to say that it wasn't here, since I could certainly feel a slight buzz by the end of my session. Nice job on Southern Tier here not only with the beer but for coming out with something spiced that made me forget about all of the similar beers that lined the store shelves in the weeks leading up to Halloween. Got a nice crumb cake or bowl full of sugar cookies at home? Get this to go with 'em - they'll pair up quite nicely."
""
""
""
"This beer is typical yet unique. It has all of the traditional winter spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger, but the dark fruit makes all the difference. This beer has complexities, subtleties, nuances...It's really a well made beer. This is definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very enjoyable holiday seasonal with a good spicy taste. Will drink again."
""
""
""
"A wonderful winter seasonal brew with a bite. I don't taste the figs as much as as orange peel and nutmeg, it definitely hits the mark as an xmas beer. Quite drinkable on it's own and wonderful with a warm bowl of curry. Pleasant carbonation, a bit sweeter than I normally like but you can't tell this is a triple caliber abv. Would definitely buy again, I'm not sure I would want to drink more than one in a sitting though."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Medium bodied with tight carbonation and a heavy spice presence that's countered by sweet malt, dark fruit and a medicinal syrupy flavor. This medicinal flavor tends to be overwhelming in holiday beers it's kept in check here by the other characteristics. Lots of cinnamon, pepper, allspice and clove along with cherry cough drop and other dark berries. Slight alcohol sweetness but the high ABV is well masked with little to no heat. A little heavy on the spices but it's a pretty good holiday beer that's easy to drink."
""
"O: Really enjoyed this beer, like the Old Man Winter one a little bit better than this, but overall a great festive brew. At 8%abv, you cant go wrong and the high octane isnt even noticeable, so thats a plus."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty much the holiday verision of pumking. Tons of in your face seasonal flavors. Good beer, that may be tough to drink multiples of."

"I was really hoping for more fig. Really over-spiced and somewhat cloying, but the alcohol is well hidden."

""
""

"A dark brown/mahogany color with a fair tan head that holds as a thin cover with decent lacing. The aroma suggests a definite holiday theme with sweet evergreen and light licorice malt. Very nice for a Christmas brew. The flavor follows with plenty of juniper nutmeg and cereal malt. Sweet spiciness and pretty thick malt presence. A good mix with medium body and a resinous feel, modest carbonation. A great seasonal brew that further confirms my continued faith in Southern Tier. Bravo!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I loved this great beer, and it's perfect for the holiday season. Perfect amount of dry fruit flavoring to go along with the smell. Tastes like dessert that can be enjoyed all day. Will definitely have this many times again."
""
"Maybe I'm just not cut out for most winter ales, but that cinnamon/nutmeg combination really just does not taste good to me. It tends to emphasize the booze & turn into a weird half-baked fruitcake sort of flavor. That said, I don't dislike all Christmas ales, but there's a certain cocktail of spices that rubs me the wrong way. Too bad, because I really dug that aroma."
""
""
""
"Taste starts with figs then some faint, toasted, orange peel. Middle has roasted malts, toasted figs, and some cinnamon and nutmeg. The spices aren't as dominant with the flavor as they are with aroma. The palate is a little syrupy, sweet overall, and a nice warmth from the alcohol do add to the Glogg-like affect of this beer. If you like spiced beers, this one is worth trying for sure. Or if you like the taste of liquid XMAS, pick up a sixer."
""
""
""
"2XMas is a nice spiced ale, and is a good brew to celebrate the holiday season."
""
""
"2XMAS goes in the glass a dark chestnut brown shade that is able to be seen through. Not to much activity on the top, just a sparse amount of off white bubbles that die down quick. Eventually, the beer looks dead. Smell gives me a mix of a spiced beer and a winter warmer. The fig representation is large, behind that caramel malt, some dark fruit scents, plum, and light chocolate. More spice with warming. This takes some sips to get used to, off put by the large fig presense, the caramel/chocolate malt combo comes through in the middle, followed by a spicy finish. Hops are minimal and not making a dent. body is smooth and a healthy medium with almost no carbonation down the gullet, this one is nearing flat, I think maybe this is intentional in the Glogg tradition. While I enjoyed this I dont see myself making this a tradition, good for the season though. Would probably pair well with some Christmas ham. Never having a Swedish Glogg, I am now intrigued to try one out."
"2XMAS is a pretty good holiday release. It’s definitely spicier than a Winter Warmer. Frankly, it’s a bit too spicy for me. As far as holiday beers go, it’s worth grabbing a six pack. There are a ton of great holiday releases though. This one’s solid, but doesn’t do a great job of distinguishing itself."
""
""
""

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it’s a decent beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a dark red amber with a thin, off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet and caramel malt and lots of holiday spicing; cinnamon, cloves, ginger and a slight cola element. Flavor follows taste with a substantial sweet malt body with a nice mixture of spices dominated by cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Somewhat nutty. Excellent medium body with pleasant creaminess. A nice warming winter beer; not sure why this isn't a winter warmer rather than herbed/spiced beer, but it does well on both counts."
""
""
""
"not that blown away by this one. flavor and smell seem a bit strange, i'll stick to old man winter or krampus for their winter seasonals."
"Overall: I think the spices and hops made the finish too bitter. The sweeter flavors needed to be featured a bit more."
""
""
""
"O: A fine beer, I prefer a little less spice in my winter seasonals, but I would definitely not turn down one if offered to me."
"A pretty clear reddish/brown body with a small eggshell cap. Some dots and lines of lace inside the glass. The nose is of baked dark bread, dark candi sugar, toffee, caramel, figs, orange peel, cinnamon, and coriander. On the palate, the figs and toffee/caramel flavors lay a foundation for the spices and orange peel to do work. The finish is dry from the candi sugar with a touch of residual sweetness and some of the bready malt to try and balance it out. Medium body, a bit syrupy. This is a nice little christmas ale that surprised me. The flavors and aromas are tightly wound into a well-crafted ale for the season."
"Strong Christmas-y aroma with an overwhelming cinnamon smell. Overall good mix in taste. Strong warm after taste, definitely a quality holiday brew."
"Overall a very enjoyable holiday beer. The warming effect was great."

""
""
"I just made a batch of Glogg and I love it, but this just isn't all that good. Way to spice heavy, like chewing on potpourri or sipping on your grandmothers candle."
"A dark and murky brown orange appearance with a small off white head. The beer is very christmas-y. An absolute ton of cinnamon and nutmeg. There is also clove and perhaps all spice. The malts are quite caramel and toffee based and are very subtle and are mere accents to all the beers spices. The feel is rather big and syrupy to this brew. It is a sipping winter beer that isnt quick to go down. This is on par with great lakes chrismas ale in terms of taste. This is a very, very christmas-y beer and a decent example of the style."
"This would be excellent to baste a ham. Mix it up with some brown sugar and reduce it then glaze that ham, man."
"I love a good malty winter warmer, and this one is a beaut! The 2XMas pours a dark ruby red color with a very small beige head. The head leaves some nice lacing around the glass. The nose is full of spices, including cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, allspice and a hint of ginger. This is one of the most aromatic beers I have ever encountered. The flavor is syrupy sweet. Just a touch of hops makes this beer very drinkable. Smooth texture and medium body. A rather dry finish for the style kept me ready for every sip. Another quality beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"O: Overall I feel that this has qualities that would win people over, even if they are not fans of spice beers. I would recommend it to those who enjoy Belgian style dark ales. It's very easy to drink and tastes great."
""
"O: A welcome addition to the ""winter warmer/spiced holiday"" beer category. Nice and warming at 8% ABV, this spiced brew allows you to get warm and cozy without tipping over into the realm of complex, winter sipper. No overwhelmingly good qualities, but some interesting, strong winter characteristics."
""
"Overall: Really tasty holiday brew...lots of malty sweetness and enough holiday spice..One of their better small bottle beers..I will pick this up again."

"Overall - A little too much grut beer flavour for me. Not one of my favourite tasting style of beer unfortunately. Still pretty festive and tasting, and it's probably worth having at least one of these this holiday season."
""
"Overall worth picking up if you love the pumpkin spice fall beers or heavily spiced Christmas beers. These guys know how to brew great beer!"
""

"they've all been spectacular"
""
"D - This beer screams christmas. This is how I remember Great Lakes Christmas tasting years ago although I had it recently and it tasted like a spice mess. Not sure if the beer changed or my palette. I really enjoyed this one. I love figs and had a hard time picking them out."
""
"D/O:This is a Great Lakes Christmas clone that beats it's inspiration at it's own game. It's novelty beer. Packed full of spice. If you're into ""Christmas beer", this is probably worth trying at some point during the holiday season. But, having purchased 4 bottles, I'm feeling like that's 3 more than I need."
""
"Overall – I don't mind this beer, but a bit too much going on and too much alcohol taste to make me actively seek it again. I would probably still recommend this to someone who hasn't had it."
""
""
"This beer tastes like Christmas. Sugar cookies, cinnamon, nutmeg, almond, lots and lots of spice in this beer. It tastes good, but isn't really to my liking. It has a medium body with low carbonation. I probably wouldn't buy this one again, it's the first Southern Tier that I really didn't care for. I much prefer Krampus."
""
""
""
"overall: Another fine holiday treat as well as another fine 2X from ST."
""
""

"Slightly oily from the high alcohol level. Lots of pumpkin pie spice flavors. Rich body, low carbonation. Rather one dimensional in the flavor."
"Overall –The end of the flavor profile leaves a nice spiced flavor on the tongue which mixes quite well with the fruit flavors of the brew and the warming feel of the alcohol. Overall a warming, but drinkable brew with a good sweeter spiced flavor."
"Overall - a nice winter warmer. Not sure if I like it 100%. I could see having 2 of these, but not an entire 6 pack. It has a spicy sweetness that I find with some belgian and scotch ale beers that I'm not terribly fond of, but it's a good winter warmer!"

"A good spiced beer, a not-so-unique Christmas ale. Nothing I'd particularly seek out next year, but not disappointing, either. Another way of saying it is that there are a lot of these kind of beers out there. So, if you like other spicy, warming Xmas ales, you'll probably like this one."
"I was really hoping Southern Tier used their Pumking magic with this beer, but no. I'm a huge fan of the spiced Christmas ales, but this one is lacking flavor. It's similar to Great Lakes Christmas Ale and Thirsty Dog 12 Dogs of Christmas, but lacks the depth. I was expecting something bolder from Southern Tier."
"This one pours a clear, deep ruby red with one finger of cream head. Little lacing or retention but looks promising. Heavy scents of spices, malted barley, dried fruit, and booze. Not sure what Swedish Glogg is but it makes for a tasty beer. Heavy on the spices here; cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. A very malty backbone with some hop bitterness in there too. Very boozy finish and aftertaste, warming. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Mild carbonation with a slick finish. Overall, a nice, festive Christmas ale with solid flavor."

"A tad early for any decorations or festive merry-making, but I'm too much of a ticker to let a new Southern Tier 2X beer sit on the bench. This stuff pours a clear sunrise garnet topped by a finger of dusty wan tan foam. The nose comprises ginger, light peppermint, brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice, gingerbread cookies, and candied orange peel. The taste focuses on that orange peel, along with a bit of rye bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and ginger. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda grainy feel. Overall, a pretty solid Christmas beer, one that certainly lives up to its billing as a glogg beer, though the spicing may be a bit much."

"Poured into a nonic a deep amber tinged brown with very little head to speak of,what there was was off white color.Deep fig and winter spice notes in the nose,alcohol and fruit cake notes linger.Candied figs with the orange peel underneath on the palate,cakey and rich with mild drying hops to keep the sweetness from going over the top.The lack of carbonation is actually good in the feel,it's mellow and almost chewey.A real warmer and true to the CHRISTmas season."
"a cool winter beer, with figs and orange peel. the pours is darker brown with a tanish head nice and thick and lasting. the nose is really christmasy, like mulled wine almost, clove and anise, orange and definite sweetness from the figs. my first fig beer i think. the flavor is the same as the nose, with all the elements mixing together really nicely. sweeter on the back end, like molassas, with a huge malt body, dark and roasty but not black. finish is quick for a beer of this style. big body, enough bubbles, and plenty of booze for the cold evenings. overall a clever winter warmer that i will be enjoying all holiday season long."

"O: Good stuff. Bigger than your usual holiday offering, and while the spice takes center stage, as is typical for a ST beer, it's no slouch in the hops department. I like."
""
"These Christmas Ales are hit-or-miss for me. The first year I encountered them, I made the mistake of buying too many and got really tired of them. This is one of only two that I plan on buying this year. I could have done a lot worse. I was kind of hoping Southern Tier would do for Christmas beers what they did for pumpkin beers with Pumking, but this one doesn't differ too much from the other winter warmers that are out there. It's on the same level as Great Lakes Christmas Ale, which sells really well in this area every year. Definitely recommended for fans of the style."

"deep copper colored body was clear, but had some floaty bits in it. The smell was very herbal and spruce like, and really made it obvious that this was a winter ale. The taste on the other hand was quite a bit drier and more delicate than other winter warmers. It was as if the winter spices and herbs had been thrown into an Oktoberfest beer. There were notes of honey, raisin, brown sugar, and caramel in the taste, followed by a herbal bitterness, and a cinnamon finish. The body was light and creamy, rather than sticky and dense. This was an nice winter treat."
""

"a pretty decent beer, but it wont make my list for must buy winter beers. reminds me of a stronger version of great lakes christmas ale."
""
"O: Admittedly, these heavily spiced winter beers are never quite my thing, but this seems almost paragonal of the said style, so it earns itself bonus points. This will be my future standard for winter warmers until further notice - naturally, this is an easy one to recommend."
"PRETTY GOOD, NOT MUST HAVE!"
""
""
"Definitely fits the bill as a holiday beer. This may very well be the best holiday ale I've had. It's big and bold with sweet and spice and everything nice. Very warming and just really hits the mark for being a Xmas brew."
"Flavorful, fruity, sweet, highly spiced...tastes like a holiday fruit cake, in a good way. On the heavier side mouthfeel wise. Would work well with holiday desserts or as a holly jolly night capper. I like it"

"This beer poured out brown-ish red color with a thin white head. The head fades rapidly. The smell of the beer has a pretty good spicy aroma to it. The taste is sweet with a spicy flavor, some berry notes and cinnamon mostly. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a smooth carbonation to it. Overall it's a decent holiday brew. Worth trying."
"Overall - Really tasty, and lots of flavor. One of the more spice heavy beers ive had. The malts are roasty and work well with this beer. Hops are buried under eveything to were i dont taste them at all, but other then that its a great spiced beer. Really easy to drink, so the Alcohol can sneek up on you. This could pass as apumkin beer really, but the cinnamin nutmeg give it enough of a winter warmer feel. Worth a drink for sure."

"O/D-Must eat with a Gingerbread man! This is Swedish satisfaction to the max! Haven't run across a 'Glögg' before, but they are pretty damn cool and perfect for ushering in the Holiday spirit. I was very skeptical of this beer, but I ended up enjoying it. I can't wait to scream ""MY BEER TASTES LIKE SANTA!"" to the next person I see."
"The beer pours a dark, red-brown color with a dense, fluffy tan head that fades, but never completely dissipates. The nose is rich and spicy with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar. It's very appealing considering the different spice profile ST used in this beer compared to other over-the-top winter warmers It's almost like the goose island winter brown ale for comparison. The taste is well spiced with a modest fig sweetness and semi-dry finish. It drinks like liquid dessert, but doesn't get old. The body is rich and inviting. Honestly, this may be one of my favorite winter beers considering the unique spice profile, drinkability, price, and availability. I just want to get into a wool turtleneck and eat a winter ham while drinking this beer."

"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 10/17/12. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a clear ruby red color with about a quarter inch off-white head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing. Aroma is sweet and spicy, it smells like ginger, cinnamon, orange peel, candied oranges, figs, and some cloves. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, except that there's a slight bitterness noticeable. Also, the aroma seems stronger compared to the flavor of the beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, I know I'll be enjoying the rest of my 6-pack! $10.99 a sixer."

"again ; heavy on the spice for aroma and taste. I get a very satisfactory ginger, figs, spice, anise nectarine, and something like molasses."
"O- It's the Christmas version of Pumking!!! You can taste the graham/gingerbread cracker crust in the pie! It's rediculous!!! LOL! The best winter brew I've ever had!"
"Overall Rating: 92/100"
"Overall a very interesting brew thats great for the season. Has the spiciness that I look for yet with a nice drinkabilty and a high ABV."
