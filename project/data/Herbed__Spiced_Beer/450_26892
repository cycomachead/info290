Keeping in mind the time that the recipe for this and all the other Ales of the Revolution series, this review is for a glass at a cellar temperature. When I had my first bottle right out of the refrigerator the spruce took over and ruined the beer.

The aroma is interesting, with some very strong molasses notes and hints of the malt. The taste, though, is really where this beverage becomes unique. It opens with the molasses but transitions into a moderate and definitive spruce flavor. I didn't mind it and it reminds me of walking through evergreens, where the aroma from the trees is so strong you taste it. It's not overwhelming, but you can't miss it. There's a nice weight to the body and it's quite smooth. Well-made and different, it might not be one I'd drink regularly, but it's definitely worth trying.","delta490","Apr 19, 2014"

3.89,9,4,3.75,4,4,3.75," the Taste has a nice flavor of malt up front with a woody hop and the spruce provides a subtle earthy and clean element to the somewhat sweet flavor. The spruce is aromatic and contributes to the taste but the bready taste is the malts primary contribution with a subtle molasses element adding flavor toward the middle. Overall I really enjoy beers like this that have a traditional element or a backstory as to why the ingredients were used. I think this is very drinkable and would probably handle several in a sitting.","Slatetank","Jan 30, 2014"

3.79,6.2,3.25,4.25,3.75,3.25,3.75,"Appearance is a muddy brown with a burnt orange hue on the edges. There was a thin layer of head most of which dissipated rather quickly. The nose had the definite essence of spruce - like a Christmas tree in a glass. Spruce notes certainly were noticeable in the flavor profile as well. There was a mild hint of similar spices and a simple but pleasant semi-dry finish. This beer was a nice change of pace, but there is nothing particularly outstanding here beyond the creative use of the spruce flavors.","57md","Jun 25, 2013"

I'm definitely not a big fan of spruce or juniper flavor (I hate gin with a passion), but fortunately this beer isn't too potent in that area. Taste of woody spruce and sap, fairly balanced by brown sugar sweetness and molasses, herbal, nutty, with somewhat medicinal notes. Medium body, and decent overall. For what it's worth, this is okay, but it's not something I'd go for more than once or twice in a lifetime. Luckily Yards has lots of other good stuff to chose from.","Rifugium","Nov 16, 2012"

Didn't know what to categorize it as but upon originally ingesting it, I myself as well as friend have said "it's like drinking a spruce tree". I've had Christmas beers that have been much more overspiced, but I think this is adequite and not overdone. It states that it's brewed in the fashion of Founding Fathers and is in Yard's Ales of the Revolution pack. I've categorized this as the Thomas Jefferson but a little less bite and a little more pine. Once again I'm jocking this beer as it is from one of my favorite breweries.","Ryanm1","0"

Light to medium bosy, smooth and chewey, some breadiness and touch of sweet malts in this beer, odd balance with minor floral hops and the spices for a weird sweet/heavy bitter and light mix.

This, however, is one of those beers that reminds me that modern brewing recipes and techniques are a wonderful thing. The beer is an amber color, with a modest white head. It's smell is tree-like, with the spruce nearly overpowering. Still, it's fresh, with a lively malt undercurrent. Really, the smell is engaging. The taste, however, is where the overwhelming comes into play. It's dry-ish, with the spruce, woody component playing against the malt. Not really all that appealing to me.

The aroma provides a feeling of what it must be like to dry hump a Christmas tree: there is little but evergreen here, although maybe a little bit of pepper creeps in. The flavor is actually more balanced, which is kind of a let-down, with a dull graininess creeping in to muddle the woodsy spruce character. The texture is fine but mostly average. Overall, the distinctive spruce aroma makes this beer, but it's too bad that the flavor can't meet the expectations that are established by the first smell.

It is pleasantly malty with plenty of toffee and brown sugar/molasses notes. I also detect some raisin and perhaps a bit of toasted malt like character. The spruce is only a rumor in the aroma, mostly coming off as herbaceous. The flavor is quite nice with a great balance. Malty overall with a sweet caramelized profile that mingles with some earthy hop like flavors(interesting as I do not believe hops are used in this beer at all) and subdued spruce essence that are most evident in the slightly medicinal finish. It's a much different flavor than that of say piney hops, and it really melds well with the malt instead of standing against it. I am also getting a bit of dried raisin or cherry character similar to what I smelled in the aroma. This is only my second beer brewed with spruce in it, but it is infinitely better than the first which was dominated by Christmas tree aroma and flavor. The mouthfeel on this beer is superb. Very creamy with subdued carbonation and a medium body. It goes down quite easily, but is not necessarily the kind of beer you would drink a lot of in one sitting.

The flavor was even more impressive with a big macintosh apple influence, mixed with juicyfruit, mint, and molasses, and then dissolving to a crisp mac apple/mint finish, which lingered afterwards.

It isn't long before the beer is left with only a thin ring of lace along the top of the beer. Nose includes a bit of caramel maltiness along with a bit of a citrus zip that isn't quite hops but is close to it. Taste upfront is an overwelming amount of the "spruce" addition. It is quite spicey and it lingers right on through until the aftertaste. Body of the beer has some maltiness but the spruce really distracts from the other flavors that might be in this beer.

Mouthfeel was medium and on this iteration, not only did I get that fresh mintiness, but I could also perceive the molasses on the tongue. Is my palate becoming more sensitive or did they tweak the recipe in the last six years? Finish was semi-dry with the commingled flavors of pine and molasses really lingering well after the swallow.","woodychandler","Aug 03, 2007"

3.92,9.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours with A good mocha brown head forms after a rough swirl and succeeds slowly leaving dots of lacing. A nice shine to the light, a darkened mahogany brown in colour. The aroma is pleasing, in an odd kind of way, boasting notes of chocolaty mousse and spruce with definite notes of brown sugar, ginger and molasses - neat like something that should be baked! The mouthfeel could use a little texture beyond the dryness of the spruce, really chokes the mouth, but it does yield a world of flavour. A lot of spruce with hints of nuts (hazelnut, walnut) and malts. I really like this as an alternative to other styles, there is a lot that can be done with this style. I hope to see Spruce beers catch on a little more, I could see brewers doing interesting things with it...","biegaman","Mar 09, 2007"
3.8,6.4,4,4,4,3,3.5,"Poured out a mahogony brown with a creamy thick off white head, average lacing. The nose is fresh, winter forest, pine, cleaner, spicy, with a bit of malt character providing backbone. The taste is more like a brown ale with cinnamon, but it is really spruce, evergeen, piney, actually fairly refreshing and well complemented. Has a distinct ginger note, almost like ginger-beer. Has a light body and light carbonation. Fairly drinkable, but you have to be into the flavor. A nice and well executed variation.","dherling","Mar 01, 2007"

1.9,-46.8,4.5,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,"First I wanna mention the really cool blue bottle this came in, nice touch. Poured a very dark amber with a big creamy white head. Slow fade left a thick coating of gooey lace on the glass. This looked very very nice, but looks can be decieving. Smell was how do you say, odd. Smelled like a pine tree air freshner, very dry, with hunts of flour, yeast, almost tree bark. Caramel, bread, and other sweet smells came through as it dried. The taste did not suit me well at all. Only word I could think of is huh? Tasted like a soda, very light and highly carbonated. Sugary, amost trying to be fruit like but not making it. Did have a dry finish, but I could barely get the glass down. This was one of the strangest beers I have ever drank. It was like chewing on a fresh cut xmas tree, but not in the good way.","mikesgroove","Beers"
3.57,0,4,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Gotta love the blue bottle plus it keeps more light out than the other varieties...appears a chestnut ruby amber in body with a nice tan head leaves some even thick coats of lacing down my glass. Aroma is very pleasant with outdoorsy spruce tips, fruity toastsed malt tones with an evident maple syrup character, however I stand corrected b/c the label states it contains molasses I can definitely smell some concentrated thickened sugar. Flavor...spruce ain't no joke, kinda like drinkin' your christmas tree water, but in addition to the pine tree flow this beer offers subtle malt sweetness with the spicing coming from the tree nice flowing ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lighter more moderate carbonation but the flavors stay on the palate. Drinkability is definitely one of the most interesting brews I have had in awhile I'm glad I gave it a go can't wait to try more strange colonial style brews.","WVbeergeek","0"

3.82,7,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"It's an interesting brew, and pretty good for what it is. But, one is enough before it becomes too much. A good one to try for a historical replication. It is what it should be. But, still in all, you really have to be in the mood for spruce and molasses (which normally I'm not). It's easier to drink than other historical beers I've had. Worth trying for the experience.","jwc215","Oct 03, 2006"
4.01,12.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Based on what I've read, this does feel like an authentic Colonial-era ale. It's dark, malty, a little bit sweet, and I can see myself having a glass of it along with some artisan bread for breakfast.","edskirk3","Sep 25, 2006"
3.78,5.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a deep clear mahogany out of a blue bottle. Faint herbal smell along with hint of evergreen. Unusual taste that is hard to compare to anything else I've tasted.

4.25,19,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A full pint from the beer engine produced a dark dark amber brew with a huge creamy head. Mouthfeel amazingly creamy, casks really augment the Yards brews (and maybe all beers). The spruce aroma was barely detectable at first but came across on tasting as a well-integrated and very enjoyable component to a very balanced and drinkable ale, surprisingly so. Rather than overwhelming, the spruce finish felt like I was standing in a forest or at least in my grandmother's living room with the heat from huge 1950s electric lights releasing vapors from the Christmas tree into the air (threatening to burst into flames). Highly enjoyable and worth several pints.","kenito799","Sep 23, 2006"

4.14,16,4.5,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A unique beer, made from a recipe known to Benjamin Franklin. Pours a nice brownish-ruby red with a pale white-tan head. The head dissipates to a dusting in the pint, with some lacing. There seems to be very little nose on it, though - so I may have to revisit this later after living with the beer for a while. Taste and mouthfeel are truly delightful - nice roasty,well rounded malt flavor - hints of chocolate, spruce and a delicate bitterness rounding the finish. The beer has a nice 4.5% abv so could easily become a favored session brew for me. (Yes, you get the flavor of a good spiced beer, but a lot less of the guilt/abv - can you say winner?) I have to admit that I was skeptical at first, but I think Yards has produced a real winner with this brew - well worth seeking out and tasting. I'll definitely be having this the next time I'm at the City Tavern. As a side note, Yards' other Ales of the Revolution (Thomas Jefferson Ale, George Washington Porter) are quite tasty too, so drink a bit of history today!","stingo","Feb 08, 2006"

I was pleased, as it had a well-blended, rounded set of elements, as opposed to any one that jumps out and kicks you in the shins. Its toasty, roasty, piney and fine. The aroma thinned out a lot more rapidly than I expected, but that really was the onnly thing that I felt came up remotely short. It's a sassy style, and this one is just that as well. It goes down easily, especially with a chill in the air. I see a re-visit in the near future.","Foxman","Nov 18, 2005"

3.95,10.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"On tap at the City Tavern in Philadelphia. Deep copper with orange tints. Solid cream colored head. Distinct malt & hop aroma, but not real specific. The yeast character is prominent: lightly fruity, some vanilla, perfumy, quite unique. Fruity malt up-front, thin bodied, almost Belgian in a way with some earthiness. Some hop flavor mid-swallow leading into a bitterness that coats the back of the mouth and throat - very solid. Long lasting malt finish that just lays in your mouth. Very English except for the strength. A good pint that combines a good drinkability with a decent amount of complexity.","NeroFiddled","0"
