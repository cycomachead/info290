4.14,11.9,4.25,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall – 87.3 (Great): The label grabbed my attention from the start – ancient script writing in the style of my ancestors. Dogfish Head infuses their beer with almost anything that they can get their hands onto, and this particular offering is no different. The upside to the beverage is that it tastes almost akin to a juice or wine – very smooth and fruity with a distinct smell. However, the taste is lacking considering what I expected, and given the variations of ingredients that they added to the beer, perhaps eliminating one or two to have a more concise impression would be appreciated. Interesting to try and would certainly recommend sipping on it if available locally, but not something that I would ever come back to.","TheCraftBrewReview","Feb 16, 2015"

3,-18.9,,,,,,"Draft: Poured a light amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of hazelnut and unrefined grain is more or less interesting.  Taste is also dominated by unrefined grain with some strong notes of hazelnut with some residual sugars which is probably derived of the honey that was added to this beer. Body is light with medium carbonation and with no apparent alcohol. I appreciate all the historical research that went into this beer but not sure I really enjoy the final product enough to try this one again.","Phyl21ca","Aug 20, 2014"

If this is what the Etruscans were drinking (roughly) over 2800 years ago...then count me in for enjoying a cup from time to time. I picked up a bottle because the price was right (on sale - $5.99) and aged over a year it's still quite good. It paired very well with food (Chicken Paillard with curry gravy and red lettuce salad) and as a very fruity beer, I think it might go well with a variety of other foods as well. So for drinkability, I never got tired of the large glass I poured for myself and the alcohol is dangerously well hidden. Overall, an unique experience and worth a try. I might actually pick up a bottle again if the price is right. Not an amazing beer, but it has its charm.","damndirtyape","Jul 12, 2014"

The taste wasn't for me though with a lot of raisin and fruit flavors where I was hoping for more of the hazelnut and more heavy flavors. Still an interesting beer and it should be tried, but I don't see myself buying another.","WhiteHillsStore","Beers"

And Masa (Tamale) with over lays of Pomegranate, Raisin, Honey, Sweet/Dark Fruits, and honestly, some Flavors I just flat out can't put my thumb on (or never had....

Definitely lots of honey and pomegranate, banana, yeast and some fruit funk. Taste is along the same line with some citrus and pepper. Can't really pick out much hazelnut, which I was kind of hoping for. Feel is light and crisp, works well with the citrus and mild sour flavors. Moderate to high carbonation. Overall, a great trip off the beaten path. Some new flavors that you don't see much and I applaud DFH as always for trying new things. One of my favorite parts of these beers is reading the story of their inception and history, and this one has some great flavors to go with it.","Samuel906","Feb 21, 2014"

3.28,-11.4,2.5,3.25,3.5,3,3.25,"On the fuller end of medium body with a surprising amount of carbonation considering how quickly it went flat even with an aggressive pour. Tastes very similar to the notes of the aroma with an even stronger vinous dark fruit presence than expected. Some earthy, musty funk along with strong peppery spice. Again, I'm guessing the myrrh is really standing out with an earthy, resinous flavor along with some peppery clove and cardamom. The pomegranate raisin and other dark fruit flavors stand out throughout the palate but are most prominent toward the back end, lingering long after the finish. The pomegranate and raisin sweetness is very prominent along with grape, dark cherry, currant and other dark berries. Kind of reminds me of a prunier barbera wine with strong peppery spice and slightly tart, musty funk. Overall, not the most flavorful beer but more interesting than some of the other ancient ales. I wouldn't order or buy it again but I enjoyed trying it.","corby112","Jan 02, 2014"

The taste is where this gets interesting. I've read some reviews that it's just a mish-mash of many different things; and while that is kind of the case, it works well for me. The two things in particular that stick out for me are; dry and pomegranate. The dry finish is what reminds me of a nice red wine, so maybe that falls more under mouth-feel, but nonetheless...overall, I wish they brewed more of it; one of my favorite all-time DFH brews.","uld2541","Jul 27, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1 finger foamy light khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap. Minimal glass lacing and a ton of streaming carbonation that keeps the lace cap going. Aromas of apple, pear, raisin, banana, pomegranate, pepper, clove, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, wheat, bread, floral, herbal, and earthy yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruitiness with malt and spicy yeast esters. Taste of apple, pear, raisin, banana, pomegranate, pepper, clove, bubblegum, wheat, bread, honey, candi sugar, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, clove, pepper, bubblegum, honey, floral, herbal, wheat, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity flavors with malt and yeast esters; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, lightly syrupy, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent excellent ancient ale collaboration. All around nice balance and complexity of malt, fruitiness, and spicy ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one, as expected.","superspak","May 16, 2013"

Aroma has an upfront tart raisin character with pomegranate, nutty earthy tones with a sweet floral honey aspect to it. Pretty awesome historical beers brought back to life with Dogfish Head, Baladin, and Birra del Borgo. It smells like pomegranate honey infused jam on a thick crusted artisan bread, hints of spice are flowing as well. Flavor is upfront sweet and malty with extra sugar additions adding to the flow of sweetness, no real bittering hops that are mentioned on the label, so I'm guessing the earthiness from the Myrrh and Gentian root added to the mix of help balance this one out. Sweet and tart qualities arise from the juicy plump raisin to the tart pomegranates. Definitely a vinous wine like quality even the way the warmth of the 8.5% alcohol hits the gut and the palate, very complex and interesting beer that actually works together quite nicely. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied lighter carbonation than expected working toward the advantage of a pretty drinkable beer. Overall impression is that I like it and I'm glad that the three brewers with the help of a biomolecular archaeologist can put something like this back together from actual ingredients found before vino arrived in Italia.","WVbeergeek","Apr 28, 2013"

It's lighter in body, less sweet, and softer in character. The alcohol is not as apparent, and overall, it's a much more rounded and polished beer. I thought it looked good, it smelled good, it tasted good, and it was nice in the mouth with the body of a rich wine. I'd very much like to enjoy it again.

Some honey sweetness makes it's presence known as well, along with some Belgian yeasts. As the beer approaches room-temperature, the yeast and floral aspects begin to dominate.

Quite nice, I enjoy the aroma more than the taste but very ambitious and typical Dogfish Head awesomeness.","KickbacksSteve","Jan 26, 2013"

Immediately, I get the sense that this beer has wheat in it. Wheat-like aroma with dark fruits...raisins and prunes. I also get red grapes and the green apple comes through very nicely in the end of the aroma. Sweet honey with some ginger and cinnamon. I don't really pick up any pomegranate in the nose. Belgian yeast...with wine-like aromas. Taste is just as it smells, but a bit more vinous. This beer has some lovely wine characteristics with the grape flavors. Belgian yeast with tart red grapes and tart green apple flavors. There are tart flavors, but the beer is not tart overall. The raisiny dark fruit flavors mellow out the tartness. Honey flavors with a pomegranate juice-like finish. Such a complex beer. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and juicy at the same time. Just a little sticky. Drinkability is high, ABV is definitely there, but doesn't affect drinkability. Overall, this is a very complex, unique, tasty brew from DFH.

Complex flavor that is hard to differentiate, but nice fruit, cherry, light wheat, bittering herbs, woody, both sour and sweet elements. Finishes dryer with residual sweet/sour fruit elements at the back of the tongue. Light to medium bodied, but good mouth feel from active carbonation. Definitely unusual and fun to drink.

Taste was a bit grainy, toasty, nutty, with caramel malts and a touch of honey sweetness, bittering pomegranate essence, herbal hops. Kind of similar to Chateau Jiahu, I thought. medium body, fairly dry and woody, lighter carbonation, generally drinkable, but I was definitely glad to have a few people to split the bomber with.

It makes me picture the chica people spitting in that beer on Dicovery Channel. It's like all the DFH Ancient Ales are flashing before my eyes! It's a murky dark raisin look with a similar smell, coupled with a dark-sweet/honey smooth/elixir-type vibe. I picked this one in part to combat the crud 'round here lately.

So anyway, the beer gives off some spicy herbal notes on the nose along with some sweetness from the honey and malt. The taste of the beer has an interesting mix of flavors ranging from moderate sweet herbal notes to some dry spices in the finish.
