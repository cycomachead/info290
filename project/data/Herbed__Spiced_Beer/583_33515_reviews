"It may not be the Christmas season anymore, but the weather's close enough for me not to care too much right now.  This stuff pours a clear midnight amber-tawny topped by a finger of pale khaki foam.  The nose comprises candied orange peel, light cocoa, brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel, allspice, ginger, and a touch of sweetbread.  The taste brings in more of the same, the caramel drying out to a graham cracker-like situation and taking a back seat to the panoply of spices in play.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a tasty, spicy brew for these still-frigid times."
"Deep amber-gold color with small head and average lacing. Aroma is full of nutmeg and other dry spice. Taste is similar with a mouthful of dry spice, especially nutmeg, alittle too much. Feels ok on thr palate and definitely has an alcohol burn. Overall, not that pleasant of a beer, maybe just my taste..."

"Poured to a pint glass. Nice amber color with a 1 inch foamy head. Aroma of malt and caramel. Taste of dark malt & coffee, and finished with the taste of honey. Mild mouth feel. Overall a good choice for the Holidays!"
""
""
"Pours a reddish-burnt orange in color with a half-finger foamy & creamy off-white head that settles down to about 1-2mm along the top with more along the sides of the glass. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the glass in small spots. The aroma is very pleasant and is of sweet caramel malts with spices. Even more going on with the taste as the mix of spices (cloves, hint of ginger and juniper berries) with some orange zest. Very smooth and goes down easy. Love the mix of the above flavors on this seasonal brew. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Another great brew from Schlafly. MERRY CHRISTMAS!"
"Overall, a very standard Christmas ale that is pretty drinkable. For me, though, I prefer something a bit heartier that packs a bigger punch in this style."

"Good, full in the mouth taste. Beautiful pour and colour. Lots of winter spiciness and warmness. Glad I bought the six pack, not the single bottle."

"Basically Schlafly Pumpkin Ale but with Christmas spices instead of the pumpkin. Medium mouthfeel. Smell of clove, ginger, brown sugar. Taste is more like the smell."
""
""
"Overall, a pretty decent beer but could be better. While the notes are well done, they're not as  strong as they could be and that would probably improve the beer. However, the beer is pretty nice and I would recommend getting it."

"Brownish red with a moderately fizzy head, this beer is an attractive pour.  The aroma is a mix of malt, spice, and wood.  Full flavor, well balanced, and a spicy,ms harpness in the taste.  Full bodied."

"Schlafly Christmas Ale -----4/5."

"O - I had high hopes for this based on the Pumkin Ale being one of the best out there, and for the most part, it didn't disappoint. Looks like I am going to have a +rdev on this one based on the other scores. I think it could do without the orange/citrus aspect, and it does seem slightly boozy for what it is. However, it is an excellent winter warmer that I would likely enjoy again… if I wasn't surrounded by Great Lakes and Thirsty Dog :)"

"Better than their Pumpkin Ale if you ask me. Delicious spices and a sweet, malty aftertaste. Delicious."

"Pretty good for a Christmas ale. At 8% you really don't notice it. Still prefer other Christmas ales such as Great Lakes, though overall good"

"O-this a great beer by schlafly for the winter ale"
""
"O: Disappointed. Wanted to like it. But just too thin. Add some robustness and you have my vote."
""
"Overall: A good Christmas beer, and even better for a spiced one. I enjoy it and would gladly recommend to anyone looking for a solid seasonal choice."
""
""
"O - ok spiced winter warmer"
"O: Overall good Christmas ale, well flavored with spices and fruit notes. However it was too sweet for my tastes so I probably wouldn't buy it again."
""
"Another solid offering from Schlafly. Nice, deep mahogany color with some spice and sweet molasses in the nose. Taste is a beautiful mix of Christmas spices, toffee, dried fruits, and a hint of honey. A light bitterness helps balance the sweetness. A nice showing from Schlafly."
""
""
"Thank you Kirk for the beer!"

"Overall, this is an interesting beer. It has lots of similarities to Schlafly Pumpkin Ale with the spices. Frankly, this pretty much taste like Pumpkin Ale without the pumpkin, and maybe a hint more malt."

"Overall: Not bad at all! Pleasantly surprised with this. One of the top 5 Christmas ales I've had before. If only it were a little less sweet, I'd really like it. Wouldn't mind trying this again."
"O: Nice seasonal offering. Very well spiced. Not quite balanced enough by malt and other flavors. Doesn't taste of an 8.0% ABV brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste is heavy-bodied, malty and spicy, with a slight warmth at the finish. A perfectly enjoyable sipper, and an ideal ""winter warmer""."

"Overall: Been wanting to try this one for a while and I was not let down. Great beer to have by a warm fire to celebrate the holidays."
""
""
"Smooth rolling body. Caramel malt with a touch of soapiness on the front end. Creamy and big. Finishes with a pumpkin pie like spice flavor much like their pumpkin ale but not as good and with a bit of a drier rather than sweet flavor. Good with deceptive alcohol but its similarities to schlafly pumpkin are too apparent and this beer just isn't as good as the pumpkin"
""

""
""
"Maybe I will take from winter brews for a while.,"
"O - I thick its a descent Christmas brew. 8 ABVs could be hidden a bit more. burns a bit more than i wanted. Missing all forms of lacing. Solid carmel malt. I would buy this a christmas next year."

"O-A nice spiced Christmas brew, a good one, not the best, but good."

"O: definitely gets me in the holiday spirit. it's the perfect beer to consume pre- or post- holiday shopping - but next year i just need to remember, i don't shop enough to buy a case of it. the ABV is very well hidden, so consider that before you bust it out at the christmas office party."

"DELICIOUS, CELEBRATE THE HOLIDAYS PROPERLY!"

"Overall: very nice seasonal brew. Not usually a fan of seasonal beers but this one is very good and matches well with the season."
""

"a cool christmas beer, a drinker, not a novelty. the pour is amber to red, darker than that, but not brown at all, mostly clear, and a minimal head. the nose is really boozy, but juniper and cardamom permeate too. love the taste of this, complex, fruity, spicy, strong, and as drinkable as any holiday ale or winter warmer out there in terms of subtle and not dominant or aggressive spice notes. sour fruit up front, sweet finish, daring but approachable at the same time. body is thin, too thin really. it lends to drinkability, but it makes it less of a winter warmer in the classic sense. its carbonated fine, but its just a tad too little on body for me, especially given how alcoholic this is. better and better as it warms. overall an exceptional holiday brew, a must try at the taproom."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a lot of spicy xmas nature here. Sweet and festive and blends rather nicely together. It is what it is a xmas beer, limit of one is fine."

"Nice beer. Reminds me of Christmas, so it's quite fitting."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a hazy, copper/bronze color with a good amount of rising carbonation and a tan head. The retention was good and the lacing in bands all the way down my glass. The aroma was of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel malt and some light citrus notes. The flavors were very enjoyable to me. I tasted all the aforementioned spices built atop a solid caramel malt backbone with only light hopping which gave it a nice finish. Balanced and not overly spiced as many holiday ales tend to be. Additionally, there was almost no sign that the beer was 8% ALC and I didn’t realize it until after I’d enjoyed a few! The mouthfeel was good, the body surprisingly light and the carbonation appropriate."
""
""
""
"O: Drinks like a lesser version of Great Lakes Christmas Ale. It's a spice bomb without a lot of complexity or character. Goes down easy like Sunday morning and is almost as forgettable as that one girl you hooked up with in college after 20 games of beer pong. It's certainly not bad, though, and holds its own with most of the entries in the ""let's drink clove and call it a Christmas Ale"" category."
""
"Overall:	One of my favorite holiday beers. Very thick and warm it feels like the holidays."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good beer. I loved the pumpkin ale, so why wouldn't I love this"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The time has improved this beer a bit. The lack of alcohol is a good thing. The spices have faded a bit, but still smooth and good."
"O: A surprisingly good beer that avoids being overly spiced. It definitely tastes like fall and winter in a bottle. It's not extremely complex, but still enjoyable."
"Overall, I just don't like the sweetness overload on top of the high alcohol content. Plus, the spices are in overdrive, so this beer is just a bit too much, all the way around. This might be the last Schlafly beer I ever try."
""
""
"Overall, this wasn't particularly bad-tasting, but the aroma's meekness and body's lightness make this a bit off-putting as a high ABV winter beer."
"Overall a solid Christmas beer from Schlafly, love this brewery."
"D- Nice solid winter seasonal, flavors are balanced and appropriate."
"O - Pretty awesome smelling beer. Alcohol is a little heavy though."
""
""
"O: The alcohol is blended very well in this beer, but it loses points in a few areas. For a winter seasonal, this beer is a bit too light. It is also on the sweeter side. While the hops are there, the sweetness of the orange combines with the malt to create a beer that can be a bit of a toothache. The warming alcohol at the end does help, but the beer almost reminds me of sweet and sour sauce. This beer screams of fruitcake (which is not the best association)."
"I'm not sure that I would drink it other than as a seasonal, or with special events, but I'm really impressed and I think that it would make a great after-dinner beer, or even an apertif. Quite nice!"
""
"Although the flavor is not off the charts, nothing offends and it is actually very drinkable. For the high abv, there is no real notice of alcohol. I will enjoy this as a dessert beer during the holidays and think it will be a good fit in that role."
"The sweetness of the beer is immediately a bit cloying, but as it sits in your mouth you're able to begin to dissect the different flavors. Nice beer to try during the holidays, but anything beyond a 12 oz. snifter is probably more than enough."
"Trying the Schlafly Christmas Ale this evening and the beer pours a mostly clear amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Lacing and head retention are both decent. The scent is very sweet and spicy, I can smell cloves, cinnamon, orange peel, and some ginger. It tastes pretty much the same as it smells, but the clove flavor is the strongest. Also, I think it tastes more spicy than sweet. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated. Overall, it can be a tough beer due to the amount of spice in this beer, I don't think I could drink more than 2 or 3 of these at a time."
""
""
"Mouth feel is not very carbonated. This isn't an in your face beer. It reminds me of some barley wines without the strong hops. Easy to drink with hidden alcohol; nothing remarkable though."
""
""
"A drinkable holiday brew, but nothing exceptional."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a sweet, spicy, and warming winter beer. Not exceptional but definitely above average."
""
"Pretty good but not the best of the winters/holiday treats that are available."
"Overall- A beer that does not start out very promising by the way it looks and smells, but it really kicks it into gear on the palate and with the mouth feel. The best holiday ale I have had yet!"
"Poured from a bottle, crystal clear and deep copper color. Smells like a nice Christmas ale, cloves and other spices. Tastes like a bad beer gone sour and tried to mask the flavor with spices. Not a fan of this one. Has a slick body to it and tastes sour at the end of the taste. Not sure if it was a bad bottle or what."
"Overall Impression- Not an easy one to drink! I would say you could have your 12 ounces of this and then can call it a night. More of a Night Cap. Go for it if available but only buy a 6-pack of this if your with 5 other guys. Not one to be enjoyed one after the other. You'll see what I mean!"
"I wouldn't call it a total loss, but the richness I expected for a big winter ale wasn't there. Schalfly let the additional ingredients do too much of the work."
""
"The taste reminds me of a Czech herbal lliquor, Becherovka. Herbs, a touch of liquourice, malts, a little sweet fruitiness in the aftertaste. There's a lot going on, and it's interesting, but not something I love. And as I drink the beer, I like it less and less."
""
""
""
""
"I dig this. But I think it worth mentioning again...this really reminds me of their pumpkin ale. Good beer. Drink it!"
""
""
""
"the aroma is a very big blend, a kitchen since, or spice rack if you will as i am picking up copious notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, ample apple notes, brown sugar and touches of light citrus. at first you would not think this would work, but hell yeah it does. as i take the first sip I am struck by how well this is working for me. really nicely put together with light body that is crisp, clean and does wonders for keeping the large amount of flavor in check. starts with a healthy dose of citrus like flavors that roll into a spiced brown sugar and ends with a nutmeg and cinnamon led charge of nice spiced, holiday like flavor."
"Overall: I really was underwhelmed by this one, sadly enough. I had high expectations, but it seems to succumb to the lowest common denominator again. If I find it on tap again, I might try it again. But there are so many other fall ales that they have leftover by the time its around that it will probably get washed over by the fall leftovers and the spring releases. Give it a shot though if you find it. Not anything to rearrange your life over."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a cloudy amber color. There was a big frothy head on it that took a little while to recede. Leaves a little lacing. Nice aroma. A little lighter, but definitely Christmas: clove, cinnamon and nutmeg. Maybe a hint of orange. Taste if pretty good. Malt, clove, cinnamon, a touch of orange and pine. This is actually just a touch bitter, with just a hint of sweetness to start. Lots of hops to balance the malts. A decent winter beer."
"The palate opens with a mild medicinal sweetness along with a blend of spices and herbs. Again, this really is like potpourri, with a melange of flavors present. Pine and citrus from the hops, an herbal character that I can't entirely describe, and a blend of spices with clove, cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Orange peel isn't as noticeable here, for some reason.There's a bitterness present that reminds me of grains of paradise for some reason. The alcohol is rather noticeable, even when cold, making this harsher than it needs to be. The booze also makes this more noticeably medicinal, which isn't entirely appealing. Medium in body with a high level of carbonation that is surprisingly creamy, this feels decent on the palate. Mildly bitter and mildly herbal on the finish, this is decent. Ultimately, not terribly enjoyable, but I don't regret buying a single."
"M/D: Light bodied with good carbonation and quite smooth. A pretty good beer, but had high hopes after trying their pumpkin beer in the fall, which was amazing."
"D- A nice spiced winter seasonal beer. The flavors were well balanced but the aroma at times seemed to be a little muted. The ABV is present toward the ending of the beer but only for a second or two. Would love to try this stuff again....I think a little fresher bottle will do this beer a little more justice."
"Schlafly's Christmas Ale is one the best holiday brews I've encountered. Like their Pumpkin Ale, they really know how to walk the fine between too little and too much. This is so well balanced, and it makes for supremely enjoyable drinking. Like Christmas itself, I'll be looking forward to this one all year."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark golden amber. Head was a very thin off white that didn't last at all, in fact never really formed. Aroma was a tad sweet, but also spicy. Cloves and a hint of citrus as well. Taste was fruity, with some bubblegum as well. Hint of hops. Felt ok in the mouth, coated well, but perhaps a bit over carbonated. A different take on a winter seasonal that was a very solid sipper."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug (I also had it on tap once in a bar in DC). Pours a hazy orange with a thin-moderate linen white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left partial lace. Pleasant aroma of orange peel, honey, and cloves - subdued holiay spcies. Decent carbonation. The flavor is mild malt with stronger orange peel, honey and cloves. Black pepper emerges in the aftertaste about five seconds after the swallow and lingers for several seconds."
"Decent drinkability. What with the sweet spiciness and the alcohol, it kind of reminded me of a Belgian."
"Drinkability: A nice and malty holiday treat where the alcohol really sneaks up. The combination of spices is good. A sipper that is one I will revisit."
"This is a solid winter seasonal. Seems to warm with each sip. Plenty of complex and interesting flavors that blend well together. One of the best brews yet from Schlafly's."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a clear medium copper amber color with a slight off white 1 finger head. The aroma is a a muted, subtle citrus and spice of cinnamon. The taste is a lot more flavorful than the nose with a sweet gingerbread like start along with sweet citrus. Fairly malty. Medium mouthfeel. Ends with a slight bitterness. Overall, this is a decent drinking beer. The booze is only slightly noticeable."
"Ok beer spices are a bit much, they really clash with the malt. Kind of messy."
"Pretty good beer that I think a lot of folks would enjoy, but not something that I would typically seek out."
"Medium describes the body and carbonation...very smooth mouth feel and it's a pretty easy drinker. Nicely done."
"D: I probably won't have more than one in a setting. I think it loses its effect after one, but definitely worth a try"
"Starts off spritzy and malty. It transitions into white peppery spice. The aftertaste is very dry and the alcohol warms the throat. Relatively thin body but this may be from the high carbonation."
"Very solid brew, with great carbonation. It's well made and simple, yet some nice flavors hidden if you dig deep enough. A perfect Christmas brew to have with a nice turkey dinner. Enough alcohol to get you a warm buzz, but not a sipper either. Could easily drink a sixer of this, which would be dangerous, given the 8 ABV."
"D: Not my favorite of this style but a nice one to try. glad i did not buy a six pack"
"Overall/notes - The word dependable is appropriate. I've never had a brew from this company that floored me, but I've also never had one that disappointed. This fits just in that mold, and once again, I have a another variety of beer to enjoy. Worth tasting, but I recommend letting it warm a bit if you don't have a true beer fridge or cellar (like me)."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a basic tumbler glass. Aroma is primarily orange and clove - not surprising considered those spices are used in the brewing of the beer. First taste yields a surprising amount of bitterness followed by a hefty and clear amount of alcohol warmth. Heavy handed carbonation keeps things from getting overpowered. Graham cracker sweetness starts up front, giving way to a cinnamon bitterness. Reminds me of their Pumpkin Ale, though with a slightly different spicing regimin. If I had to choose between the two I'd go with the Pumpkin, though this certainly isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. The high alcohol and heavy spicing make this one a bit tougher to drink however."
"d - A pretty decent spiced beer, I enjoyed the taste a little more than the smell. Would be willing to try again."
"Verdict: Really excellent and wonderful beer. Worth tracking down."
"Beer is light in body and sweet at the lead off and finishes with a light cinnamon flavor in the background. It's nice, not a great beer in my opinion but a drinkable one. The spices aren't terrible, its just an average beer."
"The taste is a bit more pungent and the mild spices are fairly tame and well-distributed. At the same time, the beer is completely one dimensional and I'm not sure I'm enjoying that dimension all that much. Light cinnamon and some ginger are what I pick up as well as a bit of light malt. The spicing is nice on the medium body. This is a fairly-drinkable winter brew, but it's not all that special in the end."
"Mouth feel wise there is plenty of carbonation to make this lively, and the warming feeling in the end is faint for the ABV content, which is a plus for me."
"Spicy, but hard to place a finger on what spice they might have used."
"D - Although this is April this is still drinkable. However, it really hits the spot on those cold winter nights as the 8% can warm you up a little."
"D: I could have maybe two at a time. This is a very good beer, but due to the ""Holiday"" flavors, I wouldn't put down 4 or 5. Worth the money for sure."
"I've had better examples of this style but I wouldn't hesitate to drink this again next year, maybe a little fresher or on tap?"
"M/D - Another great brew from Schlafly. Smooth medium bodied brew that carried the right amounts of citrus and sweet blended well with spices but over done. A little hop bite at the end but doesn't ruin the experience. A great seasonal from Schlafly that comes highly recommended"
"The spice and sweet malty character of this beer hide the fact its 8% ABV. I had to consciously pace myself when drinking this six pack as the inviting aromas and solid flavor keep you comin back for more."
"Schlafly rarely makes beer that wows me and, while Christmas Ale doesn't wow me, it's better than a good many Schlafly offerings I've enjoyed. This is a solid, rather enjoyable Christmas Ale that should please, and deserves a spot in many a fridge over the Holidays."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 11/12/2009. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Lacing and head retention are both decent. Aroma is very sweet and spicy, I can smell cloves, cinnamon, orange peel, and some ginger. It tastes pretty much the same as it smells, but the clove flavor is the strongest. Also, I think it tastes more spicy than sweet. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, the alcohol in this brew is well hidden. However due to the amount of spice in this beer, I don't think I could drink more than 2 or 3 of these at a time. With that being said, I think this is a good overall brew, and I'll have to pick some more up next year."
"drinkability - for a beer @ 8%abv i sure drank it fast"
"Drinkability: I give it a 3 because it's not awful, but I would certainly never seek it out - doesn't really compete with the likes of a Bell's Christmas Ale or the Hoppin' Frog Frosted Frog."
"-Bye"
"Drinkability: This beer is meant to be enjoyed during the holidays, and I have no problem with that whatsoever. Although slightly overpowering, and for that reason I like to mix it up with other styles. This also helps with the ABV level of this beer, which, if you're not careful, can take you by surprise."
"Not the most unique beer in this general style, nor the most flavorful, but I am favorably impressed."
"I haven't had a beer I liked less than this in a while and I could easily pour it down the drain but i'll finish it. If you're looking for a strong beer without much flavor and a thin body, this might be for you."
"All in all, a pretty darn good beer."
"D: This is a tasty little beer, it's one that you could have one or two, but not sessionable."
"A nice beer here, says it's brewed with orange peel and cloves. Beautiful color, nice head on it too. Clove definitely comes through in the nose, along with some cinnamon, ginger, and something slightly metallic that's off-putting. The taste follows almost exactly, big gingerbread, clove, and spiced notes. Metallic taste returns, though. MF is medium bodied, not bad, coating. A decent winter beer to enjoy and warm up with."
"Overall: 25% through this one I'm not overly impressed. It seems just a bit too cloying for 8.0% ABV."
"Schlafly doesn't disappoint with its Christmas Ale. Probably the most fruity of all the Christmas Ales I have had, this is one almost anybody could enjoy."
"A sipper, for sure... This would be terrific with some gingerbread or fruitcake...a nice seasonal effort from Schlafly..."
"Pours a clear, amber/red color. Oddly, no head. Smells of strong spice, yeast, slight citrus, and some herbs. Fits the style of a Herbed / Spice Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of spice, herb, slight citrus, and slight yeast. Overall, drinkeable, but a little lacking in body."
"D - Moderate to low drinkability in my mind - the abv on this beer would sneak up on you big time. The spicy edge makes it a nice after dinner drink. Somewhat filling."
"Pours a very nice hazy amber color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with lots of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some cinimmon, nutmeg. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, with nice touch of spices. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, Thanks Tim."
"M/D - Nice tasting brew for the holidays, but a bit too sweet or clovey for my tastes."
"Very spicy. Hints of cinnamon, clove, and maybe some allspice. Mouthfeel was average (or above average for a Schlafley) as was the drinkability. Maybe if it had been a little warmer in more of a snifter or tulip style glass, I might have enjoyed it more."
"This beer poured a nice reddish brown with a fluffy 3 inch white head that left some seriously sticky white lacing. The aroma is really spicy. Clove, nutmeg, a hint of cinnamon, a just a bit of orange zest are apparent in the aroma. The flavor follows suit with what seems like my wife's hole spice cabinet thrown in. Clove and nutmeg are definitely the most prevalent flavors with orange zest, date and a bit of vanilla. The mouthfeel is quite a bit creamier then what I expected. Absolutely fabulous. This is a good beer, and I'm proud to call Schlafly a ""local"" brewery."
"mouth is thick, oily and very candy-like. medium carbonation and easily drinkable. Way to go Schlafly!"
"The lacing follows the beer with each sip. This is my 4th or 5th Schlafly's and I'm still waiting for one that's not exceptional. This may be the best beer I've ever had. It's potent at 8% alcohol, but it's terribly smooth so it's highly drinkable. It's a shame it's a seasonal brew."
"Conclusion: Not a bad winter beer, and I like the balance between malt sweetness and hops (a lot of spiced beers seem to have little to no real hop presence) but at the end of the day the spices are just a little overwhelming for this to be truly great."
"Drinks easy, nice mix of flavors here"
"Cheers & Merry Christmas!"
"My favorite Christmas/Winter Ale so far this year and lucky me that it's readily available everywhere I go. I am a newer person to the craft beer population, but Schlafly still has not disappointed me and this one raised the bar for the next."
"Drinkability is high for a beer clocking in at 8%. I might have to pick up some more of this in anticipation of the ensuing holidays. I really didn't like Schlafly's Pumpkin Spice offering, but their Christmas Ale is the shit."
"D: Not bad, a nice take on the xmas offering."
"D - I'd drink it a ton if it weren't for the price tag. I paid 10.50 for a sixer but it does appear to be worth it. This is exactly what I want in a holiday ale."
"On the evenings following this review, I also got a nice sappy piney hop presence (subtle), and a biscuity malt note."
"Thanks Pmcadamis and Happy holidays!"
"D - A good sipper for a cold holiday season night. It's 33 degrees and wet here in central Illinois... the perfect time for a spicy and boozy winter ale. This one is pretty good, but not as glorious as I expected from a ""special release"" beer from Schlalfly. I do like the SN Celebration - like take on a winter brew."
"Now to pick up some 2008."
"Bottle from Party Source. This beer is a hazy amber color with a medium thin light beige head. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus peel, coriander and sweet cookies. Light-bodied with a sweet spiced character. Flavors of clove, caramel malt and mild hops. The finish is citrusy with a lingering sweet spice aftertaste. Slightly above average overall."
"D- Probably my favorite holiday offering. Sadly I'll have to wait until near next december for more of these. Very delicious and very affordable. Not an every day refreshing drinker(not spiced for that), but I'd enjoy it fairly often."
"this is a great seasonal beer that i wish i could get on the regular."
"D: Excellent beer. I think I'll be looking for this one again next holiday season."
"Shlafly's special offerings usually fare well, but it's the standard beers that sometimes fall short. The experience with this beer leads to a wonderful, light, spicy flavor, but with a lesser body. Opens with a bright copper / orange hue with great clarity, initial head formation that lacked staying power. Spicy aromas of curraco, clove, and giner dominate the modest malt profile. Flavors bring more than just a hint of these spices, but allowing a smooth caramel malt flavor to balance and smoothen. Somewhat dry and thin in the textures, leading to a crisp, grahm-cracker finish. Very nice, drinkable beer, but a more round body would have helped."
"D - amazingly approachable for 8%. You'll probably guess a theme, touch too much clove for me."
"Candied sugared malt backbone is supported with a bold spiciness that is not overdone. Again orange peel being the most prominate. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. This beer is a sipper and I'm suprised to look up and see that it's 8% abv as I don't detect any alcohol."
"D: very good beer, one of the better holiday offerings I have tried"
"Pours a cloudy red color with a nice white head. The aroma is has a bunch of malt and cloves. The flavor has a bunch of clove in it and a touch of bitter orange. The malt presence is strong but the spices overpower somewhat. The body is nice but I'm still not crazy about this beer."
"This is a very drinkable Christmas beer. Understated spices, a nice orange flavor, and enough bitterness to make it very palatable."
"d: Maybe I'm just in the holiday spirit, but this is one of the best winter warmers/holiday beers I've had this season. It isn't too sweet or spiced and allows hops to shine through. I could just be a homer, but this and boulevard's nutcracker ale have really hit the spot this winter."
"Pours a somewhat murky rich amber hue with a pillowy one finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a frothy layer of bubbles. Stickiness is decent, bits of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is of candy cane, nutmeg, cinnamon, and gingerbread. Good variety of smells, but they seem a bit artificial. Malty caramel malts in the nose as well. Flavor is of fresh spices and clove with a pumkin like taste. What I do enjoy about the flavor is that it's not over-aggressive like many spiced beers are. Subtle hop and malt balance, but they're a bit hidden. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a powerful carbonation. I was hoping this one would be a bit smoother in the mouth. I didn't even check the abv until about half way through the tasting and I was shocked to see the 8%. bort11 gave me two of these, one to try now and one to cellar. Let's see what this one is like in about year. Thanks again Tim."
"Pours a gorgous and lively amber red color and produces a nice, bubbly off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. The beer is just slightly hazy, but very rich in color. This beer just looks good. Spotty lacing is left inside the large snifter I'm using for this beer. The nose is the Holidays in a glass. Strong aromas of holiday spices (cloves, cinnamon and citrus). Behind the spicy notes is a very pleasant roasted malt character. Smells festive in every way. The palate doesn't disappoint either - spices up front, intermixed with aggressive floral hops and dominant citrus notes (bitter orange peel, mostly). Due to the liberal use of hops in this beer, you get an over all dry taste with a lot going on in the back of the mouth. The finish is very herbal and citric, without being medicinal or cloying at all. Beautifully crafted. The mouth feel is medium and very fluid. The 8% ABV is well-masked in my opinion, but opens up a bit as the beer warms. I believe this to be one of my very favorite Christmas beers. It's very well balanced, incredibly tasty te. This is a nicely balanced spiced Christmas beer that is quite enjoyable. It's the type of beer I'd hit up for a and a nice departure from the typical winter warmer. For me, the citrus and bold hop presence makes this beer. These characteristics could well be why some won't like this beer, but it's what makes it stand out of the crown for me. Absolutely excellent and one of my favorite beers from Schlafly this year ... and that's saying a lot."
"D - This was a really good beer. It is probably the best herbed/spiced brew that I've ever had."
"Drinkability - a great seasonal ale. Good fireside brew, let it warm up a little to let the flavors shine."
"Thanks Hopsaplenty."
"Drinkability is for me not great but its not a bad brew just not something I could see myself drinking lots of. No notice of the 8% at all, very well hidden. Want to thank merlin48 for sending this one my way."
"I am a winter/spiced beer fan to an extent. This one is pretty good and I would drink a few if available locally."
"i was saving this for a special occasion...and i think i found one as this evening my wife and i went for a six mile walk in -15 below temperatures on the coldest day of the winter thus far here in northern minnesota and witnessed Comet McNaught. just because we could. gotta love rural living."
"Clear, burnished amber. Short persistent head of loose, small tan bubbles punctuated by steady columns of carbonation. The head falls to a thin skim leaving a few spots of foam. Sweet orange and spicy clove aromas are brushed with the smallest hint of spicy hops. Orange peel, more fleshy than rind meshes with a strong clove presence that finishes with more cloves lingering a long while. There is a modest amount of toasty malt, but it is dominated by cloves and orange. Medium body that feels thin at times, the carbonation is fine bubbles. Relatively singular in its spice focus, I would have enjoyed a wider flavor range and a slightly bulked up body."
"Dark, bright amber with a thin sheet of white lacing that combs the pint glass. Streaky, thunderstorm lacing. Sweet piney hops, freshly baked apple pie, cloves, gingerbread and nutmeg are all in the aroma, sets up for a great first impression. Spicy malts, massive cloves and nutmeg that turn creamy. Full bodied; pumpkin and apple pie crust with orange peel and caramel roll noted. Large winter spices, cloves, gingerbread cookies, and spicy cinammon come to fruition. Talk about a full flavored spiced up beer; props to Schlafly for marketing this as a winter ale, one to look forward to each year!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" beige head over the slightly cloudy dark amber brew. Thick head lasts nicely, with lasting lace. Aroma is a light popourri, ample spicing, but not over the top. Taste is just what the label indicates, a zesty citrus cut with clove. Again, moderate amounts here, not falling for the overdo that many spiced beers do. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with relative easy drinkability. Not the world's biggest spiced beer fan, but this one pulls it off rather well."
"Pretty interesting interpretation of a winter warmer, I like the spiciness and the clean bite added by the hops. Good brew, Schlafly."
"For folks who have criticized this beer for having a lot of spice, that is like criticizing an IPA for having a lot of hops."
"Thanks to JPM30 & Vancer for this festive Holiday brew. Prosit MK"
"It was not too good; I didn't think it was as bad as some others (aforbes) did, but the taste pretty much kills this beer. It pours a deep clear red brown, looks ok so far. Smells like christmas. Piney, nutmeg, cloves. Not bad. The taste is overload of ginger, nutmeg, cloves, orange, pine... pretty much tastes like a christmas air freshener in beer form. On the plus side, the alcohol is very well hidden (errr... covered-up?). Mouthfeel is ok, a bit dry. Drinkability is hurt by the taste. But I bet if you simmered this stuff on the stove it would make your house smell really good."
"I've been to Schlafly's, I know they make good beer. I also know that this is not one of the one's that i like. Yeah, i know its a Christmas ale, and i know that some people like to put some spices in their Christmas drinks, but come on guys....this was just they dumped in a bunch of cloves and nutmeg and orange rind and figured that if you could taste all of that crap in the beer it would make it a good beer. I've all for those flavors in beer, now, dont get me wrong; but to the extent that they were all right up there hitting me in the tongue? and it was so muddled and unbalanced. Its the worst tasting spiced beer i've had since that Buffalo Bill's Pumpkin from 2 yeaers ago. way too many spices and it was a bit thin too. looked ok, and actually smelled fine, but yeah, downhill from there."
"A very well done winter warmer. Tasty and interesting but with all the spices I doubt I could finish more than one at a sitting."
"It would be nice after shovling snow or just for holiday enjoyment. Medium/full bodied, nice mouthfeel and drinkable, but better for sipping. A little heavy on spices for pairing with most food but should be nice after dinner."
"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass, after a long day of eating turkey. Not a lot of head, leaves a very thin film of lace around the edges. Color is a warm orange-brown, hazy through the center with mild carbonation. Smell is of cloves, very strong and slightly bitter. Taste has a slightly bitter hardwood flavor with various spices mingling around the edges. More of the cloves, a bit of nutmeg. Finishes with some hop notes. Even though it is 8%, it doesn't feel as ""warm"" as some other winter warmers that are lower in ABV. It is an interesting beer, and one I will enjoy this holiday season. I think this one is better suited for after dinner rather witht he meal."
"Thanks Ric."
"D - Because of the huge spice note and the little odds and ends that I had trouble appreciating, I would put my personal limit at two with this brew."
"It does hop bite just a tad too strong, a couple more malt seeds would have worked wonders. Oh well, it may be 8%, but I could drink these all evening long, although slowly."
"Hats off to Steve Hale and the rest of the Schlafly brewers."
"Overall, I found this to be surprisingly good. Easy to drink, with nice ""holiday"" spiciness that is balanced by the sweetness of the malt. I could drink many of these, I'm sure. Nicely done!"
