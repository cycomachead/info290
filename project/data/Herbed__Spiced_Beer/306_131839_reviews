"Apple pie in a glass. Very refreshing. Nice surprise."

"Was prepared for this to be awful but actually had a pretty decent taste."
"Serving type: bottle."
""
"Poured onto pint glass. Looks great! Golden honey color with decent head. Smells slightly sweet and defiantly cinnamon, and spiraling downwards from here.  It taste like a blue moon that's been open in the fridge for days, but still has a strange cola type carbonation. This is easily the worst of the beers in the spring sampler. I'm gonna give the other one to a local homeless and i am pretty  sure I ll be lucky if he doesn't break out my car windows for it."
"Didn't have high hopes for this, but turned out a bit better than I expected. An interesting Mexican twist on Blue Moon. Try it if you're a horchata fan for the smell alone."
""
""
"From the bottle in a pint glass, this ale pours a lightly hazy yellow with a firm white head that dissipates to a thick ring and light lacing.  Nose of cinnamon (duh) and light caramel malts.  Flavors follow the nose with cinnamon and caramel malts, a serious cinnamon spiciness to the rear blending with a small dose of grassy hops, and even more cinnamon.  Crisp and lightly dry mouth feel, highly carbonated.  While I may not be a fan of this one it is good for what it is."
"Really good taste by blue moon. Nice cinnamon horchata taste without being over the top"
""
"O - It's exactly what Blue Moon intended it to be.  Not my favorite style by any means, but an enjoyable brew nonetheless."
""
""
"Smelled just like cinnamon and tasted excellent!"
""
""
"Sweet and tasty. Probably more for dessert"
"Prefer IPA, but this beer does taste good"
""
""
"At first glance looked like a decent beer. It smelled pretty good, can definitely tell there is cinnamon. That's all I can say is good about this. Personally the cinnamon was overpowering and I was not digging the rice. I tried drinking as much as I could hoping it would get better, but in the end it was a sink poor for me."
"I twisted off the cap and gave it an aggro pour until the foaming action was too much to handle. Backing off, I watched as it formed two fluffy fingers of snow white head with good retention. Color was a slightly hazy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5 ), but the purity was too flawed for my gold-digging buddies, Midas, Croesus and Mammon to want to show up. Nose smelled like rice pudding with cinnamon atop! I have not had MexiCAN horchata in many years, but this was really evocative of it. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. Taste was rice pudding with cinnamon, but not as pronounced as on the nose. That said, as it warmed, it really began to live up to its billing! This was such a pleasant counterbalance to the previous beers this afternoon that I was ecstatic that I had saved it until now. Finish was semi-sweet, but nowhere near as cloying as it could/might have been. I must get #TheOldLady to try some and give me her opinion."
"So this beer is like eating a churro.  Very smooth and the cinnamon is not over powering as I expected.  Body hits heavy but finishes light...whatever that means.  Not what I expected from Coors/Blue Moon but I like this one.  Would seek out if it ever made it to sixers."

"What a interesting idea that totally did not work out. Glad I only got 1 in a pick 6."

"Imagining horchata as a beer is difficult and set the beer up to be either disgusting or surprisingly good.  For me, this fell on the good side. Drank from a bottle.  It had an almost overwhelming and surprisingly pleasant cinnamon smell. It actually got the core taste of horchata without being undrinkable due to sweetness.  Very smooth and easy to drink. Light carbonation and a very light tongue feel.  The traditional wheat taste was not strong, but enough to balance the sweetness.  As a desert beer, it is pretty good.  I got it out of curiosity and had low expectations for it.  Even though I expected it to be a cavity ""beer", it fulfilled the titular taste without being too sweet."
"A b c de f"
"This would be a very interesting beer if it were done properly. I think it actually accomplishes some of what it sets out to doâ€”the cinnamon pops on the nose, and it does taste like horchata. As it stands, the thin, watery body and almost complete lack of carbonation knock this beer from good to at best mediocre for me."
""
"I don't typically like wheat beer but this is delicious. The smell is deceiving. It tastes a lot better than it smells. It sort of smells like michelada. The taste of the horchata hits you first then the wheat. Overall, pretty good."
""
""
"Bottle poured into pint glass"
"Easy to drink, hard to find, got everyone I know hooked."
""
"Have to remind yourself it's a spice beer and not regular Blue Moon"
"I'm always skeptical of beer that tastes like anything other than... beer. It's why I'm not a fan of fruit beers (like Pyramid's Apricot Ale). So I was kinda iffy about this brew, but, rest assured, while the cinnamon flavor absolutely stands out, this still succeeds in tasting like beer; a good, malty beer flavor with the sweetness of bananas and honey. The flavor is balanced, succeeding in incorporating the spices into a cohesive blend. It has a good, golden color to it. It is a little cloudy. The aroma is slight, with a predictable cinnamon and malt scent. Very little hops present in the flavor, which is fine by me. There was also very little head that went away after less than a minute in my glass. A special beer for occasional drinking, but impressive."

"the new beer advocate requirements blow~! untappd way better!"
"This one surprised me. It poars a hazy golden yellow with minimal head and no lacing. The aroma is thay of straight cinnamon sticks. Flavor is strong cinnamon sugar up front, followed by Belgian yeasts, with a clean grain and (once again) cinnamony finish. Mouthfeel and carbonation is strong but pleasant. This is my first venture into spiced beer, so maybe I am biased. However it was undoubtedly my favorite beer in the Spring 2015 Blue Moon Brewmaster's pack."
""
"Love the cinnamon flavor  crisp flavor and clean finish"
"I wasnt looking forward to drinking  this.  A dessert beer definately.  Sweet, it does taste like cinnamon horchata and i rather liked it. I would buy it if i ever saw it in a 6 pack. Cinnamon and sugar is what this tasted like. A slight artificial flavor  is present as well."
""
""
"This is the only ""beer"" I have not finished a 12oz bottle of. Taste is okay for the first few sips, but just too sweet to be considered a beer."
"I tried this first at a Halloween party. Scary!"
""
""
"Not as bad as I thought it would be"
""
""
""
"I don't know about that taste... It's a bit of an assault on the taste buds"
"Yum ! Not as good as the gingerbread but very good!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting, I dislike spiced beer, but this is good, definitely sweet but very interesting."
""
""
""
""
""

"This stuff is straight up gross. It is HORRIBLE. Poured the rest of the bottle after 3 short sips. Horchata I love. Blue Moon I like. Put em together? NO. I'm not kidding, it made me gag."
""
""
"This is pretty cinnamon-y.   Can't taste any beer in here."
"pretty damn good for a mass produced spiced beer"

"Really nice taste.  Not too strong with the spices but, just enough to add interest to the beer."

"The aroma is a startling like cinnamon and Blue Moon or maybe it's not startling at all. The flavor is heavy on the cinnamon with a light wheat, lemon and coriander. It's a little spicy with a tinge of dry heat but the cinnamon is more like a candy topping. This seems like an attempt at a Churro in a bottle but it fails in its backbone though it's still mildly tasty."

"i will be the first to admit that i dont hate this at all. its like a mulled cider or something, i get cinnamon but very little or no chili, which i am totally fine with, and then a real strange apple sweetness that i cant quite place. honey and cinnamon in the nose, i would call it wintery, but the beer is so light in color and body that it really struggles to work in that context. definitely unique though, with its use of cinnamon in a beer this pale. i find it rather drinkable because of the absence of the pepper, and because carbonation is way up. the sweetness hurts it for me, but i think it probably makes it more salable to the masses. more like spiced apple cider than beer, but i still kind of like it, and it certainly doesnt have any weird off flavors, but this whole blue moon, shock top, flavored beer thing is getting carried away is it not?"

"Blue Moon Cinnamon Horchata brewed by Coors Brewing Company, with an ABV of 5.50%  This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. Cinnamon Horchata is a unfiltered brew, this brew has cloudy tent to it.  The smell is rich with cinnamon and sweetness.  You also pick up a hit of gains in the smell of this brew. Now for the taste, it is rich with cinnamon and spices.  This brew taste like apple pie, not saying that is a bad thing.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it. The mouthfeel is great with spices and smoothness.  Coors Brewing Company did a nice job with brew. I would buy this brew again. Overall I',m giving this brew a 4.5 out of 5."

"Not usually a Blue Moon fan but what makes this one different is the mouth (body) of the brew. It is much fuller than the typical Blue Moon brew. While not a world shaker it is a step forward."
""
"Overall: Great beer. Pleasantly surprised that I actually liked a Blue Moon/Coors beer. Tried regular Blue Moon, didn't like it. This on the other hand, is cinnamon gold. Highly recommended and really hope this becomes a permanent flavor."
""

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass."
"It's basically Blue Moon with cinnamon. Congrats, Miller-Coors!"

"Overall, a really good beer.  All of Blue Moons beers have a similar taste of the classic Blue Moon Belgian White with a variant of whatever style they are playing it of as but this was pretty good and I am glad I tried it."

"Pours a slight hazy golden-yellow in color with a thin white cap. Some light spotty lacing is seen but not much. A bit of sediment is seen at the bottom of the bottle. The aroma is really nice and consists of cinnamon and some spices. Even more going on with the taste as there is the cinnamon BUT isn't over done at all along with a hint of almonds and some other flavors that are hard to pick out. Almost like a hint of 'Rum Chata' in with the malts. Very smooth and goes down easy (and fast). Lighter+ bodied and perfect carbonation. Great brew for the cooler months and was very surprised on how good this one really is! Great job!"

"It smells of cinnamon, but it's not overdone. It's a slight hint nutty as well, but I'm not sure if that's from rice or not. It's welcoming! The flavor reveals more cinnamon, and I think, rice flavor as there's definitely something different from a standard maltiness going on. As the label states, it's subtly sweet, but it remains in balance due to the spiciness of the cinnamon. I'm not sure what the bitterness level is, but it's very low; and there are no hop flavors, although that's to be expected. So what is the yeast giving us? I'm not really sure, all I'm finding is 'maltiness' and cinnamon. Of course, maybe that's all that's really needed; as this is a new style of beer I have to judge it hedonistically anyway, and I'l say I really like it... 4 1/2 out of 5 stars! And what I find so impressive is that the cinnamon doesn't really build on you. It does a little bit, of course, but not nearly as much as say, a pumpkin ale. I think I'm going to try to find a case or two of this. It should make an interesting addition to holiday meals, an easy-going relaxed fall beer, and even a great BBQ beer in the summer. Beyond that I think the food pairings are almost limitless as it gives a little bit of spice and sweetness but it's not overdone. One of the best new beers I've tried in a long time, and certainly the most unique. Kudos!"

"Surprisingly very good. Literally tastes like horchata or if you never had that before, Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Somehow Blue Moon got it right by making it taste so smooth. Also interesting to note that the ale is light in color. Pretty much beer version of Rumchata."
"Wow! I'm gonna get straight to the point....this brew is fantastic! Great cinnamon flavor  and like others have said, smooth all the way through. Still surprised its made by Coors. Great beer for after dinner or in front of a fire on a cold winters night. Highly recommended!"

"I can't believe this is a large-brewer product, but it really delivered a unique horchata flavor that fit well with a beer.  Liked it a lot as part of a mix-case with lots of other wheaty beers."

"This is an easy drinking beer with some interesting flavors.  Sometime I'll have to figure out what a horchata tastes like...Purchased as part of a Fall variety 12 pack."
"O: As much as I hate to admit it, this actually ins't bad. Very drinkable and surprisingly accurate."

"Overall - Well, if you could take Cinnamon Toast Crunch and convert it to beer form, this is about what you'd expect. It's not great by any stretch, but at least it's bold, and that's maybe all you could ask for in a Blue Moon brew. Having said that, I would dare anyone to try to get though more than 3 of these; the flavor is so rich that sour stomach seems inevitable. Hell, I'm only through half a 12oz bottle and already I'm seeking something to cut the relentless sweet/spice flavor. It's arguably the best beer in this year's fall variety 12 pack, but that's not saying much.  It too has flaws."

"It wasn't what i expected, but it tasted okay. I wouldn't buy a 6 pack of this because the taste is rather different."
"I got this beer in a Blue Moon variety pack and I must say I really enjoyed it. you can taste the cinnamon but its not overpowering, this beer would be best as a desert beer just for sitting around and sipping a couple, I actually prefer this over the Blue Moon pumpkin ale."
""
"Overall- A very interesting beer. When I taste it I can just imagine ricey cinnamon/coco drink stirring in a big pot. The first Horchata beer I have tried. I would Like to see what a smaller craft brewery could produce in the horchata category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The Verdict: Good beer. To be honest, this is the only reason I bought the sampler pack. I love a good horchata and my interest was piqued. Iâ€™m not disappointed. If Coors made more brews like this I may try them more often than once every year or two."

"Overall (3.17) : This isn't bad, but it isn't fantastic. I was surprised at the ""very good"" rating as I think it probably deserves an ""okay"" or ""good"" rating. This is nothing compared to other ""very good"" rated beers, it simply does not stack up. It's flavorful yes, but it is weird. And so far I am pretty disappointed in Blue Moon's seasonal offerings."
"Overall, this beer is not bad and has a lot of potential. The cinnamon flavor blends well with the biscuit-like qualities. The thin, watered down mouthfeel is where this offering falls short. The taste improves as the beer warms."
""
""
""
"So good...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dessert beer. Sweet but not to sweet. Definitely taste the ""horchata"" flavor but it does not come across as super-artificial unlike some other blue moon flavors. Smooth all the way through with a sweet aftertaste, no bite at all. Would get again."
""
"Overall this shit is good and I keep picking it up, christmas in my mouth! Not the greatest beer ever, but has this comfy back home feeling and flavor.  I dont really get the Horchata aspect, but more a warm subtle apple cinnamon feel. Try it!"

"Thankfully, Coors decided to make the cinnamon taste a more mild and fashionable one, rather than a blatant taste that would make one weary to drink after about four ounces had been sucked down. I almost wish they scrap Rounder and give this one its place as a permanent offering."
""
""
""
"Pleasantly surprised with this one. Given that it is made by Coors Brewing and most other Blue Moon beers have only been mediocre, I wasn't expecting a lot. This turned out to be a great beer though.  Definitely my favorite Blue Moon beer. It does have a decent amount of cinnamon flavor and aroma so if that's not your thing steer clear. Very refreshing and smooth. Great for fall nights around the fire. Highly recommended. It appears it is currently in a testing phase so I hope it passes muster with everyone else so I can continue to enjoy it. If you like pumpkin ales and other spiced beers you should definitely give this one a go."
""
""
"Flavor releases the cinnamon a bit more. It's like liquid Cinnamon Life cereal, a bit sweet, bready and spicy.  Not bad, but I cannot drink a whole bottle.  Unlike some cinnamon stouts/porters, this has really not much else going on"
