Draft pour into snifter. Pours dark brown/black, with a cola hue and very light carbonation present. Great presence of vanilla and toasted oak. The booziness only becomes more apparent when this one warms up, otherwise it is soda pop all the way.

5,13.1,,,,,,"I was in Chicago last week for some training for work.  Me and my co-workers stopped by Harry Caray's 7th Inning Stretch restaurant and I saw, ""Not Your Father's Root Beer"" on the menu and decided to give it a try.  I was glad I ordered a glass of it!  This brew is incredibly tasty.  The version I was served was the 10% ABV.  Like several of the other reviews have stated, you do not taste the alcohol at all.  The flavor is a delicious creamy/sweet root beer flavor.  The root beer flavor reminded me of a freshly poured A&W root beer  served at the root beer stand.  This is in contrast to say a flavor like a Barq's or MUG root beer.  The creaminess and hints of vanilla come through slightly at the finish.  I highly recommend trying this excellent beer if you get the chance.  Looking at the Small Town Brewery's website, it appears that it is only available in Illinois.  With me being in Ohio, I am hoping to find a local place that can order some for me.  Small Town Brewery really should consider a wider distribution than just within Illinois.  I am sure it would be a big success wherever it is sold.","D-12","Sep 10, 2014"

So, I will call it a growler for reviewing purposes. I poured it into a mug, as I thought a root beer should be served. It looks a lot like root beer. The head isn't quite as frothy as a root beer, but that is probably due to being pours into a bottle and shipped two states away. Basically, this looks and smells like a root beer. It smells exactly like it. As far as I can tell it tastes exactly like root beer. I am not a big root beer drinker, but the thought of a 10% abv root beer is appealing. The only thing that detracts, is that when it warms I get a little alcohol taste. As long as it is ice cold it is root beer all the way. It is not overly carbonated, but once again, that goes back to the pouring and shipping. Overall, it is fantastic. I wish I had some ice cream to make a float with it. Can you imagine a 10% ice cream float? I am definitely glad I got to try this. This stuff is scary as the drinkability and high abv make a highly potent combination.","buschbeer","Nov 15, 2013"

Can't wait to taste the stronger one. If you have the change to try it and you like rootbeer you won't be disapponited at all.","zaraspook","Jan 06, 2013"

4.47,1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A friend had a keg of this at his place so I tried a glass. Only had one because of how dangerously drinkable this stuff is. Wow! Smells like a root beer, but better, somehow. Taste is fresh root beer, maybe a little creamier, with some vanilla hints in there. No detectable alcohol whatsoever, which is what makes it so dangerous. This was definitely a hit at the party. Seek this out if you can. I will be looking to buy a 5 gal keg ASAP.","mychalg9","Dec 14, 2012"

4.52,2.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Finally putting down my thoughts on the 10% version of this ridiculousness. It pours a nearly opaque black-brown topped by a finger of light sandy tan foam. The nose comprises light molasses, mild wintergreen, cola, and even a bit of cocoa and maple syrup. Frankly, it smells like root beer. Yup. The taste brings in more of the same, a traditional-tasting root beer with a slight intimation that there might be some alcohol back there somewhere. Imagine your uncle (not the creepy one, though) surreptitiously spiking his own soda during an otherwise boring family party, then possibly (you're not entirely sure, though) doing the same for you, despite your youth. Yup. The body is a fluffy medium, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a damn tasty beverage, one that combines my love for a well-made root beer with my love for a good-tasting beer. I can't say this vehemently enough: GET SOME!","TMoney2591","Nov 02, 2012"

Fuller bodied than a non-alcoholic root beer. How they do this is a mystery to me. I love root beer, and of course I love this stuff.","beergurujr","0"
