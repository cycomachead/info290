This beer is a beautiful cloudy orangish brown (it is a part-wheat beer and brewed using weisen yeast, so it is supposed to be cloudy).  nifty lacing.  The spices are there, heaviest on the nutmeg, but not at all overwhelming.  the style is almost perfect for a pumpkin beer, which imho does not benefit from a crisp lager treatment.  not very sweet, but this aids in the drinkability department.  I sure as hell hope they bring this back in future years--I'll certainly be enjoying it while it lasts this season!","brewmudgeon","Oct 08, 2014"

And, instead of going the normal route, they've carved out a brand new path in the world of pumpkin beers - a pumpkin weiss! (I've yet to experience one - even the pumpkin beer connoisseur I am.) Pumpkin Pie Lust's aroma is immediately different and hard to pinpoint with both pie spices and weiss yeast being used in conjunction but, this beer has a great malt profile that carries through the flavor into the soft feel making it a unique and quite drinkable pumpkin beer from one of my favorite breweries!","BeerFMAndy","Oct 05, 2014"
3.75,1.6,,,,,,"This pours a murky brown color with a foamy light brown head. The aroma is rich with pumpkin and spices. The flavor is smooth and rich with pumpkin and spice flavors. Delicious and well-made.","Lemke10","Oct 04, 2014"

3.77,2.2,,,,,,"A solid pumpkin beer. I don't want a pumpkin beer that is too in your face with pumpkin pie spice but I could have used just a little bit more from this one. Also, the appearance was very cloudy which reminded me of a homebrew that doesn't have proper clarity.","mjpolzin","Oct 03, 2014"
