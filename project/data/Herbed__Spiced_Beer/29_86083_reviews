"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, End of the World is very lightly colored for a beer that advertises ""midnight wheat and chocolate malt", it's amber-brown at best. The head is thin and non-active. Rather than a nice semi-liquid yeast at the bottom of a wheat beer that you can gently swirl in, this beer has large chunky particulate that takes forever but eventually settles to the bottom of the glass - not very appealing. The nose is unremarkable for a chili and spiced beer, wheat and weak chocolate malt notes is all I'm getting. The taste is a little more interesting with some spicy notes and chili flavors coming through; seems overly bitter as a side effect from the spices. Mouthfeel is thin and carbonation is minimal, chunky bits lose points. Overall a miss by AB on this one in my opinion."

"Shock Top End Of The World Midnight Wheat ---3/5."

"I was pleasantly surprised by the Shock Top offering of ""end of the world midnight wheat"". I picked up a twelve pack for 11.99 and I consider the money well spent. Do not be turned off by the chili flavoring as it is not too pronounced and actually adds something to this brew. If you can get any of the Shock Top offerings at a decent price, they should be considered."

"D - Not bad, it isn't as interesting as it sounds on the label, but considering the source I didn't expect all that much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Unexpectedly drinkable for how dark a beer is it. Goes down very easy, and at a respectable, but not ridiculous, ABV of 6.0% you could kick back a few of these on a chilly day and feel alright about it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad try, but not one I'd buy a sixer of either. Better than most of the Shock Top portfolio"
""
""
"O - Overall, A very average beer. Could work as a cross over."
""
""
""
"Overall, it's not a bad beer by any means, it just doesn't really stand out from the crowd."
"O - A dialed-down version of a style done much better elsewhere. That said - if somehow BMC drinkers switched to this because of the AB label, it would be a huge step up. Definitely not a repeat buy for this BA, however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall the beer is not so much bad taste wise as it is underwhelming and monotone coming off rather bland and lifeless, safe and conservative, with a mute and underutilized spicing that seemed like they were hesitant to pull off in the first place. Drinking factor is flat-line for me, could care less."

"Hazy brown in color with a tight tan head that leaves splotchiness and a ring inside rim of glass. Smells are bready with a hint of banana. Tastes is a bit bland and dry. Not really sweet but not really bitter either. I can't really pick up the chili that's advertised. There is a hint of spice towards the finish. And a touch of cocoa but I do mean a touch. Not bad but pretty average."
"O - I waited about two months too long to drink this beer. I found it at the local grocery store and thought the chocolate malt and peppers were an interesting combination. They were albeit, not real strong in flavor. This may have been better fresh, but it an A-B product, so I doubt it ever had a lot of flavor. Overall, it is the best Shock Top I have had."
""
""
""
" A little citrus, but very bitter, almost like they used grapefruit? Vary bold flavor that left a bitter aftertaste. Very full bodied and heavy to drink."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very interesting beer. Chocolate and spice in this one are a good introduction to spices in beer. Interesting and drinkable, too bad this is a one time seasonal, it's a good change of pace."
""
""
"Pours a hazy, copper color. 6/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, hint of hop, hint of spices (coriander?), hint of wheat, and slight adjunct. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable metallic flavor. Fits the style of an herbed / spiced beer better than it fits into the American Pale Wheat style. Tastes of a pale malt, slight sweet malt, hint of wheat, hint of spices, slight metallic of adjunct, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, weak body that is dominated by metallic flavors."

"Overall: To be quite frank, I wasn't expecting much out of this beer. But i guess I set my hopes a little too high to begin with when I read on the bottle the ingoing spices and all. Maybe my palate is a little off, but I didn't once taste chili. Overall, this isn't a TERRIBLE beer, but definitely just reminded me of a hybrid Shock Top. I probably won't have this beer again, mainly because it's a limited release. I guess the big breweries tried on this one, and it didn't go exactly as planned. Just took a popular, trending topic and made a beer out of it in an attempt to boost sales. I'll look elsewhere next time if they release a ""Return of Jesus"" beer. Cheers!"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a promo glass acquired with the beer. Pours a dark red with a nice off white head. Smells of wheat and dark malt. Tastes of hints of caramel and a little chocolate, nothing too special, but dominated by wheat. Beer goes down real smooth and is very drinkable, light bodied. Overall, a slightly above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a light brown color with a foamy beige head. There is a slight scent of chocolate and chili spice mixed with wheat. This is a complex, darker wheat flavor with elements of chocolate and spice as it promises. Surprisingly decent for being an AB-InBev competition product to Blue Moon’s line."
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer but nothing overly spectacular."
""
""
""
"Fun concept but this whole Shock Top brand is simply reactionary to what smaller brewers have already done. Just feels like every release they are pulling their punch. Sort of a muddled mess, one and done."
""
""
"I really wish this was more than a sessional brew, I spun my first one in late november, expecting something less than good. Thankfully I was wrong, the mild spiced flavor was a celebration in my mouth with a hint of chocolate that I could barely taste, seemingly a teaser for one to explore. The semi dark color hinted to a heavier feel, which I did not find in this generally whimsical lubricating experience."
"O - not bad"
""
""
"Also, I couldn't find any food that went very well with it."
""
""
"3.74/5.00"
""
"Overall - I came into this beer expecting it to be awful, and I came away quite surprised. I'll be damned if Shock Top didn't finally produce a beer with decent flavor. Sure there are some minor flaws, mostly the supporting flavors that don't hit quite on the levels they should, but all in all, this is a very solid effort."
""

""
""
""

""
""
"Well....to get back on topic, it's a drinkable beer that you can have multiple iterations of if you can tolerate shock top and like wheat beer; this case will be in your price point...so grab it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty different beer here, worth looking for and giving a try and with a pretty good ABV."
""
"Tried this today and loved it. I love IPA's, this is not as bitter, great for non-IPA enjoyers. Not as filling as other dark ales, very enjoyable. I see bad reviews, but this beer got me to sign up here and offer a few good words. I enjoy Shock Top, this is a surprising departure."
""
"O: okay selection for people interested in light flavors. Would not but again."
""
""
""
""
"Darker Beer, Poured DArk with almost no lace sticking around on the top, AT first when reading the label you think this will be an interesting beer to try... well personally its not. I thought this beer was horrible and was disappointed by it. I thought there would be a heavy flavor due to the fact it has chocolate and chillis in it. but that was not the case. it seemed like the beer was confused."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sheesh! Now they are giving us directions on how to pour their beer ... I am a) astounded and b) disinterested. My pour created a nice two-finger cap of dense, rocky light-tan head with decent retention. Color was a murky brownish-amber, kind of like turbid river water. Nose held some promise with notes of chocolate and some kind of spice. I do not know that I would have guessed ""Chili", but there was a spiciness to the nose. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the flavors were very muted. Yes, I perceived both chocolate and spice, but nowhere near the level of yesterday's Theobroma or even Organic Chocolate. Finish was semi-dry and mildly spicy, but the whole thing lacked Oomph! It just did not seem an appropriate way to see the world end."
""
"Shock Top End of the World Midnight Wheat seems slightly better than other Shock Top products thanks to the slightly fuller body, but it is still lacking in a few areas. It may not be the end of the world, but those who sample this beer may very well hope for more end of the world predictions and, along with them, better beer products that use this theme."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of wheat and spices. Taste is spicy, wheat, a touch of chocolate, different and unique. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"It took me three bottles of this stuff for me to figure out if I liked it enough to buy again. I think I will. I like the spiciness of it, and the slight taste of chili, even though I'd like it even more if those flavors were a little stronger. The chocolate maltiness is nice, too, and overall this is a pretty snappy, tasty beer. I'm not all that familiar with the Shock Top Family... I mean, I know it's an Anheuser-Busch product... I just mean I haven't tried them all and this is the first one I've reviewed. Where was I? Oh yeah, so anyway, it's not bad. In fact, it's actually pretty good, especially if you remember to swirl the beer around a little in the bottle when there's about an inch left in it, before pouring it all into your glass. That not only gives you a little extra head, but it definitely helps bring out more of the spicy flavor in the wheat sediment at the bottom of the bottle. So yeah, I'd recommend it. Not extremely good or anything, but better than average, and definitely impressive for AB/InBev."
""
""
"Overall - Overall this is a decent diversion from the normal. I could enjoy a 6 pack no problem, but 12 would find themselves sitting in the fridge a bit."
""
""
"I'm hoping this isn't my last beer if the world ends soon. Nothing exciting."
""
""
""
"Overall, much more subtle in both flavor and aroma than anticipated. Pepper is not overwhelmingly hot, just noticeable. I've had light mass-produced beers with more flavor...oh, wait...it's AB/InBev."
""
""
"O- Not great."
""
""
""
"Overall it is better than I thought but could easily be better. Give it a shot if your not into anything bold."
""
""
""
""
"A low-end, entry-level brew for adventurous Bud drinkers. Still, its a try at something different, and could be someone's stepping stone towards better craft beer."
""

"wow surprise what a great beer taste like a scottish ale and they are few and far between and a wheat my frist great great look great pour i highy recommend this beer dont know what other want in their but this is what i want what i like so enjoy anytime"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pours a murky brown color with an off white head that quickly reduced to a filmy layer. Doesnt have much of an aroma i could only detect some wheat, citrus and hay. Tastes like it smells, just a little better with a hint of grassy hop. Goes down smooth and refreshing and is actuallu not bad. Now this beer might please everybody but it's actually a nice easy drinking brew and I could drink a couple more honestly."
""
""
""
"This beer is almost perfect. It pours dark brown with an thick off-white cream that quickly fades. Smell is of spice, a bit of pepper and the tiniest note of cocoa. Taste has a bitter wheat taste that fades into cocoa if you have a small taste. A larger taste more emphasizes the other flavors of the spices as well as the chili. The chili flavor gradually grows as you drink the beer. Whoever thought chocolate and chili should go together was a culinary genius."
""
""
"Like driving past a car wreck, I just had to try this. Not something I'd like to repeat."
"O- this one just didn't do it for me. It's an interesting take and I'm glad to see them trying new things, but I won't be purchasing this one any time soon."
"I think this beer is far better than any of the other Shock Top offerings. It's not tremendously flavored and it won't impressive any beer snob, but from a macro this is an intriguing beer that dares to be different. I like the addition of the cocoa and spices with a wheat base. I don't think I will buy this again, but I'm glad I tried it. I'd also like to see other breweries try something similar."
""
""
""
"O: I would probably give it a 3.25 but I can't. One of the better beers from shock top"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Focus groups."
""
"Overall not an outstanding Chili beer, but I'm going to finish the six pack and could see ordering this if nothing better is available. Probably the best beer in the Shock Top beer Series."
"Overall – Not a beer I would likely take on again. The flavors just did not transition or even go well with each other. Not my thing."
"Overall. I bough a 6 pack of this and this is number 5(1 bottle per sitting) i kept thinking some other factor was influencing my enjoyment of the beer but i think its just average with some above average marketing."
""
"O - Shock Top End of the World Midnight Wheat has almost nothing going for it. The aroma and flavor are bland, barely managing to formulate a cohesive direction especially with all the ingredients they've added. This beer isn't bad per se, but the potential for it was big and Shock Top didn't deliver on any level."
"Taste is chocolate, with a hint of heat from the chilis and spices. It's a different kind of flavor, and unlike anything else I've had, but at the same time, not one I'd care to revisit, either."
""
""
""
""
"If you like chili on a chilly fall day, this is worth trying for the novelty factor, but I wouldn't say that it's much more than that. It's also a fun beer to try with non-BA friends since it's not super-weird or over the top... just a nice beany chili flavor on top of an easy going wheat beer base. Burping tastes like chili 15 min after finishing."
"Half finger head with some lacing on a murky/muddy brown body. Chocolate malt, earthy hops and breads. Flavor is similar with a chocolate malt base, pepper, earthy good and a slight metallic finish. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. As expected a bit watery, under malted but decent flavor for the brewer."
"This is one of the best three AB beers I have had. I know there are 150 micros that do it better, but this is darn good and will reach many many more people."
""
"O - This was an okay brew. It seems a bit like a mix of several different styles of beer."
"Ending my day with the End of the World. Apropos, no? This stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of dusty off-white foam. The nose comprises biscuit, light toffee, light green chiles, and a kiss of cocoa powder. Things are kinda bland and fairly muddled. The taste holds notes of honey, light toffee, light cocoa powder, mildly spicy chiles, brown sugar, and a bit of toasted biscuit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda grainy feel. Overall, not a bad little spiced/chile beer, one that doesn't let the chiles or spices overwhelm the background malts, nor vice-versa. Not bad, actually (kinda surprising, honestly)."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: ok, it says on the side of the bottle, there's chili and spice, and once again, I'll use that old Wendy's line, ""where's the [chili and spice]?"" So if this is supposed to be so complex with other flavors, where are they? In retrospect, I will say fitting name as this will be the ""end of the world"" for this beer. Cue Dierks Bentley - ""what was I thinking?"""
""
""
"I was curious to see what this beer was about and grabbed a bottle at the local shop. It said midnight wheat...hoped it was black but it looks like the chocolate malts dominated. Its more like a brownish dunkel weiss. If you say there is midnight wheat, make it black as midnight...lame. The smell is not amazing but its definitely different. You can smell something going on in there but its hard to notice. Maybe the spices but not sure what those are...nutmeg? When it comes to the taste this beer is pretty good. Nothing outstanding but heck, it kind of burns from the peppers but in the flavor its hard to really determine what is going on. Kind of like the smell. It totally drinks stronger than the 6% abv on the bottle. I have had 10% beers easier to drink than this. There is a hint of dark malts but no hops of any from. The mouthfeel is very carbonated. It cleans away the flavor well to get ready for another sip. Overall, this is not that bad. is it worth a 6 pack? No. Was it worth a sample? Sure if you are into wheat beers. However I really think that the idea was a good one but at a macro level this beer kinda fades into the ether and I cannot see myself telling folks..hey that beer is a good one. I feel that the label got more time than the formula. But its not that bad. I think I am more or less disappointed."

"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and slight amounts of cocoa and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty flavor on the finish. There is also a very mild chili heat in the back of the throat that quickly dies out. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer taste wise but the smell is decent enough."
""
"Overall: A confused, mildly interesting tasting beer from the megabrewer Anheuser Busch, but far too watery to be considered a fine beer. Without some fullness or broader flavor it will be the End of the World for this brew."
""
"Had to do it. Pours cloudy tea colored with a etched surface of tan. Smells of wheat, coriander, cinnamon, some milky smells. Tastes like powdered cocoa, wheat, a bit of charcoal, some more coriander and a bit of fucking terrible. No, it's just terrible. Thin with hi carb and a dry finish. This is just really disappointing from such a reputable brewer."

"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Overall, it's okay, but I'll stick with their pumpkin wheat."
""
"The meat and chili taste was unique, and not bad, but this beer is just too... weird. It's not awful, but it's not good enough to want again and again. I commend the uniqueness, but that's about it."
"Overall: A major disappointment given the interesting description of this beer. In different hands, I think a dark wheat beer with chocolate and chilis could be very promising. Unfortunately, Shock Top's version is just too light and half-assed to go anywhere."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a strange drink with a mixed smell and taste. Did anyone at AB try this before it went to mass production?"
"The feel is actually the best aspect. The body reaches medium and there's a creaminess that never falls off along with a crispness that is similarly steadfast."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty drinkable beer. 8.49 per sixer where I'm at, which isn't cheap, but not bad."
""
""
""
""
"I know that this will probably receive poor reviews for the most part... we have mostly become snobs lol... but it is a easy to drink, session beer with a unique flavor. For the cheap price and the ability to session... enjoy. :-)"
""
""
""
"keep adding new beers to this line."
""
""
""
"M: full texture; creamy"
"Final Thoughts: High on ingredients and low on flavor. Would I drink this again? No."
""
"Overall not an outstanding Chili beer, but I'm going to finish the six pack and could see ordering this if nothing better is available. Probably the best beer in the AB Shock Top beer Series."
