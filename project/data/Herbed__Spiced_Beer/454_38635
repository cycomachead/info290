2.4,-26.6,2.5,2.5,2.25,3,2.25,"Overall I thought this wasn't a good beer and i thought that it was a poor example of a Pumpkin Ale, instead of letting the pumpkin shine it was dominated by the cinnamon and that didn't let through any nice supporting flavors.  This beer didn't have good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, a little watery, not filling and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, I have no urge at all to drink another one in a row.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the only aspect that wasn't below average.  What I liked the least about this beer was taste, it just wasn't good and it didn't really have any redeeming aspects.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, now i see why i haven't had it in a couple years.  I wouldn't recommend this beer, it's just not a good example of the style.  All in all I didn't like this beer, Arcadia is a good brewery, but this isn't a good beer and I don't understand why they choose to release this below average Pumpkin Ale every year.  This is my least favorite beer from Arcadia and it's one of my least favorite Pumpkin Ales.  Better luck next time guys, this one needs some major work.","StoutHunter","Sep 20, 2014"

3.58,9.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, fall 2014 bottling. Pours lightly hazy bright orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with god balance and solid complexity of dark/bready malt and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and solid complexity of dark/bready malt and spice flavors; with a good malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very solid spiced ale. Good balance and solid complexity of dark/bready malt and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A bit one dimensional, but nicely enjoyable otherwise.","superspak","Sep 06, 2014"

Odd flavors are dominated by the spices. Cinnamon, allspice, & nutmeg, earthy hop, caramel, rye bread come to mind. Body is thin-to-medium, modest carbonation.

This beer, overall, is worth a try - indeed, I'd give it major props as an accessible version of a pumpkin ale - but, in the end it leaves me reaching into the fridge for a darker, thicker, and, well, spookier brew.","TheBigLebrewski","Oct 09, 2012"

Thereâ€™s a noticeable holiday spice on the aromaâ€” nutmeg, allspice & some cloveâ€”with the flavor matching the aroma. The spices are complemented by a sharp bittering. Itâ€™s effervescent, very light on the palate. Itâ€™s not boozy but thereâ€™s a boozy mouthfeel similar to that from bigger beers Iâ€™ve sampled.

When mixed with the caramel malts it really gives that fall flavor and is quite nice. The mouth is a tad too watery for my liking, but be cause of the flavors you can power through it.

The ale claims to have spices added (cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg). Thats kind of what it taste like. An over mix of spices in liquid with a bitter aftertaste. Nasty film develepment on the gums. The mouthfeel is actually pretty nice. I can enjoy it up till the point I start to taste the wicked culmination of spices. Feels dense, like it looks, with a medium sharp carbonation.

The flavors are not overdone keeping this one away from some of the artificiality that is sometimes standard in these pumpkin offerings. I'm glad that Arcadia didn't add any pumpkin,it helps the spice to build off of the malt flavors creating a pumpkin pie feel without taking anything away from the natural flavors. The body is medium to thin with just a touch of slickness,the carbonation is on the high end,but acceptable for the style.
