"Appearance is a light yellow with a fizzy white head. The smell was great with a lot of orange and lime scents coming through strong. The taste was nice enough with some of those lime and orange flavors, although it seemed more of a zest in the beginning than a major part of the beer. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Nice for summer, almost like a lime radler, but overall not as impressive as I had hoped."
"Received this as part of a variety pack.  What a pleasant surprise! Very drinkable and refreshing.  Great drinking, talking, summer beer"
"Overall, a very nice wheat beer with good wheat flavor presence and unique aromas from the additions."

"Wasn't a big fan. It sounded impressive from the description and i was excited about the citrus tones which is what i look for in a summer beer and this one in particular sounded good. Unfortunately i was disappointed. The initial lemony/hoppy taste in great but then there's this lingering herbaly aftertaste that really bothers me. It kinda plays a trick on your mouth between a refreshing summer beer and a rugged ipa. and dont get me wrong i love rugged ipas but in this fashion it just doesn't really work. Anyway a little disappointed that i still have 2 of these in the pack but overall the beer is by no means terrible."
"The taste has a nice toasted biscuit malt character but unlike the aroma there is more of a citrus-like character kicking in. This works on a hot day like today."

"Overall: Interesting summer offering. If you like lemons and weirdness, you'll probably big this. Not a revelation but not a drainpour either."

"Hard to describe this brew. Sort of a cross between a hefeweizen with a wedge of lemon and a medium strength IPA. Ok, but probably not a repeater."
"Draught: This one pours a clear golden color. There was a decent sized white head on it that left some lacing. It has a lighter nose. Nice, but not much to it. Maybe some wheat, lemon and spices. The taste is good, but a little light also. Floral and earthy notes. OK"

"Not your typical summer brewâ€”rather than just pushing out the usual citrus-infused Wheat or Blonde Ale, Baxter uses both lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves on top of the lemon and lime additions. Each sip smacks of all of this. Stays drinkable and keeps our palates in check. Baxter, making the summer interesting."

"O) A delicious brew for a hot day. The spices are a pleasant addition."

"Overall: Not bad, I have had it a couple times now, and I would drink this if it was offered to me again."

"This was a decent offering and my first beer from Baxter. I had it on tap at the Tip Tap Room. It was surprisingly clear for an unfiltered offering. The golden color was still nice, with a big frothy head. The tartness of the citrus was a bit much...almost to the point of being sour. Not bad overall."
""
"O: An interesting take on a summer beer, this one is not quite a light/thin as the others in that style...maybe that is a reflection of the slightly more temperate summers they experience in Maine. Low in ABV but not the easiest to drink and not sure I would call it sessionable."

"o - Overall a pretty nice low ABV summer beer. Brewed with lemongrass and lime, they don't come through a lot in the nose but do in the taste. A nice crisp beer worth checking out."

"o - really solid session beer for the summer in a can."
"More lavender on the tongue. Lightly sweet, but the finish is very dry with a peppery hop kick. More bitter than expected. The body is as expected with an elevated carbonation level."
"O: Another great beer from Baxter. Had this on-tap in Bar Harbor, as well, and it's just as good."
"O: I think I'd like this more (don't get me wrong, I do like it) if it weren't so bitter throughout. It makes it a bit more difficult to really session, but it is possible to get around it. It is a summer ale, after all"

"This is the first Baxter beer I've actually thought to be well-executed. It is refreshing and free of defects, an as-advertised summer ale. Alas, it still does not do a whole lot for me personally."
"O/D-Almost reminds me of a gin and tonic with a lime wedge plugged onto the lid of the glass. Very acidic. Rarely do you get lime as a flavor in beer (Besides Bud Light Lime of course!). I find this to be Baxter's most well crafted beer, but it doesn't suit my beer needs. Nevertheless, this is a far beyond average Summer brew and it is worthy of purchase."

"Poured a 2"" white head with medium life. The body is a slightly hazed light yellow. It smells of malt, citrus, and spice. The taste mirrors the smell but also has a nice hops backbone and it's the hops that carry through in a medium long finish. Quite refresing. Good summer ale."
"Poured from the can into a pint glass. Very bright yellow color with a nice fluffy head. I was turned off though by the copious amounts of floaties (lemon chunks) swirling in my glass. I guess it was meant to be drunk straight from the glass, as I didn't find it very visually appealing. Great citrus smell. Very fresh and fruity flavor. The huge amounts of lemons and limes come through. Mothfeel was not too tart, which was nice. I found this to be a flavorful summer ale that I'd drink again, straight from the can."
"Overall not bad, interesting citrus and rind spices, decent hops, malts and wheat flavors underneath add a nice touch, good carb, but the overall spices just seem, not where I want them to be, maybe, can't really label it more than that."

"Hands down the best Summer beer I've had due to low abv, it's full of flavor despite that low abv, and it comes in a take everywhere can. My only qualm is that the aroma is so striking that you lose a lot in the can. Bring a Solo cup."
"The body is medium and somewhat sticky. Overall another solid offering from these guys. I'm sure this will be a summer staple for me."

"Not a beer to drink again. I poured two to see if the first can was an anomaly; it wasn't."
"O: another good beer from Baxter's. Get to the head of the grill line - Summer Swelter (formerly named Celsius)! Well done!"
"Poured from a can into a tumbler, the beer is a bright, hazy, unfiltered, lemon-yellow coloring with a light, frothy, low profile white head. Aromas are light and crisp, with a toasted grain backbone and citrusy highlights. Flavors are toasted cereal, with a tangy, sweet, and slightly zesty lemon and lime blended highlight. Spiced overtones, with coriander, lemongrass, and a touch of nutmeg. Very well blended, and remains crisp and effervescent overall. Smooth bodied throughout, with a light feel despite the dynami palate. The aftertaste is roasty and sweet, with a grain/cereal profile. The finish is effervescent, light, and has a slight linger to it. Very easy to drink, and extremely sessionable. Great warm weather brew."

"Edited to add: You'll probably finish it too fast to notice, but you get a nice hit of lemon as it warms!"
