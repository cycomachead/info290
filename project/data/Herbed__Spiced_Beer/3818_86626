3.59,-2.7,2.5,3.5,3.5,5,3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours with about a finger's width of off-white foam.  Color is difficult to determine because of how murky it is. Looks like a reddish brown color. There is an overwhelming amount of particles floating throughout the brew. Has a strong fig and spice aroma (nutmeg and cinnamon?) with a hint of orange peel. Initial taste is of fig and spices followed by slight orange peel flavor. Malts and hops enter the taste palate as the fig flavors disappear but the orange peel and spices remain. Overall taste is very unique, but nothing impressive. An above average beer. Definitely wouldn't mind drinking again.","Myotus","Mar 26, 2015"

The only “negative” aspect of the beer is that the flavor of the beer doesn’t really match the aroma, meaning, there is less gingerbread in the flavor than is promised in the aroma.  That being said, it’s an extremely tasty beer and one that I will certainly get again next winter!","Jeffreysan","Jan 23, 2015"

3.73,1.1,4,4,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Overall / Drinkability:  Definitely right that this beer was labeled as an Herbed/Spiced beer rather than as a winter warmer.  This beer is very intense in the spices and while I've not had a Swedish Glogg, it definitely reminds me of a highly spiced tea/winter drink.  If there are hops in this I cannot detect them over all the spices.  Overall, a glass of Christmas spice smell in a glass.  Drinkability.....this one was hard to finish and while it was good to try for the concept, I could easily see one either loving or hating this beer.  I found it interesting, but I think I would be forcing myself to finish off a whole bottle - so I'm glad I shared it with others.  So not high drinkability, but I'll give it good marks for depth and intensity of flavor.","damndirtyape","Beers"

This ginger flavor is more in line with the root than with the holiday cookie. Clove in here as well. Ends somewhat dry and peppery too. The biggest disappointment for me was the role the orange plays. The orange must contribute to the spicing, because it certainly doesn't lend any actual orange flavor (or citrus refreshment for that matter). Other than that, this beer seems to live up to resembling the spicier mulled wine flavors of the Norwegian glogg for which it's named. Not my favorite style, but pleasant.. and one and done.","TBoneJones","Beers"

Mouthfeel is thin light and just slightly bitter, but definitely not really sweet. Overall, it's OK. I think I would have rated this a bit higher before Christmas, but now after the holidays, somethings wore off.

The nose is all cardamom, anise, pine sap, clove and cinnamon, huge cleansing lift in the nostrils, milk chocolate and orange peels, not getting the figs nor other fruit here, basically smells like the bowls of seeds and stuff at the entrance to an Indian restaurant. Medium-bodied, tightly woven carbonation, erect posture, on the dry side given the constituent elements. Ginger, cardamom, clove, cinnamon, cola, chocolate, light caramel. Again, has a sort of mentholated cleansing feel, fresh and tingly. Still not getting much fig or other dried fruits, some light apple or peach maybe. Soft undercurrent of blanched nuts. Easy to see how the intensity of the spices could polarize, love it or hate it. Finding it food friendly and lack of sweetness adds to versatility.

Significant amount of white grayish lacing at the top, quickly dissipates though. Nutmeg and other Christmas spices emanate from the glass. Get a hint of orange peel in the taste, along with a Carmel toffee taste. Bottle says that it includes figs which definitely comes out on the palate. Mentions that uses two hop varietals and 4 malts. Not sure what tradition of Swedish glogg brewing is but apparently that's the metho of brewing. An excellent Christmas ale.","Ryanm1","Dec 23, 2013"

It has a painful taste, like chugging a bottle of cinnamon, I truly have no idea how anyone enjoys this beer and at the craft beer store I work at it is EASILY the most hated beer among the staff not just of the seasonals but of any beers.

There is dark fruits, cinnomon, nutmeg, fruit cake, and holiday spices with hints of citrus. The taste follows suit but not as powerful.

Pours lightly hazy ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big raisin, fig, orange peel, caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, clove, nutmeg, floral, brown bread, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of malt, fruit, and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, fig, orange peel, caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, clove, nutmeg, light anise, floral, brown bread, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of dark fruit, orange peel, brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, light anise, floral, brown bread, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity of malt, fruit, and spice flavors; with a great sweetness/spice balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice spiced Christmas ale! Great balance and complexity of malt, fruit, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 26, 2013"

There's a little bit of clashing that goes on here and there with some of the more aggressive flavors, but that's par for the course. Fermented sweetness, a faint pine undertone, slight warnings of a vodka and red wine hangover. Southern Tier has earned some more brownie points by resonating with my semi-Scandanavian heart.","ommegangpbr","Jan 07, 2013"

Aromas of heavy spicing and fruit, with a rich, sweet cherry and berries backbone giving rise to all-spice, coriander, and fennel. Smells very festive and warm. Flavors are rich and roasty, with a cinnamon and cider theme. Cherry cordial and licorice form the base of the brew, with the all-spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg filling the rest of the palate. Candied overtones, with an evergreen highlight throughout. It's like Yankee Candle made a holiday beer flavor in drinking form. Screams christmas time. The aftertaste is more of a linger of the spicing, with a strong herbal tea characteristic. Filmy, slightly lingering finish to the brew. Overall, you don't really notice the 8% ABV while drinking, which makes it easier to drink a few of these at a time, in turn keeping you nice and toasty on those cold winter nights.

It's a clear, reddish colored liquid with a thin tan head. Medium carbonation. The smell is fruit and spice, with a bit of toasted malt in the background. The fruit is hard to place. The label says fig, but I'm getting a lot of orange and lemon peel. The peel/rind theme plays into the taste as well, which is also full of fruit and spice...a bit of bitterness from the former, as well as the latter. Firm body, good balance. The beer just doesn't really come together, though...the bitterness is distracting. Not bad, just not up to my expectations.","Suds","Dec 26, 2012"

This beer had ok drinkability, it went down fairly smooth and the flavor held my attention but I don't think that I would want to follow it up with another one. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma , it's pretty intense with lots of spices going on, like I said it smells like Christmas in a glass. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad at all, but I could go with out the stickyness. I would buy a couple bottles for Christmas next year but this isn't a beer I'll be really stocking up on, I recommend giving this a try if your in the mood for a good spiced Christmas Ale. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it was pretty fitting for the holiday season and the aroma and taste seemed to embody Christmas in beer form. Southern Tier seems to be a pretty solid brewery and I think all three beers in the 2X series are good, I hope to see some new beers added to this series. Good job Southern Tier this is a nice Holiday brew, it makes me want to throw some logs in the fireplace.","StoutHunter","Dec 22, 2012"

Hop bitterness is almost non-existent, so this beer is unbalanced and malty. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, for the style, this beer does a fine job.

Not to much activity on the top, just a sparse amount of off white bubbles that die down quick. Eventually, the beer looks dead. Smell gives me a mix of a spiced beer and a winter warmer. The fig representation is large, behind that caramel malt, some dark fruit scents, plum, and light chocolate. More spice with warming. This takes some sips to get used to, off put by the large fig presense, the caramel/chocolate malt combo comes through in the middle, followed by a spicy finish. Hops are minimal and not making a dent. body is smooth and a healthy medium with almost no carbonation down the gullet, this one is nearing flat, I think maybe this is intentional in the Glogg tradition. While I enjoyed this I dont see myself making this a tradition, good for the season though. Would probably pair well with some Christmas ham.

4.17,13,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Definitely fits the bill as a holiday beer. This may very well be the best holiday ale I've had. It's big and bold with sweet and spice and everything nice. Very warming and just really hits the mark for being a Xmas brew.","jera1350","Nov 15, 2012"
3.97,7.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Flavorful, fruity, sweet, highly spiced...tastes like a holiday fruit cake, in a good way. On the heavier side mouthfeel wise. Would work well with holiday desserts or as a holly jolly night capper. I like it","Billolick","Nov 15, 2012"

3.44,-6.8,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured out brown-ish red color with a thin white head. The head fades rapidly. The smell of the beer has a pretty good spicy aroma to it. The taste is sweet with a spicy flavor, some berry notes and cinnamon mostly. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a smooth carbonation to it. Overall it's a decent holiday brew. Worth trying.","Knapp85","Nov 12, 2012"
3.97,7.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall - Really tasty, and lots of flavor. One of the more spice heavy beers ive had. The malts are roasty and work well with this beer. Hops are buried under eveything to were i dont taste them at all, but other then that its a great spiced beer. Really easy to drink, so the Alcohol can sneek up on you. This could pass as apumkin beer really, but the cinnamin nutmeg give it enough of a winter warmer feel. Worth a drink for sure.","wvsabbath","Nov 11, 2012"

Haven't run across a 'Glögg' before, but they are pretty damn cool and perfect for ushering in the Holiday spirit. I was very skeptical of this beer, but I ended up enjoying it. I can't wait to scream "MY BEER TASTES LIKE SANTA!" to the next person I see.","VelvetExtract","Nov 09, 2012"
4.17,13,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The beer pours a dark, red-brown color with a dense, fluffy tan head that fades, but never completely dissipates. The nose is rich and spicy with notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar. It's very appealing considering the different spice profile ST used in this beer compared to other over-the-top winter warmers It's almost like the goose island winter brown ale for comparison. The taste is well spiced with a modest fig sweetness and semi-dry finish. It drinks like liquid dessert, but doesn't get old. The body is rich and inviting. Honestly, this may be one of my favorite winter beers considering the unique spice profile, drinkability, price, and availability. I just want to get into a wool turtleneck and eat a winter ham while drinking this beer.","ThePorterSorter","Nov 09, 2012"

4.09,10.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 10/17/12. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a clear ruby red color with about a quarter inch off-white head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing. Aroma is sweet and spicy, it smells like ginger, cinnamon, orange peel, candied oranges, figs, and some cloves. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, except that there's a slight bitterness noticeable. Also, the aroma seems stronger compared to the flavor of the beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, I know I'll be enjoying the rest of my 6-pack! $10.99 a sixer.","bluejacket74","Nov 09, 2012"
