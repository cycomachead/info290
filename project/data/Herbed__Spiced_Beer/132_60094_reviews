"A beer that literally brought a smile to my face, and did so once again when I brought it home and had it months later with a friend, who also couldn't help but smile at the citrusy hops, shimmer of pine interwoven with woodsy, sunshiny spruce, and a subtle carbonation. Hazy burnt gold with a nice frothy head that fades to a lace. This one just hit it on the nose for me."

"finishes sweet on the back end. Complex ending here. Its a great beer for fall season and the cool nights. But still does not hit the juniper notes I've still looking for. So to that end, I'll still drop a shot of gin into a Torpeda IPA for full effect."

"The body is a solid medium but thins a little at the end of every sip as the booze sneaks in. It's got a moderate crispness and is pretty smooth overall. A woody note hovering in the finish is good until a little whisper of astrincency sneaks in."

"Found it very similiar to belgian golden ales, but also had the bitterness of hops added to it. Refreshing."
""
"Overall: A very interesting beer. As a lover of juniper and gin, this one matches some gin-like tastes pretty well, especially in the finish. It is an enjoyable experience, and I'll definitely be reaching for another one of these from time to time."

"O: Not too much different than the base beer, but still good. You really only get the barrels at the very front of the taste. Nice to try, but once is enough because it just doesn't differ much from the regular"
"By this, in a more literal sense, I mean that the strong aspects of the mouthfeel aren't concentrated in a certain part of the mouth - little sparks of action seem to materialize in different parts of the mouth, albeit not so aggresively. A fun beer to drink for this reason, and because it's a solid beer with the added aspect of having been gin-barrel-aged."
"O: Really a quite odd beer - to me it tastes like a citrus IPA with brett. The juniper berries and gin barrels provide a decent flavor, but it's just decent."
"Overall - an enjoyable specialty variation. Very enjoyable."
""
""
"Thankfully, the flavor seemed to have a tiny bit more kick than the aroma, with light herbal hopping / gin herbals / woody pine aspects over a disturbingly mild base beer profile. In the case of the flavor, my criticism is that it seems more like a diluted gin than a gin-augmented beer. If I were to pretend that this was my own homebrew project, I'd be trying to find a way to amplify the flavor profile of the beer base by about 20% and the gin-barrel characteristics by about 10% for the next batch."

"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light orange amber with little head and no lacing. Interesting faint spruce, juniper and citrus start with citrus middle and pleasant herbal, hop finish. Medium malt base and body. An enjoyable juniper flavored ale."

"I like the Juniper Pale just fine, but the gin barrel aging is interesting and it hurts the original beer. Tough to pull off a gin barrel aged beer, anyway. Props. 3.5"
"John and John need a more flattering photo for their label art."

"O: Weird. Not a huge fan. Won't be giving this a second chance."
"D: Out of the park. If you are looking for something unique but fully drinkable, you must seek this out. Its uniqueness alone is a must try. I would gladly drink this again."
"O: Definitely different, but the flavors mix well with one another and they aren't all competing for attention. I was surprised at how well balanced and tame the beer was. Some of these flavors can be very strong."
"Drinkability - leave it to a beer to open my eyes to gin. I won't be hopping onto ginadvocate any time soon, but I enjoyed the beer and would have it again, and would absolutely consider it as a fun component of a pale ale / herb / spice beer tasting."
"This is a really, really good beer. I'd drink this all the time, it's so damn refreshing. Give this a chance!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a unique beer, and I dig that. The barrel aging takes the Juniper Pale Ale to another level, more so than the whiskey does for Dead Guy in the other John John varietal."
""

"It has a golden-yellow, relatively opaque appearance. Surprisingly for a spiced beer, there is very little smell, with only a faint hint of juniper and hops. A fairly uncomplicated pale ale with a mild juniper taste that gives it a little it a of a rough feel."
""
"O: This is a decent barrel-aged pale ale, but there is something missing here. I was expecting a heavy gin flavor, but did not get it at all. A good effort, but somewhat lacking in my book."
"O: A cool experiment in weird flavors due to the juniper berries and barrel aging. Worth a shot."
"Astringent. It's crazy, and I like crazy. But it's not too tasty. The feel is the worst--like spiked Sprite. Each smell becomes menacing. Am I gin-biased? If you are, I don't recommend this one. There's a tingle, but then there's potent chemical acidifying with destruction your oro-nasal passage. I feel like I could light it on fire. We ask for this crazy shit, and we got it. This is why there's more of a return to the basics in my near future."

"Pint glass at Pizza Port OB in San Diego. Pleasant quaff. A different kind of barrel flavor with definite tastes of the sawmill."

"Pours a slightly hazy amber with a fairly thick and fine-bubbled ivory head. Malty aroma has a firm honey tone but is not overly sweet. Flavor, though, is best of all - malty and rather hoppy with a decided juniper note and a sweet fruity hint. Smooth texture has average body and just a little bit of fizz. Overall, pleasant and tasty, if not outstanding."

"With a 5% ABV, this is very drinkable but certainly not for everybody. Gin drinkers will be more appreciative."
"Serving type: bottle into perfect pint 8.991pt6oz"
"I got a finger of rocky, off-white head with limited retention from the pour. Color was a very cloudy orangish-amber/yellow. Nose smelled like wintergreen, like a snowy forest with pine trees in abundance. I had a Battle of the Bulge vet in last year and he said that when the heavy artillery began toppling trees in the Ardennes Forest, the scent of pine put him off of Christmas trees for life. I had no such experience and love the scent of pine, but no love for celebrating Christmas, so no trees in my house. It was hard to discern between the wood of the barrels and the minty smell of juniper, but either way, I was beginning to champ at the bit to get some on my tongue. It was initially cool and minty with a medium presence on the tongue, which was enjoyable. The finish, however, gave off an intense dill flavor which one previous reviewer referred to as ""pickle-like"". I have to agree there, m'man. This was definitely NOT the sum of its parts. It was not an outright fail, but nor was it a repeater, if you catch my (snow) drift."
"O: Can't think of a reason to buy this again."
"Pours a hazy yellowish orange color with a two finger frothy head which leaves a small amount of lace on the glass. The aroma is of junipers and malt. The taste starts with a juniper and pale malt taste but gives way to a slight spruce flavor. The end of the beer has a gin taste to it from the barrels. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall as the beer went on I began to enjoy it more and more. The taste was intersting and had just enough variety to keep me interested. I would for sure pick this up again."
"This is an interesting idea and I'm glad I tried it but it is entirely undrinkable and I wish I could just drink the same beer but not brewed in gin barrels."
"O: This is an unusual and somehow drinkable beer. It's not something I would drink on a regular basis, but it is well made."
"Overall: Very pleased with this Rouge offering, but I love Gin as well and this has that quality to it with the addition of Juniper berries and what seems to be a lemon zest, bitter orange peel and a small bit of licorice in it. Pretty good!"
"Pours a pale, light yellow color with a soapy head and some lace. Aroma of barrel, wet wood, vegetation, and spruce. In the taste, mild tannins on a very bland body reminiscent of crystal malts and some herbal elements. Hint of a Gin like bite and then washes to nothing. Light bodied, soft carbonation, and a semi clean finish. Overall, an interesting, delicate ale with some gin flavor and mild barrel notes."
"Not bad, I had forgotten that this was a regular strength beer, somehow despite my initial misgivings this lower gravity pale ale works pretty well with this treatment. This is quite drinkable, the fact that it finishes so dry (though it still has some texture / body to it) helps with this immensely too. Definitely worth trying."
"this beer reminds me why i rarely drink Rogue beers. not to be mean but they're often not high quality"
"Its taste is very distinct. Once again, the juniper berries help create it, but the gin barrels seems to give the berries and citrus notes an extra bite in taste. This package helps make a beer that is easy to drink and surprisingly refreshing. Still, the pricetag that it commands ($8 for the pint) mean that future meetings will be scarce."
"The mouthfeel is great, it's nice and juicy at first, but quickly dries out as the gin makes itself known. The drinkability is fairly good, but is impacted by the beer tasting more alcoholic than it actually is. Overall, a solid beer and better than the Hazelnut John John for sure. Recommended, but I wouldn't spend too much on it."
"Overall I do like this one and recommend you try it at least once. I'll buy it again."
"This a fairly simple beer. There is plenty of juniper but the balance doesn't quite seem right."
"This was a little better than the regular Juniper Ale. The pour was orange and had some yellow highlights. The head was thin and didn't lace too much. The smell was a bit more herbal. The taste had subtle flavors of spruce and gin. Still not enough flavor for me to love this beer though. The mouthfeel wasn't much different it was medium bodied. Overall just a touch better than the original, not all in all neither make me wanna run back to the store for more."
"Nothing extraordinairy here, but this is still a solid beer overall I thought."
"D ~ Would and Will buy again. I like this one more than the OG Juniper Pale, the Gin Barrels added more complexity and softened the Juniper flavor."
"Tastes delicious, if you like Juniper that is, my husband doesn't care for them and he could barely stomach this brew. There's a hint of pine flavor too, which makes for a very refreshing flavor. It's getting hot and humid here in MS, and this brew will replace the usual Wits and Heffes on yard work day!"
"overall; get to know and appreciate the flavor profile of juniper and this berr will be appreciated. Much like a Sahti without the spicy Rye flavors. I will be drinking this for Walpurgisnacht."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Overall this is an interesting beer, but it's a one and done for me because of the ""uniqueness"". This would have been a great food beer with a light chicken, turkey or fish dish. Worth a try for the originality but nothing phenomenal or a brew you NEED to try."
"Overall this brew is a mess. I am a fan of Juniper Pale Ale, but this brew is a huge side step from it. Over priced and under developed."
"For taste, John John brings a nice light balance of flavors. Hop spice is evident but not pronounced with some nice bite of carbonation. The juniper berries and spruce add some subtle spice to the hop spice. I believe I get a sort of sour taste, but not something I'm put off by, that lingers a bit along with citrus. The aging in spruce gin barrels have made the pale ale less harsh in its hop spice, something that I'm obsessed with, but the John John Ale is extremely drinkable and an interesting beer to try. It looks and tastes more like a blonde to me, though, not that that's bad. I definitely enjoyed drinking this since it's SO DAMN HOT OUT IN TEXAS. I don't think this is great but it is very good."
"John John Ale has a darkish, cloudy orange colour and a 0.5 cm soapy head that reduces to a nice even lacing very quickly. The smell is slightly sour with fruity berries with a hint of yeast. Interesting, but I don't love it. This beer starts with a sour tang: fruity and yum. The finish is slightly woody with a hint of yeast and smoke. This is a very interesting beer. Worth tasting."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of spruce?, slight sweet malt, ginger?, and slight hop. Fits the style of a Herbed/Spiced beer. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of spruce?, slight ginger, citrus, slight sweet malt, hint of hop, slight oak, slight alcohol. Overall, good aroma, blend, complexity, and body."
"An interesting beer indeed, try it sometime!"
"D- I despise gin now, but this was very good and exceeded my expectations."
"Hell I liked this one.. It grew on me as I sipped it... Pretty drinkable..."
"D: Drinkable but overall I was a little underwhelmed by this brew."
"Pours a hazy yellow amber with a wispy head. Smells like a pine forest, with lots of juniper and some spruce. Definitely somewhat gin-like. The taste is similar but a little softer and even more gin-like. Less of an impact from the spruce. Soft and sort of like a watered down martini. Interesting, and fairly enjoyable."
"D: Its ok to try but probablt will not drink again."
"One thing I've noticed, if the review gets wordy, it deserves a superior score. Here's one to seek out for something different yet not extreme in any way."
"22 ounce bomber. Poured into a basic pint glass. Color is a bright golden yellow. Big pillowy head with some pretty darned nice lacing. Smell is of, perhaps not surprisingly, flowers, specifically, juniper. Light mouthfeel with a mild bittersweet finish. Taste is very floral, with tons of juniper throughout the beer. Alcohol in this beer is cleverly hidden. It's aged on spruce gin barrels but you can't seem to find it. The beer is a little out of balance due to the heavy handed use of juniper, but it's still an enjoyable alternative to your normal every day fare. An interesting diversion."
"John John Ale 22oz bomber shared with Jim last night. Very nice appearance, cloudy orange/copper color with bubbly white head. Interesting floral aroma that must be the juniper berries. Taste is pleasant, spicy with some hops and pine. I was worried when I saw that it was aged in gin barrels but the gin flavor is a mild under taste that didn't bother me. Wasn't bad but nothing I would have again."
"not sure what's going on with this one. smells and tastes like a bucket of water with household cleaner thats been laying around for a couple of days. try for yourself, but i guarantee you wont want to try it again. also, ive read about people paying upwards of $9 for a 22 oz. bottle. i paid $6.49. pay no more..."
"Excellent head retention. This taste like slightly hoped pinot grigio aged in gin barrels. I like that it's different but one is plenty. It definitely has that super dry gin feeling towards the end."
"John John Ale (Spruce Gin Barrel Aged) is a semi-successful experiment if you have a thing for herbed/spiced beer. Rogue pulled it off better than most, but $8.99 for the bomber is not worth a second purchase."
"D: Interesting beer and very drinkable, the herbal character is kept at a good level where it's assertive but not over-bearing."
"It does go down well, although I really would have appreciated a bit more gin-like kick to this brew. Imagine this in an Imperial style..."
"D: This is a very good beer. The junipers they used to make this beer are very subtle and don't leap out at you. The aging makes for a very smooth taste. I like it a lot. Definitely would drink again."
"D - a very fine mix of hop qualities with the tart sweetness of juniper berries, and the light pine hint from the gin cask finishing is subtle but complimentary"
"D - not bad, considering the potential to go awry (aging an APA in Gin barrels? - kudos to Rogue for the cajones). actually a bit more refreshing and drinkable the deeper down the glass I go. going solo here, might go well with some sharp cheese or even slightly spicy Thai food."
"The only other juniper spiced beer I've had was the DIPA from Midnight Sun, and the juniper character there was both powerful and satisfying. None of that here."
"Poured with a nice golden to orange color and a head that lingered leaving a nice rim and lace on the glass. The smell was of herbs and grass, clean, maybe minty, it deffinatly hints towards the presence or affiliation with gin. The taste was light on hops and malty sweetness but had an unusual and never experienced bite at the end that was like that of gin, a dry-wetness lets say. The taste was unique and different and I like the idea of something that has bitterness appeal without being overly hopped. The color and the unusal taste were the best parts. I would drink this again."
"An elegant ""herbaceous"" drink. Pleasant. Likely very good with most food profiles."
"A very pale yellow color, clear with a fair white cover that thins out quickly and very thorough lacing. The aroma is intense but tasteful juniper biscuit. The flavor brings more of the juniper with a bright blueberry sweetness and an interesting vinegar tartness, almost rhubarb. Biscuit and wheat malt infused with juniper hop in a crisp light/medium bodied brew with a light, tingly feel. Quite drinkable and successful."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light and refreshing pale malt and juniper berry aroma. The gin barrels give off a nice character that works well with the tart fruit. The taste is decent. It has good malt and fruit flavor, however the gin barrel aging gives it an undesirable finish. It's bitter with a touch of sourness. I'm not a huge fan, but it's adventurous. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty unique beer with lots of complexity. The gin barrel aging leaves me on the fence with this one."
"Keep trying though Rogue has some amazing beers"
"D: Normally I'm not a big Rogue fan, but I do enjoy gin, so I wanted to try this. It was actually pretty nice, but not really worth what they are asking for it."
"Rogue Ales--Oregon Brewing Company--John John Ale--Pale Ale Brewed With Juniper Berries And Aged In Spruce Gin Barrels--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 5.01% ABV. 34 IBU's. (3.5 / 5.0) Big dense foamy rocky lacy off white head. Fizzy hazy bright orange gold color. Loose sediment. Light spruce hop juniper front. Mild sweet barrel aged wild fruit ester orange citrus subtle gin note Pale Ale body. Refreshing mild hop citrus end. Sampled 9/18/2010. 2 @ $7.99 Each Purchased @ The Ballard Market 9/11/2010. Overpriced!!"
"Ends bone dry and clean. A real palate cleanser. I enjoyed this one overall. I was hoping for more of a juniper and/or gin flavor. I would recommend this as a solid APA/IPA."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while if you're into the juniper flavor."
"I perhaps had slightly elevated expectations being a gin lover. I have yet to try Rogue's gin and it may be a very subtle distillation but knowing Rogue I would think not. Perhaps the gin barrels do not impart flavor as well as others but the juniper and lemon were so faint that this just became a fairly interesting pale ale. As I said, my expectations may have been high but at $9 a bottle and being barrel aged, perhaps they should be."
"I saw this one on a recent detour to Mondo Vino, and although I thought it was overpriced at $9/bomber, I hadn't seen it before, I wasn't sure if I would again, and gin barrel aging seemed unique and interesting. This was a nice fresh, somewhat hoppy pale ale, with loads of gin flavors (juniper, spruce) and a little wood. Quick, easy to drink and ultimately forgettable."
"The mouthfeel is a little dry, but overall very solid. Making this an interestingly drinkable odd brew."
"M&D - well blended and layered, a smooth beer, and easily sessionable, the juniper adds a delectable earthiness, nice brew"
"This beer is pleasant enough to drink and well-balanced but there's nothing to rave about. Maybe I was expecting a more assertive botanical or barrel-aged character."
"Taste is outstanding, balanced, and complex, very engaging, and, though full of flavour, is still fairly restrained. It is also slightly unusual in subtle ways. Firm, light malty base of lightly sweet grain, strong yeastiness (mostly pear, a faint hint of banana), definite herbal-spicey-woody hops, complex and hard to pin down exactly, although I can detect a light, but definite hint of juniper before the spicey-sweet finish. It has a long aftertaste. Feel is very solid, lively and engaging yet with faint, creamy oiliness. Drinkability to me is outstanding."
"While refreshing on a hot day, much like the other john john release, this doesnt quite meet expectations and is fairly middle of the road."
"Poured into a DFH snifter, pours a hazy yellow wiht a bit of head that stays the entire drink, no lace. Smell is pretty Saison to me, it does that that Belgium character to it, with maybe a hint of spruce to it. Taste was pretty bland up front with a slow alcohol waxy taste towards the back end with a wood herbal type finish. Overall I was expecting this to be much better, was a bit of a letdown for me."
"D: the brew drank very good and was really tasty to me since I do enjoy an occasional gin cocktail. I'm glad somebody got the balls to age a beer in gin barrel; good call."
"Not something to have all the time, but certainly a wonderful treat."
"Taste: nice beer. loved the gin and spruce flavors. not dominat at all. I might have to grab a bottle of this. nice"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Goes down pretty easy. I dig this stuff."
"Nothing great in the smell. The sip is piney IPA but then you do get the juicy bite of the juniper. It goes well with the piney IPA bite. The juniper is not sweet but tart, which goes with the bitter bite of the pine. Its different but not over the top great. I would have again, but its not something I NEED to have again. Would like to see this tweaked a bit."
"This is an excellent pale ale, although for what I paid for the bottle.... it will be an every once in a while indigence."
"I've been known to knock back a few gin drinks in my day, so John John Juniper certainly intrigued me. First, it has a great pale ale appearance, with a golden, yellow-orange color and a thick, foamy head. The aroma is a bit of a let down. I was expecting a strange combination of hops and herbs with all of the aromatic ingredients, but there just was not much there. The aroma was just grainy and a bit musty, with a hint of lemon. The flavor was certainly better, with a solid pale ale base of pine, earth, and lemon. The added botanicals seem to boost the pine characteristics, and the juniper adds a little something extra. Texturally, it is resinous and a bit boozy (from the barrel aging?), but also nicely carbonated and mouth-filling. Overall, it is a decent pale ale with a bit of intrigue, but the gin-barrel aging makes this one seem too boozy to want to go back for more. After all, it is never a good sign when you want to add tonic to your beer."
"Easy, almost too easy, to drink. Easily could have more than one."
"D: This was a bit of a disappointment but it was slightly refreshing and I appreciate the chance to try something different."
"This poured a hazy dark amber with some sediment and moderate off-white head. It smelled like honey and vanilla and green oak, with some heather or wild clover and wheat and a little sugary lemon. It tasted like green oak and citrus with honey and heather/clover, and a little banana nut bread. It was oily with a little carbonation, and had a mellow bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very interesting scent and taste. I really respect the beer's concept and execution, but the taste just wasn't overly enjoyable to me. I'm not generally a fan of oaked IPAs, and this barrel-aged maibock seems similar to me. However, it was a fairly clean beer with decent body, and was easy enough to drink. Nice experiment to drink once, but that's about it. (Now I'm curious to try Dead Guy whiskey.)"
"Overall an interesting concept that was fun to try but now that I've had it I don't know if I would order it again on it's own merits."
"Overall, I really liked this beer! I had trouble noticing the juniper flavors until I started slowing down my sips. It's gentle, as I suppose it should be, though admittedly I haven't had many beers with this characteristic."
"drinkability is very good - the light body and clean non overpowering flavors make this a perfect beer to drink on a hot summer day in the 90's"
"D: Not very offensive but just very underwhelming. Another good idea from a forward thinking brewery falls victim to a lack of refinement as certain ingrediants overpower and dominate the pale ale."
"Not a beer I'd want a lot of."
"Very good beer. Original flavor and feel that is definitely a ""high quality"" and well thought out recipe."
"Drinkability: it took a while to drink because the piney/ spruce taste was rather strong for a lighter beer, a beer worth checking out for the flavor."
"I can't think of any reason that I like this beer so much other than I just do. I doesn't really seem to stand out yet it stood out among among all the beers at beerfest. I like it."
"D - Would I buy this again? Probably. Definitely worth a try and offered some very unique flavours, making for an enjoyable and memorable experience. At $10/bottle it's a little pricey, but tasty nonetheless. What's with the mystery ABV?"
"the drinkability is fine, i like gin so it goes down easily enough. i was hoping for something else when i got this, and while it isn't bad at all, it's a little clumsy. glad it tried it though."
"d - I was not a fan of this beer at all. I didn't think there was much to the smell, but the gni really came out in the taste, which was unfortunate. Would not buy again."
"Light in color with an interesting aroma that comes from the good carbonation. Juniper flavor is subtle and the beer does not taste too strong, although I have no idea of the alcohol by volume. I'll have this again and would recommend it."
"Pours a light orange with nice head and lacing. Smell of the spurce immediately jumps out at me. It really does smell like Christmas. Taste seems to be much more mellow than the smell, and I find the carbonation a bit prickly. This beer could be an awesome air freshener, but I was a bit tired of drinking as I finished my glass."
"yellow body with a Fancy white head. Some carbonation. Spruce confers in aromas.Not a bad drinker, like the spruce and gin was OK. Then again, nothing special particularly the juniper taste.Low carbonation.A little spicey. Thanks for sending Presario."
"The regular ale is a little bland near the start and then the rush of fruit and weeds near the end throws you off balance. This is actually much firmer up front. It's still not very strong, and if anything the hop presence is, remarkably, even weaker, but there's a bigger profile of herbs. And since I'm not an herbalist I really lack the critical vocabulary to describe it, except for that there is indeed a little bit of pine. This moves into a maltier middle that's like a lemony EPA, and then it ends on a very nice, dry rush of pine and more generic herbs."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. I'm finding I like this beer a little bit better with each sip. I've had other juniper beers before which had much more juniper flavor, but this one manages to be good without an overpowering gin character."
"Pour mostly clear amber color with minimal head. Aroma is piney but mild. Flavor is more of the same. Mostly a one mote flavor profile for me, but what is there is decent. Well carbonated nut maybe just a bit thinner than is like on the palate. Glad I tried this one, but probably not something I would seek out again."
"A full body with a creamy mouthfeel. Very balanced beer. Nothing overpowers in it, and all the different flavors work very nicely with each other. It would be great to see more beers like this; it's a creative use of barrel aging to create a balanced, somewhat low ABV beer."
"Overall one of the worst I have had in a long time, will not be looking for this one again anytime soon."
"Drinkabilty is above average - it's interesting enough to want more, and finishes clean enough to keep from getting overwhelming"
"Drinkability: Good, meh."
"I appreciate the subtle nuances of the juniper, spruce, and gin in this beer but these are not bold enough. Part of the problem is the sweet/heavy texture that lacks dryness or crispness- these characteristics are why gin beverages are so great. Opportunity lost here."
"D - I was pretty happy with this overall, the flavor of alcohol makes it seem stronger than 5.2% which is what was listed on the tap menu. The pale is very drinkable and refreshing for a first pint, I would order this again if I see it -an interesting concept for a spiced pale ale."
"Finally, the drinkability rates higher than average but it's not a beer I'll be recommending unless someone's an IPA/gin lover. But better than I feared and another hit in the John John series."
"D - This beer is quite drinkable with a light herbal flavor and a well balanced malt richness that is quite similar to the standard version of Rogue's juniper pale ale. Much like the barrel aged dead guy, I don't think that this beer benefited greatly from its barrel aging. The prospect of Juniper pale ale aged in Gin barrels sounded extremely appealing, but the beer is not as boldly flavored as expected it to be. The herbal character is more complex than it is in the non barrel aged version of the beer, but the juniper seems relatively subdued with a ghostly woody character the only contribution that I can confidently trace to the barrel aging. I am glad I gave this beer a try, and some people might find more to like in it than I did, but in the end it didn't live up to my expectations."
"A unique beer, and definitely worth revisiting but not something I'd drink regularly."
"Gin barrel-aged beer? I'm up fer it! It pours a clear golden straw topped by a thick white froth. The nose comprises wet hay, spruce tips, pine sap, and floral hops. The taste holds notes of juniper berries and twigs, pine sap, grass, and a mild bitterness. Honestly, it seemed like some cheap gin was watered down and had hops added to it. And I wasn't all that impressed with it. The body is a light medium, with moderate carbonation and a dry finish, leading to a lingering of the taste for a bit too much time. An interesting brew, but, in my opinion, not all that great of one."
"Taste: Light toast with a slightly sour edge (maybe from the barrel?). Quite dry with a dark herbal undertone up front. The middle is even drier and quite bitter. There is a hint of juniper but its faint. Very bready as well as a little yeast. Comes off as quite think partly due to the low carbonation I think. The finish is the most like gin. A bit of a burn, quite dry and definitely a juniper bite."
"D - Interesting spiced ale with a fruity sweetness and potpourri of hop character. Flavor is nicely balanced and nothing is too overbearing in the flavor. Instead, the flavor is rather subtle and pleasant."
"It's slightly hazy orange, with a small white head. Nose is gentle juniper/spruce, with a bit of earthiness, like bark. Tiny bit of hops. Taste is some hops and peat (no juniper in the taste). Decent mouthfeel and drinkability. Could use more juniper flavor."
"doesnt really make for a great barrell aged but a ok beer overall"
"i could drink a bunch of these theyre not filling and have a pretty distinguishable taste this isnt a bad beer but i think rogue could have done better i wish the gin was more prominent and the juniper berries go totally unnoticed due to the spruce which takes over the whole beer."
"Overall, quite different and well worth trying."
"D- The alcohol content (whatever it may be) is not apparent. A unique beer."
"I'm kind of enthralled with the idea of throwing lower-ABV beers into barrels, especially those that once held gin. While John John isn't necessarily a masterwork, it's still plenty enjoyable. Worth a try, especially for the BAs who also enjoy a nice gin from time to time. I think I'm going to pour a little measure of Bombay Sapphire into my last glass here and see how it goes..."
"It is an easy beer to drink and not too strong. Something nice for a summer day but I was expecting more."
"D: All in all a drinkable beer that leaves you with a slight sour twang and coating on the tongue. Drinks like a saison, as crisp as a pale with a generous amount of hops to match, and has some berry spice appeal all rolled into one. Have to recheck my original evaluation of their juniper ale, but figure this one surely benefits from the spruce gin barrel aging which does this just fine. Worth a purchase."
"Parts of it I enjoy, but as a whole it doesn't seem to follow through for me, especially for the hefty price tag paid for it here in Alberta. Kudos to Rogue for the experiment, it makes sense to me, however the final product seems a bit one-dimensional. Refreshing, but one-dimensional."
"John John Juniper rates as above average in mouthfeel and drinkability for me. I wouldn't drink multiples of this. It is drying, to its benefit, but too subtle and spicy and sweet for me to love it. It reminds me of the John John Dead Guy Ale in that respect - love the concept but I'm iffy on the execution."
"D: A solid brew from Rogue. I wanted a little more barrel character as I love gin and juniper, but this is a solid pale ale with a hint of spirit."
"D: Good summer beer. Though I don't think I could do more than one bomber in a day. A very interesting brew, and a gin barrel beer I am glad I tried."
"Drinkability: Subtle and subdued, though pleasant enough for a pint. While not a leap forward it is certainly a step up from the unbearable inaugural beer from the John John set. But this gives me hope for the rest of the series. I'm ready for more. I feel ready!! What's next?"
"I'd be interested to see how much alcohol is in this, as this beer had both the taste and the warming effect that stronger beers and sprits have on me. I love it when the boundaries are pushed and even though this isn't spicy like a Pumpkin Ale, lovers of gin will be pleasantly surprised by what Rogue's pulled off here. There's certainly nothing else liket this on the market!"
"Overall, a lackluster and dissappointing brew. Doesn't deliver for a barrell aged beer. Nothing really stands out here either. Forgetable in my opinion."
"- Overall I am very impressed.... wish it were a painted bottle. This is one to have and try.... extremely balanced flavor... and quite refreshing on a warm muggy day."
"Pale and golden, pretty typical pale ale look. The aroma and flavor is lacking big time. There is very little going on in this beer period There might be a slight hint of juniper/hop bitterness on the back palate. Drinkability depends on if you want to spend a lot of money on an essentially bland beer. Other than that, I can't smell much and I don't taste much. What a sad, overpriced, waste of time. It is pretty clean though."
"This would be great with Thanksgiving dinner. I think I'll try to stow a few away..."
"The palate is dry and full of bitter and uniquely nuanced flavors. I don't know the abv. , but this is a session ale with conversation piece written all over it."
"M/D - Thin body goes well with the light herbal flavor. Very easy to drink, not sure how much I paid, I think around 6. Overall nice beer that could be a good session beer though it sounds like a lot went into it and probably wouldn't scale well."
"Picked this up from a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Hazy, yellow pour with nice big but quickly fading head and decent lacing. Disappointed that the nose was rather subdued. Bready, musty with just a hint of juniper. The flavor was also disappointing, or perhaps my expectations were a bit too high. I really loved the premise behind this beer and was hoping it would live up to the hype. The juniper is present, but barely, along with just a hint of gin. With that said it's an interesting and complex beer that gets better as your drinking it. Good balance, but over all I was expecting a much bolder taste. Good drinkability as it does grow on you. Although it was a bit disappointing, still a solid beer from a solid brewery."
"The body was about what you'd expect from a Pale Ale. Drinkability was nice but not special. Overall, a decent beer, worth a shot when you see it, just don't set your expectations too high."
"drinkability- nice hopped beer but really a miss on the style over hopped and not gonna satisfy someone looking for juniper, falls short on that aspect of which i expected, enjoyable but off style"
"D: Somebody suggested this might pair well with rosemary, and the web site suggests either pork or a hot and spicy dish. The juniper and spices in the beer definitely make it a nice beer to pair up with the right dish. Despite the spices, it's somewhat smooth and refreshing."
"D: Let me start by saying that I'm one of Rogue's biggest fans and I would gladly pay a few more $ for Rogue beer than most other beers because I feel that their beer is just better than most others. That being said...this beer is terrible, by far the worst beer that I've ever had from them. Maybe I got a bad bottle or something but I've never had a problem like that from Rogue before...everything has been very consistent in my opinion from them. This was $9 down the drain."
"I was worried this beer would be over the top with the Juniper, but the opposite was true. It was too understated."
"Flavor is, again...good...but nothing special. I was really hoping for more. Has a nice crisp and light mouthfeel. Initial flavor is a mixture of yeast, light berry, and again...a mild spice zest. Carbonation is high, which is right on for the style of beer. The warmer the beer gets, the more the flavor comes out...but overall, still slightly let down. I was really hoping for more of a booze flavor from the spruce gin barrels."
"Not being a huge fan of gin, it was nice to see that the gin barrel didn't have an overpowering effect on the base pale ale. The result is an approachable herb-influenced beer, interesting in its conception, but overall, still a bit too much like consuming forest undergrowth for me to want another."
"D: Despite being a barrel aged beer, this one is very easy to drink at a steady pace. It's quite tasty, and well worth trying. A bit high-priced for what it is, however."
"This drinks pretty well. This isn't much more than a regular pale ale to me. The barrel aging isn't that noticeable and if I wasn't told, I would think this was a pale ale with some juniper berries added in. It's a good brew, but probably not worth the price tag."
"Overall, this isnt' bad. The gin isn't overwhelming, nor the spruce, but both give it a clean quality. Not my thing, but good nonetheless"
"A decent stab at something different from Rogue. However, I can't get past the kink in the mouthfeel. Certainly worth a try either way."
"I'd describe this as a decent pale ale with a little added complexity. Warning to fellow gin lovers: the effect of the barrel aging is not huge, like you'd expect from most bourbon barrel aged beers, but you get plenty of the gin character if it's warm enough. Good beer for a change of pace and one would buy again."
"Drinkability is very good, but being fond of gin, I may be biased. I could see how this one might rub some people the wrong way. I was happy to find that the gin is more noticeable than the whiskey was with JJ Dead Guy."
