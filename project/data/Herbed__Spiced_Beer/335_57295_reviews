"O:  Looked good, smelled not so good, I found it to taste not so good as well.  good mouthfeel.  Overall, not very good.  It could be that I've never had good mole but at the same time I feel like this beer is underwhelming.  I love the crap out of Xocoveza and some other offerings of a similar nature but this beer is just sad in comparison.  the peppery flavor is there but nothing else supports it and the entire beer just seems to fall a little flat in the area of flavor."
"O: a distinct beer that is worth trying as long as you don't completely object to chilies in your ale.   Allowed to warm for about 15 minutes out of the refridgerator, it still improved with further warming."

"Found this to have too much yeast on the nose and palate. Mouth also feels way too thin and too bubbly for what the flavors are doing. Less than average but not awful. Would not try again."

"Popping the cap reveals a tart nose scented with a little ripe fruit just on the verge of getting too ripe and some reconstituted dried dark chilis. The beer pours ruby chestnut under a 1” white foam cap that dissipates to a quick film. The palate starts tart and fruity and then the Mexican chocolate flavors come forward and a dried chili flavor, possibly ancho, slight smoke, a green chili vegetal taste, a hint of coffee, a very light tartness suggesting vinegar and pickled green chili to finish with a touch of chili heat. Although the idea of the beer sounds outrageous, everything is restrained and very well balanced here, exquisitely layered and deliciously complex without getting too muddied. The beer contains a wide variety of flavors but allows each to speak for itself. The beer is very creamy with a medium full body and medium carbonation. The carbonation is smooth and not harsh."
""
"Mouthfeel is treacle-y with only minor notes of carbonation. Initial dominant chocolate swiftly fades into a subtle hint of toasty malts and a bit of coffee, with a rising tide of chiles that leaves the mouth warm and tingling and lasts long after the beer is swallowed, with notes of toffee or caramel blending in and creating a nigh-imperceptible herbal finish."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/11/2013. Pours crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, raisin, plum, pear, caramel, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, chili pepper, light coffee, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, raisin, plum, pear, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chili pepper, light coffee, herbal, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Slight pepper heat on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, raisin, plum, pear, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light coffee, light chili pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, complexity, and robustness of malt, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with light-moderate chili/coffee presence and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately slick and fairly smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good chili beer. Good balance, robustness, complexity of malt, yeast ester, and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Not sure if I would drink this beer again, since I think I would have liked it to be heavier and taste more of the chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Massively disappointed. Not sure I can finish it, and I NEVER dump beer. I can see where they were going for the mole, but it just did. not. work. Maybe this batch is different from past batches that were reviewed more positively?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It is better than ok, but the likelihood I would go out of my way to drink this one again is small, but decent beer from an awesome brewery."

"Overall – This was a very interesting brew. The mouthfeel, I must say, was done very well, nearly exactly what is right for the flavor profile. The flavor however, while overall it has nice individual components, all combined together it is not really something I found all that appealing. It was a very good one to give a try to, but nothing I would go back to again and again."
"Reddish brown pour had a small amount of fizzy carbonation, and formed a fleeting, and small head. The overall look was very similar to a glass of Coca Cola. The smell had a lot of cherry in it, along with the fruit were hints of chocolate. The taste showed off the chocolate a lot more than the smell. The dry fruit flavors (prune, raisins, dried cherries) were also there, and the chiles showed up strongest in the finish. Lots of complexity here, along with similarity to the Mexican sauce this beer was named after. Very soft in the mouth, with a velvety texture. Looking at the other reviews, this beer seems to me underrated to me."

""
""

""
""
"There's lots of smoothness with only a little crispness, but unvarying. It leans on the light side in the medium body. It's semi-sweet the whole way through, almost breaking toward semi-dry in the finish."
""
""
""
"Okay, I guess that this beer reminds me slightly of a mole, but only because there are both chile and chocolate notes, but beyond that there is not much to evoke the complexity and depth a of a mole- far too thin and one-note (okay, two note). The chile heat is at the right level, but the chocolate is thin and watery, and there is no solid malt background to support anything, and no other spice notes to play off of the chile and chocolates. A nice idea for a beer, but needs some retooling."
""
""
""
"O: I made the mistake of taking a couple too-large sips, and it wasn't pleasant, with all the sweetness and booze, but treat it properly and there are rewards to be had. I'll keep my Theobroma, but this is just fine."

"Not a bad chili beer with the pepper only being a mild component to a big malty old ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: El Mole Ocho is a unique experience. It is the most complex chili beer that I have ever had and I think I prefer it to Theobroma for its big and bold flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What a bust. This beer falls into the steer clear category. If you're looking for something spicy and chocolatey, you won't find it here."
""
"Really digging on this beer. Daring flavors, velvety texture, great balance, and unique. My one complaint is that I would like more chile heat. But that's just nitpicking"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very interesting and like nothing I've ever had before. My only real gripe is the lack of hop balance. Putting some bitter sweet hops in there to mix with the chocolate and coco flavors would have put this beer over the top."
""
""
""
""
"overall - too much for one person - hard to drink the full 22 oz. maybe better as a smaller size."
""
"M: Good taste and aftertaste. Warming and inviting."
""
""
"Pours a brownish-copper with a half finger of head the dissipated quickly. There is a faint touch of malt in the nose, that is all. A bit sour upfront combined with light chilli pepper heat on the finish. A nice effort, but finishing this offering was a tad difficult."
""
""
"O: Interesting, but the aroma was quite unpleasant, and the taste wasn't much better. Not something I would try again, especially at this age."
""
"O - I guess the only thing I have to really compare this to is NB Cocoa Mole, which was excellent and much sweeter. This does a better job matching the flavor, but isn't as good of a beer to drink."
"Would love to try this fresh I believe this would be a different beer. Interesting but nothing great in its current state..."
""
"This enjoyable beer does a great job of reminding me of the flavors I taste in the first couple of bites of a mole sauces. This is a rich complex beer with that strikes a balance between the ingredients of cocoa, chile pepper, coffee and malt characteristics bringing those flavors together and makes them play nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I may revisit again since it was one of the best beers I had by New Holland. Even better than the 2011 vintage of Dragons Milk. Worth trying if you like Mexican mole."
""
""
"3.5 D: I'm a sucker for these types of brews. This is a good one, but better ones exist. Still, worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"O: I have had a few spiced ales, some of which I have immensily enjoyed, others that I found to be complete flops. The more I drank of New Holland's El Mole Ocho the more I liked it. I feel that a good spiced ale can often serve as an excellent after dinner beer. However, this beer's more subdued, balanced, less syrupy nature makes it more fit to pair with a dish of spicy pulled pork or Mexican fare."
"Interesting brew. Fruity pepper flavor dominated and was nicely accompanied by sweet chocolate and cinnamon. Wouldn't want a whole bomber, though."
""
""
""
"My first chile beer. Had this on draft at Ashley's in Ann Arbor. Pours reddish brown with small white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of some chile peppers, tobasco, and a bit of malt sweetness. Taste is not pleasant. Tobasco sauce mixed with a mediocre amber ale, rather thick and sweet. But overall the chile overpowers. Really funky. Gave it a chance and drank most of the pint, but I got physically ill after drinking half of this one."
"O: Wanting more chocolate and chili like a true Oaxacan mole. Interesting, but once is enough."
""
""
"D: Neat idea – very interesting and sort of “daring do” to try on a commercial endeavor. And they pull it off reasonably well. It has a pretty simple malt profile, but with enough umph to frame the beer well. And even aged it has a nice level of chili heat and a bit of flavor. I imagine it was more forward and bold when fresh, but even nearly a year old it is pretty good. A well done chili beer."
""
""
""
"Clearly a sipper here, one to savor. I'd suggest to cook and pair food obviously, even on its own it will garner some conversation. Long live extreme beer!!"
""
""
"Drinkability suffers from the hot alcohol notes and the disappointing mouthfeel."
"This is the 2010 Vintage and I'm thinking it definitely helped the taste and flavor and subdued the sweet notes. After I pooped the cap, it said 'malty' on the inside. Quite fitting indeed."
""
"O - I like the idea of a mole beer, but this didn't really do it for me. Too sweet, and not balanced enough."
""
"Pours a dark brown with a thin sliver of an off white head. Minimal lacing on the side of my snifter. A reddish tinge when held up to the light. The nose is nice- cocoa, chocolate, malt, caramel and chili. Very balanced, and very pleasant. The taste is similar to the nose profile, but the cocoa and chili really come through. Not quite as good as the nose, but still good. None of the 8% abv comes through. Feel is medium w/ little carbonation, and a little heat from the chili. I'd like a little more malt body in the feel. Overall, a good brew that has a couple flaws. Still, glad I got to try it. Cheers."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Not a favorite, but not a bad effort either."
""
""
"I like that the 8.4% (that's what is says on this bottle, 2011 vintage) props up the chili heat, with neither facet overdoing it. This is a different and enjoyable beer that is more subtle than you might expect, and exhibits way more balance than most beers made with chili. Unique and enjoyable all the way."
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting... it's a nice ""warmer", and it certainly qualifies as a sipper along with a good book, but I really do feel they're correct in stating that this would go well with food - not too much, mind you, but enough to pair and/or contrast the flavors. Or you can enjoy it on its own. Nicely done. Worth trying."
""
""
"Interesting...tastes a bit like a tripel mixed with a chocolate bock with maybe a cinnamon disk thrown in. I like the smell, but the flavor doesnt really come together all that well for me. I could go with a bit more sweetness and less chile."
""
""
"Poured translucent brown with a minimal light brown head that left no lacing. Smell was lightly cocoa and mildly roasted malts. Taste was more or less a lightly carbonated chocolate with some lactose like elements. Maybe the best description is mildly carbonated chocolate cola that you used to be able to buy at Hy Vee stores in Iowa in the 80's. The body was a bit light. There may be a very mild spice that appears ..several.. minutes into the beverage. Noticeable mildly when exhaling. Overall..it's really nothing like the bottle would suggest. It's fairly light, very very mild spiced, mostly mildly chocolate beverge."

"I think this is a must-try for any fan of southwestern food (mole sauce in particular) or experimental brews."

"drinkability: love pepper beers, this was a slight disappointment, good flavor, but needed more body."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer, I was a little gun shy about pepper beers ever since I tried Original C Cave Creek Chili Beer but this beer wasn't nearly as spicy while still retaining a nice authentic chili pepper taste and the chocolate was dark, rich and represented well, those two different flavors went together pretty well. This beer had pretty good drinkability for what it is, the 8% alcohol was covered up pretty well by the chocolate and slightly warming chili's, I don't think I could take out the whole bomber but it's the perfect amount to split with someone else so I am glad I got my brother to help me drink this. What I liked most about this beer the flavor, the chocolate and chili's went together nicely and it wasn't overly spicy, pretty good balance. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad but it was little sticky and the carbonation was pretty low and could have been bumped up a couple notches. I wouldn't buy this beer regularly but it makes for a nice once in a while beer and I can only imagine that this beer would go good with some nice Mexican cuisine, I will have to test that out sometime. I would recommend giving this beer a try, don't let the fact that there are chili's in it scare you off, they offer a lot more flavor then heat and this might make a good entrance into the Chili Beer style. I am starting to really like some of New Holland's more experimental beers, they got a good knack at trying something a little different, so I think they should take more risks on more different beers like this one. So far this is the best beer I have had from the High Gravity Series, and the best chili beer I have had to date. Keep thinking out of the box every once in a while New Holland, you guys got some talent when it comes to some of these crazier beers."
"Upfront it delivers some nice chocolate flavor, and then hoppiness that feels out of place for this beer. The aftertaste is ok though, I got a sense of the chilis at the end. Average beer overall."
"This beer was awful and I dumped out 3/4 of the bottle. Avoid."
"Rather fascinating overall if quite a bit cloying; not sure though that this cloying aspect could be improved without tampering with the subtle flavor and aroma profile."
"El Mole Ocho was poured from a bottle to a pint glass with little head. The aroma was immediate. Cinnamon and chocolate hints tickled the nose. An interesting reddish color attracted the eyes to this ale. Those dark like a stout, the mouthfeel yielded more to the feeling of an ale. The initial taste was that of chocolate and certain spiciness that brought back memories of those tiny heart-shaped cinnamon candies of Valentine's day. It was a spicy cinnamon. The spice lingers in the aftertaste moreso that the chocolate. This was the one disappointment in the experience."
"O: Not good and really not much different than an English Brown."
"O- This is an awesome example of what a pepper beer can be. It brings a great flavor with gentle heat. It's not neutered, but not over the top either. It's VERY drinkable considering the ABV and chilli profile."
"I really enjoyed this beer but it was lacking in a few key areas. This could be so much better if it was a little more assertive and less ""user friendly."""
"O: I would have liked more flavor from the peppers and not just heat."
"You want a brew with heat? Forget about this and seek out CCB's Hunahpu or Mikkeller's Texas Ranger."
"I'm not sure who drinks this beer, but more power to them if they enjoy it."
"O - Not a great beer, and I paid way too much for it at the bar because I was drunk. It's okay, but there's better examples of the ""style."""
"If you're looking for something ""different," give this one a try!"
"D: This was an interesting beer with well integrated molé characteristics to create a spicy brown ale. I enjoyed the scent and taste, and the body was nice too. The spice helped hide the alcohol, so it was pretty easy to drink. A bit of a novelty beer, but recommended to try at least once."
"O: A very unique beer and while it's good, it's also very simple. True to its name, it tastes like a mole sauce somehow turned into a beer. I enjoyed it, but at nearly $9 for a bomber, I probably won't be seeking it out again."
"Overall: A good beer. A little on the sour side, and I'm not really a spiced-beer person (I prefer spiced wine to spiced beer), but I would certainly recommend it to those who were."
"This beer pours a clear dark brown color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes quickly into no lacing. This lacing pattern seems par for the course with chili beers. The aroma is of chili peppers, with a backing of cocoa, and a hint of coffee. However, for an 8% beer it is rather mild. The taste has considerably more cocoa and coffee than the aroma, with the chili present not overpowering anything during the sip. It comes out stronger in the finish, and leaves some nice, wanted heat. I really like this beers flavor. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a very well done beer that I will certainly drink again. I really like how the chili is well integrated into the other aspects of this beer."
"Overall: A solid beer that must be tried, by no means a go-to beer but something different for a different experience. Try this with a spicy (chilli like) meal and you won't be dissaointed."
"Would not recommend, especially at this price."
"Overall, this is a pretty nice beer. The chili borders on a bit too much, but never quite crosses the line. It's something that's worth drinking once in a while, but probably too ... something, maybe one-dimensional, maybe distinctive ... to drink regularly."
"Taste-Sweet malt, faint coffee,chocolate note, faint chili pepper. Pretty thin bodied, with subdued, if not weak, flavors. More of everything is needed here except the sweetness which borders on cloying. Disappointing."
"D - I was excited to try this but fairly disappointed."
"O: not great. I liked it, but was glad I didn't have a large bottle of it. Probably won't order again just due to opportunity cost - there are so many better beers, even though this one is a good spiced beer."
"O- one of the more interesting beers ive had in recent memory. it took a large percentage of the bottle to determine if i liked it or now. im still kind of on the fence about it. its almost like a chocolate chili stout. id try it again. id really get excited about having a fresh one to compare it to."
"While not a bad beer, I expected a bit more of an exotic note. Nice dark brown color and roasted malt flavor with a pronounced coco nibs and unsweetened chocolate powder aspect - slightly astringent and drying at the finish. I was unable to detect any pepper flavors to speak of. While the unsweetened chocolate notes were appropriate for a mole-inspired beer, it was overall fairly one-dimensional."
"Simply: bizarre. Chiles in a bottle, possibly mixed with beer characteristics. Not bad, but not really beer. Bizarre."
"Aroma is strong with an overtone of quality coffee and hints of cocoa, cinnamon and licorice. It pours a luscious semi-transparent mahogany brown with an average light tan head that leaves a fair amount of lacing. Flavor is malty with tones of coffee, cinnamon, caramel and licorice and a hint of powdery chocolate. Texture is smooth as soymilk yet has a firm tingle and a bit of edginess, as well as a subtle alcohol bite. Worthy!"
"What happened to the first seven mole beers?"
"Interesting beer! Thanks, Joel!"
"drinks okay. with a little fine-tuning of the flavor mix, this could be a very good, unique brew. pretty good as is."
"Feels medium to full in body, a little dry to the palate, and warms with a finish from the chili and alcohol."
"D - This is a very interesting beer, and I'd say that it is pretty drinkable. It goes down quite easy. I was honestly hoping for a more peppery bite and stronger chocolate notes, but oh well. This is definitely a beer worth trying."
"Pours a reddish brown topped by thin off-white head. I smell dark fruit, earth, maybe some caramel and some roasted malts.l The taste reveals some chocolate, fig, roasted malts, little hops. Medium to full body with good carbonation. Not terrible considering I don't taste mole (mole-ay not mole) but this isn't very drinkable. Super interesting try though."
"D: One glass is good."
"I did not find this very drinkable. The third bad beer of the night at Bodega last Friday. Thank god for half off happy hour..."
"Pours a moderately-dark amber color with a thin head. Nose brings some light chipotle peppers and a bit of might smoke. The taste is dried chili peppers, smoke, and a little roast. Light heat comes through. Interesting, but not all that tasty."
"D - This beer is one-dimensional based around a smoky chipotle pepper smell and taste. There really are no other characteristics that break past that one. Interesting but disappointing."
"D: Interesting for sure, but I really didn't like it. I almost didn't want to review it."
"Drinkability - interesting but not as good as I hoped it'd be. Could use more malt presence."
"Your usual brown ale sort of beer-soft coppery color. Aroma is a mild mix of cocoa/jalapeno and somewhat boozy. A fair amount going on here though somewhat muted. Mildly sour upfront. Lingering flavors of cocoa and chiles. Very prevelent honey like sweetness. Nice mouthfeel-quite smooth. Quite an interesting beer but the overall sweetness and melange of flavors can be a bit much. Sure it is good enough, but lacks a bit in the overall drinkability."
"Tasted from bottle purchased at Lush West Town. Pours dark clear amber with a smallish white head that leaves some lace on the outside of the glass. Aroma is green jalapeno, bitter chocolate, and a lot of coffee. This is a very unique beer. Flavor starts of with some sweetness and cocoa and moves to jalapeno and then bitter coffee. All of these flavors are very well balanced to create a very unique and delicious beer. The body is fairly heavy and coating with pretty light carbonation and a long finish that is both spicy (jalapeno), and bitter (coffee)."
"I think Ill pick this up again if I find it. New Holland is a very solid brewery."
"D: None of the three of us could finish our split due to the strangeness of the taste. It just became too overpowering(?)."
"D. Drinkable. Not my favorite beer by any means, but this is pretty unqiue in a good way. Taste takes on some of the more bitter dark chocoalate flavors, which some might prefer. Personally I like the sweeter chocolate flavors in beer."
"Decent mouthfeel, decent drinkability. Not fantastic, but worth a try."
"Pretty drinkable once you get past the in-your-face alcohol smell. I'd had this on tap before and it was served too cold. I recommend allowing it to warm before drinking."
"Mouthfeel is a little thinner than what I expected as well. There is still a strong medium body that has a malty stickiness. This is a subtle beer. The spices are not overwhelming. I would like to cook with this beer. I bet it would make a great base for a mole sauce."
"D= Very drinkable despite the unusual ingredients. This I believe is accomplished through the brewer's avoidance of a heavy hand with these flavors. Nicely done!"
"Notes: Nice ale pivoting on its mole character... If one likes that touch this is certainly quite the brew. The nose is a bit of a letdown but flavor and the overall experience of brew pick it up entirely."
"Tried this at Savor 2010. Poured a mahogany color, with a thin off-white head, poor retention, and decent lacing. Smelled of chocolate, caramel, and earthiness, as well as pepper and other spices. Certainly tasted of cocoa powder mixed with leaves, with a spicy backbone that led to a peppery, lingering finish. Not as thick as I had expected this to be, but still full-bodied nonetheless, with modest carbonation. Decent spicy beer, but too unique to drink on its own; definitely needs to be paired with some suitably spicy chow."
"my, what a curious beverage. i imagine some think it's a wash, but i find it a great project"
"drinkability: ok"
"New Holland continues its streak of 'hit and miss' with El Mole Ocho. This one's more of a 'miss' in my book. The overall flavor's alright, but that might be a little generous. It's somewhat boozy, and the flavor gets old somewhat quick. I guess it's worth a try if you're interested, but that's about as far as I can go."
"A: Decent layer of head, deep amber with heavy reds in the beer - 3.50, S: Smells strongly like barbeque chicken, very spicy, lots of chocolate as well as some dark pitted fruits such as plums, I also pick up a slight dark sweetness like raisins or molasses - 3.00, T: Noticeable alcohol burn, dates and figs as well as some chocolate dipped raisins, slightly syrupy, chilies provide a mild prickle on the tongue but it is certainly not a strong flavor, the flavor profile seems to skirt the edges of scotch ale to chili beer - 3.00, M: Medium bodied and somewhat silky - 3.50, D: I really like the concept of this beer, and it is drinkable but it just didn't click with my palate, certainly worth a try - 3.00"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a tulip glass an almost opaque black that shows ruby highlights when held to light. The beer is topped with a thin khaki head. Aroma is slight roasted malts, not much else. The taste is sharp chilies in front of dark malts and cocoa. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with mild corporation. This is certainly an interesting beer, one I'd love to have again."
"I'm not sure of the translation, so I'm gonna go with ""the chocolate eight"". Something like that. It pours a pretty much clear ruby brown topped by a short-lived finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose is a lambast of burnt cocoa, backed by a strange melange of toasted caramel, roasted marshmallows, and nicely seered salmon. Something here just doesn't seem right. The taste echoes a bit, starting with some burnt gingerbread and overdone banana bread, followed by some caramelized sugars, mole sauce (just as advertised, I guess), and a finish of smoked nutmeg, coffee, dark chocolate, and cinnamon. I have no idea what to think. It's sorta good and sorta horrible. Wow. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a strangely dry and almost sticky finish. I like the idea behind this, I suppose, but the execution was thoroughly botched. It's almost drinkable, but not very. worth a try if for nothing else than bragging about the experience (and ticking, of course)."
" D- The nougaty flavors really overpower everything with they become more offensive when it warms. It started out as an interesting beer but by the second glass I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Novel concept but I just don't think it translated from paper to bottle."
"D: Decent, but I wasn't as impressed as I expected. Great Divide's Chocolate Yeti is the way to go instead of this beer."
"El Mole Ocho reminds me a lot of Theobroma but with a sweeter, more simplified maltiness thus allowing for greater separation from the chili and spice additions."
"Coffee colored with a creamy, mocha head that leaves some lace on the glass. Dark chocolate and fresh roasted coffee in the aroma with some chile spice notes. Honey, dark chocolate and warm spice with a coffee like bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden. Smooth with high carbonation. A really nice and different brew."
"The beer pours a clear red-amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is heavy on the peppers with some earth, dirt and caramel malts. The flavor is fresh green peppers (jalapenos or serranos) with some coffee, chocolate, caramel and earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. The overall flavor of this beer is kind of a mess, but I liked it. Definitely an interesting idea from the brewers at New Holland."
"This is an interesting sipping beer that is best shared with open minded and palated drinking companions."
"D-Good beer (my fault I picked a hot day to drink this), nice balance between malty and chocolate. As I said earlier, this could use more heat. Otherwise it is just chocolate. Still very nice otherwise"
"Another quality brew from New Holland; worth trying for sure."
"Overall my best summary of this would be a double Vienna lager maltiness meets the fruitiness and alcohol content of a double bock meets the spicy twang of a chili beer (think rogue chipotle). Definitly doesnt drink like your typical herb/spiced beer which is a good thing."
"D- A unique beer that drinks fairly well. A bit sweet, but unique enough to be memorable."
"Overall different and worth trying."
"Quite an interesting beer, not sure I've ever had anything similar. The aroma is very earthy like combination of bread and malts but the taste is very different from the aroma. taste has hints of Mexican Chile and Cayenne peppers but blends it with a lingering citrus flavor that balances out and ameliorates the spiciness so you get a smooth pleasant taste that lingers. Goes down very smooth especially for a big beer. Could drink this all night and not tire of it if it weren't for its big alcohol."
"Pretty good. Pretty much like they say except there's a notable mineral characteristic. Poured with a nice off white head and lots of lace. Color is a clear mahoganey. Aroma is cocoa malt mineral and a little ripe dark fruit. Flavor is like nose but a hint of the spice added, but not as much as expected. Body is good and ditto carbonation. Finish is decent and of medium lenght."
"Close to a half finger of dark tan color, the bubbles don't seem that loosely knit but the head's gone in a few seconds, there is a little stickiness to the lacing though. Curiously, while the liquid is actually fairly clear, the grimy reddish-brown color more reminiscent of clay-based mud, more zinc orange hues brighten the rims. Huge jelly roll of milk chocolate, caramel and toffee dominates the nose, that said, cumin, paprika spices present along with a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper, these elements occluded by bodacious prune, plum, black grape, raisin, black cherry fruit scents, if you have the patience you might be able to get some charcoal dust and peat moss, overall the nose gets the ""truth in advertising"" award vis-à-vis the label. Full-bodied and close to heavy, the sheer mass of it pushes the carbonation off the tongue and outwards towards your cheeks. Oodles and oodles of chocolate, accompanied by butterscotch and caramel, could be sold in the candy aisle as much as the beer aisle. The ""Mexican spiciness"" gets sort of lost in the shuffle here, if anything more heat than flavor. Focus teases out orange citrus, granola and scone notes. This is a very enjoyable ""sipper"" that does not deviate much from the script, arguably for the best."
"d - An ok spiced beer. Wasn't a big fan of the smell but the taste was interesting. Probably wouldn't seek out again."
"An interesting beer that I'd try again."
"MF/D: Good feel to it, medium in body with a little viscosity, creamy going down. Sourness is a little distracting. Not sure if I will re-visit this one."
"Bottle at Mondiale 2010. Cloudy brown, with a little beige head, lacey. Some sourness, big mocha taste more than coffee. Good taste, would have liked even bolder chile flavour. Lots of lace drops. Above average mouthfeel. Not much aroma. Hidden a.b.v. Decent drinkability."
"Dark coppery-brown in color, with a small tan head. Smell has that mole aroma you would expect from the name - pepper, chocolate & other spices. Also picking up some estery-ness that I would associate with belgian yeast. Flavor is chocolate and a bit of steely flavor, coupled with peppery-heat bite on the finish. Creamy in texture. Not bad drinkability, despite its high ABV. An interesting and flavorful experience."
"I quite liked it. Something to really sit back with and explore. Doppelbock meets English Barleywine spiced with milding chili peppers. New Holland has a winner here with its High Gravity Series. Looking forward to seeing what's next in this series..."
"Really quite interesting and worth trying."
"bought a bottle of this in Kentucky after trying it on draught at the Party Store. aroma has chilis and nuttiness, actually aroma smells like it is a sour. pours with a nice light brown head. nice dark brownish red in color taste is very interesting. Can't say I dont like it. It is very good. Not anything like I was imagining. Very smooth, very very smooth. taste of nuts and a hint of chocolate and coffee. has a wee bit of chili heat at the finish. Chili spice becomes more pronounced as it warms. I really like this. way to go new holland, way to push to somethign new, and come out so well!"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clearish ruby red/brown color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both low. Aroma is nice, but light. The beer smells like chocolate, cherries, and some chilies. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a bit of coffee and raisins. The spice gets slightly stronger as the beer warms, but even then the spice flavor isn't really strong. I don't think the flavors mesh together very well, for whatever reason I just don't care for the taste of this brew. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating but also seems thin at times. Drinkability is decent, it's smooth and not hard to drink at all. I don't think this is a bad beer, but I didn't exactly think it was good either. It's worth trying once, but I don't think I'd buy this again."
"Overall this is an interesting concept but unfortunately I didn't think the flavors were quite crisp enough to completely pull it off. Still, it's worth a shot to see for yourself."
"It's a bit refreshing to sampler a beer that is ""flavor-oriented"" and have it still taste like beer, with beer traits encompassing the intended flavor profile, and leaving the spices and adjuncts as auxiliary. This isn't marinade, it's still beer. And delicious beer. Maybe New Holland can send a rep to Southern Tier to show them how something like this can be pulled off deftly."
"I had this on tap at Bad Apple. A dark amber color but very clear with a tan head, kind of watery, not much retention or lacing...The aroma is nice and balanced with smoke and spice, really makes me hungry. The taste doesn't really live up to the aroma, but its ok. Gives you the smoke and spice, but a little too spicy for me. Light feel, not a beer you can drink a ton of."
"Very rich amber colored beer. It has an extremely present smell. It smells like nothing else I have ever drank. Rich, chocolate, spicy malt scent. The taste is solid with a rich malt strength and a bit of hop astringency. The taste doesn't really linger nor is it that complex with the aftertaste. It is a delicious beer with a unique taste. The beer is too flavorful to drink more than a few of these. Share it with a friend. Drink it. Enjoy it. Have fun. I would if I were you."
"Drinkability would be good if it had a better flavor."
"D: It is a very interesting and complex beer, but it doesn't agree with my taste. One and done."
"I am usually not this negative in my reviews, so I will end with a positive. I am happy that New Holland is doing some interesting experimental beers and I am glad to have tried this particular beer to see how it turned out."
"22oz. brown bomber served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Poured a clear reddish brown with a finger of tan head. Aroma of chocolate, green pepper and chiles. Medium bodied. More chile peppers and chocolate in the flavor. Some vegetal green pepper. Bit of heat in the finish. Interesting beer, but a 12oz bottle would have been enough. Worth trying."
"5/7/2010"
"Poured into a .5 liter stein a brilliant garnet with a fluffy one finger off white head that settles into a creamy mass atop.The aromas are a mix of earth,bitter chocolate,and ripe chili's,not much sweetness is present.I have to say the flavors grew on me,at first I thought it to be a bit one sided in its roasty,drier tones, but after awhile the roasted chili flavor mixed with the bitter chocolate seemed to meld together better,the chili flavor really comes thru in the finish.Its different and thats a good thing here,it takes some adjusting to but its pretty good."
"This is an interesting beer with a nice mix of flavors. Worth trying."
"d: I bought this for novelty purposes not expecting to think much of it. What a pleasant surprise! Still, I'm glad I had help with the bomber. 22 ounces would have been a bit much."
"The color is a combination of brown, garnet, and a touch of orange...no haze in this one. I was really expecting something a little more substantial. You can smell a subtle pepper aroma but with the chocolate it comes across as a bit of chipotle pepper. As one who enjoys all things hot, this had less heat than I was hoping for. However, the subtle warmth left in the mouth was very tasty. The cocoa was there on the front, but I'd have like it to be a little more prominent. This had some great characteristics, but it was just a little toned down for me."
"I do kind of like this beer, but only for the sake of having tried it in its uniqueness and perhaps creativity. I do not, however, find it very drinkable, as it is a little too heavy and the flavors trend on the rich and out of the norm. Like mole, it's not for everyone, but unique and worth its existence in the world."
"interesting but not necessarily good. I won't be hunting this one down again anytime soon."
"I picked up a bottle of this while we in the area and I'm interested to see how it compares. I think that the cask conditioning might have actually hindered this some, as it seemed to mute the flavors a bit and showed a little more alcohol than I would have expected. Interesting stuff that I'm willing to give a second try."
"This is not a very enjoyable drink. I don't want any more after splitting the bomber."
"D: Not exactly a beer you'd want a lot of -- I think it might work with some smoky cheese or perhaps a pepper crusted steak?"
"D- I found this beer to be really drinkable in the long run. I will buy some more of this just to see how some age will treat it."
"Drinkability suffered from the finish, with the heat of the alcohol and the heat of the peppery quality - neither was particularly strong, but they didn't pull me back for another sip. Interesting, no doubt, and worth seeking out if you want something really different. I'd just recommend splitting one about 2-3 ways."
"All in all, this brew is not worth hunting down. You can try if you have access and enjoy some good sours, but otherwise avoid."
"D: this one is crazy and unique. I have only had mole a few times, but I would say this beer pulls off the flavor as good as a beer could. I enjoy the flavor combination but the sweetness gets intense after a while."
"drinkability - not good - a few sips were plenty for me - sink got the rest"
"Taste: Dried peppers definitely coming through. Still kinda fruity, but not dominant like in the smell. Finishes fairly dry."
"Mouthfeel is moderate-to-thick, and the spice gives this a bit of a stinging sensation on the tongue. Overall I find this a quite decent beer, maybe not made exactly to my tastes (I'd like a bit more chocolate here, giving this a more stout-like character), but it's almost certainly the beer that the good folks at New Holland wanted to make."
"Decent drinkability. The sweet aspect knocks it down a notch or two; otherwise this is an interesting and tasty beer."
"M&D: This brew is a bit big for it's style. Thick and full-bodied. It's not meant to be sipped by itself. Definitely a food beer. It's very good, but needs something to go with it."
"Taste is deliciously balanced - rum raisins and molasses with cocoa, chile pepper, and sticky toffee. Sweet and sticky, this is a really enjoyable quaff alongside Small Bar's terrific chili."
"Drinkability: More than a sipper, but too many flavors to go down easy. I can't imagine drinking anything before or after this, seems to overwhelm any prior tastes and wrecks the palate for anything subtle after. Delicious, complex beer that has it's time and place."
"Taste starts with a peppery kick. Caramel and milk chocolate notes follow. Spicy pepper stays as cantaloupe, candied banana, and figs provide a little muted sweetness. Smoky throughout. Finish is a nice mix of peppery spice, chocolate, and fruit. Medium-full body with a slightly sticky feel. A very interesting beer, but not one I would drink very often."
