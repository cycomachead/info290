3.08,-9.9,3,3,3.25,2.75,3,"Not nearly as bad as most would think. Scoff if you must but here's the real skinny (from my perspective) on this.  First off, the pour was average at least with a very nice color to both the beer and the head (opaque and black with brown tinges; head slightly off white) but the head does dissipate rather quickly leaving some, not a lot but some lacing. Nose was full of chocolate more than anything else. Not an overbearing fragrance but not any where near dismissible by any account. Taste followed nose exactly, only giving way to a hint of spice, dash of berries (muted at best but still there as a characteristic of the malt used, I would guess - think ""Baltic Porter"" backbone) and a touch of bitterness. More sweet than bitter and cloyingly so. Usually I would be far more rough on a beer of this depth for being watery thin but I fear that if it had much more body, the additional volume plus sweetness could have made it difficult to finish.  My biggest complaint for this beer (and ultimately what rode the rating down) was the near terminal lack of balance. This was all over the road without actually going into the ditch.","gopens44","Feb 17, 2015"

Powdered cocoa and cola sweetness in the nose, with a smoky beef jerky aroma. This is an unusual animal. The flavor imparts cocoa, Jordan almonds, a touch of vanilla extract, and odd hints of teriyaki.  A tart fruity tang blends with ashy burnt malts and an artificial liquid smoke char. The body is medium-thin with lively carbonation. This beer feels a little hollow. It's a curious blend of attributes that is mildly pleasing to the palate, but strange nonetheless. I'm not really sure what they were going for here. This one belongs in the same realm as their Honey Bourbon Cask Wheat. It's just a weird combination of natural and artificial flavors that doesn't manage to produce a coherent result.

Man, it was so sugary that my heart began pounding after the first sip. It was chocolaty, but in an odd, artificial way. I kept thinking of chocolate marshmallows, like in Count Chocula. Finish was likewise sweet and unrelenting. It was not a taste that I really felt that I needed to have in my later life. I am sure that I am not the intended audience, but this would be better left for someone whose tastes are sweeter than mine.","woodychandler","Dec 23, 2014"

The odor is definitely a mix of chocolate and wheat, and while it works perfectly on the tongue, not so much so in the nose.  Feel-wise, I have to say, this is the smoothest beer I've had in a long time - the darn drink just slips and slides inside your mouth finding its way to your throat real fast.

And an excellent holiday beer as well, although I think the sweetness really cuts it's drinkability down to one, or perhaps two for those with a bit of a sweet-tooth. Interestingly enough, I believe that this is the exact same beer as the Chocolate Wheat, but with a different label for release in winter.","NeroFiddled","Nov 23, 2014"

The yeast is relatively clean with a hint of toasted malt and subtle caramel toward the middle. The flavor has a hint of dark fruit as it warms. Overall this is a decent wheat pretty much standard with some mild cocoa flavors -not bad, but not a beer I would drink more than 1 of either.","Slatetank","Nov 02, 2014"
