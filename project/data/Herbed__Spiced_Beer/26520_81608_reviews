"The feel of this beer is light to medium bodied and has a really smooth drinkable feel that goes down easy and barely makes you blink before your glass is almost gone. There a wonderful crispness here that is just a pleasure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not one of Jack's Abbey's finest. A decent beer to try."

"You know this really makes me think of a witbier more than anything else.  Good toasted malt. coriander, and lemongrass character. Mild finish."
""
"A rapidly dissipating white head caps this orange beer, resulting in a rather clear juice-like pour. The nose is solid. Bready and clean with the wheat particularly noticeable, the spice additions complement this aspect quite well. Lemony and citrusy with some herbal characteristics, this seems to suggest that the brewers were striving to interpret a saison and a witbier as a lager. Faint coriander character is present as well. The palate opens juicy, mildly sweet with honey, bread and the orange peel lending a big juiciness. The coriander appears mid-palate, along with the floral chamomile. Mildly earthy too. Hop character is light. Drying on the finish, mildly watery (disappointingly so), this beer is crisp, highly carbonated and has a wonderful, lingering chamomile flavor on the finish. Refreshing stuff."

"Strange beer, not one that I particularly enjoyed or would return to. I wouldn't call it ""bad"" but this recipe is ill-conceived for my tastes, and it doesn't really deliver as a summer refresher-type beer either."
""
""
"There really is not much to this beer...but I thought is was very good. I killed a few of these sitting on the deck of our beach cottege in Seabrook NH. Jacks Abby is one of my absolute favorite brewers and they have a way of taking a very simple, summer lager and making it quaffable and interesting."

"O: I suppose this is supposed to be the lager version of a wit. Yeah, I guess so. However, while I understand this beer is supposed to be light and subtle there really just isn't much going on."
""
"On tap; hazy, pale yellow pour. Clean malts, crisp and light but flavorful with citrus and mild herb element. Good mouthfeel with light, active carbonation. This is tasty, easy drinking, refreshing and overall a great summer beer. Very well done. Recommended."

"Pours a cloudy and beautiful pale yellow with a short head of loose white foam that falls fast and does not leave any lace. The middle of the beer seems to glow a bit with a light as it passes through the haze. The nose is gracefull and has the malt up front. Wheat sweetness with a bit of the corriander laid in earthy. So it's what but a bit edgy. There's chamomille and that's floral and sweet. There's a soft breath of lemongrass faintly in the background and the orange peel comes up earthy to the nose as well. The taste is subtle but spicy. As the ingredients combine they create a very unique flavor. The what is dry and crisp, the chamomille floral and sweet the lemon grass is also faint on the palate. The surprise is the subtle and gentle orange. it's not loud but it is powerfull. It too has an earthiness but it brings the sweetness of the orange t the drink in a way that is light yet juicy. Drinks softly and pleasantly. Crisp lager carbonation that is perfect with a just enough bite. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy in defiance of the spicy character."

"Reminds me a lot of Bell’s Oberon. Not a very impressive beer, but definitely a good step up from Bell’s attempt at summer wheat ale/lager."
""
"o. A very good lager. would revisit on a hot day. I do not like coriander, and generally stay away from it, but it is subtle here. Not overwhelming as is usually the case."

"Pale gold color with great head retention and some nice patches of lacing. The aroma and taste are loaded with exactly what it says on the bottle – bready wheat malt, coriander, orange, lemon, and peppery yeast. As with all Jack’s Abby beers, the mouthfeel is fantastic. It’s creamy while still being crisp and very clean. I’m surprised that this isn’t rated more highly as I thought it was really tasty and extremely drinkable. I’ve been really impressed with all of the Jack’s Abby beers that I’ve had and I hope that lagers become more widely-brewed. When done well, they can be very special. Thanks a ton for the beer, Jared!"

"o - overall, a nice summer beer...a bit sweet for what i look for, but i dug it."
""
""
"Overall- I'm not sure How I feel about this beer. It was really light on flavor but also kind of refreshing. A mediocre beer overall that could use some more flavor."
"Solid stuff. Perfect amount of spices and fruit, melds well with the wheat. Could use a bit more carbonation for that ""refreshment"" aspect. But solid overall and quite unique."

"I can smell a lot of citrus and spicyness, a lot like a Belgian witbeer. Oh this is really good - not as much spice as in the nose but I can definitely taste orange in there. A lot of floral notes as well. Goes down really smooth and it’s as refreshing as a hefeweizen with all the added crispness and cleanliness of a lager. After it warms up a bit I can taste the lemongrass in it as well, but I’d rather drink this one cold – it’s definitely a summer beer."

"O: A nice wheat lager with plenty of flavor. Possibly a little heavy on all the spices, but if that's your thing, then this would be a great beer for you. Easy to drink regardless, especially with the abv. Price reflects that, at $2.69 for a 500 mL bottle. As with every brew from this brewery, it doesn't hurt to pick up at least a bottle"
""
"Notes: Such a very drinkable beer very good anytime. Cheers."
"Overall: Very nice take on a lagered witbier and definitely worth trying."

"O - Nicely put together. This is the type of beer that pushes me to continue my exploration of the style."

"The beer pours a pale and hazy yellow, with a big, bright, eggshell white head of smooth bubbles on top. The head sits at a little over a finger’s width and leaves a lacing of medium thick sheets on the sides of the glass. The beer’s body is properly cloudy with a wheat protein haze and a steady stream of bubbles that are slowly working their way to the beer’s head. On the nose, the beer tastes clean and light with whiffs of cardamom and citrus orange peel interplaying with light wheat flakes. The orange occasionally steps over into a more lemony flavor on the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes crisply sweet with light bitter spice and a touch of citric tartness. In flavor the beer begins as clean wheat malt that slowly builds towards a full bodied wheat flake flavor. As the wheat flavor builds, spices move in on the tongue to give big bursts of cardamom and then a snap of citric orange peel and lemongrass and just a touch of chamomile. The finish is a whirlpool of all the flavors with a final hiccup of wheat flakes, and the after taste of light, clean wheat malt and a slight citric tart bite of lemon on the tongue. In the mouth, the beer feels on the plus side of light in body with a crisp and fluffy carbonation that snaps the tongue at the beginning of the sip and then cradles it. The mouth is left wet with acid neutralizing spittle, and begging for more beer. Overall, this is one hell of a summer beer and a great light sipper with terrific flavor and complex simplicity. I love the spices and the citric snap on the palate, and I could knockback this beer all day long. They should can this! If you are looking for a beer to put back this summer, try this!"
"Though I’m not a huge fan of wheat beers, this is a brew that I have found myself coming back to time and time again as a personal preference for a session-like beer. It is light and crisp with a pleasant amount of carbonation so it goes down very smooth. It’s flavorful but not overpowering which makes it a great beer to compliment any meal. And my favorite part about all Jack’s Abby beers beside the creativity is it’s affordable as hell!"
"O: Excellent. Witbiers aren't a very popular style, but when they are done right, they are exceptional. And this beer is delicious and super drinkable. Perfect for summer, and at 4.8%, it's something that I'd love to drink all day long in the heat. Lawnmower beer to the max. Like it a lot."

"O/D-Jack's Abby is my favorite MA brewery. Speaking in a very broad sense, they make two types of beer: 1) wacky, yet decent lagers and 2) divinely hoppy lagers that are better than 90% of all the IPAs I have tried. This brew is in the former category...but its still damn good at >$3 a bottle."

"Taste starts with pale sweetness, a kiss of lemon tart in the middle, and ends cleanly. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is great. Has thirst-quencher written all over it."

"Notes: This beer is listed as a witbier on this site. Don't expect a witbier- it's nothing like one, nor is it meant to be."

"500ml bottle served in a nonic. Summer 2012 indicated on the back label. Pours a hazy, yellow-gold, almost buttery hue, with a dense, 2.5 inch bright white head. Head eventually settles into a consistent half inch cap - cat scratch swaths of lacing are revealed during the session. Nose reveals lemon, citrus rind, a suggestion of coriander and a yeasty/wheaty character somewhat akin to a Berlinner Weisse. Taste is a bit subdued but is comprised of chamomile, a light, lemony quality and just a kiss of wheat. There is an extremely faint orange presence towards the finish that drops off almost as soon as you experience it. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation and just a hint of astringency expressed as a light tingle towards the back and side of the tongue. Overall, a decent, albeit not particularly flavorful, witbier. There are definitely some interesting nuances, but the spiciness one's tends to associate with the style is not really present. Nonetheless, easy drinking and refreshing. Definitely worth a try."
"overall i like this one - a light yet relatively flavorful summer brew. that said, it doesn't exactly grab me the way i expected (or hoped). maybe i was spoiled by the brilliance of hoponius union. well worth a try though, especially for anyone seeking a lighter beer."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid light beer worth drinking for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""

"Pours a slightly hazy straw color with a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates to a cap. Smells of bready pilsner a spicy wheat malt. Spicy lemony aroma with a hint of grass. The taste is malty and grainy with spice from the wheat and the spices. Lemony and honey sweetness. Light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet grainy mouthfeel. Nice clean well made lager with a twist. Nice to try but for me lacks that wow factor."
""
""
"Overall, an excellent summer beer. Outclasses many summer beers."
"Excellent feel- very light body with moderate to full carbonation. Slightly sweet finish but as I said before, very well balanced and incredibly refreshing. Instead of buying a six-pack of UFO or any other cheap hefeweizen for that ""summer beer"" vibe, pick up a few bottles of Leisure Time and you'll be much happier."
"Drink- It was a nice little beer but just lagers arent for me. As ive said before, ill keep trying. Bound to find one I like!"
""
"Overall: I graded this to style and frankly this blows away most of the beers in the style. If not to style, I would still give this over a 4. This is one of the best Jack's Abbey brews. Floral, clean, and complex for the style. Could easily throw back several of these."
""
""
"Overall, a nice and refreshing lager for summer. This is really light and the flavors are slightly muted, but what flavors there are work well. Nothing too revoluntionary here, but a great beer for the season."
"O: this is a super tasty and super refreshing brew.... I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers so I was almost scared off of this one.... But I'm so glad I tried it.... I can see myself reaching for this one on a hot day."
""
""
"O: An absolutely awesome beer that I will search out to drink again. I must say, while taste is very subjective, this is a very well-crafted beer so the few previous reviews that rate this below 3.5 must not be rating to style. Yes, an American Pale Lager isn't as great as all the IPA's you drink, but for what it is, it's a damn good beer."
""
"500mL bottle with Summer 2012 on the side. Pours a hazy straw color with no head and no lacing. Aromas of grass, bread, and orange peel. Spicy. The taste is of spices with orange peel, grass and sweet bread. Lots of wheat flavor. Slightly sour. Certainly tastes and drinks like a summer beer. Its nothing special, not much going on here. Overall, I dont need to have it again."
""
"Overall, a very nice brew. An interesting version of the style, but I liked this. Smooth is an understatement."
""
"Exceptional brewing Company though. I plan to keep trying their beers. It definitely matches a ""American Pale lager"". Its just awfully boring."
"A nice wheat lager with good contributions from yeast, hops and malts."

"O: Jack's Abby is some kind of freak abomination of a brewery. How do they make these beers? I do not know. They take something like an ""american pale lager"" and make it great. It's literally ridiculous at this point. This beer is sort of an american twist on a witbier/saison combination. It's wheaty, spicy, and oh so refreshing. Great balance of spices just makes it stellar."
" Another winner from Jack's Abbey, quickly becoming one of my fav breweries. How the hell did these guys come right out of the gate at full speed of awesome beers, and just lagering!"
"O - Overall this is an awesome beer from Jack's Abby. These guys make so many spot on beers and this beer is right up in line with them. Such a tasty drinkable beer. This really is super sessionable too, just gulpable. Wonderfully done."
""

"The taste has some fruitiness but the tale here is the pleasant hop flavor. The body is very rich with a low carbonation. The combination is superior. Easy to drink with plenty of flavor and complexity."
"What a well named beer. It’s not a true weis beer at all, but it has just enough wheat to give it that pale sipping weis flavor. That combined with the tradional light type lager, and amazing very mild spices, it’s such a great hot summer day leisure time lager. The spice additions are really what make this beer rock though. If it was just a wheat/lager it’d be boring, those little spice notes are the cherry on top. Actually, you know what this beer really reminds me of… a Berliner weis. But instead of adding syrup, it was steeped with a very mild tea of chamomile, lemongrass, orange, coriander and a very mild honeycomb (I know there’s none in it, but damn it I taste honey). Cool beer."
