"Hints of orange. Flavor falls flat.  Not their Alpine's best effort."

"O: a fine honey ale"

"O - This is a nice summer beer for those hot, sunny days, when you need something that will not hold you down. This beer is nicely spiced and easy to drink. My wife and her girlfriend really enjoyed this brew during the afternoon. Simple drinking here..."

"Pours a light amber hue with golden edges, fluffy white head, decent retention with some lacing. Aroma is sweet German malt, light orange zest and spice. Flavor follows the nose - real nice malt bill, the orange zest and coriander are subtle and the honey is nice, finishes with light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied, light carbonation and a dry finish. Very drinkable - especially in the warm summer months in California, or great for an anytime session beer."

"sorry, I might just be in a piss-y mood, but this is rather bland with a funky aftertaste. why go into details? kind of novelty tasting.... harsh. very difficult to finish the entire bottle. 5 oz flight taster, sure; but never a 22oz bottle.... sorry guys... still cant wait to make the drive down to taste your good stuff..."

"A pretty decent beer, but not great. I probably wouldn’t have it again and definitely wouldn’t if I was at Alpine Beer Company."

"O- such a bad beer from a great brewery"

"O-Alpine does such wonders with hoppy beers and then I tried this. Ouch. Avoid."

"While light, this is not what I would call refreshing. From the 22 oz bottle bought yesterday at the brewery."

"The bottle pours a clear amber with negligible head. The nose is relatively neutral with a hint of orange peel, honey, and spice. The taste is a boring with a similar drabness, very malt forward, touch of spice. My major complaint is that the beer is horribly under-carbonated, syrupy, reminds me of capri sun. Underwhelming beer that I'd probably pass on in the future"

"pour is transparent golden orange with a creamy white head and some large bubbles. Nose is heavy pilsner grain, lightly toasted, with light notes of citric orange and a honey tinge underneath. Taste is more balanced, the honey gives it a creamy body and adds gently to the toasted grain. Also some caramel malt notes, sweet but well attenuated, with citrus notes and a bit of herbal hops. Very interesting beer, nicely balanced and well done."
"Pours golden orange-yellow (or is that the power of suggestion talking)? Grainy, sweet high note on the finish but not overall too sweet. Long finish, particularly the orange and honey. Honey is noticeable; orange not so much. Long finish is like orange cream. Good!"
""

"Not a particularly noteworthy beer. The appearence is a slightly cloudy amber color. The smell is slightly better than what I would expect from a macrolager. The taste has a little bit of honey in it which might be interesting if the rest of the beer was more solid. Because the rest of the beer is so lacking, the honey just seems like it's an attempt to hide the impurities and imperfections in the beer. The mouthfeel is pretty flat and unremarkable. Overall, I would not recommend this beer unless there was really nothing else around."

"O - Light, but the flavors are a bit odd."
""
""
""
"T: Wasn't really a huge fan of this one. A LOT of sweetness, mainly like an orange syrup kind of sweetness with a lot of honey throughout. As it warms, it develops more of a yeast flavor. I probably wouldn't go for this again."
""
"O- Ok beer, very sweet and thick. Probably wouldn't buy in the store if I saw it."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Super sessionable. On the light side but still has some good flavors and very nice balance."
"Medium-light bodied with carbonation just a bit on the higher side. Fairly crisp and clean in the finish and overall mouthfeel. Good summer refresher I suppose. Again this wasn’t bad by any means but not all that memorable or exceptional."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a good balance of zesty spice, citrus sweetness and bready yeast. Not overly spicy or dominant/overpowering in any area. Really well balanced with honey sweetness, orange and apricot countered by spicy pepper and coriander notes.  Not overly complex but flavorful and very quaffable."
"O: So-so. Not particularly drinkable, which would be the one redeeming feature of this style of beer. I was also expecting more ""mandarin"" punch. I think it's funny how average Alpine's regular offerings are."
""
""
"Overall: Nice beer to reach for if you want something light bodied and nice citrus and slight sweetness."
""
"O- Not a bad beer, but pretty bland and boring from a brewery I really respect. I'll be sticking with their ipas."
"A sweet orange and honey ale. Some might think this is too sweet, and I'm almost in that group. Alpine makes far better offerings to have this one again."

"O: A little sweet but I was really digging the flavor. Pretty good mouthfeel and overall refreshing and easy to drink. Far from my favorite Alpine beer but not bad all around."
"I hope it was just an aberation from these guys, weird something like this would ever leave the brewery. Weird stuff, first the slight diacetyl with Emerson this summer, and then to be followed by this failure. I guess I'll stick w/ their world class ipa's from here on out (and Raven's Odin or vice versa)."
"Overall it's very drinkable and not a terrible beer. There is just absolutely nothing special or distinguishing about it. I think they need to revise the recipe because they have so many other amazing beers."
"O: I hate to say it BUT this is first brew from Alpine that I don't like. Maybe it's just not my style or it's just not that great. Either way, this is a swing and miss for Alpine."
"This is pretty good actually after not sounding like anything too interesting. Good for the style at least."
"From a 22 oz. bottle courtesy of a trade with hamilton23. Poured a light orange-yellow with small one-finger head which quickly disappeared. Little lacing observed. Nose was orange, lemon and some spice (coriander and nuttiness) and some belgian-like yeast. Taste was very sweet, with oranges and honey in the forefront. There is some hint of spice in the back but this beer stays on the same theme throughout — sweet. Since I love the hoppy offerings of this brewer, I was disappointed to find not much here. I felt like it should be syrupy, but actually it has a pretty light mouthfeel. It has very little carbonation (and seems to beg for more). Alpine has so many good beers but sadly this isn't one of them. I wouldn't go out of my way for another of these."
"Overall this is just what alpine says this beer is supposed to be. A nice summer time beer to be enjoyed in the hot days. I like it and think its a nice beer I would have with some BBQ. Actually a nice duck salad would probably work great with this beer. Since this beer much lighter on the pallet I think it would pair really well. Since we are all feeling the heat this summer pick one up if you see it appreciating on you local beer store shelf."
"Alpine Mandarin is light and drinkable, but displays great orange flavors that keep it interesting. It could be more complex, but for a summer day, it’s quenching and does the job."
"O: A nice refreshing beer for summer."
"Lighter medium body, mild carbonation, sticky and light on the tongue. The orange flavors were nice but this was too sweet for me - my girlfriend enjoyed it more than I did."
"I really dig this beer and it would be perfect for a hot summers day!"
"O - One and done. This beer just sounded like it would be better than it was. Not to say that this is a bad beer, but it was a personal let down. This would be a great beer to sip on while working the BBQ, or floating down the river."
"Overall, this is a light, fruity beer that while I find nothing offensive about it, it just doesn't strike my fancy."
"Drink- It was okay, wasnt bad just didn't blow me over like I expected it too."
"Drinkability:This is a nice easy-drinking fruit beer that has good orange notes. It's interesting, but I don't think I could drink a full bomber of this."
"D - While not the worst beer ever, it's not all that good, and the drinkability is merely average at 6.5%."
"Bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Very clean aroma with minimal fruit notes of orange. Light mouthfeel. The taste is very clean with some touches of fruit. Orange dominates the flavor over anything else with really no hop notes to speak of. Lightly sweet start and stays sweet the entire time. A very straight forward easy drinking beer. Not as fruity as I would like though for a fruit beer."
"D - One of my least favorite from one of my most favorite breweries."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is a bit above average. Drinkability is decent, it was pretty light but flavorful and went down easy. Would be a decent choice for a hot day, however it felt a bit big and heavy to fit that bill perfectly."
"Skip for everyone."
"Just kind of a not that great beer. I love Alpine's IPA/DIPAs, but this is the second non IPA/DIPA that I have tried by Alpine that just isn't that good."
"My pour created two fingers' worth of rocky, eggshell-white head with nice retention. Color was deep gold with NE-quality clarity. Nose was both orange-citrusy and lightly spicy, like black pepper. Mouthfeel was medium with a light orange zest on the tongue. The label mentioned honey, but I missed out on that. The finish was dry with the peppery/coriander presence that I noted on the nose. Yum."
"When I purchased Mandarin Nectar, I thought I'd be getting a light, refreshing orange wheat ale. Wrong! This is a spiced orange ale with plenty of meat on it's bones. A tasty wheat ale, but the irony here is I was in the mood for something lighter."
"Yet another Alpine brew that I've liked. I have an Expo. I can't wait to try out next."
"D: pretty sweet for my palate and probably could not drink a whole one by myself."
"Man I wish I could get more alpine brews closer to me. I could drink a pitcher of this at the bar easily."
"D: I suppose I should have looked into this beer a bit more before I bought it, but this was one of the few disappointing Alpine beers I've had."
"overall nothing to offensive to warrant a negative review...its a good beer just not great"
"Drinkability - Honestly, pretty drinkable in my onion. I am quaffing this down as I type and it is tasting pretty good right before dinner. I wouldn't seek this out by any means because of the price and as stated I feel I could concoct a Blue Moon to achieve the same taste for half the price but a good beer to try nonetheless."
"Pours a light hazy golden amber color with a full finger white head that fades fairly quickly leaving a reasonable amount of Belgian lacing. I had an expectation with ""Mandarin Nectar"" and the smell didn't support that on any level. All I got was a roasty macro lager thing. The flavor is a monochromatic roast malt. The mouth feel is on the watery side. Not going to finish this one."
"The body is light, with prickly carbonation giving a mouthfeel about on par with a very drinkable pale ale. I'd say this was a let-down only because I expected greatness from everything this brewery makes, and the label seems to promise more than is delivered. But not bad if approached with no preconceptions, a more than solid pale ale."
"Pours a pale orange with a nice head and a decent amount of lacing as it goes down. The smell is somewhat caramelized in the background, with some orange and a bit of sweetness up front. The taste is quite sweet, with a lot of orange and honey coming through. Fairly well-balanced, and another solid fruit offering from Alpine. Highly drinkable; nice and crisp."
"D: Very drinkable, but not all that impressive. Might be a good beach beer."
"D - Smooth and refreshing. Enjoying this beer more as it warms, although it is still lacking a bit in orangey goodness. Given the name, I expected more. Still think would be a pretty good summertime drinker, but plenty more out there that I would choose first."
"D: Nice sweet summer treat."
"What do I say about this beer? It tastes artificial, though I doubt the orange flavoring is anything less than genuine. It's just so overwhelming and intrusive."
"Pretty much disapointed in this beer from a great little brewery. Color is gold with a rather small head. The aroma was that of an orange extract, not truly fresh. No hop character. The flavor was pretty mediocre with that of malt and light toasted grain. Some citrus but it is more in the aroma. The mouthfeel was low to medium and could have used a more carbonation."
"D - Very much so, I might have to for a growled next."
"Light to medium in body, interesting flavor, easy as pie to drink...a good solid offering from a great little brewery, get some."
"D: An interesting fruit beer from Alpine. I'm just glad it wasn't filled with artificial flavour and one could easily drink it. Well done Alpine."
"Not a preferred style but surely have room for this one."
"Pours predominately gold with some orange highlights. Great citrus aroma of oranges. Some bread and grass as well. Subtle orange taste over a bready malt backbone. Tastes kind of candy-fake instead of fresh oranges. Some honey and spice, similar to a wit. Refreshing, but lacking."
"Notes from 1/26/06"
"D-Great summer brew to replace malternatives. Nice, light, bouncy and flavourful. A thirst quencher type brew."
"Not recommended. A very boring beer all around."
"D - I found this to be average for my taste, Not bad, just didn't hold my interest for more than one taste. This would be a great summer drink almost like orange tea cooler w/ the citrus flavor."
"Meh. I probably would have appreciated this more had it been more seasonal. The next time I try this, I'll be sure that it's the summer time."
"I do not care for this very much. Too much orange flavor, and not enough beer. Anyone remember Sunkist? Probably very good for the style. I'm learning that I am not a fruit/beer guy."
"This beer has a weird bright amber orange color with a bunch of visible carbonation. There was no head from all that carbonation though. I'm not sure if this was bottle conditioned, but there were a bunch of floaties in there also. The aroma has a lot of spice in it with a complementing orange aroma. I might be crazy, but I also smell some caramel in there also. I get a bunch of caramel in the flavor also. The orange really takes a back seat in the flavor. This beer is nice and light though and would be a decent summer drink."
"D: Enjoyable beer, quite refreshing. Not my favorite orange beer but I still liked it a lot."
"A tasty beer, one of the better orange-flavored beers I've had (and I've had my share)."
"Pours a kight brown. Minimal head. Some lacing present. Smell is dominated by an orange perfume and honey which i suppose it should for an Orange beer. Taste is sweet with the malt hitting you upfront followed by orange peels. The orange oil lingers in the mouth. This is perhaps a bit too sweet. As it warms a spiciness comes through that was masked by the cold. Mouthfeel is light. Almost soda like. This will appeal to those who like fruit beers but it may just be a tad too sweet for me. One should be enough. This isn't bad for a novelty. I just don't think I could sit here downing too many of these."
"Beer is good. Happy easy going beering."
"This ale poured a slightly hazy, light amber color with tall, fluffy, off-white foam that persisted. There was a strong carbonation from the bottom of the glass. The smell was a strong mandarin orange aroma with some malt. The taste was dominated by orange flavor, but there was also a good maltiness. It reminded me of an orange milkshake. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and strong carbonation. Fruity orange and malty flavors gave this a nice feel. This was a very enjoyable beer, and seems to have held up well stored at room temperature (perhaps it actually improved with age?)."
"Mandarin Nectar is the first Alpine beer that hasn't either blown me away (Pure Hoppiness) or impressed me greatly (Alpine Ale). Of course, I've only had those two. There's a great deal of potential here for the brewers to release a wonderfully orange fruity beer rather than the less than inspired one that occupies my glass at the moment."
"Drinkability: Awesome combinatino of flavor and quaffability; with the orange flavor, you could drink this stuff for breakfast and be happy the whole day"
"Mouthfeel is of honey and tangerine sweetness."
"Light orange amber, small white head with minimal lacing. aromas of chewable orange vitamins, a strange yeastiness, slight bready malts, and nearly non-existant hops. Taste is malty, with hints of honey and medicinal orange. Mouthfeel is light and ok, and drinkability is bad."
"Sinkability  I love their Pure Hoppiness, but this tangy, medicinal effort by Alpine Beer left me cold."
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy, but carbonation is present enough to keep things light. All in all an extremely drinkable, very tasty beer."
"This beer was kind of a let down concitering how great the Alpine Pure Hoppiness is. It poured a golden color with little to no head that left no hint of lace down the glass. The smell was very hard to get, but it was mostly of sweet honey and a hint of orange. The flavor was average at best with a big sweet malt flavor and a good dose of honey as well. The orange flavor was quite subdued as was any hint of hops. The mouthfeel was very flat and could have used a little more carbonation. This is a pretty easy drinking, non offensive beer though(my girlfriend actually liked it and she hates all beers) but quite borring for me. Pass."
"Overall: Not as bad as I first feared. I found it be a perfectly acceptable fruit flavored light beer. Not overwhelming, nor strong on tastes  more of a Light Honeyed Beer with a hint of Orange. I rather enjoyed it though."
"This is definitely a thirst quencher, but I was expecting a bit more flavor."
"The beer pours a crystalline amber color, the head modest and off white in color, the lace left behind a nice silky covering of the glass. The aroma of coriander and other spices and of course oranges, along with the malt makes a nice combo, fresh and crisp, quite pleasant with the start ambrosial, nice malt presence, the top middling. Finish has a stinging acidity, hops are delicate and the aftertaste dry and long lasting. The first beer Ive ever tried from this fine brewery, and a quite pleasant beer to quaff on a lazy Sunday afternoon, thanks to Xlperro for this bottle."
