The taste was nice enough with some of those lime and orange flavors, although it seemed more of a zest in the beginning than a major part of the beer. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing. Nice for summer, almost like a lime radler, but overall not as impressive as I had hoped.","WhiteHillsStore","Aug 11, 2014"

3.28,-4.7,3.75,3.75,3,3.5,3,"Wasn't a big fan. It sounded impressive from the description and i was excited about the citrus tones which is what i look for in a summer beer and this one in particular sounded good. Unfortunately i was disappointed. The initial lemony/hoppy taste in great but then there's this lingering herbaly aftertaste that really bothers me. It kinda plays a trick on your mouth between a refreshing summer beer and a rugged ipa. and dont get me wrong i love rugged ipas but in this fashion it just doesn't really work. Anyway a little disappointed that i still have 2 of these in the pack but overall the beer is by no means terrible.","newaquarius","Jun 18, 2014"
3.71,7.8,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"The taste has a nice toasted biscuit malt character but unlike the aroma there is more of a citrus-like character kicking in. This works on a hot day like today.","puboflyons","Jun 18, 2014"

Each sip smacks of all of this. Stays drinkable and keeps our palates in check. Baxter, making the summer interesting.","BeerAdvocate","Dec 12, 2013"

3.8,10.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"O/D-Almost reminds me of a gin and tonic with a lime wedge plugged onto the lid of the glass. Very acidic. Rarely do you get lime as a flavor in beer (Besides Bud Light Lime of course!). I find this to be Baxter's most well crafted beer, but it doesn't suit my beer needs.

3.69,7.3,2.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured from the can into a pint glass. Very bright yellow color with a nice fluffy head. I was turned off though by the copious amounts of floaties (lemon chunks) swirling in my glass. I guess it was meant to be drunk straight from the glass, as I didn't find it very visually appealing. Great citrus smell. Very fresh and fruity flavor. The huge amounts of lemons and limes come through. Mothfeel was not too tart, which was nice. I found this to be a flavorful summer ale that I'd drink again, straight from the can.","morebeergood","Jul 01, 2012"

3.88,12.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a can into a tumbler, the beer is a bright, hazy, unfiltered, lemon-yellow coloring with a light, frothy, low profile white head. Aromas are light and crisp, with a toasted grain backbone and citrusy highlights. Flavors are toasted cereal, with a tangy, sweet, and slightly zesty lemon and lime blended highlight. Spiced overtones, with coriander, lemongrass, and a touch of nutmeg. Very well blended, and remains crisp and effervescent overall. Smooth bodied throughout, with a light feel despite the dynami palate. The aftertaste is roasty and sweet, with a grain/cereal profile. The finish is effervescent, light, and has a slight linger to it. Very easy to drink, and extremely sessionable. Great warm weather brew.","GarthDanielson","May 30, 2012"
