"Pours a nice brown color with off-white head. Sweet dark fruits on the nose, with some subtle spices; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a nice little sweetness."

"O – I am a huge fan of brown ales so this fit into my wheelhouse nicely. I also dig the Christmas flavors that this is packed with. Nice solid brown spiced ale here. Not for everyone but good by me any day."
"O - Overall, not a huge fan of this beer. Overly sweet and spiced."

"Pours dark amber/brown with a ruby hue in the light and small head. Smells like plums, raisins, sour cherry, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg. Spices are subdued in the aroma and it is more fruit than anything else. Spices dominate flavor though, with a cinnamon plum nutmeg combo. Medium mouthfeel and pretty smooth. Finishes slightly dirty. About what I expected, a bit bland, and not something I will have again. Just can't get into the studf with cinnamon/nutmeg overpowering the flavor. They did what they wanted here, but I would have preferred a seeeter brew with lots of fruit."

"O: A rich and tasty holiday brown ale with a distinctive pallet of spices. Has great complexity and flavor dynamics. A bit sweet and approaches over-spiced, but then this is a winter holiday ale. Worth seeking out."

"Overall this is one of the better spiced beers. Cigar City didn't go overboard with the spices, a mistake that has befallen other brewers."
""
"Hazy chestnut brown pour with reddish-purple hues, topped with a small but dense cap of foamy white head that receded to a thick ringlet and left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is malty and nutty, full of ripe fruit and light spice. Taste of fresh fruitcake, candied plums and apricots, sweet bready malts, cinnamon and nutmeg. Lots of sweet elements, yet overall the beer was not cloying or sickeningly sweet; there was a good balance. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body, but fuller--and much tastier--than your average brown ale. Liked this one a lot, and picked up a bottle to take home."

"Not bad, I just feel the same meh for most Christmas ales."
""
"Overall: Interesting beer (thanks for the extra Mike) and I’m always happy to try a CCB offering. I’m generally a fan of fruit or sourness but I did enjoy tasting this unique take on a Christmas themed brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very easy to drink, full of flavor. fairly complex, definitly better than your average brown ale."

"Ginger and spice in aroma. A cigar puff in the finish Xmasy brown ale, obtained through a mail order."

"Overall: This isn't a particularly good beer by any means. The bitter herbal notes in the finish didn't go very well with the other flavors. I wouldn't have another."
""
""
"drinkability: this is one of my least favs from my favorite brewery. similar to their maduro but a little sweeter,"
""
""
""
""
"O - Perfect cocktail beer, which is what I did. Meant to be shared. A good novelty from CCB."
""
"A good beer to share."
""
""
"Overall, an enjoyable winter ale that avoids the pitfall of all spice/no beer."
"O: A nice holiday beer with lots of spiced flavors going on. Not quite balanced, could use more of a malt backbone."
""
""
""
""
"O- different. Interesting. Not a huge fan overall, but it's not bad."
""
"I love Cigar City and the beer they brew but this one just misses. Too wrongly spiced and oddly bitter. Was looking forward to it but not a fan."
""
""
"Overall: A secent winter ale. My buddy and his girlfriend enjoyed it. Medium bodied with a decent balance. Don't know if I'll pick this up again. But definitely worth trying. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer for the style, but it's just a style of beer that I haven't found to put out something great yet. Worth trying, particularly if you like beers of this style."
"D- pretty drinkable"
"Pretty similar to the 2011 Anchor Our Special Ale."

"Poured a mostly brown amber with an average sized tan head. The nose is mild, notes of cinnamon and ginger with some more subtle dark fruit under tones. Smooth mouth feel with a medium body and some carbonation. Flavor is spicy with loads more cinnamon and ginger notes some lesser chocolate notes are present as is the mellow nutty malt back bone. Some dryness on the finish with an aftertaste I can't put my finger on. But a Great holiday brew. I like the Warmer Winter A little better, but this is a good one."
"O: very tasty brew that I want to revisit and try one aged!"
""
"Overall: Very good beer overall. Was not expecting much from the negative reviews i was getting from friends, but i enjoyed it very much"
"Overall: Very good beer overall. Another fine offering from Cigar City. Definitely worth trying if you find it on draft."
""
"Pours a hazy dark garnet color with two fingers of dense cream colored foam. Settles to a thin ring leaving a few lines of lace on the glass. Smell: spice bouquet for reals - ground ginger and cinnamon and some floral notes. Base is toast, almond, with caramel and dark fruit notes. Taste: black plum and brown sugar are buried under orange, ginger, and powdery cinnamon. Toasted nutty finish. Creamy feel but with maybe a little too aggressive carbonation for a laid back holiday beer. Nuts and spices work together, yep. Bottled Nov 14 2011."
"D: I like this a lot, but I think a little more residual sugars would really benefit the beer. I could see a little bit of Caramel 120 or Special B malt here. Overall, this is a very well made beer that I am happy to have tried, but it comes across a little too austere to be great or too make me want to purchase again."
"O: Not a bad little winter ale."
"Thanks for sending this one doctorb2b... It pours a deep, dark red with a thin foam head. The beer smells like winter spices. Tasting the beer is no different from the smell, there is incredible winter spices that mix with a sweet brown ale body. This is definitely a cookie in a bottle and it doesis nice job with balance. This beer is quite seasonal and tasty, but just too damn hard to get ahold of!"
""
"O - This has good drinkability. I could easily have a few go these in an evening. Overall, I think it is a really nice and interesting beer. The only thing is, I wish the dark fruit flavors made more of an impact in the flavor. I would love a bigger plum presence like I was expecting. I definitely enjoyed this one though, and I think it is worth trying out."
""
""
"Awesome, Christmas in a bottle."
""
""
"O: I looked at the menu and read the words ""Sugar Plum"" and though to myself, ""Oh boy... here comes a sticky, cloying dessert."" I'm happy I was wrong."
"In the aftertaste, I get a leafy tobacco feeling that is a bit off. I still really enjoy it. Who would have thought that I would like tobacco in a beer? guess Im moving up in the world."
"Had a bottle on New Year's Eve that I'd brought back from a trip to Florida earlier in December. I could not have been more disappointed in it -- it's utterly lacking in body, like a Bud Light hit up with all the spices in the world. More than anything, it just doesn't taste finished. It's possible that with another several months in bottle it would improve (if it was bottle conditioned, I can't remember) the way premature home brew does. But I wouldn't count on it."

"O: not a beer I'd drink again. $8 per 750ml bottle is such a waste when you can get far better beers for that. This was really disappointing since it was the first disagreeable beer I had from Cigar City."
"This beer really needs you to take your time with it especially if on first sip it doesn't seem all that welcoming. Sitting in the glass and warming does a world of good to open up the flavors."
""
"O- Overall, Sugar Plum is a solid holiday ale that I really enjoyed. "
""
"The 'brown ale' part is pretty much lost, but this is probably one of the most standout winter beers I've had. It epitomizes a holiday spice feel."
"Really not a huge fan of spices in beer for the most part but this ends up tasting like a nice spiced cake when all is said and done."
""
"Overall: The spice blend is quite nice. If I had my way, I would up the malt a little bit, increase the body, and kill that weird bitter acrid finish. Even with some interesting flavor, those are too many improvements to warrant a really good score."
"The mouthfeel is on the thinner side of medium bodied and just a little bit prickly. This one drinks easily, especially considering the slog some spiced brews can be. Harpoon Winter Warmer take note: THIS is how you do a heavily spiced winter seasonal. I was a bit apprehensive going into this one, but it turns out this is a very enjoyable brew. Highly recommended."
"O: Way too many spices used for a 6% English Brown base. A higher octane Brown or more subtle spicing would vastly improve this beer. This one is on the verge of cloying and quite a disappointment."
""
"Overall, a nice holiday sipper. One and done. A bit too cloying and spicy."
"One of the few times I have not been impressed with Cigar City."
"O: I like it a bit better than most who have reviewed it, but it is way down the list of the Maduro treatments. It is interesting, and I will have no problem finishing the 750. Cheers."
"O- Unfortunately this was disappointing. I think the base brown ale didn't have enough substance behind it to support the additions they tried to pull off. It was a confusing, bland beer and I don't think I'd try again, though it was interesting to have once- I applaud the concept!"
""
""
"As soon as I heard about this beer being brewed and bottled, I had to try it and I'm not disappointed. It really is one of the better spiced Brown Ales although I haven't come across an abundance of them. Nice offering, certainly one worth trying when priced right."
"O-very unique beer. not what i expected. more of a spiced beer than a fruit beer. the 750mL will go down, but I won't be tempted to buy this again."
"Medium bodied with a blast of harsh, peppery spices that overwhelm the palate and overtake all of the other flavors. Tons of ginger, cinnamon, pepper and other spices kill the dark fruit and toasted malt notes that are hard to pick up. This beer is a mess with just too much going on at once. I'm glad that I split it with a bunch of friends because I had trouble finishing a few ounces."
""
"Don't shy from Cigar City beers though... they have a lot to offer."
"O: a heavily spiced seasonal brew - not something I would seek out again, but another quality brew from CCB"
""
""
"Beer a fair amount of spice. Nutmeg maybe some cinnamon. Lot of bitterness from hops and I get this slight pit bitterness to it as well. The nose is pretty good but in the end this combination of spice and flavors was a little disappointing. I was hoping for a sweet tasty sugar plum but this didn't quite deliver"
"O: not as sweet as I was hoping, and it was decent, I feel like they overhopped this beer and killed it, bc it could have been so much better if it was sweeter and maybe more belgian style"
""
"Realy nice beer."
""
"Creamy to start with a cleaner than expected finish. Somewhat drying as well. Medium-bodied with a solid effervescence. I could drink this seasonal brew all year round. The spices are well-restrained in the mouth. Slight coating on the palate."
"Overall: Not my favorite brown ale, but good for what it has become. I wish the smell was better than it is and wish the taste of spices were translated better into the beer. Leaves more to be desired."
"Bottle courtesy of JRedner. Pours a milk chocolate color with a thin off white head. Aroma is malt, spice, some chocolate. Flavor is much of the same with some rip fruit and cinnamon notes. Medium to full body with a lingering malty finish. Nice ale."
"D: I could drink several. I have the feeling Cigar City will be known for the big beers they make, but this is one of the examples of a wonderful sessionable brew that they will bring to market."
