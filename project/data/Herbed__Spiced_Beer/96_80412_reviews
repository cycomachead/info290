"Overall, not a bad beer, but not something I would seek out to buy again, nothing offensive, but nothing that really gives me a lasting impression.  It is a good beer though and very balanced, and if offered I would drink it again without hesitation."

"O: Faint, indistinct, and not quite tasty flavors and nose take away from this otherwise light and sessionable beer."
""
" a 3.5/5 overall. This wasn't as herbal tasting as I thought it would be. A great balance of strange ingredients with the familiar drinkability that comes with an ale. This is a great brew for spring AND summer on those clear-skied days where you just wanna laze about and enjoy the tiny things in life. I will buy this brew again for such occasions."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A sweet, floral beer. It wold be good on a warm day. Easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The smell was off putting but this was actually a pretty good beer."
""
""
"Flavor: unusual is the best word I can come up. A combination of floral hops with an acidic quality similar to a soft drink. There is also a grassy flavor and a lemony tartness."

"Overall: okay. I don't know what they were going for here, but i'm not thinking spring beer."
""
""
""

"Overall, an simple ale, subtle flavor profile and aroma, kind of easy drinking."

"Magic Hat's flagships are almost all very good. I'll never understand the animosity these guys generate."
""
"Magic Hat Pistil ---3.5/5"
""
"Considering this is listed as a Herbed/Spiced Beer I would have to say this one is on the lighter side of that equation and it is a very easy to drink beer without the negative tastes that come with beers like Bud Light. If you want to ween a light American lager drinker on to better beers, something like this or Shiner Bock would be good gateway beers."
"The carbonation's a bit strong, but it adds a strong crispness that isn't just bite. The body is light, and a good smoothness runs through into a dry finish."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow color with a bit of sediment. White head forms and recedes to a collar and provides little to no lace. The aroma is expectedly floral, like fresh flowers and a bit of underlying sweet malt. In the taste, earthy notes and edible flowers come to mind, with a certain earthy flavor and hops providing a firm bitterness. Light to medium bodied and fairly earthy in the finish. Overall, an interesting beer, not too bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: yeah, this is totally a spring or summer beer.... probably just sitting in the cooler at that bottle shop this whole time.... my marks may be a little high on this one, or just reflective of its potential.... an interesting, if not mind-blowing beer"
""
""
"O- It wasn't a terrible beer, Nothing to run out of your way to get but if you have a chance, give it a shot for something just a bit different."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a standout. Seemed interesting but really was not. Was not bad, but for something so unique on the label, the beer just didn't really deliver."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I do not like green eggs and ham, I do like them here, I do like them there. I do not like this beer."

"Unfortunately, I found the overall taste to be like licking dandelion milk off a stem, which wasn't thrilling. I don't think I would buy it again."
""
""
"Overall: Nothing outstanding here, except this beer's appearance. I would not reach for it again. I was very disappointed by what seemed like an interesting idea in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"A weird little beer. It's not bad yet I can't quite figure this one out. I suppose the dandelions have something to do with this beer, but it's really difficult to figure out what they add to it. Drinkable but not memorable."

"I keep trying different offerings from Magic Hat because I am a fan of #9 and I most often find some real duds. This is one of those. Another was their beet colored beer. Just terrible. I guess they are ""one beer wonder"" brewery."

"12 oz bottle from Trader’s Joe. Pours golden with short-lived white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of piney hops and pale malt. Body is medium and tangy. Taste is of piney hops, biscuit malt and some weird staff. Finish is long and leafy. This brew is strange."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A tasty and distinct ale worth seeking out, and worth selecting when a summertime refresher is desired that's bolder than usual."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm really quite disappointed with this beer and find it hard to take another sip"
"O: An easy drinking beer for summer. Decent body, some grassy flavor, a bit of oat, good malt backbone, and a slight bitterness in the finish. Overall, the flavor is not that interesting considering the ingredient."
""
"Overall – Nothing all that fantastic here. A little unbalanced with too many grassy and herbal flavors and not enough other flavors to mellow them out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden yellow color with sediment and mild carbonation with decent head. Herbal, dry, hoppy aroma. Very hoppy like an IPA without an ashy aftertaste. LOTS of herbal notes with a hint of sweetness. Drinkabilty is great. Finishes with a bit more sweetness and herbal notes."
""
""
"O: A nice floral ale that really brings the floral to play. I really like this but probably not one I would seek out."
""
""
""
"3.39/5.00"

"Overall it's a swing and a miss."

"I've had this beer in the fridge for a couple months now, a bit scared to drink it. Unfortunately, it's about what I expected. It's bitter like an IPA, just not in a good way. Not sure how I'm going to get through five more to finish the sixer."
""

"O- Overall, Pistil was a unique beer that I'm glad I tried but it is not something that I would purchase again."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly orange tinged yellow. It's not exactly clear, and has a fizzy white head. There is next to no lacing following the rapid depletion of the foam. The aroma is quite good, mostly consisting of citrus esters, as well as herbs, honey, and yeast. For the flavor, bready grains dominate, with buttery hazelnut, tea leaves, and some subtle hops. There's a very bitter backbone and sour, dry finish. Definitely a bit of a grassy, vegetal aftertaste. This is very easy to drink however and none of the flavors are very loud. Average beer - more of a novelty but not a very bold one at that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"5.9/10"
""
"There is a somewhat clear smell of flower. My grandmother used to cook dandelions and I tried to link the taste, but it was a stretch. In fact it doesn't seem to have much flavor at all other than a slightly sour carbonation with a hint of citrus. I do appreciate the use of dandelions though. I think that's pretty neat. It's certainly drinkable, especially on a summer day. However, I wouldn't get this again."
""
""
"This pours a semi-clear, golden yellow color with a thin, white head. The aroma has a lot of lemon citrus to it. The taste is thin, light, and very floral/fruity. Overall it’s not the greatest beer Magic Hat makes, but at least this will be an easy drinking beer for those hot summer days."
"O: MH missed the mark with this one and I will be struggling to finish the 6pack."
""
""
""
"O- This beer is light, delicate and clean. I really could get a character of fresh dandelion flowers however there wasn’t much else in there which just left it a bit drab after the first few sips. I’m glad to dry it but also glad I don’t have a whole 6 pack of it."
""
""
""
""
"O: Likely very refreshing on a hot summer day, I would not drink this on any other occasion. The artwork is cool, although I wish Magic Hat would spend as much time making their brews as interesting as their bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I always hate to give a ""crafty"" beer a great score but I really can't understand how anyone justifies giving this ""average."" I don't think I've ever had a beer more refreshing than this and that is clearly what the bottle says they're going for. It is so refreshing and still tastes good with the summery notes like lemon grass, even as it warms. I'm sorry, but I'm a fan."
""
""
"O-Another boring, experiment beer from Magic Hat that isn't worth buying multiples of."
"A bit of a suggestion: Don't use the same yeast for every single beer. It ruins what could otherwise be a well down spring seasonal. It's still perfectly drinkable but if you're not a fan of ""sameness", steer clear."
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow with a frothy white head that sticks around for awhile. The smell is sweet, malty, with some yeast and floral notes. It has a nice sweet background that is harder to describe but like the smell of a nice summer night. Taste is not nearly as sweet as the smell would have indicated, the flavor starts malty but moves into a unique bitterness, that does not taste like hops. I can only assume this is from the dandelion as this is my first dandelion beer. The bitter sticks around through the aftertaste, and gets stronger, almost to the point of a lip smacking bitter. The mouthfeel is nice a crisp light beer, smooth and easy to drink. If the bottle didn't display the dandelion I would have had a hard time guessing that one. No overpowering flavors, a nice enjoyable beer, overall it is well done."
"O: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, for a beer that is supposed to be different it seemed pretty average to me and there wasn’t anything that really stood out."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Pistil is a medium bodied beer that is still easy to drink with good taste."
"My pour blossomed into a fluffy finger of bone-white pollen until it was borne away on the wind. Color was dandy, lion-yellow with a haze of suspended particulate in evidence. Nose had an earthy, grassy smell and I began to consider boiling it down into something that I could put in a pipe and smoke. Mouthfeel was medium and it had an initial, unexpected tartness that gave way to a grassy flavor, like freshly-mown grass. Interesting. Unibroue makes ""Ephemere", pronounced ""Ay-fem-er-ay"" and the finish on this one was ephemeral. I found myself wondering if I had even had a sip until I saw the lacing in the glass. Just like for the lotus-eaters, time was passing me by like nothing. There may be a subtle message in there - stay away from some types of plant matter, man. Wow, this was such a smooth drink that it seemed to evaporate out of my glass as I simply could not have drank it that quickly. I am definitely buying some more for use this summer. Next up in the series of nine beers: Peduncle; Receptacle; Sepal; Petal; Stamen; Anther; Stigma & Ovary (the last one subject to FDA approval)."
""
""
""
"Really just another non offensive beer that any kind of beer drinker will be able to put down. Not something I'd ever buy, but I see how a few of these would work on a hot day."
""
""
""
"So what is Magic Hat's Pistil? I thought it was just a floral IPA, but it's certainly not hoppy or bitter enough. It is quite floral though, clearly reflecting the name. Ah, the label reads ""ALE BREWED WITH DANDELION"". Well that's fairly unique. I'd heard of dandelion wine as a kid (it was something my older neighbors made at home), but I've never heard of it in a beer. Or have I? Let me look it up. Ah, yes. Apparently it's not that unique, but it's still interesting. I also note that it's just 4.5% ABV. Perhaps this is a spring beer. Check, the Magic Hat website confirms it. OK, let's take a closer look: Hazy yellow-gold body beneath a pillowy white head. Slightly better than average retention and lacing. Floral nose as mentioned. A little bit of golden malt sneaks through as well. Nice. In the mouth it's light bodied and moderately crisp. Appropriate for what they're doing here. The flavor is not as floral as the aroma suggests, implying to me that it's actual dandelions and not just hops giving it that brightness in the nose (I also get an occasional light note of chlorophyll as well, which backs that up). There's a light tartness to it, which is refreshing; and which also seems to give me more of a floral impression (unless I'm just succumbing to the power of suggestion). It's not very bitter... maybe in the 20's, and it finishes quite dry with the flavor almost vanishing. That's OK though, that works. It's a light bodied and lower alcohol spring beer that's very refreshing, and I don't really need it to linger in the mouth. There's enough charm to the floral / dandelion aspect of it that it's interesting, and thankfully not overdone. I can imagine drinking a few of these in a row. Would I buy it again? Sure. I'd enjoy a pint of this at the pub as my first beer, and I think it would be a good beer to take to a party (I'm pretty sure women would like it). Would I recommend it? Certainly to try. It may not be the only dandelion beer available (does Fantome still brew Pissenlit?), but it's still unique."
""
""
"Clear light gold, some white foam. Transparent for sure, and not much lacing. Light floral aroma, pleasing, but not in a significant kind of way. Just good. Taste is a clean crisp, very light blonde ale taste, small fruitiness. Simple and subdued. Goes down smoothly. Sounds like they did a lot of tinkering here, but the end result is something mellow and lighter flavor."

"dandelion beer... i had to try this. its light and slightly cloudy, white head. smell is ok, i cant smell anything odd or cool or unusual. it tastes crisp and bitter... there is an odd bitterness.. that i can only assume is the dandelions... i havnt ever eatin dandelions so i cant be sure... i do like the willingness to experiment. and over all this isnt a bad beer. i applaud the efforts. i think this beer is ok. nothing really out of the park but the effort to do something unusual gets a lot of points."
"Overall I thought this was nice beer and a good example of the style, it wasn't full of dead on dandelion flavors but the earthy, floral, and lemongrass aspects reminded me of them. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, refreshing, and the flavors held my attention nicely, this would be a great warm weather beer and I could see drinking a few of these while enjoying a warm day in late spring, the refreshing flavors would really work nicely during the warmer months. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance they were both good and I like the complexity in the aroma. What I liked the least about this beer was the creaminess in the mouthfeel, it just seemed unnecessary and out of place. I would buy a six pack of this beer again when it starts to get warmer outside, I think it would make for a nice beer to enjoy while playing some disc golf. and I would recommend this to anyone who likes floral beers. All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, the dandelions worked out better than I thought they would and while they didn't provide any exact dandelion flavors, it did impart some flavors that reminded me of smelling the dandelions bloom in the spring time. Magic Hat seems to be stepping their game up, Heart of Darkness and this beer have both been better than I expected and they give me hope that one day I will find a Magic Hat beer that I really like. Good work guys, I would have never thought to brew a beer with dandelions, and while this wasn't a smash hit it sure wasn't a failure by any means and I enjoyed drinking it, it takes some out of the box thinking and creativity to come up with a beer like this and I applaud that."
""
"Overall - Not a bad beer, but not as refreshing as many other beers this light. I dig what they tried to do with the dandelion, but I think the execution is a bit off."
"O: While this beer has muted aromas and flavors, it is very easy to drink. I wouldn't mind having one of these again on a summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm glad I tried this, although I won't reach for it again. Interesting flavors and an ambitious attempt at incorporating dandelions, but beyond the dandelion flavor there wasn't a whole lot of depth or scintillating aroma. My grandpa used to make dandelion wine, as I've been told, so I can only wonder if his brews shared any characteristics with this one. 3/5"
""
""
""
""
"O - If I was outside all day in 80-90 degree weather, I'd love one of these. I dont really care for magic hat by any means, but for the refreshing quality it has, its kinda nice."
""
"The alcohol was so low in this, that it did indeed almost feel like a soda. I could have had more than a few in a sitting, but only if there was some food to help this go down. While this wasn't undrinkable, I would have only have one in a sitting, since everything didn't mesh that well together. Maybe on a nicer day, I'd kick back with a few of these. For now, it's only a try once just to see what's out there and how much my tastes have indeed changed over the years."
""
""

""
""
"Overall, to me it seems like a run-of-the-mill blonde ale with a slightly floral, well... like dandelion touch. Part of the spring variety pack, though described as summer-like. Inoffensive and refreshing enough to drink a few of these, but I doubt I would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty insubstantial beer. Not recommended for any use."
""
""
"Overall it's a nice summery type beer, which ironically, I'm drinking in the dead of February. Nothing spectacular but worth a try if that's what you're looking for. Great for Saturday yard work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden with a fluffy white head. Not much retention, but decent lacing. Aroma is of grassy hops with some spice. Body is thin and fizzy. Taste is of bitter fruit up front with a rather sour finish. Some hints of spice. For me,this was barley drinkable."
"Not sure where the word ""dandelion"" comes from in this beer, but whatever."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I remember enjoying Fatome's Pissenlit, so I have high hopes for another dandelion beer. This stuff pours a clear pale gold topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light honey, very light white bread, and a touch of sweet flowers. Everything is vague and sweet-ish. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some severely-funky lemon peel, light grass, and moss greens. It literally leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pretty sad beer, one that just plain doesn't taste very good. I guess dandelions are fickle little weeds..."
""
""
"Taste is tough to pin down individual flavors...some sort of unidentifiable fruitiness and a pithy, floral bitterness. The malts are very light, I think maybe more of an amber-ale type background might have worked better with this. The mouthfeel is ok, and the body has a nice creamy aspect to it. It makes for a moderately fun experiment, but I sure wouldnt want a whole sixer of it. Magic Hat might want to consider going to the ~3.99 bomber route, they always seem to brew odd beers that are fun to try once but are really never all that great."
"Magic Hat should lay off the gimmicks and stick to making solid beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a bit different, and, while interesting, one was enough for me, thanks."
"Overall - I'd rather have a macro if I was after a bland uninteresting beer. This one just lacks flavor and not much really is going on with it to make it a worthwhile beer to seek out. It's drinkable and sessionable but I wouldn't want to session it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured this Herbed beer from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy golden/yellow color, produced an average white head, average retention and left very nice lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of fresh baked bread, lemon citrus, cooked veggies and coriander. Medium in body, a foundation of malted grain, white pepper, lemon, and grassy bittering hops. Can't say that I can detect the danelions, but then again- I usually pull them out of my yard, can't say I've ever consumed one. Maybe this spring. Overall, decent session beer- but it sounds more interesting then it really is- This danelion ale had me swinging my hips, prancing around the kitchen, dipped in gold (A La Joe Pesci) - If you want to have this much fun, try this Ale- You won't be disappointed. WWSTCWBD?"
"I had to try this beer. It pours a hazy light gold with a white head. Head retention is moderate, but the lacing is lacking. The aroma is grassy and floral, and it smells a little nectar like. The taste is surprisingly light. Grassy with a bit of malt. The finish is mildly bitter with a lingering taste of salad greens. Definately not what I was expecting. It has a relitivley light mouthfeel and it is vigorously carbonated. Unique, but not great."
"Taste-Pale malt, lemongrass. Light-bodied and refreshing but lacking any real substance,. like a dandelion puff in the wind."
""
"Overall: On first try I wasn’t sure I would like this beer, but after a couple more sips it grew on me and I found myself wanting to finish the beer. I think it’s the hint of the grassy/vegetable flavor that threw me off, with that little bit of additional sour taste, but it would probably be a really nice beer to enjoy with friends on the patio on a nice day."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is slightly sweet, some malts and grains. Taste is crisp and light, malts, some floral notes, very easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall isa decent beer, I would probably enjoy it more in the summertime."
"Pours straw yellow with a small head. Smells like a bag of frozen mixes vegetables, slightly floral, very earth. Tastes like it smells, vegetables, grassy, pretty gross. Overall I'd say try this 12o bottle with a few friends, it's absolutely a novelty beer and I'll be shocked if I ever see anyone buy a sixpack. I like the idea, dont like the beer."
""
""
""
"Feels a bit tannic, similar to iced tea. It's very light, with medium tingle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer, it really surprised me. I was expecting it to be a somewhat bitter flavor, but it did not have that at all, to my taste and I'm very against bitter/hoppy beers (not a fan of anything IPA). It was my favorite out of it's variety pack, aside from the classic #9."
"Saw this on a whim and hadn't tried it before. Didn't expect the tart flavor. It's drinkable. Not spectacular, too many adjuncts and fairly simple, but decent for magic hat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall something worth a try but glad I only got one bottle. Might be better for someone fearful of flavor."
""
""
"A hazy golden ale with a large soapy head and some chunks of lace here and there. smell is malty and sweet with a healthy dose of yeasty bread. Taste is malty with a grassy character and leafy bitterness in the finish. Dry short finish leaves a toasted biscuit and mild hop calling card. Feel is crisp and light with good carbonation. A decent overall summer beer and an even bette lawn mower brew."
""
""
""
""
"I probably won't have this one again."
"O- this is...not good. Very bland and uninspiring in nearly every way."
"Overall: Somewhat dissapointing i expected something much different."
"Being brewed with dandelions this beer gives off a nice floral note, that's not to hoppy. A second note of lemon citrus is found. The flavor is that of a light lager but finishes a little earthy. Beer displays a weaker bitterness that coats the tongue. The finish is clean with only a mild effect to the palette."
"O: ok, not bad, would I have this again?, hmmm... probably only on tap."
""
""
"O – This is a pretty average beer. I was impressed with the look and aroma, but the taste and mouthfeel are just dominated by a floral astringency. I think Magic Hat went a little overboard on the dandelions. Regardless, it was nice to try and while it really wasn’t bad and it was decently drinkable, I probably won’t be looking for this one again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting beer brewed with dandelions. Was a unique experience, not something I could do often, but was worth trying."
""
"This is a unique beer to me. I was surprised that the dandelion notes came through. The herbal, spicy hop characters dominate however. This is light and a bit bitter. Ultimately, this is easily drinkable, but I'll pass in the end."
""
""
"It's not a flavor I would crave, but I'm glad I tried it."
""
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light and fruity pale/wheat malt scent along with hints of dandelion and other floral notes. It's dry with a touch of earthiness. The taste is average. Again, it's light and refreshing with a solid fruity/floral character. It goes down really smooth with a bone dry finish. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a low bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a rather quaffable beer with a refreshingly interesting flavor and outstanding aroma."
""
""
""
""
"I like the carbonation level, but the body is a little too thin and the hops are buried under everything else. Not a bad summer beer, but nothing more."
""
""
"I can’t say I enjoyed this beer or would buy a bottle of it. I didn’t hate it but there’s so much more to enjoy I can’t see going back."
"O: Overall this beer is a sweet comfort without tang and is enjoyable throughout any sunny day. Not available unless you get the mixed pack, but worth the buy whether you are a MH fan or not. This mixed pack has something for everyone. The label alone should catch your intrigue!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Most herb/spice beers are a gamble, and this time I lost as I didn’t care for the flavor or aroma of this experimental beer. Kudos to Magic Hat for trying, but I just didn’t dig it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance is very nice, golden color body, with a small fizzy head that hangs around for a minute. The smell has some malt and some floral notes to it. The taste is different, it has a peppery taste with some like floral notes on the tongue. The mouth feel is good and overall, not one of my favorits by magic hat."
""
""
""
"The aroma is hoppy with grassy, soapy, and citrusy hops and it has a yeasty bread element. The appearance is hazy gold with a large head. The taste is bitter and pretty much just hops. The palate is average. Overall it's not what I expected it's a bitter IPA type of beer but it's not bad."
""
""
""
"O: I guess if you like light and mildly herby flavored beer, this one is for you. The dandelion doesn't impart much taste which leaves the house yeast which people tend to either love or hate... sort of middle ground for me. It does have a nice summery vibe going on, though, which is what MH was probably going for with this one"
"I must admit, after drinking some recent beers from Magic Hat, I was not looking forward to this. Surprisingly, this is actually pretty interesting. I don't really know what dandelion tastes like, but I'm pretty sure this is the flavor..."
" This is a unique beer because I can't say I have had any type of beer with dandelion in it before. The smell is totally different than the taste until midway through and it starts with a slight malt taste, but gets very floral almost grassy and slightly lemony in the next taste. The yeast adds a light creaminess to the flavor with subtle toasted tinges from the malt which has a mild sweet element, but overall the flavors are ok, just seem to cohabitate in general. Overall a good beer to try if you like wheat and spice, but not a really complex beer, more for summer relaxation and I felt it was decent."

"i like it, its clever. definitely an american pale ale, hoppier than youd think from a flower beer, but its nice. smells like the spirit of dandellion, very polleny, like biting the yellow head off one of them, then eating the greens and roasting the root. its hard to place really, in any meaningful stylistic sense, but it sure is drinkable. flavor is very pollen based, in a good way, like coconut water in the sense than its drinkable and satisfying, but you always want more. im impressed with this, feel is intersting, plenty of body for a summer beer, but medium carbonation that lets you taste the whole thing. overall a beer i will drink a million of this summer, and a one of a kind creation. i like the bold hops in this."

"The feel of this beer is smooth with a light body and has a nice drinkable feel. The light body allows this beer to hold up well on a hot day."
"From the summer mixed twelve pack bought at Trader Joe's in Washington, DC."
"O- This was an interesting beer, that definitely fit in well with the summer pack. This is definitely a beer I picture people drinking during the summer. Like most Magic Hat brews, this had an interesting concept and taste but nothing about it really stood out. I enjoyed drinking it, but probably not something I'd drink all the time. I like how they are pretty experimental though, not many beers that I know of are brewed with dandelions. I'm not sure what dandelions taste like, but you can definitely sense a lot of floral/herbal presence in this beer. Recommended trying it in a 12-pack."

"O: Not a bad beer, worth trying, not the best from the mixed 12 pack."
"This poured out as a bright yellow color with a lot of floating particles in it, the head was foamy and white on top. the smell of the beer was floral and sweet. The taste of the beer gives off a big sweetness in the beginning that fades into a gentle bitter finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is light bodied and very drinkable, it's got a decent carbonation to it. Overall I thought this beer was a lot better than I pictured it being. I would probably drink this one again some day."

"A nice light APA/IPA. Good hop flavor, not strong, but tastey. The dandelions don't do much. Good summer brew."

"Pours a pale, slightly murky golden yellow with a thick foamy bright white head. Smells of grassy hops, some herbal and flowery aromas and a hint of citrus. Mostly lemon and grassy hop tones some grain in the aftertaste and a slightly bitter finish. It has a medium body but still light enough to be refreshing, lots of carbonation and a dry finish. This is one of the better beers that I've tried from Magic Hat, quite session-able."
"Far drier than the smell indicates. There's still some fruitiness as if dried apricots were added to the bright tank. The finish features mild bitterness. Neutral body and carbonation."
"Incidentally dandelions are highly underrated. I kick the little bastards whenever I see them because A: It's fun making them explode, B: it irritates other people and C: It makes more dandelions, causing A and B to repeat."
"Yeasty malt mouth up front, with bitter dandelion coming in the middle, finishes with grainy oat notes. Has real nice balance to it - a sharp almost citrus bight balanced by a nice malty punch. This is by know means great, but it is surprisingly good. Goes down real well after mowing the grass."

"Poured a light, hazy golden yellow with a bit of noticeable sediment, under a cap of bright, foamy, white head; minimal retention, and a bit of lacing. Aroma of fresh cut grass and meadow flowers (this is brewed with dandelion after all), lightly hopped. Light taste, not bursting with flavor, but this isn't that kind of beer. Grassy notes, flowery, light perfume, nothing I would call ""spicy"" per se, just more floral than anything. This beer had to have been very fresh. Crisp but subdued hops, and light biscuity malts. Normally I wouldn't drink something this light, but man did it go down smooth and easy. I could theoretically sit outside all day on a hot summer day and drink a case of this."

"Overall a fantastic summer brew that was light, tasty and quite satisfying. It is great to taste a Lager that has some flavor and a great drinkability..."
"Decent but not much to it, some vague flavors from the danelions perhaps ... too subtle IMO. A basic cloudy unidentified brew at best."
""
"Sorry, this doesn't work for me."
"Tastes slightly bitter like tea, along with some cooked greens, somewhat crisp and dry in the aftertaste. A light herbal sweetness balances the bitterness, again somewhat green and floral. Somewhat interesting but not well defined. Tastes like tea mostly."

"Pours a hazy golden color with TONS of floaties.. kind of interesting to be honest. Nice wheaty smell. Taste is light to medium bodied, definitely get a nice warm weather vibe. Great mouthfeel with some snappy hops, a bit of sourness, and a nice clean finish. Surprisingly well balanced and pretty tasty for a seasonal! A pretty good new addition from Magic Hat, recommended."
"I had this out of the summer mixer, and surprisingly it was the standout. It's not amazing, but it's a well put together beer. I think that's the last time I get a 4 beer mixed pack though from Magic Hat...they should really think about a 6 beer mix pack...what's so wrong with variety? 4 is not a variety, especially when you force 3 bottles of #9 down my throat."
"I don't mind this spring seasonal. I'm giving Magic Hat the benefit of the doubt here when I say that this is one of their more interesting beers. Tasty in its own way, you just have to be down for anything when it comes to herb beers. I was expecting one thing, and got something close to what I envisioned. That little bit 'out-of-left-field' character makes it all the more worthwhile. 4.0"

"First off, it's pretty damn good for something brewed with lawn weeds! Who would have thought of dandelions? Start off with a nice grassy lemon aroma.Pours a light yellow with a cloudy / hazy body similar to Heffweisen. Has a full thick head that lasts quite well and laces the glass right down to the bottom. Taste is citrusy sweet with a crisp slightly acid finish. Imparts a pleasing aftertaste. Not for the hop lover!"
"Overall damn its a pretty decent beer that if you were to tell me it's a ""wheat"" beer I would notice the dandelions. Very strange and worth trying once."
"This is a tough one to review! It's a good beer, that's for sure. One of the better Magic Hat brews. However, it's just a little bit odd. It pours out a hazy yellow color with two fingers of head that don't stick around for too long. The aroma is nice, it's got a bit of a hoppy pilsner feel to it, with herbal and citrus hops and grass. The taste is very interesting, with the citrus hops and some tea-like flavors coming through first. Then follows some smooth malts, a very light sour note, and more citrus flavors, ending with a clean, grassy note. There's a lot going on for the 4.5% ABV. The mouthfeel is crisp and light, and the drinkability is very good. This is a superb and interesting summer beer, with plenty of flavor to go with its drinkability."
