"O: Read Patrick McGovern’s book that discusses how this was made and it is an inceredible story. A person who like sweet wines will probably like this one."

"Pours a hazy yellow with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell is rather sweet with the honey coming through the nose. The taste was nice with first the sweet honey and fruit notes, and then the grapes coming through on the finish for a tart aftertaste. The aftertaste wasn't as clean as I would have liked but very good and an interesting beer I would try again."

"poured into a snifter from the jiahu bomber; a very cloudy amber beer with a head that dissolves quickly.  nose is sweet white grape.  taste is dominated by honey and muscat grape, but not cloying.  very well balanced - interesting that the main flavors are sweet, yet it remains highly drinkable with no counterbalancing hop/bitterness profile (though there is a spicy underpinning, perhaps from the 10% abv).  aftertaste, again, is a slightly dry, warm white grape.  much like dfh ""red & white", i was expecting this to be a swing and a miss judging from the desciption on the bottle, but i'll be damned if i'm not enjoying it!  =)"

"On tap at the Bier Stein. Eugene, OR. Poured 3 finger head, quickly receding but a little lacing sticks around throughout. Hazy golden orange color. Smells like sourish grapes, a little musty, orange peel, tropical fruits, spice, mirrors taste very well. Taste - green grapes, spicy as hell but in a good way, orange and tropical fruits, honey brings it all together very well, great flavor. Crisp, refreshing, drinks like a 5%, not getting any alcohol at all.  Dogfish head is becoming a huge favorite of mine. 120 Minute is still my number one, but this is a valiant effort. Well done."
"A sophisticated delight.  Not like any other beer I've ever had, although I'm still a noob really when it comes to craft beer."
""
"Sweet, tangy and a little boozy finish, altough the alcohol is very subtle for a 10% AbV brew."
""
"O: definitely a non-traditional beer, but well-executed as always by the folks at DFH."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a fan of anything to do with grapes, which is probably why I did not care for this.  I am a fan of Dogfish Head, though, so this did nothing to change my opinion of their brewery."
""
"Sweet and strong, not all that complex, but plenty satisfying. All in all, it's very similar to Midas Touch, just with a bigger, more robust flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
"A very adventurous, unusual  brew from a company who aren't afraid to explore.  It's something everyone should at least give a shot... while I don't see myself drinking this all the time, I could certainly see myself coming back to it in the future.  DFH should be commended for this, a great example of looking back at history, but in a way that pushes craft brewing forwards."
""
""
"Sweet without being cloying, I know it's cool to take a shit on DFH to up your ""cred," but I won't bite. The intense hop aroma paired with big honey sweetness is awesome, and the taste follows suit, with added vinousness. Abv is hidden well. Peace."

"Pours a clear golden orange body with two finger head that sticks around a little bit and leaves lace. Aroma is sweet with touches of grape and something akin to pear and sweet fruit and there is a hint of floral hops and oh yeah, honey. I find that the honey aspect is dominant in the sweetness of the beer, the sweetness itself being the dominant aspect of the beer. There are touches of other fruit, mostly grape, and a floral edge that I know of thanks to the label. Finally tried this after years of passing and glad I did b/c I like sweet beers and this a lighter drinking sweet beer that is not too sweet."

"O - If you like honey, you will love this beer. I like honey and this is my favorite beer right now. Sweet, sweet God nectar. It's good to know that I could take the DeLorean back 9,000 years and still enjoy magnificent beer."

"Overall, a unique and tasty brew, but not one I'd return to. Would definitely be curious to try a fresh bottle, though."

"I really enjoyed the sweetness in this beer combined with the relatively high alcohol and tartness"
""

"O: Interesting & surprisingly good for a reproduction of an ancient fermented beverage though I would open another when I'm more in the mood for a desert wine than a beer"
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I really dig this beer. Not sure its something Id made a habit of drinking, but Id definitely drink it again in the future if I were looking for a unique change of pace. I could see this being a love it or hate it sort of thing, but its certainly worth a try in my opinion."

"Poured a nice clear amber orange with almost no head. It looks nice, but is also different, quite unique in character. Scents of sweet fruit, sweet sake and aromatic flowers. It's an almost perfume like nose. Extremely appealing, easily the finest part of the beer. Flavors were very sweet. Sweet fruit, sweet moscato wine, a hint of sweet sake and a slight hint of honey on the aftertaste. The beer is extremely sweet and reminded me quite a bit of a moscato sangria or something of that nature. At 10% ABV the alcohol was not noticeable at all. Not horrible, but I couldn't drink a lot of it. Mouthfeel was light bodied with low carbonation, hiding the alcohol quite well. It was very easy to drink because of this. Overall this is a very unique beer. It is quite sweet, and in many ways has more in common with a moscato wine than a beer in it's flavor profile. However it does have an appeal and I would drink it again if the opportunity presented itself."
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured it from a 22 oz bottle, it has a light yellow color body with a fizzy white head that dissapers quickly. The aroma is sweet and grapey. The taste is sweet of honey, some grape flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and very wine liked. Overall this is a good beer, i couldn't drink it everyday but once and a while would be good."

"Overall, it's a VERY sweet beer, and not for everyone, but if you like mead and history, this one is a good one to pick up. We had it a lot more fresh in a sample at the DFH brewery, and a glass at the brewpub; it's definitely a lot better fresh than in a bottle."

"O- interesting brew again from DFH, lots of herbs and spices mixed with sweet honey and zesty grapes makes for pretty good ""ancient ale"". cheers!"
""
""
""
""

"O: A fruity and slightly spice sort of a braggot with a good amount of honey character."

"For me, this was just overly sweet and the booze didn’t help it either. There’s just tons of honey that just sites on the tongue, which could use some more spice to clean it up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: now this is one fascinating brew. The 9000 year old story told on the bottle does not disappoint. This is one exotic tasting brew, not quite like anything I've had before. I am reminded of other beers brewed with grapes that I have had before, and yet the other ingredients set this one far apart from the crowd. The flavor is just that much more complex and beguiling given the relative lack of aroma. It's damned delicious, though not a beer for the faint of heart - the alcohol definitely sneaks up on you! I am absolutely loving this beer (if you want to take the risk of indeed calling it a beer)!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A really interesting combination of flavors- and one of DFH's ancient ale recipes that actually works."
""
""
"By the way, did I mention the grapes?..."
" Loved the idea but was not expecting the sweetness to blur my mind. Alcohol is well hidden, and overall I think I would like this one if it was just not so sweet."
""
""
""
"This was an intensely alcoholic, but thin beer, but very well done except for the sweetness. It was TOO sweet for ME! I am well known for being in favour of sweet beers, but this was just over the top. Amazing fruity notes, though, all over the spectrum. It had a very lagery tone to it, too. Very intense, but very light in feel. I know they used sake yeast, but I wonder what temperature it was fermented at and for how long, because it was definitely far more like a really great lager than like an ale. Thanks, Dogfish head for another great beer, but if you could lay off the sugary sweetness, that would be great."
"I love this series, and I was stoked to see this on tap at the new renegade tap house on university. it pours a hazy orange tinted thicker color, with a colossal three inch white fizzy head on top with fine retention. the nose is very unique, and I think I smell sake yeast, although im not a big sake guy generally. lots of interesting fruits as well, and a grain blend only dogfish head could come up with. the first sip I notice the feel more than the flavor, its denser than it looks, not very carbonated despite the head, and has a bit of honey type sugars on the back end, a funny feel that I don't totally love. the flavor I do love though, floral and sweet, bright, and decidedly eastern in vibe. there are ingredients here that I am entirely unfamiliar with, but much like etrusca, midas touch, and some of the others, I like the way it all comes together in an approachable but challenging way. overall a very impressive beer, especially now that I have learned this is 10% abv, a strength one would never detect from drinking this beer. I hope these archeological brews continue, they are always a lot of fun to sit down with."

""

"Overall- A little too meady taste and on the sweet side for me. Not horrible, but nothing too great for the price."

"Low B-"

"I really enjoy these historic and cultural beer recreations. This beer is a golden straw color with a hazy complexion. The smell is flowery....garden-like, with honey and plenty of fruit...peach and berries. The beer is extremely sweet. Sugary, honey, fruit juice,a nod a spice that lingers. Full in body and very smooth. This is a very interesting, engaging, and enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Overall a pretty decent beer and worth trying for the history/story behind it, but given the price, I probably wouldn't get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, fruit, and slight herbal and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an interesting back story but the flavor is quite sweet."
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting beer. I do enjoy the initial flavor quite a bit - a lot more than I do the syrupy mouth feel and subsquent flavor that lingers in my mouth though...but that definitely isn't stopping me from finishing the bottle."
""
""
""
"O: well, this beer follows the others in DFH's ancient ales series - it tends to be a little too sweet for my current tastes - but I would've loved it 2 years ago when I seemed more taken by the novelty of the line."

"I had this served through Randal the Enamel Animal with sake and some sort of fruit at the Dogfish Head brew-pub. I enjoyed it, but the fruity overtones were a bit much. I would recommend this as a dessert beer, it tends to overpower everything else."
""
""
"O: We all thought this would make a great dessert wine. Unique, in a good way, from DFH."

"Single finger head with excellent thick lacing on a golden amber murky body. Aroma of orange juice, candied fruits, honey and caramel. As Is the case with so many dogfish head brews the initial taste is strong, complex. A few more sips one can pick out orange blossom, honey, candied fruits up front finishing very sweet and floral. Oily, medium body and light to moderate carbonation. This one is pretty boozy and too sweet for me. Complex and worth trying. I would share the bottle with a friend or three."
""
""
""
""
"Repeated pourings created little to no head, so let's call it a wash. Nose was both fruity and flowery, definitely grape, but with Spring-like flowers, think daisies, clover, et al. Wow. Mouthfeel was medium, but rather flat, with a very mead-like taste. A tip o' the Wood to my Old Lady for her expertise in this area. Lots of honey flavor on the tongue, accompanied by whichever flowers from which it was derived. Finish was breathtakingly dry as you might expect from a honey-based beer. Nice!"

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. 2009 vintage. Poured into a snifter. Hazy, copper body, off white head, low retention. Clear, minimal lacing. Aroma includes caramel malts, orange marmalade, grape juice and maybe a touch of vanilla. Taste really dominated by grapes, sweet grapes. Amazing how all traces of alcohol have disappeared and now this beer is amazingly drinkable at a very high abv. Paired quite well with a spicy shrimp risotto."

"Atmosphere is good. Decent body, but nothing much to speak of in terms of lacing. Nose is a very interesting combination of components; sweet and fruit, plant and...dairy?... Flavor is syrupy and honey sweet with some solid fruit compliments. This should probably come in a smaller vessel, due to it's cloying characteristics. Overall, this is a good...but interesting...quaff."
""
""
""
""
"Sam and Dr.McGovern have indeed done it again! This is a beautifully crafted, almost wine-like beverage. I definitely can taste the flavors from the Sake yeast they used which creates a definite roundness in the overall feel and flavor. Brava!"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a foamy 1-2 finger white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of honey, pear, grape, clove, herbal, apricot, bread, earth, bubblegum, pepper, light banana, and yeast spices. Damn nice and unique aromas; great balance and complexity. Taste of honey, grape, pepper, herbal, pear, apricot, floral, clove, earth, bread, banana, orange, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of light fruits, herbal, floral, clove, earth, and light yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; with zero cloying sweetness for a 9% beer at 10 IBU. Fairly clean finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is yet another damn nice experimental ancient ale from Dogfish Head. Tons of flavor complexity and balance; very smooth to sip on for a 9% beer. There are also a lot of interesting flavors and aromas I cannot describe, but they work well. Very impressive."
"As a sipping beer this was pretty good. Like when I was just watching TV and not really focusing on it it was fine. But when I really got to trying to appreciate this one it wasn't that great. Depends on what you're looking for but I think there are beers that are similar but better than this one."

"The nose is very flowery and sweet with hints of honey. Slight hints of fruitiness like grapes and oranges. Honey sweetness up front dominates, then a wine-like fruitiness washes over the tongue and blends with a flowery brightness. At the tail end the sticky honey flavors take back over and sticks around on the tongue leaving you with a lingering sweetness but a dry finish. This is one of the best of the Ancient Ales in my opinion."
"O- A good sipping beer, but not one I would want to drink regularly"
""
""
"O- just kinda there. Not worth the 12 bucks I paid. All these Dogfish ancient ales have the same base flavor, and that irritates the hell out of me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours clear orange amber. Slight head and light lacing. Nice aroma of fruit (pear and apple among others) and honey. Simple, but tasty blend of honey and light fruit flavors, moderate body. Honey flavors are reminiscent of Midas Touch. A bit sweet, but very pleasant to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm rating this comparatively low because it tastes like a grossly overpriced mead. It is good, if you can stand the sweetness, but you can make something equally as tasty for far less money at home. It doesn't get easier than mead and I think Dogfish Head is really pushing it to sell a bomber of this for $12+. There are some distinctions in the taste because of the ingredients they used, but overall the taste is simply too reminiscent of good ol' mead. I won't buy this again."

"O- DFH's big bottle brews are always hit or miss. This one is somewhere in the middle of the road. Enjoyed a bottle with a salmon banh mih which I thought would be a good combination, but the beer was too sweet for the meal. However, the complexity of fruits and florals is very interesting and pleasing."

"Overall this one is damn good. It's not something that's always available, so if you have the chance, grab one. Especially if you like sweeter beers or mead"
""
""
""
""
"O: A very intriguing beer. Maybe ancient China wasn't so bad. Recommended. Would have again if I wanted something sweet."
"O: An interesting and tasty beer. Definitely not something you can get every day and pretty well crafted. A bit heavy on the grape flavor at times and reminds me more of a Belgian than anything. Still a good beer and worth a try if you have an open mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a DFH snifter, this is very fizzy and champagne-like with a pale golden color. Smell is sweet, reminiscent of white wine. The taste has a lot in common with white wine as well. There are lots of white grape flavors, sugar, and very noticeable alcohol. Pretty odd, and doesn't have much in common with what you normally expect from beer."
""
""
""
"It appears to be a beer, it smells good, it tastes good, and it feels good in my mouth. overall it's a 10% that tastes like a 5% so enjoy that. This is a beer that was researched from 9000 years ago! how many beers that you have tried can say that? not just another boring IPA that for some odd reason everyone gets excited about. It is unique, and for that I say - good job dogfish head!"
"Having had a fresher one of these in the past, I remember not being as impressed, but this one just seemed so nice and felt real good."

"D-Overall i enjoyed this brew. DFH always has tons of interesting brews to choose from and honestly some of the experiments they do are hit and miss. But this one was a hit to me.. I felt like it was really complex and brought a lot of different flavors to the table. A very drinkable 10% beer. if it wasn't for the nose u would have no idea it was 10%. Def. give this one a try if you can!"

"O - ""...the most ancient, chemically-attested alcoholic beverage in the world."" This beer is cool for this reason, and also because it's a decent brew. I'm not blown away, and this will likely be a one-time enjoyment, however this is still a really tasty beer - just not right up my alley."

"O: More interesting than delicious, but an enjoyable side-trip from your everyday brew. If I lived 9000 years ago, I wouldn't have turned my nose up at this one, but I'm glad I live in an era of much choice."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being a little below average. Overall it was a pretty nice beer. I liked how the grapes and honey balanced each other out. Lots of different flavors going on in it but it came together pretty nicely."
""

"O: Does not drink like your average beer making it a great change up instead of drinking wine. A must try but would not be one to have all the time. A type of beer I would bring to a family get together and not for hanging with the boys."

"This is a fairly drinkable beer and I have to say I am impressed. The ancient ales are often times hit or miss, but this one is very well put together. It reminds me a lot of a more drinkable version of Midas touch. Also, after looking at the ABV on the BA page I cannot believe this is 10%. This beer does not drink like a brew with that much firepower. This is surely a beer that I would consider purchasing again."

"Pours a light amber color, with short livid head. Aroma is sweet, with floral notes, mild fruityness, and sugary. In the taste, honey and malt are upfront, with dark sugary flavor. Flowery notes are mild and lay low with the sweetness. Fruity and sweet, with alot of dark honey hanging around. Mouthfeel is slick with a medium-low carbonation. Alcohol remains well hidden. Overall, an interesting and tasty brew, worth the purchase."

"Overall: A very interesting brew, especially considering the recipe. The glass actually felt heavy for the amount of liquid in this one, which pointed to a fairly dense beer. My wife often tastes some of the beers that I review, and she loved this one. I enjoyed it for a while, but, it was honestly a bit on the fruity/sweet side for my liking. Not bad, and one that you should try for yourself."

"O - This brew is not overpowering in flavor, but it has a nice complexity to it. I enjoy the depth in its flavors and overall smooth feel. This isn't the type of beer I could drink too often, but as unique as it is, I could see having this again down the road."
"This is a very unique beer. It's my 3rd ancient ale from dfh and while this one is tasty, I definitely enjoyed the theobroma and the sahtea more. This kind of tastes like champagne and strawberries."
"O-An interesting beer, very spice forward and the alcohol is deceiving as it sneaks up on you."
"Like its Ancient Ale brethren, Chateau Jiahu is okay, but not terribly complex for all its unique ingredients. It’s also a bit boozy. Worth trying, but not worth paying for again."
"O: Very interesting beer - and a very enjoyable one at that. Wasn't sure what to expect, since it's Dogfish Head. It's very unique, and that's something I always look for in a beer. I highly recommend this beer."
"O: I would definitely try this again. One of those beers that I had a tough time figuring out, but in the end was enjoyable, which is what counts."
"Big full flavors, sweet but spicy and a healthy hint of alcohol that sets the whole beer off. A sweetness from honey adds a layer to the beer, just underneath a big and swirling floral spiciness. Definitely some fruity esters that play off all the other flavors. The alcohol taste is a big part of the flavor profile here, adding to the spiciness but never goes over the top to affect the drinkability. For 10%, you don't taste much of it at all. It takes on a white wine quality somewhere in there but the layers of complexity outshine most wines. The sweetness is counterbalanced by a small hop bitterness, nearly perfectly. This beer is light to medium in body with a nice lingering dry finish. Both of these things make this beer pop, despite its lack for a true style. Really solid beer from DFH, but what else is new."
"O: A nice herb/fruit beer that mixes the fruit, herbs, sweetness, and alcohol well. A definite sipper though, and one that could be shared with people with many different tastes"
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"While I can respect what Dogfish is doing and I see the craftsmanship that went into making a beer like this. It is really not my thing. I am glad to have tried it but I probably would never drink it ever again. I respect it but not its just not my cup of tea."
"o - this beer falls towards the wine spectrum a bit. it's got a mild sweetness and light carbonation. i honestly wrote my review down on paper before reading the full description of the brew process for this beer. once i read that, however, all of the hidden flavors that i couldnt QUITE describe finally became very apparent. the honey, the rice, the sake style - all are the backbones to this brew. as i stated to begin with, i really recommend this beer because it is so complex! even if you don't like it, i'm sure you will have a good time trying to pick out all of the flavors"
"I cant wait to age a bottle for next year."
"This was a great tasting and I am glad I bought this beer!!"
"Overall: A interesting beer. Fairly complex. Drinkable. Well worth the experience."
"D - Very good drink, mainly do to its uniqueness; I could definetly have a few more of these; great blend of herbal, floral (rose water) and honey flavors"
"Great mouthfeel. Feels like it would be perfect on New Year's or something. I will definitely grab a bottle each time it's released. Something that will become a tradition with my wife and I."
"O: Very interesting beer, but I think I would have preferred a fresh one. It was a little too sugary-sweet for my liking"
"I love the effort DFH puts into keeping with traditional styles, but this one is a little on the wine side with all the grapes and a little on the potent side with a big ABV. With all that said, it's not all around bad. Worth checking into."
"D - A very interesting brew which isn't a surprise from Dogfish Head... Sweet, but not in the traditional malty sense... Different from almost all other brews... Lots to explore in all facets... Interesting all around..."
"I'd say things like ""it's too sweet", ""there's not enough hop balance", or ""tastes lyk kandy LOL", but the brewers aimed to make an authentic taste of one of the world's oldest fermented beverages, not balance everything out. Yes, it's sweet, and yes, it's wacky, but it's ancient. And I respect that."
"M/O: Very nice carbonation. The beer is very thick because of the sugars but it is smooth and flavorful."
"750 ml bottle. Pours golden with a thick, white head and much carbonation. Aroma is of grassy hops, honey and some bready notes. Full, creamy, smooth body. Honey, ripe fruit, sweet malt and some light hops fill the mouth. Sweet, unusual but enjoyable DFH like brew."
"O- awesome beer. So much flavor and really unique. Reminds me of some of the complex white wines. I liked it the when it was a little bit warmer, not room temp, but slightly elevated temp. Alot of the layered flavors started to come through at that point. If it wasn't so expensive I would drink it whenever I could"
"Pours a vibrant straw/gold color that is mostly translucent, but not entirely. A white, frothy head settles to gives patches of wet lacing. Smells of grape, honey, clove, straw, and various earthy grains. It tastes very similar, consisting of grape, lots of honey, orange, clove, and a smattering of earthen notes. Mouth is smooth, rich, and possesses an intriguing caramel-like texture. Overall, a great beer all around!"
"O - An original brew, complex and balanced profile. A good example of DFH's motto."
"would have to say that with all the ingredients use, its really hard to distinguish all those different qualities as the beer just seems to come out rather sweet and strong. pour is like a lighter colored barley wine. a finger of head. nose of grapeskins and honey... the sort of malty bit o honey candy you get with some beligian. the rice is pretty much a silky feel to the addition to the beer. the yeast is something of a sake finish to it. but all the wonderful details like the chrysanthemum is lost. the hawthorn berries have a similar note of sourness as the grape. big beer with a lot to offer... to boldly sweet... too strong that the malt characteristic overpowers."
"Pours a slightly hazy, bright-golden color with a small-medium white head that diminishes quickly. Scent reminds me of another beer I've had...but I can't think of it right now...is it Stone's 10/10/10...or is it Lips of Faith Super Cru. It may be Super Cru. Either way, although it reminds of that beer, I feel this one has more balance to it and more depth. Scent is SO strong with sweet herbs and spices. Some tropical fruit aromas and booze as well. Taste is initially sweet honey and palate-tingling spices. The herbal notes seem to dance around through each sip, gradually changing from sweet to earthy. Alcohol is not well-hidden in this beer, although I don't think it is meant to be. The grapes dont really come through until this beer warms a bit...but still subtle. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a somewhat syrupy finish. Drinkability is fair to fairly high. Overall, this is a damn tasty beer, but I can't see myself drinking too much of this. Very rich with a lot going on."
"Definitely out of the ordinary and its guaranteed that is what Dogfish intended."
"-Cheers"
"O: Great, interesting, different beer. Would definitely buy agaid...."
"O: Really enjoying this. Just a totally different beer. The only thing that really comes close to this for me is the Nomisugi that cambridge Brewing made. Worth trying."
" This is the last beer I will be reviewing as a Pennsylvanian and before the big move to Clearwater Florida."
"Personally, I think this is a great brew, though obviously so far off from being a beer that I'm not sure it qualifies in any meaningful sense of the word. Still, it will probably appeal to any wine drinker, and even to the more adventurous beer lover. Well worth a try, even if not for the novelty of drinking from a 9,000-year-old recipe."
"Overall, this is another good, yet interesting offering from Dogfish Head. Being a recreation of a 9,000 year-old recipe from the far east, it is unlike anything I have tasted before. It is complex and well balanced, full of new flavors."
"O - Very interesting brew from Dogfish. I like the fact that is made based on one of the oldest recipes for beer, some 9000 years ago. Not my favorite from DFH but very interesting to say the least."
"It pours a bright deep yellow color with about an inch of off white colored head. Leaves behind a moderate amount of lacing. Smells malty and sweet with hints of warm spices. Tastes very sweet. Reminds me of a sweet Reisling wine. Very little hoppy scent or character. Doesn't taste like a beer to me. Mouthfeel is not exceptional in any way. The alcohol and spices are muted and the carbonation is pretty low. Overall not an exceptional beer. It's good, but it doesn't appeal to my particular tastes."
"Unlike Midas and Theobroma (which were quite similar), this one is a real difference. Light, easy drinking, probably well pairing, and so pear-y. Quite nice."
"O: Unique experience drinking this beer – with an interesting blend of ingredients. That being said – it was more like a one time experience and probably not something that I would grab again."
"Overall: To give this a comparison to the wine world, it would have to be Sauternes. It has tropical fruit, heavy body, sweetness, and slight syrup (though a lot of the best Sauternes avoid syrupy mouthfeel). This is a dessert beer that should be enjoyed in sips (and a glass at a time). It is unfortunate that this beer cannot be re-capped and saved for another time (it can be a bit much drinking a whole 750ml by yourself at one time). This is a very enjoyable beer to have as dessert or with dessert."
"This beer poured out as an orange color, expected red for some reason. The head fizzled away pretty quickly just leaving a white ring. The smell is sweet and has a good herbal aroma to it. The taste gives off a wine like flavor, along with some floral and fruity flavors. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side here and it's pretty smooth also. I'd like to try this one again sometime because it's been a while. This deserves another taste for sure."
"O: One of my favorite beers, period. I would buy this weekly if it was available everywhere."
"O: This is a really nice, simple, sweet beer. 4"
"If you are a fan of non-traditional beers, or honey beers, this is a must try."
"it came out an unfiltered light tan orangeish color. a slight head. The nose I caught a very sweet smell of honey, lighter fruits like grapes, apples, and pears. The taste was pretty much spot on, very sweet to the palette. Lots of honey and fruits, a slight alcohol flavor underneath which was expected with a beer that has 10% abv. The mouth feel is a bit full to medium body. I guess having such a sweet taste, but sort of balanced out by the carbonation. Overall, I like what Dogfish Head does, but this wasn't one for me. A bit to sweet for me, almost like a mead. To say the least it wasn't a bad beer, If you like sweeter beers in the style of a mead you will like this, no you probably will love this."
"M: Medium-bodied, some carbonation that cleanses the palate getting it ready for another sip. The 10% ABV is not noticeable at all."
"Overall: Give this to wine lovers to get them interested in craft beer"
"Had this in a 750ml bottle. Kind of similar to a tripel in some ways, I'd say, but with it's own flair. Poured honey-golden with some haziness, and a very thin head; some carbonation. Aroma is honey sweet with light fruits coming through. Taste is similar, honey, sweet wine, yeast, breadiness, light fruits...very complex. Mouthfeel is pretty light with a bit of syrupy film left behind, and an alcohol bite. Enjoyable and quaffable, but definitely an every-once-in-a-while beer. As with many DFH beers, it was one of many gateway brews for me that has just lost its luster over the years. Still, extra points overall for innovation."
"D- Mild and smooth, very easy to drink at first, but gets a bit sweet at the end. A very sweet finish."
"T: I don't think I've ever tried a beer quite like this one before. The taste has a lot of white grapes, honey and a bit of orange. It reminds me of Stone's 10/10/10 VE, but I like this one a lot better. It has a lot of wine qualities while still keeping some that make it a beer. Really glad to get to try this one."
"overall i find this style weird...but very palatable....like all ales from dogfish head....i never know what to expect!"
"O: Overall, pretty enjoyable. Probably not something I would buy in bottle often, but if it is on tap at DFH, I will probably get it again. Pretty easy drinking with no sign of 10%."
"This ale pours a light gold color from a 750ml bottle. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is malty, grapes, with a touch of honey. The light taste of Hops are citrusy. Interesting beer, there are a lot of flavors mixing and matching here. Some orange, some honey, some grapes, spices. Nice carbonation. Yet another beer in a line of slightly weird, off the mainstream beers from Dogfish Head. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. Tastes almost like wine. Won't buy again, but it was drinkable....and interesting."
"This beer is likely to be a crowd pleaser. Enjoy!"
"You can always count on Dogfish Head for an interesting beer. Chateau Jiahu is just that. How is it? Not bad. It's not great either. The sweetness could definitely be dialed back a little. I don't mind the grape flavor, but the floral element of it tastes a little weird. Maybe a little less would be more. It's definitely interesting, and is worth picking up...at least once."
"Overall this beer is so typically DFH... very damn tasty indeed. I love the highly creative and very different beer this effort produced."
"overall - its a 4.0 beer, very enjoyable and unique and pleasant...but VERY dogfish"
"D: exceptionally easy to drink, but again this shouldn't be a surprise from a Dogfish brew. Light and sweet enough to have wide appeal, but complex enough to satisfy the beer geek in me."
"D - Glad to say I tried it, but not for me. Way too sweet, this really reminds me of a amped-up Midas Touch."
"Pours a clear golden with thin fizzy head, good apparant carbonation. Nose is tart and sour, light fruits, phenol, grapes. Taste is similiar, sweet mild honey, sour grape juice, noticeable alcohol warmth. Light to medium dry mouthfeel. Drinkable as a bomber perhaps for an occasion, but not to be retried by me."
"I do own a second bottle and will be aging it to see how it changes. I hope it was a bad bottle based on what I had heard."
"On tap at the Mellow in Greensboro.Poured into a goblet a medium to darker golden with a thin quick to fade white head,white grap juice aromas along with sweet honey,a little leafy heb in there as well.Sweet white grape skins and honey flavors dominate,there is enough of herbal dryness in the finish to keep it from being overly sweet.Its pretty good,its not nearly as complex as I would have thought,nice to try it but one and done is good enough for me."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin, in my opinion, the beer comes off as a touch under-carbonated. In the end, this isn't a beer I would probably ever go back to. It's certainly an interesting brew and there's something pretty cool about drinking a beer based off a 9000 year old recipe. Perhaps a touch gimmicky, but worth checking out just for the experience."
"Drinkability: Although I like the character of this brew, it's a little two wine like for me. I'm glad I tried this, but it's just not for me."
"D - I'm glad I tried it, but I will probably not seek this out again."
"D - Superior drink-ability. Extremely smooth. @ 10% alcohol it could be a bit of a sneaky drink ;)"
"Overall, an excellent bottle of beer! Was sad when the bottle was empty. It's no wonder this was the last bottle left at the store! Would probably go well with some spicy stir fry."
"Notes: Overall a very interesting beer and a good pairing to Chinese spring rolls with duck sauce."
"D - A decent beer for casual sipping. I wouldn't pass one up but I wouldn't go out of my way to have one."
"D: The taste is interesting and different from other beers I've tasted. I don't know what to think of it, but I do know that it would be hard for me to drink too much of this. It's just a bit too confusing for my taste buds and hard to enjoy because of that reason. I'm glad I tasted it, but I probably won't be buying another bottle..."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer in many respects. Being a lover of mead, i appreciate the similar qualities to be found in the brew, along with the lovely color and aroma. The high ABV also makes this one great too, as one may really appreciate this drink like a wine, as well as a beer. Further, the antiquity of the recipe that the beer is based on adds a truly novel quality that gives me even greater respect for Dogfish Head's fine craft. I will certainly be buying a bottle of my own soon."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into snifter glass. Pours a hazy light amber color with a moderate, white head that dissipates very quickly. Lacing is moderate. Aromas of grapes, honey, slight malts, and raisins. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with an almost flat wine-like feel before ending in a creamy and slick finish. Flavors of grapes and raisins abound, with hints of honey and a nice light malt finish."
"I needed a break from my recent binge of trappistes quads, and I thought what better way to mix it up than with one of Dog Head's ancient brews. I grabbed this from the Hyde Park market on 45th in Austin (best beer selection in the city), and I'm glad that I made it my choice. My wife and I are about to go see Little Dragon live and are enjoying this sweet brew while watching Radiohead on a Directv Channel 101 recording. Maybe it's the music, but we're loving this Jiahu. It's sweet but not too sweet. It's amber golden but hearty. It's got a high ABV but you can't tell. It's got a hint of a sweet wine but still has the balls of a solid beer. It's expensive, but very worth it. Well done Dog Fish."
"D : Super drinkable all night. Just exclaimed that I should have gotten three bottles instead of two."
"Overall- Glad I tried it, though I definitely can see why the ratings are all over the map. One of the most unique brews I have had, but that is Dogfish for you, and one of the reasons I love them. Feels like a 9000 year old recipe, if that makes any sense."
"D - not really my bag."
"FourthBeer potential: VERY HIGH. In all honesty, I was enjoying this beer way too much and drank it too fast. The high ABV is completely unnoticeable, and is almost dangerous because more is better for this one. An excellent effort by Dogfish Head, but does that really surprise anyone?"
"Thanks cam!"
"Pours a golden orange with almost no head. Well carbonated but no head from it. Smells grapey up the wazoo. Im disappointed that it's so one dimensional. Tastes very grapey. All I can taste is muscat grapes. Im not sure what hawthorn tastes like but i don't taste much else. Too sweet for my taste but the flavor profile is nice"
"D-well, the tastes start to blend more together but it still tastes decent and it does go down quite easily, this isn't something i'd buy a lot of."
"D: The most drinkable beer I have ever had, my absolute favorite and probably similar to what God would drink, if not the same heavenly brew."
"4.0 D: At first I thought this wouldn't be very drinkable due to the sweetness. However, the palate becomes desensitized to the sweetness very quickly, which I found surprising. I only had half a bottle, but found myself wanting more."
"D: Eh. Weird."
"D - Even with the heavy mouthfeel the sweetness makes this really slick and an easy drink. Danger Will Robinson!"
"Glass: Snifter."
"I had no problem splitting the 750ml bottle with my wife. Definitely worth a try, and a beer I am likely to buy again in the future."
"Notes: Love the back story of this beer but I found that I enjoyed drinking the beer more than the story!"
"D: The ancient beer series' from different breweries (Dogfish especially) are very intriguing, although, I don't think I've enjoyed one more than this one. There is a sweetness that is very well balanced with the spices and it works."
"not super drinkable. a goblet is no problem, but i definatly wouldnt want a whole bottle. it didnt go well with my black and blue burger, i didnt really think it would. i wouldnt recommend this nor would i buy it again."
"This beer pours a pretty light golden color with little to no head at least as far as longevity is concerned. The smell is essentially the white grape tannins, and a sweet rice aroma. Overall the smell is rather weak. The taste however is rather nice. The background is something more along the lines of a rice lager or happoshu, but the sweetness from the honey and the flavor of the white grapes really helps to make this beer enjoyable. The mouthfeel is a tad on the dry side and I assume the combination of sake yeast and white grapes would contribute to that, but this is still a rather drinkable and enjoyable brew. If offered to me I would have it again, but I don't know if I would personally buy another bottle of it."
"slightly syrupy, medium-bodied mouthfeel; pretty well carbonated. the unique kind of beer that will warrant a revisit, just not a lot in a sitting."
"D: too sweet, the kind of thing that girls who don't like beer would like. It reminds me a lot of mead, which is not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. It's a good idea, but a bad execution."
"D- Its best to share the bottle and your thoughts with some company. It is very sweet and kind of confusing. The alcohol is fairly well masked @ 10%ABV."
"Pretty thick and chewy and very sweet so it is going to be a slow one. But this is still very good and was a nice after dinner styled beer could I have drank 2 ? hell no, but be sure to give it a shot becuase its definitely one of a kind."
"Now... time to pop a Berserker and go party with Phish to send out 2010!"
"D - This was a complete shock to me, excellent and such a differently refreshing beer. I will definitely want to have this beer again, could be a fine Summer beer. If you are adventurous or just love Dogfish Head's search for unique brew experiences, get this!"
"For what it is, this beer is worth trying. Of course the description of making this beer from a 9,000 year old recipe is quite appealing, too. In terms of drinkability, this one is not for consecutive consumption."
"Overall, an absolute treat. Delicious. I will be keeping a regular stock of this brew."
"The beer pours a golden orange color with white head. The aroma is very complex and I am sure I am missing some aspects of it. I get some flowers, orange citrus, bready malt and alcohol. The flavor is also complex. I get a lot of toffee, but I also get some nuttyness, flowers, perfume, orange citrus, maple, sugar and apples. I also get a nice dose of alcohol in the flavor, but the beer is still very easy to drink, although it does get a little bit cloying at the end due to the high sugar content. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very interesting beer with a very interesting back story. Of all the ancient ales brewed by Dogfish Head, this is one of my favorites."
"For a spiced brew, this is one of the best I have had. I havent had many though but this one is top notch for a style I dont try too often. Very good brew... and the alcohol is masked perfectly."
"I was sucked into the hype of the beer after watching the show... I was expecting something a bit more from the honey side. All I tasted was the sweetness like an apple cider without the bite. The more I let it sit, the more I got the syrup taste of sour grapes. Not my favortite beer by far. It was worth a one off but I wont pay $12 again for it."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer that has some unique flavors to it. I do not think this is one of dogfish heads better beers. It was worth trying though I will not buy it again."
"D - not very drinkable, a strong syrupy sweet beer. Not my cup of tea."
"I know this has barley in it - it's just that I can't really tell by drinking it. If you told me this was a mead/late harvest white wine blend, then I'd be sold. The 8 points of booze are well obfuscated by the strong sweetness, and thoughts of beer are generally subsumed. It's cool that DFH is trying to revive lost beer styles - but they are also blurring the border between actual beer and other alcoholic beverages."
"D- Too sweet for me. I don't know how I will finish this bomber. However, I'm really enjoying this glass. Taste more like a sweet wine than a beer."
"I'm used to dogfish head's beer tasting very complex. With this beer a missed that. I know the recipe wasnt simple per se but the taste was kind of singular (or dual, i guess): Grape Juice and Honey. Not that it wasn't fun to drink. In fact the APV snuck up on me like a ninja at night. I like this for a session beer with someone whos not a beer person. It's the Dogfish beer that I would suggest to a layperson; A layperson who I want to get drunk."
"I can't see myself buying this again. It's a decent experimental brew though."
"D: This, Midas Touch, and Theobroma appear to be quite similar being separated by few nuances."
"Complex and interesting but does not initially compel me to have another; slightly flat on draft, so I want to try this from the bottle."
"This once again shows that DFH knows how to make an off-centered beer and come through with it. I'm loving their obscure beers and the Chateau is no exception. Well done, I'd like another."
"Amazingly smooth with the honey right upfront. A nice balanced light malt body dominates with the grapes strongly pulling up the rear. You can taste the sweetness of the grapes when you lick your lips after. I have never been a fan of fruit themed beers and I know this one isn't trying to be but every brewery trying to get fruit down should grab some ideas from this."
"Overall, while there are many things to like about this brew, what we liked most was the idea itself, of gathering a 9000 year old recipe, and the chic, attractive label design. The aroma is wildly fruity and complex, and the sweetness is, while apparent, mysteriously well controlled, for a surprisingly refreshing brew."
"D: Very drinkable, there is nothing about this beer that would prevent one from finishing the bottle. I was very interested in trying this one because of the story behind it, and it did not disappoint in the least."
"Overall, Im glad I tried this beer because I appreciate the age and history in the brew, I just think that we are better at brewing these days."
"Pours an oranish clear color with no head and a little lacing on the glass. The nose is of honey, grapes, and some other sweetnees. The nose is appealing with a almost champagne smell. The taste has a tartness from the grapes with a strong honey sweetness and some sweet malt taste as well. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and a bit creamy with a slight bite to it. The creamy feel is in the middle and then the bite comes out. The drinkability is good, is an easy drink with a decent amount of complexity. Overall its a solid beer but very similar to others out there."
"Drinks like a smooth, light wine. Finishes like an approachable sake. mmm. Sushi. Or perhaps a spicy Thai curry."
"Notes: very tasty. seems to have that sweetness than is presentn many DFH brews. another reason why they are the best!"
"First sip is..interesting. At first, it doesn't really come out to you as very different from any other beer. But there are things to this that are...different than what you usually taste in a beer. I'd have to say that this beer is really a story about subtlety. It's in the ingredients that you really find what makes this so special. And although I do enjoy the beer, I probably wouldn't pick it over a six pack of coffee stout or barleywine. Still, with such a history behind it, you really should treat yourself to it sometime."
"If molecular biologist Patrick E. McGovern is correct and Neolithic Chinese shaman were connecting with the spiritual world through the use of brews like this, I can understand why they would be eager to partake in such undertakings."
"Okay by almost any standard, drinkable, but it seems like they are treading over ground they've already covered, and tastes suspiciously similar to the other historical re-creations. Perhaps it's the honey and grapes that dominate the remaining characteristic nuances that set this apart, because it definitely doesn't seem to be doing it any favours in that department. Unless it's to represent that most of these beers in their day were a fermentable carbohydrate blended with fermented grapes and honey as well as a standard on par. Worth trying once, and after that it comes down to personal whim. Although I enjoy most of what Dogfish Head has to offer, after this one I now await their next historical re-creation that spotlights fermented honey and grapes as that seems to be the trend. Not really actually...."
"Poured in a chalice a hazy, peach-orange color with a pinkish hue to it. It has barely a head with the moderate lacing of a tripel perhaps; looks well-developed. The smell is of grapes dominating and the same goes for the taste of this brew. It's fruity and flowery and I noticed that it has a similar berry taste to the Fort. For a 10% abv. brew this is well-crafted and the mouthfeel is a medium on a scale of heaviness. The blend of exotic fruit and ingredients is clutch as always with Dogfish Head. I have now been able to compare this to the previous year's and the only difference is that I noticed the honey a little bit more last year than I did this time around. An all around solid and interesting brew and this comes as no surprise from DFH."
"D - Old but good, this brew reminds me a lot of Midas Touch with the honey and white grape. I've got to say that it holds up very well with age. I'm gonna grab a fresh bottle of this for comparison, but it's enjoyable even after four years. No alcohol presence at all."
"Creamy white head with good retention,golden amber in color.fragrantly fruity honey apple and grapes.very sweet kinda reminds me of sweet apple cider.dry,sweet bitter mouth finish.if your into sweet beer this is defiantly for you. Big fan of most dog fish brews but it's a bit sweet for me."
"Drinkability: Its just too sweet I'm glad I split it. not as bad as Sahtea but still just to sweet for my taste."
"D- The sweetness results in this beer being a bit of a sipper. Well made, interesting, and enjoyable."
"Pours a moderate golden color into might tulip. A slight amount of haze and a light head and some lacing that falls a bit too quickly. The nose is spice with some green apple, grapes, and honey. The taste is fairly sweet with a tad bit of spicing and some mild fruit flavors. Zesty feel with a nice body. Drinks pretty well; a nice and interesting brew."
"Light bodied beer with a fairly aggressive carbonation that hits the tongue sharply. Refreshing for a beer with 8% abv, and decently drinkable, but just not as complex as I would have liked this to be."
"D - a little boozy at the finish, but otherwise smooth and easy to drink...chug, even if so inclined."
"This beer poured a nice medium amber color, and had a small head that dissipated and left a small ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Looked pretty carbonated. Smelled of honey, grape, rice, and maybe a touch of alcohol. you could really taste the honey. It was great at first, but got a little too sweet the more and more I drank it. The sweetness thing wasn't too much of a deal for me. This is different from what I usually drink, and it was definetly refreshing. Had a good mouthfeel on this. It was nice and creamy and had less carbonation that I thought it would. It had a nice medium body. The drinkability was good on this. I would definitely like to have another one of these. Cheers."
"D: I respect what they did here and I totally get it, however, I had trouble finishing the glass."
"Surprisingly sweet, refreshing and very delicious. This will be a little too sweet for a hopheads' taste but fans of maltier beers might like it a lot, as I am right now. Really a treat, although too sweet to drink a whole lot of."
"Despite the bubbly-appearance, this is actually smooth. I think it should be a bit more carbonated, but this isn't horrible. A nice beer to enjoy slowly."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This is an interesting take on a beer. I am glad that Dogfish Head is willing to push the bounds so we can taste something similar from history's past. It is a good beer and easy to drink."
"A gold apricot in color no cloudiness. A thin head white in color that disaptes quickly with little to no lacing, low carbination. Sweet grape-y almost sake-ish smell... different. You can taste the the grape and honey right up front, there is a flavor there I do not recongize must be the hawthorne fruit. Descent beer but Dogfish makes better."
"D = overall, for what it is, I'm pleasantly surprised that such an ancient recipe would taste so clean. Though I see this one as more of a novelty brew. One I'm happy to experiment with, but seems a little one-dimensional to me."
"very good pretty crisp when the beer is chilled none of the flavors are overwhelming but when the beer warms up the hawthorn comes to the front and i dis not really care for it"
"D: An interesting and drinkable beer, but it's more of a curiosity than anything else."
"Awesome beer. It's pretty unique...Very much enjoyed!"
"drinkability: very easy to drink and very pleasent."
"D: This would be nice as a sweet dessert wine (it's priced like one too) and would make a unique host/ess gift for a dinner party. I would drink it again, but at this price I probably won't be seeking it out anytime soon."
"Overall this was an interesting beer but the flavors weren't quite distinct or smooth enough to make it anything more. Still, worth a shot, especially if you're a fan of DFH's other experimental beers."
"I had this brew during a tour of the brewery and liked it most of the four they allowed us to sample. I bought a bottle and brought it home. I decided to share it with my wife since it was very sweet. After dinner, we opened the bottle and...it was nothing like the brew I remember from the brewery. It reminded me of a Miller Lite with honey thrown in. It was very light, highly carbonated and had that corn brewed taste. The sweetness was not nearly what I remembered it to be. If I were to rate this during the tap pour, it would have probably gotten much higher scores. I love DFH brews, but this one that I will pass on next time."
"Cheers."
"Way to go Sam (again!)!! I love the ancient brews and this one is exceptional!"
"D- its an interesting brew but a bit off of what I look for in a beer. Now with some cheese and clover honey we might have something."
"In the mouth is a full honey flavor in the back balanced b a tart grape flavor that masks most of the sweetness, finnishes with a slight pineapple flavor. This was interesting and good, but not one I'd drink all the time."
"Overall, this is just not a winner or repeatable."
"Price = $18"
"D- Even though I feel that it lost something being a year old beer, I still feel it is good. The taste is not as good but it did not change too much from what I remember, just more of the white wine comes out. I will buy this beer again and again, will drink it when it is fresher and re-review it."
"I cracked open a bottle dated from 2006. It poured a murky gold with a lot of sediment. The sediment was actually pretty chunky but not a turn off at all. It had a very slight cream colored head. The smell was very strong of muscat grapes. The smell was a little faded however, showing its age but it smelled very appealing and of a white wine. The taste was very good. It was like a white wine mixed with a light belgian. The taste was excellent and not too sweet. The mouthfeel was light to medium and the beer was still moderately carbonated. It was very drinkable and aged rather well. I recommend this one."
"I'd hit it again."
"D- Decent drinkablility except for the ABV. This one will sneak up on you hard if you're not careful."
"All told: this is an interesting beer, initially is posesses a lot of characterists of beers that are hard to drink, though goes down smoothly- despite the alcohol content."
"A liked this a lot better than I did."
"Another from the Ancient Ales series from DFH, this beer gets marks for its heritage and creation, otherwise the score may have been lower. I'm just glad this is not the only beer available as I will probably only ever drink this again once."
"Tastes like unfiltered sake meets chardonnay meets American malt liquor. Green grapes are prominent and the rice wort is honeyed and plenty evident. Interesting and strange, but intriguingly drinkable. Sharp, brittle bite on the finish and nearly has as much sake flavor as Hitichino XS. Not as complex as XS, but plenty interesting in it's own right. Might not be worth the price, but it was damn fun to try at least once."
"D- Its suprisingly drinkable with all the strange flavors it packs... Cheers!"
"D= Pretty good beer. I'm happy I got to try it. Like I said I love the historic beers from DFH. This is no exception. This beer isn't something I would drink often at all but in the right circumstance this is one of those beers that can really tie things together."
"Certainly drinkable, with the wife and I happily splitting the bottle, and putting it on the grocery list to buy again!"
"D: This is a good beer to sip as the interesting flavors will continue to hold your palate's attention. The alcohol is relatively well masked, so I think I would try this again."
"I like Chateau Jiahu, but I don't love it. It is an interesting beer with a lot going on, but I sipped it for a long time, and was thinking about what I was going to order next about half way through."
"D - Highly drinkable. Totally worth the $14/750mL. 5.0"
"It still has a syrup kicker, but you know what? Its St Patricks Day and I am drinking a damn good beer. You cant beat that."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden amber, with a very small head and appropriately minimal lacing. The nose is honey, peach, white grapes, lemon, and coriander. The taste is similar, with notes of honey, white grapes, citrus, blood orange, and lemon zest. The body is on the heavier side of medium (or the lightest side of heavy...whichever), with relatively low carbonation and a somewhat syrupy feel, leading to a high but hindered drinkability (it would be a bit higher if the body were slightly thinner and the ABV a tad lower). Those ancient Chinese had a winner here..."
"Could have used a little less sweetness. Apparently this beer wasn't bottle-conditioned. I think the yeast would have helped to diminish the sweetness and also add another layer of flavor complexity. Still pretty good, though."
"Verdict: As with all of the Dogfish Head historical beers, this in an unexpected and thoroughly enjoyable treat. A unique blend of flavors, Chateau Jiahu is a worthwhile and interesting brew."
"This surpassed my expectations as a unique brew, drinkable... yes. will I pursue it again? nope. But definetly worth a try to learn what this beverage is like. very cool background story."
"Intense, unique beer. Another well done experiment by DFH. I really like this one."
"Overall, I'd say it met my expectations based on reading the bottle. Fruity, sweet, and flowery. I wouldn't turn it down if offered one, but I'll wait til next year to try it again."
"D: Drinkability was decent, unique and a good one time treat. Not something I could see drinking on a regular basis but nice to taste a part of history. Share a bomber with a friend and some good beer stories and history while drinking a part of it."
"D: Loses no points in the ""personality"" department. But what makes the Chateau Jiahu so unique and interesting is also what keeps the drinkability rating average. Halfway through the bottle the sweetness became bothersome and somewhat cloying. A bottle this big needs to be shared several ways. Cheers to DFH for a successful experiment and for the re-interpretation/re-creation of a 9000 year old brew."
"D: A pretty strong brew. I shared it with my friends and since I was in recovery from a pretty loathsome illness it hit me pretty hard. But I'd like to have another now that I'm on my feet."
"Mouthfeel is dry but light. Taste is too sweet for high drinkability."
"The mouth was really light with low carbonation, no bitterness but the sourness really does it's work. It's a lot like a lambic, too sour for my taste but good overall, very interesting."
"The beer pours a bright gold color with OK head retention and lacing. The nose is fairly light, with cinnamon, grape juice and light brown sugar. Flavors replicate the nose, but this beer is bit sweeter then I'd like or was expecting, with lots of sweet grape juice. There is some slight honey and citrus in the finish, but not enough to counter the grapy sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and while I appreciate the amount of flavor in this beer, the excessive sweetness and noticeable booziness make this beer a bit difficult to take. Just not my cup of tea..."
"The flavor is much more pleasing, if not terribly different, from the nose. Lots of white grape notes, sweetness of honey, some strong floral notes presumably from the chrysanthemum. The mouthfeel could use a boost in carbonation, but otherwise it's a fairly well-done effort. Interesting and worth seeking out on its own merits."
"Some of DFH's bombers can be hit-or-miss but this is one of their best. Along with Midas, there are flavors here that you just don't find in 99% of beers, and for that reason alone it's worth a try."
"Not my favorite offering from DFH"
"Overall: Distinct and experimental, I enjoyed it but others may not due to the sweetness even though its not overpowering."
"D: Definitely an interesting recipe and one to be shared with friends. AT 8% ABV, it's like a mildly fortified, malty wine. It paired quite nicely with cracked pepper and olive oil crackers topped with cheddar. Sips pretty well on its own too."
"This is some great stuff."
"Thanks to edbeer for sharing. 750ml bottle served in my Allagash tulip. Poured a golden-orange with a thin white head that dissipates into a skim. Clarity is hazy - just shy of translucent. Nose is grapes and bubblegum. Taste consistent with nose, maybe the addition of some orange in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a consistent and mild background effervescence. An interesting and flavorful beer, but a little too sweet. However, probably my favorite of DFH's historical brews."
"Drinkability - It was definitely a unique experience, but I can't see myself running out and drinking this all the time. Neat experience worth trying and for sharing with others, but I doubt I could finish a whole bottle myself over an evening."
"Overall, Jiahu is not a bad beer. I was glad to be able to share this bottle. Between the two DFH ancient ales that I've tried, Jiahu is favored over Theobroma. I would buy this from time to time, just for something a little different."
"Notes: Leans on the expensive side for the DFH specialty bottles and that may be a bit of a deterrent. The experiment works and its historical investigation is enticing enough. Part of a foundation is shared with other DFH brews such as Midas Touch or Theobroma, not a bad thing but not a great one either in terms of the experience (if you are familiar with some of those it may have a repetitive echo to it.) It remains a great brew in any case. It´s not one that I will be having on my own or highlighting often but I sure plan to have on my table at group meeting and in particular to provoke bubbly drinkers."
"A very interesting beer, my only problem is that it just doesn't stand apart from Midas Touch or Theobroma, the flavors that I am looking for are only hiding in the background. The creative current behind the beer is quite interesting, the alcohol is well hidden, it is quite drinkable. The body is very light as can be expected from the rice, a lingering sour-sweetness hides behind medium-heavy carbonation. I had this on tap at the Dogfish Head rest. and pub in Falls Church Va, and I must say I was expecting the beer to be poured slightly warmer. At close to 32 degrees, it took a while for this to warm up enough to be flavorful, and even then it was a bit light for me. Regardless of the outcome, I love the ideas but forth by Sam and the team at Dogfish, way to pave some new (old) roads."
"A great example of something new and exciting."
"drinkability: overall glad to have tried it but not the best DFH"
"This was served on draught at Dogfish head pub in Gaithersburg, MD. Beer is clear, light yellow / orange, no head to speak of and minimal lacing, low carbonation. Aroma is fruity sweet, smell of grapes. This beer tastes like chardonnay. Seriously, white wine with grain. I'm not digging this beer. All and all its a fine beer but definitely not my favorite from DFH. Worth a look, hard to drink though."
"D: Interesting diversion. This would not be a regular beer."
"Pretty good overall and a very interesting idea for a beer."
"Drinkability: What an amazingly different beer to say the least. One of the epitome of spiced beers that really sets the tone for Dogfish Head's ever expanding line-up of ancient recipe beers. I love how the grapes in this beer really show characteristics of wine as this could be served to a wine drinking only person and actually be liked. The amount of spiciness is just enough to keep me involved and interested with the kick of alcohol doing the rest of the work in the finish. As far as drinkability goes, this is a very drinkable beer with the %8 ABV well hidden behind all of these beautiful spiced properties and fruit florals. Overall, another excellent beer from Sam and the Dogfish Head crew that deserves it's ranks as one of the best spiced beers in the world."
"I would definately order this beer again. I'm a huge fan of these old brews Dogfish seems to find. It was a great beer to end the warm Florida night."
"Overall, I am really glad I grabbed the bottle of this and will buy it again."
"D - One, maybe two glasses, please. Another wierd one from DFH."
"Another interesting beer coming from DFH, they certainly like to experiment with these ancient recipes and I'll certainly give them a go, but I probably won't go for this one again."
"Simply put, I've never had a beer like this before in my life. I've never even heard of something as crazy as this! I enjoyed the hell out of it and I called friends before finishing my glass to buy a bottle if they ever see it on store shelves. Chateau Jiahu is a unique beer that drinks like wine and a must try for anything, just the uniqueness of the beer."
"I'm impressed not only with the fact that DFH recreated this beverage but that it tastes so darn tasty!"
"This is really, really unique and should be commended for being so. One of the most remarkable things is that for all of the sweetness of this beer I didn't once mention the malt bill. Dogfish Head continues to impress me with their attention to detail and all-around batshit insanity."
"D - very nice and could drink a bunch alsmost wine like in its taste."
"Dogfish Head has had better showings than the Chateau Jihau."
"Drinkability: For me this is a slow sipper and a one a night beer. I was pleasantly surprised at enjoying this a much as I did because I usually don't care for honey flavor in beer. I certainly would drink this one again."
"D: Depending on you fascination with spiced beers, this is a great offering from DFH that can be enjoyed more than once in an evening."
"D: I'm gonna have to pass on this one, interesting, and there is a ton to appreciate, especially from a time perspective, would I drink this on a daily basis, no, and I probably won't try this again. Interesting, and I applaud the effort, but just not my thing."
"Very interesting flavors are present. Not sure what it can be compared to but by itself, it's a sipping beer that is worthy if you'd like to think outside the box on beer."
"Conclusion: Definitely an odd little number...I think people will probably either love or hate this beer...it's definitely worth a try, however, and the history on this beer is great...in small amounts, it would be really nice as an aperitif or paired with hors d'oeuvres."
"CHEERS!!"
"The taste is a bit more complex, i get the grape juice and some honey, there may even be a bit of hop flavor in the back there, but its faint. Over all this reminds me of Midas Touch a lot, just more expensive and not as good. Its an ok beer, but not worth the price."
"Pours up to a two finger head before rapidly evaporating to lilypads of foam across the surface, very little lacing. Crystal clear zinc orange color, fades to yellow at the outer edges. Sweet, estery nose of banana, grapes, apricot, brown baking sugar, cinnamon powder, honey, freshly squeezed orange juice, flowery like a hothouse, a blend of many distinct smells hard to parse apart. Medium-bodied, very low carbonation almost makes it drink like a still beverage. It's sweet yet, somehow, not as sweet as expected from the nose. Has a fruit juice feel, grapes blended with pear, apricot and yellow apple. The honey more dominant, less brown sugar or caramel. The tangerine citrus juicy and lends momentary tang. Very smoothly textured with a complete grip on the palate, you feel it everywhere. The floral musk takes up more space with each sip. There's a muscular lift to it, so perfumed that as it gathers around the roof of your mouth it starts to pleasantly dry out on the tongue. More interesting than compelling, a bottle to share not pound by yourself."
"D: Pretty drinkable for 8%! If you can get past (or enjoy) the grape soda-ness of this beer it would be easy to have a glass or two...or three. All in all, this is exactly what you think it will be coming from Dogfish...unique."
"Bring to a dinner party, give as a housewarming gift, or drink by yourself in your underwear in front of the TV... Any way you slice it this beer is awesome."
"An interesting beer. Kind of a novelty. It is worth a try however."
"M&D- The mouth is sweet with a medium body and some carb going for it. Goes down incredibly smooth without any huge hops getting in the way. The drinkability was good as well even though the beer list stated that this was 11%, I did not taste it at all, well masked. Kudos to DFH for having the balls to brew something like this and releasing it annually."
"Unfortunately, this is a big beer, otherwise it could easily be sessionable."
"The nose had a slightly sour lactic note with some great spices thrown in. The flavor of this brew is quite nice I really picked up the grape flavor as it warmed the spices were interesting the brew reminded me of a tropical drink in some ways as well. I split the bottle and recommend doing the same one glass was fantastic but anymore I think the spices would have overpowered my senses"
"Another interesting dogfish head beer based on an historical. Golden orangish color with a thin white head. Lite and bubbely mouthfeel. Taste is very strong of grapes and malt. Has a sake like finish. It is going down very easy. Worthwhile if you looking for a slightly sweet beer for 2."
"Note: improved some on warming. The honey taste becomes a bit more complex. Still very sweet."
"this one suffers hard on the drinkability factor. it just isnt worth its own hype. i paid about 14 bucks for the bottle and its taste does not seperate it from other more inexpensive beers. i applaud what dogfish is doing with all these ancient brews, but by todays standards this is nothing special. worth a try but perhaps this recipe should have stayed in the tomb. (just kidding, i admire any exploration into the world of brewing)."
"The one thing that I really appreciate about this beer is the origin and the courage it takes to reproduce a beer from a 9,000 year-old recipe. That alone is reason to try this brew."
"I really don't think these DFH brews are meant to be drinkable in the usual sense of the word; for example, I don't think any group freely sharing beers would need to open two of these. You get a sample and it's complex enough for you to appreciate it sip by sip. Still, this is the only one I've ever had...and I'm eager to get another."
"A 750ml bottle (great label art) shared with psycohops and brothercannon. Poured into a trio of snifters, this beer appears a mildly cloudy rich amber color with about a finger of fluffy, quickly fading off white foam. Tastes and aroma are of apples, white, red, and purple grapes, skin and all, honey, and spicy yeast. Syrupy mouthfeel, lightly carbonated (works well here). Rather unique and certainly worth a try at least once."
"Drinkability- It is extremely tasty. I could have finished the bottle by myself, but it's not something I'd drink all the time."
"Thanks to JJ21, I got to try this beer."
"A little to sweet to session but I drank about half the bottle no problem."
"I poured from a 25 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours orange with a minimal, fizzy head. It has a sweet aroma with hints of grapes. The flavor is sweet with hints of honey and grapes. The brew is light bodied, ligfhtly carbonated, with an bit of an acidic mouthfeel. For me the beer was a sipper, a bit too sweet. The brew was interesting for the historical aspects, but it was not for me."
"Poured a capped 750 into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a hazy golden honey with just a slight white head leaving no lacing. If head was just a slight bit more pronounced this would be an absolutely beautiful beer. The aroma is great. Honey is the most dominant aroma with floral notes (I'm guessing from the Chrysanthemum), a bit of toffee and just a slight alcohol burn. The flavor is amazing. This, in my mind, is my favorite beer that Dogfish Head makes. The flavor is huge wild honey, flowers, and Muscat grapes, with just a hint of the 8% alcohol. It all blends beautifully together. Magnificent. The honey hits the palate on full blast, slowly running through all the other flavors but never letting your tongue slip from that initial blast of honey. The mouthfeel is much fuller and creamier then I would have expected. Of all the crazy, ""Off Centered"" beers that Dogfish Head makes, this is the first one then I have had that really hit its mark."
"Drinkability- A little much on the fruit and spice, high ABV make this a tough one to down. I think one bomber's enough."
"I rate this as highly drinkable - smooth, good flavor, and a very well masked ABV. Worth whatever outrageous price I paid for it."
"Drinkablity - Not something I could drink more than a bomber of. Obviously extremely interesting to try but not what I would consider as a go to beer. Worth a try just to experience something different."
"Light and crisp enough to be easy to drink, especially on a warmer evening. Very good balance doesn't hurt, either."
"Pour is light orangish-blonde with a white head that settles quickly. Tastes like a mix between a belgian strong pale ale and muscat wine (again, they mentioned muscat in the ingredients used)..Tastes a bit like. a fruitier version of Midas Touch.. Is a tad bit acrid, especially in aftertaste, though there isn't much aftertaste (like a dry champagne)..The mouth is light but not thin and is again similar to a belgian pale. Overall its very easy to drink.. Very tasty and ""light"" all around, as in I could see drinking it in summer time.. Its sweet but not syrupy and not too estery either. not mind-blowing, but very good."
"D: The sweetness overpowers a bit and as a result the taste and drinkability suffer. However, if you are a white wine lover who also enjoys beer, this might be the beer for you. I appreciate the research that went into this brew. The backstory is great...the end result not so great."
"Pours a golden light yellow cloudy colored body, with some smallish white head, and small bubbles. Has a light floral, malty aroma, with some grapes, and alcohol. A nice floral taste, with sweet grape, and malts. Has an interesting flavor."
"Edit: The date on the bottle was '07, making this beer over a year old. It is bottle conditioned, but since I've only had this one bottle, I don't know how aging might have changed it."
"Overall very pleased with this brew."
"D: A pretty good beer with a very good combination of mouthfeel and taste. As I noted above, this beer was aged for two years and turned out the be very nice and smooth. A good beer overall, even after a few years of aging."
"Pours pale yellow with a fizzy, active head. Fizzy carbonation. Sour, malty aroma. Taste is bitter sweetness, some honey notes, a little sour. Overly carbonated. Points for a unique idea, but not a great beer. DFH could do better."
"Very much worth the 18 dollar price I paid for it at the Cork & Keg in Salem, VA and will go there again and get this."
"Pours a hazy orange with a thick head that disappears and leaves no lacing and only sparse bubbles that cling to the sides. Some floaties in the glass, maybe some yeast or protein coagulation. Smell is really interesting. Lots of pear and grape, notes of honey - quite intriguing. Taste is somewhat tart and then finishes in a white grape taste. Some residual sweetness lingers on the tongue. Seems like more carbonation would benefit this beer as the mouthfeel is a bit thin to carry the alcohol effectively. Definitely an interesting beer, but one that might be a bit of a challenge to down the whole bottle by myself."
"A very different beer from anything else I've had. Pours cloudy gold with almost no head and no carbonation. Honey, muscat grapes, and earthiness in the nose. Drinks like a liquer/port. Lots of honey and grapes, solid malt back, anmd a dirty/vegetable/fruit flavor throughout. Interesting break from normal beers, but not a regular in the rotation."
"I have conspicuously avoided spiced and flavored beers, but the success of this tasting has opened a new door of experimentation that I must enter, I fear."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a foamy white head that fades into a thin lacing. Aroma of honey, grape, apple, pear as well as a strong alcohol presence. Very sweet with lots of honey, grape and apple up front. Also, hints of citrusy orange and alcohol. Although it is quite sweet the slight maltiness gives it a nice balance preventing it from becoming too tart. Very refreshing."
"The aroma is floral, sweet, buttery, and spicy. The appearance is a hazy orange, thin white head. The taste is complex, mix of grapes, honey, butter, and rice. Sweet and spicy at the same time. The finish is fairly clean, sweet, and yet a spicy ending on the palate, as if from hops, but maybe from added spices. Relatively thick, oily mouthfeel. I love these ""traditional"" or ""historic"" ales, and I actively seek them out. My rating generally reflects this love of ancient beer recreations."
"Drinkability - This is definitely a sharing beer to bust out with some friends. There is no way that I could finish a bottle of this by myself."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a nice mellow carbonation. The beer goes down easily and is refreshing. Overall, apart from being a tad too sweet, this is a tasty brew and the fact that it is recreated from an ancient recipe is pretty cool as well. This one is worth checking out."
"This was an interesting experience that I liked but not one that I care to repeat any time soon."
"Hard to find in SoCal, but I'd buy again."
"quality"
"Is it drinkable? Yeah, I guess so. Jiahu is frankly a must try for lovers of extreme, different or just flat-out interesting beer because there is nothing else like it. One of Sam's crazy ideas that works."
"This stuff is meh. Had it on bottle down in ocean city md one night after buying it at a singles shop. Poured it into a tankard. Chunks of little stuff floating in the beer. Grape chunks? I dunno. Sweet, but very strong taste. Tastsed more like a wine than a beer. Definitely not a chugger."
"This beer is yet again another mind-blowing-how-did-they-do-it? What labourous research went into this recreation? It is really amazing to think of drinking the same beverage as people 9000 years ago in the Ancient Middle East. Depite being extremly well-balanced and highly drinkable, this is an example of Mr. Calagione's extreme level of talent and ingenuity he applies to his craft."
"Drinkability- I like juice, and this is amazing for something to have with breakfast in place of orange or some other juice. I love it, what can I say?"
"Somewhat sweet nose, crystalized fruits, banana, smooth texture. Light carbination. Somewhat like a Midas Touch, toned down sweet and funk though. This beer can age, best shared with friends. An interesting brew and not a lot of others that are even somewhat similar. Hats off for that. Not one of my favorite brews but good marks for how different it is."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. It does have a lot of chardonnay character to it but still retained some beer qualities to it. It was very easy to drink at 9%ABV (which is what was printed on the bottle)."
"Cheers!"
"D - A great ale w/ very unique flavors--refreshing, yet strong crisp and malty w/ sweet and spicy elements. A definite A beer inspired from ancient times w/ sake aspects. An intriguing work by a pioneering brewery w/ an off-center 'tude. The drinkability is very good w/ flavor that is bold, yet graceful and blends almost seemlessly."
"Poured golden drink into a tulip glass which supported the very small, white head for about a half minute. Low clarity. Smells overtly of grapes. Fairly light body fizzes with grapes on the tongue leaving a distinct taste unknown to me (maybe it is the hawthorn fruit). This after taste - slightly bitter and acidic lingers and encourages frequent sips. The alcohol warmth is mild - mostly in my throat. Really, not what I was expecting. I was expecting something sweeter. Though it is sweet, it is mild enough to enjoy a few glasses. A unique beer worth a try - I just wonder how close dogfish head got the recipe...I'd like to think its the same as it was 9000 years ago."
"Very unique beer."
"Pours hazy gold with a minimal white head. Aroma of honey and rice. Tatse is honey sweet up front to a alcohol/citrus/cereal grain finish. Has an old ale feel to it, but I ouldn't call it an old ale. More interesting than good. Not bad at all, but not worth the price."
"A wonderful beer. Many thanks to DFH for making this."
"This was a unique brew from Dogfish Head. I enjoyed it chilled in my Duvel bubbler. Poured a light golden color. Smelled of honey and tart white grapes, couldn't really detect the rice though. The taste was good, I noticed the muscat grapes because I have had muscat wine before. There was a hint of honey and a slight tartness in the finish."
"Overall: Pretty unique, but no where near DFH best offering. It has a light mead type character which is nice. It's a sipper that should be consumed in small quantites. I would have probably rated it a bit higher in taste had the metallic taste not been there. The combination of sweet and metallic just didn't sit right with me."
"Was served to me with no head, very little carbonation, a flat, gleaming, thick orange. Smells of fruit: melons, apricot, apple. The first sip immediately hit me as ""apple juice"" but via further tastes I really got a lot of honey, apple, and floral notes out of it along with just enough of a feeling of alcohol to remind you you're not just drinking apple juice, if maybe a little weak. Mouthfeel is a light to medium body- very refreshing and nice for spring/summer. I'd probably have another one of these but the dominance of honey and fruit flavors doesn't really make me think I'm drinking a beer... more like some exotic mellow wine. Very interesting though."
"I'm impressed with the label without even trying the beer yet, nice attractive topless woman with a beer in hand what more could you ask for. But back to the task at hand, the first pour into an oversized wine glass produced a moderate amount of head and had an aroma of white grape juice. Nice light golden orange color to it that was very clear and could see the carbonation thru it. When it touched my lips I got hints of honey and at some points in time I got a Budweiser kind of taste which might have been due to the rice that was used in the brewing . The second pour yielded a very fine sediment from the bottom of the bottle and the color looked different and had more of a translucent orange look, not as crystal clear as the first pour. Taste changed a little too and I got some sort of spice to it but I cannot describe it, only that it left sort of a powdery feel in my mouth. As I was drinking this one it was interesting to think that thousands of years ago someone could have been enjoying a similar drink. Once again I am impressed with the unique brews that Dogfish Head comes up with. Never been disappointed yet!!"
"Overall, a fine brew."
"Drinkability is fair, this tastes like a hybrid between a mead and a cider with the focus on honey and fruits, interesting in small doses, better suited for after-dinner sipping than social drinking"
"An ""experimental"" brew that is unique and tasty. This is one to have if in the mood for ""something different"" and candyish."
"Cloudy orange pour with a quickly fading head. Smell is corn and rice like malty sweetness with notes of grapes as well. Taste is fairly sweet, notes of corn, rice, again along with a slight hint of grape too. Light bitterness in the finish, but sweet beyond that in the aftertaste. Interesting, but slightly cloying and very lagery corn like. Good for sharing but probably not in large amounts."
"d-- its good - you would have to adjust to drink a lot of this to become accustomed to this"
"M/D: Smooth and light. Like iced tea, but not beer."
"As an archaeologist, I fully appreciate what Dogfish is doing here (and any attempt at historifal recreation/adaptation) & can't wait until the Aztec cocoa beer they're coming out with."
"Aggressive pour barely gives a head, what it does give goes away within minutes. Lacing is non existent. Color is light orangish, small amount of carbonation bubbles floating to the top. Smell is amazing, fruity, honey, spices. Taste is sweet and then bitter as it goes to the back of the tongue, but not overly. Slightly carbonated on the tongue, after taste is a little warm. I'm having no problems finishing the bottle. A tasty beverage fo shizzle."
"note: were there muscat grapes in late neolithic china?"
"D: I don't think I'd go for another, but I'd finish this one. It's not something that amazed me so much I want to come back to it, but it was definitely interesting and tasty. Worth a try for sure."
"D - Good beer, good flavor but can only enjoy a little bit, can't drink a whole bottle in one sitting, too sweet."
"This beer poured a very clear head with a quickly dissipating head. The aroma is yeasty and a fruit smell is noticeable. The taste is sweet and fruity. It reminds me of some of the meads Ive had. The mouthfeel is light and seems to be quite appropriate for the style, although, it does seem a bit under carbonated. Overall, this is a light and easy to drink beer  but it tastes more like a wine or mead than a beer."
"Poured into a tulip glass, pours a very clear bright gold with a head that builds up well but falls very fast. I wasn't exactly sure what the aroma is until I just learned there is Chrysanthemum in it, and that's what I would describe it as... mildly flowery. As it warms I sense some fruit, maybe the grapes coming through. The taste is a bit floral and very earthy. Maybe a bit of sweetness from the honey and fruit. Overall the earthiness dominates. Lighter mouthfeel, but the texture is pretty smooth. And interesting flavor but not something I would reach for a whole lot."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The most gentle, easy seafoaminess registers nicely on the scale... I would love to have had more texture though. This is very good, but it simply doesn't fashion well by itself. A fresh, crunchy vegetable crudité with ranch dressing would be perfect though."
"D - Again because it was so sweet I consider this an after dinner beer or a dessert beer. Not a session beer by any means. Again just too sweet."
"D: An interesting beer historically and taste-wise, and I'm glad I finally got to try it, although 750mL's was kind of a lot at the end of the night. A good beer to crack open with a friend and watch the History Channel."
"Drinkability again has to be compared to a nice sweet white wine which in my book is high. Beer? Wine? Mead? Doesn't matter, it's a fine drink for special occasions, such as New Years Day!"
"Pours a thickly clouded gold that gives a small amount of white head off a very aggressive pour. Nose is like sugar, fruit, mild honey, and grapes. Flavor is really odd and unique. Sweet. Tangy. Definite muscat grapes there. Heavily influence a lot of the flavor and feel. Speaking of feel. It is thick with a syrupy attribute. Falls off on the edge and leaves a watery ending feel but with a somewhat lasting syrup edge on the tongue. Definitely drinkable. Might be a bit too unique for a few, but overall definitely worth taking a shot at."
"Bottled 8/28/06, kept in my cellar since Jan 07. Pours a brilliant orange-amber, but hazy. Little head, no lace. The orange character is almost neon. Aroma is honey and hawthorn, with hints of orange peel. No hop aroma. Some slight musty/yeasty character. Flavor is honey and hawthorn again, with more orange peel and perhaps a touch of champagne flavor (perhaps from the muscat grapes?). Overall it comes across very balanced and complex. Sweet upfront, fading into a pleasant tartness. Body is medium to full. Tail is all balance, with both the sweetness and tartness lingering and pleading for more."
"Poured into my DFH glass a nice semi-hazy golden yellow color, nice carbonation, fizzy little white head, which leaves some sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, slightly yeasty, some spices, honey, hawthrowne berries, and a touch of caramel. The taste is sweet up front, malty/yeasty, nice little touch of spicyness, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one, a different brew for me, recommended."
"Drinkability- Another quality brew from Dogfish. Great melding flavors and great texture. Think I'm going to buy another to take back home with me."
"Overall this was quite unique. Something that was very much different then most other things I had tried. There was a certain amount of oldness to it. Kind of weird having something that has been consumed in one form for thousands of years but it works very well. Lots of honey and rice and a good deal of sediment. This was something I would try again with no issue. It was definitely interesting and was worth the price."
"Drinkability- A nice relaxing beer to share with someone and hold a conversation about it."
"Drinkability: I often feel in danger of seeming as though I'll drink anything, but then I reconsider and decide that enjoying most things I drink merely shows what a discerning buyer I am. I had my doubts going in as to whether this beer would even manage average drinkability, and my fears were soon put to rest. While I wouldn't necessarily drink this every day, this is a solidly enjoyable beer-like beverage that manages to integrate the disparate ingredients exceedingly well. It's also a perfect crossover beverage, with aspects that appeal to both the wine aficionado and the beer geek (as well as your weird friend who loves all things Asian and wishes that he were a giant robot with breasts--you know the one I'm talking about)."
"D = Not sure what to say. I guess I would drink it again. It might be a good choice for a snowy afternoon just hanging out watching it come down with a fire going. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine drinking it often and certainly is only good in small quantities. On the other hand I only drank about half the bottle and couldn't bring myself to drink the rest."
"D. Hard to get. Higher abv. Would still love to cellar this beer and try it over the next few holiday dinners."
"I would recommend trying this if you like a range of beers or are open to a beer with very un-beer characteristics."
"While Dogfish Head gets their share of naysayers, i generally like the innovative spirit of the company. This is another interesting selection, which, like most of their stuff, has its place on my palate when looking i'm looking for something beyond a well crafted selection of a specific style. Oh, and for those who don't like drinking sediment, simply don't shake up the bottle too much, and don't drain it down to the bottom. I suppose you could also decant it down. So anyway, pretty tasty, and a pretty awesome concept, in both brewing and historical terms."
"Flowing like the waters of Yangtze before the Three Gorges Dam, it fills the glass with a slightly hazy orange, the head a huge pile of frothy white, which erodes slowly, the resultant lacing, a complete coat to hide the glass. Nose, a phenomenal blend of aromas, honey, grapes, barley, rice, Hawthorn fruit, Chrysanthemum flowers, yeast, what a lineup, and they all blend perfectly. Ambrosial start, with a twang at the back, top feels moderate to the palate. Finish is modestly acidic, sweet, flowery and dry aftertaste nails itself to the taste buds, what a brew, what a marvelous concoction of grains, flowers and fruit, a true one of a kind masterpiece of the brewers art."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale. Its abv limits sessionability, and also this would seem to be something to go with dinner and/or dessert, rather than serve as a session beer."
"750 ml bottle, bottled on 7/10/07. Served in a pint glass, it pours clear gold with a half inch white head. Not much head retention or lacing. It smells like honey, grain, apricots and grapes. There's also an aroma that reminds me of Budweiser for some reason (not in a bad way), I can't exactly explain it. Taste is fruity and sweet. It tastes pretty much the same way it smells, except there's a bit of a spicy and floral taste too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with a bit of a syrupy feel. Drinkability is OK. Alcohol is noticable, but it's not overpowering. It's another unique brew from Dogfish Head, that's for sure. I'd have to be in a certain mood to drink this again but I would revisit this in the future."
"Cheers to Sam, and everyone at DFH for a job well done on this one."
"Poured from a 750ML bottle, this strange fluid pours a medium yellow color, with highlights of light honey. Active carbonation bubbles soar to the surface of the liquid in the large white wine glass Im using to review this beer. The rather thin head is tight and quite sticky, leaving spots of lacing inside the glassware. The nose is quite simply otherworldly  is this beer or possibly a complex white wine? The Muscat grapes used in this beer are present right from the start and lend a very unusual wine-like bouquet to the nose, making you think you might be drinking a sparkling white wine instead of a (technically) beer. Slightly sweet on the nose as well, the wildflower honey is evident and makes one think a bit of a mead. This is either one of the most complex beers ever, or it has a serious identity crisis. Slight floral notes, which I can only assume is from the chrysanthemum, are very inviting as well. The nose is, quite honestly, more like a wine or a mead than a beer, on first blush. The palate does not pale in comparison to the nose, but grants a fuller picture of what the nose only hints at. Again, a sparkling white wine comes to mind, but the mouth feel is obviously thicker and the initial flavor substantially sweeter. The sweetness subsides a little bit as the beer sits in the mouth, and yields to a spicier, fruitier composition that reminds me of a good Belgian tripel. Without a doubt though, the honey and the grapes are dominant on the palate. The finish is moderately dry, and the carbonation is just adequate to keep this beer from being sticky and cloying. In a nutshell, this beer has a lot going on all at once. Im a little bit torn whether it all melds together masterfully, or its just a little outside the realm of congruence. Whatever your take is, however, this is clearly a well-crafted and seriously complex beer that defies style and stretches the palate in a very good way. I think if you really like a Belgian Tripel, or maybe even a saison, youll at least appreciate this beer. For me, I genuinely like it and would like to revisit it again. Like anything new, a beer that is this unique takes some getting used to. Dogfish Head does it again."
"I bought this beer with no expectations. Having tasted it I don't quite no what to make of it. I like it, but I can't quite recommend it. The closest parallel I can make to it is #9: tasty, sweet, but not an over the top fruity beer. This is unarguably a more serious beer than #9, but it's not ubiquitous or cheap like #9, so the comparison is unfair. I might need to experiment by feeding this to a more feminine palate..."
"Overall: I like the extremely old school beers that Dogfish has been brewing lately. While most of their modern stuff strikes me as merely ok, both Midas and this, Jiahu, have hit a sweet spot with me, literally. I will definitely be picking this up again."
"Full mouthfeel with a creamy lightness. Interesting taste,more of a sipper,goes down easy,not something i would want to drink a lot of. Seems like a good beer to age with the wine-like feel throughout."
"Beer pours out a dark golden color, not too far off from some macro lagers. Gives a very small head, with a small ring of lacing. Smell was mild, some light malt and rice, with honey seeming to come through in both smell and taste. The taste is mildly sweet, full of that honey and some spices. Mouthfeel somewhat syrupy to me. All in all, above average, but not great."
"Pours a hazy apricot/orange with numerous slow-moving bubbles, distributed evenly throughout the glass, making their way to the thin ring of lace that sits atop the beer. Aroma has a very clean ""rice beer"" aroma along with some mild graininess and medicinal qualities. I pick up some honey and pholics along with a hint of alcohol. Flavor starts off with a punch of cloying sweetness and fermented rice flavors (think Bud). In the middle comes a mild yet bright tartness along with some floral notes and some fruitiness that does not taste as if derived from fermentation by-products. Finishes with a bit of dryness and a return of the somewhat heavy phenlic edge. Aftertaste is rather sugary, in spite of the relatively dry finish. Mouthfeel is rather sticky and jagged (with concerns to the carbonation). Overall, I enjoy this, in a way, but honestly, this reminds me of a boozier Budweiser with a touch of cloying sweetness, a mild tart presence, and some odd phenolics (and an over-the-top price tag). Impressed? I am more so by the idea rather than the execution."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with virtually no head at all. The aroma is decent. It has a fruity scent that smells of grapes and honey. I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of the aroma, but whatever. The taste is decent as well. It has a wine taste to it. There are flavors of honey and fruit with a bland grape juice flavor. The mouthfeel is average. It is a full bodied brew with less than adequate carbonation. I'm really not impressed with Dogfish Head's new brew additions. I guess they're cool and innovative, but I'm totally uninterested."
"I dig the historical research behind this, and actually dig the reinterpretation quite a bit too. I never much cared for their other foray into the past, Midas Touch. But I'd do this again. The numbers I've assigned are more or less meaningless, because it is incomparable to anything. A ""mood"" beverage for sure, but I think it was pulled off well."
"A very nice offering, I will have to get some more of this while this batch is available. Bottled July 10, 2007."
"D: Not my favorite by far, but another wonderful brew from one of my favorite brewers."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades slowly leaving traces of lace. Cloudy almost pale amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Grape nose. Flavor is grape at first but then a sweet/tartness from the hawthorn, hops are in the background. Clean finish. Interesting beer. $10.90 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME. Bottled on Jul 11, 2007."
"Overall: Very cool to be drinking a 9000 year old recipe--in fact, it's one of the reasons I want to homebrew more is to do historic recipes. While this is interesting and nice, it doesn't tickle my fancy that much. Good but not something I'll buy again in spite of my love and respect for Dogfish to make beer like this--though, I did buy this one $12 bottle in the name of the cause, nor can I say I was disappointed--just not overwhelmed and expect it was a tremendous ale 9 millenia ago."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a shallow wispy fizzy white head that fades fairly rapidly. Very light lacing. The smell is kind of nice. I get honey and grapes mostly with a little apple and spice. Light bodied, the mouth feel is mild and creamy yet adequately carbonated. The flavor is soft, sweet and fruity; a little apple lightly spiced. A little like a mellow apple-pear marainge . Finishes with a lingering orchard fruitiness. The alcohol is well hidden in the mouth, but it is a warmer on the way down. Enjoyable, kudos; scores points for imagination. I am definitely going to snag another... or so."
"Pours a pale orange-ish yellow with a small white head. Aromas of honey, spices, and a sweet malt. In the taste, honey is quite predominate, and a lemon citrus charicteristic. A clean mouthfeel with an aftertaste of honey and a small presence of something like medicinal. I liked the dry honey taste. Easy to drink and quite different."
"Pours a nice reddish orange, quite cloudy. Very little head and no real lacing, but hey, who knows what beer looked like way back when. For now, I'm not complaining. The smell is fruity with orange, something berrylike,and a waxiness and earthiness from the rice. The taste is smooth, complicated and interesting. An underlying red rice flavor seems evident, similar to a red rice saki- waxy and earthy notes. There are also substantial honey flavors, so there is a meadlike feel as well. Some slight astringent notes from the Hawthorne. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Very interesting and quite drinkable- I also love the archaelogical beer project, let's keep them coming!"
"D - I think this is a very drinkable, and I just love it overall. I guess if you aren't in the mood for a light, sweet, refreshing drink then this isn't the best choice, but on a Friday after a hot work day, this was perfect for me."
"Overall, a tasty and very interesting brew. IMO better than Midas Touch though along the same lines. Recommended."
"I was excited to try this one, but my hopes weren't so high for it because I'm not really big on fruity spicy beers. It poured a cool, cloudy November orange with no head at all. There was a lot of suspended yeast and some precipitate as well. Smell was spicy and fruity, a lot like cider with notes of herbaceous plants. It tasted a lot like a hard cider to me, the grapes were noticeable and so was the honey-lent sweetness. It was light and spicy in the mouth, though the taste of the alcohol wasn't very prevalent, the feeling of it was there. I wasn't nuts about this one, and wouldn't be inclined to drink more than the pint I had when I shared the bottle of this with my dad. Not a bad one-off though, It wasn't for me, but other people might be more inclined to like it."
"Drinkability: Very high. The smoothness of the beer combined with the mid-range alcohol make this very easy, and very tasty, to drink. A very worthwhile addition to Dogfish's lineup this year. Highly recommended."
"Comes out of the bottle a nice clear golden-amber with a hint of orange. Aroma is crisp and hoppy with a bit of an alcohol bite and a touch of citrus. Flavor is hoppy, crisp and edgy, with some malt element and a strong orange hint - rather different from other beers I have tried, perhaps because the recipe is supposed to be 9,000 years old. It is smooth with just a little bitterness and a hint of orange flavor in the aftertaste."
"Usually I like Dogfish Head beers, but this one was a little diffrent. The wife and I bought it (along with some other beers) at Wells in Towson, and drank it last night. Right after the pour, there was a TON of floaties in there. I've had this beer before and it was nothing like this one. I remember dogfish saying there were really into quality control, but I guess they missed one. I still drank it though, as it tasted ok. Smell was probably the best thing about it. I dont think I'll get this one again."
"I guess based on the uniqueness alone, I'd weakly recommend it."
"Another good beer from Dogfish Head."
"This is not a drinking man's beer. There is a lot unusual flavor to this offering. With an open mind, this can be a great beer to test. That said, it isn't my style as I prefer more hoppy beers, but I'm glad I have had a chance to try it."
"D very good. I usually don't like such sweet beveriges but this does the trick on a hot day"
"D: I've had this a few times, and will continue to drink it from time to time. It's not an every-day beer, but it's a nice change of pace from time to time."
"750ml bottle: Mine poured into the glass with a bit of fizziness, but no head to speak of and what was there was gone almost instantly. The color is a cloudy, orange hued dark golden. The aroma is nice. Hints of spices and slightly orange to the nose. Maybe pears and honey too. Somewhat sweet, with notes of pears and honey to the taste. Also some spiciness. This is really good. It is interesting that someone may have been sipping a similar concoction 9000 years ago. Another fine and creative beer from a great brewery."
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a golden yellow color ale with a nice white head with average retention and not much lacing. Aroma of malt is weak with some sweetness probably coming from honey. Taste is quit sweet with honey dominating and some light spices also noticeable. Body is about average with some good carbonation and no alcohol was noticeable. Overall, I thought this lack complexity and was slightly too sweet for my palate. Definitely not the best from this great brewery."
"Pours a cloudy lemony color. Mine had more than a few suspended particles and a minimal head. Faintly floral aroma. The flavor is a nice, crisp pear-pineapple with a good bite on the back of the tongue. The alcohol makes its presence felt in a nice way, with a gentle warming at the end and just a hint of burn. A very nice change of pace."
"Drinkability: Thanks, but no thanks. So far, I haven't been a big fan of these ""residue beers""."
"Considering how bizarre this is, the relative sweetness, and the fact that it is 8,0%abv, I feel that this is rather drinkable, and have no problem at all finishing a 750mL by myself. Certainly one of the better strange or specialty offerings from DFH, IMO."
"Not something I'd want to drink often, or even a whole bottle of, but not bad and worth trying!"
"A very easy and interesting beer to drink. A bit of novelty, not sure if I'd pay the steep price they charge for this. But more kudos to Dogfish Head for brewing these creative beers!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is on the light side. I think I would like a bit more carbonation to this brew. The beer is very easy to drink and as stated previously stated I want more. This 750 ml bottle passed very quickly. Thanks DFH for yet one more envelope pushing beer!"
"Drinkability: I approached this with some trepidation as Dogfish Head has been hit or miss with me; but this one knocks it out of the park; well-blended with tremendous complexity"
"Thanks to crwills for this treat!"
"I never know what to expect from one of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery's experimental ales. Midas Touch, to use but one example, was less than compelling. Chateau Jihau is another matter entirely. It has an interesting back story and is, much more importantly, delicious beer. It probably doesn't much resemble what the Chinese were drinking 9000 years ago, but it's fun to pretend. I have no regrets about spending $8.99 for the bottle."
"I would recommend letting this sit before drinking. This was an interesting experiment, and I'm glad I got to try it, though I feel no need to come back."
"This is one unique brew, I don't think I'll buy it again, but interesting none the less."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly good for such a strange beer. The story is a plus, too."
"This is not much unlike some Belgian brews being produced today."
"Drinkability is quite good. It goes down easily, as it is less harsh and dry than a white wine. DFH seems to specialize in these wine-like brews, to awesome effect...this is another one that has the potential to show wine drinkers exactly what ""beer"" can do. Pricey, yes, but you should try this at least once if you can find it."
"Honey-sweet enough to be flawlessly drinkable, but yeasty enough to not be cloying. You could seriously build a civilization around this beer. A must try."
"Overall: Thanks go out to ggaughan for hooking me up with this beer. Thanks again for a great trade."
"Opinion: This is an interesting experiment. It comes across to me a bit like their Midas Touch in that it seems to be as much of a carbonated wine as a beer. The sweetness is a bit much in this beer, and the spices dont balance it, but challenge it. I like the complexity of the flavors and how it is difficult to pick out any one thing in particular. This is a pretty good drink, but I can't imagine that I will be making a habit out of drinking this. I think that regarding these wine/beers, I like the Midas better. Still, keep it up, Sam!"
"Poured a hazy yellow much like a hefeweizen or an apple cider. Little head to speak of. Smells of grapes and honey, pears, perhaps of licorice as well. Taste is sweet, but not sweetened if that makes sense. Has a bit of rice flavor to it. Mouthfeel is nice and mellow, a bit dry, perhaps as a result of using the sake yeast. Overall, a nice and unusual brew. Definitely worth a try, but some others may be put off by the fact that it doesn't really taste like anything else I can think of. Quite different from the other DFH brews."
"Chateau Jiahu pours a hazy golden color with a white head from a brown 25.6 ounce bottle. The aroma is dominated by grape. The taste is also of grapes, with a beery aftertaste. Definitely kind of an odd beer, worth a try if you like this sort of thing."
"Drinkability - pricy but interesting. A good pick for a tasting of unique beers."
"Very interesting."
"I'll admit, I'm always intrigued by the DFH archaeological endeavors, but they don't always translate to the current day. This time, though, the result is a brew that, if accurate, would seem to be as enjoyable today as it was way back when in China. The aroma was too busy, and I'd call it the only real off-note. And while the ABV is typically Dogfish-obvious, it's not so big that it limits unduly. I finished the one bottle willingly, and while a second might be pushing it, I'd drain another any time I found it in front of me. Hey, maybe they could market this in China and Sam could tap into the biggest potential beer market on the planet!"
"D: Delicious beer, but this beer is a lot like Disneyland; good place to visit but you dont want to be there every day. Gets a bit cloying after a while but it comes with the territory. I salute Dogfish Head for unarchiving these recipes and I appreciate these beers."
"Certainly a unique concoction that defies the boundaries of style. Pleasant for the novelty, but not an ale that I'd go back to. Props to DFH for keeping the 8% abv almost completely hidden."
"Chateau Jiahu poured a light, cloudy amber with good head development despite what appeared to be lazy carbonation in the glass. Aroma was fruity and alcoholic with both sour and sweet notes, neither of which were overpowering. Pleasant smell overall, very similar to Dogfish Head's Midas Touch. Taste was sweet and somewhat wine-like. This beer has a very mellow fruitiness to it. Not what I would typically drink, but good. Mouthfeel is dry and smooth with well developed carbonation, despite my earlier visual observations. Moderate to high alcohol content lends to a warming sensation. Not bad for an herbed/spiced beer, although I prefer Midas Touch over this recipe."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle with a bottled on date (8/06) laser printed on the neck. The label was really neat and featured a Chinese woman with a tatoo on her lower back - tasteful unlike most of the crap you see out there. It had a nice golden honey color with a bit of orange - slightly hazy. It had about half a finger of head and a ton of initial carb. Both settled down quickly. The smell was a strong fruity smell dominated by grapes. There was also a good spicy kick in there as well. The taste followed the smell with really good fruitiness and spices to offset the sweet. It's not what you normally expect in a beer and in my mind is closer to a sweet wine but I enjoyed it. The 750ml is too much for me. A 12oz bottle every couple years would be enough (or a big bottle to share with a group). Recommend trying because of the uniqueness and history. (3.5, RB, ML, O)"
"Overall, i think this is one worth trying for the sake of what it is. I the the high amount of sweetness gives it more uniqueness that i can see many people not liking. If i was not in the mood for something sweet, i probably would not have enjoyed it as much. So wait for your sugartooth to come before opening this one up."
"Not something I would keept on hand, but a novel taste experience worth trying."
"what more can I say? Beautiful."
"Chateau Jiahu is the first malt beverage my wife could actually down a glass of. Calling this a beer is probably not right. It's more like a mead to me."
"Pours a cloudy golden peach color with orange highlights and a fluffy white head. Nose is quite floral with notes of honeysuckle, rose, and chrysanthemum along with a light fruitiness of ripe banana and champagne grapes as well as a bit of perfume. Taste begins with sweet tropical fruit and honey nectar along with flowery chrysanthemum followed and balanced by powdery yeast, a grape tartness, and peppery alcohol. Quite unique. Be sure not to have this beer too coldnear room temperature seems ideal."
"~E. Brad"
"D - This says it is fermented with Sake yeast, but I thought Sake was fermented with Aspergillus? Oh well. Honestly, I think this drinks like a crappy white wine. I am glad I didn't live in ancient China. Interesting . . . yes. Worth purchasing . . . no. It isn't worth trying, it seems like it is, but the flavor are not exotic, they are mundane, mix of cup of cheap reisling with a Colt 45 and you are pretty much on target. I definitely won't buy this again. The only way anyone should try it is if they buy it with some freinds."
"Definitely a sugary beer, but not cloying in a syrupy or alarmingly-sweet way. Also not the utterly incredible concoction we tend to expect from Dogfish Head. (those who dislike sweet beers might as well not even bother with it, considering the price.) It's a different sort of experience, and there's something to be said for that. When it comes to DFH's historical brews, Midas Touch is better, but this one is still worth the time and effort."
"Somewhat interesting, but not enough to buy again."
"*Taster's Note: Thanks to amatuerbeerguy for sharing this one!"
"My numbers reflect my overall impression of this brew...nice appearance, great nose, overpowering honey midtaste & finish."
"I'm glad I bought this one. Was on a recommendation from Mike's mom at Brawley's in Charlotte, N.C. My only concern was the price. 15 bucks a pop is steep."
"A little disappointing for fifteen dollars, but an experience I wanted to have knowing the origin of the recipe. That being said I wish this beer were rougher around the edges, it definitely displays the brewing know-how of a highly respectable craft brewery. I think Dogfish Head should have made an attempt to make this beer a little more authentic, perhaps not filtered it as much, maybe guessed at the bottling point instead of measuring metabolization rates."
"Interesting sweet, unique. Decent appearance. head fades fast. Nice cloudy appearance though. Smell was very nice a little bit of banana phenol. Taste was unique. Tastes a little funky. No hops detected, however there are some bitter notes (only slightly). However, nice malt, has a nice fruitiness to it. A lot going on and a funkiness with yeast. Very interesting. A great brew to give wine drinkers and beer drinkers a like. Dogfish head is becoming one of my favorite breweries. They are unique and adventures. Off-centered ales for off-centered people. Well I'm a little off-centered I guess and I love there beers and will continue to pay top dollar to get them shipped to me. Very nice."
" The body is medium, and there is something tannic about this beer. I am having no problem drinking the 750ml, but I would not pop another one tonight."
"I admire the effort behind this brew. It's good, and it's a really cool idea. I didn't like their Midas Touch as much (which was similar), but it was priced much better. At $12-13 for a bottle, this is a one off for me. If it were $7 or 8 I could see getting it again, though. I think the concept of an ancient beverage is definite success, but it's more of a novelty unless it were cheaper."
"I get a bit of booze as well and some yeasty dough notes. The beer seems incomplete in my opinion, did fermentation not run its full course? Not very impressed with this brew, even though it has a good story and interesting recipe."
"Yet another unique beer rolled out from the Dogfish Head brewery in Delaware. This one lives up to their standards as something you typically wont find from any other brewer in the world. The idea came when a professor from the University of PA asked to recreate an alcoholic beverage that was recently discovered in 9000 year old clay pots. The beer itself still tastes like a fruit or spiced beer, but it has its own uniqueness as well. Sweet with a little bit of offsetting spice. No hops are used in this beer, so it is not susceptible to skunking. If you are drinking one by yourself, watch out for the alcohol. It isnt easily detectable so it can sneak up on you. Recommended for a try, but Im sure you will like it."
"The spice in this one are not as blunt and overpowering as they are with many other Herbed/Spiced ales out there, and, personally, I think that makes it a lot more drinkable. Plus, the delicate fruit flavors of the palate are quite nice. Recommended."
"D: The ale is interesting, worth a look, like Midas Touch, for the unusual history behind it. This beer will never be a go-to drink, but it is interesting and innovative, as Dogfish Head seems to do consistently."
"Drinkability: I would serve this as you would a sweet sparkling wine. It's really an interesting beer but the whole bomber is a bit much for one person. An excellent pair with white chocolate."
"Drinkability is good but this is definitely not a ""football game"" beer. It is enjoyable to drink but a 750 mL bottle is a bit much for one person. Overall, this is a very unique beer that I was happy to sample regardless of the strengths or weaknesses."
"A taste of sweetness is present first, from the honey, and then the spices kick in. Out of nowhere, the grape juice hits my palate. It appears to be sweet, but not too sweet, but I am still searching for hops...i still can't find them. The tail end of the glass has a warm cider-ish feel to it...maybe its the idea of a 9000 year old recipe being accessible or maybe I am just warm and tingly from another fantastic Dogfishhead brew."
"Pours a cloudy orange honey color with a small white head. The head leaves no lacing and disappears quickly. The smell is alittle weak with grapes,honey, some spices, and some unknow sweetness. The taste is very different. Very wine like makes this an unusual beer. Honey,grapes, apples, lemon, sweet malt, and a ""bisquity"" flavor make out this beer. The m/f is medium and creamy with all the flavors mixing well. This beer is a little tough to drink more than one,but kudos to Dogfish Head for trying something different."
"I was a little wary about this beer but I thought I would give it a try. I really did not like Midas Touch and thought this beer may be like that but this is totally different. Worth a shot but the price makes this a one time deal, atleast for me."
"i can dig these wineified beers to some degree though i think the wine could stand to be scaled down in favor of more malt"
"Appears a cloudy golden orange apricot tone with a large effervescent cream head leaves specks of even lacing Bocktown's house Unibroue chalice. Aromatics come straight up with deep honey and mild herbal grassy qualities, rice grains for the creamy edge, a touch of orange blossom slash rose petal slash lavender defnitely perfumish what a great smelling brewsky. Flavors blend well with the honey not becoming overbearing at any point in the drinking session, mild soft rice sweetness tart profile also comes with an earthy grape seed vinous character and evident alcohol peeking through and once again finishes with a wild herbal lavender kinda overall fruity apricotish tang. Mouthfeel is heavenly on the palate flows nicely, easily medium bodied with some sticky textured honey traces not quite syrupy. Drinkability a rare treat that should be sampled with friends this big bottle could become a chore but definitely a beer I would like to revisit..."
"Mouthfeel is really good too--the carbonation kind of balances out the sweetness--makes it less heavy. Drinkability is good too--I'm going to drink the rest of the bottle and wish I had more after it."
"Drinkability: Average. I was disappointed in the actual taste of this beer. The smell and appearance are such wonderful experiences that the flat taste is a bit of a disappointment. However, if this is truly authentic then I feel pleased to be tasting a part of history. I also feel that this is a necessary brew for the public to be a part of so that more is learned in the history of beer."
"D= I am having a sampler-glass of this and doubt I would want any more."
"D - Another unique beer from Sam. This one was enjoyable but I am starting to learn I am not a big fan of muscat grapes."
"Pours a hazy golden, huge and thick white head forms, lacing everywhere, nice retention, looks great. Smell is sweet, grapes, musty, honey, spices, some yeast, pretty unique. Taste is sweet, quite malty, honey and grapes, yeasty, bit of spice in the finish, once again pretty unique. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation. Really neat beer, works well."
"Hazy gold/caramel colour with a thin, white head off the pour. Good retention with a bit of lacing. Mild aroma, fruity, with green grapes, honey, and some spice. Pleasant flavour with low bitterness and plenty of fruit character, mostly fresh grapes which lingered in the finish. It also had a light acidity that brought the fruit forward. A little bready with some peppery spice in the finish and some earthiness. Moderate carbonation with a medium body - soft mouthfeel overall. This was a super easy drinking beer, very tasty and refreshing."
"Drinkability- Surprisingly drinkable, but a bit odd... and at $14 for this bottle, I'll sip and enjoy slowly. A unique brew that is definitely worth seeking out and trying with a friend."
"Lightly carbonated. Served cool side of room temp to maximize flavor...surprisingly refreshing and drinkable, with a nice balance of acidity and sweetness. Soft fruity aromas and flavors, peachy, floral, honey, not cloying, a really pleasant sipper before dinner. The history is fascinating so definitely an interesting brew to try...I would even buy this again, despite the fairly steep price, a well made beer/mead that was remarkably enjoyable!"
"A super interesting beer that tastes unlike anything I've had. Quite drinkable at a surprising 8.0% ABV. This one may be of interest to white wine drinkers."
"Poured a murky golden yellow color with a half inch head that faded only slightly. Aroma was very similar to a macro at first: very strong aromas of rice wafting from the glass but later on I could pick up on some malt, honey, rose petals and grape. Taste had a definite sour/winey characteristic along with flavors of honey, almond and the previously mentioned rice. Mouthfeel was light to medium. Drinkability was average. This beer reminds me of a cross between a sake, mead, wine and your typical macro. It was worth a try I guess, if only to sample an ancient recipe, but it's unlikely I would go out of my way to purchase this again."
"I am not enamoured of this beer, but presumably it is a one-off from DFH, and another example of considerable research and creativity in their beer mix."
"drinkability is great. a balanced and very tasty beer. good stuff!"
"Eric"
"Pours a fizzy cloudy peachy-orange color. Slight fizzy head at first, bt settles to no cap almost immediately. Aroma is orange, pineapple, fresh grapes, flowery, some honey sweetness. Flavor is like bitting in a fresh orange that has white grape juice inside the pulp. A little citrus bitterness in the background to round out the honey sweetness. However, is not overly sweet, and finishes dry. Very prickly carbonation that tingles the senses. Medium-light body, medium-prickly carbonation, and warming alcohol."
"This offering from DFH pours a cloudy dirty blonde that leaves a thin lacing that disappears leaving a spotchy thin head on top. The aroma is sour grapes, lemon, herbs that are hard to define in this nose. The taste starts very sweet, almost fruit juice quality grapes, lemon, herbal bitterness that finishes tart like a ""sweet tart"" almost. The feel on the palate is syrupy sweet refreshing with a slight carbonation that helps balance the overall beer as not to make it overly sweet, but it is still dominatly sweet. Overall great job DFH, if this is what they drank in ancient time then pour me another!"
"As it warms, I am starting to pick up much more of a sake taste, and that is what this beer finishes with. All and all, an interesting drink. I actually prefer this to Midas Touch. I would drink this again - I'll have to, as I have another bottle - but would prefer to share with a couple of people. One glass is really more than enough. Would make an interesting before or after dinner drink."
"Poured out a super light golden honey color with a bubbly bone white head that eventually fizzed to nothing. The nose had copious amounts of honey in it, as well as fresh green apple and flowery notes. The taste was again led by honey, followed by some near sickeningly sweet floral flavors. Overall, this was an interesting history lesson, but not, for me, an enjoyable beer, if it relly qualifies as a beer. Not bad, but not entirely enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel- A touch dry and tart. But mellow with some hints of an odd alcoholiv elemnet that I believe is brought about by the sake. I like sake, but I love beer. What an interesting combination."
"Thank you to Finepaws who let me try a sample of this from the bottle she won. This one definitely was a draw at the Carolina Bewmasters post meeting. Reminds so much of Midas Touch, but without the saffron (according to someone who knows their stuff). Hazy orange color with little carbonation. Lots of different fruits and spices, but not as enjoyable as its counterpart. Enjoy the story just as much as the beer. Definitely worth trying . . . and sharing with friends."
"EDIT: In retrospect, the most impressive thing about this beer is how it completely masks its respectable 8% ABV without the help of any obvious, in-your-face flavors."
" Wavz"
"Overall: This is an odd duck. Its worth a try, is a great conversation-starter, and it sure has a pretty bottle, but know that its definitely a niche beer."
"Nicely balanced with a thick chewy mouthfeel probably from the honey and addition of muscat grapes. The foundation of the muscat really shines through with hints of peach, honey suckle, apricot, and on the finish an almost pineapple flavor. Very ripe and sweet which does hurt drinkability but what I would consider more of an after dinner ""drink""."
"well, this thing is just too sweet. thats it. honey and fruit sweets are the definitive tastes here, all the way. nice carbonation, good little head, cloudy like a belgian wheat. the flavor is soooo sweet tho, that you cant drink even this whole pint+9oz bottle. no way. i corked it and ill leave the rest for my roommate. share this beer. i mean, its NOT bad at all, just so damn sweet..."
"The brew has a creamy texture with a nice amount of carbonation but given the sweet, rich nature of the beer I couldn't have but one of the 1 pint 9.6 oz."
"Well I won't exactly be bringing this to ANY office party except maybe archaeologists. It is quite interesting to try but I wouldn't call it drinkable. Hard for my mouth to choose wine or beer here, in the end it is a science experiment."
"What a great beer. I enjoyed this with some work folks the day before Thanksgiving after finding it at New Beer Distributors in Manhattan. Served in a wine glass, the half cloudy bright yellow mixtured produced only a smidgen of head that did not last for much longer than it took to pour. Very fresh, effervescent aroma with some unsweetened fruit scents. Upon the first sip I got a big mouthful of bready, biscuity yeast flavors. Very delicious. As it warmed up I started to get more of the wine/sake grape flavors. Very refreshing and tastey as well. I had two small glasses of this and it left me wanting more. Another great brew from DFH."
"Pours a hazy bright golden/peach color with a big white fizzy head that winds down to some fine bubbled swirls. The nose is alcoholic with big fruity floral esters, yeasty, and some grapefruit notes. The first sip is like carbonated white wine. Yeast's, sour fruit, orange rind, and floral characters follow. As it warms the alcohol intensity gives way to a defined honey sweetness, very much like a mead now. Developing later is something like pine and unripe bananas as well as some sweeter burnt sugar and malt characters lying underneath. I didnt know what to expect from this concoction but was pleasantly surprised."
"My girlfriend got a case of the 750 ml bottles for me. Go figure this was a just because gift. All I know now is that it's going to end up being pretty expensive for me. Either way, I poured it into a large pint glass and it seemed very carbonated. There was a fair amount of head, that had a quickish retention rate that left the glass clean. It has a very strong aroma that was kind of fruity and sweet like a honey smell (duh it was brewed with honey and various fruit). The color I thought was rather orange. Not like the color, but like the fruit (lighted than the color). The taste was extremely complex with so many flavors to many to mention, but really good. The mouthfeel was a bit rigid at first, but very smooth down the throat. Great beer. Don't drink and review."
"Found this at Sam's poured into a tulip glass despite the suggestion of a tumbler. This pours an extremely hazy white, orange, yellow, amber. Its almost a peach color. The head dissipated very fast and only lingers around the very edges of the beer, however this might not be the beers fault. Both the smell and color are unlike any other beer I've had this far. It smells of white grapes, pears, grass, it really does smell like a pino gris or a sauvignon blanc. The taste is similar to wine so different, yet very pleasing, part of me just wants to say its an extremely a-typical beer. And at the same time I feel like I can trace the roots of it back to certain varietals, one things for sure it is a very special beer. The flavor is sweet and slightly tart with lots of light fruit and a sort of crisp buttery flavor. The mouthful is nice and the strength is just right. Its not a beer I'd get all the time, but it's totally worth a try and for novelty sake, show a friend the recipe is 9000 years old."
"Pours a hazy yellow, almost golden. About 1/4 inch head. It first smelled like a sauvignon blanc with lots of citrus notes on the nose, although you could tell it was going to be a bit rich. As soon as hit the palate, I was amazed at how much flavor this beer had. There was notes of honey, peach, banana, and a bit of white grapes. The finish is amazing. I felt as if the taste lasted for up to a minute. The dominant flavor was obviously honey. This was a bit rich in my mouth which i think helped in the lasting flavor. I really enjoyed this very suprising beer."
"Definitely an interesting brew. Tasty at room temperature and deserves to be sipped."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a thin layer of white lace. Aroma is sweet and fruity with a little honey, spices and alcohol presence. Taste is sweet and tart with some fruit flavors and a lot of honey. Overall, this is a pretty interesting brew mostly because of it's story. The beer itself is just slightly above average and not something I will likely go back to especially considering it's high price tag."
"Single bottle for $7.99 at Tully's. It was a hazy yellow color with a medium head. It had a sweet aroma, with a noticeable alcohol presence. The taste was pretty much all honey. I thought this beer was a little too sweet. Plus, it needs to be drunk cold; it loses flavor when it warms."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink if its cool, not so much past about 50 degrees. Enjoy as a light brew while looking at the really cool label. Hawt asians on the bottle are always a plus! :-)"
"Not as good as DFH's previous foray into historical beer (Midas Touch), but still worth a shot."
"Murky yellow/light orange body with a quarter inch of offwhite head. Smells sweet, citrusy, grapey and floral. Tastes fruity, floral, honey-ish, ricey... Medium bodied. Very complex. Actually rather pleasant and drinkable. The flavor gets extra points for being complex and unique, as well as rather enjoyable. I may very well get this one again. Kudos once again, DFH!"
"For $15, this one isnt a really good bet. Its novel to try new stuff from DFH and especially novel to consume a 9000 year old yeast strain, but this one stops at the novelty. Dont feel bad if you dont get around to this one."
"D- a bit too sweet for having more than one of these in a night, another winner from dogfish head, a totally intersting concept for a beer, would definitely drink/ recomend anytime"
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" white head over the murky tarnished golden brew. Head is down to bubbly swirls pretty quick, no lacing. Aroma is sweet and effervescent, lightly fruity. Taste is sweet upfront, subtle grape and other fruit in the middle, and honey takes back over for the close. Mouthfeel is okay, but limited by syrupiness, and drinkability is quashed even more by same. Another one of the historic brews that I have to appreciate their perserverance to create, but it's just not something I'd revisit."
"D- The smooth and tangy flavor is not really a triple and not really a fruit wine but has a nice flavor that is pretty interesting. Maybe life 9,000 years ago wasn't so bad?"
"Cool label. Pours a powdery, hazy pale orange (wit-like in appearance) topped by a rocky, off-white head. Large at first, settling into a sturdy ring. Candy sugar malt aroma with banana and tropical fruit opposed by a tart, acidic grape/cherry edge. Powdered sugar sweetness and banana-rum-fruit-cocktail meet tangy, moderately tart citrus and grape juice. Juice bitterness in an otherwise sweet finish. Interesting and warming. Very fruity and sweet overall. Big bodied, with a syrupy feel."
"I'm glad that I got to try this. It is an interesting beer, and very different from anything else out there, with one exception.... Midas Touch. I find quite a few similarities between the two. Good beer, that I would recommend trying, but personally, at $13 a bottle, I don't think I'll be buying another. Although I would be curious to see how this ages when the alcohol begins to fall out."
"seems to fall towards the belgian end of things, but it sufficiently unique to bring something new to the table. a nicely drinkable beer that i would like to grab again to see how it does with a little bit of age on it."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"A very flavorful and unique beer, I'd highly reccomend trying it. I think a full 750 might be a bit much to knock down in one sitting, but is perfect with a friend, or recapped and saved for day 2. This would be an awesome dinner pairing, or perfect to introduce a wine-geek friend to the world of craft beer."
"I find the carbonation a little too intense for my taste, but it would not prove a deterent to drinking this again. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy, but doesn't really amount to heavy cloying. Overall, it's a nice balance of flavors and texture. Highly recommended!"
"Interesting beer. It's a hazy gold/copper with some chunks as you near the bottom of the bottle. Lacing is ok. The smell is sweet grape wine... maybe not the most beer-like, but pleasing none the less. Taste is somewhere between a mild barleywine and a fruit melomel. It's a sweet grapey flavor with lingering alcohol, and a hint of graininess. Leaves something to be desired. Mouthfeel is average, drinkability would be fine but is hampered slightly by the high ABV. Overall, a unique beer, definitely worth a try."
"glad i found this bottle at City Wide this week. First of all, its a D.H. i haven't seen before but more importantly its a beer brewed with hawthorns, which is a host to the particular fly that i'm studying for my PhD work. I've had various food items made with hawthorns before, but this is my first beer. very exciting. So it pours out looking like carbonated grapefruit juice and has a little tiny head that fails even to cover the entire top. really looks like a mead or melomel or something, which is essentially what i plan to think of it as (more or less) considering its origins. Smells like a cyser i drank at the Bells brewpub...hints of white wine, flowers, and, of course, hawthorns (which i can clearly pick out after working with them for so long). Taste is delicate and thin...squeezed, watered down haw juice, oranges, some alcohol noticeable. really just very delicate and wine line and not at all overbearing. if they were really drinking this back way back in the day then they were probably doing pretty well for themselves. Very nice and a pleasure to drink."
"Got to give to Dogfish Head for taking a risk in creating some interesting and wonderful brews. While in Columbus with my wife, I stop at Grape of Mirth and found a bottle of Chateau Jiahu. Poured a thick cloudy golden yellow with a 1 inch rocky white head. Once poured a wonderful scent of pear, honey and bread rush into my nose. My wife got a good whiff of grapes, banana and musty grass. Both agreed on the taste and mouthfeel. Full body, necture thick and softly carbonated this brew starts sweet honey, fruity and malty bread and ended sweet, spicy and peppery. At 9.5% ABV the alcohol is present but well hidden, a warm feeling going down reminds you it's there. Unlike my wife who loves drinking spiced/ herbed beers, I found it hard to drink much of it. I'll stick to my DIPA, IPA and stouts. In all this brew rocks. The complex flavors, aromas and a full body makes it a well balanced and tasty brew. Got to love DFH."
"9.5% is a bit much for a session beer but this is one of the most easy drinking beers out there."
"750 ml bottle. The label says 8.2% ABV."
"M&D - smooth up front with a dry finish, decent mouthfeel, maybe a little too sweet, nice honey/herb balance, a decent beer, if it were cheaper id buy it more often"
"Overall: An interesting beer. It's pretty good, and reminds me a little of a dessert wine."
"Pours a hazy golden color, rather honeylike, with a delicate off-white head. Aromas of honey and flowers. There's a bit of a sake-ish sour tinge to the aroma, and you can certainly smell the minerality and fruit of the muscat grapes used to make this. On the palate, very sweet initially, with the honey coming out, along with a cloying sweetness that seems to pop up in beers made with grapes. Very coating mouthfeel, heavy, with lots of sharp carbonation. This is an interesting beer, very cool to try, but I don't find it to be particularly tasty. The historical novelty is worth the price of admission, though."
"WAY TO GO DOGFISH!"
"Definitely a winner, but somewhat of an enigma. This reminds me of the excellent Baladin Nora in its unique floral and spice profile. Very complex and a pleasant challenge to identify what's in the recipe. I look forward to my next adventure with this excellent replication of a 9,000 year old Chinese recipe."
"Medium bodied very fruit and drinkable, definitely a unique brew."
"I hope they keep on making this."
"D: Not quite sure what to think of this. Definitely not outstanding (at least when compared to my favorite beers) but definitely drinkable, although not in large quantities - share the bottle with a friend. I'm not sure if I'll buy this again, but props to DFH for thinking outside the box on this one."
"Newly distributed to Central Kentucky, this is a warm welcome. The orange / straw, murky look promises honey sweetness, fruity flavors and a firm body. The beer doesn't disapoint. Tremendous honey sweetnees without cloying. Very fruity with pears, peaches, and ripe apples. Very wine-like with a satisfying malt base. Spices of giner, clove, nutmeg and corriander give the beer an added complexity and compliment the beer well. An earthy, herbal quality persists. The beer, though viscous in the start, finishes with a drinkable tartness and dryness. Quite clean for such a sweet and varying beer; sorta Midas Touch-like, just better. Dogfish just won me over again."
"I've been waiting a long time to try this one. Very nice bottle. It pours a cloudy light orange color with a small head that fades quickly and doesn't leave a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma reminds me mostly of grapes and some honey sweetness along with a touch of spices that I can't put my finger on. Wow, the flavor is strange. Lots of honey character along with some spices, but only a very slight pepper-type spice. Some grape flavor along with a lot of other stuff that I can't put my finger on. Makes for an extremely complex flavor that isn't over the top ... just strange. It's much better and extremely more drinkable and smooth than I expected. The alcohol is only barely apparent. The body is on the heavy end of moderate and the drinkability is very good. Wonderful strange beer."
"Hazy honey glazed amber with sunlight highlights at the margins. Short collar of fine, bright white bubbles and no visible carbonation streams. Sweet, lightly spiced aromas, punctuated with hints of white wine. Initially sweet and sticky tastes, like a sweet white wine, fill the mouth. There is a good handful of spice through the middle that almost gets out of hand and carry long into the finish as does a bit of alcohol warmth. Medium-full body that is heavy and a bit thick and sticky, with a low level of fine, fuzzy carbonation. Chateau Jiahu reminded me quite a bit of Midas Touch, however it was heavier and thicker and the spices were bit more in the forefront. Interesting, but I wont be revisiting it in the future. Ill probably break out the bottle I have at Thanksgiving."
"The beer poured a somewhat golden color with a slight white head into a chalice. The aroma of the beer was a pleasant nose of honey and grapes, floral. Similar to what I remember of the Midas Touch but not exactly the same. The taste was a pleasing mix of grapes and honey and more floral notes from the aroma. As others have mentioned, very similar characterstics to a sharp white wine. This is a very interesting beer but seems to be more than just a beer. Gives a dry finish and with a somewhat light body I find it pretty darn drinkable, even for a 9,000 year old recipe. Great job Sam and Mike. I will have to give this one a try in bottle as well."
"There isn't really a whole lot to compare it to so if you don't mind tart beer give it a go just to say you have because it really isn't too bad. Not my cup of tea but i'm glad i've tried it."
"D: Drinks well, like a decent wine. Seems unfair to compare it to beer of any type when it seems much more similar to a German white. That being said, it's smooth, and I'll be getting more."
"The drinkability is high, very nice indeed. Prosit MK"
"2nd review following having it on tap at the brewpub when it first came out. Hazy, whitish yellow sort of color. Pleasant odor of fruit and spices with a lemon tinge to it. Sweet, lemon and grass like flavors. Slight tartness to it. Thin mouthfeel-though it doesnt detract from the beer overall. I think I was expecting more bodywise. Overall an enjoyable beer. Seems a summery sort of thing. Better then my last encounter for sure. While I wouldnt go out of my way to have it again since its not really my scene it is good and worth a try."
"I found this interesting beer to be quite drinkable. It had a very complex yet pleasant taste. A lot of layered fruits. Surprisingly Viognier like. I'm curious as to what grapes were actually used in this. I would certainly recommend this, however don't expect a typical herb/spiced beer. This is a pretty unique creation."
"M - It is like a mix between champagne and a thick hefeweisen, medium with lots of carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is sweet, fruity, foreign, and different with a starchiness that makes you ponder it upon it's sweetly semi-dry finish."
"Very drinkable beer, and a very special treat."
"Overall- A happy surprise. I was not holding out too much hope for this experiment, but I do like an adventure. It is less exotic than I thought it was going to be, but very pleasing nonetheless. I think Midas Touch has the upper hand over the Chateau Jiahu just in level of complexity, but overall they are both fun and drinkable brews."
"Drinkability: Drank mine with some yellow-fin tuna that I had caught just days prior to this review. This would go well with any kind of fish or a sushi meal."
"Overall, a nice sweetness balanced with the tart bite and earthiness throughout. It went very well with my dinner of balsamic vinegar peach pork chops. A fine experiment that I hope they keep brewing. The bottle is a bit much for one person though, so I recommend sharing."
"Drinkability: definitely interesting to try these ancient beer recreations, but not a beer I would buy a bunch of. One is enough to try, and finishing the bottle in one sitting was a slow process."
"This is a very enjoyable brew that captures the imagination and shatters the boundaries of time. The poignant, sensory experience evoked by this libation transcends the effects of great historical texts. I liken this profound discovery to procuring an obscure, long, lost scroll from the very ashes of Alexandria."
"Currently on tap at the Dogfish Head alehouse in Gaithersburg, Maryland. $9 per snifter. The best way I could describe this is a cross between a whitbier and Dogfish Head's own Midas Touch ale. It's a shade lighter than Midas, but it has head (unlike Midas). The spices and slight fruitiness remind me of a whit, but the flavor and feel of the beer is complex and hard to describe, much like Midas Touch. The waiter rattled off a long list of spices that are used in making the beer, none of which I remember. At the finish of the beer is a pleasant little kiss of hops. Very interesting and quite outstanding. Much more drinkable than the aforementioned DFH beer, and possibly the next-best-thing to DFH's red-and-white whitbier, which I never got to try."
"Drinkability... well, I have to give it a little off for that, since it is a bit strong and expensive. And it had a little more wine character than I would have liked. But it was interesting and worth the experience."
"I must say I was a bit skeptical with the first few tastes, but after about the third sip, I was sold. This pairs exceptionally well with their appetizer, ""The Dog Pile"". This is a beer I would serve with a nice goat cheese, fish, or an aperitif. Due to its dryness it's not something I could drink all night. A very interesting addition to Sam C's ever evolving beer portfolio. Definitely worth a sampling!!"
"Unique. I wasn't sure I was drinking a beer but a sake infused ale. Almost no head present but a nice pour. A nice smell but definitely overtones of rice? Based on a 5000 year old Chinese recipe the rice/sake taste is to be expected. The mouthfeel was good with flowery tones pervasive to the tongue. The drinkability was very nice. At almost 10% abv you wouldn't expect such drinkability as this but it went down very smootly (too smoothly). Overall, a very nice drink but I still feel that I was drinking a slightly carbonated herbed infused sake-beer. Good job DFH."
"Poured a hazy straw color. No head at all...maybe a bubble or two but that's it. Barely any smell at all. Slight sweet smell came through as it warmed some as it was served ice cold. The taste was more like a white wine than a beer. Sweet, tart, some grape and woody tones. No carbonation. Thin body with a slick, dry finish. I'm glad I got to try it, but I think I'll stick to ""beer"" next time I am there."
"Served in a 750ml bottle - crown cap - no label."
"What can you say? This is DFH at its finest. Say what you want about their IPAs, this brewery is built on experimentation -- one of the few that legitimately pushes the boundaries. I don't know if this is a great beer, but it's unique and interesting. That, at least, counts for something."
