3.92,18.1,4.25,4,3.75,4.5,3.75,"Pours with a small, white head. Has a reddish brown color. Has aromas of malts, gingerbread, and hops.  Initial taste is of gingerbread, hops, and malts. The combination of these flavors persists throughout the aftertaste. Not a very complex melody of flavors. The gingerbread flavor is somewhat weak compared to the hops and malts. Hops give the flavor and added sweetness on top of the gingerbread while the amber malts give it a crisp taste. Overall a good beer, but nothing too impressive.","Myotus","Mar 08, 2015"

Appearance- nice dark amber, two fingers of off white foam that quickly goes down to a thin layer. Smells like sweet gingerbread. Tastes like gingerbread, nutmeg, and hints of pumpkin spice. Finishes clean with a nice gingerbread aftertaste. Very light and smooth. Very easy to drink.","JD8908","Feb 13, 2015"

Aroma is of molasses and gingerbread cookies. Taste is similar with touches of molasses, cinnamon, nutmeg and sweet maltiness. Carbonation is just the right amount from keeping this beer from being flat. Nice balance, and I swear, this tastes just like gingerbread cookies. A little thick on the tongue, but overall, balances well and is enjoyable, especially around the holidays on a cold day !!","hophugger","Jan 06, 2015"
