3.9,8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"24.3 oz bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 3/2012. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of ginger root, caramel, pear, apple, citrus zest, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, toffee, herbal, floral, grass, light clove, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of ginger, malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, ginger, toast, brown sugar, pear, apple, light citrus zest, brown bread, toffee, herbal, floral, grass, light clove, and herbal/toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, ginger, toast, brown sugar, pear, apple, brown bread, toffee, herbal, floral, light clove, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, ginger, and moderate yeast fruitiness; with a good malt/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice spiced amber ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of malt, ginger, and moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 05, 2014"

4.45,23.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Poured a cloudy, fresh apple cider brown, with a one finger off-white head that receded to a nice ring of lacing. Very good looking. Scents of overripe fruit, earthy, musty and funky aromas, ginger, and some faint honey and malt sweetness. A very nice, earthy, fruity and sweet aroma with some unexpected funk. Far more complex than I was expecting, very nice. Flavor begins with sweet malt and caramel, moves into some white grape, raisin and dried fruit, apricot and apricot pit with some slight spiciness, some earthy and musty yeast flavors, coming out on the finish and aftertaste, slight sour funkiness and some slight hints of ginger in the background in the middle, finish and aftertaste. Very good, the ginger is not as big in the flavor as I expected, but it has a good, Belgian quality to the flavor, with some wild notes and the spiciness, malty sweetness, stone fruit and dried fruit flavors of tripels and quads. Quite unique and very good. The flavor hides the 8% ABV entirely. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with moderate carbonation that barely pricks the tongue, yet enough to give the beer a sipping quality. There is also a slight creaminess in the feel. Very nice to drink and swish, excellently crafted. Overall this is an amazing beer. I went in expecting a ginger heavy gimmick, but got a good, Belgian-like beer with a surprising complexity in aroma and flavor, with just a bit of ginger. Its a well crafted beer, showing the brewer's care for the final product. Highly recommended.","Auraan","Nov 07, 2013"
4.08,13,3.5,4.25,4,4,4.25,"This beer has a huge head when first poured and lacing remains throughout. Nice reddish caramel color. There is some dark sediment that comes out at the end of the pour. You can really smell the ginger and taste it as well. Nice spicy finish from the ginger without being harsh due to the sweetness of the beer. If you like ginger, this is the beer for you. I was not expecting such a true rendition of the ginger flavor but this one hits it on the spot. This is what a true ginger beer should be. The ABV of 8% also gives you a nice double whammy when combined with the ginger :)","Richardbeerlover","Nov 07, 2013"

Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small particles of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, and ginger aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and subdued ginger flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but the ginger that is present in the aroma and flavor is fairly underwhelming in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 12, 2013"

Medium bodied, slightly chewy, lingering spicyness. I liked this, but 10oz should be enough.

I had a hard time picking out the individual flavors underneath the ginger, which kind of covered everything for me.

The ginger is tastes less intense than it smells, but manages to give the beer a mildly spicy flavour that is complemented by some sweet caramel and honey. Finishes with a very mild bitterness. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated; smooth but not heavy. As far as beer brewed with ginger goes, this isn't as complex as Albino Python from Schmaltz Brewing.

The body of the beer is a rusty orange color, and you can see big chunks of sediment resting on the bottom. The smell is unsurprisingly of ginger, with some citrusy notes that actually remind me of a weizen or Belgian blonde. The taste is where things really get interesting. The ginger is predominant, but acidic, sweet, fruity malts and hops follow after. Again, I'm amazed how much this tastes like other styles: lambics, bdsas, weizens, and wittes are all represented. The mouthfeel is smooth and effortless, which is good because there's a lot of flavor to process. If you had handed me a glass of this stuff without telling me where it came from, I would have immediately guessed that it was Belgian or a north-eastern American micro.

3.52,-2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Wow, they weren't lying about the ginger! This tastes almost more like ginger beer, than a beer brewed with ginger. Molasses/brown sugar flavors prevail throughout as well, though the ginger is in complete control of the palate.	This is not an everyday drinker here. It's fun to try once, but I won't be revisiting this ever again.","cbl2","Jul 27, 2007"

3.5,-3,3,3,3.5,4,4,"Picked up several Hitachino Nest beers on a recent trip to Nashville. Pours the color of a thick and dark honey. Some slight lacing, but an aggressive pour yields no head. Not picking up much in smell either, but this is definately malt over hops. The ginger seems to stand out in the taste more when this beer is on the cooler side. It lingers on the tongue and in the aftertaste, but there is no burn from the ginger. Quite mild. I enjoyed this less as the beer warmed. It just seemed to get maltier and maltier. Mouthfeel and drinkability are fine. Alcohol is well hidden. All in all, a nice beer, but I'd have prefered a more dominant ginger presence.","Onibubba","Jun 18, 2007"
4.14,14.7,4,5,4,3,4,"This beer pours a pretty brown color that almost turns to amber when held up in the light. There is virtually no head when poured. The smell is mostly malty, but there is a special addition of ginger that forces its way through and is very inviting. The taste is great. It tastes a lot like normal Ginger Beers on the market (Reed's is the most popular), but the slight addition of malt tones down the ginger and couples to form a really interesting mixture. There is very little carbonation, so the mouthfeel reminds me of a generic malt beverage. The lingering taste is thick, and sits on the back of the tongue with a pungent ginger kick that begs for anther sip. A very special beer.","Toddv29424","Jun 09, 2007"
3.65,1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured into a standard pint glass a dull rust color with a thinner white head,the ginger is light in the nose intermingling with some floral hop and toasted grain.Same as the aromas really on the palate the ginger comes thru late and gives a little edge at about mid swallow up front is a mix of floral citric hop and toasty lightly sweet malt.Hmm not half bad but the ginger could be a bit more pronounced before the lingering finish,glad I tried but not sure I would go back.","oberon","Beers"

The ginger is not overdone, (what a pleasant surprise), it just lingers throughout while still allowing for wonderful fruit notes, mainly strawberries, to shine.

3.72,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3,"It's an interesting, unique brew. Ginger dominates, but does not overpower other flavors. As tasty as it is, one is enough. As the drink progresses, more alcoholic sharpness becomes noticeable. A good one to try because it's something different, but not anything to have with any regularity. It has a rawness about it. Might be good to have with a spicy Asian cuisine that has ginger as a main ingredient. On its own - a bit much.","jwc215","Oct 06, 2006"
3.95,9.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Probably won't appeal too much to ginger freaks but I find this to be a very good application of ginger in a beer. Japan stand up and be proud. Kono biru wa totemo sugoi desu!","Grundle20","Sep 16, 2006"

3.9,8,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours coppery orange with a fat offwhite head that faded very fast. The has lots of ginger, some sweet malts, and a very tiny bit of hops. The taste has some nice citrusy ginger (almost like orange peel), some malt and ale yeast flavors, and a tiny twang of hops. The mouthfeel is slightly rich, but the carbonation and ginger flavors make me perceive it as lighter and more refreshing. Actually, I like this beer a whole lot. This is probably my favorite Japanese beer and my favorite herbal brew as well.","zjungleist","Jul 16, 2006"
3.52,-2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"The tan head on the copper colored beer fell quickly, but a citrusy nose with a lot of spice promised a lot. And, a lot is what it is. First, a lot of ginger, with an overwhelming initial taste followed by a bitter, bitter finish. It improves after a few sips, and the taste buds acclimate (surrender???) to the ginger. Also, a lot of alcohol (7%) taste comes through as well, blended with a soda like high carbonation bite as well. It did clear my sinuses for a bit. With that said, it has some balance and if you like ginger (which I suspect is my main problem with this beer), I can see where there are some really ravenous ginger fans who are terribly loyal to this brew from Japan. Enjoy with caution.","FightingEntropy","Jun 17, 2006"
3.62,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,3,"Drinkability: Certainly not Kiuchi's finest effort, but worth a try nonetheless. I want the ginger flavor to be kicked up a little more, because as it is this is just kind of a blasé pale ale.","soulgrowl","Jun 14, 2006"

3.93,8.9,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy, bright bronze in color, with a dense tan head of moderate duration and enough lace to pique my interest  this looks sturdy! Nose offers a hint of pineapple and spice, with the ginger being surprisingly subtle (think of liquid Pineapple Upside-down Cake without the cherries!) Im also catching a bready, ale-yeast component (strong/old ale), ginger snaps, and just a touch of bittering hops. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, the ginger and firm alcohol work in a point-counterpoint manner, delivering a spicy kick within a medium-full bodied strong ale. Hop bitterness is present but more as a compliment to the sharp, tangy ginger, and there is a touch of resin-y pine in the aromatics. The malt profile is obscured by the spice and warming alcohol, but adds just enough sweetness to this dry, spicy, strong-yet-very drinkable brew. A very good tipple!","Chaz","Mar 27, 2006"
4.14,14.7,3,4,4.5,4,4,"A slightly cloudy dark amber beer. Has a small fizzy head that evaporates quickly. There is a definte belgian like floral and herbal character to the aroma ( similar to beers that I have had from Offshore Ales and The Tap when Mr Paquette was there.) That whole floral and herbal texture carrys over into the taste. With hints of malty sweetness in the middle and a dry floral hop finish Quite a suprising brew.","ybnorml","Feb 28, 2006"
4.04,11.9,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Quite plesant in its herbal, spicy, and intriguing character. Expeimental brews rarely contain the finess and roundness as this one. Aromas are floral and flowery with ginger, honey, suckle, and flowers. Basically a potpouri to the nose. Tastes less bitter and bite-ey than expected. Starts with, what would be, a fine pale ale. Throw in a ton of ginger, but without the heartburn qualities that are associated with bold spices. Melded to the tone that is expected from corriander. Lightly peppery and lemony to top it off. Finishes with a prickly and numbing carbonation and a dry powdery texture. Leaves a light ginger, alcohol, and honey flavor to reflect upon.","BEERchitect","Beers"

4.32,19.7,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a murky copper with a few fine trails of carbonation rising through the middle. A small oatmeal colored head forms, but doesn't hold out very long. Smells like a malty pale ale, but with a dash of ginger. Actually it reminds me of spiced pumpkin smell for some reason. Solid, caramel maltyness holds up against the modest ginger. The finish is only slightly bitter, and there's a mild bite to the ginger. The hops are hard to pick out, but I think there's some piney hops in the mix. Almost chewy body does well to carry the sweet flavors and keep the ginger in check. Wow, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm impressed. Not as hot as I thought it would be, but that is good. Well balanced, flavorful, and I'm a ginger fan so I could drink a few of these.","HappyHourHero","Jan 02, 2006"
