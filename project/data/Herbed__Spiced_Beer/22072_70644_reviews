"This one pours orangish red with an off white head that fades fast. The smell is faint, some sweet notes and malty goodness. The taste is interesting, it starts with an almost wine like flavor, then has some spice notes, followed with subtle fruit. This one is a bit harsh on the palette, a decent medium mouthfeel. Overall I thought this was a very interesting beer, decent session beer if you can enjoy it, I think it is worth a try."

"The good: Revolution nailed it with this one. The bad: Just not my cup of beer. Not bad . . . worth a try for sure. Not digging the hibiscus."

"12 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 4/30/2014. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of berries, pear, apple, white grape, orange peel, flowers, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and herbal/floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale/bready malt and hibiscus/orange peel spice notes; with decent strength. Taste of berries, pear, apple, white grape, orange peel, flowers, honey, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and herbal/floral earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness/tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of berries, pear, apple, white grape, orange peel, flowers, honey, bread, and herbal/floral earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and robustness of pale/bready malts and hibiscus/orange peel spice flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a pretty good hibiscus spiced beer. Good balance and robustness of pale/bready malt and hibiscus/orange peel spice flavors; and very smooth and fairly crisp to drink. A pleasant and enjoyable offering."

"Pour is deep orangish amber with a yellowish white head.  Nose is heavily caramel malt with a faint touch of adjunct grain and a little orange citrus.  Taste follows pretty close, a bit more citrus, adjunct grains, overly sweet malt.  Medium body, moderate carb, clean finish."

"I've had a couple hibiscus beers before and thought I would like this one. I thought incorrectly. It's ok, but I wouldn't buy a six pack."

"Verdict: A very interesting beer from Revolution, a very nice presentation of hibiscus, but there is little else in terms of complexity or interest. That being said, this beer is very refreshing and quite the thirst quencher, a crushable summer beer that breaks for the norm of lighter pale ales, session ales and lagers. I often find myself wondering why I don't pick this up more often in the summer months, a very worth while brew."

"One of the first beers brewed outside of Belgium that pour a magenta hue with a pink tinged head, these Rosa Hibiscus beers don't pull any punches. Fine speckled lacing left intricately adds to the beauty of the beer. Aroma has notes of a citrus based wheat with floral notes galore, so flowery in the aromatics that it really rises up to the Rosa namesake. A nice base beer maybe some wheat in the malt bill, slightly citric tartness, bitterness derived from the hibiscus hops added color seems natural not dyed like most unique colored beers out there. This proves that Revolution doesn't really make any bad beer, it's that good. Other than the hibiscus I'm guessing there's some citrus peel and dried spices added to the mix but I can't really pick them out amongst the heavier floral forward notes. Mouthfeel has a nice dryness not overtly sweet, earthy, floral notes galore with even carbonation for the style a bit dead on and not aggressive in anyway...I'd call it lighter bodied. Overall impressive canned offering from an innovative brewer, I bet they sell a ton of this...even if it's not the most unique beer I've ever tasted out of these floral aka rose hips infused beer this is a solid drinkable version of a difficult style to make balanced."

"O: A very nice and interesting herb/spiced beer which is very well executed - I enjoy both rose and hibiscus so this one hits the mark for me. I would definitely get this one again but it is not a session beer as I felt content after one."

"Pours a hazy light red with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour with malt, grain, fruit, and hibiscus aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour grain and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of earth bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty, light, and refreshing."

"Its slightly acidic finish is welcome as any hop contributions are scant- careful not to oppose the herb. Still, the balance trends thinly sweet, fruity, flowery and semi-dry. Resembling rose wine early and often, this tepidly headed ale may be an ideal cross-over beer for fans of zinfindale."

"Overall: A very enjoyable unique offering from Revolution. The spiced tones are subtle and merely an accessory so don't let that scare you off. Creamy and sugary flavors are well received. This is a winner."

"The hibiscus adds a gorgeous ruby hue that imparts a pinkish head, which is quite fluffy with great retention. Extreme floral notes trick your nose into believing itâ€™s in a flower shop. The hibiscus is very prominent, but lets subtle notes of white peppercorn, honeydew, biscuit, and honeyed malt show their presence. A honey-like sweetness makes up the backbone on the palate. Delicate floral notes of rose petal and, of course, hibiscus pleasantly grace and compliment the honey sweetness. Despite the fragileness of the floral notes, the body is quite strong, yet super drinkable and refreshing. If there were ever a perfect lawnmower beer, this would be it."

"Some people may find Rosa too sweet, but I like her how she is. The malt bill is what really throws this beer off. Nothing off the top of my head comes to mind as a good sub for it, but the complexity and excellent blend of spiced flavors helps make up for it."

"The Rosa Hibiscus Ale from Revolution is ok. The beer poured a amber with purple tinge. There was little head and no lacing. The scent had a spice to it that reminded me of raisons....maybe. The taste was slightly dry with mild spice to it and had a slight citrus to it. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall, the beer was good....but not one that I would consider a go to."

"O - I enjoyed this more than some other reviewers. Perhaps it's because it is the first beer after 15 miles of hiking on a sunny summer day; but I enjoyed this brew. Not remarkable but today, it hit the spot."

"O - Wasn't crazy over this one. It was fairly refreshing, but I couldn't have more than one of these at a time."

"Overall, this is a refreshing tea like beer, but unless you like tea you probably won't like this."

"Overall- Not a bad drink, fairly refreshing if not just a little odd. I could see this pairing well with some pork with some fruit chutney. Don't know that I'd necessarily drink it myself again but could be a nice summer offering for those not fond of hops or those with a predilection towards fruitier alcoholic drinks."

"uh oh, a unnatural looking pink brew, red flags up on appearance for me. served in a funny jointed pint glass at the brewery, with a very small off white head of thin bubbles. it smells tart, fruity tart, not yeasty tart, and absolutely floral, perhaps one step below perfume type. it smells fresh and interesting, but I cant pick out much grain, yeast, or hops, which always makes me suspect of a brew. the first sip is very different, quite acidic, thin, front of tongue zesty, and just loaded to the gills with the hibiscus flower essence, which if I was unfamiliar with before, I sure am not anymore. the finish is quick and dry, without much sweetness, but again, very little yeast, grains, or hops, somewhat more like a fruit drink. I give points here for creativity, and for innovation, but this isn't a beer that's anywhere near my wheelhouse. the flowers were too dominant for me, this could use some refining."

"O: there really isn't much going on with brew, but it does drink exceptionally well to be honest. very refreshing for these dog days of summer."

"An interesting experiment, but never need to drink it again."
""
""
"O: Nice flowery flavors that's easily drinkable. Wouldn't be my go to choice on a hot summer's day, but it's a nice option if nothing else is around."
"Overall: surprisingly enjoyable. Fruity notes were nice, and its refreshing."

"O: A nice summer beer, somewhat akin to a berliner weisse. A sour mash/lactic fermentation would really push this into awesomeness."
""

"Overall: Very disappointing, especially for Revolution."
""
""
""

"I would happily buy this again. I think it would be very refreshing on a hot day by the pool (instead of a rainy night inside)."

"Really interesting overall. Taste was pretty good and light in comparison to the smell. Defiantly one of the more unique beers I've had recently."

"O: This beer looks, smells and feels like a great fruit beer, but the lack of overall flavor in the taste of the beer, as well as the lack of actual hibiscus flavor or aroma leaves me wishing for something more. It is a beer with great potential that has yet to be reached."
""
"Weird beer. Very bland. To me, it's nothing more than something to keep you refreshed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is as light as I'd expect but gives some depth. The body actually leans toward medium, though it still rests in light-bodied territory. Crispness doesn't disappoint on either the light or heavy end, pretty effervescent but not overly so, and it's pretty smooth as well."

"I was excited over tasting a new beer steeped with habiscus and very dissappointed in the actual beer itself. I will not buy again. Sorry. I was expecting a stronger habiscus influence that was not present in this beer. I truly believe that a habiscus steeped beer can be made a bit better with a greater proportion of habiscus ratio in order to be a great summer beer when you are mowing the lawn or doing some grilling."
"O - a light summer beer with a semi-rare ingredient that doesn't do much for me."

"A good beer. Nothing remarkable or memorable, but a good beer."
"Pink peer is certainly interesting. Beer was just okay. Lacked much flavor at all, and the only flavor it did have was all floral. No hops or anything else to remind you, ""Hey, this is beer!"" Another one of those beers that sounds good on paper and just doesn't work in practice. It wasn't horrible, at least it was drinkable, but I wouldn't order it again."

"O: Good all around beer and perfect for summer days/nights"

"O - A nice summer beer that's relatively easy to drink, but nothing to go crazy about. Something nice for a change-of-pace, but that's about it."
"A quaff-able beer. It's nice for a hot day, but outside of that I still find it uninteresting."
"D - It's a well-executed herb/spice beer, with the adjuncts integrating with instead of dominating the base beer. Is the base some sort of Altbier? Better than I was expecting, but not something I'd order often, as I'd have a hard time drinking a whole mug."

"The 2011 Bachelor Party Extravaganza moves south to Sheffield's. The inaugural brew pours a clear pink-ruby topped by a half-finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises hibiscus (I knew it was some sort of sweet-smelling flower, and finding out which one made my mind sleep slightly easier), sweet honey, light black cherry, light red grape, and a touch of caramel. The taste holds notes of honey-dipped red apple, dark cherry, and that same bit of caramel. The hibiscus comes back in near the finish, allowing for a sweet floral character to break through. Everything comes off as very sweet, but also kinda tart. It's a strange sensation on the tongue. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta syrupy feel. Overall, an interesting beer, to say the least; one I'm glad I got to try, but not one I plan to revisit any time soon."
"O- Not a bad summer beer and its light character helps out on a hot day. Lacks an overall polish (for lack of a better word) to bring all of the components together."
"O: this brew has refreshing qualities, but not really my favorite combo of flavors"
"The food was tastier than this beer, but at least they had Anti-Hero on cask, that is such a great beer."
"O - Not a bad beer, but the unique taste makes it hard to get tons down."
