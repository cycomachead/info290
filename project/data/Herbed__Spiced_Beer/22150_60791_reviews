"Fairly low spice tastes of cloves.  Not bad at all.  Nice thick mouthfeel for this low of alcohol beer."
"Overall: a good and quite interesting herbal spiced saison. Complex yet well balanced. I didn't love this but am happy to have had a bottle and can easily see some fans of farmhouse ales loving it."
""
"Overall: Its a solid beer not the best of the style but right down the middle."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Wow!  This is another great saison by Stillwater!  I’m really, really impressed with this brewer!"
""
"Very nice beer. Easy drinking and could easily drink enough to really get in trouble. We purchase at the wine source so drank in bottles. We gave an extra .5 pts in look for lovely artwork on packaging."
""
"Floral and soft herbs with fruit and honey. Very clean, very well done overall. Drinks wonderfully. The body and carbonation are a bit lacking, but this one is tough to set down. Very enjoyable."
""

"Some nice funk. A pear funk with some good carbonation. Different than any other Beerb I've had. Kudos"

"A decent saison, that I actually really liked on first sip. In breaking it down, I find myself talking myself out of liking it, but that's about the components vs. the whole. The flavors that are present are nice, though they're simple. Needs more complexity, or for those up-front characteristics to be better."

"Way too sweet for a saison in my opinion. Lots of interesting flavors, but a bit heavy on the spices."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/16/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a small dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, lavender, chamomile, clove, black pepper, herbal, straw, grass, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, herbal spices, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, lavender, chamomile, clove, black pepper, herbal, straw, grass, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, lavender, chamomile, clove, black pepper, herbal straw, grass, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, herbal spices, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly herbal/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good herbal spiced saison. All around well balanced and robust fruity/spicy yeast, herbal spices, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall (4/5): I think Stillwater's Of Love and Regret is a very interesting, tasty beer that–while it certainly has some flaws–was a pleasure to try. It gets the earthiness quotient right and successfully gets the flower/herbal flavors to works without being too sweet or perfumey. A successful go at an herbed/spiced saison."

"O: A very tasty Saison that is quite enjoyable, drinkable and refreshing."
""
"O: Interesting for sure and quite the flavorful saison."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Everything works in harmony for this beer with flavors, yeast, hops, the creaminess of the wheat malt. Its beautiful. The mouth feel was the disappointment for me. It just lacked that zesty pop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid Stillwater Saison feel with a heaping bunch of added floral notes. For me it all works out well together and the floral flavors compliment the spicy base yeast."

"This is a very mysterious beer. Smell and taste have similarities but are totally unique. In the nose this screams Belgian farmhouse with notes of Brett and plenty of wheat malts. But the flavor is very fruity with lots of counteracting spices. The wheat is almost non existent in the flavor with the Brett really melding with the fruit. A very interesting beer indeed."
""
""
"A good beer but would definitely limit to one or two because the flavor can become overpowering."
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty interesting beer that is usually not up my alley but htat I enjoyed a lot more than I thought after first whiff. Pricey but a good one try brew."
""
""
"Overall: A very interesting take on the style with a lot of complexity; this bottle has some age on it and I wonder what it would have been in its youth"
"I liked this one a lot. It's not a typical saison/farmhouse ale. The grassy hay flavors have been replaced by sweet fruity florals but the spring/summer attraction remains. A great beer to have on a sunny day."
""
""
"Utterly delicious!"
""
"O: This one doesn't blow me away, however it's an easily drinkable brew that's also mildly complex. I'd gladly drink this again."
""
""

""

"Appearance is golden brown to tan in color, with a thick light tan head and above average lacing. Smell is sweet, earthy, and yeasty. Taste is fantastic: herbaceous, woody, with a roasted barley up front; leathery and tangy sweet; all while a honey/brown sugar/banana sweetness shines through. It seems to be too sweet at times, but the sweetness yields to an earthy/yeasty spiciness."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very interesting take on a saison, and quite unique in general; the spice flavors make for an intriguing twist on a classic style."
""
""
""
"I could drink this everyday and be pretty damn happy! Another excellent farmhouse brew from Stillwater!"

"Flip top bottle pours a red garnet hue with slight hazing. Fluffy cream colored cap that settles to a tight finger of foam. On the nose fruity esters pop, spicy belgian yeast, cardamom, apple cider, clove and a little cinnamon with slight sour barnyard notes. The taste brings brings more of the nose but a bit muddled and thin, doesn't shine on the palate the way the nose brings complexity. I pick up a little numbing szchuan peppercorn as well - interesting. Very nice until you start to drink it, expecting great ended up being just good and not worth the price."
""
"O: A great beer to try if you like herbal teas /scented soaps/ want to step outside the <lager-ale> framework. Over the top in all the right ways."
"From the 750 ml swing top bought at Bine and Vine in San Diego for an extortionate $17.99. And then I read the fine print: ""Product of Belgium."""
""
"the beer pours a murky, dull brown with an off-white head that slightly laces. the nose presents big notes of bread and herbs reminiscent of lavender and white sage. the beer almost smells like a perfumed soap... using the aforementioned herbs for aromatics. the taste is just as potently herbal with a sweet, malty backbone pulling everything together. the mouthfeel is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. The initial sweetness of the beer fades and finishes slightly drier with residual herbs sitting on my palate, lingering in the aftertaste. this is a tasty beer, but I'm not running back to the store to grab another bottle. it's definitely not my favorite Stillwater."
""
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of candy ester with light soapy notes with light sweet notes. Taste is a pretty good mix between some soapy notes with good candy-like ester notes with light residual sugar and light dry malt aftertaste. Body is fuller then average with good carbonation. This particular bottle may be a bit tired but very nice nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Very enjoyable, easy drinker. Refreshing lemonade-like characteristics without being overly fruity, although there are definite fruit notes. Some flowery aroma and floral flavor, nice hops flavor almost IPA like. Maybe a little too carbonated, but would drink again. Deep bronze color on the pour, very bubbly white head, some nice lacing. Very much alive with the carbonation - not quite ""fizzy"" but close. Nice hit of acid on the back."
""
""
"O: Overall, spicy, herbal, and lightly candied sweet with a shadow of fruit. Tentatively recommended."
""
""
"Poured into Ommegang tulip with a very large head that develops to very nice lacing that lasts throughout. Smell is of fresh grass, very floral, earthy, some hop spiciness. Taste is very nice, a wonderful spring saison with the herbs well balanced. Great carbonation and mouthfeel hit the style quite well. Overall another delicious offering from Stillwater."
"O: A very interesting beer with a lot of flowery, herbal components that are well balanced. The brewer achieved the goal of a beer that captures the impression of spring. It's a bit sweet and a bit dark for a Saison, but as a specialty it works. I probably would have purchased this beer if I know what I was getting into with a beer brewed with heather, chamomile, lavender and dandelion. I really should brew up a beer with some heather in it one of these days."
""
""
"Mouth feel is medium carbonated. Didn't notice much alcohol. I don't know. This one is a little out there for me. Too minty. Actually, upset about this one. Paid $14 for a beer that really is not good."
""
"O: When I opened the bottle, it pretty much exploded, something I wasn't prepared for. It's definitely an interesting earthy-type beer, though as I continued drinking it, I liked it less and less. Perhaps I poured it a bit too vigorously and allowed too much of the sediment to get into my glass. Perhaps I picked up a bottle that had gone bad (I couldn't find a date on it). Perhaps my palate's not ready for this one. Anyway, I wasn't too fond of it, but I'd be willing to give it another go in the future."
""
""
"With nearly gruit-like spiciness, the beer takes a pine-heavy balance from nose to finish. The decoration of wild flowers, herbs, and spice informs the taste of pine in high form. I'm not sure if the beer represents Belgian spring, but I does take my imagination to botanical gardens in the U.S. deep south."
""
"O - A saison brewed on the floral end of the spectrum."
"Poured this into brew from Stillwater into a wine glass. The appearance is a hazy orange tone with a couple fingers of an off-white head. Looks quite nice, excited to try this. Of Love and Regret smells of ginger, lavender, yeast and some citrus. Sipping on this and I taste lemon, more yeast, spices such as that ginger. A very interesting taste, most certainly one that is spiced, and has other characteristics prevalent in quite a few Belgian style beers. Mouthfeel is medium, very crisp and sharp. Overall, a solid beer for sure. Kind of expensive, but worth checking out at least once IMO."
"Strange, strange beer. Not bad, just not something like I'd normally go for. There was an odd spiciness to it, and I finally figured out what it was towards the end: tamarind! This isn't something that I'd like in my beer (or my food, for that matter), and I found that it really distracted me from the beer."
""
"jd"
""
"For the second pour I allowed the yeast into the glass and found it had little impact on the aroma and, while adding some fruitiness, it generally muted the flavors. Of Love and Regret is better if the yeast is left in the bottle."
""
"Drinkability is pretty good. I like the concept, and think the nose was spot on. Taste was a little less dialed in, and overall, it was nice to try."
"O: This was most certainly a unique beer. Definitely more of a herbal and spice forward drink than traditional hop and malt beers. Worth a try and I'm glad I did, but I don't think I'll be revisiting this one."
""
"Poured a hazy, bright orange-amber with a finger or so of foamy white head that retained well, leaving some doily lacing on the glass. Lots of pronounced spice in the nose, bready yeast, touches of fruit esters. Taste is definitely spice-driven, kind of exploring the whole spectrum, with chamomile the dominant factor; yeasty profile, with a medley of fruits and vegetables, with notes of melon, pear, and sweet potato most dominant to me. A little thicker than medium in the mouthfeel, with some booziness in the finish/aftertaste. Pretty solid beer; could be a lady-pleaser, as my wife couldn't get enough of it."
""
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a slightly hazy yellow-orange with a one finger slightly off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, spices, herbs, fruit, and subtle tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, spices, fruit, and herbs. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I was a little letdown by this one as I went into it expecting a nice and complex brew, but found it to be very one note with the spice and herb character going on in both the flavor and aroma. For what it lacked in complexity, it made up for it with the refreshment aspect. This is a good thing when you aren’t craving something to challenge your palate. Worth trying to get your take on it, but that is about it."
"Overall a unique beer but not one I'll seek out again."
"Hazy deep orange colour, one finger off white head, light lacing left on the glass. Smell is incredibly fragrant and spicy, floral, ginger, yeasty with a light funky presence, orange and coriander, almost Orval like in terms of the musty-ginger scents but far less intense Taste is packed with spice and floral flavours, ginger, coriander and whole bunch of spicy herbal flavours that are tough to place exactly what they are, lightly tart at points, fairly dry overall with emphasis on the finish. Med-high carbonation, medium body with a fairly pleasant weight throughout. Certainly an interesting brew that grew on me as it warmed, initially the spice is sever but is integrated better about halfway through the bottle, quite drinkable and fairly solid."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a yeast filled, creamy smooth texture. It boasts a modest level of carbonation that keeps things somewhat light in the mouth despite the herbal flavors and unhidden alcohol inclusion. Worth a try but this reoccuring sulfuric character I could do without."
"O: One of Stillwater's better beers. Not as unique and complex as Southampton's Cuvee de Fleurs, but still has a good combination of flower flavors, and the light body makes it fairly easy drinking. Living in Maryland, the $6 I paid is probably lower than many other places, and it's still a bit steep, but I might pick this up from time to time."
"Pours a hazy deep orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, dry yeast, small fruitiness, and a nice earthy presence. In the taste, a hint of fruit and a small dry yeast and earthiness. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, small fruit and yeast presence in the aftertaste. Nice fruitiness and earth, I would have said this is a saison, not a herbed/ spiced beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: despite the huge creaminess, I still don't love the beer overall. Its spicing is nice and subtle, but it's just not a beer that draws me in."
""
"O - Delicate aroma and subtle flavor, balanced and refreshing, decent brew."
"Another tasty and intricate beer from Stillwater. Delicate, complex, and unique, and they totally nailed that ""essence of Spring"" thing they were going for. My second favorite of theirs next to Cellar Door."
""
""

"Poured with much foaming and commotion into a Nostradamus flute. Poured an odd cloudy golden orange amber. Bottle was a gusher and I lost a bit before I got it to the glass. Formed a quite nice two finger fine white head with lots of lacing and nice retention. Aroma of Belgian spicing, clove and cinnamon, light citrus, slightly mineral. Flavor is an unusual dry malt and light fruit with a complex herbal component, most noteably rosemary and other mint herbs. Flavor changes to light fruit then finishes with floral notes, a hint of ginger and somewhat dry. An unusual flavor combination that almost doesn’t work, but the flavor progression kept me interested and wanting to try it again. Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess. I liked this. I have found Stillwater beers to be unusual and somewhat challenging, but usually very enjoyable. I'm glad they make it out west and I will always try anything new from them."
""
""
"O: A bit sweet and thick for a Saison, but the spiciness balancess the beer well. I enjoyed this beer."
"O: I find this beer quite pleasant. Full on spicy, herbal, earthy and dry paired with a mild Belgian funk works for me. Would make a beautiful Spring beverage. Very refreshing. Now Stillwater just has to work on their bottles NOT EXPLODING!"
""
"I'm a bit torn. I think this is a very interesting, if off-putting beer. Stillwater is trying to do something different, and I think they could succeed if they turn the carbonation down a notch. Really, it's just the mouthfeel that holds this back. I like the complexity in the yeast, held up by a strong Belgian pale backbone which knows how to take a backseat to other flavors. I'd like to try this on tap to see if the feel is different. Very interesting, but for the price and considering everything, this isn't something I'll reach for much in the future."
""
""
"Taste is mostly of rose, floral, malty...its not good at all. Bitter in the mouth...not pleasant at all. If I didnt pay $9 for it, and there was a drain next to me, I would have dumped it. This may be one of the worst beers I ever had. As the name suggests, you will Regret it."
""
""
"This pours a cloudy straw colored. There’s a light aroma of tropical fruit. Tastes reminiscent of passionfruit and pineapple, a bit of mango and an earthiness. Very fizzy, effervescent, with a dry finish and a touch of white tea. Earthy, funky, spicy, zesty. It’s an intriguing brew with more in store than your typical saison."
""
""
"O- This is not a bad beer but it is not great. I am a big fan of Stillwater, but this is as big of a disappointment as Barrel-Aged Existent. Even though this beer was a disappoint, I am still very happy that I got to try this and enjoyed drinking it."
""
"My second Stillwater. Dark amber pour into a tulip yields decent head and lacing. Very herbal nose - Rosemaryish...Sage. Aggressively spicey taste. Yeasty, with the aforementioned rosemary and sage exteremely prominant. Smooth body. Very nice mouthfeel. Glad to have this in such a small bottle format. An interesting beer to be sure, but much more would have been dificult to finish."
"The body is light and the carbonation is a bit too much. Overall this one isn't anything special. I'll drink it, but I don't need more at all."

"Bottle from Riley's in Madison. heather, chamomile, lavender, & dandelion, make for a floral and herbal taste combination that is interesting and different. Not great taste, but sippable and unique. Great generous retained head. Tad above average mouthfeel."
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer but a bit pricey at $6 for a 350ml bottle."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice floral elements really blend nicely with the rest of the beer. Some of the other flavors could have been a bit stronger though."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking bright orange color with a big foamy head on top. The smell of the beer was floral and spicy on the nose. The taste of the beer was also very unique, herbal spices mixed with some floral hoppy liveliness. Really a bright flavored brew for in the warmer months. The mouthfeel was light and refreshing feeling. Overall this brew was quite nice in my opinion."
"Bottle shared at the September iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours light amber with an off-white head. Huge heather aroma, grass, salt, flowers, pumpkin. Flavor retains the heather, the saltiness gets a little fishy, some smoke comes through, and there’s a fruity, fusely finish. Strange. The brewers set out to make a saison reminiscent of a breezy meadow but it doesn’t really come close."
"like a meadow, grassy, and lightly spiced with hints of corriander, and almost nutmeg, Huge notes of flowers as I reach in for a whiff. Very floral and hints of almost sage like smells bouncing off the glass, really very well done. Light and airy and even after a few moments it really seemed to pull itself together quite nicely. Clean, crisp, light and Light grape skins, hints of grass and flowers, light grains and a mellow, and wonderful flowery flavor that just really set it apart and left me looking for sip after sip. Smooth, elegant and very drinkable."
"Flavor follows... I can certainly pick out a large coriander presence here, some nice vegetal pepperiness--reminds me of certain species of basil, or asian cilantro. Loads of yeasty phenols are present. Very unique beer, and tasty. Wish it came in 750s instead of 12oz, and in larger numbers."
"EDIT- I didn't know this actually had flowers in it, I thought it was a weird yeast. Makes sense now, although score still stands."
"o - i'm a big fan of stillwater. for my money, you can't find a better saison (possibly even beer) than cellar door. the other offerings from brian are all quality, but hide in cellar door's shadow. i like to see other styles than farmhouse from stillwater. this one is pretty good."
"Man, this beer was so close to scoring a little higher. I let it warm a bit out the fridgee. Poured with a mammoth, billowy, foamy, frothy, fluffy, sudsy, cream colored head that slowly settled down and a little lace. Color is a cloudy amber apricot with lots of very active bubble trails and trub bits floating around. Aroma is like their description - herbal, grassy, plus yeast, musty, and a little malt. Flavor's like the nose with the herbs coming out more, a hefty bite from the yeast, and a serious tang from heavy carbonation. Body is ok and carbonation, well, I already said. Finish is herbal with an odd sweetness that wasn't there before and is fairly short. Pretty good saison, but not a session."
"highly carbonated the beer forms a huge frothy head that's difficult to contain in the Piraat tulip I poured it into. smells herby, like oregano off the bat. Fresh garden, floral notes as well as strong yeast notes. The taste is just as herby, this seems like it would be perfect with Italian dinner. A little zest and citrus. Very dry, slightly funky. A very interesting brew. I like the flavors but can see this being overpowering. I wish I had some food or cheese to temper it down a bit as the herbs can be strong. I enjoyed this brew a lot as it was just what I was in the mood for, though I'm not sure that will often be the case as you need to be ready."
"Overall this is my least favorite Stillwater to date, I think the spiciness is too strong and results in the phenolic character. Perhaps it’ll mellow out with some time."
"O- The brassy wheat and stale spiced dominate. There is a faint cinnamon or ginger heat to the spice but it is a bit to oxidized to have much character. The yeast and brett notes offer some nice character but they are covered up."
"Well I am all in on Stillwater now. This has a very unique flavor, and it's very tasty."
"O: Overall, this looked and smelled great but was sort of a chore to drink. I'd like to revisit this on draft, if at all possible, to re-evaluate."
"Absolutely amazing brew for people who like heavy herbs and spice elements in their brew."
"Overall I really liked this beer but it's too expensive for me to go back and get another. Worth the experience but I wouldn't buy more than one or two if I were you. You can get similar brews for a cheaper price."
"O: This is definitely a unique saison and is a beer that I would want to try again."
"Medium bodied and fuller than expected with a heavy dose of tight carbonation up front as well as a very earthy/floral flavor. It's also heavily spiced with zesty pepper and clove. This is countered by a sweet estery yeast presence with hints of citrus and crisp light fruit. I'm picking up hints of apple, pear and banana as well as some lemon zest and orange peel. The floral notes compliment the fruit notes very well and balance out the heavy carbonation and prominent spice character. There's some slight alcohol sweetness but overall the ABV is well masked, resulting in a pretty drinkable beer."
"Clear orange-golden, poured with no head. Taste and aroma very nicely balance traits of both Saisons and Tripels. ""Belgian Saison"" seems redundant, but there's definitely a blending of styles here. Fruity esters; mild sweetness; clean, lightly bitter finish. Good carbonation. Nice, highly drinkable beer."
"O: A very interesting beer which I will probably not buy again. Stillwater offers so many unique choices that are far better than this."
"This is a must have simply because of it's complexity. You may not want it everyday, or even every month, but it has vast and complex merit, even for a complex style of beer, this stands out."
"Mouth is light & dry. Flavor is similar to nose. Finish leaves a lingering unwanted soapy note. There's just something unlovable about this beer: it misses the farmy notes of a saison and includes flavors that just make this beer unpleasant."
"D-Really not what I was expecting, it is definitely a departure from what you would normally get. It was very fresh and bright tasting, but the aroma was a little off putting. I also found the flavor to be just a little watery, but overall it was pretty good. Certainly not the best from Stillwater, but worth a try."
"This is a seriously spiced up saison, lots of lavender. I think I actually prefer the Our Side for flavor and just need to revisit it as it builds come carbonation. Interesting beer."
"Mouthfeel is thin and finish is bone dry. This is easily the best part of the beer. Flavor does not linger on the palate at all, thank god. I was excited to try Stillwater as they've just become available in my area. This one was a complete miss though. I'll give them another shot for sure, just hoping the next is a little more subtle flavored."
"D - Good. nice floral mix here. A little too over the top to session but it was quite interesting and worth a shot."
"Flavor is sweet, fruity, spicy and herbal. Lots going on here. Pretty complex and tasty brew. Spicy cinnamon-y notes in the finish. Very light bitterness. Light to Medium mouthfeel, oily texture and soft carbonation makes for quite a pleasant drink."
"Oh boy, found a bottle of this at the Village Pump and grabbed it as soon as I looked at it. Had with some lamb dinner and the pairing was pretty great. Pours a cloudy brown with minimal carbonation on the head, but you can taste it even if you can't see it. The smell is where I'm first grabbed, though. You can tell there's both something sweet and spicy in the drink - very pleasant. Those same notes are the foundation for an amazing taste. Stillwater's balanced that sweetness alongside that spice for a taste that develops really quickly in the mouth. The great thing about it is that these tastes come in a sequence, not all at once. And still better, I think I get the spice first, which makes the whole sweet ending even better. Loved the beer, can't wait to find more their import series or other small batches from them."
"CHEERS!!"
"It's quite a nice beer with an eloquent, expansive aroma followed by a more subtle, focused flavor. You could quaff this beer but you would miss all of its beautiful nuance. Superb!"
"D - I was able to finish a 33cl bottle, which is a feat considering I generally dislike this style of beer. That being said, I don't think I could have more than one in a session, and I wouldn't actively seek this out. If you live for spiced beers though, this one is for you!"
"D: This was a very tasty and refreshing beer that could be suitable for any season. Spicy taste is better for cold months, but light body is better for warm months. There was no alcohol noticeable, so it was super easy to drink. But the beer is interesting enough to warrant sipping and savoring, too. High quality saison. Impressive."
"The taste is very saisonesq with a nice a creamy finish. More than anything I get pineapple notes that really make this an exceptional beer."
"Drinkability is very good - no alcohol to really be found other than just a bit of warming in the stomach, and a beautifully put together beer overall."
"*edit, I'm not changing the rating. But as I get to the end of this beer, it seems more and more of a mess, there's a meaty flavor, autolysis? It's a shame because I like the intentions and the overall flavor of this beer, but it seems as if a lot of things have gone wrong here."
"D: Another winner from Stillwater. The saisons that this joint is pumping out are phenomenal. Spicy, complex, overpowering."
"Pours a cloudy rusty orange color with very little foam at all. There is a little bit of suspended bits throughout the beer. Aroma seems to be mostly coriander, pepper, ginger and some sweet malts. Very dry mouthfeel, light bodied with slightly higher than wanted carbonation, the flavor is very ""herby", chamomile, lavender, etc. flowery with just a hint of the coriander. Hops take a back seat and leave just a slightly bitter finish. I'm not sure if i would buy this again, very floral and flowery."
"Pours a light rusty copper with a four finger white head. No real lacing as it goes down. Nose brings forth strong, fresh herbs; seems to be rosemary and sage. Slightly sweet and maybe a bit of pine. Taste brings the components together along with a bit of earth. Quite nice overall. Feel is overly light and undercarbonated. Drinks fairly well, though some of the spicing gets to be a bit much."
"Remnants of my massive Saison tasting I had last weekend. It's always nice when you have so much beer left over that you can sit down and review the leftovers during the next week. Poured a 11.2oz skinny into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours a color that I can only explain as this. It's the color of a orange that has been sitting in your fridge for about a month. When its taken on that bruised, darkish brown orange but hasn't started growing penicillin yet. A nice 2 inch white cap leaves behind some sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. HOLY SHIT! This is the most intensely aroma'd beer I have ever had the pleasure/displeasure of placing under my nose. Jesus. Its like Sage had a threesome with Lavender and Rosemary and because they were such sluts, Green peppercorn decided to come in and tag team. Jesus. This aroma is intense. INTENSE. Herbal and flora and spicy. I cant tell you if its absolutely fantastic or the most overwhelming thing I have ever smelled mixed with alcohol. The flavor is a massive blast of Lavender. Like sucking on fresh flower petals. Its herbality is toned down buts still, sage and rosemary lay a bit of a smack down. Just a little dried parsley too. The mouthfeel has that great dryness that every excellent saison should have but encapsulates this flavor that I'm just not sure on. Really, I just don't know if I should love this beer or hate it. I feel like I really need about 1/2 a case more to really decide but since I only have the 1 bottle, I have to review off of that. So it comes to that. I either hate it or love it, and I really cant decide which."
"An american form. So essentially not funky open fermentation feel, but herbal spiced feel. Pour is golden not particularly cloudy. served as evidents for the lack of balance in the malt. Mild lemon hop with a predominate sage and rosemary herb. Not as meaty as one would like. Quite soapy dry. Towards the end a nice subtle bitter honey. Needs more of that."
"Interesting saison-esque beer. My only qualm is that the aroma gets rather perfumey. There's a fair bit of spiciness and a lot of floral flavor. The beer tastes less perfumey and more yeasty. It's a good earthy, funky yeast. The mouthfeel is a smooth and relatively low on bubbles. The beer pours a rich amber with an off-white head. It's a good beer, but I was a bit thrown by the floral notes of the aroma."
"D: The nose was just far too much for me. The flavor was an improvement, but not really my style."
"D: I can see where some people wouldn't like this. It's a departure from most saisons and spice-laden. To me, it's complex, flavorful and drinkable."
"For some reason I expected more from this beer. A little too herbal and under carbonated for my liking. Not one I'd get again."
"If you thought the Stone/Victory/DFH Saison Du BUFF was over-herbed, you should stay away. OTOH, if you liked that, there's a good chance you'll love this."
"D: Like I stated, very much like DFH ""Sah'Tea", but with a bit darker plum-like aftertaste. This added to the complexity. No alcohol detected."
"Overall, a very unique saison. This one just tasted different than many of the others I have had. It brought a few unique flavors to it. Fairly drinkable."
"D: In the end, the beer is a bit too ""one note"" for my liking. A trap many floral saisons run into. A solid effort though and certainly doesn't diminish my interest in Stillwater's import series."
"D - Like Stillwater's Stateside, this is infinitely drinkable. It's interesting to drink this and compare it to Stateside Saison to see how one can get different flavors in the same style beer from the same brewmaster but from different breweries and other variables."
"A nice collab between countries with the ingredients kinda blurred into a weird saison. Not really feeling the taste or feel of this one, perhaps some months in the cellar will shift some things around but for now, naw."
"Beer is medium in body and quite spicy. Again I get some tea, earthiness and a little pepper. What part is the love and which part is the regret? Beer is quite creamy, its almost like a cask ale in a bottle. Very nice mouthfeel. Taste is complicated. Its not very bitter its mostly mildly sweet up front with this spiciness in the midpalate. Finishes a little dry but not too much. Its good. A fun and interesting beer."
"Hazed lemony amber color with a dense, foamy cream colored head with long lasting retention and foamy clumps of lacing. Aroma is thick and pungent, with earthy and zesty notes (lemon, grass, dandelion, lavender) and a surprising mild brown sugar sweetness. My expected reference point for this beer was Southampton's Cuvee de Fleurs and well...this isn't really anything like that. There is a strong caramel malt and sweet yeasty body, while each sip showcases a different earthy and floral note throughout a slightly sour long lasting finish. The spices and zest are dominated alternating-ly by lemon zest, feint grassy hops, dandelion, cardamom, pear, brown sugar, etc. Mouthfeel is a little thicker and over carbonated than desired for the style and overall the beer comes off a little heavier and more filling than expected. Very unique and enjoyable, however something is slightly lacking in the balance for these unique flavors to rate this higher. Regardless, highly recommended to give this a try if you're able to find it."
