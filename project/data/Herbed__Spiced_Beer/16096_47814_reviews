"Overall - not a fan.  Too sweet and to much clove"
""
""
""
"O- this is an above average beer.  the spices come out great in the nose but tend to cross each other up in the flavor."
"Overall, much better than I was expecting.  A great winter time beer to warm you up on a Christmas Eve or during Nor'Easter Blizzard.  Glad I picked up this Elf as it wasn't that rude to me at all; was actually accommodating!"
""
""
"Overall, this was not an enjoyable beer.  I could have had the same experience from smoking a clove cigarette."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2013 vintage bottling. Pours slightly cloudy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, bread, candi sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pepper, herbal, allspice, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with solid balance and good complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, toast, candi sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pepper, herbal, allspice, and yeast earthiness. Moderate yeast/herbal spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, toast, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pepper, herbal, allspice, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast ester, spices, and malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly slick and moderately crisp/prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good spiced Belgian strong ale. All around good balance and complexity of yeast ester, spices, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall this is a very well balanced brew. Although this is billed as a Spiced Beer, and it is, the spices, along with the high, (10.5%) alcohol content make it a good choice for a winter warmer."
""
"Lots of booze here, which was a bit of a detriment to this beer. It felt strong and certainly put the ""warmer"" into this stylistically. While this was enjoyable, there wasn't a lot here that made this stand out and one would certainly be enough for a sitting. The spices weren't overwhelming like in a Wassail and on a cold Winter's night, this would be a fair choice, even without any accompanying food. The sweetness makes this more than a dessert unto itself."

"D: drinks like a Belgian tripel with the added spice of the holiday season. pretty fucking enjoyable if you ask me. if you want a strong Belgian styled holiday brew, this one should suffice and then some."
""
"o - not for me at this age. I will cellar it and report, as my gut tells me that's what it needs."

"I liked this one. Like I said, the aging has helped this one most likely, but the overall product is a solid one. Great for the holidays."

"A complex, full bodied drink. A nice seasonal ale to be savored. Good warming feel here. Nice big brew."

"Man, I saw this at the only place in Pittsburgh to carry it, and couldnt wait to try. What a disappointment! Way too much funk going on here! It's flat and tastes like a bad apple cider with tons of cinnamon and nutmeg. Yuk! Its extremely boozy and doesnt go down easy, tart & sour! it smells like a caramel apple, but in true honesty, it tastes like a bad version of the brewers best belgian dubbel home brew kit with little to no carbonation and lots of spices dumped in. Not a fan! Reading the other reviews, this could have been a bad bottle! confused --- the cork would not twist out and I had to get it out with a wine cork opener."
""
"Over-spiced, overly alcoholic, overly aggressive...& a very good beer. Thought this was going to be a short experience after the first sip, but this one really grew on me as it warmed a bit. If I had to drink a winter warmer, it might be this one. It'd certainly keep my guts warm at least."

"Overall I couldn't have more than two in a sitting but don't understand the complaint on ""too spiced"" seems just as spiced as balanced as the ""Devious"" pumpkin beer. I guess if I could find a four pack for around 10 dollars this beer would be quite a holiday favorite."

"Definitely tastes like christmas and has it's high points, but it just a bit too much. Not really getting any of the belgian influence though."

"Pours a hazy reddish brown color with a 1 finger khaki colored head which gives way to skim and edging. The edging leaves some sticky lace strands on the glass. The aroma is inviting there is aromas of nutmeg, cinnomon, ginger, and a candied yeast aroma. The aroma is big and bold. The taste follows suit but isn't as big. The taste has a candied yeast up front with notes of nutmeg, cinnomon, and spice in the middle. An alcohol taste comes through at the back end and there is a big of a cough syrupy aftertaste if you leave it on the tongue. The mouthfeel is sticky and moderately to lowly carbonated. Overall it is solid for the style, the taste falls a little bit off from the aroma but still a good beer."

"Appears a nice dark brownish-red. Smells very fruity with undertones of cinnamon, clove, and ginger. The first half of the taste was excellent, but I think this beer finishes weak. I would have liked the flavors to be more bold to take away the punch of the alcohol. I think with some minor tweaks, this could be an excellent holiday beer, but for now its just above average in my eyes."
"Appears to be a deep shade of brown in my glass, barely translucent. It's got a slightly off-white 'soda head,' which recedes to about 1/4 inch. Very inviting aroma in which the spices dominate - cherry, vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Reminds me of the spices used in Pumpkin Ales. Very sweet malty taste - it's good, but the finish is a bit heavy on cloves and the mouth feel is a little 'boozy.' Might put some people off. I'm ok with the amount of 'warming' going on here. This is a good selection for being snowed in."

"I would drink this again, it's a decent brew."

"Cloudy medium amber in appearance. Smell is foral to the nose, this smells nice. Mouthfeel, is nice, leaves well and very clean. Taste, we got it all here. This beer is a nice blend of spices. This is an exceptional Belgian style ale. Get some! Overall we found this brew to be very enjoyable, not to mention that the ABV is quite nice. We had this with some scotch eggs. Respect the beer, fridge worthy."
""
"D - Pretty good holiday brew. The alcohol is masked well although present. It's very sweet and spicy but not cloying. I would definitely buy this again."
""
"O: I like the idea of this beer, but not so much the execution. The mouthfeel is thin, the flavors are mild, and there is not much complexity."
"O: Nice appearance and nose if you look past the booze. Although the warming effect is quite nice the booziness is out of control and the spices are rather cloying."

"Enjoyed at the brew pub in downtown Allentown this special brew is served in a tulip glass. It shows a deep but clear rosy copper color with a nice fuzzy off-white head with good lacing. The aroma suggests definitive yet tasteful sweet clove and cinnamon allspice with a bayberry kiss. Very nice and tempting. The taste buds catch a beautifully christmasy bubblegum hop and grain mixed seamlessly with a green leaf edge. This is pretty close to being full bodied but it has lots of active carbonation that makes the feel a bit lighter and frothy so it goes down a little easier. Almost over-carbonated perhaps. The sweetness is definitely a bit cloying so I think this would go best with some form of food/cheese to help cut it a little. The taste definitely suggests the holidays but it doesn’t bring any clear cranberry or cinnamon, or whatever. To me the prevailing flavor is the very sweet bubblegum and the rest is a subtle mix that generally works but gets a little old kind of fast. Personally, in small quantities, it’s a real nice Christmas brew. At 12 ounces it seems a little tedious."

"O: The flavor is a bit overwhelming. It does mask the alcohol level if that's what you want. I would prefer a lower ABV less spicy beer personally."

"O: This is a solid beer with lots of Christmas spices in it. The only real problem I had with it was the overt amount of booze in it."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH GETTING!"
"Poured with a flourish leaving a a nice light tan head of very fine bubbles that settled into a tight collar, Spicy nose with cinnamon/nutmeg being most prominent then yeasty fruitiness. The mouthfeel is not as I expected...kinda on the light side. The taste however was very nice...hoppy bitterness up front then the spices followed by a nice alocohol warmth. Goes down easy...I like this one, it's no Mad Elf but warrants seeking out. I'll buy again."
"Your mouth feels clean at the finish with a small taste of spices leftover. This a beer you drink one of as it is 10.5 ABV. It Sure is a Holiday beer and very different a nice Job from the small Brewery in Allentown and Thanks to Jason from Epps Beverage for giving it to me to try! Give it a try it is very different. I give it a 4.0 overall rating"
"Not a bad beer, really. It does work to a certain degree but it is quite spicy. I am not disappointed."
"Rude Elf has a malty body and a spicy finish. The body is above medium but does not seem overly carbed up, which I feel works best with this style (whatever it is). Just seems a bit over spiced and a bit underattenuated. The alcohol heat does not help. I don't see why this has to be so high in alc. Content and I think that's what's holding the rude elf back."
"The spices may be a touch overwhelming and are quite varied. Given the style, this is not necessarily a bad thing given the style. Certainly worth a try."
"BA crimson liquid with a decent off-white head, this beer is a treat. The smell is a great mix of spices (cinnamon-like scents sticks out) and malt. Toffee, caramel, and lightly toasted bread crust. The state is quite strong...lots of alcohol. This is a sipping beer! Warming and moderately fruity (dark, rum-soaked fruit). Some esters and Belgian-sytle phenols. Full body. This is a solidly good holiday beer!"
"The flavor brings forward a large amount of cinnamon, ginger, and allspice. Some clove and booze are there as well. There is some light sweetness in the background. Moderate yeast character, though not much. Body is somewhat light for the style, though I'd say more toward medium overall. Low to moderate levels of carbonation. A bit strange and full of spices without much else. No real Belgian character. Not a big fan."
"Overall: I like that this is easy to drink for a 10.5% beer, and it had some nice spice to it. That being said, it lacked the complexity and b*&lls that a beer of this style should have. Worth a try if someone has them in their basement, but I would not pay for this again. Either way, Cheers!!"
"Drinkabilty: It's a sipper for sure. I think that the body doesn't complement the high ABV too well, but overall it's something worth trying."
"D/O- This beer is the definition of a sipper with the amount of alcohol in it. I've had beers that had bigger percentages of alcohol, but they hid their potency better than Rude Elf did. Personally I would have liked the spices and booze to have been toned down a notch and the Belgian yeast characteristics to have been upped a notch. I imagine that putting this beer in the cellar for one or two years will result in a very good beer. There's definitely better BSDAs out there, but if you can find a single of this go for it. Cheers."
"D - I was never really one to get overly excited about Winter/Christmas beers but this one has resurrected an interest to explore this particular style, very enjoyable. I could handle, maybe two of these. Three...pushing the limits. This is a really well brewed beer. GREAT job!"
"This beer needs a couple years in the cellar to round out the alcohol heat and hopefully the spices will settle. The flavors come across as a bit disjointed, but time would likely help blend things together."
"I found this highly enjoyable overall, and will seek it out in the future."
"On tap at the Allentown location. Pours a deep red, clear, with a small white head. Aroma of lots of spices -- ginger, cinnamon, gingerbread, clove. Flavor again is dominated by the spices mentioned above. Heavy mouthfeel. This was just a little overkill for me with all the spices and alcohol."
"The Rude Elf's Reserve was definitely worth the trip. Everything you could have hoped from a Belgian holiday beer. The green apple flavors were amazing and perfectly placed with the other spices and candi. A 1/2 gallon growler was going for about $25, so I didn't get one, but I'm kicking myself now. Guess I'll have to wait until next year to have one again."
