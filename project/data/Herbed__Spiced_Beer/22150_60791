3.84,1.3,3,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/16/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a small dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lacing. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, lavender, chamomile, clove, black pepper, herbal, straw, grass, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, herbal spices, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, lavender, chamomile, clove, black pepper, herbal, straw, grass, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, lavender, chamomile, clove, black pepper, herbal straw, grass, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast, herbal spices, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly herbal/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good herbal spiced saison. All around well balanced and robust fruity/spicy yeast, herbal spices, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 30, 2014"

It's a bit sweet and a bit dark for a Saison, but as a specialty it works. I probably would have purchased this beer if I know what I was getting into with a beer brewed with heather, chamomile, lavender and dandelion.

Flavor is an unusual dry malt and light fruit with a complex herbal component, most noteably rosemary and other mint herbs. Flavor changes to light fruit then finishes with floral notes, a hint of ginger and somewhat dry. An unusual flavor combination that almost doesn’t work, but the flavor progression kept me interested and wanting to try it again. Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess. I liked this.

You can tell there's both something sweet and spicy in the drink - very pleasant. Those same notes are the foundation for an amazing taste.

4.22,11.3,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"D: This was a very tasty and refreshing beer that could be suitable for any season. Spicy taste is better for cold months, but light body is better for warm months. There was no alcohol noticeable, so it was super easy to drink. But the beer is interesting enough to warrant sipping and savoring, too. High quality saison. Impressive.","Pencible","Nov 16, 2010"
3.87,2.1,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The taste is very saisonesq with a nice a creamy finish. More than anything I get pineapple notes that really make this an exceptional beer.","AndrewNations","Nov 13, 2010"
4.32,14,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability is very good - no alcohol to really be found other than just a bit of warming in the stomach, and a beautifully put together beer overall.","JohnQVegas","Nov 12, 2010"
3.52,-7.1,3.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"*edit, I'm not changing the rating. But as I get to the end of this beer, it seems more and more of a mess, there's a meaty flavor, autolysis? It's a shame because I like the intentions and the overall flavor of this beer, but it seems as if a lot of things have gone wrong here.","pitasoup","Oct 22, 2010"
4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D: Another winner from Stillwater. The saisons that this joint is pumping out are phenomenal. Spicy, complex, overpowering.","akorsak","Oct 14, 2010"
3.47,-8.4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a cloudy rusty orange color with very little foam at all. There is a little bit of suspended bits throughout the beer. Aroma seems to be mostly coriander, pepper, ginger and some sweet malts. Very dry mouthfeel, light bodied with slightly higher than wanted carbonation, the flavor is very ""herby", chamomile, lavender, etc. flowery with just a hint of the coriander. Hops take a back seat and leave just a slightly bitter finish. I'm not sure if i would buy this again, very floral and flowery.","mikereaser","Oct 05, 2010"
4,5.5,4,4,4.5,3,3.5,"Pours a light rusty copper with a four finger white head. No real lacing as it goes down. Nose brings forth strong, fresh herbs; seems to be rosemary and sage. Slightly sweet and maybe a bit of pine. Taste brings the components together along with a bit of earth. Quite nice overall. Feel is overly light and undercarbonated. Drinks fairly well, though some of the spicing gets to be a bit much.","Thorpe429","Sep 18, 2010"
3.16,-16.6,4,3,3,4,3,"Remnants of my massive Saison tasting I had last weekend. It's always nice when you have so much beer left over that you can sit down and review the leftovers during the next week. Poured a 11.2oz skinny into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours a color that I can only explain as this. It's the color of a orange that has been sitting in your fridge for about a month. When its taken on that bruised, darkish brown orange but hasn't started growing penicillin yet. A nice 2 inch white cap leaves behind some sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. HOLY SHIT! This is the most intensely aroma'd beer I have ever had the pleasure/displeasure of placing under my nose. Jesus. Its like Sage had a threesome with Lavender and Rosemary and because they were such sluts, Green peppercorn decided to come in and tag team. Jesus. This aroma is intense. INTENSE. Herbal and flora and spicy. I cant tell you if its absolutely fantastic or the most overwhelming thing I have ever smelled mixed with alcohol. The flavor is a massive blast of Lavender. Like sucking on fresh flower petals. Its herbality is toned down buts still, sage and rosemary lay a bit of a smack down. Just a little dried parsley too. The mouthfeel has that great dryness that every excellent saison should have but encapsulates this flavor that I'm just not sure on. Really, I just don't know if I should love this beer or hate it. I feel like I really need about 1/2 a case more to really decide but since I only have the 1 bottle, I have to review off of that. So it comes to that. I either hate it or love it, and I really cant decide which.","hwwty4","Sep 17, 2010"
3.77,-0.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"An american form. So essentially not funky open fermentation feel, but herbal spiced feel. Pour is golden not particularly cloudy. served as evidents for the lack of balance in the malt. Mild lemon hop with a predominate sage and rosemary herb. Not as meaty as one would like. Quite soapy dry. Towards the end a nice subtle bitter honey. Needs more of that.","rtepiak","Sep 12, 2010"
3.46,-8.7,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Interesting saison-esque beer. My only qualm is that the aroma gets rather perfumey. There's a fair bit of spiciness and a lot of floral flavor. The beer tastes less perfumey and more yeasty. It's a good earthy, funky yeast. The mouthfeel is a smooth and relatively low on bubbles. The beer pours a rich amber with an off-white head. It's a good beer, but I was a bit thrown by the floral notes of the aroma.","popery","Sep 09, 2010"
2.94,-22.4,4,2.5,3,4,2.5,"D: The nose was just far too much for me. The flavor was an improvement, but not really my style.","womencantsail","Sep 07, 2010"
4.35,14.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D: I can see where some people wouldn't like this. It's a departure from most saisons and spice-laden. To me, it's complex, flavorful and drinkable.","avalon07","Aug 31, 2010"
3.01,-20.6,4,3,3,2.5,3,"For some reason I expected more from this beer. A little too herbal and under carbonated for my liking. Not one I'd get again.","BigMike","Aug 31, 2010"
2.91,-23.2,4,3,2.5,3.5,3,"If you thought the Stone/Victory/DFH Saison Du BUFF was over-herbed, you should stay away. OTOH, if you liked that, there's a good chance you'll love this.","DefenCorps","Aug 29, 2010"
3.8,0.3,4,4,4,3,3.5,"D: Like I stated, very much like DFH ""Sah'Tea", but with a bit darker plum-like aftertaste. This added to the complexity. No alcohol detected.","Chaney","Aug 28, 2010"
3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, a very unique saison. This one just tasted different than many of the others I have had. It brought a few unique flavors to it. Fairly drinkable.","mothman","Aug 28, 2010"
3.55,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: In the end, the beer is a bit too ""one note"" for my liking. A trap many floral saisons run into. A solid effort though and certainly doesn't diminish my interest in Stillwater's import series.","callmemickey","Aug 22, 2010"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"D - Like Stillwater's Stateside, this is infinitely drinkable. It's interesting to drink this and compare it to Stateside Saison to see how one can get different flavors in the same style beer from the same brewmaster but from different breweries and other variables.","dzni","Beers"
3.35,-11.6,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"A nice collab between countries with the ingredients kinda blurred into a weird saison. Not really feeling the taste or feel of this one, perhaps some months in the cellar will shift some things around but for now, naw.","BARFLYB","0"
4.17,10,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Beer is medium in body and quite spicy. Again I get some tea, earthiness and a little pepper. What part is the love and which part is the regret? Beer is quite creamy, its almost like a cask ale in a bottle. Very nice mouthfeel. Taste is complicated. Its not very bitter its mostly mildly sweet up front with this spiciness in the midpalate. Finishes a little dry but not too much. Its good. A fun and interesting beer.","drabmuh","Beers"
4.07,7.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Hazed lemony amber color with a dense, foamy cream colored head with long lasting retention and foamy clumps of lacing. Aroma is thick and pungent, with earthy and zesty notes (lemon, grass, dandelion, lavender) and a surprising mild brown sugar sweetness. My expected reference point for this beer was Southampton's Cuvee de Fleurs and well...this isn't really anything like that. There is a strong caramel malt and sweet yeasty body, while each sip showcases a different earthy and floral note throughout a slightly sour long lasting finish. The spices and zest are dominated alternating-ly by lemon zest, feint grassy hops, dandelion, cardamom, pear, brown sugar, etc. Mouthfeel is a little thicker and over carbonated than desired for the style and overall the beer comes off a little heavier and more filling than expected. Very unique and enjoyable, however something is slightly lacking in the balance for these unique flavors to rate this higher. Regardless, highly recommended to give this a try if you're able to find it.","yourefragile","0"
