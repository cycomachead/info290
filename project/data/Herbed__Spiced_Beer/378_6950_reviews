"Overall: Decent change of pace. Works best as a summer night beer. Not as sweet as I'd anticipated. Worth a look."

"A very unique flavor to this beer. I must confess that I do no detect any ginger at all which makes me wonder whether I got a ""defective"" bottle. The aroma is overwhelmingly smoky. Forms a huge head even when poured carefully. Lovely color. The flavor is smoky with hints of caramel and a slight burn indicative of the ginger's presence."

"Overall: I like the taste of ginger and this beer features the spice in all its glory. If you do not like ginger, stay away. The ginger mixes well with the base of a pale malt. I could have several of these and find it to be one of Atlantic's better small bottle beers."
"O: completely fresh and untainted, this beer retains a refreshing fruity note along with a malty, yet light, foundation with a touch of spicy ginger - this bottle has some of that still intact, though it's been ... first had this beer at the brewery summer of '07, brought home a six-pack... it's just a pleasant twist on the standard light/crisp, blonde/wheat summer ale"

"Had this beer while on vacation in Bar Harbor Main. After hiking all day stumbled across this beer. It is very refreshing and I love the taste. Has a fruity smell, cloudy amber color, and a slight hint of ginger. I thought it was good enough to have my local liquer store order me a case."

"O: Easy to drink but I really wish the aromas and flavors of fresh ginger were more prevalent, more spicy, and more intense. Refreshing and a nice beer for the summer."
"The beer was poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, and it was a bright, hazy, orange-gold coloring with a filmy, foamy, white head. Nose of subtle ginger and toast. Flavors of sweet gingerbread, with a roasty/toasty highlight. Lemony ginger aftertaste, with a cookie character. Smooth, light bodied, with a frothy, clean finish. Very good brew."
""
""
"The taste is ginger-forward as to be expected. There is a milder pale malt note and moderate hop bitterness at the end. It does have a slight bite that the 5.2% ABV would not suggest. It is the kind of beer I really have to be in the mood for - not for regular drinking."

"Caramel-colored ale with a thin head and yellow highlights. Subtle flavors of ginger and yeast, and do I detect molasses? Has flavors of grass and yeast with a nice ginger kick. The ginger flavor is odd but not overpowering. I'm a big fan of unique brews, but this one just doesn't do it for me."
""
""

""

"The taste is fairly sweet at first, but it breaks down as you get used to it and it has a sort of tart finish. The ginger taste really makes it a refreshing drink. This would be a nice one for a day that was about 60 degrees warmer than today."

"Overall: Quite the enjoyable brew. Certainly will be having this one again. I see this being paired well with seafood or asian inspired foods."
""

"The mouthfeel is fortunately not watery and, while by no mean strong or heavy, could easily be lighter. It tends toward spritziness but doesn't fall too far."
"Taste is good. You can taste the ginger, but it is not overpowering. Beer has pleasant aftertaste and mouthfeel is about average. Overall, beer is pretty good and a nice specialty beer."

"OVERALL GRADE: C"
"Just bland and boring."
"Pours a fizzy apricot color, hazy with a tight champagne like head that settles to nothing. Raisin dried fruit nose. Herbal bitter spicy taste followed by a rush of water soaked hay. Candied Ginger after taste. Crisp refreshing carbonation could save this for fans of the style. Couldn't save it for me. There's actually a nice Ginger bite as it warms, but the straw after taste totally ruins this for me. I think it could work better in a different style. Maybe a Ginger Pale Ale?"
"Overall fairly meh, plenty of off flavors, sweet and syrupy with an extract like wheat flavor that I'm still not sure if it is extract or just very poorly done wheat beer, the ginger is barely there, and some phenols that don't belong."
"Pretty easy and interesting sessionable brew. The ginger is a welcome spiced flavor that is not overdone. It's there but it complements the beer flavors instead of overriding them. Definitely worth trying and as a fan of ginger, I would think you couldn't hope for much better than this out of a ginger spiced beer."
"Overall it seems like others said as a basic wheat ale with a bit of ginger added. Not enough to really notice but not too little to make this offensive. I am glad I tried an actual ginger beer."
"O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink and has some refreshing properties. It tastes like a summer ale with a twist of ginger."
"I might have one if offered but one would be enough. I really wanted more giner than this."
"Verdict - I picked this up because it looked like something a little different try, and I was right. Unlike any beer I've had before in terms of ginger and the spices that work alongside of it. Good to try once, but I would not invest any more into it."
"D: The suspended material does frighten me a bit, but otherwise, the macro spiced beer flavor isn't really doing it for me. The 5.2% ABV and sweet, light, summery spiced flavors might endear some, but there are far better styles and beers out there than can accomplish this task and so much more."
"D- I like this beer, seems like a decent summer offering to me."
"D: I couldnt drink the whole bottle. The ginger kept building up on itself, and the carbonation did little to scrup some of the flavor off the tongue. However, I did not get to drink it completely cold as I should have. As it warmed it seemed to get skunky. I would like to try this again while eating chinese food. The flavors may pair up better. What shall I do with the other 4?"
"Mount Desert Island Ginger is a cloudy, deep golden ale with a thin, bubbly white head that dissipates. It has a lightly sweet, malty aroma. It has a smooth, medium-light body with a slightly syrupy finish. It has a simple, light, malty flavor with a soft, spicy bitterness at the finish. The ginger is so subtle that I don't think I'd detect it if I hadn't read the bottle. It's pleasant and not really standout-- a casual session ale."
"Terrible! This beer was really gross.. Perhaps I just had an old bottle, because the average for this beer was pretty high. There wasn't much ginger flavor at all.. just a musty lager with a little after spice to it. I could only drink a few sips. I think I was expecting like a Reed's Ginger Ale, with alcohol. I woudn't order this again."
"Poured from bottle into Sam Adams drinking glass, amber color, decent head, lots of particles, overall not a bad unfiltered wheat beer but I expected more ginger flavor. Could be because these bottles appear to have been on the shelf for a while. I'd drink it again if it was offered, or on tap somewhere."
"First impression is how dry the beer is. This is not an overwhelmingly strong ginger ale. The ginger really only shows up on the swallow. The aftertaste is short. The liquid is what you'd expect from a typical ale."
"I give them an A for attempt but an E for effort."
"This beer is just not very enjoyable. That odd bitter flavor, long finish and strange aftertaste just doesn't work for me."
"This beer is highly carbonated, and it forms a voluminous head that subsides quickly. Typical cloudiness of a wheat beer, and no strong impressions from the smell. The taste is, again, typical of a wheat beer with some additional spiciness. The ginger is not strong but is clearly present. It is somewhat astringent in the mouth and has an aftertaste that is more characteristic of pickled ginger than of beer. This is NOT a ginger beer in the style of true ginger beers I have tasted in the South. It is a light, summer domestic wheat beer with some added spice. I agree with many other reviewers that the flavoring is not distinct, not crisp. I did not find it unpleasant overall and was willing to enjoy the second bottle. Occasional beer consumers who like Corona might find this a tad more interesting, but beer aficionados are likely to seek something that better represents the brewers' art. I do not expect to purchase this one again."
"D: Hard to imagine drinking this in multiples. Less then average enjoyment and ease of consumption. It is what it is, a ginger beer that comes off overbearingly sweet malt wise limiting multiples or repeatability. If curious try lefthands ginger over this, otherwise cant imagine what I would do with a six pack of this."
"I normally like wheat beers, but I'm not sure about this. Wheat normally sweetens a beer, but the ginger was just too much. I could never drink more than one of these in a night."
"D: Not very drinkable, this ended up being a drain pour for me."
"I can't say that this beer really excited me all that much. It's probably more drinkable on a hot summer day, but in the end it seemed like a regular wheat beer to me with just some extra spiciness."
"Picked up a 12oz. bottle of this at State Line. Poured into my nonic glass. Appears a cloudy golden yellow color with about an inch of off-white foam. Smells and tastes of sweet, grassy grains with a touch of real ginger root. There is certainly ginger in this brew. There's a slight burn on the tongue like a spicy ginger beer does. Crisp dry finish. Medium in both body and carbonation. I'm a fan of ginger beers and ginger ales and thought this was quite drinkable. I'm looking forward to revisiting this on a warm day."
"The aroma has fruit, wheat malt, alcohol, spices, cooked vegetables, and some hops. The appearance is amber/gold with a small head. There are lots of little chunks in it. The flavor is like the aroma but astringent with malt and very little ginger. The palate is thin. Not what I was expecting but interesting even if it's not really that good."
"Notes from 4/12/05"
"Yes, it is a ginger beer, yes it does have alcohol as it should. Out of the bottle the brew was a cloudy honey gold color with a thin white head. Little retention, however and the lacing left something to be desired. The aroma was strongly of floral hops, flowers in general and a pleasant but not overpowering spiciness. The flavors were at first semi-sweet, augmented by the spicy zip of ginger and a good balancing pale malt. Herbal hops Appeared later as a subtle but nice addition. The body was medium/light and the carbonation average. Well done for a spiced beer and quite summery."
"This beer pours a murky swamp water brown color. The head is nonexistent. The aroma is of ginger and nothing else. The taste is of ginger too, but it is a lot fainter than the aroma. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied. Overall, this is a bad beer. I will not be drinking this again."
"Cloudy dark amber color, nice inchish head that took a while to recede. The pour produced some carbonation reminiscient of Guinness, just on a smaller level. A nice white ale with ginger aroma, but not overwhelming at all. The taste is very similar, the ginger stays with you from the first taste to the aftertaste, but is never overpowering. A very nice, drinkable beer that would be perfect for a spring day out on the front porch."
"A hazy golden blonde color with a small amount of foam and no lacing. Smells slightly sweet, some wheat malt at play it seems, and a very subtle ginger note. Taste is very similar. Sweet up front, taste of ginger is minimal but present, a very average flavor. Nothing really stands out. Smooth and creamy in the mouth, very nice texture, moderate carbonation, but not enough to take away from the creaminess. Drinkable as hell, goes down very easy, just nothing overly-special or to seek out."
"Pours a rich gold color with little head that soon turns into no head. Mild if not poor carbonation to this one. The aroma was slightly sweet and definitely malty. The first couple of drinks hinted at a touch of ginger, but as this beer sat a while and warmed up a bit the ginger really came through. Toward the end not a single bubble of carbonation could be found and the ginger was overpowering. I think this would still be a weak wheat beer even if the ginger was removed from the recipe. Each sip reminded me more and more of Asian stir fry and less and less of beer."
"This is a tastey brew. I love the taste of fresh ginger, but it can be overpowering. This is not. The color is very interesting, a light maple, appears much heavier than it is. Surprisingly refreshing as well."
"Pours a hazy, golden copper in color, topped with an off-white head and minimal lacing. Nose is muted ginger, bready malt, and a touch of sweet crystal malt. Seems to be on the sour-bitter side. Chunks of ginger (and yeast?) partially suspended at the bottom of the glass - less visually appealing than I'd hoped. On the first sip this one is fairly crisp and spicy, but that quickly gives way to a rounder, smoother malt profile that's mildly sweet. Residual ginger character lingers and provides some counterpoint to the sweetness, but it's not a very pronounced contrast. Tanginess lingers nicely, along with an even more subtle vegetal quality and ""heat"" from the ginger, and this is more rewarding than the bite of the ginger on the first sip. No hops here that I can detect. Lighter in body and mouthfeel, this one is also fairly low in alcohol. Along with the sour aspect I detected on the nose, there's a good drink-ability to this one. Neither as strong nor as full-bodied as the last ginger-ale I've tried (the 'Real Ginger' from Kiuchi), this one is a welcome addition to a style that isn't very widely available in the U.S. Worth a try if you come across it."
"Drinkability: Great like most wheat beers. This is a definite summer quencher. Would pair well with grilled foods or SUSHI!"
"D- This was a surprisingly good beer. I could see myself getting this again. Nice for something a little different."
"Buy yourself a thermos or something to keep it cold and pour a few for the sand and shore. KEEP THEM BOTTLES OF THE BEACH BEYATCH!!!"
"It pours an opaque orange-amber with a fairly thick off-whitehead. Aroma is rich and malty with a strong undertone of orange. Flavor is crisp and malty, somewhat citrus fruity, with just a whisper of hops. It goes down smoothly and is very refreshing and delightful."
"This beer has a very interesting flavor. Not really sure if I really dig this one though. It tastes more like a fruit juice than a beer."
"First time with style of beer.Pours a cloudy golden with an orange hue. Not much head or laceing.Aroma is of ginger,wheat,and spices. Body is medium,but over carbonated. Taste is tangy,and spiced. Seems like they threw a little bit of everything in the pot,and got it to work!"
"D - Very flavorful once the foaming allows the tasting to begin, but more aroma attention was given. This is one of the better spiced American wheats I have taste in the last year. I have had few ales w/ ginger to compare this to, I appreciated the mix of ginger and wheat overall. Atlantic brewing makes a nice variety of ales - at least the couple I have had the pleasure of tasting. This is probably a choice best suited for those that appreciate fresh ginger, but I think it would go well w/ a variety of dishes or as a digestif."
"Music: Chris Liberator live @ Rotation in Iowa City"
"D-Very unique and I love the brewery's attempt at using ginger in a session beer. I have used it in the past, but find it works best with high gravity Belgians. They did a good job and could see this being decent on a hot summer afternoon in the marina."
"Overall, just an average spiced beer, wish the ginger would be a little more overpowering for the type of beer it's supposed to be."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours a golden amber color with a small head that dissipates to nothing - no ring of foam, nada. Aroma of ginger root with a bit of lime hiding in the background. Taste is spicy ginger root with a bit of citrus and a decent malt backbone to balance it all quite nicely, Hops are way in the background, but I found this to be an enjoyable attribute, probably because I usually drink hoppy beers and this was a nice change. Goes great with asian food, but it's enjoyable by itself, but I couldn't drink more than one or two at a time. Nicely crafted beer, definitely worth a try."
"At first you taste a delicate ginger blanket of flavor...followed by your usual malts and hops and, in this case, some additional spices. little to no aftertaste and surprisingly easy to drink for a spiced beer. Went well with the asian takeout ordered...not sure how great it would be in other situations though..."
"This was a very interesting drink. I never had a ginger beer before and this one did a good job to perk my interest but it didn't give me that unique taste I was hoping for either."
"D: Probably the best beer I have had from Atlantic Brewing Co. Well balanced and well made. Excellent drinkability (particularly for an herbed/spiced beer). Nice and tasty."
"Better than I thought, and certainly much more balanced. I just can't really think of a situation where a ginger ale would be perfect. Maybe if I was sick..."
"Drinkability - a fine beer for ginger fans, not sure how many I could have in succession though."
"Hazy, pale amber color. Thin white head. Aroma of yeast and some spiciness to it. More honey then ginger. Lemony and spicy flavor-like the aroma I detect no ginger. Malty enough but the weird spiciness detracts from the overall flavor. OK body-somewhat thin and dull. Overall its rather average but well on its way to not impressing me. Reminds me of shandy or something strangely British. Not for me."
"Pours a hazy amber with little carbonation and a thin head that fizzles to nothing. Smells very malty, worty even, with faint ginger. Taste is similar, but rather nutty as well. Ginger could stand out more for my tastes and would help to make this more refreshing, I feel. Finishes a bit dry and yeasty. Mouthfeel is moderate and has kind of weak carbonation. Decent beer all around."
"Drinkability- It was okay. It is drinkable but not a beer I would recommend to friends."
"I was expecting something a little more along the lines of a refreshing beer for summer with the ginger and all, but this sort of threw me for a loop. It wasn't bad, but reminded me more of a Fall beer with the taste and spicing. More along the lines of a pumpkin flavored beer, sans the pumpkin, of course. It just had a real earthiness to it. This was good but I can't see consuming one or two in a sitting. Flavor isn't quite desirable enough for a session beer and I can't think of a situation where I'd say, ""Hmm, I'm the the mood for a ginger beer."" Worth trying at least."
"Poured a very pleasant copper/amber color. Light carbonation with a fairly short-lived white head. Good taste, with the spice of the ginger being very pronounced but not overpowering. Added to the spice of the ginger was a noticable fruitiness. Overall, a very tasty choice and good example of a ""summer beer""."
"Poured SLOWLY from a 12oz botter with almost no head or lacing; this unfiltered beer had bits of ginger visible in glass. A light copper color and cloudy with little carbonation. Definite smell of ginger and honey with mild hops fragrants. Taste was suprisingly dry with a sweet honey tast and just a hint of bitter hoppiness at the end. Mouthfeel was medium with little foam or acidity. Very drinkable but nothing that stands out as exciting."
"Smells of sweet and spicy ginger. It pours a light brown amber color with suspended sediment and topped with a mild-sized head. Lightly sweet with a tart, spicy ginger splash. Makes a refreshing and invigorating brew. Finishes a little dry and gingery. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Enjoyable and fun."
"Worth a try"
"D- its drinkable but not very enjoyable. Its worth a try if its something that you have never had."
"This pours a hazy, fizzy light copper color. The head instantly dissipates. Ginger is immediately apparent in the nose, along with a sweet, apple-juice type aroma. Flavor is well-balanced, with pleasantly spicy ginger, a little sweet wheat malt, and a very clean yeast character. Bitterness is low, but the ginger takes the edge of the sweetness. Well-attenuated, crisp, and dry texture."
"Drinkability: Too sweet for my taste. Not even comparable to Left Hand's Juju Ginger."
"Overall, a nice beer but I'm not certain if I would buy again in the future. Not certain if ginger mixed with beer is my thing."
"pretty easy drinking beer, great in the sun."
"Tastes bready.slightly sweet,a taste of ginger.A medium mouthfeel,with a slight bitterness and sourness at the finish.This beer just didn't do anything for me.It was a little on the bland side.The ginger flavor was not overpowering,but it was there.It was better than the last ginger beer I tasted.Nothing to get excited about here."
"D - Overall, this is a damn good beer. Not a session beer, but one could definitely enjoy a couple of these at a time. One note of caution, however. While the ginger flavor isn't overly strong, the taste will remain on the palate for several hours, even after consuming another style/brand of beer."
"Mount Desert Island Ginger is a bit of a niche beer. I'm not sure if there are enough ginger lovers out there for it to sell like hotcakes, but then I could just as easily not know what the hell I'm talking about. It seems to me that being a little more ginger with the ginger root would have made for a better beer."
"This beer is an amber/orange color with a thin white head that does not last long. Aroma of sweet ginger and wheat. Light-bodied and spicy with a good amount of ginger flavor. Some malt and wheat in the background as well. More spiciness in the finish, again with ginger dominating. There is a touch of hops in the aftertaste too. The beer seems one-dimensional, although there is just enough going on behind the scenes to keep it from being below average."
"Atlantic Brewing's ginger beer pours a cloudy orange-amber beneath a short head of creamy off-white foam. The head retention, however, is limited; and it leaves very little, if any, lacing about the glass. The nose expresses exactly what you'll find in the flavor: wheat malt and ginger. It's not complex, but enjoyable; and it's nicely balanced by a firm bitterness beneath the zesty ginger. It's medium bodied and crisp, which adds to its refreshing nature. Nicely done!"
"Pours a cloudy light amber color with a very small head that falls fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is spicy and full of ginger. So much ginger that I don't get much else. The flavor isn't what I expected. There is plenty of ginger in there and not many other spices. There's also not much residual sweetness. The dryness takes away from the effect that the ginger could bring. The body is moderate to thin and the drinkability is ok. I probably won't have this one again."
"Cheers!"
"12 oz bottle. Beer poured a hazy orange color with a thick white head into a tulip glass. The aroma gives you some ginger hints but is dominated by the malt tones and a bit of hops. The taste is like the aroma, mainly malt tones but you get a bit more ginger on the tongue. Overall the body is rather light and the taste does not linger for very long."
"The ginger spice in the beer seemed bland and washed-out, lacking the spicy bite of fresh ginger root or the aromatic note of candied ginger. Moderate malt with some caramel influence which tended to overshadow the vague ginger flavor. Not a bad beer, but it did not call for another."
"I must admit I did take some and mix with Goslings rum and had myself a very nice ""dark & stormy"". I am all for enjoying this beer on its own but man did it make for a hell of a d&s."
"It's a terrific experiment: wheat and ginger. They combine for great sensations in the flavor and feel. Initial sip takes on lemony, a light belgian tartness, and a whollop of ginger flavor. The ginger plays 'hot' on in the mouth, combined with the modest alcohol, it becomes very spicy and dry. The wheat takes on citrus and bready aromas that translate well to flavor. The wheat base also becomes very American, which thins the body and weakens the flavor. If a German wheat base were used (allowing the creaminess of offset the spiciness), this would be a much better beer."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy peachy color with a patchy and thin head over top. Bubbles boil up, making swirls apprear atop the brew. I'm amazed that the head can't find a way to form, even with the solid carbonation. Aroma is very fruity and gingery. I get notes of apircot and banana with a very nice gingery zing. Lots of sweetness. I like it. Flavor is a little less bold than the aroma. The ginger is there on the start. It tastes like there is a bit of wheat in the base beer, as it has a slightly creamy flavor that I associate with wheat. If I would take the time to read the beer label before I start my review, I would see that this one is called a wheat ale brewed with fresh ginger. Mouthfeel is moderate, with a moderate carbonation of very fine bubbles. I think this beer really hits a homerun with what it sets out to be. It is every bit a wheat beer brewed with ginger. The ginger is very fresh and spicey, but not over the top and offensive. This one is a winner in my book."
"This was a pretty decent beer. It was a hazy orange color with a medium head and some nice carbonation. It had a sweet, spicy aroma. It tasted malty, with some spiciness (ginger), which was nicely warming. Fairly assertive, a fun beer to drink, not something to drink a lot of."
"This brew is a light, hazy orange color with a thick, moderately dense white head. Bottle conditioned. The aroma is fixed with a spicy ginger character and a bit of malt and faint hops. Theres a little maltiness underneath, and the ginger isnt overdone. Its floral, herbal, and just a little yeasty. The beer is fairly light, and well carbonated. Its just slightly sweet in the foretaste, with ginger coming out in the midtaste. The herbal and spiciness of the ginger linger through the finish. Its sort of refreshing, and I kept thinking that it would go well with sushi. Its not a satisfying, outstanding beer in its own right, but I think it is an excellent use of ginger. The spice doesnt overwhelm the beer, and its something different."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not great. A different beer that would probably go good with some Chinese stir fry. Interesting."
"d: one and done for me my friends. i recommend trying it, but after that, its on your shoulders"
"Drinkability and Overall: Wow!! What a huge difference between the taste and the smell. One of the best smelling wheat beers I've ever had, but one of the worst tasting. How crazy is that. Oh well, I gotta give Atlantic props because this is definitly a good idea, although not executed as well as it could have been."
"Overall, I was slightly disappointed. The kid in me wanted an overpowering ginger sensation, which this does not deliver. Also, I thought the coupling of ginger with a wheat ale rather odd. It seems like it might be more at home brewed in a lager."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is pretty good. The taste of ginger is very refreshing. Kinda carbonated but not too overwhelming. Drinkability is pretty high on this offering from Atlantic Brewing Company. Depending on if you like ginger or not will determine how you like this one. Would be good with sushi! Emma gives it two thumbs up as this is mostly her rating."
"I'm surprised to say that an herbed beer is a real smooth drinking summer style beer, but this definitely is. I liked it."
"Taste is also that grassy malt backed with a solid ginger bite. I feared the ginger may overwheln the beer and the palate but happily that is not the case. Quite well balanced with the spice assisting not dominating the overall flavor. Crisp and light to medium bodies. An easy drinker as well. A pleasant surprise, would be nice on a cool spring evening."
"Drinkability: This beer is great regardless of how cold it is outside. This will be a great lawnmower beer."
"Pours a golden-orange hue topped by a creamy, bright white one-finger head. Aroma of light floral hops, light sweet malt, orange peel, ginger, and honey. Palate is sweet up front, with notes of honey and sticky buns. Ginger comes out mid-palate, bringing a touch of spice. Finish is stronger ginger with a bit of citrus. Body is nice - light and slightly creamy. Tasty, yes, and probably much better suited for a summer day than a cold night in December. Nonetheless, I'm still not a huge fan of ginger-spiced beers in general."
"I enjoyed the beer very much, but maybe it's a bit of a one-hit wonder. More than two, for sure, would be overdoing it. Time to branch out and try something else different."
"It poured with a big, fluffy white head, but it rapidly dissipated and then disappeared almost entirely. The color was a cloudy medium to deep amber, but the color was secondary to the smell. Man, was it ever rich with ginger! I caught it on the nose, then again on the palate, and one last time on the finish. The bottle's label identifies the beer as ""wheat ale brewed with fresh ginger", but everything is just overwhelmed by the ginger. I liked the ginger, but it became a case of a little going a long way. I could see this as an accompaniment to a Thai meal, but on its own, it was a bit much. The mouthfeel was very full, almost creamy. An interesting beer that I am glad to have had the opportunity to review, but it wa just not my personal cup of tea."
"Ginger is obviously the primary flavor, and there are citrus, lemongrass, and malt notes underneath. Froths up nicely during each sip, and the aftertaste is a bit like uncarbonated ginger ale, with just a bit of metallic flavor intertwined as well. A very interesting brew - refreshing, unique, and I can picture it being a great pairing with Thai or other southeastern Asian food. Not the best of summer beers, but it's definitely worth a shot and enjoyable nice and slow. Another wonderful offering from Atlantic Brewing!"
"I poured this beer and drank it quickly. Why? because this is a well crafted beer. A refreshing wheat ale with the magic of ginger flavors blended in. Good beer."
"Drinkability: I like the ginger flavors and could enjoy this on a hot summer day; ultimately, however, the sweetness of this beer turns me off"
"A hazy golden yellow beer. Has a big white head. The aroma has a strong sweet but spicey ginger character with a hint of grapfruit hops in the background. The flavor has some sweetness up front with a combo of a light hop bitterness and a snap of ginger on the finish. The light mouth feel makes this a very pleasing and refreshing beer on a hot day standing by the grill. The ginger here is not like ginger ale (soda) by ginger beer (soda)."
"I am reviewing the two pints I had on tap at the brewery on my way traveling from St John NB to Bangor for a flight. The reason I mention this is because this beer loses everything when I sampled a few bottles. On tap this beer was much more lively and had a powerful ginger flavor. The appearance leaves something to be desired as the head quickly fades and has loads of carbonation. Smelled very aromatic ginger, sweetness. I enjoyed the taste. Sweet ginger up front with a bit of spices at the end and a sizzle of medium carbonation. I would have this beer more if I could get it on tap but I'm done messing with the bottles on this one. I brought back 2 sixer's and it had a strong bottlecap taste and lost alot of the strong ginger that I experienced on tap....Go To The Brewer."
"Appears a slightly hazy straw yellow in the glass. A small gathering of white bubbles forms on top but is quick to disappear leaving no lace on the glass. Aroma of ginger is present but not overpowering. A bit of sweet caramel malt is the backbone. Light but pleasant. Taste is similar with a bit of sweetness accompanied by a bit of spicy ginger. A touch of doughy malt. Leaves a ginger aftertaste that lingers for a bit. Mouthfeel is light to medium while being clean and crisp. Drinkability is good as this is refreshing and a bit different. It goes down easy and would probably pair well with most milder meals. Thanks to secret Santa and quarre for the bottle."
"Pours a hazy, light golden color. Thin white head disappears quickly. Smells of ginger, and a touch earthy. Slight bready malt, with some sweetness mixes well with the ginger. Seems to be a good amount of ginger, but not overwhelming. Very smooth for being spiced so well. Light body, and moderate carbonation. I enjoy spiced beers from time to time, and this one seems to be one of the better ones."
"Pours a hazy pale straw color with hints of orange in the mix. Aromas are dominated by ginger with hints of light malts in the background. For flavor this brew is full of ginger from the beginning to end, with a light creaminess to it, hints of pale malts here and there, and a light almost spicy finish. The body to this beer was fairly light and the brew went down fairly easily. For someone who isn't very particular about ginger this beer was definetly decent, and worth a try for those who do in fact like ginger.. A nice offering"
"Tatste is tart fruit with a dry ginger bite. Both the fruitiness and the bite of the ginger are fairly pronounced. I know that this beer is another one where location is key--on a hot beach it would be better and definitely more drinkable."
"Hazy gold body is topped by a respectable amount of white foam. The aroma is really more malt than ginger. Its got a nice dry hay malt flavor and aroma that makes this an exceedingly drinkable beer. The ginger is very mild. In fact, I wouldnt even know it was made with ginger, although I think the root spice creates a bit of vague spiciness that combines with the estery yeast flavors makes this almost seem like a mild Belgian ale. Im getting a little cinnamon and vanilla as well."
"Just looking at the bottle I can see flecks of spice gathered in the bottom. I poured this into a standard pint glass which revealed a pale amber body and a thin cap of foam that recedes to a paper thin layer of foam on top. I decided to go all out and just dump all the stuff from the bottom straight in. The aroma is basically dominated by ginger, I can detect hints of the subtle malted wheat in the background. This beer is sweet all the way through. A small swelling of malt in the beginning cruises into the big ginger flavors. This remarkably recreates the sensation of a ginger-snap cookie. A combination of the subtle hops, astringent wheat and spicy ginger creates a pang on the back of my palate that makes me want to take another drink. This brew is rather light in mouthfeel but the carbonation level is low, which is a good thing in this case. Ill have to admit this beer is a bit heavy on the ginger for me. I could imagine it pairing fantastically with Chinese or Thai food though."
"Worth a try, and the muted ginger melds well with the hops."
"Fuzzy, hazy peach appearance. Thin ivory white head. Lacing is adequate. Nice whiff of ginger blends with some minty and perfumey hop aromas. Some sweet malt is detected in the background. There's a nice taste to this beer. I'm not a big fan of ginger, but this is nicely spiced and pleasing to the buds. Fairly sweet overall. The malts seem a little bready and biscuity. Nice little touch of yeastiness. The ginger is held in check nicely and blends with the herbal tones from the hops nicely. This is a pretty good spiced brew. Beats the hell out of that JUJU Ginger beer I just had from Left Hand."
"Special thanks to benny Brew for the sample"
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pale malt scent with a hint of ginger lingering. It definately is spicey. The taste is good. It has a fine ginger flavor which is mellowed with the use of pale malts. It is a really smooth beer despite the spice. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking spice beer. It has good flavor and a smooth finish."
"ItDebarks from the 12 ounce brown bottle nebulous amber with a modest white head that is spumous in texture, the lace a thin slip to cover the glass. Nose is sweet, hints of ginger, and to me a cinnamon like aroma also present, nice to sniff at any rate, start is quite sweet, nice malt presence, top is moderate in feel. Finish has a nice benign acidity, the hops understated but pleasing to the palate, the aftertaste sweet and dry, a real nice summertime beer, and one that would sell well in arid-zona."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2""of white head, which quickly shrunk down to a lyaer of light foam. Very slight lacing over this slightly cloudy honey-golden brew. Aroma is of lightly of grain and a tinge of the advertised ginger, noticeable but not overpowering. Flavor seems a bit lacking in the malt area, and I expected a bit more ginger flavor than I can taste. The ginger does seem to bring out the crispness of the hops at the end a bit more, which is nice. Probably a nice warm weather brew, have to give it a try then, with a somewhat thin mouthfeel and the corresponding drinkability..."
"This brew surprised me. First the appearance was a nice cloudy light copper that a wheat brew should have. Alos, there was an adequate initail head. I expected to be overpowered by ginger, but was not. Instead, I detected a nice wheat aroma and a very light ginger presence. Taste was light, initially sweet then slightly bitter mid-palate. Finish was light with a hint of bitterness. Mouthfeel was fine with light carbonation and smoothness. Drinkability was fine too. Yes, I would have another if offered."
"A decent brew, although the ginger is a bit overpowering, and gets tiresome after about half a glass. This beer would be an excellent accompaniment to fish, particularly sushi. Not really something to drink in it's own, unless you really like ginger."
"The only part of this beer I liked was the aroma. Since I am not much of a fruit-beer drinker, I did not have a huge expectation that I would enjoy this. That being said, I do enjoy spiced beers, so I did think this might be different. It was not. Sort of a flat tasting beer (there was pleanty of carbonation) with little defining character other than a strong taste of ginger. To me it tasted like a weak wheat ale, with some ginger essence dropped in. I will find other beers to drink."
"This beer poured a lightly hazy (chill haze?), light amber color with fine bubbles and creamy, very white foam that settled but coated the glass a little bit. The smell was a slightly sweet, malty aroma with a hint of biscuit and hops. No detectable ginger in the smell. The taste was a sweet tangy malty taste up front, followed by some floral and bitter hops. There was a light fruitiness, but no real ginger flavor except for a hint of spice in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-light body and medium carbonation. The flavors lingered a bit as an aftertaste. This was an OK beer, but the lack of a clear ginger taste or smell was disappointing."
"I love ginger. I have brewed several beers with it myself and this is the first commercial brew I have had that uses ginger. I was a bit disappointed with the aroma. Ginger has a distinct aroma that a ginger lover such as myself should be able to pick up immediately, and it wasn't there. I found the wonderful spicey ginger bite in the aftertaste. It was a wonderful bright tingling on the tongue. This is definitely a beer to down on a hot summer day. Personally I think it could have used some more ginger."
"The label said ""wheat ale with ginger"" so I grabbed a six-pack because it sounded good and I've never tried it before.Poured a short lived head.Had a light gold color like maybe an apple juice.Appearance wasnt great with the head reducing to nothing an barely any traces of lace.Has a great and unique ginger flavor and aroma.Slight but lingering bitterness in the throat.So there is hops present but not tasted or smelled.Mouthfeel is a bit watery and could use a touch more malt.Aroma is all ginger.The ginger hides any wheat taste.Ginger might be a touch too strong because it overshadows any other flavor the beer might have.Has a pepper spicy finish."
"needed to complete an odd six pack so i reluctantly grabbed one of these. i say reluctantly as i have never been a fan of ginger beers, or any ginger flavoured beverage at that, and was thinking this one would be no different after the smell, which is quite heavy with ginger, but i was wrong. pours a dark gold with a decent head that dissolves to a steady thin lace. as mentioned, smells quite gingery, with a bit of honey. the taste is different, though. the ginger is apparent, yet not overwhelming. subtle, yet apparent. a nice kick to a traditional wheat beer. not bad."
"I liked this beer a lot. When I first saw it, I thought ""ginger""? But it was a great addition. It did not overpower the beer, nay, ti enhanced it. It did not leave that stinging taste sensation in your mouth, like ginger soda. I hope this is available in the summer, because it is fantastic. By the way, it's a wheat beer."
"Overall a good ale. Would be great in warm weather but is still pleasant in cold weather. IMHO I wish that it had a bit more ginger in its aroma and taste. I do love a strong ginger bite. Like that of Jamacian Ginger Beer."
"Disappointed with this, I was expecting a ginger nose - there was none and a ginger flavor also none.  Slight crispness but it was more like an ordinary lager.  The ABV is 5.2%."
"This is a unique brew in any weather.  Good yellow-brownish color with a light touch of ginger in the aroma.  The flavor of the ale has just enough ginger and a dry enough malt profile to create the impression of a beer rather than a soda.  Very nicely put together and refreshing."
