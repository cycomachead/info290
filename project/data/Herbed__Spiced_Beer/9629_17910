The base can't stand up for itself amidst the scrum for attention with all the adjuncts and in the end, it's just too wacky and bizarre to work.","kevanb","Sep 29, 2014"

While it's likely an ideal choice for those summer long weekends on the lakes of northern Michigan, I can't think of another scenario where I'd reach for this beer (especially not if there's other Short's offerings on the shelf). To reiterate: not bad, but certainly not this brewery's best.","biegaman","Dec 30, 2013"

The coriander aroma and flavor,while dominant do not overwhelm as some beers are apt to do. Front of the palate is wheat and then you get a burst of orange peel and coriander. Interestingly I get a bit of mild heat from the peppercorns in the aftermath. The mouthfeel is refreshing,but the heat at the end beckons further sips.

Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, peppercorn, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, and earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, wheat, peppercorn, coriander, bread, floral, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus zest, wheat, peppercorn, coriander, bread, and herbal earthiness on the finish; with some peppercorn heat building up as well. Nice and pleasant balance of malt and spice flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a solid spiced wheat ale. Solid robustness and good balance of malt and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. An enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

Interesting blend of spices on the nose: coriander, lemons, citrus, and a lot of pepper. The flavor follows suit with a good amount of lemon on the front end. As the beer develops the spices come through and dominate, especially the pepper flavor. A mix of citrus, clove, all spice flavors along with a mild bitterness. A mild malt bill of what seems to be wheat and toasted barley provide a decent background. Spices linger on the tongue. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a bit too much pepper for my liking as I feel it dominates the flavor and aroma. If that were toned down this could be a very drinkable beer.","hopfacebrew","Jan 30, 2012"

Feels similar to Oberon in the mouth and tastes much like it, more lemon kick in this beer though.

The spices are together a nice touch, but I think the peppercorns get to be a bit of overkill. The hops are nice, though, and lend a nice touch in the flavor as well. The spices are a bit excessive there, and I find the pepper to be distracting (not nearly as good as it was in the Anniversary Ale 2009).

Mild to moderate carbonation. The aroma is quite good, but not as potent as the top offering, with orange and pepper, pale malts, malt husk, coriander, and what smells like the Oberon yeast strain (Wyeast American Ale?). The mouthfeel is very smooth, with an invigorating peppery bite, which I absolutely love. The taste opens with a smooth pale malt backbone with a well balanced sweetness riding atop orange, coriander and pepper. I don't really pick up on the lemon zest. The finish is quenching and just makes you want to drink more. This is an amazingly sessionable beer. I could easily put six of these away. Highly recommended, but even more delicious on tap.","Mitchster","Aug 12, 2010"

The acidity of the citrus works nicely with the soft, bready wheat. I'm not crazy about the coriander though. Also a bit of pepper in the finish that doesn't help much. Very grapefruity (but not bitter) in the finish. Medium body with a sparkling feel. Not bad, but definitely not my favorite Short's brew.","alexgash","Aug 05, 2010"

Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of pepper, slight yeast, slight sweet malt, and hint of hops.

Exceedingly peppery, to be sure. The more I drank this, the more it reminded me of the crust I apply to a tuna dish I make -- bits of chili powder with pepper, cumin, and coriander. And then the citrus sauce gets laid down on the tuna -- here, in this beer, it's lemon. I couldn't put my finger on it originally, but I had some sort of strange lemon drink once that was excessively carbonated.
