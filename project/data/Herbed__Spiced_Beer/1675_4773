I had a really hard time picking out exactly what the spices in here were, but the whole is a really nice drink. I wish we could get four packs of this for what single bottles cost, that's my only complaint","StonedTrippin","Nov 28, 2014"

It has some sourness to it which I wasn't expecting, but it is balanced with sweet citrus. Strange aftertaste, kinda metalic, maybe the myrrh? Medium body with the perfect amount of carbonation imo.

Have been seeking to further my Baladin education and this one is the best for me so far. The complexities begin with the nose, honeyed sour sweet, excellent head on the pour, great glass lacing, the belgian yeast makes for a candied carbonation. the first sip discerns a taste profile that reminds me of Duvel, only deeper richer. The color and the glass lacing are the same but a more complex flavor profile; wasn't sure of the spice notes, thought ginger and per BA I guess I am right othe spices I cannot identify but find this beer extremely, extremely drinkable and balanced. Great finish makes me more than ready for the next sip. No discernable alchohol burn, the beer is so smooth. Would pair with a fish or chicken couscous, would be so yummy.

First impressions: the color is definitely a Saison. Orange-amber hue with the color of clover honey. Thin, pure white head with persistent retention- some lacing. The aroma is pungently bitter herbs and orange. This is certainly a good looking beer but something suprising is how little effervescence there is in this- it's very dry and the effect is somewhat flat on the tongue. Flavor throws a kind of a curve ball too. It was barnyardy, hay-like and with a strong perfume of myrrh.

It has some apples, ande incense, and ginger in the nose. This continues to develop into white wine, some spice like cinnamon, and sourness (lemon, soap?). The taste is so very individual and expressive, banana, clove, grass, ginger, rain, citrus zest, corriander/cilantro, flowers, honeysuckle, pepper, and crysanthimum.

It poured a cloudy orange with some tiny bits of what I would guess to be yeast and other debris. Nice fluffy white foamy head that subsides to a thin white ring arong the perimeter of the glass. The smell is quite sweet and certainly contains alot of spice and quite a bit of an apricot smell. The taste is much less powerful than the smell. The taste, like the smell, has some spice and some apricot to it, but much less concentrated than the smell. The mouth feel is very pleasant. I can't tell if it has no carbonation, or if it is carbonated but has tiny, tightly knit bubbles. Either way, it's quite easy to drink. Very pleasant.","SilentSabre","Feb 04, 2005"
4.77,19,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Vaguely hazy but it is basically clear, the liquid is a beautiful gold in hue with a slight coppery highlight. The head was an active, bubbly white foamy mass that rested gracefully on top of the beer. Head retention was fair; it quickly turned to a soapy island with naked pockets, thin collar. There was no subsequent lacing. On a whole the appearance is attractive. The nose is soft. The potency is moderate. In fact it seems a little fickle, at first anyway. The more I sniffed the more I noticed. Flowers. A greenhouse filled with flowers on a sunny day. Can a beer smell sunny? Nora does. Traces of fresh honey, light sweetness too. Peppery. Spicy, ginger it seems. Fruity, apricots and peaches I believe. Malt is cracker-like. Herbal. The nose is great; it is like Duvel mixed with a saison. If the smell were more forceful it would be perfection. Inviting. The palate is unique. I translated a blurb on Le Baladins website but that didnt quench my thirst on this beer. Regardless, I think this is a fantastic beverage. It is so light in body, so soft with its touch and yet some flavorful. There are tons going on with this beer yet my tastebuds dont get slaughtered, they get rewarded. This beer is amazingly complex. I can think of very few beers that have such a vast flavor and none taste like this one. The palate is dry and sweet and spicy and herbal and fruity. Details the dryness is cracker-like at times. However the overall dryness is like Brut Champagne. Nice. The sweetness is soft and playful, kisses of honey, very light caramel notes. Juicy. Fruits are in play. There is a citrus zip, apricots, peaches, and a smidgen of grapes. Spiciness seems to be, in part, derived from ginger. Peppery. Then it becomes herbal towards the back, before ending on a sweet note and the slightest bit of alcohol heat. On the whole the palate is very tasty. This beer is amazing; it is so delicate! It is beyond comparison. Medium in body, the carbonation is moderately high (but not lively enough, IMO, as this beer is just a little tacky) but the mouthfeel is very pleasant and ideal for the flavor profile. Is this beer drinkable? Yes, you ass! Havent you been reading my review? The delicate flavors could be matched with equally delicate foods like fish or waffles at brunch. Maybe even a very, very mild cheese and some rye crackers. Maybe the best pairing for this beer is a couple glasses so it can be shared with friends. I really like this beer; I wish I could drink it again (soon). But I havent seen it in my usual hangouts (not in Nebraska because we dont get shit here, I mean in Kansas City or Iowa City). I purchased this bottle in Burnsville, MN. Unforgettable. World Class.","bditty187","Dec 09, 2004"
3.98,-0.7,3.5,3,4.5,4.5,4,"Drinkability: This a smooth drink for special occasions, would pair well with any meal that is heavy in carbohydrates and salty. Its a little expensive versus the beer's quality.","GuinnessSmurf","Nov 19, 2004"
4,-0.2,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very mellow pale malt scent with spices and a fruity yeast finish. I heard from someone that it is supposed to have the aroma of an old cathedral. The taste is good as well. It has a nice pale malt flavor that boasts of spices. It goes down smooth and finishes a bit tart. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine spiced Belgian ale. It has it all: aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel; a good drinker.","WesWes","Sep 13, 2004"

4.2,4.7,4,4,4,5,4.5,"pours out a highly carbonated copperish colour, with a big foamy snow white head. lots of must and fruit aromas. ample head leaves lots of lace. initial estery flavours of ginger, honey, melon, apricot, and orange. all very subdued and intertwined. malt tilts toward the caramel spectrum, although very lightly. ghostly spicy...alcohol lends some pepper. there is a flowery aspect of this ale that i'm not sure comes from the light hopping or the fruity essence. the mouthfeel is astounding. with all the charged up carbonation, i was expecting a soda like fizzy mouthfeel, but i am pleased at the silky smooth, well rounded and succulent body of this ale. goes down exceptionally well. some warming in the belly is detected, also. finishes light and dry with a bit of musty fruit lingering in the aftertaste. this is a very nice quaffer and a sweet treat in summer. recommended!","budgood1","Aug 09, 2004"
3.35,-16.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Medium gold, almost orange with a pale tan, frothy and vigorous head. Candy, citrus and mild bread notes on the nose. Similar to a belgian pale ale, IMO. Sweet, spicy finish. Some ginger is noticable, along with some white peppercorns. Sugary throughout. Slightly yeasty finish. Good mouthfeel overall. Flavorful and coating, but not heavy. A nice brew. Not sure of the style they were going for; belgian pale ale meets a spice beer, i guess. Solid. Give it a try if you find it.","winomark","Aug 04, 2004"
4.05,1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours out a hazey orange amber with a large off-white head. Sweet is there very much, but in an unusual way. Almost Belgian in style, but with a twist. Spicey turns down the sweets with some citrus and pepper, and maybe ginger. Tastes very interesting. Mouthfeel is solid. Certainly worth checking out. A very good brew.","scottum","Aug 03, 2004"

4.42,10.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Nice presentation in a custom shaped and embossed 25.4 oz bottle with a nice label. It pours a slightly hazy golden-peach body topped by a full and frothy white head that holds quite well. The nose is perfumey, floral, mildly spicy (ginger) and lightly fruity (apricot) with a gentle touch of alcohol. Very clean. It's medium body combines with a fine carbonation to create a gently creamy mouthfeel. The flavor displays a strong floral character, gentle spice and light fruit over a softly sweet malt. It finishes dry with a light touch of malt and a delicate spiciness (ginger). A very clean and somewhat complex ale that's well done and quite enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Jan 18, 2003"
