In the case of the flavor, my criticism is that it seems more like a diluted gin than a gin-augmented beer. If I were to pretend that this was my own homebrew project, I'd be trying to find a way to amplify the flavor profile of the beer base by about 20% and the gin-barrel characteristics by about 10% for the next batch.","WastingFreetime","Aug 10, 2012"

3.01,-16.4,2.5,4,2.5,3,3,"I got a finger of rocky, off-white head with limited retention from the pour. Color was a very cloudy orangish-amber/yellow. Nose smelled like wintergreen, like a snowy forest with pine trees in abundance. I had a Battle of the Bulge vet in last year and he said that when the heavy artillery began toppling trees in the Ardennes Forest, the scent of pine put him off of Christmas trees for life. I had no such experience and love the scent of pine, but no love for celebrating Christmas, so no trees in my house. It was hard to discern between the wood of the barrels and the minty smell of juniper, but either way, I was beginning to champ at the bit to get some on my tongue. It was initially cool and minty with a medium presence on the tongue, which was enjoyable. The finish, however, gave off an intense dill flavor which one previous reviewer referred to as ""pickle-like"". I have to agree there, m'man. This was definitely NOT the sum of its parts. It was not an outright fail, but nor was it a repeater, if you catch my (snow) drift.","woodychandler","Oct 03, 2011"

The juniper berries and spruce add some subtle spice to the hop spice. I believe I get a sort of sour taste, but not something I'm put off by, that lingers a bit along with citrus. The aging in spruce gin barrels have made the pale ale less harsh in its hop spice, something that I'm obsessed with, but the John John Ale is extremely drinkable and an interesting beer to try. It looks and tastes more like a blonde to me, though, not that that's bad. I definitely enjoyed drinking this since it's SO DAMN HOT OUT IN TEXAS. I don't think this is great but it is very good.","BeardedRiker","Jan 04, 2011"

Alcohol in this beer is cleverly hidden. It's aged on spruce gin barrels but you can't seem to find it.

First, it has a great pale ale appearance, with a golden, yellow-orange color and a thick, foamy head. The aroma is a bit of a let down. I was expecting a strange combination of hops and herbs with all of the aromatic ingredients, but there just was not much there. The aroma was just grainy and a bit musty, with a hint of lemon. The flavor was certainly better, with a solid pale ale base of pine, earth, and lemon. The added botanicals seem to boost the pine characteristics, and the juniper adds a little something extra. Texturally, it is resinous and a bit boozy (from the barrel aging?), but also nicely carbonated and mouth-filling. Overall, it is a decent pale ale with a bit of intrigue, but the gin-barrel aging makes this one seem too boozy to want to go back for more.

And since I'm not an herbalist I really lack the critical vocabulary to describe it, except for that there is indeed a little bit of pine.

The herbal character is more complex than it is in the non barrel aged version of the beer, but the juniper seems relatively subdued with a ghostly woody character the only contribution that I can confidently trace to the barrel aging.

3.87,7.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"It is an easy beer to drink and not too strong. Something nice for a summer day but I was expecting more.","BigTomZ","Jun 09, 2010"
3.58,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D: All in all a drinkable beer that leaves you with a slight sour twang and coating on the tongue. Drinks like a saison, as crisp as a pale with a generous amount of hops to match, and has some berry spice appeal all rolled into one. Have to recheck my original evaluation of their juniper ale, but figure this one surely benefits from the spruce gin barrel aging which does this just fine. Worth a purchase.","beerthulhu","Jun 07, 2010"
3.11,-13.6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Parts of it I enjoy, but as a whole it doesn't seem to follow through for me, especially for the hefty price tag paid for it here in Alberta. Kudos to Rogue for the experiment, it makes sense to me, however the final product seems a bit one-dimensional. Refreshing, but one-dimensional.","IronDjinn","Jun 04, 2010"
3.53,-1.9,2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"John John Juniper rates as above average in mouthfeel and drinkability for me. I wouldn't drink multiples of this. It is drying, to its benefit, but too subtle and spicy and sweet for me to love it. It reminds me of the John John Dead Guy Ale in that respect - love the concept but I'm iffy on the execution.","Reaper16","Jun 01, 2010"
3.63,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D: A solid brew from Rogue. I wanted a little more barrel character as I love gin and juniper, but this is a solid pale ale with a hint of spirit.","Halcyondays","Jun 01, 2010"
3.88,7.8,4,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,"D: Good summer beer. Though I don't think I could do more than one bomber in a day. A very interesting brew, and a gin barrel beer I am glad I tried.","Beejay","Jun 01, 2010"
3.66,1.7,4,3,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability: Subtle and subdued, though pleasant enough for a pint. While not a leap forward it is certainly a step up from the unbearable inaugural beer from the John John set. But this gives me hope for the rest of the series. I'm ready for more. I feel ready!! What's next?","ChainGangGuy","May 31, 2010"
3.77,4.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"I'd be interested to see how much alcohol is in this, as this beer had both the taste and the warming effect that stronger beers and sprits have on me. I love it when the boundaries are pushed and even though this isn't spicy like a Pumpkin Ale, lovers of gin will be pleasantly surprised by what Rogue's pulled off here. There's certainly nothing else liket this on the market!","JerzDevl2000","May 31, 2010"
3.3,-8.3,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,4,"Overall, a lackluster and dissappointing brew. Doesn't deliver for a barrell aged beer. Nothing really stands out here either. Forgetable in my opinion.","Gosox8787","May 28, 2010"
4.3,19.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"- Overall I am very impressed.... wish it were a painted bottle. This is one to have and try.... extremely balanced flavor... and quite refreshing on a warm muggy day.","Docer","May 27, 2010"
3.21,-10.8,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Pale and golden, pretty typical pale ale look. The aroma and flavor is lacking big time. There is very little going on in this beer period There might be a slight hint of juniper/hop bitterness on the back palate. Drinkability depends on if you want to spend a lot of money on an essentially bland beer. Other than that, I can't smell much and I don't taste much. What a sad, overpriced, waste of time. It is pretty clean though.","brownbeer","Beers"
3.97,10.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This would be great with Thanksgiving dinner. I think I'll try to stow a few away...","andyfrancis","0"
3.81,5.8,3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The palate is dry and full of bitter and uniquely nuanced flavors. I don't know the abv. , but this is a session ale with conversation piece written all over it.","scruffwhor","May 25, 2010"
3.92,8.9,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"M/D - Thin body goes well with the light herbal flavor. Very easy to drink, not sure how much I paid, I think around 6. Overall nice beer that could be a good session beer though it sounds like a lot went into it and probably wouldn't scale well.","magnj","May 22, 2010"
3.82,6.1,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Picked this up from a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Hazy, yellow pour with nice big but quickly fading head and decent lacing. Disappointed that the nose was rather subdued. Bready, musty with just a hint of juniper. The flavor was also disappointing, or perhaps my expectations were a bit too high. I really loved the premise behind this beer and was hoping it would live up to the hype. The juniper is present, but barely, along with just a hint of gin. With that said it's an interesting and complex beer that gets better as your drinking it. Good balance, but over all I was expecting a much bolder taste. Good drinkability as it does grow on you. Although it was a bit disappointing, still a solid beer from a solid brewery.","beerdrifter","May 17, 2010"
3.28,-8.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"The body was about what you'd expect from a Pale Ale. Drinkability was nice but not special. Overall, a decent beer, worth a shot when you see it, just don't set your expectations too high.","beertunes","May 16, 2010"
3.03,-15.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,2,"drinkability- nice hopped beer but really a miss on the style over hopped and not gonna satisfy someone looking for juniper, falls short on that aspect of which i expected, enjoyable but off style","Stunner97","May 15, 2010"
3.65,1.4,3,3,4,3.5,4,"D: Somebody suggested this might pair well with rosemary, and the web site suggests either pork or a hot and spicy dish. The juniper and spices in the beer definitely make it a nice beer to pair up with the right dish. Despite the spices, it's somewhat smooth and refreshing.","chaz01","May 15, 2010"
2.14,-40.6,3,1.5,2.5,2,2,"D: Let me start by saying that I'm one of Rogue's biggest fans and I would gladly pay a few more $ for Rogue beer than most other beers because I feel that their beer is just better than most others. That being said...this beer is terrible, by far the worst beer that I've ever had from them. Maybe I got a bad bottle or something but I've never had a problem like that from Rogue before...everything has been very consistent in my opinion from them. This was $9 down the drain.","loren01","May 14, 2010"
3.68,2.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I was worried this beer would be over the top with the Juniper, but the opposite was true. It was too understated.","homebrewhawk","May 13, 2010"
3.75,4.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Flavor is, again...good...but nothing special. I was really hoping for more. Has a nice crisp and light mouthfeel. Initial flavor is a mixture of yeast, light berry, and again...a mild spice zest. Carbonation is high, which is right on for the style of beer. The warmer the beer gets, the more the flavor comes out...but overall, still slightly let down. I was really hoping for more of a booze flavor from the spruce gin barrels.","ShadesOfGray","May 12, 2010"
3.55,-1.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Not being a huge fan of gin, it was nice to see that the gin barrel didn't have an overpowering effect on the base pale ale. The result is an approachable herb-influenced beer, interesting in its conception, but overall, still a bit too much like consuming forest undergrowth for me to want another.","biboergosum","May 10, 2010"
3.85,6.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"D: Despite being a barrel aged beer, this one is very easy to drink at a steady pace. It's quite tasty, and well worth trying. A bit high-priced for what it is, however.","WYVYRN527","May 09, 2010"
3.76,4.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"This drinks pretty well. This isn't much more than a regular pale ale to me. The barrel aging isn't that noticeable and if I wasn't told, I would think this was a pale ale with some juniper berries added in. It's a good brew, but probably not worth the price tag.","jera1350","May 08, 2010"
3.47,-3.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, this isnt' bad. The gin isn't overwhelming, nor the spruce, but both give it a clean quality. Not my thing, but good nonetheless","Mebuzzard","May 05, 2010"
3.97,10.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"A decent stab at something different from Rogue. However, I can't get past the kink in the mouthfeel. Certainly worth a try either way.","Brad007","Apr 23, 2010"
3.81,5.8,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I'd describe this as a decent pale ale with a little added complexity. Warning to fellow gin lovers: the effect of the barrel aging is not huge, like you'd expect from most bourbon barrel aged beers, but you get plenty of the gin character if it's warm enough. Good beer for a change of pace and one would buy again.","GeezLynn","Beers"
4.24,17.8,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability is very good, but being fond of gin, I may be biased. I could see how this one might rub some people the wrong way. I was happy to find that the gin is more noticeable than the whiskey was with JJ Dead Guy.","Parrotbeak","0"
