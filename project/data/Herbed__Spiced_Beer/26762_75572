4.22,11.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Got this in a trade with icetrauma, thanks man. 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was bottled recently. Pours fairly clear extremely dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, chocolate, toffee, raisin, fig, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, brown sugar, dark bread, light roast, and light herbal. Excellent aromas with great complexity, strength, and balance of malt/spice notes; very inviting. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toffee, raisin, fig, toast, dark bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, brown sugar, light roast, and herbal. Light spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, dark fruit, toast, toffee, dark bread, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, light roast, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance, complexity, and robustness; with a great malt/spice balance; and minimal cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent winter warmer style! Great balance and robustness of flavors and spices; and extremely smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 31, 2013"
