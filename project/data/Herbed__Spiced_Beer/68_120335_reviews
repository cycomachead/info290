"Old bay did not add to this beer, but rather made the experience just a little off."
"Pours an amber color. Nice and spicy. A good beer to have after a seafood dinner on the beach."
""
""
""
"I personally was hoping for more Old Bay in the beer but I'm an outlier."
""
"The fresher beer the better it is."
"This one is legendary. If you love a beer with a kick, this one delivers Bruce Lee and some. Traditional Maryland Old Bay seasoning keeps this beer from being just another beer. Definitely recommend!"
""
"Overall:  This is a very interesting beer.  It totally tastes like the Old Bay seasoning mix and boiled crabs!  I bet it would go perfect with some crab cakes, a crab boil/bake, some peel and eat shrimp, shrimp and grits and grilled seafood."
""
""
""
""
"Was a very good beer. Very refreshing.  The old bay seasoning wasn't over powering. A light beer for the summer and one of the better ones I have had in a while"
"I consider this a novelty beer. Was curious as to what a beer would taste like with old bay spice. Would not buy again"

"The taste holds up to the sent. Tastes like a solid ale with a good amount of spice which obviously comes from the Old Bay. The Old Bay flavor is not nearly as intense as I thought it would be. And perhaps that is a good thing. On its own, it is a decent beer. When paired with seafood, it is on a different level. This is a beer that is definitely meant to be paired rather than consumed on its own. I would love to drink this beer on draft at an MD crab house feasting on some blue crabs where this beer would truly shine. Definitely worth a try and would have again with the right food pairing."

"Really good nose.  Not overpowering, but definitely reminiscent of a family crab feast.  Very clean taste, and a wonderful spicy finish.  I love this beer."

"It's interesting but I don't think I'll have it again.  I like my old bay on my blue crabs and not in my beer."

"What a unique beer.  If the thought of an Old Bay flavored beer sounds revolting to you, don't worry, I detected no salt and just a touch of celery seed.  The hops balance extremely well with the spices.  This beer has a flavor quite reminiscent of Old Bay while still being thoroughly drinkable (and at 5.6%, it's not *too* far from a session beer).  And, it benefits Maryland's blue crabs - a bonus to those of us in the area.  If you like spiced beers like witbiers and are willing to go a bit stronger with the spices, definitely give this one a try."

"It does go great with Blue Crabs!"

"O: It really went well with the seafood at dinner (which was prepared in a very simple manner) - a very nice combination of Old Bay spice and the hints of lemon. I found it surprisingly better than I expected."
""
""
"Hazy yellow gold color topped with a thin head that ultimately shrinks to a bubbly covering.  Smells spicy and festive â€“ not offensively so, pretty moderate Old Bay like aromas.  Flavor is also spiced, as expected, but there is an herbal, leafy hop presence, lemon, and a honey-like pale malt sweetness.  Dry, crisp, medium body.  Not bad.  Although the spice is fairly muted, it does begin to wear on the palate before the end of the glass."
"Great if you love Old Bay, I have actually added more old pay to the beer by covering my glass rim with old Bay!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Light body light carbonation. The pepper leaves a kind of course flavor on the back of my throat and top of my mouth. The lemon flavors leave a little dryness."
""
"It works!  Definitely tastes like old bay, and the super bready base beer complements well.  Has that deep breadiness of some good belgian pales or brewpub pilsners (if  that makes sense).  I like it."

"this is my frist  spice beer didnt even know it was a spice beer i taste pepper look good in a glass  just feels like my mouth is burning  for my frisr beer of this kind it looks so good in a glass but it may the last time i drink one of these beers"
""
"What more did you expect out of this one?"
""
""
""
""
"My initial pour created two fingers of rocky, bone-white head with excellent retention. Nose was redolent with Old Bay (r) and my mouth instantly began to water. Color was a pretty Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-plus quality clarity. I could see into the future! I could NOT keep my nose out of the glass with this one. This would be fabulous with actual crabs. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but if it is intended as a Summer Ale, I would not want it to be too full. The taste was of Old Bay (r), but in just the right amount, not overwhelming, which it could have been. How do you describe an ""Ale Brewed with Spices"" when the spices are so variegated? You almost have to have experienced Old Bay (r) seasoning for yourself at some point in order to understand. One point that really needs to be made is its finish. Just like any other beer that relies heavily on spice(s) for its flavor, this was as dry as the desert! This just begs to be drank with some food, especially seafood. Say, Salmon Sunday is tomorrow ..."

"O: A nice beer that is very refreshing during the Summer. I love Summer Ales so I may be partial to this review, but this beer is worth getting and is the best 'Crab-Spiced' beer I have had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"

"Just like Old Bay potato chips, only better!!. Seriously though, this is an interesting beer and something that I would expect from Flying Dog. The beer itself seems to be pretty good, hard to tell with the spice. On the good side, if you are an Old Bay fan, this is the best. The Old Bay flavor is just right and not too overpowering. Head and color are better than average and this beer would be awesome on a summer day, nice and cold, while sitting on the beach or pickin' crabs, lol"
""
""
"O: Very impressed by this beer. I love Old Bay, but I was still pretty skeptical about this because a lot of flavored beers end up cloying. This has a subtle and authentic twist added to what I suspect would be a pretty good pale lager without it."

"Got a six pack to try, as I like crabs and Old Bay seasoning. Sounded strange as a beer flavor, but this really works if you like Old Bay. Doesn't overpower the beer. Nice summer beer. Hope it is an annual brew! Fellow craft beer drinkers in the family agree."
"Overall this is a pretty decent herb spiced beer. Never thought old bay would work great in beer and this is pretty tasty stuff."
""
""
""
""

"o: Pretty much what one would expect knowing this was made with Old Bay seasoning. As such would go well with crab, shrimp, steak, etc."

"O- For the record, I'm not an old bay fanatic. I really like the seasoning but I'm not one of those fiends who thinks spice is great in any context. I was initially skeptical about the drinkability of this beer but I gotta say that Flying Dog has nailed it. This beer pairs well with tilapia that has also been seasoned with old bay. I would also really like to try some shrimp tossed in old bay or of course some crab and old bay to go with this. Outstanding."

"Mouthfeel features the spiciness on the tongue in an otherwise fairly light beer. I had this with snow crab legs and it was a perfect accompanyment. A good beer with sea food."

"T: Citrus grapefruit and lemon. Some salt and pepper notes combine with faint grass for dry and spicy finish. Some sweet notes of buttered corn that one would expect in a lo-country boil. Really nice summertime beer. Can be hard to really ""session"" this beer out as the spicing does start to overwhelm."
""
""
"O: Yeah, it's not good. Sour, in a bad way. I could finish, but only just."

"This is a really great beer. I wasn't expecting too much when I tried thus; but wow, what a surprise! This is a really great pale ale with a distinct ""old bay"" aroma and flavor without ovetpowering. Fantastic beeer for summerd in MD. Drinking with NMA. He just got here after a long drive and is delusional; hence the low numbers."
"Great summer pale beer with prominent old bay spice in the finish that stays on the tongue for a while. Very enjoyable! I can see myself drinking plenty of these throughout the summer. I gotta get my hands on some of these and take them back to Ohio!"

""
""
""

" The taste has very gentle malt presence and a subtle pepper taste w/ a mild lemony aspect and woody sweet element with the malt balanced by the old bay and hop flavors ..old bay spiciness is more noticeable in the finish with the lingering bitter lemony hop flavor. Overall I enjoyed this a lot, a very nice spice edition in a average strength pale -it achieves what it sets out to do"

"Dead Rise became famous around my work as the, ""beer with the crabby stuff"" in it. But after trying this one I realized it was no joke at all! Its rich, complex, and a layered wonderfully. The appearance of it is pretty standard with a deep gold color and a medium bodied head. When I took my first smell I was hit with the Old Bay seasoning right away. It was buttery and sweet with a good kick of Old Bay at the end. Nothing too overpowering which I was relieved by. I was also very surprised by how well it tasted! All the flavors blended together wonderfully and gave the beer a great layered experience. First, you get a sweet buttery flavor quickly followed by a smooth tone of Old Bay to season it off. Its really almost the full experience of eating Maryland blue crabs! I'm sure MD locals know what I'm talking about! I'm very pleasantly surprised with this one! I was afraid the Old Bay would be too strong and overpower the beer but it all worked out wonderfully."

"To me this tastes like Leffe Blonde if I had it at a crab feast. Like almost identical but a slight whiff of Old bay and a subtle burn remains on my tongue when it is gone. I know some folks hate this and others love it but it's very good for what it is. Crystal clear and great smell for what that's worth."
""
"Overall - It is what it is, a old bay flavored beer. Nothing complex or balanced, just a liquid version of old bay with minor hops and malts. Would be a great beer to drink with seafood. If flying dog is smart, they'd work out a exclusive contract with red lobster, joe's crab etc etc to feature this beer at these places."

"If you're a fan of Old Bay and all things Baltimore (Chesapeake Bay) then you have to give this a try. Note sure I would opt for a whole case unless I was having a crab boil. I think what is going to help this beer out a lot other than the local following is that it pairs with food really well. Outdoor BBQ - smoked ribs the other wkd served with this brew was a wonderful combo."

"Overall, I guess somebody had to use Old Bay in a beer this one is Dead Rise from Flying Dog and the bottle says it's licensed by McCormick to use Old Bay, and the proceeds benefit True Blue a group that supports the Maryland Blue Crab industry. Overall, not wowed and not feeling bad about trying this, it's just making me want to get some all you can eat crab legs."

"A very refreshing brew, light and lemony with a hint of salt. Well worth buying for summer yardwork."

"O: Frederick, MD. I grew up 18 miles away. I live in VA now but my roots there run deep. I had not heard of Dead Rise before my sister bought me a pack for my birthday. It was literally released a few weeks ago and my bottles were very fresh. An excellent ale would go great with a crab feast. The old bay taste is mild, but excellent. Might become my summer go to beer. I highly recommend. It's a winner."

"The beer is true to what it claims, and oh god I can't wait to eat this with fresh steamed crabs. They absolutely nailed the right amount of citrus and old bay character on this. It's a perfect seafood beer, and something like this could only be made in Maryland. Old Bay spice is something you either like it or you don't, and I am drooling over this. This brewery is going to easily sell a LOT of this beer, in fact I even saw people walking out with CASES of this stuff. Truly the perfect beer with crabs, and this also drinks well on it's own. If you want a spiced up blonde with dry salty action, look no further. But be warned it's not for everyone, but this makes me proud to be living in Maryland."
""
""
""
"I was very excited, although skeptical, to try this. But it works so well. If you love old Bay, you have to love this. Can't wait to try this with crabs."
"Basically skeptical that this was pure marketing hipster-fodder; the brew doesn't fuck around. Promises Old Bay and delivers better than ever expected. Surprisingly evident in smell and taste unlike the usual disappointments of 'one or the other', and 'neither'."
""
""
"Would I have it again? Probably not, but I'm glad I tried it."
"O- An interesting beer, not in your face with the old bay, but a cross between a summer ale and old bay. Mission accomplish for Flying Dog and an interesting beer, but nothing I would really seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not my favorite style (too farmhouse-y) but a decently executed beer. The theme is too gimmicky for me, though, even though I am a born and bred crab-loving Marylander. Old Bay is great on a lot of things, but doesn't belong on/in everything."
""
""
""
"O: It's a weird beer, to be sure. BUT, it perfectly encapsulates Maryland in a glass - like Natty Boh, it's practically law to have this one while eating crabs. Everyone who can get this one readily should at least try it once."
"O - BUY if you like summer and the eastern shore/shellfish!!"
""
""
"Very good beer. I saw it as a Natty Boh IPA, which is a very high compliment for a beer. It runs smooth with a swoosh of a nice slightly hoppy taste with a smooth slight taste of old bay that is perfect. The aftertaste furthers the experience as well. I hope it survives the summer seasonal phase, but pick it up while you can!"
""
"O - I enjoy this beer. I know tons of people that wont like this beer at all. It is a very Maryland/East Coast style taste. I hope Flying Dog releases this every summer as I could see it being a great beer for seafood and chicken dishes that I find myself enjoying over the summer months. Can't wait to have a crab feast with a six pack of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"p.s. For a little extra spice, I just added a bit of Old Bay to the end of my glass and gave it a big swirl. The Old Bay really sticks to the foam and stays at the top. However, it goes well with it and just amps up the already present flavors."
