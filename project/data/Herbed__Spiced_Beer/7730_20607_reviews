"Final Grade: 4.32, an excellent A grade. Underlig Jul is a bold-tasting, spicy winter warmer that is likely to raise at least one of your eyebrows upon the first sip. While it's not the sort of thing I'd want to drink in large volumes, or even very frequently, it is still a very creative, full-flavoured strong ale that makes for an excellent dessert beer or night-capper. Any fan of spiced beers or North American-style winter warmers should consider seeking this one out, because it's a fine example all-around."

"Overall this is a great winter beer.  I would drink it again.  You cant have two in a row before it becomes overwhelming imo."

"Overall- an interesting spiced beer, as mentioned above, it's reminiscent of a really toned down Jaegermeister, and as someone who enjoys that, I rather enjoyed this. It's definitely something that is enhanced by cool weather or a desire to drink something like it, but it's certainly good. Cost is a bit prohibitive, but definitely worth a try."

"I had a ginger rosemary beer that almost ruined the idea of putting ginger in beer and I'm glad to see in this a pronounced but balanced character, smooth complex spiciness and lots of interesting nuances and complex flavours. A bit more hops wouldn't hurt as would not gushing all over the place, but a delicious complex beer with decent balance I would try another batch of in the hopes this was a one-off problem. Otherwise my rating would easily have exceeded 4. Very tasty beer."

"This is one of the best holiday beers I've had. Poured slightly colder than their recommended 50 degrees F with a smallish tan, foamy, thick head that settled after a bit and good lace. Color is a very slightly hazy mahogany. Aroma is spicy - clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, others?, malt, toffee. Flavor's much like nose, tang is up front, followed by a mild bitter which was perfectly complimented by a softness of body. Fairly dry, and spices are not overdone. Body is perfect, ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, no off notes at all, and of average length. This is one of the most drinkable of spice beers. Glad it's in La Crosse!"
""
""
"Overall - Whoa, lots of odd tastes going on here. Kind of like a stout mixed with a Christmas brew. Not something I'd seek out again, but worth trying to see how different a beer can taste."
""

"Overall, definitely spicy. A good holiday beer. Well-rounded and balanced. Nicely done!"
""
"O - a solid tasty spicy treat with a fairly good balance of hops and big sticky malt, worth seeking out but maybe wait for the fall"
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a murky dirty brown color ale with a relatively large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of caramelized malt with notes of cinnamon and cardamom dominates with some light citrus hops notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by solid caramelized malt with some cinnamon and cardamom notes. Light toffee and chocolate notes can also be detected. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting use of the spice with good balance to keep the whole mix drinkable."
""
""
"Bottle pours a dark brown/blackish colour with good carbonation. Tastes of breaded malt with a slight chocolate roast flavour in there, and some hops and spices to come through in the finish. Drinks down very smooth for the 6.5%. An interesting spice beer. Not to bad for a cold winters night."
"O: Unique and I like it. Not rocking my world, but it goes well with spiced carrot cake. I love the bottle, appreciate that its from Norway, and am enjoying it on a cold stormy winter night."
""
""
"O - A tasty winter warmer that brings a load of spices but whose flavour profile that isn't overwhelmed by that same spice. Surprisingly drinkable and I quite enjoyed this brew. Well balanced and well worth seeking out!"
"Overall: a great easy-drinking winter brew with interesting complex flavours, but a bit more malt complexity would be nice"
"Just what this BA needs to end a night. Nøgne Ø does a body good, and Underlig Jul is just another feather in the cap."
"Dark brown, deep red hues at the edges. Tan head, good retention and spotty lacing. Nose is heavy on the ginger and clove, almost minty or ""winterfresh," huge spicing all around. Some sweet bready character in the distance. Taste has the hops upfront, bitter pine, ginger and herbal character. Also some roast, toasted malt and chocolate. Medium body, with some bitterness and a slight drying sensation. Not sure about this as a winter warmer, but this is fairly unique."
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good. I am not a huge fan of strongly-spiced beers in this vein, but this is a pretty good rendition of it."
"(4.5) D: A lighter variation of a winter style and a welcome one at that. Excellent spice mixture coupled with orange and some roasted malt make this very easy to drink. This would be a nice gateway choice into the winter style for anyone not familiar with the style."
"Reddish brown colour, one finger of tan head, some lace here as well. Nose is quite rich and spicy here, cinnamon and nutmeg, ginger and a big helping of piney hops, bit of dark fruit/fruit cake and malt as well. Taste is equally as spicy as the nose followed by pine and earthy hop flavours, mild-medium bitterness, ginger and cinnamon into the finish as well as some rich fruit and a faint bit of alcohol. Lightly carbonated, lots of drying leafy hop feel as well. Quite a delicious and very drinkable winter warmer, one of the better ones I have had this year, would certainly revisit."
"Interesting Christmas brew, well worth trying. God Jul everyone!"
""
"Drinkability: Good stuff. I do not think it is as good as Nøgne Ø’s Winter Ale, but it is very tasty and festive."
"This poured out as a deep reddish brown color with a nice looking cream colored head on top. The retention and lacing where pretty strong on this beer. The smell of the spice comes out big on the nose. Plenty of cardamom and cinnamon aroma fill the nose on this. There is plenty of spice in the flavor of this one as well. The malt adds very little sweetness to the beer, it's herbal and dry in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thinner side, I would have liked it to be a bit heavier to really add some depth. Overall it's a decent Winter brew but nothing spectacular."
"Really a nice Christmas taste, I might pick another one up. I would love to try a cake made with this!"
""
""
"O-Plenty of complexity to keep your palate interested while drinking a bomber. A fun and complex beer. My first beer from Nogne. I like it. Got a deal on this one, but I might have to come back and give more of their beers a go."
""
""
""
""
"An amazing richness and complexity to this beer offering. Definitely fits the winter festival ale model. Although drinking this one on a relatively warm early March Sunday, it still is a joy to drink. Definitely one for people looking for an immense winter holiday brew..."
""
""
"O- This beer has a big spice flavor with the cardamom and dry spice flavor growing too strong as the beer opens up. It gets hard to drink and the malt and hop flavors get lost making this beer a bit more odd with each sip."
""
""
"Overall: ‘Peculiar Christmas’ in English, although not that peculiar. Quite typical, really, but certainly a tasty one. Very nice and warm spices. My immediate reaction was that I’d like some gingerbread with this, although the beer is in fact a bit of a Christmas pudding itself! I would like to get a better impression of the ‘beery’ characteristis, especially the combination of malts. The spices are a bit overwhelming, and you might even think that you’re drinking a cup of strong chai instead of a beer. Nøgne Ø does some very good beers, so there shouldn’t be a need to hide behind all these spices. Still, this is what you want on a cold winter night, it really does warm you up nicely. They say that the beer is inspired by ‘gløgg’, i.e. mulled wine, which is a popular beverage in Finland too around this time of year (we call it ‘glögi’). The recommended serving temperature of the beer is 10°C/50°F, but on their website they hint that you might try it warmer — I take it that this is to suggest actually heating it up, like you would with mulled wine. Well, I didn’t try this, but I imagine that this could be interesting."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with copper highlights. There is little more than a finger of light tan head resting on top. The head has good retention, and it leaves a nice bit of lace behind on the glass. The nose has some roasted malt and quite a bit of spice. There are some floral notes, as well as maybe a little bit of chocolate. Spices are definitely dominate the nose though. It is very Chirstmasy. The taste follows the nose. It starts out with some roasted maltiness and a big amount of christmas spices. There is ginger, clove, lemon zest, and some others that I can't quite pick out. The little bit of chocolate that was in the nose comes into the taste, and there is some brown sugar flavor as well. The finish leaves some lingering spices behind on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a nice feel to it. It is smooth and creamy, but there is also a little bit of a tingly feel. There is a bit of roasted maltiness as well. This has good drinkability. It is definitely a holiday ale. It hits the spot this time of year and it goes down easy. Overall, I thought it was a nice beer, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I recommend trying it out, I would drink it again."
"Really positive experience!"
"Poured very dark brown into a snifter. Light tan head left minimal lacing down to the last sip. Aroma is an explosion of ginger. The sweet maltiness balances the spice of the ginger. This is followed by hints of coriander and cinnamon. There is an aftertaste of roasted malt and slight hop bitterness. This is the second beer I've had from this brewery and I am not disappointed for sure."
"definatly a solid christmas beer, like christmas in the bottle. im glad my friend surprised me with it. ill definatly revisit this in the bottle."
""
"O: They overdid the X-mas-part; too much spices dominated over malt and hops."
"Overall a different and tasty Christmas beer. Very recommended and tasty."
"According to the bottle this beer was inspired by Glogg, a traditionally Scandinavian spiced wine drank in the winter. As not only an avid glogg snob, but also as a maker of it, I can detect the influence, especially in the scent. Now as there are many different types of Glogg, this is a particular spicy version. I really enjoyed this beer and am fortunate to have been able to enjoy one, and enjoy it I did on this fine Christmas day. If you even get a chance to try one, I would recommend it."
"Has an interesting root/ginger beer quality that occasionally emerges. Enjoyed this one more than I had expected; great mix of spices that balance well with the malt/hops. Would definitely have it again."
""
""
"O: It really feels like a Christmas / Winter beer. Something to warm you on a late fall afternoon like today."
"Very spicy Christmas Ale. You can almost taste powdered cinnamon in there. This is what you expect from a Christmas Ale, in my opinion: Ginger Bread House beer. Tingly on the tongue. Probably your prototype XMas ale."
""
"Flavours are a bit of a surprise, I was expecting sweeter. Instead there's some roasted malt and a lot of herbal bitterness. The spices aren't as prominent as in the aroma but there's still some ginger and cinnamon present. Body seems light on, could be higher."
"O - Its definately different. Perculiar is the best word which is the title for the english version."
"O: Good but not something I could drink much of. Maybe once a season. However, not sure I'd be buying again if I see on the shelf."
"Thanks, mrmiles, for the opportunity"
"An interesting brew to say the least, but not one I'd purchase again."
"O: They abused their access to spice. Tastes like mulled wine, which has been mulled again. Way too much spice. dissapointing."
"Pours a dark brown color. 5/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong spice (ginger), sweet malt, slight oatmeal, hint of hop, and slight roasted malt. Fits the style of a Herbed / Spiced Beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, slight sweet malt, strong ginger, dry hop, spice, citrus hops, and a hint of yeast. Overall, the best ginger spiced beer I've ever had. Great appearance, good aroma, body, blend, and complexity."
"D: was not an easy drinker due to how potent the herbal character was but was a decent herbal spice brew."
"Overall this tastes like a cocktail more than a beer. I appreciate the different qualities, but don't feel I need to drink again."
"Full bodied with lots of creamy, luscious chocolate malt flavor. Only slightly roasted with lots of spice and earthy bitterness up front. Hints of peppermint, ginger, coriander and clove as well as a prominent dark fruit flavor that balances things out. I'm picking up grape, dark cherry, raisin, plum and fig. Very well balanced and easy to drink with again, no cloying medicinal cough syrup presence. Very good."
"Dark brown pour with a finger of creamy head that laced well and had good retention. Minty, herbal and gingery nose, with a gingerbread background. Really floral, spicy taste, with juniper coming through strong. I'm trying to nail the spice flavours - cinamon, ginger, cloves... All this is grounded by a sweet biscuit base and subtle notes of molasses and cherry. Its perhaps the most balanced and well-judged spiced beer I've had. Medium-smooth body works perfectly and helps this go down well."
"A singular expression of the brewer's art, but also an oddity that I doubt I'll revisit."
"D: Solid. Wasn't cheap (I think I paid nearly $10 for this bottle), but I'm glad I bought it once."
"Notes: Hmmm, another of my early and long sought after tries of Nøgne, and sure enough... It may not be astonishing but it is pretty good quality again. I´m sure eager to keep on looking out to test their brews."
"As many others have written before me, this is a great cold weather beer. It's a bit on the heavy side, as a winter warmer should be...yes I know that BA has decided to classify this as an herbed/spiced beer...and although not that high on ABV, the alcohol makes as good a showing as it can."
"Drinkability is interesting on this one. I thoroughly enjoyed drinking this unique specimen, but it's complexity and barrage of Christmas flavors may make this one to sip and savor one or two at a time. I don't consider that a knock against Underlig Jul, however. Seek this out and give it a try if you are a Christmas beer aficionado. As far as the spiced holiday beer category goes, I have a hard time seeing how you can make too many improvements on this."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer because of it's uniqueness and it's enjoyable on a nice cold winter day. Definitely not a beer to have more than one of or that I really ever need to have again, but I am glad I tried it."
"Dark, rich color. Brownish Ruby red color. Low head. Rediculously rich packed aroma, very spicy. Cinnimon, cardomom, and clove very evident. A definite Christmas aroma. Decent lacing on glass. Big carbonation. A complex drink. Expected a heavier, huger spiciness in drink from hints in aroma, but actually extremely balanced. Some maltiness. Spiciness comes in at start, quickly followed by a well combined hop flavor, quite impressive how well the hops blend with the spice of the drink. Floral and slightly citrisy, followed by quick dry finish. Concluded with fruity hopness, nice level of dryness. Relatively light and drinkable for a Christmas beer. One of my favorite christmas beers, and well worth the price. Nogne continues to not let me down."
"Terrific beer, yet another gem from Nogne. This is one that will undoubtedly remain on my fall and winter radar in the future."
"Drinkability - I am going sip by sip, wondering if a drain pour is imminent. Perhaps I will try a bottle this winter when I am certain to get a fresher bottle...unless this is this year's bottle in which case my scores are warranted. Reading some other reviews, I see a number of others mentioning the astringent flavor, I guess that's the 'peculiar' angle? At any rate, not for me, more for you. This did get better as it went, either me and my taste buds making the most of the situation, or some of the other flavors balancing better. Despite, not one I'd seek out again."
"D: An exceptionally drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Well composed, extremely long aftertaste, overall pretty awesome -- no compromise all right!"
"Pours a three-finger cream head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Deep brown color, ton of yeast left in bottom of bottle. Nose is spicy and piney. Flavor is spicy and medicinal with a bitter dry finish. Spices overwhelm, not for me. Pricey at $9.95 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"This reminds me a great deal of my beloved Anchor Our Special Ale. Prominent flavor was darkly toasted gingerbread cookie. Sweetness was well balanced. Lacked the spruce notes often integrated in OSA, but there were some spice notes lurking in the background that I could not quite put my finger on. Overall, a pleasant winter specialty beer."
"Sort of a disappointment really... I'm writing this off to an old bottle and will revisit this one if I can find it fresh..."
"D: Good, highly spiced, yet tasty."
"D - Not for me."
"This is a difficult category to judge. This beer is obviously not designed to be consumed in great quantities. In fact, the spicing seems to suggest that this ""peculiar ale"" is designed to confront the drinker. As such, my points here are awarded for the skilful blending of the spices which, while I don't entirely agree with some choices, is well done and does its job."
"Actually quite drinkable, in spite of the heavy spicy hand, but a bit more ginger than I care for. I doubt there is any peppermint in this one but it sure makes you think so. Interesting.."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours brown with a few yeast floaties noticable, along with about an inch and a half frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is strong, I immediately smell ginger along with some cinnamon, citrusy and pine hops, and coriander. For me the spices really stand out in the aroma. The taste is very similar to the aroma. Ginger is the strongest taste, and then there's some citrusy (orange and grapefruit) and pine hops, cloves, cinnamon and a little bit of chocolate. As with the aroma, I think the spicy taste overpowers the other flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy and enjoyable to drink. If you don't like ginger and/or spicy beers, then this beer probably isn't for you. But I do like ginger and spicy beers, so I liked this brew a lot. I'll have to pick some more up next year if it gets brewed again."
"Feel and Drinkability: Body is much lighter than I expected it to be, very easy to drink. Finish is dry. Carbonation is very low leading to the impression of a heavier body, but in all reality this body is fairly light....I might say that its inbetween medium and light. Ginger really does a good job of drying things out...almost gives it an oakish quality. Ginger is the big player here, fresh ginger, not silly dried spice...this beer has a lot of ""oily fresh and crunchy"" ginger. This is one that I'm definitely enjoying and its giving me inspiration to create a ""ginger ale."" Pick it up if you can, its worth the money."
"Pours a very nice clean/clear dark golden brown color, nice carbonation, very nice thick/creamy two-finger off-white head, with lots of thick/creamy sticky lacing to follow. The nose is very nice malty, slight chocolate/toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg. The taste is sweet, malty, with some very nice cinnamon/nutmeg, and some chocolate/toffee. Medium body. Drinkable, very tasty, never had a medioca brew from this brewery to date."
"Inspired by Gløgg, Peculiar Yule has a medium-body and a dark, complex flavor that, to a certain degree, masks the presence of the hop varieties. Pine, cocoa, and the aforementioned spices are the predominant flavors here. Different but drinkable, this malty brew also has a fairly long, rather sweet finish. A must for fans of spiced beer."
"Overall drinkability is nice - terrific holiday ale to be enjoyed slowly."
"Drinkability is good here but this is one strange brew. Not for everyone."
"A beer for sipping by the fire when it's sub-zero (F) and the wind is haunting outside."
"Pours a chocolate brown color with some noticable yeast floaties. The head is dense and creamy, settles into a solid ring. The aroma is a spice bomb. Some nice spruce and ginger that mellows with some clove spice. There seems to be a hidden milk chocolate character that mixes well with the spice. The base flavor seems to be a traditional english porter as it has some caramel/butter malt characteristics. The spice is not as heavy as it is in the aroma. Definitely some candied ginger, light sprucy juniper and cardamom. The feel is moderate to chewy, fairly soft carbonation which I expected for the style. Has a nice holiday spicy finish. A very good sprucy/spiced ale. The brew has a nice woodsy spice that I like in a holiday beer. Very enjoyable and recommended."
"The beer is well formulated and well brewed but if you think that the downfall of Chrismas Ales are the over use of spices then this will definately be too much. Enjoy!"
"The taste was overpowered with ginger. After the first sip, it was ginger all the time. There are other interesting spices, such as coriander, cloves, cinnamon, and lots of different hops, but the ginger was just too much and didn't blend in well with whatever else the brewer was trying to concoct. I wasn't sold on this beer and I was more than happy to share my 22 ml bottle with someone else."
"Pours a rich looking dark orange-brown, with a ton of sediment. The nose is fantastic, with all the spices listed as ingredients present: coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, and a clear note of ginger. The taste pushes the spices behind roasted bitter chocolate and hops and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, lighter than you'd expect. Still, it is quite particular, and I don't know if I'd be in the mood for more than one all that often. One of the better holiday brews I've had."
"Very interesting beer, as is par for the course from this very cool brewery. This one is billed as being brewed so as to recall Scandanavian Glogg, a mulled beverage. I have to say they did a pretty good job. This looks a little murky, brown with a good bit of yeast swirling around and a fairly short head that fades to a thin ring. Smells fruity and vinous, slightly spicy with lots of ginger and cloves, and has fairly strong pine smell- but more like juniper than hops- almost medicinal, but pleasant. The taste has more of the juniper and herbal deep bitterness running like a backbone through the whole beer, overlayed with piney and earthy hops, more ginger, clove, and other spices, and a fruity, slightly sweet vinous quality. All in all, sort of like Glogg, if perhaps a bit more (welcome) bitterness than usual. Almost tannic in its mouthfeel, and on the thinner side. A very different holiday beer, and much appreciated in my house."
"Between the ample hopping, the layers of malt and a studded cast of spices, this beer drinks something akin to a jazz improvisation. With every sip a different note, a different tempo, a different instrument comes forth, all the while the whole trio stays in the same key, and in unison. It was a fantastic jam and well worth the price of admission."
"Decent taste. Spicy, just like I thought due to the aroma. More cinnamon and clove. Very distant chocolate. Let it warm up past fridge temp. Lacing gets better as it warms. Slight bitterness on the aftertaste."
"Tastes like a pine sap and allspice sandwich. Has a lingering, unpleasant astringent aftertaste. Has plenty of bittersweet chocolate, ginger spiciness and cinnamon. Too spice-laden and piney for me. Never thought I would come across a Nogne O beer I didnt like, but this one does not do it for me.."
"D - The drinkability of this beer as a Christmas special almost cannot be beat, hands down the better of the two Nogne O Christmas offerings, and one of the best around"
"D-very different from the run of the mill spiced Christmas beer. Cardamon is one of those spices you either like or hate. I like it so I enjoyed this beer. Fun, complex, great mix of flavors."
"Bottle Pours a deep amber brown with a good light tan head. The head is creamy and lasting. Has a good aroma of spices, it reminds me of a ginger snap cookie. Has a decent carbonation. A good mouthfeel. The flavor is very good. Hearty cloves, cinnamon. and a good kick at the end. Has a watery texture. A solid finish with an enjoyable aftertaste. I had this one out of season but will look to stock up next holiday season."
"Drinkability= Meh. It's alright. Taste is average. Smell is a little above average. Mouthfeel is european if that makes sense. Beer overall is average. Not good, but not bad. Good to try, wouldn't buy it again though."
"Without question, Nogne is one of my favorite (non-Belgian) European breweries. With the possible exception of India Pale Ale, everything they touch turns to beer gold. The bottom line is that Peculiar Yule (Underlig Jul) is one of the best Christmas-themed spiced ales to have ever entered my glass. God Jul!"
"While the Underlig is listed on their site as being 6.5% abv (this one is shown at 6.3%), the brewer still states that they are the same beer (rated separately here on BA)."
"D: This is only for once in a while. Very good, but extreme. Not for the uninitiated."
"Drinkability - while one bottle of this beer is quite enjoyable, more than one has the potential of getting tiresome due to the heavy handed spicing."
"Cheers and please pass the spiced chocolate."
"D: Very good drinkability and one of the best by style. The perfect balance of malt and spices, balance and abv makes this a dream going down and one that should not be missed."
"The spices, maltiness and hop touch combine well here. A nice seasonal, spiced, yet balanced, brew!"
"Solid, very aromatic, spicey, xmasy brew."
"Pours chocoolate brown wit a nice tan head that dissipates slowly, leaving good arching lace. Very spicey aroma with clove, cinnamon, maybe bay leaf?, and I don't know what else - Reminiscent of beef stew. Good malty IF with long live bitter aftertaste. Some of the spices are there, but it is not as overpowering as you might expect from the aroma. A litte chocolate and maybe anise show up as the beer warms. Medium bodied with relatively high carbonation that bites your tongue a ilttle. This is a nice complex beer that is great for winter. The nose is intensely spiced, but the flavor is surprisingly well balanced. Complex but not overwhelming. Try it with a good cheese fondue."
"This beer gets kudos for its unique and bold use spice. Not a beer for everyday, but it works around yule time."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a kick ass ginger nose along with moderate contributions of cinnamon and clove. The taste is awesome. It has a solid malt base that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It's light going down with loads of ginger and hops in the finish. It's quite refreshing actually. The ginger really stands out. The cinnamon and clove just round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific beer with tons of flavor. I love the hop/spice combo. They seem to play off one another."
"Pours a dark cola and ruby colored hue beneath an awesome tan, two-finger head. Great retention and stickage. Lots of lacing!!! Great looking beer. Holy cardoman! Very herbal, spicey aroma. Makes me think of an old fashioned European Chistmas cookie. A little too spicey though. The taste is equally as spicey, the cinnamon and ginger i noticeable, but the cardoman takes hold of both the nose and tongue. Some of chocolate malt adds some roast character. The hops only increase the spices potency. Herbal spicey palate wrapped in a medium body."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a dark garnet color with LOTS of visible rising carbonation. The head was a billowing monster of tan foam. All three fingers retained easily as a rocky cap that slowly left lacing all down my glass. The aroma was roasted malt, lots of spices (nutmeg, cloves and white pepper in particular) and some ripened fruit. The flavors were semi-sweet at first, caramel malt and hints of toffee punctuated by the holiday spices but then the taste got weird. The swing was at once very bitter and woody/root-like, as though the hops went bad and the malt too earthy. Rough way to finish. The mouthfeel was good but slightly watery, the body medium/full and the carbonation very nice. A peculiar yule beer indeed..."
"Mostly known for Vikings and Sea Monsters, Norway is reinventing it's image, one tasty brew at a time."
"An appropriately-flavored beer for wintertime. Not a style I especially love, but good for once-a-year consumption."
"My favorite bottled beer of this holiday season. Pours a solid dark brown with velvet around the edges. Fantastic tan head that left a nice lace down to the bottom of the glass. The aroma was like a Holiday gift basket, cookies, fruit cake, cinnamon and rum cake come to mind. The first sip was like biting the head off a gingerbread man which lasted through to the aftertaste. What could be more festive than that? As it warmed and the glass got lower I found the other spices and toasty malt. I appreciate what this beer offers. After a year of delicious Imperial Stouts, over the top IIIPA's and great sours that push the envelope, this beer definitely keeps up. I guess I'm a spice head. Just like eating a gift basket though, one was enough."
"Possibly the spiciest winter warmer I've had this year (which is impressive, considering the Stone-Jolly Pumpkin-Nøgne Ø beer I sampled last weekend). Though the ginger and coriander are the loudest voices here, the dark malts and citric hops harmonize with them nicely. It's a rather pricy bottle, but any fan of spiced beers shouldn't hesitate to pony up the cash for this one."
"nice darkidh brown with a coffee w/cream colored head. good lace, nice retention. nose is fantastic. toasty graham cracker, cinnamon, chocolate, caramel, coffee, crystalized ginger and more. tastes almost well balanced, but the finish seems a touch too hoppy for what i think they are going for. still an outstanding beer, but my least fav so far from this brewery. more than worth a shot if you can tolerate the obscene price tag attached in the u.s. i think that the $ get in the way of most peoples enjoyment of the wonderful beer from these guys. thanks nonge"
"D: At 6.3% ABV, this is a delightfully drinkable holiday beer, with eggnog spices, but far better for your health. This is one of the most flavorful lower alcohol beers that I have ever tasted, perfect for holiday session drinking."
"Bottle labeled Peculiar Yule. The aroma is complex with toasted malt, spice, pine hops, soap, and brown sugar. The appearance is brown with a big head. The flavor is like the aroma but not very impressive. The palate is smooth. Overall its a little disappointing."
"Poured a black with a deep brown head. Nose was cocoa, ginger, clove and some cinnamon. Taste was roasted and chocolate malts with clove,ginger, cinnamon. Mouthfeel was creamy, pretty heavy bombied and the spiciness at the end was nice. Overall a a pretty good brew just did not fit me well."
"overall very strange, yet in a good way."
"May be best described as a brown ginger ale. If copious ginger and coriander sounds appetizing, here you go. A spiced holiday ale, but this would probably be incredible paired with Indian/Thai cuisine or sushi."
"D: After being dissapointed with the Nogne Pale and Imperial Stout, the Dark Horizon and this beer right here have changed my mind about this Norse brewery. A very good Winter Warmer, although the $9 price tag will limit my purchase of this wonderful winter ale."
"As for drinkability, this falls into the one and done category that is best shared amongst guests who are already drinking spiced eggnog."
"D- Peculiar Yule is a pretty solid brew that is a perfect holiday brew to enjoy with all the holiday fixings. Recommended!"
"D: I really like interesting winter/holiday beers and this was no exception. Really nice combination of chocolate, fruit, spice, and toasted malt flavors."
"50cL bottle of the American release 'Peculiar Yule' with Chinook hops. Pours a nearly opaque dark red with a huge tan head. Smells strongly of spices, particularly ginger and cinnamon. Chocolaty malt comes through in the flavor, followed by strong bitterness and spices. Quite dry. Overall, a very interesting beer."
"There is a fair amount of sweetness so I can't drink too much of this one in one sitting, but I'd like to because it is quite enjoyable. I'll definitely look for this one next year and recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting Christmas beer."
"Spuyten & Duvell. Dark brown with nice head, lace. Yeasty, spicey, quite drinkable. Describe as a Norway biere de Garde. Pleasant citrus from C-hops, and a well blended melange of spices, chocolate malt. CInammon, mint, a bit of ginger, allspice. I like this brewery."
"Pours a wierd dark color, something like reddish black, with some decent lacing and head. Literally smells like Christmas, every lovely scent you can think of... forestral aromas of juniper or spruce or whatever you want to call it, spices like clove and nutmeg, its a virtual cornucopia of old world yule. The taste rings similarly... its like taking a bit out of your Christmas tree, eating a ginger snap cookie, throwing a can of nutmeg around, and taking a bite out of a malted barley pie. Or something like that. Didn't have much of this, wished I could've had a lot more to investigate, but what I know is its a very different beer, quite interesting, something I'd have again for sure. But still confused."
"Pours dark brown with almost no tan head. Nose is super spiced. Almost like a cinnamon, clove, and minor tar thing. The flavor is much smoother than the nose was leading me to believe. Spices are there yes, but in no way overpowering. Smooth feel on liquid and carbonation. Easy to drink as it is rather smooth. But the spices do make it more of a sipper than a drinker."
"This is a very unusual christmasbeer indeed. There are so many different spices and other ingredients that are somewhat hard to identify. I really liked this one even though it is quite different. This should do fine along with the christmasfood!"
"Different. Very much Christmas. And boy did I enjoyed it!"
"Drinkability: While I enjoyed it, I don't know how many I could enjoy."
"(Bottle conditioned, 500 ml). Another new Yule/Christmas beer from the craft brewers of Nøgne Ø. Very dark brown to ruby colour, decent head. Nice aroma of dark malts, caramel and spices (cardamom and cloves). Unashamedly sweet with a velvety mouthfeel, but not cloying. Rich and malty flavour with caramel, distinct cardamom and cloves (also some ginger and nutmeg??). Sufficient hops and spices in the aftertaste. Very good beer! Im sure its nice enough with cookies, but definitely a treat on its own!"
