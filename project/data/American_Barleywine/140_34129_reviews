"Starts out nice including the flavor, but it is boozy.  Way too boozy."
""
"Caged and corked poured into tulip glass. Strong whiskey aroma and boozy flavor - a bit too much."

"sooo good...smooth, smell is of candied rum. noticeable alcohol, but content is high...however, not at all overwhelming. taste is sweet dark fruit and caramelized malt."
"I cracked this open tonight to see if I’d want to get another bottle to age while they are still available in my area, but at the price point of $20-22 per bomber I’m not sure I will get another one. Overall it was a good beer, but I was hoping for a great beer. Worth a shot, especially if you like heavy booze in your barleywine."
""
"First time I have tried this. A 10oz glass at SN taproom. Bigfoot hops r still  there but subdued. Whiskey barrel taste complements the Bigfoot flavor perfectly. Everything is in balance. Mod malty nose with whisky barrel aroma nicely in step. Mine is a bit cold now. Hides its alch very well. Very enjoyable. Went perfectly with dinner."
""
"D: This was a solid brew that smelled amazing, like coconut cream pie. The taste was more like standard Bigfoot with a bourbon barrel twist. The body was solid, but the finish was hot, so it must be sipped. I can only imagine this improving with age. A shame I only have this one. Still a very enjoyable drink fresh."
""
""
""
"This is an excellent brew, with the barrel incorporated carefully to add to, vice subtract from, Bigfoot's regular character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinks alright, was expecting much more, perhaps tied to the carbonation?  Got better as it warmed"
"Was disappointed, 2015 bottle, bought 2 at WF, one to drink now one to cellar, first bottle really left something to be desired. For the price paid would have been better off with other options."
""
""
""
""
"Best beer i've had this year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Almost Garnet Port tinted amber with pecan cream head and a lace blanket.Rich Aroma of plums mixed with butterscotch, caramel, vanilla and booze.First taste is surprise grapefruit followed by rich toffee and finish with dark fruity wine. Mouthfeel is buoyant, silky smooth.This is one of the best beers I have ever tasted."
""
""
"Very smooth.. Awesome mouth feel on this beer! And it's fresh not aged, it's a 2015, it would like velvet in my mouth after a couple of years in the cellar!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Great example of a BA American barleywine, much better than fresh Bigfoot, but if you're not into bourban aged beers this isn't for you"
""
""
""
""
"O - Glad I had the patience to let it age a whole extra month after purchase. Ha! This must be similar to what an aged regular bigfoot is like, with some added bourbon /wood notes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious but still a little young. You can smell the bourbon along with notes of coconut and slight vanilla. The taste is smooth without much burn. Primary taste is coconut followed by vanilla and a little dark fruit. Great version of a great beer, can't wait till next year when I open my second."
""
""
"I passed on this one the first time I came across it, but didn't pass on it this time. Glad I didn't, as it's really good, but I think I prefer the standard Bigfoot Barleywine (fresh). I'm simply not a fan of bourbon-barrel-aged American Barleywines. Even if the hops don't completely overwhelm any barrel notes one might achieve, the flavors simply don't complement each other very well. I think English Barleywines, with their characteristic caramel sweetness, are much better candidates for bourbon-barrel-aging. This beer doesn't taste all that different than the two-year-old Bigfoot bottles I have in my cellar. Really good, but not quite as good as fresh and not nearly as good as I hope it will be in several more years. Still, there is obvious quality and complexity here and I can definitely taste it. I may buy another bottle of this in couple of years, just to see if I like it better after my palate has developed a bit more."
"O: A nice treatment to the already amazing base beer. The barrel character definitely imparts itself to start things off, but as the taste flows, the base beer shows up more and more, with the signature bitterness finally showing up at the end. A great sipper by itself, as well as trying side by side with the regular. Definitely worth picking up for the right price"

"Full bodied and creamy, with low carbonation. More complex by far than the regular Bigfoot, which is also a great beer. I'm glad I was finally able to get a couple of bottles."
""
"Very smooth for the high abv, but it loses some of the malt kick from the normal variety.  Definite bourbon aroma.  Burnt vanilla and cream notes, with a kick of the bourbon at the end.  Not too much ""beer"" flavor but that is fine, not every brew has to dial-up the hops & malts."

"overall: damn good barley and barrel treatment."

"Overall: I really love a good, complex, challenging BA strong ale, including beers that started off extremely hoppy. This just doesn't quite come together somehow in the way I'd hoped (having recently had aged Bigfoot for the first time and seeing the potential). I may grab another bottle to see if another year or so helps this realize its potential."
"750mL bottle. 2015 Expedition. 11.9% ABV. Pours a murky dark brown color with an inch of creamy white head. Tons of lacing. The aroma is lots of whiskey with vanilla, wood, caramel and a good amount of floral and earthy hops. The taste is lots of wood and whiskey along with a good amount of floral and spicy hops. Some caramel, vanilla, and toffee as well. Brown sugar and bready towards he end. Finishes with more of the woody whiskey. Lots of warming alcohol, as expected. Heavy, chewy mouthfeel. A bit oily. Overall, fantastic variant of a fantastic beer, as expected. Sierra Nevada does it again."

"The look and body were decent but the whisky taste was not to my liking."
"Sierra Nevada Barrel-Aged Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale 2015 -----4/5."
""
""
"I found this to be a perfectly competent, even very nice, barrel-aged American Barleywine.  But, in terms of taste and, certainly, value, I'd always choose 2 4-packs of regular Bigfoot over one bottle of this ."
""
"Thus far, the biggest difference between smell and taste for a beer. Smells quite sweet in a vanilla caramel way, like a really nice English Barley Wine, but taste is much hoppier, although significantly less hoppy then regular Bigfoot. While better than the regular Bigfoot, I prefer my barley wines to be sweeter."
"Epic BA version of an already great beer.   Enjoyed with some beer nerd friends and this was a big hit.   Vanilla, bourbon,  hop, caramel,  and malt flavors abound."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really great spin on a classic Barleywine. The bourbon barrel presence is strong but doesn’t overwhelm the complex hop and malt notes. Nicely complex and balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The base Bigfoot has had the hops tempered down a couple of notches while the time in wood has added some character and complexity."
""
"O:  Excellent beer. This reassures me that I need more BA barleywines in my life."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wasn't sure I liked it at first taste, but it definitely grew on me. The flavors blended the longer it was on your palate. Nice beer. Silky beer. Strong beer."
"Overall: Quite a nice beer, not so sure it's worth the $20 price tag though"
""
"A little unbalanced, boozy character shows though, I'd like a little more backbone. Not bad, though not necessarily an improvement over regular Bigfoot."
""
"Definitely this is a rather woody and piney sipper. This sure could have enjoyed more resting time (2015 expedition) to round its edges."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hopiness of the standard Bigfoot is greatly diminished and is replaced by a sweet heat. The alcohol is quite obvious in the aftertaste, which should diminish in time. There is a syrupy sweetness which may not appeal to some."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is very good.  I had avoided getting this a few years back as the price of it is clearly higher than the standard Bigfoot which is one of the better prices for what was a 6 pack and is now in 4 packs.  Unfortunately this year I wasnt able to find any before they sold out of inventory from my locals to keep the vertical going."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body was thinner than I like in a BW, but was typical for the base beer. Drinkability was hurt by the overpowering amount of booze, I would have a problem finishing a pint or bottle. Overall, while not a ""bad"" beer in the technical sense, this was an unenjoyable brew for me. YMMV."
"Edit: I forgot to mention that this is the newly released 2015 and is 11.9% abv. And as the beer warmed, the base beer's hoppiness came through."
""
"Bottle label 5/5 --this was probably the biggest factor in me deciding to pick this up."
""
""
""
"O - This is one great beer.  The bourbon barrel-aging has tamed the hop bite of regular Bigfoot and enhanced the other flavors.  It now seems like a cross between American and English barleywines.  I've always really liked Bigfoot and this version takes it up a notch or two.  Impressive.  Really sits in the sweet spot for my palate.  I'm rating this a tad above the also-excellent Bourbon Barrel-Aged Narwhal; likely-reflecting my changing preferences towards Barleywines over Imperial Stouts.  This is going to age really well."
""
""
"Recommendation: A bit easier to come by in 2015 compared to 2013, so get on it while you can, it's totally worth it."

"Big foot maple candy, very smooth and not overdone."
""
""
""
""
"I think there's an excellent bee here with more age but it's rough around the edges fresh. I picked up multiples so I'll have the opportunity to revisit some years down the line."
"Pours a dark, reddish brown with a light brown thin head.  The nose is robust and delicious. Whiskey and booze right up front. Toffee, vanilla, pepper, mild citrus, Hawaiian Punch. The flavor is really nice. A bit more subtle than other barrel aged barleywine I've had. The mouth feel is a bit too thin, but still nice."
""
""
""
"Slightly opaque and strong whiskey smell.  The taste is unbalanced - alcohol forward and surprisingly bitter and thin.  Overall, this brew has some decent qualities but they are not working well together.  Aged in whiskey barrels for an entire year is probably what drives the price here but for me the price tag does not justify beer."

"Big letdown for me. I had high hopes for this one, but it couldn't compete with things like CW BBBW or TH Twisted Jim. It had an old dusty flavor to it. Barrel flavors were weak."
"2700th review! 750 ml bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage, bottled in late 2012. Pours lightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, oak, bourbon, citrus zest, herbal, light pine, and toast/oak earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate citrus/pine hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, oak, bourbon, citrus zest, herbal, light pine, and toast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of pine/oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, oak, bourbon, citrus zest, herbal, light pine, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, balance, and robustness of big dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged barleywine. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is a dark, crystal clear, caramel coloring with no head.  Nose of vanilla, oak, molasses, and spiced wood.  More layers release as it warms.  Heavy sweetness throughout.  Flavors are booze forward, with a vanilla and spice follow.  Immediate warmth, with a vanilla and old world fruit backbone, with date, raisin, and fig throughout.  This is a malt bomb.  Very boozy.  Big, bold body, but somehow thin, as well.  Interesting.  The aftertaste is all booze and malt.  The finish is warming, with caramel, toffee, and booze.  Heavy."
"Surprisingly delicate with the barrel aging yet strong enough to be throughly enjoyable with each sip."

"one of the better american barleywines around, if it even still is around at all. this is just awesome. deep mahogany, almost ruby red in color, the richest of ambers, hazy but not dirty looking, and hanging on to a short half inch of just off white bubbles. the nose is great, still hanging in there with bigfoots characteristic hop intensity, but its mellowed from the oak, and from the first whiff, an intense and wonderful barrel character is evident. i get a lot of vanilla and toasted marshmallow, a pronounced nuttiness, maybe almond, and a nice molasses sweetness among the charred oak. the flavor comes in waves, bigfoot first, which is huge for me in barreled beers, i get the hops in the middle with the grain before it. the grain doesnt provide as much sweetness as the whiskey does i dont think, but all the nuance is wonderful. vanilla for sure, maple syrup, brown sugar, and still the hops, which play well with the oak. the alcohol is invisible even at ambient temperature, and the carbonation is just enough to keep it alive and moving. i drank this way too fast, a sign of how elegant it is really, and a testament to how not thick it is. not syrupy or dense or even filling, a great texture in a style that is usually candy teeth. i dig this a lot, extremely impressed by its degree of refinement, and would love to sit on a bottle of this for awhile, although the hops presence makes this special and it may fade off in time. truly world class example of a barrel aged strong ale."

"O: Saved from my 1500th BA review, this was a let down as the wood character really supplants a lot of what makes Bigfoot great -- intense caramel and toffee maltiness and citrus and earthy hoppiness in one big bodied but drinkable package. The tannins and oakiness just clouded the beer for me."

"O - A very flavorful, boozy beer. Wish the alcohol were hidden a little more, but it is still outstanding. I'd imagine this one would only improve with continued aging."
""
""
"O: I had missed out on buying a bottle of this early on before I had even had Bigfoot (I think) but I wasn't shelling out $16 for a 750 back then. Then, I heard they had a bottle at Frisco's for $25 and on-site consumption. Finally, it just randomly popped up on tap at Max's for a Sierra Nevada Pint Night (score). I'm glad I didn't bounce on the other opportunities because this one did not live up to the hype for me. I had been looking for it for a while, and it was sub-par. My friend had a bottle in his cellar and he said to be wary and that it won't be what you expect and he was right. Save your money and just age a case of regular Bigfoot every year."

"O - Nice, I love aging BigFoot, so this was a nice take on it."
""
"Same lovely amber maple syrup hues as regular Bigfoot with a smaller off white crown. Oaky aroma, somewhat muted. Taste? Taste! Absolutely magnificent barrel-aging in effect - vanilla, caramel, woody hops. I can't recall having had a smoother beer. It coats the palate with all those flavors thanks to the subdued carbonation. Perhaps it's because I know and love the base beer, but this is one of best beers I've ever had. Kudos Sierra Nevada & please make it available every once in a while."

"Bigfoot is well known as a pretty hopped-up barleywine. However, I thought that with some barrel aging and time, the hop bitterness would mellow out. That's not the case here. If you're into hoppy barleywines, definitely search this one out. If you want something deeper and sweeter, this can certainly be skipped."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: I had high expectations for BA Bigfoot and they were met. If you've drank a lot of Bigfoot and a lot of barrel aged beer, you should have a pretty good idea of what this *should* taste like. As is so often the case with Sierra Nevada, the finished product delivers."

"O: Be warned: this is a completely different beast compared to the standard Bigfoot. Expect more complexity, more alcohol, and more sweetness. More intensity, though? Not at all. This is a beer that shows just what barrel-aging can do: smooth a palate or, rather, mellow it out into something that consists of only one overall flavor. In this case, it’s the flavor of barrel-aged Bigfoot: roasty, resinous caramel-sweetness. I don’t know if I can handle another glass of it, but I sure as hell want one."
""
"Overall an unmistakably big sipper of a beer from SN."
""
""
"T - Tastes like Bigfoot with a bit of barrel to it. I was surprised my how hoppy this still was given the BA timing. It also was still really boozy and could probably use some time to mellow out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is transparent ruby red with lots of a tight tan head. Nose has lots of oak and vanilla, notes of caramel and some cooked brown sugar, light berry sweetness behind. Taste has more malt depth, chocolate, caramel, roasted malt and brown sugar, light berry sweetness and a fair bit of bitterness. Body is full with moderate carbonation and a chewy feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sierra Nevada is known for hop forward beers, and this beer fits the prototype. Poured into a sample glass, the beer was a murky brown color. It produced a bourbon aroma with notes of vanilla and dark fruits. In the initial taste, one detects notes of bourbon, vanilla, pungent hops, and a warming feature. The warmness continues in the aftertaste, though there is no burn from the alcohol. This was a good effort for Sierra Nevada, but the hops were a little to dominant. The hops even intimidated the bourbon to an unfair degree."
""
"This is a heavy barleywine that should stand the test of time. Very happy I got my hands on a few of these gems."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've been looking forward to this one as Bigfoot is one of my all-time favorite beers. The aroma and flavors are similar but very different. The whiskey barrels seems to bring mostly vanilla and fruit but not much whiskey flavor. The fruit esters were unexpected and added a nice touch. The mouthfeel was extraordinary. Not as complex as other barrel aged beers I've had but this is still awesome."
""
""
""
"Received in trade and shared with friends. Pours a medium copper color with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of rich caramel a brown sugary malts with a bit of faded earthy pine and citrus with a very nice oak and vanilla. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a creamy syrupy mouthfeel. Fantastic beer, I enjoyed every bit of it."
""
""
"Overall - This could use a few years to kill off the hops. Otherwise, it's fantastic."
""
"D - Dangerously good."
""
""
""
"This poured out as a mahogany brown color with a thin white head that fades quickly leaving no retention or lacing. The beer appears to be pretty thick, due to the syrupy residue on the glass. The smell of the beer is pretty boozy, definitely a high octane brew with the help of that barrel aging pouring out of it. The taste of the beer is malty, sweet, it's got some bitterness to it along with a subtle whiskey flavor in the mix as well. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth and boozy with a light carbonation. Overall it's a big beer, and sure to please any fan of the regular Bigfoot. Worth trying."
"A very good barleywine, spot on for what a BA barleywine should taste like, but still there are a lot of better examples out there that offer maybe a touch more complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fairly good drinkability for being over 12%. Does not taste that strong. A great twist on an old classic. Looking forward to see what develops a few years from now."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: I suppose that spirits mellow out and tone down the maltiness, bring out a sharp finish, and thus thin the head retention, so Barrel-Aged Bigfoot isn't as sexy as the base counterpart, but this barleywine is perfect in every other attribute. Similar to base Bigfoot, the complexity between taste and scent is extraordinary, but the tonal spiciness from barrel aging just does this beer wonders. A beautifully balanced, intelligently complex work of brewing art that will not be forgotten..."

"D - Nice big barrel character with enough balance."
"O – For 12.2%, this is an impressive beer because as boozy as it is, there’s very little to no alcohol burn and as the beer sits for awhile it opens up and mellows. Bigfoot is decent but age it in a barrel and the result is magic."

"this is a phenomenal beer in every aspect. as a barrel aged beer, it falls nothing short of its promise. as a barleywine, i like mine hoppy, strong, yet sweet.. this one is lacking on the hops, but is still damn close to perfect. as a barrel aged barleywine, it is delicious. a 12% abv that you don't realize until, well, it's too late."

"Poured into RR -tion glass. Appearance is a slightly cloudy auburn with a centimeter of dense white head which leaves heavy lacing. The nose features plenty of Bigfoot character up front with that notable earthy hop profile which is paired with caramel and molasses. The whiskey comes through next brings Ina string presence of vanilla. The hops are also very present on the finish and seem like they may clash with the whiskey. The taste tells a different story though. The hops a present up front and are smoothed out by a hefty dose of vanilla and oak. The flavors marry together quite well and make for a smooth finish. Mouthfeel is big with moderate carbonation. Overall, I was skeptical about such a hoppy barleywine being barrel aged, but it definitely works in this case. Very tasty."

"O: a solid beer overall, but a bit overwhelmingly boozy. Maybe in a year or two it was more balanced."

"Overall: After sitting in my fridge for maybe three weeks, I decided to split the bottle with my dad and what great move. To drink this on your own is just selfish, share the wealth....everyone should have a glass. Salud!"

"This is not my favorite barley wine every year but the aging process has stepped up the Bigfoot to something truely amazing. The big ABV on this beer is masked by incredible sweetness and coconut flavors. The medium bodied brew gives an initial taste of caramel malt and slight hop bitterness which is quickly consumed buy the sweeter notes imparted by the barrel aging. I am very excited to try my second bottle in a year or so, if I can wait that long to break it open!"
""
""
"O: I'm a big fan of bigfoot but I'm not sure this is an improvement. It's a vastly different beer. The barrel aging is so strong (and pleasant, I must admit), it obliterates a lot of the base beer. As a result it becomes a bit unbalanced I must say. Having said that, this is still delicious, especially for a whiskey lover. But it's very boozy and harsh, some age might really improve it I think (not that regular Bigfoot doesn't improve with age too). I enjoyed it but I think I enjoy regular bigfoot more."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a nice beer, though I didn't think it was a big improvment on the base beer. Lots of whiskey and caramel, if you're one of those people who love the normal Bigfoot you'll probably love this one. I've always thought Bigfoot was very good, but not great, and would say the same with this. Have a bottle of this and plan on sitting on it for a while."
"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a deep mahogany amber with a fine one finger light tan head with great retention and lots of lacing. Aroma dominated by whiskey with light citrus, hops and caramel malt. Flavor is well integrated caramel malt, light piney hops, vanilla, mild oak and lots of nice whiskey. Excellent medium to heavy creamy body. Flavors are considerably muted from fresh Bigfoot, but the time in the barrel has melded the flavors into a rich malty, whiskey infused whole with hints of the original hops. Very nicely done for lovers of whiskey barrel aged ales."

"Very nice. Would be curious to see how this beer tastes with a couple of years of bottle age on it."
"750ml bottle $15. I was excited to get a bottle because I heard only 20 cases came to CO. I also remember liking this when I had a taste at GABF five or six years ago. Unfortunately this one was a real disappointment for me. Appearance was about identical to regular Bigfoot, ruby red but less head than the regular. The aroma was quite nice, good whiskey and barrel coming out of the bottle and my glass. The flavor was just a mess for me. Huge bitter hops conflicted with whiskey flavors and then heavy brown sugar, just messy. I think my real problem was that the beer just had too much bitterness that in my opinion does not work well with the whiskey barrels. I would not purchase this again but if barrel aged Narwhal comes out, whew!"

"Overall, this is an excellent example of a classic beer becoming more iconic. To me its obvious the larger craft breweries (SN and SA) are struggling to stay pace with the more extreem, ever changing craft beer world. I recently have BA Ovilla, and it was awesome. I hope this becomes a year round brew."

"Was really looking forward to this & there's just not really much here. It's a fiery, alcohol laden canvas that hasn't had a bad modern painting splashed on it. Mediocre."

"Pours just like regular Bigfoot, deep ruby with a small slightly off white head. Smells of piney hops and some slight whiskey. Taste is hop forward with that great Bigfoot malt bill complimented very nicely by a slight vanilla/marshmallow aftertaste and some decent alcohol heat. The barrel doesn't overpower the base beer it is pretty much the perfect blend. Mouthfeel is perfect for a barleywine with just the right amount of carbonation. Regular Bigfoot is one of my favorite barleywines and I had thought that there was no room for improvement but this has taken me by suprise. Sierra Nevada has done wonders for the craft beer community for decades and this is just another great example of them pushing into the future."

"The ironic thing is this really doesn't taste much different than regular Bigfoot to me, with perhaps just a hint of slightly more caramel. Otherwise this isn't something that is doing much for me."

"O - I love Bigfoot and I was excited to get a few bottles of this. This is a phenomenal variation from the original. That time in the barrel imparted a remarkably balanced and complex flavor profile full of vanilla, whiskey, and appropriately sweet malts & fruits. There is a bit of heat, but I rather enjoyed that. Despite consuming the entire 12.2% ABV bottle, I never grew tired of this beer; in fact, I could have gone for another pour. I am glad I picked up multiples of this beer. I will hang on to one to see how it ages, but in my opinion this is a fantastic fresh beer. Hopefully this will be much easier to get once the NC brewery is up and running."

"D: There are many beers that don't do well with bourbon aging. This isn't one of them. If you like Bigfoot, then you should buy copius amounts of this if given the chance."
"Overall: This style is a good one especially for a hop lover, which I am not necessarily. I would definitely buy again."
""
""

""
"Overall: A very, very interesting beer. I knew drinking this one fresh out of the barrels would be an interesting experience. The time in the barrels has really given Bigfoot a big change. The flavor profile is much different (less hoppy, more malty & boozy), but there are still some remnants of it left in this one. I thought this was a good beer, and I can only imagine how incredible it can get with a couple years on it."

"I can't give it a bad review (ugh should anyone's second review be bad??) but simply warn y'all that this isn't a nice, easy to love kind of beer. It has it's challenges."

"Served from tap into a Raleigh Rare & Vintage Beer Tasting snifter. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, earth, citrus hop, caramel hop, vanilla, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, vanilla, caramel hop, earth, citrus, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The nose on this one definitely stood out over the regular version of this brew with the addition of vanilla and subtle oakiness on top of an already solid aroma. Hard to beat that if I’m honest. The rest of the brew was very solid for the style and quite easy to drink despite the ABV. Even the alcohol that was present in the flavor was very well integrated to the point that you wouldn’t even notice it unless you were truly looking for it. A really well done barrel treatment to an already solid brew. Can’t go wrong with that."
"While it was not exactly what I was expecting, it was still very enjoyable. Perhaps it is the Boltcutter effect, but I thought that BA Bigfoot would be an all out flavor assault and completely lacking in subtlety. Far from it, this beer was rather mellow and never overpowering. The flavor of the whiskey barrel rather than the intensity and the heat was most noticeable. I like what SN did with this. I hope they continue with this annual release."
"O-The coconut was too much for me. Wanted more bourbon/oak and caramel. Maybe age will do this some good."
""
""
""
"O - Taking a iconic beer such as Bigfoot and giving it the barrel treatment seems like a big, yet necessary step for Sierra Nevada which resulted in a terrific contrast to the yearly release and is quite a pleasure to drink side-by side with the ""normal"" one. It's most noticeable variance is (obviously) the whiskey, but also the stark lack of hops, seemingly overpowered by it's time in the barrel. This potent ""older brother"" to Bigfoot is a welcome addition to Sierra's offering which will hopefully return (with more availability?)."
"Poured from bottle into wine glass at avenue pub nola. Pours a syrupy brown with reddish hue. Not any head but some lacing is present. Big sweet syrup molasses malty booze aroma. Lots of whiskey notes and dried cherry. Taste is sweet dried fruity malty...all kinds of flavors here. Some tobacco and vanilla woody shine. Its soooo smooth its almost unbelievable. I could basically chug this. Wow. What a fantastic barleywine..."

"Drink this badboy near room tempature... Opens very nicely and has a wonderful array of deep flavor. It's certainly one of the top BA B-wines IMO. I can't wait to see what direction my other BABF goes in after 5years+... Highly recommended"

"This is a fantastic beer turned extra amazing."
"Pours a clearish ruby amber with a transient light cream head that fades to a thin collar and no lace. Aroma of whiskey and... um, whiskey and pine sap, maple, oak and oppression. Flavor is sweet and oaky. Doesn't really taste like Bigfoot, just straight whiskey and wood. Sweet and syrupy, burnt and toasted, piney hops and awww hell who cares. Very raw, oaky, hoppy and woodsy. Even Oaked Horizontal was more interesting than this. Seriously, what's the point of this mess?"
""
""
"Make no mistake, the barrel added to the intensity of this beer. The barrel did not, however, tone down the beast, only changed the hairdoo. This beer is fucking hardcore. I am really surprised it was in the barrel for over a year, as the beer still seems a little rough around the edges (something I respect in a fresh Bigfoot) but with the added potential the whiskey barrel added to the overall depth."
""
""
""
"O - Wanted to try a bottle of this fresh, as I love fresh Bigfoot in its standard incarnation (although being aged in a barrel for an extended time probably doesn't qualify this as truly fresh) and its big hop profile that dies over time. Despite these feelings, before drinking this I was figuring that this version would probably go against this and be better with some age. After drinking this bottle, I think that is probably correct. Not bad now, but a bit disjointed and unbalanced. I think as this ages, the whiskey will smooth out and the hops will fade more and this should transform into a much more balanced and better beer. As suspected, my other bottle will be sitting in the cellar for a while to see what happens with this over time."
"O- what a beast. This brew is a monster. There is so much activity going on that has blown up exponentially from the whiskey barrels. Detailed work that produced an excellent product. I would have expected nothing less from sierra nevada"
""
""
""
"O: I'd use this as a classic example of style for an oak aged beer as the barrel aging of strong yet the Barleywine flavors are clear and the overall flavors are balance and complementary."
""
""
" Overall I was very happy with this beer, the alcohol, while very high, was not too dominant in the flavor and it was unique for sure"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely a really good beer. The barrel notes already seem to be well integrated already and it compliments the already great base beer nicely. As mentioned, the carbonation is high for the style and it sort of throws the mouthfeel off a bit for me. I'd like to see this beer down the road to see what comes of it."

"I'd love to give this a taste a year or two down the road but I can dig it for what it is. Well done, Sierra Nevada. My favorite 750ml beer from them in recent memory."
"O: Truly phenomenal. One of the most exciting beers I've tried in recent memory. Highly recommended."
"I'm rather surprised of how much the barrels diealed down the hops and rounded out the malts to sherry-like or port-like savoriness and complexity. But with the influx of bourbon barrel aged beers, I have become accustomed to expect more bourbon character than this simplified whisky flavor provided. Even still, its a world class barleywine that more resembles English versions than the standard Bigfoot provides."
""
"O: Not so impressed by the bottle. A but thin, overcarbed, a light astringency and ultimate letdown compared to then draft version. It reminded me of BA Old Ruffian to a deree and thats not a positive."
""
""
""
"The nose is similar to the original only in the background, right up front it is definitely barrel aged. Bourbon, vanilla, toasted coconut, oak, caramel, molasses, a hint of piney hops and some booziness. The bourbon barrel comes forward REALLY strong in the taste. Toasted coconut, oak, bourbon, caramel, pine hops, vanilla, some citrus and sweet roasted, caramel malts. I like the more pronounced malts of the barrel-aged version as opposed to the standard Bigfoot. The hops are much more muted and subtle. Medium to full body, low but proper carbonation, very smooth, not too boozey and a sweet, somewhat chewy mouthfeel. I could drink this all the time whereas the original is a bit rougher, in my opinion."
"In the end, I am having a hard time separating what I paid for the beer along with the ""rareness"" as I rate the beer. This is a delicious beer, but I don't think it is a truly great beer."
"O: This was like an old friend who you respect as a cook and lets you try something that wasn't QUITE as good as what he or she made recently, but you can tell they are experimenting are their proud of it. I respect this beer and Sierra Nevada for making it."
""
"O-a nice variation of one of my favorite barleywines"
""
""
""
""
""
"Plenty of caramel still runs through the mouthfeel, but the hops are so far downplayed on the flavor list, you still can't believe this is Bigfoot. Its robust and strong, I don't want to say ""boozy"" but this is never going to be mistaken for a session ale either. I was pretty impressed, and I'm sure I'll save a bottle or two to drink in 2020 or whatnot down the road."

"A nice addition to regular Bigfoot, although the whiskey barrel aging made this one quite hot and somewhat difficult to easily drink. Hopefully this one will become more readily available, because I'd like to pick up a few more and age them to see if it blunts the heat a little. Thanks again to Jeff for this one."
"Overall definitely a blast to try. I love Bigfoot and seek it out each year. This is definitely a treat to get my hands on a bottle. Not sure how this would age but may give it a whirl if i can score another bottle!"
"Overall: I prefer this beer to KBS, and I love Breakfast stout. This beer is not a novelty, it is balanced to perfection and the whole concept was executed perfectly. Keep in mind I've only had 5-10 whiskey barrel aged beers, but I've had my fair share of barley-wines, including aged bigfoots. This beer is on a very high level."
"O - the abv never makes itself known but someone put whiskey in my Bigfoot and I like it!"
""
""
""
"O- This is a solid BA Barleywine, I was hoping for better but it just doesn't seem like whiskey and Bigfoot are a perfect combo. The beer is well made and well blended. I think on slight downfall is the quality of whiskey. While the whiskey is prominent in this beer, It's no Pappy. Regardless, It is a good beer that just didn't quite pan out perfectly."
""
""
""
"o - overall, as advertised. bigfoot in a whiskey barrel. it is a winner. paint me impressed!"
""
"Overall, I really thought that the barrel did wonders to this beer and really added some nice new dimensions to the base beer. I got the really nice background sherry and medicinal tones of 2-3 year old Bigfoot along with really nice barrel character. It didn't feel muddled as I thought it might with the combination of the hops and the barrel. Well done. I will be looking to get a bottle or two to see how this evolves over time."
""
""
"O: a great barleywine - complex and hearty, strong and only semi-sweet - sweeter than the normal Bigfoot, but not overly sweet; the bitter hops leaft a great aftertaste between sips. Reminded me of American and English strong ales/old ales. Definitely something to buy again if spotted."
"O: Nice tasty barley wine. I really prefer the original due to the lack of hops goodness but it was a special treat to have for sure. Cheers!"
"This beer capped off a vertical tasting of Bigfoot from 2007 to 2013. By this point, we were pretty much palate-fatigued, but this beer really made everyone sit up and take notice. The aroma is immediately striking, with its strong whiskey notes. Two years in the barrel really imparted a strong character. Same goes for the taste. It’s Bigfoot, but wrapped up in whiskey barrel goodness. Never too much of the barrel though. Really, the balance is exceptional in how they managed to deliver the best of both worlds. The oaky vanilla also nicely plays with the flavors. Barrel Aged Bigfoot was the star of the show as we all thought it was the most enjoyable beer of the bunch. I feel lucky to have tried this special release."

"A nice new take on Bigfoot. The whiskey compliments as supposed to competes. It's definately worth a try if you can land a bottle."
""

"O: Couldn't believe when my dad showed up at my doorstep in Ohio this morning and told me he came across a bottle of this in Indiana. I truly owe him, as this one was worth the hype. Thanks Pops!! Great balance of flavor, smell, and body."
"Maybe I shouldn't have drank this two hours before the U-M vs Indianer game,whoo it knocked me back a little.Poured into an oversized wine glass a deep burgundy with a nice tight one finger white head atop,great rich clarity.Big hop resins mixed with toasted oak in the nose,as it warms whiskey gets bigger and bigger.The whiskey barrel is really big on the palate but the powerful hops acts as a counter balance wich doesn't happen much with barrel aged beers,vanilla and dark fruit round out the flavor profile.This is a deeply consentrated flavorful beer,the hops are HUGE for something that has sat for a year,but the aging makes it complex to the hilt.Thanks to Roger at Bestway for hookin me up this,it was a pleasure to drink...to say the least."

"This one is just not for me. JMO"
"Overall this beer was amazing, everything I had hoped it could be, definitely gonna try to seek out more of this to see how it is with some more age on it."
""
"Bottom line: if you like booze-bombs, open one of these ASAP. Otherwise, I'd suggest sitting on this for a while before opening. Definitely has potential."
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, toffee, whiskey, and wood. Taste is much the same with a hoppy finish and an alcohol kick. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell and a hoppy flavor I wasn't quite expecting from a barrel aged beer."
"Hoping i am in the right place for this beer as it it appears i am the first to review the newly released 750 bottled version. A slow hiss as i pull the cork, this brew pours a brilliant amber ruby hue with a beige finger of creamy foam - stunning looking. The nose is a beauty as well, bourbon barrel booze esters, caramel, nougat, vanillin. Also bright sugar plums and sticky toffee along with dates and booze soaked figs. Very complex on the nose with a lot of booze as well. The taste is not quite to the level of the nose with the alcohol hiding up some more of the noses nuanced characteristics. Brings oloroso sherry, rye whiskey as well as irish whiskey, somehwhat grainy and drying. The finish is somewhat tannic and very boozy, cannot imagine how amazing this will be in two years after having time to mellow and all the flavors to integrate."

"O: I came to this event specifically for this beer (and to donate $ to Toys for Tots). It was totally worth it and this beer surpassed my expectations which were already high. A very special beer. Talked to the local SN rep who said this is the beer that is going into bottles in early 2013. Went into barrels in 2010. Specifically Stranahan, Jim Beam, and Heaven Hill. Supposedly a mistake but they went with it for the 30th Anniversary of Bigfoot this year. Amazing stuff."

"D: Strong, but strong is good. If you wanna go to a kegger and dont wanna drink shit beer but still be on the same wavelength as the other folks. A sixer of this will suffice. You'll be wankered without the bonging or beer games... drink up! I actually moved back to my small home town and this is the best beer they have to offer at the LQ."
"Outstanding for the style. Pours a slightly cloudy brownish-red with a small layer of foam with a complex malty aroma with hints of hops as well. Tastes rather astringent with lots of fresh hops and a nice bitter finish. Strong with good carbonation, great body. Hearty and drinkable, great for sippin."
"To me, and I love huge, huge flavorful beers, the barrel just needed to be turned down a notch so this exceptional brew gets to show itself off a bit more."
"2013 bottle: whiffs of coconut, big brown sugar and caramel, wet wood, lingering bitterness. Lots of dry oak, traces of dry piney hops from the base beer."
"The Sierra Nevada Brewery is an amazing place to sample beers. They always have ones that you have never seen in the store or have never heard of. Last night I had wood barrel aged bigfoot. It was aged in a whiskey barrel so it ended up being 12.5% and it had a nice taste of whiskey at the end."
"D: There are many beers that don't do well with bourbon aging. This isn't one of them. If you like Bigfoot, then you should buy copius amounts of this if given the chance."
"I was very excited to try this so maybe my expectations were a little high and I'm a little over critical. I always dreamt of what Bigfoot would taste like barrel aged, probably more so than any other beer. I think if it would have stayed closer to the original ABV and maybe a little longer in the barrel it would have reached perfection. As it was though, it was an amazing beer that I was more than glad to have consumed. I hope I get a second chance with this one some day."
