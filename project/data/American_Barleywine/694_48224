3.81,-7.7,4.5,4,3.5,4.25,3.75,"Bottle courtesy of @Casey3236. Pours a mostly opaque deep nutty brown, with hints of rich woody red. Creamy tan head that held pretty well before fading into a medium collar and a few wisps. Sticky legs and good lacing. Aroma is molasses, deep earthy malt, woody, some leathery damp soil. Taste is dark caramel, nutti-chocolate with some almond like toastiness, leather and earth. Rich mouthfeel, full bodied and low to medium carbonation. I think I aged this one a bit too long, or maybe not long enough. That dirt-like flavor is a little off putting.","mverity","Apr 07, 2014"

4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; Spring 2011 bottling, 2 years old now. Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, apple, toast, light pine, brown sugar, orange rind, brown bread, orange zest, floral, grass, candi sugar, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with a fair amount of hop presence. Taste of caramel, raisin, apple, toast, brown sugar, light orange rind, light pine, brown bread, floral, candi sugar, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light pine, floral, candi sugar, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with a fair amount of hop presence; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, fairly slick, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent American Barleywine at 2 years of age. Very nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate hops; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 26, 2013"

3.61,-12.6,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"The bottle pours a deep murky maroon that is nearly candied dark brown. The head is surprisingly large and frothy with a maple-syrup-mixed-into-whipped-cream coloring to it. Lacing from the beer is sticky and web-like over the glass, leaving fat stalactites of foam on my snifter’s walls. The beer smells bitter and sweet, but surprisingly underwhelming, with notes of prickly alcohol and cloyingly sweet candied sugars and caramel assaulting the nose. Brown sugar is also present and enticing, evening out some of the harsher notes of the smell, though it really is a light smell overall. Faint hints of pine and citrus hops can be found, though this is a 2011 bottle of Flying Mouflan, so they have obviously died down a little. Slight bready notes can also be sensed in the edges of the smell, falling away into the sweet alcohol smell. As it warms up the phenol smells grow stronger. The beer tastes big and pleasant. The flavor profile is surprisingly simple, but actually quite tasty. The beer opens as caramelly bready before opening into sweet candied sugars and brown sugar before it transitions into a mixture of slight citrus and the honey-sweet malts. Eventually the beer makes a slow march to harsh aspirin bitters that pepper the tongue in an almost cloying way, though the sweet it not quite too much. Light notes of citrus and pine are also present, but very light. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, as a barleywine should be, moving over the tongue nicely and leaving it sticky but dry while the sides of the mouth wet themselves to try and manage the hoppy bitters. Overall, I think I like the Flying Mouflan. It’s different, and nowhere near as sweet as I was expecting it to be, which I actually like. I would love to try a fresher bottle and see how the juicy hops play with it, but as it stands it was a nice sipper with beautiful notes of brown sugar, though nothing too special. The drawback to this beer was definitely the aspirin bitters that assault the tongue in the close and aftertaste. I’m newer to the barleywine style, so I’m not quite sure how to judge this one on style, but on its own I think it is a nice beer with a little bit of a bitters problem. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to pass up either.","Maxwell","Oct 18, 2012"

On a personal note, I'm not terribly fond of the burnt caramel malt backbone, but reviewing it objectively, it still works well with everything else going on. Not what I expected from a barleywine - but exactly what I expected from a revved up Nugget Nectar. In spite of its numerous merits though, I'd take NN over this quite easily.

Aromas of sweet, layered malts and a citrus hops balance. Malt smells of nut, toffee, and chocolate with an earthy overtone. Smells great. Flavors are roasty toasty initially, with a rich and tangy caramel and toffee backbone highlighted by some resiny, bitter hops. Good, solid lacing left behind as you drink. Very well balanced and very smooth bodied, the beer has a slightly cloying, sweet and bitter balanced aftertaste. The finish is rich and smooth, with a slight linger from the resiny hops. Solid brew...would be interesting to age.","GarthDanielson","May 14, 2012"

Yes, I did taste all the complex notes of figs, citrus, caramel and something akin to hot-crossed-buns but the booze for me was so punchy and the hops so aggressive I just couldn’t get into it.

Sort of an earthy feel the whole way through so it's a little gritty, but there's a moderate carbonation level. Still the 9.3% alcohol level is pretty well masked and this beer is really drinkable. Overall this beer is pretty awesome, full flavored, cellerable, and just tasty. Plus this beer is in the 5$ range so the value is insanely good, always scores bonus points with me when a beer is awesome and financially friendly.

Smell is of citrus zest, citrus fruit, and some malt aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, citrus fruit, malt, and some subdued cocoa powder on the aftertaste. A mild hop bitterness sticks to the palate after each sip. This beer has a good carbonation level with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

4.35,5.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Deep brown with reddish hues and a whispy head that slowly reduces to off-white swirls. The nose is sweet and fruity with plenty of earthy tones mixed in. The palate covers a wide spectrum of flavors. Sweet dark fruits that compliment the warm boozy elements are met with earthy and piney hops that bring a nice balance to the whole thing. Low carbonation and a velvety mouthfeel fit the style nicely and make it an easy sipper. I loved this brew from the start and it only got better as it warmed toward the end of the bottle. A well conceived barleywine.","JunkYardJake","Oct 03, 2011"

The brown is like a deep leather there is a thin tan color head which recedes to a skim half and nothiness half. The aroma is of deep piney hops along with dark fruits. The taste starts with a piney and earthy hop bite which gives way to dark fruits and figs, along with a mellow milk chocolate taste. The end has a nice deep burn. The mouthfeel is full bodied. Overall this is a very solid beer, it is a sipper for sure, but very good and very enjoyable.","goblue3509","Sep 23, 2011"

4.4,6.5,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a deep brown, amber. An appetizing 1/2" slight brown head diminishes after a few sips, nice lacing. Aware of hops as soon as I cracked the bottle; earthy hops, deep malts, some oak in the nose. My first sip made me smile. Malty sweet and hop bitter throughout. Such a full flavor and over so quick! No problem though this only encourages more sipping. Mouthfeel is terrific. Superfine carbonation, if any. Goes over the palate smoothly and pleasantly. Overall this is a great brew, one I will certainly be buying again. The 9.3% is noticeable only on inspection, it is hidden under a rich, full flavor which is hugely drinkable. Love Troegs take on the barleywine, malty and hoppy and bold.","stickynotes","Sep 19, 2011"

The aroma is quite malty...a touch of dark fruit, some highly roasted scents that aren't barleywine-esque, but are still very fitting for this beer. Some alcohol is notable in the smell...but this characteristic comes out seriously in the taste. Boozy, malty, sweet. Bitterness balances the sweetness. Full in body and very drinkable.","Suds","Beers"

3.55,-14,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"3.5 D: Honestly I'm a bit shocked. Every other time I've had this I've enjoyed it much more. Of course, I never had it around the six month period. It seems like I'm right in the middle of this beer's awkward stage. I think I might re-review this at the one year mark. When this is fresh, the hops pop and give it a malty DIPA vibe. When this is old, the malts really shine. Right now, I can't say either of those things.","DavoleBomb","Aug 05, 2011"
4.08,-1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"It pours a murky copper/ brown color with a filmy tan head that left a ton of lacing. Right of the bat you can smell fruity, juicy hops, I noticed aromas of grapefruit and tangerine with lots of candied caramel and a hint of maple and sugar cookie. It tastes of dark fruits and caramel candy with brown sugar some citrus hops in the back ground and a hint of alcohol. The beer is thick and low in carbonation with a warming lingering finish.

Nice finger of head is a light tan like espresso crema. The nose is faint, burnt sugar and malt, with some hoppiness, nothing exciting. Taste is much better, nice hops up front, piney and fresh. The weight is good and the middle is malty and heavy with caramel and lemon peel. The finish is heavily bitter and a little to alcoholic for my taste. Overall a good beer I would drink again without hesitation. If I had another bottle I would give it a year, let the hops, bitterness and alcohol fade...making way for the nicer caramel and malt.","wchollif","0"

After a year most of the strong flavors of hops have subsided, but there are remnants of a light spicy herbal flavor that lingers behind the rich caramel. There are notes of vanilla and clove in the flavor as well but they are minor accents. There is a bit of a sting on the end of the sip, but for the most part this is really mellow and smooth. I'm thinking that perhaps I should have laid it down for another year in this regard. Overall this is a top tier barleywine. I could have this everyday no matter the weather.

The taste was very similar to a barleywine...very plum, raisin, and sweet, with a sweet, alcoholic finish. Thick-bodied, and smooth; very little carbonation in the feel.

3.96,-4.1,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"The flavors on the palate are excellent. A blend of caramel, brown sugar and rather surprisingly, a little cream too. In this aspect, it reminds me of caramel cream candy. Fruity hoppiness is present in the mid-palate with a blend of orange peel and pine. While there's a little bit of apple, it's more red delicious than granny smith, so I doubt there's any acetaldehyde here. Brown sugar is present on the finish, along with a little leather and some hop bitterness. In fact, the finish is where the hops are most assertive, lingering on as a balancing bitterness. While the flavors are great, and I really do like that this isn't too sticky, a little bit more lingering sweetness of the finish would make this world class. The mouthfeel is sublime. Soft, smooth and creamy, the gentle carbonation works beautifully with the flavors, making this very drinkable.","DefenCorps","0"

Pours a dull, semi-hazy mahogany with a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that quickly disperses into a thick, bubbly band around the edges. Nose reveals hops, toffee, dark fruit and ethanol. Taste follows nose - backbone is quite malty. Fruity/Toffee quality precedes the hoppy character that came first in the nose. Alcohol quality also diminishes. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an even and pleasant carbonation - some prickliness at the front of the tongue, diminishes towards the back. A well-balanced American Barleywine that doesn't punch you in the mouth with hops. Perhaps a little light, but very tasty.

Very complex with hints of oak, toffee, vanilla, grapefruit, molasses, dark fruits, pine and alcohol. I would swear this was oak aged. Reminds me a lot of oak aged Arrogant Bastard. This is one of those beers that you need to let warm up. Definitely improves as it warms. Nice thick, chewy, bitter and resiny mouthfeel with the alcohol warming slightly throughout.

Amazing fruit, fig, hint of alcohol, that classic barleywine smell (yeast?), a hint of pine from the hops, and a slight must. Wow again on the taste, the overall balance is what I consider critical in a beer and this one delivers. Heavy, bold malt up front combines with the sweetness of the alcohol to for a flavor and texture similar to molasses. Not much flavor detected in the middle but on the finish is a nice balance of citrus hops, grapefruit and pine. Mouthfeel is slick and oily do to the alcohol, but also a bit thick (in a good way) due to all the malt. Drinkability is good for a high powered beer; you may only require one bottle though.

This is a sipper. Overall I really enjoyed this beer, I thought the hops would be more bitter on the back-end but as the bottle says this is Nugget Nectar after it was pushed off the side of cliff. It is really an incredibly malty version of Nugget Nectar. I want to see what some age does to this cause I think a year or two will really make this beer shine.","nas5755","Aug 07, 2010"

However, the flavor has a deeper complexity of malt back on draft than from the bottle.

Alcohol is big and feels right at about the 9% or so range. I prefer Nugget Nectar to this, but it was a fun beer to try.

I think there's some wheat in there too, but I'm still trying to get over the fact that a plant rocked my world so badly. Yep, the fetal position is involved, as is a dank corner. *tear* But the best way to overcome a problem such as this is direct confrontation. And, following conventional wisdom, confrontation has yielded understanding. The pine that was so overpowering before is till there up front, but soon a bit of light molasses (very light) and very bitter chocolate enter the fray, diluting the pine, but not getting rid of it. The olio marches through in harmony, nice and smooth, though with a slight bite of carbonated fury (think the nipping of a mean miniature pinscher).

Obviously line between dipa and barleywine can be a thin one, especially with age and I'd describe this as what NN would be if it aged a little more gracefully.

Wicked east coast hop explosion with bitter waves of glory more dirty and earthy tobaccco layers arising straight from the womb of mother earth.

This is considered an American style barleywine, and that it is. With 9.3% abv, it's not a beer you will be enjoying all afternoon/evening, but it does mask the alcohol flavor quite well. The beer itself is a light mahogany color with hops hops hops in the nose. This is one of the more hoppy barlywines I have had the pleasure of trying. The taste is complex with notes of vanilla and chocolate as well as balanced bitterness from the hops. The mouthfeel is nice with all of the flavors blending smoothly and finishing slightly sweet. Overall, this is definitely a beer worth checking out, and it's a must for hop heads.","tgdigital","Jun 15, 2009"

Subtle malt presence. Flavor is similar, although a fair bit stronger. Sugary candy, with a spicy fruit hop presence up front. A touch of malt in there, but this is a hoppy beer (definitely more DIPA than barley wine, in my opinion). Body is fine - medium, appropriate for the brew. Nice carbonation. Overall, a solid beer that's good but not quite excellent (which I expect from Troegs's "bigger" beers, and especially a barley wine).","soupyman10","Jun 13, 2009"
4.18,1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"What an awesome Barleywine. The beer pours with a darker brown (less mohogany and ruby) than most, leading me to beleive a toasty melanoidin-rich Dopplebock malt profile awaits. Thick foamstance rises from the glass and provides a mousse-like barrier to plow through on my way to the first few sips. Serious malt aromas confirm the toasty, bready hints and provide dehydrated fruits of cherries, berries, apples, figs, dates, and raisons; but these all take a secondary role to the malts-- Think fruitcake. Flavors mirror the aromas exactly. Sweet but more malty keeps the beer from cloying or syrupy. The esters take on a rum-soaked taste and don't interfere with the rich malt flavors and textures. Hopped for flavor and bitterness, they provide more of a pine resin and orange zest taste. Very bready and becomming increasingly dry going into the finish, this beer is both well attenuated and creamy-rich. The malts take on an evaporative nature in the mouth, making drinkability a breeze. Hop bitterness accentuate the dryness in the finish and aftertaste. Perhaps a bit cleaner than the Bigfoots and Old Crustacian in the malts and esters, which makes this beer great at layering flavors and keeping confusion at bay.","BEERchitect","Jun 12, 2009"

The nose is lovely, combining sweet caramel and spicey hops in a very strong scent that invites from afar. The mouth is very prickly and quite sticky, almost to the point of being syrupy. The taste is marvellously rich, with equal portions chocolate and pine sap, blending across the tongue and lingering long after the swallow. Powerfully hopped, yet nicely balanced, the strength is also quite evident. This one might be too strong to finish a bomber alone, but Globetrotterette has already claimed the second pour for her own. As she does not normally like strong or hoppy beers, that is high praise indeed. Well done!","Globetrotter","Jun 11, 2009"

Malty citrus bite up front, caramel and toffee peak through in the middle followed by a lingering somewhat dry resinous hop finish. Creamy mouthfeel, thick body, medium carbonation.

The pour was beautiful - much darker than expected, a deep burgundy, very red. Smells is very, very sweet hop aroma, but the smell isn't really too strong if smelled from snifter, you have to smell it right out of the bottle to get it. Very sweet backbone of sugary sweetness. The flavor is like a DIPA with a more potent sweetness, very citrusy as well. Mouth is fairly thick, almost chewy. A bit syrupy, but good. Its certainly delicious and nice to sip on.

Bitterness was balanced and really changed from start to finish. Up front it was in the background, allowing the sweet malts and caramel dominate. Mid-palate was where the hop flavour started to happen, again with the grapefruit and a bit of pine, lots of pith. Bitterness grew towards the end and really lingered, along with a mixed fruit basket of citrus goodness. Caramel and toffee were still present at this point, but had definitely taken a back seat to the hops. Full bodied without being overly heavy, carbonation was on the lower side making it fairly smooth. Some alcohol flavour and warmth in the finish.

Full and robust in the mouthfeel. You have to refrain from crushing this beer, it is really that drinkable. There's no sign of the alcohol in this beer.

Grapefruit hop flavor starts things off flowing into a rindy/resiny bitter hop. A noticable malt backbone sits shotgun but helps balance out the bitter hop. A toasted character to the malt, with honey and a slight raisin flavor. The brew has a full body with enough carbonation to avoid being slick or syrupy, which is preferable to me. Seems to have more a malt presence than most barleywines, closer to an American Strong Ale. Finishes with a hoppy bitterness. A nice malty, hoppy barleywine, good mixture of hop flavor and bitterness.","Gmann","0"

Tastes like hops dipped in candied sugar and rolled in dark chocolate nibs". I like the sound of this. The beer is very dark as compared with Nugget Nectar, hazy auburn / dark orange-brown with thick creamy tan foam. Actually it looks a lot like Aventinus (but the aroma and taste are completely different). The aroma is hoppy as hell, it does indeed smell like a very strong version of Nugget Nectar. The taste is less appealing (but still good), very sweet as if candi was added instead of more hops. I guess this makes it more barley-winey as it adds fermentables, but I was hoping for more of a DIPA style. The mouthfeel is thick, very coating. I have another which will probably cellar for 1 year to see how the malt develops out as the hops mellow. But maybe I'll trade it before it gets that far.","TurdFurgison","Apr 09, 2009"

Color on this beer is rosy, with not too much in the way of heading. Smell is very hoppy, with some notes of chocolate and candy sugar (as indicated by the label) buried beneath the hop profile. The hops have a very nice spicy aroma to them. Flavor is really hoppy, but with a nice underlying element of fruit and tobacco. It ends on a very dry, bitter note. Body is medium, which is cool considering all the flavor coming out of this brew. As tasty as this is, the alcohol can be felt easily with this beer. I would recommend sharing this one with a friend or two. Troegs hit a home run with me on this beer. I love the fact that it is sort of a difficult to classify beer.

The first thing that enters my mind after smelling and tasting is this beer is I've found Nugget Nectar's granddady. Nugget Nectar concentrate in a bottle, if you will. Smells and tastes of resinous, skunky (the good kind), sticky super fresh hops. Notes of caramel and brown sugar are present, but the hops keep everything in nearly perfect symmetry.
