"2010 vintage. Mellow, rich and tasty."
"2012.  Tasted from draft at Firkin on February 13, 2014."
""
"Might not be the best BBA Barleywine you'll ever have, but it had a kind of unique flavor, very tasty.  A very enjoyable effort."

"O â€“ Barrel aging seems to be coming off a bit harsh, and the hops stay way too prominent.  Good beer but needs some maturing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit:  the above review was perhaps too dependent on initial impressions.  The weird flavors do mellow some as the beer progresses.  I increased the score by a quarter point."
"Overall - A so-so American barleywine. There is a good malt presence along with the woodiness from the oak barrels, but I was hoping for more assertive bitterness from the hops. This one is a definitely a sipper as the ABV is quite noticeable."
""
""
""
""
"Ok, so, what we have here, is a seemingly and strangely bottle-reconditioned (the froth, she don't lie) barleywine, of English-style extraction (the hops apparently just incapable of speaking for themselves), with some of the titular old-lady's, um, blue-haired musty crustiness resplendent everywhere. Nah, not for me, not for me at all."

"review: this barley wine is pretty legit. as with most barley wines, by the time i get thru half the bottle i've got angels dancing behind my eyeballs, which is very pleasing. this beer, as with most good beers, reminds me of times in my past which were fun and memorable. if anyone is on the fence about trying it, i would say go for it, you;ve got nothing to lose. if they have more at total wine, i will probably buy teo bottles. one to drink, and one to stick way back in the back of the pantry for about a year to see how it goes later on. enjoy!"

"Once the massive head settled to a reasonable level, the liquid below it was a dull chestnut brown color, with a gooey murkiness to it. In the nose, phenols and some herbal bitterness, lesser notes of caramel and yeast. The taste was definitely weird and off, but I actually didn't think it was completely undrinkable. There were flavors of caramel and bready (bretty?) yeast, cooking sherry, and actually lots of herbal hops. Not very good, and possibly infected, but as I said, I didn't find it undrinkable, surprisingly. Did I go back for more after my little sampler? Nope. Light-medium body and pretty thinned out in the mouthfeel. Overall, this beer was a huge mess, and not at all what I like in my barleywines."
""

"I had a sample glass at the brewery and was impressed enough to take home a growler. It has a wonderful reddish brown color with a two to three finger off white head. The aroma of fine barley malt is immediately apparent. It tastes better than it smells too and has a nice balance of malt to hops. All in all a great barley wine. Well Done!!"
"Overall this brew is awesome. Big Sky IMHO has nailed down the length of time to barrel age their brews...not to overly boozy but enough barrel flavor to blend nicely with the base beer. This rates right up there with Firestone Walker's Sucaba."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, not bad but compared to beers like Sucaba it leaves a lot to be desired. It has good flavors and complexity but the flavors are not very well rounded and there is a bit too much alcohol heat for the ABV. It could be hidden better."
""

"o - a nice enjoyable BA barley worth hunting down for the fans of the style. Smooth and easy drinking with a great toffee caramel flavor with vanilla-ing oak glazed over the top. Would have again!"

"M: Super thin/overcarbonated."

"750 ml bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottle 2843/3240. Pours moderately hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, tangerine, orange zest, floral, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, light clove, brown sugar, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt and barrel notes with a fair amount of hop presence; and good strength. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, tangerine, orange zest, floral, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, clove, light pine, brown sugar, and toasted earthiness. Light floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, pear, apple, orange zest, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, clove, brown sugar, and light pine on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt and barrel flavors with a moderate amount of hops; with a great malt/hop/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, slick, and lightly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barleywine style. All around great balance and complexity of malt, barrel, and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall: A pretty solid BA barleywine. I got too anxious to try it, and unfortunately this one was a little too fresh. Still a lot of good things going on, but this one just felt like 8 to 12 months would help it out an awful lot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Vanilla, mellow bourbon, tobacco leaf, papery dessert sweetness. It's a bit hollow on the palate but it goes down smooth. The beer warms and evolves in a big way - cherry cobbler, root beer float, red wine... really interesting."
""
"I'd love to have another for aging."
""

"O: A fantastic BA Barleywine. One that I would put on the same playing field as sucaba. It's that good. Highly underrated brewery/BA program. ITs a highly limited brew, but if you come across it buy it. Its fantastic."
""
"750ml corked and caged bottle. 2011 vintage served in a tasting glass. Bottle opened with a pop. Pours a hazy amber-mahogany hue with a fluffy, 1/2 inch, cream-colored head that settles into a consistent, frothy skim. Nose expresses citrus, cotton candy and some vanilla notes. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of some toffee flavors as well as some ethanol. Unfortunately, the mouthfeel on this beer kills it for me - way too much carbonation first off; however, once you get past that, it comes off somewhat thin and slightly oily. Overall, a very good example of the style - I have a second bottle, so I'll have to see what 3-5 years does for this beer. Hopefully it will dissipate the carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One other note: be careful with this vintage at least, over-carbonation seems to be an issue. I sent a bottle in a trade that broke (only bottle break I've EVER had break in transit - assuming it was the pressure on the C&C), and I've seen lots of feedback on over-carbed bottles and semi-gushers."
""
""
""
"M - Medium body, almost full body. Moderate carbonation. A little over-carbonated, which likely detracts from the mouth feel."
"Pours a murky red amber color. This one looks to be super over carbonated. The smell is sweet. I'm getting dark fruit, caramel, and a hint of vanilla. The carbonation distracts from the taste, which is pretty good otherwise. Lots of caramel malts and some vanilla from the barrel. The bourbon is smooth with just a touch of alcohol burn."
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought it was a decent barleywine and was worth trying."
""
"Overall - The flavors are ok, but it's mouthfeel is a tremendous let down. Thin, kinda they way I felt about Ivan the Terrible."
"D: I think the beer is good, but not quite as good as maybe say Mirror Mirror or some others. More malt forward than many popular Barley wines, which I like. This is a good beer, but not a great one. Worth a try, but I would split the cost if I could."
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, nice blend of bourbon and malt. Don't know why the wanted the carbonation to be so high. Really detracts from the flavor, IMO."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was expecting a bit more from this one but it wasn't too bad. It definitely improved as it warmed and I would love to see this with a few more years of age."
""
"O: A big and boozy barleywine. Bourbon is quite strong in this one, unfortunately overpowers the barleywine aspects a bit I feel. With some age on this I think it could be stunning, however. It's pretty good as is, just quite sharp, boozy and bourbon heavy. Heavy and sweet - a sipper for sure!"
"Whoa, this is some really good stuff and a gift from good ol' Paul B! Poured at a good temperature with a large, billowy, fluffy, light tan head that settled after a bit and no lace. Color is a slightly hazy amber red. Aroma is yeast, malt, dark ripe fruit, burnt sugar. Flavor's much like nose with bittersweet malt balanced very nicely with perfect carbonic tang. Body is perhaps the best I've ever had for a barley wine and despite its power, is quite drinkable with mouth filling textures accented by aggresive appropriate carbonation. Finish is like flavor, of average length, a little boozy, and tasty. Gracias por esta Paulo!!"
""
""
"Overall, I must say that this has been a want of mine for a very long time and it didn't disappoint. It could have had some more barrel in the nose and taste but overall a pretty good barleywine. Pick this up if you can but don't trade the world for it."
"Overall: Solid offering by Big Sky. It a tasty beer, but its overcarbonated. The beer was not a gusher when the C&C was opened, but you gotta pour this beer really gently. I wonder if the carbonation will get better with sometime."
""
"O - Good beer that could have been great. There are elements of a fantastic barleywine in there that were undone by one glaring flaw. I definitely will pick up another vintage of this when I find myself in Seattle again... hopefully it's sooner rather than later."
""
""
"O: Good, but I definitely prefer barrel-aging in less hoppy barleywines. The old hop character, while interesting in its own right, sort of covered up some of the barrel character."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to ThirstyHerf for sharing this bottle. A great American-brewed barleywine that still seems to be flying under the radar. Deep amber, khaki head. Big dark fruit notes on the nose - raisin and currant. Toffee and caramel notes are at the forefront too, but the dryness allows the hops to stand firm. Balancing herbal flavors with a smooth bitterness. Complementary fruit from yeast adds a nice depth of flavor."
""
"O-- Maybe a touch underrated I think. Very nice barleywine. Lots of fruit flavors and enough of the barrel to carry this very well. Something I would seek out again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little high for the style. Overall, It had a nice rich malty profile for the style and what was left of the American hop profile blended in pretty well. The barrel was a little more reserved than I would have preferred, but it added a little character to it. Pretty solid overall."
"O: I wish I could recall the vintage on this, a I remember thinking that this has held up really well. It may not be the best of the BA Barleywine bunch, but it's certainly upper middle class. And there ain't nothin' wrong with that."
""
"O: I think this beer is right at it's sweet spot and drinking quite nicely. If you've got some 2010's laying around pop them open! Now it's time to play the waiting game with the 2011 vintage."
"Pours a slightly murky red brown amber. Nice thick, long lasting off-white head with lacing. Nice presentation. Sweet malt, light fruit and oak aroma. Smells good. Sweet malt, dark and light fruit, bourbon and oak. Finishes sweet and oaky. Creamy body. An excellent barley wine."
"Overall, this is a decent bba barleywine that has decent flavors but i wish the barrel flavors shined a bit more. There is contribution but it deserves more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, citrus zest, vanilla, and bourbon. Taste is the same with a woody aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barleywine with a nice barrel aged presence."
"Full bodied but mysteriously refreshing, Old Bluechair delivers a wallop of malty-rich texture with a carbonated creamy effect. But the mid palate creeps in with a lightly peppery heat at mid palate that develops into alcohol heat to finish. Doing so with a hoppy resin dryness and ethanol warmth that closes the beer with confidence and semi-dry character that drives a malty fruit aftertaste."

"Drink- The entire reason I went to Hamiltons was because this was on the bottle list. I was not dissapointed with my choice. I had this right after the Blind Tiger grilled cheese. Very good time. Would love another bottle to share with some friends again."
""
""
""
"(O) - Different than most Barley Wines, but enjoyable. I had the 2009 vintage after more aging and it enjoyed it more than this one...give it some time to age. Barrel aging flavor isn't too dominant (a good thing in this case). A fun beer from Big Sky, showing they can produce a nice, BIG beer."
""

"On tap at Stone, though the abv on the beer menu clearly lists 8.75% ABV. Served in a snifter. Arrives a couldy deep dark amber color with ruby colored edges in the light. One finger beige head with good retention and lacing. The nose is earthy with hints of oak, dark fruit, roasted barley, and a leathery character. A touch of bourbon. The flavor starts with a raisin and fig fruitiness similar to the fruit found on the tongue. Hints of bourbon and vanilla. Mild bitterness. Medium bodied and finishes with a lingering taste of toasted oak. As it warms the vanilla and malt are more prevalent and overcome the strong boozy character. Overall, I found the beer to be a bit...harsh. Very complex though doesn't seem to be mellowed, yet."
"Overall: Probably should have opened this one 6-12 months ago but it hints at having been a great beer at some point."
""
""
"Overall I'm really glad I pulled this one from the cellar, it's a perfect complement to a cold winter evening. Cheers!"
""
""
"Solid BA barleywine. At least as good as that Blighs stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty much a must try for any barleywine fan. Decently priced, picked mine up for $13 I believe in AZ, saw it for the price in Bend, OR as well."
""
""
"Full bodied, chewy, smooth, and properly carbonated. Sweet aftertaste, and the alcohol is pretty well hidden for 10.50 %, but then again, I held onto this for a while before drinking it. I recommend trying this beer, if you get the chance."
""
""
" Medium body with soft carbonation up front with a strong barrel presence that's a bit harsh with lots of toasted oak and sweet booz. As it warms there is some vanilla and the sweeter malts and dark fruit notes shine. Leathery and musty with some sweet caramel and nut along with hints of fig, plum and apple. Â Decent but kind of harsh up front. Finishes nice."

"O - A nice offering, but not my favorite Big Sky brew. Recommended to Barleywine fans."
"(D)- A solid barleywine. Age could further help this out to its advantage, though it is quite nice. Rich, but a mellow/subtle barrel aging."
"(O) This was a different one. I really liked it, but it caught me off guard not tasting as I would expect a baleywine to taste. The barrel did wonders for the flavor. It was a solid beer and I look forward to revisiting this one in the future."
"thanks Adam for bringing this obscure gem my way, not sure what some time would do to this seeing how its already a mellow brew but I'd like to find out and I doubt I ever will"
"Ov- Drinks like a 10 yr old barleywine. great balance. Very hard to beat."
"brown in color with a light tan head on top that hung around for a good few minutes before settling down into a thin layer on top. One of the best aromas I have ever come across. Rich bourbon notes just rippling across the nose. Lots of toffee and vanilla, light touchs of oak and a piney hop presence as well. So immacualtly complex. Nothing subtle about this beast at all. Rich toffee and oak flavors are all over the place. Huge hop notes coming through with a nice alcohol hotness that is really well placed. A very tight flavor here with a long lingering vanilla flavor that lasted long after my last sip."
"2010 bottle. Pours an off colored orange with a small tannish head. Caramel malts, vanilla, oak, toffee waft off of the nose. The taste is like the nose with the vanilla from the bourbon melding very nicely with the caramel and toffee base beer flavors. Actual bourbon and oak are subdued. Sweet, but not excessively so from a slight hop balance. Mouthfeel is relatively large with a light carbonation. Seems right for the style. Overall, this beer is a really nice option for the BA Barleywine category as a fairly accessible and not too expensive option. Almost the definition of a B+ beer in my book."
"Pours a light yellowed orange. Light off-white head. Smells like caramel almost a toffee aroma. Very malty with some light vanilla and a touch of oak. Barrel isn't huge on the nose. Tastes sweet and malty, again lots of caramel, barrel characteristics are strong but not overwhelming. Well balances . Overall very enjoyable"
"Medium to thick, slightly syrupy mouthfeel and low carbonation. A very nice barrel-aged beer."
"Well balanced, though malt-heads and hop-heads alike may find something missing if they are glass-half-empty types."
"Overall - If this isn't infected, it's really not to my liking. There's the possibility that I got an infected bottle or that there is a good deal of bottle variation. Whatever I had, I didn't really care for it. I'll try the next vintage I can get my hands on to compare to this one (especially to see if there may have just been an infection in this bottle, but I don't think that's the case)."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer after a long hard day. It really reminded me of a less aggressive, yet still full-flavored Firestone Walker Abacus. Abacus is a more complex beer but also much more in your face. Each has its time and place and I was definitely more in the mood for this ""Abacus Lite"". Highly recommended and I will be seeking this out each year it becomes available."
"Beer is medium in body and sweet up front with a mildly dry finish, a nice bourbon character on the midpalate and a great finish with more in the body in the midpalate than expected. The toffee comes through nicely and finishes strong. I really enjoyed it, one of the better beers of the night IMO."
"Really a nice brew. Glad I got to try this one."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy Lunch for sending me this one in a past trade! Shared this one with a huge number of BAs during the ORF '11 release. 2010 Vintage! Bottle #1827 of 3000! Served from bottle into a sampler snifter. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The barrel aging on this brew really mellowed out a lot of the flavors that are typical in a big ABV Barleywine. This fact made this one really drinkable for all who had the chance to try it. The aroma was pretty good as well, but nothing awe-inspiring by any means. Definitely worth trying if you get the opportunity."
"750ml bottle thanks to Harrymel. Caramel color, decent but short head. Smells pretty good like caramel, malts. The taste is also quite nice, malt, toffee, caramel, and just a touch of barrel. I really liked how the barrel aging was very subdued and didn't make a bourbon bomb out of this one. Recommended if you like barleywines."
"Appears reddish brown with a creamy tan cap, recedes quickly but leaves plenty of lacing. Just a bit hazy. Smells predominantly of bourbon, sweet fruits, caramel malt, toffee and wood. Despite the powerful bourbon aroma, it does not seem hot. Taste matches the smell but there is much more balance. Caramel and toffee maltiness up front, alcohol soaked dark fruits in the middle, and barrel in the finish. The bourbon is very well integrated, adding flavor throughout and a subtle warmth to the finish. Medium-full body, low carbonation, very smooth texture at first but leaves a sticky residual feeling. Easy to drink but the strength is noticeable after a few sips."
"D - Awesome drink; great taste and smell; I love this stuff; don't pass it up if you have a chance to try a sip or two; goes down nice and smooth, I'll definitely have to try more beers from Big Sky, they impressed me with this batch"
"O: I have really enjoyed the barrel aged Big Sky beers I've had and this was no exception."
"O: Interesting flavor in this barleywine, not like anything i've had before. I would buy this again but probably special occasions, its a spendy one."
"Overall this is just a little 'off' for a typical barleywine."
"O - Ha! This beer was on my 'wants' for a long time, along with Ivan; glad I didn't trade for this one in particular."
"M/D: medium body, medium carbonation. Not hoppy, as barleywines go, on the sweeter side too. It's good, not syrupy like some, but nothing amazing. and at $16 a bottle, it's a one-time deal."
"2010 Vintage. Bottle 598/3000. Pours a cloudy, dark red color with brown hues. Has a large almost-tan colored head. Scent is initially whiskey with a lot of dark fruit, honey, and toffee. Strong malt aroma and hints of booze. Taste is initially sweet malt, quickly followed by toffee and delicious whiskey! Very nice dark fruit and caramel flavors mix well with vanilla and honey. Very nice tasting beer. Alcohol burn comes in at the end. Mouthfeel is full bodied and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is fairly high, as this is a delicious beer. Overall, I'm very impressed by this. I've been fortunate enough to score a bottle of Ivan and this all in a month's time."
"Overall, a nice beer - dense and appropriately rich. The barrel aging is nicely done, though the base beer may fall a hair short overall. Still, well-executed."
"Drinks too easy for the ABV & style"
"This works. This is good. This is Mmm + yum, plus, oh, yeah."
"This is my first experience with Big Sky Brewing Company, and it's been a good one. Olde Bluehair is a pretty impressive barrel-aged Barleywine. The flavor delivers and the subtle bourbon presence works extremely well. A little less carbonation would improve things a little. Maybe a bit of hops would too. I'm curious as to whether they're present in a fresh bottle. Perhaps another day. Easily recommended."
"D - This is a really good barleywine. Great balance and taste. My new favorite Big Sky brew....gotta find some Ivan now."
"I really like this brew and wish I had another one. Good stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is flat, a little watery. Due to too much alcohol in the flavor and unpleasant flatness, I have not enjoyed this much."
"Thanks, sholle, for the opportunity"
"d - A nice barleywine but a little harsh in the taste. Probably would be better with some age on it. Would like to have again with some time on it."
"If your looking for a hoppy barleywine (bigfoot) then this is not your beer. However, if your like me and appreciate a nice malty BW, this is a great example. I'm glad I bought a couple bottles because I think this beer will be an A+ in 1-2 years. I'll update this review when I open another bottle."
"D - Very quaffable, but not terribly exciting."
"Overall: I'm actually not a huge fan of Barleywines. But this one is good."
"Bottle. #2062 of 3000. Poured into a tulip glass a murky orange, apricot color with a light tan head. Sweet aroma in the nose of fruit and slight citrus hops. Very subtle aroma for a Barley Wine. Sweet start wtih some latent hops. Pretty smooth but not extremely flavorful. Nice head retention though."
"This beer needs some time alone."
"Poured a fizzy brass tinged medium brown,again a rather fizzy one finger off white head atop.Toasty oak and vanilla aromas with a bit of caramel,mainly all barrel aged aromas here,flavors are toasty with heavy vanilla and caramel,just a slight drying earthiness in the finish.As the beer warmed more malt nuances came into play like dark fruit and some cakiness.Its a bit sharp in the mouth but not to annoying,its pretty good but a little one dimensional with the barrel aging really taking over the beer.I dont think its worth the big price paid."
"Mouthfeel: Body is right on medium, with quite a bit of carbonation. As it warms the carbonation mellows out a little and it gets smoother drinking. It is very easy drinking for the style, even though ABV is 10.5% it seems like less. This is hands down my favorite example of a barleywine that I've had to date. I definitely want to have a couple of these on hand for a while to see what age does."
"In my humble opinion, Big Sky is one of America's most underappreciated breweries. They have gotten more of my money (thanks to their outstanding IPA) than anyone else in this country over the past several years. Barrel Aged Olde Bluehair Barley Wine may not be transcent beer, but it's a delicous and drinkable effort that is well worth the purchase price."
"D: Awesome, Love this one."
"Great beer name. Snifter pour and an amber colored ale with burgundy streaks is produced with a small off-white foamy head. Aroma consists of hoppy goodness with some candy and malt in the mix. Very hoppy taste for a 2008 and though it lists the IBU's at 75 this tastes much more hoppy than that. Maybe the age intensifies it. Hmmmm. Malty backbone blends the two tastes perfectly. Full bodied, chewy mouthfeel. 11.8%? Couldn't even tell it was this high. Smooth drink and highly recommended. Wish it was distributed nation-wide. If you find it, let it age some to really get the most out of it."
"The beer poured a clear copper with nice fine carbonation bubbles. Aroma was typical of a barley wine but very muted and mellow. Time has done wonderful things to this beer, it is very nicely balanced bitterness and malt wise. The malt is not forward at all and tapers off towards the end. There is also a dark fruit / plum flavor present. Reasonable carbonation with small bubbles cleanses your palate as you drink it. I definitely went back for seconds on this one."
"Poured a deep amber color with a small dirty white head, not much carbonation going on.  Nose is faint but I did find some dried fruits, brown sugar, oak, bourbon and caramel.Taste is dried fruits, vanilla, oak, bourbon, dried fruits, brown sugar. There was an off, astringent like taste, ABV is very tolerable keeping iot very drinkable and not masking the flavors. Mouthfeel is nice creamy, coating and sugary."
"This is an excellent barleywine with an understated bourbon presence which really leads to a very drinkable barrel-aged brew."
"D-At 8.75% could this be deemed ""light"" for a barleywine? Well, no matter it is packed full of tasty flavours and an outstanding smoothness. I could enjoy this one all night long beside the fire!"
"D: Entirely too easy to drink, this goes down dangerously easy. Excellent flavors and a nice balance of oak, whiskey, and malt. This is a very well made beer and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. If I get the chance to try this again I definitely will. Highly recommended."
"A little dissapointing overall but definatley not bad. Just really plain and forgetable."
"Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down. A pretty enjoyable BA barleywine. Thanks Preric!"
"I liked it - a rare treat!"
"This is a well balanced, more-ish barleywine. Nice woodiness and vanilla from the barrels, very faint hints of bourbon, still a faint hop bite in the finish, raisins, plums, candied sugar, caramel, light alcohol burn in the finish as well. The only downfall on this one is the body which is a little light, almost watery, for a barleywine. Makes it more drinkable perhaps but you might want a little more bulk to brink out some of the flavors. As is, pretty drinkable - don't worry about opening the bottle by yourself!"
"D: A decent drinker."
"D - The alcohol isn't all that well hidden - I thought this was more than 8.75%. The tannic bite in the finish also makes it a little hard to drink a lot."
"Pours clear deep copper with thin tan head. The modest aroma has notes of prunes, figs and sweet crystal malts. The taste starts rich and sweet with malt, fig raisin and plum sweetness. Midway and to the finish alcohol chemical notes show up along with a layer of pine hop bitterness. Could use some more age to mellow a bit. It does have a mildly drying malt roastiness into the finish."
"D- Not as good as the Schlafly Oak Aged BW but well worth drinking, especially if you can find it."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice amber color, very nice carbonation, this brew has probably the nicest head from a BWSA to date for me, huge two-finger plus creamy, thick light tan head, with tons of thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hop, slightly fruity (figs, plums, raisins), oaky. The taste is awesome, malty, with some hop notes, very nice touch of dark fruits and oak/bourbon. Medium body, goes down pretty smooth, ABV hidden very well (which is not high), but easy drinking. Very drinkable, really enjoying this one today, highly recommended."
"Medium bodied with a high level of carbonation which I liked. The mouthfeel is creamy."
"d: I'm very sorry to see the empty bottle. Thanks to JohnGalt1 for an excellent surprise barleywine. I'd never heard of this until I saw it in the box. Thanks again Toby!"
"Very good beer. Hopefully Big Sky continues to have some wild adolescent fantasties like this to complement their solid lineup of regular beers."
"A pleasant suprise for sure, I liked the integration between the barrel notes and regular Barleywine flavors in this. While still a bit warm and a steady sipper, I'd love to see how this one would mellow and age over a couple of years."
"Overall, this was a very boozy barlywine. Way different from the previous two I had, which were very hoppy. If you can find this, it is worth a shot, but have some good buddies to share it with."
"Somwhat easy to drink, although the taste of the alcohol might get a bit overwhelming if a lot has been drank. Overall a very good beer, worth the $$ for the experience."
"Overall this is a solid barrel-aged barleywine, though it's a bit short of spectacular. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Barleywine Style Ale category as it is very malt dominated. Try some if you see some!"
"The appearance on this naturally carbonated beauty is great. Large, frothy long lasting head that forms fun shapes. Deep amber color. Nose is light, but shows trace amounts of whiskey, wood and malt. Flavor is heavily sweet, rich, deeply malty, with notes of caramel and toffee. A touch of vanilla and graham from the wood. A lot to like here. Could have more depth and concentration, but is nicely balanced for the style, rich and even has a nice finish. The bottle conditioning makes the difference."
"4/24/09 Update: Had this on tap at Monk's Kettle, and it was much better than the bottled version. None of the cheese, and it was well-carbonated. I'd give it a 4.3 overall on tap."
"Good beer that I can see getting a whole lot better with some age.. seems slightly rough around the edges, but not bad at all.. in fact it is very nice and very drinkable right now."
