"O:  A nice barleywine.  I will try to grab some more when I see them."
"Strong yet smooth.  Very unique taste.  Sweet.  Easy to drink."
""
""
"One of the best barley wines I have tasted in a while. Me and my friend always ask for it when we go to a store together. Plus, my buddy loves the high ABV barley wines so this one does the trick at 15%. Very tasty, not too malty as some barley wines tend to be."
""
"This is the 2013 version, can't find a bottle date but about a year and a half of age to it. The smell is incredible. Can hardly taste the 15 percent alcohol but it hits you pretty fast and hard. The aging has done wonders to this beer. Definitely a sipper."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers Ben!!! Unique, sweet fruity, some citrus. Great stuff."
""
""
""
"Unique.  Super strong!  Very flavorful, with a syrup-like thick consistency.  Its flavors linger in the mouth long after swallowing.  Beautiful orangey-copper in the glass, with virtually no head, but a satisfying carbonation."
""
""
""
"Taste - strong tongue burn on first sip. Sweet malt, grape must, wine-like burn on the back end. Def boozy. I can def taste that 15%."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer but definitely one that would improve with age.  Unfortunately I was only able to track down one bottle."
""
""
""
"Glass- Snifter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Fairfax alehouse poured into snifter. Copper body with thin bone head that quickly collapses to nothing. Aroma is butter, alcohol, candied fruit especially orange, and toffee. Flavor is apples and pears, dried dark fruit, orange, buttery, spicy alcohol note on the swallow. Full body, thick viscous texture, light carbonation, boozy finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"It is a very high alcohol beer, but it does not have the high alcohol taste that so many do.  I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"F: Medium body with just the right amount of carbonation."
"To be fair, this beer was a beast and one bottle would be enough for a sitting even though I could have easily cracked open another. It did not feel like 15% ABV but there was enough here to bowl me over in more than one way. Possibly the best offering outside of the 120 for Dogfish and grand enough to turn me on to the style - if you've never had something of this sort before, this would be an excellent choice to start with. Quite lovely from start to finish!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very leggy, and the fig/date/raisiny qualities really make this one shine."
"15% is unbelievable. DFH nailed the balance on this barely wine"
""
"High octane and complex with rich flavors.  Thinking of how this one would age!"
"Would like to age a bottle and revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes strong and delicious."
""
""
"O - Strong barleywines are fairly new to me. This is a good beer that I would like to have again. Like to age it and see what flavors come out when the alcohol dies down."
"Best barleywine . Have twoaging for better tatse"
"Pours a rich hazy amber. Certainly smells of figs and dates - tastes like it too. A little more than you'd expect from a barleywine. Not my favorite, but very good nonetheless. At over 15%, it's quite enjoyable, although it may not be for everyone."
""
""
"This one doesn't hide it's alcohol. Needs cellaring."
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this fresh, but you can tell it will be great with a few years on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a great beer. Will definitely probably get again, some time in the future. The only downside is it's fairly pricey--$17 for a 4-pack."

"Overall, this is an incredibly strong and complex beer. It really reminds me of DFH Raison d'Extra, except with less offense and aggressive flavors. I really want to take the advice of the label and bury this in my yard for 2 years, but I guess my cellar works fine as well."
"Overall a fantastic barelywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good barleywine, and the addition of figs and dates is a nice touch. Would love to see how it ages, but for now, it's a nice one to sip on a winter evening."
""
""
""
""
"The first taste is first alcohol heavy with a gentle warming of my mouth, and throat upon swallowing. The feel is heavy and slightly syrupy. After the alcohol there is a presence of richer fruits like raisin and fig, some apple. This is definitely a sipper. I like it though, and have put some bottles in the cellar to rest. Cheers!"
"Overall- This beer is very hot right now, but still very enjoyable. Alcohol almost creates a sourness in the fruit flavors, but the underlying malts and fruits blend perfectly together. Sugary sweet and syrupy, with lovely apples, figs, dates, raisins fermenting in it all. An obvious sipper, but lovely."
""
""
"Currently mine is cellaring and my review reflects the 2013 version consumed fresh."
"Gonna have to let this age and retry to see if it mellows out a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
"I almost feel like this beer was a big young. I will try this again, next time fr a bottle with a date."
""
""
"This is a good beer"
"too much booze. figs and dates are cool tho"
""
""
""
""
""
"I like DFH, I like barley wines and I like big beers...so this should have been a slam dunk...but this was a miss for me.  Nose is pure booze, up front the taste is all booze...i think there were some yummy flavors in there somewhere, but totally overpowered.   I bought 4 and drank 1 so I'll see how the others do in the cellar for a couple of years."
""
"O: As with all of DFH's Caution Cap series, this is just a crazy strong, blown-up take on the style. Not the best barleywine on the market, but it's an absolute blast to drink. At 15%, it is not for the weak.... but if you like a brew that challenges you, this is totally worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wanted to try one fresh, but maybe I shouldn't have tried it quite this fresh.  It's very hot, dates and figs are washed out from the alcohol.  I won't touch the remaining bottles for at least 1 year.  I hope it cleans up with age.  Prost!"
""
"Having fresh - super hot.  Needs at least a year or 2"
""
""
"O - I'll be honest, never drank a 15% before, but the initial smell and some of the notes were off to me.  Have to assume this is new, but I have no idea. Will try it again in 12 months to see if it evens out."
""
""
""
""
"I could drink this all day. We'll maybe until I fell down! Smooth, smooth, smooth. Hard to believe at 15% ABV. Wonderful, unique flavor. Not perfect or my favorite style, but very, very close."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from Tipples. Pours orange with a small off white head. Aroma of booze, sweet caramel, figs, fruits. Big and sweet. Flavor is also huge sweetness, fruit flavors, honey and caramel, booze, and a little more booze. Heavy bodied, medium carbonation, hot on the throat. This was decent enough I guess. Wouldn’t pay the $5 or $6 again for a bottle again though."
""
""
""
"O: good brew, a sipper at 15%, maybe letting it age will take some of the alcohol heat bite off."
""
"Light reddish orange body. Medium fast dissipating head. Has that dogfish head smell. Fruity fig aroma. Very fruity tasting for a barleywine."
""
"Dense orange color.  Half finger head on the pour with pour retention and minimal lacing when poured into snifter glass as recommended on the bottle.  Super dense, rich, malty aroma with nice dark fruits mingled within.  Did I mention boozy in the nose? Wow!  The flavor is intense.  Heavy malt character hits right away with a maple syrup-soaked biscuit quality. Intensely sweet dark fruits hit mid drink.  Figs and dates, of course.  Hops are mild, even at 85 IBU, underneath the malt fortress.  Hops are earthy with a pine-like, herbal tone.  Medicinal quality in the finish, almost like Nyquil and probably a result of the alcohol.  Dense, syrupy body.  About as thick as beer can get, I think.  Very different.  Would serve well as a winter warmer.  Will try to cellar and compare.  Drink with the utmost care and respect.  Take small sips!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't see why this gets so much hate. I absolutely love the taste of this beer. I think the upfront burn is what makes it so great. I'll be cellaring the other 3 to see how this one develops!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this is one of the better barley wines. I haven't had many, but this one is close to the top of the list."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very good overall; like the abv and smoothness."
""
""
"2014 smoothest bw I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I didn't care much for this one and I don't really get all the high ratings for it. It seems like another beer Dogfish Head wants you to age before you drink but my belief is a beer should be good fresh first and if it gets better with some age well that is a bonus. Would like to try this with some age but I really don't think I'll be buying another bottle anytime soon."

"O: this beer floors me for 15% I remember having it on tap a year ago and thinking this is great. The bottle version had done nothing to change that opinion.   It has tastes for days and the booze for being 15% is well hidden."
"Still somewhat hot (though not all that unexpected for a 15% beer), the flavor was quite mellow (hmm... maybe mellow isn't quite the right word...) and malt-forward. The hops were there but not over-powering at all. All around, a very solid beer."
""
"For an American barleywine I wasn't slammed with hops, which isn't a bad thing.  Definitely picked up some of the fruit on the finish quickly followed by a nice alcohol warmth.  I haven't had a ton of barleywines but this is already a favorite. I'm thinking ill pick up a couple to age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The bold body accented with a semi-fruity flavor gave this beer a great overall profile.  I personally found the aftertaste to be similar to that of honey...I love honey."

"A superb barley wine that has aged excellently. There is some oxidation late mid-palate that manifests as a metallic twang but it does not take away from the beer."
""
""
""
"At Hops in the Hills this summer, I had the first pour off a fresh keg. WOW. I usually age these bottles but that fresh one was just off the charts of incredible."
""
""
"Vintage 2012. A honey colored hue on the pour, no head. Aroma is of sweet caramel vanilla woodsy essence, very fruity and yeast, some sweet alcohol esters as well. Taste is sweet caramel, honey and vanilla undertones, fruity, yeast and mild spiced hops, some dark intermingled fruit figs and dates. Palate is full flavored, creamy, smooth and nicely balanced wit good carbonation. The finish is a cornucopia of the aforementioned flavors and aromas, leaves a slight tongue numbing feeling from the alcohol, although it is well behaved. Aging seems to have mellowed it out, which I find enjoyable. Leaves a nice satisfyingly warm feeling. Overall a very good smooth and enjoyable brew."

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2010A. Pours hazy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, light herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of big fruitiness and dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruitiness and dark/bready malt sweetness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barleywine style! All around great complexity and balance of fruitiness and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall, a good enough beer, but one that clearly needs some age to be enjoyable. I'd heard this one was hot if you drink it fresh, and based on my experience at six months, I'd have a hard time disagreeing. I wish I had another bottle to sit on a bit longer and see how it was drinking after a year, but for the time being, it's a decent beer. I'd also change the classification, only because the figs add a sweetness that reminded me more of the English style than the super hoppy, bitter American style."

"Old School ale has a good appearance in a glass and a nice white head. With the smell there's alot going on with the figs and dates. The taste is just too much, and by that I mean it's way bitter. Definitely only 1 a night beer. The abv is 15% wich is overboard and you can definitely taste that. I am curious what this beer would taste like aged for a couple years and I think that's all it's got going for it. Not a total disappointment, just another one for the craft collection."
""
""
""

"O- A big, gargantuan Barleywine that benefits vastly from extended aging. Huge flavor, but very sweet."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor lingers the sides of the tongue and leaves pleasant hints of fruit after the alcohol bite fades."
""
""
"O: Overall I found the beer a bit hard to drink because of the very awkward nose. It has a wonderful appearance and mouthfeel, however the taste is quite bland for a Barleywine of any type, but especially for one that boasts ""figs and dates"" on the label. A lone date has more flavor and complexity than this beer. I rated the flavor as ""okay"" because it's a decent tasting high alcohol beer; just not one I would boast about. I won't be buying the beer again."

"This folds the envelope for American barleywines, and becomes a liqueur-like fruit concoction with its high emphasis on the fruits and sweet aspects of the malts. I usually do not like American barleywines as much, but this highly resembles its English counterpart with its extra sweet, fruity malt profile. If they could somehow throw this in some kind of barrel (I'm thinking rye whiskey or Sherry), this would only further reveal its obvious liqueur leaning qualities. Cheers to DFH for experimenting as always, although maybe they should consider packaging some of these strong beers in 6oz bottles for practical purposes."

"I'm happy overall with my 5 year aging experiment on this one. I remember it being very hot fresh, and though it may have toned down a bit, it still lets you know that its 15% ABV with each sip."

"Final Thoughts: Olde School has reminded me of why I like the barleywine style in the first place, huge flavor and delicate balance. I was nearly turned off of the style after initially enjoying it because of the many poorly made brews out there. Make no mistake, DFH brews the real deal. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"If you're in the mood for a massive, sweet, yet somehow easy drinking (relatively) barleywine than you could do a lot worse than Olde School. I can't say I drink very much Dogfish Head beer but Olde School is one I will pick up in the future. This is a beer you could sit on for years with no poor outcome."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: amazing flavors. and unbelievable drinkability for 15%. very different from the other barleywines today but very true to the style. wonderfully brewed beer and easily a top barleywine."

"This beer is pretty good. Not as smooth or drinkable as other barleywines I've had. I can really taste the alcohol, those saying it has no carbonation are right on the money. Real boozy, dark fruit taste. Perhaps not my thing but I can see how it is quality and how snobs would like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2010 bottle share at Proof. Poured amber brown with almost no head. Aroma is a warm, sweet malty bomb, with a slight hint of dark fruit. Taste is somehow sweet citrus, earthy, and a touch of that dark fruit. Kinda boozey. Medium body, almost no carbonation. Great beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A lot going on in this beer especially at cellar temperature. There is so much to enjoy with each taste. It is a great example of the style. If there is any less desirable trait to this brew, it would be a touch too much of the figs. It coats the mouth a bit in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this beer to barleywine lovers and I will be getting more!"
""
"O- I enjoyed this one with all it's different flavors and I didn't realize it was 15% until I looked at the bottle, defiantly keeping one to try next year"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a year on this brew hasn't yet toned down the alcohol and booze on this brew. Flavors are still strong, but this needs time to mellow, perhaps 2-3 years."

"Serving type: bottle"

"The beer pours a light and creamy white head that dissipates quickly. The beer is a deep ruby red that is clear. The beer has a fairly sweet and fruity smell with a hint of alcohol. some hints of dark fruits but sweet malts are the primary smell with a slight hints of hops. The taste is somewhat similar to the smell. Sweet malts dominate the palates with dark fruits and a hint of hops as well as a bit of alcohol as well. The feel is fairly syrupy but still pretty good and smooth. The beer is heavy bodied but still feels lighter than most other barleywine. Overall, a decent barleywince and worth buying at least once."
""
""
""
"O- not bad for what it is. I am a big fan of barley wines, and I've had better but this is still a pretty good beer. A little too much alcohol but hey it's dogfish head, what do you expect. Probably would go nice with a cigar, and some age on it."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall- this is a great cold night beer, warming and scotch-like sure to warm your bones"
""
""
"Bottled in 2010. Amber orange in color with a thick, viscous look. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to thin wisps. Dark fruit, sweet sugary malt and toffee aromas are prominent with butter and boozy notes at the back end. A quick rush of carbonation up front followed by a smooth slightly oily feel through the middle and tangy, boozy heat at the end. Dark fruit flavors up front with toffee flavors added through the middle. Tangy bite in the middle leads candied orange and chardonnay-like pear flavors. Finishes dryly with a tangy, slightly tart fruitiness along with undeniable, but mellow boozy heat."
"Overall this is a solid barleywine with a fig and date compliment that really works out. As the label suggests, a beer that will develop quite well overtime. Great sipping beer as the season gets colder."

"Overall: This was complex to say the least, but I enjoyed the mix of flavors. The alcohol wasn't hidden but it didn't over power. This was the nail in the coffin to a long evening, so next time I try this I might have it as the starter so I'm not completely wrecked the next day."
""
""
""

""
""
"Having had my first Olde School (which was a 2012 bottle) about two weeks ago I was eager to try it fresh for comparison. Suffice it to say I learned the importance on patience with this one. It's quite good and worth trying when fresh but it's worlds better with some age on it. A good barleywine that truly becomes great as it ages. Aguably my favorite from Dogfish Head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It has the general profile of an English-style barleywine...but the bigness and brute force of a 'Merican one. Having said that, this is one of DFH's better offerings, and obviously a great aging candidate. Even fresh, the booze is hidden relatively well. Relatively. If I ever buy this again, down in the ground they go."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this beer is pretty in your face. There's just something about it that I can't put my finger on that throws it off just a bit. Anyway, it is a must try!"
"Overall: I can't help but think about how this one will age, but I will snap out of that mindset. I really liked this one a lot for what it is today. It drinks like an english barleywine, even though it has the spirit of the american brewing revolution."
""
""
""
"Overall: Really interesting and enjoyable barleywine. While the alcohol is perceptible, I am amazed at how easy 15% goes down. Glad to have found this one, and glad to have picked up one to age a bit."
"Overall: This is incredibly well balanced for being 15% abv. A nice sipper for sure. It is a little hot for being about 3 weeks old. Maybe some aging could do some good. Maybe some aging in some Merlot barrels could do this really good. Other than that, this brew is worthy!"

"Rating to style, I have less experience with barleywine than I do with a lot of others but I know a good beer when it's sitting right in front of me. This is a good beer. Not overly complex, yet it still exceeded my expectations. At 15% ABV, I'm sure any aspects of this beer that you don't enjoy will soon be forgiven. All in all this is my favorite offering from Dogfish Head thus far."
"O - It's definitely a sipper, but one that I enjoyed very much. Surprisingly easy to drink, even at 15% ABV. A year in the cellar was perfect for this beer too, in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An homage to times past? Not sure what happened here, but it's hot and sweet and ultimately lacks some of the more complex malts I like to see in the style. It's not awful, but it's not really on my list for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have drained the glass imparts a very pleasant bouquet. I will select Olde School over any beer I have ever tasted. I bought 4 4-packs last fall and have aged them for 10 months, with the intention of bringing them out infrequently to see the changes with age. They are so awesome tasting that after bringing out a couple, I have quickly brought out the rest and now have only 2 left. When they come out this fall, I will buy up all I can find so I can follow through on my original plan to bring out some at various intervals to enjoy the benefits of aging."
"Overall I enjoy it; big flavors, albeit not super-complex. A good find for big beer lovers; almost definitely better with age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The age took way some of its punch, but even after two years in the cellar this is still quite boozy. It drinks like a cordial rather than a beer, and a potent cordial at that. An 'extreme beer' in that it is very high in abv, but really it's rather one-dimensional and alcohol-driven. But I suppose if you like big beers, that one dimension is pretty good."
""

"this is a massive barleywine. 2011 vintage here, and I am thinking I should have given it another year or even two to cool out a bit more. this beast is hot! pours a dense amber color with a lot of yeast floating around like fish food, and a prominent off white head over an inch tall but not lasting a real long time. the nose is very alcoholic, predictably so, but there is also some interesting things going on here besides the malt. I pick up a lot of Mediterranean fruit notes, like figs, dates, and drying apples. it is sweet in taste, but not cloyingly so like many colossal barleywines. the dried fruits come through nicely, adding complexity to a huge grain bill and a lot of brown sugar sweetness. the alcohol cuts through everything, and when this beer warms up, it feels like liquor. the yeast adds a lot, and is obviously fairly sturdy, with some white toast sort of elements. decent carbonation really for what this is, and a predictably large body. this is a slow sipper, and even a twelve ounce bottle was a little more than I wanted, so maybe share this with a friend or a lover. I probably should have waited until fall to open this one, but curiosity got the best of me on a warm early summer afternoon. an excellent example of the style, in many ways more enjoyable than say a bolt cutter, with all the fruit happening in this. good effort."

"overall - enjoyable BW to sip slowly and enjoy it warming up I had a 2012 fresh last year and it's similar to what I remember. Still haven't had one of these aged yet, can't wait to see how it ages."

"The barleywine that all should be compared to in my opinion. Poors a nice reddish/copper color. Can really smell the fruit (dates/figs) and initial taste can be slightly harsh but smooths out after a few sips. I have been drinking these for about 6 years and upset that this will actually be the first year I'm making myself age them. Will followup on smell/alcohol/taste next year."

"Olde School was a light orange color with a modest white head. It left some lacing on the sides of the glass. In the aroma, I discovered malt and a mild level of hops. There was nothing about the aroma which was overwhelming. In the initial taste, I detected notes of raisin, fig, mild maltiness, and a respectable level of nuttiness. For an American Barleywine, I expected more hops to be in the front. Yet at the same time, I was not disappointed when I discovered with was not a hop-bomb. It reminded me of an English Barleywine. The high level ABV left a warming sensation with the nuttiness progressing toward sour in the finish. This beer makes a great night cap on a cold winter night. In recent memory, this is one of my favorite Dogfish Head efforts."
""
""
""
"Overall – This is a very tasty and sweet with a very well hidden alcohol taste (at least for a 15 % abv brew). A very nice and quite easy drinking for a barley wine. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
"O- I really liked this Barleywine. Its massive and syrupy. I bet it will age incredibly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Intense and BOLD BOLD BOLD BOLD. Just like I remember 120 minute and World Wide stout being,. Much more alcoholic than I anticipated but at the same time, now that I think about it, that was really rather foolish of me. I'm really not surprised. I would love love love! to see how this ages. Overall, it's a real asskicker!"
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – A very nice barleywine; very drinkable for 15%."
"Overall: This beer has aged extremely well and I'm sorry to see it go. It was my last one."

"This is very sippable and one of the better offerings from the weirder and weirder Dogfish Head. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Grapevine Liquors in Denver, which is a nice package size for having a snifter or two."

"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, dry texture, alcohol warming, and a dry finish."
""
"O - Certainly recommend some aging. At current state it has a great base. Some mellowing would do wonders."
""
""
"Overall - After the first couple of sips, I thought I might dump it. Now I think I'll get through at least half of it before deciding I don't need any more alcohol tonight."
""
"Very thick mouthfeel, and I only get a bit of the booziness with the high abv. I really like this more than I thought I would. It's a different take on a barelywine, but not totally in a different mold. I definitely recommend it."
""
""
""
"O: This one was interesting, and interesting is not always a good thing. Im probably giving it the benefit of the doubt with my ratings, but I do give it some bonus points for being a big boozy beer. Its not necessarily bad, and for a 15% barleywine the price is great, but its not something I would probably drink again. Maybe Ill grab one or two to sit on for a number of years and see if it gets better. As is, its a pass (unless you are trying to get drunk cheaply)."
""
"A big, bad barleywine that is a little rough around the edges. Broad and complex, with layers of flavor. The booze is a little intrusive."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I am taking my time with this bad boy. Very nice complements all around with the flavors."
""

"	Overall Impression: wow, I really like this beer; I have to be careful, at 15% this will kick your butt; very smooth and drinkable, as soon as I swallow I want another taste; sip on this guy all night with a great book and you’ll be just fine; it’s just a darn good beer; I really cannot wait to see what a year or 2 does to this guy…if I can resist that long; did I mention that I really like this…just a great brew that blew my mind; I will probably look for this every time it comes out...it is not fair, it just gets better with every sip!"

"D: for how fresh this is im really enjoying it. I expected even more of a hot mess like some of DFH other big bodied brews. however everything seems to work nicely here and gives me something to look forward to for the bottle in my cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very interesting Barleywine. I did not expect the intense citrusy hop character. The malt character is pretty decent. It's sweet but not cloying. There are hints of candy sugar and vanilla throughout. The alcohol is well hidden for 15%. This is a decent beer that is worth trying but for me I would prefer either a more malt forward beer or a less citrusy hop character."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not much complexity on the nose. Flavor is really good and surprisingly mellow."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A really nice barleywine. It took 4 years in stride, and could probably even take another 2 to reach peak condition. Nice profile, nice integration, and great mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a robust beer to say the least and I really like what DFH has done with it. So much character and yet quite drinkable. It actually reminds of D’Extra just a touch."
""
""
"Overall: Would I buy it again, honestly I would have to think about it...depends in the mood that I am in. Barleywines are everywhere and there are some that are easier to find than this one. I would buy it because of it's strong ABV level and that's pretty much it. I am not knocking it everyone should try it, rarely you get a something as unique as this. Salud!"
""
"Highly recommended. I anxious to see how this brew does with ~5years behind it.. More to come. Nice work DFH!!!"
""
"O. Amazing how this brew is 15%. It is hidden quite nicely which can be dangerous. This is worth a try for sure, but It doesnt knock your sox off like other DFH beers."
""
"O: an interesting and solid barleywine from dogfish head, but certainly not exceptional. It's too sweet in my opinion, I prefer both English and American styles, but the balance on this is not on point. I'm not complaining about the alcohol heat, it's 15%. I'd like to revist this in a bottle with a year or two on it"
"Well, this was my first go-around with DfH's Olde School, but it certainly won't be my last. While the price and abv will certainly keep this out of the regular line-up for me, this is a great brew to pick up once in a while when I want a big, bold barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very true to the style. A great sipper packed with tons of flavor. This beer would definitely benefit from some aging to tame the heat a bit."
""
"looks nicely carbonated for a barley wine, got a half inch of head though it quickly diminished. a nice clean reddish brown pour. smells of grapes, tea leaves, vanilla, caramel, heavy booze scent. the flavor is very sweet up front with a slight bitterness in the finish. malt heavy sugary sweet with a banana like overtone, and a wooden oak flavor in the finish. full body, moderately carbonated.. very syrupy, very heavy on the booze (nice instant chest warming).. overall, a very nice barleywine and one hell of a sipper. for being 15% abv, you can't tell that much - i've had 9% beers that were way more overwhelming with the alcohol taste than this one. glad i finally got myself some of this one, it's been impossible to find for the previous years."
""
""
""
"Pretty good American barleywine from DFH. Certainly not anything groundbreaking here, but at 15$ a 4-pack, it's certainly not a bad choice."
""
"I'm most impressed with Dogfish Head on this'un. And, to think, it's the first time around for me on this one (AND, I have a four-pack from last year saved... further reviews to come!)"
"O-A solid barleywine, not a messy overly sweetened hop bomb that I have come to expect of the style. Fairly smooth flavors for being such a young beer, but I definitely aging will serve this beer well."
""
""
"O- Complex. But that's barleywines. I think it may be a little too strong, but if I'm patient enough, I'll let one of these age and try to review it again. Right now, though, I think it is still quality, and best enjoyed after a long, exhausting day."
""
""
""
""
"O- sweet and boozey barleywine, at 15% you'd have to expect it. Well rounded beer complex on all fronts, big sweet rasins, and dark fruits really shine through, I would assume these will come together a bit more with some age"
""
""
""
"O: I love Dogfish Head products and barleywines, but I would have to rate this as fairly average - it had nothing to set it apart from the rest, nor to elevate it above them, but it was, of course, a very enjoyable barleywine, and of course I'd buy it again."
""
""
"O: this is a good sweet barley wine, that will defiantly warm you right up... Could see this aging very well like the label suggest, guess its time to go dig a 2x2 3 foot deep hole."
"Cheers!"
""
""
"o - overall, are you sure this isn't a BSDA? has all the makings of a classic one. either way, i like it. not the best beer i've ever had, but definitely an enjoyable beer that i will look for more of and that i'm glad i got a 4 pack instead of a single. interested to see what time does. winner fresh."
""
"Had a bottle of 2011. A least that attempt at cellaring  went well. Does now seem like an English barleywine more sweet fruit, a bit of vanilla and not so much hop."

"Bottled On 11/21/2008"
"Overall: FANTASTIC! Like I said, Don't drink unless you set it asside for a year or more."
""
""
""
""
""
"October 2011 bottle (bought). About 1 year from purchase to taste. I only aged it because it told me to. And believe me, it was worth it. Everyone LOVED it. Nice pungent aroma as soon as it was poured. Like a red wine. Not what I was expecting, even though it is a barleyWINE. As I tasted it and let it sit, the more complex the taste and aromas became. It took on more of a red wine character. With the complexity of this one, I really should have reviewed it on the spot. But, unfortunately, it'll be at least a year before I can get another 1 year old Olde School. But, nonetheless, it is one more reason to but and age another 4 pack... or 4 cases for that matter."
""
"This beer is a dark caramel red-brown color with a just off white head. About 2 cm which recedes to a film shortly. Spotty lacing. Aroma is caramel, molasses, burnt sugar and fruit forward. A bit of heat, but very nice. Unfortunately this beer really doesn't deliver. Acetone, burnt sugar, heat, solventy, and figs. Sweet and solvents are the two words I would use to describe this beer. Mouthfeel is somehow worse. Thin, hot, mid level carbonation. If it was going to be that thin it needs to be less carbonated, and it needed a lot more body. Really not a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and dry on the tongue. I enjoy barleywines and high abv beers but this one falls towards the bottom for me - even after 2 years this is still hot as hell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Like the other DFH neon caps, this one is damn sweet and not shy about the booze on the palate. I think I picked the wrong month to drink this, as it would be perfect for a cold winter night. It isn't the best BW I have had, but it isn't bad. I usually don't like overly sweet beers, but I recommend trying this one if you can find it."
""
""
""
"One of the better barleywines (and Dogfish Head brews…) I've had in a while. A year of age on the bottle seems about perfect, with no glaring oxidation. (4.5)"
""
"when i poured this beer, it has a nice dark copper body with a small cream color head that lays down quiclky to a thin sticky lace around the body. The aroma is tart of dark fruits, like figs, raisins. The taste is sweet and strong of dark fruit and booze. The mouth feel is very thick on the tongue. Overall this isn't my kind of style but i think with age it might cool down a little bit and not be so hot."
"As it turns out, this is perhaps the most palatable Dogfish Head high alcohol sugar bomb, at least as it's aged thus far. Aside from the tarnishing oxidation, there are lot of quite good qualities in this dense critter of a barleywine. I'll be looking forward to drinking my last bottle somewhere else down the line. Man, I love Flanagan's Song."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not a great barelywine. It's a nice dessert sipper with some nice flavor notes. But it's lacking a certain depth or complexity. This is a pretty good beer."
"The pour is a slightly cloudy amber color with a finger of off-white head. Pretty brutal aroma. A bit of rubber cement and rubbing alcohol. There’s a little bit of candied citrus in there and some caramel. The flavor isn’t quite as brutal as the aroma...at first anyway. Lots of booze, some rubbing alcohol, and more booze. Caramel and citrus flavors are also present, but they give way to the less desirable ones as it warms."

"Over all a very nice barleywine, it soothes what troubles you, enjoy with caution."

""
""
"Taste is of woody cedar hops and apricot. A bit of vanilla boozey oak as well. This is so much more mellow aged, and absolutely fantastic. So privileged to have tried. Age your olde school!!"
""
""
""
"O - If you want a big, sweet beer, this one is for you. It is a big beer, but aging seems to be a must on this one if you don't want it to be a big, hot punch when you drink it. I like what aging has done to this one. Cheers!"
""
"This is a solid and unique barleywine and about what I expected from DFH."

"originally reviewed: 11-22-2010"

""
""
"For the abv it is pretty amazingly hidden. I'm going extra .5 point for that. Wild have guessed 11. 15 wow"
"O - Definitely complex, but I would like to see how this ages, but overall kind of a hot mess right now. A lot of qualities have this resembling a liquor almost as much as a beer. Glad I tried it, but nothing I would seek out again."
""
""
""
""
"O- Olde School challenges the very definition of beer and is another amazing offering from DH. Undoubtedly the most unique barleywine I have ever sampled, this is an intense beer not only due to the high ABV, but also because of the complexity in both aroma and flavor. This a remarkable sipping experience and one that you cannot rush. (Note: It took me over 1-1/2 hours to consume a 12oz bottle)"
"Overall: Great barleywine in my opinion because it isn't too sweet for me. I love the hoppy finish. Typical Dogfish beer."

"Lightly boozy in the taste, but I wouldn't have guessed it to be anywhere near 15% ABV. A unique and enjoyable barleywine, but not close to the top tier in the flavor category."
""
"Pours to rich but thin head and minimal lace. Aroma isclover honey and vanilla. Flavor is a mix of bubblegum, apples, pears and sweet malt. Alcoholic finish. Mouthfeel features a nice alcohol burn and low co2am overall a drinkable, complex and slkow drinking strong beer. Hope to taste an aged one soon."

"O: Delicious, unique, sweet, would have loved to have tried it unaged but now I feel I'll just be disappointed"
""
"O: Haven't dabbled much into barleywine and though this is a very good beer, it was probably not what I was in the mood for when I ordered it, I didn't notice the 15% ABV until after it was poured in front of me. But overall, I was pretty pleased with it, but I don't think I could see myself order more than a bottle of this."
""
""
""
"O: This is a phenomenal barleywine, definitely one of the top 5 best I've had. I haven't had the opportunity to try it fresh, but with a few years to age it really mellowed out the booze and brought out the deliciously fruity sweet flavors. I definitely need to find more!"
"O: Mouthfeel is way out of place on this one, but if you can get past the heat and a carbonation level that is far too aggressive, I think this is a very solid barleywine, especially for one so readily available off the shelves. It's not going to take a run at the top examples of the style (Great, Gratitude) but it holds its own. Not too often I can give a 2.5 on one of the factors and still end up with a decent review. Leave it to DFH to break yet another trend."
""
""
""
""
"overall - needs a bit of mellowing."
""
"True American style barleywine and it flaunts it well. A bit to sweet and a little over the top alc. %, but excellent malts flavor. If you have ever said "" what exactly is a American Barleywine?"" let this beer be your template to base your general opinion of the class on. That being said its not great but its what it says it is."
"Half finger head with minimal lacing on a crimson with light golden hues body. Aroma is very minty, sweet and boozy. Flavor is sweet with syrupy, bourbon, dark fruit and Chardonnay notes. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Too boozy and sweet for me but I was expecting this. A nice one to try but not your everyday beer obviously."
"O – At the Barleywine Festival that I attended where this 2010 vintage was on tap, it was in my top 3. The overall fruity flavor with the kick from the high alcohol content was appealing. I’d imagine it only improves with age."
""
""
"Overall, this is not the best barleywine in the world fresh to start w/, as I don't much care for it fresh. However, I can finish a 12oz. bottle and am starting to enjoy it a bit at 4 years of age. Personally, I agree w/ the bottle that the best idea for this bottle is to dig a hole, bury it, and forget about it. In 10 years this brew will probably be fantastic."

"WOW prepare yourself for this one. The high alcohol content is very obvious. I’ve had plenty of barley wines and this is one of the most potent ones I’ve had. The Alcohol is very present in the nose and taste its almost balanced out by the sweetness but is still dominant. I need to let some of these age but I keep drinking them!"

"I could see this being a bit much fresh, but after a couple of years of age it is rather nice - something to sip on a cold night and enjoy!"
"Overall drinkability is pretty good for such a strong beer. Granted, I am not going to be pounding these. It is definitely one of those cold weather sipping beers. Alcohol does make itself apparent only from its effects, not the taste. Overall a nice example of a barleywine that I would try again...if only it were legally available here in Ohio."
""
"Overall: Truly a pleasure to imbibe. It is very strong but also uniquely tasty. The bottle suggests burying a fresh bottle for a year and then to enjoy. Dusting this off from the cellar was a delight. Another score for Dogfish Head, here Hear!"

"I was slightly disappointed that the alcohol was not better hidden. For a beer at this pricepoint, I expected a little more sophistication. May be worth purchasing a few bottles and cellaring for a good five years."

""
""
"O: A solid beer. Dangerously easy to drink."
"Poured into my Spidey pint glass following the Giants playoff victory over the Falcons. Lots of head, overflowed the pint glass. Dark orange color, very hazy, lots of particulates. Smells sweet and boozy. Tastes sweet and boozy, and of victory! Seriously, I get an oaky taste behind the booze. Not my favorite barleywine, but one of the strongest and therefore one of the most jacked. Very thick mouthfeel. Overall, this is a serious barleywine. I would probabley enjoy this one a bit more on a cold Saturday night in late January or February, but tonight will have to do."
""
""
"Pours a very cloudy orange/rust color. A few small streams of bubbles cascade to the surface. A very thin layer of head after pouring it in the glass. The smell is very boozy. Aside from that, there are smells of sweet dark fruits. The first sip starts off real sweet, but is immediately overwhelmed by a lot of alcohol bite. I would say it's almost too much, but I do prefer stronger beers. That being said, I would love to try one of these with a year or two on it. There is a weird sticky mouth feel that is left behind after swallowing. Overall, this is an interesting barley wine. Probably a little too hot for most, but it does have some interesting flavors and would probably be better with a year or two on it."
""

"O: Much better than I was expecting. The thought this was going to be a very hot beer despite being a couple years old. While not the best barleywine, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Thanks again HosP."

""
"Overall: A definite sipper and great cellar candidate. Very enjoyable."

"overall: exceptional beer that's getting better and better with age."

"Thick and syrupy, lower carbonation. Palate-numbing booze that deadens the flavors a bit, though there are some muted dried fruit notes. Not picking up on much hop flavor, there's a tiny bit of earthy bitterness, but it's hard to discern up against the heavy alcohol astringency. This is just not that drinkable, the booze is a bit rough. Maybe the heat mellows over time, but based on this draft, it's not really worth the time & money to find out."
""
""
""
""

"had better barleywines. But...this is far from horrid. Maybe last 25% is a task to finish due to high ABV. Perfect barleywine to share. Will try to sit on atleast one...and let age."
""
""
""
""
"I did not realized this was 15% ABV until pouring. My god. Pours a translucent ruby/carmel color with the thinnest of heads that leaves but trace amounts of lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose is a mix of caramel and alcohol. You KNOW this is one boozy bastard. The taste affirms the smell, this is an alcohol bomb. There's some subtle hints of caramel, toffee, and vanilla, but the alcohol dominates through and through. This right here will take the chill off any December day, regardless of the line of latitude upon which you reside. The mouthfeel is hot as hell. Let a mouthful of this rest on your palate for 10-15 seconds, and it feels like the insides of your mouth are being dissolved. It's very astringent and has a monster bite.The aftertaste is just...boozy. Someone could smell this on your breath from several meters out. Don't drink this and expect a pleasant response from the po-po if you can pulled over on the way home. Overall, this is a pass. Not a big fan. I'd recommend sharing even a 12 oz. bottle among 3-4 people. I will say, I'd be curious as to what this could turn into after being layed down for 5 years. But, it needs time. It needs something. It's current state just does nothing for me in a landscape full of luscious barleywines."

Overall, I am impressed with this Barleywine by Dogfish. I am more impressed with this than their other abv bomb -- World Wide Stout. I can taste the flavors in this, unlike WWS where it tasted like rubbing alcohol. I am going to age the other three bottles in my closet."
"Medium bodied. Strong carbonation, stronger alcohol burn. A sipper for sure."

"O: Pretty decent barleywine but nothing super special. Very boozy, probably needs a good 5-10 years and I bet it would be quite nice."

"O - OK, this is good, but not a beer I would have one after the other. ONE IS PLENTY! But definitely good. DFH seems to always do something different and this really is to me - Intense fruits and intense alcohol blended together very well, has won me over. This would be best with desert, cheeses, or would it be weird if I said sushi?"
"O: I had high hopes for this. It's not bad, but hasn't hit good... yet. This beer definitely has promise with the sweetness and flavors it already has. If that alcohol bite dies down this might be an awesome beer."

"Overall: Good nose but the flavor is way too much. Too much alcohol and too much sweetness."

"12 oz to English pub glass. Beautiful crystal walnut color with fine pencil line cream head. Smell is pretty terrible like glue or adhesive maybe nail polish remover. Taste follows a bit with some very tasty malt notes and burnt sugar and heavy prune but that chemical taste dominates. Alcohol is high but bearable. Ok and different but I wish I didn't buy a 4 pack. Will put the rest away for like 5 years, this brew needs a hell of a lot more time to sit."

"O: The flavour is overwhelming by the figs/dates, resulting in an incredibly sweet beer that is, at times, a chore to drink. It needs more balance and more hops. I would not have another one fresh...maybe it's better aged?"
""
"O - I couldn't get through the whole 12 oz bottle, but in fairness, the label does suggest sharing it. The alcohol burn was just too much for me."

"Overall this beer is pretty good but abit too much on the sweet side. Maybe it was aged too much but I felt it needed a little more hops or alcohol to push it to elite status of barleywines. Drinkability is still great for such a strong beer though, will have to buy another bottle and not age it as long."

"I'm ok with this one, even though this has a level of harshness that takes away from your desire to drink more off it. And the harshness is the % of ABV. The 12 oz. bottle recommends pouring into 2 snifters. I agree. I had no desire to drink the last quarter of goblet, and I took forever to finish what I had. Cannot imagine what I'd do with a bomber of this. Still, good and very well structured brew."

"This beer was a striking copper-orange with a finger of head and no retention. The nose is distinctly that of whiskey. The taste is quite sweet, but not unpleasantly so. There is a slight alcohol burn at the end, but the alcohol is well hidden considering it checks in at 15%. The warm feeling as it goes down makes this the perfect beer to sip by the fire on a cold winter night."

"O - This was easily the best of the three. The '11 was a malt bomb and nothing else and the '13 was still a little raw. If you are going to age these I would say two years is the perfect amount."
""

""
""
""

"O: well balanced and flavorful barleywine, a little different than what I'm used to in the style, this features way more sweet malts and fruity notes and less hops than I'm used to in an American Barleywine."

"87."
"Overall: a perfectly balanced high alcohol beer, well made as indicated by the way alcohol is experienced throughout the tasting. Hops presence is there in bitterness and slightly in taste but is not prominent."
"O- A good barley wine, but not one of my favorites. Cannot drink more than one of these in a session."
"I recommend the experience if you have the opportunity."
"Final thoughts: This beer is more fruity and hot than other barley-wines, however it is a pleasant experience to sip over an hour or so while reading a good book. Definitely not a session beer."
"O: Wow – awesome barley wine. Definitely a sipper at 15% abv. One of these bad boys will put you away for the night."
"Will likely be better after aging. I just can't wait."
"drinkability/overall- this is certainly a beer that i would be very interested to see how would mature with age, the alcohol is def stronger as you go on in terms flavor being noticable, certainly not a very hoppy barley wine which is some what expected considering the alcohol being so high, i would say certain considering this beers high level of abv it was very enjoyable and balance"
"Overall this is a pretty good beer for the massive amount of alcohol. I think that this is a classic example of a beer that will be great with some age on it."
"A must have."
"D/O - A slow sipping beer, very filling. Alcohol is incredibly high, good for sitting at home on a cold night."
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly carbonated and very quickly warming. Medium to full bodied, slightly coating on the palate, rather thick as I would have imagined. Lots of alcohol, a cloying sweetness, and more alcohol."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. Not the best barleywine I've ever had, but it's definitely the most extreme. Another solid offering from Dogfish Head."
"This is neat. It's not a barleywine in the American super-hoppy with some malt to balance it or a Belgian strong super-fruity with some bitterness to balance it out or a British barleywine super-malty/rich with some hops to keep it in check. It's a middle ground that it working well fresh, but you can bet I'll be getting some to age."
"O: I'm not a fan of this one. It's too boozy, thick and syrupy to thoroughly enjoy."
"Overall: This is a great sipping brew. Very tasty and surprisingly smooth for 15% ABV. Looking forward to trying this aged. Cheers!"
"Edit: just had it on tap and it's fabulous!  Dark fruit galore and while a bit hot, very smooth."
"O-Going to give my remaining bottles at least another 2 years in the cellar. I opened it at room temperature and was having a hard time getting through it. I put the bottle in the fridge for a few minutes and found it more drinkable when lightly chilled."
"O - Very interesting beer, almost like sipping brandy out of a snifter. Nice flavor and body along with a scent that reminds me of some homebrewed meads. Recommended to try if you like spirits, and I think I'll take the bottle's offer on aging one."
"O- I wish I had a five year vert of this! So happy that I have near a case of this! I love the sweetness and alcohol punch! Really warming on a cold fall night!"
"O - Olde School is a great barleywine. I had it fresh and it was very drinkable. I put a few bottles away for aging and am curious to how it'll taste in the future. At 15% abv, it does a surprisingly good job of not just being an alcohol bomb. Definitely worth your time."
"Overall - I am surprised at this years offering. I have had vintages and was in LOVE with them, i guess these need some age to get something amazing to come of them. But for a fresh bottle it is wayyyy to harsh. I can't get over the watered down vodka feel in the back of the tongue it kind of grosses me outh. It is like a 3/4 beer, 3/4 are great and the other fourth is just disgusting. Overall decent though!"
"T/M and O - Wow... this is extreme for sure, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing. I can't pull anything outta this besides alcohol. Not really sure what they were trying to do with this barletwine, but Olde School has none of the characteristics of a barleywine. Well at least none that I've ever tried. I'm gonna try to finish this one, but I doubt I will. I'll age the other with hopes that it really transforms over time. I hope to revisit this one in a year or so, but for now..."
"Definitely a nice winter belly warmer to sip at night but I couldn't have more than one."
"Overall: I like my barleywines, and this one is included. I cracked a fresh bottle out of the case which I plan to cellar, and enjoy after some time. I suggest if you like barleywines, to get this a try with out a doubt."
"T: I expected a huge burn from the alcohol, but it was actually pretty well hidden. Brandy soaked apricots, honey, golden raisins and a bit of alcohol. Really drinkable and a very solid barleywine. I would love to get a few bottles of this one."
"Overall I was expecting a very high ABV barleywine and got it. I guess I will have to bury a bottle or two under my bed for a year and see how it turns out. For me it seemed less of a burn than young World Wide Stout and more drinkable for half the cost. It was worth the experience."
"O: Right now this is pretty boozy and hot, but man is this gonna age well. You can obviously tell it's a young barleywine that's meant to be aged for 1-5 or even more years, but it's still drinking well now as long as you don't mind the heat. The dark fruits play well with the sweetness and alcohol well enough that you want to drink it quickly, but this is a definite sipper, especially at this young"
"Pours a reddish copper color with no head but great lacing. Aroma of sweet malts and slight alcohol. Taste follows the nose, no alcohol burn, raisins and figs, cherries also present. Slightly chewy but goes down smooth. Not mind blowing but it's still a really good barley wine!"
"This vintage I'm drinking is less than a month from hitting the shelves, so maybe in a few years the tastes would mellow each other out. I will definitely have to take the advice on the bottle and bury a few for a couple years and compare notes. Happy to try anything from DFH fresh though. Good beer."
"Careful... the alcohol in this one is liable to sneak up on you. Probably not going to drink more than one at a time."
"Definitely a sipper with a very nice sweet taste."
"Appearance is a transparent golden amber with a thin halo of white head. Smell is fruity and sweet. very pleasant. Taste is candylike hops with a fruity back. Palate is slick and light tingles on the back of the tongue. Overall one of the better barleywines. Looking forward to the bottle i am aging. I just don't know if it should be for a year or two?"
"OVERALL: I am not 100% sure how I feel about this beer. On one hand, it really is a very complex work of art. On the other, maybe it is a bit too much for me."
"Pours an amber color with a one finger cocoa head. Not much carbonation or lacing on this beer- expected with the high ABV. Fairly clear in appearance- somewhat easy to see through. The nose is raisin, fig, caramel, hops, and alcohol. A little bit weak on the nose for me- I'd like a little more oomph to the smell. Taste is much better than the nose- the same profile really opens up here. Very balanced and enjoyable. Alcohol is present, but not overpowering at 15%. Feel is medium with a nice alcohol burn to it. Very smooth finish as well. A little syrup/port vibe to the feel too. Overall, this is another nice beer from a great brewery- I've been waiting since spring for this to come out. Cheers."
"A boozey but highly tasty brew. Has all the best parts of English style barleywines but adds a very subdued hop balance to keep it from being cloying. An American BW for English BW fans. A real sipper though, due to the strength. I got a four pack of these and will thoroughly enjoy all four...but on four different occasions."
"Overall, a fairly intense barleywine with a complexity of flavors that work well together. Definitely a sipper and a cold fall night, a really good one at that."
"Overall: Really like this beer. It's the first Barleywine I've ever tried. I thought that I wouldn't like it and that it wouldn't be an enjoyable beer for me, given the high alcohol content. That's not the case. I like the complexity of the beer and would definitely recommend that everyone tries it."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. This is from the newest batch so I would expect it to be a little hot, but this is for sure a sipper in its current state. The flavors are big, but the alcohol definitely combats that to turn it down a notch. I bought two of these for a good price, and may pick up another few and stash them away and forget about them. I can see this turning into something good a few years down the road."
"The second surprise bottle cracked during the lastest Bliss tasting. Right on, Scott! It pours a mostly clear sunrise amber topped by a finger or so of dusty cream foam. The nose comprises buttery toffee, alcohol, figs, raisins, other dark fruits (it smells just as vague as that sounds), white bread, light menthol, and honey. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a touch of minty pine running down the back, possibly the result of the booze mixing with everything else on my tongue. The alcohol burn is a bit too present for my liking here. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decently syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty okay beast of a b-wine, but the booze is too present, and the bold flavors never truly meld all that well together. Close, though..."
"This is a beast, wow. One of those extreme beers, that really takes the words out of your mouth. Poured into 16 oz snifter. Pours a dark orange with a 1 inch tanish red, sticky head. Smell is hard candy, prunes, bready as hell, some aged grass clippings, and some f-in booze. Taste all that with a blast of grapefruit / lemon. Plenty of body, good amount of life for the high ABV, on the dryer side. It leaves you wondering if you are impressed or dumbfounded. Probably both, planning on drinking this batch in 18 half years when my son turns 21. A unique & perplexing beer, wouldn't recommend to many. Just hard core beer advocates."
"O: Every year, I look forward to this offering from DFH--every year with the intention of laying a bit down for some aging. Well, maybe this year . . ."
"O- Amazing beer for 15%. Simlar to samichlaus, and not quite as good as other great barleywines out there."
"O - great winter beer. It's so complex and delicious."
"O- This is a very nice barleywine. ABV is not over the top, as I expected it to be. Sweet, candy like flavors are melded skillfully and provide an enjoyable experience. Recommended."
"Small sips are the only way to enjoy this beer. It's strong and you can it warm as it goes down. I'm glad I sat on it a while but I wonder if it would have been any better fresh. The hoppiness would have been better, I'm sure."
"This beer pours a orangeish color with a 1/2 a finger of off white head. the smell is piney sweet, but not malty sweet with a boozey finish. the flavor is that thick sweetness from sugar addition. the hops are there to and fairly bitter and a good bit of alcohol warmth. the mouthfeel is medium to full and good carb and hot. this beer is pretty good, could deefnitely use some age."
"D - A sipper to say the least... This one packs quite the punch... There is no hiding the 15.04% ABV... Each sips makes you open your eyes a bit wide... I don't have a bad thing to say about it... This brew is a case study in complexity... This is really good stuff... Nicely done by Sam and the folks as Dogfish Head..."
"Really need to revisit this one again one day, I had this a long time ago when I was first getting into beers. I doubt that I fully understood what I had in my glass at the time. I remember the beer being a brownish color with a yellowish white head that had a light sticky lacing. The sme of the beer was monstrous, lots of malts and hops mixed with booze and some sweet dark fruits. The taste of the beer was also way over the top for me at the time. It was malty and sweet upfront, as it settled into my tounge it left a tingling sensation with a bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel had a really thick feeling body to it. Overall the beer was much bigger than I expected. It's been a while like I said and I really need to have this one again I think."
"O- A good barleywine. Kinda sweet and heavy but for the style not bad at all."
"Overall, this is an excellent barleywine, and well worth trying."
"This is neither good nor bad. This can be certainly enjoyed by many but there are many better options out there."
"O: This is a damn strong beer with big flavors. While it's tasty it's pretty hard to drink. I'd love to see a more toned down version."
"Set a few of these aside from an '09 four-pack that I bought, and decided to break one out tonight, despite the NC heat and humidity. Pours a deep amber with a very minimal off-white head. Aromas is sweet dark fruit, with plums, raisins, dark cherries, and alcohol dominating the nose. The dark fruits continue on the palate, but are joined by some caramel and toffee flavors. This beer is very sweet and syrupy, but not overly cloying. It goes down really smooth, with just a slight alcohol burn….I'm not sure if it's the aging that has taken away some of the alcohol burn, but if I didn't know this was a 15% brew, I wouldn't have guessed it. Maybe not my favorite American barleywine, but I'm glad I set a few of these aside, and can't wait to try another one down the road."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a very nice beer. Good tines with this!!!"
"O: Excellent beer. barleywine's aren't my favorite style and as a huge dogfish fan i don't even really care for olde school but the 8+years of age on this beer have done amazing things. to bring out new complexity to both the flavor and smell while also probably destroying the head retention."
"Pours a crystal clear ruby/amber that leaves a fingers worth of cream colored head. Oily lacing that clings momentarily. The nose is different to say the least. I'm sensing an almost port-like aroma that resembles raisins and figs. A stinging amount of alcohol infiltrates my nostrils and attacks them. A bit harsh. The taste is beastly. Some sweet caramel malts are matched with the dark fruit characteristics noted in the nose. Again, the 15% is boldly showing itself here and i can feel it on my lips, in my throat and belly, and in my head already! Wow, this one's hot. The mouthfeel is pleasantly smooth and full-bodied. Overall, this brew offers some unusual characteristics but is quite hot and could use some more time down in the cellar. It lacks drinkability due to the harsh booze effect. Nonetheless, I am glad i got to bust this one out."
"With a slightly lower carbonation, this might be a little better, perhaps sipped like a good bourbon, but as is, it’s a little too strong for my tastes."
"Dogfish Head is known for getting a little crazy and extreme. Olde School Barleywine is definitely that. It’s extremely, crazy sweet. It’s pretty good stuff. But I wouldn’t really start here if you’re looking to explore the American Barleywine style. It’s at the far end of the big, bold, and sweet examples of the style. I’ll take it for what it is…an extreme novelty, but it’s one that’s well worth checking out."
"O - I'm a fan of the big dogfish beers. 120 minute, raison d'extra, fort, and olde school all have this very sweet raisin profile. For such a high ABV this is dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is noticeable but it helps warm up the palate, which really compliments the dark and burnt flavors. This is isn't even a year old and it drank quite well. I think I may have liked it a bit more when it was fresh back around December, but I can't wait to try one with a few years on it."
"Just an extra note: Last week I had a 2007 Fort and this 07 olde school gave me some serious de javu. Just a ton of faded pureed raspberries off."
"O- After a few sips, I can feel some booze kicking in right away. But, this is a good beer. I'm not a fan of barleywines, but this was in the beer store for only $5 and it was already aged. Again, this is a 2007 so I'm not sure how this compares to others, I'd like to find out. My assumption is that the aging really helps balance out the flavors. I'm sure the flavors come out more once it becomes more room temperature. If I did have this again, it'd be a special occasion, or just something to sip on for an hour or 2 because of the buzz. In the end, I would recommend people to try this. I don't know if I would get this again, but I think it's a well crafted beer and I do enjoy it."
"Beautiful red mahogony with a thin offwhite cap leaving nice lacing. Notes of booze soaked raisins and figs, bourbon toffee, red fruits, cinnamon and baking spices - very nice. Taste really mirrors the nose adding bittersweet chocolate and a nice touch of warming booze that is well integrated and the beer is also beautifully carbonated for the style. A well rounded, complex barleywine that i look forward to with some more age on it."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice big and bold barleywine, but surprisingly smooth given the 15% abv."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a pretty solid beer, a little hot in the alcohol department but also pretty flavorful and tasty. The caramely, malty flavors were very nice in it and gave it some great flavors without becoming too sweet. Very nice beer to sip on this evening."
"O - I can't believe how well the abv is hidden, even when I drank it fresh. The candied fruits really work well. I will definitely buy this again."
"T - Great beer; would be even better if it was aged a bit longer; I like it and would highly recommend to other barley wine lovers"
"I don’t recall the last time I bought this beer, but I’m debating getting a 4 pack and having 2 bottles around 2-3 years old and the other 2 maybe 7-8 years old. The start of this bottle made me think the beer was fading away. The second pour makes me feel like it needs a good bit more age. I’ve never experienced this, though I normally don’t open with such a small pour, but either way I’m not sure what would have happened if I used a larger glass that could hold the whole bottle. The flavors here aren’t overly complex, but they contain a great deal of nuance and subtlety beneath the high abv. Much like Immort Ale from Dogfish, this is a beer to age before even considering drinking it."
"The mouthfeel is super sweet and cloying unfortunately. A bit of hops would help balance this out. Overall a really good beer but to be honest I enjoyed this beer more with only a couple years of age on it compared to four."
"2004 bottle, thanks Doug. Pours a peach pink color with a lasting white cap. Nose is abundantly sweet, full of raisins, grapes, peaches, caramel malt. Flavor is dry in comparison, still lots of fruit sugars especially an interesting peach quality. Not too heavy but syrupy enough. Some cardboard oxidation has crept in after seven years in the bottle. All things considered, this is probably better than a fresh bottle, though it's really heavy and hard to drink a lot of."
"O: You can still taste the burn, but at 15% this is a sneaky barleywine. I enjoyed the flavors of the dried fruits and the subtle sweetness was a nice touch."
"D: A little too sweet for my liking. Needs another 2 years probably. Could definitely feel the 15%. I usually like barleywines, but this one makes me uneasy about aging them, especially at such a high ABV."
"O- big taste on this one, but definately follow directions on bottle of digging a hole and enjoy a year later after everything mellows out. Im gonna sit on the other one for a while"
"overall- A great brew, very complex. This one was aged 6 months and was superbly smooth for a brew with 85 IBUs"
"There's probably some potential with this one and I have a couple more bottles in the basement, but even if this develops nicely I don't feel compelled to stock up on any more. Some interesting flavors going on, and it really does have a brandy-like character, but the sugary sweetness is just a little overbalanced for my taste. It does improve as it warms...or is that just the booze talking...?"
"O - This is a fantastic beer with some age on it, I really enjoyed this. Will certainly acquire some bottles of this to cellar on my own."
"D- Took a while to enjoy this, with the high amount of alcohol to it. Got much better as it warmed too. Enjoyable drink, but only one bottle for me at a time. Glad to try this though."
"Strong and surprisingly smooth. Poured orange-brown with some white head that disappeared pretty quickly. Smells of sweet malts and sugar. Caramel malts in the taste, with a perusing sweetness and alcohol bite. Some dried fruits in there. Smooth and flavorful, medium-thick mouthfeel. Not highly drinkable, but still worth a swig every once in a while."
"O: I like this one. It's sweet, tart, and has some nice flavors. However, it isn't quite as complex or balanced as I'd like, so I'm going to keep trying american barleywines."
"I have to put this beer in my top 10."
"Pours a rosy orange color with a thin off white head. Not much visible carbonation. Smell is of sweet fruit and a touch of alcohol. Taste starts slightly bitter when it first hits my tongue, but is quickly overtaken by a mixture of sweet fruit tastes, I think I catch apple and raisin. Mouthfeel is where it should be for a barleywine. Overall, a very impressive beer, hides the 15% ABV very well."
"It's missing that extra note, but it feels & drinks much better then most other American barleywines in my opinion."
"In short, barley wine shouldn't taste like bitter fruit juice mixed with hard liquor and several spoonfuls of sugar (actually, I don't think *anything* should taste like this). There's definitely some good aspects of this beer... but I don't think any of the huge problems would be solved by aging. It's a shame, because the finish is (sometimes) really nice, the mouthfeel excellent, the IBU decent (but hard to appreciate among the sugar shock assault), the smell full and complex (if itself too hard candy for me). Overall, I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone who doesn't regularly steal sugar packets from coffee shops and wash them down with vodka. (original score: C)"
"I'm finding it a tough one to sip on; the alcohol is pretty much in my face and I still can't get over the tart element that Old Horizontal brings to the table. As always, I'm most appreciative for any beer I get the chance to try but this one does not work for me."
"I'm not a huge barleywine drinker, but this one is very damn tasty indeed. No surprise that it's DFH, one of my favorite breweries."
"O--It's good for a barleywine. I'm not really a barleywine fan, and this beer didn't change my mind--but it was close. It's a good barleywine. I wish I liked the style a bit more."
"Overall, an excellent choice."
"overall, its an interesting beer, but not really something i would seek out - killing a 750 of this might prove pretty difficult."
"D - This is definitely a sipper at 15%, not too heavy on the palate which was surprising. I'll continue to buy this and add to my collection. I much prefer an aged bottled version to fresh on tap."
"overall - good barleywine. Would perfer it a little mellower"
"O: Really amazing to see what ~8 years can do to a beer. Extremely drinkable even at 15%, no real alcohol presence on the flavor profile. Now..if I can only keep the few bottles I have from 2010 for that long..."
"D: Directions from the bottle say to split between two snifters. I would agree, too sweet for me to drink the whole think and still want to drink something else afterwards."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability: Low. Too much booze for my tastes."
"I am intrigued by this beer, the nose and the appearance are great but everything else just feels like it needs to incorporate a bit more, this sort of reminded me of the Samael's from Avery, but better."
"Alcohol aromas come out more as it warms, as does malt-like sweetness in the flavor."
"Wow great friggin barleywine this is. I am not so sure from the bottling code how old this is, my mind wants to say its only December. Regardless this is real good, would love to get more and age this."
"I'm only grading this on the '09 since the '05 is a pretty big down-grade. Very good barleywine, & I'd be interested in finding the sweet spot, because I'll bet it's a good one."
"Pours an opaque dark amber color with a small 1/2 inch head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Small bubble lacing on the drink down. Smells of candied fruit, apples, and alcohol. Taste is of tart apples, citrus zest, maybe some raisin/prune flavors. Very alcohol heavy on the finish. Burns the throat after each sip. Weird cooked vegetable taste too. Beer is kind of thick and sticky in the mouth. Drinkability is not at all that good. The off tastes I got along with the alcohol burn probably shut the door on this one for good. Probably would be better with some age on it."
"This was a very good barleywine. There was very good flavor and the alcohol is hidden very well making this dangerously easy to drink."
"I like it under the right circumstances."
"Drinkability - Honestly, not as bad as I would have thought for being so ""young"" of a beer, and being 15%. Sure there is a slight taste of alcohol, and warming, but again, for being 15% this beer is as drinkable as you could imagine a 15% fresh beer to be. I have one in the cellar and can't wait to see what some age does to it. Despite being one dimensional overall, not a bad beer."
"wish i had more bottles of this stuff. people weren't joking when they said it ages spectacularly. well done."
"heres a video review of it that I did... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4dcfBgbzmk"
"Outstanding. But the high alcohol and heaviness of this limits the drinkability, as well as restricting it to only one, no more than two."
" I'm not going to lie, this beer is pretty stout and drinking multiple would probably be a problem. That being said, the flavor and aroma of the beer is appealing, and with perhaps a little age, this beer could be phenomenal. Bottom line - I like this beer and will buy again. Good beer from Dogfish."
"Winner! Intoxicating in more ways than two. What faults it has in feel I think are more than made up with the flavor. A little over the top all-around, but DFH isn't a modest brewery. Sip slow! Savor."
"D - Definitely a sipper, but pleasant to drink."
"Drinkability is not good. Too much alcohol on the end and almost fusel like."
"Mouth/Drink- Medium bodied beer, incredibly drinkable for a 15% barley wine."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into snifter glass. Pours clear dark orange with a thin beige head. Aroma of brown sugar, figs, a touch of citrus and some alcohol. Full body and fine carbonation. Boozy taste. Not a surprise given the ABV and youth of this beer. This beer is too hot to be particularly enjoyable."
"The bad - well...sorry to say this tastes like cough syrup to me. I've had about 10 sips now and it just isn't getting any better at all. I'm glad I only bought a 1 12 oz bottle, because unfortunately I'm going to have to dump about 9 oz of it down the drain. I just can't go any further into this beer..the struggle to enjoy is unbearable. If I need a high-alcohol warm winter option...I go with either a RIS or a port wine. Barley wines just must not be for me."
"d: i think it's delicious, but i wouldn't ever have more than one in a sitting."
"The feel of the beer is full bodied, a big barleywine that does have some punch then is softer going down. A warming blanket like feel as this goes down gives some indication as to how high the ABV really is."
"Pours a very hazy orange with two fingers of orangish tan head.  Smells sweet, with some alcohol, caramel malts and almost an orange smell.  Taste are caramel, golden raisins, sweet malts, some vanilla and a drying hop/alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel is sticky and heavy. Drinkability is really high for a beer of this ABV. My fiancée walked by, picked up my snifter, took a big drink and said wow, this is good, that's how drinkable it is. I can't believe this was the first time I've ever had it, good stuff!"
"I enjoy this one fresh and aged. But dont buy it really often because I usually prefer my barleywines younger with some more hop punch. This one is good fresh, but a bit too boozy to consume often."
"Overall: Basically a 5 for 1 beer deal."
"D - 4.5 - A delicious beer. It is thick, chewy and malt-forward, just the way I like barleywines to be. It is definitely of the English type. A little too sweet and mouth coating to encourage more than one at a sitting, but that one is VERY enjoyable."
"D: It is OK not my kinda barleywine, I like them malty, but still a really nice beer."
"DFH Olde School Barleywine has a dark brown colour and a good head. The smell is of strong alcohol with a hint of raisins. The flavour was creamy with raisins with some alcohol warmth. It was very nice, but the alcohol was too noticeable. This beer had a very creamy texture in my mouth but didn't have much noticeable carbonation. A very nice (and strong) barleywine."
"I was expecting this to have a hop tastes, because my limited exposure to Barleywines have been hoppy. However, it dispelled my expectations, which is always a great thing. That being said, it's extreme alcohol content prevents it from being an easily quaffable brew."
"D- Very high ABY this brew will sneak up on you."
"Olde School is smooth, fruity and crisp, like a cider or an enormous, malty imperial IPA -- certainly an atypical barleywine and one of Dogfish Head's most palatable big beers. That being said, while the alcohol is masked deceptively well, especially given the beer's freshness, you can't help but submit to its will (I felt light-headed after my first taste), which makes it a sipper. A slow, slow sipper; in fact, it's probably best shared. With some age on this, I'd expect great things -- I've got one cellared and am anxious to revisit this brew in a year or two."
"i am so full after one...no more."
"TD/LR Get this beer and age it for later."
"D- I'll tell you how I feel when I finish this 12oz bottle."
"D - A slow sipper. Makes sense at 15%. Very good beer overall."
"Overall impression: although the vinous character of Olde School is a unique take on a barley wine, I'm not sure it's intentional. Some of the aromas seem a bit 'off' for the style, the mild sourness is unpleasant to me, and the evident alcohol detracts from the beer's drinkability. On the U.S. b-wine spectrum, I prefer bolder, hoppier, and smoother examples like Old Ruffian, #100, and Old Crustacean."
"This was a great foray into the world of barleywines, as I've not yet been happy with my previous encounters (e.g. Old Horizontal)."
"Olde School pours a bright, clear amber color. Just more than two fingers of bone colored foam crown the beer. Retention is good and there is a fair bit of lacing left behind. The nose is big on toffee and caramel, with some resinous pine hop notes providing balance. There's a distinct booziness cutting through everything though, and giving me pause. Yeah, everything is in place for a great barleywine. Rich, deep malt flavors (again, caramel/toffee are the main offenders) almost perfectly offset by an aggressive hop bite (the bitterness is spot on, but I could have stood for some more late addition hops). All of that is trampled over by the beer's abrasive alcoholic presence. As one might expect from a beer with such a malt backbone, the body is incredibly rich and full. Unfortunately, the carbonation isn't quite up to the task, it's a bit too subdued. The result is a definite syrupy quality to the beer. I've had aged Olde School before, which is absolutely sublime. Unfortunately the alcohol is a bit too pronounced fresh for it to be a great beer."
"D- Excellent, especially for the ABV. While it's hot, dogfish has yet again worked the booze into the flavor profile as opposed to letting it dominate."
"The mouthfeel is good but the drinkability suffers at the hand of the alcohol taste. I'll have to get some to age though because it definitely has potential."
"pour into a pint glass. The pour yields a cream-white head that seems to be mellowing down. Amber hue, minimal visible carbonation and pretty damn clear. This has the aroma of a good American Barleywine, at least a 15% BW. Smooth, warm aromas from the alcohol. Fruit and candy sugar notes from the malt. Not much in the hop department on this one. For such a strong brew, the alcohol hides pretty well. Also, notes of orange zest, possibly the hops I was looking for. Damn this is sweet! Alcohol heat and a strong malt bill dominate the first sip, the alcohol warm closes it out. Notes of orange rinds, possibly burnt rinds. The alcohol heat is accompanied by some spiced flavors. This beer, for it's size, ain't too shabby. It does a good job of hiding 15% better than some beers, whose alc% are even lower than 15. Aside from that this seems to come off as an English style Barleywine on steroids. There's nothing 'American' about this beer, definitely the English style comes to mind, not a bad thing. This beer's main feature seems to be masking the alcohol. Aging this might do something. Move along people, not much to see here."
"D: this beer is a good interpretation on how I like my barleywines. It had some good sweetness and booze but not overly hoppy. It drank really good too."
"Drink- This think snuck up on me after a brooklyn 1 and a dreadnaught. I lost a couple hours the other night. Very nice and different beer."
"Mouthfeel, eh, hops still, alcohol, clear alcohol feel to it. Nothing too complex develops in this barleywine, it leans very much to the side of just being a gigantic ipa. And hey, there's a time and place for that. Hides its alcohol a lot better than some beers half its strength."
"I still would recommend it...even if you can't wait to drink it. How many 15% beers are out there, after all?"
"D/M: drinks a bit thick, incredible depth of flavor makes it enticing to drink, alcohol sting hurts the pallet a bit but ill accept the sacrifice, slight carbonation tingle"
"D: Big stuff, got to have it bit by bit."
"There is no hiding the alcohol in this one. I happen to like a lot of alcohol heat so I found this brew to be tasty. However, a stronger hop profile would go a long way."
"Suprisingly easy to drink for as huge as it is. Good but doesn't have the complexity or depth I would expect in a barleywine."
"Drinkability: Goes down amazingly at first, as it gets to the bottom however the burn increases and makes for a tough swallow. Also due to the high alcohol content one should be a little careful with how many you drink."
"Also: SUGAR, MOTHERF***S!!!!"
"D- Nice sipping winter beer. Goes slower because of the high ABV"
"D - Such a great barleywine, especially considering it's 15%. Enjoy this one, but share with a friend."
"Big, tasty, comforting, but definitely not in the ""dangerously drinkable"" range. Very enjoyable, but a sipper & good at one."
"D--This is just too hot right now. Got a 4 pack to age and this one needs to sit for a couple years at least. Would love to get some older versions of this brew."
"Pours a hazy orangish gold with a small head. Nice lacing on the surface. Smell is sweet. Boozy. Fruit notes. Taste is also sweet. Grainy. Fruit Nice citrusy hops in the finish with a fair amount of bitterness. Well balanced for a barley wine. Pretty boozy in the finish. Nice full bodied and well carbonated mouthfeel. Drinkable for the strength but it is Very strong. Overall a very good american barley wine. I like the balance and the warmth from this and also just a very nice flavor. Recommended."
"Year old bottle poured into my new snifter. The beer is amber honey red with a thin white head that dies down quickly with thing lace. For a big boozy beer this one looks damn good. Boozy rum soaked raisins and toffee come throughout the aroma very nicely. Although I can smell the alcohol, it's seems to meld pretty well with everything else on this. The taste is great too. Raisiny and fruity with a nice lingering toffee sweetness to round it out. The alcohol is dangeriously hidden, only giving a slight warming sensation in the throat. Smooth velvety mouthfeel with damn near perfect carbonation for a booze bomb like this. Again, this one is dangerous. Goes down real easy. A bit too easy for a fifteen percent beer."
" I love barleywine, have received awards for barleywine and brewing barleywine like brews. And I'm a big fan of most of what Sam does, despite the recent hoopla. Have met Sam: nice guy. (But hey, Sam, it should be called BrewMASTER... no ""S," if we're just going to promo just one brewery.) But this one just plain misses the mark. Guess I'll just buy 120 from now on if I want something more barleywine like from DF."
"D- For being 15% ABV is very easy to drink and enjoy, almost too easy. This is a great beer, I feel that it is worth aging and would to try it when it is a year or two old. Right now I am aging two bottles and can't wait to try them."
"D- Too damn high for a 15% brewski. I feel a little too nice right now."
"D: Much improved with age, but still best in small doses."
"Taste makes me think of natural apple cider, sweet but heated with some fermentation. The alcohol isn't too oppressive with a slightly medicinal finish. Fairly drinkable for the abv."
"D: Strong alcohol warmth, sip this beast with care. Slightly disappointed, I figured Barleywine and Dogfish Head, must be match made in heaven. Good, but not great."
"D - This has good drinkability. It goes down very smooth considering the ABV. I am actually a little bit disappointed by this beer. It is a good beer, but I thought it would be bigger, fuller, and more extreme. Even though it's not what I thought it would be, it is still a good beer worth trying."
"Overall, what we liked most about this brew was its complexity, and the way that it glowed in the glass. The aroma is wrought with all sorts of fruits, grains, and alcohol, which, when melded together so cleanly, made for a challenging brew to dissect. The taste was very much in the same style, but the alcohol was surprisingly hidden. You can hardly tell that this is a 15% beast, which of course catches up to you, in tasty fashion, by the bottom of the glass."
"Into a red wine glass, this pours a clear burnt orange-amber color and holds a decent thin head. I pick up an overall aroma of sweet dark cherry and toasted malt. There is a stiff note of alcohol in the backdrop but nothing that should scare away the taste buds because this opens up with a pleasant sweet and lightly bitter feel into a complex body of...a lot going on...Perhaps this truly is a youth ""trying to find its identity"" as suggested by our server. At its center, I can best sense the taste of the deepest of cherry flavor and caramel malt with a mouth clinging complex finish. CAUTION: This hides its abv like you wouldn't believe and is thus, DANGEROUSLY DRINKABLE..."
"D - Stuff isnt bad. Glad I got to try it but I would like to have it again with more age to it, let this mellow out abit more."
"Overall: Another big abv. beer from DFH that's not as scarey as I thought. It's actually got alot of nice flavors going on that I'm sure will only blend in time to make an even smoother drinking BW. I planned on aging this like I did my recently consumed WWS but I couldn't hold out. And at $3.50 I can always get more to age."
"D: Ok. Half the 12 oz is good."
"D- For a 15% beer, it hides it well. Significantly too sweet to be truly ""drinkable."" But a solid barleywine nevertheless."
"D: Very nice. Will drink again but not more than one in a sitting"
"D- At 15% and with the apparent alcohol involved this isn't going to be one that you will be getting through fast. Nevertheless, still a solid beer."
"After trying this again fresh in 2010, I realize this beer needs a good bit of time on it to settle down...very strong an boozy. Not a bad beer but there are quite a few other barleywines I'd go to before this."
"D: There's no way I could drink more than a half-bottle of this. It was overwhelmingly sweet and boozy."
"D - No way. Not a chance in hell. No drinkability at all. This beer is terrible. This is a fun beer just because it is so bad. Glazeman and I had a good time with this one."
"Almost no head when poured into a snifter but I'm sure would be larger with age. Wine in the name of this means what it is but it has an amazing beer like start with a nice almost wine like fruity fig taste. Amazing beer could get plastered on this stuff except I'd rather enjoy the flavor.... great for pre-game."
"Pours sunburst orange which looks more reddish copper in thicker areas of the glass. Aroma is a lot of barley, and a sweet cake-like yeast with tannic hints. Taste makes ""barley cider"" come to mind - the sweetness and grainy malt of the barley come through, as do some fruity flavors, and tartness like an apple peel. Very complex with lots of flavors to digest. Tartness and strength factor in to make it a difficult one to drink, though I will certainly get another one to further experience the flavor."
"Drinkability - This beer will kick your ass, no question buddy. 15.04% ABV means the drink is harsh. It's a bit of an aquired taste but its smooth and enjoyable leaving a cooling feeling. But for the kind of beer it is its enjoyable, just drink them carefully ... sip by sip, you'll love it."
"Not one for the faint of heart or weak of liver or unsteady of hand. This one packs a whallop and finishing it yourself will make you pleasantly numb and ready for a nap...or running with the bulls in Pamplona...whichever is most convenient."
"d - A decent barleywine, but a little too alcoholic and too sweet. Would like to try again but with age on it."
"overall, this beer is great. one of the best barleywines ive had. good work to the people at DFH"
"The strongest aroma and flavor reminds me of raisins (just noticed it's fermented with dates and figs).  Still a bit of a medicinal aroma/taste.  Overall, it's a very mild, smooth raisin/date/fig flavored sippy beer...kind of like a very smooth cognac or brandy.  Very good at this point."
"Hard to call this beer ""drinkable"" but that is not a knock, that is just a fact. This is an on occasion sipper that in my opinion needs a minimum of one year in the bottle."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I was in the mood for a sipper, so I went out and grabbed the last 4 pack of this at my local six pack shop. Definitely glad I did. Drinkable right now, and I'm excited to age the other two. Don't let the alcohol scare you, it's smoother than Brooklyn Monster, Blithering Idiot, and some of the other Barleywines I've had as well."
"on a side note my mom took a sip(she was teaching me how to host a thanksgiving dinner because it seems i will be the one taking on the responsibility of thanksgiving dinners when she gets a little older(and everyone said my turkey blew hers away) but she is a white wine drinker who is also partial to whiskey(iv let her try a few whiskey ages brews and shes liked all of them for that whiskey flavor) but she said that this reminded her of one of her favorite wines. definitively a must try in my book especially in trying to have a wine drinker learn to appreciate the world of beer."
"D: A little too sweet, but other than that it's absolutely amazing."
"I love barleywines and I love Dogfish, but I've been long troubled by Olde School. It has always struck me as unbalanced, huge and too sweet. Aged (at least one year) is more than drinkable, but this fresh tap was just not enjoyable."
"D: The beer tastes like it is very strong, but nowhere near 15% because a good portion of the alcohol is well masked, so it's a good sipper."
"D: This is a very tasty beer, definately a sipper. Wish I would have bought more because I bet its real good aged a few years."
"creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel with some chew to it. very drinkable all things considered. all in all an outstanding barley wine and one i will look forward to revisting."
"Cheers"
"Overall a great beer. It's way complex. I can't even pick up half of what it has to offer..However, I have a ton of respect for this beer and can full appreciate the craft behind it. Another great one from DFH!"
"It's a bit more of a rough barleywine without too much hop character to it. Pretty sweet, moreso than I'm inclined to enjoy, but it wasn't bad. I think it's a good beer, but I would opt for more bitter barleywines in the future."
"D- This is a sipper, something to savor on a cold winter night for an hour or two. Age helps this beer. I really enjoy this beer from time to time."
"One bottle of this is plenty. I've never had a barleywine like this. I hope to age a few and try one with some years under its belt."
"D: I said for many years that I didn't like this beer. I have even gotten into little playful arguments with some of my beer geek friends about the merits of this brew. The more I study it, the more it makes sense. The more variety of beers that I try, the more my tastes change and am accepting of a beast like this. I tried this for the first time about 4 years ago, have tried it every year since, and will continue to try this every year at least once. I guess on that note, I should probably give it some credit in the drinkability department."
"I recommend drinking this at closer to 60 degrees, and in an etched snifter. Even so, I would try aging this above all. When fresh, it's not really a standout DH beer."
"Quite a bit of head for such a high ABV beer. I think it's quite tasty. The only reason I dinged the drinkability is because of the high ABV. It;s pretty good, but would mess you up to session it..."
"Quite pleasing but a little underwhelming with sweetness almost cloying, at youth. Probably better cellared. I'll keep the other three bottles for sampling at 1 year intervals. More accessible than Midas Touch, but apples and oranges..."
"Notes: delicious. just what i was hoping for. light for a barleywine but makes it up in flavors"
"Poured into a snifter. Bottle consumed with about a year of age on it. The poured is a moderate golden color with little head or lacing, though there are some legs on the side of the glass. The nose is quite sweet with some booze, but also brings a nice fruit presence. The taste is overly boozy and a bit too sweet at this point. Feel falls victim likewise. Drinks well enough now, though this definitely needs three years plus, I'd think."
"Drinkability: About as good as you can expect for the ABV, but just one of these put me out of commission for the afternoon!"
"It's going to get better with age. If you demand big flavor and strength in your beer, this is for you."
"Drank fresh bottled in 2010. Pours a red color with very small head. Smells of alchool, and burns. Initial taste is the alchool. Burns but also has a very sweet flavors as well, but finishes harsh and burns again. Pretty intense flavors makes it tough to drink. Overall intense not for the causal drinker. Deffently needs to age will let you know how that works out in a year or so."
"2010A bottling."
"D - For the ABV, it is drinkable, especially at this age. It is not what I would want to grab, say, tailgating or hanging around the pool."
"D: more like sippability, took almost two hours to drink the 12oz bottle"
"D - not bad at all...but let's be real, it's a 15% brew with huge malty sweetness to boot. Like the label says, pour into *two* snifters."
"Thick, chewy, and syrupy in the mouth. Nearly perfect carbonation and consistency. Not especially hard to drink, but half a 12oz bottle is probably enough for one sitting. An exceptional beer that will honestly get even better with another 5yrs in the cellar."
"It was quite warming. Like a light syrup, with medium carbonation/medium body. Considering high ABV, it was surprisingly drinkable."
"D - A very slow sipper to be sure. One is more than enough, and no length of time of the cellar is going to change that, but it would make the journey even more enjoyable. Buy a four pack, and savor one every year or so."
"A very good beer to be thrown in the cellar and forgotten about for a few years."
"12oz bottle with ""Bottle in 2010A"". Pours a deep orange with a small frothy head. Lacing on the entire glass. Strong aroma, most notably booze. Also some aromas of malts and fruits. Sweet. The flavor socks you right in the face. Big boozey taste. Flavor of malt and some of that fruit again. This may sound gross but it tastes a bit like sweet nail polish remover, but in a delicious way. This beer is dangerous. It tastes great and is surprisingly drinkable for a beer with an ABV of 15%. This is in my top 3 for best barleywines."
"D - Good, and age will help. I like Dogfish's take on the Barleywine."
"At 15%, there's the fact that I can't drink much of this without tipping over. Second to that, I may not want more since it takes a long time because it's such a sipper. This is a good brew that I just can't have much of at once."
"I love barleywines and was very excited to try this one out. Unfortunately I think this beer was probably the hardest barleywine to drink ive had yet. Great flavors but very hard to get down for some reason. I don't think this would be any better if aged, for once. I had been trying to track this one down for a while and was a bit let down now that I finally did. Not a bad beer by any means, just not my favorite dfh brew."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drinkability - There is something about this beer that I cannot drink very much of it. There are other barley whines that seem to go down easy and I am not getting very complex flavors, mostly apples. Not a bad beer by any means but not one of my favorite barley wines, I enjoy it just not as much as I do with others."
"warmth is felt after just the first few sips."
"D: I love this beer (my husband no as much, but he doesn't like dates). I don't see myself drinking a lot of these, but I would buy this again and age it for a year or two. Very easy to drink for being such a high ABV, but definately a sipping beer."
"D - Drinks very nice for 15%. Not even necessarily a sipper. A great beer that I'll have to try and age in a hole somewhere."
"O- I really enjoyed this, and i am looking forward to getting it again this year. I found it similar to Palo Santo Marron and 3 Philosophers."
"warming. very viscous"
"Overall, the barleywine characteristics are there, but it's a tough style to judge, because I think there's a lot of variability. This beer is certainly good, but not really unique or outstanding for that style."
"Drinkability: The alcohol in this brew is almost overwhelming, and I would recommend sipping and sharing this brew for sure. A pretty good barleywine, but one that I can imagine is a perfect candidate for aging."
"Pours a cloudy, rust color. 1/5 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of tart malt, acidity, citrus (apple), sweet malt, alcohol, and a hint of dry hop. Fits the style of an American Barleywine. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, tart malt, citrus, slight vodka flavor?, and acidity. Overall, strong alcohol flavor (not surprising), good aroma and body."
"I love this beer. It makes me want to buy many cases of it."
" Even though this has a huge ABV, the warming sensation was minimal with it mostly being in the taste. The bitterness in the end was unfortunate but this is still a sweet tooth beer which I look forward to having again sometime."
"NOTE: This is my initial review of this beer, I have another bottle that I am aging which will be reviewed on a later date"
"For the abv% not too bad. I don't know how easy this one is too drink and not as flavorful as, say, a J.W. Lees, but J.W.'s is pre-aged and 2x -4x more expensive so a good deal. I don't taste any butter or any other usual oxidation flavors, but there could be something I just don't have experience in tasting. Drink this one warm."
"Reminded me a bit of HOD Doggie Claws, with more booze. For an American Barleywine I would expect this to be hoppier is my only note."
"D: very impressed with this considering the 15% abv. It's hot but sitting for over a year has likely done this beer well."
"2009 Vintage. Pours an almost-clear amber color with an-off white head that diminishes quite quickly. The scent is alcohol, wood, dark fruits...a lot of dark fruits. I also get some sweet malts. This smells like it's a 15% ABV beer. The taste is very sweet. Tons of flavor in this, followed by a very heavy alcohol backbone. The booziness really comes through in the end, but it is still pretty well balanced. I taste the sweet malts and dark fruits (figs, plums, raisins, and dry cherries). The mouthfeel is a bit syrupy, but a good amount for a barleywine. The drinkability is shockingly high for such a strong ale."
"HV"
"I don't normally like barleywines. I wouldn't say I don't like them but this one is amazing. Very very good. 15%...really. It hides it well. Beer is full bodied and a little chewy. Strong malt / raisin content in the front and it finishes a little dry. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Its a reason to keep drinking ""off style"" makes me want to have a side by side with other barleywines. This is an amazing beer."
"The body was full, a bit sharp, a bit syrupy and smooth. Drinkability was good, but loses some points just for the strength. Overall, a pretty decent example of the style. I liked this beer better than the number score will show and will get some more. Worth your time."
"Drinkability: The alcohol is hidden very well in this, however I could probably do one in a sitting. This is an excellent sipper though."
"For being as big of a beer as it is, I thought Olde School would have a little more heft. It's on the heavier side of medium, but I really expected it to be closer to, if not, full. Light carbonation, very slick, syrupy feel. Drinking a 12 oz bottle is a challenge...I'd love to try some with 5+ years on them. Just may need some extra folks to split them with."
"Perhaps my favorite Barleywine. Is surprisingly drinkable for being %15 alcohol. I'd recommend this to anyone willing to try something new or to anyone looking to age a couple bottles. It is a little pricey but the alcohol content guarantees you probably won't want to drink more than two in one sitting. I look forward to trying this a couple years after my bottles mature."
"D-overall not bad but with its abv and heavier body i'd probably go with something else after one or two overall a good beer though"
"Drinkability - This is a BIG beer. Big aroma, big flavor, and a big body. It is an excellent sipper and tastes great as it warms. Alcohol is VERY well hidden for a 15% abv beer. While I obviously would not want another one immediately I will be drinking this again (I have 3 more, but even if I didn't)... The robust nature of this brew definitely beat up my palate... I started this one at cellar temperature, but for the next time I drink this I'm definitely going to start it a little cooler and let the brew warm as I drink."
"I've been anxious to try this for awhile and finally succeeded. Snifter pour with an apricot colored ale with no head to be found. Fruity aroma with vinegar, grapes, orange and raspberry. Very sweet aroma. The taste starts out fruity then slowly brings out some meaty characteristics. Smoked meats to be exact. Mouthfeel is pretty full and consistent. Drinkability was tough due to the high alcohol percentage and the overall flavor gets tiresome on the pallet. Happy to try it though and will revisit it at some point....if I can find it out West."
"Taste is beautifully sweet, not overly so, just the right amount. Some fruitness mixed with a level of sugary malt, all of which hides the strong ABV successfully - although I definitely get some bite from it. This is more of a sipping beer, but its medium body and smooth nature, make its very enjoyable. Definitely not the kind of beer you can have more than a couple of though without getting hit a little harder."
"Pours a nice reddish brown color, with maybe a finger of light brown head. A very boozy nose on this one, whiskey, dark fruit, vanilla, residual sugars and brown sugar. Plenty of malt sweetness in this one, along with figs, raisins, dates, molasses, dark malt and alcohol. A hugely alcoholic, and hugely complex, barley wine. Nice drinkability and a very good effort."
"Overall, a great beer that promises to get better with age. Unfortunately, I haven't had many Barleywines, so I can't compare too well, but it's got a great sweet taste and you can just barely feel the alcohol. Definitely something I enjoyed drinking."
"Not loving this DFH offering. The sweetness just kills the enjoyment."
"As for the palate - wow. Opening big, thick and chewy as hell, this is an unabashed caramel malt assault. A moderate bitterness is present, though this is entirely a sweet beer. Plenty of sugar is present, lingering on into the finish along with a blend of heat, bitterness and a lingering caramel sweetness. Full in body with low carbonation, this is slick and sweet on the palate. Probably the chewiest barleywine I've had. Did I say sweet? Yeah. Not particularly drinkable, maybe in 3oz servings, but that's about it."
"pours a clear copper -amber color with almost no head, and very little carbonation, almost none. for this beer being 15% i couldn't taste this alcohol at all. incredibly delicious beer that was very easy to enjoy, it went down almost too easy. definitely one of the best beers i've ever had. i have friends of mine who didn't seem to feel the same was as me, but i thought this beer was tony the tiger greatttt!"
"Additionally, while I definitely understand and equally experience the progression of the flavor of a beer as it warms up, I still tend to not like beer that is close to or at room temperature. The '09 vintage Olde School was actually one of the few beers I immensely enjoyed at room temperature. Absolutely impeccable!"
"D: 15%? As my three year old would say, ""Oh Man!"" I hope that as I sip this through Quantum of Solace that it won't wreck me. One bottle at a time."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into the only clean glass I had, a pint glass. This beer did give about 1 inch of disappearing head. Thin white lacing now. I have let this sit for about 13 minutes since I pulled it from the fridge. Strong scents of candied and fermented apples. Light hop smell. Creamy mouthfeel is the first thing I notice when I sip this beer. Warming effects of the booze. Smooth flavor, more fresh apples and grapes than dried candied fruits. This brew coats mouth and throat like a syrup. Very relaxing, over the top hops. Will I reach for the second out of the 4 pack? Not tonite."
"This beer is good if you want to get drunk really fast and are not hanging out for very long."
"This is definitely not a hoppy barley and it reminds me of a reincarnation of 120 in a different style of beer. That being said, I love 120 so I'm enjoying my tulip of Old School. This doesn't taste like any barley I've had before and is unique. I can see myself picking up a four pack of Old School."
"If you like English Barleywines, this might be right up your alley."
"I was never really taken with Olde School, but this bottle has aged supremely well. Delightful, a real star and something Dogfish should be proud of. If you have any vintage Olde School sitting around, crack one, I implore you! Or, send it to me."
"D: I'm iffy... It's a decent beer, seems like a good value, but in no way does it stack up to some top-level barleywines."
"This is a very good barleywine but the sweetness and alcohol are so overpowering that the drinkability is limited a bit. Good and definitely one to share."
"The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy but drinkable non-the-less."
"Poured into a shaker pint (I know I did not follow instructions). Poured a cloudy orange/copper color with particulates suspended with an off-white creamy head that lingers until going into a thin film with great lacing. Very fruity and toffee aroma with a hint of hops. Caramel apple sweet and tart, toffee and lemon too. Very flavorful and hides the extrem alcohol too well. Dangerously drinkable, limit yourself."
"Poured an orange/copper color with an off-white head. The aroma is fruity and a bit spicy. Very interesting taste, on the first sip I feel absolutely bombarded with a multitude of flavors. Dried fruit in the taste. This is a serious bruiser as you cann see by the ABV and whiff but I havead bwines that were stronger and the ABV was not hidden as well as Olde School. Kept drinkability high because it is a bwine and no one besides me sits around and drinks bwine all day. A sherry like flavor with apple cider."
"(D)- A very very very deceiving beer. Goes down smoother than I was expecting, but it kicks you in the face 3/4 of the way through it. A rather more floral & fruity barleywine than what is the norm, but DFH doesnt usually follow the norm, so I applaud them for this one. A solid barleywine that actually fits well for the summertime with all of those floral & fruity smells & flavors. Its seriously almost crisp if it werent so thick feeling. Certainly unique for the style. Very excited to see what a year of age does to this."
"This is a slow sipper and even then difficult to finish a bottle."
"Notes: There is a distinct DFH flavor, in particular notes found in their more alcoholic brews. It is not a bad characteristic but if one is not in the mood for it... Well, it could feel a bit repetitive. Here the barleywine takes that note, a fruity and boozy sense, and some expected barleywine notes. A bit of a strange beast, it is nice, but not quite there with my preferences for a barleywine. Maybe sometime will do it? I´ll be happy to revisit this one, in particular after some cellaring to see how it has behaved."
"Overall this was another interesting big beer from DFH but I would like to see a toned down version of this beer as I think it could be very good."
"Drinkability: Taste masks very high alcohol content, but you can still feel a medium burn in the back of the throat. Very rich in flavors. I would have another, but maybe one or two at a time, every so often. Would not drink a 4 pack of this at one sitting."
"Poured a clear, burnt sienna with a long lasting thin cap. Rich caramel and lots of hops of the piney variety, but also a touch of citrus hops. Very sweet nose. Touch of plum. This beer is very very sweet, nearly cloying. Syrupy with a lasting bitterness in the finish and alcohol warmth. Medium bodied and mild carbonation. Decent, but needs some age."
"D - Another great one from DFH, goes down pretty smooth despite the 15% ABV. Would like to drink this again."
"Despite the high alcohol content this beer is highly drinkable, which is a bit dangerous as it should probably be sipped over a longer period of time. I find myself wanting to take generous mouthfulls just to savor the flavors and the warming nature of this beer. Wow!"
"Two to three finger head of tan colored foam, covers the full spctrum of bubble sizes, very good retention and a good bit of lacing. Coppery orange in color with a slight brown tinge, fully translucent and cloudy, lightens appreciably near the rims. Indulgently boozy nose of whiskey, vanilla, tangerine and pink grapefruit reduction, poached apricots and peaches, ginger root, sugar cane, fruitcake, curious given the richness of the scents, not as longlasting as expected. Full-bodied and thick unto immobility in the mouth, syrupy fruit cocktail of peach, apricot, pear, cherry, pineapple. The alcohol comes close to burning, even in face of the sweetness. Ginger, cumin spice, sweet and sour tangerine and orange citrus, vanilla and caramel swirl takes some sting out. Deadens the palate sufficiently that it remains on the simple side. Drinks like a Port wine, just need a roaring fire and pipe."
"It is immpossible to give this a higher drinkability score than 3.5(even that is a stretch) given it's insanely high alcohol content. However I had no problems savoring all 12 ounces. this would be a good one to share if you are trying to stay relatively sober however. This is one of the most unique beers that I have had the pleasure to try. then again, I would expect no less from Sam and the boys @ DFH. I am going to cellar one for a bit and see what happens."
"D - Really good. No alcohol in this 15% car bomb."
"Another winner from DFH, not as overpowering as a 15-percent brew would lead you to believe, but still a strong rich brew."
"D- I remember liking this fresh a whole lot more than aged. While still a good beer per say I would rather drink something else in the style. Alcohol is rather high on this limiting me to one or two before I drink something else."
"I wish I would have read the label first. I would have buried the bottle in the woods and waited for a year to dig it up and drink it. I guess I can still do that once the ground thaws."
"Drinkability: I often think of a beer as a sipper, but I rarely sip. This one, I actually sip. A really good, but oddly fruity and overly boozy barleywine."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable for the alcohol content and the style."
"D- Definitely without question a sipper. It only gets better as it sits. If you plan on having one make sure you do it over a good evening or share the bottle cause this one will take you down if you let it."
"Due to the heavy mouthfeel and very noticeable alcohol content, this is a sipper. I'll finish this glass, but barely. Not the best barleywine ever, but a solid offering from DFH."
"D- Expensive. Very big ABV and it shows. Very sweet, almost too sweet at times. A 12oz is more than enough for one person."
"Sweet Sweet Sweet."
"Overall - A pleasant experience and introduction to barleywines"
"Hard to drink. I want to say it has some merits, but this was quite frankly deplorable."
"D - They say it's 15% but this one goes down dangerously well...I would have rated it a 4.5 but you drink more than one of these and you better look out...a good barleywine...not too complex but the flavors are great"
"D: The closest description I can get to this is of candied cough syrup drizzled over cotton candy, with a bit of malt extract salted on. With every sip, I'm considering a drain pour. Really a let down from what I was expecting, and not worth the $4 I dropped on it...Drainpour."
"D - A sipper for sure. Sweet without being cloying; pretty drinkable for such a high ABV."
"D: Dangerously high. The ABV is hidden so well, like others have said, you need to watch yourself when drinking this."
"D: Over all I think this is very nice, though it would be a bit better as a smaller serving, and the sweetness can be a bit overwhelming."
"Poured a clear brown body with minimal head from light carbonation that died easily. Can't put my finger on it but something in the smell is slightly off, like its a little sour/skunked. Thankfully, the taste is much better as the beer is warming to my tongue and medium-bodied so it doesn't kill my tongue. Really smooth, a woody bourbonesque dryness along with malts like coffee ground and toffee mix with an herbal hop bitterness that gives off a sour fruit taste and there are some sweet fruits/malts in that backend as well. Finishes dry partly due to ABV, which is extremely well-hidden for the % and this is a dangerously great sipper."
"drinkability - this beer is 15% and is so crazy delicious you better watch yourself"
"Drinkability: Always hard to give really high ABV beers a high score in drinkability. This was a really enjoyable beer, but definitely a weekend beer. A very interesting nose, I wish the palate had been as interesting. Nonetheless, a winner from DFH."
"Mouthfeel is medium and has a creamy feel."
"Drinkability is fairly high. The ABV is quite high but it's well incorporated which is really pleasant. I really like the flavor profile as well which for me makes it a pleasant sipper."
"D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice high-powered beer to sip on (or possibly drink a little bit quicker) for as long as you can handle it, but it will catch up to you quickly."
"Surprisingly drinkable after the initial onslaught of sweetness, some may even call it a bit deceptive by concealing its 15% ABV."
"D- I'm going to buy a four pack of this stuff from my local beer store... wouldn't recommend drinking more that a few though. Easy to drink. Use caution."
"D- Amazingly drinkable for 15%. I loved this one. Will age a few and see what happens."
"In both relative terms and objective tasting, this beer is quite impressive.. when considering its massive ABV it is certainly drinkable (if you're into potent, robust flavor).. Very sweet, boozey, candy-like characters along with a tinge of hop in the mix. I find it wildly enjoyable, one of the most flavorful beers there is without taking the plunge into boozey mayhem. I have yet to try it significantly aged but one can only imagine that it will be even better.. Theres a certain aspect to the flavor that reminds me of sodas like Mountain Dew or a red bull, not that I'm really a fan of either of those things, but It has that high octane quality to it."
"Fabulous beer!"
"The 12 ounce bottle, in which my Olde School came, said to pour it into two snifter glasses. Without question, six ounces is more than enough for one serving. This is rich, strong, and delicious. An after dinner treat."
"Believe it or not, since the hop content feels so low, the 15% ABV sting doesn't really hit me as hard as lower ABV barleywines with more aggressive hops. Can't wait to see how the other 3 bottles taste after further cellaring."
"D: Funny- I was kinda scared about trying the 15% ABV bottle in the back of the fridge, but it's pleasantly smooth. I'm really enjoying this brew. Wish it would have dried out a bit with some aging, but I'm really enjoying it."
"Mouth: Similar flavors to the way it smells but somewhat astringent, overly sweet and hot fruit esters. Mouthfeel is well carbonated but too hot for my taste."
"Overall, I'm strangely attracted to this beer. It doesn't taste like an barleywine, more like an imperial ipa, but I still like it."
"Overall this beer was very unique and strayed quite far from what I would consider an American Barleywine. Interesting and like 120Min, it is something that I will revisit occasionally. Recommended."
"D: At 15% alcohol I think its safe to say I could have 1-2 at most. However, for a barleywine it's very smooth and flavorful. Sometimes I feel barleywines can get cloyingly sweet and overwhelming but this one did not."
"D: I'm kind of confused about how a true Barely wine should taste, smell, and feel. However, I love this beer. If you hap upon this review and can enlighten me on Barely wines please inform. Thanks, Bao"
"Wow, not only is this the strongest barley wine in existence but it also tastes like it. Excellent flavor nonetheless. Very sweet along with a hoppy finish. To some, the alcohol may be overwhelming, but I think this beer is another award winner in Dogfish's trophy case of unique American craft beers. This might be my favorite of the Dogfish big beers..."
"Heavy, and syurpy. Really coats the tounge and hangs around forever. Warms you up a real sipper. So thick and heavy coats your lips. I bought a 4 pack of this and plan on streching it for 3 or 4 years like the package say's. Would never drink more than one of these in a sitting yet alone a month. Hope the ageing dulls out the sweetness."
"Pours a nice amber color, short lived white head. Looks like a barleywine. Not a lot going on in the nose, malt is there, alcohol, and a very sweet smell. It smells like a barleywine but kind of weak or subtle. Taste is similar to that, tastes like a barleywine but not aggressive at all like you might think would happen with BW thats this huge. The alcohol is not nearly as apparent as you'd think but its still not the most drinkable beer. Overall, its not bad when served at cellar temp but splitting a 12oz is probably the way to go, I could see maybe having one of these after dinner and calling it a night."
"D-This one was pretty difficult to put down. I think some age would really benefit this one."
"Drinkable, not real complex, but does have a very unique modern twist somehow. A very well made beer."
"A decent Barleywine. I would like to try it with some age on it."
"Dogfish Head Olde School is a crystal clear golden ale with a thin, off white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. It has a foxy aroma. It smells sweet and musty, like an ice wine. It's thick and syrupy with a sticky finish. Indeed, it tastes kind of like an ice wine-- sweet and foxy with notes of raisins and grape jam. It doesn't really seem like beer, but it's pretty enjoyable."
"Normally I quite enjoy barleywines, especially the American variety. But Olde School I did not. Not quite sure what put me off, the super sweetness? the raison/dates tastes? don't know. Still, not horrible, just a lot of better choices out there, for me."
"An awesome beer and im glad i found it. I have been finding dogfish beers very redundant and overly hyped. This, however, is a HUGE exception."
"J"
"I'm giving this a good drinkability, even though you don't want to have more than one simply because for a 15% barleywine, you won't find an easier drinking brew."
"Barley Wines are a very particular. They don't fit many categories, but when they do, they can be a wonderful thing. In the case of Dogfish Head, the beer that they've made has fit a category all its own, and it is wonderful."
"Throw out all of the style guidelines and expectations of a barleywine with this beer. Olde School makes the likes of Killer penguin taste like bud light. This is my personal favorite barleywine, it pushes the limits of the style but maintains the integrity and overall concept of a barleywine. I have the utmost respect for Dogfish Head and Olde School just cements that feeling. Highly recommended."
"D: Personally, I think they went overboard with the figs. They make what would otherwise be a nicely done big barleywine a bit cloying."
"D- Fairly high for a 15% beer that alcohol is reasonably well hidden. I will definitely be laying the rest of these down for a year plus to see how they develop hopefully it will knock the sweetness down a touch and further develop the flavors."
"Could never guess this was a barleywine. It's way to intense. Really sweet with a taste and smell that match. Really strong alcohol and not that drinkable for all the stated reasons. I won't seek this out. Although it's exciting to try a really intense beer every once in a while I haven't been too pleased with anything over 13% (Behemoth). They are interesting, just not really beer. Hopefully I will change my feeling, but now they all taste similar, really sweet and laden with biting alcohol. With that said, I would drink this rather than a port on occasion."
"D-huge flavors and alcohol make this something that I can't drink a ton of; but it is very sweet and thick so great for one (two max)."
"$4 purchase at Blue Dog in Lansdale. Red-orange in color and cloudy pour. I agree with another reviewer who compared it to a pale or IPA in color. Nose is malty, sugary and fruity. Taste has some alcohol and hops, but mostly its sweet - dark dried fruits. I'd say raisins but the raisons have that one covered. This is the smoothest barley wine to date, and with the lightest mouthfeel. Drinks easy especially for style. 15.04% (.04, what am I missing?)"
"Overall - it's a well crafted brew that will be quite enjoyable every once in a while."
"D: Wooo, this one is boozy. That is to be expected, for a barleywine. I'm not too keen on what is expected out of a barleywine, but this one is quite different (and better) than ones I've had previously. Dogfish Head did a decent job of hiding the alcohol, where the few others I've had did not have as much success. This is a sipper for sure, and I'm wondering if other flavors will emerge while this big brew warms."
"D: well its a barley wine, and it was fresh, and I expect it would get better with age. I can tell its 15% because I figured it out today high ABV triggers my sinus to get chugged up, but it still is a good sipper."
"I'm not a huge barleywine follower but I will be excited to open up the last one of these from this pack. Definetly worth trying."
"Overall, this is very unique and I wish I bought more than one!"
"D: You would have no idea this beer is 15%....super drinkable for a barleywine. The sweetness hinders a bit and the booziness mid-palate makes you slow down and think but other than that this beer is very drinkable. Overall this is a great example of the style while being uniquely different."
"D: A little bit too sweet to drink a lot of, but not bad considering the high alcohol content."
"Pours a copper color with no initial head but a head does pop up after the pour and lives a little lacing. The aroma is of sweet malt and some dark fruits, their is also a little sweet smell. The taste is a sweet malt alcohol flavor up front giving way to some dark fruit taste, their is also an earthy hop taste. The mouthfeel is of a slight carbonation. Drinkaiblity is good, for an american barelywine i thought it was very drinkable, the taste was well balanced after the intial hit. The intial hit was harsh but after that a very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: A good sipper on a cold winter night while I study for my last law school final."
" This is a slow sipper, treat it like a fine scotch, because if you don't it's going to kick your head in!!"
"Fresh 2009 bottle. Pours unhazed ruby/copper with light tan head. Plenty of buttles floating from the bottom of my glass to the surface to restock the lacing. Smells of sweet malt, brown sugar, a medley of dark fruit, and alcohol. Taste blends those elements too. Very very sweet, and a little hoppy. Is this 12 oz bottle over 500 calories? Oh wait I forgot, beer doesn't have calories. Thick body and medium carbonation. All that sugar and alcohol don't make for the most drinkable of brews, but whatever. Very tasty stuff, and Dogfish is smart enough to put this in a 12 ounce bottle instead of forcing customers to buy a whole bomber at once like so many breweries these days."
"Seems very highly carbonated for a barleywine. A half inch of head is sticking around and bubbles are constantly flowing from the bottom of the glass. Whoa, a little too boozy on the nose. Glad I grabbed two extras to put away for a while. I'm getting very floral hops and citrus notes. There are also some very nice malt notes with some maple and caramel coming through. Guessing this could develop into a very deep malty and fruity beast. Taste is quite sweet, almost cloyingly sweet. The hops seem to pair with the alcohol heat, while the malts provide the backbone. This one sure gets to the nasal cavity with its heat. It has a great brown sugar flavor with a caramel thickness. Super sweet but my nose is burning from the alcohol. Has a mouthfeel of melted brown sugar, quite viscous but silky smooth. I'm not sure this beer categorizes as drinkable. 15% is a sipper, and a 12 oz is plenty for two people."
"Probably going to be my go to as I watch this winter storm move East to Philly. Should probably go out and get a few and prepare for a lovely jaunt beside the fire. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the booze warmth and malt in the beer world."
"Big body, high viscosity, a nice warmer after dinner."
"The beer has a very relaxing alcohol warmth to it. One of the best examples of a barleywine I've ever had. An equal balance of hoppiness and maltiness. Extremely complex finish. Drys out mouth with a slight toasty finish."
"Drinkability: I've been in search of this beer for a while, I know it's considered a seasonal but Dogfish Head did a perfect job on this beer! I would love to be able to find this year round, as the 15% ABV is hardly noticeable and the complexity of these strong esters paired with a touch of hop bite is perfectly crafted. Another blast out of the park for DFH, I will definetley be laying one of these bad boys down to see how it ages. If you have the pleasure of being able to find this, get it, I wish I did years ago!"
"Cheers!"
"I found this beer at the local beer store. they had four packs but i decided to slip a single into a ""make your own six pack."" the pour was real basic, very little foam, clear orange body. the first smell is oranges, which is also the first taste. real high alcohol. sipping beer, but my friend gulped it (typical)."
"Hey, finally a high-ABV beer from DFH that I like! Pours a pretty amber color with decent white head (decent especially considering the ABV). Smells a bit solventy, but there's definitely some apricot, figs, and hoppy notes in there too. Taste is pretty good, warming alcohol with a bit of malt backbone and a decent grassy hop finish. Decent amount of sweetness up front, finishes a bit bitter. Medium-light body, very smooth. Glad I picked this one up, good stuff here."
"Very drinkable for the style. With the high abv its hard to believe its this smooth. Hopefully with some age on it some more flavors will be unlocked."
"This beer has either gone down hill with aging or needs a few more years. Rich sumptuous caramel that borders on cloying, very sweet, lots of booze still especially in the finish, burns on the way down, still a light citrus hop profile, biscuits, toffee. All seems a bit muddled and obscured by the double whammy of the booze and sweetness. Perhaps it was more complex fresh and it has now disintegrated into what it is or with more time it will mellow yet - or both. As it is, hard to drink more than a small sample."
"This is a touch too sweet for my tastes, and I feel like it would benefit from a more extended aging period."
"D: Pretty drinkable, very complex and very interesting beer. The flavors mixed very well and it did not feel as alcoholic as it is. This is nice barleywine."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a clear amber with a very thin white head, no lacing. The aroma is very bourbonish. The flavor is hot sweet booze. The finish lingers and is very sweet. The beer has medium body, average carbonation and a sticky mouthfeel. The booze is a bit too hot for me. It needs a little more balance or age to make it more drinkable."
"All in all, this is a great boozy beer that can get you feeling good without sacrificing taste."
"Nice beer, pours reddish orange not alot of head. Tastes citrusy and sweet. Smells tangy. Has a very warm mouthfeel with a crisp bitter hoppy finish. Quite drinkable although quite a powerhouse to drink. It's been along time since I've tasted one like this"
"Overall, enjoyed this beer a great deal. As opposed to DFH 120 which I am still reluctant to approach a second time despite its quality, I didn't feel the sting of this 15%+ ABV. Would highly consider having another in the future."
"Wow had this one from the bottle the other night. For me to have a 15% barley and think that it is drinking good now is a rarity. From experience Rogue Crusty needs time because of the hot nature of it, but this one was drinking so smooth and powerful. I knew I was going to get bombed after the first tip but that it was refined and elegent. so much sweetness and hop that I was confused this was a barley. I can see this one in 5 years being amazing and I think DFH is hopeing so too. Well done!"
"The Kings of Hop"
"Thanks to GbVDave for this one. 12 oz. bottle served in a snifter. Bottle conditioned. Poured a hazy amber with a quickly dissipating white head. Fairly alcoholic nose. Plenty of malt sweetness as well. A little port-like oxidation. Full bodied and a little syrupy. Very sweet with some dark fruit flavors. Plenty of hop bitterness, but not enough to balance the sweetness. Seemed under attenuated."
"D: half a bottle is fine because the sweetness is very intense. I can remember drinking this fresh and actually liking it much more which is strange."
"Murky darkish amber. Pours with an admirably sized head for a beer of this ABV. The nose is hugely sweet, but sharp, almost spicy from the massive alcohol content. Big sugar alcohols. Mead-like. Some notes of baked apples. Solvent-like. Acetone (yes, nail polish remover.) The booze actually burns the eyes as the vapors rise. Dark rum-soaked raisins. Cherries. Flavor hits with a rush of hot booze, like ultra-octane apple cider, dark cherries, fig jam, vodka-infused plums, tej/honey-wine-like notes... Shit... this is boozy in all kinds of ways. Spiked maple syrup... There's a late tannin-like astringency that sticks all over the tongue and ushers in the finish, which wraps things up with grape skins, chewed lemon seeds, blonde tobacco, and alcohol burn/heat, and an indefinitely-lasting acetone impression and burn. No lie, this is like nail polish remover in the aftertaste. This batch was bottled November 2008. Reviewed 11 months after bottling. Still very, very hot. I will wait at least 2 years before trying my next bottle. I've had vintages from 2006 or so, when they were still young, and I recall enjoying them much more than this one. Interesting for the shock factor, but this was not a pleasurable experience. There's extreme, and then there's mischief. This beer seems to be headed toward the latter. An odd juxtaposition with the vintage imagery and ""olde school"" reference in the name--this is not olde school. Nor is it new school. This is out of control do-it-yourself ""home school"" where you spike your beer with liquor to create a homebrew beer cocktail (while your girlfriend takes off her nail polish...)"
"Poured clear copper with thin white ring of foam. Big dark fruit aroma of dates, plums and raisins that smack you in the face. Behind the fruit is a sizable alcohol aroma. The flavor is oddly similar to the aroma with big plum, date, raisin and pepper notes just out shining the hot alcohol taste. The alcohol influence has eased a bit over the last couple of months. Another six to ten months may be when it starts to peek. I look forward to trying this again next year."
"Drink is not too good. I usually like most dogfish head beers and this one falls somewhere in the middle. A little much to have more than a couple but enough to try one."
"The taste has a bit of heat to it but it's not overwhelming and is quite smooth, the flavors are a mix of malt and raisins along with some spice and other dark fruits, for 15% the strength is well hidden regardless of the little heat."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy, hot of abv, with a slick finish."
"Hops seem a little too subdued for this style, and while I generally prefer the estery complexity of 90 minute IPA, a more resinous West-coast hop style might have been a better choice here. Over-all a fantastic beer though, which cries out for cellaring."
"Bottled on 11/10/05. Poured into my DFH shaker glass. Olde School appears a murky honeyed copper color with barely half an inch of fizzy, quickly fading light tan foam. Aromas and flavors consist of prunes, raisins, sweet cherries, dark brown sugar, sugary dates, figs, molasses, cherry vanilla, mild alcohol, dark fruits, rich caramel, a bit port wine like. Tasty and quite complex at this point. Since the alcohol has mellowed quite a bit, this is just a pleasure to sip on over the course of an hour or so. Decent medium body with ample carbonation as well. Glad I have a few more of these down in the cellar."
"CHEERS!!"
"D- Simply great. One of the east coast's jewels."
"Drinkability - I hate to say it, but it gets a below average grade for drinkability. It has everything going for it but the alcohol content. It's just too strong to really savor and enjoy. The Alcohol is like a brick wall between you and an amazing barleywine. If the peeps at DFH read this, please do something to reduce the ABV to 11-12%. You have an amazing beer here that is overwhelmed with the presence of alcohol. That is the tension that i felt while sipping this tantalizingly abrasive beer."
"D: The ABV is not as big on drinkability as I would have thought and the vanilla accents help to temper the heat. A good, interesting beer that I am going to pick up a couple of bottle and sit them down for a long while and see what materializes."
"Pretty drinkable for what it is, and I imagine it would smooth out amazingly with a bit more time on it. I will probably pick up another 4-pack and leave it somewhere to forget about for a while."
"Drinkability: The taste isn't all that bad, despite the overwhelming alcohol, as I enjoy the apple/caramel flavors once I can find them. But, the ABV is too big in this beer to be something that I would try to enjoy more than one of, in fact, I think I would prefer to split the bottle and just have half."
"Off the tap at American Flatbread this (15%) beer was a cloudy amber/ruby color. The head was beige and thin and left a thin collar with good lacing. The aroma was notably punchy, alcohol, fruity esters and citrus fruits. The flavors were similar dominated by alcohol, citrusy alcohol esters, light yeast and a faint hops profile. Highly acidic, tart and aggressively alcoholic - not a beer I would recommend more than one of. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium/full and the carbonation average. Old School? Yes. Drinkable? Not so much."
"Note: this was the last beer of many at my visit to the Dogfish Head brewpub, so by the time I got through this I am pretty sure I was drunk."
"Always tough to rate a big double-digit (15%er here) when it comes to drinkability.  After each sip, you have to face that menacing appearance I've described above. As I make my way thru, I sometimes feel like my drink's mean-muggin' me.  For sure, this is an appropriate selection to share. It's also neat (and strong) enough to make that worthwhile.   "
"I get the impression the goal here was a high ABV, not a good barleywine. Way too sweet and sugary, perhaps to cover the ABV."
"On-tap at the brewpub. Served in a large snifter and appears a very murky, muddy amber. I don't usually complain about appearance, but this beer ain't pretty. The aroma is a surprisingly light barley perfume with fruit punch notes. The flavor is a much richer candy caramel and raisin with just a hint of alcohol. This beer, while thick, certainly isn't bad for it's 15% strength. I'd also like to see what it could do with several years of aging."
"D--Not too bad...a very slow sipper for sure but nice and complex and inviting. Good beer, I am going to cellar the rest of my 4 pack and see how this progresses"
"D: One of the beers you're glad you tried, but probably won't be revisiting. This beer is meant to be sipped and considering its boozy sweetness, I couldn't agree more. In reading the prior entries, I note there is a lot of variation in this brew and I imagine age has a lot to do with it. Interesting and enjoyable, but not my style of beer."
"Overall, I am not a fan of this beer. It overwhelms the tastebuds with alcohol and as being only my second barleywine, I am starting to crave me some Bigfoot and am beginning to understand how truly great it is."
"Note on 8 Mar., 2010: Now having one from the same batch so the bottle has about 16 mos. of age on it. The flavors have begun to mellow out and the sweetness is more prominent. I'm also finding that it pairs quite nicely with a blue vein cheese, in this case a Wisconsin Gorgonzola. This is definitely a combination worth trying. I suspect that if I were reviewing this beer tonight and without the cheese that it would score a bit higher than it did with the first bottle I reviewed."
"A thick, sweet and strong barleywine that relies on its size to stand out. Olde School pours dark and bright with a fair head that leaves moderate lacing. The smell is sweet and malty with some boozy stone fruits, like apricots and nectarines soaked in rum. It smells like a very, very strong pale ale, balanced and not terribly interesting. The booziness doesn't have anything to hide behind. The flavor reminds me of the beer version of a mediocre port. It's as if Dogfish Head's goal was simply to create a huge barleywine, rather than to create the best barleywine possible. Admittedly, that's completely an issue of personal taste, and I very much appreciate DFH's willingness to experiment in the so-called ""extreme"" side of the beer world. It's beers like this that expand brewing for everyone and lead to industry-wide innovation. That said, this beer is entirely too syrupy, sweet and boozy for me. I would probably enjoy it more if I had split the 12oz bottle with one or two people. A small snifterful is my recommended serving size."
"For a 15% barleywine, this ain't bad. It's a definite sipper, but no element of this beer is so out of balance that you don't want to drink it. The sweetness isn't too much over the course of one bottle, and the clean finish makes this go down surprisingly easily."
"It's alright, but the sharp, stingy tastes and smells are not ideal for me. Particularly the aroma of the beer I thought was uninviting. I will be a while until I drink this again."
"Update 12/2009: This year's version is better than last. There is more of the actual complexity I expect from a barlywine on a fresh on this year. The sweetness comes through, and dances back and forth with the bitterness and warming alcohol heat. It is starting out good and will age better, I'm sure of it."
"Drinkability: Another winner from Dogfish Head. One of my favorite brews in the style and by them. Super high ABV, but I can barely taste the alcohol."
"Overall: One thing is for sure - Mr. Calagione does not skimp on alcohol. I currently have three DFH beers in the cellar that are all over 15% ABV. The 120-Minute is 20%!!! What's the deal? Anyway, I'm just about done with this small 12 ounce beer and I'm feeling very warm and sleepy. This is not the best Barleywine I've had and I will definitely put a post-it note on my other bottle of this so I can remember to let it sit at least a year or two before busting it open."
"D - Not so much, man , nice, but enough is enough."
"D: Intense and big, I'd be curious to leave it for a year as suggested. It has plenty of potential, for certain. I think a year would do it well."
"Poured with no head really, maybe it was too cold? Attractive hazy golden brown body. The smell is impressive: alcohol jumps out first, backed by figs, banana, and maraschino cherry. HUGE flavor. Tons of alcohol, fruitiness, and general sweetness. Tart. Green apple, cherry, and raisin in there. It's quite thick, but carbonation is a bit biting. To be honest, this brew would be tough to drink a lot of, but just because of its in your face flavor."
"D- I had no problems drinking this one and enjoyed very much. I got one in the cellar and went against the bottles instructions of burying it in the back yard. Looking forward to this one in a year."
"Pours with a two-finger, bubbly cream head that fades quickly and leaves some lace. Pale, cloudy amber color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is sweet malt and alcohol. Flavor is raisins and alcohol, finishes smooth and sweet NOT a session beer . . . savor this beer. This is one of the best barley wines brewed in the States. $16.49 for a 4-pak of 12oz bottles from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA"
"my bottom line: A bit hot and boozy without any age on it, and 15%...are you kidding me? Probably best to try a single before dropping $15 plus on a 4 pack."
"Pours dark mahogany with a little bit of swirly head, not much lacing, not overly carbonated. Smells like a liqueur with malts. Taste is also more like a carbonated liqueur than a beer, but considering the 15% there is no burn, it is all very balanced, sweet, and heady. As my girlfriend described, who hates other barleywines, this is what barleywines should taste like. It's everything you ever wanted in one, with exception of the roughness (which is nice change)."
"I just cant get enough from the guys at Dogfish Head. This is another one of their fun to drink rockers of a beer. Still the best brewery in America in my humble opinion. This one is another complex triumph of American brewing ingenuity and experimentation. Keep it coming."
"I got get a hold of another one of these to age."
"Maybe this is considered drinkable for a 15%abv beer, but even a whole 12oz bottle might be a challenge. Interesting and pretty good beer overall though I would say."
"D- Try it. You could hit enjoy one slowly but the ABV prevents having many."
"A nice sipper, but take a sip too big and its not the most enjoyable of alcohol kicks."
"Pours a clear copper in the glass, with a hefty sediment left in the bottle. Head is weak to unremarkable. Intense malty aroma with lots of alcohol, dried dark fruit, and molassesy sugariness. Hints of grape. Straight-up barleywine flavours - tons of malt and alcohol, assertively bitter finish, and a touch of apple in the middle. A sipper for sure. In my mind, the bitterness might be a bit too strong relative to the rest of the flavours. Somewhat sweet and acidic, but very astringent as well."
"If you're in the mood for a strong nightcap, this might be nice. Fresh, it was a little hot for me, maybe it will settle down in a few years."
"O.K. Good color, almost foggy looking, unfiltered like. Pretty light amber color. Head was lacking a little but ringer stuck around for a while. Smelled strong, a bit yeastie, malt and hops balanced great. Nice Barley Wine... Taste a bit strong, but no more than other Barley wines, pretty much like it should be. Clean aftertaste. Mouthfeel is great, with clean after... For a barley wine, pretty easy to sip, but not a full force drinker."
"This definitely goes to the extreme in terms of strength and sweetness. I can't point out a lot of complex flavors as the sweet alcohol kind of overrides everything. This is not to say I don't enjoy it, however. It is delicious.. but a slow sipper. Another great beer from Dogfish Head."
"I love Dogfish Head... I'm not in love with this beer. When you hear Dogfish Head and Barleywine your ears might perk up a little. However my senses didn't perk up too well to this one. On the bright side; I'm half in the bag after one. Cheers!"
"A clear mahogany color with a fair off-white head and nice lacing. The aroma is almost shocking, very much like a Belgian rather than a barleywine, clove and malt with alcohol predominate. The taste is a nice grapefruity malt and clove with lots of alcohol. It has a full body feel, almost oily, with understated carbonation but the 15% alcohol is quite a major theme here. Not to be sessioned needless to say. Certainly another quality brew from DFH, but as usual, so much alcohol is not a natural balance and I think it buries the potential of this otherwise tastey brew. As it is this one is a nice choice for something different if you like a strong beer."
"12 oz., conditioned, bottled on 10/16/06 and sampled at almost a year-and-a-half old. It pours into the snifter dark amber, nearly clear, with medium carbonation, and a frothy inch of tan head that reduces to a compact collar and leaves a few traces of lacing. Very fruity in the nose, with a heavy helping of malts and ethanol. It starts with raisins and figs, followed by a touch of aroma hops, and finishing with apricot and apple esters. On the palate there is a huge dose of warming, peppery alcohol that is pretty harsh. Some of the pleasing aspects from the scent are present, and there are some tasty notes here and there, but there is way too much alcohol to make this taste good. The body is acceptable: heavy and fairly dry, with consistent carbonation, and as far as drinkability is concerned - each sip feels like a shot, and the finish leaves me almost breathing flames. This is a beast of a beer that probably takes a good five years to become easily drinkable, but at 1.5 years old, it is still very harsh."
"Feel and Drinkability: As previously mentioned this one definitely warms as it goes down, great for the winter months. This is one that I'll definitely be sipping over the next hour or so. Alcohol is the last thing to taste, but once it diminishes the finish consists of some citrus hop and malt and that sweet canteloupe nectar. Carbonation is low, so low that I don't notice it until its looked for, were it higher it would ruin the beer and take away from the flavor and give this beer a feel that is wrong for the taste. Body is medium, lightened by the presence of high alcohol. This is one that I'll gladly drink more of and I'll recommend it to any who are looking for a great barleywine."
"D - This isn't one to drink more than one of; it's a slow sipper to be enjoyed the way one would enjoy scotch neat in a snifter. This is an incredible beer from a very incredible brewery."
"What a contrast between this and Bigfoot, with Bigfoot leaning towards IIPA, and this more like what I expect American barleywines to be like. Hard to believe they are the same style. This one is not for everyone to be sure. Definitely an extreme beer. Still can't give this a great score in drinkability. It's a slow mover. But, now that I think about it, would I swap this for the 120 Minute at half the price? Uh, most likely. They share some similarities. It's too good a value at $5 or less to pass up. Some beers are great because they have their own unique flavor that's hard to describe, and others are great because they taste like so many other things. This one falls in the latter. Great beer experience for me with this beer. I hope I have the willpower to try it aged."
"the chewy texture and hot mouth feel just aren't going to get it done and certainly don't help the cause. yuck. 3/4/2/1/5/1.5"
"Poured in to my Delerium Tremens snifter, dark deep brown with a thick impressive head. Smelled of mal, vanilla, toffee, and alcohol. Taste was hot with alcohol, but also complex with everything that was in the nose. Still, alcohol is huge. If I wanted to taste this much alcohol, I would have ordered a Martini? Very strong for my tastes. Mouthfeel was very good and lively. Drinkability to me was low due to the hot alcohol flavor and smell. I think this needs some cellaring before I'll try the remaining three bottles."
"Man, I sure do love Dogfish Head."
"MMMM... Certainly quite boozey, but such a delicious sipper. I love the flavor complexity in this one. Another wild, over the top, and awesome brew from DFH."
"The drink is full-bodied with a super-fine sizzle of carbonation that lightens the syrup-load just enough. A sipper defined-- likely best ""enjoyed"" in two snifters, after all."
"This is a standout beer."
"12oz bottle $4. I'm no longer a Dogfish fan but I was curious about the barleywine. I was hoping my love for barleywine would trump the 15% ABV but it was not to be. This was a turbid orange color with not much head save a bubble or two. The smell was like citrus cleaning product and alcohol. The taste was too sweet, hot, not my thing at all."
"I remember having one of these two falls ago- man how time flies since college- and thinking 'wow, this thing is too young; it'll be so much better in one year plus.' 15 months later, add 'still' to before 'thing' in the previous enquoted thought, and change the 'one' to 'at least three'. this is the seeing shamu of beers; am I happy I had it? sure. was it a tremendous let-down? you betcha."
"This poured a hazy copper with a bit of tan head. It smelled intense like orange and raisin and honey wheat, with sweet caramel and sugary grapefruit. It tasted strongly of orange peel and lemon zest and sugary caramel, with sour cherry and a metallic alcohol flavor. It was fairly watery with no carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was a very extreme beer with potent alcohol, but was ok to sip. It had nice flavor but was a bit harsh, which will hopefully mellow with age. It had decent body, but I would have preferred something a bit fuller. It was well balanced between the super bitterness and super sweetness, which was impressive for such an extreme beer. By the end of the glass, it was definitely growing on me."
"D- Overall, this is a better than average barleywine fresh from the brewery. With the exception of Old Horizontal, they tend to be too hot or show little promise at any age. This has very good characteristics months after bottling and I'll be looking forward to the rest of the batch in coming years."
"The dates and figs really work well in this. I think it's a strong candidate for more aging to improve it even more. I only got a single, but might go back for a 4 pack to cellar."
"Again, thanks go out to BA member spacecoyote for allowing me to try an excellent beer that I likely would have otherwise never known existed."
"Drinkability- Well, it's a 15% Barleywine. You're not sessioning this bitch. There are two serving suggestions on the bottle, I did neither, although I wanted to share its greatness with someone else. I took it all down with a damn IV drips pace, but enjoyed every moment of its beauty. Nice Job DFH!!!"
"very high alcohol content. destructive, even. also, the sweetness and thickness is almost too much, but still an interesting brew."
"Whoa! The alcohol just wafted off the surface out of the glass and knocked me off my feet before I sipped it. The color is a lovely lager-like deep amber, with a bit of a cherry hue. The flavor is a subtle mix of sweetness and grain, almost like an ale, but very smooth. Despite the strong smell of alcohol, this one didn't hit me until I was 3/4 through, and boy did it hit me. But as a sipping beer this very enjoyable."
"D - This is a great tasting barley wine that is simply too strong to drink in large quantities."
"D: A slow sipper at 15% but a wonderful treat for a cold night. Fantastic."
" I don't really understand the low ratings other have awarded this brew. Extremly warming on a 20 degree night, will buy this again for the winter season."
"Finish, again, is quite sweet. Also, quite hot. Especially when it warms. Better than any wine I've had at this strength, but you definitely notice it. Unique and more than worth your time to seek out a taste, but that's about all I need. One snifter will do."
"D- A quick one for the barley wine but good."
"This one is pretty hot. I had a rough time getting through a half bottle of this. This one needs a few years to age. Not my favorite barleywine."
"Still hot after over a year and i suspect will remain that way for years to come. The other bottle i have will hold up well. Will update in future."
"Overall: Where the hell is the flavor of the hops? The figs? Dates? Malt? Nothing is balanced, it burns worst than Jose Cuervo. And I like burn! That is, if its complimented by the other FLAVORS, but that, is non existent. So why bother. This might want to get scratched off the ""DFH Glory List", or you can count on Steel Reserve being the beer of choice...that was a joke of course."
"The mouthfeel is quite nice. Thick, but not syrupy. Pillowy, but not fluffy. It's extremely malty, and the alcohol makes its presence known. Dominant flavors include bananas, caramel, and even nutmeg. Good, but it's hard to see drinking this often. This has aging potential, but I don't know if it will really evolve, or just settle down."
"old guardian - hey, this is like hittin' the hard stuff! - smells, tastes, and drinks like al-co-hol - and good for what ales me - one a nite is plenty - a good one to finish the nite though."
"With some aging, this beer will shine. It's drinkable young and you should definitely sip it as the alcohol can (and will) sneak up on you.While not the best example out there, it's definitely one of the better examples I've had."
"I bought this in a four pack recently...poured into a chimay glass...color is typical of a barley wine,leaving a hazy reddish brown appearance in the glass ...amora hints of raisins and figs..Mouthfeel is ric and complexe with a slight kick in the end It's a very drinkable beer for it's high ABV..This type of beer is best savored slowly... and on a cold winter's night.kudos to DFH"
"The heat makes it not too drinkable, but I will get another couple to let them rest."
"Powerfully potent--has a wine-like warmth from the alcohol. While it is predominantly a malt brew, there is a generous amount of hops to give it some balance."
"Overall I think with some aging this beer could be really good. I don't know if I'd take the advice on the side of the bottle of throwing it into the ground for a year rapped in a bag. I definitely this age would help lower the tones of the alcohol and allow for the flavor to become more prominent."
"Very sweet, but astringent flavor, with some cherry and citrus notes. Feels thick and syrupy."
"2007 bottle - Pours a cloudy bright amber/orange color with a small ½ inch off-white head that does not want to dissipate. Smells of fruits, malts, and alcohol dominate. First sip is noticeably smooth with the malt backbone clearly in charge. An in your face alcohol presence tells you this is not your average barley wine. No sir, this is good. This is strong. As it warms, a plum fruitiness takes hold as the lonely hops continue to take a backseat. The 15% ABV is not well hidden but this puppy drinks amazingly easily despite the tasty high gravity. World Class."
"Overall I really enjoyed this one. One of the better aged barleywines i have had recently and definitely worth the money. About as solid as they come."
"12 ounce bottle purchased from Liquid Solutions for around six dollars, 2007 vintage, like the saying on label, poured into my Dogfish Head snifter, consumed 12/1/08, reviewed from notes, color was a dark orange with some brown, head was very small and off white, no retention or lacing, smell had lots of caramel, booze, dates, figs, sweetness, and vanilla, flavor was dominated by sweet malts and alcohol but not always in a bad way, not much else going on really, some citrus came to the surface by the end, too much esters, mouthfeel is sweet and hot, full syrupy body, needs more carbonation, taste lasts way too long, could not finish this bottle myself and 15% is there to be known, definitely a sipper, needs more age in my opinion, might revisit an older bottle, I will bug my friend to open is 750 ml in the future, still worth trying for its uniqueness and strength alone, Dogfish does not seem to disappoint on that end, worth trying"
"3.1/5"
"Drinkability is ok. A slow sipper based on the abv but I wouldn't want too much of this one anyway. A 12 oz'er is about right. A good beer, but I think Bigfoot and Legend are closer to my taste."
"this is one of the first barleywines i have ever had. I was thinking it was going to be so much stronger than it was. For a beer that is 15% it hides it pretty good. The color is a slightly cloudy mahogany. The aroma is sweet with a good estery nose. The flavor is sweet, with a sour hint. The alcohol feeling is warm and cuddly. I couldnt drink more then 1 or 2. But I am glad I tried it. Another good effort from the boys in delaware."
"D - To be a huge beer, it's not that hard to drink. Alcohol is evident but not quite over the top, and luckily the bitterness is kept at a minimum. Lighter body also equals higher drinkability. However barleywines aren't meant for chugging, and though it's a valiant attempt DFH should know how to craft a better barleywine than this."
"Overall, I'm very pleased. I'm going to buy a bunch of this and hide it form myself to see how it does with a bit of time."
"3.5 D: I don't know why they sell these in bombers. I got bottles and one of them is more than plenty. Couldn't imagine another 10 ounces of this stuff. Quality brew though."
"D- This one is still really heavy with alc. Other DFH's with as much alc like WWS or 120 do a better balance job in hiding the alc but this one is still present. Have another bottle from 06 vintage. Check it next year."
"The flavor starts off with sweet, caramelized malts and spicy hops, but after that it's all alcohol -- every fluid ounce of ethanol is tasted in this fresh, beastly barleywine. Fusels mix with boozy rum and sherry-soaked dark fruits to deliver an intense, if not slightly off-putting taste. Body is hot with booze and on the thicker/overcarbonated side of things. Still, you can taste the craftsmanship in this one. Olde School isn't the most sippable--and certainly not the most sessionable--barleywine out there, but I'm excited to see how a few years in the cellar will ""cool out"" the hot alcohol presence. I will definitely update this review at the appropriate time."
"Pours a dark amber color with a thin tan head. Aroma is dominated by alcohol but contains hints of malts and dark fruit. Sweet and syrup-like up front, followed by a strong alcohol warmth and a burning in your stomach. Not as hoppy as I would like. As a matter of fact the alcohol flavor is so prevelant that it overpowers most of the other flavors. Not a big fan."
"Taste is warm and alcoholic. There is an earthy sensation that is probably the dates and figs. Drinkability tends to get better every sip and although this is a high alcoholic beer, it drinks relatively easy. Malt is sweet and a bit caramellic and biscuity."
"A very hearty barleywine that I think has aged gracefully, and that's good."
"Drinkability: Whew. Yeah, 15.04% (that was measured with a machine, eh?) is a little high, even for a barleywine, and it showed here - the alcohol on this one burned. Harshly. But there is plenty of good stuff here, too - a hugely complex malt profile, plenty of interesting hoppy notes, and it's not nearly as bad in many places as it probably should have been. Give this one a try if you can find it - it's probably not gonna become a go-to lawnmower beer for you (and if so, I'd like to shake your hand), but it's an interesting one."
"now i understand i am being biased in this review, but it still is an amazing brew that was concocted here."
"Drinks easy, but the complexity & ABV will get to you. Damn fine barley wine!"
"Not a fan of the overly sweet character here. Still a great achievment & glad I had the opportunity to try."
"This is a nice, bold barleywine from Dogfish Head. Clear amber color with a thin head and a little lacing which was nice considering the high abv. Sweet caramel, toffee and fig flavors with a rush of alcohol, sugars and spicy hops finishing it off. Very warming with some alcohol burn. At 15% abv I expect it to be hot, and it is, but not over the top. Not nearly as hoppy as I thought it might be. Perhaps the hot alcohols mask that a little. Nicely done, a relaxing sipper, and I have little doubt that this would get even better with some aging and it has mellowed a bit."
"Now I ""get"" the two snifter thing. I needed a short break after the first. Second - at what became solid room temp. was pretty much the same - a slight more apple-ish (perhaps a slight tad fulller?). Ready for a good night's sleep after this one. As far as barleywines go. Well, nice but can't say one of my favorites."
"Drinkability is actually quite good, but I wouldn't dare take this beer's strength for granted. A great sipper."
"Drinkability- Wish I had tried this last year. As is, it's still a very good barleywine after 4 1/2 years on the shelf."
"Pours a orangish, pink in color with no head forming at all. Smell is malty and still showing signs of the big alcohol level. Taste is showing more of the alcohol than was in the nose. There are also some light citrusy fruit and white wine qualities. It still needs some time in the cellar. Just don't know if the alcohol will ever diminish from this level. Still very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: What can you say about a 15% barleywine? Find a friend or lover and share this over an hour or two!"
"D- complex with a good mouthfeel, enjoyable, big props for having such a high percentage brew that warms so well"
"My first barleywine. 12oz bottle poured into my leffe goblet. The smell is sweet and fruity. The taste is sweet raisons. The mouthfeel is slick and creamy. A bit too sweet for my taste but still very good. Reminds me of DFH Raison D' etre but I enjoyed this brew much better. The alcohol is hidden well enough considering its 15% ABV but still a bit over the top for me."
"D:FANTASTIC!!!! Sublte hint of port with big fruity raisons. Very smooth for such a different take on the style."
"my father had a 15 year old port with his cigar, and he kept asking me for a sip of this, so just keep that in mind"
"Very slow drinking. More fruit oriented in flavors and aroma compared to most barleywines."
"M&D: Medium to full body, the mouthfeel was actuauly quite nice and creamy. The drinkability, on the other hand was not. At 15% ABV, very strong, too strong. Not a good example of an American BW. Maybe I got a bad bottle? Will not be searching for this again. Skal."
"Drinkability is surprisingly high, I thought I was in for a 2 hr sipper, but his sucker is going down with dangerous speed. I assume the 6 months I sat on this really helped, and I'm glad I've got a few more left, as this one is a winner, probably my favorite of the big as DFH brews to date. Still, it's worth noting that I find them all to taste very similar (well, I'm thinking of the 120 and raison D'extra), dominated by the esters and sweet malt and sugars. While this is a tasty, enjoyable beer in it's own right, much of my score reflects how well executed this is, as I homebrewer, I know making these monster beers is no easy task. Much more of an English BW in my mind."
"Thanks to CWiggins for the bottle, it was worth a try!"
"A decent barleywine and another nice selection from Dogfish Head."
"D- Very easy to drink, reminds me almost of Samichlaus, but with more bite. I enjoy this very much."
"07 bottle No head once poured. Buttery, upfront aroma of caramel and some fruitiness. Sweet and warming alcohol with little bitterness in the taste. ok barlywine. I wiill save the others for years to come just cause it isn't quite there. i will still try this beer every year when it releases."
"The body is big, no kidding, and high perception of alcohol. Carbonation is limited but understandable with the ABV that is a bit of a deterrent. Though I rate this based off of this years, I have had Olde School after a year and though improves this beer could use more time."
"drinkability is decent. this is defenitely a sipping brew, but the flavors and concentration here make it a rich and tasty one; and besides, the cowboy on the bottle will do you no wrong, he just wants you to enjoy the brew. cheers!"
"M/D: Full bodied, low carbonation, alcohol is there, but not huge. Drinkability, well, it's a sipper no doubt, but much more drinkable then I thought it would be."
"As is, not terribly drinkable. I'm glad I split this bottle four ways."
"This is an American Barleywine on steroids. Made to drink slow and savor. Would have been better with the alcohol pulled back a bit. Still, one to try just for the experience."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass yielding a small light brown head that quickly fades. Dark rich amber color that was clear and had lots of carbonation present. Scents of sweet figs and lots of alcohol!!. Taste bud overload with the first sip, detected sweet grapes, raisons, light molasses all the while carbonation tickles the tongue. Thick syrupy texture that leaves a lasting taste in the mouth. Simply delicious and with a high ABV I could drink myself into a coma with this one."
"Poured this into my Duvel glass. Has a deep orange color and a nice one inch beige head that slowly settles to a thin layer of foam. Wow this smells really boozy. I can smell a little bit of raisin and some sweet fruit and caramel but mainly just booze. The taste is much like the smell. A little bit of honey and some sweet fruit and then the alcohol and strong sweet taste hits and leaves with a slightly bitter after taste. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The drinkability takes a big hit for the 15% abv and the strong alcohol taste. I had this around early January and decided to let it age some but this did not make much of a difference. Overall a pretty sweet, boozy barleywine that should definitely be shared."
"Drinkability: A true sip and savor brew. There's a long and lingering finish."
"Drinkability: No thanks. Perhaps this one does temper a bit after being BURIED ALIVE, but as it stands now I just didn't care for it."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 10/17/07. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark amber/orange/red color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is average, lacing is good. The alcohol is very noticable in the aroma. It also smells like raisins, caramel, and citrusy hops, but it's overall a sweet smelling brew. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some spice and plums I can taste. Just like the aroma it's a sweet/boozy tasting beer, and I mean that in a good way. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy, rich and syrupy. Drinkability is good enough (it's definitely a sipper), but the alcohol takes away from the drinkability a bit. This one could have used some more aging, but all in all I thought the Olde School Barleywine is a good beer. Definitely recommended."
"poured into a snifter, this was an old burnished penny color with good clarity and no sediment. small, quickly diminishing off-white head. it had legs like a fortified wine and just little spots of lacing. looks thick. nose greets you with prominent alcohol/whiskey. also soft honeyed malts, dried fruit, toffee, and sourish notes underneath. taste is big, thick, sweet malt with alcohol and some spice providing some balance. huge bodied, viscous, and very lightly carbonated. big warming alcohol on the way down. this is an after-dinner sipper, much like a tawny port, madiera, brandy, or armagnac. would be a great match with a nice, smooth cigar."
"Olde School Barleywine pours a slightly hazy orange, fairly light for a barleywine. Right off the bat, even as I open the bottle I smell fruity esters and an odd damp, yeasty aroma. There is also some citrusy hops and plenty of hints of the alcohol to come, sharp and spicy. The flavor is sweet and sharp, almost sour, nice and bitter. There is a kind of a caramely sweetness, but at this abv, it could easily be from the tons of pale malt in the beer. The hop flavor is there, but subdued, and a bitter chocolatey flavor comes through in the finish. Considering the alcohol content, the alcohol flavor is well masked, but at 15% it's pretty hard to hide, and it's definitely there. I would love to see this beer in a year or two, as DFH suggests, to see if it mellows out a bit."
"Drinkability - I could easily get schooled (ha ha ha) drinking Olde School. For a barley wine, this is pretty good. I would recommend aging for at least 6 months (if you can wait)."
"Dogfish certainly makes better brews than this..., but if you're into dominating barleywines, this one is for you..."
"D - Definitely a sipper for sure. I don't generally find barleywines to be very drinkable, but I get in the mood for one every once in a while. This is a solid representation of the style."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, plum and raison dark fruitiness. In the taste, dark fruits, primarily raison, and actually just a hint of alcohol. A bitter, sticky, medium bodied mouthfeel, and a dry sticky plum aftertaste. A very nice hop presence, and actually hides the alcohol very well."
"D: It has a whole lot of ABV and could benefit from aging but for such a alcohol monster it was surprisingly smooth and finished clean."
"D: Wow this could be very troublesome to drink not realizing just how strong it really is. Drinkability is very good along with flavor. A strong barelywine that drinks sweet and a definite recommend for fans of style."
"Got this one at the DFH Alehouse. Pours a deep reddish color with some light off-white foam on top that quickly dissolved down. Syrupy looking. Nose is caramel sweetness, grapes and some alcohol in the background. Taste is similar. Dates and sweet fruitiness, alcohol comes through fairly strong later on. Warming booze. Body is syrupy but actually a little thin. Overall, quite tasty. The alcohol is a little strong, but doesn't really detract that much from the flavor."
"This one is tasty, but it's also overwhelmingly bitter and the alcohol is pretty strong. This would probably make a good desert beer after a big meal, but otherwise, it's pretty heavy. Recommended (as the only beer you drink in a night)."
"2006 and 2007 tasted side by side. both poured a crisp dark orange with a thin head that diminished to a ring. Aroma is more profound from the 07 glass, both have burnt caramel and subtle hops, but the 07 is more abundant. The 07 has a much more cloying sweetness that is toned down in the 06. Dried fruits, sweet apples and some caramel flavor dominate the taste in both. The beer is certainly heavy with lots of syrupy alcohol. While there are many better Barley Wines out there, this one does stand out with the 15% abv and unique DFH touch to it, it is certainly a sipper, however."
"Taste is very much like the smell, malt sweetness takes the forefront here, though. Mouthfeel verges on full, but without the dark malts of a stout it almost seems a little syrupy. Almost. Still very good. The alcohol in this one would keep me from grabbing another, tonight, but i would love to drink this again. Glad i got two more to cellar."
"This one definitely packs a punch to it. Pours a red to orange with a little haze. Little to no head on this beer. Dissipates almost immediately. Not a lot of carbonation to this one. Smell is overpowering. Lots of alcohol with lots of spice overpower the nose. Taste is traditional barleywine but has the alcohol right up front. Very strong. Finishes with sweet and fruity accents. Mouthfeel is a little thick a little syrupy. Drinkability is not all there. Probably because of the 15% ABV and the heaviness. A couple will set you good though.Definitely worth the pickup and a must for Dogfish fans."
" This beer is truly epic. I believe the term ""bone-crusher"" is used to describe it on Dogfish Heads website and it couldn't be any further from the truth. It poured a deep copper red into my favorite snifter. There wasn't much of a head and little lacing. The nose is very shard with hints of dates, raisins and honey. The taste is sweet and malty, almost like Gulden Draak. I will definitely be cellaring the rest of this case for further enjoyment."
"This has been consistently one of my favorite barleywines ever. If you like a less-hopped barleywine then this one is for you. There are alot of wine characteristics here and its just a very smooth experience. Top Notch. Cheers!"
"Pours a really gorgeous ruby and caramel color with plentiful open bubbled head. Probably the nicest looking beer I've had in a while. Good tracing in the glass, and from a half bottle pour, very clear. Aromas are just awash in raisins, prunes, candy sugar, lightly toasted malts and an overall sense that yes, this is 15% abv. Some slight citrus and herbal notes from the hops as well. On the palate, it is slick, sweet and something to really sip and think about. It reminds me a bit of 120 min except maltier and slightly toastier. I understand the difficulty of brewing a drinkable beer that is an excess of 11%, and that it will be exceptionally sweet. That being said, if it was classified as an old ale, I really enjoy it. No, it's not balanced, but quite a fine sipper. While Raison d'Extra I didn't care for as much, this is another great boundary pushing beer by DFH."
"d: Even after a year, this is still just too hot. There have been some remarkable improvements so far though. I can't wait to see what some more time in the cellar yields."
"my other three bottles are destined for future greatness. defintiely worth seeking out."
"Overall its a very drinkable barleywine, but with an intensity like this it might be advisable to warm your palate with another beer first to fully enjoy this."
"The alcohol baffles me. I've had stronger beers than this (Dogfish 120 IPA, WorldWide Stout, Raison D'extra), but they don't go to my head like this one. One of the worst mistakes of my life occurred on the evening when I decided to drink two 12oz bottles of this beer. I awoke at 3am with my head spinning and feeling quite nauseous. I'll never do that again"
"D = This is a really interesting drink, I find it hard to compare to other American barley wines (which is how it is categorized as I write this review), I would really compare it more to a J.W. Lees English barley wine. Though that is an imperfect comparison, too, because they are not really alike. I am just trying to categorize it and as with many DFH offerings, it is a hard thing to do. It would make a great after dinner drink (maybe also an aperitif). Possibly a great drink with dinner, but I am not sure of the right course."
"D: A decent beer, but quite difficult to drink. This one is way too hot right now of my taste, but then again, this is probably a young bottle. If the alcohol mellows a bit with some age, this good be a very good brew."
"This was a good barley-wine; and I would recommend it."
"D: Another winner from Dogfish Head, this would make a great after dinner drink."
"D- Well-balanced and surprisingly light and fruity for this style, the alcohol is well masked at 15%, this is a very pleasant sipping beer for the evening/after dinner"
"Pours a fully clouded dark brownish orange. Nose is almost candy-like. Definite peach tones there. Flavor is extremely sweet. Mild noticeable alcohol. Seems way too tight to pull any thick or noticeable characteristics off of it. Feel is good on the liquid and the carbonation is good as well. This is drinking fairly nice now, but it could use a lot more time to mellow down."
"D - For a 15% ABV beer this is spectacularly drinkable. It uses its alcoholic strength to compliment the hops and yeast spice in a way that is pleasantly reminiscent of the Sam Adams Imperial Pils. The juicy fruit presence was very surprising and quite nice. I must say that this is a very welcome 180 reversal from their dismal Immort Ale."
"The beer had a deep amber body with an off white head that dissipated into a film across the top. Very little carbonation present in the body. The smell was largely of sweet juicy fruit with a slight American hops notes, also present was large alcoholic notes. The taste was very similar to the smell, juicy and chewy malts with hops appearing at the end of the taste. This was a sipping beer that I saved a couple and I am going to lay them down and see how they age."
"Expensive, good, and extremely potent, I'll be buying a few more for the cellar and as occasional late-night treats."
"Drinkability is fantastic here. Just watch how you down this and it will treat you right. Great sipper."
"I continue to be impressed by the whole Dogfish Head line of ales. This Olde School barleywine poured a nice orange-amber color with very little head, though there was a constant carbonation release throughout the time I savored this ale. And like all barleywines, this one must be savored slowly. The nose is pleasant enough, but there is quite a lot of alcohol smell - as is to be expected. The taste is where this ale shines. It is sweet followed by a pleasant alcohol bite and finishes with a surprise hint of faint citrus and toast. Highly recommended."
"Certainly worth it as a nice late-evening wind-down with a good book at bedtime. I'll certainly sleep well tonight."
"I gotta believe that this one will age like a champ. Of the four pack, I'm going to save the other three (OK maybe just two of them) to see how it goes. I'll get back to you on this in three years."
"Um. What? I'm just going to review this as an English barleywine, eh? 'Cause, well, like, what? Who put this under 'merican, anyway? It has the characteristic underattenuation of the English style coupled with low bitterness and a high amount of fruit funk to it. The wife says... ""Ew! What's that weird taste? I thought this was supposed to be a barleywine!"" It was absofrickinglutely stunning blended with the southern tier DIPA, but, hey, that's life. Weird how two underattenuated beers would not taste that way at all when mixed!"
"Drinkability: I'll TRY to let the remaining 3 beers from the 4-pack age for a while and try again... but I don't know if I can let this hang out in my beer fridge that long! This is good stuff (like I've come to expect from Dogfish Head). Definately a sipper!... but you knew that!"
"A decent barleywine, but not the best."
"D: Way too hot for more than a one beer sipper. Got 2 more to lay down. Will see what 1-2(or 10) years does."
"Pours a hazy orange-amber color with a fairly lively head. Sweet/sour aroma. There's some fruitiness in the taste, but the taste is dominated by a cloying sweetness. Alcohol is very noticeable and gives this a boozy quality. I really didn't like this beer, it's far too sweet imho. I put the remaining bottles aside to age for a year or more, hopefully it will improve with age. At $13.99 a 4 pack, this isn't a cheap beer and I expected a lot more from it."
"Snifter's filled with a cloudy, dark red-amber. The thin tan off-white head slowly falls leaving surprising lacing, given the ABV. Sticks to the glass like syrup. The nose is incredibly sweet with massive doses of sugary malts, raisin, prunes. The smell is full and almost sticky. The high alcohol content is very well masked with no astringent notes. The taste matches up to the nose. Again, very very sweet and rich with the same sugary sweetness and raisin flavor. The bittering is quite low. The alcohol warming is much lower than I was expecting, with only a light alcoholic bite and minimal astringency. It's very well hidden for 15 per cent. The aftertaste is full, syrupy, sweet and full of raisin flavors. This is a big beer. Definitely invites sipping from a snifter like a cognac. Really no other way to drink it. It is drinkable given how well hidden the high alcohol is and how flavorful it is. It would make a very nice desert, but not a chance of drinking multiple bottles."
"Orangish brown color with a tan head that quickly dissapates. A nose of citrus hops, sweet malts and ripe fruits. There are also growing ester tones as it warms. The taste is very sweet and the alcohol quite noticeable. Ripe fruits, caramel and a big sweet maltiness. I cannot find the hop presence that was in the nose. A syrupy full body and low carbonation. Not the greatest mouthfeel or drinkability. I feel it needs more hops or another strong flavor besides the sweet malts to help balance it out. I am a fan of dogfish head's experimental brews, just not this one. it has potential, but is just not quite there. I am curious to see what a few years of hibernation will do to this."
"Overall, this a tasty beer, but has several flaws IMO. Not your typical barleywine, but then again, what DFH brew is typical?"
"12 oz bottle purchased at the Wine Gallery in Brookline, MA. A: Cloudy amber with hints of orange, small amount of head that goes away pretty quickly, some lacing. S: Caramel, citrus, dark fruits, alcohol is present. T: Much more tart than I expected, very different from a regular barleywine. It's got a lot of citrus notes, the hops are a bit muted, some grassy earthiness toward the finish. M: Very thick, chewy, and smooth. D: Like I said, it's a really unique barleywine--it almost tastes more like an imperial pale ale. But it's really tasty. I've loved so much of the dogfish offerings that I almost expected this to have a bit more to say, but it's still great."
"Overall: As a barleywine, this ones not outstanding. As a beer, however, its definitely head and shoulders above many if not most others. Someone said its like barleywine meets APA, and here I tend to agree. There are definite similarities between this and others of DFHs American Pales. Still and all, this ones worthwhile. Recommended."
"I have been a huge DFH fan since I first discovered them, but this is not one of thier better beers. I enjoy a good barleywine, and this one is average at best. I don't want to jump out too much here because a beer of 15% can improve over time, at which case, I'll try it again and give it another review."
"Will try another store to see if I bought the only flat 4 pack in AZ. If that one is flat then I will be ready to try one in about a year."
"Pours a ruby colored copper with an off white head that soon settles to a fine lacing. Great aroma of alcohol sugars, ripened fruit and alcohol. Taste is of ripe dark fruit (figs, prunes etc.) and a husky malt background. Alcohol sugars are the story here. Medium full mouthfeel with a definite alcohol warming as it hits the gut. Alcohol is relatively well hidden considering the abv. If anything a bit too sweet for my taste in barley wine. I'll bet an aged bottle is tamed down a bit. Still a solid brew that is worth trying. Cheers."
"Overall: Another wonderful beer by DFH. I love the big aggressive brews they put out and this one is exactly what I thought it would be. Big on flavor and big on ABV. I did not taste the alcohol, but believe me I did feel it. I have another one to enjoy now and two more to age. I will love trying the two that I cellar on its first and second birthday."
"Drinkability: Thickness and ABV hurt here, but the taste saves it. Delicious beer whose drinkability is is quite high. Very good beer, another must buy from Dogfish Head."
"An interesting take on a barleywine. I liked the fruity flavors, and the alcohol really didn't get in the way as much as I thought it would. Still, I can't really say that there's anything to get particularly excited about here. It's a good beer, but not one that I'd go out of my way for. Well worth a try, though. Recommended."
"It was with some trepidation that I tried this beer. The 15% ABV was a bit intimidating, as was the advice on the label of the 12oz bottle to pour it into two snifters and enjoy. Nevertheless, I soldiered on. The beer was a red/orange color with virtually no head. It had a predominately fruity aroma, banana and raisin. A little caramel. Robust taste. The alcohol was noticeable without being intrusive, and quite warming. I found it to be quite drinkable, as long as it's 6 to 12 ounces at a time."
"D- Yeah it's 15% and still a tad hot. I would wager that this could have sat for a lot more time, but I'm glad I tried it. I will be getting more to hold on to for an extended period of time. Unique is a good way to put this."
"A beast of a barleywine. This one needs at least the one year recommended on the bottle. Without a doubt, this is the most prevalent alcohol presence you'll find in a DFH beer IMO. Overall, I wouldn't say it's great, but it DOES have great potential.... I'll have to see what happens in a few years."
"D - A bruiser, big, bold and still asking for all comers at 15% the warmth is noticeable, but pleasant. A good nightcap ale w/ eyelid dropping powers."
"Served this one at cellar temperature from a twelve ounce bottle, into my Stone Old Guardian glass. Poured a deep copper that was capped with a two finger, rocky, off-white head. Head faded somewhat quickly but did leave a bit of lace behind. Did notice some tiny carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Smell was of thick malt, some bitter hops, musty dark fruits, and maybe some dried cherries. Had a bit of a cognac smell buried in the background. Maybe a bit of leather and dried tobacco as well. Pretty good flavor as well. Quite a bit hoppy, thick malt, plum, raisin, some woody notes, with a sweet caramel like flavor in the background. All of this finishes with a tremendous spicey alcohol burn. You can't miss the huge ABV in this one. A nice thick full mouthfeel that is dominated by the burn. Decent drikability but is definitely a sipper. This one will bite back."
"drinkabilty probably suffers from the abv, at 15% i am not sure how many you could drink...great to sip while hanging out...excellent beer"
"Mouthfeel is huge and slick and so drinkable for a beer with 15% ABV."
"Edit: Tasting the 2007, it seems much sweeter than the 2006, more of an English style. I think I prefer the 2006, a beer I really did not consider all that sweet. The 2007 seems more along the lines of a Burton Baton. In fact, I think they put Burton Baton in my bottle by mistake. hehe"
"Overall a good Barley Wine. The fact that this 15% ABV selection drinks as easily as those closer to 10% is impressive. At just under $4 for a 12 ounce bottle it's worth trying..."
"A favorite from years ago. 750 from 2002. Cork came out with a sound like a weak fart. Yikes. Pous fine - a thick toffee body, and a head whichis so brief it scarcely needs mentioning. Flat and still looking in my glass with no lacing. Smells of toffee apples and alcohol - a touch of that DFH ""reisling."" Tastes very rich and malty. Alcohol does not make its presence known in the taste, but it is there, and it warms the belly. This is a very smooth drinking beer, with no carbonation, but the richness of the malt makes this a real sipper. Took me a good part of the afternoon to finish this. A beer of this size and strength is a bit indulgent for one person."
"Poured amber color into an oversized snifter. Small head which dissipated quickly. Looks like a fine cognac and smells like one too. Whatever else is in the aroma is overpowered by alcohol. This translates into the flavor. The malt and hop flavors are again overpowered by the alcohol, but the balance is better as the beer warms. Leaner flavors than a lot of barley wines and the alcohol hits pretty hard. Winter is really a better time for this beer. It warms you all the way down into the stomach. I have one more bottle of this and I'll drink it after the weather cools down here. Solidly crafted, but not my favorite DFH beer."
"My first barleywine in quite a while, this was a nice return to the style for me."
"for the sample sent for my BA annv."
"Drinkability is good. But whoa... this is a big and beasty!!! This one could easily sit for a while. Maybe I'll visit the other bottle next year sometime."
"Bottled dated from 10/16/06, poured into a snifter, I did want to age this a bit the last bottle I had was a bit of a strong mess. Pours a nice amber orange color with a fluffy head that does recede but a rim stays the entire drink and leaves some lace on the glass. Smell is of sweet molasses pear and also some womens prefume. Taste is big and powerful, I had to sip the giant but from aging it, it did tame the wild beast, very sweet on the palate. Candy with hints of raison and also some malt character in there with a strong alcohol burn, also a bit of some hop bitterness on the finish. This beer gets better with time but is very big and could be hard to drink, not one of my favorites but a nice offering."
"Drinkability - this is good ale. It's rather sweet and of course, very strong, so it's a sipper and definitely not a session beer. A good after dinner dessert beer."
" I certainly liked this beer. I had heard from others who tried it in a younger state that it had an overbearing alcohol heat sensation, but that certainly appears to have subsided with aging. A carefully-rationed, slow-sipping treat that is suitable for a rainy spring evening."
"A truly distinctive beer, which is a good thing. Pours a beautiul golden orange, just a little cloudy, with a nice lacing. Aroma is deceptively mild, a little banana, maybe some of the date/fig combination. Huge flavor of dates and figs, and unapologetic alcohol whack. Borders on being a little harsh, but this is a change of pace beer, and to me that sensation really just wakes up the tongue. Crisp, intensely fruity aftertaste. True, it's not subtle -- the DFH description calling it a ""bone crusher"" seems right on -- but I wish they would make this year-round, because it's a great complement to my other favorite beers."
"This is a decent beer, but not stellar. Dogfish head makes some great beers, but many, like this one, seem to be suffering a bit from this general Dogfish head idea of sweetness combined with high alcohol content, which can be a bit tiring."
"Overall: Truely a powerful barley wine. A very unusual take on the style, although very pleasant. Wish i had a cellar or basement to lay one down for a while because this one is going to age very well. If you like barley wines this is on your to-drink list."
"Poured a cloudy, orange/red that eventually cleared upon standing. Head development approached two fingers, but settled rather quickly. Lacing is thin and fine. Smell is very malty with an aromatic sweetness. Aroma is fragrant and estery with a subtle note of vanilla. However, there is an underlying acetone smell to the aromatics rising out of this beer. Taste is very sweet and alcoholic with grapefruit flavors. Mouthfeel is sticky, yet crisp and the high alcohol content leads to an almost burning warmth that is sure to revisit as heartburn. Drinkability is limited due to it's strength, but otherwise relatively easy to drink once one gets past the cloying sweetness and burning alcohol."
"The colour glowed - even away from the light. The aroma was ripe; it was complete and complex. The flavours have melded together, so harmoniously, so seamlessly. Enjoying this beer is an experience I won't soon ever forget..."
"Bottled on 11/10/05. Poured into a tulip - a rich, syrupy cloudy amber pour with a little bit of head that goes away fast leaving some slight lacing. Very sweet smelling up front - dark fruit, grapes, honey, and small floral character as well. Taste is very sweet up front - port and brown sugar, but there is a nice dry hop balance as it finishes. Mouthfeel is chewy and well carbonated, which offers a nice complement to the chewy sweetness. At 15%, I would be lying if I said it was hidden. Anything that high in ABV is a little less drinkable in my book - still, a very nice barleywine. Highly recommended."
"drinkability - Was going to age this, but we drank it over Easter dinner, hence the barley WINE. Served it chilled and was just right with our food. Hight in alchol so it mixed. Would buy it again."
"2004 vintage - 12 oz. bottle via kramer17801 - color of dark translucent honey , with a decent egg shell colored head - nose of malt , red fruit (mostly cherries), slight alcohol , port , molasses , brown sugar , pepper , and hint of cookie  taste of dark red fruit (mostly cherries) , malt , some oats , brown sugar, prunes , and portish - body is smooth, but with a backbone , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of port , raw cane sugar , and alcohol  at 15% this is the strongest beer I have had so far"
"it is a flavorful brew that tastes of sour apple(to me) and fruit, hops. Very wine like. I was told it was like old foghorn and in regards to sn vs anchor barley wine it is closer to foghorn, but not by much in my opinion. very flavorful but not great. worth a try"
"Overall: I would like to thank ggaughan for this beer. It was good, but I doubt I would seek it out again."
"This is a decent barley wine and something to have for a rare treat. It's not nearly as drinkable as Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot, for example."
"D - This is quite drinkable for 15%. I would definitely have more of this one."
"Two more in the cellar. Will be interesting to see how they age even further. . . ."
"Drinkability: Ha - right. 15% ABV and a complex palate keeps me from having more than one of these at a time."
"Beautiful Copper body topped by a thick tan head, really thick for a 15% ABV beer. Head retention is also very good. Aroma is incredibly sweet malt with brown sugar and fruit notes. Aroma is so good I could just hold it to my nose and be pretty happy. Slight alcoholic note, but this is after my 7th or 8th deep inhale. Give me a few more minutes of sniffing...OK I'm back. Flavor - surprisingly light after such a powerful scent. It's incredible that this body and flavor come from this beer. Actually well balanced, decent bitterness to support the malt; finishes with a lingering metallic note and a touch of rubbing alcohol, but it's not really detracting from the flavor. But this is the antithesis of the overly sweet big barleywine. It reminds me of a beer with a touch of vodka - still powerful, but not heavy bodied. Mouthfeel is good; very impressive lighter body for such a big beer. Drinkability is actually very good. This drinks more like a strong amber ale than one of the stronger barleywines available. Been a while since I had a DFH beer; forgot how well crafted they can be."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle dated 10/16/06. Pours an amber color similar to an unpasteurized apple juice. Smells like candied fruit, perhaps apricots, maybe also of molasses or brown sugar. Alcohol smell is not readilly apparent. Taste is of dried fruit and is very smooth. A very delightful, SIPPING type of beer. Drink it too quickly and it WILL catch up with you."
" approach this offering with open mind and RESPECT."
"Rest well, my well traveled friend. You were certainly worth all the miles & bubblewrap! If you have a chance to cellar this, by all means do so."
"Half of this bomber was more than enough for me, so I would have to say drinkability is somewhat low."
"Drinkability: For the style, this could be dangerous. However, it could be too complex for some.,"
"I struggled with this one. Some of the flavors just didn't mesh well for me. The alcohol burn was over the edge, too. Olde School was a chore to finish, much like homework for this beer drinker."
"Deep orange color with an average head that dissolves quickly and little lacing. Strong scents of hops. Flavors are sweet and well balanced. the strong hop scent does not come through in the taste. The high alcohol content of this brew is apparent and makes for an initially crisp mouthfeel, which subsides as you continue to drink. This is a very drinkable barleywine though it should be shared with a friend as suggested on the bottle."
"Drinkability: I love the flavors but this is a stong one, so when you have a 12 oz bottle of the Olde school barleywine and follow that up with a Russian imperial from Stone, you end up taking a nice, i'm a little buzzed nap at 3pm on a saturday!"
"Smooth and slick on the mouth and very drinkable. Scarily drinkable. At 15% I could easily pass out on this one. All in all more like an English Barleywine than an American, but who the hell cares. It's great!"
"Overall, this is another insanely over-the-top ale from the boys in lower Delaware. If you're a barelywine fan, or someone just looking to try something a little different, I'd recommend it."
"Pours a dark orange with a small head that quickly fades and leaves little lacing. At this abv that is noy surprising. The smell is a little fainter than expected. but there are nice notes of honey, yeast, strong malt that doesn't quite approach soy sauce level, and some spicy notes. The taste is surprisingly dry and bitter. There is sweetness here, but it doesn't predominate. The initial impression is that this needs more time in the bottle. As my example was bottled on 11/16/06, I'm sure that's true. A dry bitterness to start followed by sweet malt and alcohol then some spicy hops followed by a sticky maltiness. The mouthfeel is dry with a little stickiness on the finish. This is drinkable as is, but probably much more of a knock out after a year in the cellar."
"D - Pretty bad. Everywhere except for the taste is good on this beer. It is absurdly boozy, even compared with Raison de Extra or WWS. This alcohol completely ruins the beer! I don't care how high the alcohol is, it should NOT mask the other flavors of the beer. This is a serious disappointment. Too strong to session (obviously). It is also not exactly inviting me back for another. I remember having this two years ago, perhaps when my tastes were less refined or the recipe was different, and I adored it. I might buy this again if someone I trust tells me that this years batch is not as boozy. Otherwise, I'm done with Olde School."
"D- I'm gonna let this one age for about a year and write a new review then, but I'm looking forward to trying it when it mellows. Still a good barleywine."
"D- this beer could use a few years in the cellar to mellow it out a bit, a little mad that this is the last one available to me till they brew it next year, I'm gonna pick a few more up then and let them age for a while"
"SO, the above being stated - yes I would love to put a case in the cellar and see it mature in 10-20 years. I can only imagine how this one will mellow in time."
"D: No more than one for me. Id prefer a half pint of this one. Still, at this percentage, I guess this is to be expected."
"Amber-red translucent body with about a half an inch of off-white head. Smells alcoholic and fruity. Tastes like apricot and alcohol. Citrusy hops are also there, along with just a slight hint of a roasty malt? Kind of harsh, but the alcohol is relatively well-hidden. Medium-bodied, syrupy mouthfeel... Not at all what I was expecting... Doesn't taste like any barley wine I've had... Tastes more like Apri-hop... It's a well-crafted ale, but not something I'll be getting again probably..."
"My one regret about this beer is that the strenght is such that I can't drink more than two in an evening. Thought I do that in small glasses, it renders me inable to add a late-night scotch or other entitlement as it is so purely stong onto itself. Know, clearly, what you are getting into. Expect something as interesting as Samichlaus, and don't be afraid to enjoy it on the same level."
"Poured a dark chestnut. An immediate waft of rubbing alcohol from the glass. First sip is highly alcoholic flavors awash in sweet, caramel-candy malt. Harsh and a bit of a struggle. As the beer warms, the alcohol, rather surprisingly, merges a bit with the malt, but still retains a strong note throughout. Sweetness tones down a little, and some darker fruit flavors peek through. My bottle was just a few months old, so perhaps a bit of age will tame this down. As it was, it was just too rough to be enjoyable."
"D: A sipping night cap brew. I wonder how this would do in the cellar for a couple of years--the bitterness might mellow a tad. Tasty offering from DFH and another wildly high abv. Definitely worth a try."
"Considering the 15%abv this is a very drinkable beer. Drinks like a less hoppy big IPA. This beer is a great example of what age can do for some beers. The sweetness that was most prominent and drowned out a lot of other flavors in my fresh bottle mellowed and compliments now rather than overwhelms. Worth leaving for a year IMO."
"Pours an orangish amber color that produces a half inch white head that eventually turns into a white ring around the glass that leaves sporadic lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is certainly boozy with some fruit (mostly apples) and a wierd metallic twanginess in the background. The taste starts out smooth and malty which makes room for ripe fruit and finally the alcohol kicks in. You can definately feel the warmth of the alcohol all the way down with this one. Overall, this is a fairly new bottle that definately needs some time to mellow out a little. I have another one that I will keep for awhile and will review again in a year or two. Not bad, but it definately could use some aging as the bottle suggests."
"Drinks good."
"Drinkability... at 15%, it's rough, but goes down nice."
"DFH does it again!"
"I have one bottle left that I'll be letting sit for a while and see what happens. It should age well."
"Overall, im glad i tried it. If it was put in front of me i would drink it. Other than that, its a ""been there, done that"". I wouldnt go out of my way for it."
"High abv is noticeable. Slight burn in the mouth and on the way down. Other than that, solid beer."
"I'd call this beer like many of it's DFH siblings a sipping beer or an occasional diversion from the hum drum fare."
"pours a deep red/brown with a slightly thin head. Has a strong, sweet aroma with definite alcohol undertones. Sweet, fruity flavors with a good alcohol bite. very malty, slightly hoppy. Has a good mouthfeel with lots of tiny bubbles. very good barley wine."
"Pours with a small sized head that leaves lacing and a well-defined collar around the liquid. Body is ruby brown, clear and bright. The aroma first off reminds me of banana chips -- dried sugar smells mixed with fruit and a bit of spice. Pears and caramel malts come out with higher temperature and exposure to air. On the palate, big caramel sweetness up front, followed by pears and apples for fruits at the mid-palate. It's very malty, with just some hops for bittering balance. Toward the end there's a tinge of acidity, followed by a quick dry-out leaving a baked dough note for the finish. Mouthfeel is very thick, as usual for the style, with uncharacteristically sharp carbonation that helps lighten things a bit. Overall, this is a good barleywine, made in the English style. It will be interesting to see what aging does to this."
"This beer pours a light golden color with a moderate head. The lacing pattern is also very complete and leaves no piece of glass uncovered. The smell is very, very sweet and almost reminds me of cotton candy. The smell begins to permeate as soon as the top is removed and this beer is poured. The taste is sweet as well. The same bubble-gum smell is apparent, but the addition of strong hops makes this special. The taste is very large, much like a good barlywine should be. This is a beer that should be sought out, and enjoyed thoroughly."
"Fresh bottle dated 10/16/06. Pour was a little carbonated. With a 15% ABV, the alcohol burn was noticeable but not overwhelming. I think this beer needs to age a bit. This beer is very sweet for a barley wine & I can't quite put my finger on its flavors. Still, this is a tasty brew and I will put a few down to sit to see what happens with some age. Cheers."
"Drinkability is pretty good for the huge ABV. This is a long sipper to say the least. Some cellaring time should do wonders for this."
"Drinkable? LOL It depends what you mean by drinkable I suppose. There is no way I would drink more than one of these due solely to the high alcohol content. I dont enjoy falling over myself. It is, however, drinkable due to the fact that it is a very tasty and enjoyable beer. Definitely a sipper! This should age EXTREMELY WELL."
"drinkability is much higher than i expected. you're not going to have a few of these, but splitting one with a friend is excellent. now i need to find one to put down in the cellar for a year or so..."
"Seriously, very relaxing and warming barleywine. A little too sweet for my tastes but makes up for it with the generous use of hops on the end. Bottle date 11/10/05 indicating this one is a year old."
"There is a little too much burn here to make the mouthfeel great, but there is still a thick, luxurious texture that is enjoyable. However, this is nothing that could be consumed in quantities over a single bottle."
"Overall I think there is potential for this to develop into something better. I drank an 03 the other day that I'd aged and it was terrific. This years batch would do good with some aging. The alcohol shows through too much in this young state. I suggest following the instructions on the bottle, which basically say to bury it underground for one year then drink it."
"The drinkability is great, very enjoyable BIG fruity flavor, very nice. It left me wishing for one more sip. Prosit MK"
"I did a little tasting of the 2005 and 2006 versions of this over the last two days. The new one was bottled on 10/16/2006 and the old one was bottled on 11/10/2005. The appearance was very similar, clear gold with hints of orange. My wife thought I was drinking champagne. The newer one had a bigger and more persistent off white head and was much more effervescent. The new one left lacing down the glass on top of glycerin, the old one just left the glycerin. The smell is a little grassy and some fruit, with a little bit of alcohol. The older bottle had less fruit and more grassiness. The new one reminded me of thick champagne. There is a strong chardonnay flavor in bottles, figs, pears, and a touch of hazelnut. The smells and flavors in the old bottle are mixed together more and harder to pick out, but they are there. I didn't really notice the alcohol level until it hit my stomach, and it really warmed me up. A very sippable beer."
"Medium body with little carbonation. Slight alcohol burn on swallowing, but that is expected with 15% abv. Not as hoppy as some other American barley wines, but still a nice example. The abv does hurt the drinkability somewhat. Another good brew from DFH."
"Found randomly at Sams in fact I think I got the last 4 pack they had. Pours hazy, orangey amber with nice thick head that leaves lacing. Alcohol is present immediately followed by banana, light hop aroma, some bread, and subdued sweet pale malt. As it worms up the sent grows on me, but the idea of imbibing so much alcohol, with so many residual sugars is a little frightening. The taste is much the same as the smell, actually in some senses it reminds me of certain tripels Ive had I think mainly because of the bready notes and the ester quality. For me the real questionable issue is the amount of alcohol, which is defiantly present more so in this than almost any other beer Ive had, in both the taste and the smell. The mouth feel is all right, but there is definite too much alcohol. Honestly I was a little disappointed. I love that DFH is so daring with their brews, but other than novelty sake, this beer is lacking the balance necessary for a super great drink. Coupled with the fact that this is a hard to get beer and expensive I doubt Ill buy this again, but its worth a try for novelty sake"
"Dogfish is slowly becoming one of if not my favorite brewerys the more I sample their offerings and this barley wine is no exception. Pours a murkey orange with a medium head and little to no lacing. Smell is strong with fruit and alcohol presence as well as toasted malts and brown sugar. Taste is much of the same with a heavy alcohol presence and I definately pick up on the fig notes. Mouthfeel is somewhat rough because of it's carbonated burning sensation but overall still a smooth brew given it's AC."
"I christened my new beer only fridge by buying and stocking a 6 pack of the 12 oz bottles. After going to a cocktail party, and not having anything alcoholic to drink, because there wasn't a decent beer there, I treated myself to an Old School. Poured it into a pint glass (I know, I know) and sat down and relaxed. My wife laughed when I said it was the perfect beer for a 33 degree night. It looked beautiful, and very lightly aromatically hopped. Low carbonation, but nice, respectable head. Thought I tasted a hint of raisons, but it turned out, according to DFH, to be figs. This is a dangerous beer, as it goes down deceptively smoothly, with just a hint of an alcoholic after taste - more of a warming effect than a burn. I am glad I have 5 more bottles."
"D- Very good. Nice complex brew. Very tasty. If I find it when I go out of town I will be picking this up. It is a sipper though."
"Like many DFH offerings, surprisingly drinkable given the big ABV. However, this beer is one to be sipped slowly and enjoyed."
"The drinkability is very good I would say. I wish I could get my hands on some more of this. I only had one bottle of this so it doesn't look like I'll be aging any of this out. It would be perfect for the cellar."
"Overall, it's another good brew from Dogfish Head, although not one of their best."
"Overall, a very nice American barleywine. I would recommend it but I have to admit there are lots of b-wines out there I think are more comlex and interesting. Definitely worth trying and I'm sure I'll continue to buy and age more of these."
"D - Very drinkable at the ABV. Another great brew from DFH. Highly recommended."
"2007 edition, bought at City Wide in South Bend a while ago. Pours slightly brown to orange beer with a softer lacing than expected and just a dusting of a white head. Smells strong, and sweetly malty, with a fruity, hoppy punch. A nice big nose, aggressive and inviting. Big flavor too..I've had another aged Olde School once before and this evokes memories of that experience. Big alcohol presence, but the alcohol is wrangled handily by the complexity of flavors. Big fig and prune punch, with a large grassy bitterness. Bitterness is still strong at this 1-year stage, but more reserved than when new. Sweet, sweet malt, like tasting malt syrup from the can. Hints of maple, strawberry, anise, ethanol. Big syrupy mouthfeel, though not as syrupy as some other DH beers. A sipper of a barley wine, but a delicious one. I was forced to drink this before I had planned to due to moving across the country, but it still didn't disappoint, not by a long shot. Very nice."
"Drinkability/Overall: A real style-bender here...BSPA? Imperial Maibock? A testament to the wide variability within the barleywine style. Another one of DFH's ""Look how much booze we can jam into your favorite style!"" beers and once again, they do it well as the 15% does not take over. Little to no hop presence means a mostly sugary and fruity experience. Surely interesting."
"Drinkability: Another virtuoso effort on the strong beer from DFH, though I can't help feeling that they sometimes oversweeten to compensate for high ABV. Nonetheless, turning 15% into a mild pepper finish deserves some credit. In terms of the style, this is a little sweet and not quite as earthy in its fruits as other barleywines. In some ways I give this the same kind of pass I give Sierra Nevada beers - DFH are going to put their own stamp on everything they do, and a little extra sweetness seems to go with this. Check it out, as it's highly drinkable, but this is a beer to take on its own terms rather than as a representative brew."
"Tasty for sure, but rather underwhelming."
"First sip...sweetness. Then heat. Lots of heat. As I take the few sips thereafter, the heat subsides as my palate has grown accustomed to it, and finds the vast array of flavors. Caramel drizzled coconut peaches...? Yah. A spicy pine sap twang from the hops and we're into the alcohol, leaving behind a mellow sweetness. And a warm belly. Still has a bit of carbonation after its stay in the cellar, and right now the mouthfeel is excellent. Very drinkable at this age, though it's still a bit hot. Certainly one to sample and enjoy after a year or so, but I'm guessing this is sublime with 2+ on it. Wish I had more. Fresh, this must be a hootenanny for the head. An...excellent night...cap....zzz..."
"D: Bit cloying and over the top. Bit too sweet and sugary."
"I really like this barley wine, but there is no way I would be able to drink more than on in a sitting. I would love to get more and follow the alternate instructions on the bottel, ""Walk hand-in-neck into the middle of the woods. Use a shovel to dig a 2x2 hole three feet deep. Seal the bottle in a plastic bag. Place in hole and pack with dirt. Memorize location and leave. Return exactly one year later. Dig up and enjoy."""
"Thin mouthfeel yet smooth palate coating. Alcohol makes this one a one or two and done type of beer."
"Style Guidelines? We ain't got no guidelines. We don't need no stinkin' guidelines!!!"
"D - Perfect. Obviously not drinkable at all in the session sense but completely perfect in the wow this is awesome stuff sense. So much complexity that I keep wanting sip after sip."
"Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine pours an orange/copper color with an off-white head. The aroma is fruity and a bit spicy. Very interesting taste, on the first sip I feel absolutely bombarded with a multitude of flavors. Fruit is definitely there, so is the alcohol, I feel like I can light my breath on fire, warming for sure. Some diacetyl toward the back. It becomes hoppier as it warms. I think this one isn't terribly drinkable, in that I sure couldn't drink another one and it's going to take me a while to finish the first. Definitely an interesting beer though, worth a try."
"High alcohol, but by the style it is very drinkable. Just sip on this one."
"This is thoroughly drinkable, there's just really nothing special about this in my opinion."
"Not as complex as I hoped it would be and something about the aroma doesn't really do it for me...peas, beats...I don't know, seems very young. Definately have this around room temperature to experience all the good qualities of this ""barleywine"". Could be a lot better though I think...maybe it just needs some time in the cellar."
"I am very excited to be reviewing this tonight as I have no recolection of reviewing a barley wine, and I have an inexplicable draw to DFH. It poured, with a bit of chill haze, a bit of a peach / orange colour with a 2 finger foamy white head with medium sized bubbles. The head subsided in a few minutes to a thin white frost which leaves a decent looking ring of lace on the sides of the glass. I thought the smell was magnificent!! Very fruity and sweet, it certainly tempted me. I was not expecting such fruit. The taste, too, was sweet and fruity, but nearly as sweet as the smell, which is good, seeing that that would probably have been overpowering. There is a bit of noticeable alcohol, but at 15%, I think DFH did a fabulous job concealing such power!! Very manageable to be so strong. The mouthfeel is certainly heavy, and quite honestly, nearly syrupy, but I like it. I do not really have another Barleywine with which to compare this one, but as simply ""a beer"" this is a fantastic brew..."
"This was a beer I could savor and enjoy every sip. I guess it is the most savory barleywine I have had to date. It had decent carbonation, and the alcohol was not too overwhelming. Another great one from DFH."
"1-30-08: Can't say it has improved, really. Nice brandy-cordial aroma with plenty of heat. A lot of honeyed caramel malt and the sugary dates and figs add a nice complexity. Has developed an appealing, gentle sour note on the tongue with a nice bit of date in the finish. Honey malt coats the lips after sipping. I think it's the dates that give an impression of honey here."
"Coats your mouth with awesome, about an inch thick. Suprisingly easy on the head for 15%. Make sure you have this when its warmed some. The great range of aromas really come out as it warms. When its cold they seem very mild. Very good job for a 15% beer I must say."
"A fresh bottle might be brutal but this particular sample had no brutality to it. I'd get this again."
"Slightly red tinged golden, no head, no lacing. Almost looks innocent. So clear, so simple looking. Doesn't really smell frightening or alcoholic... some fruityness, a hint of chocolateyness, almost cocoa. Tastes chocolatey and sweet- a bit winey- and very, very sneaky. Warming, quite warming. The 15% just sneaks right by you, you'd never know. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but I'd expect it to be. Drinkable for something this strong to be sure. Not something to chug or have every night... but when in the mood, I'd go for this."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Immort Ale on steroids. Basically the same color, burnt orange. Pours a bit on the syrupy side, though not as thick as a Samichlaus. Good aroma. Lots of fruit, apricot, peach?. I like the taste, but unlike some other barleywines, the 15% abv won't let you make a session of this. Has a bit of an alcohol burn to start. That dwindles after a bit and the sweetness of this brew starts to dominate. Actually, it's a bit too sweet. It also has a decent amount of carbonation for a barley. This is a good one to pair with some cheese or any other food that would subdue the sweetness and alcohol. However, I'd take an Immort Ale over this. Maybe, as the bottle writing suggests, this needs to be buried in a hole for a few years. Then, maybe all that goes into brewing this will meld together a bit better."
"Below average drinkability for a 15% abv beer. I think the mouthfeel and lack of balance definitely work against it."
"This is a fantastic Barley Wine that incorporates its walloping 15% ABV very well. Obviously not huge drinkability here, but a real treat that I'll be coming back for again. Just not in the same session. It packs a punch."
"I bought a 4-pack. So I will be aging 2 bottles. I will definetly be wrting once I try those two beers."
"For a Barley Wine this is incredibly easy to drink. From the scent I feared that this would be sugary but it is not. And a surprise considering who makes it this isn't a hop bomb. Super tasty brew that I do recommend."
"Olde School poured a clear, light amber color with a tiny head that stuck to the side of the glass. The nose was very sweet, with notes of honey, fruit and a faint hop aroma. Taste was extremely sweet, almost like drinking a glass of honey, with a nice alcohol burn in the finish. Hop bitterness was present but kind of restrained for an American barleywine. The sweet, fruity taste was way too overpowering for my palate. At times this beer reminded me of a mead. Did the brewery release this too early? This is the first beer from Dogfish Head that has disappointed me and I hope to hell it doesn't happen again. I've got 2 more bottles of this brew that I plan on cellaring for a year and see if it improves with age."
"This beer if you can call it that, I would say it is more of a wine. It is a barleywine so I guess it is both. The taste of this drink is truly amazing. The color and smell is also appealing. I would recommend this drink to anyone that likes stronger beers."
"Drinkability: This is a dangerously drinkable brew. This beer is a big and bad. The alcohol may be a bit boisterous for some peoples taste but I want more."
"Poured an exceptionally clear orange hued coppery color into two snifters as directed by bottle directions. Left a thin, white half finger head even with a rougher pour, left thin sticky lacing. Aroma is sweet, smells richly of caramel malt, with a nice fruitiness, along with hints of hops and alcohol also present. Taste begins sweet and fruity, then bready/grainy, then leaves off with a nice hoppy bitterness, along with a slight nip of alcohol. The 15% abv is hidden very,very well, one could easily mistake it for far less as sweet and smooth as this barleywine is. Mouthfeel is moderate to heavier bodied, coating the mouth with an oil-slick feeling afterwards. Light on carbonation, slight bitter aftertaste. Frighteningly drinkable, admirably complex. This is my first and far from last barleywine. Overall another enjoyable offering from the folks at Dogfish Head. Would seek out again."
"drinkability: scary...be very, very careful. It goes down too smoothly."
"Poured a soft brown color with orange & copper hues and a mighty white colored head that remained intact for sometime. Aromas of alcohol and citrus seemed to dominate, though some pine and earthy scents were present, though faint. The taste was semi-sweet with a fair amount of hop bitterness upfront. The sweet, roasted malts came out nicely in the tail end of each sip with a lingering dryness in the finish. The alcohol was hidden to a certain extent in that did not overly dominate the flavors in the beer as I thought it might with such a high ABV. The mild carbonation and fruity flavors coated my mouth nicely, but the drinkability just wasn't there for me. I'm glad I shared this 12 oz. bottle, because I wouldn't have been able to finish it. Interesting to try, but not a great barleywine."
"The only hesitancy I have to give the drinkability a perfect 5 is that there's nothing too amazing in the sensation of drinking it. This beer would definately benefit from aging - the cleanliness should allow some pronounced flavors without anything nasty happening. Perhaps after a year this'll be a perfect barley wine. Beermail me if you know where some is being sold (Boston area)."
"12 ounce bottle. Either an 03 or an 04, impossible to tell, let's say it is an 04."
"Pours a wonderful amber color with a very small amount of white head that quickly retreated leaving a ring around the glass and somewhat spotty lacing. Smell of apricots, figs, oranges, vanilla, and some brown sugar. Taste starts out with orange and apricot, then turns to a more caramel and brown sugar flavor, finishing with some darker fruits of which plum and raison seem to be most noticeable and a hint of piney hops and alcohol warmth at the very end. Mouthfeel is heavy, but seems to be about right with very little carbonation. A very enjoyable drink, but one to be enjoyed in moderation."
"This is as ""drinkable"" as 15% can get. A remarkable, delicious effort from DFH. I don't like everything they make, but this is truly magnificent."
"Aroma is light and somewhat hoppy. Opaque orange in color. Very still with no head. Much more fruity and wine tasting than most Barleywines I have had. Lacks the oxidization I find off putting. Alcohol is definitely there, but amazingly well hidden. There is a fruity flavor through all flavor ranges, but if I didnt know dates and figs were used I wouldnt have guessed those two. Another amazingly unique beer by DFH."
"This is a one incredible nectar, and nectar is the perfect word for it. The biggest little brewery that could...rock on Dogfish."
"Overall - an outstanding American barleywine. Highly recommended."
"The beer after its disinterment from the 12-ounce brown bottle a clarion amber with a monstrous light tan head that is creamy in texture with the left over lace a tight girdle that clings to the glass like Ebenezer Scrooge to a gold sovereign. Nose has a nice malt presence a hint of hops, sweet like vanilla taffy. Start is also sweet with a good grain presence and the top moderate in feel. Finish is adequately acidic, the alcohol noticeable and the hops subdued, dry and pleasing to the palate, what can I say about Dogfish Head beers accept I loveem, and they do so good with DISCO Music. Lol"
"Would love to try this a.) again tomorrow with sweet & sour pork, b.) a year from now after it has had a long sleep, and / or c.) a combination of a+b."
"Drinkability: Taste when only three months old, this brew shows some very interesting character and unusual flavor; I'll look forward to seeing what this is like with some age on it"
"It is drinkable in the sense that you can definitely enjoy one but more than that is a little rough on the palate. An overwhelming beer."
" Age has done this one well. The somewhat cloying sweetness of fresh Olde School has dryed to a smooth malt flavor. The hops that are left seem floral, and this tastes more like an English barleywine to me. Mouthfeel is heavy, a little syrupy, I like it. Highly drinkable in what may be middle-age for this beer."
"This is definitely has the characteristic flavors of Dogfish Head's other higher alcohol beers; the intense sweet malt and fruit character. This is pretty good, but seems to be missing a lot of complexity that would make this more fittingly a contemplative sipping brew that the alcohol level demands."
"A really like the mouthfeel. The carbonation make for a pleasant experience. The alcohol will rear its head in the end as the beer warms. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I think I will try this one in another year to see if the flavor improves. Hopefully, it will."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: For a brew weighing in at 15%, it certainly does not seem like it. I can note the alcohol in the flavor and in the smell, but my senses pick up something more like 9% or 10%. Cheers to DFH for producing a beer with a well-concealed ABV. As with a lot of their beers, the price makes me whimper but the product makes me smile."
"Bottled on date of november 11th, 2005: Pours a slightly murky copper color with a thick tan head that retains impressively well for a 15% brew. The aroma is quite malty, with a big rum soaked fruit character (apples, grapes, oranges, plums), some citrus and floral hops, caramel apples, vanilla, toasted bread and ethanol. The flavor starts off with candied fruit soaked in rum, floral citrus and piney hops, toasted bread, vanilla, oak, and a big alcohol wallop. The mouthfeel is medium, with moderate body and light carbonation, and the finish is a bit sweet and alcohol ridden. Drinkability is better than i expected, DFH did well concealing the alcohol in this, though it is still very present. An interesting barleywine, not over the top hoppy like many, could definately age for a few years."
"This pours a amber color with a nice creamy head.The color is lighter than other barleywines and the head disappears too fast.The smell is alcohol filled with sugar,malt,and hops.The taste has a very strong sweetness to it that dominated.The taste is like baking sugar.There's not the fruit taste that other barleywines have.There's also a carmel and alcohol aftertaste that make this a little rich.It's a good taste,but it's really nothing special.The m/f is medium and not really well balanced.This is a good beer,but I really thought a barleywine from Dogfish Head would be better."
"Pours a clear copper with plenty of carbonation. Leaves no head, just a slight soapy ring around the top of the glass with nice lacing. Smell of carmelized sugar. Tastes are of sweet alcohol with slight bitter and fruityness (it may be the color but apple maybe?). Medium to heavy mouthfeel, carbonation still very present. Pretty drinkable but I expected more from DFH. Not very impressive or exciting."
"Very nice, bright, coppery, golden color. Nice amount of bubbles slowly rising to the top. Mellow, low aroma. Slight hopiness to it. Underlying malty sweetness-mustiness in there as well. Big malt flavor. Nicely (and lightly) hopped. Great caramel flavors. Slight alcohol tinge. Killer body-thick and viscuous though not overly so. The whole package is really well balanced here. A fantastic brew. Really has become quite the beer from the sample I had 3 years ago. A real sipper. I find myself wanting to take large tastes to really enjoy it and after half a glass I can feel its effects. Damn good beer."
"This barleywine poured a golden amber color with plenty of caronation and no head. The aroma suprised me; almost a white-wine nose, a little like the Russian River I rated a while back. Obviously a different style and brewery but just a faint resemblance. Anyhow, atop the white wine thing was apple, spice, yeast and major hoppy tones. I was dying to dive right in, but was somewhat disappointed; the wine taste was gone; replaced by a good ammount of very obvious alcohol, sweet malts, flowery hops, possibly vanilla, and (please excuse going way out on a limb) a mild taste of over-ripe bananas. It was very carbonated and biting, but that, along with the taste slightly improved as it warmed."
"Cheers!"
"Is it drinkable? Yes, very much so. Is it special? No. I am surprised at this DFH offering, it is one of the least spectacular offerings I have had from them. Still, with that said, this is a good barleywine. It wouldnt make my personal Top 10 but I will like to try it again. I hope I can. I got my bottle from RedHaze. Thank you very much. I did enjoy every drop! Worth a try."
"looks of a fresh-pressed apple juice, clear with some voluminous force-pour bubbles and not much else, no real lacing either. nose is boozy, bubblegum hints and some cinnamon. mild hoppiness is lost to the scotch-like aroma. light and mild flavors. burns a bit going down, but leans on the crutch of ginger notes, apricot and hop resin. raw malts and sweet syrupy blotches round out the bizarre flavor variety found within. i remember this being buttery and limp- it's transformed itself into a fruity, explosive masterpiece. will drink as much fresh as i can get my hands on."
"Drinkability: Any beer that says to split it into two snifters on the label must be a whopper, and this one assuredly is. Definitely a sipper, to be enjoyed slowly and allow to warm. Thanks to Px2Grafx for a sample of a beer that I have wanted to try for a long time."
"Is this fun or what?"
"Highly flocculant yeast - hardly stirred at all. As a result the pour was very clear but I swirled and added yeast back. The beer had rather low head. The color was a deep golden. The aroma was sweet, with a honey note and some kind of citrusy notes too, like lemon rather than the cascade type of citrus- almost wine-like. The flavor was dominated by sweetness, almost cloying, with a touch of bitterness at the end. The beer seemed a little one-dimensional, and was a little disappointing. It was smooth, though, for the alcohol content - maybe too smooth? I couldn't find a bottle date but I suspect it was rather young."
"drinkability: fairly drinkable, heavy on the alcohol"
"Overall: Im not sure how old this is, but it has a beautifully rounded edge to the high alcohol, malts and hops. Oh this is so bloody good..it went down way too quickly for a double digit brew, it could be an early night for me..a big ass brew that would suit me just right if I was back in England tonight sat in thy dark round the Bonfire celebrating the 400th Anniversary of Guy Fawkes failed Gunpowder Plot. 15% you say?."
"Either way its pretty good.key word is SIPPING. I downed this beer in 30min as I often do from constant sipping to find the flavor ect...now I feel buzzed."
"More drinkable than I expected, but I will not likely have this often."
"It may be too sweet and alcoholic for some persons (like my wife, who does not like it, but is thinking of it as beer rather than a wine, apertif or brandy like drink). I am glad that I have more in the cellar !"
"I's surprisingly easy to drink, for such a ""big beer"". My face is warm already, and I've only had 2/3 of a bottle to drink."
"12 oz bottle which I've had for 3 months---no date though so I don't know the age. Pours a golden orange with a thin white cap of head, no lacing at all. Nose is a sweet molasses and caramel with a note of dark fruitiness and just a hint of the alcohol about to be consumed. Taste starts out rich and sweet, blends of molasses, candi sugar, plums, and raisins and then a nice smooth rising hoppy bitterness hits in the middle of a sip with a long smooth warming finish with just a hint of the 15% alcohol. Extremely complex tastes balanced beautifully to give a great sipping experience. Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and syrupy. This is a good sipping barleywine that hides its alcohol well. I don't think I could have more than one in a session, but I will definitely be revisiting this beer again."
"Pours a very clear golden, small head, little bit of lacing, nice legs. Smell is alcohol, citrus, apple, lots of malt, honey sweetness, the smell is just out of control and amazing. Taste is sweet malt, some alcohol, white grapes, apples, tons of citrus hops. Very smooth for such a big guy, mouthfeel is medium, dry bitter finish. This one powerful bastard, almost knocked me on my ass first sip. Excellent."
"Mostly clear, medium amber beer with a bit of an orange hue. Thin white head that's a combination of fine foam and large bubbles. Nice lacing and good head retention. Big, malty aroma with lots of caramel and moderate alcohol. Fresh apple fruit character is prominent as well. Nice balance of flavours for such a big beer. Lots of malt sweetness with just enough bitterness to keep it in check. There's also a fruity, grape flavour that adds some complexity. Alcohol flavour is apparent throughout, but becomes more pronounced and spicy at the sweetish finish. Low, soft carbonation with a full body, somewhat lighter than expected. Mellow mouthfeel with plenty of alcohol warmth and a bit of residual sugar that leaves it slightly sticky. Surprising drinkable given the abv, definitely a big, strong brew. I bet this one ages like a champ. Thanks Viggo!"
"Impressively smooth considering the alcohol content and the hop additions. It picks up on all the plumb-ey, prune-ey, dates, and figs that I expect in a BW. The hop flavors are pronounced, but not overly agressive like most. This makes for an impresively easy drinking beer. I get some molassas and honey flavors into the body and through the finish that I like. Although the flavors are better balanced, this is by no means a lighter BW. It still packs a punch in the flavor, alcohol, and body categories. it's just better balances and aged."
"Mmmm... Good Beer, Good Night."
"Not really sure what to think of with the olde school barleywine label. This is one of the only clear blonde barleywine's I've seen recently, besides Anchor's. Does that make it oldeschool?"
"Drinakability is nice very easy drinking hard to imagine that it is 15% this beer is to way easy to drink could lead to trouble. Didn't know if I would like this after my Immport Ale tasting, but this kicks ass not your normal Barley Wine to be sure. After two the buzz might be going to my head a little but I like this and would recommend buying some if you can."
"A nice beer, but I tend to prefer barley wines with a butt load of hops assaulting me."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy. Heavier in body. The finish is syrupy with a long caramel alcohol finish. Drinkability is not bad, but one bottle was enough in one sitting. A sweeter barleywine than others, but worth trying."
"taste was syrupy on the tongue but not overly sweet at all, sugary, caramel sweetness up front that hits with a earthy flavor that I could not place and finishes slightly dry but not really. hard to explain. This is a sipper at 15% so be careful. Not my favorite Barley but very enjoyable"
"I am impressed with the balance when using such massive malt and hop elements, the alcohol is well hidden and this means easy sippin! Thanks Joe for the treat."
"Poured a golden orange color with a fluffy off white head that took its time to fall to a rather thick film on top. This left wonderful lacing down my glass. The smess was of fruits like peaches, cherries, and flowers all smashed into one. There was also a bit of alcohol present in the smell as well. The taste was sweet with apricots, peaches, and candy. It has a slight hoppy finish and a touch of alcohol was present, but VERY well hidden. The mouthfeel was full, rich, and very satisfying. I can say that his was pretty darn good. Very enjoyable brew. Thanks Dogfish for another winner!"
"Finishes sticky sweet, with a bit of tartness. The head begins to warm....though pretty drinkable. The ABV is ninja like in its stealthiness."
" Absolutely an Outstading barleywine, the 15% making all the more remarkable. It reminds me of my fave BW, JW Lee's ( pick a year -still my fave) Harvest Ale. Maybe not quite as mellow and refined but close."
"I cannot not believe I havent rated this before I have been drinking this for at least 8 months but I am glad I waited because it as gotten better as it aged in the old basement cellar. poured a nice honey with a nice white head with good lacing. aroma, hops, sugar, malts, grassey. alcohol, musty, citrus ( lemon ). flavor, hops, mats, semi sweet grapefruit and the alcohol comes out nicely. going to have to buy more of this just to have it age for a while"
"Drinkability: Good for the style. It would be most unwise to persue this olde brew at length, but it is certainly tempting. A nice primer for things to follow, or a night cap to warm the spirit."
"I'm going to chase this with a Bell's Third Coast Old Ale to reassociate my tongue with a real barleywine."
"This beer pours an amber color with a small head that falls quickly and leaves very little lacing on the glass. The aroma had a lot of caramel and dark fruits with some alcohol. The alcohol is very upfront in the flavor, but this is very new - it needs some age. Has a nice hop character and caramel malt sweetness. The drinkability is a little harsh because of the high alcohol, but still not too bad. Mouthfeel is right on."
"Tastes like malted grape fruit juice. Hoppy in the finish with the abv well hidden. Light mouthfeel for the style. Drinkable if it wasn't for the high abv, and equally high price ($4.99+ a bottle)."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown color ale with a medium head with medium retention. Carbonation is above average for a barley wine and body is a bit thin for the style. Aroma consisted of dates and figs with strong malt. Taste is quite enjoyable with some sweetness (but not too much) balance well against the malt and hops. Finish is slightly dry with some subtle water, which did disappoint me. Alcohol is not really discernable. Overall, I guess this is a good barley wine but I had some better one."
"	Like most high alcohol beers, it has only a very slight head to it (why is that, by the way?), but unlike most, it left an appreciable amount of foam lace on the glass. Glancing at my glass, I could just as easily guess that I was drinking a hopdevil. It doesn't seem as viscous as most barleywines. Not an especially distinctive beer (hey, they do call it Olde School), especially coming from Dogfish, but very enjoyable."
"Pours a light copper to golden, rather light for a barley wine. Creates thousands of bubbles that cling to the sides of my snifter as I give it a swirl. Looks quite thick. Smells of sweet, sweet apricots. Flavor is also sweet and the alcohol is very present here. There are some citrus notes and apricot is found again. This is thick and sticky, leaves a coat on the palate as it goes down, pleasantly warming. Wow, this beer is freaking huge, I can drink one and its enjoyable... but thats about as far as I'd go."
"I must say that I've had better barleywines but this one is unique and still quite good. It could afford to be a little darker and a little less fruity."
"Dogfish Head should get credit for expanding the definition of an American Barley Wine with this offering. There is a mix of styles here that amount to a well balanced beer."
"At $4.99 for 12 ounces, it's a splurge, but it *is* special."
"Thanks again to IrishMike for the chance to try this one...surprised I've let this one go for so long."
"It poured with a pure caramel body that was crystal clear. Quite a beauty. The head was nice, big, and creamy. The mouthfeel is very heavy and syrupy. Great complexity to the taste. I first notice a casky flavor with a whiskey-type edge to it. But its also balanced with a smooth and creamy vanilla subtleness. It really accentuates the great balance. The finish is a little more figgy and somewhat vinous. Unexpectedly, there's also some nice hop bitterness going on that is countered nicely with a candy sweetness. A great belly warming offering that you must be sure not to drink to quickly. Complex and divine!"
"Pours a creamy orange with a thin white head. Doesn't look a thing like a barleywine. The smell is a rich, but oddly hop focused one. The alcohol is mild. In the taste, the alcohol is also hardly present, and only rounds off the beer. What got me about this beer was the fact that it wasn't really a barleywine. It was more like and over-the-top Tripel. And that's not what I want in a barleywine. I'll still give cheers to Dogfish Head for always pushing the envelope."
"Overall, not at all what I was expecting and certainly not what I would call an ""old school"" barley wine..."
"Drinkability is decent given the youth of this beer. If I close my eyes and pretend that I'm drinking brandy, then it's quite smooth. I wish I would have aged it another year or two to bring-out more of the subtle flavors that lurk underneath the alcohol, but it was still good. Not a session beer, but certainly a fine product."
"Pours a murky bronze orange color with a thin, small white head. Kind of ugly really but whatever. Aroma is sweet and hoppy. Citrus is there and a belgian candi sugar flavor along with smoke and then lots of alcohol. The taste brings about a whiskey kick almost immediately. This goes with a woody earthiness that brings some oak and vanilla. Was this aged in JD barrels or some kind of whiskey barrel? Dark fruits are there along with lighter fruits. The finish finally brings some brash bitterness and more fusel alcohol. Long lingering finish. Could definitely be a sipper. Could definitely age another year as well. Maybe ten years. But really, its quite good fresh, I like the boldness of this beer!"
"beautiful golden orange, smell of dried fruit, citrus, spices....sweet, not overly, amazingly drinkable for 15%abv; tiny pricks of carbonation, thick luscious mouthfeel, zingy peppery finish. complex and delicious. certainly one of a kind, a highly original take on the barleywine. first class!"
"The drinkability suffered a bit due to the high buzz factor and the sugary sweet taste, and I cannot see drinking much more than a single pint of this on any given night."
"This one needs to evolve. My slightly burning chest bellows, Cellar this beer. I have had a good amount of better barley wines but this baby needs time."
"This is a very good cold weather beer, even with the high alcohol, it is masked so well that this beer goes down easily and is quite enjoyable in the process."
"D- Very clean beer but a bit to hot compared for the hops. It would be nice to see some more depth to the hops or malt in this one."
"For once, Dogfish has made a beer and done the exact opposite of what they're infamous for; making crazy interpretations on a classic style. Not to say this brew is bad by any means, but as it stands this beer has no fatal flaws, but nor does it do anything to distinguish itself from the rest. In all honesty, i don't even think this is a true barleywine, but that's just my humble opinion. Good, but not great."
"Temperatures dropped rapidly tonight, when I finally made it in out of the elements I found myself craving a nice solid barleywine to warm me up. I knew Olde School would do the job with its whopping 15% ABV. Ive grown found of drinking Barleywines out of shaker pints (something about the way it warms up, and the feeling of having all that barleywine under your nose at once) so thats what this one went into. The body of this beer is a bit more translucent and less red than many other barleywines Ive seen. Still with the tiny bottle-conditioned carbonation bubbles streaming to the top, it is a sight to see. The robust eggshell head from the pour rapidly recedes into a solid ring around the outside of the pint. The nose is heavy with fusel alcohol aromas, doesnt turn me off though. A closer whiff reveals figs, nuts, berries, grapefruit and pine. This beer is rich with hefty malt flavors across the front of the palate (caramel, grain, toffee). The bitterness level is great, exactly what I look for in a good barleywine and the pine and grapefruit hop flavors are very assertive as well . I also pick up some nuttiness , berries and figs in the flavor, this is right before alcohol crashes on my tongue and hits my nose from the inside out. Warmth rapidly (and welcomely) spreads down my gullet. Personally I think this is a great barleywine. I will say that I love strong beers, but even I feel that the alcohol could be masked a little better here, then again at 15% what should I expect!?"
"Had again 4 years later and found it rather ordinary barleywine, withd ecent mouthfeel and drinakbility."
"Highly recommended!"
"It gets beyond mellow while it sits. I poured this at about 50 degrees and as it got up to room temprature it was super mellow. Very super mellow. Real nice quality to have as it seems to get more drinkable as you go yet as soon as it hits the lips it demands you sip. Interesting charactistic. This is a seemingly complexing alcoholic beverage that does hide its beefy ABV very well. Its not all that overly heated or alcoholic/boozy, its quite brazenless in that regards. Its smooth and creamy body is a wonderment and maintains a favorable slick texture. Good stuff. Sooo very close to getting the next number up."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a honey golden color with a thin white head. Seems pretty light colored for a barleywine. Head disappears quickly. Fruity notes present, as well as pine and lots of alcohol. Apricots, mangos and other citrusy fruits. There is some hop bitterness maybe in a pine flavor, but not as much as I expected. Medium body, low carbonation. Did not seem to be 15% ABV. As others have noted, the alcohol is well hidden. NOt as over the top as I thought, and maybe a little disappointing."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and silky with very little carbonation. Very big bodied and mouth-coating. Finish is smooth and like creamy caramey with a tinge of piney hops. This certainly doen't taste like a 15% beer, alcohol is too well hidden. This is dangerous and delicious. One of the best aged barleywines I'v had!"
"This is an easy drinking high alcohol brew. The alcohol is well balanced and sneaks up on you rather quickly."
"Pours a deep gold to bronze color with some light orange highlights. Active light beige colored head. Stickily malty sweet with some confectionary nuances come through at times. Sappy, hoppy nose among the all the nostril burning fusel alcohols. Whewee this is strong. No hiding the brandy-like burn in the finish. I little sticky up-front; the transition to alcohol burn is introduced nicely by hoppy dryness. Seems a tad bit overcarbonated with its champagney mouthfeel, but it works well to complement the high alcohol level. A good barleywine, but too robust in alcohol and not in the other areas that make up a great barleywine."
"A big and boozy example of a barley wine. It had a lot of promise I really wish I could've sat on it for a while longer. Patience is something I lack."
"Drinkability: Come on now, it's 15%. To put it into perspective, it's like filling your glass with 12 oz. of Apple Pucker. Yes, you winced, and you should have. However, this isn't Apple Pucker. At the same time, it's surely not something to mess with. It's ""beer"" indeed, but some have said it has the more qualities in line with a brandy or bourban, and to a certain degree I agree. Now that I think about it though (especially if you're just buying a 4-pack, because since it's a seasonal / limited Dogfish Head brew it comes in 4-packs), I'd suggest letting it rest in the fridge for at least a day. Then break it out, let it rest outside the fridge for 15 minutes, pour it into a glass, take huge whiffs of both the empty bottle right after poured and the glass right after it's filled, sip slowly, and enjoy both the power and the complex tastes and aromas."
"Hiding this much alcohol in a beer is quite a feat. I could drink this all night if I had the liver of 10 men."
"A decent beer overall, but way overpriced at almost $5.00 for a 12oz. bottle! Might be better served at room temperature."
"This beer reminded me a lot of a kicked up version of Victory Golden Monkey."
"Bender: WOW. The 15 ABV is well hidden. I can honestly see myself drinking a 4 pack and waking up naked in the front yard cudding a duck."
"This one is an orangish-golden color. It is quite opaque for its color. There is very little white head to it, which drops off rather quickly. Very potent aroma. It is a sweet malt with fruity nuances. A hint of sourness comes up also. The taste is superb. Quite a rich taste. The malts are strong, but the sweetness is diminished. I get a bit of a whisky tinge to the taste. It does not come through as an alcohol bite as some do. In fact, I have had much more alcohol taste in 7% beers than this. This is really superb."
"So friggin smooth at 15% ABV. You'll find the strength of this beer hard to believe. This is one mastpiece of a Barelywine."
"impressed. worth checking out. nice warmth for those winter nights at home by the fire. the alcohol in this does sneak right up on you."
"Pours a clear copper which is almost golden when held up to a light. There is a small white head that dissipates rather quickly, with good lacing. Aroma is very candy sweet. Figs, plums, raspberry and strawberry preserves (and preserved they are in 15% alcohol). The taste carrys some of the familiar fruity sweetness from the nose along with a spicy alcohol interlude which reminds you to show respect. In the back end you have the lovely barley taste I look for in the style with just enough hops to balance the whole thing out. I was honestly expecting a hoppier beer because its from DFH and its another one of their ""big beers", but I wasn't entirely let down, there's enough acidity to make up for the hops I'm missing. The moutfeel is thick, slick and ""chewy"" all at once. This one coats everything from the lips down like a fine brandy. Drinkability is high considering this beer is 30 proof. Hop it up some and this would easily increase that to a 5 (as well as some of the other columns as well)."
"First off, thanks to clvand0 for sharing this beer with me. The beer pours a deep golden amberish color with head that covers over the beer. The nose is all about figs covered in caramel and a good deal of alcohol. The first thing I got was a burst of alcohol, but upon swallowing the beer, there is a nice caramel sweetness and there is an odd bitterness on the back of my tongue that I don't really like. Its almost soapy. The beer is pretty thick and smooth. Overall a nice offering. Drinkability is not as good as it could be, but what do you want from a big ass beer? This is not the best DFH beer I've had, but its overall a good beer."
"Poured into a large snifter, this beer is remarkably clear and light in color for a barleywine. What foam is created with the pour falls to ring of bubbles. The first whiff of the aroma is full of an intense malt, with some sawddust-like phenolic notes. I like my stronger beers to have some more intense aromatics than usual and this Olde School Barleywine fits the bill. The first sip is thick, but not cloying, with a slick finish. A slight warming effect from the alcohol (I would expect more this sensastion in such a strong brew) with the intense maltiness found in a fine Scotch. The flavors of this elixir have more in common with bourbon than beer. That's not a bad thing. Think of a highly attenuated Double IPA mixed with a little Scotch whisky and that's what you've got in this beer. I've had some ver full-bodied and complex English barleywines and some powerfully hoppy and complex American barleywines. This beer in neither, and is usual for Dogfish Head, is in a class by itself. It's actually a pretty drinkable beer, for such a high alcohol content, but that's sort of a dangerous thing. Beware: thou art mortal!"
"Clear amber, not much head. Extremely enjoyable aroma, I didnt see that one coming. A fine cigar, a campfire and a deep immort ale like maltiness with all this caramel and maple syrup richness and even some kind of meaty goodness going on. Feels 10% or so, great job there! In mouth: melon bubblegum, soothing oily hops, piney, vegetal which develops sip after sip into a larger and larger tongue-coating bitterness. Nevertheless, those huge malts never miss a meeting, it remains very sweet (caramel.. smoked maple), just very bitter at the same time and in good proportions. Oily fuelic body, fair amount of carbonation. Adopt an hypercaloric beer today."
"This came from the bottle into a snifter a deep copper color. Many DFH beers have this copper tint, but this is just a shade darker. It had a full rich white head the receded quickly, but several champagne bubbles tried to renew the head from the bottom of the glass. A swirl of the glass or a tip to drink left a thick sheet of lace. I get lots of fruit on the nose; a hint of citrus, but maybe some apples (from the malt perhaps?). The taste has more of the citrus/apple flavor, but it also introduces some floral/pine character of the hops in the front of the taste, malt after that, with just a touch of candy, and a very mild hop bite along with just a touch of alcohol bite. Surprisingly light mouth feel. This has a big alcohol kick, but is very drinkable despite that. One of the best if this style Ive had from a bottle."
"ng"
"Reflection: If you know someone who has tried a Barley Wine and didn't like the style, this would be a great beer to get them to try. Its not your average Barley Wine and its a really great beer."
"Taste is very sweet: honey dipped, tropical fruit candy. Turns to butterscotch rum. Hops come in but are quite modest. Sweetness overpowers bitterness in this showdown. Alcoholic finish. Warming. A little cloying, butterscotch sweetness. Syrupy, big body feel. Interesting BW, but maybe a little too sweet for me."
"Drinkability? There's something taboo about drinking first thing in the morning. And I don't think I'd want too much of this beer."
"Drinkability  This is a big ABV monster in its rawest form, although I would guess that this would diminish with cellaring, which is probably highly recommended. In its purest form this one will give you hop burps and a hangover."
"Medium amber/tan body with a light foam head that fades to a weather pattern. The aroma is heavy on the overriped bananas. Combined with the bit of caramel and other malt aromas, its like smelling a batch of fresh-baked banana pudding. Im not picking up much on the figs, but I do get a bit of date action in the flavor. Very fruity. Edges on being too sweet, though. Very interesting beer, but being interesting is never a problem for Dogfish Head."
"12 ounces, served at room temperature, from a goblet. I couldnt find a vintage date on the bottle. The beer is light-orange color with an appropriately small, white head. A slight haze is notable due to bottle conditioning. An intense maltiness and alcohol aroma are immediately detectable if your nose is anywhere near the beer. The smell is really something: intense sensations of alcohol steeped fruits (plums, apples, berries, figs), molasses, sugar, grain. Hop aromas are present, but restrained (East Coast Barleywine?). Although the smells are strong and agreeable, they lack the depth and smooth layering that some barleywines present. Instead, they seem rough-edged and jumbled together. Sweet, thick, syrupy, spicyvery nice taste. Its certainly mouth-coating and heavy. Also, the alcohol is at a point where it can almost become tongue-numbing. Finish is moderately hoppy and bitter, but restrained for the stylethe alcohol plays a notable part in the hind-taste. I really enjoyed this brew.I want to see what some aging will do to the aroma."
"This guy is trouble. Very tough to believe it's 15% abv. I'd grab another pint or two, but I'd probably be put on my ass. A treat and a must try if you like the style."
"Poured a cloudy copper-orange color with a thin white head that had good retention, and leaving a little lace. Noticable carbonation streaming from the bits of sediment. Aroma was very sweet, much like an apple cider. Sweet malts and a bit of alchohol blend perfectly with the very fruity nose. Flavor is much like the aroma, but with a richer bouquet of fruit aspects which range from apple and concord grapes to a darker, plum-like malty finish. Slight warmth on the throat is the only sign of the very high ABV, which is attractively higher than many other barleywines that I have tried. Mouthfeel is heavy and syrupy, and this aspect is balanced nicely by the high level of fine carbonation. I'll be damned if I am not hugely tempted also by the label's suggestion to bury a couple bottles to allow them to age - that would make for an exciting little time capsule. One of the best barleywines I have ever had, hands down."
"I had high hopes for this high octane barleywine but was disappointed by the beer's lack of complexity. While I'm certain that it took a fair amount of skill to veil the 15% abv it seemed although the resulting brew was rather lackluster. The golden brown ale formed a fair amount of head but seemed a bit light in color for the style. The aroma was dominated by alcohol and citrus notes. The flavor was built on a creamy sweet malt body with a cloying amaretto hop presence and a noticeable (but not 15% noticeable) alcohol presence. It was a medium bodied, slippery and slimy brew. A passable brew, but not outstanding. I have a few in my cellar that I'm going to try to age, but can't imagine that much interesting will come from this lackadaisical brew."
"For 15%, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. I'd like to see a bit more bitterness but this is pretty good. I think a little aging could help out."
"Alcohol is a bit over-the-top and assertive, but other than that it's a fairly solid Barley Wine. Definitely worth a try."
"The alcohol here is definitely detectable, but not too bad for 15%. Not all that drinkable right now, but I must stress that I drank this pretty fresh. I think it would benefit greatly from a year or two worth of cellaring."
"Dull clear golden color with a potent alcohol nose. Yummy  great alcohol warmth with a sweetness perfectly maxed out. There is little by the way of complexity. There are elements of an ice bock, mai bock and mead blend. The label instructs you to bury it in the ground and drink it in a year. I dont think this has long-term aging potential but one year aging may cool the alcohol burn. Foodery in Philly."
"12 ounce bottle, with ""bottled in"" dating. Was gonna cellar this one for awhile, but had nothing in the house to review,so I broke down...Alas I need to go beer shopping...This is a sweet, and strong BW. Not very hoppy, mostly sweet fruity notes, alcohol present, but well hidden for 15 %. If yiou love mellow big beers this is a must. high quality sipper, seek and enjoy!"
"Art in a bottle."
"Overall: The taste was not overwhelming nor out of control (which I was expecting for a dogfish head brew), but overall the smoothness of this beer was quite amazing."
"Wonder if the newer years are as good??"
"With the greatness of DFHs other huge beers I was excited to try this and picked up a few 12ozers. This poured a nice deep orange color with a huge frothy head that dropped quickly to a bubbly collar. There was decent lacing left in this as I drank it. HOLY SWEETNESS, the nose is strong with a fruity malt sweetness that almost completely dominates the smell. Even after warming the only other smell I could detect was the slightest hint of alcohol. Taste is much the same as the smell, extremely sweet with fruity malts a little too much so even. Slight earthy hop notes can be found as well, but the 15% sure stays hidden in this one. A nice slightly bitter finish is present to try and tame the sweetness. Olde School has a very full and rich mouthfeel that coats your mouth with sweetness. Insane drinkability for a 15% but the sweetness was starting to be a little much for me by the end of the glass. Overall an excellent barley wine from DFH, I will see what happens with the other bottles in a year or so."
"This is an odd barleywine, yet I am still glad I found it. It pours a dark copper with a decent inch of yellowish-off white head that has moderate retention. The initial smells are of sweet malted barley and light alchohol. The taste is much sweeter than a ""normal"" barleywine, and tastes of vanilla extract and corn syrup / maple syrup with the faintest touch of hops in the finish. Carmelized sugar and some fruity esters of peach and pear come through. The alcohol content sticks out, but not in way you might expect (like fumes burning your nostrils). It lightly warms and makes this immesely filling. The mouthfeel is rich and yet thin, giving the most telltale signs of the high abv. But 15% ? I've had harsher 9% barleywines. Drinkability is very good, but after one bottle the sweetness and the alcohol were getting to be too much. It does go down easily though. I'm very impressed at this offering, and would certainly seek it out again."
"The flavor was rich and smooth malt, but there was a little too much prominence on the alcohol... understandable, given the high ABV of this one. Just a little too much for my taste. Still, a very worthy brew."
"Overall the mouthfeel is right on. It has a very big, thick texture that is filling and inviting. I think that it could probably replace a meal."
"Bursting with sweetness and carbonation, this one warms as it goes down. Alcohol is present, but I would never have guessed 15% when I consumed this (very deceiving, be careful!). An overall well balanced brew with tropical fruit and maple syrup overtones."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a dense 3/4"" white head over the dark golden/honey hued brew. Good lacing, and this offering has a light aroma of pale malts, and slightly fruity aftertaste. Flavor is initially of pale malts, but quickly rounds out with sweetness and a warming alcohol effect. The mouthfeel is SO smooth, you would forget it was 15% except that the warming feeling is like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps going and going. long after the mouthful is gone. Drinkability is high in that I would look for it again, certainly not a repeat in one session, I have a kid now you know, have to set an example..."
"A fine barleywine, and one I wish they would bring back in the 750ml size!"
"Drinkability: This is an excellent beer. It was smooth, easy drinking, and leaves one wanting more. Another winner from Dogfish."
"Taste: Initial prickly carbonation. Oh so complex and delicious. Sweet with being cloying, boozy without being hot. Very juicy and warming. Dry in the finish, and pleasantly bitter from the few living hops that push their way to the surface. Excellent beer. This is what a high ABV beer should be."
"Amber, with a slight head. No over whelming alcohol smell or even hint of the ABV. Actually went down like a regular beer, which can be dangerous. Very slight hop presense. I wonder if anyone actually buries it? I'm thinking I might and did it up in a year. Ultimate cellaring."
"Beyond that, just a classic old school english style barley wine."
"the smell seems to be more berry like with a very fresh strawberry aroma and almosttwizzler-like smell at times. a good amount of melon type aroma too. the taste is also VERY fruity and berry-like. very sweet. the 15% doesn't seems quite as well masked. as it was, but is still well hidden."
" The big abv is well hidden, for the most part, but I would still recommend this one as a nightcap, or dessert sipper. It certainly lacks the hops presence of most westcoast barleywines I've sampled. I would love to try an older vintage of this to see how it ages. This young version reminds me more of a DFH 120 Minute IPA than the minimal number of other barleywines I've tried. Of course, you can make a good argument that the 120 Minute is also a barleywine. All things considered, this Olde School was a very pleasant experience."
"Drinkability is good, love to get this one on draught to draw out more complexity."
"To be honest, this is possibly my favorite barley wine of all time. At 15% this is one of the smoothest beers I have tasted. Pours out a reddish-brown color with a small white head that seems to last. The smell is malt and hops all the way. After the first sip I can't believe this thing is 15%! So smooth and refreshing I could drink it as an IPA. This beer has many dimensions. First you get the malt, the middle brings out the hop flavor and the end is a perfect balance of both. Amazing! I love this beer."
"Yes indeed, it's one more beefy beer from DFH. Sweetness is what it's about but there's just enough elsewhere to make it all interesting. I'd be curious to see where this would come in a year from now, after some aging. It's a smooth enough flavor, but the behemothic ABV goes a long way toward limiting how many you'd want to drink- as in not likely more than one. And yet, while the alcohol comes close to being distracting, overall it's good enough to leave me with a fond memory and keep open the door for another in the future."
"This tastes really good especially when you consider the ABV. This is definately a barley wine that concentrates on barley to achieve its flavors. Not very hoppy. Very fruity with citrusy fruit, overiped but seems to be perfect. The malts provide a flavor that is very sweet with caramel and molasses. This is a very good beer."
"Ahh, other than the rather flat nature of the beer, this seems like it could be quite good, and it doesn't really drink as 15%. Though it's far too sweet to drink all day, this is one I'd have another bottle of in the future."
"Drinkability: A weird and quirky beer, but what else would you expect from DFH. I wonder if this had hop flavors when fresh, cuz it kinda needed them. Not a true barleywine, IMHO, more like some inbred cousin that you keep inviting to the family reunion because they're cool. I'll have to try the most recent issue to see if a fresher batch would be better."
"Low drinkability associated with the unmasked abv, but quite delicious when taken with temperament."
"Thanks Genaro...I'll be hitting that snooze button in the AM!"
"The yeast pour is ugly - clumpy bits that immediately fall to the bottom. Urine note is even more pronounced in the nose. Taste is a bit more orangey."
"Man, thats a sugary barleywine if I've ever had one, yet thats what makes it drinkable enough. Not enough going on, especially compared to a number of recently quaffed barleywines like those from Old Dominion and Smuttynose."
"Pours out almost an orange color with a low amount of carbonation and a small fluffy head that dissipates fairly quickly. Not a lot of aroma, some lemon and even a hint of orange peel... Taste is sweet and a bit tangy, hides the alcohol very well, almost too well. Only the slightest hoppiness to it. Not as complex as I might have expected, but tasty nonetheless. Very drinkable, but at 15% abv, 3.5 is about as high as I can go with it."
"All in all, this is a very nicely put together barelywine. The abv mixes nicely with matly sweetness and occasional hop arrivals is rather pleasent. And, as I posted in a thread in the forum, the lable art so total kicks ass IMO."
"The beer pours a cloudy dark gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a sweet smell offset with a strong hop aroma. It has a bit of a grapefruit scent. The taste is good, considering that it has an abv of 15. It is very sweet and quite strong. It has a malty edge with an equally strong citrous component. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with light carbonation. It drinks slow, but well; a good barleywine."
"Drinkability: One of the sweeter, maltier barleywines and a welcome source of variety for the style. DFH continues to impress the hell out of me."
"The pour....no...the pop of the cork...didn't happen. I'm dissappointed before I can even deal with the ""appearance"". It's pretty but no POP so I look at it with reservation. It's cloudy partly because of a chill haze I assume. I will coax it into warmth. I do so and it's still a little hazy (and still). The taste is good but it would be so much better with bubbles. The cork came out too easily and it wasn't tight. the flavor is good but... I won't buy it again unless I can be assured of carbonation. This brewery makes good beer and this doesn't make the cut. I'm dissappointed."
"Great, awesome."
"Pours a hazy orange brown, most unexpected from a barleywine of this magnitude. Tastes beautiful. Doesn't taste as strong as most barleywines (yeah, that's a little weird, get over it.) Woody, spice tones and good hop character. I wish this was available locally, it'd accompany me to many an outing that I didn't want to go to. Alcohol is hidden well but warms the tummy. This brew is just exquisite!"
"This was another kick-ass brew from DFH. This is a dark orangey colour with some yellow smatterings and a white head. The aromas were heavily malty and hoppy and yet not very boozy. The taste is quite malty, with some nice hoppiness on the finish, but the alcohol is hardly detected. The mouthfeel is thick, but not overly cloying and the drinkability is quite good."
"Overall this is a good one from Dogfish Head, and I would definitely try it again if it was put in front of me!"
"An interesting barley wine that seemed a bit too sweet and full even given the style. This brew is a bit hazy and murky in appearance. The mid-amber color has a somewhat thin cream head and nice lace. The aroma is full and gives great caramel maltiness and some fruit notes, along with the strength of the alcohol. The taste is thickly malt and sweet. The feel is full and syrupy leaving this beer to be only moderately drinkable."
"Pours a murky orange/brown color with a nice sticky head,aroma is malty and buttery with light alcohol notes.Taste is malty and lightly sweet with some burnt fruit flavors ending with a nice buttery taste that lingers in the mouth.Dogfish Head is becoming my favorite east coast brewery (have yet to visit Victory) they pull no punches and make some really good,interesting brews."
"Served on draft at the Moan & Dove in Amherst, MA, this was my first Old School experience. I was impressed. Color was maize I'd say, hazy yellow-brown, not nearly as bold or coppery in color as the traditional barleywine. A little bit of thick creamy head that clings to the edge of the glass. Tantalizing aroma reminiscent of fermented dried fruit, butterscotch, and brandy. Nicely carbonated, but not overly so; designed to slide down easily. Taste- amazing - this is the smoothest barleywine I've ever drank. Deceptively dangerous, you's never know Old School was packing a 15% punch. Very sweet, malty flavor, with excellent balance between spice and fruit. Notes of vanilla and butterscotch blend nicely as well. Closes off with a nice alcohol warmth that doesn't bite back at all. I could easily drink a few of these, as long as I didn't have to drive!"
"Pours a deep amber hazy hue with a nicely formed caramel tan head appeasing appearance with lacing present etched webbed patterns, oh so nice. Aromatics department this beer serves up sharp citrus spritz with pine resiny tones of hops and a back bone of a ton of malted barley induced sweetness with fruit tones dancing in the foreground of the aroma. Flavors oh what a nice barley wine and if this is 15% that's just rediculous because you cannot taste it hidden so well worthy of praise from all, not too mention so smooth with the sweet citrus shot hitting first on my palate followed by rich caramelized plums and a healthy kick of hops to blend flavors toward equilibrium. Just topped off my initial pour and some floral hop tones have arisen in the aroma as well as a bit more pronounced fruit tones, but still one mastery piece of art is this beer thank you Sam once again for your audacity and perfection in this art of brewing. Mouthfeel contains perfect amount of carbonation bottle didn't pop as I was expecting but did release the gas with a slow psssss sound. Slightly syrup texture fuller body so much character yet one of the most drinkable barley wines or palatable I should say done so well I must tip my hat. Like I said before this one is dangerous b/c you can't tell it's 15% and if you don't keep a mental note of the kick one could easily consume all 25.6 oz of this fine nectar. I took the advice of the bottle and poured it's contents into two snifters however it doesn't tell you to share it with another person, but I let others sample but I indulged and enjoyed a nice nightcap before shipping off back to college."
"Notes: Interesting beer, a little thin for a barleywine. Alcohol tingly. I think this beer would have benefited from not fermenting all the way to 15%. The malt aroma is there, but the malty sweetness and fullness is absent. Not the best barleywine I've tasted."
"Pretty damn good cap to a night of good brews at Dogfish in Rehoboth."
"Originally sampled on 4 January 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. Pours nearly flat. It has a hazy amber color w/ a thick feel on the tongue & a sweet finish. Definitely taste the malt & perhaps some honey-like flavor. Nice, but not great."
"This beer poured a hazy orange amber color and formed a minimal bubbly white lace that left little lace. Some sediment is present with just a small amount of carbonation. An aroma of malt, a bit of hops and caramel with a touch of citrus. A flavor of malt, and carmel with a hint of the alcohol present. The finish is of a medium body and slightly sweet with a warming aspect of alcohol."
"I just got schooled...thanks to cokes."
"This was an enjoyable Sunday afternoon beer, but I would not call it a barleywine. That being said, I am not sure what I would call it."
"While I am a huge Barleywine fan, I just do not like this beer at all. It is sickening sweet. Color is a nice amber with a small foam white head. Smell is that of Apricot an fruit. The taste is very fruity, some yeast and no hop taste to be found. Tastes like something went wrong with this beer. I have tried it twice to make sure I did not get a bad batch and it was the same. Would not try again."
"Wow. This beer delivers the goods in every way .Golden honey color and very translucent. Looks thick but lighter in color than your average barlywine. The smell is sweet & floral, but the taste opens up with all sorts of fruity flavors!! Mango is heavy at the end..Yum!. The mouthfeel is great on account of all the flavor keeping your tastebuds working overtime. Would love to drink all night, too strong...damn! I would never guess 15% on this one. Awesome!!"
"So stoked to see this on tap so I just had to have it. Tastes ever so smooth. Very fruity. The 15% is so well hidden. This is one of my all time favorite brews. It needs a bit of age, but it is damn good young aswell. If you see this on tap, snap up the chance to have yourself a glass. Otherwise, buy two of the the corked bottles and bury one as per directions on the bottle."
"Turbid dark amber hue, topped by a vanilla white head foam rim. Bubbles rise lazily due to the high apparent viscosity. Ripe, peachy esters upfront in aroma, ensued by pine laced citrusy hops and a waft of mellow caramel and butterscotch. Hints of biscuit and heaty fusels surface as the beer breathes. Surprisingly tame aromawise. Mild toffeeish, melanoidin sweetness at first in flavor morphs into a fructose laden candy like, fruity, red licorice impression. Mellow carob and butterscotch undertone initially complements the light caramel and biscuit malt presence, but diacetyl becomes progressively more pronounced and begins to dominate. Mild hop bitterness leaves residual sweetness mostly uncontested. Muted floral hop flavor, with a herbal tinge. Full bodied, with a creamy, tongue coating, heavily dextrinous mouthfeel. Quite heavy on the palate. Finishes with a snap of bready malt yielding to an oily melange of hot butter and maple syrup. Olde School is quite an odd, but enjoyable brew. It's reminescent of a barleywine and hot toddy combination. It eventually weighs heavily on the palate, partially due to the pronounced diacetyl and unhindered residual sweetness. A fine bellywarmer nonetheless."
"Overall a nice Barley Wine that balances malt and bitterness along with alcohol very well. IMHO it is a little rough around the edges though. Perhaps ageing will make this a most exceptional Barley Wine. The alcohol does sneak up on you; so beware."
"A very, very tasty barleywine in the lighter color, fruity-malt vein. Hides its alcohol better than the Raison D'Etre, which is a bit more than half as strong."
"Drinkability & Notes: Big flavours are bursting with aleish ripeness, where is the 15% abv? There is alcohol there but I have had smaller barleywines that can’t hide the alcohol like this. Watch out on this one as it catches up with you."
"Pours with a thin, short lived white head over lightly hazy gold/copper-colored liquid. Nose is a bit musty, apricot-ish and other fruits too. Taste is surprisingly on the thin side for a beer of such alcoholic content. Notes of fruitiness, tartness and malt blend together, with a winey flavor popping up in the mix. Hoppiness lays in the background, not dominating at all. Alcohol heat and flavor is very unexpectedly subdued here. Finishes up with sweetness that dries out just slightly in the end, an average barleywine at best."
"Another really interesting offering from our friends in Slower Delaware. Medium copper in color, just a trace of head (though, to be honest, there was more than I expected given the 15% potency). The smell is surprisingly mild, though certainly not offensive in any way. In a way it smells a bit like (and this is kind of odd) Orange Crush. In fact, upon the first taste that's exactly what popped into my head -- a rather hyped up version of Orange Crush. Not necessarily bad, just different. Of course, there are other flavors in there, such as molasses, tropical fruits, some subtle hop bitterness. And yes, alcohol, but not nearly as biting as you might expect from a beer of this strength, which perhaps makes it just a tad dangerously drinkable."
"No bruises are left after the 15% pounding. Tauntingly drinkable, and wrath-masking."
"Pours a slightly hazy peachish/orange color with some smallish floaters in there as well and a minimal creamy white head that sinks to the thinnest of films. Sweet malty and fruity aromas with some spiced apple and slightly alcoholic undertone. Thick maltiness and a big apple and vinous fruitiness still has a tough time of masking the 15% alcohol. However the alcohol only has a nice warming effect which is perfect for a cold day like today. Apples and some slight spiciness give this a nice winter touch. Smooth warmth from the alcohol and malt give this an amazing drinkability for its strength. Excellently drinkable brew. This is damn good for being as young as it is. I am definitely looking to get some of this and put it away."
"424"
"15.5% ABV - touted as ""The world's strongest naturally carbonated beer", partially made possible through fermention in the secondary, and priming with the yeast from the World Wide Stout (which contains Champagne yeast). A cloudy, peach colored body is topped by a thick and creamy off-white head. The aroma is quite fruity with notes of raisins and figs, but some higher alcohols are clearly present as well. The body is medium/full with a very fine carbonation that leaves it quite creamy in the mouth. The flavor is rich and sweet with loads of caramel, molasses and maple syrup as well as some fruitiness and a tingling in the mouth & warming in the throat from the alcohol. The sugary flavors linger in the long lasting  finish. Very nicely done with interesting fruit characteristics and a nice sweetness, but the alcohol is a bit too ""hot"" to give it any real drinkability. Still, very unique and worth trying."
"Touted as the worlds strongest naturally fermented barleywine.  The brew is made with dates and figs, this sugar naturally punps the abv.. to what I don't know (sorry).  This brew was brewed in June and bottled in Sept. it will be released Dec. 10 in bombers.  Beige in color with a nive tan lace, the beer has a malty alcohol nose with a little hops in the back of the nose.  Smooth silky fruity taste (figs) with lots of malt in your mouth.  Thick and fruity.. this brew has a big bold finish.  Not as dry on the tongue as many other BW's I've tasted.  The brew does numb the tongue.  I think this will greatly improve with more time in the bottle.  A review edit will be done as I cellar one of these for next year!!"
