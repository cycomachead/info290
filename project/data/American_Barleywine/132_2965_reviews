"This, for me, is the American barley wine style ale standard by which all others shall be judged."
""
""
"Rusty brown body with a thin frothy head.  Smells of worty malt with citrus and pine hops - some booze.  Tastes of dried fruit, fig, cane syrup, wort, caramel.  Solid bitterness.  More bittering hops than aromatic ones.  Body is creamy, full, and smooth.  Excellent American barley wine.  Textbook."
"O: This one is a very enjoyable though assertive American Barleywine with a really nice hop presence which does not seem to have faded much even with a little over a year of age on it. Pretty easy to drink though it is definitely a big beer and needs to be slowly sipped and enjoyed. Alcohol is pretty well hidden considering the strength of this brew."

"Had one from 2013, so it had at least a year on it"
"Overall: 13 year vintage purchased in house at Rouge in 2002. We ran out of beer tonight and this was the only left that we thought had aged long enough. Overall a great beer, the smell and taste are far from each other. When I first opened it I thought it would be overly sweet but instead it's smokey hoppy malty, and incredibly smooth. Overall glad I kept one around for 13 years."

"Not big on the Barleywine style but this went down pretty good."

"I am drinking the 2013 vintage out of the 750 ml bottle. This is a big, bitter, intense beer. Pours hazy ruby brown under a rocky light tan head that produces thick lace. Has a big malt nose with dark sugars and some sherry notes. Begins with a touch of sweet malt and then goes through three or four versions of hop bitterness and spiciness ending in a long lingering hop bitterness riding on smooth caramelly malt. A big alcohol palate joins with some heavy duty bitterness to balance the big, rich sherry malt flavors. Lingering bitter alcohol finish. The alcohol is warming but not overly hot or solventy."

"2013 vintage, black ceramic flip-top bottle poured into a tulip. Note that the recipe of this beer appears to change depending on the year. A murky ruddy root beer brown brew with a copious quantity of creamy, frothy light tan head. Nice aroma of resinous citrus/tropical hops (this incarnation includes Centennial), orchard fruit, dark bread, cotton candy, cacao powder, barroom nuts, and a tinge of umami. Classic American barleywine. Pine, orange, and mango mingle with rich toffee, pretzel, chocolate, pears, apples, black tea, donut, and a little light molasses. Robust malts and equally assertive resinous hops, with emergent walnut, pine needle and astringent tree bark elements cutting what might otherwise be a cloying sweetness. Thick bodied and smooth but not quite syrupy with low end carbonation. Finishes rather dry, more piney hops and citrus rind. Hits all the expected notes: Fruity, aromatic, richly sweet but with a counterbalancing bitterness. Some IPA tendencies. Perhaps less complex than other iconic examples of the style."

"primarily notes to self…2013 vintage (in December 2014) from a growler. Very good beer. Hoppy but not as much so as some barley wines, such as Alaskan and Bigfoot. Solid malty base. Not too boozy. I would not pay the ceramic bottle price, but 2 pints for $8 is fair."
"O:not mind blowing but pretty good, certainly an interesting beer, buy a bottle, not a growler"

"I saw this beer a few weeks ago and became curious. I've had many of Rogue's beers before, they've been hit or miss. I got the Barleywine due to I had an Imperial a few days prior. I found the Rogue to have a good ""weight"" to it, though I thought it would be a tad heavier. The taste was spot on with vanilla and coco notes. The only reason I did not give this a 5 rating was the price. $16 is steep for this beer, I think it's due to the bottle though"

"750 ml bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage bottling, 10.75%. Pours hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, raisin, plum, fig, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, herbal, floral, grass, pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and dark fruit notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, raisin, plum, fig, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, raisin, plum, fig, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity and balance of citrus/earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome American barleywine. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/earthy hops, dark/bready malt, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall - I first reviewed the '12 Old Crusty about 5 months ago, and I gave it an absolute shit review. I greatly preferred the '14 on tap, and I still do. That said, this bottle that I reviewed was literally the bottle right next to the last one, and it was infinitely better.  The previous bottle showed stupid amounts of metallic character that was hard to ignore. This one had very little. Just goes to show the volatile difference that can happen from bottle to bottle. Whether or not I'd be willing to gamble on another bottle of this vintage? Probably not."

"Served on-tap in downtown Janesville, WI. This pours a medium brown color with a slight head. The aroma is slight malty and sweet. The taste is sweet and boozy. Great taste of caramel malts and smooth finish. Rather filling beer and a nice find to try on-tap. Very nicely made."

"Overall: i bought this one mostly for the sweet swing-top ceramic bottle. I found the beer to be a bit over priced and but just not doing it for me. the flavors are to untamed and harsh."

"Overall: Pretty nice barleywine. Could use a bit more sweetness, but I'm happy."
"Lacks some of the edge of a fresh bottle, but the age has bound together the disparate flavors into a perfectly harmonious whole. Excellent beer for a rainy day...wish I'd cellared some more (I think this could easily cellar for a few more years without falling off too much)."
"O- I am not a big barleywine guy and a little goes a long way with me, but this really was a dessert beer. I don't like overly sweet beers so the wallop of hop bitterness kept it from being too sweet for me, but I doubt I would ever want more than 10 ounces at once."

"Got a two litre growler of this from Cellarbrations Carlisle it's been a while since i sampled this and pours a rusty copper hue with an off white two finger creamed head and clingy leggy boozy lacing nice,the nose is butterscotch,marzipan,toffee,a touch of booze and a distinct herbal hoppiness and yeah it's a barley wine alright with a nice full well carbonated feel and the taste starts sweet with caramel malts,butterscotch,maple syrup and toffee finished with a fruitcake bittersweetness and overall well worth the price compared to buying it in bottle and well worth a try cheers."

"A quite bitter barleywine with discordant flavors that have not melded well, even 3 years after bottling and aged in appropriate conditions. I like smelling it, I don't like drinking it as much."

"O - For a 16 year old barleywine I don't see it faring any better. Short of the mineral water bitterness this was a really impressive science experiment in aging. Me thinks the absurd IBU level does not help after all of the hop flavors have faded away."
"O: Exceptional beer. This would be a wonderful beer to age. If you find this, get it."

"Served from a 7 ounce bottle, the beer pours a dark amber color with very little foam. The aroma is strong with candy sugar and laced with dark fruit overtones. Smooth and slightly carbonated on the palate. It starts sweet, offering a few tobacco notes as it glides back. Bitterness rises at the end to finish it off. Overall this is a good beer. I would appreciate more depth, perhaps more age, for Barleywine."

"I was given a bottle from 1998 that an uncle had cellared. I cracked it open on a damp, cool September night. I enjoyed it but wasn't blown away. I'm thinking it might have been slightly past its prime (14 years is quite a long time I know) but it was enjoyable. The alcohol had all but vanished but there was some subtle bitterness that felt out of place. It was definitely better when it was closed (cold) then after I had let it sit. The warmer it got the worse I felt it got. I have another bottle that was cellared in 2010 so I think I'll try that shortly and compare the two. I have no doubt about it's legendary status but, for me, this wasn't spectacular, just merely good."
""
"O- crustacean is a powerful barleywine that is smooth but does pack a powerful punch. Good enjoyable flavor"
"Overall quite a good and very different from most barleywines. Nice to grab this one for a change."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I would have this again but I wouldn't search very hard for it. Nonetheless, a very decent beer."
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with a sweet flavor and an herbal hop flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and easy to drink with some nice aromas and flavors."
"O:  This beer is huge on the sweetness, bready malts and the bitterness is there but not truly pronounced.   I think this has faded somewhat but is still good regardless. The flavors really playoff each other a develop a complex and balanced beer.  Bottled in 2010 I can tell that the hops have faded quite a bit. I was expecting to have a big robust hop palate but I will have to find a fresh bottle to get the real flare of this beast. That being said it has aged very well. "
"O: This one is tasty, and I went into it with no expectations. There are barleywines I prefer to this one, but I would drink this again."

"7oz bottled in 2000 Sampled in 2012 so it's got a bit of age on it. Pours a mostly clear dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. The aroma is filled with caramel dark sugar and lots of dark fruit with some alcohol and a bit of wet cardboard. The flavor is dark sugars and cherries and raisins with a healthy dose of warming alcohol. There's an earthy herbal component in there as well. Medium to thin body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet harsh alcohol type mouthfeel. Its nice to be able to try a 12 year old bottle of barleywine. I've had fresher bottles of this and felt the alcohol was a bit too present, and this proves that age won't fix that. The twist off cap probably didn't help much, but there was still a little bit of carbonation. Nice to try."

"i so wish it tasted like it smelled, but nope. Its kind of bland actually. Its sweet, but not as sweet as it smells. Its like an overly dry, almost off tasting sweetness that turns me off. I think it may have oxidized. I think I want dry sweetness, but I get some dryness, but the grains feel dry (and they dont work with the sweeter notes at all)."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Big and potent with a heavy boozy flavor and a wonderful thickness."
"Overall: This beer is all over the place for me. Some things i like, some things are off, some things i hate. It's not an amateurish or badly made beer, it's just badly designed in my opinion, it doesn't really work as a whole. I almost feel guilty giving it such a low score but i expect a re-taste in the future to correct or confirm my suspicions."

"O: Love, love, love this big ass barleywine. Total worth the money. Great flavor and huge amount of alcohol."
"OVERALL: Not great, but not bad either. The look and smell are great, but the taste and the feel are only slightly above average. All of this adds up to a good beer, but it probably isn't worth paying $17.99 for a bomber."
""
"I was pleasantly surprised. I had stayed away from Rogue for a while but this is a great beer. Very flavorful and well crafted. Great job Rogue."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This was a pleasant brew, strong, but never overbearing or not tasty. This would pair with a solid dinner like roasted pork loin and smashed potatoes."

"Pours a nice copper color with a decent head and lacing, but soon dissipates. The smell has definite notes of malt and a bit of fruity notes. The beer tastes awesome! You can taste the hops but it is smoothed out with the malt and the subtle sweetness of the fruit. You can definitely taste the higher alcohol content, but it doesn't take away from the beer. The smoothness mixed with light carbonation makes for a great mouthfeel. Overall, this was a really well done barley wine."

"P.S. 11.5% ABV? WHERE? VERY well hidden."
""
""
"There are better barleywine's out there these days, but this is still an impressive, well made, very well crafted beer from the folks at Rogue. Definitely a walk down memory lane with this one...."
""
"Overall, this was probably the least good beer of the flight. There seems to be a weird amalgamation of flavors here, almost like rather than a well-integrated barleywine it's a mixture of scotch ale and DIPA."
"O: A very good beer. Surprisingly hoppy. Recommended."
"O: Really great Rogue beer -- one of the best -- and a steal at under $2 a bottle. Highly recommended; a stellar example of the American Barleywine style. I have no idea what it's like fresh, but this aged bottle is a thing of beauty. Would have again."

"It is amazing getting to drink a beer with this kind of history. My hat is off to this restaurant for stocking this bit of history and to Rogue for making a barleywine that keeps so well."
"Overall, this is a solid west coast hoppy barley wine. Very big feeling beer and great after dinner on a rainy cold night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recommended!"
""
""
""
"I'll still get more bottles of this and give them a couple of more years to mellow. I wouldn't approach the 2010 vintage until at least 2014."
""
""
"O: Complex and drinkable, a very good barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Fantastic, but I think the best is yet to come. Glad I still have a bottle in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: A definite sipper. So bitter, though, its tough to get through 7oz; probably the most bitter / intensely hopped barleywine I’ve had - except for fresh Bigfoot, maybe."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy deep amber to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, fruity and a small alcohol presence. In the taste, dark fruits, with a pleasant alcohol burn all the way through. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry dark fruit and alcohol presence in the aftertaste. Does not seem huge in alcohol, quite smooth and mellow."
""
""
"gnarly beer. pours a hazy golden amber color and looks thick and sticky. like the texture of marshmallow fluff. smells mildly hoppy and just super strong. was told by the barkeep it was 121 IBUs, which would make this the most bitter beer i have ever consumed, but it didnt feel bitter, or certainly not 121 units bitter. did little to mask the alcohol in any event, this was just brimming with boozey punch. a pint of this could kill a casual beer drinker. overall just a huge beer, not for the faint of heart, and even gnarly for a barleywine, which tend to be burley to begin with. cool to try around the holidays for sure."

"I am guessing that this beer would be well above an A average if Rogue sold vintages like J.W. Lees Harvest Ale. I can't speak from experience, but this has ""masterpiece at 5+ years," written all over it."
"I enjoyed drinking this to an extent, but there are much better beers of this style out there. For what it's worth, I prefer a barleywine with a touch more sweetness."
"O: OK - not exactly what I expect from a Barleywine, but as a west coast American version thereof, I guess this makes sense. I wonder what a few years in the cellar would do for this, as it's really quite bitter at its current age."
"Pass on this one. Rogue I want to give you credit for going away from those awful oversized over priced bottles, but you give us these very drinkable sized 7 oz servings and charge 5 bucks for them. Then you fill with one of the worst barely wines I’ve had…shame on you. Oh and you don’t give a bottled on date but have the audacity to tell me to drink at a year old? I should score this beer all 1’s just for that!"
"I had tasted some Old Crusty from the bottle once and found in heinous, but Rogue beers do have a tendency to sit on shelves around here. From the tap, it’s a heavy, sweet, syrupy, above average barleywine."
"For a fresh American Barleywine, I thought that this one got it about right. Although the complexity wasn’t quite here, the base ingredients were definitely in place for more to develop as this ages and while there is a pretty hefty hop presence, I was pleased to find that it didn’t beat you over the head like some of these one that are borderline DIPAs. Bitter and sticky wrapped up in an easy sipping warming package about sums this one up. It had been a while since I’ve had this and I couldn’t think of a better beer to have during our chilly late afternoon visit to the brewery."
"Overall the nose is solid, as is the mouthfeel and the appearance, but the taste is so biter that it makes for a less than enjoyable experience. With some aging this beer ""could"" be great, but even with a year it just is too harsh still."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation, this beer is very drinkable despite the flavors. The body is not really thick but is rather sticky. The carbonation is a little fizzy but does not seem to detract from the flavors."
"The taste mimics the aroma starting with sweet flavors of vanilla and honey it begins to dry as the carbonation subsides and a bitter earthiness finishes to the end."
"Overall, a very good barleywine. Great hop flavor with huge malt body. Excellent balance, not too hoppy, not too sweet."
"PP (Price Point) - Unknown, free leftovers from a BA tasting!!"
"You can read a comparison of this and a couple other barleywines on my blog at dearmondfood.blogspot.com"
"o - Overall a very good barleywine that definitely holds up. Not too much alcohol considering the ABV, I'm guessing because of the age, and it smells amazing. Would like to have it again sometime."
"Overall: 2002 (4) & 2010 (3.5) - Again, it would have been nice to try something in the middle ground but 2010 was still too young for this and I am thinking 2009 and maybe even 2008 would be as well. 2002 might be a bit too late, so someone try a 2004 or 2005 and let us know!"
"O - it's a good beer that ages and changes well."
"O-very good especially for the age. Definitely cellar this beer."
"taste is strong/bitter upfront but nice. slightly fruity/sweet. well balanced, good carbonation - overall really good and true to the barleywine style."
"This is a very bold brew with big fusel alcohol and even more dominating bitterness. For being 9 years old, I think it could continue to age for several more years. Medium to full bodied with a light, enjoyable level of carbonation. This is quite an oily bitter brew that seems a bit onesided in taste which is not what the aroma leads you to believe. Overall a very aggressive american style barleywine that is worth a try. I have a ceramic 750ml bottle that I have been ancy to open up, after having this experience I am in no rush to open it anytime in the next 10 years, it might need that much time to make it a bit more palatable."
"O - All over the board... This brew is great tasting, but lacks looks and scent. Worth trying, I'll buy one to sit on. Boo to the 7 oz. bottle."
"M - Thick and syrupy. Just like I'd expect from a barleywine. Mild, but very smooth carbonation. Lingering boozy warmth after each sip."
"The nose is all malt but the taste is very hop forward, very complex though. One of the hoppiest American Barley Wine out there. This is good as is but would love for some age to bring out more of that malt in the flavor."
"Pours a orangeish brown with a touch of off-white head. Smells very hoppy and caramel heavy. Tons and tons of hoppy bitterness on the nose and on the tons. Its a bit rough on the tongue. Well carbonated but a bit harsh from the hop bitters and the CO2. The caramel malts are very nice. Overall its pretty solid."
"Old Crusty is quite good in the realm of hoppy barleywines. Certainly it could hold up over time; however, it's fine right now."
"Dove deep into my wallet for this one. I ordered a vintage bottle from 1994 at the Farmhouse in Emmaus. This beer was brought out with the old design that's shown here on BA. The Beer was poured out into a wine glass. The beer had a few bubbles left but not nearly as much as any fresh brew. The color of the beer was a reddish brown color with some sediment floating around in it. The smell of the beer was pretty boozy, with some wine like aromas coming off of it. The taste of the beer has some malty fermented fruit flavors in there. There is also a heat in there coming from the ABV. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty thin now and flat. Overall it was a lot of fun having a beer this old. I wouldn't pay for one of these again though."
"A decent beer but nothing overly impressive. I think it needs a touch more fresh hop character to build up the flavour profile."
"O - A nice 3 years old BW with no noticeable oxidation happening yet. A bit boozy and sweet but still a tasty beer."
"O- There is no real malt backbone in this and the only hops are bitterness with no real aroma or flavor hops."
"(O) If you handed me this beer and said to taste it without any knowledge of what it was, I'd flat out tell you it was probably an IPA. I'm now curious as to what it would be like fresh."
"Relatively easy-drinking and smooth, given the ABV. This was my first barleywine back in 2004, and at the time I remember thinking how completely vile and undrinkable it was. My, how times/tastes change...!"
"O: A delightful endeavor to say the least. I have another bottle stashed away, in hopes of indulging in it around the ten year mark."
"Poured on tap into sampler glass at ChurchKey. Pours dark amber in color with a smooth look to it. Nice cloudiness to it. Some carbonation could be seen streaming up from the bottom of the glass, with a nice amount odd white head sitting on top of it. Smooth settle, left behind only trace amounts of side lacing. The aroma was rich, light notes of alcohol and a ton of bready malts. Hints of pine resin hops and a nice, touch of grain mingling in throughout the profile. The flavor was smooth as could be, a very mellow barley wine with hints of caramel and a muted hop note. Interesting balance here, with the alcohol mostly hidden in amongst the profile. Mild carbonation throughout."
"M- Nice carb level, not very abrasive at all. fairly clean finish, leaves some dryness and a little hint of the sugars."
"(The beer that is.)"
"M – Medium body. Bright boozy, bitter finish."
"O: Love this beer. Rogue has another winner."
"This is probably the most manly beer I've ever had, yet it's doesn't kick you in the ribs like other strong beers. It's got some sizzle, but for being so high in alcohol and IBU, it's mostly drinkable."
"O - Pretty good, reminds me a lot of other west coast barleywines (Bigfoot, Old Guardian). This is a good thing, but the fact that it's quite a bit more expensive isn't."
"Overall I'm going to try and procure a few more bottles to take home and it paired wonderfully with veal sweet breads mushrooms and Brussels sprouts."
"I was really please with this. I cant believe the hop bitterness this one still packs. I dont even know if I would like this one super fresh. I would assume the hop flavor would be powerful. The malts have shone their true colors here and made this one actually pretty well balanced. This one is drinking about as perfect as a barleywine can get, if you ask me."
"D: A very drinkable barley wine. wish I had another. excellent if you like hoppy beers."
"Rogue Old Crustacean is a slightly hazy copper ale with a thin, dense, yellowish head that thins to turbulent film and leaves decent lacing. It has a big, complex aroma; semi-sweet, heavy malt with notes of caramel and toffee. There's a resiny pine scent and some kind of spice. It's pretty full bodied and smooth. The finish is syrupy and chalky. It leaves the lips sticky. It has a bold flavor, pretty sweet and tangy. Then comes the cutting bitterness with lemon peel and pine sap. The flavors work together quite well. The 7 ounce bottle is a good idea. It's pretty astringent and I probably should have kept it cellared longer."
"D: 7oz is a good size; it's an interesting beer, but just a huge amount of flavor."
"Overall, I'd say this beer is probably near it's age limit. I've got another '99 that I'll let go another couple years to see, but I can't see it getting much better. The hops held up well and it's incredibly drinkable for the ABV. Definitely a solid cellar candidate."
"D: A hophead's American barleywine, Old Crusty is an 11.5% ABV, 110 IBU bomb. Tough to gather the full complexity of malts here, but if you like your barleywines on the imbalanced, hop-side of things, this brew might be for you."
"The drinkability is only diminished by those that don't appreciate the best this style can deliver."
"Drinkability: I'm glad its just a 7 oz bottle. I think this one needs a lot of time to mellow. If it tasted like it smelled, it would be an easy A."
"D: Not too bad. Interesting!"
"Hop grassy earthy bitterness dominates."
"Overall an enjoyable barley wine that I am glad I had the chance to try. I would say this would be worth another look."
"D: A sure sipper. This beer would stand up well to heavy italian, beef, duck and pork dishes. The heavier the better, bring it on!"
"D-Again, more of a DIPA than a barleywine, but the line has become so blurry these days that I won't protest too much."
"D - I realize this is an older American barely wine from before the days of the hop heads and DIPAs. And I know American and English barleywines are fundamentally different in this regard, but it is much much closer to an ipa or even dipa. What's the point of making all the amazing deep complex barleywine flavors if you are just going to bury them in a sawdust pile of hops? I can't recommend this beer as an accurate representation of barely wine"
"Poured from a bottle into a wide mouthed goblet, the beer has a cloudy, almost opaque appearance, with a muddled amber-tan color. Good flow of carbonation present, which is good, because this appears a bit on the thick and viscous side. A very thin film of head that dissipates to residue very rapidly. The beer has initial smells of grapefruit and cotton candy, both characteristics very sweet and forward. Deeper smells reveal more citrus, but also some light spices. The beer has a sour backbone of flavor, but the cotton candy sweetness remains present in the flavor, although much lighter than the smell may infer. Some definite notes of hops, both in the green bitters and slight citrus (grapefruit) notes. Also, a boozey flavor to the beer, although not unpleasant. The beer has a viscous and oily/slick mouthfeel, as it appeared that it would. The aftertaste is slightly sour and toasted. The ABV can also be gleamed from the aftertaste, again not entirely unpleasant. The finish puckers the mouth and dries the tongue a little bit, but that makes it all the easier to follow with another mouthful. It would be difficult to consume this one en masse, and your head might pay for it the next day. Ultimately enjoyable Barleywine!!"
"Quite a pleasant-tasting barleywine. The alcohol is under control (even though it does have a high ABV) and it doesn't make me pucker up from bitterness. Nice having it in a 7 oz. bottle rather than a 22 oz. bomber - I'm rarely in the mood for that much barleywine at once."
"So, I hear this was a fresh batch. Having had others with age and been suitably underwhelmed, I will not be going back. Even if they pale in badness compared to this one, I believe that there is little expectation of goodness. If you looked at this as a DIPA you might be less underwhelmed, but still, that medicinal nastiness would make it less than happy making."
"I love it...but it's not for babies or people who like balanced beers. This. Is. Extreme."
"Old Crustacean may be one of the most difficult beers that I've rated. It's got both a lot of good and a lot of bad. This could be a spectacular beer, but additional age may be the way to get there. Right now it's too brash."
"Pick this up if you find it."
"A must try."
"D: It's been a few years since I've tried this one, and I used to tell everyone back then that this was my favorite barleywine. Even though my tastes have changed, I still hold it in high regard today."
"I plan to."
"I had to get this for the experience, and because it's a Barleywine(that's my tick catagory), but otherwise don't pay $18 for it, one of those 7oz bottles may be worth for the experience it if that happens."
"D - If this tasted like it smells it would have been very good but the rubber taste is just killing this beer for me I doubt I'll be getting another bottle anytime soon"
"This is quite drinkable, though I would very much like to see how the malts come forward if this was given some time for the hops to mellow out."
"D - pleasant enough, but I'd only have one or two."
"I want many bottles for my cellar. This is my favorite beer from Rogue, to date."
"1994 nib bottle courtesy of Sloth! Bottle opens without a hiss. Pours a thick, opaque mahogany with a cherry edge. Rich malt, prunes, raisins, caramel fudge cake in the nose. Mouth is flat but thick and viscous. Touch of oxidation. Bold, rich flavors with banana nut cake, dark fruits, and toffee. Very nice. Would have been stellar with bubbles. Thanks Bert, an awesome trader!"
"D: This was a good experience, but not something I would want to do on a nightly basis, great to have a few friends around."
"I could see this one going for another 5-10 years no problem. this was a real treat and it's well worth the 20$ price tag here in Alberta."
"Thick, sticky, and syrupy, this has a lot of potential, but I would hold onto another one for a couple more years before opening it, to give it more time to mellow."
"Rich malt complexity, sandalwood, tea, pine, and toffee. Long finish with a good dose of residual bitterness. The enduring hop content tends to distract from any oxidation, though it's present, and not unpleasant. Almost a minty note from the hops, certainly numbing. Low to medium carbonation, very suited to the barleywine. A very slow sipper, I look forward to finishing this over an hour or so. Probably a nice cigar beer..."
"D - I would drink this all night if I could, but at 11.5%, that isn't exactly possible. I split the 750ml with a friend, but I could have easily enjoyed the entire bottle throughout the evening. Very good beer...I will definitely seek this out again and hopefully set a few aside for the years to come. I would love to try a fresh bottling to see how apparent the hops are when fresh."
"The beer brings huge warmth and big complexity showing additional flavors of sticky dark fruits, port and oak. Its really remarkable. The finish is bitter and dry and lingers in your mouth for hours. Seriously, by the time I got home and rested I could still feel the Rogue in my mouth. Crazy stuff. Who knows what will happen in another decade..."
"Poured a copper brown color with a slight haze. Smelled intensely hoppy and the taste wasn't much different. I was taken aback at how strong the hops were in the first drink, surprising because hoppy is my style. The following drinks weren't as harsh and it became a decently smooth drink."
"Taste: intense beer. balanced barleywine and a greta malt backbone. great aging beer."
"2006 vintage. Pours an amber-brown colour with thin head. Smell has lots of burnt caramel and toffee with dried fruit. Flavour is quite sweet with brown sugar. Even if hops faded in the nose, the bitterness is still there in the taste. Nice barleywine."
"Cheers to Rogue!"
"Served in a pint glass, drank on the couch. As with any barleywine Style beer the aftertaste on this beer is not for the faint of heart. The nose is caramely and very malty. At 11.5 abv there is virtually no head. A little too carbinated for a traditional barleywine but lines ones gut like the best of the bunch! Being a sucker for barleywines I have to give this beer high remarks."
"Poured a reddish brown (copper) into my tulip style glass. About a finger and a half of dense head w/ some pretty impressive lacing. Smell was sweet and had definite caramel, choclate and dark fruit notes to it. Taste was superb. Caramel and toasted malt all the way through w/ a slight hop bitterness and alcohol warmth on the back end. Mouthfeel was great. Each sip was full and left one hell of a delicious, lingering after taste. Drink ablitly was also very good. You don't really taste much of the alcohol but you will quickly start to feel it. Definitely up there on my list of favorite brews. I'll be picking up another bottle to let sit for a few years."
"Notes: I've been looking forward to cracking this one open and got what I expected out of this beer. It is a pretty good barleywine and I still think that it could definitely use some more age on it still. At the steep price tag of $17 I'm not sure I'll be buying this anytime soon, especially when there are cheaper and equally as good offerings."
"Pours a deep dark reddish brown, very muddy - cannot see through. Nice 1/4 tan head that subsides quickly to a fine lacing. Aroma is very boozy; has a nice sweet sugary caramel maltiness and some dark fruity character. Minimal hops in aroma (no wonder, it's a 4yr old btl.) Surprisingly, hop bitterness is still quite intact - all 110 of those IBU's lasted quite well. Very bitter and big boozy warmth in the chest. Very dry finish. Smooth and slick mouthfeel."
"(D)- I cant believe how well this has aged. Based on this, it could age for even more years. Still very hoppy; was hoping for more of the malts to come through, but I can live with that. For what you get though, I am glad I did not pay the full price tag for one of these. Definitely not worth the typical $20 price tag for one of these."
"Overall a nice barley wine. Not the most complex set of flavors but drinkable. As long as you split the bottle with someone."
"D - Man, this is dangerously drinkable with the alcohol being really mellow with age. The flavor is pretty solid and actually hoppy for it's age. It's a good barleywine I took a chance on when it was on sale and got four bottles. I'll be aging this further."
"2008 vintage heavy ceramic swing-top bottle. Pours a deep red with a moderate amount of carbonation. Enticing aroma of burnt caramel, toffee, a touch of burnt marshmallow. Tastes of massive amounts of malt; caramel, a bit of toffee with the intense juicy citrus of Centennial hops combined with the pine resin character of Chinook. Very smooth. The lubricious mouthfeel enhances the drinkability (for a barleywine.) I love the combination of Chinook hops and caramel and Munich malts. The bitterness is intense and gets abrasive towards the finish. High alpha hops and alcohol mix for a very assertively bitter, slightly ""hot"" finish. Haven't had one of these in really long time. Still a great, intense barleywine. Amazing how assertive the bitterness is with nearly two years of age. Another bottle of this is in the cellar where it shall stay as long as many years as I can resist."
"1998 vintage. Thanks again to Ratman for the opportunity to sample another beer from the past. Pours a dark, somewhat hazy, brown-amber color, with a very minimal amount of white lacing. Nice aromas of dark fruit, alcohol and caramel malt. Nice malty flavors, with caramel, toffee and alcohol. A very nicely aged beer, way different than the fresh, hugely hoppy beer I remember."
"Poured minimal head on top of a brownish red body with thin lace stuck around glass. A mix of herbal hops and dark fruit, especially cherry, with some caramel and bready malts mixed in. Has a great dry wine like taste with dark fruit, and again I notice cherries for some reason over other fruits, along with a nice chunk of toffee/caramel like sweetness. Not too hoppy but there is a little rounded presence that gives it a dry backbite but dry finish is also due to high alcohol kick. Also some sour fruit and stickiness to this beer. The alcohol bleeds a little on the finish but this is a great sipper/nightcap."
"Thanks Moose!"
"D- Some age has done this beer well. I am guessing it was pretty hot when it came out. Good flavor and good body. Solid beer all around."
"The other bw characteristics shown through in this beer. It was an excellent brew. Get one and cellar it, I usually hate rogue beers too."
"Overall, this beer has held up extremely well. The alcohol is very present, as are the hops. The beer is a standout, new and aged...and this one, eight years old, is a fine example of a beer that deserves some age on it."
"Overall, a quality, balanced, well-hopped barleywine that ages very well. The flavors are all here and well accounted for. The hop presence on this vintage is rather amazing too. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the style."
"Easy sipper. 12oz bottle is more than enough for two to share."
"Poured a small amount into a snifter and set the rest aside for a later date. The color is really fantastic on this one, a deep reddish brown with a fantastic, yet thin, layer of head that doesn't quit. The aroma is also quite good. Normally, I expect barleywines to be overwhelmed with malt character, but there is a fair amount of hop quality here as well. Upon first sip, the beer reveals itself to be viscous, yet pleasantly smooth. There's a good amount of malt here, but again, the hops manage to shine through. I'd be doing this beer a great disservice if I didn't mention that this is likely the best experience I've had with a barleywine to date. Overall, Old Crustacean is very drinkable for a barleywine, although you probably wouldn't want to have more than one or two glasses, as the 11.5 ABV might sneak up on you pretty quick. Definitely planning on getting my hands on another one of there to set aside for aging."
"Exciting, but restrained in a certain sense. I'll never tire of this beer - drink some young, drink some old; it's got the full spectrum of skills."
"The B- rating reflects what I consider to be a decline in complexity due to excessive aging. I have tried not to let my personal ambivalence for the style from getting in the way of judging its potential."
"Good, but significantly overpriced."
"Smells of rich munich malts, bourbon, cough syrup, wine-like. Flavor is rich, malty, syrupy, bourbony, and sugary, with an intense bitter pine finish and a strong bitter pine, resiny hops aftertaste. Somewhat reminiscent of Gale's Prize Old Ale, but without the wild yeast notes. Smooth, not boozy, and perfectly balanced, which says something about how intense and perhaps out-of-balance this beer is for the first six years."
"A well-rounded brew. If anything, some might say it's a bit heavy on the hops, but it's an excellent selection, even though it's still young."
"I haven't had this beer in ages, but it displayed an excellent combination of rich caramel malt and citrus hops. It's certainly one of the best experiences I've had with an American Barleywine."
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown color along the top half of the glass. The bottom is a dark maize color. 3/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of strong hops, alcohol, sweet malt, slight brown sugar, and slight dark citrus. Fits the style of an American Barleywine. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong alcohol, strong hops, slight sweet malt, and slight dark citrus. Overall, the alcohol is not well hidden, even in the aroma."
"glassware: tulip"
"D: Good for the style. I probably could drink the 750ml alone, but I'm not sure I'd want to."
"Overall impression: Disappointing experience compared to previous instances of enjoying this beer, both fresh and aged (in times prior to joining BA). I suspect there may have been a bad seal on the bottle that hastened the aging process, as this is not the top-notch barleywine I remember. Don't have any more in my cellar, so I will have to revisit this brew at a time TBD."
"D - Nice, complex malt character with very complex dark sugars. I have had fresh bottles of this beer before, when it tastes like acetone and vomit, and the two years that were supposedly on this keg improved it vastly. Both the hops and alcohol have mellowed significantly and the malt character has become darker and more complex. There is still enough of the resinous hops and sharp alcohol left to keep the beer intense and lend it a boozy quality. This was quite good, but I suspect that there is still room for improvement. I can't wait to crack open the five year old bottle that I have in my cellar."
"Pours ruby/burnt orange and cloudy, with pillowy head that dies down slowly. Nice lacing. Aroma is clean, slightly soapy and some citrus. Taste is whoah...much drier than I'd expect. No residual sweetness. Could be a double IPA if they'd cranked up the hop aroma. Still might be a double IPA. Piny flavor and hits you in the back corners of the tongue. Alcohol is present, though not overwhelming. A bit sticky on the lips. A very nice beer."
"D. Drinkable. Not my favorite Barleywine, but still pretty good. Its definitely one to sip on, or it will creep up on you."
"This has evolved quite nicely over the almost eight years, and even for someone like myself that does not like hop bombs, turned into a very interesting beer. I am not sure the end result justify the long wait, but for a hop lover, it probably does. But I am quite sure this should not be drank fresh."
"Very tasty and not showing any oxidation, too bad it's totally flat. The bitterness has totally dropped off which makes this one much more drinkable. All other hopping is void as well. Apparently the XS series ages better, but just as flat as the standard version from 1995."
"As much as I like a hoppy full-frontal, this seems a tad out of balance for a barleywine, but let's face it, I was duly suckered in after that first gulp of 110 IBU insanity. The difference between this, and the biggest DIPAs out there is negligible, at best. Overall, as the tablewine-esque booze level is basically thoroughly integrated, imma just gonna sit back, and enjoy this heady mutha of a beer, until it slowly creeps up on me. Repeal this, those who had/have/would have the temerity to deprive us all of such well-made craft."
"would've been really nice to go vertical on this one, but too much other goodness to try on this fine evening."
"D: A top-tier American barleywine. Like an amped-up Bigfoot. They really need to ax those stupid ceramic bottles, though."
"-very true to style"
"2008 vintage from ceramic 750ml- pours a burnt red/brown hue with a very frothy head. Nose- pine and caramel. Taste- spicy, sweet breads, cookie dough initially, quickly followed by a wallop of hops upside the head. Very aggresive hops really take over after the initial malt sweetness and body to a thin, very bitter finish. I don't mind it- a change from an overly sweet and syrupy barleywine. A kick in the ass every now and then never hurts, but not an every day beer."
"D - Definitely a sipper."
"Pours a very nice reddish-amber with a lightly-coloured head which dissipates but leaves some lingering around the glass. Taste is quite sweet and bitter, but not overwheliming from either. It is balanced very well. Some sour/tart character lingers in the mouth after sipping. Aroma is sweet and candy-ish. Some floral hop and tart candy. Nice, full mouth. Boozey wamrth and a bit of slight syrupy viscosity. Very nice all around. Robust flavor while remaing fairly smooth."
"I found the drinkability of this one to be quite low. Maybe two goblets and ill need something less harsh. I had Old crustacean while eating some raw ahi. They went quite nicely together."
"About halfway through the glass I was served a dish of seared ahi sashimi, and it complimented the beer very well, bringing out more complex flavors than had I tried it without. Very intense beer, and one I will definitely try again."
"Deep amber just about brown. Medium sized head with a little lacing. The smell is of chocolate and an intense sweet caramel. There is a floral hop aroma as well. The taste is huge to say the least. Very bitter. Almost too bitter but the intense malt almost balances out. There is so much there. After two years of aging I think it is still too young. It was a little too much. Still good but I think the intense flavors detract from the drinkability. I will buy again but age for much longer."
"D - I don't know if I am finally developing a taste for Barleywines, or maybe this was the best one that I have had, but this was a damn fine beer that I'm grateful is one tap, because I don't think I will ever buy one of those ceramic growlers"
"Fantastic sipping beer, impossible to take big gulps. Pair this with it's unbridled development as it warms, and one can easily spend an hour just contemplating each sip. Make a night cap of this one, and have pleasant dreams."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this and absolutely consider it a favorite."
" A fantastic beer. At this price it's a special occasion drink but perfect for a cool evening."
"Drinkability - A bit heavy on the palette - I'm not sure if I can taste anything after 22 oz of this beer. Also quite expensive."
"I prefer more balance in my beers, but it's hard to disrespect it."
"D-Just outstanding. Well crafted. Full of flavor. I would have this again."
"I remember this beer from when it was among the seven ounce offerings to get around some abv law. When they were in the small bottle you had kind of a warning that you were going to get something strong. This is a strong beer and perhaps a little too hot for my taste. The Rogue house flavor doesn't work so well as this alcohol level. In general it is worth trying; just not my favorite."
"MF&D - well, there was no head because this beer is incredibly low carbonated, lending itself to have a very, very, thick body. the brew is creamy, and sticky on the glass. the whole bitter taste, along with the booming alcohol is a bit much to be perfect in the drinkability. nonetheless the beer is quite palatable for those who have the taste for it."
"Overall- You gotta try this barleywine, even if its 20 bucks a bottle. Not much else to say."
"Very good, just short of great. It's a very aggressive beer and a nice take on the style, and it'd get even better with age. I think I'll cellar a few."
"I'm going to have to pick up a couple more and try them in the future and maybe update this review."
"It's sad to say but I was expecting better things from something in a clay bottle."
"RBSG09 on tap at the Rogue Publick House in SF. Deep copper color, total clarity, thin tan head. Big caramel malty aroma, cherries, Dayquil? Raisins and caramel flavor, bread dough, hop resin, some astringency. Flavors don't mesh all that well. Decent at best."
"Not the first barleywine I'd reach for but probably not the last either."
"Drinkability is excellent. Leave it to Rogue to produce a fine brew like this. Add this to list of things I am going to try to age! Definitely a sipper, but one so enjoyable you may sip yourself into inebriation."
"Poured a cloudy copper color with a thin, yet rich white head. Nose is hops, fruits, caramel and some pine. Taste is very good. Lots of hops and you can tell this things has serious IBU. Mostly nutty and raisin, some dark fruit perhaps plum, but very discrete."
"I'm not saying it has a bad flavour, just odd."
"D. It's a 10 year old barlywine. Not sure that this category really applies. Not any less drinkable than any other brew in it's style.  "
"Best enjoyed slowly due to the booziness. I wonder if it needed to be a bit more cold but then again, the cold does nothing for a beer like this. It's been a while since I've reviewed this style. Otherwise, this is a decent beer that could probably use more aging. I wouldn't buy it again though because I've had better."
"D- Glad I had it on tap as the bottles are quite pricy and there is no way I could finish a big bottle of this. Even with being so big this was not all to hard to take down and was enjoyable. Being a Rouge product I expected big hops and while they were there they were not a problem actually enhancing the taste. I could see a uber fresh bottle of this being a problem. I need to lay one down for a decade as I would not be to inclined to open it."
"Overall a fine fine barleywine. A shining example of the american style to be honest. Most of Rogues beers are mediocre at best, but as long as your willing to pay for a disgustingly overpriced bottle, you can find good rogue brews. This one does great with age, and is nice fresh too. Definitely displays a Pacific Northwest flare. A fine beer."
"Drinkability- Very hoppy, probably couldn't down more than one, like alot of rogue ales."
"Overall, an interesting extreme beer, but something that I can only handle on occasion, as opposed to all the time."
"- Hugely drinkable as it doesn't taste strong at all, and has low to medium carbonation which is about spot on for the style..."
"2007 Vintage Ceramic bottle poured into a DFH Signature glass a slightly murky brown with crisp edges and a nice frothy light tan head. Aroma is an abundance of burnt caramel and toasted bread. The taste is a wonderfully complex blend of burnt caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toast, and dried fruits with a nice hop background. The beer certainly shows its 11.3%, but it is not too strong, just a sipper. I've always heard that this one needs some age, and it certainly comes through nicely!"
"Pours a dark red brown colored body, with a good-sized head, tan brown color, very lasting. Aroma of brown sugar, dark fruit. Syrup. Lots of scents. Sweet brown sugar taste, dark fruit too. Aged dark fruit. Dark grape taste. Extremely sweet syrupy taste. Too much for me."
"Drinkability- very drinkable beer but definitely a sipper and probably a one a nite night cap kinda beer, but I thought it was a very enjoyable example of the style I would certainly try again, If you like barleywines give this one a try good flavor but dont plan on driving anywhere after! (PS REAL TREAT ON TAP)"
"D: A unique Barleywine with the intense caramel flavor which was quite enjoyable. Not my favorite Rogue or Barleywine, but a good brew all in all and one you should try if you get the chance (but not worth going out of your way for). Rogue's one of the breweries doing some cool, original stuff and they deserve credit for this one."
"Drinkability would be excellent on this beer if it weren't for two factors: The obvious 11.5%ABV make this NOT something you want to throw back all night, although I did finish my 750 in about 2 hours. Secondly, the bitter aftertaste was unpleasant. I absolutely appreciate this beer for the complexities and balance it acheives, and I'd put it forward as an excellent example of the style, but that aftertaste started to get to me midway through my bottle."
"D: Too good, too good. I drank every last bit of the 750ml bottle. Granted over a period of two days, but I still enjoyed the beer by the end and I can't wait till I open up my other 2008 bottle years from now. Barleywines run the risk of becoming overly hoppy or, as is the case with some English barleywines, too malt forward and one dimensional. This was a beautifully crafted beer and if the look was compromised in the making of this, then so be it."
"I think 1998 Old Crusty might be past its prime - it's nowhere as tasty as the '98 J.W. Lees or the 1996 Westy 8 that I've tried. I'd be interested in checking out something from the early aughts to see if that is peaking right now. Still, I was very glad that I got to try this bottle."
"I'd imagine you could age a beer of this sort for up to a decade with measurable improvement over time, for the excess of hops begs to be tempered with age. Even so, the beer is regal when fresh."
"Drinkability: very nice for the style. A definite slow sipping beer but more than one glass could be had over the course of an evening."
"Notes: This is a very nice barleywine nicely drinkable on a cool or cold night. Cheers"
"On a technical level, I'm sure this beer achieved everything Rogue had in mind for it, and they're to be applauded as always for craftsmanship and thinking outside the box. This is ""extreme beer", proper. As a guy who paid for it and had to drink it, I'm less objective. Outside of perhaps disciplining your kids should you catch them drinking underage, I can't think of any occasion for which this beer would be appropriate."
"Pours a translucent mahogany with a fine-bubbled but not thick head (though this may be an artifact of the pour). Aroma is malty and has hints of cloves and hard cider. Flavor is strong and syrupy with a fierce alcohol bite and tones of maple syrup, caramel and hops. It is quite bitter yet has a whisper of sweetness. Texture is ragged and rough with a syrupy core."
"Best smelling barleywine I've ever had. I expected this beer to have a lot lighter hue but it presents with more of a caramel amber color. Decent carbonation for a barleywine. So for the smell, it's malt dominated with at least 3 or 4 of the best smelling types of malted barley. Almost triple like in smell but a little more oak. The taste is complex and even changes for a good while after the beer is in your stomach. Strong malt presence with a fair share of hoppy bitterness. The hops is less than I would expect from the west coast, but I feel like this balance really works. Does have a slight alcohol taste to it, but not overwhelming."
"Very malty taste to it, seems like licorice really comes through. Full-bodied with an excellent bite to it. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"Overall: This beer defines extreme beer. Love or it hate it, it is not for everyone."
"Great, extremely drinkable beer. Very hoppy but with a great floral quality and light caramel flavor. Highly recommended."
"Overall, This beer is big and brawny. tongue ripping and face numbing...everything i ever dreamed it would be. Although 15 bucks for 26 ounces of beer is whackadoo. Wish they would ditch the fancy ceramics and give us some cheaper packaging. its the recession ya'll!"
"D - This was pretty good. I'd like to see how it would taste after a couple years. Maybe the hops would mellow out."
"Overall this is one tasty barleywine. Worth a shot."
"Notes - Really tasty, strong but not overpoweringly so, a nice sipping beer."
"D: This is a well made, drinkable beer, but not one I could sit down and drink a whole lot of. Still, a solid brew."
"Overall, a very special treat indeed. As I said above, it held up better than I thought it would. The aroma was heavenly and stood out more than anything. My only complaint was that I was hoping for a thicker consistency, one that would compliment the taste. Other than that, this was definitely worthy of my 100th review."
"An intensely malty flavor at the beginning of the mouth feel followed by a sweet aftertaste typical of a barley wine style. Definitely enjoy the bitterness and alcohol content while the complex woodsy smell enveloped my palate. I bought this on tap at the Stone Brewery."
"EDIT: Tasted the 03 and 04 in a side-by-sde recently and was impressed with the way this one had ages. The abrasive hops and alcohol had calmed a good bit and really rounded this one into a fine barleywine. Score reflects this updated view."
"As it is right now, this is a great barleywine, but in a couple/three years, it will be great. I'll lay one of these down for the ages."
"Old Crustacean 2004 vintage (12 ounce bottle) pours a dark brown with a thin tan head that looks reddish when held up to the light. I can smell hops as soon as I cracked the cap, pretty impressive considering the age of the bottle. Caramel malt takes over in the aroma from there. There is a very nice mouthfeel, on the thicker side. The flavor is full, lots and lots of malt and an impressive hop presence. Alcohol is definitely present giving a peppery taste and a noticeable warming. Outstanding."
"Overall, A very hoppy barley guy, one which would surely benefit from aging, but perfect in its own way as-is."
"D- goes down easy enough. very warming on a cold night. smooth finish that keeps you wanting another sip. a must try for anyone who likes barleywines!"
"Pours a hazy mahogany with ho head. Aroma is nice and hoppy with caramel and some malt. I really like the taste. Sweet up front, smooth and malty, then turns to a strong hop bitterness. Mroe pepper and resin than citrus. The finish is more hops with caramel and toffee. The alcohol is hidden throughout, but it creeps up in the end."
" ~ This is a sippin' brew. One that I'll surely partake in again someday. It's not a brew for the meek. You need to have an open-mind before trying this beer. It can be overwhelming but I think that's part of its luster."
"Not something for everyone but I'd drink it again despite to hefty price."
"It is, of course, not something I'll be drinking one after the other in the garage while I'm putting brakes on the Jeep. It's not meant to be, but it's a nice diversion. A beer experience I'm glad I had and will likely have again. This time, I'm going to buy one a store it for 10 years. I wonder what alchemy will happen in that time."
"I should also point out this retailing for around 35-40AU in Australia. Definently worth it for something incredibly unique."
"D: This is an outstanding American Barleywine and the beer I think Rogue really shines in, a must try."
"Overall, not on my favorite list, but worth a try and a pretty darn good brew from Rogue."
"2005 vintage consumed 5/11/06. Pour out very dark out of a very dark ceramic bottle. Mmmm. This is going to be good. The aroma was assertive with roasted malt, chocolate malts, citrus hops and as the temperature rose so did the alcohol aroma. Very inviting aroma. The taste is both hop flavor and chocolate malt competing for dominance. I think it is very well balanced throughout the flavor profile. Near the end of the taste (moments before the next is to begin) I get both lingering bittering hops, roasted chocolate malts and the warmth of the alcohol. I love the taste. Scratching me right where I itch."
"D- this is one i wanted to wait longer to crack open, but since i hadnt tried it i should open one before aging the rest. glad i did. one entire bottle was enough, but i wouldnt have minded another glass. check this one out if you havnt, i cant wait to see what it becomes in a few years."
"Drinkability: This one has it's pros and cons. On the plus side, it's pretty tasty, the alcohol's well hidden, the lacing is great, and the carbonation spot on. On the down side, it's sort of one dimensional on the hop side, the alcohol is crazy high, the color's not so hot, and it's thick as a bitch. Overall, though, it's a good beer, and one I would DEFINITELY recommend on tap, and perhaps slightly less so in bottle-form, just because of its crazy expensive price."
"This beer was aged 11 years and is by far the oldest beer I have ever tried. I really like what aging can do, and plan on sitting some barleywines down for the future."
"I was a little put-off by the appearance of this beer, but it had some other positive attributes that allayed my initial fears. It poured viscous and hazy...looked like malt syrup or maybe eggnog if the primary ingredient was actually malt syrup instead of egg. I thought I was in for a malt bomb with lots of malted milk ball flavor, but that wasn't the case. Aroma was fruity, bourbon, and lots of maltiness. Still thinking that I was getting a malted milk ball. However, flavor was very mellow while still being highly malty and smooth with some nice bourbon notes. Quite good."
"D - Had this one at the Rogue Bar right after tasting their imperial stout. This would be another one that I could take my time with and not even think about switching to something else, but I was at the bar and I didn't want to pay $15 a piece to try at home. Complex, enjoyable and tasty!"
"Pours a mahogany color with a nice tan head. The nose is well balanced between the bitter hops and sweet malts. As is the flavor. This is exactly where an American Barleywine should be. Right between a Double IPA and an English Barley. Fruity hops followed by rich malts, ripe plums and cherries, carmelized candy and subtle alcohols. Full body is well carbonated. A great brew from Rogue. Maybe I will buy a bottle after all as I'm sure this will age nicely."
"I don't know if I would buy this again because of the price and uniqueness of the beer, but I would highly recommend it to any hop-head searching for the next conquest."
"D- For the style, I am having no problem tearing up the 750. It might tear me up later, though."
"The 750ml bottle is enough for the night, but by the next day I am ready for another one."
"D: Very good drinkability and enjoyment and one that shouldn't be missed."
"Not being a fan of barleywines, I was really impressed with this ale. Very tasty and easy to drink for such a big beer. The hop bitterness is pretty high, and might affect drinkability for some, but I find it necessary to keep the sweetness in check."
"Overall: No balance to be found here. If this is at all indicative of ""American Barleywine style," then I'll be sticking to the English style from here out. I could have given it a lower rating, probably, but Brewgrass just put me in such a happy, chill mood."
"A deep dark brown and cloudy color with a thin dark tan head and modest lacing. The aroma is sweet malt with a hint of raspberry and chocolate. The taste brings out thick and sweet berry malt and honey in a luxurious liquid. Lots of malt and a beautifully smooth brew. Pretty drinkable for the style."
"Holy shit. Pours out one of the most beautiful mahogany colors I've ever seen. Brown in the middle and ruby red around the edges. Liquid caramelized candy in the nose...the taste builds on it. It's pure heaven...toffee, caramel, and wood undertones. One of the silkiest beers I've ever had. To say it's incredible is a gross understatement. Too bad it is only a 7 oz. bottle. Truly exceptional."
"Drinkability: Years later and the hops are still very much prevalent. I had hoped for a deeper maltiness to have emerged, but I can be tough to satisfy in the malt department."
"Once again, kudo's to Rouge"
"This time I let the beer warm to closer to room temperature, and it served the beer well. Perhaps its just the lighting, but more of a ruby hue is apparent in the color. Aroma remains the same, but in the taste less alcohol is prevalent; dark fruits are at the forefront with subtle undertones of dark chocolate, and a bit of alcohol in the finish that burns as it goes down, with a lingering bitterness. I want to drink some more, but after having had another beer, plus this with its 11.5%... I'd better not."
"While the Barleywine is one of my favorite styles, I've put off getting to this one because of the price, and a bad experience with the XS IPA. That being said, Rogue is also one of my favorite breweries, and I just couldn't see passing this one up any longer. This is the 2007 Vintage. Pours a chocolaty brown into a snifter. A huge, bubbly dark tan and brown head sits atop and fades slowly leaving a thin, but consistent lace around the glass. Smells of sweet and dark chocolates, dark fruits (prunes and plums) yeast, big sweet malts and bread. Tastes rich and creamy, chocolaty and sweet, with an unexpected but very welcome hop hit at the end. Alcohol is fairly well hidden by the complex tastes which also include the big malts and caramel candy finish. Mouth-feel is full bodied, but goes down pretty easy. The carbonation explodes after a slight swirl. This is redemption in a glass, and I can't believe I waited this long to enjoy this first class Barleywine."
"This came in a nice 750ml ceramic bottle with gate close top. I don't remember the year, I'll have to check the bottle. Poured very thick. Very dark brown with a nice creamy head. Great aroma, hops all over the place. A bit of a sweet note on the nose as well. The taste of this beer was perfect. Nice smooth start, a little sweet, kind of fruity but then the hops kick in. Wow, great hop note. Balances the malt sweetness perfectly and complements the alcohol zing and warmth nicely. Not a beer for those who don't like hops. A neat take on the barleywine. This one will be heading for the cellar very soon! I also have the feeling that it will make regular appearances in my fridge."
"Drinkability - This is just what I expected from Rogue, a punishing amount of hops. They do a wonderful job of letting the malt keep the hops in check though. A big bold northwestern barleywine to warm the body."
"D: I love barely wines like this. I prefer ones that are more hoppy than malty. Another ace for Rogue in my book. The high ABV doesn't bother me. If you are able to finish a bottle on your own prepare to go down to the count!"
"D - This brew is so intense that I'm having a hard time finishing the 5-6ish oz I poured in the snifter. It's good overall, but there is a bit of a sensory overload going on that makes this beer a chore to drink after a few ounces. The worst aspect is the bitterness, which is almost nauseating after a point. I'll probably refrigerate the rest and try this again tomorrow night."
"Drinkability: Not for your everyday burger, but incredibly drinkable one of the best in it's class."
"2007 bottle. I poured some of it in a regular glass since I wanted to save some for later. Great appearance: extremely dark red-amber with great, fizzy lacing on the side. Aromas are thick and potent. Complex combinations of raspberries, malts, molasses, burnt sugar, roasted toffee and vanilla. Man oh man was it decadent. Taste reflects the aromas perfectly. Incredibly strong and sweet with a creamy dryness. Mouthfeel helps aid in making something thick, creamy, carbonated and complex. Overall, this is awesome."
"D: I would recommend this to Barelywine fans without hesistation. Less tart than others, and you don't get to many opportunities to have a West Coast Barleywine on tap. Not for the neophyte pallet, yet less astringent than other within the category."
"Complexity of this beer is wonderful; it has some roasted malts, some sweetness, and a huge bitterness that adds to the roasted malts. Initially the a dark roasted flavour is almost overwhelming, then the bittering hops come kick your ass, followed by a nice sweatness. The beer is pretty thick and syrupy, just like it's supposed to be. A strong flavour and bitterness isn't really hurting the drinkability of the beer, but I could easily see it turning some people off."
"drank from the ceramic bastard bottle ... 2008 . 11.5 % ... a very big bold brew .. tons of bitterness for a barleywine, but it really seems to work ... a bawdy little monkey ... wonderfully aggresive, like the starting feelings of domination ... not sure its worth it in the ceramic bottle but a very nice beer .. and even though this is a monster of a beer it really doesn't seem overdone! .. Rogue: +1"
"If you like big, hoppy beers, get this one. It's like a kicked up version of Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA"
"An outstanding American Barleywine. Highly recommended."
"Great beer for extended aging, apparently. I enjoyed this."
"Now this is a true work of art when it comes to American barleywines. Last night I had a brash one-dimensional Texas example (St Arnold DR 6) that I could hardly finish, a 12-oz bottle. But this 26 ouncer is a delight from start to finish."
"Insanely delicious. Very sweet and very hoppy, but neither of them are unbalanced enough to feel tiresome. Lovers of big beers, big hops and barleywines are urged to pay the price. And this one comes with quite the price tag...not sure what the regular bottle costs, maybe it's this fancy ceramic bottle that jacks it up ($17!)...but still, it was totally worth it."
"D) Not bad, this barleywine keeps evolving from beginning to end, as it breathes, but doesn't suprise me too much"
"From a 2007 ceramic bottle the was 750 ml in size this poured a very deep and slightly hazy copper garnet color with a very thick and long last tan hear that left great lacing. Nose of floral and citrus hops, and sweet malts. Mouthfeel thick and oily . Flavor is sweet and slightly bitter, and you sure notice the alcohol.burn. Bitter finish. However the 11.5% alcohol starts to numb the tongue near the finish. This probably could have used another year on the shelf. Served at cellar temperature - 55 degrees."
"this is not going to be an amazing review but this stuff was outstanding. Deep brown color and relativley clear for how dark it was. No head. It had a deep malty aroma of molases and dark fruit with some hops too. Man this has a awsome taste. So malty and so hoppy and so high in alcohol but it all blends to perfection. It has a bitter aftertaste maybe because there are 120IBUs in this sucker. Well after three of us shared this bottle and haveing two drinks before it I was drunk...so...be carefull with this one it's a top notch sipper!"
"D : Pretty good but I'd probably let it wait a year or two."
"This stuff is just pure nector to me!"
"If you find one, taste one. No need to sell your soul for one though."
"Overall: Well, if you can get a bottle for $10, then it is worth a try. I bought this at the Toronado BW fest in 2007 and saved it until my bro came and visited. I had it in the fridge for 1.5 years. I hope the 1996 is better."
"I'm not usually a fan of barleywines, but I can think of better go to's than this. Not feeling it."
"Been looking for this for a LONG TIME! Being a rouge junkie and a barleywine junkie i was excited to find this. 2006 vintage in one of their over priced fancy ceramic bottles. Pours almost syrup like a dark dark red amber, a head is quick to form but quick to fade as well. As most rogues go its not terribly balanced and heavy on the ibu's but that is not a bad thing! Bought two bottles one to enjoy now and one to enjoy when i graduate from vet school, i truly enjoyed it however with old guardian and old ruffian being just as enjoyable at 1/3 the price not sure how often ill drink it, rogue chocolate stout is my most popular beer but its also 1/4 the cost of this. All in all a stand up beer but like alot of their xs line its not cheap and their are equal beers for far less money."
"2001 vintage bottle. Pours amber with a surprisingly great head given the abv and age. Smells big, bready, and slightly oxidized, but it is slight and the overall aroma is very nice. The taste is huge, and surprisingly bitter and dry, Much of the sweetness has gone out of this one and created more of an old ale. Very little citrus or oine flavors, just an earthy bitterness underlying the malty notes. The extreme earthiness of this one makes it a bit hard to drink too much of it, and that same bitterness coats the mouth as well. Very, very different to how i remember this fresh, and certainly more challenging in a way, but still good."
"Drinkability - This has pretty decent drinkability as far as a barleywine is concerned. It is still pretty damn bitter, and that is the only thing that is keeping me from drinking this one down very fast. It needs some age to bring the hops down and the malts up, but I have a feeling that if I have enough patience, in a couple of years this brew is going to be stunning. If you are in the mood for hops, this will destroy your palate in the right kind of way."
"D - Not bad, hope to trade for more in the future because I would love to see how this thing ages."
"Well I have had this beer both fresh and aged but it time to write a review. The bottle I am reviewing is a 2002 from my cellar. The beer is still hoppy to the nose and taste after all this time. The aging has rounded the edges and seemingly taken some of the heat from the finish. There are old fruit notes mixed with woodsy pine notes as the beer goes across the tastbuds. This is a great American barley wine that INMHO needs at least 3-7 years in the cellar."
"If you like a maltier barleywine, this isn't it. Given the resilience of chinook hops, I imagine there will still be a lot of grapefruit even after years of aging. But the malt backbone isn't a plain-jane like most DIPAs. I really dig it."
"This beer is like a hammer on the head. Bomb! Numb face."
"Drinkability- I love it, but it is so hoppy, it gives me heartburn. A lot of my non-hop-heads would hate it. But if you like Barley wines, and 13 year old Rogue Old Crusty is hard to beat."
"This poured a dark reddish brown, very thick, with a sweet and yeasty scent. It had a heavy texture with a good blend of yeast and hops to create a balanced aftertaste. There wasn't much malt in the flavor, however, and the bitterness quickly built with every sip. After a while it developed more of a sour flavor and wasn't very easy to drink."
"Recommended..."
"Poured into a chalice a nice deep brown color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy tannish head, which left a nice puddle of sticky lacing in the center of the glass. The nose is malty, hoppy, nice tone of spices, dark fruits, and caramel. The taste is very nice and smooth for a brew this high in ABV, malty, nice hoppyness, slight spice, getting some dark fruits, and caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, one of the easist drinking BW I've had to date, highly recommended."
"Drinkability- Nice. I would love to try it again next year and see what more age has done to it."
"Poured a dark murky cola color with no carbonation and no head. Smells of sweet fruit and malts with a hint of alcohol and some yeasty bread. The taste has a bite to it almost spicy. There is no hop bitterness and this is now all sweet malts. There are fruit flavors, currants and raisins and maybe some prune. Also some chocolate notes which makes the flavor richer. The alcohol is present but its not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick like a thin mole sauce, spicy yet sweet. The drinkability is a little low but I would drink another if given the chance. Now I'm going to have to get a current version to compare the two."
"D: A lot of character but a bit too cloying I though, even for the style. Seems like there's something little holding this one back from being great. Still worth a try though."
"Still... Rogue being Rogue... I can't really imagine that I'd like it young!"
"d - not very drinkable due to price, strength in alcohol and flavor, but worth picking up a bottle or two, i'd love to have one aged for a long time but i doubt i could leave it hanging out for long enough"
"I bought suberb brew this at the Headkeepers Tapas Bar in my hometown in a 750 m.l. ceramic flip top bottle, dated 2006. I am an avid fan of American Barleywines and this one is definately a keeper. It poured well into a 21 1/8 fl. oz. crystal snifter (and my friends call me a snob). It had a strong, sweet aroma reminiscant of Dogfish Head Olde School Barleywine. There was very little lasting head and no lacing. The taste was sweet and fruity, with a nice warming sensation in the mouth. I will definately be looking forward to the next release date for Old Crustation this upcomming year."
"I'll save these for a special day - maybe one that ends in ""y""
"An all around surprise that breaks all the rules about how the genere should smell or taste. True Pacific Northwest in hop style and almost patronizing to the old world traditions of high gravity. Good right now, and I'm going to bank on a whole case to throw in my basement on the suspicion that this will only get better."
"D- You'd be hard pressed to enjoy the whole bomber... without pissing yourself. However, you must try this beer, and I think in about 4 years, after some harshness is gone from the hop profile, it may well be around a 4.9."
"Will be drinking again!"
"Overall- Different offering and hoppy as hell. My first Randalized offering and I am ready for more. Definitely puts a new spin on things..."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's definitely on the thick side. Carbonation has held up well. It's very smooth and drinkable. Probably its strength limits its drinkability, but it's certainly a pleasure. Alcohol is noticeable, but it's blended well and certainly not overly noticeable. Overall, this is a pleasure to drink. Perhaps I should start cellaring beer. I definitely appreciate having a friend that does."
"d: This certainly a sipper and I'm glad I had some help from alhrabosky with this one. I'll look for the 7oz bottles next time rather than the 750ml."
"D: Nice beer to sip on. One crock of this stuff is all any beer drinker would need. Even professionals like me. Barley wine beers are my second favorite beer. This on is one of the best I've tasted. High on alcohol, but really good."
"Overall this brew is a beauty from head to toe. I'll be sad when the cask is done, thought that might take a while."
"Still has maintained it's hops...how the hell can this be as hoppy as it is? It's more hoppy than any fresh barleywine I've had! Carbonation has decreased and is much smoother. Just can't believe how hoppy this is."
"Again, for the price it was great because I never wanted to spend the fifteen dollars on it before, suprised to see on tap here, not bad for a barleywine and I would recommend to any fans of Rogue that are curious"
"Overall, an interesting barleywine, but not nearly ready to drink. I thought two years may have been enough for this one to be drinkable, but now I think it could have used another eight. It's still a train wreck of flavors, and needs to round out quite a bit more. Not bad, just not ready. A little pricey (due to the gimmicky bottle), but worth it if you have the patience. I'd buy it again, but not until I have a proper cellar to hold something as long as this needs to be held."
"The taste is extremely bitter. Lots of grapefruit and citric hops that stings at the back of the throat, nice malty taste and a warming alcohol. I cant wait to age a bottle for a couple of years but I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would."
"D- so strong, so intense, so raw and gritty, yet so sophisticated and refined. a brew this exceptional should be saved for special occasions. i'm giving a 3.5 because it should not be consumed easily or massively...it should be an XSperience..."
"Wow - this is an AWESOME American barleywine. Delicious, aggressive, rich, well-balanced for style. A work of brewing art - one of the best (if not the best) American barleywines I've had! Highly recommended!"
"Served at the Old Toad. It poured a murky brown. Very little head. Looks like the water at the bottom of a lake if you stir it around with your foot. It smells nutty, piny, and boozy. The taste is complex, but I think it has too much of a boozy affect. It starts out clean and malty then snaps back with a raw hop bite. As soon as the hops start to regress the alcohol rolls in for a dry and slightly chemical finish. A very warming drink as the autumn starts to roll in."
"Drinkability: A very good barley wine. Lots of hops, overall balanced really nicely. Would buy it again for sure."
"D- Not to good. I think with a nice smooth carbonation it would of been quite a bit better. Just really strong and hot flavors. I would like to try one with about 5 years of age instead of 10."
"Drinkability - I am glad I have another of these aging!"
"Notes: This is a beer that needs a lot of time, and then some more time. The crazy bitterness of this one made my head spin, and I would hope that a few years would smooth that out a bit. Anyway, there is a great gem of a beer hidden away somewhere in there. You just have to dig to find it."
"This brew was a nice hop treat. I let it warm up a little, then the flavors really poured out. The dark amber smelled like a hop explosion, piney, resinous and thick. Alcohol was noticeable but not overwhelming. Flavors were dominated by hops- oily goodness, coming in waves. Malts played second, slightly sweet, roasted and complex. There was a bittersweet medicinal taste in the pair and combined it was delicious. Squeaky clean finish, i would put it up against rogues imperial IPA as a hop dream any day."
"Don't drink and review."
"M&D: with an oily and syrupy-rich palate sparkled by micro-scopic fizziness, this is an absolutely 120%-bodied barley wine benefiting from a liveliness unlike any 5-year-old strong ale. As it breathes, the alc. edge considerably softens (or maybe because my tongue and throat have got used to it?!), allowing for a more colourful display of hops and malts. I can't imagine how it might have tasted when it was younger, while I take it that there's still plenty of room for it to mature, maybe for another five years~~ Recommended for patient, small sipping, better shared in small quantities as a digestif."
"I have had this beer long ago, and have even heard recently how bitter this beer was, but I was still a bit surprised by how tongue scrapingly hoppy the bitterness of this beer is; even in this obviously aged sample it still dominates the finish with an unwavering grip. With the lightish body, and without the dark color, this would almost pass for a modern day double IPA; though it might perhaps be a mediocre example. I will have to try a fresh bottle of this soon to see what that is like."
"D- very smooth and enjoyable"
"Mouth is medium and it feels nice. I'd rate this higher for drinkability if there were the choice of buying this in a regular bottle or the ceramic but since there really isn't, I won't be buying this again unless I find these old vintages."
"Poured into a 16oz glass, beer was dark brown with a red hue and about an inch of head; very creamy with good carbonation and moderate lacing. Smell had distinct grain odor with a hint of cherry, but without an overpowering alcohol smell. The taste is very bitter and the high ABV comes through strong, initially masking the complexity. You can definitely taste the grain and the the hops. Also leaves quite a lasting bitter aftertaste on the tongue. Mouthfeel is heavy with a residual that I can bite as if unfiltered to the bottle. The is a great novelty beer but you aren't going to be drinking a lot of it at any given sitting. I must point out that the bottle it comes in is worth trying this beer."
"2003 vintage. Aggressive pour yields a huge 2"" head, creamy dark beige. Body is a cloudy, thick looking brown. Good head retention. Smell is all malty sweet molassas. Taste is quite surprising. Yeah, the malts are there, but putting up one hell of a fight are the hops. Can you believe that shit? 4 years old and the hop presence is still all over this bad boy. Mouthfeel is fine. Smooth. Little to no carbonation in the body. Alcohol is fairly well hidden, but there's no doubt it is lurking aboot. Bittersweet and strong, this on is a sipper."
"750ml painted ceramic bottle poured into a pint glass. The aroma is dominated with dark fruits, malt, caramel and alcohol. The taste starts off pretty mellow, but the hops quickly kick in and give you a nice smack in the face. There is a lingering bitterness of the hops in the finish to accompany the expected warming from the 11% alcohol. Overall, Old Crusty is a wonderful Barley Wine. I look forward to having one after it ages for a while as well. Recommended."
"Poured in a Rapscallion glass, formed a scant 1/8"" tan head over the barely translucent reddish brown brew. Head is gone in a flash down to swirl and tiny rim bubbles, with delicate but lasting lacing. Aroma is heavy sweetness and musty alcohol. Taste starts with earthy grains, quickly switching to alcohol, which almost seems to evaporate off the tongue. Mouthfeel is excellent for this style and age, and drinkability pretty nice as well. Glad I got to try this one with this much age under its cap."
"Drinkability - this is very good. High abv holds down sessionability."
"Lucky to try this from the puny bottle my buddy Jim dug out of his cellar. Looks the same and smells the same as my previous review. Flat. Very oxidized, think drinking sherry out of a cardboard box. Sweet, ancient. More academic than anything else, I'm afraid it's past the prime of life. Still a fine example of an aged beer."
"This beer is a monster. I would like to taste this after it has been cellared for a few years so it has a chance to mature. This may the most leafy beer I have ever had. Although my tongue is already numb, I can see the potential greatness in this brew. At this time however, this beer to green and aggressive to get the top scores it will get when it has a chance to mellow."
"An enjoyable sipper for those who like the hops. Not an everyday beer, but a nice treat."
"The mouthfeel comes off as a little thin, and at times a little overcarbonated. But this is still a very nice barleywine and well worth the high price. I look forward to this year's incarnation."
"Taste is a bit odd for me. Mostly nutty and raisin, some dark fruit perhaps plum, but very discrete. The feel is a bit buttery or creamy, not my cup of 'tea'. Yet it is still good. I prefer some other BWs to this."
"What a beer this becomes after 10 years."
"Geez, Louise, thanks to timtheenchanta in BIF46 for this superb brew!!"
"The drinkability, for a barely wine in particular, is pretty high. It is very robust though and of course super strong, but if you like barleywines, old crusty goes down like butter. A fantastic barleywine!"
"For my 100th review, I grabbed this one out of the fridge. The last Old Crusty I had is still seared in my memory as the most bitter beer I've ever had. Adding a couple more years takes more of the bitterness off and this starts to become a nicely balanced beer. Too bad it's so expensive to purchase these days since it's a great beer."
"A good, brutally bitter sipper, but not very sesionable. Another barleywine for the hop heads, and i may have found this more drinkable at the start of our session as opposed to the end. May try this one again, but i wont be looking for it anytime soon."
"This beer definitely holds up well, and probably would continue to age for many years."
"bottle is really nice though. Maybe I'll make a lamp out of it."
"This barley wine is not for the weak or faint of heart. Prerequisites should be a palate trained like a ninja crossed with a navy SEAL, and the stomach of a concrete elephant. Either way, after downing a bottle of this stuff on your own, you'll still be singing that song about the goblin... As with all of Rogue's extreme ales, I feel as if they should be sampled and experienced at least once, and then returned to depending on one's intestinal fortitude and how far their wallet can stretch."
"Thick brown/red with a tan head. Very hazy and nice. Nose is sweet alcohol, good for the style. Taste is very sweet, some malts, lots of alcohol, and a hoppy finish. Pretty complex, this could probably use some cellaring to even it out."
"Bottled in 2004, 12 oz bottle. Pours almost black, but with reddish tints and caramel highlights. Minimal head, as would be expected for the style (and the ABV). The aroma is a bit rough -- it says ""I need more time in the bottle"". Rough hop notes vie with still-crystalline sugary malts. Pine, graham cracker, and caramel all mix here. On the tongue, very sweet first off with nutty malts and caramel, before moving into malt bitterness gradually through the mid-palate. By the time the finish rolls around, the hops are out in full force, leaving an entrenched, earthy bitterness in their wake. Mouthfeel is extra thick, as expected, with more carbonation than I expected as well. We'll see how time affect that particular element. Overall, this is a promising American barleywine, and one that could show a whole lot of complexity and balance with aging, but as of now it does not match up with the best of the genre."
"This is the most vile concoction I have ever had. I poured this one down the drain rather quickly. I guess I just didn't get the point. The 120 IBU's were not counter balanced by anything making for a nasty taste from start to finish. I'm not normally pissed off finding a beer I don't like but dropping serious coin for this bomber did the trick."
"D: Excellent barleywine, would get this again for sure."
"This is an intriguing brew. I find bigfoot hit's a good spot for me starting at 6 years old. I think this would probably do the same at 10 years. The only caution I might have to putting to much money into this beer in the cellar is the carbonation. Faint as it is I'd hate to find it is not up to the task of aging to what this beer seems to be capable of. Kudos to himerman for the trade and to all those aging these away. I think I must go put a 6 pack away for future years!"
"I'm afraid this beer really needs to age in order to mellow and blend some more. This one was too raw."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"An outstanding example of its style, and one which I've bought a lot of, and will buy a lot more of."
"Overall: A good beer in its own right, though this is not what I expected from a barelywine. I was not familiar with the high-hopped American style, and believe I prefer the English."
"12 oz bottle dated 2002. This was the Bull and Bush vintage beer of the month. This thing had absolutely no head which is not surprising for a barleywine. The color was a dark orange-brown and cloudy. I couldnt pick up much smell from this beer. The taste was good with a hint of chocolate and a little nutty. I could taste the hops as well. The one thing I didnt like is the Rogue taste I detect in all their beers. Maybe its the pacman yeast but I just dont like it. The alcohol was fairly well hidden in the taste but I sure noticed it as soon as I was finished sipping. What a letdown, out of all the Rogue beers I have tried I only liked a 2004 Imperial Stout."
"Not something to drink everynight but I will definately find some more occasions for it."
"In summation, I would say that if anyone thinks that they are ready for a barley wine, they should start with this one. It is a good alternative to ice cream for an after-dinner snack."
"Cheers!"
"Glad I found this on-tap at CAH in Richmond, because I've been wanting to try it but was hesitant to spend $14 on a bottle. Definitely glad I tried it, but I won't be buying the bottle anytime soon. A very intense beer that I'm sure would get a little better with some age on it."
"pours brown with a tan head. lots of tiny little bubbles rising through the brown body. looks good for a barleywine. Smells very sweet, with floral hops and alcohol. Taste is very bitter and very sweet and malty. Some floral hops flavors, along with a smokiness that's quite nice. bitterness would probably fade a bit more with time, but its good to go now as well. i might age one just for fun anyway to see how it changes. Good to sip and takes a while to get through the whole thing."
"Pours a solid dark brown with a tan head that is gone before you blink. The smell is hoppy and sweet, smells similar to many Rogue beers; also you can detect the alcohol. I am picking up some fruits, maybe some citrus. A very aromatic barleywine. Do not gulp this one, it will knock you to the floor. This thing is packed to the brim with flavor. Starts sweet with the fruit which quickly turns to the hops and bitterness. Ends with a soft finish because the beginning packs quite a punch. The aftertaste is mostly bitter, with hints of the citrus. The mouthfeel is warming and smooth, goes down like a smooth whiskey. A great sippin beer. I gave it a lower drinkability score because of its harshness, but do not let that scare you away from trying this beer. Another solid offering from Rogue."
"Good job by Rogue. I will purchase this again."
"Anyway, I look forward to trying this again after a BIG meal. (and I'm guessing it would probably end up with a higher score at that point...I'll edit it if so)"
"Warm, creamy mouthfeel. Very satisfying without being too chewy and over-the-top. Very nicely balanced and actually rather palatable, all things considered."
"Boy was i delighted to find this one in not the new bottles, but in an old 12 ouncer with the old guy on the cover. Pours a murky reddish color unlike any ive seen from a beer thus far. Smell was of sweet sugar, whiskey, molasses, overly ripe dark fruit, a bit of chocolate...lots of good stuff. No question about it, this is one heavilt hopped barleywine. The dark fruit flavors and maple syrup hits you up front, followed by the hops in the background coating your tongue. I've had this beer once before when it was young, and I can definitely say that this beer needs some aging. This one (with the extra year) was a whole lot better then the first one i tried. Its a real sipping beer. If you happen upon it, give it a try. Im not a barleywine lover per se, but im real glad i had this one."
"Flavour is chalk full of malt, that coats the mouth like a sweet nectar or sticky candy. A long, lingering resonance is felt as much as it is tasted. Such a balance between hop bitterness and malt finish. Same can be said for the balance in the aroma. One hell of a beast - but ... refined and balanced. Hints of alcohol can come and go, but never disturb the flavour and if anything, compliment the character. A fantastic barley-wine, great candidate for cellar (defintely has improved with age) and one I keep finding guilty pleasure treating myself when going back to."
"Bottled in 2002, 12 oz. bottle, 120 IBU ! Pours a cloudy, alomst muddy chestnut color. Thick tan foamy head which held very well for the strength and age. Huge candy caramel aroma, along with floral, citrusy and piney hop aroma. Still a great amount of hop aroma for being 4 years old. Dark toffee, caramel, a bit of chocolate are the flavors at first. Finishes with some piney and citrusy hop flavor, along with some burnt notes. The burnt flavor seems overwhelming until this warms up even more. Still intensely bitter, I can't imagine how raw this is fresh. Very low carbonation. This doesn't seem to have aged as well as I hoped, but it did improve as it set out."
"D: The bang for the buck was terrible, $13 for a malt bomb that falls short on the hop side."
"D- You need to be in the mood for this one. Very intense and super drinkable."
"Four years old at sampling, but still quite an intense beer here. Color is garnet, with decent head but little lacing - we'll blame that on the high alcohol content. Smell is quintissentially barleywine: lots of dark fruit, hops, alcohol, and sweet malts. Taste is very similar, but with a certain harshness in the finish, could be from roasted malt or perhaps from the hops (120 IBU's!). Smells better than it tastes, I think. Mouthfeel is smooth but syrupy, good carbonation for the style. Drinkability isn't great - harsh finish and high alcohol make this a special occasion beer, and I think I prefer Bigfoot, regardless."
"D - I could hardly finish a single glass. Good, yet average. Could be extraordinary with a few years of aging"
"Bought the fancy ass XS series cermaic like bottle. Amazing presentation. This poured a deep maroon color with an awesome brown colored head. The body was quite hazy. THe nose was nice but nothing extraordinary. I thought it was actually kinda mild in the hop department. This tasted almost wine like or a strong belgian. It was really malty which is nice, I am sick of DIPA style barleywines. The mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy."
"This beer pours out of a beautiful ceramic bottle. Included is a rubber seal, but I'm pretty sure that any BA won't need to use it, as they will finish it in one sitting ;) The color is a dark complex brown, with layers and floaties much like a Quad. Huge smell, although its hard to explain... The initial taste is of alcohol but that isnt to say it not well balanced. Lots of hops and fruits, which add up to a very impressive nose. There is a lot added, and it goes down almost syrup-like. Mouthfeel and drinkability are lower because of the lingering alcohol taste, and the slightly bitter after taste. Overall a beer to seek out for sure."
"Just had some of this in the new ceramic bottle. First of all the bottle is beautiful, A+ on the packaging. Never being a big Barleywine type of guy i was a little impressed with how tasty and more drinkable than others i have had in the past. Deep dark color, almost a little red. There was no head and very little carbonation, which is common with barleywines. however the taste was really good."
"I must make my way back to my ""secret spot"" to see if any remain. Not only for me, but also for Holiday giving. This is one of the best aging barleywines I have ever had."
"D - Good, strong, distinct flavor, but don't drink too much. I was feeling like it was a bit too much flavor too handle. Maybe more of a winter brew because of its savory quality. Not a thirst-quencher."
"Worth a try, and only one."
"Still is an exceptional beer with the hops still kicking some ass. A lovely nightcap for a cold winter night."
"Drinkability: Certainly not something I can handle more than one bottle of in one sitting. I do hope that whoever buys this in the big ceramic flip-tops shares it with a friend or two, because at 11% ABV and 120 IBUs, this is one rude brew."
"Overall/Drinkability: WOW. Just wow.The Sophia Loren of graceful agers, this was a simply sublime drinking experience. 5+ years have mellowed and deepened the flavors to an impressive degree. Very similar, again, to the Great Dane's aged barleywine. So different than any other bottled barlywines out there, it's certainly earned a place of its own in the pantheon of amazing American beer."
"Drinkability: This is one of the most fantastic beers I've tasted, with truly unique flavors and the kind of depth and development of flavors desirable in a barleywine. Nonetheless, it achieves a unique blend and balance that makes this stand out. The hops development stands out against other more one-dimensional use of hops, while the malts are rich while remaining fruity. Neither mellow like Old Foghorn, nor abrasive like Old Ruffian, Old Crustacean really stands on its own. Superb."
"2002 Vintage, 12 oz. Pours a ruby red to brown in color with basically no head. Bottle conditioned cloudiness. Smell is rich of sweet malts, some pruniness, ripe cherries and raspberries, perfuminess and a hint of piney hoppiness that is enveloped in a good size boozy aroma. Taste is nice and rich as well with good malt sweetness up front, red licorice, caramel, and finishing with a strong alcohol flavor and warmth. The hops are far from a fresh sample of this one but are still present in the finish, peppery and dry. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly thinned from aging. This one is drinking well now, but could definitely go longer in the cellar to let more of the malt flavor come through, although fresh its raw power is also enjoyable."
"750 ml black ceramic bottle with a swing-top lid. I think this is a pretty cool added touch to the presentation. Poured into an Imperial pint glass about half full. With the handy swing-top lid I'll be working on this bottle for the rest of the weekend. It has a creamy white head, about a finger width and recedes to a solid lace that last all the way to the end. Color is a fantasticly rich mahogany and clear. Smell is sweet like molassas and caramel malt. Taste is very complex. It starts out very earthy and malty, but as you finish the swallow it ends up being very hoppy and bitter. There are also some coffee notes around the edges. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body. Medium carbonation. This is a fantastic barley wine. I'm definately going to get more to cellar"
"Damn drinkable and a damn fine barleywine."
"Served from a 7oz bottle into snifter glasses. This beer was bottled in 1998. What a treat that I have been waiting for. The beer poured a deep cloudy brown color with some noticeable sediment throughout the bottle that made its way into the glass. The beer had a nice sweet fruity aroma of raisins, plums. Very similar to a port-like aroma which I happen to enjoy. The taste was had a sweet fruit, malty hit upfront that was balanced out slighty by the present hops. Which each sip from the snifter the tastes intensified and the spicey alcohol character got a little more intense. Worth the wait and worth another try in time."
"Overall I will buy as much as they have next time I am up in Milwaukee."
"A classic IMO regardless of the year, but an eight year old batch of this barleywine is as heavenly as it gets in the American craft beer world."
"D - Pretty good. Not the most balance among the flavors in this brew but still quite interesting. A pretty nice barleywine."
"Mouthfeel is very oily, very much like a liqueur, but the finish is short and clean. After warming just slightly, it smooths out considerably. The complexity is intriguing for this grandaddy of barleywines, and age only helps."
"This beer pours a rusty copper color with a tan head that holds and laces nicely but eventually fades. The smell is not overpowering but there is still the smells of dark berry fruits, chocholate and some hops. The taste is very similar to the smell with still a good amount of hops hanging around after all the aging but also a considerable amount of residual sugars lingering in the beer. The beer has a good thickness with a significant amount of dryness and smooth carbonation. Overall a nice barleywine, certainly one worth picking up."
"D - high, a good barleywine, very easy to drink"
"Ruby complexion with a slightly green tinted head or maybe it was all the hops that were assulting me or maybe the large malt waves had washed out my mooring. Wow this is much better aged. The hops are still very prevelant and the I feel like I am taking a wort shower. The taste is pretty nice and complex with the malt and a I must say there is a touch of fusel but it seems to be right. You could eat this with a spoon. Good beer to relax with after it has relaxed. ;-)"
"Overall an intense barley wine. In my opinion not quite as accessible as say a Big Foot. But, definitely more extreme."
"Thick, chewy on the tongue with lots of lingering hops in the aftertaste. Excellent sipping for a cool, rainy afternoon. Not for big gulps but perfect for sipping and conversation."
"Red, mostly brown color, tan head that quickly went away leaving no lacing or anything behind. Very malty backbone, caramel and dark fruit, with a floralness not far behind. Very nice caramel maltiness, but the hops are not blended enough, there is the maltiness and then a very strong bitterness following. Pretty good but I think needs some age to perfect its flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a low carbonation level. Took quite a while to finish the glass, but perhaps I'll age one for a few years, I imagine it could turn out quite nicely."
"Cheeers!"
"I've had enough barley wine now to not be overwhelmed by this one. Maybe I'd pick up a $3 12 ounce every once in awhile, but I wouldn't bother with $13+ ceramic bottles."
"Notes: These huge barleywines like Old Guardian and this Old Crustacean are so incredible with a few years of age on them. Drink a few now and drink a few later. For those folks that are cellaring this bad boy and are wondering when to drink it I'd say that although now is Awesome, another year or two would still do this some good."
"An excellent beer... one to share."
"On tap at Pizza Plant Walker Center. Served in 10-ounce goblet. Deep rubied brown with dense beigeish-brown head. This was served from a refrigerated keg, and therefore too cold for a barleywine, but I was still able to pick up armoas of sweet caramel malts, bourbon soaked cherries and a menacing pine forest of hops. The huge, sweet, malty beginnings of this first sip are immediately thrashed into oblivion by the most massive, earth-scorching hop bitterness I've ever encountered. Woody, pine-struck acridity lingers infinitely...or so it seems. I don't know when this one was kegged, but it sure as hell tastes fresh to me. A bubblegum sweetness tries to emerge as the beer warms. Huge, chewy mouthfeel; medium body. My impression is that this is a promising barleywine if properly aged for a number of years -- like at least three. Right now, at least, the drinkability has to be low, because the hops are almost too obnoxious to really enjoy. I'm all for palate expansion, but beer drinking shouldn't ever feel like a chore."
"Quite the fine Barley wine."
"This beer was part of a Rogue sampler I offered to some friends. I liked this better than they did. It was a dark red/brown color with a thick white head and some interesting lacing. I could detect fruit, wine, and caramel in the odor. The taste was all hops, and more hops, with some sweetness. Mouthfeel was just a touch cloying, but still a nice beer."
"Pours a beautiful deep ruby red with a larger head than I'd expected, given the style and ABV, that is a light tan, lasts well, and leaves the most incerdible creamy lacing. Smell is big, with port and rum alcohol apparent, and some currant, plum, and spices coming through with the fairly light hops. Taste is bold, with good hoppiness on top of the cherry, currant, and plum fruitiness. Plenty of port wine grapes and a touch of hot alcohol are also in the mix. Tastes are complex, but not exceptionally well balanced. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, not cloying or oppressive, but promoting a finish that seems to go on forever. Drinkability is pretty good, but a bit more balance would improve it markedly. A great barleywine, but just a touch too over the top to be truly stupendous. Might improve with age."
" In comparison to the 2002 bottled version, this draft Old Crusty has not mellowed nearly as much. I consider myself a hophead, but this needs more time. I wonder if I should even attempt to drink one of the younger, ceramic bottles. I think I'll wait."
"D - The drinkability is bad, even for a barleywine. A few of us shared the gigantic ceramic fifth. My half glass was a distressing chore to finish. It might improve with age. I will pass in the future unless some tells me it was well aged. Sessions unthinkable. Food might be okay, if the beer was."
"This pours a very dark ruby with a huge tan foamy head. The smell is very strong and very good. The armo has alot of fruit,raisins, prunes,or grapes, and a fair amount hops. The bottle says this is a 2003 vintage,so I lucked out. The taste has a creaminess to it that lessons the high alcohol content. You can still feel the alcohol,but the fruit and hops have more of a presence. The m/f is heavy and the flavors are very well balanced. Too many barleywines have too much of a dark fruit flavor that there almost like brandy,but Rogue does it right with a good mix of fruit and hops."
"The high abv and strength of flavor demands attention when drinking this beer. The very antitheses of a session beer, drink and enjoy slowly and in moderation."
"Overall, a great experience. Recommend anyone in the Toronto area who is a fan of this beer head to Beerbistro. They have 4 different vintages of Old Crustacean in the cellar (1997, 98, 2001, 2002 I believe), and it would be really cool to see how it ages over time (although at $12 CDN a pop it better be a special occasion)."
"I don't have a huge Americal Barley Wine or even a big Barley Wine background for comparison, but this is some interesting stuff. I'm not huge on the style but this is an awesome experience. I need to get another one to cellar. Maybe a couple more."
"2002 bottling obtained from Liquor Max in Fort Collins. Pours a half finger of light brown head. Thick frothy mat on top of a slightly cloudy dark brown liquid. Smells of alcohol, chocolate, pine-sol hops, and soured caramel. Tastes alcoholic, chocolate, caramel, hop bitter. Sharp crisp pine mixes with the alcohol to make a sort of winter-fresh character. As it warms, the hops begin to dominate and turn the beer more towards pine-sol characteristics. A very intense and somewhat brutal beer. Not one I'm fond to try again. Thick dextrinous mouthfeel and modest carbonation."
"This beer poured a dark foggy brown with light red highlights giving it the appearance of cherry Coke. When I poured it, my glass was a third barley wine, a third head and the remaining third was a sluggish combination of the two. It took a few seconds to settle, and was a lot of fun to admire. The head then quickly fell to a ring. Smelled of sweet caramel malt with some milk chocolate, prunes, maraschino cherries and a solvent alcohol that was mixed into a resinous pine hops. The flavor began with an up front dry pine then picked up some sweet cream and a delightful woody barley. Finished with a dark chocolate and some intense dry piney hops with an alcohol burn. Unfortunately, I inhaled through my mouth while drinking and choked on solvent vapors. The mouth feel was medium bodied and sticky with a light carbonation. This is an alright beer thats a little heavy on the hops with a far too obvious alcohol. This could definitely stand to spend some time in the cellar."
"Having said that, the mouthfeel definitely impressed me. It's very thick and syrupy, just like a good barleywine should be."
"I trust Draegers San Mateo to pick good beers from this list and others - but I had a 750 ml of old crustacean barley wine and it was vile. Could be a corked / bunk bottle, but this stuff was seriously unrefined, and I can take a foul arrogant bitter ale with the best of them, but this stuff was not worth the price. Shame on those who charge top buck for foul ups. I was chowing on Nice and McChouffe for a comparison and there was none. If you pay 10 - 15 for 500 - 750 mls, the stuff should be erotic. Rogue is now for me UNTRUSTED for charging and brewing this crap."
"This is the best barleywine I've tried so far (best out of two). It's quite an interesting style - not what I'm used to, but I respect it."
"Somewhat murky, reddish and garnet in color. Big hoppy and grassy aroma Sort of ""locker room"" sweat which doesnt mean a bad thing. Big sweet malty flavor-alcohol burn is slight though right upfront. Serious hop levels. Great grapefruit flavors. Slick and oily mouthfeel. Very viscuous on the tongue. A hell of a beer. Get some."
"Would love to try this without that salt water taste, as it really affected the drinkability."
"Drinkability: One to sip and enjoy. Take your time. Light a fire and enjoy a winter day with this one. Very nice. Another winner from Rogue."
"Overall, this isn't exactly the most well balanced Barleywine Style Ale but I do find it a quite enjoyable brew to sip on. I recommend it."
"This is one intense barley wine! Almost too intense for me. Very intense, robust, malty and dark flavor with a hop finish so strong that it destroys everything in its path. Its so powerful its hard to review. Apparently the IBUs on this one is around 120 and I can believe it. The sharp scent on this draft pour is raw and smells like cough syrup. There is something likeable about this barley wine but I cant put my finger on it, perhaps its surviving the intense ride. Its not very drinkable though, a sipping beer for occasional use."
"2004-12oz. bottle. Pours a dark copper to bergundy with minimal head which recedes to only a ring after a short time. Nose is huge and complex, full of garden scents, rasins, and alcohol. Taste is a slam of fruits up front with raisins, spicy peppers, onions? It's all balanced by a strong malt backbone which gives texture of biscuits or toast...aftertaste has a strong but not unpleasant alcoholic warmth. I had bought this with intentions of aging it but got impatient as tends to happen, enjoyed it nevertheless however. Out of a limited number of barleywines i've sampled so far this is my favorite, edging out Stone's Old Guardian on the basis of more flavor...less burn."
"Last swigs: If I never have another Crusty, I won't mind. This one had a bit too much flour dough and a bit too few fruit notes. Decent, but the flour aspect was a sticking point."
"This is an amazing barleywine that has earned a spot in my top shelf. While other breweries often stumble in perfectly balancing the massive hops, malt, and alcohol in this style, Rogue truly shines. Of those I have tried in the style, this is the benchmark to aspire towards. These should also age extremely well and I look forward to re-reviewing in the future."
"Nice mouthfeel with a pleasant bitterness. Fairly easy to drink for a 10 year old barleywine. Wow, best barleywine I've had to date. Damn!"
"Mouthfeel was pretty smooth, but a little thin. I'm not sure the three years this barleywine has had to age was did much to mellow out the bitterness, based on some other reviews I've read. This isn't the best barleywine I've had, but it was worth the try."
"This is very strong, very intense, but not so much as the Heavey Weight Salt. Somewhat enjoyable but not something to hit hard at all."
"I suggest saving one or two bottles of Old Crustacean, drink the others while they're young."
"Drinkability  Better than average for the barleywine style, but not overly compelling. Like so many barleywines, I bet it will be superb in several years. It tastes like it has a lot of potential."
"This beer is very warming, not to mention delicious. Very easy to drink for a 11+ beer. I'm convinced Rogue could bottle sour milk and it would still somehow taste great. I'm also convinced I could drink this outside in 30 degree weather and stay warm. I will likely be buying a ceramic bottle of this next time I'm in North Carolina. A+"
"Taste is solid. Not at first - at first, the astringent hops attack (despite the age on this), but quickly settles to a wonderful, lasting aftertaste that includes figs, chocolate-covered cherries, and dark roasted coffee. The mix with the piney and grapefruity hop-flavor results in an intriguing balance. Finally, a nice alcholic warmth washes over. A great winter beer for those bitter cold nights (not that we have too many here Florida)."
"The drinkability is good, despite the high abv, typical for the style."
"If this beer doesn't kick you in the sack, nothing ever will and you need a palate transplant. Intense. And now I need a fresh bottle to blow my doors off again. This thing could age forever, surely.."
"I've heard about this beer being ""extreme"" and all that hype. I love Rogue, and although I'm far from agreeing with the whole bigger is better trend in beer, I'm down with a beer that pushes the boundaries, however that may be. Let's see how this one stacks up. Ok it looks pretty killer. Nice dark red color, super murky. Smells like a bomb went off in a room filled with chocolate covered cherries that had started to rot. Taste is super flavorful. All over the place. There's a big chocolate presence that I haven't noticed in a lof of barleywines. Explosive, fruity, fig newton taste. Also, rusty, bitter, dirty hops. Super bitter hops and super sweet fruity malts... I guess that's balanced?? A bit thick and syrupy on the palate. A little more carbonation would ties everything together a bit better. That being my only complaint, this is a really great beer. An interesting take on a broad style. Just make sure you ate some nails for breakfast in order to prepare for this brew."
"This beer proves once again my love for Rogue beers. I was thinking about buying a few and cellaring... but then... how crazily alcoholic would this be in a few years... yikes. ... oh, hell, why not!"
"Bottle (courtesy of Okbeer): Poured a cloudy orange/reddish color ale with a medium head with pretty good retention. Aroma of sweet malt and floral/bitter hops mix. Taste is a mix of sweet malt and an incredible amount of bitter hops. In fact, there is just too much hops in this to make it truly enjoyable for me. Body is full and alcohol is also present and provides an enjoyable warming feeling. But in the end, I guess this is just too one-dimensional."
"damn tasty for me, I dont remember it being this hoppy but I aint complaining. I'll be getting more of this and shoving it in the cellar for damn sure..."
"Very strong beer, at a little cooler than room temperature it becomes somewhat cumbersome to drink. I guess the ABV is justified in this case. Crazily complex, a great beer."
"This will only be drinkable to those who LOVE big hop bitterness, even after three years (2 years in my cellar). I will save my other bottle for another 5 before trying this again."
"10/16 Note: Just looked at bottle again and it read ""Bottled in 2003"""
"Save your money for Old Foghorn."
"It came in a large, ceramic type bottle with the pop top. The color was a deep reddish-brown, with a slight head. Smell, whoa, smells like lawn clippings. With a hint of alcohol. It tasted pretty much the way it smelled. Like lawn clippings. Very bitter, lawn clippings. Didn't really think much of the mouth feel as I was too busy wondering if someone emptied a lawn mower, added some faint hops and manure, then put it in my bottle. Overall, not a great ale. Actually, it was horrible. I poured the rest of the bottle out eventually. Definitely not something I'll ever drink again, if I have a choice."
"All in all, a classic barleywine that pulls no punches. Chuck Bednarik would approve. This is smash-mouth barleywine that still sticks around to remind other, more modern barleywines where they came from. Even John at Rogue admits that this is a tough drinker. A good history lesson, but there's much better in the way of barleywines out there."
"I've had this before, and for some reason forgot the mind blowing force of this beer, the first sip I took leveled me. However, this is an incredible beverage and another great production from Rogue, I loved it, but 12 oz. is a whole lot for one sitting."
"-UF"
"12 oz bottle bottled in 2004. Poured into a snifter, the beer is a gorgeous ruby red amber, very clear, with a slight tan head that quickly reduces to a small spotty cap. A small amount of lacing on the glass. Nose is a big sweet fruitiness--cherries and figs--with a caramel malt and some decently big piney hops. Taste is very hoppy, a huge dose of bitterness, definitely the first thing noticed. Coming back for a second sip, there is a strong malty dark fruit sweetness upfront, a slight bit of caramel, and then comes the mammoth wave of hops. Really a nice tasting barleywine--nice hop flavor, but the sweet malt keeps the bitterness from overwhelming. Never a hint of the 11% alcohol. Full bodied with a syrupy slightly coating feel. Most barley wines are a little on the sweet side for me, but this leans the other way, and I really like it. Could definitely drink a couple in a session, which is a dangerous thing."
"Fantastic brew, not at all what I was expecting. The ceramic bottle in came in was a nice bonus, looks fantastic. It's hard to come by where I'm at, but I've already ordered a case of six, at $50 a case, and feel it's a bargain."
"D: My advice is to sip and savor in small amounts."
"Still overpriced though :-( It was nice to try."
"The taste is initially sweet with hints of butterscotch, then the hops hit. This is the hoppiest beer Ive had to date the hoppy taste never leaves your mouth between each sip(I love it) It really tingles your whole mouth. A wild taste that I would like to cellar and see what happens with age."
"Excellent digestif."
"My advice..next time someone makes fun of you for drinking ""fancy beer", give them a bottle of this and see if they can finish it...this stuff will stop every BMC drinker in their tracks."
"Drink it slow, it's too bitter for anything else. Not a crisp bitterness like an IPA either. And for a Barleywine style, it just baffles me. Bad bottle? Maybe, but I'll be trying the less expensive non-XS in the future if I get around to it."
"Pours a nice mahogany with deep mocha head, settles to about an inch thick. Lacing furiosly coating the glass. The smell is of plums and caramels roasted over hot coals. HInt of roasted oak. The taste is deep and rich, leaves and oaky taste in the mouth. Roasted toffee and sugar, full bodied, a little to deep for my taste."
"from the bottle. bottled in 2001. poured a reddish brown with a light tan head. aroma, a sweet syrupy malt, alcoholand a nice hoppness, honey, caramel,dark fruits, and some brown sugar. flavor, wow the alcohol jumps right out there than a nice smooth blend of caramel, malts, hops, chocolate, plums, and raisins."
"Overall, I liked this beer quite a bit and am interested in buying it again. I only wish that I could get this a bit closer to me, as the closest place is almost two hours from here."
"A full-bodied brew that's a little too syrup leads to this beer's only strike in terms of drinkability. Yet I definitely sipped and enjoyed this one throughout..."
"Pours a brown color with a fluorescent tan head. The aroma is of caramel, crackers, and hops. The first sip is like a punch in the face. There is so much flavor my palate doesn't know what to do. It is very bitter at first, but that seems to mellow out as the glass warms. The aftertaste is quite pleasant and lively. The mouthfeel is thick with low carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer if you are in the mood for something big and bold."
"A much larger head than i noted in the first review. It is actually about 2/3"" with good retention, even with the extreme ABV. Strong sweetness in the nose, very fruity, with a high hop and alcohol presence, slightly citrus. Taste could easily kick your ass inside out. Lots of strong alcohol flavor, the hop equivalent to a rack of brontosaurus ribs and phenomanally large malt on top of that. This beer is all about a melding of extremes. I don't know if an all-around larger beer has ever been brewed. There is no doubt in my mind that this would definitely make Fred Flinstone's car tip over."
"Not for the timmid. Yep, I'm apparently timmid. Looks somewhere from brown to ruby red in color. Not quite clear, but pours a thick tan head and laced well. Smells like everything: malt, molassas, hops, grapes, prunes, raisons, chocolate, toffee, berries...the list goes on. Tastes like (see smells like...) with emphasis on the dark fruits; add dates, figs, almonds, and red wine. Very agressive with the flavoring and bittering hops: no punches pulled here. Strong body, thick and a bit oily. Quite chewy and almost nausiating (in a good way if there is such a thing.) Finishes anything but dry. Flavors fade slowly. I opened one three days ago and I'm still sipping on it. All in all, a good complex Barley Wine. Too abrupt now, but is certain to meld and mature with time. Buy now, but drink next year."
"a decent BW just not my style. should buy a cement jug of this and store it for a generation or 7."
"Amazing fucking beer. Pours a dark brown/red with a neat yellowish head and good lacing all around, slightly cloudy. Smell is sweet molasses, but the hop presence is lurking in the background ready to stab you in the mouth. Taste is all hops, floral citrusy you name it the hops are there, background is very malty, with a smooth chocolatey caramel finish. Very thick and chewy with perfect carb. Excellent. Thanks DrJay."
"Slightly hazy, deep auburn, nearly opaque, with ruby highlights topped by a thin, light brown head. Very malty aroma, quite sweet smelling, plenty of dark, ripe fruits, and some graininess. Hop aromas are present and provide some balance. The flavour is really big and is a masterful balancing act between the sweet caramel malt and assertive bitterness. Lots of ripe fruit and alcohol flavour, which provides a pleasant warming towards the end. It finishes off-dry with strong bitterness and caramel notes. Full bodied and moderately carbonated. This is a wonderfully complex beer. Now to find more...."
"Truly a standard for the style."
"This beer is dark brown with some red highlights. The head is tan but small. The head leaves tiny tight bubbles that lace the glass a bit. The smell is great, very sweet and fruity. Also a hint of wine and alcohol smell. The taste is very sweet but there is a lot of bitterness to balance it out. The aftertaste is very dry and bitter. The mouthfeel is good, a little on the thin side for an 11.3% barley wine, but enjoyable. The drinkability is OK. I couldn't sit down and have a bunch of these, but maybe someday I'll try."
"This is a very brash beer, and I like that. It took a period of a few months to savor 4 bottles, but Old Crusty is a damned fine brew."
"750 ml black ceramic capped bottle with bail top. I've had Old Crusty before but never thought of it as being this agressive. This bottle was young and purchased out of the first batch of ceramics released by Rogue. Time might do this beast some justice."
"What an excellent ale, everything is in the right place. I want to try an aged version to compare. I can undertand why some people say this beer is too much when young."
"Expiration date 2028."
"2002 vintage, poured from the 12 oz bottle into about a 5 ounce serving in a flute. Very thin head on top of a deep red, rusty metal looking body. Smells of alcohol, prunes, some citrus and hops. Taste is sweet, thick, chewy malt, more prune plays alongside that, you can feel the warmth of the alcohol and the hops come in full view after having sticking to the tongue. I couldn't give it a higher rating on drinkability, because it's very strong, and I could only drink a little bit at a time, this was one ferocious beer."
"Thick in the mouth, oily in the middle. A sipper for sure."
"Pours deep brown, with a thin film of foam. Thick and syrupy appearance. Aroma of caramel, liquor, dark fruits and malt. This is one smooth, full bodied and potent beer. I really appreciated the taste, but it's not something I'd consider one of my favourites. Complex flavours of ripe fruit, herbal flavours, hops, grapefruit, bitterness and alcohol. Finishes sweet and welcoming. It'll beat your tastebuds down over and over."
"Pours brownish- reddish- copperish color with thin persistent white head. Nice malty burnt roast on the nose with a sweetish citrus candy smell as well. The taste is pretty amazing- astoundingly hoppy, bitter and again those roast flavors. A little coarse, but warms the whole way down with the syrupy sweetness of it all. Fills the mouth and the flavor stays there for a very long time. Very easy to drink, but I can tell that this will get even better with time."
"Overall: Not my favorite barleywine, but the aging has made this one pretty nice to sip slowly, and it gets more inviting as it warms."
"This is not a beer that I would drink numbers of. I have a vertical six pack that covers the little bottles up to the latest version. I would have have to share these with a friend as the mind would go fairly quickly if I drank a full six pack of these."
"Pours out a mahogany color making this the darkest barley wine I've seen. Smell is sweet of malt, perhaps some hops. Taste is sweet, but backed by a hop kick that doesn't quickly fade. It kicks you in the ass all the way through! Very heavy mouthfeel; just what it should be. This is a good one and though I like the hop edge it could be cellar aged very well."
"Pours an opaque chalky brown color with a small tan head. Vinous malt and just a touch of hops are present in the nose. The complex malt flavors come across at first like one of those great British old ales [Gale's Prize Old Ale]. Toasty, with a subtle smokey character and a huge hoppy end. Clean finish, just right for the style. Deceptively great condition. This is one of those rare surprises where an ale looks very off at first but turns out to be grand. Whew!"
"ULTIMATELY: A quality barley wine. But frankly, the ability to pick the same amount of Double Bastard for more than $8 less, makes this particular barley wine EXTREMELY overpriced in my book. If you can find this cheaper, you may want to pick it up. Or, simply pick it up for the purpose of trying it. (Just so you can say you did.) It's good, just overpriced."
"Drinkability and Overall: Not a bad barleywine, but not the best. Another year or so and it'd be perfect. The alcohol is too outta control for me. It was pretty tasty though, and I can't say I didn't enjoy iy."
"Drinkability: Good considering it is a barleywine, an 11.3 abv at that. I may not be able to drink two in a row, but I'd definitely return to this brew. Perfect for a rainy day or cold night. Beers like this really open your eyes to the vast range of styles out there for our enjoyment. Brilliant."
"Wow what a barley wine. Granted this was a 2004 vintage it will have quite awhile to age gracefully. First thing to hit you is the huge hop presence and intense bitterness. Malt balances it back out in a moment leaving you with a long fairly smooth finish for the IBUs. Cant wait to try some more in a few years."
"Pours a deep garnet colour with not much head really just a rim off off white collar that sticks for a bit.. other than that you get a whisp swirling around. The aroma is of Sweet alcohol and dark fruits. Its a 2003 bottle so the hops are not so much in the face, but they are there. Taste is English Barleywine at first but even after 2 years the hops come back for a battle royal and dry this mother out.. Tasty rum spice cake with a hop back. Mouthfeel is good, as with a lot of High ABV its not the most carbonated beverage, but it goes down silky smooth. Drikability is great for a Barleywine of this magnitude.. However this was a 12oz 2 year old.. I would love to have more, but not sure that i would need 750ml of this for 13bucks in a black ceramic crock.. It is a good good good American barley wine however."
"Pours a garnet with a light tan head which diminishes rather quickly - to be expected at that abv. Nose detectable at range. An explosion of malt with some hints of raisin and alcohol. I also get hints of cinnamon and brown sugar. A lot of malt at the outset upon tasting, developing to a plum/raisin taste and other dark fruits, thence to an alcohol warmth and finally to a surprisingly hoppy finish for a barleywine. Quite an interesting American barleywine. Very nice mouthfeel. A decidedly drinkable beer despite the abv. Quite marvellous."
"This may seem unrelated, but the first time I cracked a bottle of old crustacean, I somehow created a lake in my kitchen by overflowing my sink. It was my first beer of the day, which I sipped while brewing a porter on my back patio. There is something about this beer."
"Thanks to orbitalr0x for sharing this with me. IT poured a dirty brown color with a ring of head that sits nicely atop the beer. The nose is a deep sweet caramel wtih a bit of hop. Maybe a touch of raiseny sweetness. The flavor is big hop. Peppery, spicey, slightly woody. A bit of alcohol comes through but the big bitter on the finish is a bit over the top for me, and I like hops. I don't find balance in this. The feel is thick and syrupy, pretty good. Overall, I was less than impressed. I would call this a mediocre barleywine. What I do have to respect is that it rings in at 11.3% and that is very well hidden. That definately scores points."
"Slàinte!"
"2004 vintage. I should get another and cellar it."
"Now would I want this beer again? Hmmm... Honestly, Yes I would and I see it sparingly enough that I would buy it again if I do see it, but if it was in my basket and i needed to make a cut for the sake of price it would most likely be on the chopping block."
"overall i think the drinkability would be better if i would have waited from opening up this one. But overall i think it is a great beer to enjoy one at a time."
"Dark, fuzzy crimson. Tan froth cloaks the glass. Yeah, dried fruits soaked in molasses simple syrup, and doused with grand marnier then burnt. Sprinkle with amaretto, garnish with a mint sprig and greek oregano essential oil. Serve with a shot of >raisin liquer?< Too bad it's numbing."
"2004 vintage. 12 ounce XS bottle. Old Crustacean is a dark reddish-brown with a minimal head. Aroma is strongly and solely of west coast hops. Holy hell this is a hoppy beer, even compared to Stone Ruination. Is this a barleywine or a DIPA? Luckily the hops mellow out just enough as the beer warms up to make the big malt flavors noticable. Still hops dominate big time, especially in the finish. The 120 IBUs are definently noticed here. Drinkability is a little low, the high ABV and the super hoppiness make this tough to have more than one or two. I'm definently going to save my second bottle and try it in a year or two."
"this stuff is real good. damn"
" Palate is...wow, this is tough. Initially, my take was that this is a very caustic and unpleasant beer. After a few sips, though, and getting past the huge whallop of alcohol, I can comment better. Begins rather sweet, with a roasted malt profile with notes of figs and raisins. Huge, floral hops come out mid-palate, becoming bitter towards the back of the mouth. The body is substantial - syrupy, sticky, and everything you'd expect from a huge beer from Rogue. Unfortunately, halfway through the bottle I feel like I can't take any more. Don't worry, I'll finish it, but I can't give it high marks on drinkability. Otherwise, it's wonderful."
"Damn, this is the first time in two years that I've had Old Crusty when fresh, and I shan't say I'll do it again soon. When fresh, this is just too rough. Let this sleep a few years at least."
"Thanks to Mark at 3 Corners for this sample."
"EDIT: I can feel it warming my ears."
"Poured a dark caramel color when poured out of the glass to a ever so small head that quickly dissipated. I am left with a thin ring of lacing around the beer. The beer starts off with a sweet malty flavor followed by a huge hit of hops bitters. I was not ready for this bitterness explosion in my mouth and it is still lingering around. Man, this is one bitter barleywine. But, I got back to the name of this beer and study it ""Old Crustacean"". Crustaceans have hard crusts or shells like the old and bitter guy on the bottle. Seems to make sense to me now. I find this to be a unique barleywine and cannot wait to try it in a year after mellowing out the rough edges. Thanks again Rogue!"
"Excellent brew from Rogue."
"The aroma is very powerful, I could smell it as I poured into a glass. Strong fruity smells, a mix of squished berries. The taste reminds me of black currants overwhelming the malt. Tangy mouthfeel but the alcohol is nicely disguised. Not really to my liking. I prefered the last barleywine I tried but neither are my preferred style."
"But who said wild was a bad thing?"
"Overall, this beer exceeded my expectations. Im setting one aside to see how it develops next year, but this relatively fresh one is more then suiting. I was actually a bit scared to pop the top on this one, but Im certainly glad I did. Ill be visiting this one again."
"All in all a very nice Barley Wine"
"Also as a side note, this beer went excellent with the Madrid Chicken at the Sanctuary, but it was quite filling. I'll have to enjoy the second half of my sandwich with some of the Stone Brew I recieved yesterday in the mail."
"This poured a medium brown color with ruby highlights. A thick tan head formed on the top of the beer, and retained well. Wonderful barleywine fruity aroma. This really comes across as a fruit forward hop smell tempered by sweet toffee malt. Some hint of the alcohol comes across in the nose too. Tangy grapefruit up front followed quickly by toffee/caramel malt, and some hints of alcohol. medium complexity from the beer. I've never had this rich a mouth feel in a barleywine. Very impressive. For this style, very drinkable."
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a decent head that leaves a nice lace. Aromas are mainly of big earthy, piney, resinous hops with carmelized sugars and caramel notes. There is also a bit of fusel alcohol in the nose. There is an initial sweetness to this brew that brings about a nice tone of plums and raisins to the foreground. Thereis also a carmelized sugary feel along with what I percieve to be some molasses notes. Throughout this brew there is also a heavy dosage of bitter-ass piney and resiny hops that really balance out the sweetness up front, while also giving off some grapefruit rind and other citrus like notes to this brew. The body of this brew is super dense, but at the same time has almost an airy, creamy feeling to it which I can only describe as magnificient. No barleywine that I have ever tasted has such as mouthfeel as this one. Overall the hops dominate in this brew but there are some nice sweet malty tones as well, which makes this one fine ass barleywine."
"The alcohol is very hidden, which allows this 11% plus to sneak up on you, but to say I would have more than 2 of these in an evening would be false. Not my favorite (on my very short list), but I am really glad I picked this one up."
"I should have tried it sooner. Very Passable this, Very passable."
"I will revisit this version in a few years, and see if I'm right or wrong about that rawness..."
"Presentation comes forth as an opaque reddish-brown. The head crackles away rather quickly. The smell is of a smooth caramel with light alcohol. Lacing is sparse, head retention is vapid. The malt takes the forefront early and the hops zing the backend strongly and remain for a pleasant aftertaste that is accompanied by a very slight alcohol. Theres a beautiful smooth to bitter transition for mouthfeel. Drinkability is tremendous..so smooth, adventurous. An alcohol warmth comes to the chest not as immediately other high quality barley wines but, no worries, it certainly presents itself in time. I'm appreciating Chinook hops more and more. Rogue has a very strong line of products and Old Crustacean certainly hits a stand-up triple here."
"The Crustacean is thick and rather opaque, with very little light coming through to reveal a light ruby color. the head is a decent finger's worth, which disappears somewhat quickly. Now the smell of this beer put me off at first, until I had a little while to dig around in it, so to speak. The first aroma that I got was an overriding smell of foot. It sounds weird, but that is the closest thing i can think to describe it. Just foot. After i got used to that smell i found some burnt somethings with a bit of hop and malt in there too with some peppery fruits. The taste is overridingly alcoholic at first, with an incredible amount of chalky bitterness after that. After the taste mellows on your tongue for a litt,e you get hints of malts and fruity hops too. I have to say the most pleasant part of this beer is the aftertaste, which is not just in comparison to the rest of this beer, it actually is a very good aftertaste. I cant give this beer any high marks for drinkability, because i wish the rest of it had been as good as the aftertaste that it left."
"A treat to taste, I will seek this brew out again... must have one for the cellar."
"Mouthfeel"
"Pours a sinister dark red with barely any head, very thick and dark. Very strong aroma of chocolate malt, and maybe a hint of alcohol, hardly noticeable though. Taste was a highly hopped, pleasantly warming brew with a satisfying bitter finish. The hops provide a smooth yet crisp mouthfeel. Overall I would drink this until I fell into a wonderful coma..."
"Full of roasty flavors, has it's place in the spectrum. A worthwhile venture, and is very satifying."
"Pours a syrupy and slightly cloudy amber brown with very little head but plenty of clingy lace. Smells strongly of grainy alcohol and citrus hops over caramel malts. Nice citrus hop flavors with powerful alcohol and balancing caramel malt undertones. Citrus hops are strong and complex, but not overwhelming. Mouth-feel is syrupy and very lightly carbonated. Not bad considering the ABV, but I'd be concerned about cellaring this one too long in case it became flat quickly. The tasty hops keep the drink interesting through the finish, but I'd have a tough time drinking more than one given the strength and mouth-feel."
"Mouthfeel is nice, fairly thick and creamy. Good body, maybe a bit too much carbonation. Drinkability....well...I'm gonna finish this one but I'm not looking for another. This brew needs to age big time. I have a 2002 in the cellar that I look forward to trying. Worth a try just for the experience."
"Finishes (how else?) with intense, oily, tongue-numbing hops. My stomach is definately warming up with this one. Overall, a great West-coast barley. A little unbalanced w/ all the hops, I like em' just a bit sweeter. I shoulda' kept it in the cellar another 2 years."
"Big bold dark fruit flavours along with a ton of sweetness to start. Massive hop flavours take over loaded with citrus & pine sap. Plenty of bitterness takes it into a dry finish. Medium-full bodied, relaxed carbonation. A real powerhouse."
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a full tawny head. Consistency is syrup-like: obviously a high gravity beer. If you look real hard you can see some bubbles rolling up from the bottom of the glass. Intense stuff. Aroma has some strange familiarity; like Sweet Tarts and some hop notes. Not incredibly complex, but again, intense. Flavor has a sweet start with a slightly biting middle and a numbing hop finish. Intense. It is hard to find any nuance or subtly. Palate is full bodied and syrupy with world-class hop finish. A good representation of the style, but I have had other barleywines with a better balance. However, considering the IBUs of this beer, Rogue has created an extreme balance."
"At first, I didn't think I cared for this one, but if you give it a little time it will grow on you. I'd definitely be interested in seeing what a little aging will do."
"This was a keg of 1994 Old Crusty served at Redbones, which I enjoyed yesterday. Normally, I would stay far, far away from this beer (too much alcohol), but let me tell you, this 10 year old brew was very comfy and mellow. No sharp edges, not even the alcohol notes (they were present) got in the way of my enjoyment of this brew. My 10.5 pour was raspberry in color, with a thin white head that left as soon as I looked away. Aroma was of dark stone fruit (think plums), also some woody notes. Medium - in body, very smooth. Taste was a blend of malt, alcohol, plums again, some nuttiness, and even some licorice thrown in for good measure. Yes, there was some hot spots, but they didn't burn for too long. Enjoy it for what it is. Hops...it has forgotten them now."
"5.5 years later, Aged somewhat.big off-white head on medium brown. Some medicinal and peppermint aromas. Some licorice in taste."
"Drinkability - this one's a little abrasive even after 5 years. Some good spots, but unless the newer bottle has something more, not one I'd revisit."
"Overall an excellent brew."
"Very dark cloudy amber...very little head...some lacing. Smell is a very deep floral hop...very inviting. Taste is bitter with floral hop elements..alcohol presence is there with a fruity undertone...great for hopheads. Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy and chewy, but it fits the character of the brew. Drinkaibility for the high abv is fine...a definite sipper."
"I've had other vintages on tap, and this was close to the best (which was a 1996 on-tap). Possibly the controlled environment of cellaring served it best. In the future I will age it longer as the Crusty could use another year beyond two to tame the bitterness and even more complexity. Definitely gonna buy more."
"2002 bottle. Poured out with just a teensy bit of honeyed cream colored head that sat atop the cloudy rootbeer/amber colored brew. So nice and piney scented with hops floating out at you. Grapefruity and woodsy with sweetness in the background... nice sweet malty scents. Wow, surprising first sip! So dark and pine filled, tons of hoppiness in there! Darkness, burnt toast, peppery and warming alcohol. Not much carbination going on, which I like, just such a good mouthfeel to it. There may be too much going on flavorwise to make this a session, but damn nice to sit back for a few, just to sit and enjoy and taste, and smell.... Man, can Rogue do anything wrong?"
"This beer was very well balanced in my opinion, and went down incredibly smooth. In fact, besides the batch 6000, this has been my favorite barleywine that I have tried to date. Now, if only I could get my hands on some older bottles of this wonderful beer."
"Drinkability: I wouldnt recommend that anyone ever have more than one of these in a sitting. Dangerously alcoholic but also dangerously alluring, I kept sipping trying to taste new complexities and pinpoint old ones; I kept admiring the outlandish flavors and sanity defying nuances. If the threat of a serious hangover is the only thing keeping me from drinking many more of these, Id say its pretty darn drinkable. This barley wine is an excellent example of the style and one that ages magnificently."
"2002 vintage: cloudy and intimidating color of fire glazed mud bricks. cream soda colored head bubbles forth from the viscous liquid and subsequently retreats into the murkiness. dark caribbean rum soaked fruitcake aroma with an underlying nostril-searing pine resin hopiness. minimal carbonation...maybe from sitting in my cloeset for 2 1/2 years? ultra full bodied, smooth and deliciously creamy. heapings of caramel malt flavor with notes of green apples and over-ripened plums. hops come in at the end with an uppercut of viscous pine resin bitterness and flavor. the bitterness shows up late and can be rather shocking. alcoholic heat in the belly. still plenty of hop muscle, even after sitting for a few years. goes down well enough though the sheer size and booziness of this brew limits this mere mortal to one in a sitting. totally over the top but executed well. rogue crafts stellar big brews. they ain't classics for nothing."
"Delightfully (or dangerously?) drinkable for the alcohol content. The only American barleywine I've had that I prefer to this is Dominion's Millennium. This is a hophead's barleywine."
"Taste at your own risk. I'm determined to choke down the last 1/2 of this pint."
"Pours a dark brown with redish hints small brown head. Aroma is sweet caramel malts with fruit hints in nose grapefruit hints expecting more hop aromas but not bad smelling. Taste is thick chewy caramel malt really sweet then the bitter hops kick in and coat your tounge with oily hops. This beer has alot of hops atleast in the alpha acid dept but not much in way of aroma or flavor or its overpowered by the bitterness. I was wanting to like this beer but couldn't talk myself into thought about rating taste average but this beer is anything but average its just not for me. Mouthfeel is big and full a beer that means business. Drinkability for me average I guess, would have it again if offered but wouldn't look for it."
"This is just craft beer gone wrong, IMHO."
"I'll need to rereview a newer bottle."
"Drinkability: as far as barley wine goes this is great example. the big IBUs and alcohol kick may offend some and make the drinkability questionable. this one is a definte late nite sipper or even better if shared between 2."
"WOW! I am not a huge fan of Barley Wines, I do like Stone Old Guardian on occasion, but during a recent trip to Vegas, I dropped into my favorite watering hole there, The Freakin Frog. I found, quite by accident, they had tapped a keg of 1996 Vintage Old Crustacean, a week or so prior and there was still some left. I decided to give it a shot, and boy what an unbelievable beer this is!! No head to speak of, but a beautiful dark amber color, no carbonation to speak of either. Strong malty backbone, very strong on carmel, but before it got ""sweet", the hops took over and finished smooth as velvet with a warm alcohol bite. I would love to have some of this for winter, it is truly a belly warmer. I immediately ceased any thoughts of drinking anything other than this for the remainder of the evening, which was not too awful long, considering the high ABV of 11% + who knows what has happened over the last 8 years. I will go buy some of the current release at my local liquor store; however, I am afraid I may be disappointed in a newer offering. Get to the Frog in Vegas and get some quick!!!"
"This is one robust and complex barleywine. Very rich in malt flavor with a serious mouthfeell. Syrupy with a bitter finish. A warming and intense brew. One of the best of this style that I have sampled. Recommended."
"Old Crustacean was served from a silkscreened 12 oz bottle dated 2002 (aged 2 years). In a pint glass, the beer was a rich and very deep and attractive mahogany brown, and was topped by a thin light brown head. The nose was extremely complex and wonderful with exploding textured roasty, mushroomy, spouted-grain, woody maltiness. Irratic plumes of varnish-like alchohl caught my nose from time to time. Sweet notes are present but stuggle to escape. On the palate, a big roasty, peaty malt profile with some nice cocoa nuances reared back to release searing scotch-like alcohol flavors that warmed the throat on the way down. A huge complementing bitterness came through this in the finish leaving lingering roasty, lightly astringent nutty notes. The medium body felt good for the flavors and character of the beer. As for drinkability, it suffers considerably due to the completely detached alcohol thoughout....I sipped it like as if it were scotch, and I barely got through the bottle. Despite this harshness, the nose was amazingly developed and good flavors made it enjoyable for a while. This aged barleywine was quite intense."
"Thank you Rajendra82!"
"Pours a somewhat translucent hazel brown color. Off-white head forms and fades before waving ""hello"". Smell is an elegant mixture of sticky caramel malt, fragrant alcohol, and grapefruity citrusy hops. Taste is quick and to the point. Hop bitterness followed by a cleansing alcohol bath, a touch of malt, and palate stripping fruity hops leaving the mouth wanting more. It's not completely unbalanced, but it wants you to think that it is. The dry mouthfeel coupled with the mouth-watering hop bitterness attempts to balance it all out, but falls just a bit short. I think more residual sweetness would make this a killer barleywine. Very drinkable, but the flavor is in that grey area between American double IPA and barleywine. Expecting one or the other may skew your results."
"Blood red, cloudy pour with a head that was a couple of inches thick. The aroma was sweet hazelnuts, flowery hops, and a musty leathery funk. The taste is very powerful with a malty and hoppy punch to your face that makes you sit up and take notice. A very complex series of flavors is found here, as each sip starts off as an innocent mixture of sweet dark skinned fruits, and ends up as a roasty peppery tobacco juice that makes your head spin. Just an incredible beer that shows what we had been missing for nearly 70 years in Georgia."
"The taste was of strong musty malt, and reminded me almost of hopped whisky. Quite interesting. As it warmed, the alcohol became more prominent. This was definitely a sipping beer. But a good one and worth having again, especially with different vintages."
"leaves with a feeling of warmth not only in the belly but in the back of the mouth as well."
"This 12oz was bottled in 2002. Pours a deep reddish brown color with a tan head that leaves a little bit of nice looking lace around the glass as it is consumed. Aroma smell of sweet fruits, citrus hops with a bit of alcohol. The taste is very sharp at first with a big bitterness followed sweet malt flavors and alcohol. This was a bit rough on the first sip but got better as it was consumed. Mouthfeel is full and creamy and it goes down fairly easily considering the bitterness and alcohol tastes. Overall a great barley wine that could probably stand to age another year or so."
"This is a big beer, and the first sip announces that. Loads of alcohol and crazy hop levels lead me to dislike this at first, but some caramel sweet aspects peek in towards the end to bring it back more into my realm. That sweetness is replaced again by the hops for a slightly bitter finish, but overall this is an excellent Barley wine once you let it warm slightly."
"Thick mouhtfeel, but still highly drinkable. Wow, this brew really impressed me!"
"Not a super drinkable brew makes a good one to shock your taste buds."
"Notes: Not blown away, but a good drink."
"The mouthfeel is sharp and potent, like any other good barleywine. All things considered, it's pretty drinkable too."
"12 ounce bottle, brewed in 2002. Pours darkest amber, minimal carbonation and head, Tiny bubles, leaves some lacing. Not much nose detected. Mouthfel is smooth, rich and lucious. Vinious, strong alcohol presence. Lovely malt backbone. Hops more subtle, but grainyness is evident. Very strong BW, well crafted, this is a nice sipper, excellent night capper."
"The hops have definitely faded a little on this one. This is a real treat and I would try it again, just be ready for a big beer!"
"This beer has a dark purple/brown colored body, small khaki colored head on top. Big mnalt scent, chocolate and syrup. The taste has an intense malt character, with a bitter hop backbone. Chewy mouthfeel, sticks to the throat as well. The alcohol becomes evident as the beer warms. This beer is not for pussies, and will leave you feeling old and crusty when youre done."
"dark brown with a light red hue, hazy with a tan head. fresh piney hop aroma, with citrus and fruity brown sugar. quite hoppy with mostly oily piney hops. brown sugar, berries and oranges. toffee flavors emerge as the beer warms, creating a very pleasant complexity. really nice just shy of full bodied beer with a perfect amount of light carbonation. the alcohol is definitely present, but not overwhelming, but when coupled with an intensely bitter hop aftertaste, the drinkability of this great tasting beer takes a slight hit from what it maybe should be. this is one of the few instances in which i will say that i wish there were a little less hops; not in the taste but the aftertaste. with age to mellow the hops a bit, i think this has potential for greatness. i'll be picking up a few more bottles to find out."
"Flavor starts sweet with molasses and brown sugar. Rising godzilla like from these deep swampy mucks of flavor is the warming fire tandem of bitter piney hops which sweep the tongue of most of the malt. What is left is quickly removed by the warming alcohol that leaves a mulled ale feeling in your throat."
"Still a powerful brew, even in it's old age. I was very fortunate to catch this on tap, which the folks at Rogue brought so graciously for their tasting at my local. The fresh version is inspired, but this is sublime. Like a talented young artist with a brilliant career, creating his finest masterpiece in the autumn of life. Quite a brew with enough age on it, worth hanging onto a couple bottles for this kind of experience."
"I'm stocking up on the current release, to set aside for maturation. Also, going back to the store that had 2002 on the shelf and buying whatever remains."
"Deep Caramel Brown color, practically no head. Aroma of a freshly baked cinnamon rolls and raisins. Bittersweet warmth, full flavored, minimal carbonation. Not sure how long is the ideal aging for this beer should be, but I can't imagining it getting much better. A very tasty barleywine, and not too pricy either. 2001 bottling sampled 07th of April, 2004."
"Damn! That was my last bottle."
"Taste is an alcohol burn up front. Spicy and swet caramel. Richly malty sweetness. A very strong hop bite. Big hops for big malt. Very well balanced. The hops dominate the finish and the aftertaste. Chewy malt, like molasses. Really smooth and drinkable, even though this is probably a bit young for peak flavors. I am going to lay some of these down."
"Opening this, it appeared to be a dark-amber in color, which did not give much head, but did form some edge""line"" around the goblet. I served it at room temperature which I do for most of my beers I taste. This barleywine is very floral in aroma, with a hint of sugar or caramel mixed in there somewhere. Upon tasting this, it gave first a sweet taste (caramel), and some hints of fruit come through, particularly raisins, but soon became more of a sour hoppy taste overall, in which the alcohol came through very apparently more at the end. 11.3%???? Yeah right! I am betting the ABV is more around 14-15% at this point (bottled in 2002). This beer has a great texture; creamy, smooth, but has some kick at the ass-end due to the alcohol. The carbonation is stingy at the front on my tongue and maintains itself throughout. I really enjoy this fine Rogue beverage....yet again why they are as good as they are!"
" This Crusty reminds me of a strong Belgian dark ale, minus the spices and yeast character. Overall, a nice introduction to the barleywine style."
"Old Crustacean is very drinkable. I refuse to consider drinkability by how many I will drink in a session. No Barleywine will ever be a session beer. My basis in drinkability is ""will I come back to this again and again"". Yes!"
"This is, hands down, the hoppiest barleywine I've had, and one of the most enjoyable."
"On tap at Henry Street Ale House, Brooklyn. Deep reddish-brown, good tan head with some lacing. Aroma was alcoholic with some hops detected, not too strong; a bit sherry-like. Taste was big and warming, there was a marked bitterness from the hops which increased steadily as the balancing maltiness was overpowered and faded out. Alcohol could be tasted too, giving a nice warming sensation (good timing as there was a blizzard raging outside). A slight hint of burnt malt came through too towards the end. The finish was bitter with a good, long aftertaste."
"2002 Version: The hops are still running wild, but the spiciness has mellowed, while still leaving plenty of bitterness. It is also more sweet with definite caramel notes. I don't notice the ""tobacco"" flavor so many have mentioned. Absolutely delicious!"
"Drinkability - only if you plan on going nowhere. I find it hard to imagine getting this on tap anywhere unless they strictly limit the number of pints someone can have of this. While I've downed imperial stouts at 10%abv without a second thought, this is simply too much for me. Is it a bad beer? No - otherwise, my scoring would have been brutal. It's just not my cup of tea"
"I had it with dinner, but I think it would have been better alone. It demands your attention."
"2 yr old bottle Dark bronze hue with a small tan head. Aroma is hugely hoppy, piney with slight lactic notes of yogurt and a good chocolatey and caramelic malt presence. Taste is very hoppy, aggresively predominent bitterness that hides everything else: grapefruit and resin in abundance. Medium-bodied. Huge sipper that is worth a try, but definitely not my bag."
"2002 vintage. I have to admit, this is my first barley wine and I was a little intimidated by this beer. I expected to not like it (is my palate ready for this?) Boy, was I wrong. I was intrigued by the murky brown color, no head to speak of. The aroma was strong and hoppy. The flavor, well what can I say, it's very powerful alternatingly sweet and bitter, earthy and airy, hoppy and malty. Huge flavors that play off of each other and yet balance delicately and wonderfully. This beer is very drinkable, while you may not want to pound these all night the complex flavor has you looking forward to the next sip. A wonderful experience."
"Bottled in 2002, this brew poured a dark root beer color. Opaque murky in the glass. Quite a bit of sediment in the bottle and a very small off-white, tannish head. BIG malt aroma with hints of caramel and wet forest. The mouthfeel is thick and slightly tingly, with a smooth syrupy coating. Wonderful taste with a muted sweetness and suggestions of sarsaparilla and coffee -- somewhat disappointingly ending in a rather bitter aftertaste, but not so much as to reverse the enjoyment. Pretty drinkable for the style, but you probably wouldn't be pounding these back."
"Picked up one of these at the store and saw that it was vintage 2002. Oh, someone has aged this!! Should be interesting. Turnsout this is a fine barleywine. Pours very dark brown with a small head. The lace stays. Nose is hoppy and carmelly. Taste is strong but balanced. Lots of hops, malt, caramel. Very good mouthfeel. I don't think this happened overnight. I am glad this was aged. This is a very tasty beer. A great sipper."
"Pours a dark, brownish-amber with a wispy tan head. Minimal carbonation and disappearing head are expected because of the alcohol. The aroma is a mix of alcohol and spicy, piney hops. The intense malt aromas that I expect in a barley-wine are certainly present, but theyre pushed aside by the hops. The foretaste is notably malty and quite sweet, but the sensation is quickly overrun by the intense hoppiness. Alcohol warming hits after the first few sips and the alcohol taste is evident in throughout the beer. The finish is all hopsany other subtlety is simply overpowered by the spicy bitterness. This is a west coast barleywine taken to extremes (and worth having for that very reason). Id love to try one after it aged for half a dozen years."
"What can I say about this one? A true hophead's barleywine. Fantastic. Find this one whenever you can."
"This beer is a rather murky reddish amber color with a thin light tan head. Very little lacing to be found. The aroma is potent alcohol along with some malt and caramel. The body is on the chewy side, and the flavor is rather harsh ethyl alcohol at first, but it mellows a bit as it warms. The earthy tones and malt and caramel flavors are more prevalent later on. The finish is very spicy and hoppy throughout. Overall this beer has would be a better experience if it was not so unbalanced from the get-go. It just takes a little too long to reach its potential."
"Brown body with red-orange highlights. A creamy half-finger biege head, clinging hard to the sides as it morphs into a table-topper. Nose fills with caramel, hard candy, licorice, ripened fruit,and alcohol. Thick sweet malt bathes the tongue, and leaves a large dollop of warming alcohol. There's a wave hello of hops in the middle, but fleeting, a sudden rise and quick goodbye. The hops may have passed on from age, but they did not mellow the beer as much as I would like: too sweet and too ""strong"" (the sense of the alcohol, as opposed to what the actual ABV is). If the beer was younger the sweetness might have more balance, but I fear what the alcohol prescence would be like. For barleywines, I'd prefer Old Salty, Bigfoot, or Blithering Idiot. Rogue makes a host of beers I love. This is not one of them."
"Drinkability is somewhat disappointing and not all that high for me. I found the prevalent burning alcohol feel to be to distracting."
"I imagine if I tried an aged bottle, I would rate the drinkability a lot higher, but as far as the 2003 goes, I'm sippin' slow."
"Dark ruby body with a rather large, sticky tan head. Very nice. Smells of rich, sweet toffee malts, backed, almost overwhelmingly by scotch tape-resiny-taiga hops. Taste starts off with rich, chewy sweet malts, butter toffee and some fruitiness. The mouthfeel is big, and chewy. This is all followed by gigantic hops. Very strong (similar to Bigfoot), and maybe a little bit too much. Aging might help mellow this sucker out."
"A fine barleywine offering from Rogue. Definitely not lacking in hops at 120 IBUs. Quite good, and absolutely one I'd have again next barleywine season."
"Overall, this is a memorable beer. Not because it has great qualities, but because the qualities it does have are very intense."
"2002 Vintage. Ruby/amber body with little traces of carbonation. Sweet, fruity, malty nose, with a good dosage of alcohol in there as well. Despite this having some age under its belt, it hasn't mellowed much. Actually I think it's kind of out of balance. Still tastes pretty good, but its dominated by a toasted malt character and the alcohol seems to take over too much in the finish. The hops are there, but not enough of them to keep things in balance. This is still a decent barleywine, but there are so many better American interpretations of the style."
"From a 7 oz. bottle dated 1998. An unimpressive pour; totally flat with big globby chunks of sediment floating around. A vigorous swirl releases a few bubbles but there's no marbling, no collar... color is of ""raisin juice," if there is such a thing--semi-opaque burnt umber color with cinnamon-colored highlights but very murky; vinous cling. I know this is (1) old and (2) a barleywine, but this is just not a good-looking beer. Smells better than it looks, anyway: dark chocolate and toffee superseded by dried fig/raisin; a touch of dessicant nutmeg or mace in the finish. Intriguing nosefeel of grape leaves is smooth but lacking in complexity. Taste begins with massive dried fig with a sudden surge of bitterness. More complex at the back of the palate with sweet dark chocolate and a suprising taste of coconut milk; through this there is a sustained, intense bitterness: extreme grapefruit rind with a touch of apricot (?). Initially harmonious flavors each have their turn, until the appealing bitterness crosses over into a powerful, unappealing acidity. Flat mouthfeel is more waxy than syrupy with a slight alcohol burn again turning acidic. The brew is, however, immediately soothing and warming. Well... I think time has helped the flavors distribute... but this sample was less than satisfying. I've had other '98's that have fared better. With one still in the fridge I'll see if the marks go up. Maybe this sample was a bit ""off..."" or maybe I just don't think this barleywine belongs at the top of the heap."
" An exceptional beer when aged for 3-5 years when the bittering blends more comfortably into the beer. This beer was made to age. Fresh bottles are a bit rough. One of the origional ""Extreme Beers"" that doesnt get enough credit."
"Bottled in 2002, here's a dark reddish amber colored beer with an ample head and a strong malty aroma, as well as hoppy aromma. I sense a touch of dark fruits in this aroma. It's very smooth on the palate, creamy, a bit syrupy. Malts dominate with force at first. It's dark fruits, a bit of chocolate too...and then from nowhere, in comes a wallop of hops and alcohol to finish this monster off. Quite a pleasure to sip this one...very warming in the tummy, perfect for this winter, it being ZERO degrees outside right now and all."
"Mouthfeel is medium syrupy, you can feel the body, but it's not over the top remarkable, similar in the drinkability, this is a decently drinkable barley wine, but it does pack a wallop, so for most this is a sipper."
"The sweetness and bitterness in this beer strive almost tangibly to balance, but they just miss being in synch. It's not unpleasurable, but it does fall short of excelling. The high ABV never hides and does its work capably. There's enough going on to be interesting, but it just doesn't manage to wow. While not destined to be a favorite, I would not be at all disappointed to be offered one. While there may not be anything to rave about, neither is there anything here not to like."
"Drinkability. While the low alcohol kick would entice me to have a few, the lack of a nice blend of flavor diminishes the drinkability. It is a good brew, but there are some better ones I would pick instead. I doubt I'll buy this again based on the price to taste ratio."
"Drinkability: This is a sipping brew, no question about it, but as I sit here sipping this lovely liquid and listening to old Winston Churchill speeches with some Maiden thrown in, life is good. Not a beer to drink to many of, this one should be appreciated. Very nice."
"Boy do I wish this was still available."
"Very intense but it awesome."
"This is the closest to an actual ruby color of any of the barleywines I've had so far.. It's a little light on the head. and has a bitter, hoppy finish, but the there's enough malt in the body to suggest that this better could handle aging for another year or so very well."
"This is high octane syrup. They used good malts and hops, but it's just too much. Super thick, super heavy. Would be better if it came in a 6 oz. bottle maybe? Burnt caramel, heavily hopped. Dark rust colored. It's a good warmer though. If you want barleywine, try Old Foghorn instead."
"Impressions of poorly made pancake batter with maple syrup and grapefruit on the side. No real separation between the two ""worlds"" -- malt and hops. Another west coast exercise in extremism, the flavor begins with a strong, caramel, sweet malt profile. And with little to no warning, it somehow seemlessly shifts gears to an oily hop bomb. Awkward but good -- in that tongue-numbing sort of way. I think one bottle is about my limit, especially in these newer 12 oz bottles. I'm definitely setting one of the 2002s aside for a few years to see what happens."
"Alright this is what good beer is all about. Big time flavor in this one. Pours a reddish copper color with a big creamy head. Smells syrupy sweet. But the taste shows so many flavors that I can't figure them all out. Sweet fruit flavors hit first. Those are followed by the traditional Rogue hops which seem more in place to me here than in the stouts. The hoppiness is very very bitter. This is one of the hoppiest, if not the hoppiest beer I have had. The malts are there but can't hold up to the hop bitterness. Finally a dry alcohol flavor comes forth and finishes off the beer for me. Very intense alcohol esters. Definitely an intense experience!"
"This is definately a style that will stand up well to my tatse in cigars and I think I'll have to pair the two next time I try a barleywine."
"This sat in my cellar for about 8 months or so, but as other reviews have said, it could have stayed for a lot longer. Still, it was pretty awesome!"
"It poured out of the bottle like dirty swamp water. There was little, if any, head at the top. The color reminded me of a dark apple cider. As far as smell goes, i really couldn't pick up on anything particular. The first sip tasted of chocolate and the aftertaste is quite dry. Suprisingly, the alcohal was not overpowering at all. I believe the key to this beer is drink it a little cooler than room temperature. I think it is a pretty good tasting beer, although nothing terribly special. Like I had mentioned, I am not an advocate for barleywine styled beer, but this one was comparable to the great tasting Bigfoot."
"The beer is dangerous!I'm slowly introducing myself to barleywines and this one almost scared me off.I do have to appreciate it for what it is though.Appearance is a clean deep ruby with a thin film of beige for a head and the aroma is very nice.Scent of chocolate,caramel,raisin and faint cherries came from across the table.Taste is more chocolate and fruit with an immense dry,bitter hop kick.Your mouth can't stop puckering.Aftertaste is dry with an elixir remnants.I almost couldn't finish it, but I gotta do what I gotta do.This is a very good barleywine and if that's your style, you will enjoy.If you are new to this, then proceed with caution."
"paid $2.99"
"Soooey! Wow, what a beer be here. Plum out of your head with the richness of this giant beer. Pours a hazy, murky light copper with a thin tan head and light lacing. The nose is awesome putting huge notes of fruit and malt at center stage,. Purely an acohol blast disguised in malt clothing. Sweet with balancing hops barely restraining the overwhelming nature of this brew. Thick, rich, creamy mouthfeel with lots of reminders of the ABV, from the warmth to the residual tang from the whang. Goodness Gracious, Great Balls of Fire!"
"Drinkability: One is plenty... but not cuz it's not good. Crusty is a great name for this whale of an ale."
"The same deep dark and handsome color on the pour, head is modest and the lace residue a fine covering sheet. The nose fusel alcohol, malt, caramel, more like bourbon than beer, Tons of sweet malt at the start, top thick and the finish dastardly in its acidic bite, detrimental amount of hops, devastating is the alcohol sting, aftertaste alcohol bitter and long lasting. ""God"" how I love this beer and I just found a 12oz bottle? Never seen that one before, yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus and he works for Rogue."
"2002 Vintage: Pours a nice tan head that dissapated quickly. The beer is dark tea in color. It smells like sweet malty alcohol, with just a bit of cherry to round it out. The taste is at first sweet, but barleywine sweet, as in you know its gonna bite you if you drink it too quick. The sweetness fades into malty caramel, which in turn disappears as the bitter aftertaste comes rolling in. It continues to bite at the back of your tongue as your stomach warms."
"ng"
"Fairly small tan head that recedes to form a ring around the edges of the glass. Very deep hazy copper in color. Lots or rich caramel malt, a touch or fruitiness, hints or rum, and a trace of hops all on the nose. Old Crustacean has a smooth start of nice caramel malt  sweet, but not overly so. The alcohol is noticeable towards the middle and fades somewhat towards the finish. Strong hops and roasted bitterness finish out the brew and linger for a while. The alcohol hit me rather quickly with this brew. I doubt I could drink more then one. The roasted notes and hop bitterness were more then other barely wines that Ive had that tend to lean heavily in the malt direction. Old Crustacean is big in all directions. As it warms, the alcohol, malts, and bitterness seem to meld together more and more. Good brew. Nice barley wine to sit back, relax, and enjoy slowly. Id like to let one of these age and see how it mellows. At this point, its anything but mellow."
"Overall: A highly impressive, gorgeous Barleywine. This was the first time I have seen the RogueXS OC Barleywine. I only picked one up  damn, I wish I got a couple more because I bet this 2002 sucker ages really well in the next 5 years!!"
"($3.49 / 7 oz.) & ($3.99 / 12 oz.)"
"This is such a unique ale, and the smells, flavor, and feel of it are in a class all by itself that really defies description. It is one of the most amazing beers that I've had the privelege to drink and is just a hair away from perfect 5's all around, mostly due to the overweight alcohol feel."
"This is the best barleywine i have ever had! The aroma is sweet and full of esters and malt with a slight hoppiness. The flavor is complementary to the aroma as it is a lot like the aroma except for a hidden chocolate flavor and an excellent hop bitterness that allows this barleywine to be tasted again and again without being either too sweet or too bitter. Smooth character is lent from a lighter body than is normally found in barleywines which conributes to the high drinkability. Not a session beer for sure due to the 11.3% alcochol but definetly one to cellar and to cherish along with the best belgian ales. 2002 vintage."
"12oz. bottle, bottled in 2002. Not much head on this dark amber brew that is hazy. Head reduces to a thin film. Aroma is hoppy for a Barley Wine but does have a sweet bready maltiness as well with a hint of caramel. Medium bodied and has a really smooth texture. I'm not a fan of the style but this is pretty decent to me, probably due to the hops. Flavor is sweet and malty with a bitterness from the hops. Has a bit of a kick at the end but alcohol is hidden well. Very bitter aftertaste and a nice warming sensation"
"Quite syruppy, with warming alcohol in the finish. Bitter hops finish, loads of hops. Caramelly/chocolatey malts, some roasty coffee. Loads of ingredients and flavour, some herbal notes. Once again with Rogue, you're guaranteed flavour, just a bit too syruppy and a touch cloying. (Bottle-GBBF 03')"
"I drank this bitch with high expectations and Lord, were they met. I've never written a review that was particularly descriptive of a beer's qualities and I'm not about to start; sometimes, it's redundant and unnecesary to comment upon hop and malt content when dozens of others have done so. HOWEVER, this was one of the most notably hoppy, malty, fruity, alcoholic-y bottles o' hooch I ever done swallowed. This little barnacle bolstered my affinity for barleywines, and as long as world-class breweries like Rogue continue to churn them out, I'll be a returning customer."
"2002 version - Deep brown color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A BIG BOLD HOPPY/Malty barley wine. Thick and chewy, extremely hoppy. There are very rich sweet malts in this beer but they take a while to get through the hop assault. Very nice, this one is from the new XS 12oz bottles. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter. Etched/painted beer bottle."
"The beer poured a dark reddish color with very little head. It had a wonderful, fruity, rich, creamy, almost cherry ice cream soda type of aroma.The first mouthful had a cherry, hoppytaste with a very smooth mouthfeel.Then a very bitter backtaste made itself evident. After further sips, a strong alcohol presence became evident. I would have liked this better if I had more time to drink it. Definitely a slow sipping brew."
"Real nice pour,pours a chesnut brown with a slight orange hue with a nice creamy almond colored head.Aroma is fruity and sweet,a very chewy beer nice and fruity with a definent hop profile in the finish.This beer is an American classic to some and it is a very nice beer."
"2002 bottling. Pours a gorgeous chestnut with a small head that reduced to an island of foam in the shape of Italy. Aroma is sweet fruit with raisin and fig undertones. Incredibly thick mouthful with what might just be the perfect level of carbonation. Taste is an incredible balance of sweet fruit, bitter chocolate/coffee, spices, and hops. Finish is a dry, almost chalky bitterness, but not in a bad way. Bitterness aside, smooth as silk and not even a hint of the 11% abv present in this beast. Wonderful."
"This is an excellent brew, completely different from the tap version (see my other review). This is one of the best barleywines around, however I think it would be better if the bittering hops in the finish were more subdued, as it loses it's balance towards the end and limits it's drinkability."
"The beer pours a hazy dark amber color with a 1/4"" head. The nose is really malty with some hop overtones. There is a large presence of crystal and other specialty malts. The taste is good, but a bit high on the abv.. There is a nice balance between the malt and hop flavor. This makes the elevated abv. more managable. The mouthfeel is good; smooth and not overly carbonated. This a heavy bodied beer. It is a good one and done beer; tastey and powerful."
"Pours to a blood red color with a tan ring of lacing. The aroma has a fruity maltiness. Has a biscuity malt aroma as well. It has a very malty, fruity flavor which flows to a deep bitter finish. Definitely a high octane brew. It will warm you up. It is very complex in its aromas and flavors. A very good Barley-wine that I would definitely sample again."
"Notes- Could be awesome with a slice of carrot cake, or pecan pie with a scoop of ice cream. This is a great beer from a very respectable brewery. This beer is begging for aging. If you buy some, make sure you save it for a while."
"1995 vintage. A local beer bar had an aged keg that had been brought from Rogue for a tasting night. I was very impressed by this beer. Time has been very good to it. The color is a rich copper color. Almost no head to it. The aroma is very malty sweet. There is a bit of hops to the nose. They are more prevalent in the taste, but time has married the hops and malts quite well. There is a sweet smoothness to the beer, with a subtle, but potent hop aftertaste. It seems as if it has to get awhile to get to this point, but well worth the wait if you have some to put down!"
"Sweet nutty rich smell. Deep ruby color. Tan head disapates rapidly (ABV) to a lighter pale lace and sheen. Original round rich smooth malt, orange peel, and cherry followed quickly by a crushingly bitter hoppy finish. Rich smooth mouth. Big grapefruit, quinine, orange peel, dry tongue... wonderful bitterness. As it warms in the goblet it rounds.. and rounds. Much better at slightly below room temperature! Yummmm."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a dark reddish-brown with one fat finger of head. There is good lacing left on the glass. The smell is packed with hops, and there is some sweet caramel on the nose as well. The taste hits you like a brick wall. Loaded full of hops, this is what 120 IBUs tastes like huh? Somewhere underneath all those hops, there is a bit of a nutty flavor, and some alcohol as well. The mouthfeel is very heavy and strong. The drinkability is way down though. This beer can only be described as a Bigfoot that has just been kicked in the nuts and is out for blood."
"Poured out auburn read with a small head. Smell was hoppy, with some sweet malt in there. Taste was bitter hops, with alcohol and some sweetness in there. The hops were obtrusive to me; it seemed they were out of place. I prefer my barleywines on the sweet side, and I must admit I was dissapointed. This could have been so much better than it was, because I did get glimpses of what was behind the hops, but not enough to make this a beer I'd go back to on a regular basis..."
"Thick grainy pour, hazy nutmeg brown appearance with a speckly but pretty scant head. many ring laces. Resinous aromas, some balsam and hints of acidity and alcohol. Starts with a lump of malt, like a thick slug of molasses that evens out as the monster 120 IBUs makes its presence known. Still a ginger-like sweetness battles the hops valiently, but not quite so much of a throat kicker as a relatively new and raw Bigfoot. Pretty impressively brewed beer, thick and flavorful with a decent sense of balance when a characterful sweetness factors in to the equation. This beer may not calm down for quite a while."
"2000 vintage. Appearance is fairly average, with dark copper coloring and a dark beige frothy head that dissipates quickly. Looks can be deceiving - the aroma is the first clue. It's strong and consists of sweet malt, some hop bitter, and definite alcohol. Then the flavor sucker-punched me in the head. Huge flavor all at once, very rich and malty with a kickin' hop bitter, and an alcohol kick at the back of the tongue. Bitter orange peel aftertaste, with nuances of sweet candy. Tangy alcoholic bitter aftertaste sticks in the back of the throat. Very smooth mouthfeel, low carbonation. Low drinkability due to the wallop that is delivered. This one ended my evening, and then pounded my forehead in the morning."
"Overall Impression: I know it's probably blasphemous, but I'm not a huge fan of Rogue's beers. I've tried 9 or 10 of them and they were all pretty aggressively bitter, even their American Amber was assertive. Finely crafted beers and a brewery that deserves a lot of respect, but I find the high hop rate a bit boring. It's pretty easy to throw a ton of hops in a beer. I must admit, I'm not much of a hop-head, so take my Rogue reviews with a grain of salt. If there's a Rogue ale that is balanced, I'd like to try it."
"Pours a very deep amber brown hue with a tan off white head, just from the texture of the pour I can tell this is a very big beer. Well here we go aroma from the beginning I am getting notes of plum buried deep inside a garden of overzealous vinous hops of pine cone slash grapefruit west coast variety but with the deep overly ripened fruit tones this is a definite monster barley wine great. The forefront of the flavor gives an eye-opening rush of hop bitterness mixed with some joyous malt and fruit undertones, just a huge beer from Rogue I admire a brewery willing to go over the top but still create an outstanding example of a barley wine. With deep tones of alcohol and slightly salty sweet shimmering notes of malt this beer is quite an experience bottled in 2002, just amazing. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy without being cloying in my opinion. Drinkability is well try one and leave it at that what an experience a must try west coast barley wine, let's put it this way Bigfoot is tame compared to this."
"I finally tracked this one down. It's 2002 vintage. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, it explodes out of the glass with a thick looking off white head. However, the head was gone before the beer was half gone, leaving an unadorned reddish-brown liquid. The smell is almost all hops, with pine scents and a noticeable alcohol aroma. It's quite bitter initially, but the malt makes its presence known as it warms. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, and it's very drinkable for a 11%+ beer."
"Glad I decided to open it!"
"The taste was equally warm and malty. Side notes of fruit and hops, all which was very smooth and was way to easy to drink. Decent for a barleywine, though not what I'd expected from Rogue. It made for a good desert though."
"Originally sampled on 27 October 2002. This reddish/brown barleywine starts out with lots of malt up front. It finishes w/ some hoppiness. The 11.3% ABV warms you up quite quickly. As barleywines go, this is a pretty good one. Just don't try & drive right afterwards."
"This beer poured very dark and had a moderate head and moderate lacing on the glass. The aroma was somewhat complex and I couldn't tell anything particular in the smell. The taste was very strong and difficult to drink at first, but you become accustomed to it quickly. With the alcohol content, it shouldn't be hard to drink several of these if you can get past the first one. Not at all pleasing at first, but it doesn't matter much after that."
"Vintage 1998. This is a great beer that is pretty hard to consume when it is young. The hop flavor just invades your pallet like an atomic bomb, or an alpha bomb!. 4 years later it still has quit a hop bang! But more flavors come though now. Little or no oxidation at all. But it would be hard to tell. Some grapefruit mixed with prune. Bitterness lingers for a good while. Even though this beer was flat it had a lot to offer. But damn those small bottles because now Im out!"
"Vintage 1997. A murky, light amber in color, strong earthy and port aroma. Very thick as to be expected, some port and oak, yet some hop and malt notes up front. Vanilla beans, caramel, cola and slight peppery/spicy feel leads you searching for more. The definition of well rounded. Tasty, hoppy in the end, but the 120 IBUs are slightly masked, very crisp and belly warming, well aged, search for it now, cellar it, secure it and enjoy it. One of the best barley wines one the market."
"This is not a casual beer. One of these is about as many as you are going to have in a 24 hour period. Perhaps those who counsel setting this beer aside for a while are right. It's in your face and aggressive. If you had a long night and a pleasant book, you could hardly do better (though I suspect your reading comprehension would suffer!)."
"2002 bottle. Pour is deep hazy mahogany, thick bubbly tan head, mostly diminishing to leave a little lacing. Aroma is sweet, fruity, vinous, hints of alcohol. Flavor is strongly sweet, chewy maltiness, and then come a brutal hop attack that would probably make most wince. Body is full, alcohol becomes more present as it warms up."
"2002 vintage."
"WOW. What a beer. The aroma of this was so strong I could smell it on the other side of the room. Strong malty smell, some chocolate coming off of it and a bit of floral hops and some raisin/plum. Taste was a kick in the nuts if your not used to something like this. I don't think my tongue ever tasted so many flavors at one time. There was malts and hops and raisins and floral hops and chocolate and carmel and a black coffee no sugar and alcohol how can you leave that out there seems to be more but I can't put my finger or tongue on it. Just tons of flavor. WOW. It poured out a dark brown with red highlights and a thin lacey head that completely disappears, only thing left is the sticky lace around the snifter. At first the flavors make it so overwhelming you take your time drinking it.The drinkability is poor at first but as you let this warm it goes down a lot smoother. The mouthfeel is thick with a bit but not much carbonation. This is good beer but if your not used to the extreme flavors this puts out all at once watch out cause WOW just WOW."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a very thin head. Plum and other dark fruit aroma with some alcohol. Taste is also of plums and raisins with hints of caremel. A great beer, but a couple years in the cellar may do this wonders.This was for the 2002 version so it's still pretty young. I think I'll buy a few more to let them age a bit."
"This is one big beer. Like the SN Bigfoot, I think that this brew is very well balanced. However, this one is kicked up a notch or two above SN's offering. A few years in the cellar would bring this beer close to the level of perfection."
"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed a light bubbly tan head that let trace circular lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel, spice and raisins. A flavor of malt, caramel, raisins and a touch of spice. It has a nice silky medium body to it and has a sweet, yet slightly peppery aspect to the finish. A fine barleywine which will probably do better with age."
"(Bottled in 2002:) -- Pours a hazy unrefined reddish copper body. The head is dense and creamy and shows some good retention, and leaves a bit of lace. On the nose I got some whiffs of caramel malts, spices, some fruitiness and pine hopssurprised I picked up these through the strong alcohol aroma. On the palate, the alcohol pierces the mouth with the nearly 12% abv, after the brew warms a bit it is easier to consume with different flavors coming acrosscaramel maltiness, toffee, spices, pine needles, and some nice sweet fruity flavors. Mouthfeel is some-what sharp. It took me about a ½ hour to finish this freakn 12oz beer. This is a monster of a beervery good brew, a slow sipper."
"I am disappointed. While it is cool to be extreme, these 120 IBUs come off as just annoying to me, covering up any nice maltiness or sweetness that is pleasing in thick beers. The high-alpha hop sting is a little too piercing in the taste, and I really am not interested in having another."
"Amazing Barley Wine. That is the long and the short of it. Very chewy with a beautiful hoppy/caramel taste. It is a perfect blend of the above flavors. The color is a nice deep dark copper/brown. Alcohol is balanced perfectly. As the temperature gets more warm, it becomes syrup-like and sweet. Very drinkable indeed."
"2005 Tons of malt, tons of hop bitterness...the journey coninues. Don't let this sucker get into your sinuses, as it likely to put a hole in them.."
"F."
"Smooooooth... A great barleywine on tap. Dark brown with a very small head. The hops hold up quite well. The mouthfeel is supurb. This is another true gem from Rogue. Just remember to pace yourself because the 11.3% can sneak up on you. A good beer to start out the night with."
"2001 Vintage: Pours a hazy, reddish body that appears dark brown when sitting upon the bar. The head is densely creamy and holds well, but it leaves only minor lace. Rich notes of fruity, deep caramel malt and piney hops rush forth to assault the nose. Astounding! The bouquet is almost good enough to simply enjoy on it's own. As I make my way through the serving, between sips I will often simply lift the glass to my nose and breathe in it's resiny goodness. Lingering over it's caramel sweetness and thin sharp fruit, one glass could easily be enjoyed for well over an hour (and I credit that towards its drinkability). But onward... it's full bodied with a very fine, gentle carbonation that leaves it quite creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts with rich caramel maltiness, followed quickly by a tour du force of hop flavor that's almost minty! It's intensely rich with notes of licorice and toffee at first, but the sweetness and berry-like fruitiness begin to ooze out as it warms. This is a potion that's best enjoyed slightly warm! Alcohol isn't really noticeable on the palate, although it's clearly there somewhere. It finishes dry with loads of hop flavor (pine, spruce, citrus) and bitterness, but some residual malt sweetness as well. It really coats the mouth and throat with hoppiness that's almost spicy and has the drying feel of smoke. That, coupled with what dark malt is there, teeters on appearing roasty. Although it's all right-there in front of you and easy to see, this beer is actually quite complex! It changes as it warms, and as your palate becomes overwhelmed. There's just no keeping up with it's brutal hop assault! And that's one of the reasons that Crusty is just as good whithin the year of it's release as it is with several years time. Well worth putting a case away to cellar!"
"This barley wine poured cloudy, dark coffee-brown with thin white foam that did leave some lace down the glass. The smell was mostly floral hops, but with some malty aroma, too. The initial taste was dominated by hops, but eventually the sweet malt did make a valiant effort to come through. There was also a bit of oak in the flavor. The mouthfeel was a battle of sweet malt and strong hop bitterness which almost gave a chalky feel. The carbonation was low. The drinkability was good, and this ale grew on me as I finished the glass. ""Old Crusty"" as the bartenders called it."
"This brew poured a very dark amber color looking almost purple when held to the light. The head was a half-inch thick and tan in color. The lacing was amazing forming perfect sheets all the way around. The smell was very fruity, it is some what like strawberries and raspberries. Hops and malt are also very present in the aroma. The taste is a slightly malty up front followed by some intense bitterness. Of course the alcohol is present in the taste, which makes for a good finish. The mouthfeel is medium, and it goes down fairly smooth for this strong of a beer.This brew has a definite warming effect. I'm pretty positive I couldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting."
"2001 edition. 120 IBUs...Wow! The brew pours a deep shade of brown with orange highlights and a quickly disappearing off-white head. Gobs of fruit in the aroma, along with tootsie roll and a fine oloroso sherry. So many flavors...where to begin? Raisins, chocolate, malt, floral (hops), malt, sweet, dark bread, malt, toffee, malt, toasted nuts and alcohol. Hops bite is prominent but held in check by a moutain of malt. Chewy mouthfeel but not cloying. An excellent cold-weather sipper."
"Pours with a thick frothy head and leaves a serious lace. The bitterness is the taste that comes through. Their site lists the IBU at 120!! Good body, murky reddish brown - it is unfiltered. Hoppy finish. I'm going to keep a 22oz cellared for a year or so and see how it mellows."
"This beer poured into the glass a nutmeg color with orange hues on the edges. It was very cloudy and fairly carbonated. The head was fairly thick, not long lasting and a tan/cream color. No lace present. The aroma was robust and fairly simple until I took it outside and nosed it in the fresh February air at 22 F degrees. After that the aroma just burst into wild smells that were not noticeable inside. Smells of strong sweet fruits – apricots, tangerines, nectarines, green apples –also present were citrus hops, sweet malt, some cocoa hints and of course a waft of alcohol was present. It was thick in the mouth, flavors of a sweet malt, fruit, lite chocolate malt, yeast/bread, citrus tart hops and lots of alcohol. The aftertaste was a combination of alcohol and hops. WOW what a beer. Left you mouth feel great and wanting more. Rouge does it again."
"Drinkability: This certainly got better as it warmed. I'm still trying to dial in my dedicated beer fridge temperature (happy birthday to me..) and it was about 40 degrees when I started. After letting it sit for about 30 minutes, it was definitely better. Overall, a very good barleywine. A little hop-heavy (a previous reviewer's quote of ""The IPA of barleywine?"" is certainly appropriate), but still very good."
"the hop load really caught up with me as i finished the bottle. lots of citrusy and fruity flavors coated my mouth long after the bottle was finished. this is a barley wine to wake up the senses and excite the taste buds. i'm assuming the age of this one mellowed out the profile somewhat, because it seemed so drinkable. needless to say i wasn't satisfied with only seven ounces, but it did warm me up a little bit! rogue old crusty is a great brew and proved to be a nice treat!"
"Rogue barleywine: pours a reddish brown, very hazy. Off white head, with out much stickiness, and not a very long retention. Aroma is very malty, and quite strong. Hmm, the taste is not what I would have hoped. Very malty taste, with more than a little hint of hazelnut. Hops linger though, long lasting taste. As I sip the rest of the beer, the taste improves, although the aftertaste does not. After further reflection, I believe the high level of alcohol intrudes on the taste too much. Fairly decent, but I’d not pick it up again."
"As I was drinking this beer I was thinking about my review, thank goodness I took notes! Pours a nice dark brown, speckled highlights of tan, off tan head that dissapates quickly. Hardly any head or lace, but good strong aroma of malt, hops and caramel. I could detect the alcohol on the first sip, along with roasted malts and big hops. Thick mouthfeel, a little creamy and hardly any carbonation. A big alcohol kick in the end, but the equally big hop kick balances well. Definitely a one and done as the alcohol got to me, still I could have one for dessert every night."
"It poured a thick hazy darkish brown with no head at all. Just a fine layer of foam, barely. The smell had a malty, citrus, hoppy aroma with a hint of alcohol. The taste was very flavorful with the citrus and malty flavor and a smooth sweet/bitter creamy taste in the mouth. Then, after all is done the bitterness hit you like a sludge hammer. That bitterness was to stong for my taste. The aroma and flavor were just so complex, but to be ruin by the extreme bitterness, was such a shame."
"This is one powerful brew and sure warmed me up on a chilly night. Color is a deep tawny brown, nice darkish head, lacing was decent but started only halfway down the glass. A very hoppy over the top ale, very bitter and tart. Thick substantial body, and smells real nice.This is a complete opposite from Old Nick which was much smoother but not near as aromatic. A very substantial and heavily hopped strong ale. The IPA of Barley Wines? Fine for slow sipping on a winter evening"
"Of the few Barleywines I've tried, this is the worst. Not bad, but the others were better. The taste was a bit ragged with a harsh bitterness. I like my hops, but not these hops I guess. I really expected to like this beer more. I like Barleywines, I like bitter, I like hops. This beer is less than the sum of its parts. I'll try it again after some serious ageing."
"This is one powerful brew! In the glass, it's a hazy, chesnut brown with an off-white, yellowish, loose, quickly disappating head. Floral hops, light citrus, and malt fruitiness is on the nose. Flavor is rich caramel, intense, malt sweetness, followed by spicy hops and a spicy alcohol mix which then fades into a masochistic grapefruit peel assault on the taste buds. To call the finish of this bitter is a massive understatement. The bitterness feels like it's digging out the core of your tastebuds... and for some reason I find it enjoyable! The first sip, I thought, ""hmm, this isn't that bitter..."" but it just intensified as I went on. A worthy candidate for my 20th review."
"Cheers."
"1998 Vintage: If you look up barley wine in the dictionary, they should have a picture of this one right next to it. Defines what a barley wine is all about...definitely a complex sipping beer..tremendously hopped(on the bottle it says 120 IBU), and I'm guessing very strong...a warming effect evident..a treat for those who love this style..."
"Cheers to Rogue for another great product."
"Like a tsunami of sweet caramelly and chocolate malt, Old Crusty comes crashing into an ill prepared community of taste buds leaving an everlasting wake of dry and biting hops. When the powerful flow finally recedes your left with a damaged subfloor covered in spruce buds and a dozen insurance salesmen pounding at the door. But you don't care! No, the rush of it all made you realize how sedentary you had become and now you want more. More of that German chocolate cake flattened into the evergreen forest floor. More of that shaven fluid oozing down your thirsty pipes. More."
"451"
"I've never had another style of beer where the hops and malt were both so prominent! Green hops leap out of the bottle, but a strong malt feel lies below. I didn't taste the alcohol, but certainly felt it! I only had one, don't think I could drink more than that in one session. Poured nicely, significant head and lace. Very fresh and lively. Quite a taste experience! I like strong beer, and this one TASTES strong. I will add that barley wine is one of my favorite styles, and this is right behind bigfoot as one of the best."
"the alcohol is hidden very well by the malts at the beginning, but you get a winey alcohol kick at the end. the malts are in a great balance that only breaks up with the dry finish. the body is nice and rich with low carbonation and a smooth feel. this brew is a much better drinker than other barley wines i have had. hopefully others to come will be more like this one."
"Drinkability: To judge this against other barley-wines would only be fair...outstanding drinkability! This is a truly spectacular beer to sip and enjoy with a great book, or as a night-cap. I need to buy more of this..."
"A thick, chewy, and malty beer...don't you just love barleywines. Rogue has a more distinctive hop presence than have many of the other barleywines that I have had the joy of trying. It has a hazy reddish-brown appearance and a rather diminutive head. A very drinkable beer. Too bad I have to drive to VA to purchase due to NC's (unbelievably useless) 6% abv law."
"I found a 1995 bootle of Old Crustacean and said why not(it's only 7 yrs.)? It was a good choice to say the least. All 6.4ozs. and 100 IBU's held up great. It poured very cloudy with hardly any head. Sweet caramel aroma was faint. I can taste raisin but it was as perffectly balanced as any barley wine i've tasted. The 6.4ozs. is just enough to have at any one time."
"1997 7oz bottle sweet malty aroma, mellowed hops, warming alcohol feel, not much head, sweet and malty, I don't care for the tiny 7oz bottle, need more of this fine barley wine, I will have to get a couple more bottles of this, this one has aged well."
"This is a bottle of the 2001 that I found in NJ. Dark amber in color with no head. The smell is sherry and hops but not over powering. Barley Wines are my favorite style and this did not disappoint. The hops are prominent at 120 IBU's. There is a slight alcohol taste more in the finish that I bet would go away with another year of ageing. Warming and relaxing, a great sipping beer. Another great offering from Rogue."
"Quite a dark shade of amber for a barley-wine.  Hopped well, but not overly-hopped, giving it a wonderful aroma and bitterness without overshadowing the sweetness.  Alcohol is definitely noticeable, so stay away if you cannot handle that.  The bitterness and syrupy sweetness combine for a really cool mouthfeel."
"2002 Vintage:  Oooooooooh BABY!!!  Pours a delicious looking cloudy dark amber with a small light tan head.  The delicious aromas of a sweet fruit and nuts make my mouth water as good as any great beer ever has!  Sweet mother of Pearl!  This stuff is delicious in case I haven't mentioned that yet.  The semi-sweet fruity taste and tart bitterness of hops that resemble grapefruit are blended nicely so that you don't even notice the 11.3% ABV although there is a warming feeling that increases with each swallow that overcomes you. It has a lightly sticky mouthfeel to this medium bodied brew.  My first barleywine and it's love at first taste!  Cheers!"
"2002 Vintage: Reminds me of Stone Ruination IPA.  But its a barlywine?  Very bitter hops.  Smells of alcohol, yet does not burn.  Expected this beer to be more complex, there are a lots of flavors peeking through the huge hop presence.  Will age well."
"2002 Vintage: Brilliant solid red with a gold robe. A six-pointed star pattern of very fine bubbles settles onto the surface. The aromas feature freshly cracked new pecans, honey, and terracotta, all in an enormous, profound display of riches. As it opens there are hints of freshly butchered beef, hazelnuts, and sweet prarie grasses that emerge. The flavors are a thundering cascade of velvet: burned sugar, cola, maple wood, black pepper and vanilla bean appear in turn. A keeper, if you can keep your hands off of it."
"Wow.  This barleywine is a hop-head's delight.  Pours out to a dark amber color in the glass.  Aroma is nice, with that hop-nose you know is a preview to that hop taste.  Literally as complex as a beer can be.  So many tastes were going through my mouth that I couldn't really put a finger on just one.  Raison, molasses, and a slight sweetness that give way to this ""in you face"" blast of hops.  If there is a hoppier beer out there, I haven't had it yet."
"2000 Vintage: Hazy garnet hue, covered by a thin soapy head due to the high alcohol.  Intense caramel and toasty malt w/ a wallop of buttery toffee in aroma.  Fruitiness eeks in, combines w/ the sweetness resulting in a red licorice  - like note.  Mild vinous alcohol and hints of sherry are present as well. Although subdued, the waft of heaty fusels are a harbinger of a potent brew.  This warms my nostrils if I inhale deeply. Trace pine hop nose.  Rich and enticing aromawise.  Deeply toffeeish sweetness hits the palate initially, but quickly gives way to assertive, sharp, yet clean hop bitterness that more than offsets what would be a cloyingly sweet malt profile.  Caramel notes, and nutty sweetness akin to peanut brittle provide contrast to the quenching bitterness mid palate. Hop flavor has faded into muted citrus.  Full in body and very dextrinous in mouthfeel, partially due to the apparent high final gravity.  Finishes w/ lingering hop bitterness and residual sweetness on the lips.  Enveloping alcohol warmth grows progressively stronger throughout.  Old Crusty 2000 has matured wonderfully.  The hop bitterness is still sharp, but the rich buttery malt is not overshadowed.  Intense and absolutely delcious."
"Dark amber-brown. Head has been lost in the aging for the most part. A more malty nose than the 2001, but still very hoppy. Strong, sweet caramel and chocolate with intense plum and dark fruit. Hops are citrusy and a bit piney. Great aroma that definitely improved with age. Excellent taste as well, spicy and citrus hops with huge caramel/chocolate malt and alcohol heat, one hell of a full body. This is definitely a beer to cellar, and more than the recommended one year."
"Pours a dark amber/medium brown color with a decent head that fades fast and leaves a nice lace down the glass.  Tons of sweet maltiness and some nice piney hoppiness in the aroma of this one.  Huge caramel maltiness to start this one off with some nice hoppy twangs in it as well.  Great piney character as well and some slight alcohol warming.  Nice and smooth but a little bit thin for the style, however, the brew remains awesomely drinkable.  Damn this is on fine BW.  Yet another great one from Rogue."
"(note to self: pick up more bottles of Ol Crust 1999 tomorrow)"
"1998 Vintage: The pour on this beer was so flat that I had to hold it to the light and make sure there were some carbonation bubbles coming up the side of the glass. Appearance like prune juice. First sip and 120 IBU's of hops storm in. Some caramelized dark fruit follows along in the hops' wake. A very tasty and drinkable barleywine, although I was looking for a little more depth, given that this has had 3 or 4 years to age. Still, a very nice barleywine."
"This poured a beautiful, deep amber color. The head was minimal, and didn't retain very well, although it did leave nice lace on the glass. I put this away for three months after I initially got it, and I think it could have certainly been cellared for many more months, or years, for that matter. This has a huge hoppy bitterness to it, and is almost a little unbalanced, but you won't hear me complaining. Another excellent creation from the folks at Rogue."
"Beautiful looking brew!  Deep, dark, murky reddish brown body with a thick bubbly head.  Good head retention, with lots of lace.  Aroma is salty, with notes of toffee, fruit, and spicy hops.  Flavor dominated by hops - way too much hops.  Malt overpowered, but still adds some solid flavor.  Very salty taste as well.  Nice fruity notes, especially in the finish, but are somewhat lost in the salt and bitter hops.  Too young, too young...I'll certainly try another bottle in a year or so."
"1999 Vintage: Hazy upon the pour, with no head whatsoever.  I was careful (maybe foolish) to leave a wee bit left over because I could see in the bottle an abundance of ""stuff"" (yeast?).  All I could smell was hops.  Just hops.  All I could taste was, well, hops.  Tremendous bitterness, just  heaving itself at you without regard for your taste buds.  The most bitter beer I have ever tasted.  For whatever reason I like this beer.  It is sort of  like the graduation of beers:  you need to love beer to enjoy this.  No one else would.  A perfect afer dinner drink to really clean the palate."
"1999 Vintage: Close to heavenly, the hops are still running wild even after three years of aging. Touch of estery alcohol and a dollop of fruitiness partially from the hops."
"Pours with a substantial light tan head. Cloudy/muddy amber liquid. Nose is malty, fruity yeast & hops. Taste is supercharged fresh hops...followed by more hops! Goddamm, this is liquid hops in the extreme... finish is just enough malt to let you know this isn't hop juice you are drinking, followed by more extreme hop bitterness! Not recommended for disciples of Coors Light, Bud Light...or any other light colored/flavored beer for that matter, this is Manly-man's beer!"
"1998 Vintage: Pours no head. Murky, brown/burgandy color. Huge earthy hop tones mix with a fruity sweetness on the nose. Mouthfeel can be compared to cough syrup. There is a medicinal property in the taste as well. Huge bitterness coming from Centennial hops (as well as Chinook I believe) . IBU = 120 for this brew. But there is also an abundance of sweet flavor. Only John Maier could make a beer with such incredible hop bitterness and malt sweetness like this. There is indeed a warming effect with this brew. Not for the faint of heart. One of my favorite Barleywines. My son and this beer were born in the same year. My son is now four. Both are great treats. And luckily I have several more of these brews to improve with age (as my son will I'm sure too)."
"2000 Vintage: Picked up a 8oz from the brewery and decided to pop it a couple of days later.  Prabably should have waited a few months for a little more mellowing.  Good amber color with a medium body.  complex flavor character with very apparent alcohol taste and warming.  Not bad at all, but definitely a sipper."
"Oh BTW... they are now in 12oz bottles... oh happy day!"
"The yeast had broken down in the keg and leech out a bready/yeasty flavour in the background, and there was loads of proteins and the like permanently suspended in the beer, but it was still a good beer."
