"Impressive and powerful barleywine, glad I aged it though the fundamental muscular character isn't going to ever age out of this beer. While not as complex as I expected, this is s perfect after-dinner treat on a winter day...that said, a little goes a long way."

"One of my favorite barleywines.  It actually reminds me a lot of aged Real Ale Sisyphus (which is a criminally underrated barelywine in Texas).  Always a treat to drink, and I am glad I have had the chance to try it on many different occasions."

"P.S. The bottle presentation is the best I've ever seen. Truly a work of art. Sorry to see they won't be packaging it like this anymore, but happy to have a few vintages in my cellar to admire and enjoy."

"Need more bottles for science. Must age for comparison."
"This is a great barleywine. The most impressive thing is that it tastes great, even young. This will only improve in time. This is hard to get, but it's worth seeking out."

"Overall: this is outstanding. It's not a complicated barleywine; instead its simple, sweet, and mellow."
"Overall- Tasty American barleywine. Complex with a lot of different sources of sweetness to it. The hops are clearly secondary to the malts, which is what I like in a non-BA barleywine. Thanks for this one Matt."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is really, really good. It's very complex and the cooperation between the sweet malts, bitter hops and boozy alcohol works very well together. Although it doesn't get in the way per se, it's still quite hot at the moment, so giving it some time might be a good idea. I'd like to get another bottle to sit on for a couple years, or even just get an older bottle of this to try out. Probably 3-4 years would be the sweet spot. Cheers again cparles. This was great."
"O: Nice mildly hoppy barleywine. Great layers of complexity that are quite well balanced. Big and heavy without being too sweet or boozy. Though some barrel aging would certainly accentuate this one, I think. Still delicious, any way you slice it."

"Such a joy to drink. Not overly complicated, just seamlessly integrated thanks in large part to the mellowing effects of age on the pungent barleywine yeast and alpha acid character."

"Overall: The best barelywine I have ever tasted. So, so much flavor. I feel lucky to have had the chance to try it."

"O: One of the best barleywines I have had, rich and complex, but extremely smooth and easy drinking for style and abv. Fantastic."

"Creamy, slick, and oily. Fully bodied and filling."

"O- very good American Barleywine. Very sweet and citrusy beer that has a great mouthfeel. I wish I have had this fresh to compare if it has more bitterness and any other differences."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a very well-made barleywine. Long finish and heady strength (but the aroma wouldn't justify that remark). I'm more and more tempted to crack my '07 bottle, every day."
""
""
"Poured perfectly clear. Deep maple, almost brown, but beautiful honey hues in the light. Creamy, long lasting head with multiple trails of lace. Very nicely balanced aromas of caramel creme and grapefruit zest... reminds me almost of a creamsicle very briefly, but then turns into english toffee, butterscotch, and a touch of vanilla. The forefront is sweet and fruity, leading to a mid palate burst of molasses, toffee, raisins, and finishing with rum and citrusy hops. Perfect carbonation for this style and flavor profile. Absolutely amazing barleywine."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with a citrus zest flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some nice barleywine aromas and flavors."

"O - Solid barleywine that definitely leans towards the bready and malty side. Worth trying a bottle if you can get ahold of one."
""
"overall: good"
""
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a huge bubbly beige head that persists forever. Upon first pour I and assaulted with aromas of tropical fruits. Upon closer inspection I get lots of toffee, brown sugar, caramel, and dark dried fruits with a hint of alcohol and a faint bit of earthy hop. The flavor is smooth and sweet with just enough ethanol and earthy to provide some balance. Flavors of caramel and brown sugar with a hint of chocolate mixed with cherries, and plums go down quite smooth. Medium to thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet syrupy bubbly mouthfeel. This is a very nice barleywine, I wish I could try it a bit fresher, but I quite enjoyed this aged version today."

"Big thanks goes out to JackTheBear for sharing this one during the One Year Anniversary of My Wreck Tasting! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Crooked Stave ‘Crooked Line’ tulip. Poured a hazy red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, earth, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Nothing with the exception of the aroma really stood out to me on this one. While the aroma wasn’t really complex at all it was still fairly well balanced and inviting. I just wish the flavor would have followed suit much closer. The flavor wasn’t bad by any means, but it definitely wasn’t one of the best from the style that I’ve had. Worth trying if you get the chance, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to do so."
"2009 vintage, The bottle was split wit 2 friends, poured into tumbers. The pour was deep red, slight white head. The aroma was sweet, ton of caramel notes, fruity, vanilla. It is very sweet, vanilla, figs, dark fruits, finishes with a pleasant sweetness. Gratitude is thick, light carbonation, I did not notice the alcohol. I really enjoyed it, although it was too sweet for one of my friends. Right now it is drinking like an English Barley wine."

"pours deep ruby red with a 1 finger off white head. smells of figs with some caramel apple. taste starts off very fruity green apples, pear and fig come to mind then ends with a nice sweet presence. mouthfeel is a little on the light side and carbonation is in there but soft. overall this beer blew my mind the first time i had it and this time achieved nothing less. outstanding beer alcohol is so well hidden and flavors all balance amazingly together."
"4.25/5"
"Overall: I'm kicking myself for playing the waiting game a little too long -- I have to wonder if even a few months may have made a significant difference in the overall quality. Definitely still a great beer, and it's got a heavier body with a big ABV, so it's not something any one is going to plow through. It won't be easy, but I'll find it within myself to drink the whole thing down."
"Cost: $25 for a 750 ml bottle."
""
""
""
"O: Interesting and unique barleywine, but drinkability is hurt a bit by the sweetness and heavy body. Wows initially, but over the course of an hour sipping the beer, there's plenty of time to pick up on flaws which are masked in the first impressions."
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens full in body and lightly carbonated with mildly bitter piney hops with brown sugar, raisins, toffee and a really nice burnt sugar flavor as well. Mild maple sugar is present. Sweet on the finish, with a little bit of alcohol present, this is very nice. Thankfully, this isn't a crystal malt bomb like some other American barleywines I've had recently."
""
"Overall - Really good. One of the better barleywines I've tasted. No need for a barrel to make this one spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I guessed this correctly while I was taking notes. A nice take on a American barleywines with plenty of dark fruit and citrus notes. Not overly sweet or hop forward, which I enjoyed."
""
""
"Poured from bomber (2010 batch #595 of 1500 bottles: Indigo wax) into tulip glass. Pours burnt amber red. Sweet grape, caramel, and classic barley wine aromatics. Flavor of brown sugar, some cherries, and this reminded me of a muted/toned down version of Three Floyd's collaboration with Mikkeller - Oatgoop. Thin mouthfeel with decent carbonation throughout. This brew actually tastes better when approaching room temperature. Overall this was a little disappointing despite its high ratings. I expected more out of this one."
""

"2007 Release with the Yellow wax, purchased at the Brewery in 2009: This one had to be the toughest wax I’ve ever encountered on a beer bottle. Once I got it open it poured a dark, cloudy dark copper color. There was a large tan head on it that didn’t linger too long. No lacing. Somewhat sweet nose. Caramel, honey, some spices and dark fruits. The taste is sublime. A slight slickness on the tongue. Very smooth taste. This has aged quite well. Caramel, spice, fruits, slightly sweet, yet a subtle bit of bitterness back there. Don’t know how widely this is distributed, but well worth searching out of you get to Pittsburgh."
"East End Gratitude pours an opaque mahogany. Four fingers or so of light tan foam rise up to crown the beer, displaying good head retention. Lacing forms nearly a solid ring at the apex, but is extremely spotty below. The nose has lots of brown sugar and caramel, with a noticeable nuttiness to it as well. It's just a touch dweak in intensity though. The flavor is much more robust, with notes of fruity cherries and some sherry from the oxidation jumping out. The malty base of the beer accounts itself with more brown sugar and caramel. If anything I'd say that the malty base is a touch too much in the background as far as balance in the flavor profile goes. The cherry is a little bit unexpected (maybe particularly ester-y fermentation), but works out nicely with everything else.The body isn't is rich and full as I might have anticipated, which does work well in making this beer drink easier, but I like the mouthfeel for a barleywine to have a certain luxuriant quality. The carbonation is very nice and muted, just barely enough to carbonate the beer. Gratitude is a very nice offering for one of my favorite styles."
"O: Solid barleywine but a bit disappointing. I imagine the sweetness dies down in the older vintages. I was expecting something fuller."
""

"2008 vintage with green wax. Bottle generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours clear dark amber with a small head that mostly consists of large bubbles at the edge of the glass. Aroma is very fruity with pineapple, plum, same caramel, mango, and floral notes. Initial taste is sweet with mango, plum, pineapple and some caramel. The finish has a decent bitterness. Medium-light body. Low carbonation."
"Overall - A great Barleywine that I enjoyed quite a bit. Does it live up to it hype? Nope, but I have been spoiled by a wealth of barrel-aged Barleywines lately. Still, I was so happy to finally scratch this bad boy off my list!"
""
""
""
""
"D: Very good"
"O :The alcohol is very well hidden making this quite easy to drink, but definitely a sipper."
""
"Taste is balanced and mellow, good bitterness and a nice hoppy rich bite on the end. The finish is really good"

"M&D - smooth for such a big beer, complex layers of sweetness, the year on it seemed to help it immensely. Wish I could get this one without the necessary trade."
"Overall this is my first experience with this beer, which is crazy because my sister went to college in Pittsburgh for 3.5 years. How did I not know about this brewery and make here get me bottles; poor job by me... Anyway this is a very good beer but when compared to the greats of the stle, it falls a bit short for me. I would much rather have and Alaskan Barley Wine, which I believe is the ""Gold Standard"" for the style. It is much more readily available or accessable via trade or online order from various shops. This is a viscous and heavy in flavor, which is good and bad; would like a tad more carbonation to balance the heft. The alcohol becomes a bit overbearing towards the bottom of the bottle, so overall, while this was very good, I have to say this is not worth trading a great deal for given the rarity and the price of vintage editions."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had almost every vintage since, and it's always a pleasure. Different nuances come out every year. Ages well, and is always surprising when someone is gracious enough to open a bottle."
"Overall impression - splendid! Easily one of the best of its kind."
""
""
""
"O - Really impressed for how old this one is. It was a nice surprise to try the 2005, as it was the only vintage I haven't had. I would think the 2006/2007 would be drinking phenomenally right now and would like to try them to compare. A very nice barleywine."
""
"Overall: This is a review of the yellow was bottle. I was expecting great things but, having had a goose island king henry recently, I was a bit disappointed."
"I'll likely fill out this review with my notes on '06-'09 when I figure out where I put them."
""
""
"O: All in all, bravo! This is a balanced barleywine that hides the high ABV very well. If you like a good strong sweet brew, then this is for you. I highly recommend and will be hunting down more bottles for myself!"
""
""
""
"Drink- Joe, you are a stud for this one!!I probably won't trade for this one seeing as I dont have the ammo, but for one night I had some of this bad boy."
""
""
"Overall – Not what I was expecting to be blunt. An interesting barleywine with no alcohol heat or flavors to speak of. Oddly I wanted to warm it up a bit like cider, haha. Wish it had some more carbonation. Have another 2010 in the cellar I’ll sit on for a few years to see how it changes."
"Overall this has aged wonderfully. Can't wait for this years release early next year. Getting a lot more of it this time for sure. It's miles better than it was at release and I thought it was pretty damn good then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was happy to be able to try this one. It didn't quite live up to the expectations I had built up in my head but still, a very nice beer. Recommended."
""
""
""
"Wow, this is one of the best barleywines I've ever had. It has aged perfectly, and has a very complex and satisfying taste. Excellent."
"Overall: I was pretty underwhelmed by this one. It is a good beer, but It didn't live up to the hype for me. The smell was a bit weird."
"This poured out as a deep orange color. The head was minimal intact it was just a thin white film on top of the beer. I believe the vintage was 2009 on this. The smell of the beer was sweet, good amount of hops on the nose and some boozy aromas too. The taste of the beer is sweet with some fruity notes and more booze. The mouthfeel was smooth. Overall this beer was really quite nice."
""
""
"Had on tap in a 9 oz snifter at Capone's Black Friday event. Pours a brilliant ruby bronze color with no head. Nose is rich with vanilla and bourbon notes. The taste is also rife with alcohol, bourbon, vanilla, and grapes. The mouthfeel is thin and smooth. Very alcoholic, but outstanding. I love this stuff."
""
"Overall the most consistent barleywine out there. They year after year put out a quality Annv. beer that shows their ""Gratitude"" and what a beer they produce. I believe with 3 years in the cellar it matures wonderfully. I have yet to have any of their vintages that taste like its ""gone down hill"". Plus its one of the prettiest bottles ever made. Must seek out! The only other BW that beats this is Wooden Hell."

"Cheers!"
"I don't think East End Brewing could offer a more suitable beer to show their gratitude for their loyal customers. Every bit the effort and attention to detail that was put into the presentation was clearly also put into the beer. This is, for my money, one of the most bewitching barleywines out there and is a must-buy no matter the cost."
"Though the mouthfeel is a disappointment, this is still a really excellent barleywine. I'd actually love to try an older bottle, as I'd imagine this would only get better as the hops mellow out more. That said, the 2010 vintage is drinking quite well right now."
"Overall: Not the best barleywine I have ever had but it is damn good. This is my first time trying the beer so not sure if the no carbonation is standard with this one but that definitely played a part in the lower score"
"I feel like this barleywine quite didn't reach it's potential. Perhaps with better carbonation, the flavors could have shined more."
"Overall it's a real nice beer but not what I was expecting. I was expecting a little more depth in character for the limited 1500 bottle release. Also, Top 3 coolest bottles ever produced."
"Overall: Great barleywine. I'd love to compare to a fresh one but this is fantastic. Great lacing, great taste and nose. Overall a fantastic brew."
"O - Overall this was a pretty good beer. I just think it lost a little with this year. Perhaps this is when its in its delicious transition phase."
"D: This is my first time having this beer, however based on reviews I'd say another year would have been the time to open it. This would give a little more time for the hops to dissappear completely and to get more continuity from the fruit and malt. That being said, glad to finally land this one as it is a very enjoyable barleywine"
"O-- Brilliant! From packaging to the end this rocked. Reminded me a lot of some of the better desert wines available here and the flavor characters. Well hidden ABV, easy to drink and full of thick jammy flavors. Going to have to trade for more of this."
"Overall a very good barleywine and one that i'd seek out more often. Thanks to mulder1010 for opening this equivalent of beer porn. Lovely bottle, lovely contents a nice, warming, rich and flavoursome barleywine."
"overall - obviously it was quite a treat and a good beer. however, for what i imagine it would require to obtain, I'm not sure i'd go for it again."
"O: All three vintages of this brew are delicious. This beer seems to be the type that will bring out different flavors at different points of aging."
"I really can't thank Al enough for breaking out the '05 to '09 vertical at the event. It was wonderful to get to sample all the vintages that I otherwise would have never been able to try. Easily one off the best Barleywines I've ever sampled. In complete disclosure, the '05 was my favorite followed by '07. An outstanding series from East End."
"2009 -- 'goofy' stage, big time."
"Overall, a decent barleywine, but nothing crazy. I expected a little more after seeing all the high scores. Still enjoyable, however."
"Tastes are medicinal toffee, oaky tastes, toasted malt, smoke, booze, flaked barley, hops, dextrose, soy, an aged beer, amber malt, oranges and spice. Smell are booze, more booze, toasted barley, strong beer, oak, rye, steel, shirt zest, light fruits and pie. Definitely a sipper."
"O- Very smooth and tasty barley wine, complex with a lot of different tastes going on. Well balanced,I recommend this one for any barley wine lovers out there."
"D. Great. First Gratitude I've been able to try and I really like it."
"Pours a very dark brown with an orange tint. A good amount of head hugging the rim. Smooth and thick. Very rich and thick. A very nice malty spicy nose. Tastes smooth and malty. Sweet, rich, thick, and very spicy. I love the flavour profile. Can taste a touch of oxidized flavours but they sit nicely with the brew. Nice thick mouthfeel. Overall a very solid brew. I'm glad my first experience is a 3 year aged bottle."
"The appearance is a dark brown color with an off-white head. Its` smell has plums, caramel, some hops too, enticing overall. Gratitude tastes sweet with toffee, more plums, brown sugar, but also has malt and hops present. MF is full, rich, it is a one to enjoy over time. This is a very good barleywine from a relatively small scale brewery."
"Creamy, chewy full body with an excellent balance of leathery and sweet malt, booze, dark fruit and earthy hops. The mouthfeel of this beer is onenof the best I've encountered in the style. Slightly earthy with lots of sweet malt going off hints of caramel, toffee, hazelnut, rye and biscuit. There are some earthy hops balancing thing out especially in the finish whichns long, dry and slightly bitter. Very well balanced and extremely quaffable with faint hints of dark fruit, especially plum and raisin. The alcohol sweetness is there but it isn't hot at all and the high ABV is excellently masked making it deceptively drinkable. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability - an excellent sipper and a sincere toast of Gratitude to the guys of BCC who made my first trip th the Upper Gauley fantastic. Thanks to PaulMPap for hooking me up with a most memorable brew to put the finishing touch on a most memorable weekend."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. Honestly, I was a little bit let down by this bottle. After reading other reviews of various vintages, it seems that this is the most aggressively hopped version, so I'm hoping some time in the cellar will tame the hops and smooth out the alcohol on this. It's still fairly young for a barleywine of this magnitude, so I will be holding onto a few bottles of this to crack later. But if you have any of the 2010 laying around, I would recommend sitting on them for a few months at the least."
"O: Just an Amazing beer dedicated to a great guy and great Beer Advocate!!."
"Good barleywine. Nothing outstanding, i'll age one and see what happens."
"Pours a hazy amber to orange-ish color with a small off white head. In the aroma, dark fruit and a hint of licorice. In the taste, dark fruit, licorice, and a small caramel like presence. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry plum and caramel like aftertaste. Hides the alcohol with big dark fruit, with a nice caramel like stickiness."
"Overall: Very surprised at the vast differences between the vintages. While I was expecting some variation, each of these beers presented quite differently, much more so than expected."
"At this point it was rather the most disappointing of the 3 it had a bready yeast like quality to it still. I assume that it would probably improve with age. It had a regular barleywine like quality too it and I actually found it to have very little on spicing and complexity yet."
"Overall, and I speak for all three bottles here, this is a damn fine barleywine, something I can see wanting to enjoy again in the future. Very much so. Get some!"
"(side note) It would really be nice to see this barrel aged, the actual bourbon could really play off the sweet boozy taste on this one."
"This is a very good barleywine. It is always tough to live up to the hype but this is not overhopped for a one year old barleywine and is pretty well rounded and smooth. Medium mouthfeel and absolutely no carbonation. The carbonation that is there simply keeps it from tasting stale."
"Overall decent, not as great as I expected but still good. From what I hear the '09 version was much better, but this was def tasty just didn't live up to the hype IMO."
"O - Damn. I have had some of the newer vintages of gratitude before but the 05 and 06 are easily the best I have had. The 07 and 08 are well on there way as well but the original two are already there. One of the best barleywines I have had in quite some time, possibly even the best ever. Thanks again AL !!"
"A beer that I am happy to have saved for a special occasion. I hope I am able to get more of this beer in the future."
"Drinkability is quite good. I was expecting this to be overly hop forward like most American barleywines, but it's actually much closer to any an English barleywine, at least this vintage is. The nose isn't too bad. Not quite on par with some other barleywines, but the taste is an excellent mixture of light fruit and vanilla. The body is exceptional. I love the feel of this beer. Perfect for a barleywine. Also, the 11.5% ABV is masked quite well. This is definitely a top 5 barleywine for me and worth seeking out. I know I'll be looking for more. Nice work East End."
"Overall this is really making me want to invest in the vertical. Probably one of my favorites of the style."
"D: Entirely too drinkable, and enjoyable to drink. Good flavor and easy to sip, this barleywine is dangerous."
"Beers like Gratitude & MoaS are the reason Barleywines are my favorite style."
"This has aged very gracefully, and I could see this aging at least another 3 years. I am very happy I had the chance to get some of this."
"side note: they said the carbonation was due to the keg but during the end of the happy hour was shook up to reveal a nice half inch of foam on new fills. Too bad I didn't save this for my last offering since my only complaint was no carbonation (or head)"
"This is one I will have to re-visit again though and give another chance to see if our bottle was just under carbed."
"Zero signs of oxidation or drying up for that matter. If you like a sweeter, unhopped barleywine this ones for you. Too sweet for me and definately needs some hopping all the way through."
"D: This is a spectacular offering from East End. A heavy and full bodied beer that will age extremely well."
"Very, very nice, and I have to say this beer has held up very well over the years. I'm guessing this beer could easily go another 3 to 5 years without losing a thing. Impressive BW from East End, I must say."
"Skal!"
"Pours a golden copper, minimal beige head. Smells heavily of fruit and sweet malt; smelled like pears and flowers. Taste was very similar with a minimal citrus hint. I got a lot of rasins and pears from this, with some honey and rose. Carbonation was a little high but worked for me, mouthfeel was good and while thick, was still very drinkable."
"I really like this beer. I hope I get to try it again."
"Poured into a tulip. Dark amber and slightly hazy with a about a finger of off white head that retains nicely. Really nice smell on this one. Rich and fruity with a nice caramel finish that blends nicely with a raisin aroma. I'm pleasantly surprised that the alcohol is unnoticeable at 11.5%. The flavors are a lot like the nose. Full and fruity with a dominant raisin profile and a twinge of caramel sweetness to round it all out. The mouthfeel is great too! Silky on the tongue with just a bit of sharp carbonation to it. A little boozy on the pallet, but it's really just warm. Overall this one is stellar."
"2009 batch (blue) tasted January 2011. Pours a very clear garnet with a thin ring of head. Nose is heavy, sticky malt, some honey. Reminds me more of an old ale. Bright citrus and pine in the mouth, a nice sweet finish of orange candy. The citrus is a bit at odds here. I feel like the malt element of this batch wasn't quite as strong as some others were. The weakest vintage I've had."
"D - Extremely smooth...very nice. Definitely lived up to expectations. Great barleywine."
"Edit: I have since had an 06 and an 08 bottle of this beer and none were as good as the original review. I still like this beer a lot, but it's not a 4.5/4.5/5/5/4.5 to me anymore."
"This is a full bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation. It is very drinkable. The carbonation is a bit strange in this brew, it doesn't look all that carbonated but it has a little pop to the feel on the tongue. Up until recently I have only enjoyed the 2009 version which is what this review is base off of. I recently got to try a bottle from 2007 (care of ClockworkOrange) and wow is that even better. You should seek this one out."
"750ml waxed and papered bottle generously shared by Dave. 2010 vintage. Pours a honey amber with no head and a murky clarity. Nose suggests candied dark fruit (perhaps prunes). Taste follows nose with the addition of a slightly spicy character as well something vaguely metallic. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with a mild, even carbonation. This beer tastes quite good, even being quite young. I would relish the opportunity to try a bottle with a few years of age on it. It can only get better in my opinion."
"D: Definitely a sipper, and I can't imagine wanting another glass of this anytime soon. If there was an actual disappointment in the stellar lineup of beers I sampled on Friday, it was this - but what a glorious disappointment!"
" As barleywine is one of my favorite styles and this is an excellent representation of the genre, I found it most drinkable."
"Gratitude comes to me looking confrused because there is no head up above to protect the lucious liquid in the glass. There is a swirl of foam here and there but nothing that I can call a cap, or even a sparse cap, no lacing obviously. Smell is a bunch of fruit dipped in caramel. Apricots are up front with some plum, fig, and yes some alcohol. This is the 09' vintage by the way. Taste is superb but this loses something off the tap. A big malting causes for a big display of caramel. I did not pick up the werthers quality that I found in the bottle. Sweet caramel sided with apricot, plum, slight apple and cherry, figs, fruits, you know what it is. Yes, the alcohol pokes it's ugly head out but it does not distract from the beer, I think it boosts it's flavor profile some. The feel seems a bit thinner than out of the bottle, it's a big medium feel that is slick and leaves some fruit and alc. on the tounge afterwards. Carb is there but seems tame. All in all, I prefer my gratitude out the bottle, but it's no slouch off the tap as well. I drank my glass with ease. Thanks Matt and Bill for making this happen."
"Drinkability: The bit of booze this one shows and the small lack of body holds it back but this is a world class barley wine none the less."
"D- this is a special treat to see this on draft and oh boy did I enjoy it. That being said I do prefer the bottle version of this brew. I will say this its one of the finest bw in the world. At least to me."
"This is my first taste of vintage Gratitude and it did not dissapoint. I've heard from others that the 07 is in its prime, but this bottle seems to be showing signs of going downhill. If you're holding on to 07 Grat I would suggest drinking sooner rather than later. Really looking forward to the 2010 release."
"Muddy caramel color with a small tan head that quickly recedes to the walls of the glass. The mellow alcohol mixed with caramelized malt creates a ghostly whiskey aroma. Taste is almost similar to fresh high gravity wort but never cloyingly sweet. Rich dark fruits and caramel swim across your taste buds. Slightly bitter finish from whatever hops are left in this. Medium mouthfeel for an American Barleywine. Sweet, slightly bitter, and decadent."
"D: A slow sipper, this is ideal for sharing a few ways. I would enjoy having this again sometime. Good stuff."
"d - A very nice barleywine. I really liked the taste; it's a little sweet and fruity, but I thought it was great and not too sweet. Very easy to drink consdering the ABV, which is kind of dangerous. I have an 09 bottle and hope it's as smooth as the 07."
"Beer is medium bodied and mildly hot to start off. Its strong and forward with the sweetness of the whole thing. It finishes a little dry, a little drier than I would like. There is no bitterness to this beer at all. I guess its like an exaggerated big barleywine. All of the hallmark flavors are there but its wasn't the easiest thing for me to drink overall. I mostly enjoyed it though. I'd like to try the older vintages or after these have aged some more."
"Bottle: Poured a medium amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of toffee and caramel malt with sweet malt base is enjoyable enough for style. Taste is also dominated by medium sweet toffee notes with some caramel malt and a sweet finish. Body was about average for style with good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. I must admit that while this beer was satisfying it was definitely below my expectation - no dry fruit or interesting ester."
"I really enjoyed this brew. Big props to East End for constructing it, and for doing it in a way that pays homage to their customer base. Classy move with a classy beer."
"Top to bottom a superb beer."
"D - Quite drinkable. Not overly sweet like some barleywines. Very well balanced and a great sipper for wuite a while. Would love to see what some age does to this one."
"D- my half went faster than i was expecting and i was trying to savor it. this is something ill gladly trade for again. probably too strong to want an entire bottle to myself this time of year. this one has plenty of life left in it."
"Pours an amber-brown with off-white head. Lots of caramel and brown sugar, yet quite fruity. I've never tasted a barleywine quite like this, in a good way though. Still some noticible hops, but they aren't dominating anything. Quite smooth and very drinkable. One of the best barleywines I've had and I'm looking forward to trying future editions of this."
"Enjoyable, but the 06 and 07 vintages I tried prior to this one were quite a bit better. Maybe this just needs some age."
"D--Considering the rarity and high abv of this one, I guess I had a hard time giving this one a 5. However, I would have no problem sitting down on a cold winter night and polishing off a bottle by myself. This beer is outstanding and benefits from some cellar time I would guess."
"Overall? Very good beer. I'm not sure why this didn't hit my sweet spot, as it plainly did with so many others, but I'd never turn one of these down."
"The alcohol is very well hidden making this quite easy to drink, but definitely a sipper."
"The beer is medium bodied with a very low level of carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. This is a very good barleywine, but the carbonation was a bit too low for my taste and seemed to detract from the beer."
"Thanks Ken for sharing, and picking up from brewery."
"Overall I thought this beer was a little too much on the tart sweet side and I have tasted better barleywines."
"D: An excellent example of the style, but I admit I'm biased by a previous experience (having the 2007 at a tasting, with no expectations). That beer was absolutely stunning. This one isn't quite there yet, but I am confident it will age into the splendor of its older brother. The one major ding is price. The bottle is $18 or something like that. Come on."
" Poured a murky dark brown with marron highlights with a thin head that left good sticky lacing. Really big caramel malt aromas with brown sugar and molasses accemts but also had hints of booze and raisins. Caramel malts also dominate the flavor with molasses brown sugar and honey accents and noticable booze that does not want to be hidden. Medium body beer with a low amount of carbonation that had a sweet boozy slight hop bitter finish. I've had the ornage and green wax vintages and bot have been quite enjoyable and drinkable but are on the sweet side."
"D - Pretty drinkable, the bitterness helps and even though it has a high ABV it's not that bad."
"D- Was fairly easy to drink, but the sweetness was too much for my tastes."
"2010 Version Update (08/11/12) - I won't go into too much detail as this was very similar to past renditions, however I found this iteration's mouthfeel to be a bit subpar... A bit flat, a bit thin, without any of the rich and creamy texture that I recall from previous offerings... I have downgraded my mouthfeel rating back to a ""4" as a result..."
"This beer really fits into the category of an English Barleywine rather than American. It might be the way this beer is or it could be the fact that this bottle is about 6 months old and the hops have faded."
"Bottle number 968 of 1,500. 2009 vintage with blue wax with a blue jay on the paper label/wrap. This is my first East End beer and one that I have been looking forward to trying. The beer pours a brownish-amber color with a very small white head. The aroma is brown sugar and cherries with possibly some oak. The flavor is cherry, oak, caramel malt and alcohol. The flavor is semi-sweet. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"D: 4.0-Very similar to the 07, but it lost some aromas."
"D- This is a good beer, but I can't say it really sticks to my tastes, but it's good. Kind of a butterscotch beer."
"I had this 2009 version at dld. Medium brown light tan head not much to note in retention or lacing. The taste and aroma here are awesome, one of my favorite bw's ever. It starts off with sweet caramel and some really nice dark fruits and has a very nice balanced hoppy finish. Super tasty and easy to drink."
"J"
"D- This was a very drinkable beer to say the least. Everything I like about aged barleywines this had and then some. The smoothness on this beer couldn't have gotten any better. Looking forward to the others I have in the cellar right now!"
"Yellow wax, 2007 vintage on this bottle, which might I add looks lovely. Amongst the best packages in the beer world. Pours a dark red copper with an inch of dense creamy head that is equally dark as the beer. Aromas of toffee, raisin, peppery spice, and berries. Tastes of rich malts, toffee, berry, burnt caramel, and a big cookie finish. Feels full with a nice creamy restrained carbonation. I liked this one a fair amount, though I like the package even more than I like the beer. Good barleywine, though maybe suffering from overexposure."
"A restrained pinyness from the hops hits the palate first, followed by a vinously chewy caramel malt note and sweet toffees. Very fruity, almost candy-like in texture and flavor. Surprisingly light-bodied for the style, Gratitude is juicy & refreshing at the same time, unique for an American Barleywine in that respect. Gratitude is the operative word, here. Many thanks to Daniel for sharing this gem at our tasting."
"Drinkability: It's a rich, strong, but altogether inviting brew (at least with a couple years on it). Go get yourself some paper-wrapped goodness. I'll wait here."
"Drinks like a dream. So complex, definitely a tremendous beer to share with good friends. If you can get it, do. If you have it, drink it."
"2006 vintage. This poured a hazy copper with some light tan head. It smelled like peaches and cream, with candied pineapple and caramel and honey malts, and a bit of bready yeast and alcohol. It tasted like peaches and nectarines and creamy honey, with some mango and bready yeast, and a bit of copper hops and alcohol. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had an amazing scent and taste, with tons of fruity sweetness. It had great body too, and hid the alcohol decently. So it was pretty easy to drink, but much better to sip and savor. I haven't tried this fresh, but several years aged is fantastic, and it could still easily age longer. This is a top notch barleywine."
"Overall, a pretty good American barleywine. Easily one of my favorites for this particular style."
"Great flavor! An awesome barley wine, and age did this beer good! Like the aroma, notes of fruit, caramel, chocolate, toffee...possibly tobacco. A very sweet and grainy, smooth, warming(from the ABV), and chewy mouthfeel. Full bodied, and still very good carbonation. Now I don't have a fresh tasting to compare with this aged one, but I can only immagine that proper againg DID this beer justice! Great barley wine!"
"D: This is definitely a quality barleywine and I'm pleased to have tried a couple different vintages now (2007 and 2008), both fantastic."
"A very nice bottle to sit back and enjoy each sip. I know I did."
"D - Very drinkable for an English style barleywine. Overall a great brew. Thanks from all to Stigs!"
"If I lived in or near Pittsburgh, I would be at the '09 Gratitude release this weekend, $400 in hand to buy a 5-year stacked vertical of this magnificent brew. And as a recent law graduate in a down economy ... well, I think that's about the highest praise I can pay this brew."
"d: Absolutely one of the best beers I've tried, it makes me wish I was a better writer. Obviously packaged with care, and with good reason. This amazing beer deserves the special treatment."
"D- I feel as this is a poor example of this beer as I had the opportunity to have a battle of this brew w/ DoggNate back in the day...the only reason I remember is the paperwrapped bottle... luckily I remember enjoying it much more then...despite my harsh ratings...this is a good beer... just not here & today."
"This is simply a jewel of a beer. Thanks Stiggs!"
"Medium-plus on the body, a little sticky and resinous but not overly so. I like this one a lot. Drinkability is great for the style."
"Low-medium level of carbonation creates a very full, chewy mouthfeel. Gratitude is a VERY rich, heavy beer that shouldn't be tackled alone. 6-8oz pours by the fire on a winter evening with a few friends recanting stories is an ideal scenario. This beer ages wonderfully and I look forward to adding future vintages to my vertical."
"D: Not usually a fan of barleywines but this one impressed the heck outta me. A well balanced flavor profile that I enjoyed as it was a bit more laid back on the hops. Malt backbone is complemented well by a rich body that melds all the flavors together. A very respectable beer overall."
"I was happy for the chance to try this, but one glass was more than enough."
"D-the alcohol must have mellowed through the aging is it is extremely well hidden, huge tastes and nicely sweetened with an amazing mouthfeel make me want to keep drinking!"
"Excellent beer."
"Yellow wax - I believe that's 2007? Pours a beautiful hazy caramel without a ton of head, but plenty of lacing to let you know this is amply carbonated. Fantastic smell and taste - caramel, toffee, brown sugar, slight notes of aged hops. This is a very sweet, thick-bodied beer. A mammoth barleywine. A meal in a bottle. Big, rich, sweet, not too much hops - my kind of beverage. The high ABV and sweet, thick body will ding drinkability for some, but I think it's great, especially on a cold winter night."
"I don't give 5's put often, but goddamm. I've drank a lot of Barleywine, and it can't get much better than this. Praise Marty Moose- Holy Shit!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and oily with a small bite of carbonation."
"Drank fairly well, this failed to wow me as an ABW, not enough hops presence to satisfy me, still pretty good"
"M/D: I don't really know where else this beer can go, even with some age on it. The mouthfeel is sticky, resinous, and thick. The carbonation is low, and the alcohol content is imperceptible. I don't understand how much more this could possibly mellow, but I can say for sure that the one I am aging will be phenomenal."
"D: Big ABV and definitely a slow sipper. I like it a lot, though."
"D: Fairly drinkable, but a little much overall. A very good barleywine, and one I'll definitely seek out again."
"for the abv in barley wine land"
"D: Fairly good. A little to sweet for me to want to polish off a bottle by myself."
"This is a fantastic beer, definitely one of the best barleywines I've had. The brewery does not recommend drinking this fresh, so I am very curious to see what time will do to this bottle conditioned beauty....I guess I'm going to have to get more bottles!"
"Overall, I really liked this and hope to pick up another bottle and perhaps the '07 vintage as well before I head out of the Pennsylvania area. Highly recommended."
"Not too sure what I thought of it, actually. It is so sweet and complexit almost makes me think of a Belgian quad moreso than a barleywine, though maybe it's just the lingering effects of the sugar talking. Took a good few hours of zombie killing in Left 4 Dead to work through the bottle. The oxidation and hints of wet cardboard were a bit offputting."
"750 ml bottle with orange wax acquired in my first trade with hoppymeal over a year ago, 2006 vintage, bottle #583/1,300, shared at the Xmas in July last weekend with Carlos, Dyan, Chris, Shane, Scott, Eric, and a few others, poured into my Stone sampling glass, reviewed from notes on my phone, color is a dark red mixed with medium brown, one inch creamy light tan head that stands its ground, not much lacing, aroma consists of toffee, caramel, sweet malts, booze, dates, raisins, candied sugar, and pound cake, flavor starts off with caramel and sweetness from the very beginning, more rich malts in the middle with a slight bit of oxidization, spicy booze mixed with sweet dark fruits in the finish, served almost at room temperature so it did not have change much, sweet, boozy, and malty mouthfeel, full bodied, soft to moderate carbonation, taste lingers for a long time, smooth while being pretty sweet, high in alcohol and not all of it is hidden, but its drink well for its strength, even went down pretty easily outside on a hot summer day, quite good barleywine overall, this stuff seems to have aged wonderfully, had the 2007 with yellow wax and a different bird on the label a few weeks before but this vintage was superior, would drink again, recommended"
"D: 11.4%? No way! This drank smoother and easier than a beer 1/2 the strength. So sweet with tantilizing layers of fruit, melty caramel, dry spices, and subtle booziness. Incredible!"
"Drinkability: The bold flavors and the alcohol limit the drinkability a tad, particularly on the finish, although I suspect that some age will address this problem"
"All in all, the perfect beer for today. Rest in peace, my friend - I'm grateful that I knew you well enough to understand how much you'll be missed."
"D-Full bodied, smooth and rich. What's not to like?This is an excellent example of the style! A brew I look forward to getting every year."
"This bottle of East End Gratitude came courtesy of justn; thanks for the opportunity. I believe this is an 07 bottle (yellow wax) and it is number 914 out of 1500. It took me ten minutes to pry off the wax, but the reward was great. This is a staggeringly good looking Barleywine; deep cloudy burgundy color, with a creamy tan heading. Smell is not quite as impressive, but still notable; I get some dark fruit, brown sugar, alcohol and maybe some chocolate. Rum soaked raisins come to mind first in the flavor, with some brown bread and slight alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is slick on the palate, but not as chewy as one might expect. The ABV can be tasted and felt, but I think it adds a nice element to the whole package. As for drinkability, this bottle is draining pretty quickly, so I would say drinkability is top notch for a beer with this ABV. This was a very pleasurable drinking experience from East End. I will definitely have to try more of their stuff in the future. The hype for this beer is well deserved."
"Bottle at PPRBSG09. What a pretty bottle!! Pours a murky light brown with a tan head. Aroma of lots of sweet caramel malt. Flavor of sweet, sticky malt and butterscotch. Too heavy and sticky for me, ugh. Unfortunately, looks are deceiving in this case..."
"Beautiful."
"drink ability- very good. this one should only get better with age."
"Nice looking bottle. Pours a rusty amber with shades of woody brown. Thin tan head fades rather quickly. Nose ripe cherries and plums, caramel malt, sweet alcohols and floral hops. Taste is a sweet mixture of pitted fruits, bready malts and carmelized candy. Also a faint boozy presence. Big creamy body with silky smooth carbonation. Superbly balanced barleywine. Should age quite well."
"Cheers."
"This is a standout complex beer."
"Ruby orange body, long lasting foam that ebbs with a sticky lace. Super tropical fruity nose, all mango, papaya, apricot. Dominant sweet fruit flavors, rich and savory dried apricot and papaya again, backed by firm malty traces of melted caramel. Very clean and not overly yeasty/alcoholic as some bw's can be. Finishes so clean. Probably the best barleywine i've ever had, nice over the top fruit and easy drinking..."
"Poured into a tulip a very nice golden amber color, some carbonation, not much of a head or sticky lacing on this one, but some oil slicks or left behind. The nose is malty, some hops, spices, some dark fruits. The taste is very nice, sweet, malty, hoppy notes, figs/raisins/plums on the light side. Medium body, the ABV is hidden pretty well, so far, lol Very Drinkable, this is my first East End brew, and it is a very nice one, hopefully I will be able to try some other's, thanks Ben."
"Scott, buddy, you've done went and made another damn fine beer. Hopefully I'll have cash next time you hold an extravaganza and I can get a vertical set - assuming you'll ever do that again. Fortunately, I have an 05, 06, and another 07 in storage. But man, this is really, really good."
"D- I'm not big into barleywines but this is an experience that I had to review. The '06 I found to be by far the best of the 3 (wish I could have had some '05...would love to try that...I guess the bottle at Bocktown was a teaser). The '07 was still good...and the '08 has a long way to go. Like I mentioned before...not sure about the recipe changes...but this is one you should definitely let age for at least 1 year+ before cracking open. This gets a 3.9 overall because it is an average of the 3 years...as they taste now...combined. Both the 06 and 07 probably would have received higher scores...while the '08 would be around 3.35-3.6...ish (at its current state in the aging process...after this is all the same beer)."
"M/D - Chewy, thick, and full bodied as a beer can be. This is a really great beer that I want to try again!"
"This is definitely a great barleywine which leans more toward English than American. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a clear dark orange/red, very thick off white head forms, drops to a solid layer, tons of lace on the glass, very nice retention. Smell is nice, sweet and sugary, toffee, some pineapple, brown sugar, pine, butterscotch and oak, very rich, nice and malty. Taste is very rich, toasty up front, thick toffee, some brown sugar, gingerbread, some spicy alcohol, figs, an oaky/ash-like finish, slightly astringent. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation, super smooth, some warmth. Great barleywine as well, I found it better than the 06 but no where near the 05. Thanks a ton for these beers Jay!"
"D: very"
"Bottle 1244/1500. Clear coppery red with a fluffy beige cap. Lots of thick lace and great head retention. There was a little bit of citrusy hop aroma that combined well with the candy sugar and caramel notes. Some toffee, biscuit, and a bit of dark fruit, but not as much as the earlier vintages. Moderate bitterness with a lot of malt up front, caramel, sugar, and toasted malts. Orange notes and light alcohol mid-palate, along with raisins. Medium to full bodied with lowish carbonation and fine bubbles. Quite smooth with mild warmth. This one's good now, but seems like it should end up like the 2005 given enough time. I'll probably let my remaining bottles sit for a while."
"Edit: 2006 edition sampled end 2008. Who would have imagined that barleywines weren't meant to be aged?"
"drinkability is good. nice balance, decent depth, but it's hard to compete with the 2005. with time i think this one will get there though."
"Overall I thought this one was outstanding, one of the best aged barley wines I have had in a vey long time. I would have no issue with getting this one again, and the best part is I still have a couple more years to tackle on it now."
"This is a sipper to be sure. Good beer, great for this time of year. Thanks Shane."
"Great, thick and hearty example of an American barley wine - worth a try!"
"Burgundy colored beer with a super thick, densely creamy head that lasts really well. Some nice elements in the nose (a touch of smoke, apple, grapefruit,) but it's mostly very unpleasant, shows a lot of oxidation, dullness and even a light manure note. Flavor is very dull and oxidized, with cardboard notes and a light note of manure. Has a pleasant caramel-like sweetness with some fruit notes. Not crazy about aged American barley wines as I think they tend to oxidize too quickly and this is another example that validates my opinion. Not enjoyable, basically a drainpour."
"It has the most interesting bottle labeling approach I've ever seen. It appears to be shrink wrapped with brown paper like the bottle has a paper skin. Pours somewhat hazy deep copper with impressive tan head for the style. The aroma is bold and inviting with solid dark fruity esters of prunes, figs, dates and a layer of yum followed by near grainy malty sweetness. A big draw brings the expected bit of hotness to the nose. The taste starts sweet and malty with a mild pulse of pine hops. Way more malty sweet than bittering hops. The fruity esters soon surface and grow to midway and carry into the finish with notes of prunes, muted yet ripe cherries, sugar stewed raisins, figs and plums. Wow, very enjoyable. Some mild alcohol sits on the tongue into the after taste and provides a bit of warming."
"D - Delicious, but ugly in quantity, I would bet."
"Hey J.W. Lees and Thomas Hardy! Suck on this one!"
"I'd call this an english barleywine over american. I also liked this much more than last years version. If I could I'd buy a case and enjoy over the coming years. Well worth picking up if you get a chance."
"D- This is an excellent sipper. It was a little thick for me but the smell alone was absolutely mesmerizing."
"EDIT: I noticed I had one fewer rating and thus, Gratitude has been consolidated into one beer. This review is for the 2005, which is my favorite. Shiest!"
"Pretty drinkable considering the high ABV, this is a great barleywine."
"Overall, this is an excellent brew from East End, as usual. I was lucky enough to grab a few of these and will age the rest!"
"Wonderful Barleywine!"
"Drinkability is very good. This is an exceptional beer that could probably sit a few more years in the cellar."
"Pours a very intrigueing dirty ruby red brown. Good off white head leaves minute lacing. Quite viscous on the pour. Smell is mostly a nice balance of hops and heavy malt sugars. An akward slight rubbery tire flavor in the nose, but nothing that turns me off too much. Taste follows. Not as hoppy as one would expect for an american style barleywine, but still has a very noticeable hop presence. Malts are very active here, and there is a unique barrage of different malt flavors. quite sugary, but not too cloying. mouthfeel is on the thin side, but not too thin to be out of the barleywine realm, just on the thinner side of the fence. Drinkability is quite scary for something weighing in at a hefty 11.4%. Overall a very enjoyable american style barleywine. Cant wait to see how the bottles in the cellar are in a year or two. A recommended purchase, although the price is a bit daunting at around $20. Good beer, as always from Scott and the East End Folks."
"D - This is a sipper for sure. Very complex brew with a mild sweetness that doesn't detract from the overall drinkability."
"Poured a ruby red color with a three finger thick head that left some heavy sticky lacing. Smelled of pine and citrus with some fruity esters. Tasted of sweet malt with prune and grape flavors coming through. A hint of citrus and pine flavors. The hop presence wasn't huge but thats what I like. I think its mellowed a little. There is a great complexity with this barleywine. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied but is pretty much what I look for. It was silky and a little creamy. It went down smooth and the alcohol wasn't very present at all. Overall this is an amazing brew and I can't wait until they bottle 2007."
"Pours a hazy dark copper, rusty color with a decent bit of sediment and a good sized butter cream colored head that laces nicely on the glass as it slowly recedes. Aroma is a clean soapy perfuminess on top of a berry and pruny sweet maltiness. Some citrusy hops and sugary caramel in the aroma as well. Taste is similar with a clean soapy perfume and a nice mellowed citrusy hop flavor upfront, accentuated by the sweet malts, caramel sugariness and prunes from mid taste into the finish. Alcohol and bitterness are balanced and mellow but slightly evident in the finish. Just a hint of fresh green hoppiness as well, a little like chewing on a cone. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, creamy soft carbonation blends well with the slightly sugary body, both of which are balanced by a little hoppy dryness and an alcohol warmth in the finish. A very nice barleywine that got better and better as it warmed. Glad i have another to age a little, loof forward to more from this brewery. Thanks to Richard and Steve for the opportunity."
"Picked up one of the last few bottles left a few weeks ago and opened it today. It has a great thick, cloudy dark amber color with great head and nice lacing. It has a wonderful malty scent, like a scotch ale plus. It has a great full, smoky, malty flavor, with great barley flavors and a full-bodied taste. It goes down great, this is a wonderful barley wine. I can't wait to see how Scott does with the 2007 batch."
"Scott at East End treats this as something special ... and it is. I'll be snagging a couple bottles of the 2007 version and stashing at least one for 12/31/08. I can't think of a better way to start a new year."
"It poured up a nice medium copper with really creamy tan colored head that provided a lot of stickage. Aromas included a hefty dosage of Maris Otter or some 2-row, plum skins, faint mineral notes and tropical fruits like kiwi and papaya, and a decent hopping level. Tasting revealed a pleasant scorched malt taste with a light smoky feel to it. Some esters of peach and bubblegum mixed ito the malt sweetness. Some significant fusel acohols going on, Finish is lightly bitter and astringent. The only drawback is the off-presence of a slight medicinal, burnt rubber sort of taste, kind of plastic-like. Mouthfeel was really good, thick without being syrupy, and the carbonation was spot-on with a subtle presence. Overall, a pretty nice barleywine that I wish I could have sat on for a while longer."
"Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Thick with some cloying,yet still has a somewhat light feel. Goes down nice,but a definate sipper. Amazing beer wish I had more of this beer stashed away."
"	Drinkability easy to hoard and drink in a dark room by yourself or share with family and friends at a party. Even if the crowd may not understand Barleywines like most of us on this site, I guarantee if you offer a few samples of this brew around the room that you will open some palates up to new experiences possibly peak enough interest to pass on the craft beer revolution. Complexity with stunning adhesiveness breeds excellence in this style of beer, so far since 2005 Gratitude East End has nailed just that. Signed by Scott bottle number 1093/1300 here goes a big cheers right back at ya my friend."
"Cheers!"
"The beer is now pouring slighly hazy w/a beautifull copper color. The aroma has opened up from what I remember. A bit more hops. The falvors are still sweet but much more in harmony with the hops. Nice American BW taste, the sweetness that makes it a BW and a nice the hop punch finish."
"D - One year has been perfect to this excellent beer. Large, complex, balanced flavor. I cant wait for the 06."
