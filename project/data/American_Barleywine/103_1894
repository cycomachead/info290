3.83,-2,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This beer is good but in my opinion needs some work. The malt character is there but the hops are a bit strange or unbalanced.

3.53,-9.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"22oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours a caramel hue with a semi-hazy clarity and a half inch, loose, cream-colored head that eventually disperses into a creamy slick. Some lacing, but no adhesion. Nose expresses prunes, a slightly vinous character, toasted malt and a trace of wet cardboard. Taste consistent with nose; however, a bit more subdued. There's also a light earthy hoppiness and some ethanol; however, things are a bit muddled by the carbonation levels - it definitely needs a swirl to open it up. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an overly assertive carbonation level and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a fairly mediocre example of the style. Not something I need to revisit again anytime soon.","Jwale73","Dec 05, 2012"
3.21,-17.9,4.5,3.5,3,3,3,"O- The high ABV is hidden very well on this one. It is very smooth and easy to drink the first half. But the second was much harder because of the bitterness. It was actually hard to finish. Not a beer I would visit again in it's current state of maturity. Perhaps a year or two in the cellar to bypass the adolescent wildness that this brew has created, will do some good for it. I do enjoy a good IPA, double IPA, etc. but I don't want my barley-wine to be this bitter. I think some extra belgian candy sugar or something would have helped to balance this out. Or, maybe this is just too young for my preference. Maybe I will pick up another bottle to put away for some time...","mitch3114","Nov 24, 2012"

The aroma is modest in strength with malts, some floral hops, pine and some tree sap. The taste is pretty smooth with pine hop resin, some spicy hops and a bit of floral hops too. Toward midway spicy hops, earthiness and a touch of roast come forward to create a near black tea like sensation. I enjoy the way this one comes together.

Smell is thick and sweet, like pez candy and honey. Taste is a great mix of candy sweetness, mixed citrus notes fronted by orange rind, biscuit, some boozy notes, pine, florals, hints of caramel. Bitter sweet, very tasty. Makes me think of lemoncello liquor. Tropical fruits, mango and coconut, come out as it breathes. Finish is fairly long and resiny. Still tasting pine several minutes later.

There is some sort of ""staleness"" lurking back there. Can't really tell what it is but its there. I think it might be a touch to cold. The first couple of sips reveal some nice malty sweetness, and a good dose of piney bitter hops. I think its a nice balance between the two. I'm getting quite a bit of diactyl, almost sort of buttery. It's slightly off putting. Also a nice touch of alcohol. I think the carbonation level is spot on and it has a slightly creamy feel.

This almost feels like it falls into DIPA territory. For a couple of years on it, it's a nice surprise and lets me know it could take a few more fine.

Big hops on the scent, and I thought, this is going to be quite bitter. But to the contrary, while the hops were present, they took a backdoor to the fruity sweetness, augmenting the malt bomb. I could taste their effects, but they were super smooth, and the result was very drinkable. Almost like Mirror Mirror's little brother, from the sample of that I had before.

3.21,-17.9,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"22 oz. bomber with no freshness date. The beer has a lightly-carbonated amber body, topped with a loose, two finger head that leaves bits of lace. On the nose, my first impression is Cascade and Simcoe with some crystal malts. Later this evolves into tropical and citrus fruits and perhaps some berries; it is nice and aromatic, but consists mostly of hops and various alcohol notes. Big floral/leafy hop presence on the palate, with chewy malts, fruity esters, rosy alcohol, and lots of citric bitterness. Eventually the hops ebb and make way for lots of sweet crystal malts and a pleasant, warming sensation. The body is chewy, lightly-numbing, and gets dryer the more I drink. This is definitely a brew that will improve with age, but as is, it's not a great one. Not bad by any means, it's just the fruity alcohols and esters haven't melded completely with the big hoppiness and chewy sweetness. I'd like to try this one at two or three years of age.","mmmbeer","Feb 23, 2009"

It has a fine tingly carbonation that forces a slow flow down the old gullet. Very tangy. It has a somewhat oily consistency yet it also has a certain lightness for a barleywine.

I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to see such a wide range of beers - even when the style is similar. I still think that the hop profile seems a bit on the amateur side, here. I'm not trying to be harsh - I'm trying to say that work could be done on giving this a more even feel and taste in the mouth. The flavor (hops aside) and mouthfeel are spot on - just need to work on the hops.

4.34,11,4,5,4.5,5,3,"Got this freshly tapped cask ale on its first day out at Mahar's. Came with a big, fluffy, domed head that lasted for quite a while. Light copperey orange color and hazy. Aroma had big notes of floral and citrusy hops along with some sweet malt in the background and a boozy presence. This beer's strength is really detectable in the nose, and it is a great, complex aroma. Taste is very powerful - don't plan on being able to taste any additional beers after you've had this one. There is a substantial cirtus hop bang to start off, followed by an interestingly unique toffey-like malt flavor that I haven't ever experienced before. The finish has a nice bitterness, but I think this is somewhat toned down by the alcoholic strength of the beer. The mouthfeel on this ale was great, and I think the mouthfeel of just about any beer is enhanced by cask conditioning. It was served at an appropriate temperature for cask, and had a nice, subtle carbonation that did not steal any attention away from the great flavors of this beer. It had a nice thick feel on the tongue. Drinkability is not a shining characteristic of this beer. This is definately not meant for consumption in high volumes unless you want to inflict some pain on yourself. This would make a good after diner drink or night cap.

The herbal hops were still amazingly evident, but the primary aroma was that of sweet malts, reminding me of a fruit cocktail from a can. The taste was also sweet, but not at all cloying. The individual fruit flavors were hard to pick out now, and the hops added a spicy edge. Alcohol was more evident than beers of this age, but not in a hot flashy way. This was quite a bit easier to drink than I remember from couple of years ago.

The caramel and fruit flavors rock. The alcohol isn't quite as attacking as I would have expected, you can feel it but not taste it. Nice warmth though.

More of that fruit, and a creamy butter that starts to be a little unpleasant just as the hops kick it out and leave a pretty dry finish. The bitterness of the hops does away with the butter just before it becomes obtrusive. Mouthfeel is creamy from the butter, prickly from the hops, and full from the malt.

The flavor is very tangy, almost like grapefruit with a little malt behind it. The hops dont do much to the flavor and stand out a bit awkwardly. Its a bit different, but not entirely un-enjoyable. The mouth feel is thick with very light carbonation. Over all, Id say this beer is a tasty sipper that goes down smooth but its a barley wine.

There is also some bready malt there. In the taste, the berries really come out. This is the first non-fruit beer I've ever had that had such a pronounced berry taste. The sweetness of the berries and malt is balanced out by an extreme prickly dryness which dominates the finish. Alcohol is also slightly noticeable but in a good way. Mouthfeel is very nice as well, but it could maybe use a bit more body. This sample is much better than the one I had a few months ago, so it appears that age has done it well.

The flavour is dominated by a combination of caramel maltiness, alcohol, and bitterness, with lower levels of fruit and hop character. The alcohol was a little on the coarse side, especially towards the finish. However, this mellowed somewhat as it warmed up and the fruit flavour became more pronounced, resulting in a better balance. Slightly grainy and viscous texture, decent body with lower carbonation. I found this one to be more English-like in character, with hops taking more of a backseat to malt. Not super complex, but it doesn't need to be.

Oaky malt, rhubarb, and some salty pine essence on nose with a Sherwin Williams paint fining. Kind of an airy flavor, not syrupy like many barleywines, and there is some kind of berry in there that is unusual; I know the alcohol is in there, but the malt is so understated, again, for the style, that it is dangerously drinkable.

Flavor is generally sweet with toffee and brown sugar up front which rolls to a slightly bitter finish that I attribute to alcohol not hops.

Feels like a lot going on in the mouth, it's sweet up front, the malt really doing it's job. There's a taste of alcohol that kicks in next, but it's smooth and warm. There's a smokey finish that is interesting, I really like it. Not too hoppy, but the hops are present and balance the malt nicely, with a slightly bitter bite at the end.

No offensiveness, no harshness. All sweet hop. The feel is nice and thick, bordering on slightly syrupy. Very coating over the tongue. Shit. I just checked the ABV and it says 9.5.

The taste is also very, very complex. I taste a sweet, juicy blast of fruit flavors up front, with a deep caramel malt backbone that also shows hints of toffee. The finish is juicy, with fresh green hops stealing the show. The mouthfeel is thick, coating and perfect, and the finish is very warming and decadent.

4.02,2.8,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Very enjoyable, definitely a hop focus but not as much as others I've had. I have 4 more and am anxious to see if some of the rough edges can be smoothed out. Good nonetheless.","Southernbrew","Aug 21, 2004"
4.17,6.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Great big hops on the tongue. Various hops flavors: bitingly bitter, floral and citrusy. Rich malt with a hint of alcohool bite. Lightly nutty. Full bodied and chewy with a pleasantly bitter hops aftertaste. A pleasant surprise, this one. Could stand to be aged a bit for sure but very tasty and drinkable now. A fine barleywine.","ViveLaChouffe","Aug 20, 2004"
3.8,-2.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a delicious tawny red color with an off-white head that falls to a thick Belgian lace. The aroma is alcohol, honey, caramel, grassy hops, plums, and apples. The taste leads with a calm before the storm as the flavors debate who should go first before they all bumrush your palate. It's an onslaught, but nothing particularly amazing to me. Alcohol is over the top, malts are subdued, hops are walking around all addlebrained. Unbalanced, in a word. I'm going to hang on to the rest of this pack for a couple months and see what happens. Mouthfeel is sharp and biting due to carbonation and alcohol, with a very dry finish. Decent to drink, and better than others I've had, but nothing to write home to at this point.","jlervine","Aug 19, 2004"
3.95,1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Druid Fluid just love the name it was the reason for picking this brew off the shelf then I saw it was a barley wine and had to have it. Amber brew with nice head that falls to thumbnail sized creamy cap feed by constant stream of rising bubbles. Leaves a light lacing on my glass. Aroma is fruity malt with a light hop aroma. Tatse is malt, toffee, fruity and hoppy. More mellow then other barley wines nothing really comes to surface as dominating just a fruity malty brew with hint of toffee and a good dose of the old hop. Taste is good but not extraordinary. Mouthfeel is good little light for the style in my humble opinion. Drinkability is good no real alcohol taste just nice warming of the insides.","mntlover","Aug 16, 2004"

4.07,4.1,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Appearance: dark brown apricot color, murky, with a little bit of head whihc recedes very quickly. Lace is not very sticky. Smell has a lot of toasted rye and wheat, with a spicy sweet chocolate smell and an charred earthy ester behind. Malt backbone is there too, with a tiny hint of hops. When you taste this beer, it almost takes you aback. The taste is very sharp up front, with a raw unmellowed hop flavor and a spiced citrus hint, with the butter from the ringwood yeast definately evident. I wasnt bothered by the aftertaste, which was pleasantly bitter and spicy, but my compatriots mostly noted that it was too metalic and bitter. Medium body and a blast of sharp carbonation give this a great mouthfeel. This beer definately needs to be aged a few years, to let the flavors tune down and mellow.","FranklinPCombs","May 17, 2004"
4.29,9.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, consumed slightly below room temp. nice foil around the cap. adds a touch of class. Pours orangey amber, moderate head/carbonation, tiny bubble film and leaves moderate lacing. Vinious, musty nose, hints of varnish. Very dry barley wine, notes of paint remover, melon, brandy, honey, biscuits (can you say complex?) very resiny hops. Grapefruit notes. Strong stuff, probably would age nicely. I'll never know, I like this stuff too much. Interesting BW, worth checking out if you enjoy this style. alot going on in this one.","Billolick","May 12, 2004"
4.35,11.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A tasty and interesting barleywine. Very English in nature in that it is malty but well balanced, but throws just a hint of Americanization in the fruitiness and sweetness. Murky tan body that leaves little lacing on top. Burnt malts start and end this brew, with a sticky hop flavor and a lot of citrus and lemon flavors that are easily detectable in the aftertaste too. Nose is both sweet and toasty with notes of lemon juice. Mouthfeel is more creamy than smacking with hops, as fits with the more English style. A great drinker, the higher ABV barely noticeable. One I wish I bought many more of, both to drink now and to age, as I think this would get quite interesting with time. Seek this one out.","IrishRedRock","May 05, 2004"

4.23,8.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A big, thick, cream-colored dense head collapses to a bumpy, rocky creamscape. Thick, psycho, lacy lacing. A foggy, orange/brown beer tries to hide some pinkishness. The nose is sweet, cream, fruity caramel. There is alcohol and some ink. A sweet caramel front shows lots of hops. A thick, syrupy middle, full of fruit. But it's not too sweet. Nice. The finish dries, but is still fruity fresh. Apples. And it's quite hoppy bitter. Some ink survives. What a nice, light, fruity, hoppy barley wine. It's fairly sweet, but that's nicely offset by big, tart, citrus hoppiness.","kbub6f","Mar 20, 2004"

Smooth buttery flavor up front, but the alcohol is the overpowering taste here. Wish additional malt or something would temper the ethanol a bit, but that just doesn't seem to be happening today. Still, for a barleywine, that sort of trait has to be somewhat expected. Another worthy brew from Middle Ages, just wish they were a little more available outside of the region.","ppoitras","Feb 28, 2004"
4.32,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Appearance: Semi-clouded copper hue with an off white cream colored head leaves fine specks of lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma: Great English style malts here blended with an edge of pine cone and orange peel thrown in for good measures, the nose is very peculiar but the creamy edge and citrus profile brings it together. Taste: Very sweet creaminess in the flavor some candi sugar is here creating alot of sweetness, but at the same time there's a load of hopes here fighting it out for the balance of sweet and bitterness. Who will prevail, well I'm not sorry to say that a draw was found due to the pure awesome mix that each caramel sugary malts and pine cone orange citrus hops add here to the complexity. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied mild carbonation goes down without any cloying edges. Drinkability: Beware of the alcohol goes down quite smoothly here.","WVbeergeek","Feb 23, 2004"
3.93,0.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a burnt-copper color with a fantastic, lace-producing head. The aroma is a wildly complex mix of ripe fruits and floral hops. My first smell made me think of a well hopped American-Style Barleywine, but as your nose settles into the beer, sweet malts and fruits come popping out.Id like to have one after its aged for a couple of years. Apricot, Cherry, Plumsesters and alcohol. The taste is less complex than the aroma: grainy, malty, softness and alcohol. A little butterscotch, but nothing too serious. Finish is a slightly bitter. This is a solidly good barleywine. It falls short of the best beers of the style, but it is quite drinkable and very enjoyable.perfect for a cold January night.","Suds","Jan 25, 2004"

Nose is complex, some of your typical barley wine aromas, big malt, hops and alcohol (a bit masked in this one). But yet perfumy (that's where the hops are), fruity and estery at the same time. Taste is a bit subdued, not as aggressive as other barley wines I've had. But that's good. It's fruitiness is kept to an appreciative threshhold. Very tasty.

4.75,21.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I also had the pleasure of this mighty brew on cask at the toad. Aged 2 years this had really come into its own. Not as raw as the bottle fresh version. Poured a hazy mahogony color with a little bit of white head. Smell was great with huge esters seeping down my nostrils and tickling my throat along with a serious bit of piney hops to balance out the huge malted notes. Taste was like drinking carbonated molassas. It was so tasty with huge rolling waves of caramel and molassas sweetness morphing into pure brown sugar coupled with a more subdued hop taste and huge notes of alcohol. This was a rare treat and perfect for the gathering.","GreatPondBrewer","Dec 06, 2003"

4.15,6.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The flavor delivers more fruit and less hop flavor than the aroma suggests. It starts with the big juicy fruit that the aroma exhibits (apple, apricot, plum, cherry, almost pineapple but not so sour); followed by some soft, buttery caramel and mineral character as it warms; and finishes with leafy/piney hop flavors, a bold bitterness, some dry, woody characater, and a touch of mildly peppery alcohol. The aftertaste is a long and winding road where the different flavors previously encountered reappear again and again at different points. Most complex, and quite enjoyable - and the Ringwood yeast really stands out here!","NeroFiddled","Jul 31, 2003"
3.97,1.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A very unique barleywine from Syracuse, NY. You're greeted with a dark amber brew with smallish tan head. Candy sugar with some raisin/prune aromas mingle with earthy hops, butterscotch, and Belgian mustiness. The flavors lean toward fresh earthy hops with some sweet sugary malt and finishes with a strong bitterness. It has a medium body holding the complex hop flavors, now I've got it, the hops have a minty, herbal quality that was hard to pin down, and fruity flavors like apples and peaches, an interesting route to follow for a barleywine.","jeffboo","Jul 09, 2003"
4.15,6.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber color with a nice head that remains and laces. The aroma is of fruity Ringwood yeast, hops, and multiple malts. The taste is extremely smooth with a little warming, but overall good balance between hops and malts. The body is medium. It's not at all hard to swallow like some barley wines. The beer is very drinkable. An excellant choice, but not as good as Bigfoot Barley Wine.","WesWes","Jul 05, 2003"
