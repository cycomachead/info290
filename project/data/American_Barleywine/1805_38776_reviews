"Little bit of sediment floating around. Pours  doo doo brown in color. Taste is fantastic! Malty and lots of barley character. First beer I had in Vermont on my vacation last week."

"Mouthfeel is a little thin and water, as is sometimes the case with barleywines. Overall, pretty good, but not great."

"A very dark barleywine, with great lacing. Aromas of sweet treacle and a lot of hops come through on this adding resiny citrus and pine notes. A satisfying sipping barleywine, with a really great complex array of bready malt notes, coffee, a subtle sweetness matched by a serious hop contribution. Very nice, and would recommend it for sure. A rich satisfying brew."

"This is one of those beers where it gets a high score, but to the everyday beer drinker in America it tastes like the inside of a perfume bottle. It's pretty rough on the taste buds. I also got a migraine headache after drinking this one. Maybe the hops in it were a bit much for me to handle? Seemingly so. But there obviously are people that enjoy this beer. Enjoy, but I think I'll move on and drink the Grado Plato Chocarrubica instead."

"I really liked it. Layers of malt flavors accented by some dynamic hops. This one is dramatic but in way that's a bit slow. it unfolds and you realize it as it does. Then you think on it a bit and it makes you smile because it's forceful and it doesn't seem so."

"Thats the key to this beer. I know Barleywines typically age well, and that holds true with this beer. But the awesome dry-hop this beer gets is too awesome to let go to waste. I love this beer no matter what age, but if its super fresh (3 months or less), it rivals among my favorites. My review lies with these conditions in mind."
""
"Finishes clean, medium to heavy body carries the stiff biterness but doesn't linger too long in the aftertaste. Hop bitterness sticks with each sip and hangs around briefly at the end keeping the drinkability up a bit. Aggressive bitterness doesn't make this a slow sipper as much as it braces your taste buds to handle the heavy malt punch without flinching."

"This truly is a monster of a beer. The cloudy brown look is a bit intimidating, and the aroma of hops and darker malts almost makes me almost afraid to drink it, as if Champ would likely jump out of the glass and chase me. The taste was just mind-blowingly potent. Full of hops with their acidity balancing the malts, taming the beast. Try tackling this monster, if you dare."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark caramel-amber coloring with a frothy, foamy, cream colored head that settles into a retaining surface coat. Nose of cedar and pine tassels, rich and resiny hops, and toffee sweetness. Flavors are rich and robust, with a decent balance throughout. Hoppy forward, with citrus and tropical fruit notes on a toffee rich backbone. Notes of booze highlight, as well as some earthy tones. The aftertaste is peppery, bitter, and toffee sweet. Well balanced. Bittersweet, slightly drying finish. Heavy brew."

"O: This beer masks its alcohol very well from the taste and is also rather drinkable for the style because it's packed with lots of hop bitterness that prevent this from being too malty or sweet."
""
"O- Not my favorite Barleywine, but this is pretty tasty. Its not overly complex but I think what it does, it does well. I have a feeling that in a flight with other Barleywines this would come up a little short on complexity, but would score high on drinkability. Its worth a taste."

"Most everything going on is something I like in beer but they are not exactly befitting the style. I'd like to try this fresh or aged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this isnt a bad beer. Truthfully I think its the only Rock Art beer (aside from Black Moon IPA) that I actually like and would drink again."
""
"Overall, a pretty nice beer. Fits more on the British side of barleywines to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body, light carbonation. A lot of stickiness from the hop oils, which is somewhat surprising given the lack of freshness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a decent beer, however it's not top tier stuff. This is a bit amateurish."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid Barleywine to drink for as long as you can handle it."
"O- Not a bad exhibition of a beastly brew but I really wanted some more character"
""
""
"Overall it's an interesting take on a barleywine and extremely hop forward so if that's your thing you'll probably like it, but where is the malt presence and depth on this? I am not into sugar rushes, but even I would want a little bit of sweetness and caramel on this compared to most barleywines."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad brew, I'm glad I bought this one to try once, it was enjoyable. Probably won't buy it again though."
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and some fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with a sweet flavor and a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but I think it smells better than it tastes."
"O. Overall a great beer that is very easy drinking considering its 100 IBU's and 10% ABV. Worth seeking out."
""
""
"I really like the Veromonster; not sure why the aroma was such a let down. Otherwise a great barleywine. I wish I had another I could cellar for a while."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought this was a very solid barleywine, and one that I would come back to frequently if it was more easily available. My biggest complaint is that I can't find a bottling date or a ""drink by"" on the bottle anywhere. I didn't perceive this one to be anywhere close to the 100 IBU claimed on the label, so I'm suspicious that the bottle may have some age on it and the hops have faded. Whatever the situation, it was very good, but I would be interested to compare to a bottle that I knew to be fresh."
""
"Poured into a 16 oz snifter, bottle date looks like the 273 day of 2011. Pours a orange red with a huge 3 inch head off white with loads sticky lace. Smell is big carmel, fruity esters, pine, grapefruit, and biscuit. Taste is larger, but amazingly balanced. Body is medium large, plenty of carbonation, less dry than you expect from this style, and excellent drinkability for its size. This is very impressive, a fan for sure."
""
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on June 11, 2012. It pours an amber, copper tone with a tremendous beige head that lasts and lasts. The colors are seen through a bit of a haze. Aromatic for sure with a fabulous collection of sweet caramel malts, wild berries, earthy/piney hops, and just a touch of yeast to meld everything together. Topnotch on the nose. The body is medium to bold but overall smooth. The hops are upfront on the taste with a sweetness taking a slight back seat but never disappearing.I had this one fairly fresh and I like to let Barleywines sit for a bit before consuming. This was incredibly easy to drink and totally enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, but not great either."
"The body is medium with sharp carbonation. Overall this one is solid. The aroma puts me off a little bit but I'll enjoy it enough this time."
""
""
"O: I really can't say too much because this is my first barleywine. Its got the hops characteristics of an IPA, yet some of the malts of a strong ale. I would have this again and would like to explore the barleywine style a bit more to see how others compare to Rock Art's."
"O: I thought this was an IPA, but turns out it's a Barleywine. Probably my least favorite I've ever tried. It's just very strange and not well put together."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is, indeed, a monster. It is a bit drier of a beer, and the hop profile has added a unique bitterness to the beer set up against a roasty and sweet malt bill. I'm not sure of the water that is used in this beer, but there is certainly something unique added by it--something that gives this hefty ale a neat, interesting character."
""
"I like this enough that i would drink it again, falls a bit below average, but is worth drinking when you just want to open something on any occasion."
""
""
""
"Overall: A good barley wine, I would certainly drink it again. Might be nice to age one and see what happens to the spice."
""
""
"If you haven't had the Vermonster yet and you are happy, it is because you have never truly lived."
""
"O: A very solid American Barleywine that pushes the limits and enjoys being extreme. If you enjoy hoppy barleywines, look no further. Very nice price point, too, and always available (at least in this area)"
"Big bodied, smooth with a nice bubbly tingle in the finish. Just an all-around great beer!"
""
"overall , a solid barleywine, and reasonably priced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a huge miss for me. The drinkability is low because of the alcohol and brash, overdone bitterness, leaving this one a slow, grumpy sipper. Little malt depth, hop character, and just tons of coarse bitterness and booze. Not my cup of tea."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – One of the more drinkable barleywines straight off the shelf, especially at 10%."
"Had this beer after a long day at work - and it hit the spot perfectly. For 10%, an absolutely tasty brew, no taste or hint of high ABV at all. Leaves a beautiful film on the glass. A great winter brew - will enjoy more once we get some more snow... Shout out to FrankLloydMike for buying as a house, er, apartment warming gift. Perhaps I will more intently review this beer sometime when I haven't already had a glass of it..."
"O – At 10%ABV the alcohol balanced well with the malt. Nothing exciting about this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my first barleywine, so I'm not very accustomed to the style. It's not bad, I really like the 100ibu bitterness. But it lacks depth and character to me. I'm kind of disappointed, the guy at the brew shop talked this one up. Maybe this is an excellent barleywine, I'm not sure. I will definitely try more barleywines in the futures to compare."
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm glad I got past the terrible bottle art and gave this try (Also 5.99 for a 10% abv bomber) amazing!"
""
""
""
""
""
"It is interesting to me that a 100 IBU ale can be slightly malt centric. Full disclosure, I am a West Coast DIPA fan (Stone Ruination sets the standard for me), so I am a hophead for sure. Nonetheless, this is a solid, respectful ale from a stellar East Coast brewer. Rock on, Rock Art!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another solid part of the Rock Art lineup that can stand up to most Barleywines."
"Very nice, skews malty, but in my wheel house, yum"
"D: Thank you Vermonster, may I have another. Actually, another would put me under the table with this bews amazingly camouflaged 10% abv. Very robust and flavorful. Nice toasty and very rich malts with incredibly resinous and complex hops. The heft does slow you down with works well for all the character this one has. For the price (in VT) this is superb."
"I really wanted to like this more, but it's way too dry for my taste. Too harshly bitter and unbalanced. The surely prodigious malty body just isn't sturdy enough to compete."
"Overall – Not my favorite barleywine by a long shot, but again, am glad I was able to try this. Somewhat one dimensional to me. Way too sweet."
"Loved It. Go 'Lers"
"A decent barleywine, but ultimately fairly typical. I can tell this has a little age on it, but perhaps not enough age. It could have been in that awkward phase barlewine geeks so often talk about. Enjoyable nonetheless, even though I prefer less bitterness in my barleywines."
"DELICIOUS, PICK THIS ONE UP!"
"O - Not really a fan of this one. Big on booze, sweetness, and hops with no real balance. Just a monster of a beer that I can't get through. Average, at best. Pass."
"A little sweet but overall not bad, especially for the price. Should I see this again, yes, probably, yes."
"O: Good barleywine that I will be picking up again when in Vt. especially when offered at such a fair price (~$5). Quite an easy-drinking barleywine for a style which I usually find myself struggling to finish."
"M- Surprisingly smooth for how big this beer is. Obviously there’s an imbalance in hops and malt, but for how bitter this beer is, the malts still manage to show themselves pretty damn well. I’d love to try aging this behemoth. Too bad it would never last long enough in my house."
"O - A good standard barleywine. Slightly hot but some age should mellow that out. I liked it, above average."
"brown, though you can see some light through it, no head and a nice lace top it off. Smell is hopped for sure, but with a subtle sugary undertone, and a hint of alcohol too. Taste is not very strong at all. There is the natural piney hoppness you would expect from a barley wine, but not too strong, there is also a sugary, nuttiness about it as well. The alcohol is there, and that keeps this a sipper. It is actually nicely carbonated, and not harsh going down, has the warm feeling on the way. Overall this was a good brew,"
"mouth is good for a BW and its not too boozey"
"This is a BIG BEER! Sweet and then bitter at the end. Very tasty! If you're a IPA fan, you'll enjoy this even though it's a Barleywine. It reminds me of a Imperial IPA. Although, this is a 100 IBU monster, a lot of the bitterness is subdued by the sweetness, making this very well balanced."
"Overall: The smell was very nice, but the malt really disappeared behind the hops. Tasted more like an ipa than a barleywine. Good but not great."
"B"
"The mouthfeel is about average for the style and carbonation is a little above average. Overall it was a very nice beer. It was definitely a very hop forward version of the style, but it worked well for it. Very flavorful and easy drinking for the style and a very good beer overall."
"Cola brown in colour, auburn highlights, dense creamy light beige head. Sweet, floral, slightly spicy aroma. Caramel, slightly roasty malts are big up front, yet still restrained, as spicy piney hops start to dominate and yield a pithy bitter finish. Full bodied and warming on the way down. Surprisingly balanced considering the quoted ABV. The hops sometimes come off as slightly overpowering and detracting from the beer's overall complexity. Still, an enjoyable take on a style I'm unfortunately not all that familiar with."
"SkÅL!"
"Reveal: The Vermonster by Rock Art Brewery - no wood - but excellent brew!"
"D: i really dont know what to think of this one besides that it needs more time. too much heat really detracts from some other good flavors. not sure if i got a bad bottle or what cause other reviews are much more favorable. however, gotta go with what's in my glass."
"This is a medium bodies brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Bold fusel abv and modest bitterness compliment one another. For a barleywine, this is like a hybrid of the styles, smells sweet and English-like but is boldly filled with alcohol and bitterness like the american counter part. Not bad, it's worth trying."
"I really wanted to like this beer more that I did. It looks and smells great. There are a lot of complex flavors going on, but they just don't balance each other. Maybe this would benefit from some age, but I just feel like there are much better Barleywines out there right now."
"Thanks to Ratman for bringing this one over last Saturday night; I had been wanting to try it for some time now. Not sure how old this one was, but I know it had been aged for awhile. Poured a nice dark amber color with a smallish white head. Aromas of raisins, caramel, toffee and dark fruits. Medium to full bodied, with flavors of dark fruit, caramel and toffee."
"Decent price, but probably wouldn't purchase again without some knowledge as to the age of the beer."
"Overall this is the best barleywine I have had. It showcases both dry and sweet aspects of malts. I t also showcases pine like, citrus like, grassy and bitter elements of hops. This is a very balanced and complex beer. I wish I could find this beer locally."
"O- Overall this is a very solid barleywine. It would be interesting to see what some age does to this brew."
"O-> I reallyloved the taste right off the bat however once it warmed this became a bit of a struggle to finish. As others have said it took me well over an hour to finish by myself. Not a detracting factor per se, but I will be sharing this with several others in the future. Overall a pretty solid b-wine."
"This is a very nice barleywine, overall, with a good balance of hops and malt in both the smell and the taste. It makes me want to check out the rest of Rock Art's lineup."
"Overall not bad. I was hoping for just a little more in the way of hops."
"I liked it but it took over an hour to get through the bottle. Will need to be shared next time."
"Thick body, lighter carbonation, sticky and syrupy on the palate. Warm, heavy drinking but still pretty tasty from top to bottom, although this is definitely a bottle best split with a friend."
"Very well done American Barleywine. Medium body and a medium carbonation. I remember reading a few reviews about a year ago on this one and it beat what my expectations were for it. Nicely done Rock art."
"Drinkability: For the style I would have this again in a year to see how it evolves. I recommend this to those seeking an american barleywine that features the malt backbone and hop bitterness which are crucial to the style."
"At times these reminded me of quality DIPA's, or aged ones like Burton Baton. But it is not as hoppy as the 100 IBU's would have you think. And as a barleywine... it is good, but nothing earth-shattering for sure."
"Mouthfeel is round and juicy at first, tending toward astringent toward the finish. A bit different than many barleywines. At times it seems more like a black IPA or an old ale. An intriquing beer worth checking out."
"All in all, a solid barleywine. I think that as far as my tastes go in barleywines that a few years on this bottle could tone down that hop bitterness quite significantly. I find American barleywines lacking in the tobacco-esque / light smoke flavors that I pick up on in English barleywines and enjoy so much. I don't know that I'd drink a bomber of Vermonster by myself ever and at 10% it's not exactly sessionable. Good to drink with a buddy and definitely worth a try."
"This was a very good barleywine, lots of complex flavor. Surprisingly very easy to drink."
"Pours a dark brown color with a large tan head. Smells of hops and a bit of Ethel alcohol. What is this beer again (I rechecked the bottle)? Tastes more like a dipa with characteristics of a barleywine than a hop-forward american barleywine to me. Not to belabor the point, but other hop forward american barleywines have often been clearly barleywines - this, not so much. If you told me it was a funky dipa, I would be in. Stronger than expected carbonation as a barleywine carries all the way through. As a dipa, this is expected and enjoyed, as does the big hop and malt characteristics. Either way, the taste is good, not great. Its definitely not the most drinkable beer as a dipa or an american barleywine - its a bit like throwing the kitchen sink into the style. There is little in the way of subtlety or balance in there, just lots."
"Anyone looking for a hop-forward, astringent barleywine should look no further as this one is all about the pine and grapefruit with the malts playing a supporting role at most."
"D: Ok, sort of strange in its construction."
"d - A pretty nice barleywine. Would like to try again sometime."
"Flight got canceled, was happy to find this at the gas station across from the hotel. Poured into hotel water glass, hazy brown liquid with reddish brown hues. Tiny off white head fades to collar with minimal lacing. Smells of sweet malts and some sugar, caramel, and toffee. Some spicy hops as well. Taste is a balance of bitter hops and caramal malts, sweet with a very bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium heavy with a medium/light carbonation. Good but not great, this is a fine hoppy barleywine. This bottle wasnt as hoppy as some of the other Vermonsters I have had and prefer (very possible it had been sitting out/not well stored at the gas station for a while), but good regardless."
"D: Definitely would have this guy again. Gotta love Vermont."
"With 100 IBU's indicated on the label, I couldn't resist! Glad I purchased three bottles of this one, definitely worth a try if you're into bitter Barleys."
"overall - very interesting beer. I would love to have this aged a couple years."
"A reddish-brown beer with a decent head for the abv and minimal lacing. The nose is full of toffee, dark fruits and bread, citrus and pine notes. The taste has toffee, caramelized malts, dark breads, that barley-wine malt bite bitter hops, a slight alcohol burn on the finish that doesn't interfere with the experience. A nice thick mouth-feel, resinous, enjoyable carbonation. A solid barely-wine that I will revisit again."
"Drinkability is not so hot in my opinion. I don't get where the 100 IBUs are hiding (I don't think this is old, I just bought it from a reputable place). The alcohol is always noticeable and there's not too much happening in the taste."
"Drinkability:I like this one, and I think they are on the right track. I need to try and get a really fresh bottle to try."
"D: The 'hype' surrounding this off-named ale (a litigious situation with the 'Monster' energy drink folks scuffled late last year) made it worth seeking; good flavor and aroma made it worth enjoying. Not the most amazing barleywine I've tried, but not a disappointment either."
"Drinkability: Big abv and hefty mouthfeel without too much flavor complexity."
"Mouthfeel is moderately thick and typical of of a barleywine. Overall it's very nice, I'd like to see how it would do with another year or two to tame the hops down."
"Pours a moderate copper with an off white head. Smell is sweet malt, red fruits, alcohol, and a touch of caramel. Taste goes quite a bit downhill with some astringencies and a bit of a metallic flavor. The sweetness comes through, but that's about it. Mouthfeel is slightly boozy and off-puttingly dry. Poor drinkability, which is disappointing as I was quite looking forward to breaking this out with the cool weather."
"Wow, is this Bigfoot's uncle? Not for the faint of palate as this beer rips across the taste buds. However, a must for the hophead and a great find for the typical beer geek. As for cellaring, don't. Drink it fresh and let the hops take you for a ride."
"Alcohol taste has some effect on both mouthfeel and drinkability, but this is still a drinkable Barleywine. I am drinking the whole bottle and enjoying all 22 oz."
"1/27/13-Just had this again as my buddy Sean brought down a fresh bottle from VT, and man was this hoppy and full of life. Everything about it was hoppier, with the hops much more present in the aroma and flavor. Rich smoky malts and caramel still dominate, but the hops in thi sbottle make this seem like it was oak aged. Super slick, this went down with extreme ease and was so flavorful that the ABV was only a minor accent. A great beer."
"This bottle is from 10/9 so at almost a year in the cellar it's way, way too hot. Comes across as raw in general though and I like that in a beer so aptly named as The Vermonster."
"Impression: Another fine beer from Rock Art. If you like a hoppy barleywine you'll love this."
"Glad to hear that Rock Art came out on top with their legal battles surrounding this brew. Anyway, Vermonster comes out a dark ruby/brown color with a healthy inch of tan heading that lasts. The nose is of caramel, honey, dark fruit, (strawberries come to mind) and an herbal, spicy smell as well. The taste starts off on the sweet side for a split second, and then the 100 IBUs worth of hops make their appearance, bathing the palate with juicy, yet bitter hop notes. I also get some grapefruit, tobacco, and bubblegum. The bitterness cannot be overstated with this beer. While the body is very big, the alcohol is not readily noticeable. The drinkability is hindered somewhat by the astringent amount of bitterness from the hops, though I suspect that is precisely what they were going for this time. Final thoughts are that it is nice to see a Barleywine with such a heavy hop presence. Comparing a fresh bottle with an aged one would be very interesting I suspect."
"D: This one is something to take slow. It sure is a monster, and it deserves its respect. Nice take at an American Barleywine."
"Overall a very nice offering from a small brewery. Vermont continues to churn out nice little beers at a decent price."
"The mouthfeel is cloying and slightly thick but carbonation helps lift the flavors through your palate easily. And by easily, I mean powerfully. There is a lot going on in this big barleywine, very fitting of Rock Art's 10th anniversary. The finish is dry and very delicious with a hint of black cherries or raspberry. Enjoy this on its own after dinner or as a night cap with friends. And please pour into a snifter, tulip, or red wine glass, NOT a pint glass. Thank you! Your efforts will reward you."
"Unexpectedly delicious, this has a big caramel malt flavor to it with undertones of dark fruit and sherry, reminding me of traditional English barleywines, only with significantly more hops. The malt character is rich without lending excessive sweetness, almost nutty in character. Full-bodied with a long resiny finish, plenty complex but easy to sip on; this is one of the finer American barleywines I've had this year."
"D - Very drinkable for such a big beer. I'd like to see how this one ages."
"Highly recommended!"
"Very nice to drink."
"Poured a dark ruby into a tulip style glass. Solid finger and a half of head with decent lacing. Smell is quite hoppy w/ strong notes of pine. Slight hint of malt comes though if u look for it. Taste was hoppy w/ a definite pine oil & citrus taste up front. As the beer warms it begins to show its malt & caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel was slightly lacking in my personal opinion. I like barelywines w/ a full mouthfeel & this has a medium mouthfeel at best. The drinkability was good. Every sip went down smoothly & it hides the alcohol content rather well. All together this is not a bad beer by anymeans. It just doesn't stand up to some of the other American barelywines out there."
"D: I had higher hopes for this one, but in the end I'd say it's a fairly average barleywine. On the plus side the alcohol is hidden well. Would like to see how it ages"
"Overall really nice but now I wish I could try it fresh!"
"Overall a decent beer that I wouldn't shy away from."
"Overall: Nice big beer with a lot of alcohol that is not overbearing. Like the label says, ""allow yourself to retreat into your happy spot"" and enjoy."
"One of the better American barleywines I've had this year. The bottle advertises it as the big brother of Rock Art's other barleywine (which I haven't had), and it delivers big, delicious flavor and aroma as promised. As for the bizarre ""You are feeling quite peaceful; You are ascending into a land of calmness"" hypnotist mantra type things on the label, I don't know."
"Overall, a good hoppy barleywine that I recommend. The bitter does start to pile up and you can feel the 10% as you go along so it's a good sharing beer or end of night beer. Rotation - not available here in TX so was fortunate to get as an extra. For now, one is probably enough as there are others that I like better. But I'd like to try one again in a few years as my bitter palate develops [O;O;ML]"
"Nice but a little diacetyl is detected. Buttery with caramel, toffee, fig, and date, again the malt is toasty and nutty. Mouth is slightly thin and light."
"Got this as an extra for my first trade, nice surprise since Rock Art is not distributed in my area that I know of. Sweet malty smell with a little hops. Tasted like a malty barlywine mixed with an IPA. Probably the best barleywine I've had so far, I'm not usually a big fan of that style but I try them occasionally."
"D: I think 1 bomber is enough, but for the style I think that it's expected. I think after this my tastebuds will not be too happy for a different beer. 10% is not noticed so it's not hard to drink the bomber. A good American Barleywine."
"D: This is an awesome American Barleywine!! So full of flavor and hearty mouthfeel. It could be the best beer I have ever purchesed for $5. This 22oz. at 10 % alcohol was a great deal."
"So, the hops overpower the malts. Interesting that the advertising of the beer talks more about malts than hops. This is a problem, you know I keep talking about the balance of beers. This beer is not balanced. It is a barleywine, it is supposed to be strong, and it is."
"This is a drinkable beer. I wouldn't be ashamed to bring it to a party, but it doesn't distinguish itself enough to be a 'best in class.'"
"I had this beer from a 22oz bottle. It poured a deep reddish brown color with a slight haziness. The head was an off white color about an inch thick. It dissipated fairly quickly and left a medium amount of lacing. The smell and taste combine caramel malts, a pine hop flavor, and a noticeable amount of alcohol. I think the alcohol should be a bit more balanced with the other flavors to improve the drinkability overall."
"Poured into a New Belgium glass dark mahagony brown. The scent is of strong malted sweetness, with chocolate notes. The taste is rather smooth for a barleywine. Very well balanced of hops and malts, no over use that shocks the toungue. The mouthfeel doesn't have any noticable alcohol burn for this amount of abv. This is overall a very nice barleywine, and very drinkable."
"Pours a deep burnished copper color with a sticky off white head that leaves a fair bit of lace on the way down. Smells of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, vanilla, pine, slight touch of alcohol. Taste is sweet caramel malt cut in half with bitter pine resin. Malty sweet with enough hop bitterness to keep everything in check. Surprisingly balanced taste for a beer that brags about 100 Ibu's. Alcohol is well hidden on this one. Long lingering hop bitterness in the finish. Resinous and sticky mouthfeel, full body, light to medium level of carbonation. I like this one a lot. Reminds me of Bigfoot with a year or two on it when the malt starts to show up. Why did I wait so long to try this one?"
"D- Had this once before and don't recall there being any citrus notes and wasn't all that impressed with the overall product. Glad I revisited because I'm enjoying it quite a bit this time around. I'll have to give this a third go at some point and see if the positive impression continues."
"- Very easy to drink.. tasty, and not too sweet. That's about it. This is a fine ale, and is better than I expected."
"Drinkability: I'm still not too big on barleywines, but I decided to give this beer a try after it's legal problems. A very enjoyable beer that I can see myself drinking again."
"Thanks indiapaleale!"
"Thanks again Mark!"
"Cheers!"
"The drinkability should be higher but I cannot justify it. I will say that the 2nd half of the bottle was better and a bit fuller when some of the dregs made it's way into the glass. The yeast helped to liven things up a bit. I should of just dumped the 1st half and worked with the 2nd half. I'll try it again down the road and revise if I see fit as I see that another reviewer from PA had the same problem in feel. This monster was not scary at all, It did not even startle me."
"D: Decent beer that I could drink a little more of, but the bomber does the job nicely. Impressive beer with lots of big flavors. Not exactly sure how fresh this one is, but I bet when it's really fresh it's even more of a ""monster"". Great beer. Glad I got to try it!"
"The nose is of lightly roasted malt, caramel, and earthy hops. The 10% is deftly hidden. The flavor is caramel with a light sweetness. Pine character and earthy hops are evident, as is a little chocolate and a dash of brown sugar. The mouthfeel is creamy and full. This drank easy for the high ABV."
"A solid beer, reminds me of Arrogant Bastard. I wish the bottle i had was fresher, this beer was definitely malt forward for a supposedly 100 IBU beer. I guess i'll have to try it again!"
"Extremely drinkable, this stuff goes down way too easily."
"I've been wanting to try some Vermonster for awhile now, glad I finally got the chance."
"Very, very bitter with an overwhelming hop taste that couples with pine resin flavor to drown out any hints of the carmel that appears in the aroma. The texture was horrible, I have never had such a chewy beer before, and the thin carbonation only exacerbated the problem. The body was jsut too big to deliver any semblance of drinkability, and for the first time in 25 years I had to cut it 3:1 with water."
"4.5/4/4.5/4/4"
"Pale mahogany in color. Small, tight, tan head. Moderate aroma-has a mellow oakey/vanilla thing to it. Very floral and somewhat caramel like. Big malty flavor. Good level of hops going on. Again a faint oak/vanilla flavor. Long lingering bitterness. Gets a tad boozy as it warms and towards the end of the glass. Very nice mouthfeel-at times an almost creamy smoothness. The boozy/alcohol tinge gives it a faint acrid bite. Very enjoyable and satisfying. I nursed this over a solid hour and it just got better. Well balanced and the best Rock Art beer I have had."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"Overall: a fascinating beer. I'd definitely have it again if I could find it, but I sort of doubt I will since other than that one time I've never seen it in local stores. I'll be visiting western MA in a month or so - I'll look for it there."
" Medium carbonation, mid bodied, drinkable enough for a barleywine. Overall an interesting entry in the category, actually stood up fairly decently in a side by side with Mirror Mirror but fell just a hair short of that beer. Not perfect but well executed and tasty enough that I'll definitely be seeking out more Rock Art beers in the near future."
"Overall, a pretty okay barleywine. Glad I got a chance to try it but I can't say it was my particular cup o' tea."
"D- This is an aggressive beer, a slow sipper for me, I will have another but at a later date."
"Would I buy more of it? - Yes and I can honestly say that Rock Art makes some of the most affordable craft beers on the market. This bottle was less than $7. I'd like to have a bottle to keep around for a year or so and then compare it with a fresh one."
"M/D - Silky, sticky sweet body is appropriate for style and matches the rest of the brew well. Easy to drink considering the ABV but still obviously a potent concoction. Overall a beer I very much enjoyed on my 100th BA review!"
"Pours a dark brown color with a small white head. The first whiff is strong on the hops, specifically a strong piney aroma. You also get a little caramel malt and alcohol in the aroma. The taste is a lot of pine and grapefruit hops up front, with a strong caramel backbone later in the taste. When the beer is cold, it is very unbalanced and hoppy. The beer gets much more balanced as it warms up, although the alcohol stays present throughout. Not really sure how close this fits the American Barleywine style since it is so hoppy, but it is very good regardless. Recommended."
"Much thanks go to Sparklepants who shared this beer with me tonight. Dasrk amber in the tulip, not much in the way of foam, and no lacing. Not really expecting much in the appearance departement from such a high ABV beer, so this gets my default 4. Aroma is all hops up front, nice and piney, with some sweet malts in the background. Booze bring up the rear end of the nose, and I'm detecting just a hint of raostiness on the back end. Flavor is nice and hoppy, bitter for sure, resiny pine, and a solid, well structured malt profile. Caramel is in the forefront of the malt side, followed by a touch of chocolate and the lightest bit of roastiness buried deep within. Bitter, piney hops were at the front when it was cold, but as it warmed, the malts really started to shine and became extremely well-balanced. Mouthfeel was a tad a thin for me, and the booze was just a touch too strong, but it was damn tasty all around,and that's what's important. Great beer and would like to thank whichever trader hooked up Sparklepants with this one, and she herself for sharing the love!"
"D: Fairly easy to forget this on is so big despite the booze. Great to share but could easily have this bomber on my own"
"Pours a dark brown color which is garnet when held to the light with a one finger off white head of large bubbles with good retention leaving streaky lacing that sticks to the glass. The alcohol is apparant in the smell with grapefruit, raisin, fig and sweet grapes. Roasted malt and chocolate flavors mix with sweet concord grapes and grapefruit with a vanilla finish. Full body, medium carbonation clean drinking beer. The alcohol is noticeable in the aroma and flavor, not a creeper- definitely a sipper on a cold Vermont winter night."
"Avg - B"
"Though it has aged about a year since imagineiii sent it to me, this beer still has a lot of hoppy bitterness going for it; thanks for the opportunity"
"D- Fairly high, considering the ABV. I drank this one quicker than I thought I would, and really enjoyed it. It really grew on me, and by the end of the bomber I want to climb on my roof and shout its name for all to hear. I will buy this one again, very impressed!"
"D - For barelywine, Dangerously drinkable"
"On the palate there's a big influence of malt and not just hops, and I was expecting nothing but hops given the boastful 100 IBU label. So, there's more balance than expected, but nothing spectacular one way or another on the palate - hops don't stand out, malt doesn't stand out. It's balanced because not much is going on. Finish is somewhat short."
"Also, nothing like Monster energy drink... incase you were confused."
"Notes to Hansen/Monster Beverages: This is in no way confusable with your yellow-green energy drinks. Please drop your law suit against Rock Art directly."
"Blech. Like to try this again fresher, but this bottle ain't that old."
"D: Drinkability was good, especially for its 10.0%abv which is masked by the assertive hoppiness. Malty, hoppy, and well balanced makes for a easy and quite enjoyable hop monster indeed. Definitly one of Rockarts better beers."
"22oz. bottled served in my Gouden Carolus chalice. Poured a hazy mahogany with a quarter inch off-white head that dissipated into a slick with a thick band around the perimeter embedded with tiny bubbles. Some spots of lacing, but weak legs. Nose was boozy, malty molasses. Taste follows nose, but also picked up some bittering hops that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied and lightly effervescent; decent consistency with a slightly oily feel. This is a big beer that is definitely a sipper, but hops bitterness is a little too overpowering for my likely and made the brew seem a little unbalanced."
"Pours cloudy brown with minimal tan lacing. Aroma of toffee, alcohol, caramel, coffee. Taste of caramel, toffee, coffee, dark fruits with a strong bitter finish of cocoa and alcohol. Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. Overall, a very interesting beer with some charecter that hides its alcohol well in some places."
"A nice beer."
"It is a rare occurrence to find such an aggressively hopped barleywine here on the East Coast. Coming in at 100 IBU's, the folks at Rock Art were not playing around with this offering. All in all, a mighty fine brew and a ""must have"" for all hop heads out there."
"Much better than its little brother. This is a barleywine done right, even if the dial is turned up a too high on ""booze""."
"Courtesy of gillard (I've been pining to try this since Ryan first told me about it a few months ago, oh yeah!). Pour slightly hazy amber with thin tan head. The aroma is dark fruity esters with some crystal malty sweetness. I also get some mild hotness too. It tastes nice and rich with a lean toward sessionable. I'm getting some malt chewy sweetness leading the way toward dark fruity esters like plums, cherries and grapes. The pine hop bitterness mixes nicely with the other notes."
"D-Big and bold with tons of flavour. Packs a fairly serious punch that seems greater than it's 10% ABV. A well balanced Am. B-wine that is underappreciated IMHO."
"Overall, my first beer from Rock Art, and hopefully not my last. Those tree-huggin' maple-syrup-makin' hippies might not allow billboards, but they certainly make one hell of barleywine."
"Vermonster is a pretty cool name for a barleywine brewed in The Green Mountain State. Trouble is, the beer is hot rather than cool, even at almost 2 years of age. Time to slow down so that my brain doesn't become as numb as my tongue. Thanks Vermonthiker."
"D: I remember getting a bottle of this years ago before VT changed their laws and it was listed as 6.99% ABV and calling bullshit on that. This is a good beer. I think next time I can get this I will do a side by side with Druid Fluid."
"I would probably try this again, but maybe next time with some cheese and bread."
"D: One glass, at 10%, is enough for one night. If I had a bomber, I'd need to barricade myself in the house."
"D- the feel and taste belie the 10% abv. I can see why they call this ""the vermonster""."
"Unfortunately, as the beer warms, the main component that comes out is the strength of the alcohol. I wouldn't call this balanced, nor particularly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Interesting, and very fruity. Alcohol is up there, though, and only mildly hidden, and it's definitely strange. Not sure what to make of it really. On the one hand, all the right notes are there, and on the other, it's heavily, heavily slanted towards yeasty, fruity esters. I was slow finishing it, but only because I was perplexed. Worth giving it a shot."
"Pours a deep amber red with a large off color head. There's almost no smell but the flavor is huge, malty and bitter, smokey and cherry-like. The mouthfeel is thick and the finish leaves a lovely bitterness clinging to the tongue. This is a tasty beer, though the malty sweetness tends to obscure the alcohol."
"Pours a cloudy orange/amber with a fairly minimal head. This is another American Barlywine that is virtually indistinguishable from a double IPA. A bit dry for a barley wine, but there is a big hit of dry malt. Fairly large hop hit with a piney, earthy taste rather than in the citrusy direction. The taste is a bit stronger here than in the aroma, and there is quite a bit of lingering bitterness. In fact, most of the sweetness here comes out in the aroma rather than in the taste. Very firm and even a bit spicy in the mouth, and just a tad hot. This is definitely a sipper, but quite nice."
"d: Pretty solid effort and one I'd like to revisit."
"Drinkability: Low drinkability brought on primarily by both the apparent alcohol and brash, overdone bitterness, leaving this one a slow, grumpy sipper. Exhibits an alarming trend in American barleywines. Little malt depth, hop character, and just tons of coarse bitterness and booze. Bartender, can I get a water?"
"On tap poured directly into a snifter, this barleywine has an exceptional balance and taste. A bit of bitterness and a little smidgen of sweetness added to the depth of the barley and high ABV (10%). Out of the bottle it is a bit ubercarbonated, but this, my first ever barleywine on tap and being the second time I have tried this beer within a week, the on tap version blew my mind. The color was a deep ruby and light brown, with a great, creamy head that overloaded the snifter glass rather easily. Having received a recommendation from a local Vermont bartender in a great bar in Wardsboro, this beer's complexion and smooth, super-malty finish outdid even the local Smuttynose IPA on tap. Whoa!"
"Drinkability: Way to go Rock Art for making a great hugely hopped Barleywine! It was a hugely hopped beer without being too aggressive. I would have liked a little more malt in here, but that might have lessened the hop impact on my taste buds. It would be a joy to drink again!"
"D - over the top, decent drinking barleywine. you know it's strong, occasional abv notes come out of hiding but otherwise has a good balance."
"pours clear and golden with massive amounts of spotty lacing. the aroma is hop heavy... even more so than the dipa. lots of fresh leafy hop goodness... pine, grass and spice with just a touch of orange and caramel sweetness. alcohol heat stings when it gets warm. the flavor carries the same punchy hop traits and is impressively very dry (for a BW) though not quite parching. fruity caramel shows up but it has little residual sugar to muck up the show. it's spicy on the finish which turns to a welcoming heat from the abv%. medium body is in no way sticky. soft creamy texture yet insanely drinkable when considering how much alcohol is in this beast...8/3/8/4/17=4.0"
"D - Drinkability is good for a 10% brew. It's a sipper though. There are alot more hops in this beer than I was expecting. Big hops, alcohol, and flavor come together to make a good beer from Rock Art. The limit has to be one given the alcohol but a bomber of this magnitude takes a while to get through anyway. I could see getting this beer again. Recommended."
"D: Quite drinkable for its strength."
"A great barleywine. Hoppy and balanced, and surprising 100 IBU, certainly can't taste it. Aroma is very nice. Big soapy white head on a brown body, inviting. Good bitterness. Dry hopping, leads to dry and pleasant hopped finish. Very drinkable.Medium mouthfeel."
"Granted this isn't the finest example of the style you're likely to come across but it's leaps and bounds better than Rock Art's other barleywine, the Ridge Runner. And although not something I'd save for a quiet evening by the fireplace, I would certainly find a spot for this in the cold cellar. This could improve yet with a little age..."
"Poured a deep amber color witha rocky tan head with good carbonation. Nose is malts, hops(lots of it) and deep caramel, sticky dried fruits, brown sugar. Taste was nice and chewy, syrupy and good, Caramel, sugar and some dried fruits. very sticky. Mouthfeel was good, warming and very thick. Very drinkable. What a American Bwine should be!"
"Drinkability- Very well balanced, grows on you as you consume. Quite nice and different in a hoppy way."
"A decent brew. Good to sip by a fire on a fall night. Not the top beer in the style, but a good bridge beer for those uninitiated to barleywines. Worth a shot."
"Seems fuller than I remember the Ridge Runner (the brewery's other barleywine) being, though honestly that's not saying a whole lot, as it was on the thinner side of the style). Still, this could still be even thicker/richer for the style. But, it does help drinkability, which is easy for the style/abv. Drinks well for a 10% brew. This is a solid choice for a barleywine that lands on the bitter side of the spectrum, and for only four bucks and change for a 22 ounce bottle."
"On tap from a 1/6 barrel keg freshly filled the day before. Pours a simply beautiful dark reddish brown with a thick 1 inch beige-off white head. Heavy, sticky, sweet lacing clings lovingly to the side of the glass. Smells of spicy hops dominate the rich malts. First sip is a hoppy bitterness that is both tangy and biting. The massive hops are paired with a complimenting strong malt backbone creating a creamy milkshake like mouthfeel. Very Nice - Seek this one on tap."
"Bottom line: This is a very tasty and thoroughly enjoyable example of the style. A bottle of this in the dead of Winter would be sure to brighten up just about *anyone's* day."
"A solid copper color with a decent off-white head and very nice lace. The aroma is a slightly spicey piney hops and malt. The taste is a hearty malt with alcohol and piney hops. A very solid body feel with modest fine carbonation and plenty of hop bite on the tongue. Grapey and lots of chewy malt. A very high quality brew that delivers DIPA pleasure."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Hazy deep amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight caramel nose. Flavor is sweet caramel with a bite. Some bitterness at finish. Much better than their Ridge Runner Barley Wine. Higher ABV hidden. $4.85 for a 22oz bottle from Gillingham's Woodstock, VT."
"Don't they know there is a hop shortage in the world!? Yeasty dregs, don't even consider the last ½ inch of the bottle!"
"D: Very good beer from Rock Art. Glad I didn't pass this one up. A bit heavy on ABV but great all around. I could drink on of these occassionally as the month progresses. Wouldn't want it every night, but then again I wouldn't want the style every night. Great brew. Drink it if you can get it."
"Big tan head, very sticky thick cap, great retention, impressive lacing bands all the way down the glass as I drink. Dark, wood-stain brown with tons of tiny bubbles constantly rising in it. Aromas of sweet and roasted malts and some ripe fruit with rind; very pleasant esters. Big bold flavors, toffee, resin, caramel. Great hops and malt balance. 10% ALC is surprisingly well hidden. More layers of flavor show up as it warms (I'd recommend letting the bomber do so). Though I can see the bubbles it tastes like a low carbonation beer because it is so smooth. 100 IBU!! And it shows, long semi-bitter and piney finish. Very, very good."
"Dense and creamy mouthfeel and even at 10% it is very easy to drink."
"Traveling through Vermont,I had to pick up the local offering. As far as I know it only comes in a 22 OZ bomber. The taste, pour and smell are exceptional. A great cookout out or gathering beer. My favorite of a long list of trials. I highly recommend this beer."
" Keep this stuff comming Vermont!! This was easily the most complex and intesnse brew I've had come out of VT since Ray Mcneill's ""Bucksnort"" Barleywine."
"Excellent mouthfeel, full and creamy, rich and satisfying. Good sipper, pretty drinkable, but this one definitely has some strength to it."
"D: Fairly drinkable for the style."
"The taste is hot upfront, yeasty, boozey, caramel, spicy hops, bring a balancing bitterness to this beer but is dominated by the hoppy, pine, aspect. The finish is smooth a great barleywine that heats up the body on a cold winter day."
"Cloudy reddish-brown, minimal head retention, good amount of blotchy lacing. Smell is a lot of caramel malts, a pretty firm hop presence, earthy bitterness. Some apple-cider aromas in there, darker fruit. Taste is more sweet caramel and molasses up front with a huge blast of hops trailing not far behind. Almost like a DIPA on the sweet side. I actually had to make sure it was the right bottle, I thought maybe I had picked up the wrong beer. Lots of earthy bitterness at the finish, lingering dry hops. A tad sour. All in all it's a very nice beer, but considering all of the more intensely-hopped barleywines I've had, it's not all that complex. But very drinkable, especially for the high abv."
"1066"
"Very clear with a deep reddish hue and burnt orange tint. Soapy beige bubbles formed a thick collar and a fine skim laced the top of the beer. The foam was just a bit sticky and spotty on the glass. Rich caramel and toffee aroma with citrusy hops in the background and prominent alcohol. Some dried fruit notes as well. Moderate bitterness and quite sweet up front, lots of toffee and caramel, with a little citrus and bread character, plus ripe fruits. Alcohol dominated the end though and was fairly aggressive considering the abv, lingering long on the palate and giving it a bit of an acrid flavour. Citrus and malt were present in the finish, but were overshadowed by the alcohol. Medium to full bodied with slightly coarse carbonation. Drinkability wasn't great. The alcohol was on the hot side and bordered on solventy. This one just didn't quite come together for me."
"Pours a nice dark amber color, very nice carbonation, nice small creamy tan head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slight dark fruits, and some caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, slight fruitness, with some caramel. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, with it being my first from this brewery. Thanks Wayne for hooking me up."
"D: A fine barleywine, but I wished for more bitterness."
"Somewhat bland compared to some Barleywines, but the bold qualities are certainly there. Distinct hop profile and cutting alcohol quality."
"D- I am glad that I had the opportunity to try one of the few big VT offerings. Overall, not something I would actively seek out in the future."
"just a bit too alcoholic, which cancels out the nuances in the brew. still enjoyable, but only if shared with others. probably not able to finish a whole bomber myself."
"Certainly this is easy to drink. Only thing missing is a more complex flavor. Worth a try but I wouldn't pay too much for one."
"D: Its just a tad over the top to drink more than one in an average sitting... but this is a great beer..."
"Cheers."
"Pours a murky brown with minimal head and lacing. Smell is very inviting..sweet malty..yeasty...plums? Definite alcohol presence in the taste, sweet maltiness remains with a definite hop presence. Drinkability suffers a tad due to a definite astringent quality. Mouthfeel is affected likewise by astringency."
"again, i don't agree with the classification as a barleywine, i think it's way too hoppy, so if you're looking for that, be aware. if you look at it as a monster hoppy IIPA or an imperial IPA, it's a damned nice hop fix."
"A nice barleywine from Rock Art overall. It's big and beefy yet subtle at the same time. Well worth a try."
"My favorite style is Double IPA. So, I would say that this is a good and quite drinkable beer. However, I think it is miss labled as a barley wine."
"Pours a hazy brown in color with a small off white head that slowly recedes, small amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet juicy berry, cotton candy, and citrusy hoppiness, a touch of the alcohol content is evident as it warms. Taste follows suit with a good dose of citrus up front before some sweet caramel maltiness blends in and leads into a bitter and slightly peppery finish with a warming alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is medium, soft and creamy texture in the background is overpowered by the zing and bitterness of thw hops and the slight warmth from the alcohol. Very good beer, def in the dipa camp for me but I look forward to ageing one and seeing what develops. Thanks to Jim and Adam for the opportunity."
"Mouthfeel is just shy of a nice full bodied brew. The after taste is extremely dry with a hint of burning to it. I feel like I have indulged is some of Humulus lupulus' dear cousin. I can't remember ever having a beer that had such a drying affect as this one does. However, I do find it to be a rather enjoyable beer. Maybe I just need to have another one to quench my thirst."
"Overall, I think this beer would benefit greatly with some time in the cellar. As it is right now, the flavors are all over the place and somewhat harsh. Not a bad brew, perhaps too young."
"100 IBU's? Either I'm completely numb to hops or this so well brewed that the IBU's are hidden, either way, this is not your typical 100 IBU hop monster. It's almost the wasabi for hop monsters. Burns for a second, then it's over. Interesting."
"I've had the pleasure to enjoy this brew on two seperate occasions and I can't help but give it a perfect review. It has a perfect rusty red color with low head retention. The aroma is out if this world with intense American hops, dried fruits, malt sweetness, and ethanol spice. The flavor lives up to the promise of the aroma, and delivers a delightfully complex array of flavors. The mouthfeel is oily, as is expected from a high gravity brew. This is by far one of the most enjoyable barleywine ales I have ever had the pleasure to sample. This is a must-try to any barleywine fan."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable old ale/English barleywine. I think this brew has tremendous potential for ageing. A lot of flavors reminiscent of a very young Thomas Hardy's. Should be 5's across the board in a year or two. Ironically, the first true 'extreme' beer from RA does not carry the label that they have plastered on so many beers. One possible problem: there are already some oxidized sherrylike notes so this might not be as long-lived as I'd hope."
"A very decent crack at a barleywine. I look forward to reviewing this again in a year or two."
"Wow, how exciting! Billed as the big brother to Ridge Runner and can only be found at state liquor stores in Vermont because it is 10% ABV. Looks amazing: pours a deep dark brown with a huge flowing tan headskie. Flavor complex with a fresh hop tang out front and some chewy malt balance backing it up. The flavor is all over the place, but I suspect it will be amazing after some time in the cellar. I can't wait to give it a year!"
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a scant 1/4"" tan head over the clear burgundy brew. Head is down to an uneven swirly layer of bubbles promptly, with slow-falling lacing. Aroma is sweet, fruity, and alcoholic. Taste is similar to the nose, with the strong alcohol in the latter half dominating and being of the sharp, rubbing alcohol type. Mouthfeel is good until the alcohol over-achieves, and drinkability is limited by same. Probably not one I'd search out again."
"Pretty rough around the edges at this point, but could be a good candidate for aging."
"22oz bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a rich ruby brown with ample head. Strong boozy malty aroma. And that's exactly how the taste is. Powerful, malty and hoppy. It packs quite a punch all around. The alcohol content is quite evident. It is a bit sweet, but not overly so. Although this is a beer that will certainly make you take notice, it's not the most enjoyable beer in the world. I'm finding this one to be a bit of a chore, likely due to its very high malt content. But then again, I'm generally not a big barleywine fan, so feel free to take this review with a grain of malt. Yet as the beer goes on, that noticeable alcohol does its trick and sucks you in and makes you fall in love with the world."
