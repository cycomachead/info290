"Overall- I enjoyed this beer, I would buy it the next time I see it on tap."
"Good beer. Not quiet my style"
""
""
""
"A solid American barleywine, definitely a DuClaw brew I can get excited about."
"O: Overall tasty.  I could see how some fans of the style would ding this for not being a little more bitter, but I am digging the solid hop flavor balancing the malt....  This Barley Wine certainly leans to the American side, but malt heads will like it as well."

"Taste is big oily pine, light caramel, and earth.  Alcohol comes out as the beer warms.  An above average American Barleywine, but there are others in the style that I prefer."

"I echo Dar482 sentiment a bit.  It's a TIPA.  Oddly balanced, not too malty, not too hoppy,  I was initially confused, and then I remembered.  It's DuClaw.  Fun beer, but not usually great beer.  Hwever, it might be someone's gateway into barleywine, and for that, DuClaw, I thank you."

"Had this beer in Chicago 3 years ago.. NJ couldn't get it... this year I could.. and just as tasty as I remember!"

""

"In general, I would categorize this as a really well made triple IPA."

"O:  Not bad, but I think this one changes a lot over the course of a year and is probably best when fresh, which is surprising for a 10.6% American Barleywine."
""
""
"O - Average.  If I tried it again, 'would definitely be a newer bottle or would go for the barrel aged version."
""
""
""
""
"bad one to try."

"Pours from the bottle with a sparkling, clear, almost pinkish medium brown color, but almost no head. The aroma is disappointingly muted, with only a mild grainy sweetness and a light pine character being discernable. The flavor is more forward, with woody hops being balanced against subtly sweet caramel malts. It's not too boozy or sweet as many barley wines can get, and rather just provides a full balance of flavors. The medium body and light carbonation further help this one from getting too syrupy. Overall, despite being comparatively mellow for a 10% barley wine, the rich flavors one would expect still come through."
""
""
""
"Taste is really smooth for a 10+ %er. Goes down really easy and there is some sort of sweet lactosy malt that makes the name worthy. The hops have faded quite a bit here and a little bit of oxidation is creeping in. The mouthfeel is almost thin, but that sounds worse than it is, the upside is that is really easy to quaff. This is a good beer, Id like to try a fresh one to see what kind of hop load it has."
""
""
"O- Brews like this make you realize how well crafted something like SN Bigfoot is. This is a big, hot, boozy mess."
""
""
""
"Simple, direct, but just not much to it, I've enjoyed many of DuClaw's beers much more than this one. Decent enough, but this needs more vavoom."
"Now, if only DuClaw could brew X-1 again..."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a murky brown color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and not much lacing. Aroma consists of deep caramelized malt with quite a bit of green hoppy notes. Taste is also a mix between some overly sweet caramelized malt with some stalled green hops that don’t really mix that well with the malt backbone. Body is about average with medium-to-low carbonation and light apparent alcohol. There is something off balanced in this beer that I didn’t particularly enjoyed."

"O: for being a barleywine, I would have pegged it for a smooth IPA. Not terrible, but I'm not sure he palate I'd recommend it for."
""
"Overall: I'm really enjoying this beer. It's a bit sweet, and not particularly complex, but it is satisfying in an intangible way. I just kind of hits the spot."
"this beer poured phenomenal and smelled great.. but once it hit the palate, it was a bit underwhelming for the style, which happens to be one of my personal favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is boozy and awkward and not something I would seek out if looking for a solid barleywine. It saddens me to say it because I am always hoping to see local places do good but this one is rough. I appreciate the chance to try this but would probably not persue again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall its a triple ipa thinly disguised as an barleywine. Fairly smooth to consume even at 10.6%. Had a few of thier beers previously, this is the first that truely impresses me."
""
""
""
""
"O: A tasty beer, but just a little much. Too much sweetness, too thick, too much alcohol. If they had toned it back a little it could have been a great beer, but I can barely drink a 12 oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Seems more like an English barleywine, just doesn't hop forward enough. Drank fairly easy, but nothing to get excited about, Started to show more American aspects the last third of the bottle, but this was stored & served at 56 degrees, so it had to warm up a ton to really show what it was"
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall: This is probably the best barleywine I've ever had. I want more!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really good Barleywine that is somewhat local. Taste a lot like Bigfoot. Might be the hops that do it. But, this is about $5 less for a sixer. Definitely recommend this brew. Good offering from DuClaw."
""

"O: Awesome barley wine – I grab one or two of these every year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not very complex, however it is well balanced. The 10.6% abv is well hidden. Not necessarily something I would purchase again though."
"A solid barleywine. Nothing about it really wowed me, but it was solid all around if a bit on the sweet side."
""
""
""
"O: Average ale. The taste was kind of flat and it had a sort of watery mouthfeel. Smelled good though."
"Fuller medium body, slightly higher carbonation, sticky and coating on the tongue. Extremely hoppy barleywine that could probably benefit from some time in the cellar, although this isn't exactly in the top tier of the style."
"O: Overall a good barleywine. This is nothing unbelievable and the barrel aging has not done anything great to the complexity. It is a little deeper, but nothing transforming. Overall the barrel aging has added some oakiness and earthiness but maybe the barrel they chose wasnt as fresh as it could have been."
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a quickly receeding head as a lovely reddish amber. Served fresh the piney hops are muted but present in the nose. The body is surprisingly soft for the ABV. It starts with bready malt, quickly overcome by grapefruit hops, the alcohol warms the finish and it's surprisingly drinkable for the abv."
""
"Overall I would welcome seconds! This is so far the best beer Duclaw has made in a shower of mediocre beers. Recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"D a pretty standard barley wine with a nice balance of hops and sweet malt. Not the most complex, but reasonably well done."
"Single finger head with excellent lacing on a clear amber with straw hues body. Aroma is malty with caramel, candied fruit and light toffee. Very smooth caramel malts, tanginess, candied citrus and light toffee. Moderate carbonation and smooth oily body. This is one of the smoothest and more drinkable barleywines I have had. Very good and highly drinkable for the style."
""
"Pretty mellow and smooth for the high abv (maybe it's old as hell) Dark fruits and burnt caramel, lightly toasted maltiness, all blend together for a nice concise flavorful sip. Rather subtle though. A bit of alcohol heat on the finish. For a barley wine it's pretty drinkable but it's not complex or presents the drinker with anything unique. Sweet overall with a big chalky mouthfeel. It's alright. I'd take it over a lot of things, but probably wouldn't buy it again."
"A fairly good barleywine but nothing close to the top ones I have tried."
""
""
""
""
"All that said, this isn't my favorite barleywine . It was worth trying, but not exactly what I am looking for. So I most likely won't buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. I keep going back and forth on this beer. On one hand, I love the assertiveness of this beer, and it's not afraid to bring the flavor. However, I feel that these intense flavors are not congruent with each other. A strong sweetness is immediately replaced with bitterness, and then an alcohol-filled finish. It's not smooth in its transitions, and by the time you reach the aftertaste you are wishing the sweetness would return."
""
"O- One of the best barleywines I have had. Very unique and complex, but also drinkable. ABV is hidden well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink and overall: Well, this beer took me a minute to warm up to. And, I think it got better as it warmed up. Fairly boozy. Not really easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Really not a bad beer. Low on drinkability as it is on the sweeter side and big on ABV, but for a one-timer to have in the fridge, not a bad choice. Duclaw seems hit or miss, and this one sits closer to the hit side of things."
""
""
""
""

"Medium bodied with a strong hop presence up front that lingers over the sweeter notes into a sweet, slightly dry finish. Some dry, bitter notes with hints of grassy pine followed by some sweet citrus. The malts are pretty tame for a barleywine without being overly musty/leathery. Hints of nut, caramel and toffee as well as a sweeter dark fruit character. Subtle sweetness and boozy heat in the finish but the high ABV is well masked making it easy to drink. Well balanced but feels more like a strong ale than a barleywine."
"This beer poured out as a really nice amber color with a pretty good thin yellowish cream colored head. Thin, not much lacing but stuck around for a while on top. The smell of this beer has a really nice sweetness, grains and malts on the nose. The taste is also sweet, it's got a citrus kick of lemon in the flavor. The malts and grains are really flavorful. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, nicely balanced. Overall a damn good Barley Wine!"
"Rich copper color. Fingers worth of tan head. Smell is hop and sour apple. Figgy dark fruit as well. Taste is strong alcohol. Incredibly overpowering. In fact I can't get past a few sips to notice anything else. This was a drain pour. Really unworthy of this lame review even."
"azy dark, burnt ruby amber. Very intresting hue as the reddish tint was very noticeable even though the haze made it almost opaque. A one inch head formed on the top upon pour, that faded almost immediatly. What was left was a thin film of decent quality lace that circle around the glass. Smell was very sweet, caramel sugars hitting almost immediatly. The deeper smell after some warming indicated a nice bready, earthy malt back with a hint of alcohol, which at 9%abv and being a barleywine should be expected. The taste for me was just too light. I expect barleywines to make me sit down and to be a definite sipper, but this just did not have the fullness I would have expected. The finish on it was very dry, and did last a good bit though"
"D - A very promising American Barleywine in terms of appearance and aroma, but quickly becomes average at best when taking into accounting taste, mouthfeel and overall drinkability... Not terrible, but there are scads and scads of other style mates that I would opt for and recommend..."
"D: Quite good, but the strength begs it to be sipped."
"Poured a dark copper red with minimal head and lace. A large malty aroma with some sticky sweetness and a hint of citric, fruity hops. Very medium-close-to-fuller bodied beer with some sweet caramel/sugary goodness (vanilla?) and there's a balance w/ dry, roasted malt. Bitter and sweet fruit tastes come through, mostly some tart cherry notes and the beer passes huskily over the tongue with a touch of stickiness although some sips gave off a sour, funky (not in a bad way) backbite. A sturdy sipper I took my time w/ and enjoyed."
"D - Delicious! A sipper for sure. This is my favorite beer brewed in Maryland, Period."
"O- This is a really great barleywine. Anyone who likes this style owes it to themselves to pick this beer up. I'm impressed, and will definitely look for this one again."
"Pours a copper color with a minimal off-white head and a touch of lacing, though most of the head fades into a thin color. Some light legs as well. The nose is really quite plain with only a bit of bread and some brown sugar. The taste is mildly sweet and has a bit of light booze. Moderate caramel and brown sugar there as well. Mild cherry in the back end. Medium body with low carbonation and a dry finish. Not bad, but not particularly good, either."
"2010 vintage. Pours a mostly clear medium amber with plenty of thick, cream-colored head. Great head retention and lacing. Some active carbonation. Fruity, citrus aroma up front; very sweet smelling with berry notes as well as floral hoppiness. Hints of malt lurk in the background but this one is all hops pretty much. The flavor comes on with a strong malt profile - plenty of bread and dark fruit notes. A cherry-like cloying sweetness quickly follows, only partially covered up with sweet citrus and floral hops. A tad bitter but not nearly enough for the cloying sweetness. This one had great potential but is just too sweet for me."
"O: I went to one of the DuClaw alehouses this past weekend and have a new found interest in their beers after the quality ones I had there. This one didn't disappoint."
"D: Pretty good"
"Drinkability: Its just too hot tasting. Needs a long nap. Not too expensive, but it sits next to Old Guardian and Old Ruffian at the store for the same price, so..."
"DuClaw Devil's Milk has a lovely amber/orange colour and a head that fades in seconds. A small amout of lacing remains around the edge of the glass. The smell is very roasted malt and maybe a hint of hops. This beer starts with roasted malt with hints of charcoal, chocolate orange. The flavour develops some citrus character in the middle but the maltiness remains the strongest flavour. There is a hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. This beer feels thick and syruppy in my mouth. It's a delicious beer, but it's for sipping."
"D - I suppose that after a few years, this ages beautifully. I can assume that the booziness settles down and the dry nature fades a little. Otherwise, being a year old, it isn't bad either. Maturity would certainly do this well, but it drinks rather effortlessly at this point."
"D: This was a nice bold, and balanced barleywine. It had solid body, but it was a bit hot, so it was better to sip. There wasn't anything really unique about it, but it was an enjoyable beer."
"D: Disappointing in many ways, but mainly in missing an opportunity to produce a more distinctive beer. It is good, but doesn't push greatness at all. The malt component is too mellow and lacks the power expected from this style."
"Had on tap at the brewery and at a beer tasting event in MD. I remember this being my first bold beer from DuClaw which was a big hit at the festival when it unveiled and went out in about half hour or less. Pours a big deep orange color with some red hues. Big frothy slightly off white heads with lots of lacing. Aroma is nice, full of big and bold hops. A big punch of citrus and flowers, with a nice caramel malt backbone. Slight hint of yeast as well. Flavor is bitter and sweet at once, and finishes thick and creamy on the palate. Everything about this brew is big, bold, and full of hops. The alcohol warms, but isn't overly boozy. A good bold beer. I will need to try it from the bottle one day. Perhaps in the Fall."
"D- That mouthfeel that I actually love, does take a hit on the drinkability. Not only that, but halfway through that alcohol causes another negative tick mark to come through. Averages it out to be... average. I like it, just isn't amazing. It was fun to tick, and for a brewery no one really talks about I'm happy with what they've done."
"D: Not necessarily my favorite style approach to a beer - the sweet and citrus combination doesn't ""blend"" very well - but this is more ""sessionable"" than most barleywines."
"Sticky medium body with enough carbonation. Not a problem drinking this, adequate amount of warming."
"4/4/4/4/3.5"
"Nice barleywine."
"Pours a hazy deep amber with a slight, sticky head. The aroma is rich and pruny, with a sharp, sweet malt. The flavor is very hot and spicy, with a rich, sweet, peppery malt, with prune and apple and mulled cider. There is a hot, peppery bitterness and a boozy sting on the finish. The mouthfeel is thick and gooey."
"d: I think often times hop forward barleywines are prone to awkward phases between 3 and 9 months after bottling. The hop flavors have faded leaving strong, flavorless bitterness behind. Meanwhile, the malts haven't had time to come together either. With no date on the bottle I can't say for sure that is what happened here, its just speculation on my part."
"Pours a sort of hazy, ruddy brown, with a 1 cm head, tan colored, that falls back pretty fast. Not much lacing. Looks to be the norm, but nothing beyond it there. The smell is nice, toasted sweet nuts come to mind, with bits of orange zest and peel, and some sweet berry flavors as well. I get a lot of caramel in the smell, with raisins, and a little bit of crackery smell too. This one has a hefty malt presence, with a slighty fruity hoppiness. The taste has a bit more of the hoppiness that has come to be the norm in an American Barleywine. It's like eating pollen coated cake. The bitterness is not too strong, thanks to the incredible sweetness, but it does a great job of balancing. There is definitely a flowery presence, and the consistent orange is vary nice in this. The malt is still the winner I believe, which is a nice change of pace. Very bready, and very raisiny as well, with a slightly drying finish, despite the heavy sweetness up front. The body is a nice medium, with pretty low carbonation, which helps to sort of thicken it up and enhance the sweetness. The alcohol provides a nice warmth, but not a burn really. I thought this was a pretty good beer, though way too strong for me to go back for any other beer after it."
"D - I appreciated trying this and it was not a bad barleywine, but for the style I could think of many that outpace this. I prefer a bit more hop in an American if that is what the brewer intended - but it is possible the beer has a little age on it, nice barleywine, thanks for the taste mughugger"
"Pours a nice golden color. Some foam, kind of doesn't retain it, though. Has a little bit of carbonation. Very malty nose, with hints of alcohol, with a smidge of pine. Rather pungent upfront taste. Toffee, pine/hops taste, and a chunk of alcohol in the 1st taste. Sweetness cut with the hops. Very sharp mouthfeel. Sweet abv aftertaste. Solid barleywine. has a pretty good style, and doesn't beat your mouth up on consumption. Thanks to lackenhauser for this one"
"D - This is a really good tasting barleywine. I would like to find more beers from DuClaw."
"D-this is quite tasty and has a big hop profile. It would be an interesting brew to age; but this one is quite tasty fresh and has a very pleasing feel. Very solid beer and great example of an American Style Barleywine."
"Big thanks to ratebeer's GMCC2181 for shipping me this growler! Pours clear copper with thin off white head. The mild aroma is full of citrus hops, spicy to earthy hops and some slick malt sweetness. The taste starts out with smooth earthy to grassy hop flavor and then the bitterness begins to pick up. By midway slick sweet maltiness murmurs up in the background to provide a pleasing level of support for the tasty load of hops. Nice American style Barleywine."
"Overall this is a pretty decent offering from DuClaw and it is nice to see bottles finally on the shelf. Recommended."
"Pours a ruddy amber with just a finger of head. The aroma is very hoppy. The taste reminds me a lot of bigfoot from Sierra Nevada. On the hoppy end of the spectrum as far as Barleywines go. Would be much easier to drink except for the tongue curling syrupy thickness. It's a good drinker, but the thickness forces me to treat this as a sipper. Probably would just get Bigfoot instead of this in the future."
"Drinks very well here- a light bite on the very end but at 11 is great."
"Very drinkable, though slightly more carbonated than other barleywines I've had before. One I definitely will have again."
"Aroma is sweet, fruity, and alcoholic. Taste starts with fruity sweetness, moderate pine hops bite makes a good presence in the middle, and close is warming but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is possibly a touch too slick, could use a bit more body, but drinkability is excellent for a brew of these levels. Dare I say this is a balanced 11% brew? Great stuff."
"Notes: Lack of bottling date aside this seems to be a late 09 or very early 10 release. It is actually a good representation of what has become for some a standard of the US barleywine style i.e. a sturdy malt range with an equally assertive hop profile. Luckily for this one there is a back and forth between both ranges, and the hoppiness does not take over entirely given a pretty nice sweet range, and when it is in command it still has a nice sweet identity as an undercurrent. A bit of aging smoothing the hop profile might make this a much better rounded sipping barleywine."
"Mouthfeel it medium bodied and oily with a nice with a nice bite of carbonation."
"D: Smooth and dangerously drinkable for almost 11% (bottle says 10.6%). My portion (about 7-8 oz) went down very fast. IMHO, a very good example of an American Barleywine. At one point I said to my compatriots, ""I think I like this better than Bigfoot."" And that says a lot."
"Bottle from the free table at Woodshop 5.0. Pours an orangey amber color with very little head. Big dark caramel aroma, with lots of orange hops and toffee. Flavor is caramel, toffee, candied hops, dark fruits, light booze, and pine. Good complexity. Texture is, funny enough, sort of milky. Very creamy and smooth with lowish carbonation. Rich and tasty."
"Received as an extra in a trade with masterchiefMD-thanks much! Pours with little head, nice light copper color.very drinkable barleywine. Low bitterness on the front head with pleasant aroma on the finish. Tastes very pleasant green reminds me of marijuana flavor, or so I've been told ;) I could drink several of these in one sitting. As a barleywine, this one is a bit lacking in body and malt for some BA's but I will definitely pick up more of this next time I visit friends in DC."
"D= very drinkable if you enjoy this interesting style."
"Mild bronze in color. Small and tight off white head. Piney and resiny aroma with a soft caramel hint. Big caramel malty flavor with a large bevvy of hop bitterness. Stand out hop flavor along with bitterness. Solid and slick mouthfeel. Finish is rather dry. Damn solid US barleywine. I might need to run up the road to try on draft. Nice."
"Poured dark brownish with a thin white head which quickly vanished. It was served in a brandy snifter and I had it with dill creamed salmon with walnuts. Smelled kind of like apple cider. Tasted somewhat sweet, but the bitterness built up like alot of stronger sweet beers (Alot of imperial ipas have this hopp bitterness buildup too). This beer was pretty thick almost syrupy. Tasted good enough to drink another but I'd be leary with such a potent monster."
"Each year the Devil's Milk is made with different hops. This year's version is made with Amarillo hops, making it hoppier than usual. It looks like a brown ale and has a modest head that soon disipates. It's hoppy with an almost citrus flavor and added sweetness to compensate. To me it was similar to an American IPA, flavorful and easy to drink, despite the high alcohol."
"Drinkability: Very American and very straightforward in its delivery of brash hop bitterness and ubiquitous alcohol presence."
"From a growler - pours a amber/copper color with a small mostly white head. Smells gloriously hoppy. First sip is all hops backed with a ton of malts. Carbonation is low most likely from being in a growler. The ABV is not hidden, it is in your face. Very well balanced for the style. Tasty and clean this beer is getting better as it warms."
"D-Without question a different beer with 2 years on it than when it is fresh. While I prefer the fresh version with it's stand out hop blast I did enjoy this now caramel/brown sugar malt bomb. A nice sipper and a good one to share with friends."
"This is IMHO, probably the best offering that DuClaw puts out during the year. A robust American Barleywine with great strength behind it, yet remaining a steady and warming sipper. My only complaint is that they serve this way to cold. Let it warm up and enjoy. Good stuff that I'm hoping to grab a couple more glasses of this winter before it's gone."
"D - Definitely a sipper... but aren't all barleywines? I found this one to be quite smooth and drinkable. However, one snifter was enough for me. This definitely benefitted from a bit of aging, in my opinion."
"D: At 11%, this beer is meant for sharing. Deuane, Ffejherb, ksak and I all enjoyed sipping on this one."
"Notes from 12/12/05"
"A very nice sipper that everyone enjoyed. Still have another bottle in the cellar. This one has held up well."
"Aroma smacked me with the sweet malty caramel, moderated with a pine hop. Sweet BW, smooth and slipping down like a 2 year old on the playground slide. No idea that this packs a 11% wallop. Very hard just to sip just a tasty, easy drinking brew."
"One and done for sure, but I look forward to having another. Somewhat similar to Old Ruffian, or maybe a mix of DFH 90 & 120. Lives in that zone of a very sweet DIPA or a very bitter barleywine. Very good, and will have to invite the Devil to the holiday celebrations!"
"Expected a much stronger taste based on past barleywine ales. Was unbelieveably smooth and drinkable. Would have had 2 had the first one not gone directly to my head. Followed it up with a Porter to finish out the visit. Had just stopped by to fill up growlers for tailgating and decided to stay for one (or two)."
"This certainly hides the alcohol quite well, I never would have guessed it was near 12%, though this would never be mistaken for a light weight. The hop character is still fairly vibrant, and this certainly has not picked up much age or oxidation yet. This beer becomes more enjoyable as time goes on; it has become a fitting beer to end the night on."
"Chestnut red in color with 2cm of rich white head, served in a regular 8 oz glass. Smells of sweet caramel and spices. A very strong spice flavor with a caramel sweet finish, alcohol presence noticeable. Very sweet with a medley of spices in each sip. Great taste, lovely lacing on the glass, worth a drink each year when its released."
"Im sad i gave a 3.5 on the drinkability. This is probably more my prefernce than anything, but it seemed just a little (tiny bit) too sweet syrupy for my taste with the style. While Im going to love the growler, for a beer that doesnt come in bombers, 64oz will be just a bit too much for 1 person over 2 days."
"Mouthfeel is medium- to full-bodied, sticky sweet, then some pucker in the middle, and some astringency in the finish, with residual sticky-on-the-lips sweetness. Pleasant sipping. Drinkability is OK, but if I had wanted a second beer it would have been Venom APA."
"Deceptively drinkable. Make no mistake this is one big beer."
"Overall, I didn't dislike the beer. It needs to be bottled, aged and come back to. Very aggressive beer, even for the style."
"Had this from a snifter at Xmas in July. Pours a dark burgandy/brown with a thin head that quickly fades to a small ring, no lacing to speak of. Nice fruity nose---oranges, pineapples, grapes, figs all marked with a distinctive alcohol. As the beer warmed a little a floral hop scent emerged. Taste is a deep sweet caramel malt infused with dark fruits balanced by a decently strong hop bite. Alcohol makes itself known from the getgo, and is a little to agressive for my tastes. Medium bodied with a nice fine carbonation level, this feels great in the mouth. This is a very good effort by Duclaw at the style.."
"Had this at the Maryland Springfest '05. It has a nice dark ruby complexion and the head goes away fast. The volunteers pouring this were wasting too much of it as I stood in line it pissed me off, I wish one of the brewers would have said something. Another thing was that I bought a Devil's Milk snifter and they wouldn't pour the beer in it so I had to transfer from my plastic cup into the snifter. At 11% this barleywine that has several months on it still seems rough. It is definatley an American as the bold C hops are present and there is some nice sweetness left in the malt. The alcohol comes through a little too much as the malt can't contain it and the hops can't mute it. An enjoyable barleywine, something I would buy on occasion."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: Mouthfilling, unctous almost. And so I would have to call this a sipping brew, rather like a fine cognac."
"Drinkability: Not very smooth or contemplative. Very raw for an aged barleywine. This is a rude American interpretation."
"Appearance was quite good. The beer was poured into a special ""Devils Milk"" release glass - a 11oz logo'ed challice. Nice touch. Smell was marked by a strong alcohol scent, along with some firece hops. Taste was good, the archtypical, websters-definition barley wine flavor. (Perhaps this beer was served too early to have developed any real character of its own?) Pretty easy to drink down too, It'd be easy to forget about the 11% ABV. Overall Devils milk is really only a standout as a bone-fide barley wine being brewed and served by a chain brew-pub. Well worth a drink if it's on tap, but not worth an out-of-the-way trip to the brewers."
"This year's Devil's Milk was a little bit disappointing, so I'll have to be sure to try it again next year! Its short head of creamy off-white foam receeds quickly (as might be expected considering its strength), but it still leaves some limited splashes of lace about the snifter. The hazy mahogany body appears darkish on the bar or table but reveals a glowing ring of orangeish gold at the rim as you raise the glass to your lips. The aroma offers some dried apricot and tart baking apples (acetaldehyde) along with a waft of alcohol over a limited amount of malt. The body is medium and it's soft in the mouth with a fine carbonation. Its flavor delivers a well-balanced combination of alcohol; bitterness; and straight-forward, just slightly caramel-touched malt. It finishes dry with some lingering malt, bitterness, and apple."
"Dark Amber with plenty of sweetness and complex malt notes. Pours with a thick head and parallel-line lacing all the way down. The mouthfeel is beautiful and one almost regrets having to swallow. When you do the ample sweetness gradually fades and leaves a tangy finish. Overall among my favorite barleywines with almost no taste of the warming alcohol."
