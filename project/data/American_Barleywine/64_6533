Possibly the best offering outside of the 120 for Dogfish and grand enough to turn me on to the style - if you've never had something of this sort before, this would be an excellent choice to start with.

Super dense, rich, malty aroma with nice dark fruits mingled within.  Did I mention boozy in the nose? Wow!  The flavor is intense.  Heavy malt character hits right away with a maple syrup-soaked biscuit quality. Intensely sweet dark fruits hit mid drink.  Figs and dates, of course.  Hops are mild, even at 85 IBU, underneath the malt fortress.  Hops are earthy with a pine-like, herbal tone.  Medicinal quality in the finish, almost like Nyquil and probably a result of the alcohol.  Dense, syrupy body.  About as thick as beer can get, I think.  Very different.  Would serve well as a winter warmer.  Will try to cellar and compare.  Drink with the utmost care and respect.  Take small sips!","bnes09","Dec 07, 2014"

Taste is sweet caramel, honey and vanilla undertones, fruity, yeast and mild spiced hops, some dark intermingled fruit figs and dates. Palate is full flavored, creamy, smooth and nicely balanced wit good carbonation. The finish is a cornucopia of the aforementioned flavors and aromas, leaves a slight tongue numbing feeling from the alcohol, although it is well behaved. Aging seems to have mellowed it out, which I find enjoyable. Leaves a nice satisfyingly warm feeling. Overall a very good smooth and enjoyable brew.","Samp01","Sep 29, 2014"

4.1,3.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2010A. Pours hazy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, light herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of big fruitiness and dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, herbal, light pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of fruitiness and dark/bready malt sweetness; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barleywine style! All around great complexity and balance of fruitiness and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 30, 2014"

I'd heard this one was hot if you drink it fresh, and based on my experience at six months, I'd have a hard time disagreeing. I wish I had another bottle to sit on a bit longer and see how it was drinking after a year, but for the time being, it's a decent beer. I'd also change the classification, only because the figs add a sweetness that reminded me more of the English style than the super hoppy, bitter American style.","LambicPentameter","Jul 08, 2014"

If they could somehow throw this in some kind of barrel (I'm thinking rye whiskey or Sherry), this would only further reveal its obvious liqueur leaning qualities. Cheers to DFH for experimenting as always, although maybe they should consider packaging some of these strong beers in 6oz bottles for practical purposes.","magictacosinus","Mar 04, 2014"

The beer has a fairly sweet and fruity smell with a hint of alcohol. some hints of dark fruits but sweet malts are the primary smell with a slight hints of hops. The taste is somewhat similar to the smell. Sweet malts dominate the palates with dark fruits and a hint of hops as well as a bit of alcohol as well. The feel is fairly syrupy but still pretty good and smooth. The beer is heavy bodied but still feels lighter than most other barleywine.

Dark fruit, sweet sugary malt and toffee aromas are prominent with butter and boozy notes at the back end. A quick rush of carbonation up front followed by a smooth slightly oily feel through the middle and tangy, boozy heat at the end. Dark fruit flavors up front with toffee flavors added through the middle. Tangy bite in the middle leads candied orange and chardonnay-like pear flavors. Finishes dryly with a tangy, slightly tart fruitiness along with undeniable, but mellow boozy heat.","IronLover","Nov 25, 2013"

They are so awesome tasting that after bringing out a couple, I have quickly brought out the rest and now have only 2 left. When they come out this fall, I will buy up all I can find so I can follow through on my original plan to bring out some at various intervals to enjoy the benefits of aging.","eddzpc","Aug 21, 2013"

It drinks like a cordial rather than a beer, and a potent cordial at that. An 'extreme beer' in that it is very high in abv, but really it's rather one-dimensional and alcohol-driven. But I suppose if you like big beers, that one dimension is pretty good.","ryan1788a5","Aug 11, 2013"

3.94,-0.8,3.75,4,4,3.5,4,"this is a massive barleywine. 2011 vintage here, and I am thinking I should have given it another year or even two to cool out a bit more. this beast is hot! pours a dense amber color with a lot of yeast floating around like fish food, and a prominent off white head over an inch tall but not lasting a real long time. the nose is very alcoholic, predictably so, but there is also some interesting things going on here besides the malt. I pick up a lot of Mediterranean fruit notes, like figs, dates, and drying apples. it is sweet in taste, but not cloyingly so like many colossal barleywines. the dried fruits come through nicely, adding complexity to a huge grain bill and a lot of brown sugar sweetness. the alcohol cuts through everything, and when this beer warms up, it feels like liquor. the yeast adds a lot, and is obviously fairly sturdy, with some white toast sort of elements. decent carbonation really for what this is, and a predictably large body. this is a slow sipper, and even a twelve ounce bottle was a little more than I wanted, so maybe share this with a friend or a lover. I probably should have waited until fall to open this one, but curiosity got the best of me on a warm early summer afternoon. an excellent example of the style, in many ways more enjoyable than say a bolt cutter, with all the fruit happening in this. good effort.","StonedTrippin","May 30, 2013"

There was nothing about the aroma which was overwhelming. In the initial taste, I detected notes of raisin, fig, mild maltiness, and a respectable level of nuttiness. For an American Barleywine, I expected more hops to be in the front. Yet at the same time, I was not disappointed when I discovered with was not a hop-bomb. It reminded me of an English Barleywine. The high level ABV left a warming sensation with the nuttiness progressing toward sour in the finish. This beer makes a great night cap on a cold winter night.

Nice pungent aroma as soon as it was poured. Like a red wine. Not what I was expecting, even though it is a barleyWINE. As I tasted it and let it sit, the more complex the taste and aromas became. It took on more of a red wine character. With the complexity of this one, I really should have reviewed it on the spot. But, unfortunately, it'll be at least a year before I can get another 1 year old Olde School.

Sweet and solvents are the two words I would use to describe this beer. Mouthfeel is somehow worse. Thin, hot, mid level carbonation. If it was going to be that thin it needs to be less carbonated, and it needed a lot more body. Really not a good beer.","Agold","Oct 01, 2012"

The aroma is tart of dark fruits, like figs, raisins. The taste is sweet and strong of dark fruit and booze. The mouth feel is very thick on the tongue.

I would probabley enjoy this one a bit more on a cold Saturday night in late January or February, but tonight will have to do.","DrStiffington","Jan 08, 2012"

The smell is very boozy. Aside from that, there are smells of sweet dark fruits. The first sip starts off real sweet, but is immediately overwhelmed by a lot of alcohol bite. I would say it's almost too much, but I do prefer stronger beers. That being said, I would love to try one of these with a year or two on it. There is a weird sticky mouth feel that is left behind after swallowing. Overall, this is an interesting barley wine. Probably a little too hot for most, but it does have some interesting flavors and would probably be better with a year or two on it.","pjs234","Jan 06, 2012"

Pours a translucent ruby/carmel color with the thinnest of heads that leaves but trace amounts of lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose is a mix of caramel and alcohol. You KNOW this is one boozy bastard. The taste affirms the smell, this is an alcohol bomb. There's some subtle hints of caramel, toffee, and vanilla, but the alcohol dominates through and through. This right here will take the chill off any December day, regardless of the line of latitude upon which you reside. The mouthfeel is hot as hell. Let a mouthful of this rest on your palate for 10-15 seconds, and it feels like the insides of your mouth are being dissolved. It's very astringent and has a monster bite.The aftertaste is just...boozy. Someone could smell this on your breath from several meters out. Don't drink this and expect a pleasant response from the po-po if you can pulled over on the way home. Overall, this is a pass. Not a big fan. I'd recommend sharing even a 12 oz. bottle among 3-4 people. I will say, I'd be curious as to what this could turn into after being layed down for 5 years. But, it needs time. It needs something.

Taste is much better than the nose- the same profile really opens up here. Very balanced and enjoyable. Alcohol is present, but not overpowering at 15%. Feel is medium with a nice alcohol burn to it.

3.62,-8.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The second surprise bottle cracked during the lastest Bliss tasting. Right on, Scott! It pours a mostly clear sunrise amber topped by a finger or so of dusty cream foam. The nose comprises buttery toffee, alcohol, figs, raisins, other dark fruits (it smells just as vague as that sounds), white bread, light menthol, and honey. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a touch of minty pine running down the back, possibly the result of the booze mixing with everything else on my tongue. The alcohol burn is a bit too present for my liking here. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decently syrupy feel. Overall, a pretty okay beast of a b-wine, but the booze is too present, and the bold flavors never truly meld all that well together. Close, though...","TMoney2591","Oct 10, 2011"

Taste all that with a blast of grapefruit / lemon. Plenty of body, good amount of life for the high ABV, on the dryer side. It leaves you wondering if you are impressed or dumbfounded. Probably both, planning on drinking this batch in 18 half years when my son turns 21. A unique & perplexing beer, wouldn't recommend to many.

I remember the beer being a brownish color with a yellowish white head that had a light sticky lacing. The sme of the beer was monstrous, lots of malts and hops mixed with booze and some sweet dark fruits. The taste of the beer was also way over the top for me at the time. It was malty and sweet upfront, as it settled into my tounge it left a tingling sensation with a bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel had a really thick feeling body to it.

Pours a deep amber with a very minimal off-white head. Aromas is sweet dark fruit, with plums, raisins, dark cherries, and alcohol dominating the nose. The dark fruits continue on the palate, but are joined by some caramel and toffee flavors. This beer is very sweet and syrupy, but not overly cloying. It goes down really smooth, with just a slight alcohol burn….I'm not sure if it's the aging that has taken away some of the alcohol burn, but if I didn't know this was a 15% brew, I wouldn't have guessed it.

I'm sensing an almost port-like aroma that resembles raisins and figs. A stinging amount of alcohol infiltrates my nostrils and attacks them. A bit harsh. The taste is beastly. Some sweet caramel malts are matched with the dark fruit characteristics noted in the nose. Again, the 15% is boldly showing itself here and i can feel it on my lips, in my throat and belly, and in my head already! Wow, this one's hot. The mouthfeel is pleasantly smooth and full-bodied. Overall, this brew offers some unusual characteristics but is quite hot and could use some more time down in the cellar. It lacks drinkability due to the harsh booze effect.

For such a high ABV this is dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is noticeable but it helps warm up the palate, which really compliments the dark and burnt flavors.

My assumption is that the aging really helps balance out the flavors. I'm sure the flavors come out more once it becomes more room temperature. If I did have this again, it'd be a special occasion, or just something to sip on for an hour or 2 because of the buzz. In the end, I would recommend people to try this.

The start of this bottle made me think the beer was fading away. The second pour makes me feel like it needs a good bit more age. I’ve never experienced this, though I normally don’t open with such a small pour, but either way I’m not sure what would have happened if I used a larger glass that could hold the whole bottle. The flavors here aren’t overly complex, but they contain a great deal of nuance and subtlety beneath the high abv. Much like Immort Ale from Dogfish, this is a beer to age before even considering drinking it.","bobhits","May 28, 2011"

4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"2004 bottle, thanks Doug. Pours a peach pink color with a lasting white cap. Nose is abundantly sweet, full of raisins, grapes, peaches, caramel malt. Flavor is dry in comparison, still lots of fruit sugars especially an interesting peach quality. Not too heavy but syrupy enough. Some cardboard oxidation has crept in after seven years in the bottle.

Retention is good and there is a fair bit of lacing left behind. The nose is big on toffee and caramel, with some resinous pine hop notes providing balance. There's a distinct booziness cutting through everything though, and giving me pause. Yeah, everything is in place for a great barleywine. Rich, deep malt flavors (again, caramel/toffee are the main offenders) almost perfectly offset by an aggressive hop bite (the bitterness is spot on, but I could have stood for some more late addition hops). All of that is trampled over by the beer's abrasive alcoholic presence. As one might expect from a beer with such a malt backbone, the body is incredibly rich and full. Unfortunately, the carbonation isn't quite up to the task, it's a bit too subdued. The result is a definite syrupy quality to the beer. I've had aged Olde School before, which is absolutely sublime. Unfortunately the alcohol is a bit too pronounced fresh for it to be a great beer.","axeman9182","Jan 09, 2011"

This has the aroma of a good American Barleywine, at least a 15% BW. Smooth, warm aromas from the alcohol. Fruit and candy sugar notes from the malt. Not much in the hop department on this one. For such a strong brew, the alcohol hides pretty well. Also, notes of orange zest, possibly the hops I was looking for. Damn this is sweet! Alcohol heat and a strong malt bill dominate the first sip, the alcohol warm closes it out. Notes of orange rinds, possibly burnt rinds. The alcohol heat is accompanied by some spiced flavors. This beer, for it's size, ain't too shabby. It does a good job of hiding 15% better than some beers, whose alc% are even lower than 15. Aside from that this seems to come off as an English style Barleywine on steroids. There's nothing 'American' about this beer, definitely the English style comes to mind, not a bad thing.

Creamy mouthfeel is the first thing I notice when I sip this beer. Warming effects of the booze. Smooth flavor, more fresh apples and grapes than dried candied fruits.

Oh wait I forgot, beer doesn't have calories. Thick body and medium carbonation. All that sugar and alcohol don't make for the most drinkable of brews, but whatever.

There are also some very nice malt notes with some maple and caramel coming through. Guessing this could develop into a very deep malty and fruity beast. Taste is quite sweet, almost cloyingly sweet. The hops seem to pair with the alcohol heat, while the malts provide the backbone. This one sure gets to the nasal cavity with its heat. It has a great brown sugar flavor with a caramel thickness. Super sweet but my nose is burning from the alcohol. Has a mouthfeel of melted brown sugar, quite viscous but silky smooth.

Big sugar alcohols. Mead-like. Some notes of baked apples. Solvent-like. Acetone (yes, nail polish remover.) The booze actually burns the eyes as the vapors rise. Dark rum-soaked raisins. Cherries. Flavor hits with a rush of hot booze, like ultra-octane apple cider, dark cherries, fig jam, vodka-infused plums, tej/honey-wine-like notes... Shit... this is boozy in all kinds of ways. Spiked maple syrup... There's a late tannin-like astringency that sticks all over the tongue and ushers in the finish, which wraps things up with grape skins, chewed lemon seeds, blonde tobacco, and alcohol burn/heat, and an indefinitely-lasting acetone impression and burn. No lie, this is like nail polish remover in the aftertaste. This batch was bottled November 2008. Reviewed 11 months after bottling. Still very, very hot. I will wait at least 2 years before trying my next bottle. I've had vintages from 2006 or so, when they were still young, and I recall enjoying them much more than this one. Interesting for the shock factor, but this was not a pleasurable experience. There's extreme, and then there's mischief. This beer seems to be headed toward the latter. An odd juxtaposition with the vintage imagery and ""olde school"" reference in the name--this is not olde school. Nor is it new school. This is out of control do-it-yourself ""home school"" where you spike your beer with liquor to create a homebrew beer cocktail (while your girlfriend takes off her nail polish...)","AdvocateFan","Oct 12, 2009"

The booziness doesn't have anything to hide behind. The flavor reminds me of the beer version of a mediocre port. It's as if Dogfish Head's goal was simply to create a huge barleywine, rather than to create the best barleywine possible. Admittedly, that's completely an issue of personal taste, and I very much appreciate DFH's willingness to experiment in the so-called ""extreme"" side of the beer world. It's beers like this that expand brewing for everyone and lead to industry-wide innovation. That said, this beer is entirely too syrupy, sweet and boozy for me.

3.83,-3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"A clear mahogany color with a fair off-white head and nice lacing. The aroma is almost shocking, very much like a Belgian rather than a barleywine, clove and malt with alcohol predominate. The taste is a nice grapefruity malt and clove with lots of alcohol. It has a full body feel, almost oily, with understated carbonation but the 15% alcohol is quite a major theme here. Not to be sessioned needless to say. Certainly another quality brew from DFH, but as usual, so much alcohol is not a natural balance and I think it buries the potential of this otherwise tastey brew. As it is this one is a nice choice for something different if you like a strong beer.","Durge","Feb 25, 2009"
2.85,-28.2,4,4,2,3.5,2.5,"12 oz., conditioned, bottled on 10/16/06 and sampled at almost a year-and-a-half old. It pours into the snifter dark amber, nearly clear, with medium carbonation, and a frothy inch of tan head that reduces to a compact collar and leaves a few traces of lacing. Very fruity in the nose, with a heavy helping of malts and ethanol. It starts with raisins and figs, followed by a touch of aroma hops, and finishing with apricot and apple esters. On the palate there is a huge dose of warming, peppery alcohol that is pretty harsh. Some of the pleasing aspects from the scent are present, and there are some tasty notes here and there, but there is way too much alcohol to make this taste good. The body is acceptable: heavy and fairly dry, with consistent carbonation, and as far as drinkability is concerned - each sip feels like a shot, and the finish leaves me almost breathing flames. This is a beast of a beer that probably takes a good five years to become easily drinkable, but at 1.5 years old, it is still very harsh.","mmmbeer","Feb 23, 2009"

This is one that I'll definitely be sipping over the next hour or so. Alcohol is the last thing to taste, but once it diminishes the finish consists of some citrus hop and malt and that sweet canteloupe nectar. Carbonation is low, so low that I don't notice it until its looked for, were it higher it would ruin the beer and take away from the flavor and give this beer a feel that is wrong for the taste. Body is medium, lightened by the presence of high alcohol. This is one that I'll gladly drink more of and I'll recommend it to any who are looking for a great barleywine.","becktone","Feb 22, 2009"

But, now that I think about it, would I swap this for the 120 Minute at half the price? Uh, most likely. They share some similarities. It's too good a value at $5 or less to pass up. Some beers are great because they have their own unique flavor that's hard to describe, and others are great because they taste like so many other things. This one falls in the latter.

It was fairly watery with no carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was a very extreme beer with potent alcohol, but was ok to sip. It had nice flavor but was a bit harsh, which will hopefully mellow with age. It had decent body, but I would have preferred something a bit fuller.

The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some spice and plums I can taste. Just like the aroma it's a sweet/boozy tasting beer, and I mean that in a good way. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy, rich and syrupy. Drinkability is good enough (it's definitely a sipper), but the alcohol takes away from the drinkability a bit.

The flavor is sweet and sharp, almost sour, nice and bitter. There is a kind of a caramely sweetness, but at this abv, it could easily be from the tons of pale malt in the beer. The hop flavor is there, but subdued, and a bitter chocolatey flavor comes through in the finish. Considering the alcohol content, the alcohol flavor is well masked, but at 15% it's pretty hard to hide, and it's definitely there.

Dried fruits, sweet apples and some caramel flavor dominate the taste in both. The beer is certainly heavy with lots of syrupy alcohol.

Some slight citrus and herbal notes from the hops as well. On the palate, it is slick, sweet and something to really sip and think about. It reminds me a bit of 120 min except maltier and slightly toastier. I understand the difficulty of brewing a drinkable beer that is an excess of 11%, and that it will be exceptionally sweet. That being said, if it was classified as an old ale, I really enjoy it. No, it's not balanced, but quite a fine sipper.

The alcohol warming is much lower than I was expecting, with only a light alcoholic bite and minimal astringency. It's very well hidden for 15 per cent. The aftertaste is full, syrupy, sweet and full of raisin flavors. This is a big beer. Definitely invites sipping from a snifter like a cognac. Really no other way to drink it.

Had a bit of a cognac smell buried in the background. Maybe a bit of leather and dried tobacco as well. Pretty good flavor as well. Quite a bit hoppy, thick malt, plum, raisin, some woody notes, with a sweet caramel like flavor in the background. All of this finishes with a tremendous spicey alcohol burn.

Pous fine - a thick toffee body, and a head whichis so brief it scarcely needs mentioning. Flat and still looking in my glass with no lacing. Smells of toffee apples and alcohol - a touch of that DFH ""reisling."" Tastes very rich and malty. Alcohol does not make its presence known in the taste, but it is there, and it warms the belly. This is a very smooth drinking beer, with no carbonation, but the richness of the malt makes this a real sipper. Took me a good part of the afternoon to finish this. A beer of this size and strength is a bit indulgent for one person.","Onibubba","Jul 16, 2007"

Whatever else is in the aroma is overpowered by alcohol. This translates into the flavor. The malt and hop flavors are again overpowered by the alcohol, but the balance is better as the beer warms. Leaner flavors than a lot of barley wines and the alcohol hits pretty hard. Winter is really a better time for this beer. It warms you all the way down into the stomach.

Aroma is deceptively mild, a little banana, maybe some of the date/fig combination. Huge flavor of dates and figs, and unapologetic alcohol whack. Borders on being a little harsh, but this is a change of pace beer, and to me that sensation really just wakes up the tongue. Crisp, intensely fruity aftertaste.

Smell is very malty with an aromatic sweetness. Aroma is fragrant and estery with a subtle note of vanilla. However, there is an underlying acetone smell to the aromatics rising out of this beer. Taste is very sweet and alcoholic with grapefruit flavors. Mouthfeel is sticky, yet crisp and the high alcohol content leads to an almost burning warmth that is sure to revisit as heartburn.

Very sweet smelling up front - dark fruit, grapes, honey, and small floral character as well. Taste is very sweet up front - port and brown sugar, but there is a nice dry hop balance as it finishes. Mouthfeel is chewy and well carbonated, which offers a nice complement to the chewy sweetness. At 15%, I would be lying if I said it was hidden.

Slight alcoholic note, but this is after my 7th or 8th deep inhale. Give me a few more minutes of sniffing...OK I'm back. Flavor - surprisingly light after such a powerful scent. It's incredible that this body and flavor come from this beer. Actually well balanced, decent bitterness to support the malt; finishes with a lingering metallic note and a touch of rubbing alcohol, but it's not really detracting from the flavor. But this is the antithesis of the overly sweet big barleywine. It reminds me of a beer with a touch of vodka - still powerful, but not heavy bodied. Mouthfeel is good; very impressive lighter body for such a big beer. Drinkability is actually very good. This drinks more like a strong amber ale than one of the stronger barleywines available.

The taste is surprisingly dry and bitter. There is sweetness here, but it doesn't predominate. The initial impression is that this needs more time in the bottle. As my example was bottled on 11/16/06, I'm sure that's true. A dry bitterness to start followed by sweet malt and alcohol then some spicy hops followed by a sticky maltiness.

The smell is a little grassy and some fruit, with a little bit of alcohol. The older bottle had less fruit and more grassiness. The new one reminded me of thick champagne.

The taste is much the same as the smell, actually in some senses it reminds me of certain tripels Ive had I think mainly because of the bready notes and the ester quality. For me the real questionable issue is the amount of alcohol, which is defiantly present more so in this than almost any other beer Ive had, in both the taste and the smell. The mouth feel is all right, but there is definite too much alcohol. Honestly I was a little disappointed. I love that DFH is so daring with their brews, but other than novelty sake, this beer is lacking the balance necessary for a super great drink. Coupled with the fact that this is a hard to get beer and expensive I doubt Ill buy this again, but its worth a try for novelty sake","mmcave","Nov 11, 2006"

Pours a murkey orange with a medium head and little to no lacing. Smell is strong with fruit and alcohol presence as well as toasted malts and brown sugar. Taste is much of the same with a heavy alcohol presence and I definately pick up on the fig notes.

After going to a cocktail party, and not having anything alcoholic to drink, because there wasn't a decent beer there, I treated myself to an Old School. Poured it into a pint glass (I know, I know) and sat down and relaxed. My wife laughed when I said it was the perfect beer for a 33 degree night. It looked beautiful, and very lightly aromatically hopped. Low carbonation, but nice, respectable head. Thought I tasted a hint of raisons, but it turned out, according to DFH, to be figs. This is a dangerous beer, as it goes down deceptively smoothly, with just a hint of an alcoholic after taste - more of a warming effect than a burn. I am glad I have 5 more bottles.","BusyNinja","Nov 05, 2006"

Smells strong, and sweetly malty, with a fruity, hoppy punch. A nice big nose, aggressive and inviting. Big flavor too..I've had another aged Olde School once before and this evokes memories of that experience. Big alcohol presence, but the alcohol is wrangled handily by the complexity of flavors. Big fig and prune punch, with a large grassy bitterness. Bitterness is still strong at this 1-year stage, but more reserved than when new. Sweet, sweet malt, like tasting malt syrup from the can. Hints of maple, strawberry, anise, ethanol. Big syrupy mouthfeel, though not as syrupy as some other DH beers. A sipper of a barley wine, but a delicious one. I was forced to drink this before I had planned to due to moving across the country, but it still didn't disappoint, not by a long shot. Very nice.","aforbes10","Jul 26, 2006"

In some ways I give this the same kind of pass I give Sierra Nevada beers - DFH are going to put their own stamp on everything they do, and a little extra sweetness seems to go with this.

Still has a bit of carbonation after its stay in the cellar, and right now the mouthfeel is excellent. Very drinkable at this age, though it's still a bit hot.

The head subsided in a few minutes to a thin white frost which leaves a decent looking ring of lace on the sides of the glass. I thought the smell was magnificent!! Very fruity and sweet, it certainly tempted me. I was not expecting such fruit. The taste, too, was sweet and fruity, but nearly as sweet as the smell, which is good, seeing that that would probably have been overpowering. There is a bit of noticeable alcohol, but at 15%, I think DFH did a fabulous job concealing such power!! Very manageable to be so strong.

That dwindles after a bit and the sweetness of this brew starts to dominate. Actually, it's a bit too sweet. It also has a decent amount of carbonation for a barley. This is a good one to pair with some cheese or any other food that would subdue the sweetness and alcohol. However, I'd take an Immort Ale over this.

The flavor was dominated by sweetness, almost cloying, with a touch of bitterness at the end. The beer seemed a little one-dimensional, and was a little disappointing.

I knew Olde School would do the job with its whopping 15% ABV. Ive grown found of drinking Barleywines out of shaker pints (something about the way it warms up, and the feeling of having all that barleywine under your nose at once) so thats what this one went into. The body of this beer is a bit more translucent and less red than many other barleywines Ive seen. Still with the tiny bottle-conditioned carbonation bubbles streaming to the top, it is a sight to see. The robust eggshell head from the pour rapidly recedes into a solid ring around the outside of the pint. The nose is heavy with fusel alcohol aromas, doesnt turn me off though. A closer whiff reveals figs, nuts, berries, grapefruit and pine. This beer is rich with hefty malt flavors across the front of the palate (caramel, grain, toffee). The bitterness level is great, exactly what I look for in a good barleywine and the pine and grapefruit hop flavors are very assertive as well . I also pick up some nuttiness , berries and figs in the flavor, this is right before alcohol crashes on my tongue and hits my nose from the inside out. Warmth rapidly (and welcomely) spreads down my gullet. Personally I think this is a great barleywine.

However, this isn't Apple Pucker. At the same time, it's surely not something to mess with. It's ""beer"" indeed, but some have said it has the more qualities in line with a brandy or bourban, and to a certain degree I agree. Now that I think about it though (especially if you're just buying a 4-pack, because since it's a seasonal / limited Dogfish Head brew it comes in 4-packs), I'd suggest letting it rest in the fridge for at least a day. Then break it out, let it rest outside the fridge for 15 minutes, pour it into a glass, take huge whiffs of both the empty bottle right after poured and the glass right after it's filled, sip slowly, and enjoy both the power and the complex tastes and aromas.","asabreed","Jan 07, 2005"

The taste carrys some of the familiar fruity sweetness from the nose along with a spicy alcohol interlude which reminds you to show respect. In the back end you have the lovely barley taste I look for in the style with just enough hops to balance the whole thing out. I was honestly expecting a hoppier beer because its from DFH and its another one of their ""big beers", but I wasn't entirely let down, there's enough acidity to make up for the hops I'm missing. The moutfeel is thick, slick and ""chewy"" all at once. This one coats everything from the lips down like a fine brandy. Drinkability is high considering this beer is 30 proof.

3.87,-2.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured into a large snifter, this beer is remarkably clear and light in color for a barleywine. What foam is created with the pour falls to ring of bubbles. The first whiff of the aroma is full of an intense malt, with some sawddust-like phenolic notes. I like my stronger beers to have some more intense aromatics than usual and this Olde School Barleywine fits the bill. The first sip is thick, but not cloying, with a slick finish. A slight warming effect from the alcohol (I would expect more this sensastion in such a strong brew) with the intense maltiness found in a fine Scotch. The flavors of this elixir have more in common with bourbon than beer. That's not a bad thing. Think of a highly attenuated Double IPA mixed with a little Scotch whisky and that's what you've got in this beer. I've had some ver full-bodied and complex English barleywines and some powerfully hoppy and complex American barleywines. This beer in neither, and is usual for Dogfish Head, is in a class by itself. It's actually a pretty drinkable beer, for such a high alcohol content, but that's sort of a dangerous thing. Beware: thou art mortal!","marcobrau","Nov 26, 2004"
3.99,0.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Clear amber, not much head. Extremely enjoyable aroma, I didnt see that one coming. A fine cigar, a campfire and a deep immort ale like maltiness with all this caramel and maple syrup richness and even some kind of meaty goodness going on. Feels 10% or so, great job there! In mouth: melon bubblegum, soothing oily hops, piney, vegetal which develops sip after sip into a larger and larger tongue-coating bitterness. Nevertheless, those huge malts never miss a meeting, it remains very sweet (caramel.. smoked maple), just very bitter at the same time and in good proportions. Oily fuelic body, fair amount of carbonation. Adopt an hypercaloric beer today.","Rastacouere","Nov 21, 2004"

It had a full rich white head the receded quickly, but several champagne bubbles tried to renew the head from the bottom of the glass. A swirl of the glass or a tip to drink left a thick sheet of lace. I get lots of fruit on the nose; a hint of citrus, but maybe some apples (from the malt perhaps?). The taste has more of the citrus/apple flavor, but it also introduces some floral/pine character of the hops in the front of the taste, malt after that, with just a touch of candy, and a very mild hop bite along with just a touch of alcohol bite. Surprisingly light mouth feel. This has a big alcohol kick, but is very drinkable despite that. One of the best if this style Ive had from a bottle.","carln26","Nov 20, 2004"

A slight haze is notable due to bottle conditioning. An intense maltiness and alcohol aroma are immediately detectable if your nose is anywhere near the beer. The smell is really something: intense sensations of alcohol steeped fruits (plums, apples, berries, figs), molasses, sugar, grain. Hop aromas are present, but restrained (East Coast Barleywine?). Although the smells are strong and agreeable, they lack the depth and smooth layering that some barleywines present. Instead, they seem rough-edged and jumbled together. Sweet, thick, syrupy, spicyvery nice taste. Its certainly mouth-coating and heavy. Also, the alcohol is at a point where it can almost become tongue-numbing. Finish is moderately hoppy and bitter, but restrained for the stylethe alcohol plays a notable part in the hind-taste.

Aroma was very sweet, much like an apple cider. Sweet malts and a bit of alchohol blend perfectly with the very fruity nose. Flavor is much like the aroma, but with a richer bouquet of fruit aspects which range from apple and concord grapes to a darker, plum-like malty finish. Slight warmth on the throat is the only sign of the very high ABV, which is attractively higher than many other barleywines that I have tried. Mouthfeel is heavy and syrupy, and this aspect is balanced nicely by the high level of fine carbonation. I'll be damned if I am not hugely tempted also by the label's suggestion to bury a couple bottles to allow them to age - that would make for an exciting little time capsule.

The golden brown ale formed a fair amount of head but seemed a bit light in color for the style. The aroma was dominated by alcohol and citrus notes. The flavor was built on a creamy sweet malt body with a cloying amaretto hop presence and a noticeable (but not 15% noticeable) alcohol presence. It was a medium bodied, slippery and slimy brew. A passable brew, but not outstanding.

This poured a nice deep orange color with a huge frothy head that dropped quickly to a bubbly collar. There was decent lacing left in this as I drank it. HOLY SWEETNESS, the nose is strong with a fruity malt sweetness that almost completely dominates the smell. Even after warming the only other smell I could detect was the slightest hint of alcohol. Taste is much the same as the smell, extremely sweet with fruity malts a little too much so even. Slight earthy hop notes can be found as well, but the 15% sure stays hidden in this one. A nice slightly bitter finish is present to try and tame the sweetness. Olde School has a very full and rich mouthfeel that coats your mouth with sweetness. Insane drinkability for a 15% but the sweetness was starting to be a little much for me by the end of the glass.

The taste is much sweeter than a ""normal"" barleywine, and tastes of vanilla extract and corn syrup / maple syrup with the faintest touch of hops in the finish. Carmelized sugar and some fruity esters of peach and pear come through. The alcohol content sticks out, but not in way you might expect (like fumes burning your nostrils). It lightly warms and makes this immesely filling. The mouthfeel is rich and yet thin, giving the most telltale signs of the high abv. But 15% ? I've had harsher 9% barleywines.

2.62,-34,3.5,4,2,2.5,2,"While I am a huge Barleywine fan, I just do not like this beer at all. It is sickening sweet. Color is a nice amber with a small foam white head. Smell is that of Apricot an fruit. The taste is very fruity, some yeast and no hop taste to be found. Tastes like something went wrong with this beer. I have tried it twice to make sure I did not get a bad batch and it was the same. Would not try again.","Jdiddy","Apr 15, 2003"
4.6,15.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Wow. This beer delivers the goods in every way .Golden honey color and very translucent. Looks thick but lighter in color than your average barlywine. The smell is sweet & floral, but the taste opens up with all sorts of fruity flavors!! Mango is heavy at the end..Yum!. The mouthfeel is great on account of all the flavor keeping your tastebuds working overtime. Would love to drink all night, too strong...damn! I would never guess 15% on this one. Awesome!!","avylover","Mar 16, 2003"
4.87,22.7,4.5,5,5,5,4.5,"So stoked to see this on tap so I just had to have it. Tastes ever so smooth. Very fruity. The 15% is so well hidden. This is one of my all time favorite brews. It needs a bit of age, but it is damn good young aswell. If you see this on tap, snap up the chance to have yourself a glass. Otherwise, buy two of the the corked bottles and bury one as per directions on the bottle.","scottum","Mar 15, 2003"
3.58,-9.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Turbid dark amber hue, topped by a vanilla white head foam rim. Bubbles rise lazily due to the high apparent viscosity. Ripe, peachy esters upfront in aroma, ensued by pine laced citrusy hops and a waft of mellow caramel and butterscotch. Hints of biscuit and heaty fusels surface as the beer breathes. Surprisingly tame aromawise. Mild toffeeish, melanoidin sweetness at first in flavor morphs into a fructose laden candy like, fruity, red licorice impression. Mellow carob and butterscotch undertone initially complements the light caramel and biscuit malt presence, but diacetyl becomes progressively more pronounced and begins to dominate. Mild hop bitterness leaves residual sweetness mostly uncontested. Muted floral hop flavor, with a herbal tinge. Full bodied, with a creamy, tongue coating, heavily dextrinous mouthfeel. Quite heavy on the palate. Finishes with a snap of bready malt yielding to an oily melange of hot butter and maple syrup. Olde School is quite an odd, but enjoyable brew. It's reminescent of a barleywine and hot toddy combination. It eventually weighs heavily on the palate, partially due to the pronounced diacetyl and unhindered residual sweetness. A fine bellywarmer nonetheless.","marc77","Mar 11, 2003"
3.97,0,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Overall a nice Barley Wine that balances malt and bitterness along with alcohol very well. IMHO it is a little rough around the edges though. Perhaps ageing will make this a most exceptional Barley Wine. The alcohol does sneak up on you; so beware.","purplehops","Mar 08, 2003"
4.3,8.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A very, very tasty barleywine in the lighter color, fruity-malt vein. Hides its alcohol better than the Raison D'Etre, which is a bit more than half as strong.","sponberg","Feb 18, 2003"
3.9,-1.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability & Notes: Big flavours are bursting with aleish ripeness, where is the 15% abv? There is alcohol there but I have had smaller barleywines that can’t hide the alcohol like this. Watch out on this one as it catches up with you.","Jason","Feb 17, 2003"
3.53,-11.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a thin, short lived white head over lightly hazy gold/copper-colored liquid. Nose is a bit musty, apricot-ish and other fruits too. Taste is surprisingly on the thin side for a beer of such alcoholic content. Notes of fruitiness, tartness and malt blend together, with a winey flavor popping up in the mix. Hoppiness lays in the background, not dominating at all. Alcohol heat and flavor is very unexpectedly subdued here. Finishes up with sweetness that dries out just slightly in the end, an average barleywine at best.","beerluvr","Feb 17, 2003"
3.76,-5.3,4,3,4,4,4,"Another really interesting offering from our friends in Slower Delaware. Medium copper in color, just a trace of head (though, to be honest, there was more than I expected given the 15% potency). The smell is surprisingly mild, though certainly not offensive in any way. In a way it smells a bit like (and this is kind of odd) Orange Crush. In fact, upon the first taste that's exactly what popped into my head -- a rather hyped up version of Orange Crush. Not necessarily bad, just different. Of course, there are other flavors in there, such as molasses, tropical fruits, some subtle hop bitterness. And yes, alcohol, but not nearly as biting as you might expect from a beer of this strength, which perhaps makes it just a tad dangerously drinkable.","mophie","Feb 16, 2003"
3.65,-8.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"No bruises are left after the 15% pounding. Tauntingly drinkable, and wrath-masking.","cokes","Jan 13, 2003"
4.02,1.3,4,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a slightly hazy peachish/orange color with some smallish floaters in there as well and a minimal creamy white head that sinks to the thinnest of films. Sweet malty and fruity aromas with some spiced apple and slightly alcoholic undertone. Thick maltiness and a big apple and vinous fruitiness still has a tough time of masking the 15% alcohol. However the alcohol only has a nice warming effect which is perfect for a cold day like today. Apples and some slight spiciness give this a nice winter touch. Smooth warmth from the alcohol and malt give this an amazing drinkability for its strength. Excellently drinkable brew. This is damn good for being as young as it is. I am definitely looking to get some of this and put it away.","Murph","Jan 11, 2003"

3.9,-1.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"15.5% ABV - touted as ""The world's strongest naturally carbonated beer", partially made possible through fermention in the secondary, and priming with the yeast from the World Wide Stout (which contains Champagne yeast). A cloudy, peach colored body is topped by a thick and creamy off-white head. The aroma is quite fruity with notes of raisins and figs, but some higher alcohols are clearly present as well. The body is medium/full with a very fine carbonation that leaves it quite creamy in the mouth. The flavor is rich and sweet with loads of caramel, molasses and maple syrup as well as some fruitiness and a tingling in the mouth & warming in the throat from the alcohol. The sugary flavors linger in the long lasting  finish. Very nicely done with interesting fruit characteristics and a nice sweetness, but the alcohol is a bit too ""hot"" to give it any real drinkability. Still, very unique and worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Oct 10, 2002"
4,0.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Touted as the worlds strongest naturally fermented barleywine.  The brew is made with dates and figs, this sugar naturally punps the abv.. to what I don't know (sorry).  This brew was brewed in June and bottled in Sept. it will be released Dec. 10 in bombers.  Beige in color with a nive tan lace, the beer has a malty alcohol nose with a little hops in the back of the nose.  Smooth silky fruity taste (figs) with lots of malt in your mouth.  Thick and fruity.. this brew has a big bold finish.  Not as dry on the tongue as many other BW's I've tasted.  The brew does numb the tongue.  I think this will greatly improve with more time in the bottle.  A review edit will be done as I cellar one of these for next year!!","frank4sail","Oct 10, 2002"
