Thick, sweet malts have a wonderfull toastiness and richness, while the dark fruits add a great sweetness to the beer. There is a slight hop bitterness present in its current state, but by no means does it add too much bitterness. There is a great balance to this beer, warming alcohol touch as well.","OrangeMen","Nov 29, 2014"

Maybe it was because this was from a tap and not out of a bottle but i was surprised at how amazingly smooth this was for a (just barely) 10+%abv barley wine.  Not quite as in your face as some barley wines I have tried, but not in a bad way.  The taste has prominent notes of malt, fig, raisin & plum with a slight bite on the finish.  Slightly sweet up front and very smooth.  I did not think it had much of a boozy taste to it, but after finishing 16oz. I was definitely feeling it.  Overall I thought this was a nice, if not slightly lighter barley wine.  Recommend giving it a try if you come across it.","Pourharddrinkslow","Nov 20, 2014"

Deep chocolate and oak notes contribute to the palate before sipping. My tongue notes: beets, allspice, and tart cherries; Spicy tannins and noticeable wood elements.  The spice and oak definitely give the sweet toffee, etc. elements a grounded earthiness. Could be cloying on a hot summer night, especially after beer has warmed a bit. Velvety, otherwise, with good carbonation.","orcrist_cleaver","Oct 21, 2014"

3.75,-8.8,,,,,,"The beer pours a dull dark brown with copper hues and a thin tan head that fades quickly. The nose is fruit and caramel grain sweetness forward, with a hint of metallic bitterness, and booze as it warms. There is similar sweetness that dominates the palate while drinking, but also biting bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is where this beer seems to suffer most - lowly carbonated yet metallic, bitter, and slightly soapy - attributes which don't not make for a pleasant finish. It's otherwise relatively drinkable for being a big beer with an abv that creeps beyond 10%. I admire the style in a non-barrel aged, accessible, six pack format, but prefer other examples more.","ThePorterSorter","Aug 27, 2014"

This is a malt bomb and don't pick up hops until the aftertaste. I enjoy the transition of flavors between caramel/brown sugar, dark fruits, and molasses. The latter gives off a very nice touch and is what made it exceptional in my opinion. I imagine a bourbon aged version would be spectacular.

Very sweet and alcohol in the nose, somewhat like wheat bread and some fruity apple like-ness. Sweeter in the beginning a little bitter from the burnt caramelized taste, with some chocolatey undertones. Some hops are in there but just enough to offset the sweetness of the malt. The alcohol also helps to balance out the sweetness. This was great and enjoyed with good friends, good for a winter time ale.","cambabeer","Jan 23, 2014"

The nose of this beer is deep and malty. Some hoppiness but it is definitely overwhelmed by the aroma of sweet roast malts and a little alcohol on the end. The beer sips chewy and coating. Medium bodied with a lasting bitter mouth coating. The flavors are awesome. Lots of malt; sweet and rich. There is a little hoppy bitter essential and citrus notes by they are mostly overwhelmed by the sweetness of the malt. There is an alcohol bite but it is well balanced and very enjoyable. This is my first experience with this style of beer but I definitely look forward to trying more. Excellent offering. Can't wait to try the other ones that I cellared.","lochef81","Jan 20, 2014"

The flavor is extremely hop-forward and unlike any barleywine I've tasted. The palate is greeted by a huge blast of pine resin and alcohol, along with perky carbonation that accentuates both. Sweetness is almost non-existent except for traces of milk chocolate and nuts on the back end. Maybe maltier flavors can be teased out at room temperature? Regardless, this is not what I was expecting when I brought home a barleywine. Mouthfeel feels thin for the style; something more robust would better complement the flavor profile.","martyl1000","Oct 03, 2013"

Intense booziness is my biggest criticism, but this beer would still be fantastic on a cold winter day.","BrewBoyR","May 27, 2013"

But it's hard to drink this one without thinking ""this would be GREAT after a few years in the cellar."" The sweet notes (a bit much at this age) one hopes will become more complex, and some richer notes begin to express themselves as the hops mellow. As is: a solid barleywine that I look forward to breaking out again in 2016.","traviskurowski","May 11, 2013"

4.05,-1.5,4,4,4,4,4.25,"definitely one of the better barleywines ive had in a long time, thanks again to thebrewo for this one. it pours an enchantingly deep deep copper to ruby red, with a one inch off white head with excellent retention, especially for the style, which I find generally lacks this quality. its got an interesting nose. first of all, youd never know it was over 10% abv, it smells more gentle than that, nothing harsh at all here. there is some molasses sweetness, a mild but complex spice profile, and a huge grain profile that may even have some rye malt in it. the flavor isn't as sweet as the nose, its more delicate. weird to call a beer this big delicate, but this one somehow is. there are notes of vanilla, butterscotch, clove, and a range of other attributes that make me think this would be an ideal holiday beer. its a little out of place in springtime, but its really delicious. soft feel with relaxed carbonation and a easier drinking medium body. by feel alone, you also wouldn't know this is a barleywine. the alcohol gets more prominent as the beer warms, which is to be anticipated, but it never gets tough to drink or caustic. overall I really enjoyed this, I like that its not super hoppy or super sweet, but maintains the complexity the style is known for. very well made beer here.","StonedTrippin","Apr 26, 2013"

Alcohol very well hidden for a 10.2% barely wine, also not syrupy. The problem I have with most barleywines is that they are too syrupy and too boozey.

Put a 6 pack away for 5 years and you will be amazed by this beer. I gotta try it fresh for comparision, since I have not tried this beer fresh yet.

Fair amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, pine, herbal, dark fruit, and molasses for a while. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a nice creamy, sticky, and slick mouthfeel. Nice amount of smoothness, but is definitely a sipper.

3.75,-8.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"O: A good beer overall, but I think it might be in the ""awkward stage"". This could be great when the flavors meld a bit more and mellow out (fortunately, I've got another bottle to hold on to for another year or two). It might also be a bit better as a young, brash beer with somewhat bolder flavors. As it is, the sum of this beer is somehow just a little less than the sum of its parts. Still good, though, and I can't wait to try it with a bit more age!","eatabagofbooger","Jan 05, 2012"

4.38,6.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: Definitely an A-class cellerable brew! Delicious maltiness and fruity esters.

3.92,-4.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall, a good malt forward American barleywine (old ale, whatever). Good brown sugar and dark cherry flavors, with a subtle yet complex nose. Easy flavors and not much booze at all. Glad I've still got some of this to see how it develops, and I'd love to try a barrel aged version of this. Seems like the perfect canvas for some bourbon aging.","auroracrisis","Aug 09, 2011"

4.6,11.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall / Drinkability: Wow, this is quite an amazing beer. Definitely strong on the malt and sweet side of things, but with some good character. While this isn't a beer for a hot day like today, I enjoyed it anyway and will have to pick up a bottle again for sometime in the winter. A good beer with a meal (fish cakes and peas) and would be even better with dessert. But...after awhile the alcohol starts to creep in and it tells me that this a one per evening beer. Still, a great beer that I will definitely revisit and let it age more next time to see how it turns out.","damndirtyape","Aug 02, 2011"
3.58,-12.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"O- Fairly disappointed w/ this beer. It's not bad, but it doesn't live up to the Bell's Brewery name. There are a lot of barleywines that are better than this out there. I'll probably pass on this if I see it again.","jayhawk73","Aug 02, 2011"

4.12,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O - Great offering by Bells. I dont really have much experience with Olde Ales besides Kuhnhenn 4d. Even though that one has bourbon and this one doesnt, I found this to be more enjoyable and drinkable. With some age I'm sure the Kuhnhenn would be less boozy, but this one is definitely a great introdution to the style if someone out there is looking for a place to start with olde ales, excellent offering.","beenitty","Jul 22, 2011"

4,-2.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Once more, I employed a slow, gentle pour so as not to stir up any lees. In spite of this, I still got 1/4 of light-tan head that quickly became mere wisps. Color was a deep cola brown with NE-quality clarity. Caramel malt, indeed! The nose smelled like liquid toffee with a bit of pine resin mixed in. Mouthfeel was medium and the heat was the first thing that I noticed. This is no playing around, even after all of this time. As the heat subsided, it tasted heavily of mentholated tobacco and toffee. Wild. Finish was warming with the caramel/toffee up front and the mentholated tobacco lingering well after the swallow. I may need to lay down with my favorite blanket after this!","woodychandler","Jul 20, 2011"

Noticeable alcohol, but barely. I swear I taste a bit of maple syrup. Maybe a bit of raisin. Pretty decent balance between the flavors and the alcohol. Mouthfeel isn't as creamy as I would've liked. Moderate carbonation. Overall this is something I might like to age with hopes that the alcohol flavor goes away. Very nice.","1Adam12","Jul 12, 2011"

The taste of the beer has a sweet start to it with some burnt bitter flavors in the end, all that mixed with some caramel and booze. The heat on this beer is give the mouthfeel a big warming aspect to it. It's not overly heavy at all but it still feels like a big beer.

The flavor is not quite so sweet, with caramel and raisins being contrasted by a woodsy hop bitterness that I can best compare to pine bark. Both the bitter and sweets sides are presented in big doses along with an alcohol warmth that is noticeable without being overpowering. The fine, tingling carbonation keep neither adds nor detracts from the experience. Overall, the dense, robust combination of flavors is challenging without being difficult (if that makes sense), but there really isn't anything that truly sets this beer apart from any other reasonably well-made old ale/barleywine.","devilben02","Jul 01, 2011"

I will be setting aside a bottle or two to see what another 6 months does to this brew. It's a little pricey at 15 bucks a 6 pack, but it's worth every penny, this is a beer I would love to have in my fridge at all times and I would for sure buy it agian.

It drinks kind of sweet and has the candied fruit thing going again. The alcohol was definitely present as I tried to pick through the flavors. It dranks well for both the style and content.

This stuff does a number on your tastebuds from the begining. Very thick and sweet to start out. Syrupy viscuous malty sweetness. A huge toungue ripping herbal bitterness with traces of oak and other earthy notes. It mellows a little with some less intense fruity citrus flavors, but there is a hard alcohol aftertaste when all is said and done. I'm not exactly sure how you quantify drinkablity. If it means could I have a second one, then hell no. This is a huge ass-kicking beer to say the least. It's my first barley wine and I'm sure I need to aquire more of a taste for them.

The drinkability I think is compromised a little by this as once the beer warmed to warm temp the cardboard became more intense.

At 10.2%, the alcohol is very well hidden. Creamy and full bodied, with just a bit of thickness to it. This is a really good beer. The smell led me astray, but the taste brought me right back.

The first sip is where the complexity of the malts comes through: nuts, caramel, molasses are what I can detect. Bitterness is surprisingly high although it doesn't dominate. Alcohol is present too, like a Port or Sherry, and is a bit overwhelming at first. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little syrupy, with obvious alcohol warmth.

A decent sized light tan head comes together, and lacing and retention are both above average. The nose is a little bit lackluster, largely caramel and alcohol with only a hint of fruitiness. The flavor has a much better balance, as now caramel along with plums and figs are clearly in charge. Alcohol is still present giving a little burn on the finish, and it's still a little too bold for my taste, but it's definitely less prominent than in the beer's aroma. Body is decent, full without in any way becoming viscous. Carbonation is a little bit too low in my opinion, which leaves the beer creeping in on an undesirable syrupy character. Two months after bottling and Third Coast Old Ale is a decent beer, but I get the feeling it could be really spectacular with a nice amount of age on it.","axeman9182","Oct 20, 2010"

The taste is quite nice with there being a rum-raisin sweetness with the bitterness that the alcohol provides. It's almost like drunken raisinettes. I honestly really enjoyed sipping this one for quite some time it's just as good at room temperature as it is cold. The syrupiness seems quite appropriate for the style and actually makes it more enjoyable as a sipping beer. It has many characteristics that I would personally seek out in a Port.

The smell was bready, raisiny, and very malty, with just a hint of hops. The taste was rich without being neither overly sweet nor brazenly bitter. Very well balanced for such a high strength beer, with the alcohol not very evident either. A lot of raisin and apricot notes in the flavors, which were accentuated by a hint of sourness in the finish. A very satisfying heft to this beer as it traveled down the tongue. Not a coating nature, but not slippery either. Just a textured caress all the way through, somewhat similar to an orange juice with pulp in this matter. The finish is where the hops shined the most in their spicy herbal bitterness. Finish was pretty dry and warming. Quite easy to drink, considering what it is.

Pours a deep brown with slight amber hues. Very little head and a moderate amount of lacing. If angels' tears had a scent, it would be this beer. Sweet fruit - raspberry namely - is the most prevalent. Citrus, honey and caramel are also traceable. Taste is very complex - starts off sweet, which is likely the alcohol, and ends very malty, with bread/biscuit undertones. Good amount of carbonation for an Old Ale.

Initial tastes were ripe fruit - raisins and prunes with hints of apple. Alcohol is present and warming. Slight bitter hop finish adds to balance. As the ale warms to room temperature, fruity esters contribute to the complexity of the ale with notes of ripe cherries and vanilla. Oak and alcohol are on the finish with the bitter hops.

Viscous texture in the nose, warm honey and molasses, scones, dates and golden raisins, rum cake, spice jars which have sat in grandma's cabinets since the 70's, outside of a touch of grapefruit zest the hop presence is indistinct, if not absent for it. Full-bodied, clings to the palate like a life raft, yet, somehow avoids heaviness. Much more milk chocolate and carob here, plays well with the sugariness in the cherry, plum, raisin, date flavors. Licorice and baked cinnamon spice play a role as well. The carbonation content in its support, breaks up the clinch like a boxing ref. Just as in the nose, the hops exert their presence through the finish but do not necessarily coalesce into distinct qualities. This allows for a cleaner finish while concurrently not staunching the sweet fruitiness, which remains its primary attribute.","farrago","Feb 05, 2009"

The beer whispers, give me a try...so I do. The taste is nice and malty up front, similar to an english BW, but there is a bigger hop presence. Spicy, floral hops play slightly with my palate, with a full bodied mouthfeel and an oily coating going down.

The hop bitterness is noticeable up front and adds a nice initial kick to the brew. The sweet malts come through strong and then the raisin flavor mellows out the alcohol to create a smooth finish. There's a definite dryness in the aftertaste, due to the alcohol. As you progress through the beer it become even more drinkable and smooth. The hops also come through a little in the aftertaste.

Sweet, caramel, rum soaked dark fruits mix well with a herbal, green hoppiness all playing out in a field of booziness. Very thick and full bodied, almost syrupy, light carbonation, and nice alcohol warmth as it goes down.

4.27,3.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"T: Very sweet, malt and caramel background balanced by a strong hop flavor in the finish.

Slow carbonation and a considerable amount of sediment, but no worries man. Sweet malty aroma, sugary with a punch of alcohol. It's almost good enough just to sniff away on this, but alas it must be tasted. Intense flavor explosion of sweet caramel, candied sugar, floral hops, and even a touch of citrus goodness. Oh my there are more than a few layers to this and it all melds wonderfully. Full bodied, the alcohol makes it's presence once again in the finish. Exceptional.","kinger","Nov 11, 2008"

Flavors of honey,caramel,biscuts,rasins,some very mute citrus tones,oak ,, very complex,the flavors change as it warms,no real strong alcohol hints at all, very very good,a little on the sweet side to drink several at one sitting,but a top notch offering for sure...

Half inch, frothy, tan-colored head with lots of tiny ringlets embedded in the cap. Head began to dissipate after a minute into a fairly consistent skim of varying density that predominantly coalesced around the edges of the bowl. Nose is toffee, some dark fruit, a hint of vanilla and a touch of booziness in the background. Flavors start off with toffee, booze and a slightly vinous quality; however, finish is acrid, biting and lingering. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a consistent carbonation presence throughout the mouth. Drinkability is compromised by the lingering bitterness.

Smell was of plum, raisin, wood, tobbacco, and malt aromas. Had a bit of an earthy hop aroma to it as well. Flavor was on the fruity side. More plum and raisin, with a hint of dark cherries, oak, yeast, pipe tobbacco, and a ton of booze. Finishes nice and smooth despite the alcohol. A generous amount of carbonation was noticed.

On the palate, it has a pretty thick, viscous mouthfeel with average carbonation. Flavor is heavily malty with some chocolate notes and raisins, some evergreen hop bitterness balancing it out. Compared to JW Lees and other British styles this one is not as overly sweet and malty which I greatly appreciate. Why this isn't considered a barleywine, I'm not sure. It is pretty similar to Brooklyn's Monster ale. Either way, an excellent sipping ale for the cold winter months.","dreadnatty08","Dec 30, 2007"

Bready/biscuity grains and rich vinous malts on the palate, along with molasses, caramel, coffee and chocolate. Also, there are dark fruits (blackberries) and piney/citric hops, a hefty bitterness, and a big pecan kick.

The toffee and caramel come out in the flavor. The fermentation seems pretty clean. The mouthfeel is round and soft. It lingers in the mouth nicely. Even though it is 9% and very full flavored, when it was gone my wife and I were somewhat suprised and considered another. But we restrained and will enjoy the second one later. This is a big old ale that could stand up to a cigar and provide some sweetness to add a little contrast to it. Otherwise, it is dessert and a good one at that.

3.89,-5.4,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Third Coast Old Ale poured a deep dark hazy chestnut brown with some burgundy highlights all through out the beer. It had a tiny head of foam that was an off white color. I'm not too certain of the color of the foam because it was really small and it quickly dissipated into a some white rings along the edge of the beer and a small trace of white lace around the glass. It had a thick murky aroma of sweet caramel, molasses, only one chocolate covered cherry, a hint of brown sugar, a few raisins, sweet roasted malts, and one sweet hop bud to finish it off. If you can't tell already, it wasn't that hoppy. I thought there was going to be more hops in here. I guess all the sweet aromas covered them up their sugar coated overcoats. The taste started off with a dab of molasses and then it went straight into a pine/citrus hop kick. Not too much of a kick that it knocked your head off, it was just a slight kick to your taste buds. The pine/citrus hops quickly overshadowed the toasted malts, raisins, and the single cherry that preceded it. The pine/citrus hops reined supreme until the alcohol came out of nowhere, kicked the pine/citrus hops in the ass, and then took over as the last and remaining flavor in the taste. It was full bodied with an aftertaste of pine/citrus hops and alcohol that came out strong and then quickly faded away into oblivion. The strong aftertaste didn't want to linger on in the back of your mouth. That was thoughtful of them. Overall it was a very good Bell's beer that I would love to age to see how it turns out in the future. If you only have one bottle and you can't wait to open it, you still won't be disappointed by a young Third Coast Old Ale. I know I wasn't.

Surprising this time was a bit more hop aroma than I had experienced in the past. This may prove to be batch dependant but I also experienced much more hop bitterness and flavor in the beer. I am guessing that the last one I had was aged more than this allowing for the fragile qualities of the hop to fade into the background. It is still a nice beer, the alcohol seemed a bit hotter to muting some of the malt characteristics. I still believe that this is a must try from Bells.","adammills","Apr 11, 2007"

Lots of malt comes through first, with some spiciness, fermented fruits, and then a dose of light hops as well. Taste is excellent, incredibly complex with flavors hitting you from all over the place. Again, solid caramel malt base, but with surprising spices. Some breadiness as well, which helps the beer have a unique 'old' style texture. Spicy hops are mild, but do come through as the beer goes on. Feel is very good, creamy and fairly full bodied.

Pours a wonderfully solid, opaque, burnt umber. Nice light tan head that dissipated rather quickly to a thing lace around the edges. Smells of sweet, roasty malts. Maybe some dark fruit in there too, such as raisins and dates. You'll really need a big whiff to get to the fruit. On to taste...is this a barelywine? The carmel malt and roasty flavors make me think a little of Heavyweight's Old Salty. However, this has definitely mellowed out after some aging.

I don't get very obvious flavors like other beers, ones easily identified. What I get is a increadible infusion of ideas like sweet to warm, caramel to port, and so on. There is an apricot flavor that is just fantastic. Really a delicous ride of flavors that I don't really want to pick apart, just enjoy as the beautiful collage that it is.

The other one had no head at all. One left fantastic spiderweb lacing, the other left nary a trail. First sniff gives me a huge burst of raisins. Other dark fruits come through but raisin the dominating scent. Taste follows suit, with a huge burst of raisin up front. Flavor turns in to a bourbon note on the back end. Also a strong note of very dry English hops - reminds me of a hoppy esb. Overall this gives me the impression of a barley wine.

All those and more in the taste -- hints of mandarin orange, raspberry, and a mild smooth bitterness. Definitely balanced toward the malt; no hop flavor to speak of. The body is thick and chewy, feels like malt syrup going down with just a hint of heat to remind me that it really packs a whallop.

4.48,9,4.5,4,5,4.5,4,"Was fortunate enough to find this fine, fine beer on draft at our local multi-tap facility in town. Third Coast Old Ale is a nice murky brown to amber colored liquid. It has a small tannish head, decent bubble activity and pretty impressive lacing. The smell was nice. Roasted malt with a bit of a hop pull. As the beer warmed, dark fruits--raisin, plum and cherry--were all present. The taste is fantastic!! It was malty with a lot of hoppiness. Great full taste. Alcohol content is also notable, but not overwhelming. The presence of fruit-- plums and cherries--was also there. Very balanced and complex flavors. In the mouth B.T.C.O.A.was bitter, full and potent. Impressive again. Overall, I would have to say that the potency of this Old Ale makes it a sipper. One or two a night would certainly be enough.

Thick malts with a light hop and alcohol presence and a little sweetness to the aroma. Caramel, dark fruit, vanilla and tobacco. The taste is more of the same with all sort of flavors swirling around your mouth during and long after the sip. The malt flavors are great, supported by fruit and alcohol esters, with the hops imparting just enough bitterness on the finish to balance out this otherwise malt bomb. It has a medium-full body, delicate texture that turns lightly dry and soft carbonation. A wonderful beer that I really wish I could find around here.","ski271","Feb 02, 2006"

The finish also includes some candied pineapple and grapefruit hoppiness even after at least a few years on this bottle. The mouthfeel is medium to thick with very little carbonation which really works well for the flavors involved.

Alcohol melds well with the rest of the flavour and adds to the character. There's also a creamy, honey sweetness in the finish -- this also seems to add to the body.

This is one of my favorite beers, as it is readily available to me pretty much year round. The drinkability rocks. This batch tastes quite fresh to me, but I cannot be certain, because of the problems I listed in the first paragraph. Assuming that this is a fresh sample, it is great now.

I think I even tasted a kitchen sink...It's all in there! But the question is, ""how well do the flavors meld together""?

3.99,-2.9,3,4,4,4.5,4,"No date indicated on bottle. The glass fills with blurry russett liquid nearly opaque with residue, and a few spots of auburn sediment drifting about on top. Nodes of carbonation pop lightly across the surface, but the beer is headless. Disappointing. Smells pretty good despite an almost too-light, almost juicy nosefeel. Fans of sugary sweet malty smells (like me) will appreciate this one. Definitely more toffee than caramel... loads of liquid toffee covering a grainy underlayer of bran flakes or wheat germ, with emerging wisps of warm alcohol. Flavors are sweet enough that if the beer is drunk with any excess speed, it seems thin and cola-ish. Only by taking small sips can I find, alongside the toffee, a strong woody backbone that resolves into a boozy, bourbon-like finish with some B&B-like spiciness. The flavors are deep and strong, yet melt away from the tongue after each swallow, knowing not to cloy. This might make a decent after-dinner snifter. It's not bad, but as an Old Ale, it could use some... well, pardon the expression... Balls.","NearerMyBeerToMe","May 24, 2005"

Tastes very balanced, but hops still have a say in the flavor. I really wonder how old this beer is, or how long it was aged before it was bottled...always a mystery with Bell's. At any rate, all the flavors seem to come together well and this is one of the better balanced beers I've tried. The initial strong sweetness gets beat out by the bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is fine. This beer reminds me of an American Barleywine; Old Foghorn to be specific.

Some dark fruitiness. The finish is spicy, and there is a burn from the alcohol. Very complex flavors. Full mouthfeel.

Citrous hops finish it off with a nice dry bitterness which mingles well with the alcohol. Alcohol produces a pleasant warming of the face as this ale is digested.

It's more malty, tasting of caramel and cereal grains, slightly resinous. I also pick up clove and a growing raisiny taste. Spicy. Underscored with a bitter pine hop balance. Brandy-like alcohol finish. Full bodied and very mouthcoating. This beer will warm your innards.

Some chocolate and roasted malt were noted as well. A really a strong pleasant smell begging you to take a sip. Sweet caramel malt and a light fruitiness start off the taste. There is a strong smokiness throughout the flavor that adds great depth to this. Finishes with a sweet caramel malt. Some alcohol was detectable at times but never enough to detract from this tasty brew. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and a bit sticky.

Fruits and a touch of peat as well. The taste is amazingly smooth. The strong, complex aroma and higher ABV had me prepared to be slapped, but instead I get a subtly complex beer. The alcohol is there, and there's a slight bit of piney fusels, but there also seems to be a bit of hop-inspired pine as well. A slight caramel sweetness precedes this melange of pine resins. Hints of roasted grain and chocolate appear in the aftertaste and then gradually fade. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, with just enough carbonation to keep it from becoming syrupy. Drinkability is much too good for a beer with this amount of alcohol.

4.5,9.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Carefully poured from a long-standing bottle it's a crystal-clear deep-ruby with an orange cast. The creamy off-white head drops slowly to a thin surface covering that holds throughout the glass. A simple swirl of the glass will bring it back up in size; yet it leaves little lacing about the glass (probably due to the high level of alcohol present). A rich caramel malt resides in the nose; accentuated by spicy, floral, citrusy and herbal hops; as well as a bit of alcohol and some mild fruitiness. The body is full and creamy in the mouth with a very fine, natural carbonation that gently caresses the tongue. All of the elements found in the nose are carried over into the flavor plus more. It starts with a gently sweet and lightly fruity caramel malt that expresses a gentle nuttiness and an occassional mild note of vanilla. More fruit (dates, raisins) and a light touch of citrusy and piney hops becomes apparent across the middle along with a solid bitterness. It finishes with some lingering malt and a burst of citrusy/piney hops amongst a rising bitterness. Quite nice! Seemingly more of a barleywine than an old ale, but enjoyable nonetheless.

The nose is so heavily malted as to make the strong flavor seem slightly weak by comparison. It is as if the beer is giving off the aroma of baking bread. You can almost sense heat. The thick, rich feel is creamy and smooth to the hilt. The high alcohol level is masked by the very strong flavor, but you can catch it in the back of the throat if you rush a gulp. The malty taste is buttery bready and ends in a bitter finish. There is also caramel and toffee mixed in there to make things interesting.

Big hoppy flavor but, compared to some others, is very drinkable. Definitely some fruit in there -- too powerfully bitter for that citrus grapefruit flavor you get from IPAs, but more of an old fruit taste that gets cleansed by the huge bitter backend that just rolls over the tongue as you swallow this guy.

4.09,-0.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The taste is big, though not exactly like the nose. The large aromatic, cookie-like maltiness is there, but so is a big shot of hops that were lying hidden under the beautiful aromatics, offsetting the potentially saccharine sweetness suggested by the aroma. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light, considering the OG and the ABV! This beer is WAY more drinkable than it ought to be for a beer its size. Its like Bo Jackson if he were fermented: way too agile for that frame. I think that the relatively high degree of carbonation on this beer helps to belie its strength somewhat. The bottle conditioning softens what would be prickly carbonation, if this beer were force-carbonated. Adding the yeast trub to the glass turned this beer downright murky, but made the head invincible and took the fresh cookie aromatics to a whole new level. Interestingly, this beer has just a touch (ever so subtle) of the coriander taste that overwhelmed my first sample of Bells Two Hearted Ale. I can barely pick up a touch of something unusual in the nosejust enough to get me wondering. The aroma is confirmed, if ever so briefly, in a very quick sensation between the initial taste of the beer and the finish. During that half a second between my swallow and the aftertaste, theres a hint of something vegetal and coriander-like, instantly reminiscent of a Belgian Wit. Then its gone and everythings awesome again. Other than that glimpse into what I now believe to be a peculiarity of Larry Bells yeast strain, this is an amazing beer. The taste will take a slight hit for that little bit of nuance that comes back in my burps to remind me that alls not well in Kalamazoo land. Otherwise, this is an excellent beer and one Ill search out again.","TXHops","Feb 24, 2003"

A round, citrusy Centennial hop nose similar to that of their Two Hearted Ale emerges to contrast the rich malt aroma.  Trace fruity esters are overpowered but add additional complexity.  Very unique and enjoyable aromawise.  Chocolate sweetness is perceived upfront in flavor, then is ensued by dryish biscuit and deep caramel.  Mid palate sweetness becomes fruitier and date like, then is quickly offset by moderate and clean hop bitterness.  Hop flavor is both citrusy and piney, but is refined enough not to deter from the richly nutty overall malt profile.  Moderately bodied for style, w/ a smooth, but surprisinly crisp mouthfeel that helps facilitate dangerous drinkability.

Represents a prety nice effort and good complexity but I wasn't bowled over by the profile.","ADR","Jun 17, 2002"
