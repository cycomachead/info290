This is a great example of an American Barleywine but shows some glimmers of the English style. Matter of fact, strong glimmers...

So i don't know if this is batch 10 or if this is from the first batch. I know they only brew it once a year, so i don't think they are up to batch 10, but who knows? ( can someone clarify?) i recently spent a good bit of time drinking belgian ales, and have been branching out to barleywines lately. So far, this is by far my favorite. The mouthfeel almost reminded me of a belgium, but with a little less carbination. the hops in the finish rounded out the fairly strong malts up front.

I like huge beers as much as the next craft nerd but I have to be in a particular mood to really ""get"" a barleywine, to truly appreciate the experience. The aroma here is great, redolent with toffee and rum notes, orchard fruit, pine-like hop resins and another nonspecific tangy spice note. Smells hot, earthy, and woody but with an overarching malty sweetness. The palate is initially rich and malty, burnt brown sugar and molasses, leather and walnuts. Things then get fruity for a moment, candied cherries, raisins and prunes, almost floral almond extract, something that recalls coconut, only to have these flavors disappear underneath hot spicy alcohols and oak. Reasonably thick and syrupy with a dry bitter finish, all hop resins and nutshells. This one is a tad pungent, rather woody and medicinal, and I think some aging might do it good. I do appreciate the aggressive hopping and roasted flavors.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 27, 2014"

The finish gets much hoppier, as I get notes of pine and grass; however, the malt bill stays strong and really goes well with the hops. Lots of molasses, dark fruit such as raisins and figs, carmel, a hint of cocoa, and grapes. Just a tiny hint of alcohol on the finish, but it goes well with the other flavors. It does bring a nice warming sensation. High medium body with a creamy and syrupy feel. A pretty complex brew. My first brew by them, but overall, a really nice American Barley Wine.

4.12,5.4,4.25,4,4.25,4,4,"Deep ruby chestnut body light caramel tan head, nose is filled with equally impressive big fruit and caramel malts...it's a Canadian hop bomb of a barleywine. Sharp acidic notes with leafy herbal hops playing a big role in it, roasted nuts and caramelized sugars collide to equate to the aromatics of the beer. Flavor is harsh bitterness all day, bitingly bitter big and bad with warming alcohol...it's a rough sultry barleywine meant for the cooler months, don't ask me why I chose to crack the bottle in the warm rainy spring weather that we are having today. Big fruit ride the wave of harsh bitterness, yeast nuttiness, plum soaked in brandy, this is a big beer all day with lingering waves of earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied with a warming alcohol effect taking over in the first few sips, if this is their winter beer it's meant to be this way for a reason to keep you warm when you are walking from pub to pub in the dead of winter up in the Quebec province of Canada. Overall very pleased it's like an exotic version of Bigfoot and I'm sure it's appreciated and held on to every year during it's release to experience something like this so big yet so quaffable.","WVbeergeek","0"

3.85,-1.5,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured a brownish body with minimal head and a hearty aroma of malts with a mix of roasted and caramel malt along with minor grape hops and/or dark fruit (I think) and a touch of alcohol coming through. The beer is strong, not too strong though, alcohol has a minor role but doesn't bleed and is a good sipper. Figs, caramel, toffee or bitter chocolate seem to make a cameo and the breadiness/roastiness of the malts makes it sturdy and there is a good balance of dark fruit sweetness and hops. Finishes a little boozy but not an ABV burn.","clayrock81","Jan 15, 2013"

It features candied sugar, molasses, brown sugar, light oak, a light bitterness, with a touch of cream in the finish. Well rounded flavor as well. For being 10.2%, there isn't any alcohol at all. It drinks pretty full in body with plenty of residual sugar. It is big but isn't overpowering in one facet or another. It's just a well rounded barleywine. I recommend it. It's barleywine season, and this was a nice way to start it off! If only Dieu Du Ciel would barrel aged this!","aasher","Oct 28, 2012"

Aroma is quite nice with raisins, dried fruit, peppery spice with a hint of alcohol underneath it all. The beer itself has a solid body with a slight syrupy nature to it with spiciness, some complexity in the malts mainly being levels of dried fruit and caramel notes seemingly from crystal malts. The bitterness is surprisingly noticeable in the beer for such a sweetness, but it keeps the palate cleaner than I had expected.

Taste of big raisin, prune, toast, roasted malt, molasses, bread, caramel, earth, oak, and herbal spiciness. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, molasses, toast, earth, oak, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of spicy hop flavors with the fruity malt backbone; with good complexity and no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very nice creamy, thick, and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured this noble winter beer in a snifter glass. Pours brown in color with flaming red highlights. Its taste is delicately sweet and liquor-like with a hint of burnt caramel coming from the malt and a prolonged boiling time. It is a very bitter beer with aromas of hops and alcohol, and flavors reminiscent of red fruit brought by the English-type yeast the brewery uses to ferment it. The aftertaste is accentuated by the wonderful flavor of hops. Solstice d’Hiver is brewed only once a year, and is then aged for 4 to 5 months before being sold. This aging process is necessary to achieve an ideal equilibrium between the sharp bitterness and the other flavors in the beer. After aging, it is then sold starting mid-December of each year. A very nice barleywine!","CuriousMonk","Nov 26, 2011"

I can taste the 10.2% but it isn't overwhelming. Medium bodied with pretty good carbonation that wasn't as noticeable on the pour.

It tastes like caramel malt, toffee, brown sugar, bready malt and some plums. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's somewhat coating and creamy with moderate carbonation. I think it's a decent beer overall, but there's nothing really impressive about this. Maybe it would be better if I had aged it longer, so I might buy another bottle to do just that.","bluejacket74","Aug 22, 2011"

However, I can attest to the fact that this is a true malt bomb that has absolutely no cloying sweetness. Alcohol content is not apparent, but two of these and driving would be a bad idea. As a note of comparison, the absolutely best beer of this type that I have ever had was the original Thomas Hardy's Ale, and this is the most worthy successor I have found.

Tastes of rich sweet caramel, plump raisins, and cloves. Finishes with a lingering leafy bitterness and some noticeable alcohol, but not as much booze as the aroma would suggest.

A bit of spicy, some cloves, but balanced with some lactose/vanilla undertones. Taste was sweet. Slightly fruity, but had banana type tones to keep from getting too sweet. Felt good in the mouth.

On drinking, almost as thick as it looks, but pretty smooth, too. The oak element comes in pretty quick, but so does the bittersweet raisin-y side.

To be honest, I am not the biggest fan of this subdued nose as I think t takes away from the overall experience. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet dark fruit start gives way to semi-bland hop and alcohol notes. Nice lace left on the glass as this goes down.

3.92,0.3,3,3.5,4,5,4,"Pours out a fairly dark brown with a half finger head that has very little retention. A ring of tan head is left around the sides with very faint clouds atop the beer. Very little lacing sticks around on the glass. The beer itself has a nice color with the brown and red but the head and lacing are a let down here. Right off the bat in this beer I get some caramel and yeast in the aroma. I get a bit of an oxidized/metallic scent too which I find to be pretty common in Barleywines, especially aged ones, as mentioned on the side of the bottle. I really don't pick up hop aroma here but get a very good portion of malts and caramel. The problem here keeps coming back to that oxidized smell but the other elements are nice. Taste is basically the aroma without the metallic element. Lots of malts and caramel flavors. The malts profile is pretty much that of a classic big barleywine. A ""stale"" flavor, like that of Old Ales, is also present here. There is a tiny yeasty element. In the aftertaste I get a nice dark fruit taste with some cocoa hints, must be some chocolate/dark malt in this one. Alcohol comes into play in the taste and the nose but it is not overdone and I pretty much expect it in Barleywines that aren't overhopped. I do get a hint of earthy hops here but not anything huge. The mouthfeel is what really hit me in this beer. The carbonation combined with the warming from the high ABV make for a very silky, creamy beer. The carbs are medium as is the body, very nice for a Barleywine. A huge coat of cocoa, dark fruit and malts coat the tongue on the way out and for minutes afterward. Drinkability is decent. The taste is good, the price sucks here in the U.S. but not bad up in Canada. The looks and aroma come up short here but the taste and mouthfeel balance this beer out.

Vanilla and oak. A coffee like finish, bitter and punchy with a dripping of molasses. Still manages to be dry. This stuff is so complex and incredibly well crafted. A full creamy texture is complimented by a wonderful light effervescence in the initial carbonation. Goes down a little to quickly for a barleywine. Yum. I'll be cellaring a few of these.

4.77,22,4.5,5,4.5,5,5,"Drinkability- This beer was not far from perfection. Was a bit picky on the appearance, but was basing it on the fact that I have seen a good handful of the same style and abv beer that have looked a bit better. As for the taste...pretty damn good, possibly a bit off style according to the label...but BA has the right style IMO. Damn great beer worth seeking out.","GClarkage","Feb 01, 2009"

Notes of cherry and even a hint of red wine emerge as the beer warms. This doesn't make it more drinkable, but it somehow seems a little on the lighter side of the barleywine spectrum, so I've bumped the drink score up a bit.","BretSikkink","Jan 19, 2009"
3.95,1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"D: A little on the raw side. Sort of reminds me of my early forays into barleywines...15-16 years ago! It was nice to reminice, though. This could've used more time in the bottle","GbVDave","Jan 16, 2009"

4.25,8.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4," Body is creamy and just a touch sticky, very ideal for a barleywine. This is a pleasant, tasty barleywine that has great depth of flavor. I would expect nothing less from Diue du Ciel, one of my favorite new (to me) breweries of 2008.","ElGordo","Dec 28, 2008"

3.75,-4.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a medium and muddy brown color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, toffee, dark fruits, a little roasty, lightly woody, and some nuttiness.

3.74,-4.3,4.5,3,4,4.5,3.5,"Burgundy colored ale with a filmy, lasting white head. Aroma is the weak spot, but still shows some malt and hop character. Flavor has some depth to it and is very complex, with a nice balance between bold hop and malt notes. Caramel and toffee with spruce-like hops. Very nice mouth feel to this bad boy. Pretty nice barley wine with some nice short term cellar potential.","Crosling","Dec 13, 2008"
3.85,-1.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, a solid effort. I wasn't a big fan of the bitterness but the caramel and red fruit are nice.","abfraser","Dec 10, 2008"
4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Murky tawny colour with coppery edges. A thin cap of fine tan/beige bubbles formed during the pour and ringed the glass with lace. Good head retention, quite sticky. Caramel and sugar in the aroma, along with mild alcohol, herbal hops, a little grassy, sweet fruits. Bready and doughy flavour, lots of malt up front, some caramel, then growing alcohol into the finish. Bitterness was present, but subdued, and balance for the malt was provided more by the alcohol, which had a bit of spiciness to it. Herbal hop notes lingered on the back of my palate long into the finish, sort of minty. A bit of sherry and cherry as it warmed, but less fruit overall than in the aroma. Medium plus bodied, lightish carbonation that was fairly creamy, lots of alcohol warmth. A bit of a different take on a barleywine, seemed appropriate for the holiday season.","DrJay","Dec 07, 2008"
3.23,-17.4,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Overall: dont know if this one should be characterized as an american or english bw. Hops were american, but the rest was more towards the english type. But smell and taste were, either way, a bit thin and weak.","simonjohansson","Nov 21, 2008"

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear dark red, some brown highlights, medium sized off white head forms, drops a ton of lace, settles to a thin ring. Smell is sweet and caramelized, alcohol, cherries, lots of fruit, bread, bit of citrus/mango, rich aroma, nice. Taste is similar, alcohol, sherry, tons of fruit, bit of spiciness, caramel and nuts, woody bite in the finish, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, bit of alcohol heat, sweet body, not bad! I'd put this more in the English barleywine category than American.","Viggo","Jul 21, 2007"

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pour from a 22oz Bottle. Thanks Clark! Aroma pours forth as a brandied caramel domain, backed up by apple cores and sweet orange juice. Light heat. A nicely nuanced and subtle aroma. Pours in orange and amber, with a thin rim of off-white. Dense caramel sugar flavor, somewhat middle. Good malt character in sweet milk caramel and toasted grains. Sweet and bready. Hop presence alights towards the back end as a leafy hop cone grass. Nice balance and well built. Nice dense cream malt character on the front end, runs nicely with good alcohol and hop levels. Finishes along a wispy of English toffee candies and nip of espresso.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 25, 2004"
4.6,17.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Very drinkable. It was quite interresting! Too bad that this kind of beer isn't very popular in Quebec. I am looking forward for trying another ones of this kind. Sooner than later I hope.","philmath","Jan 04, 2004"

4.25,8.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Served a dark brown with an off-white lacey head. They don't serve this in pints for some reason. Flavor profile is complex. Hops are big, but are very well balanced by some huge malts. Sweet stuff is there, but also deeper bodied malt goodness. The alcohol also comes through in flavor a touch. A very good barleywine.","scottum","Beers"
4.32,10.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,5,"Dark brown body, copper. From a nice 1cm off white head sticking to the glass, it rapidly becomes a thin ring around the glass. Very malty aroma with notes of licorice, toffee, bubble gum. One of Dieu Du Ciel's most complex flavour developments. The hops are still impressively present for a 3 years old beer. Chocolate, burnt caramel, vanilla, also subtle notes of woody hops (never really bitter though). Toffee after taste. One of my favorites from the popular brew-pub.","Rastacouere","0"
