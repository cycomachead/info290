Smell of Pine, allspices, cardamom or clove, citrus, brandy, tobacco, wood (oak?)...  Not thick and not light in the palate, not too mauch carbonation, it feels really good. Taste is just like the aroma, maybe with some hints of chocolate and a bit more sweet., though bitterness and sweetness come and go on the same level.Very good indeed. Maybe if I can get another one I'll give a perfect ten.","janubio","Nov 07, 2014"

Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big orange rind, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, caramel, toast, floral, grass, molasses, dark bread, light roast, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and hop notes. Taste of big orange zest, grapefruit, pine, caramel, molasses, toast, floral, grass, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, caramel, toast, molasses, pine resin, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barleywine! Great balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 03, 2013"

Tastes of sweet malt, hop oils, hint of roasted malt, alcohol, citrus hops, slight floral hops, hint of wet hop, and a hint of earthy malt.

Nice rich aroma of mostly citrus fruit but also some dark fruits and fig on a caramel malt background. Well balanced flavor with toasted caramel malts and earthy and fruity hops with notes of toffee and pine resin. Not overly sour or bitter. Alcohol is a little strong but not too bad for the ABV. Sooth, medium body and moderate carbonation.","kylehay2004","Feb 21, 2013"

Hop is really present in the taste with a lot of floral/piney/citrusy notes an a purgent bitterness. Big malty sweetness that gives a full body which balances the hop with raisins/figs aroma. Alcohol at the end gently tickles the throat. Really good barley wine! One of the american examples that is close to an imperial IPA in terms of IBU and hoppy notes. I really love that one, recommended!","duracell","Feb 17, 2013"
4.08,5.2,3.25,4,4.25,4.25,4,"Overall: I’m quickly finding another style of beer that I’m liking…this barleywine is not as sweet as some I’ve had and while that’s not a bad thing, it just makes it different…the malt flavor is a little too amber malt for me, but that’s the only “knock” I’ve got and that’s probably just be a personal preference…the piney resinous hop flavor is strong and complimentary…this is a solid brew that doesn’t take long to be effective but isn’t too strong to cloud my judgment either…very drinkable and easily recommendable…I definitely want to get at least one more for the future…it’s got a vintage date which usually means it can survive in a cellar for at least a couple of years and I mind as well test that…if you just want a beer to sit back and relax with, this is a great choice…shoot, this is a great choice for disc golfing with and that’s my highest honor! I have to say, the more I drink, the more I like this brew…(4/5)","SerialHiker","Beers"

3.53,-9,3,3,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Pours a dark brownish ruby red color with a finger and a half dark tan head that dissipates somewhat slowly and leaves a thick ring of lacing. Smells of lots of carmel and toffee, lots of bready notes from the malt, some brown sugar, raisins, a little dankness from the hops, as well as some grapefruit and pine. Thought there would be more hops on the nose. Taste starts with some resinous hop qualities such as grapefruit, pine, and orange rind. Then in the middle the hop qualities take a back seat to the malts. Lots of carmel, toffee, breadiness, some molasses or brown sugar. Then the finish is more of the heavy malt presence: lots of sweetness and breadiness, as well as some raisins, but more of the resinous hops show through as well. More complex hops flavors show through on the end such as floral, grass, and resin. Some booze on the finish that provides a warming sensation on the way down. Tastes very much like Bells This One Goes to 11 when it warms, as the hops show through much more. A pretty full body with a thick, creamy, and oily mouthfeel. Have had better American barleywines, but still decent.","brewskis","Feb 15, 2013"

The taste has slight citrus/grapefruit tinges but mainly pine oriented hops and gentle caramel from the malt combine with a strong taste of alcohol but not overboard as it mainly comes through in the finish. I enjoyed this one a lot, a pretty solid example of an American Style barlewine -very fresh and full of hops, but not really trying to be an Imperial Ipa in disguise -it has the malt backbone you expect in a Barleywine.","Slatetank","Sep 09, 2012"

I personally prefer a sweeter taste, because many times these dark brews can be just so dry and woody that I just can't really enjoy a whole 24 ounces of it. This beer offers a very smooth mouthfeel blend of medium chocolate, dark toffee, brown sugar, and a soft hop bitterness. I think the lack of hop bitterness and at the same time the lack of malt grain taste enables the ""other"" flavors to really stand out to me and add to this beer in a positive way. If you asked me what the ABV of this beer was I couldn't tell you honestly, I can't really taste the alcohol.

Aroma is caramel malt, toffee, and some pine and citrusy hops. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a bit of dark fruit. There's also a bittersweet finish. Although I think at this point for both the flavor and the aroma that the malt is stronger than the hops in this brew, the hops are still quite noticable and haven't totally faded away yet.

So resiny, with whisps of citrus and dark fruit encircling a solid, sweet smelling malt backbone. Damn this smells huge and good! The taste is not as huge up front as I thought it would be, but as it warms in the mouth the complexity comes through. Then the alcohol warmth start to show up, building toward the alcohol-heavy finish. Coming back for more sips, the aroma that I initially found to be so enticing is now a bit overbearing in a way. Still good though. It has a full body, a dry, warm, lightly-syrupy texture, and low carbonation. This one started out with high marks but then fizzled a little. The alcohol is a bit harsh (and this is coming from somebody that LOVES big beers). I had just had an Old Guardian the day before. This one probably has more complexity, but just isn't as well-rounded. I know a big beer like this going to be cloying, and I'm going to enjoy tasting this for several hours after finishing the bottle, but this one is just a little too much .

With a vigorous pour there is also quite a healthy head and a modicum of lacing. Nice, after a couple of years. The taste is rich, nutty, and honeyed. The malt shines beautifully here. Amazingly, there is still a fair hit hops in the finish, with pine and bitter orange. Subtle, but bitter enough to balance the malt and toffee notes.

The odd thing about this beer is that the hops are so intense that they actually sucked the moisture right out of my mouth. Definitely could have used a little mellowing to take off that hop edge.

The flavors followed suit, I was first rushed by the flavors of fermented cherries and raisins, quite sweet. This was soon followed by pine and grapefruit notes from the hops and at last the alcohol heat and caramel malt at the end. As big as it was the balance was well struck. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth helping to make it rather drinkable. Though sweet it never became cloying even as it warmed up and I think the sugars helped control the 10% alcohol punch.

4.23,9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"A very nice American Barleywine. if you like Bigfoot, you will like this one too. Really nice looking beer. Ruby / amber color with a big head that hangs in there. Leaves a lot of lacing. Smell a bit less impressive than Bigfoot, but still gives a hint of hops and pine. Taste is very good. Hops bitterness (not quite as rough as fresh Bigfoot) and pine / resin. Absolutely no hint of the 10% abv. Knowing the alcohol level and size of the bottle (man rule: finish what you started), I sipped this one. Tasted just as good at the end as it did up front. The strong taste holds up well (for hop heads) and is never overpowering or ""too much"". Not a session beer by any means, but 22 oz over an hour or so goes down real well. This one is a winner.","JayQue","Jun 21, 2007"
3.58,-7.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"An OK Barleywine but far from an outstanding one. The flavor could be more complex and less butter flavored for a start. Worth $5 a bomber to try once but no real reason to seek this out or spend lots of money to obtain.","Zorro","Jun 20, 2007"
3.65,-5.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This Barleywine poured a hazy medium brown with very little foam and some lace on the glass. The smell of roasted malts and pine smelling hops filled the nose.

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle courtesy of Naven: Poured a medium brown/burgundy color ale with a great foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt and light dry fruit is offset by some west coast hops. Taste of sweet caramel malt and subtle dry figs is balance with some citrus hops. Body is about average with some great carbonation and no alcohol was noticeable. Well done and I have to confess that I did enjoy this even though I usually prefer my barleywine with more malt profile then hop profile.","Phyl21ca","Jun 15, 2007"

Morhtfeel is smooth and hides the alcohol well. Flavors of caramel, fruits, and some bitterness. Good dry bitter finish. Overall a well balanced and delightful barley wine that should only get better with age. I need to get some more of these for the cellar","rkuhnel","May 26, 2007"

Strong citrusy hop aroma, pineapple, some alcohol evident in the aroma and a light fruity and berry sweetness. Taste is also quite hoppy with strong citrus notes and a big bitter and dry finish. Malts are evident in the background with some nice caramel bready sweetness and a hint of pruniness. Big dry and bitter finish also shows a quick warming alcohol pinch. Fairly rich and creamy soft with a medium to heavy body. A very nice barleywine, at first still somewhat cold it was very dipa like but as it warmed, the nice rich body and some malty flavors came forward.

I am picking up the smell from about a foot away from the glass, very fruity; apples, oranges, some grapefruit and a little pepper. The biting alcohol dominates the taste, there is some cherry and strong bitterness. There is long lasting bitter solvent like aftertaste. The solvent is really turning me off.","orsulacp","Beers"

4.32,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Starts of with a sticky thickness that almost immediately gets dried up by a bitterness that scorches the palate. Citrus fruits, spicy hops, piney needles and sap. Sweet caramel malt background, but not one that plays a large role. Quite a hoppy barleywine, just as I like 'em. Extra long sticky citrus laden bitterness that finds it's way into the aftertaste. Abv is up there, so one of these is about all for me. A very nice bitter, alcoholic, hop bomb without the huge spicyness that's associated with barleywines. One I would love to get my hands on again.","bjohnson","Mar 10, 2007"

On the palate, the hops are grassy and resinous. Malts produce a nice sweet base. The alcohol is barely noticeable. A little fruit punch feel to it due to the nice fruitiness invloved.

Perhaps a second bottle will answer my questions.","phisig137","Dec 11, 2006"
4.05,4.4,4.5,4.5,4,3,4," Palate is well-balanced between sturdy caramel malt and a ton of grassy, floral hops. A sweet raisin character emerges mid-palate, then is overwhelmed by a building alcohol presence that continues to grow long after the swallow. The body is surprisingly and disappointingly thin for such an otherwise huge beer. Nevertheless, this is a pleasure to drink. Watch yourself, though; while it's unlikely this could ever ""sneak up"" on you, it is pretty powerful stuff. Plan ahead - this should probably be your only beer of the evening.","ElGordo","Dec 11, 2006"

Syrupy sweet in spots-like liquid caramel. No alcohol evident. Nice, full mouthfeel-as big as the hops are, theres no hashness in the body that you sometimes get. Damn fine brew.
