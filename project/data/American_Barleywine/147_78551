4.29,7.5,4,3.75,4.75,4,4.25,"'14 vintage on tap at the Bier Stein, Eugene, OR. L: Great color, a little hazy but the orange-dark red-brownish color with an off-white head is really doing it for me. S: more booze than I expected considering there's not too much in the taste for an 11%, big hops, big caramel-candi-dark fruit smell. T: Well it's a Stone beer... Perfect hop balance and flavor from beginning to end. The malt flavors are there too, along with dark fruits and a little caramel. Very little alcohol- big plus for me with a barleywines. F: heavy bodied, not too much carbonation which I like with my barleywines. Incredibly smooth and dangerously drinkable.  O: living in Southern California, I am always hesitant to say that I love Stone beers considering how huge they are nationwide, but they continue to come out with beers that are just fantastically well made. This is one of them, especially after a year when you get that hop flavor and the bitterness has died down a bit. Really tasty, very drinkable, overall a really good beer.","JTbrue","Mar 16, 2015"

The age of this brew has hidden the high gravity of the brew, yet it's oxidation pulls forth some favorable characteristics. Sherry notes I like, yet the wet cardboard  and bleach in the aroma is a bit of a let down, not by much though. The rest of the flavor of the brew is a win for me! So I guess its not a total loss at all to age one of these buggers. Now I have to see how a fresh one tastes. Blah, blah, blah! This brew is Recommended!","Shroud0fdoom","Oct 22, 2014"

I pick up some booze as well. Taste is maltier than some versions from other years. Sticky dates and golden raisins. Citrus and earthy hops towards the finish. Aftertaste is like citrus peel candy. Not too much bitterness or alcohol burn compared to last year's. Mouthfeel is sticky, mouth-coating, and has low carbonation. They did a great job with Old Guardian this year, which has always been a hit-or-miss barleywine, depending on the year. I might have to get a few more bottles than I'd planned to drink more of it fresh, instead of putting it away to age.","goochpunch","Mar 16, 2014"

3.75,-6,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall Opinion: Barley wines are one of my favored styles. This one is a young barley wine ale. Impetuous due to youth and an abundance of hops. Lacks the smooth grace and characteristics that come with age. I would hope for the hops to diminish somewhat being tamed in company of the malts and rendered obedient over a time. Maybe it does happen that way...maybe it doesn't. The alcohol reminds you that it is present for duty during the course of sipping. No need to yell, ""WHOA!"" as it is just warms the cheeks after a while. This is not an unpleasant ale at this time. However, I don't believe that is will reach its prime for a while. Must your pair it with a meal or appetizer for it to be a suitable quaff? No. It is good enough by itself, right now. Most importantly, is this an ale that I would do again....Yes.","Weimaraner","Dec 18, 2013"
3.99,0,3.75,3.5,4.5,3.75,3.75,"22oz 2013 bottle aged 6 months. Pored a brandy color with yellow undertones.. off white- tannish head pours a 1/4"" head that stays around for a few.not too much stickiness, lacing on the glass. Lots of malt and yeast on the nose.. Smell is malt heavy followed by candied ""stone-fruit", peach and plum on the nose, caramel, toffee, and a little orange zest. Taste is mellow and balanced: white grape, plum, pear, yeasty hop profile in the finish. Carbonation is slightly crisp which is mildly dry and approachable. Mouthfeel is medium body with the ever slightest bight from the hops. Mildly acidic for the style, but that is to my liking. Overall a memorable beer from a respected brewery..would order on tap to compare.. Age has proved well on this 1. Would like to see this one aged for 2 years and the paired with goat cheese, cinammon and spiced desserts, or any fowl.","Beerswag","Dec 17, 2013"

As for the taste, there was such a big hop presence that I couldn't get much from the grain profile. The hops felt like they were getting in the way, and what I could taste seemed ... stale. It was easy-to-drink, especially in terms of being high ABV, but only because it was thin and watery. While I recognize that American BW's are hoppier than their English counterparts, I didn't feel that the hops and grains played well together in this one.","yankeepride","Nov 14, 2013"

But, it's pretty damn good sipping slowly all by itself. I think this would pair better with beef and roasted vegetables. Despite the food mismatch this was quite tasty and dangerously drinkable. I knew it was 11.2% ABV going in, but one large snifter later I'm feeling the effects, and yet I want some more sips. The hoppiness of this Barleywine is just right - it's strong enough for a hophead, but not overpowering; it allows the malt to shine and compliment all the hop flavors. The lemon note was a nice touch with this one. This beer sat and aged for about ~8 months (or whenever it was bottled at the start of 2013), and I wonder how it would be with another 9-12 months but maybe the hop flavors would get too muted. In any case, I very good choice for my 500th beer review and I may pick up another version of this and let it sit longer next time.","damndirtyape","Sep 28, 2013"

Bright color, orange with hints of red, jewel-like and vibrant with a creamy, clean,tan head.The nose was the most amazing part; fruity and sweet, cherries, lychee, grape. The first sip gives you a fleeting moment of sweetness, followed by a rush of bitter pine, grapefruit rind, and earthy herbs. The aftertaste is hot, boozy and bitter. The mouthfeel is full and oily, full carbonation and bite. I wish the taste matched the nose because the scent was the most amazing part.

Personal preference that only affected my scoring very slightly. Aside from that note, another excellent beer from one of my favorite and most respected breweries. Would I drink it again?

It's borderline big DIPA-ish, like a double crooked tree or a 120min. Very sticky mouthfeel one of the strongest I've had in that sense. The beer literally stick to your mouth and the flavors stays around forever as a result. Oily from all the hops. Very intriguing. I really enjoyed this one, one of the better american barleywines I've ever tasted. I bet some barrel aging would make this sublime.","Dope","Mar 24, 2013"

On the noise it's got barley, some faint roast malts, some grassiness,cotton candy, hops, a little booze, and some citrus. It tastes fairly similar to the nose, less so on the malts, but with addition of caramel, raisins and bread. The mouth is quite nice, bitter with some bite-y carbonation, just enough to keep one from drinking it too quickly. It's also pretty smooth going down. Overall it's a great beer, not as good as the other barleywines I've had, but still very good. I'd suggest getting it, but not going out of your way for it.","brandon911","Jun 18, 2012"

Mostly pithy grapefruit hop aromas. Some sticky resin and a faint amount of caramel and toffee. The flavor brings more of the same. A huge amount of hops, grapefruit flavor, bitter citrus pith, and behind this there is that little bit of caramel flavor and toffee. The finish has a hint of sweet followed by all bitterness. Clearly a hop forward affair. Thick and rich mouthfeel, almost syrupy, which I like. I just have no idea why I always return to this style, I don't like it.

Taste is clean hop bitterness and spots of pine followed by a strong bitterness with raisin, plum, and a bit of heat in the back finish. Mouthfeel is thin-bodied and crisp up front.

Hearty, boozy malts are prevelant and a slightly sticky and medicinal feel. The malts only slightly overpower the hops, so while there is a good sweetness and some hop bite the sweetness doesn't stick out like it should. Thicker, less carbonation leads to a dry, bready finish w/ minimal sweetness as the ABV kicks in here.

The smells are of alcohol, hops, grapefruit, caramel, toffee, The feel is somewhat thick and tingly. The taste is good, plenty of hops, some caramel and toffee malts, definite alcohol burn.","DavidST","Mar 18, 2012"

Has some nice lacing and the head takes some time to settle. Smell is hard candy, burnt carmel, pine cones, and alcohol. Taste is better, very aggressive hops on the finish, all the stuff in the nose, but more balanced. Body is on medium large, good a mount of life for its large ABV, a little dry, and fairly drinkable for its large size. This is a nice Barleywine, that prefer with a few years on it for some reason. Its not the aggressive hops, but the beer seems to blend better over time.","SawDog505","Mar 09, 2012"

4.45,11.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Stone's description explains the change in character for 2012. Chinook, Calypso and Cascade hops were substituted for the recent usual East Kent Goldings. I like the change, but it is clearly different--like seeing an old friend after years a part. If you are a follower of the hop god at all, I would try a bottle of this beer.","FightingEntropy","Mar 04, 2012"

1.56,-60.9,3,2,1,3,1,"Big disappointment from Stone. I eagerly awaited this since it was new to the Twin Cities market. It looks fine, but the smell is just fumey with booze and a few hops thrown in. I even get a weird rubber smell in there. The taste is harsh and bitter with an alcohol burn. The mouthfeel is fine, but that's not enough to save this brew. I know Stone likes their hops but this is too much. Maybe some age could save this. This is like the Thunderbird of barleywine.","sacrelicio","Feb 27, 2012"

For once the hops aren't the star of the show, but the malt in this case. The only blind taste test identifier is the uniqueness of this brew. This is one slick/syrupy/sweet tasty beer that gracefully coats your mouth. It also looks gorgeous. I would say ""Old Guardian 2012"" is another winner. I recommend you buy this.
