Slightly floral but overpowering bitterness. Taste: too bitter for a barley wine. Similar to Sierra Nevada hop hunter. Floral hoppy finish but bitterness, even for a high ibu lover, was unpleasant. Feel: very light not typical of barley wine. Too much carbonation. Overall: not great. Not impressed.","DKMII","Mar 27, 2015"

The taste is similar but a little less assertive than the aroma would indicate. It's well-blended, but just a little short in the definitive characteristics present in the aroma. It has a nice weight to the body and fullness on the palate.","delta490","Feb 21, 2015"

A bitter barleywine-style ale that has just the right amount of kick to get you squealing, but sweet enough to have you going back for more. Was glad that I picked up a bottle of this for myself, and would gladly do so again to have a break from the norm. Well done!","TheCraftBrewReview","Feb 16, 2015"

Drinks beautifully now, and I'm tempted to get another bottle and age it for yet another year or so. Oddly enough, reminds me quite a bit of Rogue's Brutal Bitter and also their Yellow Snow as far as flavor is concerned. Just a nice, mellow conglomeration of the caramel, wood and citrusy flavors. Not only would I like to age this, but I'd also like to try this fresh. Probably my favorite Avery brew to date.","TheSixthRing","Jan 14, 2015"

4.2,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 11/25/2012. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, herbal, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and caramel/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, bread, light pine, herbal, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, bread, herbal, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of citrus/floral hop and caramel/bready malt flavors; with a great sweetness/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barelywine. All around great balance and complexity of citrus/floral hops and caramel/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 27, 2014"

Not an alcohol burn, but a nice inner warmth. Huge difference. Very easy to drink, and if Avery ever started to distro to Las Vegas, I'd be stocked up on this.","Rizalini","Jan 26, 2014"

A nice nutty chocolate bar note was present (which I enjoy in barleywines) along with some very sweet, candy type malts. The mouthfeel was spot on; smooth, creamy, and warming. Overall, a recommend American style barleywine that is progressing nicely with age. Would love to try some variations of this beer like double dry hopping, barrel ageing, etc.","CowsandBeer","Jan 15, 2014"

APPEARANCE: red amber body; opaque. as twilight; white, opulent head; lacing is more than substantial.. AROMA: robust, bold hops; a candid, malty, grape-driven undercurrent hoists an intensely fragrant mass of East Coast pinecone... PALATE: a Javert-sized presence, proud and overbearing; strong, rum-like burn on the tongue; in time, the effect numbs and comforts, removing its bite as stronger spirits do...TASTE: malty--caramel immediately and often (chestnut too?), heavy at the throat; the 104 IBUs are tamped down but cloy enough to keep; same astringency in the exhale detracts slightly from an otherwise powerful flavor ... OVERALL: Admittedly, the wine drinking in the film played slightly with my perspective, but tasting this malty wine of a beer also made the film even more vibrant...BIG is the word this beer warrants--a handsome, dangerous fist in a snifter, resilient as Valjean .","dacrza1","0"

In the flavor, lofty sweetness balanced by a dry earthy bitterness. Too substantially malty to be considered a big double IPA, which is what I first was thinking, It fits the bill of American Barleywine. Full bodied, syrupy feel. Alcohol is present in the taste and feel. Drinkable, though it manages to be rather bitter and quite sweet at the same time, not perfectly balanced.

Strong hop and light malt aroma. Nice creamy body; hops, light malt some citrus. Finishes with hops. Leans towards an Imperial IPA. Could use a bit more malt for balance.

The aroma is of resinous piney hops with caramel malts. The aroma is very hop forward. The taste is malty and dank from the hops up front. The malt profile of this beer provides breadiness and some sweetness to this beer. The hop profile is very piney and resinous. It has a nice balance. The alcohol is very well hidden in the flavor. The flavors become much better as the beer warms. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. This is a very good beer.","acevenom","Jul 24, 2012"

You can spend time detecting each unique flavor as you begin to pull apart everything that went into the beer. Unfortunately this beer is just a mess of hops and alcohol. It is hard to make out anything distinct and the hops leave such a bitter bite in your mouth that even when you are ready for the next sip they are still on your tongue.","LeeryLeprechaun","Jul 15, 2012"

In the aroma i get the caramel, hops, toffee and dark fruits. The taste is a well balanced tastes of hops, alcohol, toffee, dark fruits snd citrus. This beer has a rather dry finish to it and has a thick sticky feel to it and is so far the best tasting barley wine I have tried. Thank you Avery Brewing for this heavenly brew. If there is a heaven and beer is there I know this would be one of them.","DannyDan","Jul 11, 2012"

Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and onion. The flavor was of sweet malt, onion, onion hop, grass, earth, and subtle citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. Nothing on this one really stood out to me with the exception of the onion presence I picked up on. The alcohol on this one was really well hidden which was a nice touch. However, the onion presence was just a little too dominant for my palate and probably covered up a lot of subtle flavors and aromas in this one. Worth trying if you love the style or Gubna...","thagr81us","May 29, 2012"
3.95,0,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Hog Heaven pours a slightly dull mahogany color, lightening towards burnt orange when better lit. Three fingers of cream colored foam crown the beer, fading quickly at first before eventually showing some staying power. The nose is dominated by dank, resinous hops, with just a little bit of caramel present in the background. The caramel swirl that opens the flavor profile is brief, but firm, before a potent shot of bitterness runs through things mid palate. The finish is decidedly hoppy, with lots of piney hops marking this a clear American version of the style. The sweet beginning becomes a little more lingering as the beer warms some. The body just doesn't quite have the heft or sturdiness of a barleywine, it's a little on the dry side. The carbonation, while present enough to give the hop aromas/flavors a boost, doesn't become distractingly bubbly. Hog Heaven is an all around solid American Barleywine","axeman9182","May 28, 2012"

Smells thick and big, like a hopped up amber kind of with some aroma of fresh juicy peaches, toffee, doughy and orange. Sweet in the forefront but the dry hops are certainly there. Flavor matches the aroma quite well but not as thick on the palate as the aroma was on the olfactory senses. Starts off sweet, some orange toffee, that is followed by the introduction of some earthy bitterness that stays with you through the finish. As it warms, the toffee and sweetness to this one becomes stronger and stronger. A crisp maybe medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, my first barleywine and I wasn't sure what to expect. What I have heard about the style suggested I wouldn't like it so went out of my way to try this one since i heard it wasn't typical for the style. Not sure I am a huge fan of the style over all but I enjoyed this one, has me thinking super hoppy imperial amber, and it certainly has a place.","denver10","Apr 25, 2012"

The head is thin, but still manages a very artful lacing on the glass. Big aroma here, hops on the flowery side are the main notes, roses come to mind. The Hog Heaven is smooth, with big malt flavor up front and a hoppy finish that bring those roses to mind again. A bit of bitter in the aftertaste. While high in alcohol, it does not come through in the flavor.

Only the overly-pungent aftertaste marks an unwelcome twist to this beer, and while that can easily be remedied by taking another swig, I'm not sure that, at 9.2% ABV, that's going to always be a good idea.

3.53,-10.6,4.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a good Barleywine, it's pretty solid. I thought this was going to be like most of the Barleywines I have had and very malt forward, but once I looked at the label and saw this was a 100 IBU's I knew this was going to be heavy on the hops, and it was, but a lot those nice citrus hop aromas never made their way to the flavor, but all their bitterness did. This beer is a sipper so it doesn't have a lot of drinkability, I am glad I am splitting this bomber with my brother, the high bitterness and very noticeable 9.2% of alcohol give this beer a low amount of drinkability. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma and look, it had a nice mixture of citrus fruits mixed with sweet caramel malts, its smelled like a good DIPA and it looked really good in my snifter. What I liked least about this beer was the bitterness and the booziness, if both were toned down little it would help the flavor out and make this beer much more drinkable, I could see buying this beer again when looking for a hoppy Barleywine, it also was a pretty good value for $6.49, but I tend to like my Barleywines more balanced so I would for sure choose Third Coast Old Ale over this beer. This beer is worth giving a try especially if you like Barleywines heavy on the hops. This was my second beer from Avery and so far I think they are good brewing company I would like to try more of their beers. Not my favorite Barleywine but still a solid hoppy Barleywine, this might be a good beer to age to see what it turns it turns into when the hops fade.","StoutHunter","Oct 30, 2011"

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pour a slightly hazy copper orange with a 1 inch puffy off-white head that settles to a small cap. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and lots of citrus zest aromas. Alcohol aromas come out as the beer warms. Taste is of sweet malt, caramel, and zesty citrus zest flavors. A mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp carbonation with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. An alcohol warmth hits the back of the throat after each sip. Overall, this is a good but hoppy barleywine with an alcohol kick.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 13, 2011"

Another big beer, with plenty of bright citrusy hops over an assertive caramel malt backbone. It's nice, but you've had this before. Mouthfeel is big and well-carbed, and the drinkability is about average. This is a good, hop-forward beer that's probably closer to malt-heavy DIPAs like 90 Minute. In fact, it reminds me a lot of 90 Minute. It's really not worth the price premium over it.","shand","Oct 04, 2011"

More saccharine notes as I keep digging, some caramel candied apple I guess as I'm getting huge caramel notes and some light red delicious apple notes as well. Taste is sweet, almost overly so. More candied notes, caramel in the finish with big hop notes as per the nose. Sticky and lightly boozy mouthfeel, very sweet and only moderately drinkable - this sample was sufficient.

4.3,8.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Big and bold flavor here. It says 104 IBUs on the bottle, and while it is definitely bitter, it is a very well balanced bitterness. The bitterness seems to come in strong at the back of the palate, and then slowly ease up as complex flavors of dried fruit, caramel malts and a warming breath of alcohol. The dried fruit is very subdued, but I'm getting a taste of apricot from somewhere. As it warms, the caramel comes out more in a way that complements the floral hops very well. The dry-hopping is evident in its dry and crisp mouthfeel but juicy finish, not to mention the huge floral hop taste. Overall, this is a pretty fantastic beer and one of the better barleywines I've tasted. The intense bitterness makes for a very interesting take on the style, and one that I'm enjoying very much. Nicely done Avery.","chodinheaven","Sep 05, 2011"

I could tell it would be hopp(ier) by the aroma; taste is where I put my emphasis: caramel, malt, and a bit of fruitiness with a fair bitterness finish that stays with ya. This is another nice effort from Adam and Co. It's great fresh (yes, Adam and Ratman!) but I tend to like it aged a bit to let some of the hops fade a bit.

Smells of hops, lots of citrus, grapefruit. Very smooth texture, then WHAM! KABOOM! HOP BOMB! Those hops waste no time attacking the pallet. Despite the hops this comes off as very smooth. It has a nice malt finish that isn't too sugary, but definitely sweet, but then is intercepted by some more hops. Hops, hops hops. Very much part of the west coast tradition of hoppy barley wines. A few more months of aging and the malts would probably show some more, but still wouldn't impress me much.","100floods","0"
4.07,3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5," The taste is quality with good hop flavor and mild caramel in the malt, more stone fruit than anything coming from the yeast/malt blend and mild piney bitter hop accents. The taste has subtle sweetness in the finish which seems to lessen the impact of the alcohol which is present in the taste. Overall I think this is a quality barlewyine - I am not sure why it took me this long to review it. Perhaps I did but misplaced the notes -I have had it a few times and still remember the first time at Kclinger's in Hanover.

3.7,-6.3,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is a clear, ruby coloring with a chunky, tall, beige tower of foamy head. The head recedes a little while drinking, but manages to maintain throughout the beer as a whole. Smells are so well blended that it is hard to pick out, but here goes. I get a lot of fruit notes, but subtle. Almost an apple pie type smell, with apples and cinnamon, but other spices present, also. Definite malty notes in the nose, too. The beer has a strong malt backbone, with sour notes flowering off, as well as a smooth spicy characteristic that is a little cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Other flavors include some dark fruits, like prunes and raisins, as well as some booze tastes. The beer is remarkably smooth for all the flavors, but the aftertaste lingers quite a while. The aftertaste consists of the spices, as well as a sour undertone. The finish is dry, and leaves the palate wanting more. Very interesting Barleywine.","GarthDanielson","Feb 13, 2011"

The taste holds notes of strong pine and grapefruit rind, light onion, and a thoroughly dominated caramel/toffee blend in the background.

Malt overload as a dry, bready/doughy medium body w/ a touch of alcohol bleeding as well as some caramel, toffee, chocolate and roasted malts are in there as well for a touch of sweetness. Even has a bit of sticky syrupiness. Some bitter herbal hops and fruits like grape and orange are in there as well although the malts are more powerful.

I'd say it smells sweet. As I expected it's kind of sweet. Caramel up front and dark fruits and a somewhat metallic finnish. Not bad, I do feel like fresh this would be a hoppy one. I'd love to get a hold of a fresh bottle, but I did sit on this one for about a month. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and syrupy with low carbonation.

Sherry-like alcohol is much smoother than the younger version, but still biting. Pleasant with some rough edges still poking through that would probably never smooth out. More dark fruit in the older version and more complex to my tastebuds. It aged well I thought but not might improve any more. Very fun comparison, I prefer the aged version.

The maltiness has not come up to meet the hops deficit in any way -- it is a bit thin and mealy with no real complexity. The alcohol burn has decreased and because of the blandness it is smoother.

The first thing I taste is the sweetness from the malt and then comes the pine and citrus. I really enjoyed the transition from sweet to bitter in this beer. Just when you think sweet barley wine, you get hit with hops at the end. It's very drinkable and smooth.

The head forms and retains at about two fingers for a good amount of time. Pretty thick lacing already starts to form at the top of the glass around the creamy head. As the bottle exploded I already started to get hints of a massive sweet malt backbone and huge hops. The malts smell of the amber sort with a sweetness that may be a bit over done. The hops are mostly piney but also somewhat earthy. The malts are certainly the dominant factor in this nose. I would like it to be a tiny bit less sweet though. The strength of the nose is something that brews should follow after. Taste is pretty much the same. Massive amount of amber malt and sweetness. The sweets are the only thing I don't like. If it was toned down, this beer would be world class. The piney and earthy hops help balance out the flavor and add a nice aspect to the beer. There are also some fruity flavors in the taste, fruit peels as well. The flavor is big like a Barleywine and lacks an alcohol bite, at 9.2% that is pretty impresive. Mouthfeel has a pretty thick, creamy body with carbonation that is a bit low but suits the flavor. There is a moderate amount of warming, which is nice in this type of beer. The hops leave a huge coat of flavor on the tongue. Drinkability is alright here. The price is decent, the taste is good but the sweetness starts to take over the beer toward the end of my bomber. Good example of a Barleywine, wouldn't mind trying it on tap some time.","cbutova","Jan 09, 2010"

I'm not real experienced with barley wines, as this is only the second I've sampled. I thought the smell was better than the taste on this one. Seems this is hop heavy for the style from what I've read, which is in my favor. It's a good beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have another...at this time anyway.

If feels at times closer to a DIPA but also failing at that since that does not seem its goal. It is not that it needs to fit necessarily to a standard style but the hoppiness translates here as bitterness with a fizzy carbonated feel that lacks the roundness of a DIPA (and I love what Avery does with its Maharaja for instance) and its true that US barley wines are typically far hoppier and maltier than their English counterparts but it is not that it is going in that direction. It has little of the complexities, or some direction of balance, or promised sweet notes of a barley wine. Mind you, it remains a good brew in that it is not a pain at all to drink it but there is plenty stuff out there that I'll chose over this one both from Avery and in particular elsewhere in terms of barley wines.","Daniellobo","Sep 19, 2009"

You definitely get some of the bitterness from the 100 IBU's. It has a pollen and grapefruit style of bitterness. It gives off some alcohol warmth but not much. It has average carbonation to the mouthfeel. It is not as heavy in the body as many might think. I would go the higher end of medium.

Foam fades out quite a bit leaving a thin coating of swirly islands with some spotty lacing. Nose shows off tons of citrus rind and piney hops with some caramel and toffee notes waffing in the background. Very IPA like in the aroma department here. Palate is full, slick and creamy with a fine carbonation fizz. Flavors are pretty well balanced between the malts and hops for a western US BW. The hoppy citrus and pine flavors do dominate, but there is a nice sweet malty contribution with tastes of melted caramels, toffee and roasted malts. A decent level of warming alcohol comes in at the finish to let you know you're drinking a hefty brew. Good stuff, but considering the $7.49 price not a great value.","macster","Beers"

There is pine like resin hops and some grapefruit to go along with the sweet, caramel malt, yeast, and alcohol. The appearance is great with a three and a half finger head (also not common for the style) and deep amber color. The flavor is just like the aroma, it's not complex but it's tasty. The palate is sticky and smooth like one would expect for the style. The aftertaste is astringently bitter with some butterscotch.

Strong steady carbonation, perfection for this strong style considering lasting head on a barleywine is a rare happening. Filling juicy mouthfeel, nice easy bitter finish makes you wanting more. Amazing flavor, very hoppy resembling a well crafted IPA that gets over on a rather sweet malt content.

The malts have a mild touch of biscuits with some honey lingering amidst the overall hop bomb tha is this young barley wine. The palate is thick and full bodied, bu the IBU's seem to overwhelm the tast buds. I like young barley wines as much as well aged ones. But this onewas a bit too much for my palate.

Very hoppy,yet just as malty,awesome balance,but still leans to the citrusy,pine like hops that my taste buds crave. I also taste some subtle oak barrel flavors as well as sugary caramel. The body is full and has a nice roughness to the finish,a coarseness that adds depth and is needed because the alcohol is so well hidden.

The body is full and the alcohol is tasted in the mouth but it doesn't seem to matter as the overall moneyness of the beer fades your mind to a better place.

The taste is sweet malt up front with an explosion of bitter hops in the finish that linger in your mouth well after the sip. The taste is a lot smoother than most barleywines and the malt and hops seem to be working together in harmony to provide exceptional balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.

Strong American hop aromas like grapefruit, citrus, pine needles and peaches dominate; with toasted pale malt and a hint of alcohol in the background. Sweet caramel and toasted nut flavors upfront, followed by slight dextrin and faint vinous alcohol. The aftertaste displays highly fruity hop tones of orange peel and grapefruit rind, and an equally agressive resinous pine character. Medium-full bodied with an even and smooth carbonation that lifts enough sweetness to prevent cloyng, but leaves hop resins and residual caramel on the tounge. Finishes a touchy fruity with a hints of vinous alcohol and a diliberate bitterness. The hop flavor and bitterness have faded somewhat over time but still balance this out very well, allowing the malt profile to become more pronounced and giving the beer a more well-rounded flavor.

Citrus fruit, pine needles, spicy hops, and a tad of grassyness. Prickly hop notes dance on the tongue. Dryer finish with a sharp bitterness.

There is excellent carbonation which lets the tastes dance on the tongue without getting to tired or overdeveloped.

Ok, yeah, most of those hops are just bitter, but you still get a taste of citrus in there (especially in the nasty aftertaste). The body, like the flavor, is way light for a BW. Weird.

The mouthfeel is of crisp, strong carbonation but it is not dominant or overpowering-- it still allows you to enjoy the ale's sweetness. The presence of the alcohol is also present in the taste, but ever so slightly. This beer is drinkable, but I couldn't make it a session ale.

3.95,0,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a 17 ounce snifter, Hog Heaven is burnt orange in appearance with a light beige foam crown, large bubbles glistening with hop oils. Nose is extremely hop-forward; fresh pine sap and the most bitter grapefruit pith imaginable. Nostril-stinging in the way that only the most aggressive Double IPAs can be. At first the malt presence seems understated because the hops are so prevalent in the taste. Bitter hop finish with an ever-so-slight mineral twang at the end. Aftertaste of pine-laced grapefruit rinds. Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style, which lends an easiness to the drinkability, but in the end leads me to believe that they just didn't put enough malt into this beer. There is also a subtle oily slickness on the palate. Cannabis-flavored burps. As it warms, the malts emerge a bit more with a dark caramel flavor, but it's still insanely hoppy. Overall, it seems that Hog Heaven is quite a bit off for the style -- it strikes me as more of an DIPA along the lines of Southern Tier's Unearthly Imperial IPA (although that one has a much thicker, more syrupy mouthfeel). Lots of grey between many styles, I know....This is just a good example of the arbitrariness of such lines. In any case, I enjoyed this beer.","orfeu","May 20, 2006"

I don't think I've ever had a barleywine that tasted so much like fresh hops. Maybe this needs a little bit of aging before the brewery releases it.

Moderately strong bitterness with plenty of sweetness to start; alcohol, earthiness, and wood/oak came out in the middle. The end showed some sweet fruitiness, caramel, and a bit of citrus, followed by a medium dry, bitter finish. Carbonation was a little on the high side, but it was integrated well and contributed to a creaminess in the texture. There was some astringency though, as well as some residual sugar and stickiness.

The finish is bitter, but not overwhelming and prevents the sweetness from overpowering the beer. Mouthfeel is medium with a thick body but too much carbonation for a barleywine.

Sugar and caramel are there and do not go away. Spicy hops attempt to mutiny, but are turned back. Some citrous comes in but is also put down by the malts.

The aroma is thick and concentrated with aromas of candied citrus fruits, alcohol, strawberries, and lightly toasted biscuits. This beer has a light sweet with definite notes of caramel and citrus. It is fairly light on the palate, especially for a Barlywine. This beer has a fair amount of hoppy bitterness in the finish as well as a bit of astringent earthy woody hops. This is not quite as explosively hoppy as I was hopping and the alcohol is a bit too hot and evident in the finish.

Huge hop flavors dominated. Big, citrus flavors, mainly grapefruit coupled with the massive taste of pine. Also quite spicy. Not as malty as I would've expected at first but as it warmed, big sweet caramel flavors began to show through. This stuff really tasted more like a super IPA than a barleywine but nonetheless, still a solid beer. Overall, it tasted like an over-the-top Celebration.

4.48,13.4,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"From what I'm reading on the bottle this sounds to be right up my alley, 100 IBUs, 9.2% ABV, and 2 1/2 pounds of Columbus dry hops in every barrel. I went with a standard shaker pint on this one, and it poured out beautifully. The body is a perfectly translucent ruby-brown. I don't get much of a head out of it, but what is there does stick stoicly both to the top of the beer but as well as to the glass creating rings of lace. Moving the glass around wafts the hop aromas right up my nose, and the glass isn't even close. Closer inspection of the nose reveals the sweet caramelly malt as well as a great hop aroma. They portray pine, citrus rind, and I'm also picking up some woody/tannic notes on the nose. The beer feels a bit light on the palate as I begin to drink it. The malts do register staunchly with notes of toffee, and caramel as well as a simple sugary sweetness. The bitterness is the concrete foundation for the hop flavors that emerge later. The hops come across predominately as grapefruit and citrus rind. I'm also picking up some more of those tannic notes in the flavor and I wonder if this beer is spending any time in wooden barrels. The alcohol presence is very light for it's large ABV. In all honesty this beer reminds me quite a bit of Arrogant Bastard but it has it's own characteristics as well. Definately a good beer, pick it up when you see it.","FormatKid","Jan 13, 2005"
4.2,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Unfortunately the year this was bottled isn't dated, I'm guessing it was bottled fairly recently though. Hog Heaven is ruby red in color with an really thin off-white head. The aroma is very strong of west coast hops, citrusy mainly. I really enjoyed the taste of this beer. The flavor seemed really hopped for a barley wine, at least compared to the handfull that I've had. This tastes strongly of citrusy hops. Winey, malty flavor is primarily noted in the beginning of a sip, vanilla flavor is noted. Just a slight taste of alcohol is also present. This is very complex; the different tastes mix well together and the high hoppiness makes this beer stand out. I guess this is a barley wine for hopheads.","Gagnonsux","Jan 08, 2005"

Smell is a huge boquet of fruityness, piney hops, and malty sweetness. The taste is definately more hops than malt, which I find to be refreshing in a barleywine. Nice move. Piney bitterness, yet there's that juicy fruity ripeness that makes this style so awesome. Fruity malts are the backbone of this beer but they take a back seat to the expressive hops. Dry finish and great smooth mouthfeel. Overall a great barleywine that's not overpowering at all. Oink Oink. Ok, that was lame...","twelvsies","Jan 03, 2005"

The taste is initially very sweet, even a bit too sweet but it really evens out when the hops comes in. There is tons of hop bitterness with very little else besides the overriding sweetness on the top. The taste is more natural tasting that some beers, like it had raw cane sugar or something of the like. The mouthfeel feels thicker than it is because of the sweetness, but the dryness and bitterness of the beer takes this down a bit.

It really smells like a big IPA. The taste has the same floral and citrus character that is in the nose, along with some sweetness. I expected more of an alcohol burn, but its pleasantly mild.

The head that was produced off white to light brown in color, thick rich, bubbly, and decently sticky, kind of like cappuccino coffee head. Lace was very present, sheets in places and intricate in other places. Visually a decent beer. The aromas that came from the glass were a combination of bittersweet malts and bitter hops (citrusy and piney) (more hops then malts), citrus fruits (lemon, grapefruit), pine tree, spices (light) and alcohol notes. Tastes were mostly a combination of different hops (bitter, grapefruity, piney, etc) malts were somewhat noticeable (some sweetness, tad roasted) in the middle, light spices (combination of hops and fresh), some warming alcohol notes but finished with more hops. Aftertaste  hops. Body was on the full side especially as it warmed. My opinion of this beer was more of an IPA/Imperial then barleywine but incredibly smooth, creamy, warming and very drinkable. But with a 9.2% ABV this beer will take you out and fast, but what a way to go.

The subsequent lacing was minimal and very patchy. The nose was boldly hoppy, obviously this is an American barleywine; I detect nothing English/traditional about it. Behind the juicy citrus and piney hops was a weak note of toasty malt. Im in love with the aromas of the hops; it is mouthwatering with its invitation. Will the palate live up to the hype created by the nose? The palate is a load, wow; it staggers the senses with flavor. Both the massive hops bitterness (and flavor) and the burning alcohol angrily vie for the focal point of this beer. Who wins? Both. They both kicked my tongues ass. The hoppiness was very flavorful, raw pine needles, grapefruit and lime zest, and fleshy citrus too; it is amazingly dry and raw at the finish. What the malt brings to the table, flavor-wise, is frankly little. The toasty caramel-toffee sweetness is weak in comparison to the alcohol heat. It burns so sweet! I really like the flavor construction on this beer; it is huge, unbalanced, forceful but very tasty. Granted I couldnt, nor would I want too, drink this everyday. I found the mouthfeel to be indifferent, Id say it is medium-full in bulk, modest carbonation but there is nothing noteworthy about the physical impression. It could be fuller, maybe even rounder; yes, Id like more malt. The alcohol is not hidden. The drinkability is quite good. I think this is on par with Old Crusty, Bigfoot, or Arrogant/Double Bastard. If you enjoy any of those beverages, seek this one out. If you dont like any of those beers, avoid Hog Heaven.

After the hops you do get a good dose of malt, more than I expected from the nose, a nice sweet caramely character that carries through to a subtly bitter finish. Spicy notes and alconhol become more apparent as the Hog warms up a bit. Body isn't very heavy at all for a barleywine, but the sweetness would make it tough to drink more than one of these.

It's warming now and coming alive with great aromas. The body on this is quite full and smooth. The bittering hops are noticable in the finish which is also just a tad dry.

But barley wine is one style at which I've had to work to develop an appreciation. Perhaps that is why I was so taken with Hog Heaven, as it seems to bridge, or perhaps defy, a strict classification as a barley wine. Big malty sweetness, edging into Belgian territory with a rock candy sweetness. Offsetting this to perfection was an aggressively pungent, piney hops bittering. I'm amazed that the high degree of sweetness in the beer was not cloying, but somehow they managed to balance the act. This could almost be put in the strong ale or imperial IPA category, with the show of big hops, but that would seem inappropriate for the malt profile.

On the other hand, the malts are there to calm down those 100 IBUs and ensure a good drinkability, but WHERE IS THE BODY!

It was a dark red color with a nice off white head that lasted a little bit. This was the best part of this beer. I took a wiff and was turned off by the hoppiness. It tated pretty much like it smelled. However, at 9.2% it tasted better as the 1pt6oz went down. It was easier to consume the farther into the beer you got. I would not get another one however. not my kind of brew.","Ellbert","May 26, 2003"

The Drinkability is pretty good though. While heavy hops, the over all impression isn’t bad, but doesn’t enter into the good category in my humble opinion.","HardTarget","May 10, 2003"

3.67,-7.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear mahogany in color with a thin, light tan head. Aroma is sweet and bursting with earthy hops and a lightly fruity malt. Alcohol is quite evident. Taste starts with a sweet, somewhat apple-like fruity malt, with a very strong raw, herbal/grassy hop flavor. Alcohol is very evident in the flavor as well, again in a sort of raw, unprocessed way. Body has a sort of lemony crispness to it from the hops, and the finish is quite dry. Overall the flavor profile strikes me as rather unbalanced on the hop side  methinks they may have made too much out of getting to 100 IBUs on this one. Malt sweetness shines through for a brief moment and then is completely overwhelmed. I only bought this bottle a few months ago, so perhaps aging for a year or two would mellow this beer out a bit.","mzwolinski","Beers"

4.25,7.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"The front is sweet and somewhat fruity. The middle is buttery, malty, full. There is alcohol in this beer. The finish is a very hoppy, hopped hoppiness. And bready. There is an interesting, subtle licorice aftertaste. This beer has all the good flavors of a barleywine plus the strong hops, plus that creamy taste. The alcohol is a little too obvious in taste. The hops are in-your-face, but not as much as say, the Bigfoot 2003. I'm going to go back and buy another one of these to cellar. I'm guessing one year will be perfect for this beer to decide how to balance itself a little better.","kbub6f","Mar 01, 2003"
3.95,0,4,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Medium-amber in color with slight chill-haze forms a sticky dark beige head atop small to medium-sized bubbles after a vigorous pour. Lacing is excellent, retention is good, and carbonation is mild. Aroma is intensely dry-hopped for a barley-wine, with herbal, grassy Columbus hops and caramelized, sugary malts. Towards the bottom of the glass, the malts start to predominate in aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth with a firm body. Taste begins with a big surge of green, earthy flavor hops, followed by a brief metallic note, and leading into the thick, sticky caramelized malts. Dark fruit flavors are minimal. The lightly dry finish is well-balanced with subtle toasted grain notes nicely complementing the rather mild in potency, but harsh in mouthfeel, long-lasting leafy bitterness. The alcohol is never noticeable. As it warms, the hops mellow out and the beer takes on a better balance. This is a good beer, but I prefer my barley-wines with more balance...i.e.-more malt with dark fruit character and less hops.","Mitchster","Feb 11, 2003"

3.75,-5.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"It pours amber with a fairly thick tan head that leaves traces to the bottom of the glass. The smell is almost all hops with a noticeable aroma of alcohol and just a trace of grapefruit underlying the hops. In a somewhat strange turn, the malt is quite noticeable at first but seems to diminish as the beer warms. Unfortunately, this allows the hops to knock everything out of balance, leaving just hops, pronounced alcohol, and cloying sweetness to finish things. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. As others have said, this beer is reminiscent of a highly hopped IPA.","mickeymac","Jan 20, 2003"

3.9,-1.3,4,4,4,3,4,"I love it when pigs fly! Pours a cloudy burnt sienna color with a fairly dense tan head that fades pretty quickly to 1/4 inch leaving a clingy lace. Looks like fresh apple squeezings. Very hoppy floral aroma, earthy malts, piney. Great hop presence on the tongue, alcohol, mollasses. Suprisingly sweet with a perfect hop bite. Thin mouthfeel with light to medium carbonation. Pretty drinkable but the alcohol is definitely there to slow you down some.","cretemixer","Jan 01, 2003"
4.27,8.1,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a nice light reddish mahogany color with a thin white head with many large bubbles. Strong aroma of fresh grass and floral hopsalmost overwhelming. Theres a lot going on in the taste. Notes of crisp lemon and citrus, sweet malts, and pine resin are all present up front with a blast of bitter hops to follow along with a warming 9.2% ABV. The most disappointing thing about this brew is the fact that its a bit thin in the mouth. Other than that, I really like it.","Morris729","Dec 22, 2002"
4.04,2.3,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Hog Heaven is a barleywine boasting 9.2% abv and 100 IBU's right on the label. This is no ordinary beer. As I pour, I noticed very little carbonation, but huge clouds of fresh, grassy, herbal hop aroma are pouring out of my glass. Nice color but no real head, which is somewhat the norm for barleywines. On first taste, you very briefly sense some sweetness but it is quickly and brutally overwhelmed by the 2.5lbs of Columbus hops they pour into each barrel. The body is oddly thin, and essentially flat which only serves to amplify the main focus of this beer: HOPS. I started drinking this one cold and let it warm along the way. The only real change I noticed was I could detect the alcohol presence more when warmer. If you don't like hops give this one wide berth. I enjoyed this beer and its nice exposition of our bittering friend, but I think I would like it more with at least a little more carbonation and body.","comat0se","Nov 21, 2002"
3.92,-0.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beers pours a deep ruby red color with an Antaean head, the consistency frothy and the resident lace, thick sticky sheets that weld themselves to the glass. Quite a big hit of the hop flowers, fusel alcohol, and a lemon lime crispness that tries unsuccessfully to hide the 9.2% ABV. Front is malt and somewhat sweet, the top skinny in feel with the finish masterfully acidic and Titanicaly hopped, the aftertaste alcohol bitter and long lasting. Meant for the lovers of Robust high alcohol beers, as it is a really belly warmer and one that will take the hide off an Armadillo.","Gusler","Nov 19, 2002"
4.12,4.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Hoo-yeah! I am really liking these higher-ABV beers now that they are available in Ohio. The aroma floodgates were opened from the minute I cracked this one open!

Very good beer that left me with a pleasant buzz.","Dogbrick","Nov 09, 2002"
4.97,25.8,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Pours an orange/amber color with a thin white head. Strong hop aroma. Decent malty body with alot of hops, think Ruination.

3.67,-7.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Hazy deep amber color with a small off-white head, mildly carbonated with thick lace that throughly coats the glass.  Though the head is small, it retains fairly well.  A pungent aroma of grapefruit rind is noticeable in the aroma several feet from the glass.  Pine sap is also prominent, along with sweet fruit notes.  Upon tasting, sweet malts initially dominate, but are swiftly overlaid by the massively bitter grapefruit hops.  The sweet molasses-like character of the malt lingers on as an undercurrent to the taste, quelled but never vanquished.  Throughout the taste there are also various fruit notes which rise and fall: melon, raisins, berries, and others.  Though the alcohol content of this beer is high, even for a barleywine, alcohol notes seem to have only a minimal impact upon the taste.  But after drinking half a glass, the presence of the alcohol cannot be doubted.  To be handled with due discretion.","Pegasus","Aug 26, 2002"

Not a huge head on this one although what head sticks around laces the glass a bit. Dark amber in color. The aroma is identical to the taste. HOPS!! The lable states that 2.5 pounds of Columbus hops are used in each barrel, and believe me, I can taste every ounce of them. Although the beer boasts an IBU rating of 100, you could never tell. It is hoppy tasting, but not in a bitter way. This beer is definaty on my list to purchase again.","sinistersteve","Jul 20, 2002"
3.85,-2.5,4.5,4.5,3,3,5,"Dark bronze in hue w/ excellent clarity, topped by an off white sticky head that leaves intricate lace.  Pungent citrusy, herbal and slightly piney dry hopped Columbus hop nose along with medium caramel and lightly buttery malt in aroma.  The taste falls a bit short of the promise of the aroma, unfortunately.  Hop bitterness dominates the flavor profile, while generic caramel malt sweetness provides contrast; complexity in overall malt character was thus lacking.  Slightly toasty malt indicates a small proportion of Munich malt in the grist.  Light in body for a barleywine.  Hop flavor is identical to the hop nose, being citrusy, herbal and piney... Columbus is a beautiful American hop.  Although overall depth in flavor was a bit lacking, Hog Heaven exhibits excellent drinkability.  Finishes very clean, with a bittersweet combination of caramel sweetness and hop bitterness slowly fading.  Hog Heaven is reminescent of an ""imperial"" IPA / barleywine hybrid and seems more apt of an ""American Strong Ale"" label.  Dangerous drinkability.","marc77","Jun 19, 2002"
3.43,-13.2,4.5,4,3,3,3.5,"All right, if you are a hop-head this is going to be great beer, with its 100 IBUs and 2.5 lb./barrel Columbus dry hop. If however, you are a malt man you might be a little disappointed.","mattmaples","Apr 24, 2002"

Review may change later due to this.","Wildman","Apr 24, 2002"
4.6,16.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"with obvious sediment floating around.  There are a couple things of note in the aroma:  high caramel malt presence and a high hop presence/ bitterness perceived (probably from the Columbus dry hop).   First taste is very pleasant.  For 100 IBU, this is not as bitter as I thought it would be.  (Of course, it may have settled down over time as well.)  Taste is actually more sweet than bitter.  Very nice though.  There are not a lot of obtrusive tastes in this BW.  This is highly drinkable for a barleywine.  This has a great sweet malt backbone.  It has some bitterness, but not over the top at all.  Nice subdued fruity esters.  Great Barleywine.  While it is probably not my favorite (See Sierra Nevada), it is probably the most easy drinking Barleywine I've had.","Bighuge","Beers"
