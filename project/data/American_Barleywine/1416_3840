3.95,2.9,4.5,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Deep amberin color with razor thin heqd and minor lacing.  Smell is pungent hops, alcohol, black licorice, strawberry, and a minor cofffe note. Taste is hoppy up front, sweet fruit in the middle, and a lingering bittersweet oily finish.  Mouthful is medium with medium carbonation.  Overall a nice beer but not what i was expecting from a barleywine.","Slack","Mar 22, 2015"
4.1,6.8,4,4,4.25,4,4,"dark amber with light khaki head, touch of lace, Assertive hop aroma of eucalyptus with a touch of grapefruit. Flavor has hops upfront followed by burnt sugar/ caramel and orange marmalade finish. Tasty. strong. A beer with character.","fx20736","Mar 22, 2015"
4.24,10.4,5,4.75,4,4,4,"Velvet hammer here. Appearance is a large, long lasting, tan to cream-colored, thick head, plenty of lace, and a clear, dark amber hue. Aroma is leather, dark ripe fruit, dark malt, yeast, hops, and lumber. Flavor’s similar to nose, with sweet being up front and bitter heavy in the finish and just right carbonic tang to balance. Body is good, but the heavy bitter yields some coarseness. Ditto for the finish, with some off flavors, though overall, I’d definitely have, just not right away. I'd be especially curious to try it with some aging.","drpimento","Mar 21, 2015"

It's a bit nuttier than I expected, but it works well and is balanced by a lingering hop bitterness and some heat on the back-end. Even so, the alcohol is pretty well-masked and so it isn't too boozy at all. Overall, a real solid barleywine for a reasonable price.","beermeplz","Mar 01, 2015"

The aroma is fantastic, with rich dark fruit notes, lotsa raisin, toffee and some piney notes.  The flavor is similar, with caramel malt, figs, raisins, and a bit of hop bitterness. The alcohol is definitely present in the taste. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy for a Barleywine, with a very nice finish and aftertaste, nicely carbonated.

Overall appears a deep murky mahogany brown hue big tan head forming thick, with fine speckled lacing. Smells like an aged barleywine, what does that mean the hops have tamed, the malts are full of over ripened fruit and big alcohol notes. The smell is of spicy plum and raisin notes, that I can't quit sniffing on. Dark fruit, brown sugar, malt layers in the flavor, nothing like an aged Bigfoot, a hint of diacetyl or wet cardboard in the malt character just from oxidation. Plum and dark fruit sugars coat the palate, not bad at all...well aged smoothed out Anniversary IPA bottled on 10/12/12. Mouthfeel is creamy, effervescent carbonation medium bodied texture. Overall it's good barleywine, I'm intrigued to see what this beer tastes like fresh, with 2 years of age it's fantastic.","WVbeergeek","Mar 02, 2014"

Aroma is equally malts and hops; sweet leather, prunes, blackberries, a brandy-like alcoholic hotness in the nose. First sip is equal parts piney, resiny hop bitterness, and syrupy sweet alcohol warmth. Characteristics of an Arrogant Bastard distilled to 10.4% ABV, meaning I taste a similar hop profile (Chinook).Warms down the throat all the way to the belly. Thick and viscous in the mouth with a mild carbonic bite. Truly outstanding and worth trying if you see it.","Aaron_Ramson","Nov 20, 2013"

Pours very hazy and cloudy; almost opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, pine, raisin, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, citrus zest, floral, and piney earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity; but are pretty weak for a barleywine. Taste of toffee, toast, caramel, raisin, brown sugar, pine, brown bread, floral, grapefruit, orange zest, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Light pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of toffee, caramel, toast, raisin, pine, brown sugar, brown bread, grapefruit, orange zest, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt complexity; with a good amount of hop balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice barleywine style. Good balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 02, 2013"

Clarity is semi-hazy and head is a quarter-inch, cream-colored and frothy. Head eventually disperses into a tight band around the shoulders with an oily slick across the surface. Sheets and clusters of lacing exhibit excellent retention during the tasting and are refreshed with each tilt of the glass. Nose expresses some malty sweetness, candied prunes and piney hops. Taste follows nose; however, the piney hops are quite forward and suppress the malty sweetness. There's also a touch of chocolate in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a pretty good small format, easily accessible American Barleywine. Alcohol is really quite well-hidden. It might be worth putting a couple of these in the cellar to see what happens as the hops character dissipates over time.","Jwale73","Feb 05, 2013"

Toffee and caramel malt aromas are prominent. The hoppy aromas that others have noted have likely faded with this being nearly 2 years old. There is a hint of hop spiciness toward the end that accompanies the boozy aroma as this warms. Very smooth feel with lazy rich carbonation. Tangy citrus and ripe fruit flavors up front that slowly grows thru the middle. The strong toffee and caramel malt backbone is difficult to suppress throughout. Finishes fairly dry with a lingering sweet toffee flavor accompanied by a tangy hop bitterness.","IronLover","Feb 05, 2012"

3.5,-8.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Aroma of caramel malt and some brown sugar. Rather lacking in hops for such a young barleywine, with some earthy/chocolate hops coming out with a bit of warming. Flavor follows suit with caramel, some raisin and light brown sugar notes as well as a light touch of roast. This doesn't come across as overly sweet yet manages to mask the alcohol fairly well. It is evident on the nose but less so on the tongue. Finish is fairly full bodied but rather nondescript in its delivery. Overall an enjoyable pour but a bit lacking in complexity for the style. Age may help but I'm not keeping my fingers crossed and in fact this beer warms to offer a slightly oxidized hop aroma. Still worth a visit.","HalfFull","Sep 15, 2011"

This sucker's a beast! I couldn't and wouldn't drink more than one at a time. Two in one night would be death! Very different from others.

Tons of caramel in the aroma, grainy, malty and sweet, mild alcohol with a hint of fruit and toffee. The flavour threw me off initially, since it was very different than the aroma. Much fruitier up front, sort of a raisin sweetness throughout, but still with caramel and toffee. Bitterness wasn't prominent, always present but nicely balanced. Alcohol was well controlled. Decent texture, malty and full bodied with lowish carbonation, some dryness. Overall, it was enjoyable.","DrJay","Jul 15, 2011"

As is the fact that I bought this almost two years ago in Utah and just recently saw the same vintage available at a store here in Boston. Anyway, from a 12 oz. stubby, bottled 04/09/09, 72 IBUs. Pours a chill-hazed crimson, with low carbonation and topped with a thin tan cap that retains a thin collar and doesn't manage to lace the glass. Smells richly malty and caramelly, with coffee, roast, milk chocolate, floral alcohol and very heady, citric, oily and resinous hops. Still tastes quite hoppy at two years old, with the same hop profile that gives an almost harsh bitterness. Lots of melanoidins and crystal malts contribute a robust malty base and a bit of sweetness. The yeast is earthy and fruity, and there is a light booziness as well that helps lead into a warming, bitter finish. Medium to full on the palate, moderately-carbonated, with a tongue-scraping bitterness and powdery yeast feel. Not terribly complex, but it is smooth, delicious, well-integrated, and it has aged quite well so far. I would like to try this one at five years old to see how it's going.","mmmbeer","May 22, 2011"

Taste is initially a liquid caramel, but is quickly taken over by a lingering, slightly overpowering bitterness. The hops do not appear to be well integrated. A decent level of carbonation gives this medium-bodied ale a nice bite. Overall, the aromas were good but it's hard to get paste the sub-par flavors.

Head didn't last long, clung reasonably well, and was replenished by a small stream of bubbles from the bottom. Aroma was typical barleywine. A touch of evident alcohol, with a fair amount of grainy sweet. Too sweet for me. Trace of something that reminded me of banana and cloves. Taste had some hops, and also a tad of bitterness. Mellowed out some over time, but not typical barleywine flavors. Felt good in the mouth. Coated well and was nicely carbonated. Overall a middle of the road barleywine.

The taste is balanced, but not in a smooth way. The caramel and roasted notes do not mesh well with the citrus hop flavors, and the alcohol presence is a bit sharp.

The hops fade quickly to reveal more layers of malt. Brown sugar, prunes and dried cherries, and a bit of caramel. There's a touch of alcohol in the nose, but its quite restrained. The taste is caramel and burnt sugars. A little pine, and some alcohol. There is more alcohol in the taste than the aroma led me to believe. Long lingering hop bitterness and alcohol burn in the finish. Mouthfeel is a mix of syrupy water, body is a bit thinner than I would have liked, carbonation is low.

Maybe I'll try reviewing again in a few years if I can get my hands on some more of this vintage. The mouthfeel, while syrupy at times, was nicely thick for a barleywine. Drinkability?

4.03,4.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Glad my computer battery died mid-review last time around, here is the condensed version. Pours a very dark crimson brown with a one finger head (into a snifter) and leaves light creamy lacing behind. The retains decently and dies down to a ring around the side with clouds atop the beer. Smells initially like a double IPA hop bomb but soon becomes a nice mix of malts, hops and alcohol. Tastes of malts, piney hops, a bit of alcohol, dark fruits and nutty flavors. The balance is mostly good but seems to go towards malts and then back to huge hops at the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent creaminess to it. The carbonation is a tiny bit too much here for the flavors and style. The warming is really not overwhelming at all and adds a nice feel. A huge bittersweet flavor is left on the tongue for a long time after drinking this one. Drinkability is good. The taste is good, the price is decent, the alcohol and hops seem to take over this one as time goes on as I long for the balance the beer had midway through drinking it. This is one of the better barley wines I have had, but I still need to explore this style a lot, lot more.","cbutova","Nov 09, 2009"

Maltiness at first taste, but definite hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Alcohol is very noticeable - warming sensation after sipping. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonated.

A slight dark tan head fades fairly quickly into a good thick stripe all along the top of the brew. A big sweet aroma initially rises to the nose, and I like it a lot. Following that are some sour dark fruits, grain, black licorice and some sweet yeast. The taste involves a big hop bitterness with sweet and sour cherries and a good sweet breadiness mixed in between it all. Now this is what I'm talkin' about. A thin layer of chocolate is also discernible. A slightly piercing but very welcome alcohol heat exists, but that's to be expected, as this is a big one.

Overall this was good but not outstanding, reminding me somewhat of a fresh Bigfoot. It smelled better than it tasted, and the flavor could have been a bit cleaner too.

4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I have had this beer cellared for over 4 years now and decided that New Years Eve 2008/2009 would be just as good of time as any. I picked this up in Park City over labor day in 2004. This poured a very deep, burnished ruby color with 1 finger head that turned to a whispy film. The aroma on this is quite complex and deep on this well-aged barleywine. Massive toffee and butterscotch notes mesh with a dose of spices and grassy floral hops. A slight trace of diacytel is found, but with a twist-off bottle, it is to be expected after this long. The deep aromas are almost port-like in nature. The taste is fully layered with huge maltiness and subdued hop bitterness. The body is full, yet thinned by the carbonation. The balance has definitely improved since I first sampled this in 04 but still seems as though it would cellar well for many more years. I was glad to bring this out on such an occasion, but sad to see gone. A lot has happened in the times since I first purchased this in a basement alley liquor store in Park City.

Dominant aromas of caramel candies, toasted malts and dark brown sugar are initially noted. Although described on the label as a malty barleywine a substantial amount of citrusy and piney hop aromas make their way through in the background. Some faint distracting and somewhat unwanted aromatic medicinal and oxidation notes are noted also. For such a young bottle this is quite unusual. Palate is slick, full and oily with a very fine carbonation level. Great mouthfeel for a high ABV beer. Flavors start out on the malty side with assertive notes of burnt caramel candies, toasted malts, brown sugar, dark dried fruits and a touch of sherry. A nice balance of moderately bitter pine and grapefruit rind hop flavors slide in at the finish to cut through the sweetness. Overall a pleasant, full bodied warm sipper; perfect for a chilly winter night. At $9.99 per sixer a great value also.","macster","Dec 23, 2008"

Big smooth malts, nicely balanced by more resinous hops on the back of the mouth. This one is drinking great right now and I would assume it will only improve with some time in the bottle.

Also noticed some dried dark fruits, a bit of wood and smoke, toffee, and some underlying cocoa powder notes. Finished smooth and dry with minimal carbonation, and plenty of body warming, spicey alcohol heat. A nice full bodied barleywine that had a bit of a syrupy feel to it, almost like a cough medicine.

3.26,-15.1,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Dark rust. Slightly oxidized, malt melded aroma with rich malt (caramel, nuts, fruit) and a bit of resin and grapefruit. Malt accented barley wine for sure with notes of red apples, plums and hops, that show a bit of spice, resin and pine. An average barley wine.","Crosling","Mar 17, 2006"
2.95,-23.2,4,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a dark brown with tinges of red and about half a finger of light brown head. The aroma is crammed full of malt. Notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, licorice, and a slighty spiciness. Nice piney hop aroma with a little alcohol too. The carbonation is a little overwhelming and it's a little hard to distinguish many of the tastes. I'm getting some chocolate and toffee and some alcohol, but that's really about it. I thought from the aroma that this was going to be really good, but it was hard for the taste to break through.","nvsblman","Jan 25, 2006"
3.36,-12.5,4,3,3.5,4,3,"Drinkability: I'm still not sure about this at its early stages, though I didn't like Old Horizontal at its early stages either. Yet, I'm a huge hop fan (as far as double IPAs and IPAs go), and I love DFH Olde School, but I wasn't a big fan of Old Crustacean. So I don't know, maybe I have to come to grips with realizing that many barley wines just aren't my thing? Not sure, but either way, this isn't an expensive beer, especially for one bottle, so I'd say it's worth a shot (despite what my review says) if you're a big fan of the style.","asabreed","Sep 21, 2005"
4.5,17.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Perhaps a bit more age may soften the intensity of the piney hops, but I think not. Otherwise it's a really well rounded, soft barleywine that's a joy to drink; and in fact, at times the contrast of the raspy hops to the rounded sweet malt is quite nice. Well done.","NeroFiddled","Jul 01, 2005"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Mostly clear black brown body, with a light tan collar. Juicy robust malt barleywine flavor nose -- ripe prunes. Light and flavorful. Lots of sawdust and fermented booze and grapes. Lots and lots of malts. Wide mouth bitterness -- hop edges all over the body, sharp and bitter. Medium impact barleywine and port aspects. Balanced yummy barleywine.","donnebaby","Jun 08, 2005"
4.08,6.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"12 ounce twist off bottle. Forget where I picked this up in VA, but the price tag was $1.99. Eleventh anniversary XI, best before 02/12/05 on bottle.","GCBrewingCo","May 24, 2005"

3.15,-18,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"I've been sitting on this for a while. We'll see what it is like now and then crack the other one I have in a while. It pours a deep ruby, almost purple color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is piney and peppery hop with a big sweetness underneath. The flavor is pretty mellow. There is a roasty quality, almost coffee-like, that moves to a piney bitter. The feel is rather thin for a barleywine, being just at moderate. Overall, this is just an average beer. Nothing really grabs me and pulls me in to it.","kmpitz2","Apr 04, 2005"
3.03,-21.1,4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"A new state. OK on color and aroma, but not much on taste. Low as a barleywine, a little too drying. Altogether doesn't work, with sweetness and medium mouthfeel but acidic, and too much alcohol in there. Maybe in a few years, but I won't look out for it. Radekfest #5","Sammy","Apr 03, 2005"
3.33,-13.3,4.5,4,3,3,3,"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" of tan head over the clear bright chestnut brew. Head is long-lasting, and the lacing is great for the style. Aroma is strongly of piney hops, with a sweet undercurrent. Taste starts with sweet malts and pine, goes grainy/gritty in the middle, and closes with a bitter, sour aftertaste. Certainly not what the appearance and nose were leading me towards. Mouthfeel and drinkability are not that great for the above taste issues. Maybe age would help this one, time will tell.","ppoitras","Apr 02, 2005"
3.08,-19.8,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Drinkable but not that great a barleywine. Needs more complexity to be a great brew. For the money Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Ale is a far better beer of this type.","Zorro","Dec 20, 2004"
3.44,-10.4,3,4,3.5,3,3,"Orangey light brown cloak is crowned by a slight off-white ring. Beautiful biscuity malt has a profuse earthy and smoky backbone to it. At the same time, the severe alcohol bite is dwarfed by obtrusive c-hops, sharply piney, orangey, grapefruity.. Palate presents also that immature hoppy profile on a leafy platter, almost harshly so and Im usually quite fond of leafy flavors. Suggestions of wood, pencil shavings (dusty finish), vegetal green hops, toffee. Medium body shelters a low carbonation. Nevertheless, just for being what it is (10% barleywine from Utah), this is an absolute must.","Rastacouere","Nov 21, 2004"
3.38,-12,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Quite dark brown in color, with a moderate, creamy light tan head that leaves a decent lace down the glass. Aroma is mostly sugary at the start, but develops a somewhat fuller malt character as the beer warms. The flavor is actually quite hoppy -- perhaps overly so -- with a strong leafy character. The brown sugar sweetness is really not enough to balance. There's just not a lot of depth to the malt character of this beer -- it's too transitory, and fails to establish any serious presence in the mouth. As a result, the overall flavor is a bit harsh, even after, I guess, about one year of aging. Not objectionable, but far from my favorite barleywine.","mzwolinski","Nov 09, 2004"
3.95,2.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel: not as full as I would like, but the carbonation is perfectly restrained.","RootedFool","Jul 10, 2004"
3.08,-19.8,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"In an ideal world, I would seriously consider popping one of these away just to see how it ages - but I live the Real World, and with the small closet in my 11th floor Apartment already full of much better beers slowly aging, I dont think that this really cuts the mustard or deserves the space to be honest. There are much better Barleywines for my money.","TheLongBeachBum","Jun 07, 2004"
3.03,-21.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"10th Anniversary barleywine, poured from a 12 oz. bottle. It pours a deep reddis-orange with a fairly thin head that disappears quickly and leaves no trace of lace. The smell is piney hops with just a bit of sweetness. The taste seems to go from from somewhat unpleasantly unbalanced to decent and back again. It finishes with a strong, astringent flavor that is only made worse by the hop bitterness. I'm having a hard time finishing this one.","mickeymac","Jun 07, 2004"
4.13,7.6,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"One of the better drinkin' BW's I've tried in a while due to its slightly lower ABV and marveluos hoppy edge. Freshly yummy; quite a good barley wine, as I said, damn, I wish I bought more.","tavernjef","Jun 01, 2004"
3.8,-1,4,4,4,4,3,"The biggest apparent difference between the draft and bottled versions is the level of oxidation and sweetness. Overall I think the draft product is superior to the bottle, but still a nicely done effort from the Mormon land.","drewbage","Apr 27, 2004"
3.77,-1.8,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"9th anniversary 2002 edition. Poured a ruddy brown with very light carbonation. Head didn't really form, just pretty much went straight to lace. Smell is grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Taste is very smooth dark malt, almost an oakiness or tannic quality to it. Fades to a sharp hop finish that is strong in grapefruit and pine notes. It certainly mellowed some from this past summer. I wish the malt character was more pronounced or had more depth or something, but this is a tasty beer - especially with some 4 year old cheddar!","jlervine","Jan 06, 2004"
2.75,-28.4,4,4,2,2.5,2.5,"Thanks to alexgash for this one. 9th Anniversary edition, bottled in 2002. I've been aging this one for awhile, time to crack it open on this fall night, watching the Twins. Deep dark red color, looks like a port or red wine. Thin tan head that leaves speckled lacing on the sides of the glass. Caramel and chocolate covered rummy raisins dominate the bouquet. Bit of hops as well. Taste is amazingly thin and the nice smells don't come through in the taste. Very few flavors and a very astringent lingering aftertaste that is unpleasant. Glad I got to try this, but a poor example of a barley wine.","chaduvel","Oct 03, 2003"
2.19,-43,2.5,3.5,1.5,3,1.5,"Pours out to a clear, deep-brown garnet color, forming a thin, dark-beige head with poor retention and lacing despite a vigorous pour. Aroma is intensely hoppy with a very piney aroma, a peculiar sand/dust aroma (maybe all that sand in Utah has worked itself into a Utah-themed brew!), and toffeeish amber malts. Taste is very acidic (like spit-up), with sticky amber malts buried/hidden somewhere in there. Mouthfeel is very cloying with a firm body and medium carbonation. Alcohol is not very noticeable in taste, but certainly is in the buzz it packs. Not very good stuff...horribly unbalanced, and an absolute embarrassment to the style.","Mitchster","Jun 24, 2003"
4.07,6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Deep ruby hue, w/ sparse yeast aggregates.  Thin, but tight off white head. Enticing mix of rich caramel, toffee notes and biscuit malt aroma with a citrusy and slightly piney hop nose from the apparent dry - hopping.  Fusels are noticeable as the hop oils dissapate.  Fairly intense bitterness hits the palette upfront, but heavily caramelized sweetness follows.  Hops do dominate, however, and nearly overwhelm the malt profile.  A bit of bready malt flavors come through as the beer warms, but other malt flavors are overshadowed by the hops. The quinessential American hop flavor is some combination of the four ""C" hops.  Finishes w/ a lingering bitterness that masks residual sweetness.  This is a fine barleywine-- I really wish I would've waited a couple more years before trying it.  The malt flavor is lurking behind the hops and just yearns to shine...  Flavorwise this is very similar to Bigfoot 2001.  This could pass as a clone.  Easily the best Utah brew I've tasted.","marc77","May 25, 2002"
