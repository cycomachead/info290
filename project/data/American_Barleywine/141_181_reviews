"This seems to have aged well. It is smooth, well-balanced, and free of any musty or other ""off"" characteristics.  Two years seems like a sweet spot on this one, though at 10.6 abv, it could probably do 2 more and still be delicious."

"Nice copper color, a little murky looking.  Aroma is a good balance of malt and citrusy hops.  Taste is initially malty and a bit sweet, a little brown sugar.  Hops kick in on the way down, with a pretty strong, but pleasant hop bitterness on the back end.  Good body for the style.  Very enjoyable beer."

"No barleywine is easy to drink, but this is among the easier of the type to sip. I'm certainly going to sleep well tonight."

"Excellent pale to crystal malt base. There's also an excellent hop counterpoint that creates balance and interest. Creamy, full body but the carbonation fits for this beer. Simply put, this is hoppy barley wine that the masses could enjoy."

"Actually, this is my favorite barleywine that I recall. Nice, balanced, even, no serious edges. As I recall, in my area, it was also less expensive for a bomber than most. I don't recall the price, sorry!"
""
""
"O - Fitting for the american barleywine category, at least this sample, though I have had some aged and it really mellows out quite nicely. This is hop forward and hot, but is still very drinkable/enjoyable. Taste was a little less complex than some other examples, but overall a well executed barleywine, I do have at least one of these every year and I will continue the trend."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent barleywine; my only complaint would be it was a bit hot in the alcohol department. This is one that would be even better after some cellar time I suspect."
""
""
""
""
"An exemplary barleywine, and I should have expected no less from Smuttynose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was happy to have the opportunity to try this, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the style. A more muted form of Bigfoot, if I had to compare it with another."
""
""
"Overall I was rather impressed this is a very smooth hoppy Barleywine and for under 7 dollars a bottle worth picking up."

"Overall: This beer will become much more user-friendly with a year or two of age on it but right now it is brash and abrasive"
"At 11+% APV depending on year (not sure about this bottle conditioned 2013) strong but alcohol is not noticable (Beer Adv review says 7%, its clearly not and is ~11% as details above say)"
""
""
""
"Overall, every barleywine I've had is unique, and this one continues the trend. It's delicious, malty, smooth, and the alcohol is hidden entirely. Awesome job, not that I'd expect anything less from Smuttynose."
"Pours out a really nice maroon in color with a great two finger white head with good retention and lot's of good lacing. Smell is really sweet with nice candy sugars, lot's of caramel hops that give you great sugar, a little bit a of dark fruits, and a little bit of toffee. Taste is really sweet as one would expect but there is also a little bitter hops that weren't present in the nose that add to the complexity. Really a nice barley wine as there is some balance with the hops that I typically don't see in this style. Mouth fell is really pretty thick that goes with the style. I really like this as there are a lot of things going on here that meld together that I don't typically see in this style. Overall a really big beer that makes me want more as this beer brings balance that you normally don't see in the style."
""
"22 oz 2013 bottle. Pours dark amber with long lasting white head. Aroma is caramel malt, cherry and herbal hops. Body is full and slightly crisp. A lot of herbal hops, caramel malt, cherry and alcohol fill the mouth. Finish is long and very dry. Great, complex brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this one certainly fulfills the ""big beer series"" name. A bit rambunctious now, this one will benefit with age. Pick one up if youre not scared of something strong."
"Great contrast of malt and hops. Well balanced in extremes, with enough flavoring hops to keep things interesting. This would probably age well."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is definitely malt and fruit forward but at the same time not in your face. Light to medium bitterness. Unlike other fresh Barleywines I have tried this one is not a pucker-up malt explosion. It feels like it has already cellared and mellowed for a year. Nicely done Smuttynose!"
""
""
""
"O: Fresh, this is a solid brew. It could use a few months to a year of age, which would mellow out the alcohol a little and really help to showcase the maltiness a bit more. Can't really beat the price point either, which is the case with all of the Smuttynose Big Beer Series"
""
""
"Overall: A very good barleywine. Will only improve with age. The Smuttynose big beer series are always so solid and come at a great price."

"D - Overall this is a great drink; probably got a bit boozier of time, so I suggest letting it sit for a year or two; great sweet and bitter hop balance"
"Overall: Mellow, alright but even though flavor is good, the rest is ordinary IMO."

"O: I love British barleywines. I'm finding a number of American barleywines that I really dig too and this is up there in my top two or three. I had looked for this in bottles for over a year and found it today. Had on tap last year. I'll have to get more when I'm back at this store. Oh, it's a happy day!"
""
""
"Great barleywine, highly recommended."
"Overall: Incredibile, very smooth with layers of complexity and a thick but not heavy body make this a brew that commands your attention and respect. I'd love to see what more age would do for this beer. Cheers!"
""
"Taste-Sweet toasted malt backed by fruity esters, hops almost entirely in the background. Slowly warming finish. Very smooth,easygoing barleywine."
""
""
""
"See above. Really nice barleywine. Maybe not quite elite of the elite, but really good. No question."
""
"O: Pretty decent sipping beer though the presence of the alcohol makes it a less than easy drinker."
"O: This beer is a good representation of the style and has a nice balance between malts and hops."
"Beer is thin and harsh, very hot, thins out on the end and has a really dry finish, leaves me wanting a glass of water after every sip, I didn't like and won't have it again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very Good. Ages like a champ!"
""
"So thankful for this beer."
"This one's going on 3.5 years and holding up very well. Plenty of hop presence and minimal oxidation."
"O-A nice barleywine but it could have used a little more hops, especially when it is listed here as an American Barleywine."
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, 2011 bottle; so it is probably about a year old now. Pours hazy reddish orange color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, apple skin, biscuit, grapefruit, pine, herbal spiciness, citrus peel, molasses, some dark fruit, and a bit of alcohol. Nice and well balanced barleywine aromas here. Taste of big caramel, orange zest, pine, biscuit, dark fruit, grapefruit, herbal spiciness, molasses, toffee, and toasted malt. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big caramel, citrus, pine, molasses, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel. At 11.6% this is most certainly a sipper, and I would expect it to be. Good balance of flavors and bitterness; with a nice malt forward profile. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with only a warming present on the finish. Overall this is a very nice and well balanced barelywine. Nice flavor profile and very enjoyable stuff."
""
""
"D-Honestly the alcohol on this one is way too noticeable and detracts form the beer even after 6+ months of aging. Not my cup of tea at all."
"Every Sunday they have a special beer on in their down stairs lounge. From Burton Baton and Paolo Santo to vintage Smuttynose beers. Check 'em out."
""
"A nice barleywine. Next bottle I get I think I'll age it though."

"Very dark right off the bat, this deeply red ale sucks in ambient light like a black hole. A strong taste on the first couple sips mellows out into a very chocolaty taste that makes you want to keep drinking. Pretty standard Barley wine that is good for an occasion. Large enough to share so invite the friends to try some. Strong so drink it early on!"

"VERY GOOD, WORTH GETTING!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: A nicely sippable and drinkable barleywine, and my overall impression is that this is a good workmanlike barleywine that is worth sampling at least once. However, that said, I won’t go out of my way to have it again. While I certainly would not recommend avoiding this beer there are other American style barleywines that come in 12 oz bottles that I’ll choose in preference."
"Mouthfeel is thick. Its a good beer but its missing some complexity. I think some time will turn this into something special."
"Overall, this comes off to me as a miss. The maltiness is really lacking, and the taste ends up being more like a middle of the road double IPA instead of a barley wine. Not a bad beer, but not a real good one either."
"Mouthfeel is on the thinner side of medium, a little more attenuated and less sticky then most barleywines around."
"O: An interesting barleywine. Good pairing with a cheese plate and toasted pumpkin seeds."
"Pours a murky brown color with a 1 inch light tan head that settles to a thin film. Random small spots and streaks of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Lots of sediments floating around in this one. Smell is of biscuit-like malt and some citrus zest. Kind of a weak smell overall on this one. Taste is better with some malt, brown sugar, and citrus zest hops on the finish. Mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a somewhat thick and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good barleywine but nothing too amazing going on."
"Poured into 13oz tulip. Bottle around 8 months old. Pours a nice orange -red. Lovely sticky white head, around a a inch & half. Lacing hangs the whole beer. Smell is hard candy, citrus hops, and bready malt. Taste all those things, stronger with grassy flavor & some booze. Mouthfeel is on the big side, but not over the top. I love this beer right now, this is the best it has tasted to me ever. Great value also."
"Very delicious beer, perfect as an after dinner drink."
"O-Love this beer. Great stuff from Smuttynose. Complex and pretty drinkable for a Barleywine."
"Love this ale and my only regret is that I didn't try it sooner."
"o - Overall this is a decent beer, but needs some time. I feel like this one could age very well, as my only real complaint was the heat and alcohol in the taste. Would like to get a bottle and sit on it for a year or two and see what happens. I preferred the wheatwine, though to be fair it had an extra year of aging on it."
"Deep amber orange pour with a thin line of foam. Aroma is very sweet and caramely with an intense fruity character as well. There is a bit of cherry and sweet citrusy hops with the malts. Alcohol Warming seems to intensify the fruit, and sweetness. The flavor is nice, but not as well balanced as the aroma might suggest. A little ""thin"" for a Barleywine, but it tastes good. I wonder what a little age would do for this one?"
"Overall I thought this beer was a bit too sweet and lacked the complexity to be in the upper tier of barleywines, but it’s another solid beer from the Big Beer series. Worth a shot."
"O: A summer treat indeed, this strong American barleywine was great on its own and would pair nicely with a variety of nutty and funky cheeses, I'm sure. A raspberry or chocolate dessert might pair well also and take some of the edge out of that 10% ABV with some natural sweetness."
"Exceptional. The best barleywine I've ever had!"
"Well worth trying, and good."
"O - Smuttynose could get away with labeling this overly-hopped Barleywine a Double IPA and no one would be the wise. I like it, but it's definitely a little hoppier than I like my barleywines. More malt isn't necessary though, it just needs to be cut back on hops. It'll take a while to drink this one. Thankfully it should remain ok as it warms up."
"A cloudy red/orange color with only a small amount of head that leaves quickly. Big, lightly roasted, malty nose with a tropical citrus aroma. The alcohol content is present but balanced with the large malt and hop character. The taste is a big spice bread malt with a huge hop flavor. A spicy mild citrus and orange finish. The finish is bitter but smoothed out by a bite of alcohol."
"At $5.99 a bottle this stuff is excellent value. This is how I like a barleywine. Decent balance, with only a moderate hoppy bitterness to the finish. It allows both the malt and hops have their time to shine. I'll be buying this again, I'm sure."
"Overall, I don't care for this beer fresh, but 7yrs. in the cellar have made this a totally different beer."
"overall, solid example of the style, and easier to drink than I expected."
"Overall: This, at 4 years old, is a very pleasant, easy drinking barleywine. This sits in the range of very good but not great BWs though I personally prefer a BW with some residual hop profile."
"D: This had a very nice bright scent and taste, similar to Old Ruffian. Body was a bit weak, and alcohol was definitely noticeable, so it needed to be sipped. Some age would really help mellow and improve this, as long as it doesn't thin too much more in the cellar. Very nice drink."
"O: In terms of drinkability, this beer ranks high. Overall, it is equally impressive. Worth seeking out or trading for. I need to cellar some of this to see how it ages. This is a another Smutty triumph."
"D - Fairly drinkable. It is a big beer and it shows with a lot of strong flavor. Good thing is this flavor is well balanced and really solid. The booze shows through a bit, but not in a bad way at all."
"overall: I like this one -- more of an English than American-style, but perhaps that's just because more and more American-style barleywines are cranking up the hop presence. this one is nicely balanced and would only benefit from more time in the cellar -- perhaps another year."
"Pretty standard barleywine; decent enough, but the sweetness is really tough to get past. I think it's damaged the roof of my mouth. Not as good as some of the fine Smuttynose brews I've had in the past, but decent enough."
"Notes: Nice barleywine, reminds me of the common ground it shares with their wheatwine, and while different brews, it makes me long for that one. The wheatwine was also rather assertive but the sweeter edge of the wheat made it more drinkable upfront, and I´m missing that a bit here."
"O=One of the better Barleywines I have tried, I will definitely have this again."
"Pours a hazy reddish orange with half inch of cream colored head, settles to a thin ring, couple blobs of lace left behind. Smell: a big hit of apple skin and caramel, citrus peel, really fruity though nothing particularly pops out...a little cherry-esque among others. Taste: dark brown sugar, sugary dates, lemon peel, notes of cherry and red apple. There's a sugared fruit sweetness, balancing bitterness, and a major hit of booze. This is pretty nice, but a bomber is asking a bit much given the upfront alcohol. This one benefits from the new rating system, as, overall, it's quite good, but, the drinkability takes a nosedive about halfway through the bomber. Jan 2011 bottling, definitely worth cellaring."
"O- This beer really is different for the style. I expected this malty beast and it didn't happen. Citrus overtones and a nice underlying malt presence made this a very enjoyable beer. The ABV was not present at all for most of the beer. This beer is fantastic fresh which I don't say for many barleywines."
"D: While the flavor and texture are quite nice, the heat in this is just too strong for just 10%. I normally have no trouble getting through a high gravity bomber, but completely sober, I'm having a lot of trouble getting just half way through this."
"medium bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. decent drinkability."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side, with carbonation moderate for the style. Drinkability was pretty good, it was a nice barleywine to sip on this evening. It had some big flavors, but managed to integrate them together pretty well. A very nice beer overall."
"At 10% abv it is almost as drinkable as can be, and is some serious motivation for me to find a job so I can age some of these."
"At this early stage it pairs exceptionally well with a very strong well aged cheddar. I had it with a 2 year old Vermont Grafton cheddar, which brought out both depth in the malt as well as some of the sharper bitterness."
"Still a bit young and I think once the awkward hop presence fades it might come into it's own, as it is now though, it's a very interesting Barleywine."
"Picked up at Bert's in Hooksett, NH, grabbed a few bottles so some can be aged as well. Poured a very light red/orange hue. Head formed nicely and stuck around for the party. The aroma was a very light citrus smell. The taste was a interesting as I felt it was nicely balanced for a young barleywine. Sweet citrus and malt molded together to form a nice crisp flavor. It was a very inviting brew and I was happy to to finish the bottle. The carbonation was of medium along with the body. The brew was nice to SIP on but was a bit to fresh for me to grab another. I am excited to see how this beer turns out in two years."
"D: This is a hell of a chore to drink. It has a great ""ripe and sweet dark fruit"" taste but the thickness and alcohol make this difficult to finish."
"Mouthfeel is hearty and a bit warming for this nice winter evening. Overall, Smuttynose has another quality product with this barleywine. While it's not as hoppy as some American Barleywines (Bigfoot), it's well balanced character make it quite enjoyable."
"Smuttynose Barleywine Style Ale has a lovely orange colour and an excellent 1 cm head that fades to 1 mm of lacing. The smell is of hops and citrus with some breadiness... very nice. Spells like a double IPA. The taste is initially like hops and citruss which then moves to bitterness and breadiness. The aftertaste is still citrussy, but the alcohol becomes slightly noticeable. This is a really nice beer, but it tastes like a double IPA and not like a barleywine. Did they mislabel the bottle. I like double IPAs, so I'm not complaining."
"Sweeter than I would have thought, but overall balanced and easy to drink."
"A beautiful deviation from a classic barleywine."
"Poured a burnt orange in color with pale brown highlights that had a thin head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was pretty hoppy alongside, citrus, caramel, brown sugar, and sweetness I'm assuming are from the malts. The taste was dominated by the caramel brown sugar sweetness but did have a good hoppy bitter punch and had citrusy accents. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a citrusy, sweet, hoppy, sugary, bitter finish. It drank decent but was a bit too hoppy and bitter for the type of barleywines I like."
"D: Sort of middle of the road for a barleywine. Not really bitter, not really sweet. And what is there is not really anything that great or interesting."
"I'm a big fan."
"Surprised to find a bottle still on the shelf after a year, but this was a great find. I have heard this is very hoppy when fresh, but I liked the heavy malt tones when aged."
"This was a decent barleywine, the flavor was good and strong but I thought it was a bit lighter than most other barleywine."
"22oz bomber. Pours a really hazy light brown color with a thin head. Moderate amount of lacing. Aromas of some fruits, a surprising amount of hops, and a kind of sweet boozey smell. Taste has a good amount of hop flavor to it. Slightly bready with a nice mix of alcoholic sweetness. Some malt flavor but picking up on more hops than malt. This is a really nice barleywine. Good kick of hops to it as well as the usual barleywine characteristics. The boozey taste is nicely balanced and not an overload. I will be looking for this one again."
"Medium-bodied and rather resinous on the palate - definitely American-style, this one - with medium-high carbonation for the style. A solid barleywine overall. Not a standout, but on the higher end for the style."
"Overall, I am really enjoying this barleywine. Consuming after I laid it down for several months, wonder how it would taste after a year or so. Only one way to find out... Either way it drinks much lighter than the ABV and is probably delicious fresh or aged."
"Speaking of which, a strong bitter taste finishes the tasting experience. The beer is full, sticky and thick with some notable alcohol lingering upon swallowing. The carbonation is a touch heavy, but overall this beer is above average in drinkability. This isn't my favorite American Barleywine and lacks the hop flavor, unique maltiness, and masked alcohol of the best of the style like Gratitude. And, unfortunately, I don't think it has enough character to be anyone else's favorite. But for a readily available and somewhat affordable American Barleywine, this is certainly a beer to try if you like your beers big and strong."
"D: A little too sweet for me, but delicious if you like your beer to taste like banana (or lemon) bread."
"D- The sharp alcohol presence takes the drinkability considerably down. I like how balanced this beer is, but the alcohol is a little to dominating. I would love to taste this beer with the alcohol masked better or just reduced."
"Future outlook: Really excellent. Repeat business eminent..and I want to snag one of these to send off to the cellar."
"D- very little sign of the abv in this brew. I really dig the overall fruit character from the combination for malts and hops."
"Picked this up on a recent trip to Wiscoland. Very tasty barleywine, nice balance between caramel and the citrus. It was a big beer but easy to drink, maybe I should mix in a few more barleywines over the summer since this one really hit the spot!"
"Larry (the character) once said that he didn't have to dress well because he was married. You can't dress up a big thick beer in a nice bottle and call it a barleywine. Fortunately, Smuttynose has crafted a nice hop monster with a lot of depth - suitable for a nice dinner with Cheryl and the Greenes."
"D- If you like really hoppy bwines, this is for you. I prefer mine a little less carbonated and with a bigger malt presence. Still a good offering from Smuttynose."
"2009 Vintage on tap: pours a deep amber color with a thin off-white head, that retains OK. The aroma is still very hoppy with piney and citrusy notes upfront, along with caramel and brown sugar, dark fruits, biscuit and a decent amount of alcohol. The flavor is nicely structured, with piney and citrusy hops upfront, along with plum and fig, some caramel and brown sugar, and a healthy dose of alcohol. The mouthfeel was thick and a tad syrupy, and drinkability was pretty good despite the ABV. Overall a pretty solid barleywine, a tad hoppy to drink much of but still a tasty experience."
"Overall, this drinks more like a DIPA at the moment but I still enjoyed it of course."
"This is a very drinkable, highly complex barleywine and I'm spoiled to be able to pick this up at the store whenever I want. Excellent barleywine."
"D) A nice barleywine the malt complexities mellows after a few swigs. Only critique: the label. The old time peasant farmer is a lIttle creepy."
"A really nice barleywine, very well structured, love it now, would probably love it with age."
"Overall a solid example of the barleywine. Somewhat of a split of the american and english styles. Would be interesting to see if a few years age would take some of the heat of this."
"D: One of the most dynamic and drinkable American Barleywines you're apt to find."
"A beautiful apricot-rose color on this one with thinnish white head. Smell is delicious with some leafy hops on top of big fruity and citrus hops. Some caramel too. Taste is like a watered down Gratitude, some candi sugar, big citrus and leafy hops, a bit of caramel malt, a bit boozy. I'm really happy with this, it's exactly what I'm interested in tonight. MF is medium to full, coating. Good for what I want. Drinkability is great considering the deliciousness, but a little hindered by the booziness. Tremendous value beer at $6 a bomber, big hops in this one, not at like Ruination level, but definitely multi-dimensional."
"D- Overall, I am really enjoying this barleywine. This is a fresh bottle and it is already drinking nicely. I would imagine that age would just enhance the flavors and cut down on some of the warmth from the alcohol a bit. Definitely worth a try! Recommended!"
"d: This was a little on the young and hot side. It has potential to get better so I might buy one to age. I'm just not a fan of big beers in big bottles so I'm not sure I will."
"Seemingly a bit more like a English style Barleywine then the American style; it's a fairly solid, and most definately warm/alcohol laced orangified treat to take in. Would like more caramel thickness balanced in along with a deeper body and complexity."
"Not bad. You can drink it fresh and aging it might only expose more of the mellow flavors underneath. Recommended."
"A solid version of the American version."
"Thick murky golden brew. Dense rocky head builds slowly to 1", then fades even slower to a thick carpet and tons of lace. Aroma is massive. Mainly spruce, lemon rind, caramel, and shortcake, with tons of nuances, some fruit/ berries, some florals. Taste is much fruiter and less sweet than I expected. Big strawberry note up front, then hops and big malts take over. Spruce and lemon linger long in the finish, accompanied by a bit of alcohol burn. I'm still tasting it a few minutes later. This is a full, heavy bodied brew, a meal in itself. Mouthfeel is thick but dry, a little resiny. Lemon rind in the finish seems to emphasize the alcohol burn, which is unfortunate. Maybe a bit more sweetness, like half way to Gravitation (raisin paste), would help. Although it has its flaws and is a little rough in some areas, overall it is another solid offering from Smutty's Big Beer series."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange amber color with a big fluffy white head that recedes quickly but never really disappears. Smells of sweet fruit and citrus hops. Slight touch of alcohol and oranges and apricots come to mind. Taste is hop bitterness right away but almost instantly gives way to some sweetness. Fruits and light brown sugar and caramel lots of hints of citrus mid way through finishing with a long lingering orange apricot and bitter hop finish. Full bodied, sweet sticky almost syrupy mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation. I enjoy this beer every year, its a touch on the sweet side, but I enjoy the hell out of it."
"D: An easy one to drink for the style and ABV. Quite complex so invites the next sip. If you like SN Bigfoot you will find this equally enjoyable. A much better American Barleywine then the B+ rating would indicate."
"D: A great American barleywine, and yet another top-notch beer with Smuttynose. One of my top couple of breweries, especially at the price point."
"The beer is well carbonated, full bodied and very crisp. The juicy hops and sweet malts balance nicely and mask the high abv very well. The beer finishes nice and dry, without ever being too bitter or too sweet. This is very drinkable."
"Not a mindblower, but remarkably balanced despite a wild hop/sweet mutation. This is interesting, and reminded me of Bearded Pat's barleywine by Bluegrass Brewing Co. (Kentucky). That too needed aging, and I think next time I see this I'll do my best to let it sit in the cellar a year or two. (This was from the 2009 bottling.)"
"Drinkability is good, a nice barleywine that has aged well and is a good representation of the style. Nothing particularly distinct about it, but well done."
"F: Semi sweet, malty, long bitter spicy and chewy hops, some pine, a little orange peel lingering, and hot, a little too boozy overall."
"Decent on drinkability. The sweetness and alcohol make the bottle a little bit difficult to finish."
"D: Pretty drinkable but high alcohol content for sure. I think this is going to be a malty beast with 3-4 years on it."
"Overall, I dug this, but not the best of style I've had. Very close, but just a touch flawed. Still. worth trying."
"I don't normally like Barleywines, but they are growing on me and this one helps. I enjoyed every sip of this beer, especially for $6.49 a bomber. I will visit this one again and I am impressed, again, with Smuttynose."
"At $4-$5/bomber, this beer is a great value, comparable to Lagunitas Olde Gnarlywine. There's a lot of flavorful hop influence and great tropical fruit notes. Sugary, but doesn't go too far. One of the better Smuttynose beers I've had."
"Note: If one finds this one to be too much, try it with some white cheddar cheese-its or just some sharp cheddar...it takes the edge off of the bitterness and makes it easier to drink"
"Not a spectacular example of the style, but well made and highly drinkable none the less."
"Drinkability: This is a really solid and affordable barleywine. Decent aroma and flavor complexity and big mouthfeel. I really like it."
"Smuttynose Barleywine is a hazy, copper ale with big, foamy, off white head that has outstanding retention and lacing. As soon as I popped the top, I smelled something warm, sweet and bready. Dipping my nose in the glass, there's a strong aroma of hops: grassy, spicy and fruity with a note of orange peel. It's pretty full bodied, very smooth and slick with a very quick, dry finish. It tastes a little sweet at first; then it gets resiny and finally quite bitter. There are flavor notes of wood, spice and orange peel. It's solidly American and really pretty complex. It kept my attention."
"Had on-tap at Track 84. Half pour served in a stange. Color was a hazy burnt orange/caramel with a quarter inch loose, off-white head that dissipates into a swirl of foam. Lots of citrus off the nose - oranges, sugar and some aromatic hops come out as the brew warms up a little. Taste is interesting - candied citrus with some light hops bittering coming out at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light and evenly carbonated. An easy drinking beer with a well-hidden abv (too well-hidden - glad I went for the half pour). I have to say though that I prefer the body and malty complexity of English Barleywines over their American counterparts. However, this is a solid brew and well worth trying. Smuttynose has become my go to brewery for quality brews at a very reasonable price."
"D - While this is good fresh, will it be better aged perhaps. Given the strong ABV and the bitterness I find the drinkability to me above average for know. I will make sure to revisit though."
"Good brew overall, some characteristics outside of what one may expect of an American Barleywine, but quite tasty."
"All in all, this is a decent brew. I'd definitely recommend this for people who enjoy American Barleywines. It has hops upfront with a slight sweetness hidden in the mix."
"Overall one of my favorite beers, especially for the price. Incredible barleywine. And at less than $5/bottle, I will be buying plenty of this while I can."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I'll be buying a few bottles later this week."
"M + D: Rather medium bodied, with a fair bit of alcohol warmth on the throat, in addition to a little prickle of carbonation right on the very finish that adds an interesting touch that I find myself enjoying. A big brew, but one that is very inviting to drink. Hopefully, I'll have the opportunity to treat myself to another bomber, at least!"
"Very enjoyable, but buckle your seatbelt."
"This was by far the finest barley wine I have ever had. The complexity of the malts paired with the subtlety of the orange/citrus notes was amazing."
"Pours brownish-amber with a small off-white head. The aroma is very sweet with some strong caramel malt. The flavor is lots of caramel as well as hops, chocolate, sweet malt as well as some dark fruit and brown sugar. The alcohol does come through in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel."
"Sampled at the O-Town throwdown. Murky light brown color with tiny off white head. Nice sweet and dark fruit barleywine aroma. The flavor hits first with smooth dates, plums and caramelized malts. As the taste finishes the brew provides a warming sensation. High level of Yummy-ness."
"This is an excellent barleywine. Complex yet nicely balanced. Great mouthfeel. A bit boozy but still wonderful."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my basic snifter glass. The ale appears a hazed deep copper color with about two fingers of fluffy tan foam. Nose and flavor are fruity, honeyed citrus (oranges), lots of caramelized malt, dark cherries, figs, medium toasted grain, some alcohol coming through. Medium in both body and carbonation. Went nicely with an assorted cheese plate."
"The first time I reviewed this I wished I could be more insightful and descriptive; I had been enjoying the beer so much I could hardly bring myself to write anything down in my notes. Come the empty glass I had a full sheet of paper with nothing written on it except the word 'spectacular'. This certainly ranks among the top of both Smuttynose 'Big Beer Series' releases as well as American Barleywines."
"D: Definitely a sipper. Next time I'll (1) drink it fresh and (2) split the bomber with a friend."
"I will be aging multiple bottles when I can get my hands on them. This is the best Barleywine I have yet to try."
"This actually is pretty good if you like a barleywine, but it seems like they didn't even try to mask the ABV."
"Quite tasty, would get this again."
"Pours a cloudy copper topped by medium beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, piney, some biscuit, toffee and light caramel. Flavor has a nice strong malt backbone, caramel, dark fruit and grapefruit. Finishes long and sweet with a slight alcohol burn.. Full bodied, resiny texture."
"drinkability: just fine"
"The beer pours hazy orange with a low head and low carbonation. The aroma is vanilla and alcohol, with some minor hops, possibly noble. The flavor is malty with some bitterness and then a sugary sweetness. The finish is wet with alcohol and some spiciness. The mouth feel is heavy without being syrupy. Overall the beer is good but has too much alcohol taste. I would not choose to have this beer again, but appreciate the craftsmanship and quality in its creation."
"Maybe this beer needs more age (probably so), but I did not enjoy this at all. I struggled to finish it and I feel this may need 3-5 years of age on it to round out. Still I'm glad I tried it, but I won't go back to it. I'll stick with Bigfoot, Old Guard and Old Ho and Old Ruff."
"over all: awesome barley wine. It was enjoyable when fresh and becoming better with age. again, very balanced."
"Overall - this was a decent beer, albeit a tad unbalanced. Thanks to my buddy for getting my this for my birthday."
"Smuttynose did a pretty nice job with this Barleywine. It's in line for the style. As a personal preference, I'd like a little more hop action. It just seems to be a little to tame for my taste. Nonetheless, it's a good beer that's certainly worthy of a try."
"A very nice beer from Smuttynose. The aging has really worked wonders for this beer."
"Overall this was really an excellent barley wine. Very understated and under the radar. I would really enjoy trying this one again, especially fresh. Seems like a real winner."
"D - For the style, deceptive in drinkability."
"A definite sipper for the cool fall weather, excellent drinker while watching college football"
"drinkability? well, it's delicious though three of these in one sitting would probably prove unmemorable, so i have to dock points for that, i suppose"
"I would recommend this beer. I bought this bottle at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"Pours a murky brownish/red, the color of iced tea, really. Smallish tan head fades into a thin ring around the glass, some nice patches of sticky lacing in the glass. Lots of citrus in the nose, definitely a big alcohol presence, and some big-time rich caramel. Huge caramel malt taste, really bitter citrus notes, spicy alcohol. Sticky mouthfeel, smooth, finely carbonated. This is tasty, but that ABV sneaks right up on you. For sharing and sipping, and definitely worth seeking out."
"Wow, drink a 22oz of this stuff and you'll be feeling alright. While a very good tasting beer you will definitely notice the alcohol content. Pours a brown-reddish color with a small off-white head but a nice amount of lace. Aroma is quite hoppy and fruity. Strong hops, sweet candy malts and slightly fruity. I'd definitely get this again, nice strong flavors."
"Poured a nice thick creamy colored head that faded rather quickly. Lacing stuck around for the entire glass. Strong malt aroma with some fruity hop like smell. Alcohol was definitely noticeable. Tasted just as it smelled with a dry hop finish with an alcohol kick. An enjoyable barley wine."
"pours a nice golden amber with an off white head that fades to lacing that seems determined to stick around indefinitely. the rich aroma emanating from the frothy head speaks of malt malt... and maybe some alcohol, who knows. but more over it has some ester sort of quality that is really nice. the taste follows suit but with a nice hoppy dry finish. with the full body and the adequate carbonation this creates a really nice barleywine."
"Looks thich hasey orange with a dull brown hugh. Nice two fingered ivory head thick and sticky leaving decent lacing and receiding slowly to thick but small frothy covering. Strong smells of sweet carmelled malts as well as toasted bready malts, also displayed a grassy and slightly citrusy hop bill in the nose with understated widely rangng fruit tones and some alcohol warmth in the end. Big chewey well rounded and ranged malt flavor with some sweet sugar plum and other fruity hits, has a nice grassy hop bitterness to finish off with a hint of citrus hop flavor here and there. Very nice but not to pronounced alcohol warmth and tingle throughout. Very nice thick coating mouth feel and although it took alot of sips Ieasily finished the 22oz bottle while bascing in the sun and slight breeze on my porch."
"D - The ABV is hidden extremely well and surprises at the end. Sip this beer for sure. I can sip this all night long - a great brew from Smutty"
"Taste is very much like the smell but very boozy in the nose and back of the throat. This doesn't hide the alcohol well at all but that's not a problem for me. Feels smooth and rich and is an exceptional drinker. Gotta get more of this one to age for a few years."
"Barleywine is a style I have not been able to ""get into"" but I am starting to develop a taste for them and this is one I wouldn't mind drinking again. Quite tasty I would say."
"I think the drinkability was hampered by the overall alcohol and hot feelings when drinking it. I think this one could age nicely and might be better in a year or two. I have another, perhaps i will sit on it for 18-24 months and revisit it then."
"Amber brown color with a thin white head that quickly fades. Hoppy nose. Rich hoppy flavor, nicely balanced with sweet malt. Nice presence of alcohol provides a warming, toasty feeling on the tongue. Highly drinkable for such a potent brew; nice for a nightcap on a chilly night."
"The first thing that hit me with the smell of this monster was Pecan pie - Nice toasted pecans with nice caramel maltyness. Taste follows through with nuttiness, also provides some bitter and sweet notes. Somewhat hot on back of palate, but a nice drink."
"22oz 2007 bottle courtesy of UncleJedi, thank you very much! I always like to put my nose to the bottle immediately after opening and this one gave me a blast of hops that made em smile and transitioned into orange and toffee. The smells from my snifter are more citrus and toffee but not too hoppy. There are also a slight bit of alcohol fumes. The color is a nice red-orange and looks like an Ameican style barleywine to me. The taste is very nice, hoppy, chewy, bitterness that is nice! The second sip makes me think of bubblegum. This is a nice barleywine and almost seems West Coast like Bigfoot. Smuttynose is a brewery I don't hear a lot about but all of their beers have been very good."
"I'm a big fan of Smuttynose, but not of Barleywine's so I'd suggest their Old Brown Dog over this one."
"Pours a dark amber color. Sudsy whitish head that doesn't last too long. Smell is fruity and vegetal to me. Not particularly appealing but not bad. Taste is caramel with hops in balance but with a definite alcohol presence noticeable. Slightly thin, and flavor was too alcohol driven for it to be very enjoyable."
"D - a sipper fo' sure"
"D:Good. This is a very nice approachable American Barleywine. The hops are there but not over powering. Very good starting point for someone who wants to get in to them."
" Overall a good beer but definitly not the best American Barleywine I have ever had. One very important fact I failed to state was that the beer was pretty young. I don't know how long it was on the shelf in the store but I had it for about 2 months. Very interested in a cellared bottle at least one year."
"Nose of pine, citrus, cantalope, and alcohol. Initial hit of hops, citrus, and carbonation, that quickly opens into creamy caramel and grapefruit. The alcohol in this beer adds to a big mouth feel but slightly overpowers the other flavors. Nonetheless, one of the better barleywines I've had."
"D: This could use some aging to round out the alcohol dominating the malt flavors. It is not bad just young. I will finish the rest of the bomber."
"A nice, fruity barleywine to sip on."
"D- Like I said above, thios one is smooth. The burn from the alcohol is well hidden beneath layers of complex flavors and a pleasant hop bite that makes me crave the next sip after taking the first."
"Recommended..."
"Thanks, barleywinebrewer!!!!"
"I recommend this. Smuttynose wins again!"
"Like it lots."
"The aroma has a fruity quality that I didn't expect. That fruitiness is in the taste. Balanced well. This is a Winter 2007 bottle. So - it is still a bit young and maybe a little on the boozy side. Still makes a fine sipper. Pretty smooth. Good mouthfeel with just a little stickiness. This is a quality barley wine that is going to age beautifully."
"D: Very nice barleywine. Very satisfied!!!"
"This is one of the best Barleywines I've ever tasted. If you have a chance to get it, it's a must buy. If I'm ever up in DC again, or any other place that carries this, I'll be sure to pick up more than one bottle."
"This is certainly a big beer. At 10% ABV, you're not likely to forget that. This is a relatively young beer that I have here (less than a year old) and it probably could have sat on the shelf for another year or two and been just as nice. As it is right now, it's hot and green and really really ripe. I'm tempted to run back to the store and grab another and let it sit for a while. But yes, it's a fine brew."
"Great barley wine."
"Pours a very hazy dark amber color with a decent, off white head. Smell is extremely fruity, citrusy hops, grapefruit, a hint of alcohol. Taste is more ripe fruits, figs, raisins, definite hop presence in the finish which does a decent job of hiding the alcohol with a pungent grapefruit and pine flavor. The burn in the belly, however, remains giving off a nice warming sensation. Mouthfeel is velvety, semi-rich, modest carbonation, and dry, hoppy finish. One bomber is definitely enough. Very enjoyable."
"I find this Barleywine to be vey enjoyable. It's nothing over the top, or anything to be hyped about, but I find myself taking sip after sip and looking forward to the next one. It's complex and well balanced. Just be sure to watch out, the alochol by volume is high, but well hidden. Recommended."
"Glad I tried it, but I won't look hard to find my next bottle."
"Big fan of this one. It has some really unique things going on that make it a must try. I paired this with some extra sharp cheddar towards the end of this experience."
"Poured into my Spaten mug the brown leather color is wonderful when held up to the sunlight with the Manic Street Preachers on the Hi-Fi . The head did not last long but there is tons of lacing on the glass . The smell is very piney and full of hops . This is a great tasting barleywine . Granted I am still an apprentice but this is a pleasure to drink . There is a peppery kick on the finish . Tough call between this stuff and the Old Ruffian I had a few weeks back . Mouthfeel is smooth and at 10 ABV drinkability may limit you to 2 bottles . As usual Smuttynose makes another great brew . I will this spring , make another trip to the brewery . Keep up the good work lads ."
"D- I would not quite put this in the above-average tier, it is smooth and easy-drinking despite the alcohol presence, I enjoyed it but was perplexed at the mild aromas"
"I am still in love with HOG HEAVEN fron avery, but I will still give this girl a kiss anytime."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily for a 10.00% ABV beer, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style. Just like the rest of the Big Beer Series that I’ve had, this is an excellent big beer."
"2007 vintage... hazy reddish coppery with a great light tan head that stuck well and really left some nice lace. nose was dominated by sour, tangy citrus rind. grapefruit on top. a hint of mostly caramel malt poked through the nice hop scent as well. the dominating citrus character also came to play on the palate, but to my surprise, it didn't take over everything. the malt was more prevalent in the taste, and between the caramel and faint roasty taste, the hops gave this beer a true flavor of it's own. i've had many beers that i would consider having a grapefruit or citrus rind taste to them, but this one was really, really rind (almost dried rind) strong on the taste buds. thankfully the nice malts smoothed it out enough for it to really express itself pleasantly to me. medium full body with a somewhat syrupy and velvety mouthfeel. the finish was not too boozy or dry. i prefer hog heaven or bigfoot, but american barleywine fans should consider this one for sure."
"This is a really good beer, in my opinion. If you like Great Divide's Old Ruffian, you'll like this one. Alcohol is present, I can feel it already and I'm barely anyways into this one at all. A superb example of the American Barleywine style."
"Pours a very dark amber, almost mahogany in color with about a finger of light tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Aroma is fairly hoppy, citrus, floral, and piney hops are present, with a solid malt backbone, some caramel notes, and a fair amount of alcohol. Taste is pretty darn good. This is malty and sweet yet still balanced by substantial but not overwhelming hop bitterness and flavor. This seemed to get just a bit too boozy at times. Mouthfeel is good, this is medium-full bodied but not terribly filling with low-moderate carbonation. Overall this is pretty good, I thought that this was vibrant and lively fresh but might benefit from some aging to smooth things out. Bottom Line: give this a try."
"This is a very good, very ""American"" barleywine. Its strength and hop-forward nature surprised me a bit, I must say. Perhaps it was the art on the bottle, but I was expecting a mellower, more English-style barleywine. Instead a got an aggressive ass-kicker with an overall character that reminded me a bit of Dogfish 120 (minus the insanely high alcohol). I won't recommend this beer to people who don't like hoppy barleywines (maybe you can age some to mellow it out), but to those who do, I certainly will."
"At the Sunset Grill and Tap in Boston today, I had a snifter of the Barleywine. It was a big disappointment. The hot alcohol taste dominated everything and made it very nearly undrinkable. I'm not sure what the difference with the bottled version might be but apparently, something went wrong with this keg. Nice bitterness, good color and lacing and lots of malt flavor and aroma. But the burning alcohol dominated everything else. Also had a bit of metallic-chemical aftertaste."
"5/15/2010 - Bottle from 2007. This beer has aged magnificently! The bitterness is still there but rounded, the citrus is gone and replaced by earthy, herbal hop flavor. Sweet caramel dark fruit is the dominant flavor, with hints of chocolate and toffee. The carbonation is very light and there is some oxidation present, but it really mellows the alcohol, which is hardly noticeable. This is a beer that does incredibly well with age, my review has changed considerably!"
"Still, price to quality ratio is quite high. I'll buy another, throw it downstairs, and crack it next December next to the 2008 release. Until then..."
"Drinkability: A good barleywine and another fine offering from Smuttynose."
"Poured into a chalice a cloudy mahgoney color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy tannish head, some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, sweet, hoppy, and tons of caramel. The taste is big on malts/hops, a nice sweetness thrown in, woodsy, and a big dose of caramel. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Medium body, a well rounded brew. Drinkable, another awesome brew from Smutty."
"Pairs well with a chocolate/fruity dessert or may be enjoyed alone on a cold day."
"Slick and oily in the mouth, with an above average drinkability for a beer this size. The balance and intermingling between bitter and sweet is really well represented here resulting in a top notch barleywine."
"Good body, but this really seems to be lacking something. Rather disappointing."
"Well this beer is lacking a mid-palate. Candy sugar laced with honey at first sip and then the mid is basically alcohol. Malt is lacking especially for a barley wine. Mainly hop driven with a bitter finish. Citrusy and lacking the stone fruit of the nose. Thin and lacking body, depth, backbone, and complexity. Very dissapointing and not something I'll drink much."
"Drinkable and the barley taste is there, it's a typical American barleywine, hopped up on C hop, with citrus taste, a barley dominated substantial aroma. Peachy colour with small and significant head.A bit of bourbon corn sourness from the Jack Daniels barreling of one year. Still, I am glad I cellared it for a year."
"2006 bottling, poured into an AleSmith tulip. Looks thick and syrupy on the pour, which yields a deeply murky, dullish amber beer that glows with a ""sunburst"" effect when backlit. Thin but dense and creamy ecru foam cap. Attractive sheets of clumpy, webby lacing. Blunted hop aromas overtaken by a caramelly sweet character and a dry, ruggedly bitter scent. Smells somewhat oxidized, but nothing unpleasant or inappropriate -- merely a function of having been aged for a year or more. Mellow flavors of brown sugar, alcohol and crystal malt bitterness, a bit of mineral twang, and a slight leafy hop presence. Pleasantly bitter on the rather long finish, which is likely the best aspect of the taste. Full on the palate but feels a bit watery all the same. Tame overall, but I prefer beers that err on this side rather than going too ""extreme"" and resulting in a gigantic balls-out mess. A decent ""beginner's"" barleywine."
"Drinkability: A very good and singular barleywine. Around $5 a bottle (for, I think, most of the Big Smuttynose brews) is a remarkable price for this, and I wouldn't mind snagging a bunch for the cellar. Like most good versions of the style, this has potential to get much better, as there's a lot of backbone here, a lot of complexity, and a lot of balance."
"Hazy orange-brown with an off white head. Aroma of pineapple, pepper, and pine along with a detectable alcohol presence. Flavor is hoppy, but not overly so, which seems to be a common occurence in American Barleywines. Piney hops blend nicely into a biscuity caramel sweetness. Could benefit from a fuller body. Alcohol is a bit too prevalent for 10%. Maybe putting this down for a couple years would help this. Still a very good brew that I would definitely buy again."
"Smuttynose Barleywine Style Ale would have been a better beer with twice as much hop flavor and half as much alcohol presence. I can understand the former being considerably less aggressive with age, but why didn't the latter mellow as well? If you're cellaring an '05, I'd suggest waiting another year or two at the very least."
"It has been great catching up on some of the Smuttynose big beers. None of them have disappointed me so far. This one (which was the last one in the fridge might I add) I grabbed at Colonial Spirits in Acton. It poured into a Rapscallion sniffer glass a lush amber color with nice head retention, and chunks of yeast floating around towards the latter half of the bottle. It also exploded when I first opened it (too much time in the fridge or moved around a bit too much I assume). In the aroma were ripe strawberries, some dried grain, alcohol, and the faintest hint of vanilla. Taste was very rough, though in a good way, with lots of bittering hops, raisins, and more grain. Alcohol was there, but not too heavy. Mouthfeel for this style was medium I would say, and pretty drinkable. Im surprised to say that I killed the bomber easily. This is definitely a Barleywine to sip and savor. At first it seemed a bit harsh, but as it warmed, it became quite the lovely treat. I wish I had a cigar on hand to go along with this one. This might not be the best of the Smuttynose big beer series, but its one of the more enjoyable Barleywines I have had recently."
"A decent American barleywine, it has all of the hallmark features. I could not drink a whole bomber by myself in one sitting. A 12oz. serving is enough for a nice, warming, nightcap."
"Sharp and spicy hop notes that strike quick, but leave a dry distinct bitterness on the palate. Has a bit of white wine like feeling in the finish. Fruity and floral flavors get wiped out by an alcoholic sharpness that leads to a clean and slightly dry aftertaste. Hops seemed to have faded a bit and aren't as big and juicy as they might have been fresh. Caramel malt notes are detected. A very clean barleywine without the big juicy malt and hop profiles I was looking for. Still decent, this one packs a punch with it's high abv."
"med haze to the crimson amber ale, but large pine colored froth is impressive. Aroma of hopped caramel and alcohol, and a little creme fraiche. Tastes of bruised fruits and alcohol. Otherwise, it's relatively dull. Bitter up front, carried by alcohol to a bitter finish. Reminds me of a hot toddy. Has a bergamot finish-astingent, herbal, medicinal. Caramel to burnt caramel to smoke. Begins with dried golden raisins, a little earthy floral flourishes. Tastes like whiskey. Quite amazing in that regard. I enjoyed sipping it, but wish I'd had this one fresh."
"A tasty and drinkable big beer. A very good sipper for a cold winter's night. Hoppy enough to reduce its approachability, wouldnt recommend this to someone who wasnt found of bitter hops. Glad i got the chance to drink this one, and looking forward to seeing how it ages, thanks Bill!"
"Pours a clear red/orange, nice thick off white head, lots of lace, good retention from these guys. Smell is sweet, very malty, lots of toffee, some floral, citrus/pine, pretty standard barleywine. Taste is very malty, nice dark fruit/toffee, some pine and floral, very rich, nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very nice, and good with food. Thanks Tim (beerfruit)!"
"Nice job Smuttynose! Cheers!"
"Clear, reddish amber with a fine, off-white head. It poured with a thin cap, but produced very nice lacing. Rich caramel aroma with some citrusy hops and alcohol. The flavour was quite balanced, with moderate bitterness played against warm caramel and toffee. Full bodied with lightish carbonation and a fairly soft texture. This beer is quite drinkable for a barleywine. TheBeerFruit provided this bottle for sharing - thanks Tim!"
"D: This strikes me as the right time of year for this beer. It is two days before Christmas in central PA. There should be a few feet of snow on the ground, providing the needed cold for this very warming beer. Global warming is having a detrimental effect on my beer drinking..."
"The taste is very bready up front, with yeast and some mild fruit flavors. The finish is extremely bitter, but in an exciting way. Foral and pine hops are present throughout, but there is a sweetness to balance it all out. Mouthfeel is full and chewy, with a dry finish. This is one beer to just sip and enjoy the complexities of. The only knock it takes is drinkability; you won't be having many more than one in a session. Still highly reccomended."
"The pour into my snifter raises a only a thin, light tan glass ring that somehow manages to leave some thin lacing. The body is a very hazy ruby-amber. The nose seems at first quite musty, but is also loaded with alcohol, sugar, caramel, and candied fruits. Also, very hoppy in a piney way. The taste follows suit in most ways, with a fairly pronounced bitterness that is nonetheless balanced by the syrupy, candy-like malt. The mouth is pretty full, with an incredibly smooth carbonation. A pretty good BW, and a lot of fun in a bomber!"
"D- It's a really good beer. A few flaws like body could be a bit bigger, and alcohol covered up just a bit more. Other then those it is a very good beer."
"Overall a wonderful barleywine and in my opinion another success from Smuttynose."
"N- A huge barleywine, you don't notice the 10% at first because of all the flavor. I prefer my barleywine a little more subdued and mellow, but there's nothing wrong with this. It's a meal unto itself with all the tastes dancing around."
"DA: 10% ABV you really feel! but it's complex and tasty, this is a classic brew for the NE area IMO."
"D: This beer was too young for sure. I try to only drink my barleywines at the two year mark but didn't really have a choice with this one. I'll need to revisit again after a few years."
"Full body offset by ample carbonation. In my book, this is a good barleywine, but not revelatory."
"Great beer. Highly drinkable at 10% ABV."
"Smuttynose has an above-average Barleywine here. It's tasty and has a lot to offer. I am glad to have been able to try this one. Much thanks to Bill for this bottle."
"($3.59 / 22 oz.)"
"Sharp and biting with way too much hop presence for a barley wine ale. Mellows out a bit by mid sip, and presents a slightly syrupy sweet malt backbone. Alcohol is definitely present on this one, with a warming sensation that grows as the brew glides down the throat. Still a little harsh at this point, could benefit from some cellaring."
"Drinkability is not this beer's high point for me, and I'm glad I was splitting a bomber with someone else."
"Drinkability: I don't dislike this beer, just needs to watch what it does with it's alcohol."
"Ah, the taste has an omnipresent hoppiness to it. From the get go a gripping bitterness is present and it lingers on through to the finish, where it starts to become a bit more balanced by caramel malt notes. Sharp and biting with notes of menthol like pine that compliment the bitterness. There are some citrus notes noticeable as well, and this mix with a solid caramel malt note; the caramel note is more noticeable and makes one think of orange flavored caramels. Chewy, with a certain richness, yet not cloying. This beer is drinking really nicely, I was a bit wary of popping this tonight, but I am pleasantly surprised and really enjoying this beer right now."
"A deep, dark, clear amber fills my glass with a small head floating on top. Minimal lacing is left behind. Smell isn't as prominent as I thought it would be. Mostly sweet caramel malts with some alcohol. Taste is much better than the aroma. Again, sweet caramel with a floral, hoppy, bitter finish. Present throughout the experience is a nice warming from the alcohol. Everything a Barleywine should be, as far as taste goes, IMO. Nice body and perfect carbonation. Even better as it warms. I will be getting more of these. I think I my have found a replacement for the Bigfoots in the fridge."
"I wish, only, that what came from Smutty was more consistent, you know? Sure, as I noted in my last review, I had 5 great cases of this last year, but the first bottle I had this year was gross!"
"2006 bottle. Smells big with some caramel sugary sweetness, some piney hoppiness, prunes and raisins, and some alcohol in the aroma as well. Nice copper color and hazy with a tan-cream head that dissipates quickly. Mmm, you can tell this one is fresh with the hops asserting themselves well. Some malty sweetness up in the front, bitterness from the hops follows, blended with a little alcohol in the taste. All the flavors are large but differentiated. This is a great example of an American barleywine."
"D - The alcohol is a little too prevalent here, especially on the aftertaste. A bit of age would probably be best on this one to mellow it all out."
"Bottle: Poured a medium dark copper color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention. Aroma of sweet malt with some traces of dry figs. Taste is mostly dominated by some strong and sweet malt with a nice subtle floral touch. Dry figs and prunes are present though not overly dominant. Body is above average and alcohol is well hidden. Overall, this is a very nice barleywine but lack of complexity doesnt allow to elevate to great status."
"This pours a dark reddish amber with a large tan foamy head. This is a very nice looking beer. The smell has dark fruit, malt, and alcohol as the main scents. The taste is hoppy with dark fruit,very nice. This is alittle too hoppy for a traditional barleywine, but it tastes great. The m/f is heavy with all the flavors mixing very well. Some people don't like this because it's ""too hoppy'. I say if it's a good beer it's a good beer. Cheers."
"Nice deep amber/orange color. Good aroma-pleasant mix of hops and some sweey malt. Sort of oakey and vanilla. Very dry in the flavor-mix of hops and alcohol. Doesnt scream the malty sweetness of some other BWs. Decent body. All around a decent barleywine. I have to admit I might have been looking for something with more ""bang"" to it but well worth a try as most Smutty products are."
"The body is nice and thick, though a bit syrupy. Very dry in the finish. Drinkability is good, though I'm glad my roommate was around to help me get through it."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with a killer hop aroma. It has a wonderful burnt toffee smell. Damn, this is enticing. The taste is great! It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down slow and warming with a nice hop filled finish. It's rich and bitter with burnt toffee notes and fruity yeast overtones. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an awesome brew. It's big with loads of flavor and aroma; a real treat."
"Notes: The hop bitterness was nice atribute to this one which I did enjoy the lace lines the glass all the way through. Cheers!"
"Poured a deep garnet red with a thinner slight off white head,this is an old school barley wine in the nose meaning mainly big malt sweet cherry and brown sugar dominate I even picked a touch of smoke in there.Nice big chewey mouthfeel but went down quite easy,big malty flavors to go along with the chewey mouthfeel once again rum soaked cherries and vanilla with notes of carmael and brown sugar with just a light smack of pine in the finish letting you know the hops are there.I didnt get the big hop presence of this beer like many others who have reviewed it a nice barley wine none the less."
"i think ill age a bottle, although i dont know this will necessarily go in the right direction for cellar gold. disappointing, although drinkable. smutty is always good but this runs along the bottom thread of the spectrum."
"Thanks to chaduvel for this big intimidating beer. Bright crimson garnet body with a finger of tight, light beige head. Ripe fruity malts on the nose with a vinous, sherry tang. Obvious alcohol notes suggest that I'm in for a good night. Herbal, slightly resinous hop backing. Very fruity malt flavors up front with fruit cocktail syrup, pineapples, pears (candied), and brandy. Solid toffee and caramel sweetness in there as well. Bitter (slightly astringent) hop echo throughout. Hops come through as medicinal and herbal in the end. Alcohol is noticeable and warming and a tad medicinal. I really like the big fruitiness up front, but the medicinal character is a little too much. Full-bodied with explosive malt sweetness. Trending toward syrupy. I'll easily finish the bottle, but not my favorite barleywine. Needs a little work with the hop end and the alcohol, but pretty good."
"D - well done smutty nose, easily drunk, a well crafted beer"
"Got this at Shaw's in Concord NH. Pours a nice dark reddish color, smells quite citrusy. Really nice taste of malt, strong citrusy flavors, a little medecinal, but the flavors really work well together. Nice mouthfeel, finishes again a bit citrusy. This is a batch from 2006. Really nice stuff this and Smutty's wheat wine. I've yet to fully explore all of Smutty's beers."
"Burgundy color. Sherry-like oxidation is unfortunately, very profound in the aroma. Nuts and ripe fruits are present in the aroma as well, with hints of peanut brittle, caramel corn and mocha. The mouth experience is quite tame, considering the style. Unfortunate oxidation initially on the palate, while on the mid-palate ripe fruity esters and mocha hints are present, which leads into a caramel, port-like finish."
"Get them while they're available. Unfortunately the season for this seasonal brew ends to quickly."
"I might get another of these at some point to cellar for a few more months, but I'm not so keen on this right now."
"Pours a little frothy, no head at all. On the second pour there is a one finger thick head. Bitter acidic smell. A little thin, not strong enough of a malt backbone for the big grapefruit hoppy flavors. The big time grapefruit is a little one sided, but still tasty. Alcohol kick in the finish. A good barleywine from a great brewery."
"Clear reddish brown with about a finger of light brown head. Piney and earthy hop aroma with a good dose of sweet caramel. Sadly the alcohol flavor is the dominant flavor. There is some caramel in the background, and a bitter finish, but there's not much getting past the alcohol. Thin/medium bodied with lots of carbonation. This one needed some age on it to tame the alcohol a little, but I'd be interested in giving it another shot."
"The problem with a recently bottled 10% abv Barleywine is how intense the alcohol presence comes across, and this one is no exception. Decent flavors, but could use about 9 to 12 months to properly age."
"Not bad, but not as good as some of the others in the ""big beer"" series. Great value for the price though."
"This is a great sipping barley wine, one to enjoy with a good meal, a nice stew or even a sweet dessert."
"BIG BEER SERIES strikes again! This is one serious beer, big alcohol, big hops and big taste. This palatable offering is huge on the tongue. Hops running wild all over the place, The bitter kind, the yummy kind, the dry kind. Nose is fresh cut grass, fused with a tangy Caribbean like concoction. This is as close to a ""wine"" as I've found in Barleywines. I am not necessarily looking for that, but it is a very diverse and ""extreme"" beer. Seasonal? Unique?"
"This beer was a claret color with a modest head and a small amount of lacing. It had a nice roasted grain odor. The taste was predominately hoppy, with a little fruitiness thrown in. The hop taste remained a long time. A very smooth, rich beer. I didn't notice the alcohol, but one big bottle is all I'd want to drink in a single sitting."
"It is drinkable but will be more drinkable given some time."
"What are you waiting for? Taste!"
"Pours a radiant reddish orange with a nice sustaining head. Lots of bubbles cruising through the glass. Smells very sour and hoppy but theres a big malt behind it. I poured it right out of the fridge and theres a caustic alcohol smell. That doesnt seem right. In fact, it seems down right wrong. The flavor is much hoppier than I expected and theres a dry metallic finish. Not a flavor that you want lingering in the mouth. Tastes a lot better to drink it quickly. Also, the alcohol is very prominent. Not so good. Mouthfeel is thin and a little too bubbly. Disappointing."
"This is a slow goer, made to sip and savor. It wasnt my favorite Barleywine style ale I've had to date, but that doesn't make it bad by any means. And its definitely a good local offering. (to me in MA) Id like to see what some time would do with this. I think some sweet maltiness could really come through."
"A fairly decent (yawn) Barleywine. It pours like light amber and gives a nice bubbly chunky head of off tan that leaves good lace. The smells is of strong hops, but not really C-hops, a nice malty sting to the nose as well. The taste is rather disappointing, more like a 1.5 IPA. Good upfront hop flavor that fades back to a light sugary malt with out much substance. It has a solid body thanks to the ample alcohol and it is a good drinker at $3.99 for a 22oz."
"Grins. This is a pretty damned good barleywine. Damn the tacky feel in transition for this would be truly a great one."
"22 ounce bottle, thanks charlesw! 2005 batch!"
"I think this is a winner from Smuttynose and from pete!"
"Drinkability is high. Really flows smoothly and balances out the different components of the style. Find one of these."
"I got it at Blind Tiger at NYC and it was the second best thing on tap that night. (first being their Oak Aged Imperial Stout) It poured to a dark orange/copper color and an off-white head. the head didnt stay around or she poured very carefully. I turned around while she poured it so I could have missed something. THe smell was really unique. Peaches and Apricots. I swear there was a peach in there. the flavor was big and strong with malt sweetness, and very little bitterness. The aftertaste was what got me off of this beer. Either it was very dry or very bitter. Mouth-puckering, but not sour."
"slightly hazy reddish brown with decent tan head. the smell is a little boozey with dark fruits (mostly fig with some slight black cherry), graininess and mild semi raw malt aromas. some citrus and brown sugar upon warming. some what sudued with a little astringencey now and again. dry grainy taste with the dark fruits underneath (fig and cherry again). cirtrus and a bit of hops show themselves at the back. nice chewy rich mouthfeel, with delicate carbonation. a good barleywine that i will come back to. it seems like it might be a bit young though. i'd be interested to see how some aging benefits this."
"Big thanks to warriorsoul for this beer. I've been meaning to try it, and today seems like the right time. Cellar temperature. It pours a deep amber color with a 3 finger head that falls to a finger over top. No active carbonation at all in the glass and a nice bit of junk from the bottle. The nose is nice, but with maybe a touch too much alcohol in there. I get nice thick caramel, not a lot of hop character. Overall, a very nice aroma, but I would like a bit more hop and a little less alcohol. The flavor is okay, with a fairly prevalent alcohol over a caramel base with a hint of a spicey hop. Too much alcohol. The feel is on the light side of thick, with a moderate carbonation. Overall, a nice beer. I find the alcohol to be too forward and too warm. The nose and flavors are nice. I would like a little more body as well."
"Taste was of caramel and smoky sweet sugars earthy pine combined with some fruity hop flavors as well. Leaves a slight burn in the chest from the alcohol. Mouthfeel was crisp and quite creamy and finished crisp and very slightly dry. I found this to be very enojoyable. It was subtle and elegant. Worth a try for sure. I will be buying more of this soon."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 2"" tan head above the clear, orangey copper brew. Head exhibits nice lasting power, with heavy foam lacing. Aroma is strongly of spices and grain alcohol. Taste is similar to the nose, but a bit more controlled with the alcohol. As it warms more and more flavor nuances come out. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both nice for the style. An enjoyable barleywine, although I was a bit scared initially by the nose, it all settled down nicely."
"Unearthly plume of carbonation that is at least an inch and a half in height and evinces a wonderful stick and lace. Light ruby hue with an almost orange tint and great clarity; quietly ascending action. Nice fruit punch bouquet on nose straight up composed of grapes, kiwi, oranges, and grapefruit; babbling malt as well with some spicy alcohol heat. Quite sweet, and somewhat sticky on the mouth; some very light oak and pine roastiness and an almost brisk carbonation add up to a great concoction."
"As good as the taste was, I could somehow not shake the feeling that the body was a bit too thin, and the beer too well attenuated. Not a hollow empty thinness, but more of an unreached potential in my opinion. The aftertaste was a lingering peppery alcohol burn, which in the end could not hide under the depleted body and mostly earthy hops."
"The head has loose bubbles which build a 1/4 inch head. The color is a reddish-orange. The smell is sweet, with a hint vegetal funk. The flavor is like pineapple, cherries, and toasty malt. The body seems light for a barley wine, which makes this offering alot like a strong IPA."
"Dark Ruby brown body with a caramel head. that fluffs up and fadessmells citrus hoppy, pruney, raisonsslight tinge of alcohol, very sweet and a hint of apples. my first sip made me surprised at how hoppy it was, i had expected a different angle from smutty, but by the end of the bottle the hop content has tappered. by about hald way through the yeast notes picked up considerably. bready body with defiante raison and prune notes as well as sherry, a more typically british hop character, which is suprising considering my initial reaction. very drinkable. dangerously so. but a wonderful brew. smutty never lets me down. cant wait to age this one and check her out in a few monthes."
"This is an excellent sipping beer and one that will provide you with a killer buzz. Its also a steal at $4.20 a bomber and begs to be aged, which I just might have to do. Another great beer by Smuttynose."
"Very drinkable for a barleywine. Comfortable."
"Pours to a hazy deep copper brown color with a tan head. The aroma is malty, toasty, citrusy and alcoholic. It has a caramelly and toffee aroma as well. The flavor is malty and bready with a rum and fruitiness. It has a good level of bitterness, not too overpowering. It is medium in body and alcoholic. It is an okay B-wine....wouldn't seek out again."
"Deep ruby color, slightly cloudy, with a thick off-white head composed of tightly packed dense bubbles. The nose has a fruity character, grapefruit and orange, with a floral hop character. There is a faint caramel hint, very faint. The taste is more of a high alcohol IPA. The grapefruit and orange is there, along with a mild hop flower. More caramel in the flavor than in the nose. There is some alcohol heat in the flavor component. Mouth feel is rich and slightly slick. Reasonably drinkable beer. I was expecting a little more flavor, I think Ill let this warm a little and try again."
"Pours a ruby orange with a thick creamy head. Nose is a bit subdued, considering the size of the beer. Hoppy grassy notes dominate the nose and come out in the taste. While the nose hints at just how rich this beer is, it definitely comes out in the taste. Great understated flavor that you don't realize is a powerhouse until it reaches your stomach. The high alcohol content is balanced well too. All in all - a very good barleywine - definitely a good winter warmer, and highly recommended."
"I would prefer this particular offering aged for at least a year, and I will do this with the few bottles I just picked up last week...I could simply not avoid picking up a growler of this brew when I saw it available...blame me?"
"Bender Factor: I only wish I had the first half of the pour. This clearly needs to mellow out. Regardless, I am awaiting its public release."
"If i'm not mistaken, it seems as though the formula for this years Smutty Barley is in no way related to those from years past. I've had a few bottles from 2003, and they seem to be completely different (not in the ""aged"" kind of different, but rather in the ""this tastes completely different"" kind of way). From my perspective, there is nothing terribly wrong with this beer, and it's certainly strong enough for my liking, but nor does anything exceptional go on here. I wouldn't recommend it, simply because there are better A.B.W. choices out there, but in all reality this isn't half bad."
"22oz. bomber: This beer poured an amber color, that was a touch hazy. it has absolutely no head to it at all, and almost no carbonation. The aroma is nice. Some sweeter fruits in there, as well as a hint of hops burried in the background. The taste has some bitterness to it up front, followed by some malt sweetness. Somewhat spicy with fruits also. Not bad."
"Reviewed from a 22oz bomber sampled on 12/29/04. Appears a murky orange red with a slow forming small tan head. Not much head retention and scattered light lacing. Aroma is sweet and a bit syrupy. Notes of fruit and toasty malts were also present. Taste was sweet with caramel and notes of dark fruits. There was a good bitter hop presence as well a slight alcohol kick. It also warmed me up quite well. Mouthfeel was about full with a sticky sweetness to it. This never gets to sweet, which is one downfall for some barley wines and makes them less drinkable. Overall a good barley wine that I would have again."
"Thanks to malto for this very BIG beer."
"A taste reveals huge creamy malts followed by a battle royal between pine and citrussy hops. A lot of candied fruit, dates, and roasted malt flavors abound. Alcohol level is evident, but subtle. Finishes slightly sweet with tongue-coating hops. Body is medium to big with creamy-soft carbonation. I reccomend sharing a bottle, as it is getting harder and harder to type!"
"Not a bad beer. I wouldn't mind having another."
"Dark copper with some orange and brown undertones. Pours with a big head that drops very quickly. Aroma is malt/sherry/alcohol. Taste is alcohol, heat, sweet malt. When first poured, a lot of alcohol heat but mellows as barleywine warms up. Decent barleywine and always a good price for a big beer."
"Ruby hints abund on a deep orange body without head. Powerful scotch ale aroma with lots of peat, light alcohol, a moderate amount of caramel plus hidden apricot and peaches in the background. Grapey vinous palate, alcoholic, very english sentiment. Rather high carbonation, slightly astringent, thin-medium bodied. Perhaps a bit straightforward, but a well-made example that Id definitely buy if I was in NH, but not necessarily if I had a MA or NY selection."
"Had on tap last weekend at the Barleypub in Dover, and they were pulling no punches, this was served in full pints. This was the '03 vintage. Light amber in color, low head. First thing I detected was the alcohol in the aroma, which made me a bit nervous. However, things went smoothly from there. Tasting notes indicate that any bitterness in the hops was more than smoothed away. The rich malt was also enticing. I would have to say that this beer was immensely drinkable, but at that abv one should be careful. Not a style I normally go for, but definitely a very pleasant drinking experience."
"Basically a perfect barleywine, or at least American style barleywine. Very yummy, Id take this anyday."
"22oz Bomber A slightly chill hazed amber with a thick frappy looking head. Aroma is of doughy malt that is slightly spicy and a faint floral hop note coming through. Body is smooth and a bit more carbonated than I like. Flavor has a good dose of hops and a light alcohol presence. Malty but not as sweet as other BW's I've tried recently. Overall one big ass beer but not quite good as others I've had."
"Largely clear, ruby in hue with a slight golden-tawny highlight, this has a very attractive color. A dim white head of almost one finger in height topped the beer. The head retention was very good, after a few moments it faded to a foamy cap and then to a collar. Subsequent lacing was minimal, basically nonexistent. At first the aromas were very bold with its fruitiness, like fresh grape juice mixed with a big red wine. This smell was intriguing. As I when back for more I was rewarded with much malty goodness. Man, was it rich! The supple maltiness was lovely, somewhat sweet with a kiss of caramel and a trace of deep toastiness (I cant call it roasty). Thankful that was not the end of the bouquet. The hops came to be after a few moments of sniffing like a fool; they offered a mellow but noticeable hint of citrus rinds. Before the nose concluded raisins, plums, and figs became apparent. The bouquet is mouthwatering and obviously inviting. The potency is louder than moderate and my greedy-ass wishes it was even bigger but, atlas, it is top-notch nevertheless. My bottle is a 2001 Edition, aged in UnionMades cellar (thanks!). This Big Beer still packs one hell of an alcoholic punch. That is both impressive and disappointing. This is quite a flavorful Barleywine, the maltiness is big and chewy. Plenty amble. There are bushels of plums and raisins. Let me not for get the hops, even after a few years they are noticeable and offer modest bitterness and some citrusy-pine flavors. The weakened hops are no match for the big, malty sweetness (which reminds me of a fresh SA Double Bock). This doesnt take in to consideration the alcohol punch. As the beer finish a good belt of alcohol heat/spice blends with figs, chocolate, and plums. There are plenty of flavors going on here and they all fall into the realm of what is considered a Barleywine (as expected). Since this sample as been aged I cant make assumptions about this beer okay, I will anyway. It seems to be an English-style Barleywine with a distinct East Coast influence. Then again, I might be full of it. When this beer is released next winter I think I might have to trade for a fresh sample, for comparison. This beer is really begging to be paired with aged cheddar cheese or smoked Gouda and some seasonal fruit. I think I will heed its request! Ive had many great Barleywines and this is Top-5 material! In retrospect I could have aged this even longer, maybe the alcohol would have hid more and the sweetness would have curbed. Maybe not, this might be as good as it gets. Which is fine by me. Almost full bodied, I mean it is really close to full, the carbonation is low but natural, and the mouthfeel is quite pleasant. Even with the alcohol heat and the 10% abv this is very drinkable, granted I needed to sip and savor but it is drinkable nonetheless. Lovely. Thank you UnionMade for allowing me to sampling this gem, straight from your cellar. Awesome stuff."
"Nice sweet deep plum smell. Hazy dark purple color with lots of bubbles and carbonation. Good pale white large bubbled head. Interesting look for a BW. Very soft mouth. Strong abv warmth on the tongue upfront, the brew then sweetens with burnt caramel and prune. Quite complex and dry on the slightly sour finish."
"Thanks go to yankeeheel."
"bomber bottle, no freshness dating found. Pours golden amber, clear, minimal head, tiny buble film, leaves minimal lacing. Nose is faint malt. Taste is smooth, malt. Vanilla, leather,melon and caramel. Hops are subtle, not overpowering. Grainy, grapefruit hop notes come through. Quite warming with Alcohol (10%!) present, but well hidden by fulll flavors of this tasty sipper. well done, seek and enjoy."
"Good head for style and it has a great aroma. It's all butter and alcoholic caramel. The alcohol provides a nice warmth and the a nice citrus rind hoppiness. The malt, which there is plenty of, is pleasantly sweet, but the bitter finish almost doesn't fit. It could probably benefit from aging a bit longer. It's got the potential."
"Drinkability. I'm going to get another bottle of this and lay it down. I'd like to see it when the hops settle in."
"The mouthfeel was smooth with a slighty dry finish. The malt and alcohol tones lingered after swallowing. Heavier bodied. This brew had a great taste and paired perfectly with the chocolate raspberry tart we had for dessert. I prefer 12 oz or less for barleywine servings, so the big bottle is a bit disappointing unless friends are around to help you out."
"It's malty and sweet with just enough hops presence to keep it from becoming cloying. the cherry and berry notes give a lightly frivolous color to the flavor profile, but the malt and hops help keep it on the ground. One thing that truly stands out is the bladfaced and big ABV. It warms from first sip, imparting a pleasant glow, while sending a homey warning to the sensible drinker. And good sense tells you that this one should be plenty, but that'll let you relax and enjoy the one you're having. It's very fundamental, but I'd consider it worth the small effort it would take to pop the top on another in the foreseeable future."
"Off copper color with little head, smell was fruity but with a distinct alcohol presence. Taste was initially sweet with with increasing hop bitterness at the finish. Alcohol was definitely present but not overpowering for the high abv. Mouthfeel was full-bodied but with a very nice dry finish. Very drinkable, but in a definite sipping way."
"One of my three favorite barleywines, no question."
"Small yellowish khaki colored head that faded quickly to a film. Ruby brown colored beer with an amber tinge. Aroma of sweet malts and alcoholic grapefruit candy. Flowery hops up front right into slick sweet malt. A moderate bodied beer with very light carbonation and a slightly bitter and alcoholic finish that leaves a warm feeling in your stomach. It could have used more carbonation and some bite, too sweet for the flavor."
"Taste is dominated by the big malty flavors. Big caramel and hints of nut. Alcohol flavors very apparent as well. But the hops stand up to this big body with a strong hoppy/citrusy finish. Big bodied with a bitter hoppy aftertaste that stays with you. A bit sticky. Pretty drinkable for a young barleywine although not as drinkable as, say, SN Bigfoot. You can tell that this one will age beautifully. Let this one alone for a few months and I'll bet it will be even better."
"Poured into a snifter, this hazy amber brew smelled sweet and with a hint of citrus fruit. It grew a nice head, which settled and would reappear with a little twirl. The flavors were a mix of fruit flavors, tangerines and raisons with brown sugar sweetness. While the big beer is 10% ABV, there is very little alcohol flavor. The ethanol has a very noticeable presence, sculpting an incredible mouthfeel. The beer has body, but doesn't seem bogged down by any undesirable heaviness. It's remarkably drinkable, and is easily the best of the young barleywines that I have enjoyed this winter."
"Enjoyed at room temperature. Its slightly hazy copper body has a ruby cast and displays deep amber highlights beneath a creamy head of ivory foam. Initially the head holds quite well and leaves wide swatches of lace about the glass, but it eventually fades to just a wide but creamy collar and some cottony surface covering. The nose delivers a variety of fruits (without being very specific about any one in particular) and some grassy and citrusy hops over a caramel-drenched maltiness. The body is medium-full with a very fine, natural carbonation that leaves it quite smooth and velvety across the palate. Rich, caramel malt is equally balanced in the flavor by juicy fruitiness, grassy and lightly citrusy hops, and a brisk bitterness. Its alcohol is noticeable within the first few sips, but it never becomes excessive. It finishes dry as its malt and fruit flavor fade quickly but leave its bold bitterness and some leafy and grassy hop flavors behind. Well done and certainly worth trying, but be sure to enjoy this one at closer to cellar temperature to get its full range of flavors."
"Drinkability: Reminds me of a toned-down Old Horizontal. Very nice, but not as memorable as so many others."
"What a smooth brew! Very drinkable for 10%abv. Excellent example of the style."
"This barleywine poured with a nice amount of carbonation. Creating a nice light off white head. The aroma is all at once sweet, floral and alcohol. The flavor on the other hand was much more subdued. Just a touch of sweetness at the begining, a stronger hop finish than the aroma fortold and the alcohol does not hit until it lands in your stomach with a rush of warmth.This is a bottle that I put away when I bought it in 2002. I had expected the hop characteristic to mellow somewhat and more fruity flavors to assert themselves."
"Pours a darkish reddish tea colour with an offwhite thin head. The head dissapeared rather quicky and left a think layer of lace. Nose is of dried dark fruits with a carmel hint. Amost like a glaced fruit that was a bit over done. While the taste is a bit like the nose, there is a definate strong hop presence in the beer. It is an interesting sort of dance that the beer does as it goes across the palate. First sweet then bitter with just a final presence of burnt rock candy at the end. It almost had a Belgian type sweetness at the finish. Mouthfeel was a bit thinnner than I had expected, but it could be because the bottle is a year old. There was some sediment at the bottom. Overall it was a nice barleywine style beer that I would certainly try again"
"Beautifully clear deep garnet hue. Thin, spotty light beige head yields foam wisps. Pungent waft of ethanol heat and burnt toffee hits the nose intially. Mellows promptly, with softer notes of butterscotch and woody, sweet pine like hop ensuing. Esters are of a combined fig and subtle bland pear nature. A touch rough around the edges aromawise. In flavor, the incipient snap of simple medium caramel sweetness is quickly overrun by a barrage of bittersweet, peppery alcohol and assertive, drying hop bitterness. Pronounced nutty, singed biscuit character combvines with the background diacetyl to lend an impression of burnt, bourbon soaked movie popcorn... in a good way. Mellow, but bright ripe strawberry like fruit ester undertone. Expectedly woody hop flavor, but with a citric, lemon rind tinge. Well attenuated and a bit lean in body to support the malt and fruit character. Thinnish, yet syrupy in mouthfeel. Hop bitterness is unyielding, and eventually outlasts residual sweetness. Finishes with a brief resurgence of soft caramel, but with fading quinine like bitterness and augmenting ethanol warmth. A tasty barleywine, yes, but not all flavor components coalesce. Regardless, it's certainly a well crafted and ballsy brew. Thanks to Bierman9 for the bomber I've been saving for a while!"
"Overall: I enjoyed my first Smuttynose brew. In addition, on a cold winter night as tonight it warms the bones and gives you a warm fuzzie inside. There are a lot of things going on in this beer. It has a sweet sticky-ness to it and makes you feel warm all over, with a smooth mouth feel. Drinkability is good as long as you can stand the punch of the alcohol. Try it, you will like it!"
"Drinkability is excellent. Like I said this isn't a harsh barley wine, but a nice mix. I wouldn't think it was 10% unless I read it. One of the best I have had."
"pours a nice amber colour with a light tan head that is surprisingly thin and short lived. smells mainly of sweetness and alcohol: carmel, malt, earth and fruit are all detected within. the taste is a more mellow version of the smell, but with a bit of a spice kick to it and a slightly more overpowering alcoholic taste than i would have preferred. whist more in the style of a barleywine than actually a true barleywine (as the label states), it is a more accessible stab at the style than most, but it needs to work on it's blanace of flavours a bit. maybe a bit of aging would do this one some good."
"Overall: A very good effort, and whilst not quite up there with the best of them, its not far behind, it is perhaps a second tier Barleywine when fresh. Maybe a year, or two, in the cellar will improve this one, I think so."
"Moderate mouthfeel is big and smooth, making this beer full and way too easy to drink. Extremely hoppy and could use a little aging, but I enjoyed it greatly. Too bad it sat in a frigid case for months before it got to me. Can't wait to find some more and let it lay for awhile. Yes, please."
"Cheers!"
"The bottom-line: Great beer and worth having again."
"Drinkability: Umm.. I'll probably pass on another, or let the bottle age more if I succumb to temptation. I imagine this is not the easiest style to nail down, brewing wise. Still, it appears to be a good entry level barleywine in my experience. Hits all the notes you should hit, just in the wrong proportions."
"Large-size thanks to Bierman9 for this beautiful bomber!"
"A minimal dirty white head leaves nice lacing as it recedes, nice looking slightly hazy amber/ dark honey colored liquid with sparse bubbles slowly fighting their way thru the viscous ale. A very fruity nose with a background dark fruit undercurrent and sweet malt, spicy hoppiness...a hint of what's to come! The taste is a lush, solidly chewy and fruity malt base with a powerfully bitter hop bite that's pushed aside by a warming, brandyish alcoholic warmth. Very light note of phenolic ""band-aid"" tasted after swallowing. Finishes up rich & very strong, very bitter...powerful and ballsy! This is indeed a hop monster, it almost ""out-Bigfoots"" Bigfoot, my personal benchmark for the style. A great buy for $2.99 per bomber."
"Tons of malt, caramel, apples, plums, & BIG orangey hops. This is finished with a bit a warming alcohol in the throat. All of this is wrapped up in a thick syrupy liquid. Quite hearty."
"Not a bad all round beer, but it is not as balanced as some other notable microbrewed barleywines."
"Lovely big brew for the fall!"
" Smell is mega malty, sweet bread ,hop & alcohol vapors. Taste is very sweet & too medicinal at first. It seems to mellow after a few sips. There's some nice breadiness in there, and a slight hop bitterness & some alcohol in the finish. Can't help but wonder about these floaties. Mouthfeel is thick & smooth, but the aftertaste is medicinal. Not a very drinkable barleywine as I'm not sure I can finish my pint."
"this is quite a powerful brew. Very rich and malty as the label states. The alcohol presence is at times overpowering. I'm wishing I had a 12oz bottle instead. Still, I'm enjoying it more as I go, and there is a nice hop balance in the finish. Definitely worth a try, but not something I'd revisit too soon..."
"This is one of the finest barleywines that I have ever tasted. Indeed, I have been nursing this for well over an hour, sitting on my desk and doing some work, and it has been a profoundly pleasant companion. Smuttynose's Big Beer Series is a triumph."
"Pours deep copper in color, with a good size tan head with quickly receeds to leave small amounts of lace. Aroma is dominated by raw maltiness, but has a good flowery and perfumy hoppiness to back it up. Flavor starts strongly malty (raw grains, some bread), in the middle the hops push through, and ends strongly citric and bitter from the hops, and also has some spiciness thrown in for good measure. Body was full, lightly alcoholic. Seemed a bit ""raw"" to me, maybe it's too young, but still pretty darn good."
"Pours a burnt amber color with red highlights topped off by a 1/4-inch bubbly froth. The head retention is virtually non-existent, leaving no lace. The isnt much of an aroma, but I did detect hints of fruit, caramel, and alcohol. The taste is very bold. The alcohol, which is very strong, is the first thing to hit the taste buds. Once you get past that alcohol taste there is a nice medley of flavors with toasted malt and caramelized sugar being the primary ones. There are also some sweet fruit undertones. There was a very slick, oily texture left on my tongue, which seemed to hold the bitter aftertaste in my mouth for a long time. This is an average barleywine, moderately drinkable."
"Semper Fi Mac!"
" Postscript: Aging does indeed mellow and meld the flavors in this Barleywine. On draft, the balance is more complete and the mouth feels is fuller and more mellow. I fine BIG Beer from a fine brewery."

"This is not amoung the better barleywines I've had. Pours a deep amber with a nice head and a bunch of floating particles. Tastes sickly sweet and bitter at the same time. But not a good bitter or a good sickly sweet. The aftertaste is very annoying, but the only thing in front of me to clean it is more of this beer. D'oh! Drinkable, but nothing here to jump up and down about or stock a celler with."
"Always see warm 22 oz bottles of this in Shaw's or othersupermarkets. Bought one to try it. Fruity taste, more closer to wine. Not a big fan of this. It tastes like someone poured wine into my beer. I've had barleywine before, and this is just not very good."
"Notes: We think Smuttyies has done it again. Perhaps one of the best Barleywines available. Downright exceptional, balanced beyond belief and a honor to drink. 7.0% abv."
