"Pours a beautiful brown coating with a very thin off-white head that dissipates rather quickly into the abyss of fine barleywine. Aroma gives off a phenomenal smell of pure barleywine - wood,  sweet figs, and slight alcohol. The flavors replicate the aromatic qualities very well along with toffee and raisins. By grace, this is a delicious beer! This is just a tad below Cigar City's Leon, but a cut above Steel Toe's Lunker - both world-class bourbon barrel barleywines in my book! Very impressive coming out of a brewery that is well known for IPA centric beers."

"The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Having a '12 and '09 vintage, the fresher bottle was much better. A beer that really does live up to its hype."

"Didn't expect this quality from an IPA powerhouse. Very rich, smooth and lightly toasted vanilla. 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter."

"O: not sure why this is classified as an American barleywine, seems like an English style through and through; good flavor profile and well balanced but the sweetness is a bit overpowering; starting to oxidize and the bourbon was much less than I expected.  A good offering and worth trying but not in my top echelon of King Henry, Cognac Church on a Hill, Sucaba, and Mother of All Storms"

"This one seems to fly under the radar a bit, it's amazing, but not a whole lot of people talk about. People should talk about it more."

"Pour is extremely dark burgundy with a small amount of tight tan head.  Nose has some light bourbon notes up front, chocolate maltiness with figs and raisin.  Taste is bright and tight, bourbon is subtle but helps balance the malt sweetness.  Figs and raisin play a strong role with chocolate and dark malt presence with berry notes, caramel, and brown sugar in back.  Full bodied with soft carbonation and a very creamy inviting palate."

"dark red pour with a slight head. smell of slight bourbon and dark fruits...quite appealing! taste is smooth as silk with the dark fruits and slight bourbon finish. body isnt even that thick honestly...its really creamy and so smooth. damn tasty. probably the best barrel aged barleywine in existence... definitely worth the hype. so greaT! worth the hype. trade for it NOW!"

"Overall: Alpine Great very much reminds me of Kuhnhenn BA 4D. Great is also reminicent of really fresh Mother of all Storms. I think that Alpine Great is not an American Barleywine; rather it is more of a cross between a barrel aged English Barleywine and a barrel aged Old Ale in my opinion. This beer is huge and flavorful; my recommendation is to split a 12 bottle with a friend because 6oz of Great is enough for one sitting."

"O- An American barleywine that drinks more like what an English barleywine does; little American hop flavours come out yet its just enough to make it interesting. Importantly, it balances out the sweet malts that would otherwise make it too cloying. Great mouthfeel and very drinkable."

"Overall - Reminds me of JW Lees. Not a ton of bourbon, but it does allow the base beer to shine."
""
""
"O: Fantastic beer. One of those rare beers that I take the first sip, and literally say ""wow"". Easily in the top handful of barleywine's Ive ever had. Well worth the wait. A must try. Thanks again socalbrewlvr!"
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This was outstanding. Awesomeness in a bottle. The flavor could use a touch of bitterness to help balance the overwhelming sweetness, but in small doses, this isn't an issue at all. I'm also surprised this was just aged in Jack Daniels barrels and there was no use of maple anything in its creation. Wonderfully flavorful and decadent with an impressive, non boozy feel to go with it. A real treat. Thanks again Vanlingleipa. Good times Doopie!"

"2013 vintage bottle, poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours a typical dark brown with little to no head at all. In fact, it is almost still. Nose is predominantly bourbon, with some nice dark dried fruit and caramel. Not quite as impressive on the aroma as I had expected. Taste is a follow-through on the nose. Had high hopes for this one, and it is good, but not King Henry good. The mouth feel is essentially flat and thin. Fairly standard, if mild, flavors for the style - bourbon, wood, caramel, figs, etc. Super sweet, with some hints of oxidation. Ultimately, it is lacking all the way around when compared to some of it's peers. Don't get me wrong, I like this beer, but considering the hype, there are far better examples of the style out there (King Henry, Blendiculous, etc). Drink 'em if you got 'em, because this one probably won't age well."
""
""
"Unctuous. Stands out among the very best barrel aged barleywines, or barrel aged beers, I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good barleywine from Alpine that is sweeter than most and best enjoyed as a sipper to relish in all that flavor. Very sweet at first but this beer gets better sip by sip and is definitely worth seeking out."
""
""
"Cost: $10.99 for a 12 oz bottle."

"Verdict: A very delicious Barrel Aged Barleywine from Alpine and certainly the first non IPA I've found to be a home run from them. The alcohol is hidden expertly well and the flavors are quite sensational, a beer that lives up to its name."
""
""
""
""
"Honestly, one of the best beer of the year for me and top 10 all time. So damn good. I am very happy I traded for this puppy."

"Pours a hazy dark brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and toffee syrup and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a really smooth bourbon presence in the flavor that makes this one very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Opens with a rich wave of caramel, toasted brown sugar, toffee and light bourbon. Booze soaked raisin, chocolate, light plum and a slight woody dryness. Mouthfeel is slightly oily and slick, never becoming too heavy. Really hard to find much of the 14% here. To me, this is the best barleywine I've ever had. Amazing stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is amazing, slightly thick texture, very smooth and nice semi sweet taste. I can't taste 14% alcohol. This is very well balanced. The smell and taste compliment each other. I thought about trading some bottles, but after drinking 2 so far, I've decided to keep the rest. This beer is awesome, best barleywine I've had. Alpine beer company, thank you!"
""
""
""
"O - what an amazing beer. I keep going back to smell the beer but the actual taste and mouthfeel on this sucker is unreal. This thing doesn't need any age on it at all, it's ready to drink now. So smooth and layered."

"Thanks again to jzeilinger for opening this one with me. This poured out as a nice hazy brown color. The head comes and goes rather quickly. No real retention or lacing on this one. The beer smells sweet like caramel with a bit of barrel aging on the nose. The hops are a bit hidden on this. The taste of the beer is also sweet with a subtle bitterness in the finish, flavors of caramel and toffee in there with a minimal bitterness. I was hoping to get more of the JD barrel flavors from this but wasn't able too. The mouthfeel is smooth, very dangerous because it's easy to drink. Overall it's a good brew, really happy I got to try it."

"355mL at Woodshop 7. Pours a flat, muddy, lighter amber. Low to zero carbonation. Nose is savory with soy, truffle, shitake; sugared carrot, smoke, salt. Taste is salted caramel, honey, truffle oil, dense toffee. Palate has some heavy tannic structure to near paper. A little too thinned out and over oaked. 7/23/2012 8/3/8/3/16=3.8"

"o - overall, great is GREAT!!! had this one side-by-side with king henry, wooden, hell, BA HiFi batch 2, BA Old Ruffian and this was my clear favorite."
""
""
"O. I'm not the biggest fan of American Barleywines (I much prefer their English brethren). That said, Alpine Great blew me away. This was an absolute treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As always, thank so much Alex."
"Drink- A very good BW, but just not up to par with some of the heavy hitters we busted out last night."
""
"Cheers!"
"O: Unsure which vintage I sampled but I felt this beer was falling off and peaking already"
""
"Overall, this is a really nice barleywine that carries barrel aging that way I like it. The base beer is truly the showcase here. In my opinion, all too often, the barrel overwhelms and swallows the base beer in a bb barleywine. In this case, the base is the star and the barrel lays a gentle subtle layer the melds wonderfully. Not big, brash, or boozy. In fact, if this beer truly clocks in at 14%, it's a gem. Subtlety and grace, thy name is Great."
""
"This is a bold brew with a solid inclusion of alcohol. It is full bodied with a light level of carbonation. Super easy drinking for a big bold brew that isn't hiding it's abv level. It was well put together and enjoyable. I wouldnt mind having it again for comparison purposes with others in the style. It really isn't totally fair to make this comparison but considering the lack of availability and inflated asking price of this brew nowadays I'd much rather take some gratitude."
"Taste is a bit oxidized but still sweet and malty. Some diacetyl as well. Slight bitterness and a crisp finish, its quite tasty but a bit good."
""
""
""
"Overall, I absolutely loved this beer. It definitely lived up to the hype for me. They got such a great balance between the barrel and beer characters and both of them together were just awesome. The low carbonation, high abv combo really worked well for me as well. Extremely flavorful, smooth and relatively balanced beer. At it's size and strength it's definitely a sipping beer, but it lived up to it's name for me. It just may be a new favorite of the style for me."

"O: A very rich and potent barleywine. The low carbonation works very well with the strong flavors. Aside from the slight oxidation this beer would be near perfect. Thanks again Shawn!"
"O: Really drinkable, awesome flavors, balanced, and nicely integrated barrel. More barrel characteristics than some of the recent Alpine -bal releases (like BA Token), if you were wondering. Probably one of my favorite barleywines of the year."
"O - Really nice beer, wish it came in bigger bottles. No complaints on this one."
"O - A stunner from Alpine that I really enjoyed sipping on. The alcohol is nonexistent on the nose and palate, which boggles my mind. An excellent barley wine from the one of the best Hop-producing breweries out there...that says a lot. A must-try."
"D - A very good barrel-aged barleywine that doesn't quite crack the top tier for me. I'll revisit this when I drink my own bottle (generously sent by ArthurPendragon before his untimely demise). Alcohol is shockingly well-hidden, which makes this a very dangerous brew."
"I will be haunted by this beer the rest of my autumn and winter life."
"Bottle generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a golden reddish amber with no head and no lacing on the glass. The smell is glorious. The aroma is bursting with vanilla, coconut, caramel, some light alcohol, marshmallow as well as some bourbon. The initial taste is some sweet caramel followed by some oaky bourbon, marshmallow, toffee, and vanilla. All the flavors come together quite nicely. The finish has a slight alcohol burn, but nothing unexpected given the ABV. Medium-full body. No carbonation. It could use slightly more carbonation, but it is certainly amazing the way it is. Easily one of the best barley wines have had."
"Reviewed from notes, back in late June. On tap at brewery into 6oz tulip. No head whatsoever, but has a creamy egg-shell ring. Medium brown color with a grapefruit pink hue. Very refreshing on the nose with a 'great' amount of caramel malt, sweet and salty candies (butterscotch?), with a nice alcohol presence. Taste is very similar, alcohol didn't burn me that much, the caramel and grapefruit came out more. Mouthfeel was decent, a tad too much carbonation for my tastes, as I have always enjoyed smoother barleywines. Still, ABC comes through once again with another magnificent brew."
"O: One of ABC’s best offerings and one of my favorite beers ever! I love this stuff."
"Very happy I got to try this. Made a trip out today with the girlfriend just to get away from home and am pleasantly surprised to find they tapped a keg today."
"Highly recommended, and worth seeking out. This is what Kuhnhenn BBBW wants to be."
"o - Overall I thought this was an outstanding barrel aged barleywine; definitely up there as one of the best I've had. Amazing nose; up there with MoaS as one of my favorite barrel aged barleywines, and I'd love to get another bottle of it."
"Overall, about 4 oz of this beer is plenty enough for me. For a barleywine I was impressed, even flat. Probably won't put too much effort to find this again unless it's on tap."
"O- This is probably about the 6th or 7th serving I have had at the pub. 2 were 2005 and the rest 09, everytime I thought it would be the last time I had it for a long time and then when I walk in and see that name on the board I get giddy. My favorite barrel aged barleywine."
"O: A very interesting barleywine. I highly recommend it if you're a fan of this style."
"Thanks to Steve for this... Pours an ugly murky dark brown, a light tan watery head forms a ring, but that’s it... really wonderful dr pepper malts, reminds me of a Kuhnhenn bbbw... taste is not as successful as the nose, lots of dark fruits, raisins, but it finishes with lots of bourbon but its too hot and the bourbon tastes cheap... the feel is a touch to thin and little hot... wanted to love this but its a bit overrated"
"This is one bottle i'd really love to get a chance to try again."
"Overall- This is a very good beer. It is a bit of a sipper, but that is just fine by me. Every sip seems to get better as you go down the bottle. Too bad that Alpine doesn't distribute in this area. I have a feeling I may not get a chance to have another one. But I will be seeking this out. Thanks, Jason!! 4.5/5"
"O: My personal favorite of the night. A fantastic barleywine that should be able to stand up to any and all competition. I still have a bottle I’ll be looking at opening up next to the other BA barleywine’s I still have to taste. I expect it will look forward to the challenge. 4.5/5"
"Pours a fairly pretty light brown. Almost no he on this one. Smells super bourbon heavy. Tons of heavy oak and vanilla on the nose. Tastes thick and sweet. A touch of hops on the back. Lots of sweet maltiness with a nice oak on the tongue. The vanilla on the tongue is solid as well. Overall one of the best American barley wines aged in bourbon barrels I've ever had"
"O-this beer is nothing short of its namesake"
"O: A rather unique beer. Lots of complexity, yet still candy-like. I thoroughly enjoyed tasting this beer and hope to come across it again one day."
"O: This brew has a ton of flavor and a ton of complexity. My only complaint is that it is a little heavy on the boozy quality."
"I was excited that this beer might have some JD qualities too it, but not in that cheesy way like Friday's. The appearance of this beer is a touch hazy but maintains a nice amber color and actually for the first time in awhile is one of the BA barleywines that has a head on it. The aromatics of this particular beer are heavy with oak and vanilla, but rather mild on the bourbon aspects. This allows for the butterscotch and caramel which reign supreme on the palate of this beer, to come through in the nose as well. There is a background flavor that I actually love when I detect it in higher abv beers. Toasted marshmallow, some have said almond, but I'm sticking with my guns on this one. It really wraps up the flavor on this smooth drinking beer. Overall, this beer might get lost in a giant tasting like this one, but I guarantee, if you have a bottle all to yourself, you are truly not going to want to share it."
"Don'tcha just love the modest beers? This one pours a very lightly murky ruby-amber topped by a half-finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises toffee, graham crackers, light walnut, butterscotch, and a vague sense of alcohol. The taste brings in more of the tasty same, though the butterscotch and alcohol come through a bit more pronounced than before. The body is a stolid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice, very tasty b-wine. My only real criticism was that the barrels really didn't impart as much bourbon character as I'd hoped. Despite this, though, this comes through as one damn fine barleywine, straight up."
"O: One of the best American barleywines available."
"Overall, the most drinkable beer at this ABV. Alpine is one of my favorite breweries, and they killed it with this beer. After having it on tap last year, I had high hopes for the bottle and it delivered."
"This beer had way too much of a buttery toffee thing going on to be anything ""great."" Finish it off with a cheap whiskey barrel and this is what you get."
"The beer pours a rusty brown color into my Westvleteren chalice. There is a small head that rises up and fades to a ring. A lot of caramel notes with some toffee and oak that is nice. Quite a full body with carbonation that you can feel easily. For the high amount of alcohol it drinks quite easily and I would recommend this again."
"D - This one I really liked. It was a pleasure to try and share. It is totally a sipper but I may have drank this one faster because I liked it so much. A must try."
"The flavor matches both the aroma and the name of this beer--Great. Dusted chocolate becomes more pronounced, as does a big vanilla bourbon presence from the Jack Daniel's barrels. A bit green on the finish with some earthy hops and booze, as well as a hint of sherry and cardboard-like oxidation. Still, I'm guessing that this beer has held up fairly well, and the alcohol is nicely hidden for the ABV. Great is a slow sipper, and hopefully one I get a chance to sip again."
"Pours cherry brown with very little head comprised mostly of a thin white ring around the top. Smells of brown sugar, caramel, booze and a hint of hops. Smell is very strong, but good. It is quite sweet in the taste with a hint of vanilla. Enjoy this beer pretty warm as, straight out of the cellar, it finishes with the reminder of the flavor of ham, which is unappealing. The people I enjoyed this beer with called me crazy, but acknowledged that the smoky, brown sugar sweet finish my allude to some honey ham. Once the beer warmed more, I was completely able to get over this issue and really enjoyed the beer. It is very thick and heavy in the mouth with low carbonation, but disguises the ABV really shockingly well. The drinkability is not limited by alcohol flavor, but instead intensity and its thick body. Ultimately, I held this beer to the highest of standards because I thought when I acquired it that this might become my favorite barleywine ever. To that, it did not live up to. Is this a really good beer though? Heck yes."
"Glad to have the chance to try this one. Thanks Ryan! Pours amber brown wit a thin tan head. Nose has bourbon, oak, vanilla, sherry, caramel, toffee and malty pecans. Taste is a bit boozy, but barrles mellowed this out nicely. Full body, well carbonated. Should age well."
"D: My favorite of the three bourbon barrel-aged barleywines (I realized after the fact), I would definitely recommend this beer."
"The lead off for this beer is a medium body of malt sweetness and some bourbon comes into the picture in the early midpalate region. There is a nice caramel / toffee flavors that come from the bourbon and malt complementing each other and the finish is good with a moderate oakiness. The carbonation on the palate is low and the feel of the beer is creamy with a nice finish."
"-again, probably the most complex beer i had the entire beer week as far as total flavor notes involved. very glad to have had it. alpine is impressing me for sure"
"Drinkability: I didn't love this beer. The 14.0% is definitely here, affecting the appearance, and the carbonation level is a little low, even for a beer this chunky and chewy. That being said, there's a lot to like here, and I did enjoy it. The aroma was pretty fantastic, and the flavor profile pretty robust and complex. On the whole, it's a mixed bag, and I'm not sure it's worth the $10.99 that was on the cap ... though maybe it'd be different fresh. Gimme some bolder hop notes, a little more lift, and I think this one would be stellar ... essentially, give it to me fresh!"
"Pours a dark, impenetrable yet clear mahogany brown color with a quickly receding, initially two finger thick tan head. Unsurprisingly, the head isn't long for this world and leaves little trace behind. Aroma and flavor are both exceptionally sweet, overly complex and subtly balanced. The nose leads off with a strong boozy whisky and vanilla aroma with softer notes of figs, raisins, plums, brown sugar, caramel and sweet malts. Body is thick and lightly carbonated with a sweet, dry bourbon-y finish. A strong base of caramel, toffee and crisp malts supports the strong oak and woody flavors of the spirits and dark fruits. Incredibly smooth and balanced with surprisingly little alcohol heat throughout, despite the strong booze and spirit presence; this is an exceptional barrel aged beer."
"As an aside, I saw that this was aged in Jack Daniels barrels, and the label plainly styles this as a bourbon barrel barleywine. I've always been fascinated by the debate about Jack Daniels being Tennessee Whiskey, not bourbon. I digress...."
"4.0 D: This is a good beer, but it isn't nearly as good as the average score suggests. This doesn't hold a handle to 08 BA Old Ruffian or any vintage of CWBBBW. I'll put it on a similar level to Weyerbacher Insanity in terms of quality, with this being a hell of a lot bigger. I gave this a 4.0 to elevate the overall score a bit since I think the taste is right on the 3.5/4.0 border."
"D: Again, I'm still not a huge fan of barleywines but this, along with a couple of others are helping me to turn the corner. Infinitely rich and complex with a very enticing nose and feel. A very good representation of the style."
"2009 vintage on tap at Alpine. Caramel coloered with a small head that recedes to a thin crown. Aroma is amazing, rich caramelized malts wrapped in bourbon, oak and vanilla. Wonderfully oxidized, sherry like with a hint of savoriness. The palate is massively malty and rich. Flavors of butterscotch and bourbon are balanced by tannic oak. Oxidation lends notes of sherry and faint soy sauce. Full, almost syrupy body, yet this is surprisingly easy to drink and very balanced. This was very good from the bottle, but it's outstanding on tap. There's virtually no trace of alcohol, and the balance between beer and barrel is impeccable."
"Overall, an excellent bourbon barleywine. After a bunch of overpowered bourbon bombs, this one nailed it and showed what a ba-beer can be in the right hands. Another homerun from Alpine. Highly recommend if you can find it. Not avail here in TX so got from Milt. Rotation - lucky to get this one so this will probably be it. Would have again but only if sharing with some friends. [N;O]"
"D-Nice sipper."
"I've had this beer on three different occasions. The first was at Stone Oakquinox from a jockey box, and I thought it was the best thing there - I was bowled over by it. The second was both 2005 and 2009 versions at the brewpub, and I was let down - I recall there being a weird smell akin to cat food in the 2005, and the 2009 needed some time to round into form. I'd rate this most recent experience to be in between those prior ones. This is a good beer, but there are a number of other barrel-aged barleywines that are better, IMO. If you can get two bottles of Great, do it, and sit on one of them for about 10 years and see what happens to it."
"Alcohol is well hidden, but it is a heavy and somewhat palate crushing brew. A real treat that I was stoked to have the opportunity to try."
"D - I am glad I have another bottle to try in a year or so, hopefully the booze mellows a bit."
"EDIT, 2011: Though for some reason this beer keeps popping in my head. Perhaps I was too ""new"" to the style and reviewed it low die to my inexperience. Must try on my next visit to the brewery (if I can find it)."
"Best bourbon barrel aged barleywine I've ever had."
"Impression: Name of the beer says it all."
"Poured a deep dark brown with maroon highlights and a thin head that left good sticky lacing on the glass. The nose was very nice with big caramel and whiskey aromas from the oak. There were hints of vanilla, brown sugar, and booze that was not dominating the nose which was well hidden. Up front the taste was big on caramel and whiskey flavors with vanilla, toffee, and slight booze accetns. The beer was full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation that had a thick sweet syrupy and faint boozy finish. Apline came through with an exceptional barleywine style brew that was really drinkable and made me want to serve up more in my glass every time it was empty."
"An aptly named beer I'm very glad I got to try. Another winner from the Alpine folks."
"Wow. Top-notch, fantastic beer that deserves its rating. Possibly the most complex, deep, & robust BA Barleywines I've ever had, & wonderful to boot. My opinion of Alpine only continues to rise."
"D - It's pretty easy to drink, especially for the 14% ABV. I'll have to crack open a bottle soon to see how it's doing in there."
"A very barrel forward approach given the style which settles out to offer a port like quality and improving in complexity with warming."
"D: The booze is remarkably well hidden and it goes down way too easy."
"Overall a GREAT beer. Can't wait to get some bottles of this when it comes out again"
"12oz bottle which I was lucky enough to receive from my cousin, love that guy. I split this with two other friends because lets face it, its is strong as hell. My buddy said teh first whiff was like dog-food or rather a dog treat and it did remind me of snausages or soemthing. Luckily as it opened up it smelled like tootsie rolls, very nice and sweet. The flavor was pretty delicious like more chocolate and tootsie rolls, not much wood or spirits but it definitely had a kick of heat on the back end. Very nice barleywine but four ounces was plenty for me. Keep up the great work Alpine!"
"4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4"
"Poured from the bottle (with great anticipation) a deep garnet hue, with ruby highlights and absolutely no head. An absolutely huge and wonderful nose on this one, with the expected bourbon, along with vanilla, brown sugar and molasses. Flavors of bourbon, toffee, caramel, vanilla alcohol. Very syrupy and hot, with a somewhat cloying mouthfeel and a huge bourbon presence. A very good beer, one that could take some time in the bottle."
"Given the ABV this is a very drinkable beer, a top notch barleywine which I would like to drink more of in the future."
"Overall, a very solid bwine. It is big, smooth, and drinkable. Lots of flavor and the bourbon barrels really tied the beer together to make it complex, yet drinkable. I am glad I had a chance to try this one. Very solid."
"This would really be a quite expensive (and debatably a waste of this beer) marinade, but I think reducing this down a bit and using this as a marinade and/or barbecue glaze would on beef, steak tips especially, maybe chicken too would be absolutely amazing."
"Overall this is a world class beer in my opinion. Highly recommended."
"Pours murky brown with no head. The aroma is caramel, brown sugar, some alcohol, oak and bourbon. It is very sweet. The flavor is vanilla, maple, alcohol and brown sugar. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Notches darker than the norm...pour a deep mahogany amber color with a shallow off white head that fades quickly without leaving much lacing behind. The smell is unique aggressive and amazing! I'm overwhelmed by the complexity...initially comes across with that classic corny butterscotch then an intense maple syrup over Aunt Jemima Eggo waffles or the revelation that an easy way to kick up a pancake batter is to add a dash of vanilla extract follows. Light carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied with a creamy smooth texture and chewy character...Full flavored, the rich sweet characteristics of the nose are mirrored in taste and enhanced nicely by the body. Maple pancakes with vanilla accents and black licorice, caramel and dark fruit experience. It all lingers quite nicely. The 14% ABV is extremely well integrated. A booziness is present and expected, to some extent in this style. Highly recommended!"
"D: Very delicious. Not extremely complex, but just done so incredibly well."
"D - Very good. The alcohol is obvious but for its abv, it drinks very well. 3.5"
"D- This is a great sipping beer, I am glad I had to pleasure to try this. It has great complexity and is such a great beer, grab this while you can."
"D: This beer has indeed earned it's name. Quite a *great* beer that I'd love to have again. Yes, I know it was an awful joke."
"Drinkability is through the roof for a -bal aged beer of this strength. This was definitely best of show for me. Just incredible. Possibly the best barleywine I've ever had. I can't believe this beer isn't in the Top 100."
"Pours a clear caramel brown, not much of a head, just some lacing around the sides. The smell explodes with molasses, brown sugar, and whiskey. The taste is rich and sweet. Powdery sugar, and a sugary burnt marshmallow finish on the back of the palate. Although it's a comopletely different beer, the explosion of sweetness and the specific sugary aspect to this was SO similar in my mind to Black Tuesday. It was really amazing. For a sipping beer Alpine did a great job here."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy bodied with a very light carbonation, excellent."
"This was some pretty impressive stuff. Wonderful melding of flavors here between the beer & barrel; and the feel and drinkibility on this were pretty awesome for the size. I'd love to tuck a few more of these away for cellaring, as this is one that's only going to get even better with time."
"D: Massive ABV and a bit of a mouthfeel issue. Pretty damn tasty, though. If you're looking for a 'kick you in the teeth' beer, then this fits the bill very nicely. If you're looking for something complex and subtle... well this could still be for you because there is plenty to find, but the mouthfeel issues really hurt what they were trying to do and turn this from what could have been an absolutely stunning beer to a, still respectable, tasty treat."
"Dangerously drinkable, nice juicy/thick mouthfeel."
"The flavor is even richer than the aroma, if that can be believed. Big boozey bourbon notes are in communion with caramel, brown sugar cookies, butterscotch, toffee, molasses, vanilla, dates, figs, plums, and prunes. The combination of toffee and nuttiness is not unlike peanut brittle. Sherry-like oxidation is graceful. The alcohol is very well hidden in the bottle. I didn't find that to be the case with the draught version. Bow before this beast. I think 6oz would be a perfect serving size, and I have double the number before me. I definitely should have split this with another. This is very well done. Seek it out."
"Drinkability- Really freaking good Barleywine. But saying that, the 14% is rather noticeable after a while. I like how the beer is super intense and chocked full of caramel but not sweet. A little bit of time will definitely help things and now I wish I would have traded for two. Thanks much Jess!"
"Overall this is better then I could have hoped for. A superb version of a barrel aged barleywine. The vanilla and toffee notes from the barrel are perfect, mellow and subdued are the orginal hops from the beer, instead a sultry, sweet, and superb flavor have come forward. If every barrel aged beer I have is like this I would be a happy man."
"The aroma emanates maple, bourbon, booze, caramelized sugars, and a tad of peaty dryness. Pretty far out. Tastes of toffee, but not as sweet, peaty, slightly earthy. Finish has a full bitterness to it with a lingering bourbon and maple character. Yes, this one is big and boozy, but it is oh so good. Full in body, but maybe lighter than expected. Despite the lack of visible carbonation, there are plenty of tiny prickly bubbles to enhance the flavor. Very high quality example of the style. High drinkability for what it is, not quite perfect, but high. Good good stuff."
"D: This is really, really good. The barrel-aging is VERY subtle, and it hits the zone for me when it's at the upper range of the ""recommended"" drinking temperature. Lovely. I want more. It's pricey as hell at $11 a 12oz, but this may be one of the few beers where I think it's actually worth it, like a Hair of the Dog special release. [EDIT: I have been informed that this was $8 / 12oz at the release. That is well worth it, IMO.]"
"Ahhhh why I love English barley wines so much on top of that add bourbon barrel aging and you have one of the best beers I've tried in a long long while. A dessert style beer very sweet with mission fig, rum soaked rasins, caramel, date, currant, bourbon, vanilla, alcohol burn, a perfect tingly mouthfeel from a hint of carbonation that adds to the complexity. Slight oxidation and sherry quality. Christ this is good."
"Pours hazy garnet/brown in color with ample tan carbonation. Smells of bourbon, raisins, brown sugar, vanilla, and lots of toffee, among others. I like it, but the buttery toffee component is a little too much for my taste - reminds me a bit of Olde Bluehair's smell. Taste is outstanding - those same toffee, bourbon, raisin and brown sugar qualities are all quite strong, and blend together well. Not hoppy at all, this sits on the line where barleywines end and old ales begin. Mouthfeel is thick, sticky, coating, and well-supported by ample carbonation. At 14%, I was expecting to have difficulty drinking this, but those concerns proved unfounded."
"D: I look forward to trying this one again in a year. I split the bottle with someone else and that was fine by me"
"D - Oh, no, one is more than enough."
"Overall: If cellared correctly, this beer could age beautifully. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"Perhaps a cigar and a taster of this beer is in order!"
"I enjoyed this BA barleywine. The 14 % definitly limits how much I of this I would drink, but this is one of the more enjoyable barleywine I have had. Will try another bottle of great in a year or two."
"D- This was a decadent desert beer. I split the 12 oz and loved it but dont think I could drink much more than that."
"Decent consistency at mouthfeel. A bit watery for my taste, but still nice. Very well balanced flavors and body, with a great alcohol warming effect without being overtaken by this 14% beast. I was very impressed with this beer and would love to put this side by side with other barrel-aged barleywines. Something tells me time will improve this ""great"" beer, too."
"This feels like it could benefit from a few years and I am very excited to see how it matures!"
"375 ml bottle with gold foil courtesy of KingG, thanks again Joey for this treat, 2007 vintage, poured into my Rader snifter tonight, dark brownish red, 3/4 inch creamy light tan head, retention was around ten minutes which was suprising for a two year old barrel aged beer, some lacing at the top of the glass too, aroma consists of bourbon first, sweet malts including toffee and caramel, brown sugar, alcohol, prunes, biscuit, mild citrus, and oak, flavor starts off with a semi sweet vanilla flavor, sweetness along with some almost toasted malts in the middle that were much like the biscuit I could smell, some mild alcohol flavors in the finish but nothing like you would expect from a beer of this strength, also some oak and vanilla lingers in the aftertaste, more whiskey comes out as it warms, it tastes very Jack Daniel's like too, warms up with more malts coming to the surface but never really gets cloying or hot, sweet, warming, and malty mouthfeel, medium to full bodied, low to medium carbonation, taste lingers a long time, this beer is very smooth but almost syrupy, alcohol is hidden well for fourteen percent, it is a bit filling though, drank most of this bottle tonight and did not want anything else, I have wanted to try this beer for years and glad I finally got the chance, it certainly lived up to expectations and I am interested in seeing what the higher alcohol version batch two tastes like in the future, recommended"
"Thanks Dave you my friend are in fact GREAT... same goes for the beer."
"Yum..And thanks to Joey for the hook up..SD style."
"This is one for sipping all evening long, though the alcohol is fairly well-hidden given the ABV. A big, complex and damn tasty beer. Thanks again to Derek for this rarity."
"Re-rate on 10/29/07. Pours a clear copper to brown color with lasting thin tan head. The aroma is up in your face big and bold with the aroma of a oak paneled shed followed by sweet creamy caramel candy and some chocolate malts. It also has a sizable load of fruity esters with prunes, dates and a bucket of raisins. The alcohol is not all that well hidden for a 10% beer. But for this beers big ABV it isn't too bad. The flavor is just as bold as the aroma with a whack in the face by a freshly milled oak plank followed quickly by red wine grapes, red wine tannins mixed with rich caramel candy. The alcohol is there too. Nice. Another decade of age could see this good beer turn truly great."
"Pours a cola brown to amber in color, clear, with a small cream head that quickly recedes to a ring. Aromas are strong of the barrel ageing. Salty, a deep leatheriness, woodiness, and a good booziness are most prominent. There are sweet pruny malts in the background, more subdued under the effects of the barrel. Agitation reveals more of the deep leather, oak, and bourbon notes, you can almost smell the inside of a barrel. Taste is a flash of rich maltiness up front followed by the booziness, leather and grapes/raisins, and finishing oaky and dry, a boozy bite warms the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is medium, low carbonation keeps it somewhat slick, dry on the tongue in the aftertaste and warming. This is one of those beers for me where from the first smell I am taken in, my pen is writing furiously rather than searching for aromas and flavors. I'd love to try the good, i am sure it is an outstanding barleywine based on this sample. I hope that alpine produces this again in the future, outstanding beer."
"From the bottle at Spuyten Duyvil in Brooklyn, New York. Light bronze color. Unfortunately, it has a very mild nose overall, but it does show some barrel contribution (coconut, toasted oak, vanilla), very mild, piney aroma hops and a caramel laden malty aspect. Extremely well hidden alcohol, shockingly hidden beyond belief, quite honestly, yet it isnt quite as rich as I had hoped. Nice blending of butter toffeeish malt, with the barrel contribution quite profound, with toasted oak and vanilla flavors. Creamy, big full body, yet lacking in texture in a way. Still pretty delicious overall, although I did expect a bit more."
"I should have bought a case. This beer will be amazing in a few more years. A work of art and Pat McIlhenney deserves all the thanks. Given the time involved in making this $7.50 is a bargin. More!!"
"If you want to try a big sipper with some complexity, look no further, this is very big and very well done. My kind of beer!"
"Great is a perfect name for this beer. Oak barrel aged, notes of vanilla and bourbon come through in this barleywine. It is deep, dark with some red hues. Clear, no head. It is still available at the brewery so I don't know why it is retired but it soon will be since they said they didn't have much left. Very yummy beer."
"Dark brown, sparkly carbonation. Aroma is fruity, alchohol, bourbon, sweet, malty. Huge bourbon flavors took me by surprise, I was not expecting so much whiskey flavor. Followed by cereal malt flavor, and a strange vegetable kind of aftertaste, I couldn't place it. This beer is like drinking bourbon but without the alhoholic sting. A heavy powerful brew, syrupy and sweet. Very glad I shared the bottle with someone. Take your time and enjoy this one."
"D: Probably should have split this bad dog with someone. Becomes a bit cloying by the end of the bottle."
"This beer poured a clear, red-amber color with thin, tan colored foam. The smell was light bourbon with vanilla, caramel, and molasses, and some malt. The taste was malty with flavors of caramel, molasses, bourbon, vanilla, and a touch of alcohol. Very nice, rich flavors. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with medium-full body and low carbonation. The finish and aftertaste were filled with flavors of wood, malt, and alcohol. This was an excellent and quite enjoyable brew!"
"Taste is also very boubon like but with nice and smooth bitterness but high dosed. Overall well balanced but all tastecomponents double and extra; great beer to sip but be aware of the 14% as it still is quiet drinkable."
"I give a GREAT bighuge thanks to the GREAT Darren of LongBeach for the GREAT beer."
"This beer would make a poor session beer. It is way too high in alcohol to drink all night. Also, it is very aggressive. It would wear thin very quickly. As far as a single glass, this beer lives up to its name. It was great."
"This will put hair on your back. Whooooaaa this is like drinking a watered down bourbon whiskey. Add some oak barrel taste and you've got the great. mouthfeel was full and loaded with stinging alcohol. I love a good strong brew but this was a whiskey bomb at best."
"Cheers!"
"A seriously big ""MAHALO"" to AleOha for this guilty treat."
