"This is a good, standard barleywine, tasty.  Nothing unique."
""
""
"Pretty good not crazy hippy pretty balanced. Bomb with sticky toffee pudding."
"Overall:  bAlanced very well.  Not too hoppy, sweet, or boozey.  Like it."

"Just to clear my name with all the fans of this beer, I'm now opening another barley wine in the wake of Old Blarney disappointment:  Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barley Wine.  Oh, yeah.  That's the stuff."

"O: Definitely recommended. I'd love to try the barrel aged version."
""

"Old Blarney pours a reddish color with a small lacing head. There is a fruity, and dry like aroma. The taste is dry, with a dry fruity flavor, and a mellow malty sharpness. Very easy to drink good full body. Overall its a solid barleywine however a bit on the boring side."

"Overall: this is the first barley wine I have had, and the first thing that struck me is how similar it is to many beer styles; I almost expected it to be as dissimilar as spiced mead. I have to admit though, it is a fantastically thick, flavoursome and powerful beer style. I think I've found a new style to keenly watch out for."
""
""
""
"Too dry. No hoppiness left, which is fine, but the maltiness is not bragging. A passable barleywine."
""
""
""
""
" ~ This is a tasty brew with all the fine attributes I like in a barleywine. I recommend it."
""
""
""
""
"O: A pleasant barleywine, but nothing to rave about. I would have it again, and tentatively recommend it, but not above Hopsickle."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden brown with a smallish tan head that persists for bit before leaving spotty lace on the glass. Aromas of dark sugars and fruits with brown sugar, caramel, cherry, plum, and orange providing the bulk of the nose. The flavor is sweet with brown sugar and caramel and lots of rich juicy dark fruits. A touch of alcohol and a bit of earthy citrus hops provide a nice balance to mix. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet fruity slick mouthfeel. This a very nice barleywine, its very smooth and tasty, I'm surprised its flown so far under the radar until now."

"This is a solid beer with solid flavor. It's rich, sweet, bitter, and a tad boozy. I enjoyed it, but I did wish it was a bit more malt with some caramel. With all the Barleywines out there, I'm not sure I'll be having this again."
""
"A basic American Barleywine. Uninteresting on the whole and the bitterness is a bit harsh."
"Pours a very hazy ruby red color with a hint of brown to it. Small off-white head. Scent is very sweet. Dark fruits and a bit of alcohol. Slight toffee and brown sugar. Taste is initially alcohol with lovely, sweet dark fruits. A lot of raisin and prune. A good amount of caramel malt with some burnt molasses flavors. Not overly boozy like some of the reviews stated...maybe this is an older bottle. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied...a little thin for this style. Drinkability is fairly high, somewhat well-balanced. Overall, this is nowhere near one of my favorite barleywines, but it isn't a bad one by any means."
""
""
""
""
"Thin mouthfeel upfront, with some abv% warmth. Some toasty figs, light caramelized prunes, sweet biscuit crust, and maybe some sweet plums. But keep in mind there's a strong underliying abv% presence in the flavor and mouthfeel. The palate is thin and warm. This is not a bad sipper. Keep in mind, I've been holding on to this beer for over a year, and this American barleywine is a bit too harsh. I will not buy again."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being on the lower side. Overall, I thought it was a very good version of the style. I really liked that even though it's an American version the malts still seemed like the star of the show. Very enjoyable beer to sip on this afternoon."
""
""
""
"DOA"
""
"Pretty classic barleywine. Not to my tastes but it's well made."
""
"O: The flavors and aroma of the beer are decent, but they are lacking a bit in comparison to other Barleywines out there. This beer is a deviation from the normal hop heavy and sweet American Barleywines. It is on more of a sessionable level due to this....makes it rather dangerous."
""

"almost more like an imperial irish red than a barleywine. pours a hazy dark red color with a decent white head. smells like an irish red, with a lot of dusty amber malts and a dry yeast variety. flavor is similar, but with just a hint of alcoholic sweetness characteristic of a barleywine. i would never ever guess this beer was ten percent. ever. mouthfeel is really weird, its almost flat. not from lack of carbonation exactly, but from lack of change from start to finish. it just sort of sits there doing nothing. i dont know, its not right in a way. almost dull in the mouth, but strong burn when you hold it in. hard to explain. overall a cool brew, but not a barleywine as i conceptualize them"
"Overall, this was an above average beer but a par barleywine. I like the style but the flavors were off and it made for an odd tasting beer. This beer gets points for being a smooth 10% barleywine but other than that, there are many others I'd rather drink before I would revisit this one."
"A delicious barleywine that is just a bit to hoppy for me to love, but it is an American BW afterall, so I'm not surprised. For the style, excellent. My personal preference is still more for the English variety, but this is still worth trying and I'll enjoy every last drop. A definite sipper though."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, because I love the style. Nothing amazing, just a solid, textbook barleywine."
""
"This drinks super easy. It's not overly complex but it didn't have to be. Just a well rounded straight-forward Barleywine. Not sure how old this is but seems to have a little age on it. Big malt, plenty of yeast, and a nice citrus hop flavor."
""
""
"d) A balanced & rewarding drink. Plenty of interest here."
"O - I've always enjoyed this beer, it's a solid barley wine."
""
""
"O: Since Moylan's has no dates on their bottles I'm wondering how old this, since it has some characteristics of 1 to 2 year old barleywine. But I believe this is it probably at its best so I will review it as such. This is a beer I had a long time ago, probably '05 and haven't had since so I wanted to revisit it. Great barleywine and at under $6 a bomber a real bargain this day and age. Really good."
""
""
"overall - average at best."
""
""
"Overall-This beers been sitting in my closet for a long ass time and I felt like a Barleywine, I will not be finishing this whole bomber, pass."
""
""
"Overall even though it was a steal at 5 dollars a bomber it was about as tasty as ""Killer Penguin"" from Boulder. Can't impress anyone with a lackluster barleywine."
"Pours a clear dark iced tea color with a 1 inch puffy beige head that fades to film. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is almost non-existent with maybe some malt aromas. Taste is non-existent too. The taste is also super weak like alcohol mixed with water and barely any malt flavors. This beer has a decent level of carbonation but seems a bit on the flatter side. Overall, this is a bad beer with an extremely weak smell and taste. I really hope this is a bad bottle because I am very disappointed with this beer."
"Overall: Old Blarney is a barleywine blended up with a good degree of bitterness. It's a decent brew. Not great, but good."
"Notes: Another good quality offering from Moylan's. a bit too compact and repetitive but all in all in a rather pleasing way. I would not mind having a couple of bottles picking up some time."
"I think I have had this bottle for about a year and I am glad I opened it now as this is a fairly mellow BW that doesn't need tons of aging. The beer is on the softer side with the hops in place but mellowed in time. I found all the right BW flavours here but in a muted form which increased the drinkability but decreased the complexity. Not among the best American BWs but nothing really off putting other than bigger flavours needed."
"O - Standard barleywine. Semi-sweet. Weird carbonation but didn't take away too much. Maybe some age would help out but decent enough."
"This is a very easy beer to drink with a nice creamy mouth feel. Alcohol was not very noticable despite the high ABV."
"Opinion: Overall this is a really good example of an American Barley Wine. I like the blending of the hops to go with the rather typical malt bill. Though the hops are a strong player in the flavor, they only modestly dominate in the finish, aside from what a lot of brewers think...that if they make their IBUs over double the OG, they are making a Barley Wine. No, you are making hop extract with malt and alcohol in it. This beer is well crafted and I would put it up on my list of favorite American Barley Wines, no doubt. I would definitely give this beer a try...regardless of what beer you are into...you will probably like this beer."
"Good carbonation, could be toned down a bit though. Not horrible, but I have to take this one slow."
"Moylans- Bugger off."
"OVERALL: After debating between two Barleywines for dessert I am very happy we went this direction. It was an excellent choice to finish off a fantastic meal."
"o: Overall this is a very well crafted example of my favorite style. If it were in small bottles with a date stamp, this could become a regular in my cellar."
"Pours a slightly hazy coppery reddish orangish color with a two finger off white brownish head, which recedes to skim. There is some good lacing left on the glass. The aroma is of caramel, dark fruits mainly raisin, pepper, and molasses. The taste has a caramel malt backbone with a big molasses and raisin/date taste along with a hint of tea. There wasn't much if any of a hop presence, and the dark fruits tended to dominate. The mouthfeel was creamy and slick with a nice alcohol feel. The drinkability is average, it is an okay barleywine but not the best in class. It was an okay drink, I took down the bottle but didn't really desire any more than that."
"Overall - Another excellent US barley wine... definitely recommended..."
"- Dangerous... balanced, and good. Why I don't see this barleywine mentioned among others I hear too often... I don't know. A great barley, and one I wish were local so I could always have a few around."
"Appearance is a see through dark brown with an off white healthy head leaving a light lace. Smell has a weak aroma of lightly roasted malts and dark fruits. Taste has a sweet roasted malt richness with a good balance of hops leaving a roasted bitterness in the end. Mouthfeel is heavy viscous with good carbonation. I've had better, but still not bad for a nice winter warmer."
"D: Not a bad beer at all, but there's not too much about it that is interesting either. No real reason to come back to this one with so many other good barleywines out there."
"D - Rather bold, not sure I could handle more than one bomber, but really good all around, I am pleased!"
"D: If you like American barleywines, this one is worth checking out. Drinkable."
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good high-octane beer that seems to have benefited greatly from age."
"Compared to the 2008 version which I really liked this was a bit disappointing. Similar overall but less intense, less fruity, less vanilla."
"D - Hides the 10% well, but the sweetness makes this hard to choke down after a while."
"I woulnd't seek this out, but its worth a try."
"Pours a somewhat murky, medium-brown color, with ruby highlights and about an inch or ecru foam, which quickly recedes to the sides of the glass, leaving a slick with bubbles across the top. Some hop in the nose, along with some dark fruits, plums and brown sugar. On the palate, this one is more malty, with caramel, brown sugar and some hops and alcohol on the finish."
"As said, I'll bet this would do even better with some aging. I guess here's where I make another plea for mandatory ""bottled on"" dating. Would be a great help to us beer consumers who give a crap about those kinds of things. As with all Moylan's stuff I've had so far, I'd definitely buy this again."
"Have yet to be let down by Moylans, yet not blown away either. Prefer this over the Smutty I recently had."
"A little one-note, and surprisingly dry - but worth a try if you're in the mood for a slightly different take on the style."
"Overall: I am very surprised by the lack of aeromatics in this beer. With everything you'd expect in a Barleywine this one does lack aroma. Malt texture and flavor are good with a strong backing of alcohol and hop bitterness. Step up the malt complexity and give me something to smell and I think we'd have an even better example of the style.     "
"Overall, and for the price, quite a good barleywine. 10%abv is well balanced. This beer won't blow you away, but won't waste your money either."
"Overall I thought this was a solid barleywine but I was hoping for a bit more after being a very big fan of Moylan's other beers. Nothing exceptional but nothing bad, worth a shot."
"I'm usually up for trying barleywines, this one is very dry and seemingly low in malt balance. Almost makes me think of a ""brown"" IPA with its thin body. Not too good."
"Overall: Not too bad, but not great either. I can't say I would recommend buying a 22oz and trying to finish yourself. It's not quite that drinkable. On the other hand, if you have friends to share it with, or the opportunity to have a sample, then I would recommend."
"Drinkability: This is a damn good barleywine. One 22 is more than enough for now, but I'd be happy to have it again, or age one."
"D: Everything is well balanced. Goes down well."
"Sheets of tan lace stick behind after drinking this orange-brown brew. Sticky citric and herbal aroma which is strong but nothing special. The flavor is all of that but really herbal besides. Citric zest up front yields to pine resin and peppery herbs. Mouthfeel is middle of the road, a little sticky and full, but relatively easy to drink. Not bad. Boozy. Too hot to be really drinkable, but all the right notes are there."
"Despite bringing a little heat, this is a pretty easy beer to go to town on, not bad at all, check it out."
"The drink is silky-smooth and luxuriously full-bodied with near-perfect carbonation. An excellent sipper."
"Nice malt base - typical caramel, bread, raisin along with a nutty/earth note, touch of spiciness, dryer than your typical barleywine, not as sweet and rich. Citrus zings through the finish, though it suffers in my palate due to the Hopsickle before it. Still, it's there and providing a nice bite to the finish. Mellow, not decadent mouthfeel, ABV well hidden - actually pretty drinkable for the style. Quite enjoyed this actually, Moylan's puts out some pretty darn good, under rated stuff. Thanks again Rob!"
"This is a decent barleywine. Nothing too special, and not one I'd hunt down again, but I'm glad that I had the opportunity to try it. Cheers to Volo for bringing Moylan's into Ontario."
"22oz bottle into a Duvel snifter pours a murky dark brown with a thin khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is loads of burnt caramel and toast up front with slight bitter hops present in the background. The taste is loads of sweet caramel malts with slight brown sugar, dried fruits and hints of molasses. The hops are relegated to the background, but provide a nice bitter pine backbone to the lingering sweet finish. The beer is certainly on the heavy side and its 10% abv shows up, but its not TOO aggressive, this is a sipper for sure. I must say, this one certainly seems like it will get much better as it ages, but it is still pretty tasty right now."
"Notes: I've been impressed with every Moylan's beer I've had, and this is no exception. I wish I could have experienced this one fresh to know how the flavors have changed. But at an estimated age of only one year, the flavors taste great and the 10% ABV is not abrasive or overwhelming. I enjoyed this sipper quite a bit! Recommended"
"Not bad at all. Kind of a mix between an English and American Barleywine. It doesn't quit work for me, but still worth a try."
"on the lighter side of full-bodied, but well carbonated for its body. the drinkability is great, and two bombers is certainly not out of reach."
"A very good brew, even if the style is a little erratic. A must try for barleywine lovers."
"This would be more drinkable if the lingering taste was not so hot. Initially drinkable but the longering hot alcohol ruins the experience."
"Mouthfeel full bodied, chewy, syrupy, and a sweetness lingering."
"Beer poured a deep copper with a nice long lasting off white head. Nose is malts, west coast hops, and some dark fruit. Taste is good, somewhat sweet malts, some dark fruit, and a muted piney bitterness finish. Mouthfeel is good, medium to full bodied brew is nice and chewy on the palate. Overall drinkability is good. This is an easy sipping enjoyable brew that is not overpowering. It is somewhat different from others in the style, perhaps because of the resinous finish. Definitely worth a shot!"
"Nothing earth shattering here, but this is still a very nice BW from Moylan. I'm guessing the 3 years of aging have probably not hurt it one bit. Frankly, this BW tastes like it could easily handle and benefit from another 3."
"O - This is maybe one of the most drinkable barley's I've had. Finishing some barley bombers can be a laboring task but not this one. If you like your barleys more on the English side this one is for you."
"D: Drinkability score goes way up with the value on this bad brew. High ABV, but it serves to accent more than dominate. Another really, really good Moylan's offering at a great price. An unsung CA brewery with excellently-crafter beer."
"J"
"Color is dark brown with some cherry red hues. A nice sized tan head quickly fades leaving minimal lacing behind. A strong chocolate aroma initially rises to the nose, quickly followed by some sweet cherries, caramel malts and a woodsy essence. On the palate the sweet malts and hops duke it out immediately with some more dark chocolates stepping in and breaking things up. Some mellow earthiness and more dark fruits exist. A noticeable alcohol heat seeps through after a few sips. Halfway through the glass and I start to realize that this is not a completely concerted effort, as many of the elements seem to jockey for position, rather than work together. That being said, this is a fairly well-intentioned Barleywine that could use a few tweaks here and there, but remains pretty damn satisfying as is."
"Will have to buy another bottle of this and see how it ages, my guess is when the hop bitterness fades a tad the malt will really start to shine through."
"I have had this numerous times and each time I try to like it more and more, but for some reason it never happens."
"Pours a red colored body, clear, with a foamy off-white head. Diminishing. Hoppy bitter sweet malty aroma. Some dustiness and some syrupyness. Some sweet dusty maltiness. Some roasted malt tastiness. Not too strong or overpowering a flavor. Very dusty tasting."
"Had this one with some stilton and fig-cinnamon chutney on sourdough. Delicious once it warmed up."
"An enjoyable barleywine from Moylan's. This is a beer made for sharing with a partner, not that one person can't enjoy this over a long night."
"Cheap. Standard. Not extraordinary, but by no means bad at all. There certainly are better."
"Flavors are decent but not very easy to drink, maybe would improve with some age."
"Overall: I like pretty much every offering I've had from Moylan's and this one did not disappoint. A solid barley wine that has a little something different going on than most. Worth a shot."
"Smooth silky mouthfeel that just seem to slide down your gullet."
"Sure the bar for ultra hoppy high gravity ales is set pretty high in California, but this sample might fail to even qualify in preliminaries (simply a reflection of tough competition). Nothing from Moylan's has ever wowed me but I know they make more solid beers than this. Not to give the impression that I didn't like the Old Blarney - I certainly did - but if you have the Golden State's full repertoire at your fingertips than there's no need to grab this one first."
"Not really drinkable in my opinion - I thought my first attempt at drinking this barleywine may have been a spoiled batch or over-hopped but twice in a row left me feeling none too pleased. This barleywine just isnt for me."
"Notes: I'm not that impressed with Moylan's at all. Doesn't Marin contract brew through them? Why are their beers so awesome?"
"Pours reddish brown with an oily head. Viscous-looking. The aroma is awful, like a malty low-tide. The taste more than makes up for it. Heavy and sweet with malts and caramel. The hops eventually fight through in the end. Overall, it tastes like this beer should be aged before bottled."
"All that comes to my nose is a thick caramel malt. Smells like concentrate of malt. The taste however, is a bit more pleasing, but malt driven. Sweet, rich malty intro, with caramel, toffee, tobacco and then some serious bittering hops, piney and citric. The balance is ok, leaning to the malt, as the aftertaste is a tongue coated malty syrup. The carbonation helps disperse the flavors of this viscous, chewy brew. The 10% ABV does the rest, making this big malty brew quite drinkable. I enjoy this type of BW now and then, but prefer the hoppier balance of the SN Bigfoot. None the less, enjoyable."
"Purchased in La Mesa, CA at BevMo 10/06. Seems a bit past it's prime. 22 oz bomber poured slightly hazy copper to red/orange and had a fluffy light tan head. The aroma was of sweet caramel, dark fruit, a bit of yeast and sweet pine hops. The flavor is similar to the aroma with caramel and chocolate maltiness, dark fruit and a soft muted pine hoppiness. It sure doesn't seem like a 10 ABV beer. No sense of the alcohol."
"Overall a good barleywine. Heavy on hops but a strong amount of sweetness."
"D - This is fairly easy drinking for me. The taste may be mild but there is enough complexity towards my flavors of interest that I won't get bored anytime soon. A very good beer at a nice price that I will be having again and again."
"Overall, this is an unbalanced mess. It mellows out as I drink though. I managed to finish the bomber."
"D- Easy to drink, the alcohol is well hidden."
"The taste strong with burnt caramel but the malt seems to have almost nothing else. The hops totally overpower this with a sharp, rough bitterness that rides roughshod over the tounge and everywhere else, leaving behind a rough feeling and little taste except for a sharp pine-grapefruit rind bitterness. It's boring and rough."
"D: Overall not bad but perhaps this would be better with some age on it. The hops while interesting take away from the rest of this beer. 6 months in the cellar would do this well."
"... booyaa!! i love my day off!!"
"The smell was really underwhelming. Got some hop aroma but all was very faint. The taste was caramel malts and good spiciness. You could taste a little hop bitterness on the way out. In the mouth it was dry, alcohol was really present and you were left with a real burnt caramel on the finish. Overall a middle of the road barley wine."
"I had a hard time finishing this beer, and would have a hard time spending the money on another bottle."
"I still have trouble sometimes telling the difference between these hopped up barley wines and DIPAs. I guess DIPAs should have a lower final gravity or something. Does that make them a Barleywine Lite? Anyway this is a great beer. Light red colour with a nice big head. Good retention with nice, sticky lace. Aroma is at eleven. Big piney, citrusy hops with a toffee like malt aroma as well. Tastes much the same with the addition of smooth bitterness and a touch of alchohol. Suprisingly this beer isnt that boozy for the strength. At ten percent it is dangerously drinkable. Really good beer from a really good brewery."
"D - I was more apprehensive than I needed to be about this beer. Maybe the style scared me off. Not boozy like many barley wines. Almost too easy to drink. Really recommend this one."
"The body is moderate to big. Would have like to see more. This is a beer that would probably be best if aged. The alcohol notes and the oxidation both would back off and leave a nice finish. Only one way to try that though, see you in a few years."
"Dark orange-brown color, clear. Aromas of booze, nail polish/acetone, dark fruit. Leather and tobacco flavors, ash, cheap chocolate, not really what I was expecting. This is totally different than any barleywine I've ever had and I'm not sure i like it."
"D- wonderful barleywine, great flavors, complexity and balance, highly recommended"
"Overall not bad, but really quite forgettable. I have had much better barley wines, and this came in good, don't get me wrong, but I was really looking for a little bit more out of it. Still though more then a solid call and something I would not mind going back to again."
"This pours a cloudy dark amber and has a creamy tan head. Nice lacing. The nose has a pleasant mixture of floral hops, candy and fruity malts. The taste is also very good. Well balanced with a full body. A bitter base with sweet bready malts poking through."
"-Oelergud"
"Poured a brown color with a small tan head. Nose was weak but it did have dried fruits, brown sugar. The ABV is very well disguised. The dried fruits/raisins are very prominent here. Not much of a malt backbone. Brown sugar with some good caramel malt. Since the ABV was well disguised and the overall taste is good I give the drinkability a good grade. It is nothing to write home about and better at room temp."
"Notes: At times it reminded me more of a Strong Ale -- a la Arrogant Bastard -- than a Barleywine. Worth checking out."
"Clear burnt orange, nearly reddish, with a frothy light beige cap composed of fine bubbles. Chunky, sticky lacing and good head retention. I could smell the hops as soon as I opened the bottle. After pouring, the hops were still there - lots of grapefruit, pithy and juicy, with a little pine. There was a fair bit of caramel in there too. Moderate bitterness with a ton of malty caramel kicked things off. There was a bit of juice and spicy alcohol in the middle. Grapefruit rind and citrus oil bitterness really punched through at the end and lingered forever for a really intense finish. Lightly warming with a full body that was creamy and chewy. Carbonation was just on the low side, giving it a rich, smooth texture. Definitely a powerful brew, particularly in the finish. It satisfied the hop head in me and left my tongue bruised and battered. Delicious!"
"A nice treat. Flavor is rich, complex, and full bodied. Alcohol is noticable, but not unpleasant. Dangerously easy to drink."
"Drinkability is pretty good, definitely unusual and interesting, though the flavor my not be everyone's cup as tea, as it's definitely not classic. Good enough for me to have at least 2 or 3 bombers this winter, with plenty of other BWs waiting for me in the cellar!"
"Pours a light maroonish to dark amber color. Short lived thin beige head atop. Smell is mostly malty, mild with notes of lightly alcoholic caramel. Mild, underwhelming nose. Taste is moderately hopped with very light, and bright flavor of caramel and somewhat plain bittering hoppiness. I didn't get any citrusy or fruity qualities to the hops at all. Drinkable and smooth with a medium body and normal carbonation. Alcohol is nicely held in check for 10%, I thought. Not outstanding, but I didn't have any trouble finishing my share."
"Drinkability: This is such a rich, complex, and easy-going brew, especially when it warms to room temperature, but there's that bitterness I can't put my finger on. This will certainly be a bottle I'll get to cellar if I can, but it's certainly worth checking out, and I'm glad I did. As I said before, I'll be trying as many of Moylan's brews as I can get my hands on."
"D: Solidly constructed, easy drinking and tasty barleywine a solid choice."
"D- Extremely easy to drink for such a potent brew; the alcohol is well disguised beneath layers of delicious, complex flavors."
"georgeous hazy reddsish brown with orange-amber highlights. yellowish tan head that holds well and leaves nice lace. caramel, sweet bread and fruity hop in the nose. wish it was stronger in that department, because what i'm smelling is very nice. taste is hoppier than expected with a bit of mint and pine in the finish. great medium full body. nice and smooth and velvety. couldn't drink this all night, but i certainly enjoyed it. another quality brew from moylan's."
"Excellent."
"A great effort by Moylan!"
"D - Alright. The taste is mediocre, but the rest is nice."
"Although very alcoholic, I'd say this is a very drinkable beer and a fantastic find."
"Drinks a little slow, but If you like your Barley Wines big & hoppy, this is your huckleberry"
"Pours a hazy copper, thin tan head forms, drops to a solid layer, leaves behind some solid lace rings. Smell is nice, caramel and bread, floral, dark fruits, raisins, alcohol, bit of grapefruit, well balanced aroma. Taste is bread and toffee, raisins, brown sugar, sweet malty middle, grapefruit and floral, oats, alcohol, very clean malts, balanced hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with slick low carbonation, pretty smooth, warmth from the alcohol. Standard American barleywine, doesn't stand out from the crowd but I would be happy to have this as a regular beer. Thanks Russ!"
"Pours a hazy classic tea hued amber with a big pale foamy yellow head that resists fading and settles as an ice cream float, leaving gobs of Belgian lacing in it's wake, some 3D. The Smell is really good. Sweet creamy caramel malt, a touch of molasses and cinnamon. The nose suggests a rich texture and the mouth doesn't disappoint. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is moderately heavy, a tad lighter than some. Being slightly lighter, there is less of a lingering sense of richness. The flavor is similar to the nose. No surprises and that's a good thing. The 10% ABV is warming to the chest, but well integrated otherwise, making it very drinkable. Enjoying this one! Highly Recommended."
"Finish is nice, not bad on after taste, really nice body. Alcohol and bubbles are just right for a 10%er, really drinkable, granted, 1 bottle is more than enough..."
"D - Both sweet and hoppy bitter that never quite blends together as well as I would like. Still a tasty beer."
"Overall: Another fine offering by Moylan's. They are a lesser known west coast brewer in most parts. Their beer is very good though and should be sought out."
"Full bodied with a soft carbonation, the mouthfeel after swallowing is not thick, as might be expected, but silky. Some sessions are hit, some miss. But always we demand the heart and soul of our brewmasters. Then we kneel before them when they give it to us."
"drinkability is good. balanced and nice. not quite as bold as i'd expect, but still very good."
"All in all a freaking amazing beer..."
"Not to bad, a bit on the bitter and hoppy side this fresh will be interesting to revisit after a couple years."
"Notes - A quality barleywine from a fairly consistent brewery. Worth trying, especially for the price."
"D: While at 10% ABV no discernable alcohol in tasting. Big taste that commands that it be savored and enjoyed. Would recommend as it a nice beer that I will purchase again, but drink one at a time."
"Overall, the drinkability was above average. Not quite good for me. It is a case of being too much on the hoppy side of fine. This tended to lessen the relaxed enjoyment potential."
"A decent beer if I close my eyes."
"Pours a dark redish brown with a nice thick rocky tan head. Spicy hop aroma with a initial roasted? malt flavor coming through with the first sip. Finishes with a slight hop bitterness. Malt and hops are balanced-at 10% the malt and hops are balanced well. This beer is dangerous as the drinkability is high-very high."
"Drinkability: From what I've read.... Barleywines are sippers... I would agree.... I finished the bomber.... but have no desire to have another right away.... This is a good beer. Just not one that you'll have more than one of in any one sitting."
"Moylan's brews a whole slew of good beer. I'm happy to report that Old Blarney Barleywine Style Ale is among their best. A fresh bomber might be too much of an alcohol bomb, so I'm glad I cracked the crown on this bottle when I did. If you like barleywines and don't suffer from poor impulse control, cellar a few of these beauties and then reap your reward."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel has a solid medium body. This is a very nice evening sipper. Very enjoyable!"
"All in all a pretty good beer from Moylans, but not quite up to par with their IPA's. Give it a try if you are into Barley Wine's."
"This is probably one for aging a bit. Might clear up and will definitely come more into balance as the hops blend in."
"D - Very drinkable for a ten percent barley wine. The hops are a little over the top to keep a very drinkable balance. Decent, but not one of my favorite barley wines."
"In sum, this is a big ass beer, a lot to contemplate, lots going on here, and a damn fine example of the style. I've had a couple Moylan beers before, and this one of their best so far."
"Mouthfeel is moderate; light and a tad watery. Not very much carbonation, but this works well with this style as it lends to its ""wine"" side. Drinkability is excellent. Another great brew from Moylan's."
"On-tap at Port Carlsbad Pizza Port. Taste great on-tap for a barleywine. Reddish amber with white crowning head. White lace. Hoppy all the way through. Meal in a bottle not requiring food. Noteable yeastiness. Good carbonation, Well malted and Balanced.Medium mouthfeel."
"Cheers."
"D: More of a sipping beer (though most of this style are), the alcohol is definitely present, though it does warm me up quite a bit on this semi-chilly southern California evening. Overall it's definitely a Moylan's brew, and hat's off to them it's a pretty good offering."
"I really enjoyed this one. Warming and cozy barleywine. A sipper. All around solid and more balanced than many. Very nice."
"Somewhat muddy in appearance. Hazy, orangish hue to it. No real head to speak of. Muted aroma-somewhat winey and musty. Tinge of alcohol. Dry and earthy flavors dominate. Lacks the burst of hops and sweet malt that I come to expect from a US version-especially a west coast barleywine. More winey and oxidized then anything. mouthfeel is ok-nothing to rave about. A rather ho hum version of a US barleywine. I have had better and better from this brewery."
"A very good barleywine here. It has a nice mouthfeel with good carbonation. A wonderful blend of hop characters and fruit flavors with a mild yet easily-noticeable malt presence. Definitely recommended for the lover of stronger ales."
"Pours a deep rich clear ruby with a giant head. The head lasts forever leaving great lacing. The smell is strong with dark fruit, alcohol and bread yeast. The taste is rich and creamy with hops, dark fruit, and a ""bisquity"" flavor. A b/w with more hops than other's. Not bad,but different. The m/f is heavy with all flavors mixing well. A good beer,maybe too hoppy,but still worth a try."
"Originally reviewed on May 4, 2006. 22 Oz Bottle. Clear ruddied sienna poour, with a tan foam head. All I can reach out of the aroma is a distant waft of an Ecto Cooler juice box, seriously. I would have scored much lower on aroma, if it hadnt been a memory evoker of my Ghostbuster days. Flavor is a week, dusky sweet malt, with caramel and bananas, then a fairly strong rush of hops, but they dont really play the role they should, for me at least. Theyre distant and amalgamated into a consistent one dimensional hop presentation, mostly in a lemongrasseqsue style. Smack of lemon zest. Palate seems heavily watery to me, but I will admit that it seemed to hide the alcohol extremely well, especially for a 10% that doesnt seem to have too much depth. Some toffee lingers."
"First Moylans that I ever had, wil ltry other styles, if I can find them."
"Pours a nice dark cherry, minimal head with some lacing. Smell is a combination of plums, raising and cherries...very inviting. Taste is malty onthe front wiith light fruit undertones and a distinct hop presence. Mouthfeel was surprisingly light for such a high abv... a pleasant surprise. Drinkability overall was fine with distinct tartness on the finish."
"Absolutely one of the best American Barely wines out there."
"Drinkability: A nice barleywine, although not as bitter as it could be. Enjoyable."
"Pours a clear clean darkish amber color, some carbonation, tiny head, not much lacing afterwards. Scents of sweet malts, hops, and caramel. The taste is sweet and malty, and pretty hoppy, there's is a nice caramel taste as well. Medium body, a nicely blended brew, well rounded, alcohol is hidden very well. Very drinkable, a nice brew from Moylan's, pretty underratate brewery."
"D- I really like this and I will probably be picking up another bottle. Just ashame that the body is to thin or this would be a really good brew."
"A darker Barley Wine in terms of flavor; more tame than most. This one is still a sipping brew though, as the 10% abv is felt from beginning to end."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a nice burgundy color ale with an above average foamy head with good retention. Aroma of sweet malt and some powerful hops. Taste has some caramel malt with some sweetness reminiscent of plums with an aftertaste that has some citrusy hops. Body is a bit too light for the style IMHO and alcohol was well hidden. Not bad overall but I generally like my barleywine to be more malt base then a hoppy affair."
"Mouthfeel's a little thin for style, I want it to be bigger. Drinkability's good for a 10% ABV Barleywine, I'm not opposed to another one :)"
"D: Definitely drinkable, but there are much better barleywines out there. However, a bomber of barleywine for $4 is quite the deal, and may influence me to have this one again."
"Drinkability: Definitely an after dinner slow sipper. I dont imagine too many barley wines score high in this category; however, this one could stand to work on smoothing out some of the malts and alcohol. Maybe some time at cellar temps could mellow it out. Traditionally, Moylans isnt too shy with the hops, so its surprising this one doesnt have more hop character. Not a bad beer, but needs some improvement."
"Taste is a bit milder than other Barleywines I have tried. It is certainly not unpleasant though. Just a bit muted... a bit hoppy and alcoholic upfront, with a hint of sweetness on the finish."
"M&D - decent mouthfeel, smooth, but not like a barleywine, needs more sweetness in the balance to make it more drinkable"
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with a chewy texture like an oatmeal raisin cookie. Tight carbonation rolls the flavors across your palate with creamy smoothness. A great American Barleywine."
"Very rich and robust. I luv BWs with a sour mash bourbon barrel tang, not one with a oak barrel wood flavor. The 10%abv is well hidden, a fairly smooth brew."
"Starts off with a nut brown sensation, that is quickly supplanted with the heady sweet/alcohol combination typical of a barleywine. Mouthfeel is syrupy smooth.	 As the beer warms in the mouth flavors of ripe tropical fruits appear. A nice representative of the style, but not as exceptional as Moylan's other brews."
"Beer is good. Happy big bering."
"A decent barleywine, but not my favorite and this kind of beer I like to savor, so I'll pass on getting another one. Not sure if I'll finish this bomber...I have a 12 oz 2005 Bigfoot chilling just in case."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, malty scent that boasts of burnt toffee and caramel malts. It's rich with a mild hop presence. The taste is good. It has a smooth, warming flavor that goes down easy and finishes malty with a nice hop bitterness. It's full of caramel and roasted malts. It has a wonderful burnt toffee taste that is complimented with a nice hoppy flavor. It may be a little too bitter, which lessens the impact of the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is damn good barleywine. It's rich and flavorful and highly drinkable."
"22 ouncer bomber bottle, provides no freshness/vintage indication. Pours a shade of rich, dark honey almond, with a dark tan thin head and leaving just slight, fine lacing. Nose here is vinious and of some dark maple syrup. Rich, thick and flavorful Bwine, notes of honey, maple, sweet malts, with a moderate taste of hops in the finish. Mellow, smooth and worthy brew."
"Hazy; no, make that a dirty copper color topped by a surprising tan colored head. The head leaves a thick lace on the side of the glass as it recedes. The nose is a blend of grapefruit and pineapple citrus hop, bread dough, maybe some biscuit malt and a touch of sherry. The flavor has a load of citrus orange hop, with some sweetness from the malt. It almost turns that orange into a nectarine. The biscuit malt is there, along with some toffee (really almost candy sweetness). A little hint of fig. Smooth and slick mouth feel. No residual alcohol at all, it seems there is still allot of sugar left. Nice drinkability."
"The beer is a dark and murky chestnut color, clear and topped with a whispy head. The aroma is of malt and alcohol, followed by hardwood, yeast, dark ripe fruits, and peppery hops. From the second sip the beer is warming (nice). Thick, sweet, and relatively full-bodied. Its not as deeply intense as it could be, and the malt sweetness begins to fade after a few slips. Fairly bitter and hoppy finish. The beer could be a little more complex, given the style, but (as said above), its enjoyable and doesnt really have any flaws. Clean, and somewhat yeasty, the beer kept me interested until the bottle was empty. I would certainly buy another bottle."
"Mouth: Sweet without a good bitter finish. A puckery, metallic after taste that's not too desirable. The mouthfeel though is very chewy and nice and the alcohol in the exhale provides the sensation of some spiciness in the nose (though the alcohol flavor is just a bit too strong). Overall, the enjoyability of this beer is deflated because of the metallic taste - although it's not particularly complex, it could be a highly drinkable beer."
"D - Great malty barleywine. Highly drinkable in my opinion. Huge beer. Excellent to end the evening with."
"Pours a one finger, light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lacing. Cloudy ruby color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Roasted coffee nose. Starts and finishes with a burnt spicey coffee flavor, lingering bitter aftertaste, still its drinkable but there are much better barleywines like N'ice Chouffe Belgian Barley Wine. $6.10 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Drinkability- Won't let this beer keep me from trying this fresh eventually down the line. Not really happy about this bottle, but it was drinkable...but not by much."
"Great bargain barleywine that impresses. Fairly easy drinking as well."
"drinkability: yeah the bottle will be finished, but i'm not really into it. sooo many better barlelywines and finishing this bottle was some what of chore."
"Wine stained leather. Aroma of brandy, rich, deep, fruity malts, caramel, resinous hops and red wine. Nice, sugary malts of all types provide loads caramel and fruit flavors. I would have personally liked to see more hops in this barley wine, not because I like a hoppy barley wine, but because the sweetness of the malts was just a little to overboard. Still though, like most barley wines, this is pretty tasty."
"Bottle at 55* in a snifter. Pours a slightly hazy, deep amber/copper color with a dense light tan durable head. Sparse lacing along the glass. Aroma leans toward the malts rather than much of a hop nose. Notes of raisin, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar and chocolate covered malt balls dominate. Some faint hop aromas make a play in the background revealing some orange and herbal spiciness. Palate is thick, syrupy and silky smooth; very pleasant. Initial taste is a well rounded hit of a malty, dark fruit sweetness, but in no way cloying. Kind of atypical for a west coast BW to have the malt profile dominate the hops, but a nice change. It all finishes with a late moderate hop bitterness bringing in some citrus and pine. The 10% alcohol is incredibly tame under all the malt. Although I prefer the hoppier BWs, this was a nice and well done change of pace"
"With all the straight forward malt sweetness found in this beer, I would suggest that a bit more hop flavor and hop bitterness would make this more drinkable as a young Barleywine. As it is though this should age pretty well; the sweetness should mellow considerably over the years and the beer should pick up lots of age malt complexity with time as well. I am enjoying this beer now though, I just need to make sure to lay a couple of these puppies down."
"Picked up during at Hi-Time Wine in Costa Mesa during a recent visit to Southern California, the 22 oz. bomber featured a lot of medals that Old Blarney had been awarded. There wasnt any freshness dating, but the bottle looked quite pristine. The beer came out deep clear copper in color with a foamy, clingy head that was one finger thick. The looks were definitely stately, and so was the reserved smell. I was greeted by an aroma that rather malty, instead of the bight west coast hop assault I was anticipating. I could detect some dully earthy and vaguely spicy hoppyness via the nose. The taste was balanced nicely between sweet and dry with a constant back and forth interplay between the flavors. The malts won out in the end though, with their buttery sweet flavor. The hops were citric in their acidity, and moderate in bitterness. There was a brief hint of peat smoke in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was thick, gritty, and teeth coatingly sticky. I found the beer to be somewhere between the English and the American Barleywine styles. While this is a great beer, it didnt quite have the intensity of flavors displayed by the best American examples like Bigfoot, Old Crustacean, and Old Ruffian. It also lacked the smooth mellowness that great English examples like Old Nick, and J. W. Lees exhibit so well. So lets call it an Irish Barleywine, and so the Old Blarney moniker makes sense after all."
"Old Blarney is warm oaken brown with a glowing fruity aroma hinting at melon. An initially vigorous outpouring of CO2 soon slows to a persistent flow of tiny bubbles fighting their way upwards through the dense body. The flavor is kind though not particularly abundant, especially in comparison to Moylans other more charismatic offerings. Simple contours of maltiness and bittering coexist in harmonious balance though I found it odd that the bottle housed no yeasted lees."
"The 10% alcohol never really makes itself known. Overall, there is a nice maple syrup taste that envelops this beer. it's not too sweet or sugray, but the ingredients blend nicely to create a highly drinkable Barley Wine."
"It's full, to be sure, and nicely rounded. An excellent example of the west coast style American barleywine!"
"Drinkability - understandably limited at 10% abv, but extremely approachable and quaffable. Good choice for a tasting as an intro to the style."
"First sip reveals a smooth bodied brew with very mild carbonation and a slightly syrupy texture that I always enjoy when present in a barleywine. Flavor is toffee sweet with ripe pears and a bit of vanilla and raisin. Again the piney hops make a cameo on the finish. Quite a nice beer that gives a bit of warming in the belly."
"Pours a brown color with a small head that has good retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a decent amount of alcohol with the dark malts as well as a lot of raisin sweetness. The alcohol isn't as obvious in the flavor. The raisins take a large presence in the flavor, as do some caramel malts, but nothing is over the top here. Smooth and balanced. Very nice. Easy to drink and the mouthfeel is moderate."
"Pours a nice ambered brown color with a small head that sits atop and coats the beer. The nose is nice with slight raisin sweetness, a wiff of alcohol and some sweet caramel. The flavor is balanced. ot too big or too small. Good sweet and slight caramel and a hint of roasted. A nice spicey and woody hop hits on the finish. I like the balance. The feel is thick and slightly syrupy. I find this to be a well rounded American barleywine. The alcohol is very well hidden. I like it."
"Big thumbs ...wait, how many do I have? well, they're all going up, up, up!"
"Drinkable but could be smoother. The hoping is a bit rough; might improve with aging."
"Drinkability is solid to good. Fairly typical barelywine that is a tad to one-dimensional. No distinctive malt or hop profiles to make it memorable. Good beer just not great beer."
"Pours a rich copper with a creamy one finger head that that settles nicely leaving some light lace,deep intese fruity aromas with some underlying but very noticeable pine.Wow a big flavorful barleywine very Pacific coast piney and resiny upfront with a big fruity alcolholic finish the alcohol really hits.Just a sublime creamy mouthfeel and pretty slick going down the hatch and it warms the insides.Wow truley and awesome big brew a night cap that cant be beat."
"Thanks to hopsrus for sending this a while ago! Bottle-conditioned, medium to deep brown body, very cloudy with a low light brown head. Aroma is intensely hoppy, grapefruity, lemony. Hops hide most of the rest. Definitely west coast in mouth too, huge cascade grapefruity hops, resinous, piney and quite overwhelming actually. A hint of caramel is noticeable, but it feels like the hops keep it from expressing its glory. Very bitter dry finish. Creamy mouthfeel, very interesting, with a perfect amount of carbonation and feeling not unlike a fudge bar that melts in the mouth. Looks aint everything!"
"This is definitely a west coast style Barleywine in it's true form. The pour leaves a copper bronzish color with a medium tan head that soon dissipates to just barely covering the beer. The aroma on this beer is very strong and bold. I notice berries combined with honey and then hops added on to that. Really nice. The beer is thick and syruppy in body. This is definitely a big, strong beer. Alcohol hits my tongue almost instantly and stays with me the whole time all the way down my belly. The malts and hops keep striking me back and forth with neither taking control but both showing their precense. The malts were quite sweet with caramel, apple, and figs at first. The hops came in big waves with a piney flavor but never really bitter. There's a creamy body that goes along with the sweetness and hoppiness that most Moylan's beers seem to have. That berry smell is noticeable in the taste the further I go. The hop strike maintains itself in the aftertaste but there's not much bitterness though, maybe because of the sweetness. The hops aren't really complex but they mix well with the alcohol. The finish lingers but again has a good mixture of malts, hops, and alcohol. This is like a better version of the hog heaven from Avery. A big beer with tons of ingredients and hops. Sounds like a west coast beer to me. But I'm not complaining."
"Pours a deep copper/light brown with a thick frothy head. Slightly hazy. Nice combination of sweet malt and alcohol. Some herbaceousness noticable. Thick and rich on the palate. Mocha, with a dry bitter finish. Candy sweetness throughout. Coating mouthfeel, but not syrupy. Pleasant, lingering finish. Very nice. A good example of a barleywine style. Definate West Coast influence with the abundant hops. Very well done. This brewery is quickly becoming a favorite of mine."
"22oz Bomber. Pours a dark reddish brown color with a quickly departing off white head that leaves no evidence of its existence shortly after. This smells of sweet fruits and some floral hops with a bit of alcohol lurking about. Very hopped up front on the taste with malty sweetness following shortly after. It finishes with a dry and bitter taste that lingers for a while and alcohol is quite warming. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick and this is quite drinkable. Overall its a good beer but not one of the best of its style."
"This one has a beautiful ruby brown body with a light khaki head that explodes out of the bottle. Irritation from having to wait to let it settle keeps this from getting a 5 on appearance. The aroma is malty, with a good bit of piney hops. The flavor is caramel apples supported by a firm bitterness. The malts are soft and the hops are metallicly hard, which actually makes for a nice contrast. The burps come up like creosote, though."
"A solid barleywine from California, and not surprisingly very hoppy as well. Though this isn't one of the classics of the style, I'd still have it again."
"This barley wine poured a color a little darker than oxidized steel, perhaps a rusty blood color. One finger off white head that quickly becomes a rocky cover. The aroma is sweet flowers and dark fruits and a little spiciness. Kinda sweet, maybe caramel at the first taste then a slight chocolate hint. After this comes the slightly bitter, herbal, and citrus hops. Good crisp finish and the alcohol is pretty well disguised, maybe I should be sipping this..."
"Pours a caramel brown, settles a dark and thickly hazed golden-orangey brown color with a medium sized ivory fluffy froth. Lace sticks in inky webs at first but as it goes nearly no lace decides to stick. Notably strong twingey caramel/alcohol aroma at first but fades as it warms. Lushfully solid caramel nose with an alcoholic warmth and tone always sifting underneath. Notes of fresh banana, mango, orange, lingering dark dulled citrusy skins are favorably smokey within. Taste of darkened hard caramel candies, the caramel is very nice here, kinda dark or perhaps even scorched a little, not quite smooth, roughly edgy with some suppressed earthy tones in the hop backing. Nice touches of chocolate and butterscotch candies float around within and a moderate warmth and subdued burn along the way down keep it from being completely smooth and drinkable. Very light notes of fruit and citrus linger here and there. Feel is a bit hindered with a fluffy chalkyness, yet smooth and inviting smoothness continues to keep hold. Not an overly complex or beefy barleywine. Sits just right on a cold and windy March evening with a good load of malted caramel, something I'd have no problem having again. Thanks xlperro!"
"Digging it."
"22oz bomber, unknown vintage. A dark red colour with ruby edges, and a thin off white head of foam. Aromas are extremely hoppy, with booze and sweet caramel malts in the mix as well. The taste is very hoppy up front with a huge malt backbone and tons of sweetness in the middle. The finish is dry and lingering and very reminiscent of Double Bastard. The mouthfeel is thick, but not cloying and the drinkability is excellent!"
"Dark amber with golden head. There are little sediments present in the beer. The smell is very nice with floral hints and a high fruity hoppiness. The taste is smooth and almost like syrup with flavors of caramel, molasses, citrus fruits and spices. A delicious blend of spices and strong malts and the alcohol pleasantly warms the stomach. Very nice aftertaste of strong/old malts and a hint of pine. A nice barleywine. Delicious."
"Clear amber in color with very little carbonation and a very meager head. The aroma is surprisingly citric with a noticeable, fairly medicinal alcohol scent. The flavor starts off with a brown-sugar maltiness, quite hoppy in the finish, with an aftertaste that as at once bitter and sugary sweet. Alcohol has a bit too much bite in the rear, leading this beer to be both harsh and cloyingly sweet at the same time. Something of an accomplishment, I suppose! Full bodied and a bit oily in texture. The flavor does improve as you work your way down the bottle, though that might just be the alcohol talking. Adding the yeast seems to help too. I like Moylan. I really do. And so I was surprised at my disappointment with this beer. But then, consider their Christmas Ale... A bit of an uneven brewery, this."
"22 ounce bottle. No date in sight."
"Everything works out but it really doesnt come together (the parts are greater than the whole)"
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 9th, 2004: This beer is a deep ruddy amber color with a medium thick light tan head. Sticky thin lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and caramel, along with a bit of hops. Rich and smooth with a lot of malt up front, as well as some citrus and hops for good balance. The finish is lightly bitter and a little earthy. Overall another solid offering from Moylan's."
"This beer poured a very murky amber brown color. No doubt sediment and carbonation present in that murky mess that formed an off white bubbly head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, carmel, some citrus and alcohol present as well. The flavor was full of malt, caramel, with some cocoa and coffee elements. The body was quite creamy and of a medium texture with a slightly bitter finish. A very rich, heavy barley wine that would probably be even better with some cellaring."
"Drinkability is clearly limited on this bad boy. But if I could choose one dessert glass of beer each day, this might be it. Great beer from Moylans. Remember the name as you'll hear a lot more from this brewer."
"If you want to get ripped, this beer is for you. This monstrous 10% ABV brew poured a deep reddish amber that had an unfiltered look. Tannish head shrunk down but a thin layer remained. Lacing was wispy and scattered. Sweet malt aroma was very inviting. Same sweet malts balanced nicely with some aggressive hopping. Thick chewy mouthfeel was perfect for this style. While ten percenters are not my norm, I found this heavy duty ale quite drinkable. it didn't have the rawness of Rogue's and though I haven't had Anchor's Old Foghorn in sometime, I think this stands up quite nicely. A great beer for a cold night."
"This is a big, thick chewey beer. It's like a meal in a bottle. you won't drink many of these at a session, but you won't need many given it's 10% ABV."
"22oz Bomber. Pours a color just like apple cider and just as unfiltered looking. Has thick white head that dies quickly yet leaves some serious lacing. A sweet malt aroma tells me this is brewed to style and unlike the other hopped up american barley wines I've experienced recently. Malt is strong and sweet here. This is as full a body as I've tasted in this style. Smooth with a warming alcohol kick at the end. Flavor is sweet and malty with notes of fruit. Overall a nice barley wine that seems brewed to style in my opinion."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Great entry level barleywine and economical to boot. A good one to have now and then, but not worthy of a special occasion."
"Appearance: This massive beer pours a beautifully hazed mahogany amber tone topped by a conservative tan head beautiful small etched even lacing very fine but concentrically formed. Aroma: Sticky and juicy layers of hops with the barleywine malts very rich malt treat forming the base to be topped with copious amounts of piney west coast hops glazed with caramel or butterscotch very rich and warming good for the olfactories. Taste: Challenging complex tones but oh so rich and fulfilling juicy sweetness to the hop and malt combo wow this is good stuff the pine cone like hop tone dominates just enough doesn't overbear the palate. Creamy tones rush between the pauses of the bursts of the rediculous amount of malt and powerful hop presence very good stuff. Mouthfeel: Full bodied rich syrupy hop resin filled creamy fluffiness great profile big ass beer from california. Drinkability: The alcohol presence isn't overbearing toward the flavor but I bet after a big bottle of this one it hits you pretty decently, so it all depends how you judge the drinkability I judge it on the basis that if I could I would have bottle after bottle this beer seems like the one I would go for if I were in the mood for a full bodied lucious barley wine, I think it's amazing."
"2002 vintage. Dark brown color, medium head. A massive barleywine. Intense malt flavor, definite hop bite. Full bodied. Intense flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and malty. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Not much of an alcohol bite despite being 10% by volume. Nice beer."
"For all its sweetness, this brew had a very noticeable dryness that did not make it seem as ""big"" as a lot of other barley wines. Plus, the flavors themselves were more subdued than any other beer of this style that I have ever had, except for maybe Old Foghorn. However, it was still very enjoyable. Actually, the dryness made it even more drinkable than a lot of heavier beers of this style."
"Overall: A warming, impressive dark fruity Barleywine from Moylans. Highly Recommended."
"the aroma of this beast was deep brown in color with red highlights when backlit. it had an amazing thick opal colored head about two fingers thick. the aroma was of roasted malt, carmel, floral hop right at the beginning and alcohol. the taste when cold, was very very hoppy with a small malt character, but as it warmed that is where it got really good. the malt grew and became very well balance and very alcoholic.it had a super dry hop finish and thick mouthfeel."
"This is a delicious beer. It's balanced in the sense that there's so much of everything that no one thing can dominate. Amazingly, it's quite drinkable even cool (unconscionably drinkable for 10%). Warm, it's heaven."
"A well put together beer that has a complexity that is interesting!"
"Pours amber in color with a reasonable size cream color head that quickly dissipates to a thin sheet covering the treasure beneath. The aroma is very piney with some floral qualities. The piney/hoppy aroma took me by surprise given my previous barleywines had a much more subdued hop character. The hoppiness continues into the taste as well. The initial taste was quite bitter and the hops abound. As I progressed through the bottle, I found the sweet malt to balance the hops very well. I tasted caramel, coffee, and hints of nuts as well. Hops are very present throughout the beer. I have to say that, at this point, prefer less hop character. Still a good beer."
"Creamy, persistent, uniformily thick tan head tops a clear ruby hued brew. Frazzled lace remains. Pungently herbal and citrusy hop nose and assertive caramel malt combine with notes of leafy tobacco, mild carob, and hints of red licorice in aroma. Pronounced dark caramel malt sweetness upfront in flavor is ceded and offset by toasted malt and moderate hop bitterness. Fruitiness is mild, and indirectly perceptible by a concentrated, date like sweetness that emerges mid palate. Moderate hop bitterness surfaces late, and although it offsets residual sugars and prevents cloying sweetness, bitterness leaves the pervasive caramel malt character unhindered. Mild citrus and herb Columbus hop flavor. Medium bodied and slick in mouthfeel. Finishes w/ an impression of caramel syrup on darkly toasted bread. Old Blarney is a tasty and unique barleywine. Other than the dominant caramel malt profile, there wasn't great depth of character, however. It's more of a dessert barleywine than an everyday sipper."
"A vaporous cherry red color as it pours from the glass, producing a massive light tan head, which after decaying leaves some fine lace to cover the glass. Baked apples, caramel, light hints of coffee, toasted grains, whew what a treat for the old beak. Big malt start that is somewhat sweet, the top thick and meaningful in mouth feel, the finish is pleasantly hopped, spicily acidic, droughty lingering alcohol bitter aftertaste and a fine representative to the style, quite robust."
"Citus aroma,brown orange color, fresh pine-citrus hoppy flavor,alot of hops in this barley wine, but still very balanced, almost like an Imperial IPA, really great, I love this one."
"This is a murky looking light scarlet red brew.  A thin coating of a head dissipates into an edging that provides some, but little, belgian lace.  Thick, sweet caramel malt dominates on the nose.  The taste is very complex.  A huge malt presence provides a solid foundation.  Very sweet and almost cloying but not quite.   The hops are more noticeable on the tongue than on the nose.  There is some earthiness and herbalness coming from the hops.  Provides some nice depth to this brew.  There's a fair amount of fruity character also.  Some alcoholic notes pop up here and there, but not as much as you'd think in a 10% a/v beer.  Mouthfeel is chewy and viscous.  Almost syrupy.  Carbonstion level is appropriately low.  Damn fine brew."
"It's brown with a trace of red and has a big tan head.  Hops are swimming in it and really hit you in the nose, along with lots of malt.  It's got all sorts of flavor:  a bit of chocolate, fruit, and toast.  It's a very heavy beer, with a solid mouthfeel.  The beer is warming and definitely a contender for a cold rainy night."
"287"
"This pours with an off-white whipped cream head, over hazy amber liquid. Intense malty nose with dark fruit notes as well. Taste is smooth mouthfeel with a superp blend of heavy duty malt mixed with restrained but ever present hop bitterness, fading into a long, long malty finish. This one helluva 10% ass-kicking beer!"
"Pours a nice deep amber with a great foamy tan head that lasts and clings to the glass.  Smell is of sweet caramel malt, warming alcohol, and floral hops.  Tastes start off with initial hop bitterness which is soon overpowered by the sweet maltiness.  Flavors include toffee, dark fruits and some faint chocolate.  Cloyingly full mouthfeel is almost like you are chewing the beer.  Very drinkable for a barley wine.  This is a real nice brew and is yet another good one that I have tried from this brewery."
