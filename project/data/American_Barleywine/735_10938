Bright grapefruit and some  leafy herbal. A big malt  with brown sugar and honey and soft bread. The taste is sumptuous. It's sweet but not cloying. It has grapefruit that is tart and pithy and has the peel. The hops are leafy and wide. The soft bread and brown sugar all come together for a malt that is sweet and delectable with a bit of sitckiness to it. Earthiness gives way in this to a firm herbal and a bit of alcohol that grazes the back palate. The finish is dry and there is an ample bitter to leave you with a bit of resiny coating on the mouth and time to taste all those tremendous flavors again while a bit of spice lingers at the back palate.","utopiajane","Aug 08, 2014"

Smell of hops and caramel, dates, plums, and dark fruit, and spicy hop notes. Taste is caramel malts up front, mild bittering hops on the middle and back with the caramel, brown sugar, and a dash of cinnamon toast. Great mouthfeel, richly carbonated and buttery, thus making for a decadent barley wine. Reminds me somewhat of a more caramel version Sierra Nevada's Big Foot.

The hops took on a medicinal quality in its bitterness that took away many of the fine points in the flavor of this beer. The medicine-y nature continued through the swallow and lingered long on each sip. I love a good and hoppy barleywine and I thought this had lots of promise.

3.86,2.7,3.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"The booze hits first. Not a burn but an immediate warmth and presence. Hopes are strong like they were in the smell but the malt is really there in force as well. Some dark candied sweetness, some tart flavors too. Slightly sour grape or dates? Feels like one big blanket at first before individual parts come out to identify. Seems to go down very easily for me. Feels rich but not super thick. Smooth overall. Hop bitterness shows but the malt and body really keep it down on the whole. Slight chocolate note in the aftertaste, not really sweet though. Some earthiness to it. Grainy. The tart fruit really comes out if you hold this one for a bit. A nice sipper. Don’t feel the ABV too strongly to this point. Seems like this could be a big malty IPA aged on oak or something similar without that flavor being dominant. Would be interested to find a food pairing for this. Could make for good after dinner sharing as well. Really like the flavor as this has warmed in the glass. I didn’t quite know how this one would go but it definitely did appeal to me. 21A did a nice turn here.","jujigatame","Sep 25, 2013"

Mild aroma of orange and tangerine citrus, ethanol and faint sweet malt; almost smells more like a tincture of fruit than an ale. Flavor of citrus hops, orange, faint dark and light stone fruit, mild malt, somewhat astringent finish. Medium bodied. An odd take on the American barleywine style that leans more towards a dry double IPA with less dark fresh and dried fruit than generally encountered in a barleywine. The malt body seems thin for the style and ABV. Alcohol is less dominant in the taste than aroma, but is still strong. The bitter orange flavor, particularly in the finish is intriguing, but I'd like to see some more malt support for the fruit and hops here. Worth a try; I'm going to cellar a few to see what happens over time; it's a bit too hot and unbalanced right now.","LiquidAmber","Jun 21, 2013"

The aroma smells of dark fruit, grains, brown sugar accents, ripe citrus and a slight dankness that lends this a bit of airiness in the nose. The taste is similar, being sweet and fruity up front with notes of toffee, toasted grains, brown sugar, and pithy dark cherry all being present before an assertive hop profile takes hold and leaves this feeling bitter and resinous . A lingering graininess and a sticky combo of fruit and sweetness hang in there as well though after each sip. The feel is full bodied with a chewy creaminess to the carbonation. That 11-12% ABV is present, adding some extra boldness to the flavors but without this becoming stinging or overly taxing on the palate. This was certainly decent for such a big take on a Barleywine, with a definite boldness to the flavor and feel. I’m not quite sure that the balance was quite where it needed to be but its relative smoothness and having to commit to only 8oz made this a pleasant and warming sipper.","Kegatron","Mar 31, 2013"

Aromas of tropical fruits, heavily ladened with mango and pineapple, with a subtle roasting and some darkly sweet fig in the backbone. Also some citrusy spicing throughout the nose, with orange zest and pepper dancing around the sinuses. Flavors are heavily roasted and rich, with a dark caramel backbone and tobacco highlight. Pepper and tamarind spicing throughout, with a subtle boozey kick to keep your tastebuds going. The tropical fruit becomes a much more blended characteristic on the palate, with a fruit punch feel, but much more concentrated. Resiny characteristics in the aftertaste, adding to the richness. Sharp, boozy kick at the end of the aftertaste, leading to a slick, slightly bitter, tangy lingering finish. Tasty brew.","GarthDanielson","Mar 20, 2013"

Flavor is good, but seems fairly one-dimensional and falls off too soon for me. I'd like to see it linger more really. And I'd like more complexity. But maybe ate would bring that out. Perhaps I shall get more to see what happens with them over time. Either way, excellent example of the style.

3.82,1.6,3.5,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Interesting take on the American barleywine style. I'm used to a ton of hop bitterness in this style but this is dank and floral with a surprising amount of citrus and tropical fruit sweetness. There's still some dry, resinous bitterness but hints of grapefruit, papaya and orange peel balance things out. Earthy malt backbone with hints of leather, caramel, toffee and dark fruit notes. Some plum, raisin and date add a vinous character that compliments the sweetness. The high ABV is very well masked with only slight heat, making this strong beer dangerously drinkable. My only complaint, and it's not a minor one, is that the bitterness and tropical fruit sweetness overwhelm the barleywine characteristics. A bit too sweet and in my opinion needs more heat and malt flavor. Otherwise, it's a pretty solid, enjoyable beer.","corby112","Mar 11, 2013"

Big grapefruit hop explosion on the tip of the tongue along sweet malts roll into big pine flavor toffee caramel rum raisins and other dark fruits. Raw herbal hop on the finish with giant underlying bitterness and a lingering sweetness. As expected a bit of a boozey finish as well. Lots of malt, dark sweet fruit flavors with piney and bright hop flavors, all with a boozing as throughout. Lots of good flavors and again every flavor you'd possibly expect from a barley wine but it seems a little young. While the flavors aren't offensive and match each other rather equally, they need a little time to mellow out and find their groove.","jtierney89","Mar 10, 2013"

Boozey with some malts, dark cherries, sweet orange and maybe a bit of cough syrup. The taste is malty and boozey followed by cherry cough syrup. A bit woody. Some hop bitterness at the end but not much of the orange I got in the nose. Medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. This is a little more than a month old but isnt overly hot.

The taste doesn't live up to the excellent aroma, exhibiting somewhat harsh solvents alongside flavors of burnt toast, fruitcake, bitter grapefruit peel and pine. Bitter and especally dry for the style, this is an American-style barleywine through-and-through, a style I've never been able to fully embrace. A toasty and rich mid-palate leads way to a solventy, moderately harsh and overly bitter, sappy finish. Not bad, not great. Bigfoot fans may enjoy this.","largadeer","Jul 25, 2008"
