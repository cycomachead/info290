The appearance on this beer is awesome, half inch creamy khaki head, and a deep brownish crimson color that is very appealing when held up to the light. Smells very sweet and malty, hints of honey and nuttiness. The flavor profile on this beer is INTENSE! perhaps I should have given this one a few months to age and tame a bit, yowser! I get an onslaught of everything I picked up in the aroma the sweet maltiness, the subtle honey-nut flavor and some pretty strong carameliness which I love, this is one RICH beast!! I think I would have given this a perfect 5 in taste had I aged it a bit. I'm definitely going to pick up a few more of these and cellar them. Mouthfeel is a little high in carbonation for my liking in this style, like medium high, not a silky on the tongue as I would like either.

Smell is dark grains in the forefront, pretty earthy, seems to be a little hops in the background but nothing fruity -- more something to balance the beer out. Taste is definitely some dark grains, burnt sugar, burnt malts, and a little bit of hops in the back to balance things out a little. It tastes really earthy like the nose. I really don't get any booze from this but I seem to need a little more booze it seems to taste it than others. Mouthfeel is medium thick/maybe a little thicker from the amount of carbonation. Overall it's a great barleywhine that is not sweet at all. There is absolutely no sweetness which is different for your typical beer of this style.

Pours a deep murky amber with small khaki head.aroma of figs, plums, caramel, vanilla, and even a bit of bourbon and booze, though this isn’t the BA version. Flavor is big fruits, mostly figs, some apple, raisins, bready, toffee biscuits. A hint of some booze. Yum. Creamy and heavy body, but with plenty of carbonation keeping this drinkable. Very nice beer, and only my 2nd from CW. I can definitely see this turning out beautifully in a bourbon barrel.","BMMillsy","Oct 27, 2013"

Anyway, this stuff pours a slightly murky garnet topped by a half-finger of wan khaki foam. The nose comprises sye bread, sweet caramel, light toffee, mild rum, light fig, light raisin, light candied orange peel, and a strong boozy backdrop. The taste brings in more of the same, with the bread coming through a bit stronger, the candied fruit as well, and the booze hanging around long enough to have its presence felt with every sip. Luckily, it's somehow not overpowering. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly drying finish. Overall, a solid, strong b-wine, something I could easily see being used as a body warmer in the dead of winter.","TMoney2591","Sep 29, 2013"

Beer stinks of toffee and caramel and bready malts. Still a nice hop presence too. Not bad for a 2012. Taste is great. Aggressively faded hops give a real nice buttery caramel toffee with a hint of grape. Easy drinker. Really exceeded my expectations. Great barley wine worth checking out.","cosmicevan","Jul 01, 2013"

Some spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses toffee, a suggestion of milk chocolate, an earthy quality and a trace of booze. Taste follows nose with the addition of faint citrus notes and some hops bittering that comes out in the middle. Mouthfeel is medium-light in consistency with an even carbonation and a slight acidity. There's also a little residual alcohol heat, but nothing significant.

This is a superb brew. The aroma of caramelized tropical fruits is incredible! The taste further supports the aroma. I'm not getting a big hop aroma, flavor, or a strong bitterness. Instead, the wonderful, clean, sweet, fruity, aroma/flavor is king here with just enough bitterness to balance things out.

Solid bitterness that turns a bit resinous and lingers in the finish. As it warmed, this became more of a light herbal hop bitterness. Heavy malt body and flavour, plenty of caramel, some toffee sweetness, a bit of burnt character in the background. Dried fruits and raisins add complexity, brown sugar, fruity hops.

4.28,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"2006. Slightly hazy. Deep auburn headed towards chestnut color. Huge rocky head of light tan. Excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is malty. Very sweetly caramelish. Toffeeish... do I detect some mild buttery diacetyl under there? Nice. There's a touch of yeasty mineralish character as well. Citrusy hops come through once the head subsides a little bit. In the mouth it's full bodied with an initial zestiness on the tongue. Once warm, however, it becomes more dextrinous and creamy. The flavor is aggressive. Lots of hops and bitterness atop the sweet caramel malt base. Citrusy and piney. Sweet malt combines and softens the citrus. There's some orange, grapefruit, and pineapple. The bitterness is dense, and cuts through the sweet malt with a piney-hop chainsaw before it even gets mid-palate. Rough edges, but cooling, and refreshing. It finishes mainly dry, and piney, with a cooling, minty edge - although there is still a thin strand of sticky caramel left behind. A caramel-coated pinecone! In conclusion... some like it rough! And if that's the case this one's a rarin' ta go! - and I mean that in a good way. I can only assume that that's the way this was intended to be. Soft, sweet caramel and then BAM!!! piney-juicy PUNCH! Nice!!! But for those who like it a bit more rounded you'll need a year or two in the cellar on this one.

Candied fruits and herbal hops round out the nose. Scorched caramel and toasted bitterness flavors lead off. Herbal bitterness follows. Rich, sweetish malts mid-palate come in and make this beer great. Bread pudding, butterscotch, candied fruits, and oak. Herbal bitterness closes the door, but the finish shows glimmers of butterscotch, madeira, and vanilla. Medium-full body with a tingly, yet creamy feel.
