"Overall: Good brew, has some pros and cons that would either make your or break you."
"Overall disappointed - especially considering the time I'd given the beer to mature. It's a swell brew, however, for a barley wine with a name as such it fell short. The complexity of a barley wine leaves a lot of room for creativity. In this case, the name trumps the drink."

"Had this aged and was very impressed"
"22 ounce wax capped bottle, 2013 vintage.  Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a hazy ruby red/copper color with about an inch and a half frothy tan head that stuck around a long time.  There's also a good amount of lacing.  The brew smells like caramel, dark fruit, bready/grainy malt, candied fruit, and some apples.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of toffee, citrusy hops and some booziness.  Nice mix between the malty and bitter hoppy flavors.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit syrupy and slick with moderate carbonation.  I think this is a good barleywine, I'm glad I tried this one!"
"Barley wines are one of my favorite styles. This one was just too timid, neither hoppy nor sweet, lacking in flavor depth and feel depth. just kinda there. Boulder needs to go a lot bigger on this barley wine."
"Overall- Not a bad barleywine, my first beer from Boulder Beer.  I will drink this again and try their other labels."

"I was intrigued by the dreadful rating an early batch received. Methinks revisiting that may be warranted"
"OVERALL: Really good overall. Definitely underrated, which is probably because it’s not 15% and barrel aged. This is a flavorful, enjoyable barleywine with plenty of character, and it drinks away far too easily. Perhaps a little more residual sweetness would help put this over the edge in this category, but as it is, I enjoyed it very much and would gladly drink it again. Thanks again Doops!"
"DATE TASTED: January 26, 2015... GLASSWARE: Duvel oversized snifter... OCCASION: still waiting for Superstorm Iola to hit... APPEARANCE: starts well with an imposing label; intimidating dark garnet body that sports a frothy off-white head that laces with a brazen two-finger strength; lacing is spectral and substantial... AROMA: BIG apple, pear and sour fruit; powerful cherries--a nice mix of a beefy malty base and a kriek... PALATE: full-bodied, warming and hearty--yet smoothly sippable; a balanced barleywine, though it lacks a dry finish...TASTE: cherries are front and center; soft brown ale elements play on the sugary fruits; oddly not as winy as a barley purports to be...OVERALL:as I recalled from years past, a beer worthy of a blizzard watch; the price is about right for its heft; within its genre, not a standout, with enough imperfections to seek out better-rated beers..."

"Killer Penguin may not have anything special to elevate it but it's quite affordable and at least this particular aged bottle is a solid representation of the style."
"Overall a good barleywine, nice sweetness and not too much alcohol in the taste"
""
"Bread and leafy and floral hop aromas with traces of fruit, hint of sherry. Pours brilliant ruby to reddish amber with a ½” finely bubbled foam collar that produces excellent lacing. The palate is a little sweet, mainly malt and some caramel with hints of sherry and some moderate bitterness joined by alcohol on the finish for balance. A little on the thin side body wise for a barley wine and slightly hot. Medium carbonation."
""
""
"Strong barley wine with a great taste and finish. If you're in the a sipping mood, kill a penguin."
"Overall:  This is an extremely good barley wine.  It has great flavors of toasted malt, dried stone fruit and candied sugar.  Delicious!"
"O: not a typical American barleywine - not as dense or heavy, very clear body, lots of pine resin shellac and English toffee. 10% abv for less than $10 makes a good case for the beer - drinks more like an A Fuller's vintage ale than most barleywines I've had."
"Tastes like a red ale with a subtle  fruitcake finish. Not bad but not overly memorable either"
"Not a fan of barley wine but this one is good."
""
"Warming though not tremendously. Caramel. Sweetness. Mild dried fruit. Alcohol is well hidden.  Very nice beer when cellared."
"Dry barley wine with a little hopp"
""

"so they said to write a review even though i use this for my own private catalogue and their new rating system sucks. that said highly delightfyl barleywine, no idea why the bros hate it so much, i loved it and will get it again."
"Serving type: bottle."

"Overall a mild but not real exciting Barleywine."

"It's flavor is on the lighter/milder side for a barleywine, still tasty though."

""
"	Holy shit, that plastic ""Makers Mark"" style top made this beer far too hard to open, that was annoying as fuck - THEN, FINALLY I POURED MY BEER INTO A FUCKIN' GLASS... It was a beautiful ruby/copper color with an ivory head that faded reasonably quickly, but still had decent retention... Though quite a faint nose, wheat and soft cherry aromas do peek out from time to time, bringing with them, some slight hop notes... Taste is fruit forward, with soft cherry, red apple, and even hints of bubblegum immediately their to greet your taste buds... The malts supply some grain flavor, while the hops donate a dry bitterness... The latter coming through in the second half, offering great stability to the aforementioned sweetness... This whole while, the alcohol hides itself niftily throughout each sip... Mouthfeel on this brew is super solid... Light and somewhat bubbly on the forefront and solid and full on the way down, but never being too light or too full in any aspect... Somewhat of a roller coaster of a beer... But shit - WHO DON'T LOVE ROLLER COASTERS?! Not what I expected, but a sucker-punch collection of well crafted ale that I would love to enjoy again... Another good brew - Cheers!!"

"O: Meh. Wish I'd shared this camping this weekend instead of drinking it alone. Mostly hot and sweet and boozey."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits, malts. Taste is alcohol, grapes, malts, dark fruits, a bit more alcohol. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer, but one of these per session is plenty."
""
""
""
""
"overall: Very pleasantly surprised. ratings have this guy as mediocre i guess (and 80 as i review). Maybe i'm a philistine but this beer deserves better imo."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, alcohol, slight roasted malt, yeast, hops, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of an American Barleywine. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, yeast, strong alcohol, hint of spice, and slight roasted malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend. A good Barleywine, but the only distinction is the hint of spice that enhances the body and aroma."

"While not a bad tipple overall, this one seems to have a bit of a problem choosing sides in the whole 'is it or isn't it' barleywine heritage debate, instead deciding to go off on a weak-ass side project of its own, i.e. dumb everything down, just a bit. I swear, I get a bit of malt liquor (pick yer favourite bottom shelf purveyor) essence when I close my eyes and turn my brain off. Maybe that's more telling than anything I have and will still yet consider about this particular offering. Huh."
""
""
"Ok, I really can't put my finger on this one. To me, it's certainly not terrible, but it's just a little too sweet and I'd like to see more of the malt character and less of the fruitiness come through. A little more hop flavor to balance (there's not much whatsoever) would also be nice. Too sweet for my palate, but definitely not a drain poor either. I think if I would come back to this in the winter as a dessert beer I might like it more. Interesting...."

"Pours a clear red-amber with a fair amount of tan head. Fair lacing and good legs. Head didn't hold all that well though. Aroma is of sweet toffee malts, earthy hops, and a bit of oak-like wood. High carbonation and medium body give it a pretty enjoyable mouthfeel. Taste follows aroma very closely."

"Reddish orange in color (the bottle says garnet, which is a perfect description - but it would be cheesy to copy the description off the bottle label) with perfect clarity. Poured with a fluffy, rich, white foam with nice retention that left lots of sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet caramel malt aroma with boozy notes.   the thicker side of medium bodied with slightly subdued carbonation and a slick, oily feel. Sweet, caramel malt flavor with light hop bitterness through the middle, boozy notes toward the end, and a sweet, sticky, finish. A very malt forward ale with little hop character."
""
"Interesting flavors but the overall finished product just doesn't really stand out compared to other Barleywines. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to someone but it also isn't a great example of the style. The yeast fruit is just a bit too strong in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like it. But I seem to remember liking it more the first time I tried it. I guess the worst I can say is that it is best enjoyed by splitting a bottle with a friend. The sweetness becomes a bit too much as I near the last few ounces. I feel it could be better with a little stronger hop profile. That being said, I will be buying it again next winter."
""
""
""
""
""
"While it's not a bad beer, it's not much of an American Barleywine. It's too sweet and never penalizes your palate. Dare I say a 10% ABV Barleywine is a bit girly?"
"Overall: Really nice beer to have now, I can see this settling nice in about 6 months. Light acidity on it and kind of nice feel of tannins. Good beer"
""
""
"Killer Penguin was pretty good. It just does not have what it takes to be something I would ever seek out again. I am glad I let my curiosity get the best of me to try it. However, the muted barleywine flavors, and the way they all come together just do not work. And I do not think any amount of aging will help this beer."
"One of those nothing special or remarkable but done really, really well."
""
""
""
"I'm not really feeling this one at all. Very disappointing. It has a weak nose and off flavors. Not really worth checking out, in my opinion."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/31/2010. Pours lightly cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, plum, pear, apple, floral, light pine, brown sugar, light nuttiness, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/toasted malt and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, pear, plum, apple, nuttiness, floral, light pine, brown sugar, and toasted/yeast earthiness. Slight pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, pear, plum, apple, nuttiness, floral, light pine, brown sugar, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt and dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/fruitiness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice barleywine style. All around good complexity and balance of malt and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

""

"The body is medium with a sturdy carbonation. It's a little too easygoing, I would say, though it has a firm crispness and it flows pretty smoothly."
""
""
"Overall: I'm really enjoying this beer; I particularly like the smooth, fruity nature of the Penguin. I feel like I could accidentally get into a lot of trouble drinking this, based on how easily it goes down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid barleywine that is great for aging. I've never opened a Killer Penguin yet right after purchasing it but if you have the patience to age it for a year or two, I'd recommend it."

""
""
"Very middle of the road. Balanced and inoffensive."
""
"O: Not bad but not great. for a fresh american barleywine it's pretty light on hop flavor. the alcohol is there for sure and the malts are pretty solid. a bit more english than american in my opinion"

""

"O - A good brew no doubt. Much better than the Bros rating would leave you to believe."

"Tend to enjoy this one more in the winter."
""
""
"Overall a disappointment. Closer to an American strong ale than a barleywine. Too many really good ones out there to pick up this one again."
""
""
"Drink- A pretty good barleywine with a lot of flavors that blended well and were fairly citrus forward. I have liked the few Boulder beers I have had and then this was no different. The booze wasn’t that over bearing. Would like an aged bottle to try."

"Overall I dug this. Based on the reviews I wasn't sure how this would be going in, but I enjoyed my session. It's big and bold and different. Will look to purchase again and set the bird down for a year or so. The 10% is evident but enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"O - Overall, this beer is like an odd blend of trying to be big and flavorful/strong, but somewhat drinkable at the same time. At the end of the day, it's just not packing the punch I've come to expect from the style. It certainly isn't bad, but there are plenty of other, better options in this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty standard American barleywine, but not as hoppy in taste as I wanted to balance the sweetness."
""
""
"O - Not a bad barleywine. The 10% is not that noticable at all, which is kinda scary. Easily drinkable, but could probably benifit from some aging. I would probably buy this again."
"I have 4 bottles of 2012 left and a bottle of 2011. My only hope is that the alcohol in this beer mellows out over time and it becomes better. We shall see."
"O - Surprisingly little booze at 10% abv. The flavor profile is a little too sweet, and there's a light waxy note that feels off, but other than that it's not bad. If I came across another I'd put a few years on it before opening."

"a very drinkable barleywine in my book. 2012 vintage enjoyed in a snifter. the pour is mostly clear copper color with lazy but hearty off white lacing. the nose is quite fruity, dried cherries stand out, but red apple and plum may also be present. lots of alcohol, as well as light vanilla and oak notes tickle the nose. points off for it being a little too boozy, but it smells decadent all the same. the flavor is fruit first, with the cherries again being the main player. toffee and english caramalt round out an otherwise caustic alcohol sting, and a little whiskey sweetness lingers on after the swallow. the alcohol becomes even more of an issue as it warms, stopping short of cleaning solvent, especially in the nose. feel is fine, rather light in body for the style, but not thin or watery at all, just not as heavily clad with malty heft as these usually are. gentle carbonation does not detract from the flavor experience. overall a cool holiday barleywine, i enjoyed the fruit forward side of this, but a few years in the cellar might help get the booze under control. an easy bomber to split with a loved one some night when you plan to stay in."
"Come on, Boulder. I had your Black Diamond Chocolate Porter the other day and it was delicious. This is a complete messterpiece."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fine beer, however, it sacrifices flavors for hop bitterness and high alcohol. Best sipped while enjoying a meal."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not bad, it has a really promising aroma, but doesn't have the same level of hop character in the flavor profile. Still drinkable and smooth, this one was over a year old and seems to have aged favorably."
"Overall: certainly more drinkable from the start than your average barelwine with the ABV well hidden. Although drinkablitly improves because of these characteristics, this one comes across a bit watery."
""
"All the flavors here are pretty faint, and it's a bit boozy. What flavor does get past the alcohol is good, but I'm looking for much more from a Barleywine. I'll look elsewhere."
""
"This pours amber with low retention. It smells sweet with figs in the nose. It has a big boozy taste and then it fades to a sweet after taste. It is decently carbonated and has a big body. This is an ok barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
"From the 22 oz bottle, 2011 vintage, so this one's going on a year old. From Grapevine Liquors in Denver."
""
""
"overall - a very good American Style barleywine."
""
""
"A mildly cloudy orange/brown on the pour, with a large and frothy pale yellow head, leaving nice lacing. Oak, molasses and pine are strong in the aroma while tones of sugared fruits, creamy malt and hops. Strong blast of fermented apples cover up most of the other subtle flavors such as molasses and wet wood. Body is relatively flat in overall flavor, with a sweet, malty mouthfeel. Sour, dry finish."
""
""
"Review from 4/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange red brown amber. Thin off-white head with nice lacing. Sweet aroma of sweet malts, dark fruit, hint of hops. Caramel malt and fruits with a moderate hop finish. Hot alcohol. Not that well integrated. May improve with some cellaring, but too hot and unbalanced right now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"originally reviewed: 12-03-2010"
"Clear, deep red-amber with a filmy head. Sweet aroma, rum raisin ice cream, black tea, boysenberries. Big bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Malty flavor with some tea characteristics. Alcohol is noticeable at the finish with some bitterness."
""
"thanks redliner8."
"O-Unfortunately, this is the first beer from Boulder Brewery i have to give a sub-par rating to. They just missed the mark. Barleywines are meant to be big, like WINE! This tastes like a ramped up amber ale with too much going on and the flavors don't explode like they should. Perhaps a year of aging might subdue the booze and bring out the malts, but i'm not seeking this one out again."
""
""
""
"O- When I have little to say about a barleywine, the better. That means it's doing its job of staying drinkable, even if it's not very complex. I'm not a huge fan of Hazed & Infused, but this is a very decent barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
"Simply amazing, enjoy now, or cellar for a few years!"
""
"Pours a medium copper color that looks a little thin around the edges when held to the light. There is a nice one to one and a half finger off white head which gives way to nice strands of lace. The aroma has a caramel malt backbone, and then a sweet fruity aroma. The backend has a slight citrus kick. The taste starts out bready with caramel malt, and then gives way to a fruity taste along with a slight citrus kick at the end. The fruit appears to be a grape or plum flavor. The mouthfeel is lowly carbonated and a bit watery. Overall it was an okay beer, however, I would peg it more in the english category than the american for a barelywine."
"O: A bit underwhelming, not overly complex or interesting, its decent don't get me wrong, but for a 10% barleywine with a wax coated cap i expect more. Probably a good barleywine for a new/novice craft drinker."
""
""
"Overall this is an okay beer, but a substandard barleywine. Flavors are not complex, nor will they become complex overtime. This may have been better fresh with more hop character but maybe the ethanol was more dominant then as well. IDK, just not a well made beer in my opinion."
"O - The alcohol burn is something I like to see in this style, but here its overkill. Without the burn, maybe this is a mediocre barleywine."
"I was surprised this wasn't scored higher. Poured a 2"" beige head with decent lifespan. The body is a hazy burnt sienna brown in masstone but held to the light there's a deep amber. It smells nicely of malt, caramel, and toffee. The taste mirrors the smells, and is a little salty. The body during the aftertaste is a little watery but it does have a long finish as well as a subtle low note of hops lasting in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an enjoyable beer but not a knockout. The presentation does add something, and the beer gets good points on the pour and nose from me. The taste leaves something to be desired; even among the American styles, I like to detect some richer malts in a barleywine. The hops in the taste are perfect, but they aren't probably balanced by the malt."
"The remainder of the beer is enjoyable, but nothing special. Sweet and sticky aromas of caramel, toffee, and a little bit boozy even after a slumber in my cellar. The flavor is similar, and it lacks some punch, complexity, and depth. The texture is a touch thin, but the carbonation is on point. A reasonably well-done barleywine, I am happy I passed on the case before trying a bottle."
"O: Overall, fantastic. I had actually been looking for this beer for quite some time, not having realized that it was a 'every two years' release. Very good."
""
"Served in a snifter. This beer is missing something, although I can't put my finger on exactly what it is. The aroma is sweet with caramel, and the lacing is heavy on the head that lingers for a long time. The color is deep mahogany. The hops are noticible and pleasant, and the taste is pleasant but lacking - perhaps it needs a bigger malt presence? I'm not quite sure. I like the flavor, I just wish it was bigger in this beer. Certainy not disappointing, but not quite what I was looking for."
""
""
""
""
""
"An ok beer, for the price not really worth it and I was hoping for more. The barrel treatment is virtually unnoticeable"
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap into a snifter, the beer is a deep, dark, auburn coloring, with ruby highlights and a fluffy, small bubbled, light tan head of a good half inch. Malty and rich aromas, with a good boozey highlight, some light spicing, and a touch of hops. Good, bold flavors that are very well balanced. Good hops profile that touches the tip of the tongue, but settles in on the mid-tongue. Malty profile is rich, with a crystal and roasted caramel palate. Good, toasty characteristics to draw everything together, leading to a peppery hopped aftertaste, with a little kiss of the booze again. Decent cling along the glass while you drink. The finish is surprisingly light, with only a slightly sweet linger that is very tasty and pleasant. Good tasting brew, but I'm not sure how it would hold up over time. I am curious enough to try it..."
""
"This is a tasty barleywine! Some alcohol is present but it works well with the taste."
""
""
"O. Overall I think this is a pretty solid Barleywine. Granted I need to try this fresh as comparison, but with 3 years on it, it is pretty tasty. Nothing earth shattering, and having King Henry a few days ago not much would seem to compare. However I have read a lot of negative reviews of this one, and I guess I don't get that in this bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An odd little barleywine. I think this retailed for around $10 or so a bottle. For that price, it's not bad. The toasted nut flavors are really nice, if a bit odd. Yet the thin body and a bit of residual alcoholic heat take away from this a bit. Also, there's very little depth. I dunno what this is like fresh, and I could almost justify buying it again, if it wasn't for the fact that Schlafly makes an oak-aged barleywine for around $11 that, with 2-3 years on it is sublime."
"A bit overpriced, not the best bwine yet still a good one. A bit basic."
""
"O – Liked this one. Easy drinker despite the 10% ABV. Subtle for a barleywine. Aging one and curious to see how it does. I would definitely have this again."
""
"Overall, it was an enjoyable beer and may do better with even more age on it (4-5 years) but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad here, nothing too spectacular, but one I'd be happy to have again."
"The body is medium and a little bit sticky. Good carbonation. Overall not bad, but I think I'd pass in the future. There are just more available barelywines that I enjoy a bit more."
"Overall kinda meh, not too bad but sweeter and very syrupy, decent malts but not great, hops are there but meh."
"O (3.5) - Slightly better than the 09 version, the lesson learned was to drink this stuff as fresh as possible, as with age it becomes garbage."
"O- i couldnt enjoy this one. Maybe it was netter when fresh, but way too sweet and pretty much no hop character."
"Once again, the taste is dominated by malt. The fruit and citrus also come through a lot. Bitterness seems about right, but the lack of any sort of hop presence makes this one just boring."
"O: Pretty good beer honestly. The ABV is only sort of noticeable and the flavor is nicely balanced. Went well with dinner."
"M. Weak honestly. Medium bodied, alcohol packs a punch. But it leaves me wanting more."
"This is much better than I anticipated. I am enjoying this beer thoroughly. Perhaps this beer is at its prime, for my taste anyway. I'd guess that its probably 7-8 months old. I'd say this one is worth sitting in your cellar, it doesn't cost much after all."
"O: Overall a good barleywine for the price and definitely worth the 6 month wait to drink. Aging my other bottle to compare against a fresh 2011 release."
"My Rating: 3.8 (4 if aged)"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, as a self-proclaimed “Hophead” I prefer my ABW’s with more hops bitterness, but this beer is either proof of the common thought that ABW’s peak at around two-years-old or I just like it more than most people."
"Original flavor, with a ""Killer"" punch, I bought an additional to cellar for 12-18 months, will update and edit when tried again."
"2010 Red wax bottle top. Poured into snifter. Pours smooth with the color of maple syrup and viscosity of malt vinegar. Sitting in the glass it has hints of red. Deadening bland taste at the finish across the palate, not a boozy flavor, but has a consistency to it. I feel this one would be better after being in the cellar for a period."
"Not my favorite barley wine... This beer is an opaque brown color with a solid head on it. The lacing is very nice too.the problem I have with this is the mixture of sweetness and spice. It's not very well balanced. I had a difficult time even drinking the 6oz. Sampler I had. I don't plan on having this one again anytime soon."
"Overall: The beer smelled good, but it was not as good as was hoping for. Below average barleywine, but not horrible. That being said I could not finish my glass of this beer."
"Fuller syrupy body, lower carbonation, sticky and chewy. Eh, this really isn't what I would call exciting or something I'd buy again. Overall a little boozy and sweet for me, although I still managed to finish my glass."
"I don't recommend to many of these if you need to get behind the wheel. this beer packs a punch."
"D: This is a nice barleywine, but not a great one. The age smoothed it out quite nicely."
"D: I will not drink this again, really wasn't impressed. It drinks ok but I am glad I shared the bottle. I felt the carbonation was too much."
"D: Definitely a sipper. Warming alcohol is prominent."
"Overall drinkability is very good. No alcohol burn or bite, good carbonation level, no carbonic bite. Not sure why there is no love for this beer."
"D- A sipper with plenty of alcohol bite. A decent barleywine that is lacking to be great."
"Color was somewhat light and cloudy with a minimal head. Aroma had a nice balance of hops and malt. As said earlier, I felt the flavor was a little on the hot side but otherwise as a barleywine should taste."
"D- Drinkable but not something to write home about."
"It just was not a good brew."
"M/D: Full bodied, relatively smooth with low carbonation. Drinkability is OK from an ""I can drink it"" stand point, but not from a ""I want to drink it"" stance. I wouldn't pour this down the drain, but overall it's just a plain beer."
"On tap at Cambridge Common, and has the honor of being the first dud I've ever had there. This is the most un-barleywine barleywine I've tasted: no depth of flavor or aroma, no complexity, not even an interesting color. Very light tone, body and flavor. None of the intensity you'd expect in a barleywine; it's as if it visited the shrink before leaving the tap and had all the mystery reasoned away from it. Letting it warm up for about half an hour didn't even bring out much flavor. Blech."
"d- really struggled to finish the glass...im going to give the other bottle I bought a few years to age"
"D - Easy to drink, nothing too offensive."
"While not the best barleywine our there, it certainly is more drinkable than some of the reviews would have you believe. The Alstroms should give this another shot, as I don't beleive it warrants the ""D" rating they gave it."
"Final thoughts: Don't bother, seriously, it is not worth it. There is much MUCH better available in that price range."
"A pretty nice BW, but a little bit goes a long way."
"decent mouthfeel: full-bodied with average carbonation. not very drinkable; wouldn't pass it up if someone was offering but i probably won't seek this out again."
"D - I'm enjoying this Barleywine quite a bit theres a lot going on here in the flavor and it all works out well worth picking up a bottle if you see it around"
"D. Light; lacks a lot of typical barleywine character - thick, syrupy, with robust malt presence."
"M/D - A touch thin compared to most barleywines. Medium body with a prickly carbonation. The flavors just dont meld well together and it is a bit of a chore to get through."
"Pours a very transparent glowing red/orange hue, a pinkish head forms quickly then dissipates leaving a ring of foam along the glass. Rich resinous hops, some pine, a hefty cherry/sweet malt note lays it on thick with the medicinal qualities, some caramel. Creamy but yet kind of crisp in body, light prickly carbonation hits the tongue. Boozy, but not offensive or overwhelming, you definitely know its there. Not bad but no where near the top of my list."
"D: this may not have aged well despite proper storage."
"Not a bad beer, though not what I am used to when I am drinking a BW. Despite being a mild BW I like this beer-I would describe it as an entry level barleywine."
"Drinkability isn't too bad. There are some unusal aspects of this beer, but overall it's smooth and easy drinking. Definatly has an aged character to it, but it's general softness makes it rather approachable."
"Thoughts: not a great barleywine. I have def had much better."
"Despite the fact that you can really taste the alcohol and despite the fact that it's a bit of a mouthful of syrup and despite the fact that it's really sweet, it does seem to go down pretty easily, but I wouldn't open another. Knock knock! Who's there? Orange! Orange who? Orange you glad I didn't say banana?"
"D - It was too sweet and just seemed ""messy"". I was not a fan of this one."
"This was presented with a small off-tan head with low retention. Nose had a sharp alcohol scent underlain by a malty sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a bit of an alcohol burn on the tongue. As it warmed, I got pine-y notes of hops along with a general malty sweetness. The finish was softly sweet. The Bros. calling it ""a barleywine on Mute"" was spot on. C'mon, Boulder, crank it up to 11!"
"Pours from the wax dipped 22 ounce bottle a somewhat hazy dark orange-amber color, with a small ecru head on top. Aromas of dark brown sugar, burnt caramel and chocolate. On the palate, somewhat sweet, with more of the same and some alcohol near the back. Not all that impressed with this one."
"D - doesn't go down well and is slow to drink"
"It's primary drawback, as compared to a 'better' English BW such as Old Foghorn, is it's lack of complexity. The Brothers have it right on that one - it is a bit dull; especially when compared to Old Foghorn, a GREAT English BW...still at $5.99 per bomber (discount shelf at local Whole Foods) I'd drink it often."
"2008 vintage. This poured a clear mahogany with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like rich caramel and toffee and nutty malt, with a little copper hops and alcohol. It tasted like rich caramel and toffee, with some dry chocolate and nutty malt, and a hint of copper and leather. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a rich bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was an excellent barleywine with great malty flavor (definitely English style, not American). It had good body too and hid the alcohol nicely, so it was super easy to drink. Not sure if there would have been more hops fresh, but after a year and a half of age, this is a real gem. Could possibly continue to improve with age (try again after 7-10 years)."
"All in all it's not bad, it was a good aged Barleywine and I'd recommend it."
"D) A nice barleywine, not too over the top in terms of alcohol. A good mix of malty sweet and alcohol bite."
"drinkability: ok"
"The 2009 release is slowly becoming one of my favorite barleywines. This beer pours a great reddich copper color with a thin foamy head. Aromas of dried red fruits, cherries with hints of citrus and honey. The palate comes off sweet at first with dried red fruit flavors but then is balanced with bitter hops"
"Overall why the bad scores? It's a full bodied, flavorful barley wine. I can't say I ever had anything else by this company but will totally try other beers"
"Drinkability is decent, though I couldn't tolerate more than the 22 ounce bomber I had. Compared to other barleys, it's not a stand out by any means but I have to say, despite the negatives and the low scores others gave this beer, I enjoyed it even though my score may say otherwise."
"I was well outside the curve on this one. I found Killer Penguin to be a killer American barleywine. I don't know how big a factor the pre-warming was since I did not sample directly from the fridge, but it couldn't have hurt."
"I am severely not enjoying this beer."
"The alcohol flavor hold back the drinkability for me. Beautiful looking beer, but looses a bit in the flavor department."
"Drinkability - more drinkable than a barleywine should be, but not a classic. It's a sipper but it's kind of hard to put the glass down!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, lip smacking, and stinging."
"D: OK for a beer of this strength, though it wasn't a beer I'd seek out to drink again."
"The texture may be the best part of Killer Penguin--so smooth, scarcely carbonated, very accessible. That this is 10% ABV is remarkable, for the alcohol is hardly noticeable. I found KP a bit confounding but certainly tasty, a different yet ultimately good barleywine. Fans of big, brawny barleywines such as Old Ruffian may well find themselves disappointed with Killer Penguin. I certainly wouldn't blanch at a strong injection of hops, which I think would steer Boulder toward a barleywine that truly is killer, and not pretty good. With a little patience and an open mind and palate, however, this should ultimately please."
"D-the flavors aren't huge and some are a little off. not one of my favorites out there especially with the muted nose."
"The flavor is booze-heavy, with lots of herbal hop-forward notes as well. A little orange in the hops, but otherwise quite earthy, leaning toward tobacco and pine. The malts are pretty sweet, almost maple-like. Hot finish. Drinkability is pretty low with the size and sweetness, but I do like the mouthfeel. Rich and full...give it a shot for a decent price, but to me it's below premium."
"Pours a beautiful and clear mahogany color with a thin off white head. The aroma is very caramely and malty and the high levels of carbonation are visible through the glass. The body is very light but has a strong malty flavor in conjunction with a vinous characteristic. The finish is strong and vinous and fades rapidly leaving the alcohol flavor behind. This beer was too young, hope I can find this vintage in a few years."
"Smooth and velvety but is just missing something. At 10% I thought this would be a heavy hitter, but it definitely fell short of expectations, and I like my barleywines to be light on the hops and heavy on the fruit."
"Overall, bland and forgettable, easy drinking though."
"Go drink some Old Crustacean, Doggie Claws, or Stone's barleywine. This isn't worth it."
"drinkability - i would never buy this again"
"Copper body with orange hues. Aromas of mint, caramel and citrus. Though the bitterness is mild to moderate, the hops do add a good amount of flavor. Caramel, orange peel, mint, and pine. Finish is quite short and mostly hoppy with a touch of sweetness. You can tell this thing is 10%, it has a little bit of a bite to it. Body is a thinner than one might expect for the style. Overall, a pretty good stab at an increasingly vague style. This is more traditional, not too bitter, not too sweet, middle of the road."
"It's been a long time since I've had a barley wine, but I remember them to be fuller in body, not such a watery mouthfeel. I do enjoy this beer altogether, and wouldn't snub it too much."
"Drinkability: A lot of the characteristics I would expect to find in a good barleywine; candied fruits, alcohol sweetness, hop bitterness, but it just doesn't meld together into a nice package of deliciousness."
"D: In the most literal sense for a barleywine it is drinkable, but I don't want a barleywine that goes down easy. The lack of flavor and weak mouthfeel make this beer disappointing. The beer masks the alcohol well."
"This is a decent barleywine but there's not a ton of complexity and with the hops having faded it's pretty much a one-dimensional malty ale. Not bad though."
"Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, not clingy or sticky. Pretty drinkable -- I'm interested to see how it goes as it continues to warm up."
"The Kings Of Hop"
"D: Not bad at all. I was very wary going in because of some of the brews (a D by the Bros?), but this didn't let me down. It is a malt bomb and that makes me happy. Its nice to get away from crazy hops from time to time and get the other side of the spectrum. Sure its not as dynamic as some barleywines I have had, but it was still enjoyable and wasn't bad by any means. Dug it, makes me happy . . . haters."
"D- Easy to drink regardless."
"This one is nice and enjoyably drinkable. For 10%ABV, I'm surprised. The alcohol is very nicely hidden. Pour one into a snifter and sip it over an hour or more. It's different, but very good."
"D: Easy drinker, given the size of the beer, and the alcohol content, this one goes down easy. Fairly nice beer, I'd like to try it fresh to contrast it to what it is now, I'd also like to cellar one for about 3 years to see what happens as well. I'll try it again for sure, hopefully fresh."
"A decent belly-warmer, if not too terribly spectacular. Perhaps this just isn't my style, but I was a tad underwhelmed by this offering, despite its merits. Still, a solid beer and one worth trying, especially if you're into the higher alcohol beers."
"Decent enough beer. I'm not sure if age would help this one out or not - maybe other characteristics would come out from under the malt, maybe not."
"Superbly done, I'd consider the Killer Penguin to be one of the best American examples of the English barleywine stye. It's approahable, supple, and satisfying. Certainly worth seeking out!"
"Poured a amber/copper color with a small white head. Nose is sweet, caramel, hops, brown sugar. Taste is on the thinner side, medium bodied but tasty. Caramel, some fruits, piny hops, brown sugar. Mouthfeel is good, thinner and not really thick and sticky but tasty. Drinkability is good due to its taste and lack of full body."
"Drinkability= Easy drinking brew."
"Overall impression: This is very smooth - it has held up pretty well for the amount of time its been aged. I have had this fresh, and the hops make much more of an appearance - but the age smooths it out into something very different. This is definitely a smooth beer - if the snowstorm predicted for tonight shows up .. this will be the perfect match!"
"Marked 2008. Pours a dark amber in color, clear, with a small to average size light cram head that quickly fades. Aroma is some aged maltiness of raisins, sweet malt aroma, cherry sugar, and some peppery signs of alcohol strength. Little swirl in the glass brings out some very nice pruney aged malt aroma and a bit of leather. Taste follows with some caramel malt, a touch of raisin / prune, some breadiness and hints of citrus hops. Medium in body, somewhat lighter in mouthfeel than I expected but gets better as it warms. A decent alc bite and peppery hoppiness lead to a fairly drying finish, cutting thru any sweet coating."
"Overall: I doubt I will pick this one up again but is by no means bad. It would almost be a good stepping stone for getting into great barleywines like Bigfoot and Hog Heaven. The flavors are there but not the body."
"Initially this is way over carbonated, and the body is a little light for a Barley Wine. . Once it warmed up to cellar temp. and lost some of the carbonation it was a tasty English Style Barley Wine (sweeter, maltier, less hops)."
"Beautiful color of amber. Clear with an alright head, but tiny ringer. Smells malty hoppie, pretty much just the right blend of malt and hops. Ummmm good smooth hops. Taste is the same. good balance of malt and hops. Very nice blend. Good and tastie... Mouthfeel is good, smooth hop and malt after, just a good balance of great ingredients. Yum. Easy to drink. Not a couple of pints beer but good."
"22oz bomber 2006 consumed Nov. 06. Nice clear copper color with tan head. Aroma is light with roasted malts, sweeter caramel malts and an even lighter smell of hops. First taste is true Barleywine flavor. Like the aroma I get roasted and caramel malts. But also some dark cherry type fruitiness thrown in. There's also grapefruit hoppiness that's not too tart but a bit sweet. I also get a slight cotton candy like flavor. Nice tasting Barleywine."
"Interesting beer, it was ok, but thats it, nothing spectacular."
"Overall- This is a pretty good barley wine, with great balance and great mouth feel."
"Last evening as part of our Super Bowl get together we opened a 06 bottle that I had been saving. Brew poured to a dull orange color with a fair sized off white head that had some retention. The aroma mostly sweet and reminds me of caramel and fruit. Limited hop aroma is present, really had to fall off over the past 2 ½ years. The aromas are pleasant but seem to be very pedestrian. The flavor highlights a solid malt flavor that seems to be moderately roasted. Alcohol mixed with fruity flavors gives a pleasant flavor. Overall this brew was not bad, clearly mellowed over the past few years. Do feel that there are many better barleywine's out there so I am not sure I will be picking this one up in the future."
"Pours slightly hazy, brown with light tan head. Nose reminds me of dark berry pies, some birthday cake icing, and faint hops. Palate is very malty sweet, creamy raisin flavors, and finishes sweet and tart without a lot of alcohol warmth."
"D - It is okay. Not all that enjoyable or drinkable but not horrible either."
"D: With the exception of having to stare at it and try to smell it, it's a beer that I think is decent. Doesn't have the big appearance and intense tastes to keep me in it for too long."
"2008 vintage: Pours clear amber with virtually no head. Aroma is weak for a BW. I was really wanting something more in the nose than some faint sweetness of fruit. Palate is watery with non-existant carbonation Oh my god now I'm afraid to take a drink. Flavor is malty sweet with some earthy tones and fruits. The flavor saves this BW from a horrible review. I wish there was a little more depth in the flavor profile but it is still fairly drinkable. Hard to believe this is packing 10% abv ... hardly noticable. Overall a descent brew at 6 bucks not bad for a big beer. Not a waste of money but not nearly the best bw out there. Instead of dressing up the bottle they need to dress up the beer."
"D: Low on the drinkability factor. It masks the alcohol VERY well. However, the taste keeps me from wanting another."
"22 oz. bomber: This one pours a deep ruby color. There was no head on mine at all. The aroma was good, but a little light for a barleywine. Some dark fruits, caramel and hops come through. The taste is similar to the taste. It feels like a 10% beer, but the taste is a little light, but still decent. Somewhat sweet caramel taste with some bitterness. Decent enough, but there are many better ones."
"Drinkability: the last Barley wine I had kicked my ass through my mouth- this one was much more amicable, altho' perhaps a bit mild for the style. I'd have a couple if there was somebody around to share 'em."
"D= high but its tearin me up fast. Quite the warmer. Nothing to write home about but I'm happy I tried this beer."
"Vigorous pour and yet no head at all. Bummer! Smells grassy with citrus notes - nice. It tastes like a dry barleywine. You get all of the flavors of, say, Alesmith - only without the cloying sweetness. It's really weird, actually, that it doesn't have more of a malt profile. Well, and it doesn't have a big hop profile, either. An interesting aftertaste like drinking a really sweet barleywine. Yet so dry. I just can't figure this one out. Crazy. Anyway, WAY too dry for a barleywine. Holy cow, is it ever dry. Dry dry dry. Whoa. Very interesting and certainly worth a try but wow. Crazy weird. Drinks like a session ale. Actually, it comes across like an overly dry session ale. If I let it warm some more... Yeah. Weird."
"D - just too sweet; not bad overall"
"Without enough hops to balance the sweetness this just doesn't go down very smoothly fresh, and based on the boring malt profile I'm guessing age wouldn't do it much good either. After the beer warms a bit the alcohol starts to shout, I had a hard time finishing the last glass."
"Overall: Aside from the half and hour it took to open it (wax did make it look sexy), this was a smooth winter warmer. Barleywine? I dont think so. Save some cash"
"M/D - Chewy mouth with little carbonation to help wash it down. Fruit flavors and bitterness vanish, leaving your mouth with nothing but the lingering taste of alcohol, making it hard to take another sip. I probably won't have this again..."
"Despite all this beers shortcomings (lack of balance, hops and carbonation), for some reason, I can still enjoy it. Maybe its the fact that I enjoy Barleywines in the winter, but this beer is still warm and inviting."
"2007. Clear amber color with some initial head that settles down to small patches. The aroma here is sweet malts, some alcohol surfacing with a faint dark fruit character. The beer tastes sweet with dark fruits and roasted malts along with some peppery spiciness. Finishes with a lot of molasses. Aftertaste is a little sour but mostly bland and at this point I keep trying to figure out what's missing. Not bad but the flavors do seem a tad unbalanced. Perhaps it needs to be aged."
"This is a Barley Wine with the mute button pressed. Not nearly as much depth as we expected, and quite dull compared to the other American brewed Barley Wines out there. Killer Penguin? More like Dead Penguin."
"D: Not high, simply because of the extremes in alcohol and hop bitterness. A 22oz is perfect."
"poured out brownish-red wih a decent off white head. showed carbonation.caramel malt is strongest flavor. initially haad a bitter hops taste which became smoother as it breathed. Can be enjoyed alone but also tasted well with food. would not go searching for it but would have it again."
"Pours caramel colored with no lasting head. Smell is caramel and vanilla all the way. Taste is caramel, vanilla, and some nice hops to balance out the sweetness. Relatively thin bodied, but drinkable and smooth. Balanced, yet slightly caramel forward barley wine. No signs of the 10% which was nice. Not fantastic, but definitely still enjoyable."
"D: Good solid barley wine style and good drinkability for 10.0 abv. a sweet barley that is smooth and refined."
"I'll be interested to see what time does for this beer."
"Wow, I remeber not being to impressed with this one fresh, but after only three years this one has really gone downhill."
"Drinkability - this is a decent ale, but its high abv limits its sessionability."
"I don't dislike or really like it. It goes down easy which isn't really a plus for a barleywine. None of the flavors is really blow away. I really want more complexity or excitement out of a barleywine."
"Good, rich, creamy mouthfeel with a hefty 10% ABV which is well masked behind an intricate combination of bold flavors... Recommended..."
"Cheers!"
"Maybe I've been spoiled by Bigfoot, but this one just did not do it for me. Has a nice, deep amber red appearance and this layer of foam, but things do downhill from there. The caramel malt aroma is very faint and the same caramel malt flavor is decent. But the depth of flavors and complexity are just not there. Certainly not bad, but nothing to get excited about. This would be a nice starter barleywine for someone who is not used to bigger beers."
"Drinkability: A little hot, a little harsh when first released, I've got some bottles of the '06 in the cellar which will soon be joined by the '07 vintage for a long, quiet, much needed rest."
"D - average drinkability"
"d: I've recently been buying some ""killer"" barleywines based on their names with mixed results. Chicken Killer wasn't very good, Cereal Killer was pretty tasty, and lastly this one which borders on great."
"Served in my DFH snifter (sniffed her, I hardly knew her ;). Poured a brownish-red with ruby highlights as the light hit the glass. Absolutely no head, but thin slick of foam and suds. Strong scent of fermented dark fruit (plum, cherries, raisins, prunes) and alcohol with a hint of caramel or toffee. Nose seemed a little off; somewhat reminiscent of a cordial or liqueur, but a little too sickly sweet. Taste similar to nose, lots of dark fruit and alcohol with a touch of honey and perhaps clove. Lively mouthfeel, surprisingly so considering the lack of a head. Tart, boozy finish. Not bad, but I'm not digging the smell on this one; not skunked but just off and it really negatively impacted the overall experience for me."
"Overall: I have had this one on draft and enjoyed it so much more. Today the taste is somewhat lacking with the alcohol and sweetness being dominate. If there is another bottle in the beer store on my next trip I will pick it up and let it age a bit to see how it fares with time."
"D: Its nice to find a pre-aged barleywine from an American brewer. Old Ruffian is another that comes to mind (at least OR *tastes* pre-aged). Very tasty and enjoyable and im glad i picked it up."
"I picked this up at Blue Max during a post-Christmas beer run (i.e. my presents to myself). It's a solid barleywine, not as bitter as I like but still quite good. I've got one more Boulder ""Looking Glass"" beer to go, hope it's as good as the others."
"The name of this beer is a bit misleading but it ain't bad."
"2007 edition, bomber pours a mostly clear chestnut body with a beige head that falls into a cap and film. Malty aroma of toffee and caramel with a hint of grapefruity hops. Medium body with subdued carbonation. Taste features toffee and caramel, almost chewy. Red apple notes add a nice complexity. Hop bitterness is understated, but adds some pine and grapefruit. Decent barleywine, but the malty backbone tilts toward the English style."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid barleywine that is definitely recommended."
"Overall: A decent barleywine? Not your daddys BW, thats for sure. Pretty extreme yet without being really distinctive. Worth a try, but I wouldnt go out of my way to sample one again. Theres (much) better out there."
"A bit less complex and ""big"" as most barleywines, but it's a great introductory to the style. Everything barleywine is there, in more moderate terms. Feels a bit like a heavy set english strong ale, with tendencies towards american barleywine. A couple more years on this, and it'll be smooth as can be. Thanks Boulder. Happy Holidays to me!"
"Clear amber color with a tan head. Good retention and minimal lacing. Strong sweet malts with cirtus hops. Hints of vanilla, caramel and honey. Again a very sweet taste with some floral hops. Good warming alcohol and more sweet malts and sugars. Full body and silky mouthfeel. Well balanced and quite drinkable. Needs a few years of aging."
"Will be looking for this again and am looking forward to see how this ages."
"D: I really wanted to like this one, due in part to the nice packaging, but I just don't. I don't expect to finish the bomber."
"Drinkability is good this is a pretty enjoyable brew even if miss labeled. Want to thank merlin48 for sending this treat to me."
"2007 vintage. Pours a dark amber in color, clear, with a small to average size light cram head that quickly fades. Aroma is some aged maltiness of raisins, sweet malt aroma, cherry sugar, and some peppery signs of alcohol strength. Little swirl in the glass brings out some very nice pruney aged malt aroma and a bit of leather. Taste follows with some caramel malt, a touch of raisin / prune, some breadiness and hints of citrus hops. Medium in body, somewhat lighter in mouthfeel than I expected but gets better as it warms. A decent alc bite and peppery hoppiness lead to a fairly drying finish, cutting thru any sweet coating. Good beer, I hope some of the great aromas come thru in the taste as this one ages."
" I love barleywine's and this one is pretty dang good."
"D: This is a solid barleywine, and quite tasty at that! I really enjoyed it, and I have a few more waiting for me for sometime in the future."
"D - Yikes, period."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin in my opinion for the style and taste. That said it is very smooth and creamy with the subdued carbonation. Drinkability is hindered by the obtrusive nature of the alcohol flavors. I don't think any aging would serve to smooth this out any better as the bottle indicates it has already been aged a year. A fancy bottle for a slightly above average drink, but kudos for giving a go for something slightly off the beaten path. I wasn't turned off, but I was looking for better."
"Amber color with orange/red highlights and some beige lace pools and ring. Tropical fruits, bubble gum, vanilla, toffee malts, and resinous hops. Subtleness early on with notes of earthy nutty malts, twangy to minty character, and herbal tea hops. Peppery bitterness in the middle and piny hop oils on its tail. Caramel notes and chocolate malt notes fade in and out. The finish is dry, burnt sugars, a tad twangy minty. Full body, medium mouthfeel thats semi-smooth, and carbonation is right there. A lot of stuff going on here, just not sure it all goes together. A year has done it well and another year might take care of rest."
"Drinkability: Despite its flaws, this barleywine is drinking nicely now; just wish the flavor matched the aroma"
"I want to say the body is watery but that really isnt it. The malt is just lacking complexity. Especially for a Barleywine."
"Killer Penguin Barleywine (2006) pours a light reddish copper color with a thick off white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle that was wax dipped. The aroma is on the hoppy side, but the malt does make an appearance. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but it's okay. Hops come up first, then the malt fades in, but I have to say, I took a big swig and I could definitely taste the alcohol in the middle/toward the end. It has a bit of an aftertaste that I really can't quite put my finger on, but it's not especially pleasant (I suspect it may just be the alcohol mixed in with the malt flavors). Overall, this is a decent barleywine, but not outstanding."
"The aroma of this beer started out down-right wrong, but seemed to correct itself after being allowed to breath for a bit. Luckily by the time I got to the taste, the really weird funky notes had almost all but disappeared, if they were ever noticeable. In the end this beer is quite a bit more enjoyable that I had feared; part of this may have been my initial low expectations and the fact that the aroma started out so poorly; the beer recovered though and has become quite a tasty tipple. The lesson, definitely let this beer sit for a while after you pour it to give it a chance to breath and open up."
"A pleasant, full flavored Barleywine still quite young. This would benefit greatly by laying it down for another year."
"poured from a 22 oz. bottle with a wax seal color is a clear reddish copper with a half inch beige head that faded quickly to just the beer with minimal lacing. aromas of sweet caramel malt and alcohol mixing with slightly spiced hops. slightly fruity up front turning to malty caramel then the alcohol sneaks in to warm the finish. mouthfeel is light and carbonation fades to almost flat. i liked it because the alcohol is not up front in your face it sort of sneaks in there. good for one or two."
"Quite a dry brew right from the beginning. Pretty decent malt background. Syrupy and thick with a caramel sweetness that's a bit subdued. Hop notes are there and can be detected by the spicyness on the tongue. Well balanced with neither the malts or hops taking command. Bitterness in the finish dries out the tongue. Sweetness in the finish is quite a bit actually. Subtle, but qu9ite powerful at 10%. Sipping beer that'll bite you in the ass if you drink it too fast."
"Nothing bad here, but nothing interesting either. I was expecting a fireplace sipper, but this is just too laid back in every respect. Disappointing after Hazed & Confused and Mojo."
"It was decent, definitely worth trying, but there are better Barley Wines out there."
"Pours a two finger, cream head that slowly fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Nose is like an oak barrel. Clear deep amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is malty with background hops, sour grapefruit finish. Disappointing barleywine. 2006 vintage, $6.20 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Body is a modest medium, with a nice creamy texture and OK drinkability. An easily forgettable Barleywine that just blends into the landscape."
"Bottle courtesy of Beerandblues2: Poured a clear medium amber color ale with a small foamy head with limited retention. Aroma of bitter hops is dominating with some notes of alcohol and sugar. Taste is way too hoppy for my own taste in barleywine with some medium sugar and light alcohol peak. Body is slightly too light with some medium carbonation. Overall, I thought this was too hoppy and bitter and generally lacking some character."
"2006 vintage. Pours a fairly light caramel (for a barleywine anyways). Not much head, although decent lacing. First taste was moderately hoppy with frankly a thinnish malt backbone. It doesnt seem to have the creamy mouthfeel Im looking for in this style. That being said, its quite drinkable. Not one of those slow sippers. Finish is dry with some tobacco notes. Overall- decent brew for a cold snowy day like today."
"Pours a big thick head that falls into a swirlly cirrus cloud head with almost no lacing. The color is a deep light brown color. The smell is a bit sour, but still has the same characteristics that remind me of a barleywine. The mouthfeel is the best feature, pretty nice. Overall it was good to try."
"The key word for this brew is balance. Nothing was dominant. The downside of this was nothing about the Killer Penguin was truly outstanding. There wasn't enough in the nose to draw me in. The body was too light for my tastes. It's a respectable beer, but not a special one."
"The most overposted beer on BA in the past six months. Overhyped?, great pubilicity?, too fancy?, too ridiculous? All apply in some form. Unfortunatley for this beer it followed the end of a two year old bomber of Smutty Wheat Wine. Bland taste, first and foremost, stale and not definative characteristics to speak of. Nose, decent, slightly fruity and that's it. Went down pretty darn easy for a 10%er."
"A good representation of the style. The alcohol i sthere, but not overwhelming, The pour was an excellent dark copper with a good head for the high abv. Lacing was also better than one might expect. Smell is deciving, because the taste differs somewhat. I detected a good amount of floral hoppiness with a light spice undertone. Taste however, was mainly sweetish, malty and with good alcohol notes. Hop flavor was lightly understated. Mouthfeel was syupry, but not cloyingly so. Fairly smooth. For the high abv, drinkability was good as long as it is sipped to appreciate the varied qualities."
"D- It is a very interesting brew. The more I drink I think it grows on me more and more. It is different than your average barley wine. I like the dry taste to most beers but I think this just might be a bit much. Overall it's a good beer and a interesting one at that."
"This was a sneaky 10% alcohol brew that ereally wasn't a great barley wine, not a bad beer tho""."
"Overall it's just about exactly what I remember of the '05. Amazing head and overall appearance, good taste and smell, and the alcohol will sneak up on you if you're not ready for it. Damn good barleywine."
"Thin & watery for a Barley. I'd like too try this fresh."
"I'm going to agree with some of the other reviews and say this beer was good, but weak-tasting for a barley wine. It was very drinkable and mellow for the style. It had a sweet, punch-like aroma and tasted of sweet fruity malts with some citrusy hops like an American barleywine should."
"Cheers and Holiday Beers Joe!!"
"Drinks pretty good with for the abv/style. I enjoyed this way more than last years! This strikes a great balance between english & american style IMO. This really warms you up! Will lay a bottle down for later."
"Rather thin for a barleywine. Flavors mimic the smell, with too much of the welch's character coming through, and almost wrecking this one for me (I hated Welch's as a child). Alcohol burn is apparent in the finish. I really cannot recommend this one, as it falls short of what I've come to expect out of a barleywine. There are better examples out there, seek those, avoid this."
"With a 10% abv one shouldn't drink more than one of these bad bombers."
"This offering from Boulder Beer pours a dark caramel, ruby clear body, with just a touch of carbonated bubbles that leave a thin head spotchy and thin. The aroma is sweet caramel, toffee, bready, marshmellow. The taste starts smooth, nutty, tangy, sweet, with a barely a notice of that 10% abv it is touting. The finish is nice again you get a toffee, slightly herbal hoppy finish, that warms you up and can cap the night off as a great digestif."
"Let me start by saying its a nice looking bottle with the red wax and 2006 embossed in it but damn its a pain in the arss to get into.Poured into a snifter a deep clear amber with a tight formed slight off white head that stuck like glue to the glass leaving a thick sheet of lace as it settled very slowly.Big complex aromas hit ya up front juicy fruity malt and a big piney hop presence but it fades quickly keeping me from giving it a higher score its great but fades to quickly.I have seen other reviews and expected a big sweet malty bomb but its not at all that nice fruitiness and brown sugar melds into hefty dry resiny piney hoppiness that lingers in the finish.As it warms I get a roasted nut presence upfront more but the hops come thru nicely,sure it might be a bit thin but damn it goes down easy,this has quite a hop profile and its quite brash,damn tasty and better than expected."
"i mean, it's not awful by any means. but for something dressed up in such a snazzy red-and-wood suit, you'd expect luxury. what you get is a quick, palatable buzz with no showpower."
"PS - Just noticed I gave the same scores to last year's version. Guess they've got consistency down pretty well!"
"Pour was fine  clear oak brown with a small tan head. Aroma of aromatic pine and barley kinda set me back. The bottle says this was conditioned for 6 months, but it was still very green. Pine and citrus dominates, and a phenolic finish dampened my enthusiasm for this lil birdy."
"Good taste but too grainy for me, nice color and appearance, decent barleywine but not my style."
"D-This is a nice beer. Great aroma and nice flavor. I'd purchase it again but it wouldn't rate as one of my all-time greats."
"Overall- A respectable beer. 1 bomber is enough for me, but definitely an enjoyable beer to chill out and sip."
"wouldn't buy it again with so many better offerings out there."
"2006 vintage, cool looking red wax seal. Poured into my snifter. I poured it a bit agressively expecting not much head. A pretty good head though..attractive Although it didn't last long. A bit of lace which I kept going with frequent swirling. Clear semi dark amber with a red hue. Smells of apples and some alcohol. You would never know it is 10% ABV. Very smooth for the strength. Tastes a little like faint apple cider, a little malty. Hoppy as well, with very little bitterness. I don't have much experience with barley wines, but this one seems very different from what I've tried. Very drinkable."
"Verdict: an unconventional take on barleywines, was good, and suprisingly easy to drink, but lacked complexity, wasn't packed with flavor. Sweet and fruity but not a lot of layers to the flavor."
"I'd recommend seeking this one out now."
"Drinkability: a solid barleywine here. Worth finding this and giving it a try."
"Aroma is a hoppy citrus with a slight tinge of alcohol and a strong sweetness. Taste is light and hoppy, mild for a barleywine. Warming opens the palate up a lot, the malt becomes more prominent and the hops keep coming through, seemingly more balanced than when at a cooler temp. This light ruby barleywine is definatly mild, with a medium-ish body lacking the explosive punch of others in the style. Flavors seem to hit targets on the palate rather than coat it with complex flavors. Three or four pours off this bomber into the snifter, and I could drink more... very drinkable."
"A hopped up barleywine, with some malt. Style bender. Great bubbly head on dark dark brown body.Citrus, fruit, alcohol, active carbonation. Different sweetness but not an exemplary barleywine. Wasn't the night for it to shine, and I do not know if I will give it another chance."
"I'll admit, I was predisposed to like this because of the cool name, but it's good on its own merits. It's nicely complex, capably blended, and a pleasant quaff. The ABV is muscular and never shy about flexing, but the warming nature makes it worthwhile. So it drinks well, if cautiously. It's a killer penguin with happy feet, and so I smile."
"A pretty solid Barleywine. Could be better, but I was enamored enough by its easy going comfort level and smoothness to keep my glass filled and drinking it down with ease."
"Easily one of the better Barley Wine's I've had, very recommended."
"D--This is going to be hard to find so if you see it, buy it, treasure it, and enjoy."
" Body is smooth and creamy, although a just a touch thin. Must be one of the best-disguised 10+% beers around, cuz I don't taste much alcohol at all. While the palate is a little lacking, the overall drinking experience is thoroughly enjoyable."
"Easy to drink which is not something I deem a good quality in a barleywine. I havent been too impressed with this beer but it has been solid throughout. There isnt much memorable about it. I like it and I am happy to drink any barleywine. I wouldnt have gotten the opportunity to try Killer Penguin without Todd and Steph, thanks for the bomber!"
"This beer hides its 10% alcohol rather well. It's smooth and rather easy to drink for a barleywine. Must be due to the 6 month aging process of each bottle."
"Drinkability is pretty solid, good overall flavors and meshing together of some unique flavors for a BW. Almost a BW lite, not meant to be demeaning but it s good twist on the style."
"Drinkability and Overall: A nice offering from Boulder, but so malty it reminds me more of an old ale than a barleywine. No hop presence at all. Once it's all said and done though, it's a nice tasting brew, that goes down easily."
"DA: Highly drinkable! I don't often find a barley wine that is this friendly. This one came well recommended (thanks Beerpanther!) and I would do the same. :-)"
"good drinkability with a well hidden 10% abv. a somewhat unique barelywine that serves as a welcome break from the ordinary."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a wonderful malty scent that boasts of crystal, roasted, and bisquit malts. It has a nice burnt toffee scent with a sweet, yet warm breadlike aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy and warms on the finish. It has a toasted flavor with breadlike hints. This is one tastey brew. It's loaded with malts and is quite complex. The mouthfeel is great. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good barleywine. It's good great aroma and a wonderful taste; a fine seasonal."
"First sip reveals a chewy syrupy body with nice viscosity, it goes down fairly easy but coats my mouth and palate after each swallow. Flavor is similar to nose, very fruity and malty with red grape, raisins, plums and brown sugar. I even think I find some maple syrup in the back. Very easy to drink with just a faint hit of booze on the finish. A nice malty barleywine that seems to be in the ENglish style more than American. I like it!"
"Drinkability: I would have no problem draining this bomber, and being satisfied, but not my favorite barleywine, still, pretty good,"
"Flavor is licorice cough syrup. Bit of a turn-off. reminds me of when my Mom would force some nasty cold medicine down my throat as a kid. Strong malt presence that gave a very sweet, candy backbone. Kind of a syrupy mouthfeel too. Some chemical-like hops provide a sense of balance. Alcohol provides heat and the Robitussim flavor. Medium body with that syrupy feel I mentioned a couple of sentences ago."
"An enjoyable brew that packs a nice warming buzz and fills the belly with a ton of calories, imbueing the drinker with a sense of peace and well-being. Try it!"
"Overall, not very impressive. I had this once before and liked it better then."
"Gotta love the name and bottle though. One of my favorite names of all time."
"For a 10% barley wine the beer is incredibly drinkable. Very little hint of its strength in the nose or the taste. Well-rounded, smooth, and filling. Slightly warming, and very enjoyable. One of my favorite barley wines to date."
"The flavor is caramel malts and bread, with a sweet sugar taste as well as a bit of spicy hops. It is full bodied and tasty, not a bad winter brew."
"This menacing bird turns out to be a pussycat, but a very tasty one. I like it, though it doesn't resemble my favorite barleywines, it's a resfreshing change, and one still stocked with character. I'll enjoy this all night long."
"2005 Bottle: Pours dark reddish amber with a medium thin beige head that lasts pretty well. Thin, stringy lacing. Aroma of malt and raisins. Not very full-bodied considering the ABV, with malt and spice flavors primarily, along with a touch of dark fruit. The finish is kind of syrupy and sweet. All in all this one just didnt seem to come together for me."
"2005 version, a ""Looking Glass"" series beer in a bomber bottle with a very annoying wax seal over the cap and down the neck. Clear dark copper appearance, spidery yellowish head of no size or duration. Just dots for lace. Caramel nose, underlying hops give a citrus tone. Carbonation is low, mouthfeel is full and fairly lush. Good taste, starts with a brown sugar and fruit impression and transitions into a hoppiness that is apparent but not as excessive and prickly as many North American Barleywines. Overall, there's kind of a fresh fruit cobbler sense to this beer, slight green raisins as well. Still, clocking in at 10% ABV, its got some girth to it. A nice beer that doesn't brutalize the mouth or back up in your throat. At the top of the drinkability range for Barleywines, IMO..."
"A wonderfully tasty barley wine. I think I will start a new tradition this year and tuck a few of these away in the cellar."
"Bomber provided by Eyedrinkale, ala BIF20, in July 2005. Refridgerated and consumed a couple weeks later. Thanks for the opportunity. I was quite surprised to see this pour as rusty nail colored as, from the description on the bottle, I was expecting an imperial stout. Has a half finger light tanish head over a nearly clear liquid. A couple very tiny streams of bubbles reace to the top. Smells rich malty caramel with pine-sol hops and alcohol. Oh, yummy, it's an american strong ale! Tastes sour malt and sour hoppy with an underlying sweet and a dandy bitter-sweet aftertaste. The draw is pine-sol hoppy with some fruity undertones (oranges, necatarine, canned pear syrup). The transfer from pull to swallow is malty honey-sweet with noticable alcohol and decent carb release. The swallow is grassy hop with rough carb release and the sweetness has settled. The aftertaste is a mix of hop/malt sour with caramel swirled in alcohol and sweet fruity ester that's driving me insane. Goodness, Mike sent me a well cellared beer that I see still improving for a year or two. Damn me for my pre-mature consumption. But, it's pretty tasty as is. Body is only medium, but it does have some silky thick-sugar qualities. Carbonation is moderate when cold, but mild and quite nice at warmer temperatures."
"Well balanced and satisfying in almost every department. Seek this one out."
"Killer Penguin is a great name and the label ensures that the empty bomber will be a keeper. The beer is pretty damn good too. I hope that rumors of the Penguin's demise have been exaggerated (its absence on the brewery's website is not encouraging) because it'd be a shame if this is both my first and last bottle of this quality beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Beautiful coloring, amber/rootbeer... creamy, off-white head. Vineous and hoppy scented. Great hoppy bites with alot of carbination. Smooth mouthfeel. Bit of vanilla in there. Alcohol is lightly noticable, but not overwhelming. Decent amount of carbination in this one, but it really is not too much that it makes it uncomfortable to drink."
"Taste was pretty much the same only sweeter. Strong malt presence but followed by a nice hop power . Not too overwhelming. The finish has almost a sugary but nice flavor. A pleasant beer to drink. I imagine I'll by another as it goes down smooth. A very balanced beer."
"This is a very drinkable winter beer. However, it would not be my first choice. If they could enhance the flavor and the body, I think they would have an excellent beer."
