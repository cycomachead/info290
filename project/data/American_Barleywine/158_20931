I normally get a raisin sweetness from a barleywine, but the prevalent bitter notes made it more like honey.  Very well made, but as it warmed, the bitterness became too strong for my palate.","gibgink","Yesterday at 04:56 AM"

I agree with comments about excessively bitter finish though. Available in 4-packs of 12 oz bottles, which is a huge plus for me...I hate that barleywines are so often reserved for special-markup bombers. Will definitely purchase at least twice/year if available.","MartyMaltose","Mar 30, 2015"

4.3,2.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/19/2012. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, light pine, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, leather, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus hops and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, leather, grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, leather, grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding American barleywine at this age. All around awesome complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. Nearly perfectly balanced between hop and malt flavors right now. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 14, 2015"

Poured at a good temperature with modest, thick, slightly slow to settle, cream/light tan colored head and some lace. Color is a brown, orange amber that's a tad hazy. With the pouring came some heady wafts of fresh hop. Flavor is outstanding, tang and bitter up front, tang drops off, very slightly sweet, lots of resin, a little citrus. Body is excellent and while carbonation is a touch soft, it doesn't seem to hurt. Finish is like flavor, lots of booze, and long. Great beer for sipping and/or sharing.","drpimento","Dec 30, 2013"
3.58,-15,4.75,4.25,3.5,2.25,3.25,"O - A little disappointing. The flavor could use a little more depth and complexity, and the body was surprisingly thin. It's possible the bottle didn't age well, so I will definitely be trying a fresh bottle of this beer as soon as I can.","vfgccp","Dec 29, 2013"

Taste follows right in line with the smell, just stronger. Nice and rich, bold even, but manages to do so without feeling the slightest bit heavy. Smooth and filling in the mouth, warms as it goes down. ..Everything I love about a barley wine, personally. I will note that I pulled it out to sit a good 30-40 minutes before I poured it, and I don't think it would have been nearly as good right out the fridge. Sipping slowly, it's only gotten better as it warms. Overall, this one is going straight to the top of my list. Great Divide has yet to disappoint me, and this is no exception.

Citrus and pine hoparomas are initially pungent but quickly mellow. Medium to full bodied with light carbonation and a pleasantly smooth feel. Sweet caramel and bready malt flavors up front followed by tangy citrus and pine hop flavors through the middle. Finishes with spicy herbal, citrus and pine hop bitterness with a malty sweetness beneath - not to mention the requisite, yet pleasantly mellow booziness. A wonderfully balanced barleywine.

There are some nice caramel notes lurking in there, but it’s just not all that enjoyable right now. Aroma is caramel malt and citric hops. Sweet sugar cane, apricots and an acetone/metal note also show up. The taste is sweet leading to harsh. Lots of caramel malt flavor is packed into this beer. Mouthfeel is fairly sticky. Appearance is a darkened amber with an off-white to beige head. At any rate, I imagine a vintage bottle would get higher marks. Also, I’m sorta down on barleywines, right now, so I’ll give this one another try in the future.","popery","Jan 26, 2013"

4.87,15.7,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.75,"Overall: Right away I have to say that I enjoyed this much more with a year on this than fresh a year ago. Don’t get me wrong, this a great barley wine when it is fresh but I believe that this is much more enjoyable when the fruit, malt, and hops are equal to each other, the rough-edged characteristics smooth out and round-off, the overall complexities increase and the alcohol nearly disappears. This is a top-notch barley wine that I will recommend to anybody that is a fan of the style. Add a couple bottles to your cellar and be amazed at what a year or more can do to a barley wine!","Stoutfan23DJ","Jan 14, 2013"

4.53,7.6,4.25,5,4.25,4.75,4.5,"I'm gonna come right out with it - this is my first barleywine ale, so not totally sure what to expect. It pours nicely, and came away with a 3/4"" head that disappated in a couple of minutes leaving larger, soapy-looking bubbles. Beautiful red-orange in color when held up to the light, and also totally clarified. I'd expected some suspended bits or murkiness in there, but there's nothing. I can see right through to the other side of the glass. It initially smells overwhelmingly like Red Vines to me, oddly; then breaks up into fig, strawberry, cherry chapstick, and molasses. Flowery, very sweet. No noticeable alcohol on the nose, and some underlying yeast. I'm really just bowled over by the nose - definitely a lot there! Tasting exposes the alcohol, as well as some hop bitters, and I very much get strawberries, cherries, and molasses. Honestly, I'm not super-psyched about the flavor. It's really good, but I've had some winter ales (Hibernation being one, go figure) that are similar, and I was just hoping for something different. Mouthfeel is what you'd expect from a big brew like this, but it's well done and not so punchy as you might think. It's actually pretty smooth. Overall, I think this is a great beer. Very complex aromas and flavors, and I'll definitely be investigating this style more. I probably wouldn't buy this one again, though it is enjoyable, fairly priced at $8 for a bomber here, and I'm happy to have tried it.","BeerWizard","Jan 12, 2013"

4.32,2.6,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from bottle into CBS snifter. Looks like dark brown rain water. Some decent head, still some carbonation present. Appearance of an English Barleywine. Smell- sweet molasses and caramel. Toffee, faint plastic in the background- but it doesn't detract too much. A great smelling beer, I am guessing that I am probably sniffing the remnants of the hops. Vanilla is also present. Taste- whoa. cocoa, roasted caramel/toffee, vanilla. This is mellow and delicous, and I am amazed at the surprising chocolate and creme brule taste profile. The hops have mellowed and the malt has developed a very nice complex profile. For the ABV, I get no booze at all. In fact, its scary how quick this can go down. I've had this beer fresh, and its abrasive and super hoppy. In fact, I didn't like it fresh. This is great though, I was glad to try it. Thanks again Matt!","lnashsig","Apr 26, 2012"

Smell is big carmel, brown sugar, pine hops, and some dark fruit. Taste is all of that, but larger with more pine and grapefruit hops then the nose would have you expect. Body is large, wonderful amount of carbonation, more lush than dry, and very drinkable for its large body and ABV.

4.13,-1.9,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall this is one of the best American Barleywines out there. Not quite up to the level of the Alaskan Barleywine which I consider the top, but really close. Really nice flavor profile, pine/citrus bitterness to complement the sweet caramel/toffee maltiness. Just a great showing overall. (This beer once again helps to prove my theory that American Barleywines peak at 2 years of age, so I will continue to follow that practice of waiting until that maturity date to sample going forward and recommend all to do the same for maximum enjoyment.) Definitely a must try for fans of the style and another high quality brew from Great Divide.","claspada","Apr 12, 2012"

I've had the bottle for at least a year so I think that's the correct bottling date. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark reddish/amber color with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like dark fruit (prunes, raisins), brown sugar, pine hops, caramel malt and some sherry. For the most part it tastes just like the aroma, but there's also a slight bitter taste that I don't care for. It doesn't seem like a hoppy bitter flavor, there just seems something a little bit off about it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit chewy and has good carbonation. Overall I think it's a good enough brew. I'll have to try this again in the future, maybe a fresher (or older) bottle will be better.","bluejacket74","Feb 19, 2012"

As the beverage warmed the scent calmed and allowed toffee notes and dark fruits to poke through. The tasting followed the scent exactly.

4.45,5.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"2011 vintage in a Ommegang flute. Pours a deep red-orange amber. Thin persistent very light tan head fine and medium bubble head and light lacing. Aroma of spicy caramel malt, dark fruit, herbal hops and a hint of oxidation. Piney hops and sweet malt dominate the flavor with dark dried fruit and a light fruit or fruit esters component and light citrus. Nice medium mouth feel with some creaminess. The alcohol is still hot, but the pleasant combination of flavors keeps this tasty. A prototypical well made American barley wine. Tasted side by side with a 2009 in a Nostradamus flute. The 2009 has mellowed very nicely. A thicker, finer head with massive lacing. Aroma is more subdued, but still has the sweet malt, dark fruit and a hint of hops. Flavor is caramel malt, dark fruit and a hint of citrus, nicely integrated. Flavors have mellowed over time, but have combined very nicely. Body is incredibly heavy bodied and creamy.

This is by FAR the most hop forward nose on any barleywine I've poured. If I'd been blindfolded on this, I'd have thought this a boozy IPA. The nose is riddled with hops and just the faintest hint of malt. It just doesn't have a nose that resembles what I've come to associate with a barleywine. The first sip and the hops jump right out at you. Some maltiness comes into the picture immediately after the hops depart. Again, there's a subtle woodiness to this, but it's not a mainstay. This is the most bizarre example of a barleywine I've had. At this point, nothing in either the nose or taste points to this being a barleywine. Granted, I don't mind it at all, and I find it enjoyable, but the grades are taking a bit of a hit as I'm grading this to style for a barleywine, and this thing is just...went rogue. The mouthfeel is boozy, with a high dose of bitterness. Again, I personally don't mind it, but I just don't expect this attribute from a barleywine. Overall, this is a solid beer, if it wasn't a barleywine. I feel it falls short of the style, however, and the experience is nothing like what I was looking forward to when I initially cracked the bottle. I can see myself coming back to this the next time I want a bold IPA.","Retail1LO","Dec 28, 2011"

In fact, what I enjoyed most about this beer is that is wasn't hefty, hop-forward, aggressive, bold, huge or massive. Instead, it was balanced, tasty, rich, malty, smooth and polite. It wasn't even very boozy, although it does pack a punch. True, it was a tad drier at the finish that I prefer, but I won't argue there.

I also get some ""smooth"" notes that makes it go down easy. Something like butter, I know it sounds weird but it's hard to explain.

There's way too much alcohol in the finish to make this an easy-drinker. It's a shame, because the rest of the beer is actually pretty good.

The taste is even better than the smell- WOW. This is a fantastic example of a Barley Wine Ale.. In fact, I can tell after one taste, it's the best I've had. The taste is perfect- thus the rare 5. Everything works really well together, the malt being the backdrop that holds it all together. Mouthfeel is great- hops come through here, but it's all very balanced, and goes down easy.

It was far too sweet and had a lot of molasses and candied sugars going on. The hops were still present but there was an onslaught of malt. This didn't really relate to any American Barleywines I've enjoyed in the past. It wasn't very good at all and left behind a bitter aftertaste. Like all of Great Divides beers it had the dry and sudsy mouthfeel, feeling like you had coated the inside of your mouth with soap.

Aroma has this raisin and fruit thing going on, with a subtle malt sweetness in the background. Taste is ... huge. (The label says hefty, and it might actually be appropriate in this case) The first sips let you know that there's a big hop profile on this one, with a lingering bitterness that I associate more with IPAs than the Barleywine style. This has to be dry-hopped. I'm amazed that a beer this old can have this much hop presence. Impressive. Beyond the hops is this great, caramel-toffee malt backbone that holds everything up. As the beer warms and opens up there's this very nice raisin and fruitcake sweetness that comes out the more you drink it. There's some alcohol burn on the way down, though it's not unpleasant and certainly something you kind of expect with the style. Overall this is a hefty and hoppy (borrowing from the label) example of the American Barleywine style.","eclaycamp","Dec 11, 2010"

Head eventually disperses towards the edges, leaving a broken slick and a thin band around the bowl. Some delicate spots and strands of lacing were revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses toffee, dark fruit, a hint of cocoa and a suggestion of booze. Taste consistent with nose; however a hops presence cuts through the malty sweetness and lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a light carbonation and a slightly oily/viscous quality across the tongue. Definitely one of the more enjoyable American Barleywines I've tried. Hops presence is not too overwhelming and nicely cuts the malty sweetness. Also, the alcohol is incrediblly well-hidden. Delicious and dangerously drinkable.","Jwale73","Nov 17, 2010"

The taste pummels the tongue with a strong citrus-hop-based bitterness, with leather, figs, rubber, light cocoa, tobacco, spinach stems, and a vodka-like character all aiding and abetting in this assault. It's all a bit much, frankly. The body is pretty hefty, with a light carbonation and a fairly chewy feel. Overall, this is a beast that must be sipped carefully, lest the fury truly be unleashed.

The mouthfeel is rather destructive on the tongue, the astringent nature of this beer is a little off-putting, but it's still smooth as far as the viscosity is concerned.

The hop flavor has mostly faded, but a rather potent bitterness is present, a blend of hops and grain, with a little burnt sugar thrown in for good measure. The finish is excellently balanced with sweetness and bitterness present in appropriate amounts, and the tobacco adding complexity. Great flavors and balance here, this beer is full in body and has soft carbonation and a great finish. An excellent barleywine, one I'm going to enjoy sipping over the course of the evening.

Kinda tastes like hoppy orange peels. There's a tobacco flavor mixed in there, too. Definitely a few flavors I've tasted before, but not combined like this. The body is medium-thin, kinda throws me off a little. There's not enough carbonation to make up for it.

4.18,-0.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours a deep rich amber color with a huge khaki colored head that left some gorgeous fat rings of lacing down the pint glass. Yep, hop-forward indeed. The initial nose on this one is all hops, mostly the American varieties which impart the standard grapefruit and pine notes, but there is some caramel buried deep down, maybe some fruitiness, but as far as I can tell, this is all hops. Flavor changes the mood. Delicious, deeply caramelized sugars, molasses, and dark fruit reminiscent of plum and raisin make up a bulk of the malt profile, but it's extremely well balanced by the bitter, pithy, grapefruit rind hop flavor. I was expecting this to be hoppier than it is, but it was brewed in December of 09, so it's had the chance to fade a bit, which I think has done this beer some justice. I don't think I could handle anymore bitterness as I like my barleywines to be malt-forward. There's a touch of chocolaty flavor in there as well, but it's hard to tell with everything else going on. Body is thick an creamy, light carbonation, with the hop bite detracting from this quality only minimally. A great tasting beer, but the alcohol makes itself known and one bomber is more than enough for me. Great brewskie here and will enjoy sipping on it over the course of the next hour. Not my favorite ABW, but a damn good one.","KeefD","May 09, 2010"

As I poured more into my snifter after the initial half-glass, I thought I had consumed half the bottle already; I was quite mistaken, and as I poured the final two-thirds I realized my error.

Fairly tart. Mouth has a bit of acridity to it but has a nice body. Full but not heavy. Drink is definitely good, but not great.

Then the hops show up, grapefruit, woody, pine. And then the bitterness kicks in. But it's a good bitterness bite mixed with spicy warm alcohol. The bitterness lingered for quite a while.

Good example, lends itself well too aging I'm guessing. I bet the oak and barrel aged versions of this are even better. I just tend to enjoy the malt inclined versions a little more.

4.38,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Out of a bottle this beer was an amber color with two-fingers of Dijon-mustard-colored head. The retention as a cap was very good and the lacing equally good; a great looking beer all around. The aroma was complex and appealing, caramel, toffee, alcohol, some rich esters, wood, hazelnuts, and candy sugar. The flavors were equally complex and beautifully balanced. I tasted lost of things starting with the sweetness of caramel malt, chocolate malt and honey. The fruity alcohol esters and well developed pine and herbal hops flavors concealed the alcohol well and helped the beer be unusually crisp for a barleywine. As it warmed it continued to develop and I definitely smelled more hops presence in the aroma. I really enjoyed the sweet-to-woody-to-bitter arc of the flavors. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation soft. The girl I shared this beer with, a suds-aficionado herself, agreed with me that this was a marvelously complex offering and the best barleywine either of us had ever had.","thekevlarkid","Mar 09, 2009"

4.12,-2.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"To my uncultured taste buds, this is closer to a malty DIPA than a barleywine. By far, on the hoppier side rather than the maltier side. The malty sweetness is there, just buried under a layer of pleasent hop bity. Very piny on the back palate, while the sweetness lingers a bit on the front palate. A little bit leathery. I'm not the biggest fan of hoppy beers, but this is working for me. I'd rather a hoppy barlywine than a malty DIPA, if that makes sense. Pretty creamy and smooth for something. A little bit boozey, but I think the hop bitterness also enhances the alcohol effect, if it weren't so hoppy it would hide it very well. This is definitely a sipper for me, but quite pleasant. I can see why it gets the respose it does.","damienblack","Mar 04, 2009"

This one is just beautiful - other than the haze. I can forgive the haziness a bit for the other wonderful aspects. The smell is full of sweet malts, darker crystals, maybe a bit of chocolate, a great caramelly sweetness, with just a bit of piney, citrusy hops in the background. A very pleasant aroma that invites you to drink. The taste gives an intense bitterness along with an initial alcohol burn. Though there is quite a bit of malty balance. There is a distinct breadiness, backed by crystal malts with a bit of a chocolatey back. I also detect some citrus peel, with that piney feeling, not much in terms of resiny qualties, though. There's a hint of golden raisins. Overall a great flavor, but not the best I've had in the style. The mouthfeel is nice, good carbonation levels, a nice kind of chewy feel, but there's a hint of thinness at some points. The alcohols hits you, even with a bit of age, and the bitterness persists. The drinkability is nice. Definitely good to the last drop, but it starts to hit hard quickly. Worth a shot to all.","taylorhamrick","Mar 02, 2009"

Also there is a slight alcohol scent, but all of these aromas mixed together are very inviting. The flavor is also very nice, the malt seems to come to life a bit here with a dark sweet fruit mix and caramel/toffee. There is big hop presence here but it is not as overwhelming as I thought it would though it does dominate the tail end. Overall this is a nice brew, slick/creamy feel with adequate carbonation.

Very nice mahogany-brown, ruby-red appearance leads to a modest frothy and foamy head which lingered on for a bit and left quite a bit of lasting... smell was outstanding - ultra-rich, sweet, dominated by a smooth blend of hops and malts, caramel, and brown sugars... the best way to describe this beer would be to label it as a ""sweet IPA""... there is enough bitterness evident from the hops and the almost 90 IBU's to feel it, yet there is also a nice dichotomy of malts and caramel sweetness to nicely balance this out and make it a very unique and interesting sample... creamy, rich, thick mouthfeel with a good level of drinkability... the 10.2% ABV will soon creep up on you...

A tad caramel, maybe some raisens too. This one hits the belly like a bomb so I dont know how many I could drink, tasty as it is. A year would definitely do this brew some good to relax the alcohol. I'm still kind of skeptical about aging hoppy beers because I don't want to lose any of the hop flavor, but this one has more than enough to compensate. If you have this one I'd recommend laying it down for a year as difficult as it may be. Old Ruffian reminds me a lot of Great Divide's DIPA except with a bigger malt backbone and a much more prominent alcohol taste.

It pours thick but not soupy, little to no head, reddish amber, deep red. tranparent as hell for a barley wine. I may sound bias because i much prefer english style. The nose is of hops, hops, and more hops. The first sip has a great mouthfell, but is instantly hoppy as hell. Typical of American microbrews this tastes like a thick version of an imperial IPA. Even has similar colors, without the cloudiness. The finish is quite bitey and the 80 ( guess ) IBUs show up. A slight sweetness does linger on the lips but does not show up to much in the taste. A good barley wine for hopheads. A good summer barleywine, much like that of hog heaven by avery. I think this would age fairly well and maybe lose some abrasiveness in the hop flavors. I would put it away for like two years.","AKBelgianBeast","Dec 15, 2007"

Tastes sweet with a good balance of hops that aren't as huge as the smell would have you think, mixed in with malts and ends with some alcohol heat at the top. Has a piny aftertaste. Being my first Barleywine Style Ale, I would have to say I'm a little surprised that it isn't as complex as I was anticipating, and that is not to say I don't greatly enjoy this beer. I will age my next one for a bit longer.

When I started the glass I thought the the finish was too powerful, but now I think it was just perfect.

Rough, minty hops with some fruity esters (berries) and burnt honey. On the palate, raw alcohol first off, then deep bitterness and sweet caramel malt/treaclish goodness, followed by a return of hot, medicinal bitterness and a very active finish that clings to all parts of the mouth. Mouthfeel is, as expected, heavy and quite hot with both alcohol and hop oils, although the malts are unexpectedly smooth. Overall, this has the standard repertoire of flavors for an American barleywine, but the execution is off the charts. Everything is seamless and smoother than most of the barleywines out there. Excellent stuff, and one of the best American barleywines I've had.","geexploitation","Oct 21, 2007"

The hops really show up more in the taste. Ample bitterness balances out all that luscious malt character. There is no holding back with this brew. In a word, decadent.

You could say ""balanced"" here but both the hops and the maltiness are strong ""in your face"" flavors. Pours a cloudy reddish color. An agressive pour gives you a big tannish head that dissipates to a small, ""hang in there"" head. Lacing is huge, thick ladder down the glass. The taste is a nice transition from strong hops bitterness to a somewhat sweet, but not cloying caramel/malt taste. There is no alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is rich and halfway through the bomber, the maltiness becomes predominant over the hops. Drinkability is very good.

It strikes me that hop fans are like the folks that like hot peppers. Somehow, somebody has equated hops and hot peppers with balls. Hops lend a very valuable adjunct to beer, but are not more or less than a particular spice is to a Belgium brew. 70% of this brew is balanced sweet, with fruit tones. The heavy dose of hops is far too powerful and distracts from the barley wine nature. It may be perfect for some but to me it is an undeserved bow to the unorthodox, West Coast fad of single, double, triple and God forbid quadriple hopheads. Think of hops as a spice that is to be used to create highlights in taste. For those who truly love overdoses of hops, I say ""God Bless"". Hopping up an intrinsic sweet beer steals the very nature of the beer in my opnion.This beer is definately deserving of a try and honest appraisal, but this boy sees much more potential if the hops were muted. Sadly, in my opinion, when it comes to barley wine, hops should be a subtle reverberation, not a sledge hammer.

Nose is malty: rich, chewy caramel, toffee, fresh dates, leather, a hint of sugary fruit, all backed by zesty pine hops. Sweet toffee and toasted malt flavors up front. There's some herbal hop bitterness around the edges. Malt gets fruitier and rummier. And then the hop bitterness takes over. Herbal, medicinal, piney and numbing. Not over the top though. Sweet caramelized fruit comes out in the long finish. Full bodied, with a creamy feel. Very well done.","alexgash","Dec 05, 2006"
4.45,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"A medium pour into my favorite tulip produces a visually impressive dark tan head which never seems to fade. The ample lacing is as enticing as the head, and while poured cold the nose is fruit-forward with pronounced alcohol and a sharp hop presence - very much on-style, and gives me a very pleasant flashback to my first run-in with the style ('91 Old Foghorn!) Dark-brown amber in color, the first sip of the Ruffian is sharp, sweet, and boozy - oh yeah! Banana in the nose and strawberry preserves on the palate, it's a little surprising that a touch of yeast character manages to emerge from the pig-pile of hop bitterness and rich maltitude in this burly brew, but it is there. Chewy and full-bodied, with a creaminess that coats the tongue for a moment before yielding to the lingering bitterness. As the brew warms it's redolent of anise, plum, and raisin . . . amazin! If you ever here someone talk about ""a beer that drinks like a meal"" this is *exactly* the sort of beer they're talking about. Old Ruffian really is the sort of brew that should be shared and savored, particularly after a good meal, and with a good friend. One of my favorites in the style, and from a brewer that has never let me down.","Chaz","Dec 05, 2006"

4,-5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into my Duvel tulip glass a musty reddish brown, with off white almost tan head. There is some lacing present already, even though I poured lightly. Smells is of toasted, maybe 2 row barely, some malty sweetness, alcohol is definitely there, not nearly as over powering as my last barely wine though, but undoubtedly there. The hops in this one are present although not too aggressive, but their definitely there. There are also some ester scents produced from the alcohol, they are slightly fruity, but not to the point where I can really describe the specifics of them. The taste is much the same as the smell, slightly sweet start with mild balanced bitterness and then onto a bitter dry finish. Maybe some toffee and or coffee flavor from the toasted malts, but there is that definite barely wine taste, which I'm not really sure how to describe yet, but I will figure out soon, this is coupled with alcohol warmth on the swallow. The mouth feel is a little sticky and the residual sugars are totally present. Honesty this beer will kick your ass if you drink too deep. I am new to barely wine, but I think I understand their monstrously dangerous appeal. So far this has been both a challenge and a delight to drink even though the bottle is not even half empty, go for it.","mmcave","Nov 14, 2006"

The taste is mild with dark fruit, bread yeast, alcohol, and some hop bitterness. This is different from other b/w's as the flavor has more hops and is much more mild in regards to dark fruit and alcohol.

Heavy, almost continuous sheets of lacing coat the glass as it drains. Beautiful rich aromas of grapefruit and pine needles are apparent, backed by notes of caramel, malt, toasted bread and butterscotch. Mouthfeel is full, creamy and slightly syrupy with a perfect level of carbonation. Initial taste shows hints of caramel candy, crystal malt, brown sugar and toffee sweetness. However this quickly transforms into a very assertive and muscular hop presence with flavors of fresh cut grapefruit, pine and citrus rind along with an ample ethanol kick to amplify the whole experience.

But hey, wow, the taste is something else. this IS a good beer. initially there's a very bitter hoppy taste with little hints of breadiness and fruitiness and the malt really just acting as a kind of delivery system for tons of hops. Then, as it warms and your mouth becomes acclimated to it, there's some orange zest and maybe even some grapefruit that becomes more noticeable. by the end it really is like a good well aged barleywine...nice and sweet and fruity and great. The mouthfeel is appropriately thick and syrupy. its overall not terrifically well balanced, but i wonder if it should be? Lastly, its maybe a bit too much to drink a whole bomber in one sitting....i did, of course, and i kind of regret it because its one of those beer that i know will give me a swirly feeling in the morning (it did). but, yeah, ill buy some more.","aforbes10","Oct 24, 2006"

Aroma is grassy hops and sweet, caramel and toffee, resinous hop oil, grapefruit and other citrusy notes. Taste is best described as it is on the bottle, being ""hop forward", huge hoppy bite up front quickly leads off to sweet maltiness and then a warmth of sugary alcohol that leads to the moderately bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy, moderate to full bodied with lower levels of carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, this brew hardly hints toward it's 10% abv and is a wonderful balancing act of bitter and sweet makes this a great example of a hopped up barleywine.

Aroma was caramel and fruits, with a little bit of hops (grapefruit), some yeast/bread, and alcohol. First sip, and BANG, the hops come out of hiding -- citrus, primarily grapefruit. This is nicely balanced by sweet malt, which came aross to me as maple syrup, melon, and other hard to specify fruit flavors. The alcohol comes through fairly strongly, but this works well to moderate both the sweetness and the bitterness. This is a fairly heavy beer, with light carbonation, a drying sensation, and plenty of alcohol warming. This was excellent, easily the best barley wine I have had, and, although not a huge fan of the style, one of the best beers I have had to date.

I'm all for a hop bomb but this seems more of a hops and vodka tonic than a beer brewed with MALT. This was frankly a little hard to finish. Not a drain pour, but more work than drinking a beer should be. Hard to see how this is rated so much higher than works of complexity and balance like Old Foghorn or Old Crustacean.","Golden2wenty1","Jul 23, 2006"
3.15,-25.2,4,4,3,2.5,2.5,"Drinkability: While this is no doubt a winner with hopheads, I reacted to this beer the way my cats react to having medicine pushed down their throat. When compared to masterfully hopped American barleywines like Old Crustacean, or even more balanced efforts like Bigfoot, this beer seems excessively one-dimensional (I acknowledge that this was probably their aim, and gave this a 3 for taste rather than a lower mark - I adjusted drinkability to reflect my assessment of this beer against the style). Nearly no malt or fruit developments in this one, and the heady and thick quality of other barleywines is altogether lacking. One for the hopheads, though more like a double IPA than a barleywine.","expatsteve","Jul 21, 2006"

Rich toasty malt aroma, with some sweet fruity notes, and a bit of a perfumey hops smell. The taste is initially of rich syrupy malt, but that give way almost immediately to a fruity dry apple cider flavor, then a strong but balanced floral and a bit resinous hop flavor. The malt shines bright in the finish, deep malt flavor, not bitter roasted, but chocolaty and fruity, plum and dark cherry. Good sticky mouthfeel, but tart enough from the hops. Alcohol is hidden fairly well, drinkable for a barley wine. This beer deserves its great reputation.","dfried","Jul 20, 2006"

Anyway, it pours a beautiful orange/red color. very tropical looking...great heading in there also. Smell is very sweet with plenty of malty sugar, some chocolate, and plenty of fruit ranging from dark to light. It is a very juicy smell, but above all the alcohol permeates to make the drinker know that this beer is not messing around, definetly strong. Taste was ful of complexities, with molasses, candy sungar, medicinal flavors, more fruit, and a bitterness that shows up right at the end. It is certainly a heavy bodied beer for the style, which makes it a beer that seems to be meant for sipping and savoring. With regard to drinkability, althoigh I really appreciate this beer, I found myself struggling to finish with the heavy alcohol and aggressive hops...perhaps cause it is not one of my favorite styles. There is a reason that they call this beer the Ruffian, and that is because it is just that; A beer that will warm you, make you cringe and in the end give you one hell of a buzz. I'm very glad that I got this beer, certainly one that widens horizens with how a beer should taste.

Behind the hops are the rich sugary caramel and malt aromas. The citrus hops keep it refreshing and finish with a pine bitterness, all the while the malt sweetness is there in the back balancing the hops and adding to the richness and the mouthfeel. Good size body, a little slickness but mainly creamy and smooth with a little bite at the end from the alcohol and a slight drying from the hops. Alcohol is very well hidden.

The ruby red/mahogany color with the frothy tan/beige head is very appealing the translucent color, when held up to light, lets you see some small bubbles rising to the surface. The smell is pronounced at a cool temp and unlocks even more as the beer warms. A very malty base covers up much of the hop aroma, a toasty molasses, sweet raisen and plum mixture fills the boquet. The taste is very nice. The malty base is well represented up front. That nice dark fruit flavor shines through. A nice middle points to some almost faint grassy notes and then you are hit with a semi-dry and bold hop finish. The finish is impecible. The alchohol in this one is completely masked untill it warms you all the way down. The mouhfeel on this one is impecible. Perfect in my mind.

Sweetness and hops are in perfect harmony on this one as they both hit a high right at the end before the spicy alcohol gets you. Carbonation is minimal and just right for style.

The taste is excellent, starting with the sweet malt at the beginning and the mid-way the hops begin come forward and it gets stronger as it reaches the end of every taste.

Well, there are chocolates, melons, dates, grapefruit, figs, and caramels a plenty. The whole deal is great. Tremendous, depthful, balanced better than most if not all of the competitor and ever so complex.

The nose is fairly eccentric, hoppy as hell and far from subtle with hints of raw, floral, uncut, brutal hops, caramel and fruits, especially green melon. The taste is full-bodied, the alcohol well masked and the texture is fairly gripping. The beer points and laughs at the English mold. Hop driven with notes of flowers, citrus fruits and dripping, sappy pine. The malt balances well and showcases a nice lingering caramel sweetness.

It had a bit of a roasted/burnt smell to go with the heavy hop and orange aroma. There was a rocky, off-white head. The body was hazy and dark amber. The inital flavor was moderately sweet with a long finish. The hops aroma and taste did not diminish. Nothing surprising in the palate. This beer really lives up to it's billing.

Piney hops hit the tongue first, followed by a nice caramel bready malt, some nice fruits--cherry, plum, orange, pineapple, and a nice bitter finish with a slight alcohol warming.

Dark fruit flavor is also in the mix, with just a hint of alcohol (I'm really surprised this is 10.4%).

The beer boldly plops into the glass with a dark ruby glow and a tan-yellow head that rises through the durration of the glass. Continues to release aromas of ripe and dehydrated dark fruits with cherries, plumbs, dates, figs... and big-time hop balance. Tastes very sweet and bold with the same fruits as in aroma. Throw in brown sugar, liqorice, raisons, U.S. hops for ultimate hop spiciness, boquet, and flavor. Hops rise up to keep the malts from becoming cloying or undrinkable. Alcohol flavors and feel comes on imediately and never dies, but never becomes too hot or too fusal. No flaws in this beer; if there were, they would become lost in the abundance of flavor. Finishes sweet, yeasty, and alcoholic. Though it's easy to be put in the top 100, it's similar to many other great big beers.","BEERchitect","Dec 19, 2005"

A big whack of sweet malt and hops land up front, the sweetness well balanced by the hops bittering. Caramel flavor predominates, thinning out at the end to what reminded me of Cracker Jacks.

The inside of my mouth is actually tingling long after the beer has pass though it. Beside the tingling the mouthfeel is full bodied and lively carbonated.

Both the malt and the hops come on strong. A bit of a bittersweet bite to the finish. Sticky sweet feel with a plenty thick body. Somewhat dry as well. Excellent drinkability here for a brew with so much alcohol and complexity. So much going on and a great mix of big hops and big malt.","meathookjones","Sep 08, 2005"

Notes of caramel/toffee, cooked brown sugar, and ton of hops rush right to the nose. You can taste all 90 IBUs in the beer. Almost to a fault. There is an alcohol burn that I can do without also. There is some big hop flavor with enough malt sweetness to keep this beer from crossing into the Imperial IPA catagory. Quite full bodied and mouthfilling. Everything clings to your tounge for a while. I think it might hang on too long. Old Ruffian is worth the 6 buck I paid for it.

Aroma packs a huge hop punch, with big citrus and floral scents and a strong caramely/molasses like malt backbone. Wow, they werent kidding when they said ""Hop Forward"". Taste begins with a big hop wallop, huge citrus, pine resin, floral and earthy hops followed by a nice but not quite as big malt profile. The malt side of the equation is bready, lightly toasted, caramely, and molasses like with a nice sweetness to compensate for the overwhelming hops presence. The finish is bitter, and drying with a mild biting alcohol presence that is not unpleasant. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a big body. Drinkability is good, but this is a barleywine so you should really take it slow.

This is a very flavorful beer with candied sugar and sweet malt up front quickly followed by lots of dark fruit and chewy caramel. Next up are acidic bitter raw hop flavors, rum-soaked raisins, a rather pronounced spiciness (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, and white pepper) and a bit of brandy towards the finish.

They were both the same so freshness is not the problem here. Dark ruddy amber/red, bordering on caramel with a small slightly off-white head of foam that does not last too long and provides the glass with only a minute amount of lace. Aromas are fresh citrusy, grapefruity hops, and a bit of booze, and some hearty malts. A bit complex and balanced, but not really for a barleywine. Seems a bit one-dimensional and semi-bland for a barleywine. Taste is similar. The poerful citrusy hops blend pretty well with the big bolshy amounts of caramel-flavor-infused malts that I sense in this one, a little bit of a dirty/earthy flavor comes into play as well to make it a bit more interesting. Sticky finish, begs me to take another sip of brew. Mouthfeel is thick, bit on for the style, and drinkability is pretty good as well.

Huge floral and citric hops in the nose- especially grapefruit- with some fruity esters and sweet malts lying subtly underneath. Taste is predominantly bitter grapefruit hops. In fact, it's a little tough to get past the bitterness and pick out any other flavors, maybe just a bare hint of sugary sweetness. Very hop dominant, no balance at all.

Overwhelming piney and earthy Chinook reminiscent hops contribute a dryness that goes a bit far. Mellower floral and citrus fruits indicate the fact that probably more than one hop variety comes into the blend. Quite harsh hoppiness really, thats not my favorite type, thats for sure. The earthy malts are there to offer a match, but fall in front of the abrasive piney sweat drops, simply too agressive for simple bready and considerably powerful toastiness. A bit too much.

The finish has some of the malt, a hint of dates and a mild whisky note. The taste has a definite whisky flavor. I mean this in a good way. Almost bourbon like. The malt sweetness blends nicely with he citrus character of the hops to produce a complex flavor. Many Barleywines tend to overpower. This one comes on easy, and delivers a nice warming as it goes.

The initial taste was mellow and sweet revealing wave after wave of dried fruits like raisins, figs, and apricots. The hop assault followed shortly afterward with grapefruit, black pepper, and an assertive bitterness. Sticky coating on the tongue long after each sip was finished.

4.42,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall Impression: Man, Great Divide is going big with these. I dont think there is an over the top point for a barley wine, but this approaches it. Its a bit sweet, very strong, commands respect and small sips; classic AMERICAN barley wine. Drinkability has to be measured in would I get another bottle more than cann I tink nother un? Im interested in how this baby is going to age; it should hit its prime in a couple years, but nothing wrong with this fresh sample.","HardTarget","Mar 13, 2005"

4.65,10.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: I really enjoy this beer, right now. Think of Old Horizontal that was fed adrenaline. It's really quite complex, once you can let the harsh hops and malt reshape your palette. I am willing to bet that this will soon be in the top 100 beers on this site, especially if left to age. Wow.","99bottles","Feb 28, 2005"
3.91,-7.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours out an amazingly clear reddish amber color, with a moderate eggshell colored head. Aroma is syrupy sweet with tropical fruity hops and a mouthwatering mix of caramel and vanilla. Flavor is way more hoppy than expected, resinous pine and tongue stripping bitterness assaulting you with abandon. As your tongue begins to recover from the onslaught, the malt begins to take hold, revealing a hearty depth of sweet caramel malt tinged with boozey pear and a hint of vanilla and spice. Raw hop bitterness returns in the finish, this barleywine is huge in the hop department but has enough malty complexity to prop it up and keep it from being unbalanced. Body if full but not too thick, becoming more drinkable as it warms, a bomber of this stuff is dangerous. Very tasty stuff, thanks to MJR for this bottle!","mikeys01","Feb 26, 2005"

4.95,17.6,5,5,5,4.5,5,"Round 3: 1 hour, 15 minutes later and still there is 1/4"" of head. Foam coats the sides of my big ass glass. Alcohol is more warming now. Quite so. Very pine sapped and sticky resiny at this point. I said it before, but I mean it now. This is absolutely fierce. Sticky, sweet, boozy, carbonated and jagged, and smooth all at the same time. Tough S.O.B., this Old Ruffian. I didn't get K.O.'d, but instead, the old standing 8 count. Felt lucky to be alive, though. Congratulations, Great Divide.","GIVEMEBACKMYSON","Feb 12, 2005"
4.88,15.9,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Poured into a Schell tulip, with a gigantic off-white head that fades into a rocky, very uneven head. Body is a dark maroon/purple color. Holy hops in the nose. Smells more like a DIPA than a barley wine, with just an outrageous hop aroma. Taste is that of an DIPA, also. Outrageous hops dominate the flavor, with strong maltiness in the background. I would suggest that Great Divide sell this as a Triple IPA (only compared to their DIPA) and forget about a barleywine distinction. Do I like the beer? Yes. Do I think it represents the style very accurately? No. But I like it and I will give a beer that I like this much high marks anyways.","TastyTaste","Feb 09, 2005"
4.87,15.7,4.5,5,5,4,5,"Rustic looking auburn/burgandy blend. A slight creamy cigarette stained beige head recedes to a collar quickly. And this collar leaves some adequate lacing for a barleywine. This beer's aroma has caramel and nougat oozing out of every pore...with every pore being comprised of hop resin. My kind of aroma. The flavor profile is everything I look for in a barleywine. Deep blanket of caramel, toffee, nougat and fruit tones. But this blanket doesn't completely cover up the hop tones...no, it merely shades them. Those pine cone, resinous, rind-like qualities are present. But not in a Big Huge way in which you might find them in a DIPA. The bitterness is pretty clean, but very evident. Even though this barleywine is checking in close to 100 IBUs, this is a malt driven Barleywine, which really hits home with me. The alcohol is noticeable, but definitely not overbearing and quite fitting in the context of this beer. Mouthfeel is quite agreeable. A slight prick of CO2 is felt and the body is about medium-full. This is an excellent, excellent barleywine. One of the absolute best I've had.","Bighuge","Feb 08, 2005"

4.2,-0.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured a clear dark amber color and formed a nice light tan bubbly head that left latticed lace as it slowly subsided. Very little carbonation present. An aroma of malt, pine and caramel. A flavor of malt, caramel, pine and a touch of dark fruit. The body was medium with a slightly creamy aspect. The finish was a touch burnt with a hint of the pine and a touch astrigent. Not a bad barleywine that hides the alcohol well.","Wildman","Jan 29, 2005"
3.94,-6.4,5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall a big, bitter barley wine that really kicks your butt! Yet it's not overbearing and is easy to drink. I think this would age very well. It's pretty well balanced as it is, but I think some aging would smooth it out even more.","Beaver13","Jan 27, 2005"
4.5,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is a great barleywine, and a fabulous addition to the Great Divide family. To me, it tastes more like a Double IPA, but then, the good people at GD know more about beer than me, so I'll take their word for it. This is a great beer to warm body and soul on a below-zero evening here in the nation's icebox.","skybluewater","Jan 17, 2005"

4.53,7.6,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ruby-brown in color with a creamy tan head that leaves a nice amount of lacing. A very nice looking brew. The aroma is malty and citrusy, with pineapples and a bit of pine resin. The flavor is sweet of caramel malts and fruits. It is bready, like fruit bread, and resiny. It has a nice hop flavor throughout, and a thick malty mouthfeel. It is full in body and dry in the finish. This is one nice barley-wine.","BeerBuilder","Jan 13, 2005"
4.67,10.9,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Shockingly hoppy with absinthe bite. Burnt sugar just about coats everything including my eyeballs that have rolled back; I'm glazed, and sugars are dripping off my tongue. This seems to have gotten drier and sharper with age, like cheddar. This is so f*%#@ing creamy!! This is one of those beers I always want to have at least one of in the cellar.","gbontrag","Nov 27, 2004"
