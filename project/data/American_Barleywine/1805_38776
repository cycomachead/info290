4.06,4.6,4,4.25,4,4,4,"A very dark barleywine, with great lacing. Aromas of sweet treacle and a lot of hops come through on this adding resiny citrus and pine notes. A satisfying sipping barleywine, with a really great complex array of bready malt notes, coffee, a subtle sweetness matched by a serious hop contribution. Very nice, and would recommend it for sure. A rich satisfying brew.","mick303","Dec 21, 2014"

It's pretty rough on the taste buds. I also got a migraine headache after drinking this one. Maybe the hops in it were a bit much for me to handle? Seemingly so.

3.98,2.6,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Finishes clean, medium to heavy body carries the stiff biterness but doesn't linger too long in the aftertaste. Hop bitterness sticks with each sip and hangs around briefly at the end keeping the drinkability up a bit. Aggressive bitterness doesn't make this a slow sipper as much as it braces your taste buds to handle the heavy malt punch without flinching.","neophilus","Dec 08, 2013"

Nose of cedar and pine tassels, rich and resiny hops, and toffee sweetness. Flavors are rich and robust, with a decent balance throughout. Hoppy forward, with citrus and tropical fruit notes on a toffee rich backbone. Notes of booze highlight, as well as some earthy tones. The aftertaste is peppery, bitter, and toffee sweet. Well balanced. Bittersweet, slightly drying finish. Heavy brew.","GarthDanielson","Aug 07, 2013"

I didn't perceive this one to be anywhere close to the 100 IBU claimed on the label, so I'm suspicious that the bottle may have some age on it and the hops have faded.

The colors are seen through a bit of a haze. Aromatic for sure with a fabulous collection of sweet caramel malts, wild berries, earthy/piney hops, and just a touch of yeast to meld everything together. Topnotch on the nose. The body is medium to bold but overall smooth. The hops are upfront on the taste with a sweetness taking a slight back seat but never disappearing.I had this one fairly fresh and I like to let Barleywines sit for a bit before consuming.

Not to belabor the point, but other hop forward american barleywines have often been clearly barleywines - this, not so much. If you told me it was a funky dipa, I would be in. Stronger than expected carbonation as a barleywine carries all the way through. As a dipa, this is expected and enjoyed, as does the big hop and malt characteristics. Either way, the taste is good, not great. Its definitely not the most drinkable beer as a dipa or an american barleywine - its a bit like throwing the kitchen sink into the style.

Anyway, Vermonster comes out a dark ruby/brown color with a healthy inch of tan heading that lasts. The nose is of caramel, honey, dark fruit, (strawberries come to mind) and an herbal, spicy smell as well. The taste starts off on the sweet side for a split second, and then the 100 IBUs worth of hops make their appearance, bathing the palate with juicy, yet bitter hop notes. I also get some grapefruit, tobacco, and bubblegum. The bitterness cannot be overstated with this beer. While the body is very big, the alcohol is not readily noticeable. The drinkability is hindered somewhat by the astringent amount of bitterness from the hops, though I suspect that is precisely what they were going for this time. Final thoughts are that it is nice to see a Barleywine with such a heavy hop presence. Comparing a fresh bottle with an aged one would be very interesting I suspect.","jamie2dope","Aug 31, 2010"

Mouthfeel was slightly lacking in my personal opinion. I like barelywines w/ a full mouthfeel & this has a medium mouthfeel at best. The drinkability was good.

Long lingering hop bitterness in the finish. Resinous and sticky mouthfeel, full body, light to medium level of carbonation. I like this one a lot.

When the beer is cold, it is very unbalanced and hoppy. The beer gets much more balanced as it warms up, although the alcohol stays present throughout.

Booze bring up the rear end of the nose, and I'm detecting just a hint of raostiness on the back end. Flavor is nice and hoppy, bitter for sure, resiny pine, and a solid, well structured malt profile. Caramel is in the forefront of the malt side, followed by a touch of chocolate and the lightest bit of roastiness buried deep within. Bitter, piney hops were at the front when it was cold, but as it warmed, the malts really started to shine and became extremely well-balanced. Mouthfeel was a tad a thin for me, and the booze was just a touch too strong, but it was damn tasty all around,and that's what's important.

The color was a deep ruby and light brown, with a great, creamy head that overloaded the snifter glass rather easily.

Moderate bitterness and quite sweet up front, lots of toffee and caramel, with a little citrus and bread character, plus ripe fruits. Alcohol dominated the end though and was fairly aggressive considering the abv, lingering long on the palate and giving it a bit of an acrid flavour.

The flavor is all over the place, but I suspect it will be amazing after some time in the cellar. I can't wait to give it a year!","scottum","Dec 03, 2007"
3.05,-21.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,2.5,"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a scant 1/4"" tan head over the clear burgundy brew. Head is down to an uneven swirly layer of bubbles promptly, with slow-falling lacing. Aroma is sweet, fruity, and alcoholic. Taste is similar to the nose, with the strong alcohol in the latter half dominating and being of the sharp, rubbing alcohol type. Mouthfeel is good until the alcohol over-achieves, and drinkability is limited by same. Probably not one I'd search out again.","ppoitras","Nov 03, 2007"

3.6,-7.2,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"22oz bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a rich ruby brown with ample head. Strong boozy malty aroma. And that's exactly how the taste is. Powerful, malty and hoppy. It packs quite a punch all around. The alcohol content is quite evident. It is a bit sweet, but not overly so. Although this is a beer that will certainly make you take notice, it's not the most enjoyable beer in the world. I'm finding this one to be a bit of a chore, likely due to its very high malt content. But then again, I'm generally not a big barleywine fan, so feel free to take this review with a grain of malt. Yet as the beer goes on, that noticeable alcohol does its trick and sucks you in and makes you fall in love with the world.","sstackho","Oct 09, 2007"
