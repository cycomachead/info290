"750mL bottle. Bottled 02/20/15. Pours a murky dark brown with over an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Boozey aroma with some oak, vanilla, toffee, caramel, brown sugar and a hint of hops. The taste is toffee, caramel, brown sugar with a hint of vanilla. Somewhat boozey. More bourbon flavor near the end. Some citrus hops as well. Finishes with more burnt brown sugar and wood. Lots of carbonation. Not a whole lot of flavor from the barrel but there is some. Overall, a decent enough beer I'd grab once in a while."

"Overall: it's a solid American Barleywine, but I'm just as happy drinking a Sierra Nevada Bigfoot which is cheaper. I wonder how long Cockeyed Cooper sit in barrels? However, Unita Labyrinth and Dubhe are must-try as they are outstanding!"
""
"Overall: taste doesn't live up to look or smell but still an interesting ale"
"A bit darker than I expected, deep reddish color with a nice tan head.  Smells like toffee and vanilla, slight citrus.  Dried fruit, a little bourbon, caramel, and grapefruit on the tongue. Carbonation cuts nicely through the blue cheese I'm eating with it. This bottle was a bit over two years old when I opened it.  Glad I waited, as it seems many people seem to think the hops are overpowering when fresh.  Flavors were nicely mellowed and quite enjoyable. Barrel character was definitely present but not overpowering. Haven't had this one fresh, but the way it drinks at this age, I'm happy with an old bottle."

"This is a decent barleywine but I was surprised by the lack of bourbon/barrel in the nose.  Bourbon flavors were very subdued as well.  Boosting the bourbon nose and taste would be nice.  Very heavily hopped as well.  Almost leans into the DIPA category."
"Bottle. Lots of hop in the aroma and in the taste along with caramel, toffee and oak. Didn't pick up a lot of bourbon but a really good Barleywine."

"To reference an 80's Wendy's commercial, Where's the bourbon?"
""
"Poured into teku glass.  A clear dark mohagany brown with a 1/2 finger brown head that dissipates rather slowly leaving nice lace.  Nice dried stone fruits and brown sugar in the nose.  Taste follows with dried fruit, raisins, cherry, hints of bourbon and some alchohol, but unfortunately it has a slightly unpleasant bitterness that is somewhat different that a hoppy bitterness.  It might appeal to some but detracted from the beer for me.  Mouth is substantial, slightly viscous, sweet, but not quite cloying.  Overall, a decent attempt but unfortunately it misses the mark for me."

""
""
"Certainly not the best Barleywine I've had. There is an appealing brashness, but I find it lacking in depth and complexity. Drinks more like a hot porter than a Barleywine."
""
"Smell is great and then disappointment"
""
"Has a great body to it, I'm a big fan of barley beer and a nice taste of bourbon at the end result. Great beer company and good buy."

"Good American Barleywine. Was bottled in 2012 and still hoppy as hell."
""
""
""
"The taste followed aroma, with some nut-like complexity to the malt followed by vanilla and toffee that delights but ending with our cardboard dry funk not suitable for a barleywine.  While drinkable,  I would not age this beer any longer."

"Overall a very good Barleywine with a few detractions."
"Poured at the Tipples Rare and Barrel Aged Beer Tasting on July 13, 2014. Pours murky light brown with a fluffy white head on top. Aroma is unexpected with huge lemony citrus peel and not much else. Flavor follows with more big lemons--like chewing on the fruit--and very light caramel. Really not much else going on here, and while the flavor is only described as lemony, it isn't particularly bitter either. Maybe I'm drinking lemon Pinesol? Light to medium bodied--strange for a barleywine, particularly one aged in barrels--with medium plus carbonation. This was weird. Pretty much the exact opposite of expectations going in on a BA Barleywine. I can't say it was bad, just not right."

"The body was about average for the style, a little fuller than Bigfoot perhaps, and had a dry finish. Drinkability was OK, but I would probably only have 1 at a sitting. Overall, a nicely solid brew. Worth trying if you see it."

"A fair barleywine for those who like them on the bitter end of the flavor spectrum."

"For an American attempt at the beer, this is quite good. The age and bourbon probably helped the flavor of the beer too."

"A big bottle and my Friday after work is looking all good. Poured into a snifter, there is a noticeable cork pop and a lot more head than I expected from a barley wine. It is black in color and the head is huge, rocky, and light tan. Very, very nice looking. The smell is apricots, molases, vanilla, a slight hoppiness, and my mouth is watering. The taste is phenomenal, with boozy fruit, wood, vanilla and a slight banana in there somewhere. It is dry but not too much so, with a noticeable alcohol warmth as it goes down. The hops are there just at the very start and then its all wood aging from there. You taste it, you smell it, and you really get the sense that the aging process rounded off the sharp edges on this. Really, really spectacular. The mouthfeel is pleasantly carbonated and a tad sticky. Overall, I think this is a fantastic barley wine. It is not sweet like most. It could, if anything, use a bit more sweetness and a bit less woody dryness but wow, just really terrific."

"O: Bourbon character is unfortunately absent for the most part. This is still a good barleywine, but it's no Sucaba, Samael's Ale or Angel's Share. Recommended if you like American-style barleywines"
""
""
""
"Haven't reviewed a brew in a while due to the quick and easy rating thinga-ma-jigger. So it's a a dark ruby with nice khaki lacing and dome. Rose hips, pepper, honey in the nose. Huge citrus hops take the plate, followed by mellow grassy notes. Hidden in there is the depth of caramel apple, apricot, cherry skins, all followed with a big sherry explosion. Big body, crispy carbo. A very solid brew..."

"Wow, another Crooked Line that goes straight to beer heaven! Poured at a good temperature with a huge, foamy, thick, billowy, light tan head and lots of lace. Color is a clear cherry amber with a couple of lazy bubble trails. Aroma is a heavy, hop, malt, fresh sawn wood, resin, black olives. Flavor's like nose, bitter and tang up front, with a little malt and bourbon sweet, hints of dark chocolate. Body/carbonation are excellent. Finish is like flavor, the bitter hop veers a tad off, alcohol warmth, but still great sipping beer. Perfect to share with friends who are of the same mind."

"Overall - really good but, for me, it's strange to have this somewhat mixed review. The scent just blew me away and raised expectations perhaps unreasonably so. I enjoyed it quite a bit but found it oddly disappointing after the taste didn't match the scent. I suspect next time around, when expectations aren't quite so high, my feeling might change. But I will drink this again and recommend it to those who enjoy American barleywines."
"This beer loses credit for lacking in bourbon barrel characteristics, but it gains that credit right back for being a tasty and enjoyable barleywine. I would've liked to pick up more bourbon characteristics, but it's still very enjoyable nonetheless. Well crafted."
""
""
"M- Light to medium body, tingly carbonation with a touch of heat."
""
""
""
"A very solid barrel aged barleywine. I am glad I can find this on the shelves."
""
""
"Amazing aroma. I could smell this beer all day. This beer is almost 1.5 years old and still has quit a bit of hop presence. More in the flavor than the nose. The alcohol is spicy and somewhat mild except for the finish, which is little harsh. Glad I set on this for awhile."

"Pours a cloudy, brown color. 2/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, wood, hint of bourbon, hops, hint of cherry, and a hint of chocolate. Fits the style of an American Barleywine. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, hops, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of wood, hint of bourbon, slight chocolate, and hint of cherry. Overall, this is a really good beer; complex, well blended, good appearance, good feel, and great body."

"The flavors penetrate the back of my throat with potent barley malts, vanilla, and molasses and a moderate hop bitterness at the end. The ABV is not well masked but the sweet flavors offset that."
""
""
""

"O. Not my cup of tea. Bitterness overrides everything and, for me, made this unenjoyable."

"The toffee continues to deepen and so does the nutty quality as this warms. For as high an abv there is no alcohol on the nose and on the palate it translates to a smooth warmth. The aftertaste is delicious and sweet. The bourbon on the nose drops off about mid drink but it remains on the palate and you are left with with a toffee candy like beer that is so easy to drink. You might forget the alcohol so be careful. Uinta has done a good thing with this beer."
""
"O - Bourbon Barreled barley wine?? Must of missed all of that part. Pretty disappointed. Super boozy, lots of carmel, very American (hoppy), not flavorful. I honestly don't think this beer represents the words on the label well. I did not like this. I do not recommend it. Save your money."
""
""
"This has aged quite gracefully, I really liked that the Bourbon character is not too overpowering and really accentuates the gracefully aging base beer. This beer doesn’t quite escape the Bourbon heat in the finish, more so as the beer warms up, but for the most part this doesn’t detract too much. Definitely a nice beer to spend an evening with."

"Overall, notably one of the most drinkable barleywines that is barrel aged. But, being barrel aged, it is not pronounced on the barrel aging. It's there enough to notice and as it warms you get some of the wood with the earthiness, but personally I like a bit more heavy whisky notes on my barrel aged beers. I would buy this again for a night with friends who are into big beers but may not have delved into the extravagant. This is a good step up, but not a mind blower. I would drink this again, but may not buy it for personal enjoyment. Glad I had the barleywine and the barrel aged as well though, a great adventure."

"Overall, this is a barrel-aged barleywine done right."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into large snifter; deep blood-red ruby with a huge fluffy tan head even from a soft pour that fades very slowly, leaving tons of lacing. Smell is big malt, some bitter hops, bourbon and vanilla, and some woody notes. Taste is big malt, a hefty presence of bitter hops, as well as some dark chocolate and dark fruit. Then it all smooths out into bourbon/vanilla/woody flavors. Mouthfeel is huge and creamy. Alcohol is noticeable but not in a bad way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was expecting a lot more, I have a huge love for all barleywines but this quite didn't do it for me. Factoring in price, you can save yourself a few and grab something more worthwhile. Not to knock it but there is more out there...Salud!"

"O: a solid beer overall. I'd like a bit more depth and bourbon character, but there's nothing particularly offensive about it."

"For a barleywine, this has not aged well, although I do not know if there was carbonation to begin with. Aged in a cool and dark cellar since receiving it."
""
"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/11/2012. Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, orange zest, apple, floral, light pine, orange rind, grass, toast, brown sugar, light chocolate, oak, light bourbon, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt and hop notes with light-moderate barrel notes. Taste of caramel, raisin, orange zest, apple, floral, toast, brown sugar, light chocolate, oak, light bourbon, light pine, light clove, grass, and floral earthiness. Light amount of floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, floral, toast, light pine, brown sugar, light chocolate, oak, light clove, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of malt and hop flavors with light-moderate barrel presence; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance for the style and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a slick, lightly syrupy, and sightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent American barleywine. All around very nice balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors with a fair amount of barrel presence; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"overall: Tried this fresh and was just too hop forward. Thought a couple of years in the cellar and it would come into it's on. Should've waited another year."
""
"Overall I am not sure how much a bomber costs but a pour on tap was well worth it at this price. One very unique brew."
""
"Overall, a really nice example of a barrel aged barleywine. The hops are a bit too much for my liking and really kill a lot of the barrel tones at this age. It is very nicely balanced however. Really easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep tawny brown with a a huge tan head that persists forever. Smells of floral and spicy hops with a solid shot of caramel and brown sugar. Lots of fruity esters waft forth as well as a touch of minty menthol and a faint hint of bourbon and oak. Wow that tastes great. Sweet caramel and dark sugars mixed with a healthy does of pitted fruits up front. Light bourbon and oak midway through with a hint of vanilla and a healthy dose of hop bitterness and ethanol long into the finish. Medium to thick body with a sweet hot mouthfeel and a light to moderate level of carbonation. This one wowed me at first but as it warmed the alcohol heat did start to get a little harsh. Nice barleywine maybe a good aging candidate."
"Overall: A good barleywine even though some carbonation must have evaporated through the cork since it was bottled in Jan/2011. It most likely could of been stored longer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: So damn good. Would love to get one of these in the cellar. My complaints are the oilyness and that the burn in the gums is persistent, but otherwise close to perfect."
"o: a very nice barleywine, but i'd almost rather see more nuanced malt and barrel character than the level of hop acid here, but a nice late fall drink on the coldest night yet"

"This decadent taste, texture, and aroma does all that the American barleywine expects. But I keep looking for an element that pushes it over the edge- a drier finish, a bolder impression, a hoppier start, a sweeter finish... something that pushes me off the fence. But those things don't happen and leaves the beer in a wonderfully obscure but regretfully forgettable beer."
"Great stuff!!!"
""
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, bottled on 11/29/12. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is nice, it smells like caramel, dark fruit, toffee, bourbon and vanilla. The brew tastes like caramel, toffee, dark fruit, wood, bourbon, and there's also some citrusy hops and a bit of an herbal flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's syrupy and coating with good carbonation. The bourbon in this brew is noticeable, but it's not very strong in either the aroma or flavor. I do think that it's still a good brew, but I was expecting a little more bourbon kick from it. Overall I liked it, and at $11.99 a bottle I'd pick it up again in the future."

"Probably wouldn't buy again, especially at the price. It has both good and bad qualities."

"2011 vintage on tap at rock bottom. the color is a deep amber maple syrup looking color, mostly clear, with a finger or two of white lace that gets super thin and dies out after a few minutes. the nose is really bourbon heavy, with a huge grain bill underneath. im not sure if there is rye in this, but it smells like it. good toasted qualities and a lot of booze. the flavor is very alcohol forward, especially when it warms up a little. there is a lot of sweetness too, some vanilla, and some dried cherries or cranberries or something providing a sweet and tart element. majorly full body this is a slow sipper and an easy beer to get a buzz from. the 11 vintage is nice and mellow on the alcohol front, not as hot, but still just as strong. it could stand a tad more carbonation, but being a few years old I cant be too critical of that. long boozy sweet finish. less hoppy than some American barleywines, but the bourbon really shines as a result. overall an excellent example of the barleywine style and one of the better beers coming out of Utah these days. no complaints."
""
"Overall, I feel that its current rating, 88, is low for this beer and I am certainly going to buy this one again; I would recommend that you do as well. Having said that, don't expect King Henry or Mother of all Storms, but do expect a decent ENGLISH Barleywine that is both affordable and available! 4.25."
"20 minutes into this brew and the flavors have mellowed a tad...with the dark bitter chocolate, burnt dark malts, and barrel liquor remaining strong. A hearty barley wine ... not for the timid!"
""
"In Denver on business and stumbled across Barleywine pouring at Falling Rock. lucky me. Bartenders attitude reminds me of no BS vibe at tornados but he knew his sh*t. Cockeyed Cooper was disappointing in my opinion. A bit too light on the flavor side for my Barleywine tastes. On to round 2."
"Overall, a really great barley wine."

" The flavor of the hops are mildly bitter with pine accent and mild caramel malt goes well with the light fruit in the yeast with a slight brown sugar flavor and hints of woody bourbon with a light tinge of vanilla from the oak with mild astringency in the hops and light barrel tannin adds to the dark dried fruit taste. Overall I am a fan of the balance of both strong and subtle flavors with light aggressiveness in the hops adding nicely to the barrel treatment. A very enjoyable barleywine with inclusion of wood and bourbon enhances the flavor in my opinion"
"Overall: One thumb up, above-average, but it failed to return my zeal, my zest for life. Maybe next time."

"O - Malts really dominate in this one with barrel aspects not very strong/noticeable. After having Labyrinth, I was expecting a lot more from this one. Sadly, it did not live up to that one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Toasted malt quickly turns to strong caramel, fruit, and coconut malt sweetness. Notes of oak, vanilla, and bourbon come on strong near the finish. Woody, herbal bitterness also picks up near the end and lingers long into the finish. Bourbon-soaked tropical fruits, coconut, and caramel also linger. Warming, but not overly boozy, even with the bourbon/oak presence. Full-bodied, with a smooth, creamy, mature feel. Delicious and very nicely done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: It's a big medium bodied beer, leading"
""
"More of a ruby brown color with a reddish accent. There is a long lasting head on top and some thick layers of foam sticking to the glass. Going alongs the lines of the American barleywine, this one features notes of pineapple, toasted sugar, soft citrus, subtle oak, and a full malty body. The alcohol level, at over 11%, is hidden with skill, making this beer a dangerous one to drink on its own. Better to do this one with a few good friends than to do on its own."
""
"In fact, this was a fairly hoppy beer. They didn't dominate the taste, but complimented it very well."
"O: A solid BBA barleywine with huge complexity. Definitely a sipper because of this fact, plus the 11.1%. At under $12 for a 750 mL bottle (plus the fact that this is year-round), this is one worth picking up. I'm sure this would age wonderfully as well"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is fantastic. It has complex flavor and surprisingly dangerous drinkability. There's great balance. The bourbon is complimentary and adds complexity. This is all around solid. I'll definitely be having this again."
""
""
"O. Ok beer. Seems like this beer is not ready at this point in time. Not a lot of barrel aged flavor. Barleywine seems to pack a bit of a hop punch that mixes with some of the other flavors and aromas going on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only detractor, if I am going to pick one out, is that it is a bit boozy and hot."
""
""
""
"Overall, great brew for a cold winter night to sip and enjoy (although I drank this in the fall). Not a ""wow, I will buy it again"" type of brew. Everything seemed somewhat balanced, except the smell. Perhaps it was a bad batch? It almost ruined the beer for me. On the flip side, I do recommend this brew if you want a warm feeling in your belly and a numb brain from the high ABV. I will buy it one more time to see if my perception changes. If it doesn't ""wow"" me a second time, I won't buy it again."
"O - A decent barleywine, but a few off flavors keep it from becoming a great one. Probably not going to be a repeat buy for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good. Not much for oxidation/aged flavors, the bourbon works in a subtle way, for a bourbon barrel barleywine it comes off as a little plain though. Surprising amount of hops still there after 2+ years."
""
""
"High C+"
"Solid bourbon delivery on a good base Barleywine. For the price and availability, very nice."
""
"3.0 D: The bitterness and astringency reduce the drinkibility. There is a very pleasant nose, but the taste is damaged from the problems I mentioned. Still, it's not bad. Worth a try, but probably not a second buy."
""
"Cockeyed copper pours out that copper color with some light bronze hues within. Just a small amount of tannish bubbles forming a loose cap, no lace on the sides. Smell is very minimal on the oak and bourbon with some grain coming out and a small amount of caramel. Getting some rust and signs of infection as well. If this is an american barleywine, the hops are out of the picture as of now in keg form. Taste is off, and light and just not big enough to be a top contender for BA barleywine. Definite infection. To be honest, this does not even resemble a barleywine, the body is too thin. Tastes of metal, slight oak, vanilla, faint caramel, and some coca cola in the finish. Somethings off. As stated, body is at about medium, light carb, infection left on the tounge. Drinkability is low, because I did not finish my glass."
""
"Brownish maroon, with a tan head. Quite a nit of lacing, but light retention. Nose has dark sugars, molasses and oak. Bourbon isn't totally pronounced. Taste has some earthy and citrusy hop character, big sweet malts pretty characteristic of American BW's. Brown sugar, oak, molasses, mild bourbon. Really sweet finish, and a good bit of bitterness. Medium full mouth, some alcohol. A good American BW, but not really in my wheelhouse."
""
"Reddish brown colour, about a finger of off white head and quite a lot of lace considering ABV. Smell is sweet and malty, caramel, quite hoppy, vanilla and bourbon, a bit of charred oak also getting some molasses and raisins as well. Taste is big and malty, hop bitterness is pretty big, bourbon is a little subtle but pretty well integrated, oak, vanilla and carmel flavours all present with a bit of brown sugar and fruit in the finish, alcohol is always present and fairly warm throughout. Lightly carbonated, chewy and full bodied, lightly sticky as well. I enjoyed this but this is something that has to be shared, the alcohol was a bit too noticeable as I got through the glass, quite nice though."
"You get a decent tan colored head, just over a finger’s worth of mixed bubble sizes, retention is above average, the lacing is a thin but full sheet which sticks to the glass sides. The liquid is a lightly filmy copper brown, touch of yellow at the edges, curious lack of visible bubbles. Broad nose, really fills out, very sweet with ginger, nutmeg, vanillin oak, butterscotch, molasses, there’s some charcoal to peat like notes in there, green apple, pear, fig and white grape scents in there, more rye or buckwheat than loaf of bread type stuff, at times smells like a baseball rosin bag, turns more roasted than hoppy at the end. Full-bodied, does a good job of being dry in texture while sweeter in flavors, the oak treatment obvious throughout. Vanilla, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar and flan flavors predominate, yet there’s also a bitterness which comes through bringing nuts, smoked grill fat, cigar leaf, citrus peel and wheat germ to the fore. The fruit diminished and receded back. The carbonation bigger than was suggested visually but nothing more than a basic simmer. Stays on an even keel through the finish, no great change. It’s a big boy that seems to want to correct you if you make what it considers a misinterpretation of itself. (Bottled on 5/21/11)"

"o: Not bad, but this just doesn't come together. Overly harsh and lacking sweetness. Where is the vanilla? I don't think this beer was a good candidate for the barrel."

"(originally reviewed: 06-10-2011)"
"Pours a horehound candy color with a gigantic, fluffy, caramel-colored head. Chocolate, toffee, creme brûlée and hints of bourbon make up the aroma. The alcohol hits immediately. A thinner, more watery mouthfeel fails to compliment the big, sweet dessert flavors comprised of bourbon, toffee, and cocnut. An alcohol warmth returns at the finish. I like this beer. A couple of small improvements could make this an overall top 25 in the world. Somebody smart is at the helm at Uinta."
""
""
""
""

"Medium body, good carbonation. Easy drinking for such a big beer. Not bad, but seems a bit too dry. Still a good beer."
""
"Overall a full tasting brew with a nice woody bourbon finish..."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"In all a very good beer, but maybe a bit to high on hops."
"O: Pretty decent bourbon barleywine. The barrel character came through nicely. The base beer, however, seems a bit weak, and was obscured by bitter tannins and hop notes. The mouthfeel was a bit too light as well."
""
""
""
""
"Super thick and chewy. Effervescent carbonation. Sweet vanilla and dark fruits on the tip of the tongue with mild roasted caramel coffee that rides onto the mid-palate. These subtle flavors explode into a crescendo of giant pungent flavors of oak bourbon spice and alcohol which doesnt so much attack the palate as it does kind of round out the the more subtle beginning. Really quite a ride but in actuality more elegant than it comes off, but that could be the touch of age on it. The bourbon barrel influence is just enough to compliment the other flavors in the beer rather than attack and overpower them. My only complaint is the highly noticeable alcohol content but at 11.1% it's hard to hide. Extremely complex and subtle yet packed with flavor. Elegant yet filled with surprises. For an easy to find barrel aged beer, pretty damn good."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a cloudy, muddled, opaque red-brown coloring that is very dark in the depths. No head to speak of. The aromas are rich and malty, with some maple and tangy caramel blendings, a subtle boozey note, along with an overall roasted character. Flavors are rich and layered, with a caramel-chocolate blending initially, followed by layers of rich, malty characters, including some leaning towards a fruit sweetness. The smooth body is full, but actually kept in check by the increased ABV. Roasted, richly sweet aftertaste leads into a slick, slightly astringent and boozey finish. The increased alcohol content also keeps the sweet and malty profiles from becoming overpowering or cloying. Very decent barleywine."

"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip, bottle dated 12/08/11. Pours a dark red, with a huge 3 inch off white head with red highlights, with plenty of lacing, and takes its time settling. Smell is lots of cooked brown sugar, bourbon, dark fruit, piny hops, and vanilla oak. Taste is powerful, balanced with everything from the nose. With bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit , and oak being the dominant flavors, but a bitterness in the finish that suggest bitter hops. This is really impressive, one of the most beautiful beers I have ever looked at and I love that it is a beer that blends wonderful with the bourbon not being the only true flavor. Body is large, nice carbonation especially for its heft, not that dry considering the style, and very drinkable for a beer of this magnitude. This Brewery is really impressive. Going to hopefully get a few more bottles to watch develop, would really amaze me if it could get any better."
"O: Pretty tasty, although the oak/bourbon are almost invisible."
""

""
""
"Overall, this is excellent fare, and easily one of the better Barleywines I've tasted. Especially noteworthy here is how the beer doesn't rely exclusively on heavy, thick malt flavors--such as many beers of this style do--but adds IPA-like hops and bourbon barrel aging to the mix. The result is definitely worth seeking out, and firmly places pretty much everything Uinta Brewing makes at the top of my ""must try"" list."

"Review from 1/2011 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a medium clear red amber. Thin off white head and lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and oak, light, but very pleasant. Taste follows, with subdued malts, bourbon, vanilla. Nice hop bite on the finish. Medium mouth feel. Not very assertive, but well balanced and tasty. Worth cellaring."
""
""
"O: Good, much better draft versus bottle."
""
"The mouthfeel is reasonably carbonated but not too much nor too little, and overall this is one of the great beers I've ever had: I don't think I would give 5.0's this much to too many brews, but this one seemed to deserve it."
"O: This is a good Barleywine. I recommend picking one up."
""
"For a 11% brew, I'm not expecting tons of carbonation, but this one pours very lifeless with some ""non carbonation"" bubbles. Appearance is a hazy tawny, zero head, zero lacing. The nose features a rich maltiness with shades of oak and molasses. The bourbon is very faint and contributes nothing more than a mellow vanilla accent at the end. The taste starts off very malty with huge notes of caramel and molasses. The bourbon makes itself more present as the taste develops on the palate. The balance is impeccable considering the weight of this brew. There is no burn whatsoever and it drinks as if it is much lighter. This beer suffers in the mouthfeel department. Again, the carbonation is nearly nonexistent which hurts the over all quality. The body is hefty enough. Overall, this beer tastes as if it is a fine recipe and even a decent bourbon barrel aged version of one, but in its current form, I am quite disappointed."
""
""
"A decent sipping beer for a cold day, this is a worthy beer, but far short of its early promise."
"I would definitely buy this beer again if I found it on the shelves."

"750ml bottle $12.99. I have passed this up many times but I've heard some chatter online about this and Labryinth so I grabbed one. Dark brown-red color, scant head, looks about spot on for the style. The smell is good, barrel but not overpowering booze, vanilla, caramel. It almost reminded me of the first time I had Angel's Share. Flavor was above average, vanilla, barleywine, and not really much bourbon at all. This tasted decent but did not really wow me. For $13 I'd rather spend a couple dollars more and get an Abacus."
"DOA"
""
""
"O: Barrel qualities shone more and more as the beer warmed. I can't help but compare to the Abacus I reviewed a few months back...and this would get the nod from me. Fewer distracting barrel notes, but still has accents from the aging process. For a complex beer, this isn't as bourbon forward...and I thank Uinta for that."
""
"Poured a brawny brownish head with a thick one-finger head that lasts forever and left lace down glass. Slightly boozy aroma, woody/breadiness is there, minor sweetness from roasted chocolate and caramel but not getting that much vanilla. A great medium-bodied brew that is really smooth thanks to the barrels - sturdy bread malt base that is complemented w/ chocolate, touches of caramel/vanilla and very minor candi-fruit tastes or something akin (not quite tropical fruit). Finish is crisp like touches of citric hops and spices; this with carbonation seems to prick the toungue on the backbite. ABV becomes noticeable at the end and this beer even starts to warm you up; really enjoyed the sweet flavors and robust malts balancing and the touch of hops as well."
""
""
"O - Not the most balanced brew. I enjoyed but didn't love this brew. I much prefer their Labrynth."
"Overall- I liked the beer, but thought price wise, it wasn't worth it. Paid around $14, which was probably too much. It's a decent beer, but I'm admittedly not a huge fan of barelywine, but not really educated enough on them. Wish there was more bourbon to it, and maybe a bit more of something, which I can't put my finger on. Uinta makes some good stuff, so I was taken back a bit."
""
"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving an excellent lace. Cloudy brown color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Bourbon and boozy nose, flavor is bourbon and oak but higher ABV is nearly hidden. Bottled Jul 2011, $13.99 for a 750ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

""
"O: Overall I like that this beer isn't so hopped that it blows the bourbon away. On the other hand this doesn't come close to some other beer that are stylistically similar. It is a very good beer, but falls just short of great. I will say as it warms up a bit some more of the bourbon comes out, with a touch more of the malt flavor I really like."
""
"Well either this beer is just bad or it can't be aged in the cellar for 1 year, because it tastes like shit. This makes me wonder if i should cellar barley wines anymore!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not really worth the price imo, maybe for a pint, but this isn't what I look for in barleywine of this price range."
"Drink slow."

"A very smooth and tasty barleywine with a gentle warming. Hops are mellow at first but still apparent. It’s a nice balanced flavor easily enjoyed."

"Twelve bucks for a bourbon barrel barleywine that you can grab off of the shelf any day of the week is pretty good, but I don't know if I will be buying one again or not. Cockeyed Cooper is a good beer though."

"Overall - An excellent barleywine... rich and warming... recommended..."

"O-Overall this is a very good Barleywine. It's a real sipper (11.1% ABV), nice flavor from the fruit, hops, and booze."
""
"O - this is a great one. start decently cold and go slow, it opens up beautifully as it warms"
""
"brown, though you can see some light through it, no head and a nice lace top it off. Smell is hopped for sure, but with a subtle sugary undertone, and a hint of alcohol too. Taste is not very strong at all. There is the natural piney hoppness you would expect from a barley wine, but not too strong, there is also a sugary, nuttiness about it as well. The alcohol is there, and that keeps this a sipper. It is actually nicely carbonated, and not harsh going down, has the warm feeling on the way"
""
""
""
"Overall an ok beer that fails a little bit on balance. This one was aged for about 8 months and even so the hop presence remains a little overwhelming. IMO the yeast selection should be a little more neutral as well and not as estery."
""
"D: it was not as easy to drink cause of the alcohol content but it was really tasty and had a nice bourbon balance that was not over done."

"Super smooth drinking barley wine, very dry finish. Notes of dark and burnt malts, smoke, toffee, scotch. Big and smoothly flavorful. Easy drinking, quality offering."

"D-Very drinkable for an 11% Bourbon Barrel Barley Wine. This one is insanely complex and really good."
"Poured from 750mL bottle into a 5 oz. snifter. This pours to nearly an apple cider appearance, but with a red tinge to it. Because I used a small snifter, I didn't give this a very vigorous pour, and as such, it didn't render much of a head. The nose on this is so very rich and bold. It's laden with notes of scorched caramel, malt, roasted figs, and grape distilled wine. The bourbon and woodiness from the barrel also make an appearance in the bouquet. I poured this cold, so I've let it warm up to allow some of the subtleties to liven up a bit. The taste is about as heavily influenced by the bourbon barreling as any beer I've had. Heavy on bourbon, caramel, and vanilla. As a person who also appreciates good whiskey, this is almost a ""tweener," to me. This is truly a sipper. The mouth feel is on the dry side, and I really don't mind it. And while I'd consider it boozy, I wouldn't consider it hot. The alcohol is ever present throughout a single taste, but it's neither astringent nor does it seem like an 11.10% ABV beverage. Overall, this is nicely done. Wonderful, wonderful example of the style...and excellent regardless of the style."
"A dark amber pour into my glass. Thin beige head on top. The nose is sweet with notes of bourbon, vanilla, toffee. I'd love to scent my car with this. Good crisp and heavy feel to this brew. A nice melding of mildly bitter hops (albeit faded), sweet boozy bourbon, vanilla tannins, with a slightly syrupy finish. This one was one of the highlights of the night. Much better than I expected. I'd have this again for sure. Another winner that is best enjoyed with friends."
"As far as an 11% big beer goes, it's pretty drinkable. Share with a friend. A great example of the style."
"A nice beer that I wouldn't mind trying again. Not overly complex, but a rather easily drinkable barley wine. A solid offering."
"Two finger tan head after semi-hard pour, fairly quick dissipation resulting in thin layer of head on topic of reddish amber clear body, an occasional single bubble rising to surface. Big bourbon presence in the nose, vanilla, some light brown sugar notes, floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, alcohol well hidden. Medium mouthfeel, not sticky. Tasty, but IMO the mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but tasty nonetheless, the bourbon barrel aging added a level of complexity and flavor."
"Pretty creamy, long and somewhat unpleasant finish. Overall a difficult beer to drink and to enjoy and one I certainly won’t be buying again anytime soon, particularly not when it’s 12 dollars."
"It pours a sticky and syrupy caramel brown in color with a light beige lacing around my glass. The aromas are very, very sweet with a ton of caramelized brown sugar, toffee, sweet malts, and vanilla. There is little to no bourbon. The flavors too are really sweet with a lightly bitter finish. You get a lot of sweetness between sweet malts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, and light bourbon barrel off notes. The bourbon is very subtle and subdued. I like more bourbon from the style. It drinks really, really sticky and is a lot like the other beers that I've had from Uinta, very malt driven. Overall this is a very average bourbon barrel aged barleywine and I wouldn't necessarily recommend it."
"This is a nice barleywine. I tend to favor the fruity, toffee laden barleywines as opposed to the hoppy/dipa-like ones. However, this falls short of the elite in the style, but I definitely dig on the barrel aging here."
"She tastes like she smells. Give me more. Oh hell yeah. Not over powerful with the booze, big wood flavors, nice malty sweet bourbon character. Can I have more? Should I drive back to the store now? Oh lord help me."
"O-- Not as good as Ruffian by a big margin. not sure the barrel ageing helped much. Hard to justify buying another due to the price. Thought hops died off quickly and the oak was the dominant feature. Not the flavors from the barrel."
"O: 4"
"There is some heat from this one, though it does not taste especially of bourbon hotness. A slow sipper for a colder day that is almost as good as GD Old Ruffian or Stone OG. That being said, it costs as much or more than buying both of those superior beers, so this may be a one time purchase for me, enjoyable as it was."
"Definitely a sipper, something to share with a few others in a wide mouthed glass while relaxing. The aroma is a conversation starter but the intensity of the barleywine flavor may wash weaker palates away."
"O: Much kudos to Uinta for getting this brew right. This brew should be including in anyone's BBBW tastings in the future!"
"O: It would be better with age. I wish it was a little more bourbon-heavy as well."
"Overall a strange beer."
"Hops in the barleywine was a pleasant suprise. The bottle said that there was a good mix of hops, but I thought they might just be in there for a balancing act. They are a definite presence, more on the bitter side than aromatic. As I drink it, the booze becomes more and more obvious, like lesser-filtered vodka. Still, it starts rich and complex like a good barleywine should be, but with the satisfying, saliva-inducing finish of an IPA."
"O – A bit boozy, but complex and still highly enjoyable this young."
"O - This would be a great beer to enjoy on the deck on a cool fall evening. The caramel flavors would probably pair well an apple dessert of some sort, which I also tend to associate with fall weather. I was a little disappointed in the lack of bourbon in the nose and flavor, but I love barrel aged beers with a strong bourbon note. As others have noted, the bourbon is there, it's just plays a minor role. If you enjoy barrel aged beers without the harsh bourbon notes, I would recommend drinking this fresh as the bourbon has already blended nicely with the other components."
"Drinkability – It’s a difficult task to create big beers with character and superior drinkability. Uinta has nailed it with the barrel aging. The barleywine is well done and is let shine through. The additional aging builds upon the foundation, rather than overshadowing it."
"O: This is a good...not great barleywine. It was more hopped up than their double IPA which i had the other day which is kind of weird. Overall...I guess i would try this beer again if I got it for not a lot of money or for free but probably would spend what I did on it ever again."
"Pours a dark, brownish-red with a small, off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is mellow bourbon (hardly any), dark fruit, molasses, and caramel malt. Hints of vanilla. Taste has some nice bourbon (more than the nose), dark fruits, toffee, and a bit of booziness. Mouthfeel is full-bodied. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a fantastic barrel aged barleywine. I was thinking about aging this bad boy, but I sure am glad I didn't. To those who have this, DRINK IT NOW! Even though fresh, the bourbon is fairly mellow and will just fade with age. It's very well balanced as it is."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 1 inch puffy tan head that settles to a thin film. Thick foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, grapefruit, and fruitcake. Taste is of brown sugar/caramel, bread/biscuit, and a variety of citrus zests. The smell and taste of this beer shows no evidence of bourbon or barrel aging. There is also a weird thing going on where the taste is robust upon first sip but quickly drops off on the tongue. This beer has a crisp moutfeel and a medium body with a slightly sticky feel. Overall, this is a good barleywine but I am somewhat disappointed at the lack of evident bourbon/barrel aged smells and tastes. This is more of a standard barleywine in my book."
"Rating: 9.0/10"
"Poured into a 4 oz. tasting snifter, the liquid appears a deep brown/ruby color that is primarily translucent. A two inch foamy, khaki head sits on top, and dissipates into patches of sticky wet lacing. Smells of dark fruits, bourbon, brown sugar, hazelnut, caramel, and a touch of vanilla; wonderful. Tastes of faint alcohol, vanilla, caramel, hazelnut, bourbon, and some oak. Mouth is smooth, with a nice texture from the carbonation. It finishes very well, not being too dry or sticky. Overall, an excellent barleywine that I’ll gladly pick up again."
"O- I like it up until the aftertaste. Can't drink anymore."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a warm, caramel and burnt toffee scent along with a mild bourbon aroma that compliments the malt character well. The taste is good. It has a smooth burnt toffee flavor; rich and warming. It goes down slow with a dry, bourbon filled finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn easy drinking barleywine. It's basic in make-up, but well brewed. The bourbon barrel aging only enhances the experience."
"mouthfeel - creamy and smooth. solid thick body with low to medium carbonation. has a great english barleywine body."
"O- I'm really, really liking the transition from semi sweet start to a slight hint of bitter for a finish. Sat on this for a long time. Good thing this is still available in most of the shops which I visit. Please, sir...may I have another! :) Yum!"
"Poured into a snifter the beer has a deep copper hue with a more aggressive eggshell colored head than I expected. Smell has some candied sugar quality with some traces of bourbon and light wood. Also picking up some hop qualities with notes of slight citrus. Taste is really solid. This is definitely an American Barleywine as the hops are present, but it has a great malty caramel background with toffee notes. Good barrel characteristics in this one but they play more of a background role than in other BA barleywines I've tried. Mouthfeel is more medium with solid carbonation that it makes it easier to drink than some of the thick syrupy barleywines. Overall a very solid beer."
"O - It's not bad, but nothing I would seek out. It is nice to see a bourbon barrel barleywine readily available though, so if I'm in the mood, might pick it up."
"It's a very robust beer, certainly hoppy, with a variety of flavors attacking the palette. Perhaps because of my inexperience, I can't discern the vanilla nor any other specific flavor except maybe sour grapes. I'm glad I tried it, but would not recommend it for those looking for vanilla overtones in their BB aged beer."
"O- This beer was a little of a let down for me. A little thin on taste, and not complex enough to truly be great. It's not a bad beer, but I probably won't pick it up again. Much better choices out there in the style."
"The mouthfeel seems a little bit light on this and the carbonation is soft. Overall this one seems to have a few off flavors for me. I wonder how this would stand without the barrels."
"This really delivers in my opinion; it is on the sweeter side but has quite a bit of complexity."
"I can't help but wonder if this was born from the Uinta Anniversary barleywines. It's got their stamp of quality on it: great head (and the foam on top of the beer is pretty good too, <snare><rim shot>), nice balance and an ABV that would make Brigham Young blaspheme. I can't help but feel that many have underestimated this offering and it is by far my favorite product from Uinta's little side project. I can't help a lot of things, like global warming (it's actually climate change, not necessarily warming), the vagaries of the stock market (it's all voodoo baby), the popularity of talentless fucks (yeah, I'm looking at you Rid Rock, Gaga, and Bieber) or my overwhelming desire to sleep with Salma Hayek (my wife never reads these reviews, with my luck she'll read this one)."
"Bubbly barleywine with a very warm, alcoholic palate. There's a little bourbon flavor, but you almost wouldn't know it unless you were told. Spicey palate and falvr profile makes this barley wine a little sub-par compared to expectations."
"Pours a semi-translucent mahogany with a quarter inch, cream-colored head. Nose is definitely malty and reveals caramel, dark fruit and a light boozy character. Taste follows nose; however, I'm not getting much barrel-aging here. There's also a pleasant buttery quality as well as a trace of oxidation. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a prickly carbonation. While I realize this is an American Barleywine, I found this beer a little too hop forward. That said, I think a few years in the cellar would definitely enhance the experience and mellow things out a bit."
"The sweet, thick, and syrupy body is pretty much in line with my expectations for a barleywine. The carbonation is ample to open up the flavors, though I do wish more from the aroma. Full on the palate, it leaves a sticky resinous finish. Definitely good stuff overall. This really grew on me as it warmed, so take that as a recommendation."
"O- A nice barleywine for sure. One of the weakest smelling beers for being in a barrel, but the taste backs it up. Uinta is so far so good."
"O: This is an exceptional bourbon barrel aged barley wine. I will absolutely get this again and think it may age fairly well."
"A decent effort, but not among my favorites for a bourbon barrel aged beer."
"Sean was curious if i would like this beer. I can tell you Sean we liked it very much. Not a style i would buy many bottles from but in this group a very good one!"
"M- Nice carb, not too heavy but has some heft to it. Nice finish with a little residual flavor."
"overall i think this is a winner - very good barleywine. doesn't challenge abacus for BW supremacy IMO, but a tasty and relatively complex brew worth a try."
"O - Overall a nice beer. A little more hoppy and ""red"" than I expected. Also has very muted Bourbon notes, which is a disappointment to me."
"Well not nearly as sweet as the nose would indicate, dry and bursting with fruit and juicy malt. Thick caramel, dried fruit. Bitter earthy hops on the finish and some oak tannins. Bourbon comes through in the middle and falls off quickly after that. Thick with raisin and prune flavors, and the date and fig at the front and middle palate round things out. Oak flavors linger long in the finish and pester the tannins which is a bit odd. Some mollasses and rum flavors as well. Could use a bit more body and creaminess in the mouth and with just a little more residual sugar this would have been that much better. Still a very good barley wine."
"AMAZING, MUST TRY!"
"O: I really like this brew, but I was hoping for a bit more complexity of flavors. In my opinion barley wines have a great amount of depth that this beer falls just short of."
"Medium bodied, lighter than I was expecting. Drinkable enough, but very average overall."
"Beautiful, dark and clear, brownish-copper bronze color. Slim head. This is a good beer that is engaging and worthwhile, but doesn't quite live up to its potential. The aroma is very appealing...pale malt, a little nutty-earthiness, and lots of melanoidin-enriched complex sugars. Nice. The flavor is quite good as well...it's drier than the smell leads you to believe. Although it's also a little mismatched between bitterness and maltiness. The bitterness stands out, and a more robust malt sweetness could compliment that trait. The beer hides the alcohol quite well, and there is a lot of complexity and appealing qualities about this beer. Full in body, and very enjoyable."
"Edit: 8-14-11 I previously said ""reminds me more of an ale than a barleywine"". My taste is getting better. Definitely a barleywine. Scratch that previous statement. I had this at an A-, this is more of a B+ however. Good, just not A material."
"(O) This was a very surprisingly god beer. Wasn't expecting it, mainly because I wasn't sure what to expect. It was very well balanced and definitely not too boozy."
"Pours a rich, dark burnt amber with unusually large frothy khaki head. Scent is dominated by piney hops, alcohol notes and nutty and bready malts. Missing is some sweetness, bourbon and oak notes - all large components of bourbon barrel aged barley wines. Taste follows scent, big hops and roasted and nutty malts. Only a very faint presence of oak and vanilla give hint to the barrel aging, no noticeable bourbon - just alcohol. Medium bodied, light for the style. Dry and tannic with an overabundance of carbonation. Letting it warm and swirling to remove carbonation does very little to improve the beer. Although its tastes ok... as a bourbon barrel barley wine, this beer does not succeed."
"(750ml bottle from AJ’s). Pours nearly clear copper with massive beige head. Some nice lacing develops. Aroma of strong alcohol, dank hops, wood and some band-aid. Taste is sweet with hop bitterness and a sharp alcohol bite. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Bitter, hot finish. I didn’t like this one too much. It reminds me of CL Golden Delicious where the alcohol just overpowers the base beer. An alcohol bomb."
"Solid beer with an interesting finish, no bourbon detected."
"D: Would be nice to revisit this one in a year or two. The aggressive and fresh hops need toning down...it really drowns everything else out. There seems to be some good complexity beneath the blanket of hops. As it is right now, I wouldn't recommend it. If you do happen to drink this, allow this to warm to at least 55."
"mouthfeel: begins very creamy, goes down with an oily foamy feel. leaves the mouth syrupy."
"Overall: This really works. Drinks easy, feels great, nicely balanced. Sure, the barrel taste could be greater, but as it is, you gotta like it. My only complaint would be the huge bottle format. I had to drink a whole 750-ml bottle on my own."
"Overall: Very impressive, finishes with a a hint of barley wine, but overall impressive with chocolate and bourbon, a hint of caramel. Definitely worth a try!"
"(D)- A really nice surprise for a barleywine. Sweet and figgy, but a great balance and smoothness. The bourbon barrel aging was well done that didnt overpower it, but added a nice soft oaky finish."
"O-Underwhelming, way too boozy, and extremely overpriced.For a supposed ""Bourbon Barrel Barley Wine"" there's no trace of bourbon, and barely any oak. Surprised this has so much hype behind it, as it offers almost nothing, and is way too expensive. Skip it."
"Verdict: Too expensive given that they need to refine their barrel-aging...Look elsewhere..."
"Deep amber color. Little to no discernable carbonation when opened though there is a very slight ring of bubbles. Extremely malty and toffeeish aroma. Big malt flavor upfront with a heavy hand of hops as well but it sems to be about the malt for sure. Mild oak flavor. Traces of vanilla. Seems like a standard US barleywine to me, I get very little of the notes that are described on the bottle. Very faint taste of alcohol. Nice, smooth and somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Very good US barleywine, I just dont get all the barrel aged, vanilla that is quoted on the bottle. Well worth trying."
"Cheers."
"Drink- Not too bad on this one, I was beginning to regret the Crooked Line series after the Detour and the Tilted smile. This was a nice beer, big booze and a smooth. Just a couple notches below Abacus and Moas."
"Seeing as I've got one of these myself, I plan on losing it in the back of my cellar for a few years and seeing what'll happen. Good things I suspect."
"D- The sweetness is faint and only really in the nose and the dry malt flavors are well blended making this big beer drink very easily. The bitterness in the finish grows more than the malt characteristics. I prefer barleywines with a bit more sweetness and a bit more depth in the malt flavors."
"O: I was a bit disappointed with the flavors given this is supposed to be a barrel aged barleywine. It's decent for a regular BW but I was expecting a bit more. Maybe my tastebuds are off tonight..."
"Cockeyed Cooper pours a deep maroon/mahogany blend. The head is the color of light coffee, and a somewhat aggressive pour yields 4+ fingers worth. Retention is off the charts, and when the foam cap finally does creep down it leaves a near solid wall of lacing left behind. The nose is of burnt sugar and vanilla, with an appreciable bourbon presence as well. There's also a small amount of solvent alcohol in the aroma, which spoils things just a bit. The flavor is a little more polished, there's no real booziness to it, but it's also a fair bit more dull. The malt flavors don't pack nearly enough punch, but the base is more toffee than brown sugar. Any overt bitterness is blotted out by the malt, but there's definitely a grapefruit and pine pacific northwest hop flourish on the back end. The level of carbonation is spot on, just shaded a touch to the low end of the spectrum. The body though passes through being a bit light for the style and crashes into watery. I remember being impressed by my first encounter with Uinta via their 15th Anniversary Barleywine, but I found this one to not quite live up to the established expectations."
"O - This is a rather nice barrel aged barleywine. I've had better ones but this is a really nice year old offering from Unita."
"D- this bottle seemed a little big for me. i wish i had waited for someone to open it with. id like to revisit this one when it gets some age on it, i picked it up shortly after it arrived around here."
"O- This beer was a unexpected treat. I have been sitting on this bottle for the past year it seems and I'm glad I did. The flavors are hard to beat in any barrel aged beer. The ABV is high but the alcohol doesn't come out in any sort of heat. A great beer that should be shared among friends."
"Cockeyed Cooper is quite the character. There's a lot happening here, more than I think I can glean from even a big bottle like this. But I'll be damned if I'll open another big bottle of it to figure it out further (probably a good thing I don't have another one to open). This one works in mysterious ways, and to its credit remains solid and enjoyable the whole time."
"D: Initially a booze shock, but does ease up a bit once you get past the first sip or two becoming easier to handle and consume. Just had their Labryrinth, which at 13.1% seemed light years lower then this. Boozy warmth and a nice experience but ultimately drinkability wise registers as average due to the high alcohol presence."
"Disappointing. Bottled less than a year ago, this one, anyway, has turned into a heap of Pinto scrap metal. My wife concurs. Sadly, reluctantly I can't finish this."
"M/D - Way too clean and drinkable... very dangerous. The mouth is a medium consistency and slick, with a slightly creamy carbonation. A great drinking experience!"
"I poured from a bomber, poured into 2 equal snifters. The pour is a clear amber with a nice 2 inch, creamy, white head. The aroma is sweet, hints of bourbon, faint. The beer is faint and much more subtle than I would expect from a BB barleywine. Hints of bourbon, vanilla, and some toffee. It has a light alchohol burn on the finish. The body is medium/light well carbonated. Perhaps this needed more time in the barrel, for me too light in body, and a little small for a BA beer."
"Drank easy enough for the style & ABV, but not really one I would go for again. Had high hopes after trying their BA Imp Stout; would work slightly better as an English BW, not enough to really save the day though"
"Up for review is a 750ml bottle of Cockeyed Cooper from Uinta brewing company. Poured into a snifter at cellar temp. Good to see some barrel aged stuff coming from these guys. Pours mahogany with a tan head. Nose has bourbon, malts, vanilla and oak. Barrel presence is faint, but present. Body a bit thin. Not bad."
"D: Great flavors and a very well hidden ABV. A bottle that I had no problem finishing and would buy again."
"Courtesy of douglas88 over on ratebeer. Once waxed bomber pours clear deep garnet with thin tan head. The aroma has big oak notes moving into bourbon and sweetness along with some boozy heat. I don't pick up much, if any, of the base barleywine here. The taste is pretty smooth with a brief pulse of sweet chewy malts and some cherry and plum notes. It then becomes very oak with full-on bourbon and booze drying things out into the finish. Lots and lots of barrel notes going on here squashing out most of the beer-y barleywine flavors."
"reading the other reviews, most of them talk of a beer with head and carbonation. perhaps I've got a bad bottle. shame, it had real promise."
"D - Overall a really good beer; another fine quality brew by the guys at Unita; I think this really takes the cake from the collection of beers; I'm glad they chose to brew a barley wine; I would definitely recommend to others"
"Notes: One of the best barrel-aged beers I've ever had, and believe you me, I have had many. The bourbon and wood flavors are mild enough that they don't hog too much of the spotlight, and they shouldn't overwhelm even the more timid of palate. Extremely drinkable- not at all boozy and much more approachable than the abv suggests. I wish it were more readily available here. A real treat."
"Drinkability is good, I would definitely have it again. Its very inviting and very good. A huge surprise, as my friend talked me into it, and I was very resistant."
"This is definitely a sipping beer that will warm you up on a cold winter day. Well balanced, but not as much bourbon flavor as I was expecting."
"Had to score this one low on the drinkability meter, as I've had some really nice versions of American Barleywine to date. This one required an ice cream pairing to help me finish. I would bet that if I laid one of these down for 3+ years, I'd enjoy it much more - I will be picking up 2 more soon to do so, as the effort is clearly there to make an interesting/unique, and flavor-rich beer."
"Overall I guess the question is where's the barrel? This one is fine, they just need to work on the barrel aging I guess, since it didn't appear to add much. Would have rated it higher if there was some barrel, like it said."
"Poured from bottle into tulip glass. Loads of head, not dissipating. Color is a very dark caramel brown, but when held to the light shows no cloudiness. The smell is muted, I'm not getting much more than a little hops and oak. The taste is 100% better than the nose, wow! This beer is very complex, citrus hops, vanilla, caramel, spices, just the right amount of bourbon. Not boozy at all. Hard to believe the alcohol is so high. This is very drinkable."
"Easy drinking, but not my cup of tea."
"Good stuff, and it's priced reasonably as well."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I can't drink it slowly enough, have to give it an average score just because the ABV is crazy high. Price point was a tad high but it was worth the investment in my opinion."
"Great drinkability, I would pick this up again and again. Wish it was available here in Louisiana. Guess another trip to Utah is called for."
"I'd drink another, any day."
"Overall nice beer. Not what I was expecting...I was expecting more bourbon but this is a much better subtle blend of barrel and beer."
"Pours a moderate dark brown color with some spotty lacing and a bit of a collar. The nose brings some bourbon with a bit of sweetness and some mild caramel. Taste is smooth bourbon along with a slight bit of chocolate and a medium body. There is a slight booziness there and the beer finishes with a slight astringency. Drinkability is decent enough. The bourbon character from the barrel is pretty good, though at the same time I think the base beer could probably use a bit of work."
"Glad I got to try this one, i've seen it on the shelf a few times, but have always passed it by. Now that I know that its aged in bourbon barrels, I can pick it up a little bit but its not too strong, which I prefer."
"D: I liked this beer, and there was nothing wrong with any one part of it, but it just didn't seem to come together for me. I would probably get it again sometime, though it wouldn't be my first choice, and I wouldn't recommend it quite as highly as it was recommended to me. I would recommend it to wine people, but beer people, not so much. 3.5"
"Drinkability- Booziness makes it tough to be more than a solid sipper"
"D: It is a touch oxidized. I think they had some problems with their 750s when then launched them because I saw some super low fill lines when I bought this. They are just starting out though so hopefully they can sort that out. Solid beer overall."
"Fuller body, chewy, and dry in the feel. Sips fairly smooth with decent flavor, alcohol is masked pretty well, although not exactly great overall, especially for a barrel aged beer."
"D: Actually the biggest let down of the Utah brewed beers I've come across. Just too much oxidation to overcome."
"D - This is a pretty good barrel aged barleywine. It isn't overpowering."
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied, slick and has a good amount of carbonation."
"Poured out a dark brown with light brown hues, darker than I expected. A decent head that faded quickly with some lacing. The nose had that barley-wine malt bite/spice aroma, a touch of bourbon and oak. The taste is burnt sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, slightly bitter and malty in the ways a BW should be. The mouth-feel is decent, could be thicker. Decent carbonation levels. A nice barely-wine that I enjoyed drinking, I wish the bourbon was more pronounced."
"D: A decent bourbon-barreled barleywine but the alcohol needs cleaned up, which may occur with time, but I'm not ready to pay that type of price to find out."
"I will definitely be buying these ones.... as soon as I can afford it!! I hope we still have them in a few weeks... Damned trades are seriously depleting the beer funds."
"I would buy a case of this to pop open on every special occasion that I observe over the next ten years. It's that level of special."
"D: The alcohol in this beer is rather well masked--it tastes more like an 8% beer than one that's 11%. It's a great sipper."
"Wood aging done right, I really dig this brew."
"D - Very drinkable, I do love barleywines, and this is a fine example of the style, very drinkable, with no alcohol burn, might not pick this one up, but would gladly enjoy if it found its way into my shopping cart."
"Drinkability: A solid sipper, and one I would've liked to get two bottles of, because I have a feeling that the age on this one will certainly make it worth cellaring in the end. That said, it's good as it is, and is a bit more raucous, though not exponentially, than I thought it would be initially. Verdict: I'd like to try more from the series, and I hope I can get them in the future."
"D: Much lighter than one might expect from a BA barleywine. Surprisingly drinkable for its ABV and style. Overall quite delicious"
"D: This was a very nice barrel aged barleywine. It didn't have much bourbon to it, but there was a great oak character with hints of vanilla. The body was a bit thin, but the alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink. This could maybe improve with age, but it's a quality brew fresh."
"Cockeyed Cooper is a stellar example of a bourbon barrel aged barleywine. Big flavors of bourbon that make sense balanced with huge barleywine malt. It could stand to be a bit more hop forward, but as is it's right up my alley. I don't like spending $15 on a 750ml bottle of beer, but this was worth it."
"I thoroughly enjoyed the day I discovered that Uinta distributes to my area. Boom. This one pours a translucent dark ruby brown topped by a finger or so of thick, creamy ecru foam. The nose dives right into the bourbon and oak, with some maple syrup, citrus hops, vanilla bean and caramel backing that up. The taste is heavier on the hops and adds a bit of leather to the proceedings as well. Beyond that, there are hints of burnt biscuits, oak, bourbon, molasses, and orange rind. The body is a heavy medium, with a moderate carbonation and a thick, gooey feel. Overall, a solid BBBW; it didn't really live up to my expectations, but they were pretty damn high to begin with. There is more than enough here to make you smile...trust me. Get some!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but so very smooth, and the alcohol is very well hidden keeping the overall drinkability up there. Goes perfect with a little Led Zeppelin while chilling out for the evening."
"Impression: Were it possible I would fill my cellar with these. Sadly, it's not."
"The beer pours a red-amber color with a tan head. The aroma is bourbon with some oak and dark fruit notes. The flavor is caramel, toffee, oak, bourbon and some alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Rich syrupy body. A little age should mellow the prominent alcohol flavor. Cockeyed Cooper is on the sweet side of the style, no real hops to speak of. A little too sweet for my palate, but everyone else I tasted it with loved it."
"Overall, I really enjoy this beer. I will admit, though, that I'm biased; I will enjoy almost anything if you age it in a bourbon barrel."
"Pours a very nice amber color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some very nice thick creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, nice little bourbon notes, slightly spicey, slight dark fruit note, licorice. The taste is sweet, malty, slight bourbon notes, a very slight spice, and some dark fruit notes. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well with this brew, this one is not as hot as the BBB. Very drinkable, this was a pleasure to drink."
"d - A decent barleywine. I thought it was a little bit boozy, but I would try it again."
"This is a solid BB barleywine but it seems to fall a little short on body and complexity in the taste. Still, really glad I got to try this one."
"Pours a gorgeous mahogany color, with translucent ruby highlights and a big, inch and half of light brown foam, that quickly settles into some lacing and a few bubbles. Aromas of plums, resiny hops, dark brown sugar and just a hint of wood. On the palate, the alcohol is quite noticeable, along with some dark fruits, caramel, citrus and a small amount of bourbon. Not so much balanced, but rather a bit disjointed. Not a whole lot different from the Anniversary barley wine. Pretty sure this one is not worth the $12."
"EDIT: I would really like to try this side to side with the Uinta BBB, the beers are similar from what I remember but the BBB was a little more potent on the bourbon end."
"Overall, not too impressive. It's not well balanced. The cola is odd and the bourbon and alcohol are overdone."
"Notes: Hmmm, pretty well rounded barleywine... The US side shines with an unapologetic hoppy finish that may need some taming for my liking. Likewise, while quite a remarkable brew and with a good sense of balance, it requires a notch more on the malty/complex side to make it outstanding, maybe a bit of aging will help to take it on that direction since this is rather fresh, and considering that it was a pretty pleasing offering. Ah, with the growing number of barrel and bourbon aged brews it is high time that when possible they start to specify in a footnote what specific bourbon, wine, etc. was hosted in those barrels."
"Thanks, Douglas88, for the opportunity"
"Thank You very much John. my friend Dave said this was one of the best barleywines he has had in a while."
"D: Just okay."
"A nice malty, warming, with whiskey-like booziness, sipper. Bourbon-barrelling gives an oaky/vanilla dryness without overpowering the base beer, with is a nice malty barleywine. An enjoyable sipper, that has a great aroma making it well-worth smelling for awhile before each sip!"
"Many thanks to Wespatrick."
"The drink is firm and lightly-carbonated with a silky, syrupy feel. An extremely tasty brew and a very easy drinker considering the substantial 11.1% ABV and the rampant sweetness revealed at the crown-cracking. One snifterful of BBB would be plenty were it not properly tempered nor I such a greedy bastard. Damned fine."
"Drinkability? It sure is drinkable enough for a 11%abv brew but 1 bottle is going to do me just fine. I'm sure Uinta didn't expect anything other than that for this big bad boy. Very good stuff."
"Hope to get another from the upcoming batch"
"Great for an after dinner treat. Strong, and a great sipper."
