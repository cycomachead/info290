"This is medium bodied and lightly carbonated. I did this beer a disservice by holding on to it this long. Im sure it was better when fresher...if you have one of these, drink it within a year or 2, dont hold on to it too long."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits, malts. Taste is malty, alcohol, dark fruits, easy drinking considering the abv. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer."

"Overall, this is a very enjoyable barleywine, but nothing particularly stands out about it. Good balance, good mouthfeel. Not overwhelming in any way."

"Strong stuff.  It has a dark ale flavor, and has that familiar molasses taste.  Was a little frothy, and the bitterness hits you like a wall after a few sips."

"O:  Decent but not remarkable.  better than some attempts but the hops seem to have faded awful quickly.  probably would have been very drinkable fresh"
"I’m not a barleywine fan but this isn’t half bad.  It loses points on both taste and aroma because I can detect no hops.  Otherwise, it meets the criteria for an American-style barleywine."

"Malty. Breads, citrus, with some mild spice in the nose. Toffee, lots of toffee, plum, berries, slightly citrus, bready, very smooth. A nice barleywine. Not extraordinary but solid. Specific issues with the cloudy-ish look of the beer.. not very appetizing."

"Smells good and the malts dominate the hops. This is the 2nd time I've had this beer and I didn't love it the first time and I still don't. There is some weird flavor going on that I can't figure out but it seems to ruin it for me."

"Aside from the metallic taste that is a bit harsh on the tongue initially, I found this beer to be smooth, sweet and creamy. If not for that offtaste, I'd absolutely love this beer."

"Santa fe got to love a local brew... By local one of the closests in west Texas. Hops are prevalant but in this barleywine it shares the light with the malt well. Pipes dark to medium brown with milk chocolate head. Smell is of noble hops and taste is a decent mix between malt and hops. The aftertaste is clean and subtle ipa like. Overall a good local big beer"

"Burnt orange to amber colored body with a thin offwhite head. Little to no nose. There is a hint of sweetness. The taste is pure alcohol. Just tastes like grain alcohol and acetone. This beer is way off. Nothing wrong with the bottle and purchased recently as well. No bottle dating. Nothing positive about this beer. I got a light sweetness up front that is destroyed by the grain alcohol/acetone taste."

"A decently understated American barleywine, if we're to take their word for it. I think this tastes exactly what an Imperial ESB might want to taste like, so that would default to English all around in my book. Anyways, well-made, and definitely not too heavy, other than in the ABV, which is conspicuous only in its general absence. Wait for it, I know."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Final Thoughts: As my second barleywine, this doesn't appear to be a style that does it for me. It's like a high ABV Belgian gone wrong. I'll pass, but that doesn't mean you should."
""

"I've heard too much about bachelorette parties; now, gimme a beer, dammit! This stuff pours a murky sunset auburn topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises rye-ish biscuit, light toffee, mild tobacco-like greens, a twinge of candied orange peel, and a hint of celery. The taste continues the trend, with a spicy biscuit backbone riding high in the saddle, surrounded by mixed greens that don't pack much of a bitter wallop, but still serve as a minor balance to the malt. There's a slight twang of booze, but nothing that distracts from the main attractions. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a nice, surprisingly easygoing barleywine, one that showcases a balance and a restraint you don't normally find stateside. Good times."

"It's a tasty barleywine, not my favorite but worth a try for barleywine lovers."
""
"O - This isn't a bad barleywine, but its not a great one either. Good."
"A fine heavy yet intriguingly tasty malted beverage. Your palate gets treated to a variety of malt, hop, and boozy flavors that mix well together, always providing nuanced taste treats when allowed to coat the palate. Yes, a damn fine beer..."

"O: This is a nice Barleywine that aged nicely. Letting it warm is definitely the key to success."
""

"O: really enjoyed this beer, it's definitely very tasty but it was overshadowed by the Leon we had right before it."

"O- Excellent interpretation of the style. Not overly complex but not overly dull. it had just the right amount of complexities to keep the nose, the taste and the mouth feel in check . Its very surprising how they got the alcohol so well hidden with a 10%ABV. Worthy of multiple purchases."
""
"O - I'm liking this beer but just wish that the sweetness was dialed back a bit."
""
"22oz. bottle served in a snifter. Poured a hazy, reddish gold with a finger of off white head. Caramelized sugar and hops in the aroma. Medium to full bodied. More caramelized sugar, fair amount of hop bitterness to balance sweetness. Easy drinking for 10% ABV."

"D: not as drinkable as some other barleywines, much less “refined”"
"Overall this beer aged nicely, very smooth, sweet barleywine. Price was also good, cheap quality beer. Nothing in the top 10 for its style but solid enough that I would order one again."

"Just an o.k. beer. Its easy to drink, and packs a punch, but it lacks the depth a good Barley Wine should have."

""

"Overall Impression- More like a traditional English Barleywine, this one missed the style a bit. More hop should have been included and should not have been so hot/sharp. Still enjoyed nonetheless and would love to pick up another bottle of this and sit on it."
""
"A notice to all the micro brews pursuing and passing off this style of brewing as barley wine: a traditional barley wine should be well over 10% ABV -- I've had as high as 18.6 -- and the name implies both the body weight and taste -- comparable in weight to a full-bodied red wine, with a winey mouthfeel and taste defined most by barley, not hops, with an impression of sweetness from the grain. Without these basic characteristics, you're making a full-bodied ale, but not a barley wine, regardless of whether or not barley was used in the brewing."
"Poured maple brown, slight murkiness with scant head. A couple minutes later and it looked quite still, although it did have a very smooth carbonation. Lots of sweetness here. Caramel, brown sugar, and a hint of figs. Very light bitterness in the finish and the sweetness definitely carries further. Quite smooth and delicious. Overall, it's a good American barleywine. I would have appreciated a touch more bitterness, as the sweetness is quite prominent. It did indeed make for a great post-exam celebration. :)"
"O: Goes down ok, somewhat tasty, not too filling, big kick, ok representation of style. This may have needed some more age on it."
"Beer is a bit hot. Not as smooth as other American Barleywines I've had, but certainly still a decent effort. A big boozy slow sipper."
""
"Overall Drinkability - Very smooth. Nt very complex, but very drinkable for the style. Deceptive alcohol. Not very"

"Overall, this is a nice brew and I was glad to get a couple bottles. I wouldn't have sought it out but for my pal Jon, a former Santa Fe resident living up here who said this was his favorite brew. I gave him one of the two bottles I had, and we shared the other one over Thanksgiving dinner turducken. A good beer enhanced by a good time."
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a 1 inch puffy light tan head that settles to a thin cap. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, toffee, and lots of citrus zest. Taste is of malt, brown sugar, and somewhat strong citrus zest flavors. A slight apricot flavor on the aftertaste. There is a medium amount of bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good barleywine but it's a bit out of balance for my tastes. I wish there was more malty sweetness to go along with the hoppy flavors."
""
""
"I'd say aged is the best way to have this beer — if it were fresh, the malt wouldn't be big enough to combat the hops."

"Bronze color though somewhat murky. Not a lot of head though some decent lacing. Malty and caramel aroma right upfront. A very faint whiff of smoke-probably more perceived then actually there. Toffee and buttery flavor. Mildly astringent hop bite. A hair out of balance with the hops. Mildly boozey though not overly so and not in a detrimental way. Sticky and gummy mouthfeel. The upfront sweetness quickly becomes dry. Enjoyable all in. Have wanted to try this for ages. A touch rough in spots but a damn nice US barleywine."
"This pours a nice murky brown color with a decent off white head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of malt and alcohol. The feel is good and somewhat thick. The taste is a little disappointing, I get plenty of the malts, but low bitterness and hops to offset it (i'm too used to the over hopped American barley wines which this isn't) and there is plenty of alcohol heat not well hidden at all."
"O - Not impressed by this well-named offering from SFB... CKBW doesn't keep up with their canned series. This brew is not highly recommended, but worth trying with a group of friends...."
"D ~ Better than the OG. The booze has mellowed out quite a bit over the course of two years, which is a very good thing. Very glad I have a few more to see how it's doing, but it's really at a sweet spot right now. Seek out this vintage."
"Overall, needs some smoothing out around the edges (touch too boozy) but still rather wonderful now. I would love to see a year or two of age on this one. And I particularly like how it manages to be incredibly malty, but not syrupy and never too sweet. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Poured from bomber into vintage Jax mug. This is a stout, delicious and fairly complex beer. I am a fan of barleywines and must say this is probably the most balanced one I have ever had. Pours a beautiful amber red with a quickly dissolving 3 finger head. Pretty nice lacing. Tastes of honey and cherries with a biting but not unpleasant aftertaste of pure alcohol. Great mouth feel, almost a nectar. Smells mostly of cherries. This is one of the easiest to drink barleywines I've ever come across. About as close to a session beer as this style could ever be, not that that's saying much. Excellent, would buy again, cook with and even save a spot in the cellar for."
"Pretty good beer. I let it warm a bit from the fridge. Poured with a small to medium size, thick, creamy, light tan head that lasts a long time and a little lace. Color is a clear cherry orange amber and some bubble trails. Aroma is a pronounced blend of malt, caramel, toffee, hops, fruit, yeast. Flavor is similar to nose and has a very good balance between sweet, bitter, and tang. Body is also very good, full and round with a few high points while carbonation is perhaps just a tad light. Finish is like flavor, has good length, and has some alcohol. A slow sipping brew over the course of a bomber or two."
"Enjoyed this a lot."
"Conclusion: I will seek this out again and see if another bottle shows the same flaws, or if this isn't a tasty beer."
"D - can't handle too much of this one."
"Tastes are chalk, seaweed, sweet malt, barley, flaked wheat, grains, booze, wood, yeast, cloth, strong beer with a little bit of age on them, stuff and hops. Smells are toffee, chalk, mixed drinks, pills, credit cards, aluminum and tin. Mmmmm.... not a sensation, just alright."
"O- I don't think this beer was all too bad. The alcohol seemed to be a little overpowering at times but I think I might have kept my bottle a little too long. I do have another bottle which I will crack open again just to see."
"Really fizzy in the mouth for a barley wine. Carbonation lasts and lasts in the glass. Still it's easy to drink especially if you think of it as an improved product from Champale. Or maybe I'm confusing it with Manischewitz Almonetta."
"This beer pours a reddish mahogany with a very nice off white to light yellow head. Minor bubbles and good lacing. Smell of candied sugars, hot caramel, plums, raisins and cinnamon. Taste is pretty sweet of caramel and toffee malts. The dark fruits are picked up along with some cherries and bitter orange peel. Mouth is medium, sticky and bit hot. Overall a bit unbalanced and hot but I enjoyed this one and would have it again, maybe with a year or two on it."
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma is brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit and alcohol. The flavor is heavy on the brown sugar and dark fruit. I also get some caramel malt and a little bit of piney hops. There is also quite a bit of alcohol warming in the beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice barleywine."
"Notes: It seems to me that this bottle might be past it's prime, or that the alcohol burn is way out of whack. A light American style or perhaps English style barley wine. Not the greatest, but a so-so attempt."
"Still, if you like malt-centric beers this is probably worth trying."
"Pours a murky orange with some reddish tints. A nice bit of off-white head. Smells a bit hoppy and sweet. Lots of nice malt on the nose. Tastes very sweet and malty. The hops are very minimal... Overall not very impressive. Definitely had much barleywines"
"Notes: Nothing remarkable here, at least not for me, and something that I would rather not recommend, neither for those in love with fresh American versions of the style, or those preferring deeper maltier takes, let alone offering this as an entry point for barley wines, sorry. And the overblown bragging on the label dressing the bottle does not help. I'll be game to try it again in the future though, aged or under a different incarnation."
"Thanks to Ratman for bringing this one over to the house last weekend. 2007 vintage. Poured a slightly hazy caramel color, with a short white head. Aromas of prunes, caramel and dark fruits. Full bodied and very smooth, with caramel, dark fruits and sherry."
"Pours rusty orange, thin white head. Smells of wheat, sort of like a bock. Floral and metallic aromas. Taste is, metallic, hoppy florals, phenolic, medicinal. Thin mouthfeel, high carbonation. Pretty disappointing, I had high hopes for this one. Glad to have tried it though."
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Deep amber color, great foamy head, and very nice lacing. Nose is a little malt, with great sweet tones. Flavor is hearty, woody, and a little sweet. Great balance and body. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"I split this bottle with a couple of buddies and drank it with dessert, and think that made the drinkability on this very nice."
"Seems more like an English Barleywine to me. An alright beer for a cold night."
"Feels a bit flat, too. Nothing really stands out here. For the abv, it's easy drinking. I just got a bit bored with it."
"I'm pretty impressed with what I believe is my first beer from New Mexico. Chicken Killer is quite a flavorful American Barleywine that's mild mannered, and relatively balanced. I would prefer a little more in the hop department, but that's my preference for the style. For those who like their American Barleywines more balanced, check out Chicken Killer. You'll likely enjoy it."
"Awesome, an American Barleywine that is not hopped to the hilt. Refreshing to see a balanced Barleywine that does not have to rely on extremes. Hooray for balance! A pleasure to sip."
"Nice medium sized head, faded a little quick for my liking. Perfect color for the style albeit a little light. Fills the nose up, bread like qualities, nice sweet aromas, but a touch too much alcohol in the nose. Taste is the strong point here. Everything I need in an american barleywine is perfectly balanced. Nice layering of the malt, hops, then back to malt with each sip. Good mouthfeel as well. A beer you can chew, as fits the style. Nice job with this one."
"D - I won't drink this again."
"D - This is not my favorite barleywine, but I certainly would not be opposed to drinking it again some time"
"D: I'd drink it over some other stuff, but probably won't buy it again."
"Some chill haze at first but it clears up and reveals an amber liquid with a light white head. Not much sticking to the glass. Smell is rich and full sweet alcohol and toffee. Taste is kind of the same with a good balance of firmly bitter grapefruit hops. A bit of warm fresh brown bread. Some notes of leather, tobacco, and wood in the finish with touch of vanilla. While not hidden, the alcohol is well integrated into the taste. Feel is somewhat slick and syrupy with a gentle carbonation. Some warming from the alcohol as well. Goes down nicely."
"A nice well balanced barley wine. This ale pours a golden amber color with some reddish highlights and thin white fizzy head. On the nose I find you get a good amount of barley mixed with some hops with notes caramel, vanilla, red berry fruit, and citrus. The palate shows a nice sweetness from the barley up front but balances out with the bitterness of the hops as you progress."
"D - Drinkability is good for the Chicken Killer. I had no idea what to expect from this one and have to say, it's pretty solid. It could use something. What that something is, I can't really tell. Hops? I don't think so. The big malty profile seems to work. 9% instead off 10%? Not really. The alcohol never gets too warm to take anything away from the brew. Anyway you look at it. It's good. Glad I got to try it out but I'm not sure I'd seek it out again given the obvious New Mexico - Ohio distro. hurdle."
"Overall Drinkability - 3.5 - Aiming for a hop-head's barley wine, it doesn't quite hit the mark, mainly because of the strong, unpleasant yeast note that stands out. I would prefer a better balance between malt and hop. Personally I find this one too hop-focused."
"Pretty drinkable but I find other BWs a lot more enjoyable."
"D: Chicken killer is certainly a big beer, but it's well balanced. The tiniest sip seems to fill the whole mouth. However, the fusels and hot, burning alcohol flavors are too much, and finishing a bomber single-handed is a lofty task. Medium-low drinkability."
"drinkability: this is a nice example of a barleywine. not sure about it being a ""revolutionary beer that will someday define americas barleywine style"" but it is very drinkable for fans of the bigger cheaper beers."
"Too bad. Still a decent enough beer, but something happened to the Chicken Killer that derailed it from its intended path. Love to try this on tap, or without the funk. I bet it's much better."
"Drinkability: This was an good, but I wasn't wowed by any of the aspects the beer had to offer. Good all-around. Yeah, that's about it."
"D: NO on the drinkability. Tarty fruuityness plus the boozeahol are a bit much. this one is really more of a wine than a beer. (as the name and the style implies.)"
"Overall, this is a barleywine that's not worth buying.Unless..."
"Overall as a big beer, its pretty decent, but as an american barley wine it misses the mark. Needs to be sweeter, hoppier, and needs more body. meh."
"Oh, and for the record, I have known a few chicken killers, and can vouch, they take no hostages, find no nourishment, and seek only to decimate the flock. Santa Fe may have been aiming for this with the alcohol, but a true chicken killer is significantly more rabid."
"Oh. Bummer. It's so not a barleywine. No body, no bitterness, no sweetness. Bummer. With all they say they put into it (twice the ingredients for half the extraction sounds to me like four times the concentration) they could have done so much more. In particular it needs to be sweeter and more bitter. It also needs more body. This is like drinking Andygator. Not so bad in and of itself, I guess, or as a Belgian something or other but not to style and not interesting."
"D-This just didn't do it for me. Very one dimesional. I hate to catergorize a barley wine as weak, but this is it."
"No date on bottle. Ruby red, with thick frothy head after a vigorous pour. minimal head after that. Smell is pear and apple, seems to lack that patented brown sugar smell, so many other bw's have, it's there but has no back bone. taste is dark fruits, some brown sugar, the pear and apple from the nose. bitterness is there in the finish, but not a good hoppy finish. it's rather metallic, coppery. the metal flavor is more pronounced as it warms. Mouthfeel is chewy, sticky, nicely carbed. Drinkability is low. the alcohol content and the strange metallic taste made finishing the bomber a real struggle."
" I was impressed by the brew. I will assume the age did nothing but help it in my scores as well. There were no hops present in this thing at all and the alcohol was hidden extremely well by the flavors and aromas. I enjoyed every drop of my glass. I even saw a craft beer Noob grab the bottle to wring the last few drops from it. I guess we have a convert"
"Drinkability: Middle of the road barleywine that lacks complexity; balanced and easy to drink"
"This is a pretty drinkable BW that doesn't really stand out in any way. Not bad but nothing memorable."
"Overall this is a solid barleywine that's somewhere in between an American and English. Worth a shot."
"D- The flavors are a bit soft and one dimensional and the plastic aroma covers up most other smells. I finished the bottle but it was a but drab to get through."
"All in all, an interesting barleywine but finishing even part of the bomber is a bit of a chore. the alcohol strength is overhwelming at times... possibly just too fresh and hot? Maybe a year would do wonders? the alcohol just creates a bit of a funky flavor profile that doesn't quite jive with me... making it one that I'd hesitate to try again. Maybe it's just an off bottle? I'll definitely give it another try in the future, but for the moment, not a standout by any means."
"Pours a dark, hazy reddish amber, with a super creamy light tan head. Smell is very malty and of alcohol. Taste is super sweet, a lot of maltose here, as well as Carmel and biscuits. Bitterness is only to balance, as the super malt flavor overwhelms, but in a good way. There is also an interesting hop flavor as well. Mouthfeel is super creamy, nice smooth carbonation. Not very drinkable though, half of a 22oz bomber is plenty, the super sweet taste is good, but gets cloying after about 10oz. The alcohol starts to bite at that point too. I would definitely drink this again though, as it is nice to have a non-super hoppy barleywine for once."
"Pours a medium dark amber with a fluffy off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of sweet malts, lots of caramel some toffee, slight citrus hops. Taste is a bit citrus and caramel not a whole lot of depth here. Certainly tasty but kind of one dimensional. Body is a little thin for the style, carbonation is medium, mouthfeel is creamy/syrupy. Alcohol is certainly well hidden. Nothing offensive here, certainly tasty, but there are much better Barleywines out there."
"Thanks Daniel... I have one more of these that is about a year old and will probably age it for another 6 months or so... I'm glad I got to try a fresh version... but this guy could use some time in the bottle to mesh the flavors... it seems like a little of a mash-up right now."
"Despite the fact that I think it needs a little more body, this is a pretty darn drinkable bottle of barleywine style ale."
"Opinion: I am not sure that I really like the sensation associated with drinking this beer. It is odd how it goes down...but it is not a bad beer. I will be letting it warm up over quite some time, so it is changes significantly I may go back and amend this review. This was an alright beer, but I would sure take a number of other Barley Wines over this one."
"From the bomber into the pint glass at room temperature, this one pours a cloudy deep copper color with a meager off-white cover and solid lacing. The aroma is very weak, just a hint of wheat and malt, maybe a touch of alcohol. The taste is a fairly high octane grape with wheaty mild malt, ham and pepper. It grows on you a bit but it is not very well balanced. Medium bodied with lively fine carbonation. Not very drinkable in my book. The flavor is too scant and non-descript to sustain the alcohol harshness. Some butterscotch and licorice. Worth a try but keep it room temperature and give it a chance to mellow on the taste buds."
"Pours with a large, tight, peach hued head. Despite the large head, beer is quite flat. Clear deep copper color. Aroma is light, like fresh baked bread with brown sugar and ethanol. First sip is of alcohol. Middle is like alcohol. And some brown sugar. End is like alcohol. Tastes strongly of alcohol. Some hint of raisins and bitterness in finish. Along with alcohol. Did I mention the alcohol? Seems a lot stronger than 10%."
"6/4/7/3/13 (3.3)"
"Big ""way-back"" props out to BA gbontrag for the hookup."
"Something here I don't like but I can't exactly put my finger on it. Might need to age some more and get less hoppy."
"Color is almost cherry red with cherry and alcohol aromas floating up to the nose upon the pour. A two-finger tan head fades fairly quickly and leaves some diminutive small spots of lacing behind. Upon closer inspection notes of rye, dark fruits and mild phenols arise to the nose. A creaminess is noted on the palate at first. Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied, with a generous amount of alcohol heat being present. The taste involves big sweet malts, wheat, and a fair amount of hop bitterness wrapping it all up. Not a bad barley wine at all."
"I love getting beers like this in the mail because there is no other way I would ever get to try it. But I wont be trying it again, in fact, Im going to have another celebration ale to wash this out of my mouth."
"Pours a thick, clear brown with no head. Molasses, wood, caramel malt, and butterscotch in the nose. Oily mouthfeel. Taste did not live up to the nose. Caramel and bread, with some graininess and a rotten tobacco flavor that, well, doesn't belong in beer. There are far better out there."
"WOW this is the first barey wine i have ever tried, and its pretty overwhelming. that said it's not altogether unpleasant, it pours a cloudy light brown, smells of deep carmel with woody notes, the taste is very rich but with a wonderful array of flavors; at first there is the very strong malty sweetness, along with fruit, wood and carmal flavors. this isn't a beer you can crack open for a barbeque but it's a very intersting experience."
"Overall an enjoyable barley wine that I am glad I had the chance to try. I would say this would be worth another look."
"12/02/06 Walk the Line Barleywine Festival, Dunedin, FL. 2002 vintage. This one had a milder hop aroma. The flavor was very good with a bit stronger dark fruit note and smoother hops. Very drinkable."
"This is a really nice barley wine. The color is a dark and cloudy amber. The smell is slightly sweet and very much in keeping with barley wines. The taste and mouthfeel are excellent. A nice caramel taste with low carbonation. You really can't tell that its 10% alcohol. The brew is also feels thicker than a regular beer and has a nice finish. Definitely would order one again."
"A most drinkable barleywine. Nicely balanced with the caramel malting and the normal barleywine taste,some dates, this one will transition people to barleywines. Brownish colour with good head. Above average mouthfeel, although above average carbonation."
"D: After this beer warms, it is a total delight."
"Pours a hazy dark toffee color, with a small ring of off white head. Smells sweet with a slight citrus hop smell, not too malty. Taste is pleasing, with a good mouth feel, and the alcohol is hidden well. Not an overly complex barleywine, but something new to the category could handle."
"This is a very surprising hit for me. Lots of wonderful malt, and the drinkability can't be beat for the style. This ranks as one of my favorite barleyines now."
"Pours a nice cloudy golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, a nice touch of hops, some slight spices. The taste is slighlty sweet, malty, hoppy, and a touch of spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very nice Barleywine."
"D: Rather good for a barleywine. I put down the entire bomber myself."
"Reviewing a hometown favorite, as un-biasedly as possible. But acknowledging openly that I have a will like this beer. Poured out of the bomber into my glass with a two finger khaki colored head. The head display nice retention in a cobweb like way and it does lace quite well. The brew color itself is wood stain brown. Aromas of malts and ripened fruits. Flavors are sweet and the ALC % is clearly masked (purposefully) by the on-display esters. Fruit flavors, most notably pineapple, in the middle, strong malt presence, and at the end enough hop presence to cut with out doing so sharply. Well thought out, but not subtle. Still, I do consider this as a good example of the style and a well balanced drinkable Barley wine. If you can find, you have to try it."
"Whatever you do, drink this one warm (above 60)."
"O: Took this to a great party. This ended the night, wasn't overly popular, but a good one to curl up with and finish the evening. A monster brew; treat it seriously."
"D - Scrumptious! The alcohol content precludes drinking too many, but it is very tasty."
"I have another bottle that I will reluctantly age. This was so good that it will be hard to keep my hands off of it."
"Taste starts with some herbal hops and toasted bread malts. Rummy fruits and caramel follow. Hop bitterness escalates with a piny, herbal, slightly astringent flavor. Finishes bitter with lingering malt sweetness and some moderate booziness and slight astringency. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Not bad, but either it doesn't age well, or the hops need to be worked on (less astringency)."
"D - While tasty and worth trying I don't think I could drink it often but definitely a very drinkable barely wine."
"Drinkability is low to moderate. Alcohol is high and flavors are sub par making this beer a little more difficult to consume. As I got further into this brew and it warms I figured out the problem. The floral hop profile just doesn't lend itself to a Barleywine. It's more of an off-balance IPA that is too dark. Had they used a different hop strain they probably would have a successful brew on their hands."
"D: After a 'ho-hum' review by BA Metalmonk (who I sent a bottle to), I decided to give it a while longer resting in the cellar; apparently that did some good as it showed up as a drinkable, although not overly exciting, barleywine. Sippable and modeerately worth savoring. Flavors don't 'wow' but have a nice layering, a balanced warmth, and are complex enough to give this a 'thumbs up'. Good effort by Santa Fe Brewing and, officially, my first New Mexican brew (47th to the Union, 39th on my own list of all 50 US states)."
"I acquired this in a trade from turbine2475. Thanks for the chance to try it. Pours dark orange with some ruby highlights. The head fades a bit but settles to a thin cap for the life of the beer. Smells a bit sweet, and a bit hot, a tiny bit bready, and with some spiced pear on the finish. The taste is not nearly so hot and the flavors are more integrated than is indicated by the nose. Some tangy, spicy malt, earthy hops, caramel, pear, honey , and a dry finish that caps it off nicely. Fairly dry and smooth and integrated in the mouthfeel. Pleasant to drink, but you can definitely feel the alcohol creeping up on you."
"D - This is deffinately one for people who like a nice English style Barleywine. Very nice example that I would recomend. Deserves it's name."
"Pours a slightly hazy iced tea color with a shallow fizzy orange tan colored head that fades quickly, leaving little lacing evidence. Quite a bit more suspended goodness as you progress to the inevitable bottom of the container. The smell is also unique. I get a rich malty corn starch caramel and baked vanilla character. The presence of alcohol is more pronounced as this beverage warms up. Full bodied and adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is significantly influenced by the boozy side of the 10% ABV. I find the taste quite enjoyable..exactly what the doctor ordered tonight. Had this one on the WANTs list for some time now. Really glad that i found it at Whole Foods in Arlington,TX. Recommend taking it for a ride around the block."
"This is a fully flavored beast, though, and should be savored at just the right temperature, just the right occasion, sipped slowly, and shared with friends."
"Style is generally for sipping and savoring; this is no exception. Prefer abundance of flavor to provide more bankg for the buck. This is by no means unpleasant but does not deliver desired flavor profile."
"Maybe a little time in the cellar will allow this one to gel a bit better."
"Full body and good carbonation. A nice barley wine, but like most, it needs a fews years to come together."
"I'm glad I tried it, but this one is not for me."
"I don't know if its the warming of the beer or the 10% ABV but this one grows on you. I started out thinking it was a little harsh but about halfway through the beer comes together nicely. Add that to a creamy mouthfeel, a nice bite from the carbonation and spicy hops and this is a easy drinker with some character."
"Mouthfeel is sweet, medium bodied, with doughy yeast hanging on through the finish."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" beige head above the slightly cloudy burgundy amber brew. Head gradually fades to an uneven layer of bubbles, with average lacing. Aroma is sweet fruity maltiness. Taste starts with plenty of sweetness, then goes a bit harsh with the alcohol in the middle, then balances somewhat with fruitiness, and a bit of numbing at the close. Mouthfeel is alright, a little bit harsh, and drinkability is okay as well, improving as it warms."
"M/D: It is slowly getting harder for me to write this because the ale was so drinkable I took to much before writing and now the 10% abv is taking effect. The mouth feel is thick but smooth and kinda creamy. I think the astringent value could have been taperd down a little bit but it is still good. The drinkability is awesome and will definitely by it again."
"Rich and hazy reddish maroon colored pour with an attractive but short lived beige head. Smell is plums, and sweet and tart fruity scents. Medium to thin bodied overall. Flavors of fruitiness and slightly sweet with an abrupt finish and almost drying at the end. A bit warming in the chest, but the alcohol is hidden pretty well for 10%. Very drinkable, and a decent barley wine for sure."
"For all the boasting on the label (""revolutionary", ""will someday define America's unique BW style""), this hardly stands a chance against 100 other better US Barleywines. Maybe they mean ""someday, when we actually brew a killer barleywine..."" Best thing about it is that the 10% alcohol hides with rest of the expected flavors. And the flashes of vanilla ice cream are nice. But considering the style, this is surprisingly, disappointingly Blah."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass. It poured a dark amber, almost brown color that had a very thick white head that left good laceing all the way down the glass. Unfortunatly this is where the excitement ended on this beer. The smell was of malts and a hint of fruity hops. But the first taste ended all enjoyment of this beer for me. It was very very strong on alcohol, that eventually gave way to some malt and hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light, but with the alcohol taste, it warms your palate too much.Overall this beer was not my favorite of this style. It is worth a try, but it may not be for you."
"Pours a hazy dark amber with copper hues, a small cream head dissipates quickly. Aroma is some clean perfumy floral notes, somewhat soapy, noticeable hoppiness and alcohol as well as hints of sweet berry maltiness. Taste is slightly fruity maltiness, grainy, somewhat non descript malt sugars before a decent peppery hoppiness cuts through. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, slightly thick from the maltiness but cut nicely by the peppery hops and a warming alcohol bite. While the aroma and taste didn't blow me away, they were good and I found this to be quite drinkable for a higher abv beer."
"Poured a hazy light brown with orange tinge and slight off white head. Nose was a little funny (not bad) spicy candy smell. Taste is with plenty of malt and perhaps a bit too much on the crystal malt side. Nicely bitter, but not overwhelming. The Taste is again of spices and a tiny bit of bitter orange. Caramel, fruits and brown sugar. Feels quite full in the mouth, and not too sweet."
"d: The label reads, ""Chicken Killer is a revolutionary ale that will someday define America's unique Barley Wine style."" Hmmmm... I hope not. I sought this out just because I liked the name. Oh well. Thanks to JDV for the chance to try this one."
"Not sure exactly what happened here. Feels uneven as far as taste goes and it lacks a smooth flavor. Feel is decent, but there isn't much going on here that is really saving the experience. Maybe it wasnt the best bottle, though I probably won't ever know. I cant say there is any hope that I would try it again."
"Drinkability- Simple recipe...hops and malt, both frolicking together hand in hand. They make a great team in this beer. Nothing over the top incredible, but pretty damn good nonetheless."
"Its alright, but nothing special. There are many far-superior Barley Wines out there, at least to my palate. The label talks it up as though it were the greatest thing since the invention of beer. I will be supremely disappointed if this weak brew will someday define Americas unique Barley Wine style  that would be a travesty."
"Nice taste; I must admit, I've had better barley wines, but this one has a good solid mouthfeel and is a little more drinkable right away. Good finish, I expected a strong aftertaste but was impressed at the lack of such."
"A mostly uninteresting barleywine."
"This is my third bottle of this beer but my first barley wine and I'm curious if they are all this easy to drink. It pours a hazy amber or burnt orange color with a one finger off white, creamy head. Smell is sweet, barley and a hint of alcohol. Taste to me, is a ""brown"" on steroids or an American Strong with more alcohol. I think it is well rounded though. Just remarkable in the mouth. It is sooo hard to believe this is 10% abv. Drink ability...now here is where we need to talk....I have tried many10+abv's in my time, ie. Double Bastard, 120 minute ipa, and quite a few Russian Imperial Stouts, but none of these were as easy to drink as this. It is scary to me that this beer is so good and so easy to drink. If I could afford it I would make this my session beer and pass out enjoying it every night!!! Thanks to Rim Liquor for finding this for me!"
"d: very enjoyable and one easy-to-drink barleywine given the subtle hops. nice output from our new mexican neighbors"
"D: Defiantly not a session beer. Would try this again and recommend to others to see if their tastes differ than mine. Have a few to see if some of the rough edges smooth out with some time."
"The beer pours from the 22 ounce brown bottle, a beclouded amber color with a modest head that is off-white and creamy in texture after desiccation the lace forms a fine covering for the glass. Nose is malt sweet, with a hint of hops and even alcohol. Start is quite sweet with a decent malt profile and the top moderate in its feel on the palate. Finish is delightfully acidic, the hops delectable in their spiciness, sweetness carries through to the end, hops adequate and the aftertaste a bit dry."
"Nicely balanced, and the 10% abv is well hidden."
"This beer is a nice ruby red with a small head that is sustained in my new Samuel Adams glass. The smell is malty and there are hints of apricots as well as other fruits. The taste is sweet and the abv shows a litte. The mouthfeel is smooth, much like a cask ale. This brew is a real pleasure to drink but it is a sipper for sure. Try to rush this one and you'll end up with warm ears and red cheeks. I would drink this beer again."
"A sipper for sure but a good beer to drink."
"This is an enjoyable brew, somehow it is not quite integrated though. At times it can be a touch disjointed; this doesn't keep it from being tasty, but I could certainly see how this could be quite a bit better. All it really may need is a little age; perhaps six months to two years may just be what this beer needs to achieve new heights."
"Drinks great for the ABV. Skews to an English style BW IMO, fans of those will love this. A little more finesse with the malt & or alcohol taste than this offers or some more hops to get this to the upper ecehelons of BWs. Still way better than the 1st time I had it, but snow is falling, maybe it's all about the weather??"
"22 ounce bottle. Amber colored with a small white head. Initially I was thinking this was a pretty average barley wine. Then it seemed to smooth out and open up. It turned out to be a really excellent malt accented barley wine, with hints of vanilla and caramel covered fruits."
"Taste is massive fruit, plums, raisins, dates, figs, citrus hops. Very nice carbonation and mouthfeel, slick and very creamy. I really like this one, just wish I could get more."
"Finish: raisins."
"Bottom line: I picked this one up on my last trip to Ft Collins and it's a good example of the style. I'd buy it again."
"Overall - Doesn't quite live up to my expectations. As for the quote above, yes, it is unique. Will it define American barley wines? I doubt it. But still quite enjoyable."
"22oz bomber poured into a Chimay chalice. The color was dark ruby red with a nice white head floating on top. The head subsided into a light white coating of the surface of the beer. The smell was really good with dark fruits, toffee, and a little nuttiness. The taste is really good in the front, more nuttiness and toffee, chewy almost. The aftertaste sucks as it is really phenolic and weird. The beer got better as it warmed but the aftertaste killed it. If aging could kill that aftertaste this would be a real winner. The label was a little pretentious as it stated that this beer would someday define the American barleywine style. Um, no. There are far too many barleywines that exceed this by leaps and bounds (bigfoot, ruffian, numbskull, behemoth)."
"Overall, a strange beer. Excellent appearance and mouthfeel, just off on the nose and flavors."
"D - Easy to drink and deceptively strong. I enjoyed it enough that I am bringing a growler home to New Hampshire to share with friends."
"Just not a very good representation of the american barleywine style. My least favorite of the Santa Fe beers."
"I plan to try the latest batch on tap this weekend at the brewery. And by the way, the brewery has moved and expanded and added restaurant service. So get out there and support these guys in their new investment. I dont want to see this place go under from the added weight!"
"Looks slightly hazy light brown with orange tinge and slight off white head. Smells a little medicinal with a funny (not bad) spicy candy smell. Taste is with plenty of malt and perhaps a bit too much on the crystal malt side. Nicely bitter, but not overwhelming. The taste is again of spices and a tiny bit of bitter orange. Feels quite full in the mouth, and not too sweet. Not sure I'd want too many of these though. Decent, but I don't think I'd chase this down; I may also have had this a little early as well. A good start for this New Mexico brewer."
