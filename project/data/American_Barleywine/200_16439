With my fiancé not here to help me polish this bomber off, I’m not so sure it’s going to happen.

3.78,1.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours hazy/cloudy very dark brown color with a small dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. A bit strong on fruitiness, but not bad. Taste of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light amount of earthy hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth and moderately creamy/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good barelywine style. All around good complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruitiness, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 06, 2014"

Color is a very nice, clear garnet with red highlights. Aroma is dry and bitter malt with hop. Flavor is similar to nose but has some sweetness behind the up front bitterness. Body is full yet soft.

Light mouthfeel, near flat--it could use a little more carbonation. An OK drink, this one follows the English Barleywine style better than the American Barleywine.

ALmost a coca-cola-like sweetness on the back of the tongue. No substantial hop presence...I could liken it to having a very chocolatey piece of cake without anything to drink (esp. not milk). That seems to be a major downfall of the less-than-stellar barleywines. the ABV is well hidden. Mouthfeel is a bit light. Carbonation is smooth.

Very intense and tempting. The flavor comes on with thick, almost chocolatey, nutty merlot. I get some molasses and currant. Fairly full bodied with a slightly satin feel and polite carbonation.

Generally it's the hop profile that turns me off but not this time. Halfway through the bomber this barleywind began to grow on me but now towards the finish line I'm second guessing. Aroma is decent, very sweet with an alcohol push. Dark amber pour with a medium brown tint, minimal head and no lacing. Drinking this makes my pucker and the alcohol really stands out as it warms, hate to admit but the alcohol is almost too overpowering. Flavor is very sweet with a touch of sour fruit, has a cheap red wine quality to it once it hits room temperature. The strong alcohol is really too much to bear.

No murky sediment floating in the first pour here, so the unspoilt look was quite nice. The smell was clean, sweet, and toasty. There was ghostly remnant of hop aroma as well, but it was swept aside by the malt. The taste was sultry smooth, and tongue coatingly sweet. Raisins, plums, and roasted almonds were all present in the taste, and were melded together very well. There was no alcohol apparent in the taste, but the warmth that started in my mid section after just a few sips, and slowly radiated to my extremities made it well known, that this was no ordinary beer. A little coarser in the mouthfeel than I was anticipating after aging for this long, but I wouldn't say it was harsh.

A simple, yet enjoyable odor. Taste is incredibly sweet, very full of caramel, almost to the point of a caramel candy aftertaste. Hop bitterness balances this malt bomb towards the end of the taste progression, thankfully. Alcohol, while certainly a noticeable flavor component, doesn't overwhelm. Body is surprisingly thin for a beer of this magnitude, perhaps due to the fact that carbonation is virtually a nonentity. This beer is certainly not overly complex, but it has no flaws, and, for a barleywine, exceptional balance.","mjc410","Aug 09, 2006"

The alcohol is pushing the envelope a little, any bigger and I may not enjoy it, but at this level it is a nice spicy bite in the finish that grows stronger as it reaches room temp.

To the nose, piney, grapefruit hops, soured caramel, rich malt, and a hint of alcohol sting searing my nose-hairs.

First taste: VERY sweet, some ripe fruits, a little bit of a sweet, syrupy aftertaste. Lots of warming alcohol. Difficult to savor, even sipping, because of intense sweetness and wierd aftertaste. I'd rather plunk down $4.00 for a bottle of Old Nick's, another widely available mid-range barleywine. I feel like this is a tough style to absolutely master, but then again lots of mendocino brews have left me with that "ehh" feeling afterwards so I guess I'm not that surprised.

Not as much of a hop bite as many American interpretations of this style, and it could probably use a bit more bitterness for balance, as it comes off as very sweet. Thick and malty, this one is a "true style" sipper of a brew, with a warming alcohol kick that you won't taste as much as you will feel. So sweet and boozy that I could feel its sugars and alcohols burning through me. This isn't always a bad thing, but I felt like it was a bit much here. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, which certainly is permissible for the style. The true style, if you will. I probably didn't need the whole 22 ozs., as a 10 oz, glass probably would suffice. Warming.

Pine is immediately noticeable in the smell, along with a bit of ripe fruit and a wallop of alcohol. The tase manages to be just a bit better balanced than the smell, with the alcohol taking a more subdued role in the affair. It's less bitter than most BWs brewed on the west coast.

It is overpowering in it's tartness and sweetness, but it's not bad. Some molasses flavors come through that make it a bit too sweet. Overall it is a good barley wine, but not a daily drinker.","BrewMaster","Aug 28, 2004"
4.12,10.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer evacuates the 22 ounce brown bottle a transpicuous burnished copper color with a planetary sized head the is frothy in texture and the color a toothsome light tan color, the resultant lace a thick blanket to cover the glass. Nose is rich in malt, hints of caramel, molasses maybe, plum like, earthy and hearty to the senses this beer. Start is sweet and rich in malt, the top moderate to full in its feel to the palate. Finish is respectably acidic, the hops hail and hearty in their spiciness, and the beer quite dry with a bit of alcohol bitterness, a for sure belly warmer this one and one not made for the palate challenged drinkers.","Gusler","Jul 27, 2004"

4.5,20.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This brew should be enjoyed for what it is, not for what it should be. It is full bodied, complex, and smooth. It is endowed with a profuse and luxurious smell and a relaxed mouthfeel that sits like a heavy blanket on a winters morn. This is a premium barleywine  a slow sipping work of considerable craftsmanship.","RedDiamond","Apr 21, 2004"
3.65,-2.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I was really surprised to see a new barley wine on the market and even more surprised to see that it was from Mendocino. The beer poured with a nice head and a potent hop nose. The color was dark amber and looked great. The taste was that of a nice rich hoppy barley wine  may be a bit too sweet for some. The taste is long and lingering with definite alcohol warmth. As it warms, the flavors come together much better. There is no vintage dating but some time may help round out the syrupy sweetness. A good attempt and I hope they start brewing bigger beers. Berkeley Bowl","lou91","Mar 21, 2004"
