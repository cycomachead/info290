The aroma is disappointingly muted, with only a mild grainy sweetness and a light pine character being discernable. The flavor is more forward, with woody hops being balanced against subtly sweet caramel malts. It's not too boozy or sweet as many barley wines can get, and rather just provides a full balance of flavors. The medium body and light carbonation further help this one from getting too syrupy. Overall, despite being comparatively mellow for a 10% barley wine, the rich flavors one would expect still come through.","devilben02","Feb 27, 2014"

The hops have faded quite a bit here and a little bit of oxidation is creeping in. The mouthfeel is almost thin, but that sounds worse than it is, the upside is that is really easy to quaff.

Aroma consists of deep caramelized malt with quite a bit of green hoppy notes. Taste is also a mix between some overly sweet caramelized malt with some stalled green hops that don’t really mix that well with the malt backbone. Body is about average with medium-to-low carbonation and light apparent alcohol. There is something off balanced in this beer that I didn’t particularly enjoyed.","Phyl21ca","Dec 08, 2013"

Flavor is bitter and sweet at once, and finishes thick and creamy on the palate. Everything about this brew is big, bold, and full of hops. The alcohol warms, but isn't overly boozy.

I get a lot of caramel in the smell, with raisins, and a little bit of crackery smell too. This one has a hefty malt presence, with a slighty fruity hoppiness. The taste has a bit more of the hoppiness that has come to be the norm in an American Barleywine. It's like eating pollen coated cake. The bitterness is not too strong, thanks to the incredible sweetness, but it does a great job of balancing. There is definitely a flowery presence, and the consistent orange is vary nice in this. The malt is still the winner I believe, which is a nice change of pace. Very bready, and very raisiny as well, with a slightly drying finish, despite the heavy sweetness up front. The body is a nice medium, with pretty low carbonation, which helps to sort of thicken it up and enhance the sweetness. The alcohol provides a nice warmth, but not a burn really.

Luckily for this one there is a back and forth between both ranges, and the hoppiness does not take over entirely given a pretty nice sweet range, and when it is in command it still has a nice sweet identity as an undercurrent.

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"A very nice sipper that everyone enjoyed. Still have another bottle in the cellar. This one has held up well.","drumrboy22","Dec 03, 2007"
4.03,4.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Aroma smacked me with the sweet malty caramel, moderated with a pine hop. Sweet BW, smooth and slipping down like a 2 year old on the playground slide. No idea that this packs a 11% wallop. Very hard just to sip just a tasty, easy drinking brew.","Vancer","Nov 20, 2007"
4.01,4.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"One and done for sure, but I look forward to having another. Somewhat similar to Old Ruffian, or maybe a mix of DFH 90 & 120. Lives in that zone of a very sweet DIPA or a very bitter barleywine. Very good, and will have to invite the Devil to the holiday celebrations!","","Beers"
4.35,13,4.5,4.5,4,4,5,"Expected a much stronger taste based on past barleywine ales. Was unbelieveably smooth and drinkable. Would have had 2 had the first one not gone directly to my head. Followed it up with a Porter to finish out the visit. Had just stopped by to fill up growlers for tailgating and decided to stay for one (or two).","PaulieD","0"
3.84,-0.3,3,4,4,4,3.5,"This certainly hides the alcohol quite well, I never would have guessed it was near 12%, though this would never be mistaken for a light weight. The hop character is still fairly vibrant, and this certainly has not picked up much age or oxidation yet. This beer becomes more enjoyable as time goes on; it has become a fitting beer to end the night on.","Gueuzedude","Dec 08, 2006"
3.58,-7,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Chestnut red in color with 2cm of rich white head, served in a regular 8 oz glass. Smells of sweet caramel and spices. A very strong spice flavor with a caramel sweet finish, alcohol presence noticeable. Very sweet with a medley of spices in each sip. Great taste, lovely lacing on the glass, worth a drink each year when its released.","HopDerek","Nov 16, 2006"
3.9,1.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Im sad i gave a 3.5 on the drinkability. This is probably more my prefernce than anything, but it seemed just a little (tiny bit) too sweet syrupy for my taste with the style. While Im going to love the growler, for a beer that doesnt come in bombers, 64oz will be just a bit too much for 1 person over 2 days.","JasonA","Nov 13, 2005"
3.71,-3.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,3,"Mouthfeel is medium- to full-bodied, sticky sweet, then some pucker in the middle, and some astringency in the finish, with residual sticky-on-the-lips sweetness. Pleasant sipping. Drinkability is OK, but if I had wanted a second beer it would have been Venom APA.","dickroop","Nov 05, 2005"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Deceptively drinkable. Make no mistake this is one big beer.","MaltyGoodness","Jul 29, 2005"
3.43,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Overall, I didn't dislike the beer. It needs to be bottled, aged and come back to. Very aggressive beer, even for the style.","Dithyramb","May 16, 2005"
4.17,8.3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Had this from a snifter at Xmas in July. Pours a dark burgandy/brown with a thin head that quickly fades to a small ring, no lacing to speak of. Nice fruity nose---oranges, pineapples, grapes, figs all marked with a distinctive alcohol. As the beer warmed a little a floral hop scent emerged. Taste is a deep sweet caramel malt infused with dark fruits balanced by a decently strong hop bite. Alcohol makes itself known from the getgo, and is a little to agressive for my tastes. Medium bodied with a nice fine carbonation level, this feels great in the mouth. This is a very good effort by Duclaw at the style..","cubedbee","Jun 28, 2004"
3.7,-3.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Had this at the Maryland Springfest '05. It has a nice dark ruby complexion and the head goes away fast. The volunteers pouring this were wasting too much of it as I stood in line it pissed me off, I wish one of the brewers would have said something. Another thing was that I bought a Devil's Milk snifter and they wouldn't pour the beer in it so I had to transfer from my plastic cup into the snifter. At 11% this barleywine that has several months on it still seems rough. It is definatley an American as the bold C hops are present and there is some nice sweetness left in the malt. The alcohol comes through a little too much as the malt can't contain it and the hops can't mute it. An enjoyable barleywine, something I would buy on occasion.","Higravity","Apr 03, 2004"
3.98,3.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel and drinkability: Mouthfilling, unctous almost. And so I would have to call this a sipping brew, rather like a fine cognac.","Hefe","Dec 31, 2003"
3.77,-2.1,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Not very smooth or contemplative. Very raw for an aged barleywine. This is a rude American interpretation.","ManekiNeko","Dec 04, 2003"
3.63,-5.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Appearance was quite good. The beer was poured into a special ""Devils Milk"" release glass - a 11oz logo'ed challice. Nice touch. Smell was marked by a strong alcohol scent, along with some firece hops. Taste was good, the archtypical, websters-definition barley wine flavor. (Perhaps this beer was served too early to have developed any real character of its own?) Pretty easy to drink down too, It'd be easy to forget about the 11% ABV. Overall Devils milk is really only a standout as a bone-fide barley wine being brewed and served by a chain brew-pub. Well worth a drink if it's on tap, but not worth an out-of-the-way trip to the brewers.","sideshowrob","Nov 02, 2003"
3.09,-19.7,4,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This year's Devil's Milk was a little bit disappointing, so I'll have to be sure to try it again next year! Its short head of creamy off-white foam receeds quickly (as might be expected considering its strength), but it still leaves some limited splashes of lace about the snifter. The hazy mahogany body appears darkish on the bar or table but reveals a glowing ring of orangeish gold at the rim as you raise the glass to your lips. The aroma offers some dried apricot and tart baking apples (acetaldehyde) along with a waft of alcohol over a limited amount of malt. The body is medium and it's soft in the mouth with a fine carbonation. Its flavor delivers a well-balanced combination of alcohol; bitterness; and straight-forward, just slightly caramel-touched malt. It finishes dry with some lingering malt, bitterness, and apple.","NeroFiddled","Beers"
4.47,16.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dark Amber with plenty of sweetness and complex malt notes. Pours with a thick head and parallel-line lacing all the way down. The mouthfeel is beautiful and one almost regrets having to swallow. When you do the ample sweetness gradually fades and leaves a tangy finish. Overall among my favorite barleywines with almost no taste of the warming alcohol.","farHillsBrewer","0"
