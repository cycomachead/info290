"Deep amberin color with razor thin heqd and minor lacing.  Smell is pungent hops, alcohol, black licorice, strawberry, and a minor cofffe note. Taste is hoppy up front, sweet fruit in the middle, and a lingering bittersweet oily finish.  Mouthful is medium with medium carbonation.  Overall a nice beer but not what i was expecting from a barleywine."
"dark amber with light khaki head, touch of lace, Assertive hop aroma of eucalyptus with a touch of grapefruit. Flavor has hops upfront followed by burnt sugar/ caramel and orange marmalade finish. Tasty. strong. A beer with character."
"Velvet hammer here. Appearance is a large, long lasting, tan to cream-colored, thick head, plenty of lace, and a clear, dark amber hue. Aroma is leather, dark ripe fruit, dark malt, yeast, hops, and lumber. Flavor’s similar to nose, with sweet being up front and bitter heavy in the finish and just right carbonic tang to balance. Body is good, but the heavy bitter yields some coarseness. Ditto for the finish, with some off flavors, though overall, I’d definitely have, just not right away. I'd be especially curious to try it with some aging."

"Surprisingly drinkable for a barley wine."

"Randomly came across a 4-pack of this and didn't have very high expectations, but I really like this one...may even be one of my favorite non-BA barleywines that I've tried to date. It's a bit nuttier than I expected, but it works well and is balanced by a lingering hop bitterness and some heat on the back-end. Even so, the alcohol is pretty well-masked and so it isn't too boozy at all. Overall, a real solid barleywine for a reasonable price."

"Overall- Wonderful balance of flavors, being quite young the hops are very forward and present in the beer. Beautiful hop character though, strikes a harmony with the toasted sweet malts and sticky dark fruits lying underneath. Nice, enjoyable sipper, alcohol quite noticeable."
"Overall:  pretty good barley wine.  A little bitter from the roasted barley.  But good.  Big and heavy."

"Overall a nice barleywine!"

"O: a very good barleywine."
""
""
"Best before 12/2/14. Dark brown opaque, half inch light brown head that settled to a nice film that laced nicely. The aroma is fantastic, with rich dark fruit notes, lotsa raisin, toffee and some piney notes.  The flavor is similar, with caramel malt, figs, raisins, and a bit of hop bitterness. The alcohol is definitely present in the taste. Mouthfeel is pretty heavy for a Barleywine, with a very nice finish and aftertaste, nicely carbonated. Overall, this is a very nice beer, I'll probably be looking out for this one again."
""
"Overall it's a good effort for the style. If a smokey and bitter barleywine sounds nice try this out."
""
""
""
"Huh - for all the guff and mockery that I've heard about Utah brewing in general, at home and abroad, this offering really sloughs off all that inanity - big and brash, hoppy and malty, in layers that I can't possibly appreciate from this single instance in time. Worth trying, if only to see how it's doing, and right now for me, it's doing just fine."

"O - Intense amount of hops, barley, malt, and alcohol but rounded off nicely with strong fruits.  A fantastic offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a slightly murky brown body with a thin head. Smells of caramel, dried fruit, figs, piloncillo, and PNW hops. Tastes sweet; lots of caramelized malts. Very toasty: more so than I would have imagined from the taste. Aftertaste has some roasty coffee notes. Hops are prominent and resinous/grassy. Mouthfeel is fullish with some tingly carbonation. Overall, this is a solid barleywine, but nothing to go crazy about."

"My bottle was picked up from a bottle shop the date of the bottled on is 10/12/12...I bought it 2/28/14. Overall appears a deep murky mahogany brown hue big tan head forming thick, with fine speckled lacing. Smells like an aged barleywine, what does that mean the hops have tamed, the malts are full of over ripened fruit and big alcohol notes. The smell is of spicy plum and raisin notes, that I can't quit sniffing on. Dark fruit, brown sugar, malt layers in the flavor, nothing like an aged Bigfoot, a hint of diacetyl or wet cardboard in the malt character just from oxidation. Plum and dark fruit sugars coat the palate, not bad at all...well aged smoothed out Anniversary IPA bottled on 10/12/12. Mouthfeel is creamy, effervescent carbonation medium bodied texture. Overall it's good barleywine, I'm intrigued to see what this beer tastes like fresh, with 2 years of age it's fantastic."
""
""
"o: I had this last summer and loved it, but somehow missed writing a review. This second single bottle confirms my recollection of it as a superior barleywine."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Recommended for fans of American-style barley wines. Not excellent, but it's pretty good."
""
""
""
""
"O- Time does this beer a favor. Wasn't an amazing beer, but was pretty solid. If I see this beer at a good price, I'll totally grab a few and throw them in the cellar. Cheers!"
"Overall a solid barley wine, nothing spectacular but worth the try. I threw two in the cellar to see if it really falls of after a few months. Will update"
""
"A big abrasive barelywine. Not bad, just to much for me. Everything is pretty overwhelming here. Worth a try, but not something I am dying to come back to. Maybe I should hold on to the rest of the 4 pack for a while and see where this goes?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A malty and perfumey lemon-pine American barleywine that's enjoyable to the end. Worth a try for you ABW fans."
""
"It's probably one of the more easy drinking barley wines and it's good."
""
"O- a good ale, less a traditional barley wine than just a good ale"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a fine beer in this style. Probably a one or two beer night due to the high abv. Enjoy!"
"overall it drinks easy for a big beer - nice flavor and easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Overall I think this, just ever so slightly kicks old guardian's, and bigfoot's butt. I found this to be less hop forward than the aforementioned. Try this if you get the chance, its well worth the 3$ per 12oz price."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled 3/19/13. Pours a brownish ruby with a one inch off white head, that leaves behind loads of lace. Smell is toffee, caramel, biscuit, earthy hops, and hints of fig. Taste is loaded with toffee, brown sugar, fig, and a blast of caramel hangs around in the tongue. Body is fairly large, nice carbonation, a touch dry, and easy drinking for its heft. Very nice!"
""
"O: This is an excellent beer. Quite a bit hoppier than I was expecting but it balanced nicely. This is a big beer at 10.4% but drinks quite a bit lighter. If I had bought the 4 pack, I could see these being dangerous."

"Possibly my favorite new barley wine. Suberb lacing that clings to my glass like a net. Murky, nut-brown appearance with gold around the edges. Aroma is equally malts and hops; sweet leather, prunes, blackberries, a brandy-like alcoholic hotness in the nose. First sip is equal parts piney, resiny hop bitterness, and syrupy sweet alcohol warmth. Characteristics of an Arrogant Bastard distilled to 10.4% ABV, meaning I taste a similar hop profile (Chinook).Warms down the throat all the way to the belly. Thick and viscous in the mouth with a mild carbonic bite. Truly outstanding and worth trying if you see it."
"O: So nice to pick a winner with limited dollars. A vote of confidence for exploring the rest of the Uinta menu. Good job, brewers."
""
""
"O: Hop bitterness is littered throughout this barleywine. Even though the malts keep right up with the hops, the bitterness winds out in the end. So, if you enjoy a hop-forward American barleywine, this one could definitely fit the bill"
""
"Overall- Above average to almost good. A boring barleywine but still pretty tasty. Worth a try. You might find you like this low-key, high alcohol offering."
"O- Overall this is an excellent representation of the style. In addition, the price is right. It seems to be readily available at the moment as well. I would like to lay down a few four packs of this and see how it matures. Since there is some bitterness and a lot of complexity, I think this would be a great candidate for a couple years of aging. Cheers."
""
""
""
"O: Another fine offering from Uinta. This beer isn't too complex or wild, but very enjoyable. This is my first barley wine so I do not have anything to compare it to, but as an introduction to the style I like it a lot."
""
"Although I like Uinta, I was a bit disappointed with this barleywine. I held on to it for a few months (probably should have been more), but I expected to like it more than I did. It seemed to be lacking in most areas--a bit thin, average taste, not as much complexity as I'd hoped. Even the alcohol didn't seem to be too present. It seemed to be lacking something, and that's sad. I'll revisit this some day, but it won't be on my regular rotation of barleywines, like Insanity, JW Lees Harvest Ale, Solstice d'hiver, and Lower de Boom."

"O - 4 - good beer, tastes a lot like Sierra Nevada's barley wine, I like it"
""
""
""
"O: Really nice entry, especially considering the 4-pk was only $9.99."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bold, boozy, malty! An eye-popper of a beer and will bring a smile of delight to big beer lovers..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the milder side, but still a tasty barleywine. Worth a try."
""
"O - A quality beer. I've had many a barley wine, some better than this, but not many. Overall, it has everything I look for in a good barley wine with a few little surprises (Nutty hints in the smell and a very crisp finish). I recommend."
"O: Good barleywine. Some will dislike it low sweetness, but I enjoy the fact it's not cloying. I'm not sure how much I'd like this fresh; this seems like it's at the perfect age."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Maybe I should have aged this for a bit. The taste is fairly complex but the saltiness is very offputting. Probably wouldn't revisit this"
"O: It is a weird barleywine. It is heavily hopped and tastes like a weird IPA, but the barleywine comes through a little bit and kind of ruins it. The malty sweetness backbone tastes really odd and kind of ruins it. I would say it tastes like a bad Bigfoot. The aftertaste is no good."
"Overall: I celebrate the anniversary of Uinta by letting them know this was a spot on brew. I'm not even finished with it and I feel a bit toasty. After trying this and Stone's barley wine brew, I have discovered that I'm fond of this style; complexly flavored and unique. Cheers."
""
""
""
"Flavor has more caramel, with some more burnt, caramelized notes. A touch of molasses plus a hint of dark fruit mix together. The finish is a tad dry, and the floral hop aspect is more noticeable at this juncture. Reminds me of a solid English style BW, perhaps like Victory Old Ho... Prosit!!"
"1568"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really enjoyed this. I am not a big hop fan but this is definitely one of the better hoppy barley wines I have had. Bigfoot is almost too aggressive... Nogne #100 is is hopped to the point it doesn't even seem like a barley wine anymore. But this grapples it in and fits the American bill on the style."
"Overall: I like this beer. The rich malt and toasty aroma is my favorite aspect. It's pretty well balanced and the alcohol is hidden. This is my first beer from Uinta and I'm not disappointed."
""
"Good bitter brew here. But much of the complexity I'm sure that went into this ends up hidden behind a massive bitter wall of hops. I wanted rich complexity and I got an overdone overhopped beer. I appreciate the effort, but I won't be having this again."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/22/20111. Pours very hazy and cloudy; almost opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, pine, raisin, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, citrus zest, floral, and piney earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity; but are pretty weak for a barleywine. Taste of toffee, toast, caramel, raisin, brown sugar, pine, brown bread, floral, grapefruit, orange zest, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Light pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of toffee, caramel, toast, raisin, pine, brown sugar, brown bread, grapefruit, orange zest, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt complexity; with a good amount of hop balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice barleywine style. Good balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"This was a very well done Barley Wine. The complexity level was slightly higher than a SN Bigfoot, probably because the hop profile seemed dialed down a bit. Also do yourself a favor and let this one get some time on it before diving in."
""
""
""
"Dark brown with ruby hues, a thick quilt of light caramel. Smells uber-fruity: plums, raisin, some spiced persimmon. Then there's a hit of brewer's licorice, vanilla, and burnt sugar mixed with vinyl. Taste is booze, then some bitterness, then some sweet malts, then some more booze. Really can taste the ethanol here - in a bad way. Medium body with moderate, tickle carb and a semi dry finish. I'm uncertain I'm gonna finish this. Waaaay too boozy."
""
""
""
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a dark mahogany brown with a fine one finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Classic barleywine aroma of dark and dried fruit, caramel malt, light pine and citrus hops. Flavor follows aroma with caramel malt, dark dried fruit, citrus. Finishes semi-dry with grassy and pine hop bitterness. Alcohol warming, but well covered. Medium to heavy bodied with some creaminess. Flavor is somewhat subdued, but well integrated and with a nice flavor progression. The flavor drops off a bit in the finish to reveal the hops, which are nicely presented. Well made and enjoyable."
""

"12oz. bottle served in a tulip. Bottled on 9/20/2012 on the label. Pours a chestnut brown with red highlights when backlit. Clarity is semi-hazy and head is a quarter-inch, cream-colored and frothy. Head eventually disperses into a tight band around the shoulders with an oily slick across the surface. Sheets and clusters of lacing exhibit excellent retention during the tasting and are refreshed with each tilt of the glass. Nose expresses some malty sweetness, candied prunes and piney hops. Taste follows nose; however, the piney hops are quite forward and suppress the malty sweetness. There's also a touch of chocolate in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a pretty good small format, easily accessible American Barleywine. Alcohol is really quite well-hidden. It might be worth putting a couple of these in the cellar to see what happens as the hops character dissipates over time."
""
""
""
""
"A nice little barleywine. Maybe it's lacking defining character, but it tastes carefully crafted. Wouldn't choose it above others that are easily-attainable, but I woudn't knock it either."
""
""
""
"Big Thanks to Illudium for the sample!"
""
""
""
"This is a great Barleywine, absolutely delicious. One of the best I’ve had. An unbelievable malt/hop balance and so much to appreciate."
"D - Nice hoppy barleywine. Great overall balance and smoothness."
"O: This beer is very dry for the style, but quite nice. It's over 3 years old, but I get very little oxidation flavor. I enjoyed this."
""
"O: I tend to prefer english style barleywines that don't have as strong of hop character, but especially for the price, this one is definitely worth it. Has all that nice barleywine malt character, with a hop quality that balances everything out nicely. Drinks very smoothe and easy."
""
"O- A potent brew for malt lovers with a great hop kick. Not very complex but that could come with age."
"This is a bitter beer, but not puckering or super dry. It's welcomed since the sweetness could get out of hand quickly. Very drinkable for the abv, which isn't shy."
""
""
""
"O: A very solid sipper. Take your time and enjoy with some gouda cheese."
"O - Very good and on point. You get enough of the barleywine aspect of the beer and some hops as well. Nicely done!"
"This used to be about the only barley wine sold in Utah. I'm glad to see it elevated from occasional to year-round. From the 12 oz bottle bought at the Utah Liquor Store in Sugar House."
""
""
""
""
"Not a complex barley-wine, but well balanced and decently crafted."
""
""
"O: This is a very hoppy and bitter barleywine—something that hopheads could enjoy (especially if they drink it cold). If you are looking for something with more complexity you need to let this one fully warm up to let the malty flavors develop a little more. The alcohol isn't that noticeable in the taste."
"I drank one of these about 8 months post bottling and reviewed this one at about 18 months post bottling. It is for sure better now than fresher. The time really did help this one along as far as calming down the booziness and helping the alcohol and hops to meld into the caramel and toffee. Solid barleywine for sure. Glad I have 2 more 12oz to sit on for a while longer."
"This is a very good example of a barleywine. I wish I had some bottles in my basement aging for the next ten to fifteen years."
"O. Good and flavorful. Sometimes a barley wine can go heavy on the alcohol and feel almost like vodka was added, but this is tamed but still has an intriguing taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Better than I remember it! I remember liking it but this is a great American Barleywine. I'm a big fan of what Uinta does!"
""
""
""
"Underwhelmed, will revisit after one sits for about 3-4 months. Kind of expected a bit more."
"Overall: I think this is an excellent example of an American BW. And a good candidate for aging (glad that I have several more bottles in my cellar :)"
"overall, looking like 4s across the board here and that feels about right for this one. an above average, enjoyable barleywine that just doesn't quite do enough for me to get into that upper tier. that said, definitely worth a try."
""
"O: Sort of a boring barleywine, not bad but not a stand-out."
""
""
"Overall, a very nice American Barleywine. And from Utah!!! Go figure."
"Very good barleywine. Great mix of flavors that hides the alcohol nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: not bad but not my idea of a successful American Barleywine."
"Of note, MF is a bit watery- certainly not what I would expect in a barley wine. Definitely liked last year's version better, but looking forward to doing a vertical when I get 4 year's worth."
""
"Of course, that was because of how strong the alcoholic content of this was. This faintly reminded me of a Belgian Dubbel or Tripel and fans of those styles, as well as Barleywines, will not be disappointed here. The body is certainly here and even though this didn't go down quickly, there's enough flavor and carbonation to keep this from being too heavy. I'd love to buy a few more and see how it ages."
""
"Overall, this is quite good and I have found myself pleasantly surprised with Uinta in general."
"buy this beer. or steal me some."
""
""
"OVERALL: Strong example of the style, but it probably could use a little more malty sweetness to provide a touch greater balance. This has to be one of Utah's finest beers."
"Cheers!"
"O - This is an excellent example of the American Barleywine style. At 4 months old, it is well balanced and drinking perfectly to my taste. This is definitely a good, relatively cheap, option from an up and coming brewery that has impressed me of late."
""
"Overall: Solid barleywine. Will hold on to more of these in the future for aging. Very well balanced and the tropical flavors stand out the most. Happy to have opened it, but sad I could have held on to it for longer. Not disappointed one bit right now."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I would like to have a few bottles of this with some age on them to see how it mellows in the bitterness category. I'd also like a touch more sweetness to make this a true sipper taste wise. Still a very good beer, even when fresh."
""
""
"A decent beer, but nothing memorable."
""
""
""
"O: super impressed - had strong grain and wood character; I liked that it avoided the sweetness I find in a lot of other barleywines - it helped set this beer apart - it had a barrel-aged IPA-ishness to it; bet this beer would go great with a cigar"
""
"O- A pretty malt heavy barelywine. I understand that much of the aroma and some of the flavor hops have faded by now, but still should have more hop presence. Not a bad drink, perhaps I just tried it while it was beginning its transition to a elegant Aged Barelywine of sorts. Suggest waiting a few more months if you still have this brew."
"O: A solid barley-wine all around, nice nose and strong flavor, needs a little aging to smooth it out, though"
"O: i generally enjoy barleywines and this one was ok but there was just something lingering in the taste that was off putting and stood out a bit too much to me, it wasnt the alcohol so im really just not sure what it was"
"Liked this beer. Not great, but I really enjoyed it."
"O: Good Barley Wine, better than what I remember, but the last one was fresher so maybe it gets better with age"
""
""
""
""
"I get this sense this needs some age to let some sweetness roll forward and kill/subdue the hop presence. I would hope that with more time some more classic flavors would come out (fruit, caramel, etc..), otherwise I think this could get better and this isn't at prime. My 2 cents."
""
""
""
"O: One of fav. barleywines. Always what I expect it to be, and well priced which makes it tough to beat."
""
""
"O: a great barleywine, nice and hoppy, everything balances well to hide the alcohol level and makes it a nice and easy drinking brew."
""
""
"PS I love this brewery though. They are all about the wind power, unique styles, and cool label art work. Other than hop notch and dube, it seems like most of their 12oz bottles are sub-par. Id love to tackle one of their bombers though..."
"A comfortable beer, this satisfies without occupying the spotlight and will work on a sunny winter day."
""
"The flavor is maybe a little plain for a barleywine, but really no complaints, this is a great option for the price especially."
"O - This has a good drinkability. It is a little bit of a sipper, but it has nice flavor and goes down good. The alcohol content is present, but hidden pretty well overall. I think this is a good beer and a nice example of the style. I recommend checking this one out. I would buy it again."
""
""
""
"A good, plumy and bitter barleywine. Something is lacking...not quite sure what."
"Too much hops!"
"O: This is stronger and more flavorful than most barleywines."
"O - an average barleywine"
"I am liking a lot of stuff from Uinta, thanks guys for a great brew"
""
"Taste is fairly straight forward with a very heavy caramel malt front, alcohol is quite present even with more than a year of age on it and warms the belly, hint of citrus in the aftertaste which seems odd but at least spices things up a bit from the typical malt coverage, soft carbonation gives a decent creaminess."
"Bottled in February 2010. Dark brown in color and murky. Poured with a thick beige foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap that left random sticky lacings on the glass. Toffee and caramel malt aromas are prominent. The hoppy aromas that others have noted have likely faded with this being nearly 2 years old. There is a hint of hop spiciness toward the end that accompanies the boozy aroma as this warms. Very smooth feel with lazy rich carbonation. Tangy citrus and ripe fruit flavors up front that slowly grows thru the middle. The strong toffee and caramel malt backbone is difficult to suppress throughout. Finishes fairly dry with a lingering sweet toffee flavor accompanied by a tangy hop bitterness."
"I've had this in the celler for about about 6 months, letting it age. Maybe I waited too long. Pours an amber color, nothing special, but now awful. I'm getting a citrusy hop smell, again, not blowing my mind. Damn though, this is nice and smooth. Not harsh at all, but a solid liquory aftertaste. I was holding this for the Packers Super Bowl win...well that didn't happen, so I'm not overly disappointed, but not as good as I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A pretty good example of a barley wine. At this price point, it's hard to pass up. I will revisit this one."
""
""
""
"O: Very, very nice barleywine. On the drier and more bitter end of the scale. Alcohol is a little noticeable at the end, but cellaring may smooth this out a bit. Wish I had bought more than one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I dont find it to be anything super groundbreaking but I would definitely go out and buy this one again. I got it as single 12oz bottle from tru beer in easthampton MA but I just might go back later this week and grab a sixpack."
""
"overall it's a nice and enjoyable barley wine well with the price on it."
""
"Overall mixed, the nose is great, and the flavors would be great of they weren't drowned out by the crazy bitter astringent hops."
"O - Very nice barely wine. Let it sit a bit longer, it even taste better. Great everyday beer."
"-i remember liking this more the 1st time i had it. there is more bitter hop flavor than i would like. there seem to be some nice things going on behind the burn taste up front. i just wish it was more in the foreground"
""
""
"Bottled 11/23/2010"
""
"Overall, its not bad. The toasty/burnt thing is a little off-putting, but the beer tastes ok otherwise. I probably won't pursue it again however."
"O --- Excellent! I will add this to my Top 10 Barleywine Beers to get every year. Uinta Beers have just started to hit the greater Sacramento area and they are very good. I look forward to enjoying more."
"Overall: Weird smell, body is disjointed and not much fullness. While not an inherently bad beer, it's somewhat of a fail as a barleywine."
"This is a full bodied brew leaning towards medium in the feel. It displays a light level of carbonation. Warming alcohol gets a bit distracting as it warns. A light resinous pine-like hop presence keeps me interested but overall this one just didn't totally come together for me."
""
""
""
"T: as a barleywine it's relatively simple in flavor profile; very boozy, something like drinking a whiskey and beer (is that such a bad idea from time to time?); if aged, it would probably open up and develop some complexity in its fruited profile; I think I'll try it; see you in a couple of years"
""
""
"version XVII, pours a hazy brass color with a thin white head into a wine glass. smells instantly of booze, which isnt surprising given the abv. also smells of straw and a peculiar maltiness. Flavor matches the nose, and the bright carbonation fizzes the flavors into a very unique palate. cant say this is my favority barleywine, but it is different. mouthfeel was as heavy as it gets, thick and weighty, even the carbonation doesnt make it feel any lighter. a good beer on a cold night"
"Dr: Not very drinkable on account of the high ABV, but the ABV is well concealed by the flavours to an extent. The mouthfeel is too thick for it to be really drinkable. It's really nothing special."
"O: Good beer, tastes and smells great. Wish I had let it age for longer, this one is barely over six months old."
"o - Overall this is a good, strong barleywine. The nose is really nice, the taste is just pretty strong alcohol-wise. I think if I had another bottle of this I'd sit on it for 6-12 months and try it again, as I feel it could get even better. Would have it again."
"overall, i like it and its one of the better deals out there. not the best barleywine, and it doesn't do anything different, but it works pretty well."
"O: An excellent beer, with flawless balance in my opinion. Rich and full of flavor, yet remarkably drinkable for it's size. If the opportunity presented it's self to get some more of this, I'd certainly jump on it."
"Obviously, this is worth cellaring. That would cut down the raw bitterness a bit, which is just about the only unpleasant character here. Even still, it's an impressive, flavoursome and well-integrated barleywine. I'd love to try this vintage again in a couple of years."
"Great smooth mouthfeel as she goes down. Slight sweetness makes it not quite perfectly balanced but the taste lingers on the palate with a nice hop character sticking around. Good brew. Happy 17th!!!"
"D - Probably not as good as it was fresh, it just seems to be a bit off, oxidized i guess. I'd love to try one of the newer versions"
"O - It's a must buy every year, I drink one and sit on three for the rest of the year... Ages super well. Great B-wine!"
"O-Up there with North Coast Old Stock as a high quality, low price barley wine that is sure to improve with age."
"Overall: a good barleywine in my opinion. Picked up a a 4 pack at total wine in Riveredge, NJ for $7.99 and worth even more. I am going to get more soon, no doubt."
"O- This beer is decent, enjoyable, nothing special or worth revisiting but still tasty, well balanced, alcohol is hidden for being 10.4%."
"Aroma of caramel malt and some brown sugar. Rather lacking in hops for such a young barleywine, with some earthy/chocolate hops coming out with a bit of warming. Flavor follows suit with caramel, some raisin and light brown sugar notes as well as a light touch of roast. This doesn't come across as overly sweet yet manages to mask the alcohol fairly well. It is evident on the nose but less so on the tongue. Finish is fairly full bodied but rather nondescript in its delivery. Overall an enjoyable pour but a bit lacking in complexity for the style. Age may help but I'm not keeping my fingers crossed and in fact this beer warms to offer a slightly oxidized hop aroma. Still worth a visit."
"Overall- I was very impressed. I really liked the hoppy flavor. Getting harder and harder to find a nice hoppy barleywine. Cheers"
"A good barleywine, though I wish the citrus hops I smelled in the aroma translated through to the flavor."
"Overall (3.5): Good but not great. Might not age well with the strong hop character. The 10% is disguised well."
"Nice sticky chewy mouthfeel."
"O - I just started laughing when I first tasted this beer, not because it was bad, but because it was so different. Granted it was my first barley wine. But it was a sipper, for sure. It was nice. I see myself daring a buddy to chug a glass for 10$. Something that would be worth 10$, but he wouldn't get to enjoy the beer itself. Bummer! This sucker's a beast! I couldn't and wouldn't drink more than one at a time. Two in one night would be death! Very different from others. Looking forward to trying different barley wines in the near future. In fact, I think I'm going to pick a couple next week, when I get back in town."
"Quite a solid barleywine."
"Overall - Overall, there's not much that I don't like about this beer. The taste doesn't quite live up to the nose, but it's still enjoyable. As I mentioned, not quite my favorite barleywine (Bigfoot currently holds that distinction), but it is good and has reminded me how much I enjoy sipping on a nice barleywine over a lengthy period of time. Good slow sipper. Probably even better in the colder months. Can't wait to have one of these once the weather cools down again."
"Medium body and a very light carbonation."
"Nice bronze color. Ok aroma-somewhat of a malty, raisen like aroma though fairly muted. Decent flavor-quite the hop bite going on. Has a fairly dominant smokiness that I simply do not care for here. Malty backbone. Good body for the style. Finishes rather dry in the end. A notch above average as far as US barleywines go for me."
"O - this is one of the best barleywines I have ever had, definately in my top 3 barleywines! Very complex and powerful, thoroughly enjoyed this one!"
"Pours a semi-clear dark copper-amber color with a 1 inch khaki head that fades to a thin cap. Thick foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel/toffee, brown sugar, and citrus zest hops. Taste is of toasty malt, caramelized brown sugar, and citrus zest. There is a mild hop bitterness on the tongue after each sip and a slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a creamy and slightly thick mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barleywine with a big hop flavor and my first beer from Uinta."
"Overall, pretty tasty. Glad the alcohol didn't burn the throat as much as the nostrils."
"Final thought - at $3 a pop and 10%+ ABV ( you can't even tell it's 10+), this beer is for all lovers of beer"
"Dark reddish brown and a little bit murky with a dense yellow/beige cap. Decent head retention with lots of fine lacing -- sheets towards the top of the glass and spottier as the beer disappeared. Tons of caramel in the aroma, grainy, malty and sweet, mild alcohol with a hint of fruit and toffee. The flavour threw me off initially, since it was very different than the aroma. Much fruitier up front, sort of a raisin sweetness throughout, but still with caramel and toffee. Bitterness wasn't prominent, always present but nicely balanced. Alcohol was well controlled. Decent texture, malty and full bodied with lowish carbonation, some dryness. Overall, it was enjoyable."
"O: I had hopes from the aroma, but this is not one of the better examples of the style, IMO. Honestly, might dump the second half of this if I had a better option on hand and the burnt flavors hadn't killed my tastebuds."
"I do enjoy the intensity of the hops here, it would be a dilemma for me to age it. I'm perfectly content with drinking it after the 4 months after the bottling date."
"O - Not a beer I ever care to have again. I didn't like the taste or the smell, and it's really hard to like a beer if you don't like those two things."
"Overall, another very well done beer from Uinta. The complexity of the the flavors is great, and I think this may actually rival Big Foot in terms of hoppiness. I will surely be laying a couple of these down to see how the flavors progress."
"Overall a fairly intense barleywine. The hops really never let go of your tastebuds which makes it harder to taste the sweet malts. My tongue is slightly numb as I type this, and that's after only 1/4 of the bottle."
"O- From a Brewery I have never heard of, on a great night like this, even after following up one of my new favorite Barleywines the Lagunitas gnarleywine, this really stays memorable. Its good almost great. worth picking up!"
"D-this has a very interesting balance with a huge hop presence in the nosse and still a fairly strong presence in the taste. a little sugary and the body leaves a bit to be desired but not bad."
"""The perfect ale to celebrate any occasion."" Which should I celebrate it to? I can think of several events going on in my life that I could raise my glass to. Just thought of it; how about ending two sentences in this paragraph with a preposition?"
"D/O: This big barleywine is full-flavored with malt and bitterness featured, but it threatens to fatigue the palate more than one would hope for in a beer of the style. Acidity distracts, getting in the way of what might otherwise be a pleasant, slow-sipping experience."
"Drank on 4-17-09. This brew poured out as a brown color with some light orange highlights. The head didn't really stick around too long here. The smell of the beer has is typical barley and malt aromas and possibly some subtle fig on the nose. The taste of the beer has a light sweetness to it. The mouthfeel was medium. Overall I wasn't getting too much from this that made it so special. It's a decent barley wine at best in my opinion."
"O: This was a pretty solid barleywine. Really easy to drink and a solid flavor profile."
"Oh yea... This was the 17th anniversary."
"I found this beer to be solid, one i'd buy a few of but not go crazy with."
"An anniversary barleywine that is available year round - kind of odd. As is the fact that I bought this almost two years ago in Utah and just recently saw the same vintage available at a store here in Boston. Anyway, from a 12 oz. stubby, bottled 04/09/09, 72 IBUs. Pours a chill-hazed crimson, with low carbonation and topped with a thin tan cap that retains a thin collar and doesn't manage to lace the glass. Smells richly malty and caramelly, with coffee, roast, milk chocolate, floral alcohol and very heady, citric, oily and resinous hops. Still tastes quite hoppy at two years old, with the same hop profile that gives an almost harsh bitterness. Lots of melanoidins and crystal malts contribute a robust malty base and a bit of sweetness. The yeast is earthy and fruity, and there is a light booziness as well that helps lead into a warming, bitter finish. Medium to full on the palate, moderately-carbonated, with a tongue-scraping bitterness and powdery yeast feel. Not terribly complex, but it is smooth, delicious, well-integrated, and it has aged quite well so far. I would like to try this one at five years old to see how it's going."
"Overall: Not a barley wine that I'd go back to, but I can understand how others might dig this. Pretty mild in terms of aroma and flavor strength, though it offers up a good deal of complexity in each arena. Worth a try, I suppose."
"O - I had the XIV a few years a go and I remember liking it more than this vintage but overall this is a good beer worth trying if you see it"
"Forget any state-associated beer-handicap, this is a rock solid barleywine, and it keeps getting better with age."
"Pours a very deep amber, with almost no head and minimal lacing. Carmel, chocolate, some fresh sweet red fruit, and a little grassy, woody earthiness. Interesting stuff. Taste is initially a liquid caramel, but is quickly taken over by a lingering, slightly overpowering bitterness. The hops do not appear to be well integrated. A decent level of carbonation gives this medium-bodied ale a nice bite. Overall, the aromas were good but it's hard to get paste the sub-par flavors. I'm holding out hope that this will mellow out with some more time."
"Bottled 4/9/09. Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark reddish brown with a slightly dirty white head. Head didn't last long, clung reasonably well, and was replenished by a small stream of bubbles from the bottom. Aroma was typical barleywine. A touch of evident alcohol, with a fair amount of grainy sweet. Too sweet for me. Trace of something that reminded me of banana and cloves. Taste had some hops, and also a tad of bitterness. Mellowed out some over time, but not typical barleywine flavors. Felt good in the mouth. Coated well and was nicely carbonated. Overall a middle of the road barleywine. Not bad, but nothing outstanding."
"Overall:a Very nice, slightly above average darley wine with a balanced tone and a very unreadable ABV, does not taste ""hot"" or even imply the 10.4% that it is!"
"A very nice beer. I think I paid $10 for the four pack so for a barleywine of this quality, also a great value. Gonna lay two of them down for a while."
"Overall- pretty good, very drinkable, alcohol is not even noticeable, just wish for a bit more complexity in the flavor, and wish I was sipping it by a fireplace on a cold night, but a warm spring night in central Cali will do"
"Notes: The main range is there, and If this is actually a year old since bottling already... Maybe a couple of years in the cellar with soothe things out, and the initial sense is that it might be quite something else after that."
"Notes: ABV 10.4%, SRM 20, IBU 72"
"O: This isn't even a month old, super super young, it needs time to coalesce. Buy now, drink later."
"O: Decent stuff, but I wouldn't dedicate an anniversary to it."
"Drink- I can't wait to crack my Cockeyed cooper now that I have had this brew. I read the BA mag article about Uinta and wanted to try there beers. Great brews, will return to this one."
"Will be reviewing again after I age the other bottle for longer."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and silky smooth, with a medium body and a medium alcohol and caramel feel. Very high drinkability considering the strength and style, this is a one and done per night yet still a very good and very tasty beer."
"When I'm in the mood for a barley wine, this one is always an excellent choice."
"I just got a 4 pack of this guy. What a steal. I'm putting two of these back and probably getting more to put back for a while. It's a well balanced beer. The sugars are dead on. The additional flavors are a bit of a miss. It's nothing too strong. I'm hoping age might help this guy out a bit."
"Drinkability was excellent. One of the easiest drinking barleywines I've had the pleasure of drinking. Nothing too extraordinary about this beer, just a fine example of the style, nice and clean tasting. Excited to see what acouple years of aging does to this beer."
"D: For what this is, this is a very easy drinking, delicious barley wine--nice work, Uinta!"
"Alcohol is well-masked and the feel isn't overly heavy, but the relative sweetness and aggressively bitter finish kept me sippin' slowly. Unsurprisingly, most elements of this beer improved as it warmed up a bit."
"This beer is a ruby-brown color, very clear, with a small tan head. The smell is classic Eastern barleywine...lots of malt... it smells like a malt-extract infused brew. Lots of boozy, alcohol and grain scents...it's got a lot of melanoid-enhanced scents. The taste is similar, with loads of sweet malt. Alcohol warming is notable, but it isn't overbearing. Full body. This is a very good barleywine."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. For an American barleywine, it checks all the boxes it should. It delivers a heavy hand of sweet malt, but is balanced by resin hops. The interplay provides complexity and depth."
"That being said. I do like it for a beer to have here and there."
"Drinkability is very good for this strong a beer."
"D: A Very pleasant surprise. This is an underrated sipper that deserves more attention."
"D: Complex nose and taste. ABV is a bit daunting."
"I like this, but in a dirty way if that makes any sense. It's reminding me of the love I had for cheap booze when I was underage. Naughty, but tasty."
"Drinkability: I'm surprised what a great barleywine this is. I sort of got it at an in-between time in its life at 9 months old. I'd love to try a really fresh one and one with a year or two on it. Pretty good value too."
"Drinkability - Fairly drinkable for a barley wine. The abv is tolerable for good sitting. Complex taste, but was expecting something a little more. Still, not a bad brew."
"When I saw the label I was stunned to see a beer from the Land of Mormon with a 10.4% ABV, but here it is! Overall a really nice barleywine that has great balance."
"Overall, average barlywine. Somewhat drinkable. Nothing out of the ordinary."
"Mouthfeel is thick but smooth with little carbonation. Overall, I think the 16 months that this beer has been sitting in the bottle has only helped it out. A nice well-rounded flavor profile without the alcohol being to hot."
"D- Excellent! The alcohol is well-masked. This beer is best enjoyed slowly, but it is very enjoyable for a high-alcohol, high- flavor beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a dark brown nearly opaque with a lightly tan head. Smells slightly smoky with a malty nose and some faint citrus smell. Taste is malty caramel with some coffee flavor. Feel is full and smooth with a brief crispness towards the end. Overall a very enjoyable barleywine and one I will look for at the store next time."
"I think this is an English Barleywine instead of an American. The malt aggressiveness fits the version from across the atlantic."
"D: Alcohol has completely gone into hiding, none on the nose and none on the palate. The beer is quite sugary so it lends itself to be enjoyed slowly. Drinking very well with age, could only imagine how bitter it would be fresh!"
"Damn, this beer is bitter ... lovely, but bitter. Hopheads should rally to this beer. Cellaring should not even be a factor here as it is so delicious in its fresh form. Love the hops now."
"Overall - An excellent US barleywine... it could maybe do with a few months aging but it's certainly recommended..."
"D: one is all i want, would not get this one again this is not to hot."
"A very nice beer and one I would like to put an additional few years on."
"This is the XVI, obtained in an Ogden State store while visiting here in August. It's a very pretty beer; deep amber covered with a thick head. The smell is wonderful, rich and malty with some caramel notes. There are slight hints of sweetness that may overwhelm. The first taste is excellent, well balanced and not too heavy. The conditioning is very good. Just a bit of alcohol in the lingering finish. No cloying flavors at all. This seems more drinakable than most barleywines but I'd've liked a better balanced finish."
"drinkability: smooth beer. This is close to on par with a 1 year bigfoot. nice beer!"
"Drinkability is fairly good; the style isn't exactly known for massive drinkability. But the mouthfeel - as well as the raw brashness of the hops - limit the drinkability a bit. Doesn't approach the best of the style."
"The beer is a sipper with some heat coming through on the finish. The body thinness helps with the drinkability, but I think this beer could age nicely and would be a malt lovers dream in 2 years."
"Complex and balanced, I'm curious to try newer (and older) versions of this bad boy. My first bottle three days ago seemed okay; second bottle yesterday impressed a bit more; today's tasting showed me the light. A classic case of a ""grower"" beer. Big beer lovers, seek it out."
"Drinks: like an acquired taste. If you like your barleywines to be a little more malt-leaning, Uinta Anniversary is the beer for you."
"Beer poured a deep burgundy with a decent tan head initially. Nose is carmelly sweetness, northwest hops, and raisins. Taste starts with a big blast of caramel sweet malts, hints of raisins and wood in the middle, with a subtle hop finish. Mouthfeel is awesome, full bodied, good carbonation, and extremely smooth across the palate. Overall drinkability is good,abv level was warming on the initial sip, makes for a nice sipping brew on a 110 degree day!"
"Cheers!!"
"Notes: FFO of big American Imperial Barleywine ales (i.e. Stonge Old Guardian, etc) or American old stock ales. Like it a lot, fairly affordable, but not my absolute favorite. The year has probably done it a lot of good is my guess having never had it fresh though."
"A real pleaser, especially for a SLC local."
"Aroma is nice, but I wish it was a bit more intense. Flavor is a bit stronger but not anything overly special. It is a solid beer, and I'm glad I got to try it, but not necessarily anything I'd track down again."
"D - Not that drinkabe which is normal for a barleywine I guess. Thicker than a typical barleywine. It's also more chocolatey which makes it a bit more filling. Pretty great offering overall!"
"I'm not sure about this beer. It tastes very strange to me. Very strong, malty aroma is a bit overpowering, flavor is strong and syrupy. It was good to try because i've always heard about this brewery but in general this is not my favorite beer. Dark red in color, light carbonation, strong flavor and aroma. Good for a try but I won't get it agin."
"Pours a deep, dark brown color, almost black, with a finger and a half of cappuccino colored foam. Aromas of dried apricots, raisins, tobacco and leather. On the palate, the hops really kick in, bringing some good citrus to balance out the caramel malt. A very good beer, even better considering it's less than $8/4 pack."
"D- Couldn't have many of them, but considering the style, it's about what it should be."
"D: A sipper for sure. Not the easiest to drink multiples of, but I do enjoy trying new beers."
"Copper colored ale with a slight cream colored foamy head and nice lacing on the glass. Syrupy aroma with some sugar cane whiffs and bourbon. The taste is very hoppy with the bourbon coming through on the swallow and a slight burn on the way down. No sweetness at all on this. I was waiting for a sweetness kick but it never came. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste. At 10.6% this went down very smoothly. I had no idea who this brewery was before I tried this at a BW festival, but after trying, I am a big fan. Great stuff."
"Bottled 8/29/2008, consumed during the 2008 holidays that December and my review was mislocated until just now."
"D - Hmm, I find a lot of ironies in this beer while doing the review. From a pure technical standpoint, I find this to not stand up particularly well to the finest examples of the style, but at the same time it is very enjoyable. I think it is it's ease of drinking that makes the difference. The richness and total sipper qualities of the best barleywines are so far from this, they don't even seem to be the same style. This is quite an easy drinker due to its excellent balance. In short, I think I like this beer much more than the review might indicate."
"Drinkability: so-so at best. There are better American versions on the market."
"All in all, this was a decent brew. This would definitely fall on the American side of barleywines. Good to try if you like American bwines, otherwise, if you're not a hop guy, then don't bother with this one."
"Overall, an outstanding representation of the style. Not too rich and an enjoyment to drink."
"Great mouthfeel, its enjoyable, not uber bitter, maintains perfect balance throughout, great price for this beer, and very drinkable, especially for the style and ABV."
"Impression: My first Uinta brew, and if this is their modus operandi I will be on the lookout for more!"
"The taste was much more mellow then my nose lead me to assume. There is a cocoa malt sweetness upfront with roasted malt and a kind of pretzel like bready quality. A very noticable piney hops presence shows up toward the finish and remains. The alcohol is definitely there, trademark of the style but it is surprizing subtle. Overall, a delicious well balanced barley wine."
"The mouthfeel is where this beer shines above all of its other aspects. Wonderfully thick and coats the mouth with oils like a DIPA, but it is a little undercarbonated. The drinkability is on par with the flavor."
"Served in a 8oz glass. Clear deep auburn colored beer. Aroma nice, bit a touch soapy. Lots of rum and raisin and etoh, sweet caramel in smell. Sweet boozy beer. Dark fruits, dates, burnt sugars, etoh warm all way through. Carbonation minimal, medium body. Rum lingers in finish and aftertaste."
"Pours a deep amber color with a light tan head that clings tightly to my snifter. The aroma is of citrus and pine, but combined with the big alcohol esters, registers a bit chemical - it kind of reminds me of pine-sol cleaning solution. The taste is balanced, but not in a smooth way. The caramel and roasted notes do not mesh well with the citrus hop flavors, and the alcohol presence is a bit sharp. Overall, while I like their idea of a big, west coast barley wine, this one came off a bit chaotic. I would definitely recommend sitting on this one for atleast a year."
"D-For a 10% ABV brew the alcohol is very well concealed. Rather sharp and biting, certainly hop forward. A very tasty brew that is, without question, one of the best beers I have had from Utah and I have been there!"
"12oz dark brown bottle."
"I assume that it's because this brewery is located in Utah that I've never heard of it (I live in New England). This beer definitely makes me want to sample their other offerings, because it's very adventurous for its style."
"."
"D- high drinkability despite having a fair amount of alcohol,"
"Pours dark amber with offwhite head that retains reasonably well to a thin laced rimjob. Nose is fresh with some pine and brown sugary baked goods. Palate has the same elements with piney hops, caramel & brown sugar sweetness, and a little alcohol warmth on the finish. More easy drinking than many barleywines. I'll have to get this one on draft when I'm in Utah next time."
"Drinkability: A very complex beer that I'd love to try again. Seek it out if you can."
"Drinkability: My first barleywine, and overall this is a good one. Is a sipper for sure, but is very enjoyable."
"Pours a deep dark red with a thinnish off white head that dissipates quickly to a cap. Smell is initially hops with some citrus wafting its way into my nose. The hops fade quickly to reveal more layers of malt. Brown sugar, prunes and dried cherries, and a bit of caramel. There's a touch of alcohol in the nose, but its quite restrained. The taste is caramel and burnt sugars. A little pine, and some alcohol. There is more alcohol in the taste than the aroma led me to believe. Long lingering hop bitterness and alcohol burn in the finish. Mouthfeel is a mix of syrupy water, body is a bit thinner than I would have liked, carbonation is low. Decent barleywine, might be better with a bit of age to tone the alcohol down a bit."
"D - this stage in it's life it's too hot and overly bitter. this one will only improve with time I am sure of it."
"Poured dark amber/red with a thin white head, into a 4oz sampling glass. The smell yielded maltiness, raisin, pineapple, and a searing sweetness. The taste also was very syrupy sweet, with an alcohol burn evident in the finish, and I couldn't help but wonder how more aging would help smooth out the harshness of this beer. Maybe I'll try reviewing again in a few years if I can get my hands on some more of this vintage. The mouthfeel, while syrupy at times, was nicely thick for a barleywine. Drinkability? Again, I think that this beer would benefit from more aging."
"Glad my computer battery died mid-review last time around, here is the condensed version. Pours a very dark crimson brown with a one finger head (into a snifter) and leaves light creamy lacing behind. The retains decently and dies down to a ring around the side with clouds atop the beer. Smells initially like a double IPA hop bomb but soon becomes a nice mix of malts, hops and alcohol. Tastes of malts, piney hops, a bit of alcohol, dark fruits and nutty flavors. The balance is mostly good but seems to go towards malts and then back to huge hops at the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent creaminess to it. The carbonation is a tiny bit too much here for the flavors and style. The warming is really not overwhelming at all and adds a nice feel. A huge bittersweet flavor is left on the tongue for a long time after drinking this one. Drinkability is good. The taste is good, the price is decent, the alcohol and hops seem to take over this one as time goes on as I long for the balance the beer had midway through drinking it. This is one of the better barley wines I have had, but I still need to explore this style a lot, lot more."
"Not quite firm, but creamy enough mouthfeel. A little hot in the finish, but I'm impressed overall by the masking job, and the brew in general. Solid effort."
"Comments- I tried this on draught at the ACBF in June and although the samples were small, I had a bunch of them because I liked them so much. The hit-you-over-the-head alcohol finish was, to my memory, not evident at that time. I was excited to find this in bottles recently, but what a letdown."
"D) A well crafted barley, not too over the top and not too blah. Slow sipper, but I'd pour another."
"D: Definitely a good candidate for the cellar. At this young age, if feels a little rough around the edges. I feel letting it mature for awhile would bring out its full potential. A solid pickup overall."
"D- Nice full barleywine flavor but just a little boozy. This will probably do quite well with some age."
"Overall - I have to say that I am impressed. Very easy drinking, regardless of the high ABV, plenty of nice fruit flavors along with a decent kick from the hops. My sinuses are tingling and my stomach is warm, a great Barley Wine from Utah!"
"Aroma is strong and rather fruity with a firm alcohol ting, the sort I expect from a barleywine. It pours a translucent dark mahogany, almost a cola brown, with a fairly thick if none too persistent pale cream-tan head. Flavor is more hoppy than malty, almost like an IPA, with a fairly strong and ragged alcohol bite. Texture is rough and rowdy and tingles all the way down."
"Wowee, my first barleywine - quite an experience! Pours an amber color with virtually no head - what little there is quickly fades to the thinnest of crowns. Smell is quite strong - kind of fruity and spicy. There's literally a feel of stinging on the nostrils. Taste is similar - fruity taste, with something else - nuts, figs, raisins? Maltiness at first taste, but definite hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Alcohol is very noticeable - warming sensation after sipping. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonated. Not very drinkable, but I believe that's to be expected of this style - definitely made for sipping."
"Overall I thought the nose and flavors were cleaner while the beer was on the colder side, which in my experience is a rarity for a big barleywine. I say try it while it's cold (~50 deg F) but even if it's warmer it's worth a shot."
"The drink is silky-smooth and fullish in body with just enough carbonation to cut the sweet stickiness near-perfectly. A definite sipper I'd like to see with a little age on it."
"I'm not a big fan of Barleywine, but this was a good one."
"XVI bottled 04/09/09, consumed 07/01/10: good beer, much the same as my previous review, some scores would be lower for this particular bottle, but I won't deduct from my first"
"Poured a deep reddish amber with good carbonation and a tannish head. Nose is caramel, brown sugar, hop bitterness. Taste is caramel upfront with some sugar and hop bitterness coming on at the end. Malt body is good but good have bee a bit more. ABV is well hidden. Tasty for sure. Good bwine."
"A very enjoyable American barleywine, just what I expected given the style. Perhaps not a standout, but certainly very solid."
"Notes: Uinta is new to me, and I'm definitely interested in trying more of their offerings. Thanks Wasatch."
"Bottle- Courtesy of Irishboy. This is the XIV edition. Deep mahogany pour unleashes a large tan head leaving frothy lace. The nose is huge on this BW.Lots of musty wood, nuts, prune, brown sugar, pine, lemon, butterscotch. Tastes of sweet brown sugar, prunes, caramel, some smoked meat, pine and citrus, with sweet nuts and a hope bite. Oily, syrupy, and intense finish. Lingers and lingers. A solid sipper. Thanks for the bottle Richard! A pleasure as always"
"M&D: this barley wine is even more outstanding than Sierra Nevada ""Bigfoot"" tasted two days ago, thanks to its more balanced profile b/w a dark(-er) malt composition and (equally beautiful) hops, as well as a finesse texture on top of a really attenuated body for 10.4%abv. - seriously I still can't feel the impact of alc. even way past the last drop! Granted, this delicious barley wine is pronounced on hops, as the term ""American Barley Wine"" should guarantee, but an overall, supreme balance is the key to keep me in awe. If I see this ale - a different vintage of course - again at the BSF bar this year, I'll try to secure 2 bottles!"
"Thanks to Wasatch for spreading the love with this exceptional brew. Pours dark brown with cherry red hues which make for spaces which are barely penetrable by the light. A slight dark tan head fades fairly quickly into a good thick stripe all along the top of the brew. A big sweet aroma initially rises to the nose, and I like it a lot. Following that are some sour dark fruits, grain, black licorice and some sweet yeast. The taste involves a big hop bitterness with sweet and sour cherries and a good sweet breadiness mixed in between it all. Now this is what I'm talkin' about. A thin layer of chocolate is also discernible. A slightly piercing but very welcome alcohol heat exists, but that's to be expected, as this is a big one. Body is medium to heavy, a little creamy up front, and a little dry going down. Beers like this are just one of the reasons trading is so worth the effort and expense."
"Drinkability: A wondrous beer. Sipping on this through the evening as I read a good book reminds me of what I like so much about quality beer."
"A superb beer that is worth seeking out. A complete surprise when compared to the other Uinta offerings."
"D- Very drinkable for a 10% barleywine but it's a sipper for sure. I enjoyed what this had to offer and would purchase again, thinking about aging one or two."
"Overall: The mouth feel is rich, astringent, and a subtle creaminess. The body of the beer is medium full and the finish is medium. This is a very nice rich well made barleywine. I would like to have seen more strenght in this barleywine would have put it through the roof. I have enjoyed it very much."
"Careful with this one as the alcohol is very well hidden, and slowly becoming more obvious as the beer warms. Complex with good flavors, and not too overpowering. Recommended."
"D - A tasty Barleywine for sure, glad I grabbed this - one of the few styles I like to cellar. I would have let it age, but I couldn't hold out 6 months. The bottle on 2/20/09 is surprising since it has so much hop flavor and is very fresh and vibrant. The American style is right on but my notes indicate 9.8% instead of the 10.4% listed here. This ranks up with some of the best West coast barleywines."
"This is a barleywine in the body of a quenching IPA. It is one beer that I'd love to have a running vertical of stashed away in the cellar. Who would of thought you could go to Utah for one of America's most enjoyable barleywines? In recent years palates have become more difficult, more demanding and Uinta deserves full credit for continuously keeping up with the challenge over the last (15 now) years."

"Drinkability: This one is not a bad beer, but I have had way more complex in the style. It struck me as a bit on the hoppy side. I think one is enough for me."
"This poured a clear dark mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like copper hops and caramel malt, with some light orange and honey and biscuit. It tasted like bold copper hops with some roasted barley malt, and a bit of sweet caramel and alcohol. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter metallic aftertaste. Overall this was good but not outstanding, reminding me somewhat of a fresh Bigfoot. It smelled better than it tasted, and the flavor could have been a bit cleaner too. But other than that, it had great body and was easy to drink, hiding the alcohol pretty well. Perhaps some age would help sweeten the flavor to match the scent, which would make this a solid barleywine."
"12 oz. Solid dark amber/mohoganny pour. Nice off white head, a descent amount of lacing. Fruity caramel aromas, some pine and citrus. Tastes was much more pine up front, at first anyway. Almost IPA-ish. Malty, caramel covered red fruits followed. Hops balance nicely without being overly bitter. The sweetness lingered with the hops through the finish. Prefer an English style, but as this warmed it was a pleasant suprise barleywine. Really improved for me as it warmed. Would recommend, was not too pricey either."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear burgundy color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of piney hops with some sweet malt. Taste is a very well balanced mix between some piney and somewhat citrus hops and a sweet malt base that is not overly sweet. Body is full with good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Very well done with great balance and very good drinkability factor."
"D - have started to pick up on the alcohol about mid glass, however its more in the chest than hot in the mouth, its the only beer from this brewery I can get my hands on and I am not complaining"
"D - While this reminds me a bit of Troegs Flying Mouflan (especially the hop profile), it is a bit heavy-handed with the alcohol content. You can definitely detect the 10.4% ABV in this brew. Still, it is a quite tasty and drinkable barleywine."
"10.4% ABV? This one is way too smooth and easy drinking for that. Good beer."
"this brew pours up a clear dark reddish amber color with a quickly fading off white head. great lacing. the nose is floral and citrus hops, low key sugary malts, uh-verrry nice! the taste is very nice floral and smooth subtle citrus hops (the hops are dominating the scene), sweet malts, caramel, red apple, medium bodied, low carbo, sweet finish. This would age beautifully!"
"Overall, I didn't really care for the flavors in this - it's too alcoholic and muddled."
"decent barleywine taste, big malty base with a big hopyy bitterness, alcohol is a bit hidden, good smooth taste. mouthfeel is a little puckery and pasty in the mouth, phlegmy."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable barleywine if you like American Barleywine style. This compares favorably with the best examples of the style ."
"via colts9016"
"Hops, bready yeast, sweet unfermented sugars and a good finish. Gotta try it atleast once."
"Hoppy balance makes this beer very sessionable for an American Barleywine. Definitely worth a shot overall, good brew."
"Damn tasty Barleywine. Great balance but still heavy on the hops. The alcohol is warming but not overbearing. Lucky to try such a fresh example."
"I've never had Bigfoot, but if it's this hoppy I'm gonna be in trouble..."
"This brew pours a beautiful deep red with no head. A sweet smell emanates of chicory and raisins, and the taste matches, with a dry, hoppy flavor that coats the mouth and lingers. The hoppiness and heat of the alcohol takes over the mouthfeel with a bit of boldness. Nice for savoring, but it doesn't have the advantage of other barleywines in having different tones and flavors open up as the brew adjusts to room temperature. Thus, you get a straightforward brew instead of one that changes."
"D: I have to give this beer the highest rating for its drinkability. The brewers at Uinta have really made an excellent American barleywine without going over the top in either the hops or malt categories. In the right situation, like when you are trying to stay warm in your under-heated apartment, or trying to relax while listening to some great music, this beer is just the right sipper."
"12 ounce bottle purchased from Stuffed Sandwich about a year ago, 10th Anniversary from 2003, have also had a very fresh bottle of this in the past, prefer it with some age behind it, consumed 1/9/09, reviewed from notes, poured into my Three Philosophers glass, color is a dark amber with a one inch off white creamy head, great carbonation for being around five years old, decent retention and light lacing, aroma is lots of bread, big caramel scent, toffee, booze, brown sugar, oranges, berries, and light milk chocolate, taste is dry at first with bread and citrus in the middle, finish is slightly warming and a little bitter, gets sweeter as time goes on, more fruit comes out along with pronounced malt, mouthfeel is sweet, dry, and hot, medium bodied, good carbonation like mentioned above, taste lingers well even for the style, could drink a few of these, alcohol could hidden better and that is my only real complaint about the drinkability, pretty smooth otherwise, only beer I have had from this brewery but it sure is a good one, a little expensive but worth it, would like to drink again, recommended"
"Good American Barleywine here with some nice robust character and extremely good drinkibility. A solid warm up on a chiller February evening. I dug it."
"D = A good sipping beer, goes down easily."
"D: A boringly good barleywine. It really does not have anything that stands out to make it remarkable. That being said it is easy drinking for the style and ABV. Glad I got to try a big beer made in Utah."
"Decent and servicable barleywine, which was enjoyable to drink. But, in the end it doesn't quite stack up against the best in the style."
"Pours to a murky orange brown with thin off white head that dissipates quickly to little lacing. Nose is malty dark fruit, molasses, sugar and a hint of citrus hops. Mouthfeel is somewhat full and syrupy thick, and the taste picks up the fruits and sweet syrup of the nose, with the bite of the alcohol as the beer warms. Finish is warming and a little thick-mouthed. Not a bad beer overall."
"Overall while I have certainly had better, I have certainly had worse as well. I would have no problem at all with putting a couple bottles down in the cellar, and at 2 bucks a bottle not bad at all."
"Drinkability: Something was just a little lacking with this one - maybe the hop schedule, maybe the malt bill, I'm not sure. It was just a little weak in all departments, I suppose. It's still a solid beer though, just not all that it could probably be."
"Pours clear deep amber with thin dark tan head. The aroma is sweet sticky crystal malts mixed with citrus and pine hops and not much else. The taste starts pine hop bitterness that becomes piney, dark fruitiness from dates, raisins and prunes and even some more fruitiness with cherry notes. Nice tasting American style barleywine. It seems to have a smooth balance between dark fruitiness and pine hops with a background of mild malt sweetness."
"I have had this beer cellared for over 4 years now and decided that New Years Eve 2008/2009 would be just as good of time as any. I picked this up in Park City over labor day in 2004. This poured a very deep, burnished ruby color with 1 finger head that turned to a whispy film. The aroma on this is quite complex and deep on this well-aged barleywine. Massive toffee and butterscotch notes mesh with a dose of spices and grassy floral hops. A slight trace of diacytel is found, but with a twist-off bottle, it is to be expected after this long. The deep aromas are almost port-like in nature. The taste is fully layered with huge maltiness and subdued hop bitterness. The body is full, yet thinned by the carbonation. The balance has definitely improved since I first sampled this in 04 but still seems as though it would cellar well for many more years. I was glad to bring this out on such an occasion, but sad to see gone. A lot has happened in the times since I first purchased this in a basement alley liquor store in Park City. Have a safe and happy new year ahead!"
"7/3/7/4/17/3.8"
"Bottled 9/28/08. Pours a clear dark amber-copper color creating a thin, but tight, creamy head. Exits the bottle thick and viscous. Dominant aromas of caramel candies, toasted malts and dark brown sugar are initially noted. Although described on the label as a malty barleywine a substantial amount of citrusy and piney hop aromas make their way through in the background. Some faint distracting and somewhat unwanted aromatic medicinal and oxidation notes are noted also. For such a young bottle this is quite unusual. Palate is slick, full and oily with a very fine carbonation level. Great mouthfeel for a high ABV beer. Flavors start out on the malty side with assertive notes of burnt caramel candies, toasted malts, brown sugar, dark dried fruits and a touch of sherry. A nice balance of moderately bitter pine and grapefruit rind hop flavors slide in at the finish to cut through the sweetness. Overall a pleasant, full bodied warm sipper; perfect for a chilly winter night. At $9.99 per sixer a great value also."
"This barley wine really retained a strong spicy hop profile even after nearly a year of age on it. I'm glad I let it age and would love to get my hands on a few more of these for the cellar."
"D: Nice drinkability overall per style. Big and worthy of an special anniversary labeling. A nice warm slow sipper that progressively gets better as you go along.Worthy of a recommend and very smooth and easy to drink despite its high abv nature."
"D - being extremely malty and extremely hoppy it is as expected not a session beer"
"D: This is a drinkable, enjoyable American barleywine. It's hard to believe it has a 10.4% ABV."
"My bottle states that this is 10.4%. I'd have guessed somewhere in the 8% range based on taste and feel. Despite the lighter feel, this gets to be a bit much and, as the carbonation dropped, the last few sips were a challenge."
"D: I doubt I'll be able to finish this :-("
"Taste is unsweeted bakers chocolate (didn't see that coming at all!) a bit of caramel, sweet toasted cereals, and finishing up with a citrusy hop bitterness. Nice. This would be spectacular with about 24 months on it to age the hops away and let the sweet toasted malt profiles shine through a bit more. Mouthfeel, of course, is a bit heavy at 10%+ abv, but right about where it needs to be, honestly. A decent barleywine that would age exceptionally well, IMO."
"Heavier medium body with very little carbonation...maybe I got a bad bottle in that respect. The higher abv limits the ability to sit and enjoy these all afternoon, plus it isn't quite what many would expect when wanting an American Barleywine. Good beer, but maybe it's in the wrong category."
"Pours a clear but very dark brown that let's quite a bit of a ruby hue show. Airy alcohol nose with faint malts. Flavor delivers a slight touch of alcohol on a slight fruity malty base. Smooth overall but the alcohol bites a bit. Feel is a bit slick on liquid and the carbonation is low. Easy to drink, but not displaying any great complexities at this time."
"Mouthfeel is a solid medium body. Goes down clean, but still requires sipping. A very enjoyable barleywine."
"13th anniversary edition bottled 11/9/06 and purchased at the Wine Cellar in Williamsburg, VA. Poured into a Brooklyn snifter a nice murky dark brown with a decent amount of sediment. The beer is topped with a thin head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is loads of dried fruits, leather and some well toasted caramel malts. The taste is a decent array of dark malts, dried fruits, molasses and leather. The beer is certainly heavy bodied with plenty of present alcohol, but makes for a decent sipper. This is one that I know will take a while to drink, but I will certainly be enjoying it."
"This is their XV (Fifteenth) Anniversary edition at 10.4% ABV bottled on ""8/29/08", so this little number (12 ounceer) has been in the bottle for a total of about 3 weeks! Yikes, FRESH barley wine, not sure how I should feel about that...anyway lightly cooled and into a tulip glass, this one pours a rich, glowing dark, dark shade of honey amber, clear, equally thick and rich dark tan head, that leaves plenty of coating and scattered lace. Nose of gobs of malt, bready sweetness and resiny hops in the rear. First impression of this fresh and young brew is ""wow"" big and bold, smooth on the tongue, goes down easy. Big smooth malts, nicely balanced by more resinous hops on the back of the mouth. This one is drinking great right now and I would assume it will only improve with some time in the bottle. My first try of any of the Uinta line (how does one pronounce that anyway?) which have just made on shore in the NYC area.I'm impressed, well worth a try now or in a few months on one of those cold winter nights."
"D - I can only see having one at night as an after dinner drink. The hops would overpower any meal though some cheeses and maybe fruit plates might be OK."
"I had a bad impression of barleywine for some unknown reason but this one has changed me. I may be seeking out others in the future."
"Balanced to where this guy drinks pretty well. However, with a high abv, you have to slow yourself down."
"2008 Vintage. Pours a clear mahogany with a silky tan head. Nose was a little light. Some bitter hops backed by mild roasted malts and possibly some candy. The taste is a brutal explosion of big hops, bitters and rich charred malts. Nice full body is well carbonated. Definitely a sipper, but quite good. Will age well for a few years. I would call this more of an American Strong Ale or Double ESB than a Barleywine."
"Drinkability: The beer has held up well over its four years and provides a nice, complex take on a barleywine; the hops have settled down and the alcohol has mellowed"
"This is one very well balanced barleywine that is comparable to (and could in circumstances replace) a good wine, and comes highly recommended by this rater. I'd be interested in trying a cellared version to see how the flavors unfold."
"D: Not a favorite among all the barley wines I've tried but good enough to have again. Since I'd not had this before, it's impossible to note how this has developed with age. Suffice to say, it's good with a year and a half of age but may have already peaked. Worth a try and definitely one I enjoyed; thanks, John."
"Served in a bottle at the Bayou in Salt Lake City, this was the 15th Anniversary version. It was a deep mahogany color with very little tan head and fragile lace rings. The aroma was malt and citrus hop and sweet wheat. The taste was solid burnt malt and toasted brown bread and plenty citrus hops. I tasted lime with a sort of charcoal in the background. Midland body, fairly drinkable but a fair alcohol feel too. Raisin was there as well and the hops did't quit. A little bit resinous. Very nice."
"D - This was the first barleywine I have tried, with others in the fridge to soon follow. I was expecting something a little different, but this was good nonetheless. Overall, this was ok, it was pretty bitter and seems that, as the label suggests, it could be laid down to age for a bit to make the hops fade a bit and the malts to shine."
"breity thanks for sending me 2 bottles as I'll lay the other one down for a year and then compare."
"D: Nice tasting brew that was a real joy to sip."
"D: At just under 10%, this is no pounder. One bottle is not quite enough but it is all I've got. If you have some extras, lay a few down as they do nicely with a few years under their belt."
"I really like the aroma of this beer and I think that it will age quite gracefully, but it is just too harshly bitter to be really enjoyable right now. Give this at least two years and this should be tasting quite nice (thankfully I was sent two bottles of this). This is definitely a beer to lay down, in fact I would guess the Brewer brewed this with that intent; so hold on to those Fourteens for a bit."
"Overall- let this warm up. Not bad although flavors seem, a bit, toned down."
"Not a style I care for, but does conform well. Rated on style, not my preferences. Needs some time for the alcohol to settle and the hop character to come around."
"Weird beer: smells like a Barleywine, tastes like a DIPA. That takes some doing. However, I still have four of these out of a six pack for which I paid 10 bucks, and I'm trying to figure out what to do with them. I'm too cheap to throw them out, so maybe I'll have them one at a time with four different very strongly flavored meals."
"Notes: I dinged this half a point on smell, taste, and mouthfeel. As is it might fit better into the IIPA category, but I would imagine in a year or so it will be an exceptional BW."
"Very tasty and easy to swallow quickly. Keep an eye on this one or you may wind up horizontal."
"I picked my six pack up at Bullocks on Sandy Plains Rd. in Marietta."
"Drinkability: Not a top tier barleywine. I, for one, could use a heft of malt and body."
"Drinkability is average, maybe less, as there's really no complexity, even the hop dominated taste is all pine, with the alcohol making it clear you should take your time. Nothing distinguishing or memorable to be found here, sorry."
"The taste delivers on the aroma's promise of hops. My inital thought was that the waitress mistakenly gave me a bottle of SN's Bigfoot. A big alcohol warmth was noticed immediately. It wasn't off-putting, surprisingly, and was balanced by some sweet, nutty malts. Alcohol & hops combined to bite & warm the palate with an excellent, boozy bitterness. The body is medium-thick and spot-on with respect to the barleywine's carbonation level. Overall, this was an excellent American BW...good & hoppy. I would absolutly have it again, and wish I could have some to age in my cellar."
"d: Thanks to JohnGalt1 for 2 of these, 1 from '06 and 1 from '07. I think this has great potential for aging so I'll give the older bottle some time."
"The 14th can settle down for a long while.. will show massive complexity after a stint in the cellar.. right now.. tastes very fresh.. but it needs to relax."
"XIII Release bottled on April 30, 2007. Thanks to Wasatch for this brew. Served at cellar temperature, into my Old Guardian glass, from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a beautiful deep, ruby color that was quite dark. A good finger of thick, creamy, tan head formed, and just seemed to hang there. Great head retention left plenty of sticky lace clinging to the glass. Great nose on this one. Tons of hops up front, plenty of thick malt aromas to back up the hops, a hint of sweet raisin and other dark fruits hidden in the background. Smells very sweet with just a touch of alcohol in the nose. Tons of flavor in this brew as well. Pretty hoppy but not overwhelming. Plenty of thick caramel malt flavors balance this out nicely. Also noticed some dried dark fruits, a bit of wood and smoke, toffee, and some underlying cocoa powder notes. Finished smooth and dry with minimal carbonation, and plenty of body warming, spicey alcohol heat. A nice full bodied barleywine that had a bit of a syrupy feel to it, almost like a cough medicine. Pretty drinkable as well."
"this was bottled exactly two months ago and smells hoppy and alcoholic. The taste is leathery, toffee, and alcohol. This needs some aging but for some reason it seems like a good barleywine for long-term aging (like bigfoot)."
"D- nothing that will make you say wow, unless you enjoy mellow well brewed to style barley wines, it you can get this, it is worth it"
"Overall a very tasty and relatively easy drinking barleywine. Thanks to Wasatch for this gem."
"A bit too much heat in this beer without enough malty flavors to balance it all off. Malt are just too weak. Pine hops rise up but do not linger into the finish. Some nice wood flavors though. I can also feel the hop oils in my mouth even though I cannot taste them as much as I would expect."
"Thanks a bunch Wasatch for the chance to sample this one."
"D: Very tasty, not very filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, when I first started drinking it, the beer seemed like a sipper, but as I continued to drink it, I found myself drinking it quicker and quicker, which is pretty dangerous for a beer with such a high ABV. Overall, I thought it was a very good beer and enjoyed it a lot."
"Even after drinking this beer on a hot-summer afternoon, I did not felt the 9.8% alcohol at work. Like all other beers I have had in this state so far, the alcohol present feels lower than the stated alcohol content on the label, even if it means 4%. The lack of richness and alcohol-feel to this beer makes it very drinkable."
"13th anniversary barleywine. This is funny, because we went to the brewpub in Park City and of course couldn't drink this because of the Utah laws on abv. I found this bottle in a store in Virginia. Pours a very dark brown with some chestnut highlights. Little to no head and just a bit of spotty lacing. Smell is slightly oaky with some tannins and a decent bit of sweetness. Yeast and dried apricots round it out. Taste is somewhat similar to the smell but quite dry and somewhat tannic. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, and a little puckery from the tannins, Not bad aat all, and nice to taste something a little stronger from this brewery."
"I suppose i would rate this beer slightly higher if not for the apparent high hop bitterness. It's still really good, and i would certainly enjoy another. I bet it would age very well. I may have to pick up a case and try that out..."
"Pretty good version of an American barleywine. If you like your barleywines hoppy, then give this one a go. Recommended."
"D: I hate dirty tasting beers. If there is one thing that can turn me off from a beer, its to have it taste like there is dirt in there. Without that aspect, it would have been a lot better."
"XIII Annniversary edition. A nice rich coppery bronze with a thin floating head and just a little lacing. Not too much in the smell, lots of hops, citrus, slight pine. Taste is nicely sweet, hot hops dominate the start. The malt backs it up in the finish with some caramel and dark fruits. Nice lingering hoppy, alcohol in the finish. Pretty nice example of an American Barleywine, nice thick mouthfeel and easy to drink."
"It reminds me some of bigfoot but lighter in hops and body. Worth trying if you can get some."
"The body is big with a light carbonation that brings some of the little off flavors out more. The malt is sweet despite the astringent notes. Overall a good beer with a nice malt presence. Anyways, well worth the trade."
"A nice twist on the barleywine style for me with its lack of sweetness. Pretty good stuff."
"Thanks again to Wasatch for sending me the XV Anniversary. As I remembered the XIV - a very nice Barleywine. Not quite as fruity, a bit more herbal. Thanks, John!"
"Pours a one finger light brown head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Caramel nose. Flavor is sweet but balanced, hops hit right at finish with hints of the high ABV. Lingering bitter after taste. $1.95 for 12th anniversary, 12oz bottle from Utah DABC Salt Lake City, UT."
"I rather enjoyed this barley wine from Utah. It actually reminded me of Bigfoot with a bit of age on it."
"This 10.4 abv barley wine drinks like it, not exactly going down like water. Too much alcohol burn, had potential. My 2nd beer from utah, I won't give up on them yet. Maybe lay this down 18 months & try again if your sitting on some..."
"Drinkability- I couldn't drink more that one of these badboys every-once-in-a-while but overall, not bad. Can't wait to try this little guys brother in 8-12 months."
"A hazey dark copper beer. Has a small tan head. Strong hop boquet with floral and piney notes and a hint of malt sweetness in the background. At first the hops overpower you ( think Bigfoot) but then on the backside of the finish some interesting coffee and chocolate notes appear. Makes me wonder what it might taste like after cellaring."
"Thanks to Wasach for this. I might have to get a couple more and let them sit for a while."
"Muchas Thanks to Wasatch for this Utah frosty!"
"The taste is pretty much superb! Caramel maltiness, toffee, some fruitiness, a light but balancing bitterness. Wow, is this good. The alcohol is there but doesn't interfere with drinking. I reckon this ould be the best of the batches. Without changing any of my scores, I'd say it's an A beer for sure and definitely one that benefits from cellaring."
"A better beer than the ones I've had in the past... and one which I'd actually buy again. It's getting more and more like Bigfoot, which I like a lot, and away from the weird hybrid of English and American style barleywines that past editions have seemed like."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, head disappears quickly, not much lacing afterwards. Scents of malts, hops, some spices, and caramel. The taste is sweet and malty with a nice hop/caramel bite in the finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a pretty decent barleywine."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable and enjoyable barley wine that would benefit from having a greater length of flavor. But, this is much better than anything I ever hope to get from Utah."
"Drinkability- Oddball flavor, wonder what this year would have tasted like fresh? Happy I tried it and will try another years if I see it."
"The drinkability is excellent for this brew as even this relativly young example is easy to drink and any aging would only improve the flavors."
"Don't ever doubt the ability of Utah's brewers to overcome the limitations placed on them by the state legislature. This 2003 bottling of Uinta Anniversary Barley Wine is ripe for the picking if you have one (or more) stowed away and is a testament to the talent present at the best little brewery in the Beehive State."
"Dark murky caramelized garnet with a tight, dense, glass-crawling, light sandy head. Smells of butter rum Lifesavers, dates, figs, caramel. Good malt aromas (if a bit buttery), but there's only a faint hop backing. Starts with toasted fruit malt with mild caramel and leather. Okay. Quickly turns tangy/sour, and not in a good Belgian way. Astringent, nutty, and bitter toward the finish. Off. Butter throughout and this did not age well. Moderately thin body, especially for the style. Disappointing."
"Dark rust. Slightly oxidized, malt melded aroma with rich malt (caramel, nuts, fruit) and a bit of resin and grapefruit. Malt accented barley wine for sure with notes of red apples, plums and hops, that show a bit of spice, resin and pine. An average barley wine."
"Pours a dark brown with tinges of red and about half a finger of light brown head. The aroma is crammed full of malt. Notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, licorice, and a slighty spiciness. Nice piney hop aroma with a little alcohol too. The carbonation is a little overwhelming and it's a little hard to distinguish many of the tastes. I'm getting some chocolate and toffee and some alcohol, but that's really about it. I thought from the aroma that this was going to be really good, but it was hard for the taste to break through."
"Drinkability: I'm still not sure about this at its early stages, though I didn't like Old Horizontal at its early stages either. Yet, I'm a huge hop fan (as far as double IPAs and IPAs go), and I love DFH Olde School, but I wasn't a big fan of Old Crustacean. So I don't know, maybe I have to come to grips with realizing that many barley wines just aren't my thing? Not sure, but either way, this isn't an expensive beer, especially for one bottle, so I'd say it's worth a shot (despite what my review says) if you're a big fan of the style."
"Perhaps a bit more age may soften the intensity of the piney hops, but I think not. Otherwise it's a really well rounded, soft barleywine that's a joy to drink; and in fact, at times the contrast of the raspy hops to the rounded sweet malt is quite nice. Well done."
"Mostly clear black brown body, with a light tan collar. Juicy robust malt barleywine flavor nose -- ripe prunes. Light and flavorful. Lots of sawdust and fermented booze and grapes. Lots and lots of malts. Wide mouth bitterness -- hop edges all over the body, sharp and bitter. Medium impact barleywine and port aspects. Balanced yummy barleywine."
"12 ounce twist off bottle. Forget where I picked this up in VA, but the price tag was $1.99. Eleventh anniversary XI, best before 02/12/05 on bottle."
"If you like a mellow sipping barely wine you can do much worse than this. True to style"
"I've been sitting on this for a while. We'll see what it is like now and then crack the other one I have in a while. It pours a deep ruby, almost purple color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is piney and peppery hop with a big sweetness underneath. The flavor is pretty mellow. There is a roasty quality, almost coffee-like, that moves to a piney bitter. The feel is rather thin for a barleywine, being just at moderate. Overall, this is just an average beer. Nothing really grabs me and pulls me in to it."
"A new state. OK on color and aroma, but not much on taste. Low as a barleywine, a little too drying. Altogether doesn't work, with sweetness and medium mouthfeel but acidic, and too much alcohol in there. Maybe in a few years, but I won't look out for it. Radekfest #5"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" of tan head over the clear bright chestnut brew. Head is long-lasting, and the lacing is great for the style. Aroma is strongly of piney hops, with a sweet undercurrent. Taste starts with sweet malts and pine, goes grainy/gritty in the middle, and closes with a bitter, sour aftertaste. Certainly not what the appearance and nose were leading me towards. Mouthfeel and drinkability are not that great for the above taste issues. Maybe age would help this one, time will tell."
"Drinkable but not that great a barleywine. Needs more complexity to be a great brew. For the money Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Ale is a far better beer of this type."
"Orangey light brown cloak is crowned by a slight off-white ring. Beautiful biscuity malt has a profuse earthy and smoky backbone to it. At the same time, the severe alcohol bite is dwarfed by obtrusive c-hops, sharply piney, orangey, grapefruity.. Palate presents also that immature hoppy profile on a leafy platter, almost harshly so and Im usually quite fond of leafy flavors. Suggestions of wood, pencil shavings (dusty finish), vegetal green hops, toffee. Medium body shelters a low carbonation. Nevertheless, just for being what it is (10% barleywine from Utah), this is an absolute must."
"Quite dark brown in color, with a moderate, creamy light tan head that leaves a decent lace down the glass. Aroma is mostly sugary at the start, but develops a somewhat fuller malt character as the beer warms. The flavor is actually quite hoppy -- perhaps overly so -- with a strong leafy character. The brown sugar sweetness is really not enough to balance. There's just not a lot of depth to the malt character of this beer -- it's too transitory, and fails to establish any serious presence in the mouth. As a result, the overall flavor is a bit harsh, even after, I guess, about one year of aging. Not objectionable, but far from my favorite barleywine."
"Mouthfeel: not as full as I would like, but the carbonation is perfectly restrained."
"In an ideal world, I would seriously consider popping one of these away just to see how it ages - but I live the Real World, and with the small closet in my 11th floor Apartment already full of much better beers slowly aging, I dont think that this really cuts the mustard or deserves the space to be honest. There are much better Barleywines for my money."
"10th Anniversary barleywine, poured from a 12 oz. bottle. It pours a deep reddis-orange with a fairly thin head that disappears quickly and leaves no trace of lace. The smell is piney hops with just a bit of sweetness. The taste seems to go from from somewhat unpleasantly unbalanced to decent and back again. It finishes with a strong, astringent flavor that is only made worse by the hop bitterness. I'm having a hard time finishing this one."
"One of the better drinkin' BW's I've tried in a while due to its slightly lower ABV and marveluos hoppy edge. Freshly yummy; quite a good barley wine, as I said, damn, I wish I bought more."
"The biggest apparent difference between the draft and bottled versions is the level of oxidation and sweetness. Overall I think the draft product is superior to the bottle, but still a nicely done effort from the Mormon land."
"9th anniversary 2002 edition. Poured a ruddy brown with very light carbonation. Head didn't really form, just pretty much went straight to lace. Smell is grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Taste is very smooth dark malt, almost an oakiness or tannic quality to it. Fades to a sharp hop finish that is strong in grapefruit and pine notes. It certainly mellowed some from this past summer. I wish the malt character was more pronounced or had more depth or something, but this is a tasty beer - especially with some 4 year old cheddar!"
"Thanks to alexgash for this one. 9th Anniversary edition, bottled in 2002. I've been aging this one for awhile, time to crack it open on this fall night, watching the Twins. Deep dark red color, looks like a port or red wine. Thin tan head that leaves speckled lacing on the sides of the glass. Caramel and chocolate covered rummy raisins dominate the bouquet. Bit of hops as well. Taste is amazingly thin and the nice smells don't come through in the taste. Very few flavors and a very astringent lingering aftertaste that is unpleasant. Glad I got to try this, but a poor example of a barley wine."
"Pours out to a clear, deep-brown garnet color, forming a thin, dark-beige head with poor retention and lacing despite a vigorous pour. Aroma is intensely hoppy with a very piney aroma, a peculiar sand/dust aroma (maybe all that sand in Utah has worked itself into a Utah-themed brew!), and toffeeish amber malts. Taste is very acidic (like spit-up), with sticky amber malts buried/hidden somewhere in there. Mouthfeel is very cloying with a firm body and medium carbonation. Alcohol is not very noticeable in taste, but certainly is in the buzz it packs. Not very good stuff...horribly unbalanced, and an absolute embarrassment to the style."
"Deep ruby hue, w/ sparse yeast aggregates.  Thin, but tight off white head. Enticing mix of rich caramel, toffee notes and biscuit malt aroma with a citrusy and slightly piney hop nose from the apparent dry - hopping.  Fusels are noticeable as the hop oils dissapate.  Fairly intense bitterness hits the palette upfront, but heavily caramelized sweetness follows.  Hops do dominate, however, and nearly overwhelm the malt profile.  A bit of bready malt flavors come through as the beer warms, but other malt flavors are overshadowed by the hops. The quinessential American hop flavor is some combination of the four ""C" hops.  Finishes w/ a lingering bitterness that masks residual sweetness.  This is a fine barleywine-- I really wish I would've waited a couple more years before trying it.  The malt flavor is lurking behind the hops and just yearns to shine...  Flavorwise this is very similar to Bigfoot 2001.  This could pass as a clone.  Easily the best Utah brew I've tasted."
