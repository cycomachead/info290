"They say this is a nice one to bottle age, but who has the patience for that? This stuff is so good, so mellow & so gone in 60 seconds."

"O - 3.75 - A decent little Barleywine, but not a great one. Would work in a pinch when yours craving the style, but isn't worth taking up space in your cellar to track its flavor development or anything."

"This was the 2010 version. Can't say I've had any other year, but this was pretty decent,"

"Very nice malty finish. Masked high ABV well. The best beer I have had from real ale. Truly a must have"

"My first barleywine, and I do like. 6/6/13 Version Drank 12/31/14"

"Bottled on 7-31-14, consumed 12-19-14.  After agitating the sediment in the bottom of the bottle, it was then poured into a tulip at 60 degrees.  It poured an opaque rust-reddish-orange with about an inch of creamy off-white colored head that dissipated into a thin film, leaving nice and sticky flecks of lacing all around the glass.  Smells like pear, apple, apricot, sweet malts, and a slight hint of alcohol.  Medium thick and creamy mouth feel with light carbonation, and it's definitely a sipper.  I taste malty sweetness blended with ripe pears and apricots, followed by a mild lingering hint of toffee, with mild hop bitterness staying on the palette for a while.  This beer is less than 5 months old and the hops and malts work together nicely, but I can imagine this beer might become overly sweet with too much age.  Alcohol is noticeable but it blends well considering that it's 11.5%.  Overall this is a very good barleywine, and I will be ageing the other two bottles from this four pack."

"O:  I probably should have drank one of these a few years ago when they first came to me, but this beer is drinking really well.  Flavors are good and it's aged gracefully.  Hops are much more apparent on the nose than on the palate and it aged gracefully."

"High D+"
"Got in a trade with Cyde. 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/1/2012. Pours very hazy orange copper color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, orange rind, apple, caramel, raisin, toast, brown sugar, floral, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, apple, caramel, raisin, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Light earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, apple, caramel, raisin, toast, brown sugar, toffee, floral, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine! All around great balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"From my tasting notes on a 2012 vintage: I know barleywines are usually better with some age, but the word on Sisyphus is it is incredible fresh since it is made with a load of hops. The bottle I sampled was about 3 months old according to the bottle date, which is not a lot of aging time for a barleywine. The pungent citrus hop aroma crept out of the bottle as soon as I popped the top. The beer poured a copper color with very little head. There was a nice citrus, grapefruit hop bitterness at the front that quickly dissipated into a smooth caramel and toffee malt body. It had a full mouthfeel and medium to full body that you would expect from such a substantial brew with no harshness and not overly boozy. It is definitely a hoppy Barleywine. Maybe the 3 months took a bit of the hop edge and bitterness out of the Sisyphus because I thought it was just the right amount without being overly biting. The typical barleywine flavors were allowed to assert themselves and play nicely with the grapefruit hop undertones. A really wonderful brew that keeps Real Ale on the forefront of the Texas brewing scene."

"Sometimes, I really enjoy trying a beer that I've never heard of and have no expectations for, because I'm typically a sadistic pessimist and will often go into new, unknown beers thinking they're going to be the worst thing I've ever tasted, and when I try them and find out they're not (usually the case), then it's even more of a treat. Such is the case here - very good brew that I'd have again if it were available to me."

"I've had Sisyphus fresh and aged up to 5 years. Both are very delicious. Sisyphus is a fantastic barleywine. With years on it, Sisyphus is a very special treat."

""

""

"I haven't had a fresh one but this is an incredible beer with 4 years on it. Only slight oxidation that hardly detracts from the synergy of all the other components. Awesome mouthfeel that demands sipping. This is drinking fantastic right now and seems like it could handle a couple more years of aging."

"All around impressive barleywine, enjoyable on all fronts. I'm glad I took the chance and grabbed this local gem, it's pretty nice."

"The beer poured a good amber color, and I could smell the hops. The smell had a fruit tang, like citrus, more like orange than grapefruit. I could taste the hops. I could not pick up much of a malt taste. The beer had a creamy feel to it. I felt very little alcohol warmth. Since I don't like American Barleywine (I prefer English Barleywine when I get Barleywine style beers), I probably would not buy this again. If you are someone that likes American Barleywine style beers, this would be a good one to try out since it matches the style (with the exception of alcohol warmth) well."

"Not my favorite barleywine, but a significant one. Damn, that's strong!"
""
""
""

"Tried the 2012 and first try was less than favorable as the alcohol seemed to overwhelm any flavor but for the sour hops. The second and third glass (not the same night) however changed my mind. Seems the hops tame over time and an added caramelized or sweet note balances the hops. But make no mistake the punch in this barley wine is not for a ""sisy."""

"a great sipper, a wonderful barleywine.. way breadier than most i've tasted."
""
""
"O - A solid example of the American Barleywine. I'm really just not subscribed to the idea that they are worth aging though. Thanks for the chance to try this gtermi!"
""
""
""

"Pours a crystal clear medium orange with a thin off-white foam that couldn't keep it together. Slight wet cardboard notes in the early aroma hint at oxidation. Saltine cracker and toffee. Also detecting some dark fruity esters, blackberry. In the cup, I'm picking up citrus fruits, caramel, lightly toasted bread, and a small amount of butterscotch in the background. Touch of vegetal in the finish. Medium in body, carbonation is fairly low."

"I love barleywines. This is a solid one, but not particularly spectacular."
""
""
"O: This is a solid beer. I bought several bottles so I can age them and see how they turn out with time."
""
"O – Very good barleywine. I cannot believe the ABV, because you really cannot taste it throughout. It only has that nice alcoholic burn to it that indicates that it’s there. A lovely barley wine overall and it is different as well, not like barefoot that has that hoppy quality to it, this is much sweeter and has much more malt present. I will definitely be getting this again."
""
""
"D: Very nice for a barleywine. Not too overpowering to be drinkable, but still not a summer afternoon chugger in any way."
""
""
"O: A nice mellow, sweet, slow drinking barleywine. Very smooth, though that might be the age. A little bit of nice bitterness to balance the sweetness. All good things. Just a little simple, that's what keeps it from garnering higher numbers. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Great stuff! Big, bold, balanced and flavorful, this one drank away far too easily. Less alcohol burn would put this one onto another planet, but it was still fantastic. If you get the chance to try this vintage, don't hesitate. Very glad to have had a chance to drink this one KungFu. Cheers!"
""
""
"O - Pretty darn drinkable. As I get older I'm not as crazy about high gravity beers as I used to be. This one is a very nice sipper. It is aggressive but pretty balanced. I'll take this over a Double IPA any day."

"Big thanks goes out to lnashsig for sending me this one as an extra in a past trade! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured a deep yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I really enjoyed the aroma on this one as it was spot-on for the style and quite inviting while still letting you know that it packed a punch. The flavor seemed to follow suit, but didn’t really do anything else for me which was kind of a letdown. There was a nice touch of sweetness, but the alcohol presence definitely made itself known in it which hurt the overall appeal of this one for me. If you like Barleywines you owe it to yourself to try this one."
""
""
""
"Overall- Mild, mellow, high drinkability, but malt isn't very complex and it's neither spicy nor fruity. Needs something to kick it up a notch. Worth trying, but I don't really see it developing much over time. I'll hang on to one and see if it proves me wrong, however."
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter glass, bottled on 3.23.12. This pours a nice copper / amber color with a small off white head. The smells are of caramel, citrus hops, alcohol. The feel is almost thick nice carbonation. The taste is pretty good nice amount of hops and grapefruit, along with a nice caramel / toffee good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wonderful beer. I'd love to grab a few more of these to age and compare. Most definitely gonna get another pack for celebrations this year."
""
""
"Overall, a really nice barleywine that holds its hop character very well. The 2010 vintage is definitely holding up nicely and drinking well. I would definitely have this again. The hop notes fresh must be very nice."
"O: This was a good, clean barleywine that doesn't get too introspective but also stays away from alcohol burn and only malt. Worth it."
""

"Another goody captured on tap at the Whip In in Austin, Texas, this barleywine is a solid amber color, slightly hazed with a modest white head and fair lacing. The aroma offers deep rye malt with hints of sweet whiskey. Very nice. Thick cloying rye whiskey jumps out on the palette, I love it. Simple and nicely balanced with vague banana bread and orange subtleties. This barleywine approaches full bodied with peaceful carbonation with a calm, near whiskey-like feel. This is a little bit of a different take on barleywine but very tasty and highly recommended."

"Atmosphere is decent. Not much to look at, but nose is full with maple, malt, orange, and a hint of spice. Full, thick pungent and sweet body. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"O- A good barleywine that has enough differences from others to make it interesting. I think this would age really well; maybe the astringency in the taste would fade. Thanks to Texasclimber for this sweet extra!"

"O: Sweet, almost like candy. Just a great barleywine, reminds me of Hog Heaven. Gonna buy more to drink now and cellar."
"Overall: A great barley wine, and it's consistently good too, the 09 and 10 were excellent too. I think these will benefit from a few years in the cellar."
"nice amber color, nice head, a classic barleywine/imperial mouthfeel which I love. Different label than shown in picture, gray foil background."

"Good beer and thanks to friend Jax. Poured at a great temperature and with decent, cream colored, fine, head that lasted for a while and lots of lace. Color is a slightly hazy amber. Aroma is malt, hop, yeast, fruit, caramel. Flavor's like nose, with mild carbonics and super balanced. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish is like flavor, tapers nicely, sooo good."
"O- A good barley wine. Lots of interesting tastes in this one. I would be interested to see how this one tastes as it ages even longer."

"Wow, this is a very smooth beer at this point! The ABV is well hidden and the beer leans sweet, but is not cloying by any means. A little hop scrubbing on the finish does wonders for the drinkability. Rich and semi-complex, it really offers a fun ride all the way through. I am shocked at how much I am enjoying this bottle and will have to pick up more than the one or two I do each year. I have had this at a few different stages including a 6-year old version on tap, I think this might be the best bottle I have had. Maybe 2 and a half years is right in the wheelhouse? Hmmmm, more research is in order I do believe!"
"The flavor mellowed out but still maintains an intensity. I get candied orange, some light chocolate dusting, a present bitterness but the hops have faded. Some light oxidation and a long, long finish. A surprising treat."
"Incredibly smooth, incredible drinkable given the ABV and style. Drinking very nice right now."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being below average. Overall it was a pretty solid beer of the style all around. It felt pretty balanced for the style as well. Both the malty and hoppy qualities shined at one time or another while drinking it. Pretty enjoyable beer to sip on this evening."
"2010 pours orangish amber with 1/2 inch white head dissipates into very little lace. aroma of toffee. taste of fruits and toffee. mouth feel is at a medium slightly sticky to the tongue. overall a great barley wine another year might make an improvement."
"o - overall, i dig it. it is easy to drink, the abv is invisible. i'd love to try it fresh...but the year or so on it certainly couldn't have hurt it since it is so tasty and smooth."
"O - A little to phenolic for me, kind of sweet and sharp made it a bit difficult to get through the entire 12 oz. Not a bad beer."
"Pours a murky honey brown with a 1 inch fizzy light beige head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel/toffee, alcohol, and citrus zest. Taste is of bready malt, brown sugar, caramel/toffee, and citrus zest hops on the finish. There is a very mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a light carbonation and a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barleywine with a nice balance between the malt and hops."
"O: I think this was pretty well crafted overall, but it is still no match for its rather stiff competition in the BW category. I'll have this one again, but definitely won't seek it out."
"An average barleywine, has a few things to work out and it could improve."
"Overall, a decent American barleywine, but it certianly reminds me of why I like their English counterparts so much more."
"O: Glad I was able to try this."
"O: a great offering, one I'd seek out again, only wish there was more carbonation. I'd like to try a fresh one to see the true hop profile."
"Overall a very good barley wine. Taste as if it had a year or two on it, smooth with the taste melding together well. Better than most, not as good as some. Worthy"
"O: Highly underrated Barleywine, I think that Real Ale has been perfecting their recipe over the years and now it is among the best of the variety. If you are a fan of Barleywines than I suggest you ask for one (or five) during your next trade with someone from texas. They're fairly abundant from what I can tell, just FYI."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer a lot. It's the first 2+ year old barley wine I've had, so I don't have a ton of comparison. I would seek this out again."
"O - a diamond in the rough; must get more of this to age. It's not harsh or overly hopped like some barleywines. I'd love to try the French Oak aged barleywine, ""Kraken."""
"Thanks again Jeff"
"Overall I think this was closer to an English barleywine due to the pronounced sweetness and fruity notes, but even so it wasn’t near the top of the style. A solid beer but one not worth seeking."
"I actually like this quite a bit. The malt-forward profile, balance, and booze character is what I want when I think of a barleywine. This years was better than previous that I've had. Recommended."
"Overall I enjoyed this brew but think it could use a couple more years on it."
"D: A solid barleywine, that has aged well. Maybe a year past it's prime. Would like to try this fresh to see how far it's come"
"A good barleywine but not the best I've tried."
"This was a decent offering of the style. Its good, but nothing to write home about. Always grateful to try beers I can't get here though, so thank you for the opportunity Hector."
"O: Being that it's my fault not giving it enough time I can't be TOO harsh. That being said, the harshness of the booze is a bit much. Given time I'd like to try this again."
"O - If I had regular access to this beer it would be a regular purchase. Worth more than the 3.99 I payed for the bottle. Excellent beer right here."
"O - Real Ale has a solid barleywine here, interested what some age will bring. Only a couple a day at most after I noticed the 11.5 abv Jesus Christ this beer could put you in danger with its easy drinkability. It is a definite American style barleywine although brewed with english malts."
"O: Decent BW, could use a little higher SRM to add to some of the malt potential on this beer. Okay. Not the best."
"Overall, I did enjoy this, but would like to try it with some age to lessen the alcohol presence."
"Overall, a rather malty barleywine. Not bad, but it seems like it needs a little time to mellow out."
"Light in body, and smooth, the alcohol inhibits the drinkability and knowing what it could be hurts it as well. With 1- 2 of age it starts to drink fabulously, new however I'll pass"
"D--Hot beer, would not be able to drink too much of this, but good version of this style, glad to have tried it..."
"As drinkable and approachable an American barleywine as I have come across. Highly recommended."
"Aroma of sweet malts and a very nice fruity undertone, including hints of orange, apricot, and pear, with a light alcohol on the nose as well. Moderate caramel malts lead into a strong fruit presence consisting mostly of citrus (orange and apricot) giving way to a nice, bitter hop finish. Smooth on the palate, with a nice drying finish."
"Pours cloudy orange, head is good and beige. Smells floral, fruity, melony, cucumber, sweet goodness. Taste is fruity and floral, slight mango, hop bittering, sweet tangerine, some dominating flavors combating subtile ones here. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is high. Due to the flavor amplification this brew suffers on the drinkability, but a pretty solid brew overall."
"As far as barleywines go, they don't get much more drinkable. This is not cloyingly sweet or palate shredding bitter. Balanced flavors and subtle concealed alcohol make it an easy sipper."
"This beer pours a copper colour with a nice off white head. Smells of caramel, toffee and some dark fruits. The dark fruits come through strong in the taste, mainly raisins and plums. The back palate hosts toffee, caramel and butterscotch. It is like a dessert! Mouthfeel is light heavy with warming alcohol presence, perfect for a cold day. A true sipper and this one will catch up to you fast but it is worth it!"
"2007 bottle, extra'd by Jim. Pours a clear guava, pinkish orange color with a head that quickly settles to a collar. Nose is a fairly round malt, sweet apples. Very nice feel in the mouth -- rich, thick, tingling bubbles, kind of evaporates on the tongue. Medium-heavy body, quite a bit of honey, I get this apple quality. A touch of bittering hops that's somewhat at odds with the flavor profile. Fairly large, but I want more aggressive malt and darker fruits here. It's nice, but I'm not sure this particular year is going to get better."
"This is a beast of a beer, but very enjoyable, take your time with this one."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"D: The new year is still young but this has to be the frontrunner for the surprise of the year so far. An incredible beer from start to finish and it achieves near perfection in every aspect. I've never had it fresh but aged, this one is a masterpiece through and through. Amazing!!"
"Will compare soon to the '09 vintage and revise my rating if necessary..."
"This is a good beer, but really fades into the background compared to the ever increasing amount of really great barleywines out there."
"(Also tried a 2009 recently as well and while it was pretty good, it wasn't nearly on the same level as the 2008. Either 2008 was an especially good batch, or this ages incredibly after 2+ years goes by. Definitely recommend buying some of this up and drinking it after it's 2 or more years old.)"
"D: Tasty brew and a solid barleywine. A nice sipper."
"D - Amazingly drinkable for a barleywine, not overwhelming at all and although you can't really taste the alcohol it still is a slow burn to it."
"D: Not too bad, but hard for me to get through since it isn't the tastiest barleywine out there."
"M/D - pretty thick mouthfeel. Very flavorful and tasty, although the drinkability isn't great. A good beer I'd recommend though."
"Surprisingly really good. Get it and drink it."
"Thanks again for this one jeff."
"Somewhat ""dusty"" looking orange/amber color. Not much carbonation though seems somewhat lively in the glass. Poured like a sticky syrup. Heavy malt, trace of alcohol and a kiss of hops aroma wise. Big, big malty flavor. Dried fruit and a heavy caramel sweetness. Enough of an alcohol burn to be noticeable but in a good way. Sticky, resiny and gummy flavors. Same in the body-a sticky, smooth creamy quality to it that I love. Really stands up in the glass. really quite the US barleywine. Not the huge hopbomb like Bigfoot or Old Ruffian but damn fine. YUMMO!"
"While this smells and feels like a high alcohol beer, I would never have guessed just how high. Excellent drinkability for the style and for the ABV."
"In all, this was a very enjoyable beer and I might have to pick up another bottle when I head back for groceries tomorrow night."
"d - Considering this is 11.5% ABV, it is insanely drinkable. Not sure what happened to this one over the past 3 years, but it was somewhat flat and something seemed off in the taste; as I noted before, it seemed watered down. Would like to try a more recent vintage to compare it to, but probably wouldn't want to try a 2007 again."
"3.0 D: Overall this is fairly boring. It's not bad, but could use an infusion of flavor."
"The body had a real good heft to it, carbonation very mild, but it doesn't need anymore. The feel was real thick and creamy, almost to the point where it was doughy. Despite being as viscous as 10,000 miles worth of Pennzoil, it's brutally easy to drink. One must watch out, because Real Brewing does a noble job of sneaking quite a bit of booze in this bad boy."
"Beer is thick and surprisingly not very sweet up front. There is some heat at the back and it finishes mildly dry, but doesn't dry me out. There is some mild sweetness in the mid to late palate. Minimal hop presence throughout. The more I drink the more the taste creeps forward. Its a pretty drinkable beer for its size, I'd say its well above average, I'd have it again."
"Overall, a decent bwine, but not too hoppy. All sweetness and malty. Fairly drinkable."
"D: Not overly sweet, though leaning that way, still a good bitterness and balance. This could be good fresh or with age."
"D- This was a alright barleywine. I was expecting a little more from it but it was not a drain pour in the slightest. Maybe an infected bottle or maybe a over-carbonated bottle? I have a couple more bottles of this so I'm actually looking forward to them."
"Bottle of the 2008 batch. Pours a slightly opaque burnt orange color with a coastered offwhite head. The aroma is super matly with notes of dark fruit like raisins and plum, some spice notes as well that I can't put my finger on. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Malty upfront with a transition to some bitterness and alcohol. Not a whoe lot going on in this one, pretty run of the mill."
"Conclusion: very pleased with this beer and I would have it again. A good beer from the little town of Blanco."
"Sisyphus poured into my snifter as a warm, red amber topped with a large pillowy head of foam and a small amount of lacing. To the nose it was quite candy-like -- sweet honey, candied citrus fruit, and the barest trace of a hop tang in the background. On the tongue, the effervescence yields to a strong brown sugar note and syrup, which is kept interesting by the addition of a bright zesty flare of hops. As others have said, this brew is quite skilled at concealing it's gravity, and is definitely on the sweet side for easy consumption, but if you're looking to savor something slowly on a night meant for relaxing it's quite fitting."
"My first offering from Real Ale. Sisyphus isn't bad, but there are so many better options in this segment."
"D: Great beer, this could probably age for a several more years and more malt flavors would emerge, it would even benefit from a little oxidation. Overall, very enjoyable and drinkable."
"D: this is the best example of a barelywine that I have found!! really, reallyl great. But I cant honestly give it hi marks for drinkablility - what with the hi abv and huge body this is just too rich for sessioning."
"2009 Vintage. Reviewed blind as part of the Blind Beers BIF. Here we go: It pours a cloudy amber, closer to the browner side of the spectrum, topped by a nice finger of creamy foam. The nose comprises mandarin oranges, caramel, honey, orange peel, biscuits, and a touch of rye bread. The taste starts with a nice bite of citrus and pine, followed quickly by rush of heavy caramel and toasted biscuits. The body is a solid medium, with a lightish carbonation and a feel that borders on the chewy. A very tasty ABW, one I wish I had access to on a regular basis."
"Sisyphus is a heck of a barleywine, especially as far as drinkability is concerned. It's engaging enough to be a fully enjoyable drinking experience & a quick one at that, since it isn't particularly intense. Good stuff."
"D - One of the more drinkable barleywines I've tasted, which is a bit tricky considering the sky-high alcohol and caloric counts. Enjoy in moderation!"
"As far as the style goes, its pretty good. Nothing to write home about but yet its not bad by a long shot. Barleywines are one of my favorite styles so in my opinion there has to be a lot going on for me to rate it world class. With that being said its a solid well made American model and if you are ever down in Texas and come across this I'd recommend you grab one because who knows when you might see it again and also it might be worth wile to lay down in your cellar for a few years to see how it develops. Of course you might disagree with me completely and that's why its called taste and opinion."
"This was listed at 480 calories for the bottle, which is insane. You can feel every last calorie too in sugar and in alcohol, packing pounds on you as you down each drop. Decent, but not worth it if you're on a diet...or if you're not. Just drink an aged Bigfoot, like I did right afterwards, which was way better."
"D- too high ABV to be sessionable. interesting enough to come back for a second. i wish this one was available here."
"Overall, I didn't think this one was sour or infected as others noted with this vintage."
"Much props to JJFoodie for this wonderful brew. Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter. Amber in color with 1 finger white head. Smells of earthy hops, dark fruit, slight malt and slight alcohol. Taste follows through adding slight hop bitterness and less malty than expected. Full body and light carbonation. Good drinkability for a barley wine. I wish I had more to age."
"It's funny how these things work. Last time I had a huge move, one of the last beers I drank at my apartment was the 07 vintage of Sisyphus. Two years later... it's still the same beer and same vintage. This one, however, isn't infected. It is, sadly, rather mediocre. Utterly lacking in definition and identity, this beer is a blend of nondescript aromas and flavors - brown sugar, a little honey, some caramel - on the nose and on the palate. Modestly sweet, this beer is medium-full on the palate, and an utter disappointment. S/T/M = 2/2/3.5"
"Flavor is semi-complex with dark fruits, booze, molasses, mild hop bite, and burnt tobacco. Overall it's a mellow-sweet flavor. Medium to full body, semi-high carbonation...but not overkill at all. Very tasty beer! Glad I got this in as an extra!"
"Overall this wasn't that bad at first and then it started getting cloying. Don't think I'll be having this one again."
"This isn't one of my favorite styles, but I thought it was well-balanced and enjoyed it. As a malt maven, I imagine I will find it even more tasty with a few years of aging on it."
"Verdict: Bursting with great flavors, balanced brilliantly, and surprising quffable, Sisyphus is a real delight. I can't wait to sit down and try a vertical of the vintages I have on hand to see how this evolves."
"For an 11.50%er, this one is smooth and drinks perfectly. This one drinks flawlessly."
"Recommended."
"I don't think I've encountered Real Ale Brewing Company beer before. Sisyphus is pretty damn good. It's an interesting Barleywine. I'm not accustomed to such a fruity flavor. But, it works well. I think I'd like a little more dark fruit, but the lack of it doesn't hurt things much. More bubbles would be good, as well. Hats off to whoever figured out how to make beer this big seem so small. Wow! Good stuff. Recommended. Thanks, Chris."
"Edit: I see now that a couple of others have picked up a wild Brett influence. If you have 2007s of this, drink 'em or send them my way!"
"I'm glad I hung onto these bottles for this mini-vertical, and if I see any more '07s, '08s, and this year's '09s on the shelf, I think I'll pick up another round to try in another year."
"Pours reddish orange with a nice tan head. The beer is somewhat murky. The aroma is sweet malt, alcohol and some fruit, possibly grapes and apples/ The flavor is caramel, toffee, assorted fruit and alcohol. The beer is slightly boozy and the alcohol is warming. The finish is some slightly bitter hops. Medium mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation."
"D - a solid barleywine, nothing fantastic...also have a 2008 bottle to open soon and compare"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, maybe a little thinner than I was expecting, with a fairly light carbonation. With the rather low carbonation/smooth feel and the well hidden alcohol this is a dangerously easy beer to drink."
"drinkability: easy to drink in a 12 oz bottle, but more than one and i would need a driver!"
"Drinkability is high because I love BW's and this was damn good BW. Proud to have a good beer from Texas (I think they are pretty scarce.)"
"I haven't had a lot of barleywines yet, but this one has convinced me I need to try more of them."
"First time I have had this beer. It was quite amazing. Beautiful color, feel, taste, smell. Everything about it was gooood. I'm very happy that Real Ale is finally bottling up more of their beers. I have a lot of people that love the Real Ale company and I think it's about time that they all get to taste them on the go. 2008 was the year of Sisyphus that I had. Gold label."
"A big ABV limits drinkabilty, but it doesn't kick the same way some others do, surprisingly."
"Glad I got to try this one. This is the first aged barleywine I have tried, and it makes me wonder how much better the fresh ones I've had would be had I been patient with them."
"I have to deduct points off the drinkability scale because the beer is all around weak for what I expected. Not only that but the flavors get old fast. Pair that with a heavy ABV and it kind of gets to be a chore to drink. Definitely worth checking out but I would only enjoy one every once in a while. Not a bad thing for a good beer that will age very well."
"Overall a nice barleywine, and one i would like to try fresh. That being said, i do see some significant aging potential for this one, and i am glad i have an 07 bottle as well to put some more age on. A nice barleywine, thanks barks."
"D - Pretty good barleywine overall with a decent hop bite, although this wasn't overly malty. This struck me as more of an English style barleywine rather than an American style."
"Courtesy of RB's own lb4lb via trade. Pours with initial explosion of foam upon opening with slightly hazy copper body and thin off white head. The aroma is pretty big with odd tart fruitiness, mild malt sweetness, over attenuated honey and urine. The odd tartness and urine notes seems out of place (maybe I didn't need to include ""out of place"" here) and creates a very different aroma compared to most barleywines I've had. The taste isn't nearly as tart and has sweet malts to start followed by fruity tartness that enters early and only becomes more tart as the experience progresses. I get a hint of caramel too but it is far too meek a note"
"This is a must try."
"Overall: A good tasting brew that I could pick up and enjoy anytime. Cheers!"
"On tap at the Gingerman Houston. Pours clear copper with a thick white head that looks like a nitro product, though it's not. Great lacing. Smells caramel-sweet with plenty of hop character. Plenty of light fruit, especially orange. Almost candy-like. Tastes both sharply sweet and somewhat bitter at the same time. Full caramel malt flavor against resinous hops; both sides are quite strong, and almost clash rather than balance one another. Full, borderline-syrupy body. This one seems like it could use a few years to mellow out the hop notes...glad I picked up a few bottles for the cellar."
"A bit thin, easy to drink, the alcohol is well hidden, a good drinking barleywine - bummed I can't get more as I bought this on a trip to Dallas. Get it if you can,"
"D: Not overly complicated and fairly well-balanced for a barlywine. I like it."
"In all a really nice barleywine and my first tasting of something thats been aged."
"If I ever manage to get one that isn't clearly infected I will revisit this."
"I said this one was on tap because it was a 2007 vintage. It was in a bottle. Very good. Get some if you can find it."
"I never tried this fresh, but all thats left for hops is bitterness, but it doesn't matter because the malt is so good. Really good, not sure why the rating is relatively low. This pretty much destroys every Canadian barleywine I've tasted (except for Rudge's creations)."
"Thanks Grant!"
"D - Big beer, not a session by any stretch. Nice, though."
"D: For a barleywine quite drinkable, I'm curious what the 2007 that I have will taste like since this was already pretty mellow."
"drinkability is great. the alcohol is well hidden, and the tropical fruit aspect gives it a nice depth and new dimension not typically seen in american barleywines. good stuff."
"Pours a mostly clear orange, very vibrant colour, thick white head forms, quickly settles down to a medium ring around the glass, tons of lace spots stick to the glass, real nice pattern, looks pretty damn good. Smell is nice, lots of caramel, very fruity, lots of sweetness, brown sugar, peaches and apricot, alcohol, oranges and grapefruit, maple syrup, mangoes, pretty nice. Taste is neat, caramel and brown sugar sweetness, grapefruits and orange peel, some spiciness, very malty, biscuity, mango, very tropical, touch of raisin and alcohol, very fruity in the finish, solid balance, pretty nice barleywine. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, pretty smooth for the ABV, not spectacular but definitely enjoyable. Last 07 bottle I had was somewhat infected so its good to see that isn't a lasting problem. Thanks Greg!"
"Fruits on the palate, and not enough malt. Maybe some coconut? I was immediately turned off of this one and didn't spend the time to investigate. Something a bit off about this one - possibly because it needs more of everything (but fruit and alcohol). It does have a nice creamy mouthfeel but a bit too much syrup, everything else needs a good bit of work. Certainly doesn't stick to the style."
"Sisyphus 2007. Poured a cloudy amber with a thick tannish head. Great lacing down the glass. I noticed some white chunks floating around in the beer even though I stopped short on the pour and it had been sitting upright for a while. Lots of woody, sour beer, horse blanket notes in the aroma, some malt and hop, but overpowered by Brett. this is when I looked in the bottom of the glass and notiched the little round blackish brown and white chunks sitting there. This bottle is definitely infected with Brett. It's a good thing I happened to like the Brett flavor. I risked it and drank it and it was pretty tasty. A slight caramel flavor that is quickly overcome by the combination of alcohol, woody pine hop and a heavy wild Brett flavor. Nice and oaky and barnyard sour. Mouthfeel was a little thick but I couldn't imagine it any thinner for this style. Drinkability is alright however since this seems like it is an infected batch so I'm a little wary."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like. I think this should have just a little more viscousness. The carbonation is on the lower side and isnt a problem. The alcohol is invisible. The drinkability is really just short of fantastic. The beer disappeared at an alarming rate. I would have never pegged Texas as the location for the brewer of a big bold barleywine."
"I poured this fairly hard because I wanted to get a nice aroma release. The head formed slow, late and very little appeared. It did have the typical barleywine color, a cloudy dark amber. The first smell to arrive was honey and lots of it with raisins and figs to back it up. (Note to self, do a blind tasting with aged barleywines and old ales.) More raisins in the taste, hid the alcohol well and had a delicious caramel malt presence. It had a sweetness to it but it wasn't overboard and not too syrupy. There wasn't much carbonation left but was velvetey smooth and had some viscosity. Every sip was very enjoyable and didn't want to reach the bottom"
"In fact I think I will."
"A solid representation of the American Barleywine style. Very impressive display of malts. All while a sickly easy to drink, drinkability. Good stuff here Real Ale."
"im gonna go out on a limb and say the 2007 is one of the tastiest barleywines ive ever had...age has done wonders to this beer imo but then again i havent had it fresh...kudos to real ale on both of these"
"This was my first time trying this beer and thought it worked well on cask. As previously mentioned the high abv was well hidden and the citrus kick helped make this a great beer. Will have to search out the bottled version the next time I am in TX."
"A solid barleywine and a sweet offering. I would age it some more and see if the bite relaxes and the sweet mellows out."
"Thanks to wagenvolks for the trade of both 2007 and 2008 bottles. Each one is poured into a Brooklyn tulip. '07 pours a quite hazy dark orange with a razor thin off-white head. '08 pours a tad less hazy with a slightly more well-defined head. Aroma is burnt caramel and brown sugar with '07 much more abundant than '08. The taste is loads of brown sugar with sweet fruits and as expected, the '08 possesses a more defined almost cloying sweetness that has greatly subdued in the '07. The beer is medium bodied, with '08 being a bit heavier. This one is a decent Barley Wine, but I have had better."
"Maybe I was spoiled by having the incredible Lagunitas Olde GnarlyWine a few weeks ago, but this one just fell short of the mark. I had high hopes, being a Real Ale fan for years, but this just did not have the depth I was anticipating. Where is the character?"
"Drinkability is limited somewhat by all that sweetness, but still a pretty nice barleywine."
"I love the fact this one is made in Texas and sporatically available. I will drink it again, and the 2008 is just now coming out and has a gold label."
"D - I would prefer a few more hops to cut the toffee flavor. It gets cloying as you drink it."
"Not my favorite barleywine, but quite nice, and I truly dig the feel. Lots of lip smacking. I've liked (more than the BA average) many Real Ale beers, and this is no exception."
"drinkability: good, just not memorable"
"D = This is definitely a sipper, but one to which I will happily return."
"Pours a light brown colored body. Had to work to get the head. Off-white color, good lacing, not very lasting. Somewhat lacing. Strong hoppy aroma, sweetness. Some dustiness, some syrupyness. Some malts. Dusty sweet taste. Not as strong as a typical barley wine."
"The body is big with a good warming effect. Carbonation is very light. Would like a bit more balance here. Some sweetness in the finish but ok versus the alcohol notes. Overall reading other reviews this beer seems to age well over time. Would suggest to age a bit longer than I did."
"2010 edition shipped from Augustgarage was much much better. Smooth mouthfeel, better drinkability, though smell just OK."
"D- Very drinkable for a >10% barleywine"
"A sipper - herbal bitterness mixes in as it goes despite the aging. Alcohol shows, but doesn't dominate."
"Not my favorite barleywine, but a fine example of the style."
"The flavor doesn't exactly make Sisyphus stand out as a top 10 barleywine, but it drinks nicely and masks the 11.5% extremely well. Starts out with a blast of grassy, citric hops and quickly succumbs to sweet boozy sugars, toasted caramel malt, and a nutty graininess. Not a hint of hotness to be found. Hops linger throughout the finish, adding a nice bitterness to complement the syrupy, medium-thick body. All in all, a tasty barleywine that I'd gladly purchase again. In many ways, Sisyphus reminds me of Elysian Brewing's Cyclops barleywine, but with a bit more malty depth. I think the 2-year mark is about perfect for this brew...not too hot, and the hops are still in effect."
"Sorry to say this one wasn't much more than mediocre for me. This is the second Real Ale I've tried & neither was notable at all. Lots of far superior barleywines out there."
"I have thoroughly enjoyed all the previous Real Ale brews I've tried, and I approach this one with much anticipation. This 2007 vintage pours cherry red with some orange hues. The head grows to almost one finger in heighth, but not until the very end of the pour, and it recedes quickly with some disorganized spots of lacing left behind. The smell of very sweet caramel and resiny hops mix as some dark fruits, yeast and grain move around underneath. A faint musty earthiness is detected. The hops don't hit upon the first sip as much as they linger throughout the palate. There's a good amount of fruity tanginess and bready sweetness which balances things perfectly, and doesn't keep the barley and pine resin from surfacing toward the end. The body lies toward the medium to heavy end, but it's goes down smooth, without much alcohol (11.5%) being noticed, and without weighing too much on the stomach. This is an exceptional barleywine that doesn't seem as extreme tasting as it's alcohol content would suggest, and whose components work in concert without individual extravagances."
"A smokey, boozey, hoppy barleywine. A bit of initial sweetness, but not much of it makes it to the residual stages. Slick and buttery, some toffee. Has a deep, smokey booziness like a scotch almost, reminds me of a harsh old ale in that respect. These factors are the big detractors for me. I didn't like that taste in Founder's Curmudgeon, and though a different style, I really don't care for it here either. Mellows out a bit as the beer approaches peak temperature, but definitely not the easiest drink in the world. Finishes with a bitter hop flourish, a very hoppy barleywine, whereas I prefer them on the sweet side. Seems pretty well made, but has a few different aspects that don't seem to agree with me."
"The mouth feel is fine, it's perfectly carbonated for what it is. It goes down very well and very fine and tastes like a mix of carmel and sweet fruit. Doesn't go down much better than your average craft brew, but the best thing I've had from Real Ale, w/o a doubt."
"One of the more drinkable barleywines I've come across. Light and easy drinking. Not overpowering."
"D: Obviously not a session beer at 11.5 abv, but very nice for what it is. Which for me is an inauguration celebration, Congrats America!"
"Overall a very good beer. This is the first barleywine I have ever had and if others are this good then this style is going to quickly move up the list of my favorite styles."
"Pours a nice golden orange/red color, some carbonation, not much of a head, but some fizzyness, which does leave some oil slicks and small islands. The nose is malty, with some hops, nice touch of spices. The taste is sweet, malty, nice hop punch, and spicy. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden pretty well, leaves the body warm. Very Drinkable, this is a tasty BWSA."
"This was an alright Barleywine, but there are certainly better ones. It seems pretty generic and lacks complexity."
"Drinkability: Not a terribly good barleywine, in my opinion, though perhaps this one just didn't age well. It was interesting enough, intensely fruity and malty, but just a little too light over all, a little too alcoholic, and a little too salty."
"Drinkability is insane. I've had different vintages of this beer aged between 1 and 1 and a half years but never one over 2 years aged and it definitely smoothed this beer out alot. This is almost like liquid candy, so smooth and flavorful, sad that this was my last one. Must trade to get more of this beer and looking forward to aging it longer to see how it changes"
"Overall, a very nice brew. The guys at Real Ale have impressed me with their session beers and now this heavier one."
"D: For this beer being a barleywine and so high in ABV it goes down incredibly easy. This beer is tasty and just complex enough to keep it interesting. So damned drinkable. I am a bit taken aback by this. Just great. Highly recommended."
"D=For the chilly late fall and winter months here in texas, its a perfect evening sipper or would go great with a hearty dessert. Sopapilla cheesecake anyone?"
"Overall, this is a very good example of a specialty beer from the little Real Ale brewery. They've definatly got a good one here."
"D - Very smooth and enjoyable. Not harsh at all like some barley wines are. I was very impressed and would have this one again in a hearbeat."
"D: Wow, nice sipper and okay for the season, but too thick any other time of the year in my opinion."
"Same stone fruits in the mouth with a lot of hop bitterness in the finish. Slightly sour and not sure if it should be. However it is still very tasty and full of flavor. Mouth is very tight and full of hop bitterness. Too much so for my barley wine style preference."
"Overall: A delicious beer, I'd place it closer to English style barleywine, with a solid bitterness. Reminds me of the solid in-between barleywines, like Rogue Old Crustacean."
"I think this is still probably a bit fresh, which would explain the harshness. Lay it down for a year or two, and I bet it will mellow out and the clever mix of flavors will emerge and blossom."
"Thanks to ballewblake for this one."
"It pours out an opaque burnt orange, like a roasted pumpkin, with no head and leaves little lacing. The smell is of aged hops, burnt sugar, a little orange peel and just a hint of the alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick like syrup with just a little carbonation tingling on the tongue. The hops come through in the taste, but they are sweet and mellow. There is some vanilla and a hint of figs. Overall, I really enjoy this beer. The alcohol is hidden well and there is a bit of complexity to the taste. A great beer."
"D&Notes: This one deceptively strong beer! By far, the most balanced barleywine I have ever had, as the huge malt body is perfectly balanced by a good dose of hops, but yet even with 77IBUs (as claimed by Real Ale Brewing's Website), the hops are not overdone at all. I would love to get my hands on a 2008 vintage bottle to compare it to this 2007. Reminds me of Charlie Papazian's saying regarding that a barleywine not aged enough is like a mountain without its peak."
"from wickedpete in beer-o-cache v1.0"
"Given what else I've had from RABC, my hopes for Sisyphus were less than high. Having said that, I'm pleasantly surprised. This is a good little sipper that should warm the bones of craft beer lovin' Texans during those frigid, 35 degree winter nights."
"Only about an inch of light tan head forms with a strong pour. Body is a pure ancient amber tone. Nose is syrupy sweet with lots of boozy dark fruit, honey and vanilla. Enters the mouth with noticeable raisen pie notes and toasty biscuit tones. The flavors swirl around the tongue with a mixture of yeasty spice and slightly soured dark fruit and long carmalized richness. Mouthfeel is thick and very nice. Alchol is well hidden in the flavor porfile. Enjoyably drinkable."
"mouthfeel is bitter, heavy, hot, sweet, after half a bottle the alcohol became apparent. A very nice barleywine from real ale, i'd love to get my hands on more bottles."
"Pours out a rich, tawny color with almost no head whatsoever. Because there is now head, there is no lacing or retention, obviously. The smell is heavily of malted barley with alcohol also. The taste follows the smell identically. It is an incredibly rich taste, nothing over the top, but very well done. I'm really happy I was able to try this. Great beer."
"Pretty spot on in the mouthfeel and not bad to drink. But, yah. Hey, if they made it with some more bitterness to balance the sweetness and to give it a little tang, well, this would be great."
"nice sour malt on the 2007 vintage this one isent as ruff as most barlywines are usaly, and at 11.5 abv ther is no noticable aolhocal burn in the after taste, but for me this one needs more hops, dont get me wrong, i enjoyed every last sip, but i like a hoppy barleywine better."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a nice lingering aftertaste that coats the mouth. Very drinkable barleywine but the alcohol is rather steep."
"I'll admit to being forewarned about possible contamination & as I was staring into the beer fridge after have a disappointingly unfunky / uncomplex Weyerbacher Riserva, I figured what the heck, might as well have a beer were the funkiness plays a distinctive role even it was unintentional. Judged purely to style this is a monumental failure, funk has no place in a modern Barleywine, but taken as a hedonistic experience it is not half bad. This will get substantially more funky with time as it seems to be at the beginning of its funk journey; proceed with caution, but with an open mind this can be at least somewhat enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is quite thick and viscous with a slight syrupy quality to it as well. This one really takes hold, coats the palate and doesn't hold back. Mellow carbonation works in well. Overall, a tasty barleywine from Texas, albeit a bit on the sweet side Thanks to dmeadows for sending this my way. I wish I had another one to hang onto for a bit."
"[In reading the reviews of barleywinefiend, alexgash and JohnGalt1, it seems I'm not the only one detecting a lot of uncharacteristic funk. In reading a lot of other reviews, there's no mention of sourness/funk, so perhaps this is an infected batch...or the guys from Jolly Pumpkin sneaked into the brewery late one night.]"
"Poured an orangish/copper color with a tan white head. Carbonation was good upfront and even as I sip the head stays with it. Nose was hops, bitterness and a funky sourness(not sure if this was intended or what). Taste was a little sweet, hoppy up front and then midway through as I swish it around the sourness I smelled came through in the taste. It was almost like a tart bitterness fruit orange peels, unripened fruit even. It went down smoother than the taste. Interesting bwine indeed. Another bwine down. Thanks mhewes."
"Thanks again, Zack..."
"Pours a deep hazy amber with a thin dense head that dissipated to a ring quickly leaving a fair bit of delicate lacing. The aroma is dominated by a massive candied sugar scent that had a hint of hops in the background, but not much. The flavor is also dominated by the candy sugar with hints of caramel malts. There is also a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish though a medicinal taste lingers in there as well. The mouthfeel is light to medium for the style but still nice and creamy. This is a decent example of a barleywine though the sweetness is certainly higher than most."
"Into an imperial pint, pours a lovely dark peach orange, a nice off-white half inch head that settles to a thin film, lots of lacing down the glass and sticks in arches and blots. The aroma is a nice boquet of floras and leafy hops, sweet with caramel and bready malt, and some nice fruits. The taste similarly satisfies, but the mouth is extraordinary. Velvety smooth, the effervescent carbonation, the light warmth, supple body, all support richly malty, sweet and fruity flavors, with floral, spicy hops to follow. Everything solid but far from overbearing. If it is possible to make a high alcohol sessionable barley wine, this is it. Much thanks and praise to BeerZach for this."
"Picked up this bottle in trade with BA ""Turbine2475"" a few months back. Poured a reddish honey color, thin light tan head. Nice foam lacing. Aroma is very yeasty. Some malt sweetness in the back, but the bready aroma overwhelms. Taste has some dried apricot notes, faint alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy, a bit astringent too. It's far from being my favorite barleywine. I doubt very much i would buy it if offered. The aroma kind of ruined it for me"
"Big thanks to Lee for trading me the 6'er of Sisyphus.. that said, none of my last 3 bottles show ""bottle neck funk"". I won't hold it against you. :-) I still have another Chicken Killer to get to."
"Drinkability - an enjoyable bottle, I hope the other three are intact as well."
"Huge everlasting head for a barley wine nice lacing as well. Comes off as a deep amber with red hughes sporting a hazey look. Smells very nice, floral and piney notes right away with fruity hops and heavy sugary sweet carmal malts smell. Little bread/biskut as well. Beautifully ballanced flavor throughout everything in the nose comes into play. Very thick on the palate yet still drinkable for a barley wine."
"Pours a semi-cloudy apricot copper. Thick, creamy, rocky, light beige head. Nose is fruity, but in a tart sort of way. Medicinal notes. Some caramel. Forgot to mention that there are little white spots on in the foamy head. Hmmm...could this be infected? Let's see. Yep. Big time band-aid and fusel alcohol flavors. Astringent, electrical fire bitterness. Blechh! Sorry, but this is a drainpour."
"A really complex beer that I love. A seasonal release that I garb a bunch of every year to enjoy fresh, and age for later. One of the best beers made in Texas. Highly recommended."
"Pretty good little brew here... A good solid little barleywine.."
"D: Hmm I am not sure about this one. I think most of the group at the tasting hated it, but I liked it. I have to admit the cat piss aroma is hard to get by but it's a rather unique tasting barleywine."
"The only defect I see in this beer is the strange sweetness in the aroma."
"Pretty solid beer. Pours a heavy orange color with small to no head. Love the smell. Full of hops I would almost call this a double IPA but whatever. Very solid tasting brew. Lots of hops followed by some very very nice understated citrus tones. Really a good beer in almost all aspects the ABV is too high but oh well what the hell I'm going to bed now anyway. Best thing made by this brewery by far."
"Drinkability: While not a bad barleywine, it doesn't quite display the grace or complexity I look for in the swanky barleywine style."
"Strange brew, and from the reviews, I must have got a weird bottle."
"2007 Version - Pours a deep a red/orange color with an average head, and below average lacing and slighty under carbonated. Smells of citrus and bitter hops. Tastes of rich malts complemented nicely with a lot of hops. The 11.5% ABV is very well hidden. A great beer."
" Might fine Barleywine."
"D - This is only the second Barley Wine that I've tried and I must say that its pretty damn good I've had it a few other times since I first took notes and I'll be getting more of it again"
"Very nice barleywine. One of the better ones I've had."
"Review Number 900!"
"American BW aspects showed up subtly versus in your face. I let this one warm up, quite a bit too prior to consumption, so this late game hop surge took me by suprise"
" A great beer. Masks the high alcohol fantastically. You can tell that aging this beer for a really long time will be in order. Snatch the '07 while you still can!"
"Thanks to turbine2475 for the bottle. Pours thick and viscous and a beautiful dark orange color. Very little head but excellent lacing. I wonder if the brewery has some quality issues with this brew. Some of the reviews seem to be reviewing a different beer, and I had this last weekend at the brickstore where there was a pronounced band-aid taste. Happily, my 2007 bottle is clean and fresh tasting. Nice aromas of sweet citrus and honey, but a little light. The taste has more oomph, with the same sweet orange and honey, but with more vibrancy and the addition of some floral flavors reminiscent of wildflower honey. Not overly sweet, as there is a nice bitter flavor to balance on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, abit sweet, but very clean and not sticky at all. Quite nice, a pleasure to drink, and no hotness at all even with the fairly big abv."
"Overall, it was not bad by any means, just a little too sweet for my tasting. Maybe it was better fresh, or maybe it needs a couple years to figure it self out. Either way it was an above average beer, but nowhere near, the big flavorful barley wines I have had in the past. I would say grab one and sit on it and see what happens."
"Definitely the best beer I've had from Real Ale BC. Not that they do any bad beers, but the Sisyphus is a rung higher on their ladder than the others. A fine example of the American Barleywine. Seek this out and give it a try."
"I got a couple of 2007 bottles in a recent trade with mhewes, thanks. Nice simple label, hopefully the beer speaks for itself. The color is a nice cloudy orange and has smells like candy, cherries and syrup, a slight bit of fumes. The flavor is interesting at first and then a little medicinal,aspirin and then hoppy bitterness. It seems hot but it does have a nice cinnamon flavor which is weird and as it wamrs it starts to taste better. It feels warming once it hits the stomach. I am going to let the other bottle sit for awhile to see if this tames it down some."
"Served in my DFH snifter. Poured burnt-orange/copper in color. Quarter-inch off-white head with copious ringlets settled into a thin an oily swirl; no lacing. Scent is sugary sweet, with dark fruit (raisins/prunes) and a slight bready quality. Taste similar to nose (so sugary sweet) as well as a hint of caramel. Extremely viscous mouthfeel, almost syrupy, followed by a little bitterness at the finish. Drinkability is somewhat limited by it's consistency and abv, which was surprisingly well-hidden."
"Delicious."
"The mouthfeel is kind of on the thin side and the carbonation is low(appropriate for a BWSA)and it finishes on the tart side because of the dark fruit. Pretty tasty fresh and I could see this would be interesting as to where it would go with a bit of aging on it. I'm certainly glad I got the chance to try it!"
"Drinkability: This is a sipper, if the taste matched the aroma, it would be a much better beer. I wish I had another one to lay down for awhile. Worth a try!"
"d: Big thanks to JDV for the chance to try this one. One of the best so far for me."
"Big thanks to JonathanL9870 for this one."
"Sisyphus pours rather thick. It does have a rather pleasant copper color. Very light carbonation with very little head and even less retention. A powerful malty aroma with distinct smell of raisins.The first sips were slightly sour. As I continued to drink it the sweetness really piqued my taste buds. The mouth feel wasn't quite my to my liking but not bad. Overall the complex vanilla, caramel and raisin flavors complimented more than contradicted. All in all a good beer from a good brewery."
"Drinking the 2009 version in early 2011, I find that this version has resolved the carbonation issues I noted earlier so I am bumping the Appearance and Mouthfeel scores by .5."
"2007. Poured really thick and viscous, tiny beige bubbles formed a solid cap, settled to a thin skim and ring. Spotty lacing, good head retention, particularly for the abv. Slightly hazy orange colour. Herbal/floral aroma with mild malt and alcohol in the background. Kind of weird, but interesting. More malt in the flavour, caramel sweetness with moderate bitterness. Hop flavour was forward, again with the herbal character. Sort of reminded me of the grassy/herbal flavour of Jagermeister, just not as intense. Heavy body with fine, low carbonation. Alcohol was restrained and mostly contributed a pleasant warmth and hint of spice in the finish. Definitely not a clone of every other American BW out there. The herbal quality really sets this one apart. It was kind of strange at first, but it really grew on me and came into its own as it warmed."
"It's not an undrinkable beer, but could be better called an American strong ale--or even a winter barleywine. The spice is simply overwhelming this beer, and while it's not bad tasting.... it doesn't taste like a barleywine."
"2007. Pours a hazy rusty copper in color, a small cream and butter colored creamy head fades to a ring. Aroma is raisins and sweet plums, sugary caramel maltiness, and a mildly bourbony alcohol. Taste is a light fruitiness, some berries and cotton candy and sugary maltiness. Some light appley tartness blends well with the sugary caramel malts. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, somewhat sticky sugariness coats the mouth, creamy full feel from the large malt content and low levels of creamy carbonation. Some alcohol warmth in the finish as well. Great barleywine, easy to drink, but then I love barleywines. Would love to lay one down for 2-4 years and let it thin out a bit. Thanks Steve for the opportunity."
"Enjoyable, but I think the abv is going to prevent me from saying its ""drinkable"" per se. Still, very very solid from one of my favorite Texan breweries. Glad I have another of these stashed away."
"Thanks to RickSawyer for the opportunity. A bottle of 2007 that pours a slight hazy amber/orange with little to no head. Smells big and boozey with a good fruitiness to it, maybe candied apricots? Also some rich malts in the nose. Taste is MUCH mellower than expected. Slightly silky on the tongue, refined malts with a little carmel and toffee. Well balanced with the hops, which are tough to discern. Ends with a really nice warmth. Very enjoyable, would have really liked to tried this one fresh to compare it to this. Very smooth drinking, could easily sip this throughout the night."
"Had the 2007 on tap at Rutz in Houston and wow what a difference from the 2006. Taste is more reminiscent of that barley wine taste you'd expect, much harsher on the alcohol side than before. Drinking from a bottle I get the same thing. This variant almost seems to be a different beer to me. Drink ability is still there but I'm more hessitent with it now, Not something you want to over drink in a session, and hard to go through fast (I got to the bar late and it was one of two places in Texas (they said) that got a keg of the '07. So got one glass, drink it, last call, got another thinking they'd let me finish but no, had to slam it and it was a challenge.)"
"Nice amber body topped with a white head. The aroma isn't as strong as I'd like. It has a bit of malt in the aroma. The flavor has a good spicy malt base with nice bitterness. The balance is great. The body is a touch light for a barleywine but it's about medium. This is a very smooth and balanced barleywine; very easy to drink."
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: Maggie's Farm by Bob Dylan"
"D: Ok, this beer is slow to drink. Definitely a sipper. I can't see having more than one of these in a night."
"judged on the basis of this 2007 bottle. seems like a perfect candidate for cellaring to round out the body. alas, I only have this one."
"D: One of the most drinkable barley wines I have ever had."
"Nice, heavy mouthfeel expected for a barleywine with excellent viscosity - almost has the feel of a light-medium body dessert wine. Fresh, balanced, malty taste with good hop aroma, although masked by slight over-abundance of alcohol. Well-made, solid effort."
"Very good; I'd recommend it. I had this on-tap at the Austin Gingerman."
"Overall: I really liked the maltiness in this beer, but I thought it could have used a bit more hop bitterness."
"D - pretty good. This is more sweet than I normally drink, but then again I don't drink barleywines all the time. Real Ale have been doing good things, and this is one of them. I'd have it again and regret not grabbing it while it was on tap. There's always next Christmas I suppose. Check it out if you can find it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 2"" yellowish-beige head over the 10W30-hued brew. Head tightens up to about 1 1/2"" and holds steady, with nice lacing for the style. Aroma is syrupy sweet, with some fruity alcohol notes, but not overpowering by any means for an 11.5abv. Taste exhibits sweetness firstly, fading to the fruity alcohol, which is a bit more pronounced than the nose led to believe. Lots of warming going on. Mouthfeel and drinkability are pretty good for the style, although the sweetness becomes a bit off-putting as warming occurs, and you'll not be having many of these in a sitting, although the complexities make revisiting a cool option, at another time. Good barleywine."
"D: my first barley wine, so I can't comment much about the style, but I know the bitterness in the aftertaste was a little too much for me"
"Keep on truckin' Real Ale!"
"I enjoyed this one and I'm interested in tasting how it ages."
"Pours out an orangey honey with a thin ring of ""head"" and tiny spots of ""lace."" Nose is of brown sugar, plums, sherry, and grassy hops. The plums come out in full force in the flavor. High piloncillo sweetness is perceived. I get touches of melon and a grassy hop finish with some nice bitterness on the back. Some alcohol warmth, but it is impressively subdued considering the gravity on this one. Good flavors here, but I'd like a little more complexity, I guess. Mouthfeel is thick, syrupy, and has an ever-so-gentle carbonation. Tasty beer, but the sweetness holds me back from giving this a higher drinkability."
"Far from a good Barleywine, Sisyphus has everything except 'flavor'. It just doesn't taste like much of anything. It feels wonderful, but goes down like thick muddy water. The 2007 exhibits almost no positive flavor; but given the time it's been sitting around since it was bottled, maybe in Majestic Liquor's coolers, maybe not, I can sympathize (this is supported by my review in 2007). The 2008 does have some good fresh hops, but not even enough for an American Pale Ale... so maybe it's an English Barleywine? I still think it's weak. If this is the best that the boys at Real Ale can churn up then they need to hire a real Brewmaster. At least it wasn't really over-priced."
"Good job Real Ale."
"This gets better each year. It's a shame it gets such a small, limited release."
"hahahaha! a case was sent to my local after talking to my head beer honcho of the whole city! Pours a dark tan-brown, has a constent foam layer... The aromas that emanate are fan-freakin-tastic! ... yahoo!..''maybe she's sleepy??'' ... for an american barleywine, this has to be the most drinkable in all of man kind!!! .. i could drink this after a 90 min soccer game or with breakfast in the morning, its that f*ckin good and SMOOTH!!! balnced and tasty, I recommend this to anyone who even considers a barleywine once and a while because this is the definition of: beauty! ...by the way, is this really 11%..????"
"Tried a bottle right off the shelf. Being in Austin, I've tried quite a few Real Ale brews and have found them to be inconsistant sometimes. Pours a copper body, off white head, and little carbonation A very vicous pour. Smell is toffee, caramel, hints of fruit and alcohol lurking-hops are understated but have a nice bit of pine/citrus aroma to them. Tastes like the smell-fairly sweet with the toffe and brown sugar and almost being too sweet and then being rescued by some piney hops that finish in the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is very full and this beer coats the entire mouth. Fairly drinkable, but maybe a little syrupy to have more than 2. Overall a very good effort by Real Ale."
"Taste is smooth, creamy, friendly earthy sweetness with a nice mouthfeel and a nice mild grassy hop finish. Not cloying, or overly hopped like many barley wines seem to be. Very balanced, and a bit tame, but the drinkability is high. Hops kick in a touch more as it warms, and the alcohol is extremely well hidden. Nice beer and looking forward to seeing how this one ages."
"I was impressed with this one. Real Ale has never really wowed me until I tasted this beer. I am going to the store tomorrow to buy them out."
"For such a big beer, it's rather drinkable. I wanted to let it sit another year, but curiosity got the best of me. Certainly a good American barleywine, that fans of the style should seek out. Definitely the most impressive beer I've had yet from the state of Texas."
"On tap at Opal Devine's in Austin. Pours a deep hazy orangey amber with minimal head. Aroma is sweet with significant fruity hop. 11.5% is well hidden in the tasty malt/hop balance, tons of both. Not unlike a well aged Bigfoot. The best beer brewed in Texas? I can't think of one that's better."
"Still struggling with the American hops, but I know a good brew when I taste one."
"Drinkable, yummy tasty as all hell but I do wonder if this wouldve been better fresh? Maybe not. Ill never know. Regardless, it was fitting I drink this one year removed. I like it very much but I think I like the gesture much more. Sometimes the pursuit of great beer is kind of silly and superficial but Ill never forget Sisyphus. Thank you again, assurbanipaul. This was a special beer from TX."
"Sip on this for a while, 'cause it packs a punch."
"Mouthfeel is warming but still slightly raw. I would recommend sitting on this for 2-3 years and hope it turns out like that vintage '03."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Drinkability is good a nice barley wine from TxBeer. But if you can find any 04 you would be better off buying it all."
"Pours a rusty orange color with a short white head that fades into a thick and heavy lace, coasting the walls of the glass as you drink. Nose is sweet fruity malts and quite floral hops. Fairly full-bodied and almost chewy in texture. Lots of juicy citrus fruit in the taste up front along with a bit of dark caramel followed by some bready notes. A strong blast of bitter raw hop leaf tannins and resins concludes the tasting, coating the tongue in a bitter oiliness until the next sip is taken. Very nice. Ive been letting this one age to mellow it out a bit and it still seems rather raw. Thanks to Bentley for the sample!"
"2004 vintage, 11.2% ABV."
"A very refreshing barleywine...definitely American-style. I would have no problem putting back one or two more of these in an evening, but instead I will cellar the other I obtained for a year or so...time will make this offering from Real Ale that much more enjoyable."
"Opinion: This is a no kidding around kind of beer! This beer comes across as big to me the whole way through. Dont get me wrong, I like big beers, but this one is almost over the top. The flavor is so assertive with hops right now that your palate is ringing...this doesnt let you taste much else. It would probably be pretty darn good after two+ years when the hop character mellows out to let the malt through."
"This BW has good drinkability now and I think it will improve. Nice warming effect. The liquid is very smooth and it slides right down. Good local beer and one I look forward to having again."
"Drinkability: As concentrated as the flavor is, the overall effect is mellow and easy to quaff."
"Overall Impression 5/5: Holding up nicely. Checked this bottle due to reports of problems with this batch; this bottle is just fine. Heavy handed, full flavored, lots of hop flavors holding, no oxidation noted, hope the rest in my cellar are fairing as well."
"Beer Cellaring potential Sisyphus ages incredibly well. Ive had a 2yr.old bottle and it was rich with heavy butterscotch flavor, better than most new and aged barleywines Ive tasted. Wait a year at least as I've noticed no difference at 6 months."
"The beer after its reluctant departure from the 12-ounce bottle sets in my Stone Arrogant bastard glass as this bad boy deserves a special glass, a deep hazy orange with a minimal frothy light tan head and as it evanesces, the residual lazy a fine sheet to surround the glass. Nose is heavy with fusel alcohol, sweet with malt and hints of sugar, light hop spiciness also noted, and a sure presage of whats to come, start is sweet with a thick grain presence and the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is modestly acidic, the hops strong and the 10.7 percent ABV makes itself known in the dry and somewhat bitter aftertaste, a real hoot this one and one well worth waiting for, my thanks to Travis for this bottle, WOW!"
"Taste: This one the malt took a back seat, the sharp finish is a lot more pronounced, on that teetering limit between Barleywines and I2PAs. Not that this is a bad thing, mind you. It's filling, rich, and displays a creamyness as you swallow but once it goes by your uvula the gripping bitter aftertaste lasts a good long time."
"Color is a cloudy-ish copper in color. Barely any off-white head to speak of. Lacing? Nada. Aromas are almost overwhelmed by the distinct medicinal alcohol fumes that boil up. ETOH-soaked fruits and cotton candy abound, with some caramel squares left behind. Flavor, as was the nose, is laced with alcohol. Not a raging inferno, but certainly noted on the palate. A little much. Lots of sweetness in the taste as well. Surprisingly dry and abrupt finish. Full-figured and slick on the palate. Alcohol notes more noticeable as it warmed. Certainly a bottle to share...the small serving size was just right."
"The head is small, thick and creamy white. The beer is amber-copper-brownish and a touch hazy. Wow! Huge, sweet, buttery, caramel, syrup, fruity nose. Unbe-freakin-lievable. Sweet butter-caramel syrup in front. Super thick, fruity, caramel middle. Substantially bitter finish with alcohol kick. A very bitter aftertaste. Man, this is freaking awesome: so buttery, caramely. Sweet, but not too sweet for me (I'm pretty sensitive to over-sweet beers). Big hoppy finish. Absolutely fantastic."
"Comments - This beer makes me think of lightly fizzy apple juice blended well with alcohol (without being cidery). This stuff should improve well with age (and the taste score will probably go up as well)."
" Carpe Diem"
"Drinkability is good. Really well constructed ale, with some more work this beer has serious potential."
"Thanks again to HardTarget for exposing me to all the wonderful beers at Real Ale!"
"A gentle pour from a longstanding bottle delivers a hazy, reddish-amber body beneath a creamy head of ivory colored foam. As far as barleywines go, the head retention is good, and it leaves some nice splashes and spots of lace about the glass. The nose is bright with floral, fruity and leafy hops over a rich, sweet, light-caramel and biscuity maltiness. It's quite smooth and creamy in the mouth with a full body and a very fine-bubbled, natural carbonation from bottle-conditioning. Malt and hops balance each other superbly in the flavor! Gently caramelish malt is peppered with spicy and piney hops; and then softened by floral hops; always backed by a solid bitterness. It's not overtly complex, but it's rich and satisfying in a big way. Alcohol, however, starts to become apparent after a few sips; and bitterness begins to build in the throat beyond that. Still, it's well worth trying!"
"12 ounce bottle, marked 11.2% ABV. There was quite a bit going on in our old buddy Sisyphus, but he just could not get that rock up the hill and score on the drinkability factor."
"All-in-all a very good barleywine."
"Cheers to Fly for procuring me a bottle of this rare Texas barley wine. Moderately aromatic, floral, fruity and quite lively with a nice equal balance between malt and hops along with a bouquet of apricot, pine, dough, more dough and baked bread. Rich malts (caramel, raisins, fruits) combine with a healthy hop level (pine, apricot, grapefruit, lemon, herbs) which leads into a superb, dry and lingering bitterness. After a quick vibration in the mouth, like a cell phone, more flavor consumes my palate. Its more of an apple/butter toffee flavor. Very well hidden alcohol. Creamy, coating mouthfeel. Im a sucker for a good barley wine and this one did it for me. Thanks again Fly."
"Hazy amber. Nice aroma, very hoppy with notes of honey and maple. I love the smoky feel in mouth which accompanies well the lemon, peaches, caramel and salt. Very hoppy as it warms, coniferous bitter aftertaste. This seemed a bit underrated to me. Now you're talking Joet!"
"Drinkability-3.5"
"The 10.7 percent alcohol in the ale was obvious in the nose, but didn't have quite the same warming effect in the mouth as North Coast Old Stock, tasted earlier in the evening. There had been some maturation of the flavors with age. The bitterness and floral flavors from the edgy hops still stood out from the malt, but melded into something almost reminiscent of an India Pale Ale with a kick."
"Maybe it shouldnt be aged... but thanks to aracauna for the bottle."
"thanks to kbub6f"
"Got this behemoth thanks to a trade. 2002 Bottle: Pours a murky orange color with a thin off-white head that disappeared rather quickly. Strong alcohol and malt in the nose. Flavor packs a real punch, especially as it warms. Fruity alcohol flavor with a decent malt balance. As strong as this beer tastes, I still think it is balanced quite well. I bet the cask-conditioned version of this beer rocks."
"Cloudy yellow-brown with lots of suspended sediment. Head is fairly large, off-white and perhaps an inch thick; several minutes after pouring at least a quarter of an inch remains with quite prominent thick lace. The aroma is utterly dominated by the strong alcohol, strong bitter grapefruit hops notes are also present, along with fruity esters. Taste yields sweet malt flavors, fruit flavors (pears?), quite rough alcohol notes and bitter grapefruit hops which linger on long past the end of the taste. This particular sample has been cellared for about six months; so it seems that if it is to mellow, some greater inverval of time will be required. Still, as a Texan, I have to admire the fact that a Texas brewery has taken up the challenge of producing a barleywine ale."
"Cloudy medium brown with a moderate head. Fades to a nice weather patten. I'm not seeing the presence of alcohol in the aroma like has been mentioned by others. A seet malt dominates the nose along with somethign like strawberries past their prime and maybe a slight bit of banana. The alcohol kicks in a bit in the flavor and seems unbalanced at first combined with the bitter grapefruit peel hops but fades into the malt further into the glass. The alcohol is only truly noticed by the mild burn as it travels to the stomach. The mouthfeel is actually a bit soft and with the alcoholic warmth make this a comforting beer, great for relaxing. The only real drawback is the malt is slightly unbalanced by the bitterness of the alcohol and hops. I'm glad that I have two bottles so that I can see how this turns out in a year or two."
