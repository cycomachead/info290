"Extremely light mouth feel. Tastes of cheap bourbon"

"O: I was expecting more from this beer, but it has a rye spice hop bitterness flavor that I don't typically get in a barley wine. Maybe it's from the rye barrels and the addition of four hops and the dry hopping. It's not bad but there are better barley wines out there, even non BA barley wines, it's complex but it is not smooth and easy drinking."

"Loved the scent more than the taste but it is a solid beer that I was glad to try.  Most likely will not go out of my way to buy again."

"Draft @ Ale Arsenal.  Pours a dark amber to brown in color with virtually no head.  Aroma is mostly bourbon and oak with some caramel and dark fruits.  Palate of caramel, brown sugar, bourbon and oak with a hint of vanilla and rye.  Fairly solid barrel-aged barley wine, although not nearly the best I've tasted."
"Bottle. Pours a clear, brown color with some ruby hints. Thin, tan, foamy head. Aroma is very sweet. Lots of barrel character which acts as a counter punch to the thick, syrupy sweetness. Caramel, oak, toffee and sweet candy. Also smells very alcoholic and hot. The flavor is more of the same. Oaked caramel, vanilla and toasted sugar. High octane. Hot and sweet. Softer carbonation. Body is full and chewy. Not sure if this one has enough complexity to forgive the hot sweetness. It's pretty good but a bottle shared by multiple mouths was the way to go here."

"Nose: rye spice, some clean smelling herbs, a hint of citrus, vanilla and bourbon and a hint of smoke. Pours deep chestnut with a slight haze under a 1” slowly dissipating tan cap. Very rich lace. On the palate it is big rich and creamy with vanilla, malt sweetness, big bourbon flavors and a pleasant alcohol warming on the finish. Despite the big alcohol, the beer is incredibly smooth finishing with a bitterness that suggests a dash of Peychaud’s Aromatic Cocktail bitters in a glass of bourbon and soda with some simple syrup on ice – except the beer boasts much finer softer carbonation, a chewier body, deeper complexity and a much better balance."

"overall: Smooth, very drinkable."
"Overall. Very nice barleywine. Didn't notice the abv until after I opened it, shall be an interesting evening!"

"Overall tasty.  Not as good as Sucaba.  Wouldn't buy it again for the price."

"Overall, a great beer. If I'm being honest, I have a bit of a soft spot for BA barleywines as well as rye whiskey barrels, so the only way I wasn't going to like this one was if it was pretty bad. As my first opportunity trying a beer from Hangar 24, I'm certainly curious to try more, should they present themselves to me."

"O- Decent example of the style; it is certainly a very sweet and boozy barleywine but it seems like such a chore to drink in comparison to the better rated barrel-aged barleywines out there. I'd suppose I'd say it's fairly messy and not particularly well-executed."
""
""

"O: Huh, not sure how to score this one. I swear it's got signs of oxidation but only in the middle and lingering between sips. It's either oxidation or some sort of unfamiliar hop flavor is all I can think. I checked through the reviews and there were several mentions of oxidation so either other people are also getting tricked or there's some sort of odd off (or intended) flavor in this. It's really not that bad but the off flavors really stood out for me. They just really clash with the typical barrel-aged barleywine flavors (smooth, sweet, malty)"
""
""

"Overall though there is some real interesting notes and character here. No complaints."
"An outstanding barrel aged barleywine with it's deep, rich flavors and full body. I've been thouroughly impressed with the couple of Hangar 24's Barrel Roll series that I've been fortunate enough to receive. Quality stuff that deserves a try."
"Edit: Blue cheese cuts the sweetness dramatically, if that's not your cup of tea."

"O: Few flaws pull down this magnificent beer. Definitely recommended if you like barrel aged barleywines."
""
"Deep, darker amber color with a small cap of creamy off-white head that laced the glass nicely. Aroma was bourbony and barleywiney, sweet with caramel malts, some notes of spice and candied fruits. Lots of dark malty sugars in the taste--toffee, caramel, etc.--big bourbon, notes of oak, toasted coconut and vanilla, some earthy and resinous hop bitterness coming in mid- to end-palate. On the fuller side of medium-bodied, sweet and boozy and a little messy, but could mellow out with more age. Good overall."

"O: Very good. I would compare this Blighs Dry Dock anyday."

"Full bodied with a strong barrel character and plenty of spicy booze but it's nicely integrated into the barleywine flavors.  Strong dry oak presence with lots of brandy, spicy bourbon, vanilla and toasted coconut followed by leathery malt, caramel sweetness, alcohol and vinous dark fruit, notably date, fig and plum.  Really well balanced with excellent barrel integration.  Complex and flavorful yet very easy to drink considering the high abv.  Slight heat and warmth in the finish without being harsh.  Plenty of delicious spirit without becoming overwhelmingly boozy or overpowering.  Excellent!"

"O - I'd buy again and should have bought two so I could put one down. This is a pretty good beer that some thought went into."

"Overall very nice offering. Would definitely age well, but this is enjoyable fresh."

"O: It seems many aren't a fan of this particular brew, but I thought it was really interesting. Mouthfeel was superb, and it was spicy as hell - something I wasn't expecting. The zing of the rye whiskey barrels took the forefront, and was boosted even more by a slightly fruity yet bitter hop character, but subtle notes of bourbon, dark fruits, vanilla, and a touch of caramel allowed this beer to remain amazingly interesting. I would have liked more from the nose, but the taste was unique and it was a delight to drink. No doubt a massive alcohol heat to it, and I am sure it will do well after a few years in the cellar, but I don't mind huge beers with a nice heat to them, and so this one was nothing but a pleasure to sip on. Great nightcap after one too many cups of coffee studying for midterms."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is actually very pleasant, aside from the highly alcoholic finish. Right at medium bodied with high carbonation and very smooth drinking. Overall, I went from really disliking this beer, to warming up to it after a bit, to dislike again. Too much alcohol, and the citrus hops were not complemented well by the barrel."

"O - A hopped up carmel heavy and stronge bourbon BW."
"O: I've heard there's some bottle variation with Hangar 24 so I'm hoping that's the case here. I'd like to revisit in the near future."

"O- just a ok BA Barleywine. I don't know why brewers dry hop BA beers. It doesn't work well with the barrel aging, stop it!"

"My first taste of Hangar 15 & though this didn't live up to the Henry-esque nose, it's very good. Odd, but very good."

"Pours a murky dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, fruit, wood, and bourbon. Taste is much the same with a woody finish and a bourbon kick with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but I think this one smells better."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. I enjoyed the heavy-handed hopping on this one, and the blend of rye and bourbon barrel aging was a nice touch as well."
"Very enjoyable."

"Middle to the road BA barleywine. Glad I tried it, would have again but wouldnt seek out. Thanks SupeonaDeuces!"
""
"o - overall solid BA barleywine. nothing earth shattering but pretty smooth for such a big beer. this one could use some mellowing out still though."
""
""
""
"Not my favorite, but there is potential. Fresh it is a bit unrefined and flavors don't meld quite as much as I'd like, BUT if the spice fade, the booze integrates a bit better and the rich toffee and caramel come out a bit more with age which are all things I could see happening with this, it'll be good down the line so hold onto these for a bit longer. Enjoyable now, but I could see this being much better in six months."
""
"Almost mahogany in color with minimal head. The nose is somewhat boozy. Lots of bourbon, wood, and vanilla, but good caramel and toffee, too. Quite a bit of brown sugar, as well. The flavor is sweet and boozy, as expected. A nice dark fruit aroma, brown sugar, toffee, and caramel. Good barrel charter of bourbon and vanilla, not that much wood, though."
""
""
"O: Enjoyable, but I think a 6 oz. serving was plenty. This needs 2-3 years of aging for sure. Don't open until 2015."
"O: it was pretty good all around and was way better than the bottled version."

"O - This is a very interesting take on the style, as the rye barrels presumably are what create many of the spiciness coming through. There is a little bit of the flavor that I find to be a little light from the body, but it really is a very good beer. The spicy fruit notes are very unique."
"This beer pours a dirty dark amber in color with a one finger off white head. The nose is very interesting. It features bourbon and spicy whiskey aka the rye but it has a lot of red fruit to it, namely slight cherry and a whole lot of grape. It's actually pretty vinous. The flavors are very sweet and a little aggressive. I get a lot of red wine notes paired with toffee, oak, grape, and vanilla. It's a little harsh and the alcohol is definitely present. It has a distinct grape character. Overall its not bad, just not spectacular. It drinks a little boozy and coats your palate, as it should. Overall this is decent, and worth a try but I.wouldn't seek it out."

"Overall, I like this beer. It's a solid BA barleywine. I made the mistake of pouring it into a Kuhnhenn tulip, though... this smells something like Kuhnhenn's Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia, but just can't live up to the comparison. Still good, though."
""

"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is definitely that of a barrel-aged beer. I get a lot of bourbon and whiskey notes, as well as some toffee, caramel, brown sugar and molasses. The flavor is also very nice. I get some pine from the hops, as well as some brown sugar, molasses, caramel malt and whiskey. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice."
""
""
""
"In a word: disappointing."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being a little on the high side. Overall, it was a pretty solid beer but not quite great. The bitter, resiny, American hop profile was a little strong and the bourbon barrel a little light. Pretty good overall though."
""
""
""
"Overall: I expected a pretty good beer when I heard about this because I enjoyed the other beers in this series. I'm relieved I didn't buy a bottle of this. I don't know if it was this particular bottle or the beer in general, but this was terrible. Everyone dumped it out."

"O: I really enjoyed this BA Barleywine. This was a first from Hangar 24 and I wasnt disappointed."

"o- sipped this badboy on a cold night in San Diego. perfect for warming up your tongue. tastes like they were able to leech out some of that devil's cut in those rye whiskey barrels. brilliant and tasty beer."
"D - Not a session, but so tasty."
""
"05/18/2013 Update: Had the 2013 version (12.4%) on tap at California Kebab's first anniversary. Boozy and alcoholic with a serious whiskey taste. There is a dry sensation that is closer to a Belgian style. A bitter edge takes the sweetness down. So boozy it's like a dry liqueur."
