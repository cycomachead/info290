"O: Wonderful beer.  So glad I finally got to try it.  Easily in the top handful of American Barleywines I have ever had.  Thanks again Paul for hooking me up!  4.5"

"2014, with orange wax, bottle 1226 of 1696."

"Was excited to try this for a while, it did not perform. Taste and smell very offensive to me and highly barrel forward. Could not finish mine."

"Yellowish amber body with a thin cap. Aromas of oak, bourbon, vanilla, malt. Some sweet fruity notes. More complex and drinkable than the standard version, with barrel aging characteristics cutting some of the alcoholic fruity ester sweetness. Caramel malt lingers. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Pretty good."

"Bottle from trade. 2013 batch numbered 143/1696. Pours murky light brownish amber with a creamy off white and yellowish head. Aroma of lemon peel, caramel, oak, vanilla. Flavor follows with lots of lemon hops, caramel and big brown sugar, lots of oak, light vanilla and bourbon. Heavy bodied with medium carbonation and some nice warmth on the back wen with the oak balancing the sweet nicely. Enjoyed this much more than the regular version."

"It is a solid BA barleywine, but doesn't come together as well as I'd hoped.  The hops faded considerably, but in the end they do not work very well with the barrel."

"OVERALL: This is pretty good. Quite oak heavy, but that's not a bad thing. The feel is a bit under par, as are many in the style, but the flavor is well balanced and barrel aging well executed. This is actually more barleywine than their regular Behemoth is. Quality and worth checking out if you get the chance. Cheers totoropanda!"

"O - Very tasty and nice, no bite, drinks very easily."

"Slightly hazy dark amber bordering on brown color with a decent sized off white head that quickly dissipates to a ring on the top. Huge aromas of caramel and brown sugar soaked bourbon, with bits of dark fruit like cherries plums raisins and figs. The flavor is sweet but packs a lots of bourbon and alcohol to counter. Brown sugar and caramel with a solid bit of bourbon and hints of vanilla, oak, and dark fruits. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation, and a sweet almost syrupy sharp alcoholic mouthfeel. This beer smells fantastic, and tastes pretty good too, although at 12.5% it does have some rough alcohol edges. I enjoyed sipping on this for most of the night and wish I could spend more nights doing the same thing again."
"Pour is cloudy dark burgundy brown with a small amount of light tan head. Lots of bourbon even from a distance. The nose is huge, tons of bourbon, dark malts, caramel, brown sugar, dried figs. Taste is also huge, lots of malt sweetness, not really sugary. Tons of dark fruits with hints of apple, lots of brown sugar and caramel. Bourbon plays in nicely, less prevalent than the nose would have had me believe. Very full body, a hint sugary, soft palate but gets a touch grainy."

"A relatively light body for a beer of this ABV and barrel aged."

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but pretty boozy and hot."

"D - Significantly better than regular Behemoth. Much like regular Dark Lord, it's bizarre how this transforms inside a barrel."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A bit of a disappointment here. I mean, the beer is good but absolutely not worth the price I paid for it. I actually happen to have another one. Hopefully it will be better than this one."

"O: Not exactly sure why this ""world class", hyped or priced at $30+ or so. This beer reminded me of BA Ruffuan and BA Bigfoot, old spent bourbon barrels killing a fantastic base beer. I'm so happy I was able to tick this but so disappointed at the same time."
""
""
"O- very good BA Barleywine. Fairly sweet with some nice dark fruit notes, bourbon takes a back seat to the base beer."

"Very good brew. Very different than the base brew but still a very delicious with great sweetness and Bourbon notes, great caramel and molasses notes with an awesome blend between the sweetness and the hops. (4.5)"

"Overall: This grew on me quite a bit over the course of my glass. Really interesting stuff."
""
""
"Thanks to lansmen for the bottles!"
"Cost: $30 for a 750 ml bottle."
""
"O: Incredibly smooth and delicious with the alcohol completely hidden. Great balance in the flavors and this will only get better. It'll be nice to try this in a year or two when the hops fade and the maltier side starts to shine."

"O- Really liked this and was surprised how different it was from the regular behemoth. Some tartness and barrel aging made this quite a tasty and complex beer."
"D - I finished this faster than the other two, lower alcohol, beers. I wish this popped up more often, as I think it's one of Three Floyds' strongest offerings - much more enjoyable than Barrel Aged Dark Lord in my book. I can easily see this causing an equivalent hangover to Abacus."
"Pours a very hazy brownish orange. Not a pretty pour but a nice touch of yellowish head. Smells hoppy and bourbon heavy. Tons of big malt presence on the nose. Tastes sweet and malty. The bourbon melds well with the malt profile. The hops are fairly subtle on the tonue but smooth and very drinkable"
"o - Overall I thought this was a nice improvement on an already great beer. I've had some bourbon barrel aged beers where the base beer was superior (like BA Blackout vs. normal Blackout in my opinion), but in this case the bourbon barrel aging did wonders for the base beer. Would love to have this one again sometime."
"Drinkability:This is an amazing transformation of the Behemoth to a barrel aged beer. Tons of complexity, and very delicious."
"A great brew probally worth making the hour drive, and then waiting an hour outside before getting in, for a chance to try it, might not a second time though. Made some new friends while there too."
"Drinkability: One and done, definitely. I like barrel aged beers as much or more than the next guy, but this was just too much bourbon for me. It definitely brought down an otherwise good beer."
"Finding this was still on-tap was the major victory of the Three Floyds Brewpub Experience today. It pours a murky burnt sienna topped tonsure-style by a ring of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises bourbon, a healthy amount of maple syrup, vanilla, oak, molasses, and caramel. The taste does not deviate very far from this plan, though the maple syrup and molasses are decidedly diminished, and some light clove and nutmeg notes find their way into the mix. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a kinda chewy feel. Overall, I was a bit disappointed that the base barleywine was so o'ershadowed by the barrel-aging, but the end product here remains pretty dern good regardless."
"As soon as I found this beer was still on tap I decided that it must be mine. This was served a murky looking brown with not much head on it, which may not be too appetizing until you realized it sat in an oak bourbon barrel for a long time. At that point it looks pretty tasty. The smell was unbelievably good. There was apparent the aromas most found in bourbon whiskey. There was hints of oak and vanilla along with the bourbon itself. The flavors while created on a backbone of heavy malts (the hops had long since died) was actually quite bourbon like in flavor. There was a twinge of the dank oak along with a peat smoked malt flavor that gave it a rather interesting harshness, that was by all means not bad. This beer had a hard time trying to figure out if it wanted to be a good whiskey or a barleywine. It was both and neither at the same time."
"Drinkability -- Of the handful of barrel-aged FFF beers, this is by far the best. While the others were so hot and boozy that the base beer was totally overwhelmed, the mellow bourbon really elevates Behemoth and gives it a new character. Total win."
"D: very complex sipper. A must try for barrel aged or barleywine fans."
"D: Delicious. This is to barrel-aged barleywines what BCBCS is to barrel-aged stouts: a gourmet candy bar soaked in bourbon. No heat to be found but it is mildly warming."
"D - Very nice drink - one of my favorites at the event. Vanilla, oak, peat like - reminded me somewhat of all the flavors I like in a scotch, but in a very smooth drinking beer. Very much enjoyed this one..."
"D: very nicely done barrel aged brew that was not over done but was definitely a sipper."
"Overall: A nice and aggressive barrel aged American Barleywine. A little like Alpine's Great with more hops and less toffee."
"D- Even though it is 11%, i can drink these all night. As a matter of fact, i drank this until the keg was gone. I officially had the last glass. WOW. I cant wait until next year when it comes out again. Keg was gone in less then 1 day."
"D: Very good stuff. The flavor of the oak is a little much to drink a lot of this, but that just encourages slow sipping. Solid beer all around. Hope to have this one again."
"Amazing Beer!!!"
"Darn good beer, though not quite up to the DL status."
"D- Wow this is a great beer. I really enjoyed this one. A sipper for sure."
"Tastes like it smells. SMOOTH. Lots of whiskey, lots of hops, goes down like silk. Nothing harsh or syrupy, no burny alcohol. Just goodness."
"Pours light burgundy, a little cloudy. A decent, airy head forms and holds for a bit. Not a ton of lacing because of the high alcohol but the hops stick just a bit. Aroma is out of this world. Lots of fruits. Ruby Red Grapefruit is the frontrunner with plenty of other aged citrusy fruits to back it up. The bourbon barrel just did absolute wonders for the taste and aroma. The barrel is a touch more present in the aroma but it's still perfect in the taste. Hops are still pretty big in the taste but nicely rounded out with the age. Sweet but not cloying. The alcohol is heavenly. The fruity esters are perfect. Body is about full with just enough carbonation. A pure sipper at its finest."
"This was a memorable brew. On tap during Jan '09 at the BrewPub. Aged in (from FFFs management) Woodford Reserve Bourbon Barrels, this was unlike anything I've ever had before. Still the citrus and bitterness of Behemoth, very ""in-your-face"" but included a sweetness/sugary taste of bourbon...easy to detect! I could drink this beer until I pass out (which wouldn't take much with the ABV). One of my favs."
"From the Three Floyds Brew pub and WOW. Huge brew with alot different aromas on the nose but the biggest would have to be the bourbon. Super smooth mouth feel and hits the plate with a burst of sugars and hints of plum and citrus. One of a kind beer from a one of kind place. Thank you munster IN."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth with a small amount of carbonation."
"On tap at DLD '08. A syrupy pour of muddy amber/brown with almost no head or lace. The aroma was sugary carmel and bourbon. The flavor was almost that of melted caramel with tinges of bourbon seeping through. Very nice! The mouthfeel was lush and thick with minimal carbonation. Although my rating for this and the regular Behemoth are the same, these are two vastly different beers. Not anywhere near as hoppy as it is fresh, this brew has taken on a much sweeter, English barleywine character. I love it!"
"D - This was one insanely good beer and it was so easy to drink. In terms of taste, while it and Oak Aged DL are both 5's, I thought this one was even better than OA DL. If possible, I would give it a 6. Wish it had a bit of a bigger nose but oh well. Loved this so much more than the fresh Behemoth I had on tap and this experience inspired me to buy some Behemoth to cellar to see if the flavors will meld together as well in the bottle as they did after a year in the barrel. Try this if you get the chance as you will not be disappointed at all."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Very glad I had the chance to drink this."
"Mouth is a little thin otherwise very good and the type of beer I could sip daily."
"I had this on tap at FFF. It was very dark with almost no carbonation. The smell was heavy on the vanilla and alcohol, with some caramel. The taste is more of the same, very heavy vanilla and caramel, the alcohol was hidden nicely. The mouthfeel is slick and heavy, but it is so tasty it is very drinkable. In the same session I had a Surly Klaus and I thought the chocolate flavors from the porter were a much better mix with the burbon barrel aging."
"D: There is no way i could drink more than one snifter of this stuff."
"D: Surprisingly very drinkable considering the high abv. Maybe a tad too bourbony but very enjoyable none the less."
