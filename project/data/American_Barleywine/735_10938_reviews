"Well I remember this one, and I remember not being a big fan. Not incredibly well balanced, bitterness that didn't correspond with the nose of a hop characteristic that left an odd cloying sweet bitterness behind with a little rubbing alcohol. Just not much I could enjoy with this one."
"Nice barley wine alittle too much citrus and pineapple for me.  Overall average at best."

"I've got to say I love these cans. They're the perfect serving size for the style. Great for camping. This is very hot fresh and cellaring in cans isn't practical."

"O:  Very tasty.  This was expensive treat, but I did enjoy it.  A solid release, but not one of the best barleywines I have tasted."
""
""
"A solid sit by the fireplace and watch the snow fall beer."
"Overall:  This is a brilliant, fantastic barleywine!  I can’t wait to see what it is like with some more age on it.  Barleywine fans should really like this!"

"This poured a hazed honey orange with golden hues and a honey brown tint. Lovely with a fat enough head of tan foam that fell off and left a film on top. Noe i hops. Bright grapefruit and some  leafy herbal. A big malt  with brown sugar and honey and soft bread. The taste is sumptuous. It's sweet but not cloying. It has grapefruit that is tart and pithy and has the peel. The hops are leafy and wide. The soft bread and brown sugar all come together for a malt that is sweet and delectable with a bit of sitckiness to it. Earthiness gives way in this to a firm herbal and a bit of alcohol that grazes the back palate. The finish is dry and there is an ample bitter to leave you with a bit of resiny coating on the mouth and time to taste all those tremendous flavors again while a bit of spice lingers at the back palate."

"Great packaging, like what the English would call a ""nip."" From the 8.4 oz can purchased in the four-pack purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle."

"From a tiny little can, this barley wine is a hazy chestnut color with a thin head. It is very dry, with a lot of citrusy and resiny hops. Perfume, fruit (ripe prach and orange) alcoholic scents dominate the beer. The taste has malt and sugar flavors. Heavy bitterness. Full and rich mouthfeel."

"Pours a thick cloudy amber with a thick 1"" white head that dies down to light foam with a clinging foam lacing on the glass. Smell of hops and caramel, dates, plums, and dark fruit, and spicy hop notes. Taste is caramel malts up front, mild bittering hops on the middle and back with the caramel, brown sugar, and a dash of cinnamon toast. Great mouthfeel, richly carbonated and buttery, thus making for a decadent barley wine. Reminds me somewhat of a more caramel version Sierra Nevada's Big Foot. Very VERY nice."

"Boom, indeed. Forget the little cute can it comes in, this one hits full on from the get-go with alcohol burn. Aroma and taste give away to high ABV, faint malt backbone lies somewhere in the mix, but an overall smooth and slightly sweet experience. Nice!"

"Overall an enjoyable beer. Not sure what's up with the whacky can size, would have enjoyed a 12 oz, but..."
""
""
""
"O: Wow, 8.4 oz is an absolute perfect size for this beer. I mean, 'cause it's so boozy and hard to drink. I don't know how well this would age - it seems like I'll have to give it another chance fresh (and that's a shame, because even the hoppiest 'Murican-style barleywine can age well...) Right now, it's not horrible, just hard work."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely worth a try!"
""
""

"Less complex than hoped for a style begging for complexity."

"O- Not an awesome barleywine, but one that delivers what it's supposed to."
""
""
""
"O- will buy more esp. At a low price of $5 a 4 pk"
""
""
"O - It's good. The more you drink it the more you like it. I'm actually more familiar with aged barleywines so this was hard to rate at first."
""
"tiny little unassuming cans can sometimes kick your butt, and this is definitely one of those. unsuspecting all the way, its simple in nose, moderately hopped with a molasses undertone, but smelling not an eyelash above 7.5%, never letting on to its real magnitude. the head too, im not used to such big ones in barleywines, so im fooled by this. some lightness to the color, and enough bubbles to cut the viscosity, its just hard to identify as a super strong ale. flavor is balanced between thick and sweet barley somewhere in the middle of the roast spectrum, and hops, which have a citrusy flavor, but not enough acid or bitterness to rise above the grain. lovely stuff, one can is plenty and im glad its not bigger, but a really solid as well as interesting take on barleywine. constantly evolving arent they?"
""
""
"The booze is a bit more notable in the taste but overall it is still a bold barley and sweet character with little in the way of hop bitterness. These 8 oz cans seem to be pointless though."
"O - great take on a barleywine. this definatly stands out to me. i love the west coast hop take on a malt bomb style. the booze is definatly present. i wonder how it would age in the can? im gonna hang on to a few to see how that goes. will definatly buy again!!!...cheers!!!"
"O - Quite hop-forward and somewhat unbalanced for a barleywine. The components of the nose don't really compliment each other, but instead present a hodge-podge that begs to be sorted out. I like to enjoy the nose of a big beer apart from its taste, but I really couldn't do that with this beer - too much conflict. This isn't a barley wine I could recommend unless someone is specifically looking for a pretty bitter IIPA / barleywine mash-up."
""
""

"o - solid american barleywine with a good hop profile. i enjoyed it and i liked the slim can for a beer with an ABV this big."
""

"Big thanks to Beer Geeks at CBC Braintree for the recommendation. I have only had one or two barley wines before this so I not too familiar with the style. This beer is great. I don't know if this is a true rep of the style but this is great beer. Good balance between malts and hops and really drinkable."
""
""
"Could have warmed a bit. As I drank it some of the grainy flavors were more present and the hop flavors were also more accentuated."
"I get a malty sweetness balanced by a slight bitterness and some orange notes. Candied sweet, with a long finish. Solid, if not spectacular."
""
"Final Thoughts: So not quite the big beer that I was expecting due to the less-than-robust taste and tepid feel but still a good beer. Would I drink it again? If I'm in the mood for a barleywine."

"sweet fruit, furniture cleaner, caramels, butterscotch candies. The flavor is ok. Some metallic notes. Noticeable alcohol throughout. A bold beer. A bit aggressive and slightly harsh on the palate. Not as bad as I made it sound. Middle of the road."

"Overall: Nice American barleywine. Big citrus notes, pretty big alcohol presence. I'm interested to see how both will mellow as it ages."

"Overall: This is how American barleywine should be. Big, lots of barley, bitter hops, and some boozy tingle. Reminds me a lot of Old Guardian from Stone which is a personal favorite of mine. Highly recommended!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely an America-style barelywine (in my experience akin to a double IPA, but with a higher ABV). It's hoppy, tropical in taste and smell, has a pretty good mouthfeel, and it's delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Not really a big fan of this barleywine. The feel was a bit off and while a barleywine is expected to be on the boozey side, this one had a bit too much of a astringent and hot boozy flavors to be very enjoyable. Not one I will go to again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- some nice sweet malty notes have begin to kick in but other than that, this ones pretty average. The booze is not hidden at all and actually burns going down at times"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'll have to salt away a can or two for an aged sampling, but these are pretty decent as is. That said, the abv is not hidden at all and belies a potent little kicker of a can."
""
""
"Overall: It's good considering of what it is, I personally after spending a chunk of money here can think of better choices. It's still worth your time...split the four pack with a friend. Salud!"
""
"Not a great barleywine, but not undrinkable."
"O - Appearance and aroma had me filled with high hopes. Even the first sip showed good promise. Half way thru the first sip, things changed a bit. The hops took on a medicinal quality in its bitterness that took away many of the fine points in the flavor of this beer. The medicine-y nature continued through the swallow and lingered long on each sip. I love a good and hoppy barleywine and I thought this had lots of promise. Overall, not bad - but had much more potential. I could drink this again, but probably won't...just doesn't live up to other easily obtainable hoppy American barleywines."
"The booze hits first. Not a burn but an immediate warmth and presence. Hopes are strong like they were in the smell but the malt is really there in force as well. Some dark candied sweetness, some tart flavors too. Slightly sour grape or dates? Feels like one big blanket at first before individual parts come out to identify. Seems to go down very easily for me. Feels rich but not super thick. Smooth overall. Hop bitterness shows but the malt and body really keep it down on the whole. Slight chocolate note in the aftertaste, not really sweet though. Some earthiness to it. Grainy. The tart fruit really comes out if you hold this one for a bit. A nice sipper. Don’t feel the ABV too strongly to this point. Seems like this could be a big malty IPA aged on oak or something similar without that flavor being dominant. Would be interested to find a food pairing for this. Could make for good after dinner sharing as well. Really like the flavor as this has warmed in the glass. I didn’t quite know how this one would go but it definitely did appeal to me. 21A did a nice turn here."
""
"TOTAL = 34/50"
"Overall it is OK, not so easy to drink, but not bad either; you can feel and taste the booze but there are enough flavors to make this tolerable. Above average, but just a notch or two."
""
"A decent strong ale with a very high hop flavor. The hops hide basically anything else in the flavor. The alcohol is very noticeable in this one too. Not going to be for everyone, even barleywine fans."
""
"Overall a very solid effort. I haven't had many others from 21st Amendment but I'm pretty happy with this one."
""
"Overall it's ok but missed the mark for me with limited complexity. Too boozy, sticky but hard to distinguish flavor profile"
""
"Medium bodied."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very malty Barleywine with strong alcohol notes, gets better as it warms."
""
"poured into stemware deep golden red, delicate head fades quickly, leaving wet laces. Carmelly malt, berry aroma. thick body, tingly carbonation. Rich maltiness dominates, not too sweet, not too toasty, alchohol slowly builds in the finish. Overall a solid barleywine, would definitely revisit."
""
"O: An enjoyable barleywine overall. Nicely hoppy without being too bitter or sweet. Its body is the weakest aspect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"glad i got to try a can of this one, definitely don't think i would've liked an entire 4pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Maybe not the best b-wine I've tasted but love the citrus dominant flavours. Works very well on this summer evening."
""
"a little hot, although that could be expected for a fresh barleywine, room for improvement in the flavors too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good choice. Would have liked a bit more of an expansive feel but overall i liked it."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a hazy orange amber with a thin off-white head that dissipates into patchy foam and a ring around the glass with light lacing. Mild aroma of orange and tangerine citrus, ethanol and faint sweet malt; almost smells more like a tincture of fruit than an ale. Flavor of citrus hops, orange, faint dark and light stone fruit, mild malt, somewhat astringent finish. Medium bodied. An odd take on the American barleywine style that leans more towards a dry double IPA with less dark fresh and dried fruit than generally encountered in a barleywine. The malt body seems thin for the style and ABV. Alcohol is less dominant in the taste than aroma, but is still strong. The bitter orange flavor, particularly in the finish is intriguing, but I'd like to see some more malt support for the fruit and hops here. Worth a try; I'm going to cellar a few to see what happens over time; it's a bit too hot and unbalanced right now."
"Good barleywine. I like the 8 oz can for an 11.50 abv beer. Nice to drink a fresh, hoppy barleywine without any harsh alcohol accompanyment."

"O: I really enjoyed this one. The boozy flavor may be off-putting for some, but there is great complexity in this beer that should not be overlooked."
"O: Not a bad barleywine. Not a great one either, but, for the price it's still a solid buy."
"Overall: this is an interesting beer, but the alcohol heat and the bit of roughness in the finish impact drinkability for me. Worth a try, though, if you like the style."
"O: Decent Barley wine – needs to age more. I’m thinking they don’t age as well in cans for some reason."
"O - Nose and flavor are too delicate for a barley."
""
"Overall: A solid and enjoyable American style barleywine. Nice combo of sticky sweet and harsh hops...very well balanced. Certainly one I would pick up again if I wanted this style."
""
""
"a very solid barleywine from 21st. 8.4 oz can pored into a tulip. poured a dark reddish brown color with a fingers worth of head. smells of loads of west coast hops. resiny citrus, lemon zest, orange peel. then it shows it's barleywine roots with loads of fig, cherry, raisin, toffee and caramel. mouthfell was medium-heavy with a little bit of booziness. overall a great bw from 21st amendment, although i'd like t see it in regular sized cans. but besides that what is in the can is something i'd definetly buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Def worth a try in my book because it IS unique compared to most barley wines out there. I think this one would improve with about a years worth of cellaring to hopefully mellow out that alcogol bight…but thats just what I feel it'd take to get the beer to where I'd PERSONALLY like it to be. The only issue with that is thee ol hop fade (which may be an oxymoron since that hop presence is something that was mentioned on the packaging as intentional) so some of you hop heads out there will probably ilke this one right where its at off the shelves."
"O: This is a pretty run-of-the-mill American barleywine. Honestly, the style is getting a little boring with so many similar iterations."
"O: Overall malty, good rate of hop ibus, caramelized toasted grains. The 8.4oz can seems like a perfect serving size, while some breweries that try to overload it into a bomber. A can was $3 which was not factored into my overall review, but something to consider for those looking to try, a worthy buy."
"This is the perfect serving size for an American Barleywine. 21st Amendment makes great beers and this one is a testament to their creative packaging by placing it in an 8.4 ounce can. Nice appearance and inviting nose. Great taste with a little kick, so enjoy two if you're up for it!"
"D: This was an ok brew, but the scent and taste weren't that great. The body was good, but the finish was harsh, so it wasn't that easy to drink. Not recommended."
""
""
"Very surprised and very impressed with this barleywine. Very drinkable for its abv. While not as complex or smooth as Insanity, it's still quite enjoyable. Lots of floral flavors and hints of spiciness. Fair amount of hopiness. Great look and solid feel. Very glad I tried this."
""
"Overall: Pretty solid beer. Might have to age the 3 other cans from the 4 pack to mellow out the hops."
""
""
"For a pretty fresh, 92 IBU, 11.5% ABV barleywine, this just doesn't really pack much of a punch. Nothing super remarkable about this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It is a good BW, but it comes in a weird can size that only has 4 in the pack. However, it packs quite a punch for its size and a 12 oz. bottle might have been a bit much. I was recommended it by my local shop after I came in asking for something similar to Bigfoot. Its got the hops, but you can already tell it is a BW this early in the maturation, compared to the IPA qualities of Bigfoot early on. I will say it tastes good and goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
"O: This offering didn't really impress me too much. I'm convinced the majority of their offerings are much better on tap at the brewery than out of their cans and this one confirms my theory. This beer left a lot to be desired, not much better than an average barleywine."
""
""
"This may be my new favorite American barleywine, reviews be damned. Old Ruffian's not easy to upseat, but whatever people are missing here is gain for those who know what this beer should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a rather elegant brew. The flavours are strong yet simplistic while remaining interesting."
"Okay barleywine. Holds its own."
""
"o - Very good american barleywine. would have liked more of that classic, melanoidin malt character that one would expect from a barley wine in the flavor. It was also surprisingly lighter in body than I had originally anticipated. However, it's not a deal breaker for me, and I would purchase this beer again."
""
"Mouthfeel is dry but thick. Overall, pretty good. Not great."
"Pours a deep amber burnt orange color with a bit of lacing. Sweet malty aromas with a nice dose of hops. Taste is caramel toffee malts...nicely sweet. Chewey and very easy to drink...a bit dry but overall a nice barleywine."
"O: A nice American barleywine that reveals more malt complexity as the brew warms. The 11.5% ABV packs in a lot of malt flavors, from juicy raisins and dried apricots to toffee-like sweetness. It's not the best example of the style, as it still is a bit boozy and cloying in the finish but it makes for a nice sipper with a moderate hop punch."
"Overall a very overpriced barleywine that only gimmick is canning only 8oz and charging for the full 12. Not the worst barley wine but I have had better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting pouring it from the small can. Enjoyed the sweetness and smoothness. Others might find it to be too sweet and not hoppy enough for an American Bwine."
""
"Purchased at Peekskill Beer and soda, Peekskill, NY, a few days ago"
"O: Well done and especially like the small 8 oz can - don't have to commit to what is often a 22+ oz bottle of very strong beer. Bravo!"
""
"Poured into a pilsner glass, developed a great looking head with good retention and lacing. Appearance was a deep, clear amber / copper color. Aroma was of a light fruit with some malt notes. Tasted malty with hints of fruit anda strong back of alcohol. Mouthfeel was heavy with a lasting, sweet / malty aftertaste."
""
""
""
"O= The thing I like about this beer the most is the can size. It's perfect! The beer itself is nice and smooth. It's not the most over the top barleywine I've had or the most extreme but it does have a nice balance and hides the alcohol very well. This is a nice beer to keep around simply because it's a perfect size for a nice when you want a barleywine but don't wanna cross the line, at least for me but hey I'm a lightweight."
"O: This is high on alcohol, fairly tasty, and easy to drink. It's not something I'll be hunting down much, but I'm glad I tried it."
"A big thanks to woodychandler for this beer. Poured from an 8.4 oz. can. Has a pretty amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is fruity, some hops as well. Taste is big on alcohol, hops, more alcohol, a touch of fruits. Feels medium bodied and very boozy in the mouth and overall, while not terrible, wasn't really to my liking."
"Overall I am not getting much out of this or having a desire to return to it. It's drinkable and perfectly fine, but not my thing compared to other barleywines."
""
""
"O- Not bad a hoped up barley wine, the 11.5% ABV isn't hidden at all but not over the top for the style. I would drink it again if I find this, but I won't seek it out."
""
"Yikes. I wouldn't have guessed that 21st Amendment would make such a hot mess. I think there is potential here but for my tastes, it needs more body, more sweetnees in the back bone and dial back the booze. The hops are nice but they don't make it worth drinking the other 3 before this has spent at least 18 more months in my cellar, hopefully calming down."
""
""
""
""
"O: not a bad barleywine at all. huge flavors and decent complexity with a high ABV that is hidden fairly well. It doesn't really bring anything new to the world of barleywines but it's a solid example of the style. Hops are a bit harsh up front so it could use some age. Not quite as abrasive as fresh Old Guardian though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad but not my favorite barleywine. I can't decide if I like the can size or not - on the one hand, from an etoh consumption standpoint it's great but the beer seemed like it was gone before I could completely appreciate it."
"a pretty easy going BW, not a world beater but not bad in any aspect, a nice little beer worth checking out when you don't need to be bowled over on your ass but want a nice punch of kick and good flavor."
""
"An 8oz can is about all I want in one serving. A sipper that is not really special enough to chose this one over the increasingly crowded shelves."
"Overall: A good Barleywine that doesn't stand out enough, despite the 11.5% abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"8oz can. Deep clear ruby with a ½ finger of frothy off-white head. This retain nicely, with a rich flare-up that leaves back robust spotty lacing. The aroma smells of dark fruit, grains, brown sugar accents, ripe citrus and a slight dankness that lends this a bit of airiness in the nose. The taste is similar, being sweet and fruity up front with notes of toffee, toasted grains, brown sugar, and pithy dark cherry all being present before an assertive hop profile takes hold and leaves this feeling bitter and resinous . A lingering graininess and a sticky combo of fruit and sweetness hang in there as well though after each sip. The feel is full bodied with a chewy creaminess to the carbonation. That 11-12% ABV is present, adding some extra boldness to the flavors but without this becoming stinging or overly taxing on the palate. This was certainly decent for such a big take on a Barleywine, with a definite boldness to the flavor and feel. I’m not quite sure that the balance was quite where it needed to be but its relative smoothness and having to commit to only 8oz made this a pleasant and warming sipper."
""
""
""
""
"Overall meh, seems a little half hearted, lacking much punch on anything except booze, like they forgot half the ingredients. And this was served at pretty much room temp by the time I got to it, so it's not that. A little disappointed for a mini can like that from 21st A."
"Can served in a pint glass. Dark red-amber color, opaque, some lacing around the glass. Not much aroma. Taste is rich, creamy, leathery, caramel malt, and a decent amount of hop bite; nothing too complex however and any sort of taste in the finish is absent. Mouthfeel is nothing special, light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cool little 8 oz can deceptively marketed. Pours a nice brown with a sheet of light tan foam. Smells of malts, some soap, some floral hops and a touch of sugar - nothing special. Flavor is sweet and fruity with lots of esters, hints of bubble gum and banana with a really English yeast flavor. Overly sweet for me. Medium bodied with low carb and a slightly sticky finish. I was hoping this would be really good so I could buy a good bunch for the cellar, but alas, not the truth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a snifter, the beer is a dark, slightly hazed, amber-copper coloring with a thin, filmy ring of head on the surface. Aromas of tropical fruits, heavily ladened with mango and pineapple, with a subtle roasting and some darkly sweet fig in the backbone. Also some citrusy spicing throughout the nose, with orange zest and pepper dancing around the sinuses. Flavors are heavily roasted and rich, with a dark caramel backbone and tobacco highlight. Pepper and tamarind spicing throughout, with a subtle boozey kick to keep your tastebuds going. The tropical fruit becomes a much more blended characteristic on the palate, with a fruit punch feel, but much more concentrated. Resiny characteristics in the aftertaste, adding to the richness. Sharp, boozy kick at the end of the aftertaste, leading to a slick, slightly bitter, tangy lingering finish. Tasty brew."
""
"o: great barelywine for the money. The booze notes on the flavor can be a bit much, and the aroma is my truly my favorite part of this beer. I'm glad they started canning this."
"I like the nice citrus notes the hops impart and the malt is not cloying but it is enough to balance the bitterness and alcohol is not overdone for the 11.5%, Overall I would drink this again it is a good example of the American barleywine style and a half pint is a good sample size unless you would prefer to share."
"Overall - To me, the alcohol was a little overwhelming and it really took control of the flavors and aroma. With some age it would mellow out considerably, i'm sure, but I was hoping for something a little more special from 21st Amendment. This one just falls a little short for me. I have a couple more cans cellaring in the basement and will revisit this one in a year or so, and hopefully get the flavors I was yearning for!"
""
""
"O- Nice hop touch. I had my doubts after the small sample the bartender insisted I tried and I was right but I didn't want to be annoying and turn down the sample and the full pour. I may order this again to give it another go. I just need to develop more of a taste for barleywines. Cheers."
"This is a really well crafted American Barleywine. Really good stuff. Fat beer in a little can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-The 8.4oz can reminds me of energy drinks, almost too much had to stop a friend from making that mistake, apparently he's illiterate. Above average barely wine with a nice story behind the name. Perhaps some aging will mute the booze and bring forth more dark fruits. Another good brew from their insurrection series which I like much more then their regular and seasonal lineup."
"It's got a little bit of that orange cream soda thing going on with bitter orange peel and smooth sweet malt. Not as hot as I thought it would be, there's some mellow vanilla and a slight suggestion of conifer."
"O: A very nice beer and one I’ll glad have with decent frequency. You can’t beat the size, and it’s a worthy sipper. Curious to see if this gets a bit sweeter as it ages."

"Overall eh not a bad barleywine enjoyable sipper to be sure but to be honest hate the little size sure its cute and it gets noticed guess that's what they are going for. If you want me to buy more then this one put it in 12oz cans."
"This is a solid barleywine. Hoppy and boozy. The craftsmanship is definitely there, it just lacks true depth. The 8.4oz cans are an interesting choice. It's actually perfect for a beer of this magnitude, but at the same time it leaves you wanting more. I'm interested how this beer would do with some age on it.."
""
"O: a very respectable barleywine, but perhaps nothing mind-blowing - I do draw enjoyment from the small can and box presentation. A quick, fun barleywine fix for sure. I'd buy it again."
""
""

"Well, the feel on this beer is very nice. Slick and smooth with the minimal carbonation I want to see. Flavor is good, but seems fairly one-dimensional and falls off too soon for me. I'd like to see it linger more really. And I'd like more complexity. But maybe ate would bring that out. Perhaps I shall get more to see what happens with them over time. Either way, excellent example of the style. It will be interesting to see how a barleywine ages in a can."

"Interesting take on the American barleywine style. I'm used to a ton of hop bitterness in this style but this is dank and floral with a surprising amount of citrus and tropical fruit sweetness. There's still some dry, resinous bitterness but hints of grapefruit, papaya and orange peel balance things out. Earthy malt backbone with hints of leather, caramel, toffee and dark fruit notes. Some plum, raisin and date add a vinous character that compliments the sweetness. The high ABV is very well masked with only slight heat, making this strong beer dangerously drinkable. My only complaint, and it's not a minor one, is that the bitterness and tropical fruit sweetness overwhelm the barleywine characteristics. A bit too sweet and in my opinion needs more heat and malt flavor. Otherwise, it's a pretty solid, enjoyable beer."

"Wow that has every aspect of a barley wine you'd expect. This is a massive massive beer in a tiny little can. Big grapefruit hop explosion on the tip of the tongue along sweet malts roll into big pine flavor toffee caramel rum raisins and other dark fruits. Raw herbal hop on the finish with giant underlying bitterness and a lingering sweetness. As expected a bit of a boozey finish as well. Lots of malt, dark sweet fruit flavors with piney and bright hop flavors, all with a boozing as throughout. Lots of good flavors and again every flavor you'd possibly expect from a barley wine but it seems a little young. While the flavors aren't offensive and match each other rather equally, they need a little time to mellow out and find their groove."

"Overall - I Hate the 8.4 oz can size, im not a rookie, i can handle 12 oz just fine. This is a nice beer but rather hot, and nothing special abut this, balance is fine, flavor is fine but its not as complex as a bigfoot or as flavorful. Not bad, would like to try this one with a few years on it. Solid beer, maybe next year release it in 12 oz cans."
"8.4oz can. Canned on: 02/15/13 on the bottom. Pours a reddish, dark brown color with almost no head. Some lacing. The aroma has alot going on. Boozey with some malts, dark cherries, sweet orange and maybe a bit of cough syrup. The taste is malty and boozey followed by cherry cough syrup. A bit woody. Some hop bitterness at the end but not much of the orange I got in the nose. Medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. This is a little more than a month old but isnt overly hot. Interested in seeing how it ages. Overall, hate the 8oz can, really like the beer."

"I will make it a point to get this again and, (since it IS Sunday) again."
"This poured out as a clear copper color. The head was fizzy and white with a light amount of lacing. The smell of the beer is malty with a decent hoppy aroma in there as well. Sweet smelling with some citrus. The taste of the beer is loaded with caramel flavors with a bitter citrus flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit sharp on the carbonation. Overall it's a decent Barley Wine. It's good it might be better with age also."
"This is a rather good beer. It has a huge malt presence as is to be expected and a mild hop character. The alcohol is intense, but not overwhelming. The tropical fruit nose a bit different but intriguing. This is an all around enjoyable beer. It may not be the most complex, but it does come in this adorable little can. I'll definitely have another."

"Caramel, grapefruit, booze and candy start this off. The canning date was a month ago and this beast needs age. Right now it's a wild and obnoxious youth, two, maybe three years from now this will probably be much, much better. Dropped two in the cellar so I will certainly rereview."

"Overall this is a decent barleywine. The fruity/citrus taste was good but not great. Got a little tiresome even from the small can. Worth finding and trying but overall just not my style of BW. I will say the 8.4 oz. was an interesting can. I hope some of the other high alcohol beers take this concept. Plus it's pretty easy to sneak into a sporting event. Just saying."
"overall: I'm probably jaded after Sucaba and now Arctic Devil and MOAS (yeah, I know those are barrel aged). Also just had an ST BackBurner that was very nice. So many great barley's. This is tasty but not great."

"As a barley wine fan this is a good choice amongst some pretty lame American Barleywines. Better flavor than the Bigfoot from Sierra Nevada."

"This is the first beer from 21st that I actually like. The high gravity helps with this style and I believe they hit it on the head with this one. Overall a good drinkable beer and meets the expectations of the style. Looks, tastes and feels like a good Barlywine and I'm not typically a Barlywine or 21st fan. Have one and Probst!!"

"Here's what they say about it: ""Deep, mahogany color, rich malt candied, rock sugar flavors with sweet burnt currant and fig aromas. It’s strong alcohol content is tempered by a clean bitterness and complex flavors. This Barley Wine is named for Cornelius de Boom, the San Francisco Belgian Consulate General (1850 to 1851) and surprisingly the name of the alley along-side the 21st Amendment on 2nd Street."
"On tap at Sessions yesterday.Poured a deep amber with a thinner off white head atop.Alot of brown sugar and caramel malts in the nose,a decent shot of resiny hop lingers.Quite sweet and cake-like on the palate,alot of brown sugar and dark fruit,again there is a decent shot of resiny hops in a lingering finish.It's hybrid to me between an English and American barleywine with its big sweet malty flavors and hoppedup finish,not bad but not overly drinkable."
"O - Decent for the style, 21st Ammendment did a good job with this. Those who enjoy the style should give it a try."

"O - This one became overly sweet for me...this one was even fresh, but it seemed that the hops were ousted by the malt bill...it wouldn't have been bad if there was a little more balance"

"o: Very different but very good."
"Still I appreciated the opportunity to have had this on tap."

"O: This is a good barleywine to sip. The alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"O: Enjoyable but very sweet - glad to sip on this beer but I did not want a very large pour of this one."

"Beer is medium in body and butterscotch jumps off the palate at me, it dominates the midpalate by a lot and it is a little offputting, by the time I finished, I knew I didn't want more. The beer does have a nice finish, mildly dry, mildly sweet throughout. Not a repeat."
"O - Very, very enjoyable barley wine from 21st and I wish I could see how cans stack up to the kegs. Definitely recommended!"
"The body was good, fairly typical for the style, although the beer did have a slightly syrupy finish. Drinkability was pretty good, smooth and easy it went dangerously easy. Overall, a pretyy good, but not great, example of the style. Certainly worth trying when you see it."

"On tap at Toronado barleywine fest ’09. Dark reddish-brown with an off-white head. Aroma is dark fruit, sweet malt, and sugar. Taste is more sweet malt, port-like notes, caramel, and hop bitterness on the finish (it is 95 IBUs after all). Smooth, fairly full palate."
"D- A decent brew but nothing to write home about. I wouldn't repeat."
"On tap at 21A. Chestnut brown in the glass, clear save for a light haze, with a creamy off-white head atop. The nose is a beautiful mélange of toffee malt, fruitcake, tropical fruit, toast, piney hops and a hint of alcohol. Sweetness and esters are pleasantly restrained. The taste doesn't live up to the excellent aroma, exhibiting somewhat harsh solvents alongside flavors of burnt toast, fruitcake, bitter grapefruit peel and pine. Bitter and especally dry for the style, this is an American-style barleywine through-and-through, a style I've never been able to fully embrace. A toasty and rich mid-palate leads way to a solventy, moderately harsh and overly bitter, sappy finish. Not bad, not great. Bigfoot fans may enjoy this."
"Pours deep clear copper with gold edges and persistent thin tan head. The aroma has a decidedly sugar roast malt character with dark fruity esters in the back. I also get a mild chemical alcohol note that is only slightly distracting. The flavor has an initial pulse of lightly roast malts mixing with a sugary sweet maltiness before the dark fruity esters join in. It has a pretty smooth flavor but struggles to hide the alcohol and makes for a bit of a rough finish."
"Tasted at the 2004 Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest. Medium orange color. Medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is orange, malt and sweet. A medium bodied barley wine. Malts are fruity and sweet, touch of orange and citrus. Hops are grapefruity and floral. Nice balance. Slightly bitter. Nice clean finish. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"O: Very good all the way around. Much better than I recall from the Toronado in 2008"
"I had this 10.6% ABV barleywine on tap at the brewery in San Francisco, CA. It had a thick white bubbly head (over an inch thick) on top of a deep red/brown color. Served in a snifter. It was cloudy had lots of lacing. The smell was both sweet and bitter at the same time - sort of like a cider or apple juice, just with more alcohol in the aroma. The taste is of strong bitter hops with a hops and alcohol aftertaste. Hops is the predominant taste though it doesn't come out in the aroma. Later in the aftertaste there is a more complex fruity and apples flavor."
