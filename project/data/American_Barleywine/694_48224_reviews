"A bit strange. It smells so much maltier than it tastes, or does it taste so much hoppier than it smells? Either way, the deliciousness promised by my nose was not met by my tongue. Not entirely. I'm a little disappointed"

"O:  This is a great beer.  Awesome flavors and complexity that would probably fare very well mingling with a bourbon barrel."

"This is one of the best barleywines I've ever had, it's just about perfect."

"Bottle courtesy of @Casey3236. Pours a mostly opaque deep nutty brown, with hints of rich woody red. Creamy tan head that held pretty well before fading into a medium collar and a few wisps. Sticky legs and good lacing. Aroma is molasses, deep earthy malt, woody, some leathery damp soil. Taste is dark caramel, nutti-chocolate with some almond like toastiness, leather and earth. Rich mouthfeel, full bodied and low to medium carbonation. I think I aged this one a bit too long, or maybe not long enough. That dirt-like flavor is a little off putting."

"O: I wasn't expecting to like this after the strong hops scent raced immediately after the pint was opened, but I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. Didn't love it, but would have it again."

"O - The two years of age have done this amazingly well. This is absolutely insanely drinkable. The 9+% ABV is hardly noticeable as I am cruising through this bomber with ease. This is one of the best barleywines on the market. Do yourself a favor and set this one aside for awhile and reap the benefits!"
"O: Another good brew from Troegs. For me it lacks just a touch of complexity but makes up for that in drinkability, dangerously so. This goes down easy so be careful at over 9%."
""
""
""
"Overall- Really like this beer. this is from the 2012 batch, and has aged nicely. Really hoppy when fresh but ages so well. Worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid barleywine that I have enjoyed a lot of over the years."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Maybe a little passed its prime, but really smooth and rich. Fantastic balance and a great beer to sip on. If only this was available in 12oz bottles - 6-packs, I'd fill up my cellar with it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beast is still just a touch clumsy for me, and its alcohol and related organics not knitted tightly enough to its taste elements. But it improves like wine with time on the foundation of good malts and astringent tannins as it should. I'm tempted to get a growler this coming season and hold it for a full year dark in the cold to another level of maturity. And I also can't wait for the reminder of the lively birth of a fresh glass in a couple of months..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great example of the sweeter side of the style."
"I think this one is better fresh, but it's still a great barleywine and a great example of the style. As it ages, it gains the English-style characteristics. The craftsmanship is always there with Troegs. I heard they might've stopped brewing this one, but I'm not positive. So I'd grab one if you see it."
""
""
""
"This was a really good example of a barleywine, and aging it for a year may have changed some of its characteristics but I'm awfully glad I did it."

"O - Taste and mouthfeel are the strong points for sure, no real weaknesses. Very smooth and drinkable with big balanced taste. Very nice"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely on my repeat buy list!"
"O: sweet barleywine with a rich flavor, exotic aroma. Would be great by the fireside and a pipe. This is definitely a beer I would keep in my cellar to share with others. Certainly a good introduction to barleywines."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I really enjoyed this and will seek out more. Not as hoppy as other American Barleywines but this may have been on the shelf for awhile when I rescued it. May update with future samplings. I would say this may somewhat of a bridge between the English and American style..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a great Barleywine for the price, enjoyable sipper"
""
""

""

"overall a solid barleywine, though not really anything too special. good, not great or in a must try category. i prefer my barleywines to be barrel aged and this one definitely isnt, but its still quite good. if youre in the mood for a barelywine this one fits the bill nicely."
"O: 4.50 - this beer is advertised as an American barleywine but, to be honest, this tastes like much more like an English barleywine with mostly malt forward and little hop aroma/flavors; nevertheless, this is an excellent beer with lots of complex malt characters in the nose and mouth that are very pleasant; I want to drink this beer again in the cold Winter months by a fire, which is where it will totally shine"

"I've never had this fresh but this aged bottle tured out to be a great extra. Sweet, smooth caramel goodness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was really excited for this because of the high hop content, which I thought would make it taste like Bigfoot. I would say that it makes for a decent backup BW, but if it only comes in bombers then shoot for something else."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter; Spring 2011 bottling, 2 years old now. Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, apple, toast, light pine, brown sugar, orange rind, brown bread, orange zest, floral, grass, candi sugar, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with a fair amount of hop presence. Taste of caramel, raisin, apple, toast, brown sugar, light orange rind, light pine, brown bread, floral, candi sugar, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, apple, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light pine, floral, candi sugar, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with a fair amount of hop presence; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, fairly slick, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent American Barleywine at 2 years of age. Very nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate hops; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There is a very nice amount of complexity in this beer that makes this one best enjoyed by slowly sipping to appreciate it. The alcohol is pretty well hidden in this beer but it is definitely a strong beer and there is a fair amount of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good. I was surprised at how much I liked this one. It comes together very nicely. I would recommend."
""
"O: This beer is rather drinkable for a barleywine because the alcohol is well masked from the taste. Nonetheless, it's a nice beer to sip and savor given its complex taste."
"A fantastic dessert beer and great for a dinner-ending cheese plate. Buy one to have fresh and one to age. A steal in terms of the bargain domain. Thank you, Troegs."

"Drinks easy for the style & ABV, but not blown away by this one, but I did enjoy it as a nightcap"
""
"Described as ""pushing nugget nectar off a cliff"" I was expecting something a little hoppier. Still great in its own right but definitely not what I was expecting. I think the wheat slightly overpowers the hops but not in a bad way. First smell wasnt the best but considerably better after the pour. Very drinkable but defjnitely one to a sitting given the ABV. Interestingly enough according to the web a mouflan is an iranian sheep.???"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Great for the winter, as the Spring and Summer approach, I can see drinking this full bodied of a beer, but another fantastic beer from Troegs!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good barleywine, not great. One year of cellar time may not be enough."
"D: Agree with others - close to American barleywine flavors. good, but not impressive. No point in opening this without cellar time... ? How long?"
""
""
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation. Feels a bit sticky, and has a sweet aftertaste. There is no alcohol burn, which is one of the main reasons I am glad I held onto this for a few months. I would gladly buy this again if I get another opportunity."
""
""
""
""
"Body is a bit heavy, so you won't likely be swirling more than 24-48 oz down at a sitting."
""
""
"Incredibly drinkable and delicious. I came in without expectations, and I left wanting more Flying Mouflan!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely one of my favorite barleywines, and the age mellowed it a little, which I enjoyed. Excellent!"

""
"O: A good representation of the style, although the time that the bottle sat made it less American because of the diminished hops."
""
""
"D: pretty close to your standard American barleywine flavors/descriptors. good, but similar to most beers in this style guideline, nothing too impressive. this had some time on it and still had some heat, interested to know how long until that flavor fully sizzles out."
""
""
""
"This is a winner. Will try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't usually drink barley wines as they aren't really my style but I enjoyed this one and it was really drinkable for the amount of malt in the taste which would normally turn me off. It could definitely be toned down and have the deeper flavors come out with some age, but an enjoyable experience none the less worth a try if you like barleywines"
""
""
""
"Taste is exactly as thought, a hoppy malt bomb, a decent citrus hop presence hits first but quickly gets pushed aside as the sweet deep caramel malt takes over, the caramel/toffee is huge, still finishes slightly dry and the sweetness of the malt isn't cloying or overly sticky, soft carbonation lends a great creaminess and body to this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A tasty beer although one I'd recommend splitting as it's too overly sweet to take down a whole bottle myself. Even splitting it, 11 oz was more than enough. I've had this at various stages of its life and feel it's definitely best fresh as the sweetness/bitterness are the best ratio then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would definitely have this again and recommend trying it as it was highly drinkable to me for the style, and tasty in general. I’m glad I let this age as it was a lot mellower than I expected, and a very fine slow sipper indeed. I'd like to get a few more bottles to try it fresh and age one for a longer period of time. The alcohol kicks in as I took the last few sips, so look out as this one creeps up on you."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Conclusion: I intended to wait till sometime next year to open this bottle (received in a trade in early 2010). This is the first time I have tried this beer, and seeing as it never makes it out to CO, it may be the last. Well worth the wait, and I am glad I didn't drink it fresh."
""
""
""
"O: Goes down easy, pretty tasty, somewhat filling, big kick, nice representation of style."
""
""
"Easy drinking with food, but also good with conversation."
"O- very good American Barleywine. This isn't a Wow beer but a very good, solid one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting take on the style from what is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. Looking forward to trying this again."
""
"O- I much prefer a englsih barely wine over American. But I bought these with the intent to age for awhile.... this has been laid done for about 8 months and has aged finely... I'm looking toward to the next 4 for many years... great barely wine from a somewhat local brewery...."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""

"O: This is pretty nice - very drinkable and offers a nice balance between some hop notes and the malt/esters."
""
"The bottle pours a deep murky maroon that is nearly candied dark brown. The head is surprisingly large and frothy with a maple-syrup-mixed-into-whipped-cream coloring to it. Lacing from the beer is sticky and web-like over the glass, leaving fat stalactites of foam on my snifter’s walls. The beer smells bitter and sweet, but surprisingly underwhelming, with notes of prickly alcohol and cloyingly sweet candied sugars and caramel assaulting the nose. Brown sugar is also present and enticing, evening out some of the harsher notes of the smell, though it really is a light smell overall. Faint hints of pine and citrus hops can be found, though this is a 2011 bottle of Flying Mouflan, so they have obviously died down a little. Slight bready notes can also be sensed in the edges of the smell, falling away into the sweet alcohol smell. As it warms up the phenol smells grow stronger. The beer tastes big and pleasant. The flavor profile is surprisingly simple, but actually quite tasty. The beer opens as caramelly bready before opening into sweet candied sugars and brown sugar before it transitions into a mixture of slight citrus and the honey-sweet malts. Eventually the beer makes a slow march to harsh aspirin bitters that pepper the tongue in an almost cloying way, though the sweet it not quite too much. Light notes of citrus and pine are also present, but very light. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, as a barleywine should be, moving over the tongue nicely and leaving it sticky but dry while the sides of the mouth wet themselves to try and manage the hoppy bitters. Overall, I think I like the Flying Mouflan. It’s different, and nowhere near as sweet as I was expecting it to be, which I actually like. I would love to try a fresher bottle and see how the juicy hops play with it, but as it stands it was a nice sipper with beautiful notes of brown sugar, though nothing too special. The drawback to this beer was definitely the aspirin bitters that assault the tongue in the close and aftertaste. I’m newer to the barleywine style, so I’m not quite sure how to judge this one on style, but on its own I think it is a nice beer with a little bit of a bitters problem. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to pass up either."
""
"Overall: this beer keeps giving me a little bit when I think it should be giving me more, more, more. It's not bad at all, but it lacks a certain je na sais quoi that I wish I could articulate better. It's definitely worth a try, though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good Barleywine. Pretty simple all around. Probably not something I'll seek out again. Not enough sweetness for me."
"O:  Nice bottle to cellar, but I do have to say I remember liking this better when fresh.  The hop character was obviously stronger and lent itself nicely to the rest of the beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: I love barleywines - both kinds - as well as wee heavies and old ales - and I was really pleased with this beer. Super-complexity, rich flavors, tons of fruit and citrus and deep savory malt flavors and aromas. Bought it blind because I didn't even know it was a barleywine, but just saw the one random bottle on the shelf, and it rang a bell somehow. Thank you, bells in my head."
"O: It isn't perfect, but it's a hoppy barleywine that does a great job of refusing to forsake its malt backbone for hop domination. On a personal note, I'm not terribly fond of the burnt caramel malt backbone, but reviewing it objectively, it still works well with everything else going on. Not what I expected from a barleywine - but exactly what I expected from a revved up Nugget Nectar. In spite of its numerous merits though, I'd take NN over this quite easily. Still a very nice barleywine, though."
""
""
"Poured into an over sized wine glass a rich burnt orange infused bronze with a sticky 1/2 finger off white head,brillinat definition and color.Chocolate and fruity hops with alcohol notes in the nose.Like the bottle says hops dipped in chocolate play a big role on the palate,brown sugar and sweet alcohol round out the palate.A great American style Barleywine with it's big hops and big alcohol,fantastic stuff."
""
""
"A fine example of an American Barleywine. The bitterness was there all along and a great malt bill without too much cloyingly sweet caramel malts makes this very drinkable."
""
"This is one totally rad BW"
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to sip on for a long time."
""
"Overall: A well constructed and tasty barley wine that I always look forward to drinking!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really good Barleywine. Smells wonderful and is so smooth."
""
""
"Overall: Complex, innovative, and very enjoyable. The Troegs brothers have done well again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was really not a fan of this beer. There's no doubt about it, it's a hop-forward (and then some) American barleywine. So, when it comes to the b-wines, if you like'm warming and you like'm potently hoppy, then, go ahead, give it a try. If you are like me and prefer your barleywines less resinous and bitter, look elsewhere."
""
"O- A very nice, drinkable barleywine."
""
""
"This is a real nice barleywine. Good balance. Nice sweet tones with just a touch of noticeable malt presence. The only drawback is a bit of a burn of alcohol. But it really isn't that much. Too often barleywines just aren't there, but this one is nice. I'd go for this any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. One of the better barleywines I've tried. Hoppy, sweet and quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was an amazing Barley Wine and probably surpasses SN Bigfoot by a small margin. Paring the beer with the brisket was probably one element that added to the enjoyable experience. I snagged a 22oz bomber for my cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A nice choice for a slow sipper on a cold day. Best in small quantities."
"Overall: an incredibly drinkable barleywine. One of the best out there for both balance and drinkability. Honesty however this one may actually be more if an English style barleywine even if that wasnt the brewers intention."
""
""
""
"My only complaint is that it is very hard to find this beer. Not many people have heard of it."
"O- Although there is certainly nothing bad about FM, I remember enjoying it more last year. However, that is not to detract from my review, as this is an excellent beer on an absolute scale. Final thoughts: Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to at least one bottle of this seasonal offering."
""
""
""
"Overall, I wouldn't equate it to Nugget Nectar as Troegs suggests. The malt is the main star here. It is thick, chewy, and has plenty of flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Troegs advertises this brew as Nugget Nectar pushed off of a cliff and then rolled in chocolate. The chocolate is there but the hops, though present in strength, are not as complex or as satisfying as Nugget Nectar. Even with the strong hop presence this brew is too sweet; the flavors compete rather than balance each other out. The strong alcohol presence, combined with the hops, does create a warming effect."
""
""
""
"I'm a big fan of barleywines, but this may have just been a tad too sweet/strong for my liking. Medium bodied, decent mouthfeel.. but a cloying sweetness and alcohol heavy aftertaste ruin it a bit for me. Still an above average beer all around, but for a specialty 22 oz beer I'm not sure I'll be coming back to this one."
""
"O - excellent barley wine, a bit too much alcohol and a bit sweet' but quite complex. Very bold, but well designed. The hops in this are a godsend for the barley wines as a style and I'd love to see more breweries emulate this beer."
""
"O - While this one is very good, it is not as good as some of Troegs other offerings. It has a unique malt character with a good pine bite. Alcohol isn't noticeable, but I would have been satisfied with one 11 oz. pour rather than two. Nice value compared to some of the other Barleywines out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy color ale with a rather larger foamy head with good retention and some pretty good lacing. Aroma of piney hops and caramelized malt is really nice. Taste is also a nice mix between some quite strong piney hops with light resin notes and some caramelized malt with light notes of toffee and well balanced residual sugar level. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Pretty solid interpretation of American hops heavy barleywine that I wouldn’t mind revisiting again in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is at an odd aging point, the hops have faded but the sweetness is still too overpowering. Worth a try but get it fresh or age it more."
""
"O: Maybe a little much to drink lots of. 4"
""
"Overall: I am going to pick up a couple more bottles and let them age. This is a nice barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great beer, totally solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer. It's complex, rich, balanced, and smooth. I usually dislike candied sugar notes in my beers but here somehow it works. It folds right in with the dark fruit and caramel. I really enjoyed this sample. Thanks again guys!"
""
""
"O- Very good barleywine, complex flavors and very drinkable."
"On the label they compare it to pushing Nugget Nectar off a cliff. I love Nugget Nectar (honestly more than this really good beer), but I would never turn this bad boy down. Next year I will pick up at least four bottles so that I can do a better job of cellaring."
"(originally reviewed: 06-21-2011)"
"Overall: Fell a little short of what I expected, but still very solid. I have an 11, and 12 aging in the cellar. Looking forward to see what time does for the Flying Mouflan. Good job Troegs, would recommend."
""
""
""
""

""

"This is, so far, the best american barleywine that I have had. It really has the balance that I was always looking for in this style (though my experience is quite limited). I feel it does what a barleywine should, though. Highly recommended."
""
"Certainly one of the best Barleywines I've had recently. More complex and sippable than the common sweet syrupy hop flashes. From the 22 oz bottle bought at the Foodery in Philadelphia."
"Overall – This is a nice tasty brew. It has very nice robust aroma, taste, and warming/creamy feel. It is very satisfying and enjoyable; great for sitting back in a recliner and sipping away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite nice. Worthy of repeated pick-ups. 4"
"O: a very much under appreciated Am Barleywine. It balances so many different flavors. It is a great tasting barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint (think this is the wrong glass), the beer is a dark, cloudy, ruby blood red coloring with a thin, dense, small bubbled, light brown head. Aromas of sweet, layered malts and a citrus hops balance. Malt smells of nut, toffee, and chocolate with an earthy overtone. Smells great. Flavors are roasty toasty initially, with a rich and tangy caramel and toffee backbone highlighted by some resiny, bitter hops. Good, solid lacing left behind as you drink. Very well balanced and very smooth bodied, the beer has a slightly cloying, sweet and bitter balanced aftertaste. The finish is rich and smooth, with a slight linger from the resiny hops. Solid brew...would be interesting to age."
""
""
"Body was the best feature here. About full, a nice creamy carbonation. Just a faint warming. A nice drinking sipper."
""
"Soft on the palate, that was the first texture I noticed. It has a full body, light carbonation, and is incredibly creamy. The creamy head just adds to it. Defiantly a sipping beer, I would buy a case of this next time I see it."
""
""
"Notes: When I tasted it again with 18 months of age on it, the bitterness had mellowed somewhat and if anything, tasted a little better for being more IBU mellow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"the only thing keeping the scores down slightly is the freshness issue. and if this is this years then what happened to the hoppy bitterness?"
""
"O: A nice barleywine, liked the hop presence here. Very drinkable and smooth, no harshness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff, I wish Troegs distributed in my state so I could taste test this every month as it ages"
""
""
"What a nice great the Flying Mouflan is! Been wanting to try this one for awhile, definitely recommended for American barleywine fans."
"I enjoyed this barleywine very much and would recommend it if you like a hoppy kick to yours."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very good, this is still good even at almost a year old."
"Oddly for a barley wine though I dont recommend cellaring it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is brown with some orange hues. The head was white to off-white peachy, leaving behind good lacing. The aroma was rich full citrus hops, tangerines, oranges, grapefruits, full bodied caramel and chocolate too. The flavor followed suite, a really well balanced. The mouthfeel was balanced, full malts, not quite sticky, with a huge hop bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The fruit and caramel beg for a little sweetness, of which this has almost none. But this is a pretty good, malty ale with dark fruit and caramel flavors."
""
""
""
""
"o - very grateful for getting the chance to try this foreign elixir, would love to throw one or two in the cellar some day - straight to my wants!"
"O: I will buy this whenever I see it again. Now I am not afraid to buy the case that is required by PA law. I know there are a bunch of friends in Chicago that will enjoy."
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty nice barleywine and a bit more aggressive than most. I'll age my other and i'm curious to see how it turns out."
"Overall a nicely done barleywine - good flavor and well balanced. I usually prefer these type of beers with a bit more fresh hop flavors (still balanced) but this was quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""

"Out of a bottle this barleywine was a hazy, woody color with lots of foam. The retention was a good and it left bands of lacing. The aroma was full of hops, toffee, booze and figs. The flavors were… a bit much? Maybe it’s just me and I was really surprised but this beer kinda of let me down. Yes, I did taste all the complex notes of figs, citrus, caramel and something akin to hot-crossed-buns but the booze for me was so punchy and the hops so aggressive I just couldn’t get into it. It must be my personal preference. But I like what I like, so screw you. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation medium. I’d still recommend it because I believe people should form their own opinions but I just wasn’t “Wow-ed.”"

"22oz bottle. Pours a dark mahogany color with an inch of light brown head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is boozey with dark fruits, earthiness and some maple syrup. Taste is of burnt brown sugar, dark fruits, booze and maple syrup. Sweet and boozey. Earthy finish. Heavy mouthfeel. A bit too much of the dark fruit and sweet taste but its a decent brew. Im a big fan of barleywines and this one isn't one of the best but worth grabbing. Overall, worth trying."

"O - This has really good drinkability. It goes down easy, and the flavor is awesome. Overall, I think this is a great beer, and an awesome representation of the style. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and hop ratio for an American Barleywine. I definitely recommend checking this one out, it is totally worth it. I will buy this one again."

"After a year in the cellar, silky, sweet and seductive. 9.3% is totally hidden. I don't get the full hop blast either, especially not the pleasant abrasiveness of dry Nugget in Nugget Nectar (no chocolate notes like the brewery says, either.) Overall, a mellow killer."
""
"Medium to full bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is surprisingly drinkable considering the 9.3% ABV. The heaviness of the body really allows the flavors to come out and coats your mouth well without becoming overly sticky. The carbonation is rather fizzy and really helps to keep this beer from being a hot, sticky mess."

"o- an incredibly balanced and straight up delicious barleywine from Troegs, I was shocked at how good it was."
""
""
""
"O - Very nice barleywine, and a nice one from Troegs. Good flavor profile. I would be interested in trying this fresh for comparison, but even after 20 months has a good hop character."

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a pretty dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of dark fruits, a touch of sweetness. Taste is not sweet. alcohol up front, some fruits, more alcohol. Feels light in the mouth and overall I was a bit disappointed with this beer given its high reviews."

"O- I've had this before and will continue having it every year it's released. Truly a beer that defies style characteristics."
""

"Overall - A great barleywine for sure. You should definitely try it if you're in to the style, and if not this is a solid introduction."

"Reddish brown in color with a deep haze. Poured with a big sturdy beige foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet sugary, amber malt aroma. Smooth and thick feel , but not too heavy. Amber and roasted malt flavors up front, ripe dark fruit thru the middle, floral hop bitterness from middle to end with a brief chocolate flavor at the finish. Finishes with a boozy lingering light pine hop after. This is a go too barleywine in PA."

"Mouthfeel is pretty good. Pretty full bodied with a lingering flavor. Sort of an earthy feel the whole way through so it's a little gritty, but there's a moderate carbonation level. Still the 9.3% alcohol level is pretty well masked and this beer is really drinkable. Overall this beer is pretty awesome, full flavored, cellerable, and just tasty. Plus this beer is in the 5$ range so the value is insanely good, always scores bonus points with me when a beer is awesome and financially friendly. Another solid lineup from Troeg's."

"Overall this beer is great, and tastes like it will get better and better with age. If given the chance it will smooth out further and probably decrease the hot alcohols, not that they were a problem with this beer."
"Overall: This is a solid american barleywine. I think that I prefer barleywines with less hops, but the hops from this barleywine add nice degree of complexity without going over the top with the bitterness."
"Overall, a great American Barleywine; it doesn’t outdo itself in the hops, but uses them subtly and masterfully, setting itself apart from others in the style."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 1 inch puffy khaki head that fades to a small cap. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, citrus fruit, and some malt aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, citrus fruit, malt, and some subdued cocoa powder on the aftertaste. A mild hop bitterness sticks to the palate after each sip. This beer has a good carbonation level with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good barleywine with a nice balance of hops and malt."
"Overall, this is a tasty and well made barleywine. It tastes like one that could be enjoyed both fresh and with some years under it's belt."
"Overall: This one solidified my preference for English-style barleywines. While Mouflan is true to style, and is highly-rated, I don't find myself wanting to finish a whole glass of it. Nonetheless, if you like American-style barleywines, please give this one a shot!"
"D - A great beer. I'll definitely have again. I hope to find it in sizes smaller than bombers."
"Deep brown with reddish hues and a whispy head that slowly reduces to off-white swirls. The nose is sweet and fruity with plenty of earthy tones mixed in. The palate covers a wide spectrum of flavors. Sweet dark fruits that compliment the warm boozy elements are met with earthy and piney hops that bring a nice balance to the whole thing. Low carbonation and a velvety mouthfeel fit the style nicely and make it an easy sipper. I loved this brew from the start and it only got better as it warmed toward the end of the bottle. A well conceived barleywine."
"Overall this is really well done. These guys made a real solid barleywine."
"Pours a deep murky brown with no visible light present except around the edges. The brown is like a deep leather there is a thin tan color head which recedes to a skim half and nothiness half. The aroma is of deep piney hops along with dark fruits. The taste starts with a piney and earthy hop bite which gives way to dark fruits and figs, along with a mellow milk chocolate taste. The end has a nice deep burn. The mouthfeel is full bodied. Overall this is a very solid beer, it is a sipper for sure, but very good and very enjoyable."
"O - Definitely love this one. If I had a nickel for every time Troegs let me down, I'd have zero money."
"Overall, a very nice glass. Will very likely age extremely well and can't wait to taste those results ... in a year or so."
"Pours a deep brown, amber. An appetizing 1/2"" slight brown head diminishes after a few sips, nice lacing. Aware of hops as soon as I cracked the bottle; earthy hops, deep malts, some oak in the nose. My first sip made me smile. Malty sweet and hop bitter throughout. Such a full flavor and over so quick! No problem though this only encourages more sipping. Mouthfeel is terrific. Superfine carbonation, if any. Goes over the palate smoothly and pleasantly. Overall this is a great brew, one I will certainly be buying again. The 9.3% is noticeable only on inspection, it is hidden under a rich, full flavor which is hugely drinkable. Love Troegs take on the barleywine, malty and hoppy and bold."
"Overall grade: B+"
"Bottle says that it ages well, and I'm sure that it does. But personally, I'm glad I tried it fresher because the hops were very prevalent still, with malts that still did what they were supposed to do. If you're a hophead, try it fresh or buy two and compare fresh to aged."
"Despite the ABV, the drinkability is high (for a barleywine). It's a sipper, after dinner beer. I plan on stocking up on any and all bottles I see from this spring release and hope to do a review with some significant age."
"O: My first experience with a barleywine and definitely a good one. I can see why people talk this brew up. I would be interested to see how this ages (possibility to see that in the next year or so, fingers crossed)."
"Overall – Extremely smooth, no alcohol warming or taste. The year and a half in the bottle seems to have done well for this (though I must admit I have not had this beer fresh but can only assume fresh it is a bit more “hot”). An enjoyable barlywine – glad to be able to try it!"
"Overall: Very impressed with this one, I don't normally like barleywines that much, but this one was very enjoyable."
"Overall: A nice and complex barleywine. For the money, I would certainly buy this again and see how it is fresher. A sipper, but one I will revisit."
"A gift from my wonderful wife - this beer is a deep brown color. Nearly non-existent head. The aroma is quite malty...a touch of dark fruit, some highly roasted scents that aren't barleywine-esque, but are still very fitting for this beer. Some alcohol is notable in the smell...but this characteristic comes out seriously in the taste. Boozy, malty, sweet. Bitterness balances the sweetness. Full in body and very drinkable."
"O: This is a damn fine and delicious beer. I like this one a lot and think the Troeg's brothers did a great job. It is easily palatable and not nearly as harsh as some other barley wines I have had. Good Stuff."
"Been wanting to try this one for a long time and it didn't disappoint. Excellent American style barleywine with plenty of aggressive hops, yet with a solid malty backbone underneath."
"3.5 D: Honestly I'm a bit shocked. Every other time I've had this I've enjoyed it much more. Of course, I never had it around the six month period. It seems like I'm right in the middle of this beer's awkward stage. I think I might re-review this at the one year mark. When this is fresh, the hops pop and give it a malty DIPA vibe. When this is old, the malts really shine. Right now, I can't say either of those things."
"It pours a murky copper/ brown color with a filmy tan head that left a ton of lacing. Right of the bat you can smell fruity, juicy hops, I noticed aromas of grapefruit and tangerine with lots of candied caramel and a hint of maple and sugar cookie. It tastes of dark fruits and caramel candy with brown sugar some citrus hops in the back ground and a hint of alcohol. The beer is thick and low in carbonation with a warming lingering finish. This is an excellent barleywine, one of my favorites so far, it is very well balanced and not too thick."
"Overall it's good barleywine but not something I'd seek out very often."
"Overall one of my favorites and I was super happy to have it finally on tap. Let's hope it starts showing up more in the future with the new Troegs facility. PS. I love this beer fresh."
"A great beer, sweet but could use more balance early as it really surrenders to the sweetness rather than controlling it into the right direction. Nice, though."
"D: This is good. Very, very hoppy. Very,very malty. So well integrated it is amazing. Complexity galore, astoundingly rich & robust, but it does not flaunt its heft. It just invites you in and then slowly puts a twinkle in your eyes and a smile your face."
"A fantastic brew. Smooth, clean, rounded and deliciously balanced. This is pure beer crack—delicious, devilish and devious. The sort of beer that sucks you in, makes you fall in love, and then cracks you on the head with a vase the next day."
"Reading other, very enthusiastic reviews, I'm not even certain I had the same beer. Aroma was lovely and it looks great, but this just seemed wildly overhopped to me, like a glass of thick grapefruit juice, with the malty goodness I detected in the nose completely overpowered by citrus, citrus, citrus. I love Troegs; maybe this one is just not my style."
"Drink- Another beer I was super glad to get a shot at. I would love a bottle of this at home. Quite tasty and well balanced."
"mouthfeel - pretty thick bodied and carbonated well. creamy and smooth. was a top for me as far as american barleys."
"Overall, a very nice interpretation of the American barleywine from the guys at Troegs. They never fail to impress."
"Overall- Smoothe mouthfeel, sweet taste, strong ABV, gorgeous appearance. What's not to like?"
"O: A good barleywine that isn't too hoppy or too sweet."
"O- One of the better barleywines I've had. Definitely true to the ""American"" style of hopping the hell out of everything, but still manages to maintain a decent balance between the hops and the darker flavors. I'll definitely be adding this back to the ""wants""."
"Drinkability - what a classic example of an American BW. Hops galore, this might be too bitter for my taste when fresh, but someday I'll try if new just for comparison. I love the lesser bitterness but maintained huge hoppiness."
"Overall - very good, strong barleywine. great rich flavors. I have not had the most recent batch to compare the 2009 with so I don't if the aging has helped the flavor any."
"O- One of the more enjoyable beers I've had. Even my friends who aren't into good beer, very much enjoyed this. Very excited to open a couple more of these and drink them. Thanks especially to LittleB with hooking me up with multiple bottles of this!"
"World Class."
"O: Overall it's really good. It's not over the top like most barleywines, which is what I like the most about it. I would recommend it and would drink it again."
"glad i waited and aged this beer it is just wonderful"
"O: Great example for the style and something I would have again. I enjoy a balance to my Barleywines and this one is just that...good stuff."
"D-Overall i really liked this barelywine. Very flavorful and a nice balance. Would drink thi anytime i could. Very crisp and clean."
"Very clean and well-made. Just enough sharpness and a sweetness that doesn't get too close to the edge."
"Generous gift from Wino47, poured into Bell's tulip. The color is classic barleywine, dark copper and cloudy with touches of red on the edge. Nice finger of head is a light tan like espresso crema. The nose is faint, burnt sugar and malt, with some hoppiness, nothing exciting. Taste is much better, nice hops up front, piney and fresh. The weight is good and the middle is malty and heavy with caramel and lemon peel. The finish is heavily bitter and a little to alcoholic for my taste. Overall a good beer I would drink again without hesitation. If I had another bottle I would give it a year, let the hops, bitterness and alcohol fade...making way for the nicer caramel and malt."
"O: Amazing barley wine for one tried so young. Almost no alcohol heat and well balanced and easily drinkable. I will be cellaring a few bottles to see how they come about but i would definitely drink this again. Watch the alcohol though because it sneaks up."
"O - A sipper, it is very filling, one 22oz. is all you need."
"overall this is a damn fine barleywine but nothing otherworldly. a solid A-/B+ range beer."
"O- A great beer! I would actually call it a DIPA/barleywine mix because of the hop presence. This beer is very sweet but remains surprisingly balanced throughout. The alcohol really sneaks up on you."
"I like this beer a lot. More dominate with hops than malts but the malts come through nicely. Great try!"
"I really like this beer and it is one of my favorite styles. In dryness and hop content it reminds me of Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine Style Ale, which is one of my personal favorites. This brew is a true hopped up American style Barleywine. You never notice the 9.3% ABV as it is buried by the distinct hops and malt of this brew. Extremely enjoyable. I will be looking for this when it is released next April."
"Overall: My favorite barleywine and I look forward to this each and every year. Yet another reason why I feel that Troegs has the best seasonal line up of any brewery. Great balance. I cant wait to do my vertical."
"O - What a fantastic reintroduction to barleywines. This is far better than any other of the breed I've had the pleasure to try. I'll certainly recommend to my friends, and will seek it out again. Just simply a work of art."
"Tastes are laced/lacy booze, caramel, sweetened butter, margarine, rye, breadcrumbs, malty sweetness, some hops, low lovibond malts, wheat, goat milk, milk sugar and dark fruits. Smell like oxidized liquors, herbs, fruits, potato skins, breath, and white meat."
"O: This is a great beer, even at a ripe young age of 2 months. If you like balanced barleywines that aren't too hot to start off, this one is for you"
"The CPJ"
"D - the high ABV aside it is quite drinkable."
"O- Very drinkable, awesome mouthfeel, and good hop bill but not a hop bomb like bigfoot. Its really balanced. Main complaint is that tart, tangyness that gives you a slightly uncomfortable taste mid sip. Cant wait to see how this develops although my guess would be that the tartness is going to come out a lot more."
"This is a big one that really coats the mouth. Probably would enjoy more after some cellar time given the heat at the end, but this is a pretty interesting barley wine."
"The body was appropriately full, not too rich or sticky, with a clean finish. Drinkability was nice and easy, for the style, and went smoothly. Overall, a very good example of what you're looking for from a BW. Worth seeking out."
"Overall: I liked this beer for its cocoa caramel pine hop candy taste. Heavy and a workout on your palette, it is still very tastey."
"Overall, I think I've hit an awkward point with this beer. it's been on the shelves for a few weeks so it's possible the hoppiness I've enjoyed in samplings has diminished a little bit more than really fresh. It's in the smell but not in the taste besides some lingering bitterness. I have another bottle I'm laying down for a year or two so will report back if there is significant improvement. overall, still enjoyable."
"wasn't impressed and probably wouldn't get it again"
"This pours a rich cloudy tawny amber color with a sandy brown foam head. The aromas are really a rich caramel smell with hints of both lemon (which I assume comes from the hops) and a touch of cinnamon. The taste of this beer has a deep caramel flavor. After a year most of the strong flavors of hops have subsided, but there are remnants of a light spicy herbal flavor that lingers behind the rich caramel. There are notes of vanilla and clove in the flavor as well but they are minor accents. There is a bit of a sting on the end of the sip, but for the most part this is really mellow and smooth. I'm thinking that perhaps I should have laid it down for another year in this regard. Overall this is a top tier barleywine. I could have this everyday no matter the weather. I'm so glad I had the chance to try it."
"Overall- It gets a little cloying. The hops are nice, but it still has a ton of toffee that is a little much."
"Cheers!"
"This beer had a very nice balance of sweetness and hoppiness. Quality and care seemed evident. A bit more hoppy/bitter than I desire but still very respectable."
"This beer pours out as a rich deep brown color with a really nice tan head on top. The smell is just over the top with hops, chocolate and some alcohol. The taste is strong with citrusy bitterness from the hops upfront as is settles in, the dark chocolate sweetness and dryness take effect. The mouthfeel of this brew is slightly heavy but smooth as well with some mellow carbonation. Overall I think this beer is very good. I may like this moree than the Nugget Necter. I feel that this brew has more complexity through out the entire glass. It's awesome in my opinion and I'll be looking to buy more in thr future."
"I bought this bottle on the Toes only. Had no idea what style or an other info. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this and at $6 for a bomber, the value is excellent."
"Poured a thick brown/deep ruby color with a large amount of off white and tan head. The nose has a lot of red wine notes such as prunes, black currants and red grapes. There is also a lot of heavy caramel and chocolate malts. Some piney hop notes are present. The flavor has a bitter tang upfront with a quick blast of some piney hops right after you swallow. The heavy roasted barley and booze shines through right after the hops. A complex amount of sweetness involved with the malts. Burnt molasses with a tingle of alcohol and a fruity dry finish. There is a heavy amount of hops well balanced with a heavy amount of sugary dark malts."
"Overall this is a sweet but balanced barley wine. I am interested to see what a little age would do on this beer but am definitely concerned that it might become overly sweet as the hops fade."
"Pours a thick brown, though you can see some light through it, no head and a nice lace top it off. Smell is hopped for sure, but with a subtle sugary undertone, and a hint of alcohol too. Taste is not very strong at all. There is the natural piney hoppness you would expect from a barley wine, but not too strong, there is also a sugary, nuttiness about it as well. The alcohol is there, and that keeps this a sipper. It is actually nicely carbonated, and not harsh going down, has the warm feeling on the way. Overall this was a good brew, I would not mind having another and certainly kept me warm this evening."
"D: One of my favorite barleywines I have had in a long time. This beer gives you rich complexity and the best of both worlds of malt and hops. It was great from the start all the way to the finish!"
"Regardless, delicious."
"O/D-This beer is simply a good time. I love the balance and the assertive taste. Finally I decide to pick up a bomber of this, and I am not disappointed. Great Job Troegs."
"O: Truly enjoyed this beer. Would love to get another one and age it a bit. Easy to drink, but can only have 1-2 of these at a time because of the high ABV."
"Very interesting brew!! Poured a very dark amber with a beige head a good lacing throughout. Aromas were of mild sweetness, some candied sugars and mild chocolate. Flavors were typical of a sweet barleywine with a mild hop background that balanced the flavor very nicely. Medium bodied texture and a great finish. Very unique and flavorful beer ... kind of like someone poured a snort of IPA into my barleywine - can’t wait to have this one again!!"
"Overall, pretty good. I like to get this every now and again and its got more hoppiness when fresh."
"O- This is an excellent barleywine. It's definitely a cousin of Nugget Nectar, and therefore very good- borderline great. I really enjoyed this beer, and encourage everyone to pick it up. Especially if you're a fan of this style. Cheers!"
"Overall I think this is a fairly complex and enjoyable beer. At $5.99/bomber its by far the best bang for your buck in the bottle shop."
"A cloudy, dark amber with an inch thick off white head that has great retention and beautiful lace. The smell is mostly sweet malts, toffee, dark fruit, and spice with some citrus edges. The taste is more pronounced with thick caramel, toffee, brown sugar and cinnamon with dark fruits like raisins and plums. Hints of chocolate and roast. It flows from sweet in the front to bitter in the back as it leaves a citrus, grapefruit, orange, herbal, floral, and pine notes on the back end. Very interesting and complex flavor development between the malts and hops. the bottle describes it well. It is like a dark chocolate and candided sugar wrapped hops. Thick, smooth and velvety. This is malty for a Barleywine. Sweet. Very enjoyable and interestingly balanced."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a light brown head. In the aroma, caramel, toffee and a small alcohol presence. In the taste, toffee, caramel and a hint of coffee. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry caramel and coffee aftertaste. A nice caramel ""sticky"" smell leading into and dry coffee, it feels boozy, but not."
"MF: A very smooth and velvety texture wraps around the teeth and invades your taste buds. From there the brew kicks back and stays right at the back of your throat, and this is where I initially noticed a fantastic warmth from the alcohol."
"Overall, this is great. I really want to compare this to a fresh bottle."
")- Decent. Could drink a couple."
"had a few bottles over the course of a few months, the hops continue to fade, but the malt hasn't taken over yet. so far I liked better fresh."
"D: a tasty beer, for sure, but so big and so sweet as to not be terribly drinkable. I'd definitely indulge in a second, but probably wouldn't want a third in one sitting. 4.0"
"Very nice barleywine overall, and one I would gladly have again. Quite drinkable as well, considering the abv."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer but was hoping for a bit more complexity. A solid beer that's not worth seeking out but is worth a shot if you see it around."
"D - Fairly drinkable. A pretty bit beer here, more for the sipping. The flavors are rich and bold, but for the most part, are well balanced and work together well. Nice hops in the finish."
"Overall: The old drinkability score would get a ""5". This is immensely poundable!! But the new overall goes down, because it is not a beer I hugely enjoyed... it is alright, but a bit thin and disappointing for the style. I thought the year-old aging would do it good, but maybe not? Will have to try it fresh, and also on tap... as it is, this 2010 Flying Mouflan is an alright hoppy barleywine. But definitely not a beer that will get me hard."
"Drinkability: The 9.3% is well hidden, albeit not completely, but this beer is put together well enough that it is definitely not a distraction. A sipper, for sure; this beer should be enjoyed throughout the course of a cool spring evening, and that's just what the weather calls for this evening!"
"This beer pours a nice dark copper with reddish highlights. Off white head formation was weak and dissipated quickly, leaving very little lacing. Aroma consisted of fruity esters, dark fruits, some pepper and a toffee sweetness. This thing is very tasty. Lots of citrus hops, spicy pepper, and a caramel apple malt flavour. You do get the dark fruits (currants, raisins, plums) but they are more subdued. Mouthfeel was medium and sticky. A touch too much alcohol heat produced slight burning. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. Even though it is a year old, it still tasted 'young' and a tad hot. I am glad I have some 2009s to try in a few months."
"O: Well crafted a year out. Fresh, I'm certain this is a hop-bomb and I likely wouldn't enjoy it - hop profile here tends to be too spicy. Nonetheless, this beer was well done."
"D- easy to finish. i wish i could have tried this one when fresh. next time ill make it a point to. another great beer from troegs."
"D: Pretty sure this beer is in a transitional stage. Tried it about 1 month after it came out and loved it; right now, not so much. I have one bottle left, so hopefully this one heads in the right direction"
"Sweet caramel, light fig, spun sugar, faded hops that lend some residual bitterness. Heavy crystal malt lends burly sweet toffee and richness. Sticky on the lips, the caramel notes linger in the aftertaste. Full bodied, with a dry yet sticky finish. Hops lend some herbal notes. A decent barleywine, one to share. Thanks Mike for this one!"
"Notes: A solid and very enjoyable American Barleywine from a solid brewery."
"-Cheers"
"Very drinkable for a monster barleywine, I absolutely love it. Great Job Troeg, you should be proud. And thanks to my Doctor for this great beer to try."
"Strong caramel malt base is overwhelmed by the intense nugget hop quality. Rich tobacco and earthy hop. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability is easily among the best fot the style. Awesome balance."
"D: A good American Barleywine. A sipper that gives off a little heat towards the end of the bottle."
"1308"
"Those of you lucky enough to live in the Troegs distribution area know how good these guys are (if you don't, you should). Flying Mouflan Ale is yet one more example of the excellence emanating from Harrisburg. Bottom line: this is one of the best American barleywines of the past year. Thanks mgbickel."
"This was my first formal American Barleywine review, and only the third I've ever tasted, behind Stone Old Guardian and Nemesis '10. I do believe I enjoy this more than the two former, so I'll be giving this slightly increased points towards style for the time being."
"This packs a bit of a wallop but it's not as bad as some of the other Barleywines that I've had over the years. No rye or overwhelming heaviness to this and if there's a better hoppy Barleywine that's out there, I'm certainly not aware of it! This is not a beer that gets chugged down but rather enjoyed after a heart meal, since its more than able to meet the challenge."
"D - Pretty high all things considered. I love aged mouflan and this one really hit the spot. The higher ABV knocks this one down a few notches but it is still one of the best hoppy barleywines on the market today."
"The body is a dark mahogany with a hint of red highlights and a respectable light tan head. Raisin aroma up front with hints of dark bitter chocolate and toffee in the background. Also finishes with a slight hop aroma. The flavor is very dark and malty with raisins and figs in the front for the flavor. It finishes with a sweet chocolate and toffee flavors rounding out with a grassy hop flavor. Nice full body on this with soft carbonation. Drinks well, a bit of a sipper, but a great beer."
"sweet taste of brown sugar/dark molasses, caramel and some dried fruit, raisin (prunes?) and a little bit of a hop bite - surprisingly well balanced and smooth - a little alcohol warmth - medium bodied on the tongue with what feels like a good amount of carbonation - goes down real easy - maybe not the best example of the style but a real good beer nonetheless."
"THis is pretty good fresh, the hops are starting to already add weird flavors to it after 8 months, but it mentions aging it, so I wonder if this will go the route of Big FOot and age really well to malty flavors, or the way of Behemouth and get really earthy, minerality, dirty, and not so great. I'm thinking the later as the hops already seem to cheat that way."
"Average mouthfeel but overall a very enjoable beer."
"D- I've never been a big Barley Wine drinker... but I really am enjoying this one. I'm gonna pick up at least one more to age. I'll definately drink this one again!"
"I don't think this beer fully keeps up with American standards like Great Divide's Old Ruffian, Stone's Old Guardian, Avery's Hog Heaven, Lagunitas's Olde Gnarlywine, or Sierra Nevada's (aged) Bigfoot, but it's only just behind them. If you're on an American barleywine kick, I'd definitely advise picking up a bottle of this."
"This is a wondeful barleywine. It has a decently high abv, but the flavors and over all drinkablity of this brew mask it well. As I let this brew sit after being poured from tap it seemed to just get better as it warmed a bit. This is a great American Barleywine and another great brew that I have enjoyed by Troegs."
"Very drinkable, just what you want in a barleywine with some great flavors that set it apart."
"D- This is certainly a sipping beer. Examine this one, note its characteristics closely- it's meant to be drunk this way."
"Pours a dark brown/garnet, with two fingers of tan head.  Smells are hops, caramel, sweet candy and some chocolate malt.  Tastes are raisins, caramel, some chocolate and a hop finish.  Mouthfeel is thick and sticky.  Drinkability is good, I really enjoy this beer and could drink a couple in a setting no problem.  "
"Purchased this bottle about a year ago from Boonton Liquor Outlet in Boonton, NJ. Into a pint glass, it poured a cloudy reddish copper with three fingers of tan head, that retained and laced very well. Smelled of very sweet apples, malt, raisin, prune, and very feint herbal hops. The taste was very similar to a barleywine...very plum, raisin, and sweet, with a sweet, alcoholic finish. Thick-bodied, and smooth; very little carbonation in the feel. This beer is good, but still a little rough; I'd like to get another bottle and age it some more to see if it smoothens out."
"The flavors on the palate are excellent. A blend of caramel, brown sugar and rather surprisingly, a little cream too. In this aspect, it reminds me of caramel cream candy. Fruity hoppiness is present in the mid-palate with a blend of orange peel and pine. While there's a little bit of apple, it's more red delicious than granny smith, so I doubt there's any acetaldehyde here. Brown sugar is present on the finish, along with a little leather and some hop bitterness. In fact, the finish is where the hops are most assertive, lingering on as a balancing bitterness. While the flavors are great, and I really do like that this isn't too sticky, a little bit more lingering sweetness of the finish would make this world class. The mouthfeel is sublime. Soft, smooth and creamy, the gentle carbonation works beautifully with the flavors, making this very drinkable."
"A very drinkable barleywine. The high ABV is masked well and this beers flavors really start to pop as it warms. I havne't had many Troegs, but the ones I have had were all pretty excellent. This brew is no exception, and at only $8 for a bomber, it's reasonably priced. I would pick this up again, no doubt."
"Thanks Josh!"
"Drinkability is good, a little dangerous as I think I could easily work through a few glasses of this with no problem."
"Dr. Don't know yet, but I'm thinking one bomber will be all she wrote for the night."
"D - alcohol is very well hidden and everything is extremely well balanced. This is a dangerously drinkable ale. Just fantastic."
"While, not like most barleywines I've tried, The Flying Mouflan is a nice beer indeed. Would certainly try again."
"Pours a dark, semi-clear chestnut brown colour, with a slight tinge of red to it. Tastes of candi sugars with a nice malt backbone to it. Drinks down pretty smooth and I'm not picking up any of the 9.3% alcohol. I've really been enjoying these american barleywines lately, and this one doesn't disappoint."
"Mouthfeel is very full bodied for an American style Barleywine. Carbonation is appropriately low. Interesting beer, but not on the top tier of American Barleywines."
"This is highly drinkable and a great winter warm-up brew. Not overdone, and worth finding."
"D - This is an easy drinker and the best I have had from Troegs,  but there are better examples of the style out there. I'd drink it again and recommend it to someone who you know enjoys darker beers. This one needs a bit more time though, so let it age at least a year to fully appreciate it."
"D: very tasty, a 22oz is a perfect serving. An exceptional barley wine, not too sweet with a perfect hop balance. Worth the wait to age it to let the malts develop and the hops mello out."
"D - So much flavor this is a sipper, very enjoyable, but the 22 oz. bottle is almost too much for a single serving. This is meant to be savored and shared."
"D: A perfectly acceptable barleywine."
"D - Smooth and supple with a great balance and finish. Not boozy at all, it's an easy drinking barleywine. Great depth. Thanks guys!"
"D= This is no doubt a tastey beer but a great barleywine? Eh. I've had a few that I would concider better. I love me some barleywines but this one I would say falls down the middle of the road."
"D: A very good barleywine, albeit not what I would consider the typical barleywine. Very tasty with a refined quality that adds to the drinkability."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Almost clear garnet/amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light grapefruit nose. Flavor is grapefruit balanced by the malts, sweeter than their Nugget Nectar. Lingering grapefruit finish. $7.25 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Dark reddish brown in color with an amber head. Smell was a combination of alcohol and malt. Almost biscuity. Flavor was very thick on the tongue but good, especially during the the cold days of fall."
"If this was local i'd buy a generous amount, and drink it regularly during our winter 6 months. great brew,"
"Drinkability: I need to buy another one and let it sit awhile. It seems a little in-between now at four months in the bottle. Overall, a good barleywine with lots of sweet hops and some chocolate and toasty flavors. As I said, will probably meld nicely with age."
"D: Even though Troegs is basically my local brewery, I had never tried this brew until this year and had been searching for it for ages. For some reason, they produced a lot of it this year, and God bless them for doing so!"
"D- This beer is good. It's very drinkable in all aspects. The higher ABV in this is well hidden only showing up in the final second. Troegs is a good brewery with a fantastic porfolio which is proven time and time again with each beer I try."
"A nice take on the barleywine from Troegs which seems to live up to the hype (from my friends.)"
"D - This is definitely mroe then jsut a sipper, ive been taking mouthfuls pretty quickly and my mouth still begsfor more."
"D: Most certainly an easy beer to drink, not too heavy or not too light. Very classy, so drink it with class. I have to remember this one."
"D - This is a nice bareleywine Has some good flavors to it but not really digging the sticky mouthfeel. Would like to age this stuff for a while though"
"Drinkability is good... for something this ABV. Glad it comes in a bomber, but one was enough."
"This is a strong representation of the standard. I'm not a big bittering hops fan, so my ratings reflect this."
"Liking this more and more as it warms in the glass.."
"MF/D- Full body here. A very creamy brew that's as easy to drink as it could be."
"D- definitely sip it! TFM is a clear cut presentation of an American Barley Wine. No question you need to sip this. But you can definitely keep filling your cup... for a little while"
"Overall, a pretty solid bwine. A nice aroma backed up with a full flavored taste. I enjoyed this one. The citrus was really a nice touch showing some fresh hoppyness."
"D: It drank pretty good considering the ABV and the hop bite but it is definitely a tasty sipper. Overall I thought it was a decent barleywine offering from troegs."
"Deep copper pour with ruby highlighting. The fluffy tannish yellow head has pretty good retention. Just as others have stated, the smell is strong with toffee and prickly pine, but I really notice a strong butter aroma. Wow, this tastes really good. There's pine, pears, and chocolate, but what really stands out is a strong burnt caramel/sugar that stays on the palate for quite a while. Really creamy smooth feel to this. The prickliness seems to come more from the hops than the carbonation. Fairly dry finish, but that candied burnt taste that lingers is very pleasant. Drinkability is pretty solid throughout, but I think one bomber is plenty at one sitting."
"D - Very good for a barleywine. Smooth yet very assertive. This one is great now and will definitely improve with some age."
"Split a bomber with friends at Spinnerstown Hotel over diner. This is a fine barleywine, though I was hoping it would be a bit hoppier. Despite a good finishing bitter kick, it was smooth by comparison to barleywines like Bigfoot. The beer opened with a licorice and sweet cheer taste and lighter caramel and toffee malts with a hint of gingerbread. The finish was a satisfying blast of bitter citrus and orange peel hops. If you like the style, this is certainly worth a try. It manages to be fruity for the style (in a good way), without being too thick or sweet."
"Overall: A tasty beer worth trying if you like the style. For a low alcohol version of the style the booze was pretty evident which impacted the drinkability. This bottle is 5 months old and would certainly improve with some more age. Softer alcohols and a mellower hop impression would allow the malt to come out more I think."
"As the label suggests, I will cellar one and see how things transform in a year. If I can wait that long."
"This was my first meeting with Flying Mouflan, and it falls a little short of expectations. Those expectations were based on hype, chatter, reviews, and the word of friends who have had this. But it's still good enough to qualify as a must-try for all aficionados of the American barleywine style. Is this a little young yet? Possibly, being only 5 months in the bottle. I'd try it again I suppose...wouldn't be an arm-twister."
"D: A good hoppy barley wine but the alcohol and bitter-sweetness do become a bit wearing after a bit"
"2010 vintage. 22oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours a dull, semi-hazy mahogany with a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that quickly disperses into a thick, bubbly band around the edges. Nose reveals hops, toffee, dark fruit and ethanol. Taste follows nose - backbone is quite malty. Fruity/Toffee quality precedes the hoppy character that came first in the nose. Alcohol quality also diminishes. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an even and pleasant carbonation - some prickliness at the front of the tongue, diminishes towards the back. A well-balanced American Barleywine that doesn't punch you in the mouth with hops. Perhaps a little light, but very tasty. I definitely want to pick up another bottle to cellar for a few years to see how the character changes."
"This was a pretty tasty barleywine, good flavor and pretty easy to drink for the style. This is basically a more intense version of NN."
"Barleywines are a favorite of mine and this one did not disappoint. Definitely recommended."
"Nice balance for a barley wine--pronounced hop shows up in the swallow and lingers for a moderate aftertaste. Said aftertaste has a cocoa element to it. The beginning is solidly darker malt. Not as sweet as the smell suggests, but it isn't dry either. Rich body with some strong alcohol oiliness--you can tell this is a potent beer."
"d - A pretty good barleywine. Wish there was a little less alcohol in the smell and taste, but still pretty good overall. Would try again."
"Highly drinkable, at 9.3%, I'm working to pace myself on this very tasty brew. Though very different from Troeg's Mad Elf, it is every bit as good."
"This might be one of, if not my favorite beer I've had so far. I'd love to try this one fresh having tried it about 4-5 months after being brewed. Being that it aged it really feels like the hops have mellowed but are definately still there. A true treasure from Troegs."
"D- great beer form Troegs and this will rival my fav from them...nugget nectar. Makes number two on my list now above hopback amber!"
"Picked this up at Save-On, a great beer store in Mentor Ohio. Dark amber brown pour with creamy, but quickly fading head with excellent lacing. Loads of caramel and bready malts in the earthy nose, along with hints of dark fruit, grapefruit and pine. Tons of caramel and brown sugar in the taste as well. Very complex with hints of oak, toffee, vanilla, grapefruit, molasses, dark fruits, pine and alcohol. I would swear this was oak aged. Reminds me a lot of oak aged Arrogant Bastard. This is one of those beers that you need to let warm up. Definitely improves as it warms. Nice thick, chewy, bitter and resiny mouthfeel with the alcohol warming slightly throughout. Extremely drinkable for such a big beer. Probably one of the most drinkable barley wines I've had. Another great beer from Troegs!"
"Notes: Didn't know what to expect from this one, but I like it! Appearance score suffers because I don't think it looks like what I consider to be the archetypal Barleywine (but it is really pretty!). Glad I got two bottles! One for right now and one for the cellar...."
"DB- Great price for a very solid Barleywine. The roast and caramel aspects mixing is nice. No excuse not to give this a try."
"D: IMHO best beer. At least out of the relatively cheap crafts i've tried. Drinkable only for it's superb taste"
"-i really enjoyed this beer. i can see it being a good vertical as the hops calms down a bit and the other flavors become more pronounced. a fine, balanced example of an american barleywine"
"D: If you like carmel malts then this is a must drink."
"*From notes taken on 7-29-10"
"Didn't realize this was a barleywine; it's very good but probably not my fav in this category."
"Drinkability - Get ready, this beer will challenge you. Ive drank it fresh and a little to fast and the high alcohol made my face numb! But yes, this is tasty and unique. Ive bought 3 cases of beer this year, and this was one of them. A special seasonal beer, i really hope troegs makes this year round in 12 oz bottles. Im aging 4 bottles, opening one after 4 months on thanksgiving. Ill review this beer again."
"This tastes like a very young barleywine that desperately needs some mellowing time in the bottle. Damn good reason to put dates on the bottle. And don't bother shipping it out until it's had a couple months to age at the brewery."
"Nice dark brown / ruby red body and a thin light brown head with large soapy bubbles. WOW! One of the best smelling beers I have come across. Amazing fruit, fig, hint of alcohol, that classic barleywine smell (yeast?), a hint of pine from the hops, and a slight must. Wow again on the taste, the overall balance is what I consider critical in a beer and this one delivers. Heavy, bold malt up front combines with the sweetness of the alcohol to for a flavor and texture similar to molasses. Not much flavor detected in the middle but on the finish is a nice balance of citrus hops, grapefruit and pine. Mouthfeel is slick and oily do to the alcohol, but also a bit thick (in a good way) due to all the malt. Drinkability is good for a high powered beer; you may only require one bottle though. This is not a session beer, it's a big beer. This beer is on par with my other favorite barleywine style Hog Heaven"
"Not sure if this beer would benefit from additional age as the hops play a major role in the flavor and not sure the malt could pick up the slack."
"Drinks: like a good barleywine. Not great, but good. It was, however, INCREDIBLE with Thai chicken. Fours all around!"
"D - solid, hop-heavy barleywine...really excited to see what this does with some time. not far off the advertisement of being an Imperial NN. more of a hybrid but very enjoyable."
"The pour revealed a nice head with a caramel like hue and nice retention. The nose reminds me of citrusy hops and big caramel hops and dark fruits with raisins. The taste is filled caramel, raisins, toffee and a citrus hop that doesnt linger, a very mellow touch of heat. The carb levels are decent, a heavy beer that is slighty on the syrupy side. This is a sipper. Overall I really enjoyed this beer, I thought the hops would be more bitter on the back-end but as the bottle says this is Nugget Nectar after it was pushed off the side of cliff. It is really an incredibly malty version of Nugget Nectar. I want to see what some age does to this cause I think a year or two will really make this beer shine."
"Found at Premiere Gourmet. A superior beer, better in every way. Pours a dark amber colour. Full mouthfeel supported by caramel malts. It is very hoppy like an American barleywine usually is. Like a Double IPA, tasty orange-grapefruit citrus. Appropriate carbonation."
"D--Need to listen to the brewers who say on the label, ""patient beer lovers who cellar will be rewarded"" I have to agree this is a beer that needs some time to mellow and lose some of its hoppy bite. Think that is the plan with the other bottles I have..."
"Pours a hazy amber brown color with a brownish tan head that doesn't retain all that well but leaves copious amounts of spotty lace all about the glass. The aroma has a bright citrusy aroma that exceeds it's bottled version. The heat of the alcohol character is somewhat abrasive. However, the flavor has a deeper complexity of malt back on draft than from the bottle. The malt comes across tasting more like a dark sugary caramel with an indication of some chocolate that I never experienced before in the bottled version. Very warming and bitter finish that leaves an oily resinous bitterness that is piercing to the palate."
"D - Well I assume this beer is a bit old, at least 4 or 5 months since I have seen it before at the shop and they don't seem to rotate stock. It has aged well on the shelf and hops have mellowed to give this beer more flavor and less ABV burn. Well done Troegs!"
"overall: sorry I know a lot of people like this beer but i don't. The first beer from Troegs I have had that I did not like. oh well you cant like em all right? cheers"
"D: Plenty drinkable (as much as you can get for a barleywine), with good flavors. This is one I could enjoy fresh or probably with some age on it."
"D - I am normally not a barley wine drinker but this one was superb. I will buy this one again."
"22oz. bomber: this one pours a ruby tinged very dark amber color. It was fairly clear and had a small tan head on it. Leaves a little lacing. Some pine and citrus hops to the nose. I also get some Subtle caramel and dark fruits. The taste is full bodied and good. Nice balance of caramel sweetness and some citrus hop bite. The alcohol is well hidden. Very smooth and easy drinking"
"Finish is reminiscent of candied yams. There is very dry end to this one. The body is smooth, but due to the sweetness of this one you will need to take your time. Would like to see this one aged."
"Aged for 4 months, the alcohol has largely faded out. The bottle states Flying Mouflan ""tastes like hops dipped in candied sugar and rolled around in cocoa nibs."" That sounds right on."
"Drinkability: A nice mellow barleywine. Easier to drink than most, love the hops. Pretty decent showing from Troegs."
"Drinkability-Just a good, straight forward, tasty Barleywine, not quite as hop-forward as Bigfoot but somewhat richer in malt character. I could drink a glass or two."
"Impression: Finally tasting this semi-fresh (six weeks old). This is a delicious masterpiece from true craft beer artists."
"Tastes like a big American Barleywine--big caramel malt backbone, a bit of roast to it, followed by some nice bittering hops to even it out and give it an overall very nice drinkability. Thick in the mouth, it's coating. Good amount of carbonation to keep it moving. Nice work here."
"D- Certainly among the top American barleywines out there; wonderful balancing act between the hops and the malt reminiscent of one of my favorite beers. I would call this a Red Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale very next to perfect!!!"
"More imperial amber than barleywine in my opinion, but a good beer none the less."
"D - Definate have again would love to compare aged so looking forward to getting more of this and aging it."
"Beer is medium bodied and creamy smooth in the mouth. Very malty, finishes slightly dry, moderate bitterness, just enough. I don't know the vintage but I'll assume it is young. There is a hint of alcohol in the forward mouth. Overall, very good."
"D - I would like to have a case of this stuff!"
"Tröegs Flying Mouflan is a clear, reddish brown ale with a thick, dense, bubbly, oily beige head that has outstanding retention. The aroma is slightly sweet and quite hoppy. It smells floral, with notes of orange, grass, caramel and bubble gum. It has a super smooth full body with a clean dry finish. It tastes bold and well balanced. It's slightly sweet with caramel and has a roastiness, like chocolate and coffee. There are notes of orange peel and black pepper. Juniper and wood resin provide the taste for the finish. This is super enjoyable. There are lots of different flavors going on, but they never interfere with each other. This is a world class ale, the kind I run across once or twice a year. I never even thought of it as a barleywine. I was just kind of thinking of it as an American strong ale while I was drinking it. Now that I think about it, I guess it could be a barleywine. Either way, it's epic!"
"D- Could get difficult to put a lot of this down, but I wouldn't mind finishing out the night with something like this regularly."
"Drinkability is ok, I guess. I find it too sweet. Somewhat off-kilter for the style, seemingly Flying Mouflan isn't set on being a Barleywine. Overall it's alright, but really weird. I have to dock it for style."
"Overall a pretty good beer. I would seek this out again."
"Tremendous stuff, has all the flavor you would want and leaves you wanting more (sips that is). World class barleywine. Very sessionable, the best sessionable barleywine I have had."
"Wow, an excellent American Barleywine to be savored with every sip, letting it warm gradually as you go. Slow and savory."
" I was not a fan last year of this beer but my palette has evolved and I can now appreciate this beer to its fullest."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Pours a deep amber color that is predominantly brown. Smell is hoppy up front with pine and grapefruit dominating with a chocolatey nutty presence intermingled. Taste is surprisingly sweet I was expecting something much harsher given the description on the bottle and the abv. The alcohol is so well hidden with this one, with the mouthfeel slightly syrupy. This is scary drinkable given the abv. Will be buying more"
"Tough to say, but I think this may be my favorite offering of Troegs, even over the Troegenator or Mad Elf, at which I feel like I'm cheating on my favorite winter-time offering (Elf). Fantastic brew!!!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied. For a rich and flavorful ale it has a decidedly approachable drinkability, with excellent malt to hop balance."
"A solid barleywine, this baby was fresh and evident of the strong hop presence. Nothing really stood out, but solid nonetheless."
"D - This one was awflly sweet for me. At the end of each sip I just got this sugary overload type of a feeling which wasn't great. However, this is great if you want to experience a Hulked up version of Nugget Nectar."
"Suggestion: drink slightly warmer than what seems appropriate; the rich and fruity malt character seems to peak at just below room temp."
"D - The alcohol is hidden very well. I'm glad I only had this one 750ml bottle around otherwise I think I could have continued to drink this one all night. I'm very interested to see how this one ages so I'll be sure to pick up a few more."
"Overall, slightly too carbonated and the alcohol a bit too prevalent. I am definitely not a fan of this beer fresh but I'd give it a shot with some age."
"D - Will most likely be picking up another bottle or two to age. Great beer."
"D: The drinkability is good (as is the beer overall) although I'm hoping that it ages gracefully and becomes considerably better."
"Drinkability: I've enjoyed drinking this beer and each sip led easily and naturally to the next. It is an interesting take on the American Barleywine style that I'll probably return to once in a while. That said its not at the top of my shopping list if only because the finish has an almost earthy or burnt bitterness that seems to me to jar and detract just a bit from the whole."
"Cant get any closer to perfect! This beer isn't for the weak. Im so glad I tried this, what a great surprise. WOW! I cant imagine how this will age?"
"D-huge hop presence but still enough malt to have some balance. so smooth and virtually no showing of any alcohol."
"D: Drinks pretty well but one 22 oz. bottle is plenty at a sitting. I would like to try both an ultra fresh and a 1-3 year old bottle so I will pick up another to age and look out for the next release."
"Pours a nice brown, with some red highlights, thick, stiff yet short cap of khaki head, leaves good lacing. Scent is a strong whiff of carmel and citrusy hops, hints of toffee, nuts, cocoa, popcorn. Taste is aggressive, yet muted hops - possibly that in between period between fresh and aged - with a full carmel, roasted nut taste with minimal prescence of chocolate and butterscotch. Medium to full bodied, thick, chewey but not coating. A good beer, which has some muddled flavors that could be stuck between fresh and aged, would try another."
"Poured from a bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Dark brown in color with over a half inch of head that dissapated quickly. Candied flavor with a very hoppy finish. One of my favorite American barleywines, as the big hop and malt flavor give this a big, enjoyable flavor. Kinda over the top, but that's what I want from this style."
"I've tried Scratch #4, which is the same recipe as Flying Mouflan. I've even tried Flying Mouflan itself. When I saw this on tap, however, I realized that I have never tried this beer fresh, so I ordered it. I'm glad I did. This beer is great aged and great fresh, but it's completely different each way. The hop profile is great, but it's a little hot in the finish."
"This beer explodes with flavor into your mouth but it loses its novelty fast. For being a barleywine this is delicious but overall I think that if this beer was packaged in a smaller quantity I would have enjoyed it more. I just felt big after one bottle--good flavor but no drinkability."
"Overall: Certainly among the top American barleywines out there; wonderful balancing act between the hops and the malt"
"Drinkability: full flavored excellence, robust with plenty of hops"
"D- This could definitely create a sloppy night."
"D: A little hoppy, a little sweet, but a pretty good drink. can definitely handle more then one"
"Overall I am quite impressed with this beer on-tap. Definitely an incredible American Barleywine and just an overall wonderfully complex beer. I do prefer this beer with some age on it, but fresh it is quite nice as well. Highly Recommended."
"The body is creamy, but a little thinner than I'd like. Some mild carbonation on the tongue. I guess this bottle has been on the shelves for a few months. I can only imagine that the hops were more pronounced in flavor when fresh. They have faded for sure. There is still a mildly bitter aftertaste, but the malts have come to the forefront. Some toasted caramel and toffee noted. This was still a great beer, I just wish I could have tried it earlier."
"The body is thinner than expected with a smooth texture and okay carbonation. The lack of body(for style) adds drinkability, but when I am drinking an American BW 'drinkability' is not a quality I am looking for, I want a beast of a sipper!"
"Notes: I am impressed with this beer that I did not know existed until I saw it at Lena's in Painesville this week. I would recommend it at least to anyone who appreciated NN. I find Barleywines to be particularly not drinkable but this might be the best American Barleywine after the sublime Great Lakes Barley Wine and it is certainly better than Sierra Nevada Bigfoot."
"Pours a deep, rich mahogany color, capped off with a very nice, airy yellow-beige foam. Nice piney hop aromas, with bubblegum and apricots. Flavors of citrusy hops, caramel malt and some alcohol. Another good beer from the East. The more I try from Troegs, the more I am impressed."
"This is a highly drinkable beer. I need to pick up a few more bottles to stash away!"
"Tasty, so tasty. Recommended fo' sho'."
"Poured into a snifter for a hearty brown body with good tan head that receeds at a medium pace and leaves cloying lace. The smell is a great mix of sugary malts like caramel and chocolate and there is a nice juicy fruit burst like cherries in there; citric hop smell is pushed to the back. Medium-bodied with chewiness and a mix of citric hoppy dryness. Large burst of sweetness derived from chocolate and cherry along with hints of tropical fruit. Has a little bit of breadiness to it in the back as it finishes dry. The sweet and fruit flavors, along with the minor hop bit, combine for a well-balanced and strong sipper that is great to relax with."
"Delicious. Strong, but easy to drink considering its strength. Flavorful and worth trying. I'd probably have it again."
"This is not your father's BW-style. It's part of the new school, which offers experimentation in hop-forward beers but the downside is a loss of some of the enegmatic, historic craft that first engineered this style of beer before America was even founded."
"Heavy toast, toffee and caramel are balanced, overpowered even, by a hearty hop load with tons of minty and floral flavor and a bit less bitterness. The lupulin that is there on the finish lingers on and on for quite some time. Does not lack for flavor punch, that is for sure and far from subtle. Maybe a bit overdone perhaps? Alcohol is big and feels right at about the 9% or so range. I prefer Nugget Nectar to this, but it was a fun beer to try. I think this falls more into the realm of Imperial Red ale like a Lagunitas Lucky 13 than a barleywine, as classified here."
"D-quite nice for a 9.3% beer; not a huge barleywine fan, but this was quite good with lots of flavor and hoppy spiciness"
"Very easy to drink. A really inviting, but straight forward barleywine."
"thumbs up."
"I drank this from a bottle into my Orval glass...The beer pours a light watery brown with nice carbonation. Very nice creamy tan head, good retention and lacing...The aroma is super light, borderline boring, light hops and a touch of caramel. The taste is also super light. What I can pull out actually taste's pretty good, just not a ton of flavor. This is an easy to drink crushable barleywine, can't believe its 9%."
"Drinkability is wonderful man this is enjoyable or I am just in the Barleywine mood or something. Would defiantly recommend this one, and will be buying more."
"D: The feel makes this a very drinkable barleywine with plenty of hops but malts making a strong statement in the over profile of this beer."
"Amber/coppery color with a nice, somewhat off white head. Heavy caramel aroma and a decent dose of hops. Slick, malty flavors. Heavy caramel/treacle like sweetness. Big blast of hops that tend to linger. Nice citrus after taste. Very full mouthfeel. On par with most other US barleywines. Great flavor overall-could use a bit more hops to bring it in line. I'd sail again."
"The Flying Mouflan provides a remarkable multi-sensory happy-to-be-alive experience."
"Okay, beyond some breed of sheep, I can't for the life of me figure out what the hell a ""mouflan"" is, much less appreciate one's ability to fly (I assume this is an extraordinary feat for a normal mouflan). Whatever it is, it pours a very dark ruby brown with a bright ring of suds on top. Following a cursory encounter, my nose feels like it's been bitch-slapped by an evergreen. I think there's some wheat in there too, but I'm still trying to get over the fact that a plant rocked my world so badly. Yep, the fetal position is involved, as is a dank corner. *tear* But the best way to overcome a problem such as this is direct confrontation. And, following conventional wisdom, confrontation has yielded understanding. The pine that was so overpowering before is till there up front, but soon a bit of light molasses (very light) and very bitter chocolate enter the fray, diluting the pine, but not getting rid of it. The olio marches through in harmony, nice and smooth, though with a slight bite of carbonated fury (think the nipping of a mean miniature pinscher). The decent heat and sharp piney bitterness keep this guy (whatever it is) a sipper rather than a drinker."
"mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being on the lower side. Drinkability is very good, I really liked this beer. The hoppy flavors were very nicely done much like they are in NN. The malt gave it a nice big and bold body to it which was also nice. Only criticism is it has some noticeable alcohol finish, I'm sure it would go away with some age but so would the hoppy flavors I love in it probably."
"D: This is a sipper, although I didn't notice too much alcohol ""heat", but at 9.3% ABV. this one is going to hit you."
"A: Thick tan head that sticks to the side of the glass off the original pour, head retention is pretty impressive, medium brown in color with a faint amber hue, small and slow moving bubbles, visible legs off a swirl of the glass - 4.50, S: Strong hop bouquet, reminds me of their Nugget Nectar on steroids, quite resiny and pungent along with significant grapefruit and hint of orange, malt also makes a showing on the nose quite sweet and somewhat caramelly, hop dominated aroma - 4.00, T: Though classified as a barley wine - and certainly within the category - Flying Mouflan toes the line with an Imperial IPA, loads of citrus balanced with a solid layer of thick caramel malts, very sweet - akin to a raisin, alcohol is quite noticeable, sturdy hop bite which I haven't given the chance to mellow with age since it was only bottled one month ago - 4.25, M: Slight syrupy taste, very smooth and velvety - 3.50, D: All around a very drinkable beer, it might lean a little more to the side of hops than you'd expect from a Barley Wine, but that pleases me quite fine - 4.00"
"M/D - Full body with moderate stickiness. Pretty easy to drink but I have enough sense to know that something with this much flavor packs a punch, a sipper for sure. Really nice beer, maybe a tad expensive."
"All in all, a joy to drink, like pretty much every other Troegs offering. I can see the similarities with Nugget Nectar, but the Mouflan is really a whole different malty animal. This might be my new favorite barleywine."
"CHEERS!!"
"Overall, this has been a tough one to get and I'm glad I procured two bottles of this. I can't say enough about the balance (which sometimes gets to be an overused cliche'). Id say this would be a good transition beer if any hop heads are looking to explore barleywines for the first time. Being an IPA hophead, barleywines are my second most favorite and this one definitely delivers. Rock-n-roll fist pump for you, Troegs."
"pours a cloudy amber color with spare creamy head and spare lacing. smells lightly toasted and very sweet. taste it much the same but more potent. average hop flavor and soft carbonation. flavor duration is very long and moderately bitter. medium body with a fairly creamy texture. very different from other barleywines that i've had. very delicious, although very different than i assumed it would be. this beer surpassed all my expectations. alcohol well hidden."
"M/D - Big body with a sharp dry finish. Semi-smooth on the palate and the alcohol comes through at the end. Overall quite the addictive brew and would be interesting to see how it changes with some age on it"
"D: Very fresh, this beer is just a bit hot, the body of the beer tends to mellow the heat though. Huge bodied barleywine. Very impressed with this one. Just barely draws the line between the seas for barleywines. Sweet and hoppy. Fantastic beer."
"If any one knows how this ages, shoot me a message!!"
"Started beer at fridge tempurature. Started drinking it at this temp, but majority is drank while closer to cellar tamp. Flavor has an initial hop bitterness-very sharp flavor and texture. Booze is not hidden...can really feel and taste the ABV. High carbonation, crisp/sharp/semi complex mouthfeel. Flavors of sweet fruits, mixed with the sharp hoppiness...really create a nice complexity and characteristics. A very solid barleywine...not the best...but very tastey!"
" I am glad I have one to age I think this beast will be totally changed with some age if I can wait that long"
"I don't think it's accurate to call this one a barleywine. It's more like a strong ale with lots of hops. It's really a good beer. I like it better than Nugget Nectar."
"D - Everything seems right in place for this offering by Troegs. So many different, well balanced aromas and tastes. Like other reviews before me, I wish I had bought more than one bottle."
"Oh yeah, one final word: I'm flying, and I'm a sheep."
"Drinkability: Right now I wish I bought more then the 2 bottles I bought. Will be buying more to drink now and to age."
"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a white head. The aroma is caramel, brown sugar and dark fruit. Just an awesome aroma. The flavor is more of the same with figs, raisins, molasses, caramel and brown sugar. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D-awesomely drinkable at 9.3 it is remarkably smooth with a huge amount of hops. malt and booze to make any beer drinker happy"
"If you find this, don't make the mistake I made only buying one bottle. Hell, buy a case and age some of it. It's worth it."
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ach8ZbzqTg"
"When I reviewed Scratch 4 over a year ago, I lamented the fact that the recipe would never be brewed again; fortunately, the Troegs brothers came to their senses. This, to my tastes, is an epitome of American barleywine. A case of it should be locked away in a time capsule somewhere... I sure hope we'll continue to see this long into the future."
"Thank You Troegs"
"Scarlet plum appearance, murky brown half finger head diminished to an errant beige wispy, cloudy surface. Slow steady small bubble carbonation, ring and some lace. Excellent regeneration. Very pleasant sweet caramel nose. Taste is huge with candied caramel apple, English toffee, sweet yet dry with bakers' chocolate tones, high bitterness, especially in the aftertaste. High alcohol weighs in, there is nothing subtle about this beer, it's a barleywine lovers delight."
"Drinkability is good for a barleywine. I set out to do the bomber by myself and it is going down very nicely!!!"
"Drinkability was good. Overall another great beer from Troegs and one of the stars of the fest IMO."
"D - Had several of these last year when they first came out and was really impressed. The hops were so nice when it was fresh - definitely just an amped up Nugget Nectar (how can you go wrong with that???). After a year, the hops have mellowed quite a bit and has arguably made this a better barleywine. Fresh it was closer to an imperial IPA, now - definitely a barleywine...and a good one! Drinking really well right now...maybe another 6 months or so will tame the hops a bit more and make this absolutely perfectly balanced. Great beer fresh or aged, but at this point in time, aged is your only option (unless they make it again)."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a brown/ruby red color with about a half inch tan head. Head retention was low, but the lacing is good. Aroma is caramel malt, pine and citrusy hops, raisins, toffee and some brown sugar. The taste is similar to the aroma. There's pine and citrus hops, raisins, toffee, caramel malt and molasses flavors all noticable. Nice lingering bitter hoppy finish, too. Also, good balance between the hops and malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink, although I think this is more of a sipping beer. I'd buy this again, I thought it was a good overall brew."
"Great drinkability for the style. Overall another very good one from my hometown brewery (my real hometown that is, not where I currently live)."
"Impressive looking beer, clear garnet color with a large tan head with surprising lacing and retention for the style. Aroma is mildly sweet, malty, slightly boozy punch blended with mild pine hops. Reminds me a lot of Nugget Nectar, with a robust malt backbone, and at this point the hops are still present but greatly smoothed out. Medium body with soft carbonation and well managed alcohol. Obviously line between dipa and barleywine can be a thin one, especially with age and I'd describe this as what NN would be if it aged a little more gracefully. As mentioned by a few others, as this warms up, a mild tea like flavor from the hops also is present which I find rather pleasing. I wouldn't consider this an exceptional barleywine, but there's something unique and extremely drinkable about this."
"bomber split with the parents at Bierria Paradiso, Georgetown"
"Notes: Nothing extraordinary but a reliable and tasty take on US barleywines."
"Drinkability: Friends, there's absolutely no doubt about it, it's a hop-forward (and then some) American barleywine. So, when it comes to the b-wines, if you like'm warming and you like'm potently hoppy, then, go ahead, give it a try."
"D: A slow sipper that is best split. I prefer this Barleywine fresh"
"Drinkability - Flavors are very well balanced and melded. Noticeable alcohol at the end. Very sweet, filling beer. Great flavor makes this more drinkable than it otherwise would be."
"A somewhat cloudy dark root beer color with a fair light tan head and decent lacing. The aroma is a firm piney/herbal hop with a luscious malty base. Very nice and chewy. The flavor brings malt and licorice blended with good clover hop highlights. This is near a full bodied brew with silky feel and decent drinkability for the style. Very fine carbonation with a hop finish that lingers long and sure. It's a pleasure and great for drinking or with some sharp cheddar or other spicey food complements. Nice stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied with a good bite of carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is very dense and chewy. Very filling and perfect for an evening nightcap."
"D: Mostly a slow sipping beer, for me, one was enough, but it was a really tasty beer and one I am glad to try...maybe a gateway into more barleywines for me."
"This beer pours a large tan thick foamy head, good head retention accompanied by nice lacing. The beer itself is a dark brown with reddish hues. The aroma on this beer is rather nice, sweet caramel, with some nice spicy notes. Roasted barley, vanilla, hint of bananas, some roasted nuts. The flavor is even more complex and good. Large caramel and roasted nut flavor along with spicy alcohol, ripe fruit, and a nice balanced hop presence. This is a very tasty beer. This beer has a thick and silky mouthfeel with some nice hop bite in the end. I must say this is a very good beer. The first wheatwine I have ever had, and I would say it is a style I would like to see more of."
"Appears a deep clouded chocolate infused mahogany brown a bit dirty with yeast sediment, light khaki tan head forms evenly with lacing. My Gulden Draak chalice welcomes this barleywine from Troeg's talk about a long time coming. Aroma has loads of hops with a tobacco leaf earthiness, mild raisin and caramel malts drizzled across the hop bitterness, a nice sugar coated layer with an air of alcohol and alluring spicy herbal hop waves with a touch of lingering layers of cocoa. Flavor equals a clash of crystal malt tones with juicy caramel brown sugar candy coated heavy handed herbaceous hops. Wicked east coast hop explosion with bitter waves of glory more dirty and earthy tobaccco layers arising straight from the womb of mother earth. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied never cloying with either sweetness or hop bitterness a nice clash of the two brings balance in epic proportions with an even pleasant flow of carbonation dectected with each sip. Drinkability is dangerous for me a quality brew that I will always remember as the Flying Mouflan, I would like to session with this brew but I guarantee it would put a hurting on me."
"Nicely balanced and complex."
"Bottle courtesy of tpd975, thanks again. Pours deep copper with thin off white head. The aroma is resiny with a mix of orange hard candy and cherry hard candy to go along with pine hop bitterness. The taste has a load of pine hops mingling with sweet orange candy and a bit of cherry hard candy goodness. I get smooth slick sweet malts midway and to the finish. Lots and lots of hops making this practically an IIPA. Yum! Very nice stuff. The pine hop bitterness just hangs on forever into the after taste."
"Six months in the cellar was clearly not enough for this beer. Putting too much age on this however might result in a flat sticky mess. (The carbonation in my example was already quite low.) This definitely needs some careful cellaring to unveil its true potential."
"Pours reddish amber with a thin head that settles to a ring. Smells of a slightly fruity hoppiness, but with a light touch. The taste is more satisfying with deep citrusy and tropical fruit hop notes, and some sweet alcoholic notes as well. Goes down rich, sweet, and with enough lingering bitterness to balance. Quite nice."
"Well, it's no surprise that this is an excellent beer as I thought the Scratch 4 was one of the best beers in Troegs portoflio. I stand by that statement with this one. Excellent."
"A terrific barleywine from Troegs and perfect for the coming of fall."
"D - A terrific beer, but if I could find one area for improvement in the lovely brew, it would be for it mellow out slightly... Aging one of these is recommended... Aside from that, this is an absolutely terrific and unique taste on the barleywine..."
"D: Very good for a barleywine of this strength."
"Well done Troeg's...now just do more...."
"Poured a maroon with a beige head. Nose is bitter, grainy, sugars, candied fruits. Taste is sugar, syrup, not to complex. Was not that hot of a beer. There was a slight sourness to this beer as well. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick for a bwine. Worth trying but not one of my favorites."
"D- for the style, and for the ABV, I would consider it drinkable. I don't think I could have another glass tonight, but if I can find more bottles, I will buy them right away."
"Drinkability- Good. But one is enough at almost 10% Seek out if you can find, apparently this was a limited run"
"Pours a slightly murky reddish brown, thick off white head forms, settles to a thin ring and leaves some lace spots on the glass. Smell is nice, pine and caramel, very fresh aroma, wood, grapes, alcohol, biscuit, grapefruit and floral, toffee, quite rich, very nice. Taste is good, toffee, grapefruit, light pine, touch of chocolate, raisin, floral, biscuit, vanilla, nice hoppiness, very rich, good balance. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, ABV is well hidden but there is some warmth, a real nice barleywine. Thanks!"
"Drinks far too easily!"
"Would recommend"
"Perfect for having a sipper on the back porch after dark."
"D: It's a bit of a brute, but a tasty one."
"Drinkability is pretty damn good for the size and style of these beer. Balanced in a way that's deceptive and very tasty."
"This is surely something I would search out again, drink without hesitation and want to have on hand at all times during the fall and winter. Easily one of the best barleywines I've ever experienced, at least for my tastebuds."
"D - Aging would rellt help the drinkability of this beer. Nice barleywine, but just a little too hot and hoppy. With aging this beer would mellow out quite a bit. This sample was fresh, about a month old."
"Pours dark mahogany with a silky tan head. Nose has bitter hops, fruity malts and caramel. Taste also has lots of sweet candy malts that are well balanced by fruity hops. Big, creamy body has a crisp carbonation. Nice resiny hops in the finish. Good stuff,should age quite well."
"Drinkability: The heat in the finish was distracting, but I don't think that would be noticed within standard serving types (draft or bottle). Pretty nice sipper!"
"D - A great tasting barleywine. The hops really pack a punch."
"Pours a hazy dark amber to brown in color with a good sized creamy, light tan head that slowly recedes. Aroma shows some ripe berries along with a good dose of citrusy hoppiness, strong grapefruit. Some caramel in the aroma as well. Taste follows and is dominated by a big hoppiness up front, lots of tangerine and citrus notes, some sweet maltiness and berry notes come in mid taste, but are mainly a quick flash before the citrusy hops kick back in, in a grape-fruity finish that mixes with a little toasted bread flavor. Mouthfeel is outstanding, big body, but not heavy, rather nice and creamy feel mixes very nicely with the hoppy flavors and bitterness in the finish. Decent hoppy bite at the finish, slightly drying, alcohol is pretty well hidden. A very good hoppy barleywine, extremely drinkable, I am sure the malts will eventually become the showcase, but this beer drinks incredibly well fresh right now."
"The best barleywine I've had so far."
"D-Fresh, like this one it's a DIPA. put some age on it and it turns into a barleywine. While I like it more fresh, I did a side by side with an aged Scratch 4 and well...it tastes pretty damn good too! Either way hard to go wrong. IMHO this is one of the best beers Troegs has ever made. A fine concoction of hops and malt!"
"HV"
"Future outlook: An interesting and enjoyable deviation of a barleywine that I will be happy to try again."
"This is not somthing I could call traditional, based on what I've tasted in other American Barleywines, but its an exceptional take on the style and very enjoyable. Drinkability has a slite cut in it due to some of that warming. A little more sweetness after the swallow would have helped to mask that, helping this be a real easy drinker. It is definatly a sipper, but a great beer too."
"D: I'd say this is a pretty drinkable barleywine. If you enjoy fresh Bigfoot this will be right up your alley. I can only imagine how well this would age."
"Wow. Spectacular beer & one of the best straight-up barleywines I've ever had - the hops just reload the taste into a different stratosphere. Grasping for a reason not to give this an A+. I simply can't find one. Wow."
"A good beer that would benefit with age."
"nice stuff, but eventually the resins will get to you, cutting down on drinkability."
"Drinkability: For the style? Fantastic. Absolutely no hint of the 9.3% to be found, though this one does have a little bit of age on it. The flavors are fantastic, the appearance very nice, and everything else solidly solid. Definitely recommended."
"Pours a dirty orange/brown color with a large tan/orange head, a crazy looking head indeed. Very aromatic hops grace the nose, booze soaked citrus fruits, pine, very sweet malt. Mild alcohol heat while tasting, bacon? Bready, boozy fruity yeast esters through out, some plum and mild spice lots of hops, boarder line DIPA rather than barley wine IMO. Lots of NN hop character, which is great! Good drinkability for the style, the bomber would be an ideal serving size, even for a beer of this magnitude. Highly recommended, especially for those new to the style, this is a great bridge between the world of DIPA into the world of Barley Wine. I would consume as fresh as possible..."
"22 ounce bottle received in a trade, thanks who sent this but I already forgot unfortunately, supposed to be nearly identical to the Scratch 4 beer they made a few years ago but seems to be slightly different, dark red with some brown mixed in, big one off white head, great retention, nice lacing at times too, smell consists of toffee, berries, caramel, pine, bread, plums, booze, raisins, floral accents, and honey, starts off with caramel along with other rich malts, mild sweetness and boozy fruits in the middle, pine and floral hops in the finish, nicely balanced like a good barleywine should be going from sweet to dry and vice versa, dry, sweet, and slightly warming mouthfeel, taste lasted a long time, medium carbonation, along with a medium body, pretty smooth for its style, could have probably drank the whole bottle, alcohol is hidden for the most part until the aftertaste, would drink again, glad to have a few in my cellar to experiment with, recommended"
"Big bodied, noticeably viscous in the glass. A very nice, and somewhat unique, American Barleywine. One is reminded perhaps of an RIS (Storm King comes to mind) or maybe another favorite style."
"D: It was the lowest ABV barleywine that we drank and the alcohol was hidden EXTREMELY well. For the style, this is near the top."
"This may be a new favorite! Extremely great drinkability, astonishing palate, great mouthfeel, nothing I would change. Try it if you have access."
"Troegs describes this beer as ""if you took nugget nectar and pushed it off a cliff"" I would say that is about as accurate as you can get. This is considered an American style barleywine, and that it is. With 9.3% abv, it's not a beer you will be enjoying all afternoon/evening, but it does mask the alcohol flavor quite well. The beer itself is a light mahogany color with hops hops hops in the nose. This is one of the more hoppy barlywines I have had the pleasure of trying. The taste is complex with notes of vanilla and chocolate as well as balanced bitterness from the hops. The mouthfeel is nice with all of the flavors blending smoothly and finishing slightly sweet. Overall, this is definitely a beer worth checking out, and it's a must for hop heads."
"Pours a solid brown with a nice deep maroon color when held up to the light. Smallish tan head that dissolves down to a fine film. Nose is strong spicy hops, fruity. Subtle malt presence. Flavor is similar, although a fair bit stronger. Sugary candy, with a spicy fruit hop presence up front. A touch of malt in there, but this is a hoppy beer (definitely more DIPA than barley wine, in my opinion). Body is fine - medium, appropriate for the brew. Nice carbonation. Overall, a solid beer that's good but not quite excellent (which I expect from Troegs's ""bigger"" beers, and especially a barley wine)."
"What an awesome Barleywine. The beer pours with a darker brown (less mohogany and ruby) than most, leading me to beleive a toasty melanoidin-rich Dopplebock malt profile awaits. Thick foamstance rises from the glass and provides a mousse-like barrier to plow through on my way to the first few sips. Serious malt aromas confirm the toasty, bready hints and provide dehydrated fruits of cherries, berries, apples, figs, dates, and raisons; but these all take a secondary role to the malts-- Think fruitcake. Flavors mirror the aromas exactly. Sweet but more malty keeps the beer from cloying or syrupy. The esters take on a rum-soaked taste and don't interfere with the rich malt flavors and textures. Hopped for flavor and bitterness, they provide more of a pine resin and orange zest taste. Very bready and becomming increasingly dry going into the finish, this beer is both well attenuated and creamy-rich. The malts take on an evaporative nature in the mouth, making drinkability a breeze. Hop bitterness accentuate the dryness in the finish and aftertaste. Perhaps a bit cleaner than the Bigfoots and Old Crustacian in the malts and esters, which makes this beer great at layering flavors and keeping confusion at bay."
"Pours a slightly hazy caramel brown under a dark tan one finger head that fades slowly to film and collar, leaving some nice lacing. The nose is lovely, combining sweet caramel and spicey hops in a very strong scent that invites from afar. The mouth is very prickly and quite sticky, almost to the point of being syrupy. The taste is marvellously rich, with equal portions chocolate and pine sap, blending across the tongue and lingering long after the swallow. Powerfully hopped, yet nicely balanced, the strength is also quite evident. This one might be too strong to finish a bomber alone, but Globetrotterette has already claimed the second pour for her own. As she does not normally like strong or hoppy beers, that is high praise indeed. Well done!"
"Pours a shade lighter than brown with deep copper/red highlights and a creamy off white head that dissipates to a cap. Right after I poured this the aroma was all hops. Resinous and floral hops. After a few minutes the hops gave way to slightly sugary, caramel malts, some toffee or brown sugar in there as well. Taste follows the aroma. Malty citrus bite up front, caramel and toffee peak through in the middle followed by a lingering somewhat dry resinous hop finish. Creamy mouthfeel, thick body, medium carbonation. Great Barleywine, quite hop forward ala Bigfoot. I wish I had bought 2 of these cause I'd love to open one next year."
"This is definitely one of, if not thee best American Barleywine that I've had. I love the duality of this, either being able to enjoy it has a huge hop bomb fresh or putting some time on it and letting the complexity of the malts emerge. Either way it's a winner."
"a good barleywine, very hoppy which personally appeals to me. quite rich so this is a slow sipper."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with a nice big oil slick, and some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight toffee, slight spice. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some nice hop notes, toffee/spice. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice brew, glad to get a chance to try it, thanks Brian."
"A little sweeter than other barley wines I have recently tried including SN Bigfoot, Great Divide Old Ruffian and Victory Old Horizontal. Next year I will definitely pick up more than one bottle."
"I was unsure about whether to let this bottle age a bit or drink it fresh, as I only bought a single bottle.. So after about a month and a half to two months I gave in and opened.. What I found was a sort of Bigfoot-esque barleywine; very hoppy and very sweet. The pour was beautiful - much darker than expected, a deep burgundy, very red. Smells is very, very sweet hop aroma, but the smell isn't really too strong if smelled from snifter, you have to smell it right out of the bottle to get it. Very sweet backbone of sugary sweetness. The flavor is like a DIPA with a more potent sweetness, very citrusy as well. Mouth is fairly thick, almost chewy. A bit syrupy, but good. Its certainly delicious and nice to sip on. Could you session it? probably not. But its definitely great. I certianly wish I had a second bottle to try in another few months."
"Bombers of 9.3%? I'll take one, but I think that's enough."
"Solid, thick, slick mouthfeel. Lighter on the carbonation. Slightly bitter and sour aftertaste. Alcohol burn is noticeable, but not overwhelming. Decent brew, but not the jog down memory lane I was hoping for."
"This one was way past prime."
"D - With the exception of the ABV...this beer is very drinkable...I love the cross between IPA and Barleywine...Troegs has done it again!"
"The Flying Mouflan is another big winner from Troegs. Damn, those guys make great beer. To be honest, if you're a Barleywine fan, there's very little here that's not to love. Its best assets are its great hop flavor and incredible balance. It doesn't lean too far in one direction at all. I also like the fact that the dark fruit is somewhat restrained. At times, that can be a turnoff for me if it's too strong. Troegs got it just right with this one. This is great beer. Trust me. Go find a few bottles. You'll be super glad that you did."
"If you are a fan of aging barleywines - this one is big and hot right now. Grab one of these and throw it in your cellar for a year."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a killer hop nose along with a solid burnt toffee aroma. It has a nice roasted scent with some excellent caramel notes. The taste is good. It has a very bitter hop bite that lends itself well to the malt base. However, the chocolate roasted character is overpowered with the hops. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. I'm not completely sold on the grain bill, but the hops are a nice touch."
"I'll be back."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, bitter with hops and sweet malt that feels sweet."
"Thanks fellas for coming through in a pinch... After these couple of trades... I need to keep a Xmas card list. :-)"
"Medium bodied with a smooth and creamy feel that makes it a pleasure to drink."
"Smells of hops, malt, and slight alcohol with a touch of chocolate. It is fairly bitter, but it is thick enough and sweet enough to balance it out. There is a bit of a bitter aftertaste that doesn't quite work for me."
"D: I can't thank Bill enough for sending me this very nice ""Barleywine"" from Troegs. I just wish they were available here."
"Drinkability- So drinkable the alcohol is a kick i n the bucket despite the high number, its just so smooth and so balanced, could drink this all nite, such a great hop finish yet such a great malty sweetness, balance and flavor are both great on this, great beer and very unique beer by troegs one you definitely want to try if you can, and would be very interesting to see age"
"This poured a hazy dark mahogany with a bit of tan head. It smelled like strong juicy pineapple, with some mango and grape and milk chocolate. It tasted like a beautiful blend of pineapple, mango, and grape hops with some milk chocolate and sweet caramel. It was fairly thick with a hint of carbonation, and had a sweet and tart aftertaste. Overall this had a very clean taste that was super flavorful and delicious. Nice body too, and very easy to drink. The alcohol was noticeable, so this beer might mellow out even more and improve with some age. But it's already so good fresh. I'd love to try this side by side with Nugget Nectar, because they seem have a lot of similar flavor elements. Mouflan just takes it one step further, which is simply magnificent."
"Medium bodied with low-medium carbonation."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a HUGE stiff light tan head. Spotty patterns of lacing build when served warmer. The smell has an aggressive fragrant piny hop and grassy character...can't say that's ""to style"" but you've gotta love it! The mouth feel is tangy yet full bodied and creamy. The complexity adds to the drinkability. The piny grapefruit hoppy flavor laced with chocolate notes is original and intense. An absolutely wild combo! The 9.3% ABV is well integrated. Talk about Nugget Nectar 'pushed over the edge""...good analogy!! Recommended."
"D: I could drink this reqularly. Fresh it was very good, but letting it age would be outstanding."
"Murky brown color that dosn't do much to impress but the thick head and sticky lacing promises better things to come. Smell of caramel, alcohol and some earthy to pine hops. Taste is sticky sweet up front followed by pine hop bitterness that holds on for a long time. Also some dark plum fruit flavors show. Some burn from the high ABV peaks through at the end. Complex, big, full flavored sipper. Nothing at all about this one is understated. Across the board good beer but something is preventing me from saying exceptional."
"Not sure I'd describe this as a barleywine, due to the hoppy character & lack of ""warming"" sensation. Not bad, but not totally sure what to make of it."
"D: Pretty good stuff. Not my favorite in the style, but a welcomed treat from the East Coast."
"D: Definitly a tongue grabbing and bitter experience, though seemed a little one dimensional flavor wise. While it was a pretty decent beer overall, a bomber is sure to suffice."
"Semantics aside, it pours a dark brown with a small head and great lacing. Clearly loaded with nugget hops (I know this because of the vast lakes of nugget nectar I have drunk over the past three and a half months.) Lots of dark malt too. Results in a sweet somewhat grapfruity bouquet that tastes exactly like it smells. Gives a nice hop fix with sweet dark fruit and only a small bite betraying the 9.3% abv despite which it goes down way too easy."
"D: It's not extremely high to me but that should do no discouragement. I like the fresh, but the latter version should be a doozy. Recommended either way."
"Murky brown with a bit of a reddish hue. A thin beige cap of fine bubbles formed slowly during the pour. Spotty lacing, decent head retention. Ah... classic American barleywine aroma, lots of caramel and toffee with a healthy dose of pine and grapefruit. Fairly heavy on the citrus rind and pith without being too sharp, some tangerine too. Bitterness was balanced and really changed from start to finish. Up front it was in the background, allowing the sweet malts and caramel dominate. Mid-palate was where the hop flavour started to happen, again with the grapefruit and a bit of pine, lots of pith. Bitterness grew towards the end and really lingered, along with a mixed fruit basket of citrus goodness. Caramel and toffee were still present at this point, but had definitely taken a back seat to the hops. Full bodied without being overly heavy, carbonation was on the lower side making it fairly smooth. Some alcohol flavour and warmth in the finish. Pretty much exactly what I expect from a solid barleywine. Lots of malt, lots of hops, a bit aggressive, but still nice and smooth."
"Drinkability: Meh. Not my favorite beer from Troegs, that's for sure. It tastes alright, but the balance is a bit too far on the sweet side for my preference, but I can see why a lot of other people may like it."
"M/D - Full bodied with a very heavy feel in the mouth. A little too high on the carbonation, but not to the point that it really distracts from the beer. The alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming."
"Drinkability: Low to moderate at best. It is actually challenging to drink thanks to the boldness of the flavors and the heat of the alcohol."
"D: Overall a bit too malty and thick for me."
"Aroma is sweet, hoppy, and notes of alcohol. Taste starts with the same sweetness, citrusy fruitiness coupled with pine hops character, light numbing to close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is way easy. Could drink too much of this, for sure."
"D: There's no mistaking this for anything but what it is. American Barleywine, baby! Dry, bitter, and slightly raw but the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden."
"This is really a great beer, and one that I probably would like to have every now and again. One a night, though. I wouldn't want to get sick of it, because it's pretty unique and the alcohol content is deceiving. It's well priced at $7, at least in New York, and it keeps up with Troegs' other fine offerings."
"Medium carbonation and almost a little aggressive on the tongue at first but smooth and dry in the finish. Not a big fan of this style but this is quite tasty."
"Drinkability: A wonderful brew that fans of Barleywines and DIPAs need to find. I have another bottle, thankfully, that I'd like to age for about 4-6 months, thinking some chocolate might come in, since they do say something about it on the label that curls around the bottleneck. Get it if you can find it."
"Overall, a wonderful example of the style and one of the best versions that I've had actually. Highly recommended."
"I'm interested to see how this one ages."
"Drinkability- Never had a brew so hop forward with such little bitterness and big fruitiness. Not the biggest Barleywine fan of all time but I really do love this beer. It's dripping with hoppy goodness. Thanks much Adam!!"
"Thanks for Reading"
"This poured maroon with a frothy beige head. The aroma is similar to nugget nectar but more bitter. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste. The doughy breadlike malt flavor is tasty. This brew is thicker than nugget nectar and very barleywineish. The feel is moderate to thick, oily and smooth. Overall its not as flavorful as the nugget nectar, maybe its the extra (but not overdone for a barleywine) alcohol. Its not as balanced as the other troegs beers but its not supposed to be. Its an awesome offering."
"Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you see it."
"D: Very drinkable. Reminded me of Druid Fluid on cask which is a jewel. Very nicely done. Glad to see they are willing to bring some scratch beers back."
"A big brother to Nugget Nectar, it's one well balanced and easy drinking American barleywine. Certainly the quality you would expect from Troegs."
"Pours ruby brown in color with a nice inch of frothy off white head. Looks good. Smells even better. A nice blast of hops to start off with, then a nice rush of roasted malts and some spice. Taste is even better than the smell. I'm really digging this beer. Plenty of hops in the flavor, perfect. Full and robust in the mouthfeel. You have to refrain from crushing this beer, it is really that drinkable. There's no sign of the alcohol in this beer. It would be interesting to see what some age would do to this beer, but I think the fresh hop presence is what makes this beer what it is now. Very good beer, along with the Mad Elf, this is easily my favorite offering from Troegs."
"Pours dark plummy amber, murky under a dak tan head that leaves splotches of lace. Nose is of ripe fruit, musty hop oils and then some sweet maple. Strong and tasty brew. Bold strokes of resiny hops and repectable layers of maple malts. Some glimmers of boozy alcohol poke their heads up, but the smoothness and continuing melange of hops/malts follow through to make the finish line. Nice offering thats well worth a try."
"Suprisingly not as heavy as I would have expected it to be. Pretty big and dark beer, but goes down very smoothly and leaves a great after taste. Deffinatly my favorite beer brewed from the troegs brothers to date."
"Overall...very drinkable and very tasty with great potential for ageing. Wish I had more. A big thanks to Aaron for this treat!"
"I poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a snifter. It pours a deep caramel with a 2 finger white head. The aroma is sweet citrus with a pineapple chaser. This is a real hop bomb. Lots of sweet pine and citrus notes and a real sticky mouthfeel. The beer is medium bodied but feels fuller. The brew is a sipper. This one is better than I expected."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Pours hazy, opaque reddish with a fluffy head that falls to nice lacing. The smell is hugely hoppy - sweet, floral, a little pine. The flavor is sweet and strongly hoppy - floral with a little pine sting. The malt is sweet and rich and clean, a little bready with a nice amber ale kick. It almost has a cherry-like quality, with a bit of toffee and dark caramel. The bitterness delivers low and in the back of the throat and doesn't linger too long. The mouthfeel is a bit clingy, with a little zip of carbonation."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beers body is pleasantly full. The malt back bone is round and big. It makes me feel like Mix-Alot. ""I like em round and big."" The carbonation is low and this might be an issue for some but I like it with this beer. The drinkability is crazy. I had problems putting this beer down. I am honestly distressed how quickly I finished the bomber. Troegs you should really consider making this beer seasonally at the least. Thank you!..."
"Tastes mildly sweet, lots of citrus and pine hops. Very interesting barleywine, very complex and drinkable."
"certainly they are accurate - this is nugget nectar concentrate. i like..."
"Rather aggressive Barleywine, loaded with grapefruit from the hops, and a bit of sweetness from the large amounts of malts. Probably could afford to sit a bit, although I prefer these beers fresh. Recommended."
"Pours a solid brown color with a frothy tan head that settles into a sparse cap. The aroma is of juicy orange and grapefruit hops and a honey like sweet syrup. Grapefruit hop flavor starts things off flowing into a rindy/resiny bitter hop. A noticable malt backbone sits shotgun but helps balance out the bitter hop. A toasted character to the malt, with honey and a slight raisin flavor. The brew has a full body with enough carbonation to avoid being slick or syrupy, which is preferable to me. Seems to have more a malt presence than most barleywines, closer to an American Strong Ale. Finishes with a hoppy bitterness. A nice malty, hoppy barleywine, good mixture of hop flavor and bitterness."
"For a barleywine style ale, it goes above and beyond the norm."
"Overall, pretty good - I was expecting more malty sweetness based on the smell. I'll let my other bottle age a few months to see if the bitter flavors subside"
"-Oelergud"
"d: One of my all-time favorites that I feared I would never try fresh again. A stunningly great beer."
"D: Not a huge barleywine but still definitely a sipper. I really like the hops profile in this but I think a year or so will do the malt backbone some good."
"This beer poured a very dark murky reddish amber color and formed a huge light tan foamy head. An aroma of malt, hops and hint of caramel. The flavor was of malt, hops, caramel, and a hint of plum. The body is medium and the finish is bittersweet with a slight bit of astringency."
"Troegs bomber, $7.99 at Palmers in Columbus. The bottle says ""this ale is like pushing our Nugget Nectar off the side of a cliff. Tastes like hops dipped in candied sugar and rolled in dark chocolate nibs"". I like the sound of this. The beer is very dark as compared with Nugget Nectar, hazy auburn / dark orange-brown with thick creamy tan foam. Actually it looks a lot like Aventinus (but the aroma and taste are completely different). The aroma is hoppy as hell, it does indeed smell like a very strong version of Nugget Nectar. The taste is less appealing (but still good), very sweet as if candi was added instead of more hops. I guess this makes it more barley-winey as it adds fermentables, but I was hoping for more of a DIPA style. The mouthfeel is thick, very coating. I have another which will probably cellar for 1 year to see how the malt develops out as the hops mellow. But maybe I'll trade it before it gets that far."
"D - Perhaps the line is erased like a pink rubber eraser on graphite between Strong IPA(IIPA) and American barleywine, but who cares about style, right? Not Troeg's thank God, for good reason-If it tastes good, brew it. An All around world class beer, but not as an everyday beer. A beer to savor and sip, but it is well worth the attention A phenomenal tasting beer. I am so glad this made it into the rotation"
"This was pretty easy to drink for such a big beer"
"d - it's good, and pleasant. Definately like it but didn't blow me away. I do have a slight cold, however."
"I enjoyed and would drink again, but would share a 22 next time."
"Overall, this is a great beer. An interesting barleywine, but a great beer. Reminds me of an Imperial Nugget Nectar as it has similar qualities."
"After reading reviews on it before even opening it, I only put it in the fridge for a little bit. Better warm This beer is deffinatly one of the better balanced barleywines ive ever had. I like the little spicey kindy malt i get from it. With age I think the malt character will get alot more complex!!The choclate nibs i think must have given it the different choclate malt im tasting. I wanna look into choclate nibs i used powder coco once didnt effect it much I Gave it a(A) Drinkin the 22 oz bottle made me feel warm and fuzzy good stuff!! I can deffinatly taste the nugget warrior tommahawk combo or maybe one left out. Overall im never dissapointed with any troegs product."
"D - Reminds me of Nugget Nectar with more of a malt background. I love super hoppy beers, but the addition of malts and whatever to change this NN like beer into a barleywine lowers the drinkability so much. One of my favorite examples of the style, but I just don't dig it that much."
"D - The finish and balance makes this a dangerously drinkable and resippable beer. Share one...or lock yourself in your room with this one."
"It is very nice to see some of Troegs bigger beers arrive here. This was bought at Colonial Spirits in Acton Mass. Color on this beer is rosy, with not too much in the way of heading. Smell is very hoppy, with some notes of chocolate and candy sugar (as indicated by the label) buried beneath the hop profile. The hops have a very nice spicy aroma to them. Flavor is really hoppy, but with a nice underlying element of fruit and tobacco. It ends on a very dry, bitter note. Body is medium, which is cool considering all the flavor coming out of this brew. As tasty as this is, the alcohol can be felt easily with this beer. I would recommend sharing this one with a friend or two. Troegs hit a home run with me on this beer. I love the fact that it is sort of a difficult to classify beer. There are aspects of Barleywine and DIPA here, and it truly manages to tread right in the middle of the two. I cannot say enough positive things about this beer. If you see it, definitely get some. Cheers"
"D- This one is flying right now and could use a lower altitude so im going to store a bottle for two years and see what flies. Either way its great to try a fresh bottle for hopheads or B-wine lovers as this one has a nice mix of both. I guess I did not know what I was getting into, but it was a beautiful ride."
"D: One bomber of this potent 9%+ brew is sufficient. Welcome back, old friend."
"poured about half of a bomber into a pint glass. about a half inch white head went away quickly. nice lace. red-brown in color. hoppy aroma accented with sweetness. my first sip I was not very impressed. as I let the beer warm it progressively got better. it is litterly like taking nugget nectar and mad elf and putting them into one glass without the honey and cherries. I must say I am not big on barleywines but this is exceptional. the mouthful is smooth, light on acid and carbonation. I said it before and I'll say it again the troegs brothers don't fuck around. good job boys!!"
"I grabbed another bottle and put it away for a winter night next year. It should age well, very well."
"Notes: Very impressed with this new one (albeit actually being just a changed name) from Troegs. They say it pushed NN off a cliff. Not too sure on the wording but overall it's pretty awesome. While maybe being classified as a ""Hop Bomb", the overall balance is nearly perfect. Definitely gonna be buying more of this in the future."
"Notes: This one is best at cellar temp, too cold gets harsh but at cellar or even room temp it is out of this world. Troegs continues to get better and better. This one rivals any west coast hop monster. Thanks to the bros for the scratch series."
"This is a very serious barleywine, one that is very reminiscent of Stone's Old Guardian and Lagunitas Olde Gnarleywine. However, it has an even more outrageous hop profile on the nose, which gives the beer an added dimension. Very impressive."
"Fantastic effort from Troegs. As with Nugget Nectar this beer almost crosses style. Is nectar an dipa in disguise? The case for The Flying Mouflan as a IIPA could be made as well. Huge dose of hops, balanced by a massive injection of malty, sugary goodness."
"D: Dangerously easy drinking - or perhaps I just had a long day. It goes down amazingly smooth and easy, considering the alcohol content. Not really hot at all, but I'd still be interested in trying it with a couple or few months on it, as well."
"Overall- More mellow than expected but thats a good thing."
"This is just an outstanding beer. I'm glad they decided to take this Scratch brew and make it a full production one. It's just outstanding; the best barleywine I've ever had. Unlike most barleywines I really can't see aging this brew doing much for it; I'm certain it would still be very good, but the fresh, juicy hop flavor is what makes this truly special. Get it quick and drink it fresh!"
"The Flying Mouflan drinks bigger and badder than 9.3%. I would have guessed 11%. A sipper, but one that I can't seem to get enough of."
"Thanks to Deuane for opening a bottle of the Mouflan during his recent tasting party. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my glass. Appears a dark apricot color with about a finger of off white head. I really don't know what to think about this beer. Is it a barleywine or a DIPA? Whatever it is, it's delicious. The first thing that enters my mind after smelling and tasting is this beer is I've found Nugget Nectar's granddady. Nugget Nectar concentrate in a bottle, if you will. Smells and tastes of resinous, skunky (the good kind), sticky super fresh hops. Notes of caramel and brown sugar are present, but the hops keep everything in nearly perfect symmetry. Just about full bodied with medium carbonation. For my tastes, this is a toss up between Moflan and Naked Elf for the best beer ever to come out of the doors on Paxton Street."
"Cheers."
"A different take on a barleywine that works very well, with a tasty, complex maltiness with a nice hop showing. ""Big", but very approachable. A treat, indeed!"
"Average drinkability due to the strong flavors and high ABV..."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Right up there with the best barleywines that I've had. Probably the most drinkable too. It's nice to see another great offering from Troegs!"
"Interesting experiment from Troegs. It walks the line between an DIPA and a Barleywine quite well, however it's not a path I would want to walk often, a nice departure though. Label also notes coca nibs in this one. This was one taste I couldn't find in it. Maybe some time to age will bring this out."
"Pours reddish brown with off-white head that leaves plenty of lacing. Fruit tang aroma with hops that give off pine and sugary sweets displaced throughout. Taste is fruit tang, candied fruit, citrus, syrup, with some alcoholic boozy undertones. Light carbonation with a slick oily mouthfeel. Drinkability takes a shot when the fruit tang builds up discouraging me from taking another sip. This is a good nightcap that could go well with flan but other than that a bit too syrupy sweet for my liking."
"Don't drink and review."
"A thick, caramel covered, sugar crystalled malty bitter hop bomb...with plent of malt to balance. Zesty fruit; strawberry and fig blend into a thick syrup. A light carboation feeds into the thick body and plenty of sugar surfaces. The aroma and appearance are unbeatable pastries. Candied center with a pinching fruit yeast contribution. Too sweet for me, and at times a bit artificially-flavored complex."
"Usually I'm not a big fan of barley wines, but this is a different beast. It's like a mixed monster 1/2 barley wine 1/2 imperial IPA, which makes a delicious combo. I'm aging another bottle for a year since this beer is supposed to transform as it ages and the hops mellow out. I'll update the review then."
"D: Quite drinkable. While I prefer to drink just one of these slowly, I could definitely see drinking more than just one."
"D - This straddles the line between American Barleywine and DIPA. Scratch #4 is the beer that really got me into the barleywine style, so needless to say it was indeed a pleasure to experience this phenomenal brew again. I am glad I purchased a whole case of this. Aside from Nugget Nectar, this is probably the best brew Troegs has ever concocted. Simply put, this is an amazing beer."
