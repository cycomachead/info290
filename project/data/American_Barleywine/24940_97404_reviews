"Acidity is kicking in on my 2014 bottle. The tartness somehow works with the pumpkin and brady barrel. Not sure if this an infection or a Brewers intention but it works."
"a strong presence of pumpkin spice is the dominant flavor with very mild brandy barrel. doesn't really taste much like a barleywine but more like a pumpkin ale.. .also this must be the mildest 12% beer I've ever had.. alcohol is not perceivable. overall this has a nice balance and mouth feel and delivers good pumpkin spice flavor... one of the better pumpkin beers out there"

"As a couple other reviews have mentioned, my bottle was pretty sour which I didn't really expect. Still tastes decent but not at all what I was anticipating. Mine tastes a bit like a tart white wine with pumpkin pie spices."
""
""
"Slightly sour.  I had high hopes, was a bit of a letdown."
"A stodgy-looking orange-brown brew, sudsy and viscous, yields huge wafts of grainy sugars and holiday spice, propelled by ample alcohols volatiles.  It tastes as it should, pumpkin-y, resiny, oaky, but lactic acid and a prominent hop profile give this brew complexion and depth it's contemporaries often lack.  This is well crafted and tasty."
""
"I am not really a pumpkin ale man so this one was my cup of tea.  Decent head and nice lacing, no carbonation. Slight sourness and the barrel is far away noticable."
"Got in a trade with RaulMondesi. 375 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/4/2014. Pours hazy dark orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart cherry, pumpkin, green apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, red wine, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, oak, leather, vinegar, light vanilla, and oak/spice earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, spices, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big tart cherry, pumpkin, green apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, red wine, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, oak, leather, vinegar, light vanilla, and oak/spice earthiness. Fair amount of earthy spiciness and fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of cherry, pumpkin, green apple, caramel, brown sugar, toast, red wine, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, oak, leather, vinegar, and oak/spice earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, spices, and oak barrel flavors; with a good malt/spice/tartness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice pumpkin beer. I obviously got an infected bottle; but it still turned out very tasty with balanced malt, spice, and barrel flavors with the tart/fruity yeast notes. A very enjoyable offering even with the infection."

"Interesting take on a pumpkin ale. Lots of spice and pumpkin flavor. Slight peppery flavor which lessens as it warms leading to other spices. Definitely a complex take on a pumpkin beer. Not my favorite pumpkin beer, but definitely worth trying."
""
""
"Poured into a Firestone Walker snifter. Pours a hazy orange amber with a half finger light khaki head that dissipates slowly to a thick film with nice lacing. Nice holiday aroma of pumpkin, light brandy, caramel malt, faint pie spicing. Flavor is pumpkin, light caramel malt, cinnamon and clove, finishing lighter with some tartness; mild butteriness and pumpkin finish that is reminiscent of fresh pumpkin ready to baked into a pie. Medium bodied without the expected heaviness of a barleywine. A nicely made, well balanced pumpkin ale with a great interplay of malt and pumpkin and light, but distinct pie spicing. The light tartness was expected from this brewery that excels at sours, and seemed to be more a yeast flavor than rye (which I would have preferred). Not quite to my taste, but nicely made and flavorful as anticipated from Almanac. Brandy flavor is present, but I wouldn't have identified without prior knowledge. Interesting and festive."
"Thanks, c64person, for the opportunity"

"Excellent beer. Look reminds me of leaves falling from the tree. Smell is sweet with pumpkin and brandy. Taste is exceptional. Heavy on the pumpkin. Also taste vanilla and nutmeg and slight tartness. Feel is very thin. Can't believe it is 12%. Overall, this is an exceptional pumpkin/barley wine ale. Very great pumpkin flavor."
""
""
"Really good! Amber. Light spice, pumpkin smell. Spice, pumpkin, brandy, vanilla flavor that gets better as it warms. Thin. ABV is well hidden."
"Im generally not a huge fan of the style but this beer is hands down one of the best pumpkin beers Ive ever had. The flavor of brandy is slight & mixes very well with the vanilla, malts & roasty pumpkin flavors. The nose is sweet & slightly spicy. Even the color of the brew is a perfect light copper color. Very reminiscent of pumpkin. Although we hit double digit abv with this one, the alcohol is perfectly hidden. Very drinkable. A ""spooktacular"" beer."

"Really a remarkable creation by the folks at Farm to Barrel.   In 2013, this was one of my two most favorite pumpkin beers, and in 2014, it's at the top of the charts again!"

"Taste was similarly complex with boozy barrel elements upfront, sticky toffee and vanilla, with pumpkin spices of nutmeg and clove in the periphery. Full bodied and sticky, we split this 4 ways and that was enough, though i'd try it again if I saw it. Unique use of pumpkin for sure."
"Beautiful balance of pumpkin, pumpkin spice, rye barrel, and brandy barrel.  All the ingredients are very soft and natural tasting, and the barrel influence is paradoxically very present, and yet subtle and nuanced. Unlike even the better pumpkin ales I've enjoyed, this one is blissfully devoid of that perfumy, over-spiced character, and is redolent of real gourd goodness. Wow!"

"Boozy on the nose with  aromatics of cinnamon, nutmeg, oak, pumpkin sweetness.  Beautiful deep orange hues with good lacing when poured in a snifter.  taste I am hit with initial sweetness as well as some nice spice, and then it moves into the warmth and brandy notes and syrupy mouthfeel.  I love this beer.  I found Almanac at GABF and was very lucky to snag this bottle.  No rye detected.  Great beer."
""
"For a 12% barleywine, I was expecting a thick, dark, pumpkin-y brew.  Instead, I got a light, tart, pre-Thanksgiving holiday treat.  It's possible it was infected, because I'm not sure it was supposed to be tart, but I enjoyed it immensely anyway.  Appearance was standard for a pumpkin ale - a deep orange with a light fluffy head.  Nose had that slight tartness along with the pumkin and spices.  Taste had all the holiday spices you could ask for.  The tartness was definitely there, adding to the complexity of this beer.  I couldn't taste the 12% at all, like at all at all.  Mouth was medium to light with a pleasant amount of carbonation.  This was a masterpiece, accidental or not."

"Great beer I get a little scared when it comes to fruit or vegetable beers. I am not a fan of a beer with a overpowering dominant flavor. This beer pours with little to no head, a little lighter in color than maple syrup.  Very light in carbonation but the body is rich.  Lots of caramel flavors and fruity raisin/ fig. This beer is sweet but not overly sweet. Lots of different caramel flavors come out. Some oak vanilla and whiskey flavors are present as well. I really enjoyed this beer and the barrel ageing really does wonders for this beer."
""
""
""
"Very pleasant surprise, considering it's not even the beer I thought I had bought. My first experience with combining sour tendencies with a BW, and while it's not a perfect fit, it works for the most part. The pumpkin is an afterthought, and the brandy/rye aging, while interesting and a net positive, may be a little superfluous."
""
""
"Overall: First piece of advice let it warm up, it gets better and better as it closes in on room temperature. Complex taste, I know I said it before but I can't emphasize it. Grab a glass and indulge...salud!"

"Most pumpkin beers taste like pumpkin pie filling, while Almanac’s is reminiscent of a gourd cut open straight form the patch. As delicate and bright as Heirloom Pumpkin is, I’m not sure it’ll unseat Pumking as my preferred pumpkin ale. Almanac’s beer is brighter, tarter, and dewier. It’s also higher in ABV by nearly half. A tasty diversion, not a seasonal staple."

""
"Fleshy and meaty pumpkin, rich spicing, nutmeg, cinnamon, enveloped in sweet brandy heat...a really well done and enjoyable pumpkin-centric barleywine."
"O: 4.25 If you like flavored beers, this is a great example. The spices are strong and fresh, matching the beer very well. Like most spiced beers, it is a bit overwhelmed by the spices. However, there are still some interesting flavors going on while tasting like a big glass of fall."

"bottle from Beer Rev in Oakland - pumpkin spice flavors are well done. It's heavy, but it's not overly think or syrupy like some barleywines can get. Body and carbonation levels are spot on. Really nice. Recommended."

"The Pumking just lost his crown."
""
""
"t/m/o - SPOT ON!  Really well balanced barrel aged pumpkin.  The fact that it is a barleywine is not lost here. The pumpkin glazed over the caramel malt and then aged in brandy is simply the recipe to happiness.  I don't get much of the rye but here is definitely wood and the blend is like a softly cinnamonized pumpkin sangria.  Definitely check it out!"

"O: a finely crafted marriage between pumpkin ale and American barleywine - hops are dank and earthy, lots of wood and musk; clean, fresh tasting raw pumpkin flavors are elevated through spice and sugar; barrel characteristics come forward to say hello, and then slide into the background, keeping everything a little lighter, tighter, and airier than they would have been otherwise. Epic."
""
"I was completely surprised by this offering.  So spectacularly made, I have tried many pumpkin beers that, out of respect to the makers, I did not review as I was disappointed greatly.  This is the first pumpkin beer that excited me enough to want to seek out to have more.  I intend on buying and cellaring."
"Overall - a fantastic brew, well worth the usual Almanac price for this different experience"

"Autumn 2014 bottle. Smells terrific - caramelized pumpkin, dark crusty bread, brown sugar, and well integrated spices - cohesive blend of spices, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and dried ginger the most noticeable. Similar elements on the palate, along with flavors from the brandy and rye barrels which come through more than in the aroma. Spicy cigar tobacco. Nice depth and complexity. Sweet, but not overly so, and dries out in the finish as a touch of bitterness comes in. Lingering old liquor barrels, tobacco, and spice, quite tasty."
"Oh my. This is delicious. A good deal more nuance than most pumpkin beers and much less sweetness and in-your-face buttery or sweet pumpkin flavor than Pumking or Schlafly's Pumpkin beer. Extremely smooth and drinkable - not at all a sipping beer despite the 12% abv. I agree with an earlier review that the flavor and aroma is unique. Just outstanding."

"The beer pours a gorgeous dull tarnished copper color with flecks of gold when held to the light. It's topped by a razor thin, off-white head that settles quickly into a halo around the perimeter. Surprisingly (for an almanac beer), there is no sediment. The nose is overwhelming spices and brandy upfront (mainly clove and ginger), but has notes of brown sugar and earthy gourd/yam sweetness as well. Though there is a slightly booziness in the nose, it's not unpleasant and helps amplify the beer's spice profile. The taste has the same brown sugar/pumpkin pie sweetness upfront, which transitions quickly into a boozy, caramelized, pumpkin spice bomb for the finish. The beer has a rounded, sweet, full body cut with pungent pie spices, alcohol, and adequate carbonation. There are lingering pie spices coat the palate and take their time fading. This is an absolutely killer combination of pumpkin beer and barleywine, can't wait to have it again."

"O: I was blown away by this one. Probably the best pumpkin beer I've had the pleasure of drinking. Can't wait to see how this ages further."
""
""
""
""
"O: there is a lot here for people that like sours and Belgians (more Belgian than sour, to be honest) but I am unfortunately not a fan of either. It is pretty balanced. This unfortunately is not my thing, but I can tell why a lot of people would like it, so I didn't too harshly dock it."

"Pours a hazy dark orange with thin head and significant lacing. The nose is heavy on brown sugar and pumpkin flesh. This melds well with the rich malty barleywine malt bill. Some notes of cinnamon and pumpkin spice towards the end. This has a much more earthy and less spicey aroma than your typical pumpkin brew. The taste is ridiculously smooth for such a high gravity beer. Copious amounts of pumpkin flesh come through on the flavor with plenty of brown sugar along with it. The brandy barrel comes through and brings a bit of vanilla and caramel through while mellowing out the malts. The barleywine actually seems to be an appropriate base for the pumpkin treatment. Mouthfeel is thick and low on carbonation. Overall, another winner from almanac!"

"O - Overall, this one was tough. I really dont think it smelled or drank like a barleywine. Was far too easy drinking for the ABV. The pumpkin and brandy are balanced out exquisitely. Wish I had another bottle."
""
"O: pretty drinkable barleywine, the 12% abv is masked nicely with the sweetness from the pumpkin and the brandy."
"O- Pumpkin beers are usually hit or miss for me, there's a lot that I hate (mostly because they are over-spiced) and a few that are done just right that I really enjoy. While this beer by no means blew me away it was well done for what it is. It was nice and smooth and had a nice balance between the pumkin, yams, and spices. The brandy played a little bit more of a subtle roll then I would have liked but did a good job smoothing everything out and adding an additional balance. I wouldn't recommend this beer for everyone but it's definitely an interesting try especially if you're into pumpkin beers."
"O- A well done barleywine that would trend my taste buds toward barleywines and not away from them."
""
""
""
"Verdict: I really enjoyed this, a creative and innovative take on a pumpkin beer. The brandy barrel works wonderfully and the spicing is executed extremely well. It's still a dominantly sweet beer, but one of the better pumpkin beers I've had to date, and one of the better barrel aged barleywines at that matter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours an amber grapefruit color. It glows, with a thin layer of foam. I get a distinct pumpkin aroma—clearly reminiscent of roasted, steamed pumpkins rather than any sort of holiday spicing dominating. The flavor has a definitive bitterness, with pumpkin and pine in contrast. Freakin’ fantastic as a barleywine—and as a pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very unique and well executed. Don't see many (okay, any) brandy barrel pumpkin barleywines. Surprisingly well executed in fact. Brandy is sharp to begin with but mellows out just right through the progression of flavors. Not a spice bomb like so many pumpkin ales. Good combination of complexity, balance and uniqueness. A must-try."
""
""
""
"D: This is a really nice holiday brew. Nothing mind blowing but the pumpkin flavors taste fresh and I especially like the base barleywine which is loaded with caramel and nougat."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great and different mix of flavors. Great stuff."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a really cool beer; a good barleywine with a little bit of a twist. Loads of good caramel and toffee. The pumpkin is nice is the nose and lighter in the taste, which works well and I kind of prefer. Worth checking out, would love to have it again."

"O: Great offering from Almanac. You can sense the care taken. I would also love to cellar 1 or 2 of these for the future."
"Bottle at Stone beer garden. Pours a deep clear orange with barely any white head and some nice lacing. Aroma of massive pumpkins, caramel malts, and some nice cinnamon and nutmeg that is there but not overpowering the aroma. Flavor is sweet up front, big pumpkin flavors, caramel malts, some cinnamon and nutmeg spice on the finish that keeps this from being extremely sweet. I assume the sweetness comes from the brandy barrels. Really nice lingering finish of vanilla whipped cream, almost like they planned it this way like a spoonful on top of my pumpkin pie. Slick palate but surprisingly light bodied, low to medium carbonation. This is as unique as it gets, and pretty amazing."
""
""
"M - Full body. Light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"as complex as a pumpkin beer can probably be. blended pumpkin barleywine and spiced ale aged in brandy barrels, its incredible. runny looking orange hued copper liquid without a ton of head but a lot of stature, patient looking and confident in personality. a nose of sweet English and American barley malt on the caramel/toffee spectrum, lots of fall spice, musty oak, black pepper, alcohol, and pumpkin pie notes. the flavor is all of those things, the heat and silk from the brandy comes through, definitely an after dinner type of beer here. the alcoholic strength is intense as it warms up, but it stays somehow soft and mellow in feel, even with a lot of body. spice and sweet go back and forth on the finish, the pumpkin itself is in the background throughout, never really dominating, but always contributing a sweet squashy flavor. without much carbonation it feels almost like a liqueur, and it drinks a lot like one. perfectly appropriate Halloween night beer, like no other! clever and superbly executed, I need to try more from these guys."

"This is a medium to full bodied brew with modest carbonation. A huge sipper that caught me offguard with my first sip. Enjoyable and complex but a real kick in the pants. If I had a chance at another bottle of this, I would probably tuck it away and forget anout it until next year. It is quite boozy but rounded enough to be enjoyed now if you dont mind the alcohol burn."

"Overall - Good but not amazing."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body on this beer is about medium, maybe slightly less. Carbonation is moderate. Back end and finish is a bit dry which seems misplaced. All in all mouthfeel is okay though. Overall, I was definitely a fan of this beer. One of the best pumpkin beers I've had. Very rich flavors and no glaring weaknesses. Make an effort to try this if you can. Probably the best pumpkin beer that I have had to date."
"Pours a lovely copper with a thin, off white head that dissipates quickly. Decent lacing. Brandy hits the nose front and center, followed by dark fruit, molasses, and faint vanilla notes. The taste is amazing - raisins, roasted pumpkin, malt that finishes with vanilla and brandy. Layered and complex. Some alcohol warming. Finishes sweet and boozy. Creamy mouthfeel with light carbonation. Overall, this is a dessert in a glass. Extremely well crafted, it's the perfect accompaniment to a cool autumn evening."
""
""
"Big thanks to MillerBuffoon for saving and sharing this one with me. This poured out as a brownish amber color with some highlights of gold. There was a cream colored head that forms on top, it slowly drops and leaves a nice coating over the beer. There is a scattered lacing on the glass as well which is very nice. The smell of the beer is earthy, it's got a good amount of spice to it with plenty of booze too. The flavors is awesome, the flavors at first aren't much to rave about but they really come out as the beer settles on the taste buds. This is loaded with sweet malt and earthy pumpkin followed up by some of the best spice balance I've ever tasted in a pumpkin style beer. The brandy barrel aging isn't dominant at all but probably adds to the flavors in some way. Incredible flavors though, hard to describe perfection but I think this has it. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium to heavy, it's got plenty of body for the style and a very nice carbonation. Overall this was excellent as a Pumpkin Barleywine and that is primarily how I'm looking at this. It's more than just an American Barleywine to me. This is something everyone should try, I will be looking to get more of this."
""
""
"Overall: This is easily in my top 5 pumpkin beers that I have drank. I love it when ever a brewer uses brandy barrels. They really did a fantstic job on the barrel aging of this beer and showed the deversity of a brandy barrel. Another great Almanac beer that impresses!"

"Reddish caramel, dark, moderate foamy sandy head, nice lacing. Spicy nose, lots of clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Soft alcohol and what smells like the advertised Brandy. Spices aren’t as strong on the tongue. Instead its a rich malty and candied toffee background. Barrel aging is noticeable, and compliments the beer well. Very smooth, balanced, not over done with spices, warming, a bit chewy at times. Moderate to full body and mouthfeel."

"Overall: The best pumpkin beer I have tried. You can tell there is a great barrel-aged barleywine in there too. The pumpkin just brings it to a whole new level. It's a little boozy, but should mellow out beautifully with time. [4.50]"

"O - This barleywine is another great one from Almanac. Probably my new favorite barleywine. Very drinkable and I enjoyed it thoroughly. After drinking this, I bought a few bottles to cellar. This was just a memorable beer that makes my mouth water just thinking about. And I am not even a pumpkin kind of guy. Only reason I did not give it a 5 right now is because I know this will get better with some age."

"T: A nice blend of pumpkin flesh and spicy sweetness. Hints of pumpkin pie, nutmeg, cinnamon. Definitely more of a pumpkin nut loaf flavor than pumpkin pie flavor. The brandy is there, but it's really an afterthought, which I kind of like because I'm not what you would call the biggest brandy fan. Really well done."

"Pours an almost clear, reddish amber color with a small, off-white head that goes down quickly. Scent is OUT OF THIS WORLD! So inviting...smells absolutely delicious. Fresh pumpkin pie and sweet Thanksgiving spices...nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice. The amount of pumpkin that shines through the aroma of this beer is ridiculous! Hefty amount of Brandy as well, but doesn't smell like it's going to be too hot. Taste is just as it smells. Magnificent. Sweet brandy and barrel characteristics up front, immediately followed by the Thanksgiving/Autumn spices. Sweet pumpkin pie and cinnamon. Lovely, boozy brandy flavors. Reminds me of a pumkin loaf I had one time that was made with Brandy. Oh man, I don't see it getting any better than this when it comes to pumpkin beers. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and slightly sticky. Drinkability is high. Overall, this may just be the best pumpkin beer I've ever had. It's absolutely delicious! I know this beer has great reviews, but I GUARANTEE you...once this beer catches the beer nerd buzz...it will be the most sought-after pumpkin beer out there. Spot on in every way."

"Pours a hazy copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, pumpkin pie, canned pumpkin, spices, and brandy aromas. Taste is much the same with pumpkin pie and brandy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with an awesome pumpkin pie presence that is especially apparent in the aroma."
