"2014 Bottle from Mike’s Barleywine tasting, thanks for the opportunity! Rich sweet fruit and caramel. Sticky syrupy sweet mouthfeel. Hides the alcohol content extremely well with just a wisp on the nose. A bit too sweet for my taste."
""
""
""

""

"O- Phenomenal barleywine. It's much different than King Henry or The K13 which remain my favourite barleywines, but it's almost as good as these are in its own way. Highly recommend."

"I may have had a bad bottle, but honestly it's so overly sweet it's almost hard to enjoy. I'm quite surprised this had a perfect 100 and is so high in the top 250."
""

"Sweet and delicious. My kind of b-wine! Montrealbcr89, you maniac! Boozecamel too, who hooked me up with a bottle. You handsome fellas are too good to me."

"O: Very fruit forward barleywine, with the cognac treatment only increasing this rather than providing some vanilla/oak, which is notably absent, to cut the fruitiness.  This is decidedly a step down from Sucaba or Bourbon Abominable."
"Deserves its reputation. Best barleywine I've had."
"Overall, hands down one of the best strong beers I've ever had, and also one of the best beers period. 750mL is obviously a sharing size for this, and unfortunately I have no one to share it with tonight. So I hope by opening it before 5 p.m. I've given myself enough time to savor this one throughout the evening. It really is that good."
"Batch 2.  One of best BA BWs I have tasted"

"On the sweeter side of the style, but wonderfully complex."
"If you know what good Barleywine is you will appreciate Deal with the Devil. Get it if you get a chance!"

"At over $30, I had to think twice about picking this up. After tasting, I'll be going back to get a bottle to age. I was worried this one would be too sweet, but the barrels really mellow it out. The cognac addition is wonderful. With the weight, it drinks more like a stout than a barleywine. Overall, an exceptional beer. This is neck and neck with Bourbon county for the best barleywine I've ever had."
""
""
"Cognac barrel really comes through. Maple syrup, apple, pear, caramel. Velvety smooth with no alcohol burn."
"really overrated.  Only plus is hidden alcohol."

"How is this 17%??? This is the best Barleywine I've ever had!"
""
""
"This drinks so easy and is incredibly smooth. Such a complex beer. I wish I had lots of bottles of this one."

"Good but Leon has ruined all other barleywines for me. That was just a lot better."

"simply an amazing beer outstanding"
"The nose on this is ridiculous! There is so much going on. I was a little drunk to take notes but this has to be one of the best smelling barleywines I've had. The taste put it over the top. Fantastic! I'm bummed out that I didn't pick up a bottle when it hit the shelves."

"Simply not the beer I was expecting. Thin, looks like what'll come out of my ass tomorrow and smells like malted white chocolate milk balls. Only way I'd have this again, if I was looking to tie one on."
""
""
""
"Had batch 1 and batch 2 side by side. B1=5 B2=4.4"
""
""
""
""
"Kinda still in the glass, huge toffee and booze aroma, tasted like a toasted marshmellow in a toffee cognac, syrupy, beautifully integrated and well hidden booze.  Best BW I've had.  b1 shared three ways."
""
""
""
""
"O- really good BW. One of the better ones I've tasted. The barrel-aging was done right on this one."
""
""
"O:  Possibly the best Barleywine I've ever had.  Hits on all cylinders.  Sweet without being cloying and ridiculously drinkable for such a high abv.  I'm already seeking this out again and crossing my fingers that batch 2 turned out just as well."
""
"The beer pours a dark brown/black and looks totally viscous and flat until a few seconds after pouring when a fleet of tiny bubbles escape towards the beer's surface and briefly hold a centimeter of tan head. I've never seen this phenomenon with a beer before. The nose is super sweet and fruity (mainly grape notes), with toffee, a hint of tobacco, and almost no alcohol. The taste is incredibly decadent with its rich malt backbone, followed by some oak and a slight bitterness in the finish. This may be the most viscous beer I've had to date, it sits like a cement truck of barrel and malt on the palate, and has minimal carbonation, bitterness, or alcohol. I'm very impressed by this beer - it very well may be my favorite BA barleywine - and is totally worth the money."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good strong and powerful beer but does nothing to keep its booziness down flavors are good but just short of cloying. maybe this one need some time to mellow but as of now, I would give it a pass at this age."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is very hard to put into words.  A pretty impressive creation.  If the sweetness was just toned down this thing would just be out of this world."
""
""
"Overall: quite possibly the most expensive, over rated barley wine in recent history.   Sorry Gabe and Jerimiah, this one should have not left the brewery."
"Incredibly sweet tasting. No alcohol heat whatsover. Top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"Incredible beer!"
""
""
"It's name and wild recipe make it sound like an overly aggressive beer that would punch you in the gut,  but it is quite the opposite.  Very well crafted and full of interesting and delicious flavor nuances."
""
""
""
"O: Wow. This is a beast of a beer, and one that delivers in every category. The barrel really adds some nice nuances, but surprisingly isn't the star of the show. That honor goes to the maltiness and flat out high gravity/plato of the brew. Very much worth the $30+ that was begrudgingly (at the time, not so much now) spent. If you get the chance to try this beer, DO IT"
"Absolutely remarkable red and brown fruit complexity with a luxurious cognac overlay that meshes perfectly. A sophisticated and delightfully mouth coating marvel that is unbelievably smooth and mellow for its 17.3% abv. Beautifully balanced from start to finish. Trade heavily for this one, or don't even flinch at the $30+ price tag, it's well worth it."
""
""
""
"A Deal With The Devil is a truly special brew. Of the myriad barrel aged English barleywines I've tried this is certainly one of the top two or three. It's worth the money, more than worth any hype and a truly hunt-worthy brew. I really hope that I can score some more at some point but a heartfelt thanks to @itracy63 for the surprise mail bomb from Alaska to Georgia!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely a sipper. Quite the extreme beer experience and truly worth the high price tag. Easily busts into the upper echelon of BA Barleywines."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really awesome achievement in brewing. If the sweetness was toned down a bit, and some of the residual sugars fermented out, this would be basically perfect. As it is, it's near perfect, though."
""
"Drink- This was a good beer. Bordered on great with time I think. Its a bit thick and chewy with a bunch going on. I saw signs of greatness in it. I will admit. This kicked my ass. I can drink some big beers but I needed a nap. Well done Gabe."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet, fruity with a subtle hint of the strength of the abv. Taste becomes more complex as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Price point seemed a bit expensive, but I grabbed it anyway. I'm glad I did. If not the best barley wine I've ever tried, it is certainly the best I've have recently. Cognac aging lends layers other barrels just don't, totally right for this brew."

"This is the Best beer of 2014"

"This here is a special little barleywine. It's got insane intensity of flavors, and incredibly, all the complexity and balance necessary to harness that intensity. Not only sweet, but kinda tangy, and with that leathery, slightly bitter swagger that always makes an ale like this interesting. It's got character to spare."

"dark reddish brown. caramel, dark fruit nose. taste reminiscent of aged utopias. raisin, caramel, cognac. ABV extremely well hidden. a top 2 barleywine for me. thick, smooth, creamy, awesome!"

"Nice complexity.  A bit boozy in the finish."

"O. This is an excellent treat. Very big beer. Bold flavors makes this one worth the acclaim. I'm happy I was able to try this so I do not need to search it out. Anchorage brought their A game."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And as the most subtle of sips latch onto the taste buds, its finish is long-lasting, deeply saturating and luxurious on the palate as each decadent sip reaches deeper and deeper into the taste buds for a lasting dessert-like slumber."

"Batch 2 bottle not quite as rich and viscous but still darn good. This years seemed a bit more one note than before, with less coconut and brown sugar, and more molasses."
""
"OVERALL: This was really, really good. It's definitely a sweet beer, but it's big, full bodied, thick, flavorful, and very complex in the flavor profile. A touch more bitterness might help push this into the next stratosphere, but as it is, it's a beauty of a beer and well worth checking out if you can. Would love to see a bottle of this with 5 years on it, and am very much looking forward to the next batch. Awesome beer night Dooper. Cheers!"
""
"O: Take any other 17% beer fresh and it's hot, but this tastes like its been cellared five years in the bottle. One of the better barleywines I've ever had, and definitely the best one I've had fresh. Really delicious and amazing mouthfeel, and really impressive all-around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of the finest barleywines I have ever had the pleasure to drink. I couldn't quite pull out any traces of the cognac barrels but I am sure it is probably hiding in there somewhere waiting for a more experienced palate. Be careful with this one, it will sneak up on you given how smooth it is!"
"O - This is the best barley wine that I have had so far. Some people may not agree, but I love the sweetness to this beer and I think it is perfect for masking the 17% beast. I may have to seek this one out."
""
""
""
""

"Overall, just an otherworldly beer. Even though this beer is listed as an American Barleywine, the barrel-aging has definitely taken over in the primary characteristics and gives it a very English feel with big sweetness and lots of grain. I wish I had a full bottle of my own, because I would love to pour this into a brandy snifter and sip on it over the course of an hour or two. And with the low carbonation, I can imagine it would hold up pretty well over a couple days--you could possibly even decant it without severely impacting the overall profile of the beer. I hope against hope that Anchorage produces this beer again and that I can actually procure some for myself."
"Overall - This is serious. Good, but really sweet."
""
"O - an outstanding beer, probably the only batch 1 I'll have, felt quite lucky to enjoy at ChurchKey"

"This is a sipper and a sharer, but this beer is very nice. Highly recommended. Would love to encounter again."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't quite Perfect Storm or even King Henry but it certainly belongs in the conversation of top barleywines. Great complexity with an excellent feel to tie things together."
""
"The aroma brings the cognac front and center. Additional notes of toffee, oak, booze, leather, brown sugar. Fabulous flavor, carrying every delectable whiff of the aroma into the taste. Rich and smooth. Delicate on the palate with a gentle, silky finish. 17.3% abv?!? Dangerously drinkable. Teeming with flavor, this is a beer to sip and savor. A top notch example of the style. I'd love to have this again sometime."
"Overall, yes it's great. It's fantastic, but the best of the best? Probably not. Would love to have some to age. Would pull out port qualities that would make it even more interesting. Boozy for sure, but I find it hides it better than most Bruery booze bombs."

"an enormous barleywine type here, aged in cognac. an i thought between the staves was cognac heavy! ha! this is next level, ultra rich and decadent and intense. indian brown in color with about as much viscosity as ive seen in a beer. not much head, but a small ring of tan lace along the edge of my glass. it smells like cognac, with that sweet wine property, tons of oak, and an enormous grain bill that must assuredly add some leftover sugar to this. i feel the beer before i taste it, what an incredible texture to this, velvety smooth, slippery, but with a gigantic body, hard to even swallow this in big sips its so heavy, up there with the heaviest beers ive had really, as far as body is concerned, its almost not fully liquid, like maple syrup or something. burnt sugar and vanilla and cognac are the dominant flavors, and although it is quite sweet, i dont find it nasty and cloying and over the top. the wood mellows it all out. i am amazed at just how smooth this beer is, i mean, for 17% abv and change, its hardly hot in the slightest, and certainly doesnt reek of big booze and feel like a fusel bomb. certainly a bomber of this would light up even the most seasoned of drinkers, but is a beer to be shared anyhow. extremely impressed with such a big barleywine, and would take this over the likes of bourbon county and others, the texture is special."

"One of the more amusing comments I heard from the manager at Bier Stein (Dave) pertained to the beer's drinkability. He noted that you really couldn't tell this was a 17% abv. beer, that it really drank like a beer with only 12% abv. I suppose that's true, but 12% or 17%, this is a sizeable BW with some serious alcohol to it."
"Overall- Definitely a great beer but I don't think I can rank it as high as most have. This is partially a result of style but I do truly think that it isn't as good as Abacus. A must try, especially if you can get a small pour."
"O: When I walked out the door to go to the bar and try this beer, I had a feeling that this might unseat my previously favorite beer or at least match it. Most of the time, those types of feelings are inaccurate, but in this case it was dead on. This beer meets the hype. Holy shit. Its amazing!"

"So I’m on my way home to Alaska. My buddy in Iowa has some of this beer he made over a year ago that is pretty flipping good. Though he has never had M, he modeled it after M based on things he had read. It kinda reminds me of Hebrew Jubilation 16. It weighed in at around 14.5%. So he put some in a bottle for me, with the plan that I would go see Gabe at Anchorage Brewing, share the homebrew with him, and maybe get some feedback and tips on the brew. That all came to pass. Gabe liked it, said “I dig it.” Then came the feedback. The oak and bourbon were a little overdone. Then the advice. Next time oak/bourbon part of the batch and not the other part. Then blend it together. Even play with different proportions in a glass before blending the whole batch, and use that experience to guide future decisions. It’s pretty cool that Gabe took the time to do this, and show me around. Again. He’d gotten a whole bunch more huge oak fermenters since the last time I was in there. He showed me the last pallet of DWTD that was about to be shipped to the states. I mentioned that I missed the release and had a nice vertical of Bourbon County with me (08, 09, 10, 12) that I’d be willing to trade if he knew anyone that had any. He found me a bottle and we commenced the deal. Then he told me that last years was on tap at Humpy’s and he’d had a glass with his lunch. I made a bee line over there to try it. The bottle I traded for will go back to Iowa and be shared with my friend who sent the homebrew attempt at M. Good story? … And the good news is that he is making exponentially more DWTD next year. I forget how much, but orders of magnitude more. He had to rent another building to hold all the barrels."

"As a side note: the only bummer was the extreme price gauging done by Belmont Station with this tasting. I know this beer is expensive, but $10 for a 4-5oz pour??? that sucked, but oh well."

"Admitted this was the last beer of the show, but it should have been the first! This hands down is the best barely wine I have ever had. Beautiful dark plum flavor balanced by richness of the alcohol makes an amazing pairing. It's like being a kid again and looking up at the starry sky on an ink black night and relaizing how incredibly complex the universe is. You don't drink this beer, you embrace it in the deepest hug you can and hold on for the ride."

"Had on tap at Amsterdam Cafe in Anchorage. Just heard that the real name for this beer is "" A Deal with the Devil"". The name is fitting. I have no reservations saying that this is the best barley wine I have ever had, hands down, bar none, not even close. This beer needs to be bottled! I can't even explain in words how indulgent this beer is. Mouthfeel is smooth as butter. As smooth as any oatmeal stout but thicker and a little chewy. It's got that dark ripe ripe fruit and malty taste of a barely wine but just more dank. The flavors are so balanced it is ridiculous. It also tastes of rich toffee, caramel, malt, and wood. A little more boozy as it warms but barely. My mouth and lips are numb from all the alcohol. A real treat."
"I didn't get to try this at the Alaska beer and Barleywine fest but I was very excited when I saw it at my local beer warehouse. I will definitely be first in line for this next year at the GABBF. Thanks for making this amazing beer Gabe, please put this in bottles"
"In a word: Amazing! No, make that two words: Freakin' Amazing! First off, tasting it, you would never believe that it is north of 17% alcohol. It is so smooth and deep that I would have guess more like 12% tops. It is incredibly complex, with a balance and depth of flavor profile that has to be experienced to be believed. I first tasted it the day before the Great Alaska Beer & Barley Wine Festival and I immediately knew it would win first place; it was just that good. Once again Gabe Fletcher has pulled off a brewing masterpiece. A Deal with the Devil indeed. I'm starting to wonder if he didn't meet a certain gentleman at the crossroads late one night and make a deal for the power to brew these sort of beers. After all, if Robert Johnson could do it to learn how to play the guitar, why not a brewer?"
""
"O - I first heard about this beer from Gabe last summer. It was brewed for the AK Barleywine fest, which I missed. I was very happy to hear that this was still on. Very good and I am thankful that I got a shot to try this."
