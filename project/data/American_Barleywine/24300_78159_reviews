"Evil Twin Freudian Slip -----3.5/5"
""
""
"Neither hoppy nor sweet. Not enough going on here."
"My first barley wine. Not bad but not sure this is my style"
""
""
""
"Overall impression:  A big and boozy American Barleywine.  I could have used some filtering or lagering to get rid of the floaties.  Also, some age could have relieved some of the ETOH ""hotness"".  I decent shot but for the price, I'll stick to the American standards (i.e. Bigfoot)."
"Overall- Even with a year age the hops are still very noticeable. Tale of two beers, up front there is a huge sweetness, fruitiness, but midway through the beer transitions into a hop bitterness and dry, oaky, port like finish. Rather enjoyable to see the beer transform like that with every sip, a unique type of balance in that there are two extemes going on. Enjoyable sipper."

"12oz bottle dated 03/12/14. Pours a murky medium brown with virtually no head. Almost no lacing. The aroma is boozey with some caramel, dark fruits, bread and a hint of citrus. The taste is caramel and wheat bread with some raisins, plums, and orange peel. Boozey with a noticeable alcohol presence, of course. Still I'm surprised the ABV isn't higher. Woody and boozey finish. Heavy mouthfeel. Overall, solid choice I'd grab again."
"Pours nice rich Amber with a light head. Very good barely wine. Not overpowering. Not as complex as would've like from evil twin. Which is one of my favorite Brewers."

"Aroma has firm woody and spicy tones with an undercurrent of caramel. Pours a clear dark chocolaty brown with a fairly thick tan head. Flavor is - whoa, the alcohol bite means it is not for the faint of heart! Aside from that is has rather subdued notes of caramel, cloves and woody hops plus a hint of honey. Syrupy texture is smooth and does not seem to have a lot of fizz. If you like barleywines, this may be up your alley."
"A bit more alcoholic tasting than I would have preferred. Bought as a sgl bottle at a price I do not recall although I believe it was more than I would normally pay. There are better examples of the style out there."
""

""
""
"Overall:  excellent. What a barley wine should be."
"(Note to self:  wife loves this.)"
""
"It's continually crisp and gets smoother as it goes even with the alcoholic sting.  There's quite a bit of dryness that shows.  The body leans toward full without ever quite leaving medium range, and it keeps a certain depth all the way through."
""
"Overall: Good brew worth grabbing a bottle but there's definitely much better options out there. Salud!"

"Overall:  Reasonably good, but both the malt and hop bills lack the complexity to make this a top representative of the American barleywine style"

"Pours a dark amber color with below average clarity.  Light off white head forms and laces.  The aroma has toasted malts, caramelized grain, and faint hops.  Caramel, toast, butterscotch, mild bitterness.  Slight citrus, well balanced, Grade A beer."
""
""
""
""
"Not a lot of typical barleywine characteristics floating around this one, even for the American style, as this is all about the bitter and acrid - the musty and malty, very much less so.  Interesting to try, and ultimately not that difficult to drink for the hop-inclined, after a short acclimatization period, that is.  This wants recognition - I just don't know how or what to recognize it as."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 3/12/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange peel, caramel, toast, brown sugar, toffee, raisin, plum, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish. Very nice complexity and balance of big citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice American barleywine style. All around good complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Went to my fridge wanting something big and boozy and this ticks the boxes so it pours a full dark copper red hue with a one finger head and a rim of lacing, the smell is definately a hoppy barleywine with aromas of piney resinous hops, sweet barley and booze, the mouthfeel is thick and full bodied with moderate carbonation and the tastes are piney hops mixed with sweet toffee, caramelized pears and finished with a fruity boozy bitterness and overall a nice hoppy barleywine thats worth a shot cheers."
"I'll admit, it becomes more enjoyable the more you drink it, but the heat really diminishes the flavors and just dominates. The alcohol isn't hidden at all, but maybe that was their intention. This drinks like it's much bigger than 10.3%.  Definite sipper."

"This was a beer that each time I took another sip, I dropped by score.  Can see no reason to visit this again any time soon, especially given the price.  The beer isn't awful, but I'll be damned if I can ever imagine getting this over a glass of SN Bigfoot, which is twice the beer this is, at half the price."

""

"I’m sure I’ve never had anything like this: big, brutal, hoppy, & integrated as well as a St. Louis suburb. A very good beer that’s close to excellent."

"Comes to the table a slightly hazy deep amber/brown color with a decent sized head. Sweet caramel and brown sugar maltiness obliterated by a solid shot of earthy pine and resin. The flavor is sweet and a bit gritty with a solid earthy pine offset with lots of sweet caramel fruit and brown sugar with just touches of chocolate. Medium to thick body with alight to moderate level of carbonation. Nice barleywine, but seems like it needs a bit of time for the flavors to meld a little better."

"My initial impression is of a Porter with a shot of cognac added. Plenty of darker, deeply roasted malts followed by a solid dollop of hop bitterness. The swallow brings out a strong alcohol warming feel. The aftertaste is like a bitter alcoholic cocktail. Average body with an elevated level of carbonation."

"It's a sipper. Honestly, even though I don't taste or so much feel the alcohol in this beer, it drinks like it's 15% just because of how it tastes and feels. Freudian Slip is a very good beer and quite good for the style, but it's a let down just because I expect everything I have from Evil Twin now to be World Class... maybe that's my fault, but the price is a bit high. I'd recommend it if you like super bold beers and/or American Barleywines."
""
""
"Overall, this barleywine is a bit one-dimensional but it's drinkable and relatively tasty."
""
""

"Pours a two-finger, khaki head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is malty fruit, flavor is blend of roasted malt, brown sugar and hops. Lingering hoppy aftertaste. Higher ABV is hidden. $4.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA. Bottled Mar 12, 2014."

""

"edit: Just noticed this used to be 12% before it was placed in 12oz bottles. Love the smaller format guys but lets keep the original recipe OK?"

"Those vibrant fruit notes are also in the taste but the malts carry themselves forward as well. Still no boozy taste but the hop bitterness at the end is pungent and lingering. Not something I got on the nose but a satisfying conclusion."
"Not bad, but I prefer a hoppier barley wine."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark reddish-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, citrus zest, alcohol, and slight vegetal onion and garlic hop aromas . Taste is much the same with toasted malt, brown sugar, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a mild vegetal hop quality in the aroma that disappears as the beer warms up."

"O: Pretty nice drinking beer, hoppy, sweet, full bodied. I’m a novice barleywine drinker, but this is pleasing. I might like to see a little more balance, but overall this is solid."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer. I love how hoppy this beer is. I'd definitely drink this one fresh."
""
""
""
"On the sweet side. Fairly hot, as well."
"A decent barley wine, seems as much an English Barley Wine as an American... Good, but too expensive to buy again..."
""
""
"I don't generally like barleywines but this one is worth getting- well balanced malt sweetness with a little dryness from the hops. Surprisingly not cloying as most barleywines are. There's some dark fruit in there but nothing overwhelming. Just a nice warming beer."

"i found this to be a very interesting take on a barleywine, more of an american strong dark ale, insofar as the two are distinct from one another, but nevertheless, i liked this better than the gentleman i shared it with. a curious nose, hoppy and spicy, like a winter warmer or holiday beer, with some clove and molasses, but i think most or all of that is a product of a very large and diverse grain bill. the flavor comes on in waves. sweet and grainy first, the only part of this that resembles classic barleywine, but it is short loved, moving into a spice palate that includes cloves, allspice, and even something a little more funky, cardamom or cinnamon maybe, tough to tell because the hops start in before the spice fully evolves. bitter as anything on the finish, which is one sense is nice because it cuts the grain sweetness, but on the other had is frustrating because it exacerbates and exposes the prominent alcohol strength of this ale. fizzy carbonation makes it feel light on the palate, especially for the style and for this examples particular strength. i like its tricking drinkability, and would recommend this ale for the lover of the unconventional. nothing like the barleywine we expected, but an enjoyable beverage nevertheless."

"Overall- Above average to solid, good beer (closer to good) that doesn't stray too far from the typical flavor profile for an American Barleywine. Effective but certainly not innovative. Worth a try and it may become a bargain standard for you if you like straightforward American Barleywines."

"Freudian Slip is a beast of a beer that in no way recedes in aggression. Instead it heralds utmost quality and power with unabashed apologies. And I could't be happier for it!"

"22 ounce bottle, label says best before 2015. I've had this bottle a while so I know it's not exactly fresh. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a murky garnet/brown color with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. The brew smells like toffee, brown sugar, molasses, and dark fruit. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some caramel, earthiness, pine and dark bread. Nice mix of sweet and bitter flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit syrupy and sticky with moderate carbonation. I thought this brew was good, it's worth a try. $11.99 a bottle."

"O - Not a mind-blowing beer. Somewhat mid-grade. It's nice, but not over the top good."

"Overall I thought this wasn't really a noteworthy beer and I thought it was a very average Barleywine, there were some aspects I enjoyed but I thought the sweetness was out of hand and that really showed up in the aroma, taste and even the mouthfeel and the warmer it got the more boozy it got. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't that smooth, it was cloying, the alcohol could have been hidden better and the taste didn't do a good job at holding my attention, splitting this bottle with someone is enough for me, I wouldn't want to drink a whole bottle, it's way too sweet and cloying for me to have more than half a bottle. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma they were both nice with the head and lacing looking pretty good for a 10% Barleywine. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and mouthfeel, they weren't that good and they were the downfall of this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I wasn't that into it and it was way overpriced, I bought two of these so the other one is going to set in the cellar for a while and hopefully it improves a little, I wouldn't recommend it, it's not a great example of a Barleywine. All in all I wasn't a fan of this beer, it doesn't have all the quality's that I look for in the style and the sweetness was just too out of hand and combined with the other flaws it made this beer pretty rough around the edges. This wasn't a good first impression for Evil Twin, I still have interest in them, but I'll for sure think twice before a I drop over $10 on a bottle, better luck next time, this one just wasn't for me.  2014 Edit So I aged a bottle from this same batch and it aged very nicely, the hops died down and it let more of those great malt flavors come through.  I liked this one more aged and I'm going to bump up the score from my original 3.11"

"This one is a pass for me, glad I got to try it without buying. Would not recommend."

" caramel malt, and a hint of dark citrus. Fits the style of an American Barleywine. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, roasted malt, slight dark citrus, yeast, hint of biscuit, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, complexity, and good body."
""
"Poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours dark toffee brown with a thick, light brown head that retreats slowly. I can see some bubbles rising along the side of the glass. Plenty of lacing is left along the side of the glass. The aroma of the beer is sweet and bready with a touch of woodiness, dark fruits, and some booze. The taste follows the nose. It's mildly sweet with a nice bready malt backbone. I get the dark fruit flavors and some of the alcohol in the flavor. I also get some of those woody notes with some back end bitterness to provide some balance. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and the alcohol warms in the back of the throat. This is an excellent beer, but just so."
"Can someone help me finish this bottle actually?"
""
"O- Decent, but not really worth a second go. Way too hot and two-dimensional."
""
"O: Big and bold hops and malts, just like a barleywine should be. Pretty strong in the alcohol heat though. Recommended you try this if you're a fan of the style."
""
""
""
"D - Nice hoppy American Barleywine. Great hop profile and bitterness and good overall bitterness."
""
"O- Overall this is an incredible double ipa. I expect a bit more heat from alcohol in a barley wine. That said it is simply fantastic. Hop heads delight!"
""
"Appearance is tawny with minimal clarity and almost no head. Some lacing exists. Smells is straight up grain with a heavy leaning towards the sweet side of things. Molasses, grapes, and grain. Taste is more of the sweet malts with some hops to balance things out. Finish is not super sweet, definite notes of maple and grapes. Mouthfeel is moderate with mild carbonation. Overall, this is a sweet barleywine that could use some more hops."
"[O] I'm surprised to see that this beer is a collaboration with Westbrook. But stoked! Not being the biggest Evil Twin fan, I ordered this on the strength of Westbrook's name alone. Overall, I was impressed but not blown away."

"It is a medium bodied brew for the style on the edge of light with a bit watery feel exaggerated by the light carbonation. It is enjoyable in limited amounts. The nose is the standout feature of this brew. I am usually a big fan of cask beer but I think this experience was possibly degraded a bit by it."
"This poured out as a reddish brown color. There wasn't much of a head on top, just some scattered bubbles on top. The smell of the beer has some sweet malts on the nose as well as some hops. The aromas of caramel and dark fruits are in there too. The taste of the beer has a light amount of raisin flavor with a hoppy bitter finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is watery, it's drinkable but not overly complex. Overall this beer wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be. There are better Barley Wines out there."
"Pours a murky amber color with a small white head. Nose is lightly fruity, but quite heavy on the toffee and toasted malt. A bit of caramel and brown sugar along with some pine hop notes and a bit of perfume. The flavor has an almost woody note to it. Heavy on the pine hops with a moderate bitterness. Lots of toffee, a bit of toast, and some brown sugar. A bit of booze and perfume, too."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark reddish brown amber with a nice one finger tan head that had good retention and tons of lacing. Looks good. Aroma of caramel malt and light citrus and pine hops. Flavor has sweet malt and dark fruit to start, slowly changing to a malty, nicely hopped finish and a lingering, slightly boozy pine and citrus hop aftertaste. Moderately complex and a very nice flavor progression. Medium to heavy bodied with moderate creaminess. The high ABV and hops make a bit of an astringent finish, but overall I enjoyed this well made American style barleywine. If I can find a reasonably priced second bottle, I would age one for a few years to calm the booziness."

"Great for sipping on a cold evening. I had to end my tastings for the day here but, sometimes that's a good thing. Will definitely seek out again."
""
"It's definitely a hot barleywine with a healthy dose of hops but it comes together really well. Another winner from Evil Twin, which has been impressing more than Mikkeller lately."
"O: This is a good sipping beer for a cold winter night."
""
"O: overall good not great, pretty one dimensional with the big nutty character. For the price, I probably wouldn't buy again,"
""
"Poured a reddish borwn with decent head on top of a slightly boozy, sweet and sugary malt (along wiith touch of figs) and some breadiness; hopping minimal. This is a hearty, filling beer with some slight stickiness. Malt heavy, there is some caramel and sugary sweetness, tad syrupy, and (almost) evenly balanced with a touch of citrusy hops and alcohol. Unfortunately, the alcohol bleeds through, not only for a slightly too strong backbite but overall just kind of muddles the beer. Enjoyable sipper but not a great beer."
"Overall this is a unique barleywine. Fan of the fact that the residual sweetness does not play the main part in this beer. Big big beer, slight astringency prevents it from being amazing."
"Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a murky yellowish brown with a two finger khaki colored head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, caramel, caramel hop, wood, and subtle vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, wood, alcohol, dark chocolate, and caramel hop. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this a fairly good brew. I really hate to say it, but this one was a little too boozy on the flavor for my liking. There were lots of things going in this one, but the booze just stole the show. Really unfortunate that was the case. Still not bad, but I doubt I could drink a full 750 mL bottle myself."
"O: The hop bitterness seems to out pace the alcohol"
""
""
"High C+"

"O: Good, easy to drink and tasty"

"Overall: This wasn't a very good barleywine at all. I wouldn't want to have another."
"Very nice, drinkable, and full of sweet flavor. Nice brew to call it a night."
""
"O: very good, a bit sweet but well balanced, a good barleywine... Would recommend."
