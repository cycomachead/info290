Although it doesn't get in the way per se, it's still quite hot at the moment, so giving it some time might be a good idea. I'd like to get another bottle to sit on for a couple years, or even just get an older bottle of this to try out. Probably 3-4 years would be the sweet spot. Cheers again cparles. This was great.","Jeffo","Jan 25, 2014"

Very nicely balanced aromas of caramel creme and grapefruit zest... reminds me almost of a creamsicle very briefly, but then turns into english toffee, butterscotch, and a touch of vanilla. The forefront is sweet and fruity, leading to a mid palate burst of molasses, toffee, raisins, and finishing with rum and citrusy hops. Perfect carbonation for this style and flavor profile.

Smell is of malt, brown sugar, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with a citrus zest flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some nice barleywine aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 21, 2013"

Flavors of caramel and brown sugar with a hint of chocolate mixed with cherries, and plums go down quite smooth.

Served from bottle into a Crooked Stave ‘Crooked Line’ tulip. Poured a hazy red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, earth, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Nothing with the exception of the aroma really stood out to me on this one. While the aroma wasn’t really complex at all it was still fairly well balanced and inviting. I just wish the flavor would have followed suit much closer. The flavor wasn’t bad by any means, but it definitely wasn’t one of the best from the style that I’ve had.

Once I got it open it poured a dark, cloudy dark copper color. There was a large tan head on it that didn’t linger too long. No lacing. Somewhat sweet nose. Caramel, honey, some spices and dark fruits. The taste is sublime. A slight slickness on the tongue. Very smooth taste. This has aged quite well. Caramel, spice, fruits, slightly sweet, yet a subtle bit of bitterness back there.

3.88,-9.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"East End Gratitude pours an opaque mahogany. Four fingers or so of light tan foam rise up to crown the beer, displaying good head retention. Lacing forms nearly a solid ring at the apex, but is extremely spotty below. The nose has lots of brown sugar and caramel, with a noticeable nuttiness to it as well. It's just a touch dweak in intensity though. The flavor is much more robust, with notes of fruity cherries and some sherry from the oxidation jumping out. The malty base of the beer accounts itself with more brown sugar and caramel. If anything I'd say that the malty base is a touch too much in the background as far as balance in the flavor profile goes. The cherry is a little bit unexpected (maybe particularly ester-y fermentation), but works out nicely with everything else.The body isn't is rich and full as I might have anticipated, which does work well in making this beer drink easier, but I like the mouthfeel for a barleywine to have a certain luxuriant quality. The carbonation is very nice and muted, just barely enough to carbonate the beer. Gratitude is a very nice offering for one of my favorite styles.","axeman9182","Apr 10, 2012"

How did I not know about this brewery and make here get me bottles; poor job by me... Anyway this is a very good beer but when compared to the greats of the stle, it falls a bit short for me. I would much rather have and Alaskan Barley Wine, which I believe is the ""Gold Standard"" for the style. It is much more readily available or accessable via trade or online order from various shops. This is a viscous and heavy in flavor, which is good and bad; would like a tad more carbonation to balance the heft. The alcohol becomes a bit overbearing towards the bottom of the bottle, so overall, while this was very good, I have to say this is not worth trading a great deal for given the rarity and the price of vintage editions.","claspada","Jan 16, 2012"

There are some earthy hops balancing thing out especially in the finish whichns long, dry and slightly bitter. Very well balanced and extremely quaffable with faint hints of dark fruit, especially plum and raisin.

After reading other reviews of various vintages, it seems that this is the most aggressively hopped version, so I'm hoping some time in the cellar will tame the hops and smooth out the alcohol on this. It's still fairly young for a barleywine of this magnitude, so I will be holding onto a few bottles of this to crack later.

Full and fruity with a dominant raisin profile and a twinge of caramel sweetness to round it all out. The mouthfeel is great too! Silky on the tongue with just a bit of sharp carbonation to it.

There is a swirl of foam here and there but nothing that I can call a cap, or even a sparse cap, no lacing obviously. Smell is a bunch of fruit dipped in caramel. Apricots are up front with some plum, fig, and yes some alcohol. This is the 09' vintage by the way. Taste is superb but this loses something off the tap. A big malting causes for a big display of caramel. I did not pick up the werthers quality that I found in the bottle. Sweet caramel sided with apricot, plum, slight apple and cherry, figs, fruits, you know what it is. Yes, the alcohol pokes it's ugly head out but it does not distract from the beer, I think it boosts it's flavor profile some. The feel seems a bit thinner than out of the bottle, it's a big medium feel that is slick and leaves some fruit and alc. on the tounge afterwards. Carb is there but seems tame.

Tastes of rich malts, toffee, berry, burnt caramel, and a big cookie finish. Feels full with a nice creamy restrained carbonation.

It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had an amazing scent and taste, with tons of fruity sweetness. It had great body too, and hid the alcohol decently. So it was pretty easy to drink, but much better to sip and savor.

4.28,-0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This bottle of East End Gratitude came courtesy of justn; thanks for the opportunity. I believe this is an 07 bottle (yellow wax) and it is number 914 out of 1500. It took me ten minutes to pry off the wax, but the reward was great. This is a staggeringly good looking Barleywine; deep cloudy burgundy color, with a creamy tan heading. Smell is not quite as impressive, but still notable; I get some dark fruit, brown sugar, alcohol and maybe some chocolate. Rum soaked raisins come to mind first in the flavor, with some brown bread and slight alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is slick on the palate, but not as chewy as one might expect. The ABV can be tasted and felt, but I think it adds a nice element to the whole package. As for drinkability, this bottle is draining pretty quickly, so I would say drinkability is top notch for a beer with this ABV. This was a very pleasurable drinking experience from East End.

The '07 was still good...and the '08 has a long way to go. Like I mentioned before...not sure about the recipe changes...but this is one you should definitely let age for at least 1 year+ before cracking open.

The aroma is bold and inviting with solid dark fruity esters of prunes, figs, dates and a layer of yum followed by near grainy malty sweetness. A big draw brings the expected bit of hotness to the nose. The taste starts sweet and malty with a mild pulse of pine hops. Way more malty sweet than bittering hops. The fruity esters soon surface and grow to midway and carry into the finish with notes of prunes, muted yet ripe cherries, sugar stewed raisins, figs and plums. Wow, very enjoyable.

Not as hoppy as one would expect for an american style barleywine, but still has a very noticeable hop presence. Malts are very active here, and there is a unique barrage of different malt flavors. quite sugary, but not too cloying. mouthfeel is on the thin side, but not too thin to be out of the barleywine realm, just on the thinner side of the fence. Drinkability is quite scary for something weighing in at a hefty 11.4%. Overall a very enjoyable american style barleywine. Cant wait to see how the bottles in the cellar are in a year or two.

There is a great complexity with this barleywine. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied but is pretty much what I look for. It was silky and a little creamy.

Alcohol and bitterness are balanced and mellow but slightly evident in the finish. Just a hint of fresh green hoppiness as well, a little like chewing on a cone. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, creamy soft carbonation blends well with the slightly sugary body, both of which are balanced by a little hoppy dryness and an alcohol warmth in the finish. A very nice barleywine that got better and better as it warmed. Glad i have another to age a little, loof forward to more from this brewery. Thanks to Richard and Steve for the opportunity.","hoppymeal","Jan 03, 2008"
4.37,1.9,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Picked up one of the last few bottles left a few weeks ago and opened it today. It has a great thick, cloudy dark amber color with great head and nice lacing. It has a wonderful malty scent, like a scotch ale plus. It has a great full, smoky, malty flavor, with great barley flavors and a full-bodied taste. It goes down great, this is a wonderful barley wine. I can't wait to see how Scott does with the 2007 batch.","JamesS","Aug 09, 2007"

3.73,-13.1,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"It poured up a nice medium copper with really creamy tan colored head that provided a lot of stickage. Aromas included a hefty dosage of Maris Otter or some 2-row, plum skins, faint mineral notes and tropical fruits like kiwi and papaya, and a decent hopping level. Tasting revealed a pleasant scorched malt taste with a light smoky feel to it. Some esters of peach and bubblegum mixed ito the malt sweetness. Some significant fusel acohols going on, Finish is lightly bitter and astringent. The only drawback is the off-presence of a slight medicinal, burnt rubber sort of taste, kind of plastic-like. Mouthfeel was really good, thick without being syrupy, and the carbonation was spot-on with a subtle presence. Overall, a pretty nice barleywine that I wish I could have sat on for a while longer.","crookedhalo","Jun 12, 2007"
4.78,11.4,5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Thick with some cloying,yet still has a somewhat light feel. Goes down nice,but a definate sipper. Amazing beer wish I had more of this beer stashed away.","jcdiflorio","May 29, 2007"
5,16.6,5,5,5,5,5,"	Drinkability easy to hoard and drink in a dark room by yourself or share with family and friends at a party. Even if the crowd may not understand Barleywines like most of us on this site, I guarantee if you offer a few samples of this brew around the room that you will open some palates up to new experiences possibly peak enough interest to pass on the craft beer revolution. Complexity with stunning adhesiveness breeds excellence in this style of beer, so far since 2005 Gratitude East End has nailed just that. Signed by Scott bottle number 1093/1300 here goes a big cheers right back at ya my friend.","WVbeergeek","Jan 05, 2007"

4.25,-0.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The beer is now pouring slighly hazy w/a beautifull copper color. The aroma has opened up from what I remember. A bit more hops. The falvors are still sweet but much more in harmony with the hops. Nice American BW taste, the sweetness that makes it a BW and a nice the hop punch finish.","yinzer","Beers"
