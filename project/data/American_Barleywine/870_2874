Though the hops are a strong player in the flavor, they only modestly dominate in the finish, aside from what a lot of brewers think...that if they make their IBUs over double the OG, they are making a Barley Wine. No, you are making hop extract with malt and alcohol in it. This beer is well crafted and I would put it up on my list of favorite American Barley Wines, no doubt. I would definitely give this beer a try...regardless of what beer you are into...you will probably like this beer.","SkeeterHawk","Apr 12, 2011"

The balance is ok, leaning to the malt, as the aftertaste is a tongue coated malty syrup. The carbonation helps disperse the flavors of this viscous, chewy brew.

There was a fair bit of caramel in there too. Moderate bitterness with a ton of malty caramel kicked things off. There was a bit of juice and spicy alcohol in the middle. Grapefruit rind and citrus oil bitterness really punched through at the end and lingered forever for a really intense finish. Lightly warming with a full body that was creamy and chewy.

The Smell is really good. Sweet creamy caramel malt, a touch of molasses and cinnamon. The nose suggests a rich texture and the mouth doesn't disappoint. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is moderately heavy, a tad lighter than some. Being slightly lighter, there is less of a lingering sense of richness. The flavor is similar to the nose.

All I can reach out of the aroma is a distant waft of an Ecto Cooler juice box, seriously. I would have scored much lower on aroma, if it hadnt been a memory evoker of my Ghostbuster days. Flavor is a week, dusky sweet malt, with caramel and bananas, then a fairly strong rush of hops, but they dont really play the role they should, for me at least. Theyre distant and amalgamated into a consistent one dimensional hop presentation, mostly in a lemongrasseqsue style. Smack of lemon zest. Palate seems heavily watery to me, but I will admit that it seemed to hide the alcohol extremely well, especially for a 10% that doesnt seem to have too much depth.

The nose is a blend of grapefruit and pineapple citrus hop, bread dough, maybe some biscuit malt and a touch of sherry. The flavor has a load of citrus orange hop, with some sweetness from the malt. It almost turns that orange into a nectarine. The biscuit malt is there, along with some toffee (really almost candy sweetness). A little hint of fig. Smooth and slick mouth feel.

Its not as deeply intense as it could be, and the malt sweetness begins to fade after a few slips. Fairly bitter and hoppy finish. The beer could be a little more complex, given the style, but (as said above), its enjoyable and doesnt really have any flaws.

Aroma leans toward the malts rather than much of a hop nose. Notes of raisin, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar and chocolate covered malt balls dominate. Some faint hop aromas make a play in the background revealing some orange and herbal spiciness. Palate is thick, syrupy and silky smooth; very pleasant. Initial taste is a well rounded hit of a malty, dark fruit sweetness, but in no way cloying. Kind of atypical for a west coast BW to have the malt profile dominate the hops, but a nice change. It all finishes with a late moderate hop bitterness bringing in some citrus and pine. The 10% alcohol is incredibly tame under all the malt. Although I prefer the hoppier BWs, this was a nice and well done change of pace","macster","Jan 23, 2006"
3.9,1.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"With all the straight forward malt sweetness found in this beer, I would suggest that a bit more hop flavor and hop bitterness would make this more drinkable as a young Barleywine. As it is though this should age pretty well; the sweetness should mellow considerably over the years and the beer should pick up lots of age malt complexity with time as well. I am enjoying this beer now though, I just need to make sure to lay a couple of these puppies down.","Gueuzedude","Dec 03, 2005"
3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Picked up during at Hi-Time Wine in Costa Mesa during a recent visit to Southern California, the 22 oz. bomber featured a lot of medals that Old Blarney had been awarded. There wasnt any freshness dating, but the bottle looked quite pristine. The beer came out deep clear copper in color with a foamy, clingy head that was one finger thick. The looks were definitely stately, and so was the reserved smell. I was greeted by an aroma that rather malty, instead of the bight west coast hop assault I was anticipating. I could detect some dully earthy and vaguely spicy hoppyness via the nose. The taste was balanced nicely between sweet and dry with a constant back and forth interplay between the flavors. The malts won out in the end though, with their buttery sweet flavor. The hops were citric in their acidity, and moderate in bitterness. There was a brief hint of peat smoke in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was thick, gritty, and teeth coatingly sticky. I found the beer to be somewhere between the English and the American Barleywine styles. While this is a great beer, it didnt quite have the intensity of flavors displayed by the best American examples like Bigfoot, Old Crustacean, and Old Ruffian. It also lacked the smooth mellowness that great English examples like Old Nick, and J. W. Lees exhibit so well. So lets call it an Irish Barleywine, and so the Old Blarney moniker makes sense after all.","rajendra82","Oct 08, 2005"
3.52,-8.3,4,4.5,3,3,3.5,"Old Blarney is warm oaken brown with a glowing fruity aroma hinting at melon.

I notice berries combined with honey and then hops added on to that. Really nice. The beer is thick and syruppy in body. This is definitely a big, strong beer. Alcohol hits my tongue almost instantly and stays with me the whole time all the way down my belly. The malts and hops keep striking me back and forth with neither taking control but both showing their precense. The malts were quite sweet with caramel, apple, and figs at first. The hops came in big waves with a piney flavor but never really bitter. There's a creamy body that goes along with the sweetness and hoppiness that most Moylan's beers seem to have. That berry smell is noticeable in the taste the further I go. The hop strike maintains itself in the aftertaste but there's not much bitterness though, maybe because of the sweetness. The hops aren't really complex but they mix well with the alcohol. The finish lingers but again has a good mixture of malts, hops, and alcohol. This is like a better version of the hog heaven from Avery. A big beer with tons of ingredients and hops. Sounds like a west coast beer to me. But I'm not complaining.","granger10","Jun 15, 2004"

Lushfully solid caramel nose with an alcoholic warmth and tone always sifting underneath. Notes of fresh banana, mango, orange, lingering dark dulled citrusy skins are favorably smokey within. Taste of darkened hard caramel candies, the caramel is very nice here, kinda dark or perhaps even scorched a little, not quite smooth, roughly edgy with some suppressed earthy tones in the hop backing. Nice touches of chocolate and butterscotch candies float around within and a moderate warmth and subdued burn along the way down keep it from being completely smooth and drinkable. Very light notes of fruit and citrus linger here and there. Feel is a bit hindered with a fluffy chalkyness, yet smooth and inviting smoothness continues to keep hold.

4.5,17.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"22oz bomber, unknown vintage. A dark red colour with ruby edges, and a thin off white head of foam. Aromas are extremely hoppy, with booze and sweet caramel malts in the mix as well. The taste is very hoppy up front with a huge malt backbone and tons of sweetness in the middle. The finish is dry and lingering and very reminiscent of Double Bastard. The mouthfeel is thick, but not cloying and the drinkability is excellent!","francisweizen","Feb 01, 2004"
4.38,14.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Dark amber with golden head. There are little sediments present in the beer. The smell is very nice with floral hints and a high fruity hoppiness. The taste is smooth and almost like syrup with flavors of caramel, molasses, citrus fruits and spices. A delicious blend of spices and strong malts and the alcohol pleasantly warms the stomach. Very nice aftertaste of strong/old malts and a hint of pine. A nice barleywine. Delicious.","stewart124","Jan 23, 2004"
3.22,-16.1,3,3.5,3,4,3,"Clear amber in color with very little carbonation and a very meager head. The aroma is surprisingly citric with a noticeable, fairly medicinal alcohol scent. The flavor starts off with a brown-sugar maltiness, quite hoppy in the finish, with an aftertaste that as at once bitter and sugary sweet. Alcohol has a bit too much bite in the rear, leading this beer to be both harsh and cloyingly sweet at the same time. Something of an accomplishment, I suppose! Full bodied and a bit oily in texture. The flavor does improve as you work your way down the bottle, though that might just be the alcohol talking. Adding the yeast seems to help too. I like Moylan. I really do. And so I was surprised at my disappointment with this beer. But then, consider their Christmas Ale... A bit of an uneven brewery, this.","mzwolinski","Jan 22, 2004"

4.15,8.1,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 9th, 2004: This beer is a deep ruddy amber color with a medium thick light tan head. Sticky thin lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and caramel, along with a bit of hops. Rich and smooth with a lot of malt up front, as well as some citrus and hops for good balance. The finish is lightly bitter and a little earthy. Overall another solid offering from Moylan's.","Dogbrick","Jan 10, 2004"
4.35,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured a very murky amber brown color. No doubt sediment and carbonation present in that murky mess that formed an off white bubbly head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, carmel, some citrus and alcohol present as well. The flavor was full of malt, caramel, with some cocoa and coffee elements. The body was quite creamy and of a medium texture with a slightly bitter finish. A very rich, heavy barley wine that would probably be even better with some cellaring.","Wildman","Jan 07, 2004"

4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"If you want to get ripped, this beer is for you. This monstrous 10% ABV brew poured a deep reddish amber that had an unfiltered look. Tannish head shrunk down but a thin layer remained. Lacing was wispy and scattered. Sweet malt aroma was very inviting. Same sweet malts balanced nicely with some aggressive hopping. Thick chewy mouthfeel was perfect for this style. While ten percenters are not my norm, I found this heavy duty ale quite drinkable. it didn't have the rawness of Rogue's and though I haven't had Anchor's Old Foghorn in sometime, I think this stands up quite nicely. A great beer for a cold night.","Mark","Dec 07, 2003"

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"22oz Bomber. Pours a color just like apple cider and just as unfiltered looking. Has thick white head that dies quickly yet leaves some serious lacing. A sweet malt aroma tells me this is brewed to style and unlike the other hopped up american barley wines I've experienced recently. Malt is strong and sweet here. This is as full a body as I've tasted in this style. Smooth with a warming alcohol kick at the end. Flavor is sweet and malty with notes of fruit. Overall a nice barley wine that seems brewed to style in my opinion.","BierReise","Oct 24, 2003"

4.55,18.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Appearance: This massive beer pours a beautifully hazed mahogany amber tone topped by a conservative tan head beautiful small etched even lacing very fine but concentrically formed. Aroma: Sticky and juicy layers of hops with the barleywine malts very rich malt treat forming the base to be topped with copious amounts of piney west coast hops glazed with caramel or butterscotch very rich and warming good for the olfactories. Taste: Challenging complex tones but oh so rich and fulfilling juicy sweetness to the hop and malt combo wow this is good stuff the pine cone like hop tone dominates just enough doesn't overbear the palate. Creamy tones rush between the pauses of the bursts of the rediculous amount of malt and powerful hop presence very good stuff. Mouthfeel: Full bodied rich syrupy hop resin filled creamy fluffiness great profile big ass beer from california. Drinkability: The alcohol presence isn't overbearing toward the flavor but I bet after a big bottle of this one it hits you pretty decently, so it all depends how you judge the drinkability I judge it on the basis that if I could I would have bottle after bottle this beer seems like the one I would go for if I were in the mood for a full bodied lucious barley wine, I think it's amazing.","WVbeergeek","Jul 10, 2003"

4.02,4.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"For all its sweetness, this brew had a very noticeable dryness that did not make it seem as "big" as a lot of other barley wines. Plus, the flavors themselves were more subdued than any other beer of this style that I have ever had, except for maybe Old Foghorn. However, it was still very enjoyable. Actually, the dryness made it even more drinkable than a lot of heavier beers of this style.","Quaffer","Mar 08, 2003"

3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours amber in color with a reasonable size cream color head that quickly dissipates to a thin sheet covering the treasure beneath. The aroma is very piney with some floral qualities. The piney/hoppy aroma took me by surprise given my previous barleywines had a much more subdued hop character. The hoppiness continues into the taste as well. The initial taste was quite bitter and the hops abound. As I progressed through the bottle, I found the sweet malt to balance the hops very well. I tasted caramel, coffee, and hints of nuts as well. Hops are very present throughout the beer. I have to say that, at this point, prefer less hop character. Still a good beer.","philipt","Beers"
3.95,2.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,3,"Creamy, persistent, uniformily thick tan head tops a clear ruby hued brew. Frazzled lace remains. Pungently herbal and citrusy hop nose and assertive caramel malt combine with notes of leafy tobacco, mild carob, and hints of red licorice in aroma. Pronounced dark caramel malt sweetness upfront in flavor is ceded and offset by toasted malt and moderate hop bitterness. Fruitiness is mild, and indirectly perceptible by a concentrated, date like sweetness that emerges mid palate. Moderate hop bitterness surfaces late, and although it offsets residual sugars and prevents cloying sweetness, bitterness leaves the pervasive caramel malt character unhindered. Mild citrus and herb Columbus hop flavor. Medium bodied and slick in mouthfeel. Finishes w/ an impression of caramel syrup on darkly toasted bread. Old Blarney is a tasty and unique barleywine. Other than the dominant caramel malt profile, there wasn't great depth of character, however. It's more of a dessert barleywine than an everyday sipper.","marc77","0"

Big malt start that is somewhat sweet, the top thick and meaningful in mouth feel, the finish is pleasantly hopped, spicily acidic, droughty lingering alcohol bitter aftertaste and a fine representative to the style, quite robust.","Gusler","Oct 20, 2002"

4.35,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a murky looking light scarlet red brew.  A thin coating of a head dissipates into an edging that provides some, but little, belgian lace.  Thick, sweet caramel malt dominates on the nose.  The taste is very complex.  A huge malt presence provides a solid foundation.  Very sweet and almost cloying but not quite.   The hops are more noticeable on the tongue than on the nose.  There is some earthiness and herbalness coming from the hops.  Provides some nice depth to this brew.  There's a fair amount of fruity character also.  Some alcoholic notes pop up here and there, but not as much as you'd think in a 10% a/v beer.  Mouthfeel is chewy and viscous.  Almost syrupy.  Carbonstion level is appropriately low.  Damn fine brew.","Bighuge","Jul 28, 2002"

It's got all sorts of flavor:  a bit of chocolate, fruit, and toast.  It's a very heavy beer, with a solid mouthfeel.

Tastes start off with initial hop bitterness which is soon overpowered by the sweet maltiness.  Flavors include toffee, dark fruits and some faint chocolate.  Cloyingly full mouthfeel is almost like you are chewing the beer.  Very drinkable for a barley wine.  This is a real nice brew and is yet another good one that I have tried from this brewery.","Murph","0"
