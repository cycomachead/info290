Glad I didn't, as it's really good, but I think I prefer the standard Bigfoot Barleywine (fresh). I'm simply not a fan of bourbon-barrel-aged American Barleywines. Even if the hops don't completely overwhelm any barrel notes one might achieve, the flavors simply don't complement each other very well. I think English Barleywines, with their characteristic caramel sweetness, are much better candidates for bourbon-barrel-aging. This beer doesn't taste all that different than the two-year-old Bigfoot bottles I have in my cellar. Really good, but not quite as good as fresh and not nearly as good as I hope it will be in several more years. Still, there is obvious quality and complexity here and I can definitely taste it. I may buy another bottle of this in couple of years, just to see if I like it better after my palate has developed a bit more.","deadonhisfeet","Mar 27, 2015"

Some caramel, vanilla, and toffee as well. Brown sugar and bready towards he end. Finishes with more of the woody whiskey. Lots of warming alcohol, as expected. Heavy, chewy mouthfeel. A bit oily.

It now seems like a cross between American and English barleywines.  I've always really liked Bigfoot and this version takes it up a notch or two.  Impressive.  Really sits in the sweet spot for my palate.  I'm rating this a tad above the also-excellent Bourbon Barrel-Aged Narwhal; likely-reflecting my changing preferences towards Barleywines over Imperial Stouts.

4.22,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"2700th review! 750 ml bottle into snifter; 2013 vintage, bottled in late 2012. Pours lightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, oak, bourbon, citrus zest, herbal, light pine, and toast/oak earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate citrus/pine hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, oak, bourbon, citrus zest, herbal, light pine, and toast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of pine/oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, raisin, plum, fig, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, oak, bourbon, citrus zest, herbal, light pine, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, balance, and robustness of big dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged barleywine. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 30, 2014"

4.41,6.3,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"one of the better american barleywines around, if it even still is around at all. this is just awesome. deep mahogany, almost ruby red in color, the richest of ambers, hazy but not dirty looking, and hanging on to a short half inch of just off white bubbles. the nose is great, still hanging in there with bigfoots characteristic hop intensity, but its mellowed from the oak, and from the first whiff, an intense and wonderful barrel character is evident. i get a lot of vanilla and toasted marshmallow, a pronounced nuttiness, maybe almond, and a nice molasses sweetness among the charred oak. the flavor comes in waves, bigfoot first, which is huge for me in barreled beers, i get the hops in the middle with the grain before it. the grain doesnt provide as much sweetness as the whiskey does i dont think, but all the nuance is wonderful. vanilla for sure, maple syrup, brown sugar, and still the hops, which play well with the oak. the alcohol is invisible even at ambient temperature, and the carbonation is just enough to keep it alive and moving. i drank this way too fast, a sign of how elegant it is really, and a testament to how not thick it is. not syrupy or dense or even filling, a great texture in a style that is usually candy teeth. i dig this a lot, extremely impressed by its degree of refinement, and would love to sit on a bottle of this for awhile, although the hops presence makes this special and it may fade off in time. truly world class example of a barrel aged strong ale.","StonedTrippin","May 19, 2014"

Then, I heard they had a bottle at Frisco's for $25 and on-site consumption. Finally, it just randomly popped up on tap at Max's for a Sierra Nevada Pint Night (score). I'm glad I didn't bounce on the other opportunities because this one did not live up to the hype for me. I had been looking for it for a while, and it was sub-par. My friend had a bottle in his cellar and he said to be wary and that it won't be what you expect and he was right.

The warmness continues in the aftertaste, though there is no burn from the alcohol. This was a good effort for Sierra Nevada, but the hops were a little to dominant.

The taste of the beer is malty, sweet, it's got some bitterness to it along with a subtle whiskey flavor in the mix as well. The mouthfeel of the beer was smooth and boozy with a light carbonation. Overall it's a big beer, and sure to please any fan of the regular Bigfoot. Worth trying.","Knapp85","Jun 09, 2013"

4.74,14.2,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"OVERALL: I suppose that spirits mellow out and tone down the maltiness, bring out a sharp finish, and thus thin the head retention, so Barrel-Aged Bigfoot isn't as sexy as the base counterpart, but this barleywine is perfect in every other attribute. Similar to base Bigfoot, the complexity between taste and scent is extraordinary, but the tonal spiciness from barrel aging just does this beer wonders. A beautifully balanced, intelligently complex work of brewing art that will not be forgotten...","RobertColianni","May 28, 2013"

The nose features plenty of Bigfoot character up front with that notable earthy hop profile which is paired with caramel and molasses. The whiskey comes through next brings Ina string presence of vanilla. The hops are also very present on the finish and seem like they may clash with the whiskey. The taste tells a different story though. The hops a present up front and are smoothed out by a hefty dose of vanilla and oak. The flavors marry together quite well and make for a smooth finish. Mouthfeel is big with moderate carbonation. Overall, I was skeptical about such a hoppy barleywine being barrel aged, but it definitely works in this case. Very tasty.","homebrew311","Apr 18, 2013"

Excellent medium to heavy creamy body.

The aroma was quite nice, good whiskey and barrel coming out of the bottle and my glass. The flavor was just a mess for me. Huge bitter hops conflicted with whiskey flavors and then heavy brown sugar, just messy.

The time in the barrels has really given Bigfoot a big change. The flavor profile is much different (less hoppy, more malty & boozy), but there are still some remnants of it left in this one. I thought this was a good beer, and I can only imagine how incredible it can get with a couple years on it.","Resuin","Mar 02, 2013"

4.06,-2.2,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Served from tap into a Raleigh Rare & Vintage Beer Tasting snifter. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, earth, citrus hop, caramel hop, vanilla, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, vanilla, caramel hop, earth, citrus, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The nose on this one definitely stood out over the regular version of this brew with the addition of vanilla and subtle oakiness on top of an already solid aroma. Hard to beat that if I’m honest. The rest of the brew was very solid for the style and quite easy to drink despite the ABV. Even the alcohol that was present in the flavor was very well integrated to the point that you wouldn’t even notice it unless you were truly looking for it. A really well done barrel treatment to an already solid brew. Can’t go wrong with that.","thagr81us","Mar 01, 2013"

Perhaps it is the Boltcutter effect, but I thought that BA Bigfoot would be an all out flavor assault and completely lacking in subtlety. Far from it, this beer was rather mellow and never overpowering. The flavor of the whiskey barrel rather than the intensity and the heat was most noticeable. I like what SN did with this.

It's most noticeable variance is (obviously) the whiskey, but also the stark lack of hops, seemingly overpowered by it's time in the barrel. This potent ""older brother"" to Bigfoot is a welcome addition to Sierra's offering which will hopefully return (with more availability?).","BeerFMAndy","Feb 27, 2013"

Despite these feelings, before drinking this I was figuring that this version would probably go against this and be better with some age. After drinking this bottle, I think that is probably correct. Not bad now, but a bit disjointed and unbalanced. I think as this ages, the whiskey will smooth out and the hops will fade more and this should transform into a much more balanced and better beer. As suspected, my other bottle will be sitting in the cellar for a while to see what happens with this over time.","portia99","Feb 22, 2013"

Two years in the barrel really imparted a strong character. Same goes for the taste. It’s Bigfoot, but wrapped up in whiskey barrel goodness. Never too much of the barrel though. Really, the balance is exceptional in how they managed to deliver the best of both worlds. The oaky vanilla also nicely plays with the flavors.

Very complex on the nose with a lot of booze as well. The taste is not quite to the level of the nose with the alcohol hiding up some more of the noses nuanced characteristics. Brings oloroso sherry, rye whiskey as well as irish whiskey, somehwhat grainy and drying.

It was totally worth it and this beer surpassed my expectations which were already high. A very special beer. Talked to the local SN rep who said this is the beer that is going into bottles in early 2013. Went into barrels in 2010. Specifically Stranahan, Jim Beam, and Heaven Hill. Supposedly a mistake but they went with it for the 30th Anniversary of Bigfoot this year. Amazing stuff.","Gatch","Dec 19, 2012"

You'll be wankered without the bonging or beer games... drink up! I actually moved back to my small home town and this is the best beer they have to offer at the LQ.","baos","Mar 09, 2009"
4,-3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Outstanding for the style. Pours a slightly cloudy brownish-red with a small layer of foam with a complex malty aroma with hints of hops as well. Tastes rather astringent with lots of fresh hops and a nice bitter finish. Strong with good carbonation, great body. Hearty and drinkable, great for sippin.","stoutman","Sep 14, 2008"

4.27,2.9,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"2013 bottle: whiffs of coconut, big brown sugar and caramel, wet wood, lingering bitterness. Lots of dry oak, traces of dry piney hops from the base beer.","emerge077","Feb 18, 2008"
4.6,10.8,5,5,4.5,5,4,"The Sierra Nevada Brewery is an amazing place to sample beers. They always have ones that you have never seen in the store or have never heard of. Last night I had wood barrel aged bigfoot. It was aged in a whiskey barrel so it ended up being 12.5% and it had a nice taste of whiskey at the end.","RyanEley","Dec 31, 2007"
4.43,6.7,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"D: There are many beers that don't do well with bourbon aging. This isn't one of them. If you like Bigfoot, then you should buy copius amounts of this if given the chance.","klewis","Mar 11, 2007"
3.97,-4.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I was very excited to try this so maybe my expectations were a little high and I'm a little over critical. I always dreamt of what Bigfoot would taste like barrel aged, probably more so than any other beer. I think if it would have stayed closer to the original ABV and maybe a little longer in the barrel it would have reached perfection. As it was though, it was an amazing beer that I was more than glad to have consumed. I hope I get a second chance with this one some day.","Callenak","Dec 05, 2006"
