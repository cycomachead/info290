Lots of sticky hops up front that are somewhat stale at this stage followed by leathery malt, caramel, toffee and dark fruit.

Nice barley wine aroma of sweet malt and dark fruit. Taste is sweet malt, caramel, hint of orange. Nice medium body, creamy.

Doesn't taste like a barleywine, doesn't even taste like an IPA. Just a straight-up hoppy imperial brown ale is the only way I can describe it. Not a bad brew by any means, just not what one expects when drinking a barleywine","Immortale25","Mar 13, 2012"
3.36,-12.7,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a hazy apricot with a dissipating cap of tannish head and striking lacing. The aroma is much more malt-centric than I would expect. I was anticipating a very west coast, American barleywine but this features mainly dark, sweet malt. Caramel, toffee, reminiscent of an Old Ale. Nevertheless, itâ€™s nice. The taste paints a different picture. The hops are on the front lines, supported by malt bits similar to those found in the nose. This one drinks pretty easy for the style. Pretty good - certainly not "world-class."","yamar68","Mar 11, 2012"

Sweet upfront with big caramel malt flavors, becoming dry in the aftertaste. Big and burly, low carbonation. If anything, time has muted the alcohol bite.

Citrus zest is the dominant flavor with some herbal qualities and malt on the finish. Pretty assertive hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a very dry and acidic mouthfeel from the hops. Overall, a pretty good barleywine that is dominated by hop tastes.

Taste is candy-like artificial fruit, some citrus followed by a pithy hop bitterness that cleanses the sugars from the palate, making this a clean drinker. Carbonation is medium as is the mouthfeel; I think that the carbonation is helping to lighten the body making it seem thinner than it actually is.

It's flowery sweet and an odd combination of medium bodied but a somewhat resinous though watery in feel. Pleasantly carbonated. It's fairly drinkable for the style.

Complex malt and hop flavors, but incredibly underwhelming for a relatively fresh 9% barleywine--this is like bigfoot with the volume turned way, way down.

The aroma is of sweet fruits with plum and apricot present along with a good balance of malts present. The taste is slightly sweet up front with a mild bitterness in the finish. Well balanced. Not too much notice for the alcohol content as masked by the dark fruit taste of raisin and plum. Decent brew but not overwhelmingly good.","WJVII","Aug 12, 2010"

Malt flavor has a bit of brown character with very mild caramel. Hop flavor is noticable in its absence. Hop bitter is more grassy edge than the clean biter I like in a big hoppy beer. Flavor doesn't hold up to what the aroma promised and, in fact, falls short in general. Woody dry finish with some not so clean alcohol edge jumping in, too. Light body and strong carbonation.

Alcohol compliments the body nicely, warming the back of the throat, while the hops leave a bitter, sticky finish. Body is well-carbonated and a bit prickly at first, but settles down within fifteen minutes or so. The 91 IBU's are delivered with a bang, as expected per the American BW style, but a better malt balance would've really given this beer a step-up in complexity, perhaps pushing it into my upper echelon of brews.

If I were going blind I would think Double IPA. I dont notice any alcohol at all, I guess at 9% this is on the low end of the barleywine ABV spectrum, but still, very well hid. Mouthfeel is medium, low carbonation leaves a somewhat oily-hop feeling afterwards. Overall a great beer from Full Sail.

There is a clear malt presence here all the way through, but the hop flavors do dominate. If you like old ruffian you will probably like this. there are some sugary backbones, but mostly a hop bitter finish. A good offering from full sail.

The taste is rich, complimentary and wonderfull. The only place this one fell short in my opinion was mouthfeel. Given that english character I would've liked it to be a fuller body.

3.68,-4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4," Poured a very hazy dark, burnt ruby amber. Very intresting hue as the reddish tint was very noticeable even though the haze made it almost opaque. A one inch head formed on the top upon pour, that faded almost immediatly. What was left was a thin film of decent quality lace that circle around the glass. Smell was very sweet, caramel sugars hitting almost immediatly. The deeper smell after some warming indicated a nice bready, earthy malt back with a hint of alcohol, which at 9%abv and being a barleywine should be expected. The taste for me was just too light. I expect barleywines to make me sit down and to be a definite sipper, but this just did not have the fullness I would have expected. The finish on it was very dry, and did last a good bit though. The taste itself was very hoppy, with piney flavors the most noticeable, a slight malt back was trying to form with flavors of grain and bread, but was just too thin to really be noticed. There was a huge amount of carbonation, again for a barleywine, on this one. Lots of fizz and contributed to the feeling of lightness.

The malts come through nicely in the middle with caramel and toffee, but this has a very strong alcohol bite that really detracts from the flavor of the beer for me. Maybe if I had given this some more time to allow the alcohol to integrate itself more I would have have enjoyed this much more. I could see that this had potential, it just didn't suite me.

Aslo a hint of booziness in the aroma. Alcohol comes thru much bigger in the taste than aroma. it is preceded by a fairly fleeting rich and smooth caramel sweetness. Alcohol ponces on the palate next and is pretty large but not offensive. There is also a toasted coconut thing here. Drinkability is not bad but 22 oz definitely makes me a little cloudy.

Very nice aroma of spicy, floral hops blended with partly roasted caramel malt, a hint of sweet bubblegum yeast, and a touch of astringency. Palate is well-balanced between assertive floral hops and sweet-yet-subdued roasted malt. Fleeting notes of brown sugar and very light sweet fruit. Body is a bit sticky and syrupy, but not overwhelmingly so. The high alcohol content (of course to be expected in a barleywine) is blended rather well into the overall character of the beer.

The hops are able to poke through moreso than in the aroma, but don't do much to stop the avalanche of sweetness (bottle says 91 IBU...). Thick and creamy mouthfeel.

My bomber of 2003 Boardhead poured into my glass a deep roasted peach color, with a very slight chill haze evident. There is a delicate but slightly viscous head capping this barleywine, settling down into a wispy foam remainder. Aroma brings a mouthwatering vintage barleywine funkiness, impressive for a 2003 ale. Funky musty rotting fruit, rising bread yeastiness, and a hint of spice and alcoholic zip. Taste does have a definite alcohol presence, serving as the base in this barleywine stew of flavors that's mature beyond it's years. A complex mix of malts dances (or perhaps stumbles gracefully) along with figs, dates, smashed brown apples, and brandied apricot. Slight hop bitterness builds on the back of the tongue toward the finish.

Decent amount of hops in the nose as well and a touch on alcohol as it warms. The flavor stare with a caramel fruity sweetness with notes of a syrupy molasses type flavor.

Complex aroma with peaty nuances and a deeply integrated fruity profile (oranges, peaches). Caramel sweetness abund while light alcohol is noticeable, but as powerful as this is, it still appears very balanced. In mouth, thereÂ’s more of this caramel goodness going on, although thereÂ’s more hops than I expected, not old horizontal hoppy, but itÂ’s west coast all right. Chewy palate with peaches nuances, pears, citrus and a very mild tartness approaching apples which doesnÂ’t quite manage to give a decent fight to the overwhelming and coating sweetness. ItÂ’s not cloying, but feels very rich, peaty, earthy. Decadent full body with rather high carbonation to style and plain rich. This is perhaps not as big as I expected it to be, but taken on parallel with quite a few other peers, it definitely strikes as a great example of how to balance raw power. Still, I think forgetting it a few years would help to blend the different elements together even better. Huge thanks to skyhand for this top malty example.","Rastacouere","Jun 08, 2004"

It's not bad, but this characteristic holds it back from being a great barleywine in my mind. Passion fruits, strawberries and mango find time to make appearances. Alcohol lays low in the background.

Nice malty sweetness up front, more of a earthy hoppiness going on. But as it warms, its PNW roots couldn't help but shine. A rum-soaked raisiny alcohol warmth started to develop, it became more piney and resinous in its hoppy nature. In fact, its bitterness becomes quite agressive. Creamy and chewy mouthfeel. It really has a little of everything, but in a harmonious way. It doesn't hide its 9% alcohol too well, nor its 91 IBUs, but I like booze and hops, so who cares?

Muted citrus and pine upfront in aroma, accompanied by toffee and molasses dipped currants. Subdued, spicy, festive hints of frankinscence and bubblegum esters. Ethanol heat surfaces with a swirl. Medium lovibond caramel malt sweetness initially in flavor yields to a transiently drying combination of biscuit and moderate, clean hop bitterness. Becomes thicker and lightly sugared mid palate, with mellow notes of pralines and butterscotch well complemented by a rounded, integrated grapefruit hop flavor. Malt character becomes doughy late, and couples with a lately emerging suggestion of scraped vanilla pod, lending an impression of freshly backed white sugar cookie. Full bodied, with a smooth, richly dextrinous, viscous mouthfeel, partially due to the low relative apparent attenuation. Finishes lightly buttery and with a creeping surge of hop bitterness and alcohol warmth. Old Boardhead is flavorful, unassertive, soft on the palate, and superbly drinkable.

Extremely well balanced, with alternating emphasis being given to the sweet fruitiness or the dark, sticky, pine-like hoppiness. Good complexity. Finishes nicely with a combination of the main flavors and a light licorice note, but without ever becoming cloying. The listed alcohol of 10.6% is superbly masked, giving just a not-quite-sherry character. A rich, complex, smooth and remarkably drinkable barleywine - distinct from any other with its unique hop character.","NeroFiddled","Aug 31, 2002"

The taste is also on the light side for a barleywine, despite the abv.  However, it does have a nice malt backbone with residual sweetness and just a hint of fruit.  Not bad, but nothing extraordinary.","mickeymac","Aug 11, 2002"
