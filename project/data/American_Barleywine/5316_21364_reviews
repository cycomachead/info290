"Overall - A little less sweet than I'm used to for a barleywine, but still a nice full flavour.  The hos still have some bite but the beer still seems pretty smooth; guessing the age has mellowed this one.  An okay beer but not even close the the heads of the class."

"A decent beer when aged, but it just doesn't have a whole lot going on at the 2-year mark in my opinion and I've come to the conclusion that I prefer it fresh."

"Pretty good beer, especially for the price. Worth getting a few to age and for 3.99 a bottle, not a bad go to option."

"Old Boardhead is a big, sweet, and slightly hoppy barleywine available for dirt cheap. If those words resonate with you, jump on this beer. It won't blow you away, but it's inexpensive, boozy, and tasty. Sometimes, that just hits the mark. It's almost the malt liquor of the craft beer world."

"O: for the price its worth it."

"Edit: Review of same beer on 21 Nov 12. Similar aroma, much more of a dark fruit/raisin aroma and a bit oxidized, no hops at all in the smell. Flavor isn't as sweet, still wood and spicy, much less of an alcohol bite, Mouthfeel not syrupy or sweet as before. This one aged into a solid barleywine."

"O: Average bwine but for $6 a bomber you cant go wrong."

"Medium bodied with tight carbonation and a very dry and bitter hop presence that lingers over the sweeter notes and malt backbone into a boozy finish. Lots of sticky hops up front that are somewhat stale at this stage followed by leathery malt, caramel, toffee and dark fruit. A decent amount of sweet boozy flavor in the finish but the high ABV is actually pretty well masked. Overall, this beer is easy to drink but it's kind of bland and not very memorable."

"Recommended!"
"This is a relatively light-body/light tasting barleywine. Smells almost like a Xmas cookie but without being overly sugary or spicey (although I would say there's a slight cinammon/allspice note in there). A light roasted malt flavor holds this thing together. The high alcohol content is well-hidden within the flavor profile. Certainly an excellent barleywine offering."
""
"Drinkability: I don't know if it'd be proper to call a 9% barleywine easy-going, but this certainly is. Not insanely intense overall, with a good balance of sweetness and finishing bitterness that makes this one a version to try now, though I'd be interested to see what happens in a few years. With the good PQR, if I find another one, I'll do just that."

"Review from 3/2011 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red amber. Dense one finger light tan head and lacing. Nice barley wine aroma of sweet malt and dark fruit. Taste is sweet malt, caramel, hint of orange. Nice medium body, creamy. This appears to be heavier bodied and better flavored than the one I sampled a year earlier. I will return to this again and cellar a few."
""
"O- Aside from the appearance, which is lovely, this beer is quite pedestrian across the board (no pun intended). Doesn't taste like a barleywine, doesn't even taste like an IPA. Just a straight-up hoppy imperial brown ale is the only way I can describe it. Not a bad brew by any means, just not what one expects when drinking a barleywine"
"Pours a hazy apricot with a dissipating cap of tannish head and striking lacing. The aroma is much more malt-centric than I would expect. I was anticipating a very west coast, American barleywine but this features mainly dark, sweet malt. Caramel, toffee, reminiscent of an Old Ale. Nevertheless, itâ€™s nice. The taste paints a different picture. The hops are on the front lines, supported by malt bits similar to those found in the nose. This one drinks pretty easy for the style. Pretty good - certainly not ""world-class."""
""
"Reddish brown copper color, thin layer of frothy tan/brown foam. Very floral still, plenty of sweet caramel and typical aged barleywine notes of oxidized malt and sherry. Sweet upfront with big caramel malt flavors, becoming dry in the aftertaste. Big and burly, low carbonation. If anything, time has muted the alcohol bite. Not sure i'd recommend aging for 4+ years, based on this sample."
""
"Overall: Good American style barleywine, reminds me of strong malty IPA. Kinda missing that dark fruitiness that I like. Maybe I prefer English style."
""
""
"Taste is sour and tart its just a horrible drain pour. Mouthfeel is light and super sharp. Very bad."
""
"O: solid beer, but I was surprised at how bitter it was. Very hoppy for being many months old when I drank it."
""
""
""
"Overall: Quite tasty, I prefer a bit less hops in my barleywines. But as mentioned its a west coast offering so I certainly wasn't *expecting* less hops. Overall it's pretty well balanced, just a hair away form being awesome."
""
""
"Easily among the lower end of BW's for me. I like 'em to have a little more malt character than this. Too many chemical flavors to make me happy. A disappointment."
""
""
"O - A solid american barleywine. Not my favorite style, but I had high hopes for this aged. I've had it a couple times fresh, and this was slightly improved, but still not incredible. I almost think I should've let it go for another 5 years to appreciate it. Oh well."
""
"I want more, and when I said sweet above, not over the top, just sweeter sides of the flavors. All in all I really like this beer and can't wait to try some more aged barley wines."
""
""
""
""
"I am going to forget about the other few bottles of this i have for a decade, just for fun, not worth drinking them now."
""
""
""
"O- Believe it or not this is my first of the style. I quite enjoyed it"
"Suffers from a lack of umph. 4 years was too much for this one I think. Solid beer though."
"6.2/10"
"Drink- It's more like a DIPA than a barley wine but it's still better tan average. I think with age this would mellow but fresh it's too hoppy/bitter. Would like to have a bottle to age but won't lose sleep over not having one."
"Pours the color of iced tea with a 1 inch light beige head that fades to an oily film. Random thick smears of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of sweet malt, tea leaves, and citrus zest. The overall smell is somewhat muted. Taste is all about the hops. Citrus zest is the dominant flavor with some herbal qualities and malt on the finish. Pretty assertive hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a very dry and acidic mouthfeel from the hops. Overall, a pretty good barleywine that is dominated by hop tastes. I am glad I got to pick one of these up as I have never seen it in CA."
"Overall, its really good, never had it fresh, but I'd imagine its a little past prime. Some things seem a bit muted."
"Overall very nice, flavorful beer with hop character, which packs a punch with its high abv. Reminded me of some of Lagunitas' and Fat Tire ales."
"Pours bright and clear ruddy amber, off white head that leaves nice cap of lacing. Smells of mango, sugar, slight booze, cherry, sweet malt. Taste is candy-like artificial fruit, some citrus followed by a pithy hop bitterness that cleanses the sugars from the palate, making this a clean drinker. Carbonation is medium as is the mouthfeel; I think that the carbonation is helping to lighten the body making it seem thinner than it actually is. Overall not bad, but I can tell that the hop bitterness well get to be too much after one bomber."
"O- Fantastic execution and complexity."
"Final Notes: I've had better barleywines than this. Whereas this beer definitely has the hops, it's rather lacking in the malts. Tastes more like an IPA to me, quite frankly. It doesn't taste bad or anything, just not a solid example of the style."
"A decent barleywine. I found it to be a little sweet overall, although the nicely bitter finish provides some balance. The alcohol was very well-masked. I have another 2010 sitting in the basement but I don't feel compelled to stock up on a bunch more (although the price of around five bucks is very reasonable)."
"Overall: This is a very good beer. The price point is perfect, at about 4.50 I dont mind picking several of these when they are available and aging them."
"O: Overall this looks like a good beer, smells like it could be a good beer, although the aroma is not very pervasive. Mouthfeel is a bit watery as is the taste. Overall this is an average barleywine."
"Notes: It sort of didn't do it for me... I appreciate the smoothness, but a lack of complexity, and with only a final bitter note emerging, it felt a bit forgettable. Again, maybe I would offer it to someone willing to try a barleywine out of the blue. But it may not be such a good idea after all..."
"M/D: This beer is thinner than other barely wines i have had lately but that makes it far easier to drink. It goes down smooth and makes you want another sip. The apparent alcohol isn't as well covered because of the lack of sweetness so it's balance is a little thrown off. Not a bad pick, especially for it's price - $4.99!"
"A deep cloudy amber color with a decent fluffy oatmeal colored head and nice lacing. The aroma is a pretty hardy caramel cherry with whiskey-oak and nutty backbone. Very nice and bodes of some happy danger. The taste it brings is not as pleasing as the aroma. It has a grassy overtone with light cherry and honey heather. It's flowery sweet and an odd combination of medium bodied but a somewhat resinous though watery in feel. Pleasantly carbonated. It's fairly drinkable for the style. It's nice but not my favorite for a barleywine."
"Notes: Based on the nose, I thought I was going to love this brew. But I found the palate to belie the nose and was left with a brew that feels thin and bitter, lacking the dense chewy notes that I was expecting. Some might dig this for a change from thick barleywines, but not me."
"A: 4.5 S: 4 T: 3.5 M: 4 O: 4.5"
"D: High ABV makes it tough to finish off a bottle alone, and there's too much heat. This barleywine would definitely benifit from some age on it."
"I remember liking this more previously. Either my tastes in barleywine have changed or their recipe has. It's really way to hoppy for a barleywine although that could translate to a more interestingly aged beer. As it is it has an almost bad IPA linger and is not easy to drink. Most of the bite comes from the hops with alcohol being well hidden from the taste and only a gentle warming sensation. Very little redeeming this unless you prefer overhopped versions of every style."
"Drinkability - bitterness is a little intense, but not in a bad way. Very nice complexity, and overall very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"D - This is pretty good. A great value at $4.39 for a 22oz beer."
"Drinkability: It's nothing like any barleywine I've had before, way hoppier than was expecting, and this isn't a bad thing necessarily, unless you are in the mood for a good barleywine. I probably should buy a couple more to let them mellow with age."
"D - Very good. A great sipping beer for Christmas Eve in front of the fireplace. I have not had a barleywine in awhile, but this one makes me want to go try some more soon."
"Overall, this is the first barleywine I've ever tried and I'm impressed. Reminds me alot of a DIPA."
"$4 for a 22-oz barleywine sounds like a great deal, but this is hardly a barleywine. Pours a dazzling transparent mahogany brown with a puffy white 1"" head that shows decent retention and lacing for the ABV. Smell is so-so, mainly caramel malts, cotton candy and toffee. Complex malt and hop flavors, but incredibly underwhelming for a relatively fresh 9% barleywine--this is like bigfoot with the volume turned way, way down. Mouthfeel is actually outstanding, but just too mellow overall. I don't know what happened, but this beer is completely lacking in the instensity and flavor I expect from a barleywine."
"A very representative example of what I like in a new world barleywine. Weighty, but well divided between the dousing malt, and supportive, sanity-providing fruity, bitter hops. Still moderately crazy in its own right, and plenty drinkable by the same measure."
"A Barleywine should be stronger. Every time you decide to reach for a Barleywine you're taking a gamble. We all generally know what to expect... Strong, overpowering taste followed by a intense kick. Usually the ""kick"" should get stronger throughout the night.... Hence the 9+% alcohol content in most barleywines. However this one was a disappointment. The only attribute I applaud is the drinkability. Because of it's obvious lack of lingering ""barleywineish kick""... we have a barleywine here that's quite enjoyable to enjoy, enjoy and then enjoy some more of. Cheers and watch out for the headache."
"Overall: A smooth and delicious barley wine"
"Beer poured red with a nice off white head that is leaving some lacing behind. Nose is sweet fruits and floral northwest hops. Taste is a huge malt backbone, some brown sugar and dark fruits. It is nicely balanced by a huge blast of northwest hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and somewhat smooth. Drinkability is very good. No sign of the 9.0 abv as this brew has mellowed very well over the last three years. Glad to have tried it!"
"Edit: had several of these since my review, and while still good they seems to be a little inconsistent in the flavor department."
"Drink is great if aged that's for sure but new it's still a little hot."
"Pours slightly hazy, with a reddish, orangeish amber color. About a half-finger of creamy smooth head, very little carbonation and excellent lacing. Nose is mostly apple cider, with maybe a little vanilla and pineapple floating around in there. Flavor is very apple ciderish: tangy-sweet and carrying a larger malt component. Finishes long and hop bitter in a good way. Very good beer. Also well-priced at $4.49/bomber. Worth tracking down."
"An enjoyable beer, for sure, but not the best barleywine I've had. I think Sierra Nevada's is better, as one example."
"Thanks again to the market of choice for stocking this beer. A nice amber that fades into a dark iced tea color. There was a lot of fruit flavor like raisin and fig. A lot of brown sugar overtones, but doesn't kill the sweetness. Very hoppy. this was a WOW beer to me. I would drink several more of this beer given the opportunity."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable fresh barleywine. I wish I had the cellar space to age one or two of these, but alas, things are tight right now. It would be a great one to age for a couple years."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice amber color with deep reds when held to the light along with a 2 finger off white head that left nice lacing on the glass while settling to a decent cap. The aroma is of sweet fruits with plum and apricot present along with a good balance of malts present. The taste is slightly sweet up front with a mild bitterness in the finish. Well balanced. Not too much notice for the alcohol content as masked by the dark fruit taste of raisin and plum. Decent brew but not overwhelmingly good."
"Tastes malty sweet with tame hop flavor and strong hop grassiness. Powerful carbonation mixes with the hop bitter to wipe the sweet clean in the finish. Malt flavor has a bit of brown character with very mild caramel. Hop flavor is noticable in its absence. Hop bitter is more grassy edge than the clean biter I like in a big hoppy beer. Flavor doesn't hold up to what the aroma promised and, in fact, falls short in general. Woody dry finish with some not so clean alcohol edge jumping in, too. Light body and strong carbonation. I hope this beer develops over time, as I have a vertical from 2003 going."
"An excellent barleywine..assuming you give it 3+ years of aging. Fresh, it is nothing special. Aged, it is quite good."
"drinkability: worth the money, the alcohol is not present and its worth a try."
"This was a good beer with good drinkability. I would happily enjoy another bottle."
"Along with Lagunitas Olde Gnarlywine and SN bigfoot this is one of the better barley wine values out there. Not as good as the other two, but good nonetheless. Dark amber color with a decent white head. Aromas of raisins, hops and booze. On the palate, pretty similar with a little caramel as well."
"D - The dryness certainly helps make the sweetness easier to digest. At 9%, this is fairly easy going."
"Drinkability: pretty good. As barleywines go, it's neither overpowering nor cloying. It is drinkable for its strength."
"Dark brown body, light tan head, minimal head, no retention. Nose is a bit sweet but still a lot of hop presence, floral, caramel and bready malts. The taste was exceptional, very well balanced, not a cloying but pleasant sweetness with a slightly bitter finish. Full mouthfeel, good effervescence, nice job of cellaring. ABV extremely well hidden, quite drinkable. One of the better brews I had a Fredfest. Thanks to John Harris et al for pulling this out of the cellar for this special event. Certainly makes me want to stash a bottle for a decade or so."
"D - Pretty strong stuff so not a session beer but a very enjoyable treat from Full Sail."
"D - Surely a sipper as well, the aging has given this beer a real nice balance. I wasn't blown away, but it is a very good barleywine overall."
"Nice rich and sweet nose, some grass and herb notes but much more sweet fruit and spice. Rich and silky on the palate with great sweetness and firm finish. Alcohol is high but not really noticeable. Good effort here!"
"Not something to pick up again. This was an average and fairly boring example of what a balrey wine is. Bigfoot is similarly priced but way better with similar hops. I would recommend the Bigfoot over this any day."
"Pretty solid drinkability. Overall, above average for the style but not a standout at all."
"A solid barleywine, nice flavors with good bitterness to counter. Quite drinkable except for the fairly strong alcohol. Mouthfeel was a tad thin, but overall, very enjoyable."
"I'm glad this had at least a year on it. I'm not sure I would would have liked this as much with fresher piney hops and hotter alcohol. Hop heads will want this fresh, but I think more age could only make this better. Definitely a good one to keep in your cellar for a couple years."
"Mouthfeel, even more, some potential tart fruit, bitterness grows. Drinkability is tough, its a challenging beer, although one of the cheapest in this format."
"D: Aged (this was the 2008 vintage), this beer isn't as sugary and alcoholic tasting as other barleywines I've had recently. A sipper and probably not something one should have more than a 22oz because of the"
"bomber from the last round of No BS"
"Nice big body, smooth and mild carbonation. A nice sipper but I will have no problem sipping my way thru this bomber."
"O: artificial and thinner than other examples, if it is going to be this sweet i want it to be thicker, want more hops"
"Overall this is a great beer to reward yourself...just wish it came out more than once a year and had a wider distribution."
"D: A well done and affordable barleywine from a brewery I am just getting acquainted with. Could definitely use another year or two on it to mellow out the alcohol and meld the hops and malt, but after that--I see this being a very good barleywine."
"2008 vintage bomber. Pours murky chunky brown with minimal head. Nose- pine and leather, a tad dusty. taste- a hop forward barleywine with an astringent aspirin like bitterness. Some oxidation seems present so the malt has a sweet carboard taste. Dry, kind of lifeless finish. Watery body. Drinkability likely better in a fresher sample, although this is only a year old."
"-i really enjoyed the beer okay, but not for the style. its really like a malty ipa"
"Overall: A little too bitter at the wrong times even for a hophead like me, but this makes a nice sipper/nightcap."
"Pours a murky copper color with a quarter inch of head that has good retention. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma features the malt with a rich caramel aroma, bready, and sweet. Fruity esters, grassy hops, and alcohol round out the aroma. The flavor is likewise rich and malty. Hints of fruit and grass before the alcohol takes over. Hop bitterness is moderate. Has a great smooth texture and body. I enjoyed this barleywine. Nice hops and subtle flavors makes this a worthwhile choice."
"From notes. Pours very clear amber, active, modest off white head recedes gradually, pathcy lacing. Beautiful. SMELL richly sweet and malty, boozy, and banana estes up front. Dark fruit, faint grassy hops. Has legs. TASTE backing hop bitterness right there balancing the huge malty bases. Banana esters, boozy notes, and dark fruit follow. Strong sweet and bitter influences battle and balance, mostly, with some lingering bitterness. Sharper edges rounded off by the end. FEEL rich, full bodied and viscous. Alc warming, and some bitterness and drying in the finish. OVERALL fairly complex and balanced. Full, rich and tasty. Bit of lingering bitterness and dryness help make sure this one is sipped. Better than most Full Sail. At $4 a bomber, a hell of a deal!"
"pours nicely amber with a really sticky foam. not an aggressive hop in the nose. balanced malt of apple and pepper. a bit a pear... palate is citrus zest with a bit a pepper corn. mild warm. not enough slow down the drinking. smooth feel with no booze on the palate of nose. a bit earthy. a bit toffee with an herbal dry finish of a bitter. clean enough to be taken for a double IPA outside its zest and body."
"Unfortunately, the taste seems to have taken a turn for the worse on this one with a metallic character now in the place of what I presume was a hefty hop profile when fresh. This is still drinking OK, but I'll seek out a fresh bottle to try."
"overall a very solid barelywine imo..the lack of hop fade made this a true treat to be an 08' vintage..and the mouthfeel was good as well..im glad i got to try it...cheers to full sail for making a great brew and warming up this chilly rainy night.."
"D: Pretty smooth for a barleywine ale, but still has apparent alcohol flavor that enhances the beer."
"Thanks John!"
"this beer has held up fairly well. i havent had a fresh one in some time and cant remember enought to do a fair comparison. But at $3.49, ill probably buy a couple more to see how well it ages."
"D - Very good drinkability for this sipper. I have another 2007 bottle that I'm going to hang on to for a few more years. Old Boardhead is definitely a good choice."
"While this is a hoppy barleywine, it is very drinkable. It's light body makes for a surprisingly sessionable strong brew."
"Drinkability: The high ABV obviously puts this beer into a category where you drink less but enjoy your beer more. This is a great drink."
"the beer pours a crimson burgundy color with some off white head although the head does no stick around very long i would like a nice ring of a bubbles to hang around while i drink the smell is nice not to malty very hop forward and some booze but not bad the taste is kind of not to much going on here i taste the hops most of all its lacking that candied sugar dried fruit flavor we all know and love when it comes to barley wines its a bit to over carbonated to me and kind of thin it drinks pretty good ill have no problem finished the bomber my self although four bucks for a barley wine not bad"
"Overall, Full Sail did something decent here. A decent aged b-wine of a few years. For the price of this bomber, I'd easily buy more of it."
"D - Very easy drinking barleywine. Nice and bitter. Not too overpowering. But not underwhelming enough for me to pass up on it, especially for the price. Was a very low priced 22 oz barleywine!"
"2006 vintage bomber poured Dec. '07 out crystal clear copper with lasting pillowy off white head and copious lacing. I love it when barleywines come in bombers. The aroma is a bit light and tough to pin down. I get vague dark fruitiness along with a biscuit to hay like maltiness and vague sweetness. The taste starts off sweet, malty melonodin and biscuit malt. There's also dark fruitiness mixed with hard candy cherries and oranges. Body seems thin."
"D: Dangerously high drinkability."
"At $4.19 a 22oz bomber for a 9%ABV American barleywine, the value is fantastic, compared to other, even Oregon breweries', offerings. I want more. This was quite good."
"A really nice example of an American barleywine. Balanced, not overly sweet or hoppy. Would gladly drink this one again."
"Pours a deep and rich orange with a white head that diminishes to a collar and leaves a few streaks of lace. Classic American b-wine nose of citrus mixing in with toffee is also joined by light floral notes. Light citrus (orange and grapefruit) gives a decent bitterness at first sip, but this soon gives way to a big toffee body, with lots of brown sugar. Spicy and warming finish points to the alcohol, which is otherwise well-concealed. Mouthfeel is just below full, with a light and smooth carbonation. Straightforward and easily drinkable... I liked this one."
"This deep brown beer was poured into a pint glass. Giving a fair amount of foam then reducing to a light amount of lacing. The aroma of ripe fruits, malt, slight hop, molassas greet the nose. The taste of the beer is that of molassas, malt, slight alcohol burn, and crisp malt. Overall a great low priced barleywine ale."
"I totally thought that this would be better than it is. If I ever get the chance, I'll try another bottle, in case there may be something wrong with this one. If that one tastes the same, I won't drink another one, though."
"The alcohol was in the forefront here. Also had a funky taste throughout. Kind of bitter and medicinal. Alcoholic heat that stood out quite a bit, especially considering the relatively low ABV given that it was a Barley Wine. There is a bit of fruit in here to be fair, with little caramel malts. Don't think I will revisit this one."
"Drink ability is very high for a barleywine. Very flavorful and complex, alcohol is hidden well. Glad I bought some more to cellar for a year."
"The alcohol is well blended, with only a faint hint of heat at the back of the throat. Everybody has their own particular tastes, and there is no doubt certain general qualities do make certain beers in certain style categories qualitatively better in some sense, but I don't see Barleywines getting too much better than this one."
"Perhaps I've had enough barleywines that my bar is set pretty high, but I've been turned off by lots of my recent new barleywine experiences. Old Boardhead isn't a total disaster, and I'm willing to think perhaps this is just a bad bottle somehow. I got something out of it, but I'd be hesitant to return. Shoulda had one on tap when I was in Hood River last month, but instead I thought ""ah, I've got a bottle at home, so I'll try something else."" I'm a dummy."
"M/D - Medium bodied, a little on the light side of what I expect from barleywines. Alcohol is very strong and knocks the drinkability down a touch."
"The taste was slightly tangy. Ever so slight bitterness to it with a citrusy taste."
"D - One is enough for one night."
"D-Not real impressed with this....the aroma is really a unimpressive...average at best....as is the body...tastes Ok for an ESB or something along those lines but is not up to par for a barley wine..."
"D- The big piney hops have some full pungency to them which is nice but overpowers the malt to much and moreso as the beer warms. I think with a few years of age this would be a different beer but I'm not sure there is enough malt to make it an interesting beer."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a very cloudy dark ruby/amber. Great frothy tan head on top. Retention was firm, and it left a good bit of sticky lace on the glass. Scents of molasses, soy, urine(?), and toffee. Different. Not as sweet as I expected. Great full-body on this one still. Carbonation level is spot-on. The flavors turned a bit harsh with this one. I thought this would be mellower, but it's a little grating. Moderate-to-high bitterness. The sweetness is absent in the flavor as well. Expected more a toffee flavor, but instead I get some mild citrus, leather, and that bitter back end. Not too bad, but I enjoyed this more with just 1-year on it, instead of 3. Ah well."
"A light barley wine, but a nice beer. Should have had this in the winter time."
"What got me with this one... is that QFC had sooo many of them, and they were so cheap! $3.50 ea. I was amazed... I may go back and buy a lot more of them. I am always impressed with Full Sail Brewing... and they keep their prices where they should be. Thank you Full Sail."
"D: The intensity of the earthiness makes this a bit one-dimensional, perhaps, but I like it. Not for everyone, but I can't think of a better barleywine in 22oz bombers for $3.50."
"Drinkability: I've found fresh bottles to be coming up a bit short on the malts and having an abrasive hop profile. So, I was rather pleased to have a 2002 bottle cross my glass. While never bad, it just doesn't shine for me and, regardless of fresh or aged, it seems to be just a step or two behind the rest of the barleywine pack."
"Overall I would drink this again if given to me but I prob wouldn't spend my money on it. Maybe if I could get it on tap somewhere."
"d) very smooth and drinkable for 9%"
"Scott"
"More Barleywine! Always a good thing. I seek them out wherever I go. This one is a 2008 vintage, maybe not the best for getting the fresh hop flavor. But this one really is good, nice clean bitterness. A malty sweetness, almost thick. I really like this one. The guy at the store thought it was a less favorable example, but I disagree, and would recommend this to anyone who likes barley wine, but maybe not newcomers to the style."
"Overall: The feel and texture of this beer is where it really suffers but it could also use a little bit more complexity in the taste. There's so many great barley wines out there, I'd pass on this one. Can't beat the price though, 4 bucks for a bomber."
"Medium bodied, smooth and malty. Tasty stuff overall. Goes down easy and is holding up fine after 4 years. This is a good candidate for the cellar!"
"D = I enjoyed this beer, but between the bitterness and thinness, I'd have to rank it's drinkability down just a little. Still a very nice beer though and I would be happy to drink more of them."
"This is my first offering from Full Sail Brewing but I surely hope it won't be the last! My hat is fully tipped to Full Sail on a job very well done. Despite finding both hops and malt to be a little meek (and alcohol to be a touch immodest at times) I'd still consider this one of the most drinkable barleywines in recent memory. This isn't anything that need be saved for special occasions, this is something that should be had every week if possible."
"D-Although I realize that American barleywines are often balanced strongly to bitterness, this one seemed just a bit lacking in the malt department. This made the beer seem, at times, tough to drink, rather rough around the edges."
"D: Initially impressed by this beer, I found getting through the whole bomber to be a bit of a chore. I expected more from a classic Western beer."
"Fresh, zesty, fruity, deep, dark ,and delicious. Wonderful stuff. Tasty, tasty...vibrant fruit. high hops keep on ringing in...yum, and, I repeat, yum."
"A rather standard, unremarkable American Barleywine."
"This beer has always been one of my favorite Barleywines. It has terrific balance young or aged. The hopping is subdued but there is plenty of boozy essence which screams Barleywine. Zero oxidation after five years and although there is still plenty of sweet malt, it is not too chewy or overbearing."
"d: A great barleywine for an even better price.. Definitly getting some more of this.."
"07 vintage. Dark cloudy orange with a compact but dense beige head. Sweet bready malt with some grains, and a subtle candied citrus character. Fig and raisin too. Flavor is much the same. I imagine that this is a very hoppy barleywine fresh, but with a year it's nice and balanced. Good job of hiding the alcohol. Medium-thick body."
"Overall: A strong malt backbone with an nice aggressive hops followed behind. The mouth feel chewy, and luscious with some astringents in it. The finish is bitter and leaves an impression on the palate. I didn't know I was going to expect from this beer but I am pretty impressed. I will cellar another one of these beers and see how it turns out in a couple of years."
"D- wouldn't want to drink more than one in a night, although i would buy it again (if for no other reason than the very limited selection of barleywines at the store). goes down easy enough, but isn't a beer that continually has you searching the bottom of your glass for the last drop."
"J"
"D: I let this set out on the counter before enjoying and this helped define things a little better. At some times I swear I am drinking a heavy APA/IPA, it just has that feel. Another thing is that I have been drinking this pretty fast and still no alcohol flavors or smells. Even as it warms in the glass, none existent. Kudos for that!"
"D - it is a smooth BW"
"Overall: Very solid and enjoyable barleywine."
"Muddy, faint brown in color. Low carbonation level. Very hoppy aroma, quite grapefruity. Sharp and acrid bite up front. Malty enough flavor. Long lingering bitterness. Ok mouthfeel-very dry finish. I prefer a bit more sweetness. Ok overall for a barleywine. This might be better aged a bit more. Worth a try to see if you like it."
"I was a little disappointed in this beer, there didn't seem to be enough malt to balance out the hops. For a barleywine it just wasn't heavy enough. Pretty decent, but there are better BW's out there."
"Well recommended."
"Pours a golden ruby color with a sheet of off white head. Smells like molasses with bits of spice and hops still. Taste is surprisingly hoppy for being over 2 years old, nothing else really sticks out. Mouthfeel is thinner that I would like and still has decent carbonation."
"Pours murky brown with red highlights and a short off-white head. Nice lacing. Musty, malty aroma with wood, leather, and caramel. More caramel malt and leather in the taste, but blended nicely with the hop bitterness. The alcohol is warm but masked well. Long, sweet finish. A great barleywine."
"The beers pours a pale cloudy and almost awkward brown with a good one finger of off white head. Nose is slightly sour almost like a mild soy sauce. It is also sweet and slight acidic smelling. Taste is good with an initial sourness breaking through followed by a tart finish. A mellow sweetness, almost syrupy in nature mellow out the sour and tart tones. There's is also a bitter component in the beer making in actually quite complex. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is fine providing a body that well supported. This is more of sipping beer than a gulper."
"Pours a clear dark amber color with a fluffy off white 2 finger head that displays some staying power. Smells of citrus hops, some pine and grapefruit. Sweet caramel malt and brown sugar hidden deep under the hops. Taste is a bit maltier than the nose would have you believe. I'm hit with the caramel before the hops come in with the grapefruit and the lingering hop bitterness. A bit of alcohol in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is prickly/creamy. Body in medium to thick. Carbonation is moderate. Decent Barley wine, but I'm afraid it would have been better fresher. The second bottle that I have will be put in the cellar for consumption in a year or two."
"Not what I was expecting, and not what I look for in a barleywine, but not too shabby."
"D: I'm probably going to finish this bottle without even thinking about it, which is probably a bad thing as far as my health and sobriety are concerned. I'll find myself wondering where all that brainpower I had a few minutes ago went, and realize that, yes, I really did drink this whole thing that fast. The drinkability here is excellent."
"I've had previous vintages of this one before, and I still come back for more. Solid brew!"
"D - All the basic barleywine features here, which is good but not much in terms of uniqueness. So it could be a benchmark for barleywines."
"This beer was a handful. With a 22-ounce bottle, I didn't really need to drink anything after this."
"D: Not bad, a real tasty treat."
"Not the most complex or even flavourful barley wine I've ever had, but it holds its own, and strikes me as a great intro to the style for the uninitiated to get a grasp before moving on to further samples."
"d. Drinkability is good, and even higher if price is factored in. A pleasantly strong woody and malty barleywine with some subtle caramel sweetness and just a hint of fruit. Definitely heavy on the malt alcohol, and the 9% abv is very apparent. On the whole, definitely worth trying, and I'd imagine saving a bottle or two for a while could be very beneficial."
"The aroma was caramel sweetness with some hoppiness in there as well. The taste was malt up front, then the alcohol hit you. Semi spicy, with a fruit - peach coming to the taste bud. In the mouth it was full and finished great. It definitely left a mark on the tongue due to the high abv. Overall was super complex but a good brew none the less."
"Luscious mouthfeel in the middle of a taste explosion. I didn't know Full Sail had it in 'em! Yikes this is good. Their amber was one of my first favorites, years ago. Since joining BA I wasn't really sure if they could hang with the likes of Rogue, Deschutes and Bridgeport (to name a few). But Old Boardhead delivered. I'll definitely get this again, next time I see it. Good shit."
"pours up a darker apricot color, not much head. the nose is sweet malts, lil bit o' caramel, hints of peach. taste of sweet malts, definate hops, red apple, mollasses. the more it warms, the more red apple you can taste and discover. very interesting barleywine."
"again, enjoyed with the stumac and and his chick ...2nd round ... some pine, peach, caramel.... tasty and highly dangerous, very drinkable and enjoyable ... has something to it that makes it amazing ... delicious flavours in this complex brew ... a winner of a barleywine!!!"
"I got 1 more in tow for a couple years. Not sure there is much more to develop, but if kmore ABV/malt comes out it will be worth it"
"D - a decent sipper."
"taste is a bit on the thin side, dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, dandelion, ends bitter and dry."
"With the nice hop profiles on this tasty barleywine, I suggest drinking it young to enjoy its west-coast flair. My drinkability score often reflects price. At $3.50 a bomber, this is about as cheap of a barleywine as you can find, and still is quite tasty. Try one if you get the chance, sip it cold and warm, see what you think."
"Mouthfeel is thin, and a bit dry with an alcohol and lingering hop burn. Nice."
"d: Thanks to JohnGalt1 for the chance to try this one. This is still a little rough around the edges, but I very much enjoyed it."
"Note 2: I always score moderately on high ABV beers for drinkability."
"With this ale Full Sail has moved it's way back up to where they belong on this beer advocate's top ten list. Also at an astonishing price of $3.29 the price point couldn't be better, especially with the rising price of brewskies."
"OK...I just read the reviews and it seems that this batch (02) is problematic. It seems that some of the lowest scores of this beer come from this batch. I have 01 in the cellar. I'm going to try to forget this one and when that is accomplished open 01."
"D - Okay. It is a barley wine that looks, smells, tastes and hits like a barley wine. It doesn't wow me, but it is worth a taste. I might have again if I find it on tap. The mouthfeel is a little too thick though."
"The first sip brings a hoppy burst of grass, pine & resin, but the maltiness tastes a bit hollow...a bit empty. After the beer warms, the sweetness of the malts begin to pull through, as do some mild oak flavors. Alcohol compliments the body nicely, warming the back of the throat, while the hops leave a bitter, sticky finish. Body is well-carbonated and a bit prickly at first, but settles down within fifteen minutes or so. The 91 IBU's are delivered with a bang, as expected per the American BW style, but a better malt balance would've really given this beer a step-up in complexity, perhaps pushing it into my upper echelon of brews. Still, it was a pretty damn good Barleywine."
"I think it's really terrific; especially when it's warmed and the brew has taken a coating to your mouth. Enjoy."
"Medium body and low carbonation makes this a little thin. One of the smoothest and most drinkable barley wines around."
"D: Eh...this would be better in a couple years."
"This might be the first Full Sail beer that I truely like. 2007 reserve, poured into pint glass. I have to say this beer look amazing. Thick cream head, really thick. Crystal clear amber color with good lacing, this just looks like a good beer. Smell is brutal with hops, not the typical barleywine by anymeans. Taste is again dominated with hops. If I were going blind I would think Double IPA. I dont notice any alcohol at all, I guess at 9% this is on the low end of the barleywine ABV spectrum, but still, very well hid. Mouthfeel is medium, low carbonation leaves a somewhat oily-hop feeling afterwards. Overall a great beer from Full Sail. Again, the ""barleywine"" label seems like it could be IPA, or Double IPA, but still a great drink."
"I'm going to pick another up to cellar for a year, see how it stands up to next years and how the aging will treat it. I'd also like to try this one on tap next time i am up in Hood River. Good job Full Sail."
"A decent barleywine. Overall balance may benefit from some aging of the hop profile. For me, the sharpness at the finish and notable abv detract from overall drinkability. A very enjoyable beer, well worth the try."
"Pours a slightly hazed red/orange, thin tan head forms, drops down leaving some decent lacing, colour is nice. Smell is sweet, some toffee, tons of fruit, alcohol, brown sugar, pine, grapefruit, pretty nice. Taste is pine, brown sugar, toffee, floral, tons of fruit, alcohol, more fruit, pretty solid American Barleywine, everything there. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Pretty excellent for the style, nothing crazy but definitely nothing wrong, very nice barleywine."
"This is one of the easiest drinking barleywines I have ever tried. It's not the best, and it almost reminds me more of a Double IPA. Still worth a try, but not sure if age is going to do much for this one. This just doesn't seem to have enough malts to back up the hop flavors."
"Another very good vintage of the Boardhead... and I need to pick up quite a few more for the cellar.. I think it will only get better as the hops die down a tad and allow the malts to show through... but it is still very nice fresh from the brewery."
"Decent, but somewhat one-dimensional. No single distinctive character hints that aging would be worthwhile, I'd guess this one's better fresh."
"In the mouth it's amazing. I'm blown away. A fantastic balance of sweet and bitter - with plenty of both. Mouth -almost- as rich as an English b'wine but so so many hops - everywhere! They must be citrus hops but they've mellowed enough to make this so smooth and easy to drink it isn't even funny. Hey, if there's a beer that's me TODAY and that hits the mark right on the fricking dot this is it. Yeah, yeah, tastes change and whatever, but this is really good. Hmm. Will you feel badly, then, if I rate my westy 12 higher? Of course not - it's a different style. Well, in the style of barleywine this stuff is amazing."
"A nicely hopped barelywine - Thanks again John!"
"D - A fine ale w/ bit of NW hop character and overall light in feel w/ nice malt texture and flavor. A well crafted barleywine, just doesn't stand out from the rest IMO"
"pours a dark peachy brown haze with amber tints. little head, but significant for a BW. Nose indicates that it is a very american style (west coast particularly) as it is clearly hop dominant. The taste follows with citrus and pine hop flavors. There is a clear malt presence here all the way through, but the hop flavors do dominate. If you like old ruffian you will probably like this. there are some sugary backbones, but mostly a hop bitter finish. A good offering from full sail. I am excited to see how the ones in my cellar do in 5 or so. Good brew."
"pours a haze of orange in the body and a yellow/orange/tan head, with pretty nice retention. it seems to me to smell an awful lot like cohoho, a touch more malty and a major hop presence. the taste is dry and citrus all the way through and a ""pale"" floral finish. the mouth-feel is crisp and grows more so as it goes on, the yeast makes it a mid/slow drinker. overall not a bad choice, try her out if your into IPAish american barleywines, or even if like me you prefer a more malty selection, it's pretty good."
"D- this is an awesome American barleywine! IMHO one of Full Sail's best beers, and very drinkable at that. Highly recommended"
"I would call this beer more of a DIPA than a bw minus the syrupy feel, nevertheless it is my favorite Full Sail beer yet and it went down very smoothly, recommended if you can track one down, especially for the inexpensive price tag it carries, I think a year was a perfect amount of time to wait and drink this one"
"This is definitely a tasty Barleywine. It is still surprisingly hoppy, but I could see it actually getting a bit better, for my taste, with a couple more years of age on it. At times the hops can be a bit harsh and aggressive here, and I would like to see a touch more malt character. Still this is quite a tasty tipple and is definitely hitting the spot on this cool December evening."
"D - Very hoppy and very sweet. I am thinking this one needs more time to mellow."
"I'd like to taste this beer with a bigger malt bill."
"D: A nice solid barley wine with unexpected features that made it interesting to drink. I enjoyed the experience but doubt I'll be back unless someone brings it to the table."
"This is the Reserve 07 batch. Pours a nice thick amber head that slowy dissipates -- nice lace though and creamy mouthfeel. The hops are prominent but the alcohol is dominate. Almost tart and very nice sweet aftertaste. A great seasonal Christmas-y beer!"
"As it warmed up, all the flavours became more intense but I still find it very drinkable. Very nice BWSA and one I'd drink again with no qualms."
"A year or 2 of aging & I think Bob's your uncle! (You have a winner)"
"Refreshing."
"From a 22 oz bottle marked 2006 vintage this poured a clear red-orange with a light red-orange head and lots of lacing. Nose is sweet with caramel, fruit, and faint hops. Mouthfeel very solid, almost chewy. Flavors are similar to the nose with fruits dominating. Apricot is the most apparent, but berries seem to be there as well. Some bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable and enjoyable, and I have two more bottles to age and try again later."
"This is a really nice beer. Super easy to drink even at its abv level. Good flavor profile and aroma. Nice body and smooth alcohol."
"D: Very tasty, goes down as easily as any beer that is as intense as this one is, not very filling, excellent representation of style, even thought there are several beers with a higher ABV, this is a good beer to relax with when you want a good swift kick in the pants due to the intensity of flavor along with the 9.00% ABV. I wasnâ€™t sure what quite sue what to expect from this beer despite the compliments paid to it by Wasatch, but I was very pleasantly surprised."
"Smells hoppy, tastes hoppy, soapy, tea-like, needs more time."
"D- I think it's good but I also feel like it's missing its ""umph"". The flavor is there just feels like it's lacking some kind of punch to it. Still a good beer and might buy it again especially from the cost."
"Poured into a chalice a nice golden amber/reddish color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, some slickness and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slightly spicy, slightly sweet, figs, raisins, and some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, a little spicy, nice touch of dark fruits, and some caramel. This brew is very smooth, slightly dry on the finish. The alcohol is hidden very well. Very drinkable, a nice addition to the FS line-up."
"Toasted malt and resinous hop bitterness up front. Rolls over to sweeter butterscotch and caramel malt flavors. Hints of fruit and alcohol come through before the hops come back in and take control. Piney, resinous, sappy, with citrus highlights make for a pleasantly tasty hop bitterness into the long, warming finish. Definitely leans toward the hoppy side of the barley wine world, but it's quite tasty. Medium-full body with a lively turning to creamy feel. Very nice!"
"Cheers."
"On tap at Full Sail. Unknown vintage. Appears brown with red-orange highlights and a thin tan head. Aroma of booze sugar, hop oils, sweet fruits such as melons, berries, and cherries. Sweet, sticky, and boozey feel but no alcohol is present in the flavor, just rich dark fruits and piney hops. There is also a hint of licorice. Extremely drinkable for a Barley Wine."
"Old Boardhead is a solid barleywine. Enjoyable but there are, in my opinion, much better barleywines out there. I have another bottle in the cellar. We'll see what a couple years will do for it."
"Mouthfeel is more on the thin side. Has a nice alcohol warmth. pretty tasty"
"what a neat beer this one is! One of the few barleywines that I've had where you feel like they started with an english barleywine and hopped it up in a complementary manner to an american barleywine. Rich dark red in color, an off white head that lasts way longer than I would expect, sweet dark ripe fruit / toffee malts balance out a citrus / citric floral hop boquet. The taste is rich, complimentary and wonderfull. The only place this one fell short in my opinion was mouthfeel. Given that english character I would've liked it to be a fuller body. Other than that and besides that I would gladly drink this again. What a nice treat via trade - thanks Wasatch!"
"Not very drinkable, this one really took a while. The harsh taste well overshadowed any positives. I just didn't care for it."
"The body is dry and accents the limited complexity flavor. Carbonation feel is a little light but ok. I guess Im pretty hard on barelywines, but I could see improvement on this. Maybe I aged this too long or not long enough."
"Bottle courtesy of CBA: Poured a deep orangey color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention but great lacing. Aroma of sweet malt is balance with some citrusy hops. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt that are somewhat lacking in dry fruits characteristics and some citrusy west coast hops. I usually prefer barley wine to be more of the English style and less dominated by hops and more dry figs characteristics would have been preferable. Body was quite full with some great carbonation and no alcohol was discernable."
"Overall, a nice American barley wine. It's very in your face, but not too much to not be enjoyable."
" Poured a very hazy dark, burnt ruby amber. Very intresting hue as the reddish tint was very noticeable even though the haze made it almost opaque. A one inch head formed on the top upon pour, that faded almost immediatly. What was left was a thin film of decent quality lace that circle around the glass. Smell was very sweet, caramel sugars hitting almost immediatly. The deeper smell after some warming indicated a nice bready, earthy malt back with a hint of alcohol, which at 9%abv and being a barleywine should be expected. The taste for me was just too light. I expect barleywines to make me sit down and to be a definite sipper, but this just did not have the fullness I would have expected. The finish on it was very dry, and did last a good bit though. The taste itself was very hoppy, with piney flavors the most noticeable, a slight malt back was trying to form with flavors of grain and bread, but was just too thin to really be noticed. There was a huge amount of carbonation, again for a barleywine, on this one. Lots of fizz and contributed to the feeling of lightness. Overall this gave me more of an impression of a well balanced double IPA. May improve and bring out some flavors as it sits, but a little younf still for me."
"Mouthfeel is average. Again just barely missing if not for that mid-palate. This is still a very good BW. I'd really like to come accross a few more bottles too sample this fresh and with more age on it."
"The hops won't knock you out, but an easy-drinking 9% bomber just might!"
" Overall Impression: I liked this beer. I didnÂ’t think that I would. It sure seems to get better as you go. At 9% I guess that could be excepted. I would drink this again. I have another bottle I will set aside for a couple of years. Ill get back with you."
" for the brew Â– now looking forward to a 2005 version to check how this one ages."
"This is a fine barleywine. It's more balanced and approachable than others of the style. Not the most extreme, not that that's a bad thing. I imagine that by aging it for a year, Full Sail has allowed it to mellow. Nice."
"Very impressed with this brew from Full Sail...will need to find again."
"Drinkability/Notes Â– This was a hard one to drink, just a bit too hot and uninteresting for my taste in barleywines. It really just tastes like a big hoppy amber ale, without the added flavors that normally accompany a big American barleywine."
"Finished pretty harshly when it warmed up, becoming pretty tannic. I'd ask for quite a bit less bitterness in this brew... it seems out of balance."
"Taste; the fruits are more defined in the flavor than they were in the nose. There's a little bit of apricots, oranges and some hints of apricots. The malts come through nicely in the middle with caramel and toffee, but this has a very strong alcohol bite that really detracts from the flavor of the beer for me. Maybe if I had given this some more time to allow the alcohol to integrate itself more I would have have enjoyed this much more. I could see that this had potential, it just didn't suite me. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and with such a big alcohol presence I'm having a hard time drinking this one."
"05 vintage. Pours dark copper to amber in color and clear with a small cream head that fades back quickly. Aroma is of sweet malty sugars, raisins and apricots. Aslo a hint of booziness in the aroma. Alcohol comes thru much bigger in the taste than aroma. it is preceded by a fairly fleeting rich and smooth caramel sweetness. Alcohol ponces on the palate next and is pretty large but not offensive. There is also a toasted coconut thing here. Drinkability is not bad but 22 oz definitely makes me a little cloudy. Great to finally try this beer."
"I wish that I had cracked Old Boardhead's crown several years ago because I have a feeling that it's a much better beer when fresh. To its credit though, it's still mighty drinkable as long as your tolerance for tart fruit and citrus zest is on the high side. If you're cellaring the '03, my advice is to drink it last year."
"Between the ABV and the sweet/sour alternation, this beer is not the easiest to drink. Took me two hours to finish a 22oz bottle."
"Thanks, Oxymoron, for the opportunity."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Starts sweet, but hops assert themselves with the alcohol in the background, drying bitter aftertaste. $3.65 for the 2005 edition 22oz bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"Mouth is very thick and pleasurable. I would willingly drink a lot of this. Very well done."
"Overall, a bit below what I was expecting, but them maybe I was expecting too much."
"hey, i recommend it.. i was just hoping for something a bit more exciting."
"Pours a pretty amber-orange color topped by a sizeable creamy off-white head that subsides very slowly, leaving some pretty lacing on the glass. Very nice aroma of spicy, floral hops blended with partly roasted caramel malt, a hint of sweet bubblegum yeast, and a touch of astringency. Palate is well-balanced between assertive floral hops and sweet-yet-subdued roasted malt. Fleeting notes of brown sugar and very light sweet fruit. Body is a bit sticky and syrupy, but not overwhelmingly so. The high alcohol content (of course to be expected in a barleywine) is blended rather well into the overall character of the beer. While not exactly the easiest drinking beer around, this one is quite enjoyable and is an experience worth repeating."
"D: Smells was awesome, taste was too much for me. I didn't find it as easy drinking as some people did on here, not bad though."
"Pours a hazed amber-orange with a fuzzy off-white head on top. Smell is rich of sweet caramel and peppery alcohol, less hop aroma than expected. Taste is massive with a very full mouthfeel, licorice is very present and easily detected along with plenty of earthy malt....hop profile is present but not overdone, comes through with a slight citrus profile and the finish is tingly with spicy alcohol. A very good barleywine, full sail should be proud. This was the 2004 edition...perhaps that accounts for the more mellow hop profile than other American barleywines I have tried?"
"Pours golden-copper in color, and surprisingly clear. The nose provides that familiar ""anitquated"" smell along with a healthy dose of hops. Initially on the palate there is a rush of semi-sweet elements, followed in turn by the firm structure of a reliable BW bitterness that lasts through to the aftertaste. In the mouth this brew is somewhat spritzy and expectedly bitter, but it drinks fairly easily, even for a BW. Here's a beer I can't say No to."
"Color is a copper-infused dark honey. THICK head here. Lasted forever and really soaped up the glass. Lots of sweetness in the nose: brown sugar, Heath bars. There's just a faint note of a citrusy hop character as well. Flavor is decent. Very sweet. Lots of alcohol burn (too much?). The hops are able to poke through moreso than in the aroma, but don't do much to stop the avalanche of sweetness (bottle says 91 IBU...). Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Sits on the palate nicely and sticks to the ribs. Not as drinkable, due to the fiery burn in the belly. I wonder what older versions taste like after some additional aging?"
"Initial white sugar flavour fades and then comes back with pleasant alcohol induced warmth. Then the hops kick in and I am reminded of kendal mint cake. This is kendal mint cake for grown-ups though!"
"Pretty much the same except not as much caramel goodness. Also seemed a tad stale. Maybe it's just not ""ripe"" yet. Would drop my score down if this is the first sample I had to go off. Probably to a mid 3's."
"A year later had the 2005 edition and it wasn't as enjoyable, bitter."
"Quite easy to drink. The ABV really sneaks up on you."
"Drinkability: Very well done. One of the better barleywines I've had. No alcohol presence noted and immensely balanced. Strongly recommended."
"THis is a decent beer but not outstanding, could be a little more robust."
"04 reserve bottle:Poured a rich bronze with a big 2 finger fluffy head that leaves sheets of lace as it settles into a nice frothy top.Whoo the Pacific NW presence hop profile is defiently in the aroma extremely piney and cedery its presence intermingles nicely with a juicy fruit and brown suger malt characterisitics.Very balanced barleywine quite sweet caramely upfront with a hint of brown suger but a real big piney,resiny hoppiness finishing alcoholic and warming.A real Pacific NW style barleywine here hopped to the tilt 91 IBU's,very tasty but one bomber is plenty for me as it sneaks up on ya."
"Overall, a very drinkable Barley Wine, but not one I would savour."
"Drinkability Â– This ale will go with just about any big dish but I really enjoyed drinking it on its own. ItÂ’s extremely well balanced (not a heavy-handed PacNW ABW . . . not that thereÂ’s anything wrong with that) heavy-hitter that proves itself to be the real deal year after year."
"The beer pours a burnt orange color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and warm, malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with a mild hop aroma. It has a raisin scent; very nice. The taste is great. It has an intensely malty flavor that goes down smooth and slow and finishes warm, dry, and bitter. It has a toastey feel. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine barleywine. It has good flavor and aroma. It's not in the upper tier of brews, but it drinks well nonetheless."
"Body is medium to large with tiny pinpoint carbonation and a silky smooth mouthfeel. Good drinkability for such a new vintage, only 7 months old. I would scoop this up by the case if I lived where it's available. Apperently usually under 4 bucks a pop, great value."
"Pleasantly sweet and sour, but strangely so. Rich in bittering hops that come off like bitter greens (frisee) and pine sap soap. There's nutty biscuit, and orange blossom honey. Almost like eucalyptus. Rub your tongue with wild bergamot, then dip it in warm honey. Sounds better then it is. Perhaps it needs some age, but I'm wary."
"Liked this beer found it drinkable for the style..maybe could use some cellar time."
"Tawny dark gold with the small head. The nose is tempered with age and old hops. Full mouth with a very nice smoothness this is a classic PNW barley wine that ages well and drink even better It also loves a good cheese. Try also with a cigar I want more bottles to put down."
"The flavor is substantially sweet with some noticable alcoholic heat. There's some weird fruit elements going on (green rasin?). This beer is aging well... the flavors are well incorporated, an and all hopping subdued, but the alcoholic heat could go down a little more."
"Thanks to reddiamond for recommending this one, wish I'd bought more! My bomber of 2003 Boardhead poured into my glass a deep roasted peach color, with a very slight chill haze evident. There is a delicate but slightly viscous head capping this barleywine, settling down into a wispy foam remainder. Aroma brings a mouthwatering vintage barleywine funkiness, impressive for a 2003 ale. Funky musty rotting fruit, rising bread yeastiness, and a hint of spice and alcoholic zip. Taste does have a definite alcohol presence, serving as the base in this barleywine stew of flavors that's mature beyond it's years. A complex mix of malts dances (or perhaps stumbles gracefully) along with figs, dates, smashed brown apples, and brandied apricot. Slight hop bitterness builds on the back of the tongue toward the finish. Very smooth, well rounded barleywine, an excellent example of vintage flavor remarkably achieved in a relatively young beer."
"Old Boardhead is not bottle conditioned but improves appreciably with aging. It's also worth noting that at $3.99 for a 22 oz. bomber, this robust barleywine makes for an exceptional value. Be sure to drink it at near room temperature."
"I really, really like this."
"Drinkability is very high. Really tasty, juicy with right amount of bittering to offset the heavy sweet malts present."
"Given some time this brew just may turn out to be amazing. And at $3.49 for a bomber I couldn't help but get a couple extra to hold on to."
"Pours a clear deep orange body. No head and no carbonation. Smells of orange peel, toasted bread, and light peanut butter. Alcohol is doninant flavor along with a tart finish. In the middle is a decent amount of roasted malt. Drinkability and mouthfeel are average."
"What I have is an awful barleywine, and I would guess it's infected as Full Sail usually does a good job on their brews, especially the reserves like this one. Unfortunately, this one has to go down the sink. Today, I'll rate it as I taste it, and I probably won't bother re-rating it in the future."
"We did a vertical tasting with a bottle from 2002 . The ' 02 was good but this was the overwhelming favorite."
"Phenomenal, melded flavor. Seriously, this tastes incredible. The hops and malt coninside so unbelievably well. Sticky, malty bliss with notes of apples, plums and caramel along with hops that provide notes of pine and marijuana."
"This was a 22oz bomber from 03. It appeared to have a deep reddish amber body when poured with a surprisingly tall off white head. Fairly good clarity to the body and the head fell rather quickly leaving no lace as it disappeared. The aroma of caramel malt sweetness rose out of the glass with notes of fruits in the background. Decent amount of hops in the nose as well and a touch on alcohol as it warms. The flavor stare with a caramel fruity sweetness with notes of a syrupy molasses type flavor. The after taste is a bit bitter with a small alcohol bite as it goes down. The body here is full and thick with a nice mouth coating quality to it. This went down fairly easy and even as it warmed the alcohol never became the most prominent feature of the beer. Too bad I canÂ’t get these around here because this is one good barley wine."
"2003 bottle. Copper to orange body with a diminishing, but foamy and well-laced off-white head. Complex aroma with peaty nuances and a deeply integrated fruity profile (oranges, peaches). Caramel sweetness abund while light alcohol is noticeable, but as powerful as this is, it still appears very balanced. In mouth, thereÂ’s more of this caramel goodness going on, although thereÂ’s more hops than I expected, not old horizontal hoppy, but itÂ’s west coast all right. Chewy palate with peaches nuances, pears, citrus and a very mild tartness approaching apples which doesnÂ’t quite manage to give a decent fight to the overwhelming and coating sweetness. ItÂ’s not cloying, but feels very rich, peaty, earthy. Decadent full body with rather high carbonation to style and plain rich. This is perhaps not as big as I expected it to be, but taken on parallel with quite a few other peers, it definitely strikes as a great example of how to balance raw power. Still, I think forgetting it a few years would help to blend the different elements together even better. Huge thanks to skyhand for this top malty example."
"Nice looking scarlet red appearance. Thin, but dense coating of bone white head. This recedes to a rather thick collaring with good staying and lacing power. Alcohol soaked melons and passion fruit on the nose. Sweet drippings of caramel. And perfumey hops. The taste is quite sweet. And perfumey and minty. It's not bad, but this characteristic holds it back from being a great barleywine in my mind. Passion fruits, strawberries and mango find time to make appearances. Alcohol lays low in the background. This is o.k., but I liked the 2002 version a LOT better."
"Quite simply, this barleywine rocks. At first, I thought it was like a beefed up English style barleywine ala Old Ho (fresh, of course. aged Old Ho is boring). Nice malty sweetness up front, more of a earthy hoppiness going on. But as it warms, its PNW roots couldn't help but shine. A rum-soaked raisiny alcohol warmth started to develop, it became more piney and resinous in its hoppy nature. In fact, its bitterness becomes quite agressive. Creamy and chewy mouthfeel. It really has a little of everything, but in a harmonious way. It doesn't hide its 9% alcohol too well, nor its 91 IBUs, but I like booze and hops, so who cares? It's almost gone, and I'm bummed."
"22oz Bomber Reserve '03 Poured a nice clear amber color with a small head that is melting away quickly. Nice array of hops in the aroma along with a strong sweet doughy malt aroma with notes of vanilla and toffy. An aroma to die for. One that allows equal appreciation of malt and hops. Incredibly smooth body that is full and with a low carbonation. Slightly syrupy and sweet. Flavor is sweet and malty with lots of caramel and toffy. Alcohol is well hidden. This is the best Barley Wine I've had in years."
"This was a bit cheesey. Almost a little ass. it's perhaps a something a little wrong with it, but it's not so far off the norm that I'm really worried about it. The flavor is pretty good though. It's malty and a bit alcoholic. This was the '02 version and I'll be trying the '01 version pretty soon."
"This was a decent barleywine but not one of the best. I think the hops may have mellowed so much that the beer lost some of its balance. I'd like to try a more recent vintage."
"Drinkability: Judging by the short lifespan of this bomber, I'd say the drinkability of this brew is pretty good! Of course, I couldn't drink more than one of these in an evening, nor would I want to. This is a well balanced barley wine that would make a great fireside companion come winter."
"Deep brown color, medium head. Nose is caramel, malts, apples and dates. Big Bold Barleywine. This puppy reaches up and grab you by the ^#%$!!!!;. Malty and hoppy. The malt sweetness is balanced by it big hoppyness, then the alcohol bite grabs you. The fact that all three are balanced and rotate around on your taste buds is amazing. Complex flavors and very warming. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean, smooth and a little dry. Aftertaste is malty and slightly bitter, with a lingering sweetness. Bottle aging will improve this already excellent beer."
"Thanks to weefisheads for the 22oz'er."
"This was kind of a disappointing for me bacuase I have always liked Full Sail beers. There wasn't much to the flavor, and what was there wasn't wonderful. None of that huge maltiness and hops kick that I have some to expect from brews such as this. Probably on the bottom of the list for me as far as barley wines go."
"Originally sampled on 17 September 2002. Old Boardhead is clear copper colored w/ a light tan head. It has lots of malty taste up front w/ hoppy flavors at the end. It envelopes your tongue w/ its thick, rich malty flavors & stickness. This is a lovely barleywine"
"Clear light bronze hue. Initially thick almond white head recedes into a spotty layer than manages wisps of lace. Muted citrus and pine upfront in aroma, accompanied by toffee and molasses dipped currants. Subdued, spicy, festive hints of frankinscence and bubblegum esters. Ethanol heat surfaces with a swirl. Medium lovibond caramel malt sweetness initially in flavor yields to a transiently drying combination of biscuit and moderate, clean hop bitterness. Becomes thicker and lightly sugared mid palate, with mellow notes of pralines and butterscotch well complemented by a rounded, integrated grapefruit hop flavor. Malt character becomes doughy late, and couples with a lately emerging suggestion of scraped vanilla pod, lending an impression of freshly backed white sugar cookie. Full bodied, with a smooth, richly dextrinous, viscous mouthfeel, partially due to the low relative apparent attenuation. Finishes lightly buttery and with a creeping surge of hop bitterness and alcohol warmth. Old Boardhead is flavorful, unassertive, soft on the palate, and superbly drinkable. Dangerously smooth and subtle. Reminescent of a Young's Old Nick / Bigfoot 2001 hybrid. Big thanks to Jaybeerman for the bomber. Bottled 5/22/02."
"Not bad at all. A nice copper amber color. Very little head or at least little head retention. Very fragarent with the smell of hops and spices. This beer has a good first taste with a blast of spices which quickly dies into a bitter taste. This taste slowly melts away into quite an aggressive aftertaste thats a little harsh at first but goes away as the palate warms up. Overall a pretty good beer with quite a punch."
"Now the gushy emotional crap... Wow! This is very, very, very good. It's definitely not too sweet (I'm hypersensitive to sweet), but not as hugely hoppy as some of the west coast BWs. Very well balanced. This is a delicious beer that's a pleasure from the beginning to the end."
"Creamy, creamy head of decent duration, somewhat murky garnet appearance. Spicy and hoppy aroma, some sense of ginger snap to the malty part of the nose...nice. Wow, another combat scenario between hops and malt, and its close to an all out offensive. Ginger and cinnamon augment a raw cocoa impression but are immediately countered by a sting of oily resiny hop...low carbonation lets this counterpunching complexity have full reign. Finishes with just a touch of a coating diacetyl and with a hiccup of alcohol and aftertaste. Big, big flavor profile here...a cheek twister."
"Thanks to jaybeerman for the chance to taste this one."
"I like when it poured a light golden brown with little to no foam and very little lace. The smell was of a malty, citrus, hoppy aroma that was pleasant in the nose. The taste at first was had a sweet malty, caramel flavor with a stong hoppy finish. But after a few sips, it tasted just like another strong ale like so many others. There was nothing outstanding that made this beer standout among any others. Still worth trying, if you like barleywine ale's."
"Drinkability & Notes: A godly brew, beers like this make me weep. First of all I canÂ’t get it on a regular basis and may never have this beer again. Secondly I am so sad about the first I canÂ’t remember. This Barleywine rocks! Oh yeah, it went great with some bbq chicken pasta topped with fresh feta."
"A translucent deep copper to almost brown color on the pour, the head is or was frothy and modest in size, but it has evaporated to some pretty interesting lace. Aromas of baked apples, malt, fusel alcohol bubble gum tones, caramel, whew what a treat for the old schnozzle. Thickly sweet and lotÂ’s of malt at the start, the top middling and the alcohol starts warming the minute it leaves the mouth and heads for the Â“TummyÂ”. Peacefully acidic with the hops warlike in their spicy bite, quite dry and a nice lingering alcohol bitterness. One of the top 5 ""Barley Wines"" of All Time, in my book at least, WOW!"
"A hearty cheer to captain jreitman for allowing me to sail aboard Old Boardhead."
"2001 Vintage: Brown in color with reddish-orange highlights topped by a thick, foamy, light tan head that drops but holds a good 1/16"" covering and leaves some limited lace. A medium body combines with a light carbonation to give a lightly syrupy mouthfeel.. A bold fruity flavor combines summer fruits (melons, berries) and a light amount of dark fruits, with a super malty sweetness of caramel malts and honey alongside sappy, resiny hop flavors backed by a stiff bitterness. Extremely well balanced, with alternating emphasis being given to the sweet fruitiness or the dark, sticky, pine-like hoppiness. Good complexity. Finishes nicely with a combination of the main flavors and a light licorice note, but without ever becoming cloying. The listed alcohol of 10.6% is superbly masked, giving just a not-quite-sherry character. A rich, complex, smooth and remarkably drinkable barleywine - distinct from any other with its unique hop character."
"2001 Vintage: The color is amber and a bit lighter than most barleywines.  It's got a fairly light hop aroma and a somewhat thin head.  The taste is also on the light side for a barleywine, despite the abv.  However, it does have a nice malt backbone with residual sweetness and just a hint of fruit.  Not bad, but nothing extraordinary."
"Thanks to Jaybeerman for the sample."
