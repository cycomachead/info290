"Overall:"

"Dark brown with thin tan head. Aroma of raisins malt and booze. Taste is boozy malty dried prunes, raisins and molasses. Finish is hint of bitter and caramel."

"strong Carmel flavors.  bit different barley wine. Not as good as their other barley wine"

"not my thing and def to old"

"Big and bold with smooth caramel malts  all over. Warming, well crafted and easy drinking.  Well worth a try. Great on a winters night"

"O - I've had this fresh, but it is much better after sitting two years. This is easily the best barleywine brewed in WI. I prefer it over BBBW. It ages masterfully and I wish I had more bottles."
""
""
"O: Since I've had a few vintage of CW's barleywine, I have been wanting to go to this one for a comparison. I feel like I get the lineage now."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."

"Tried a glass of the Y2K and a glass of the BBBW at the brewery. Both are great. I think I prefer the BBBW version more, but the regular Y2K is much easier to drink and you notice the sweetness more. Very sweet bread like aroma. Taste is very smooth, lots of sweetness, some caramel notes, some fruit. Overall, a great beer."

"O: a great American barleywine with lots of big flavors and feel - ranks with the best out there - not to be passed up on."
""
""
""
"Pour is a hazy dark chestnut with a very tight tan head. Nose is heavy caramel malt and pungent crystal malt with a fair bit of cardboard like oxidation. Taste follows suit, heavy dry caramel, very sticky, a bit of crystal malt and a good bit of cardboard oxidation in back with a hint of green apple skin. Full bodied and chewy, prickly feel and well carbonated."
"I did enjoy this , as my first barley wine style ale I've consumed it sparked and interest in me to buy more barely wines."
""
""
"O: This beer develops nice flavors as it warms up and the alcohol is relatively well masked from the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"At 10%, the alcohol essence is well in check. This is a superb example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Kosmyk Charlie's Y2K Catastrophe ale pours a hazyish dark amber color with a very small non lacing head. There is a bold oaky earthy sharp aroma. The taste is very sharp, big oaky flavors, and strong earthy notes. Good flavors, flat body, even for a barley wine. Overall its very strong, and earthy, with some big oak notes."
""
"O) Perfect example of an American/English BW. Love the BA version and can't wait for more of this!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not really much to say, besides the little blurb with which I started the review. This is an almost perfected American barleywine. Great stuff."

""
"Overall I thought this was going to be way too boozey, but the taste is actually very well balanced with caramel and hops"
""
""
"In the end, I generally have issues with this style, but the medium plus malt backbone helps this beer out. Definitely for those into a bigger more robust Sierra Nevada Bigfoot."

"An excellent example of an American Barleywine. I like it plenty fresh and I am sure with age, the beer will evolve, and maybe improve."
""
"Overall: I did not expect the notes of cherries. This is what IMO differentiated from other barleywines. CW sure does pull of a unique barleywine. Glad to try this."
""
"O - A big beer to say the least, Central Waters' Kosmyk Charlie's Y2K Catastrophe Ale balances a rich and complex English-style barleywine malt profile that explores bread slices and sweet confections with that of a hoppy American barleywine. The result is an absolutely lovely, high-octane brew that will, without a doubt, sustain anyone through the apocalypse. Be sure to stock up."

"I love these guys! Now up from one of my top 5 to top 3 favorite breweries of all time!! The appearance on this beer is awesome, half inch creamy khaki head, and a deep brownish crimson color that is very appealing when held up to the light. Smells very sweet and malty, hints of honey and nuttiness. The flavor profile on this beer is INTENSE! perhaps I should have given this one a few months to age and tame a bit, yowser! I get an onslaught of everything I picked up in the aroma the sweet maltiness, the subtle honey-nut flavor and some pretty strong carameliness which I love, this is one RICH beast!! I think I would have given this a perfect 5 in taste had I aged it a bit. I'm definitely going to pick up a few more of these and cellar them. Mouthfeel is a little high in carbonation for my liking in this style, like medium high, not a silky on the tongue as I would like either. One of the better examples I've had of this style. awesome"

"Central Waters Kosmyk Charlie's Y2K Catastrophe Ale ---4/5."
""
""
""

"Pours out a dark brown in color with a nice finger head that is light brown in color. Smell is dark grains in the forefront, pretty earthy, seems to be a little hops in the background but nothing fruity -- more something to balance the beer out. Taste is definitely some dark grains, burnt sugar, burnt malts, and a little bit of hops in the back to balance things out a little. It tastes really earthy like the nose. I really don't get any booze from this but I seem to need a little more booze it seems to taste it than others. Mouthfeel is medium thick/maybe a little thicker from the amount of carbonation. Overall it's a great barleywhine that is not sweet at all. There is absolutely no sweetness which is different for your typical beer of this style. I like it and would buy it again."

"Overall another excellent beer from Central Waters. This just came out and I will be excited to pick up some more for aging. Have heard good things about this one with some age on it."

"2011 bottle from Adam. thanks! Pours a deep murky amber with small khaki head.aroma of figs, plums, caramel, vanilla, and even a bit of bourbon and booze, though this isn’t the BA version. Flavor is big fruits, mostly figs, some apple, raisins, bready, toffee biscuits. A hint of some booze. Yum. Creamy and heavy body, but with plenty of carbonation keeping this drinkable. Very nice beer, and only my 2nd from CW. I can definitely see this turning out beautifully in a bourbon barrel."
""
""
""
""
"Well, if I ever miss the bottle release of certain harder-to-find CW offerings, I need to remember my boys at Local Option... Anyway, this stuff pours a slightly murky garnet topped by a half-finger of wan khaki foam. The nose comprises sye bread, sweet caramel, light toffee, mild rum, light fig, light raisin, light candied orange peel, and a strong boozy backdrop. The taste brings in more of the same, with the bread coming through a bit stronger, the candied fruit as well, and the booze hanging around long enough to have its presence felt with every sip. Luckily, it's somehow not overpowering. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly drying finish. Overall, a solid, strong b-wine, something I could easily see being used as a body warmer in the dead of winter."

"This was stellar, and hits all the things I like in an American barleywine. Central Waters continues to impress me, particularly with their bigger and darker beers. Seek this out."

"M - Full body. Viscous. Light carbonation."
"All in all, a toasty, malty, high alcohol (none given on the label, I'm only guessing). treat, to be sure. Fits all the marks of a true barleywine."

"Big thanks to michigan for extraing me this long tinge want. Enjoyed from my central waters snifter. Beer pours a fairly muddy brown with a generous off white head. Beer stinks of toffee and caramel and bready malts. Still a nice hop presence too. Not bad for a 2012. Taste is great. Aggressively faded hops give a real nice buttery caramel toffee with a hint of grape. Easy drinker. Really exceeded my expectations. Great barley wine worth checking out."

"O - A solid barleywine."
"Poured out as a nice amber color with a decent white head on top. The smell of the beer is malty with a hoppy aroma. The taste is also loaded with toasted caramel malt and hops. It's piney with a sweetness in the background. The mouthfeel is smooth, nicely carbonated and slick. Overall this beer is pretty damn good. Very enjoyable."

"Lowish B+"
""
""
"Overall: Very solid American barleywine, but doesn't stand out all that much from other options. I'll take Central Waters BBBW any day."
"I can see how the bourbon barrel aging really helps this beer. Y2K is a bit on the hoppy side with the malt backbone fighting futily through the big, hop presence. A decent beer overall but not nearly as good as the barrel-aged version. Worth a try still to see what the base is all about."
""
""
""
""
"This is ultimately a solid effort and definitely worth a try, especially if you live within (or near) the brewery's area of distribution. 2011 Batch (""Barleywine 2011"") sampled on 3/12/2013, with much thanks to BA ""grancty """
"O: Nice barleywine that should age well, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to try it again. Let's see what putting this baby in bourbon barrels for a while did! 3.5"
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this take on the American Barleywine style. I liked that it wasn't overridden with hops but focused more on balance. The vanilla tones lended great complexity and hops met the alcohol head on."
"Highly recommended B-wine... Nicely drinkable, especially for the price."
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic. Central Waters is extremely underrated, so much flavor in this one."
"O- I am very new to the Barleywine seen, but this is a delicious offering. With a year on this particular bottle things seem to be very well balance. Huge malt sweetness, strong booze and still has a nice hop backbone. Unfortunately, I only have one more bottle in the cellar but hopefully I can get back to the local shop to get some more. Can't wait to see what a few more years of aging would do! Albeit I'm a novice in the barleywine genera, but i highly recommend!"

"O: this is my first offering by CW. and i must say that this is quite nice. i honestly wish the grassy notes were dialed back a bit, because it really starts to come out as the beer approaches room temp (further creating and imbalance). As far as $4$ goes, I think this shoud sit around $15-18 a 4 pk. (i got it for $20). So in my honest opinion, its above its calling card."
"Paired with Super Mario Bros Wii-U"

"Overall. An awesome barleywine. Quite dry with great bitterness, but not overwhealming in the hop flavours. Thanks again Steasy66!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm not very well versed in the barleywine style, but i really enjoyed this beer. It was a really well balanced offering of some dank vegetal hops and sweet malts. Central waters is a great brewery and I will continue to seek out there beers."
""
"O: A great tasting and feeling barlewine. ABV is somewhat hidden. I love the BA version of this and it was nice to try the base beer."
"Overall- Barley wines are far from my style, but this is my favorite to date. It has a nice sweetnes but the booze, smoke and hop finish is somewhat off putting for me. I know if you are a barley wine fan you will definitly enjoy."
""
""
"Much more malt centric on the palate... sweet dessert flavors, some overripe fruit, caramel malt, a boozy sting on the tail end. Good stuff, I'd still love to track down the barrel aged version."
""
"overall a damn good barleywine, but not as good as the barrel aged version."

"M: Full bodied. Chewy as hell."

"O: A pretty good American barleywine, even with some age on it."

"zac16125"
"O: A decent BW. A bit heavy on the astringency and the burnt flavor is somewhat distracting. But overall, fairly drinkable, with a good range of flavors."
"O: Almost used big for a third time to lead off a description. This is a big, smooth, easy drinkin' barleywine. I'm generally not a huge barleywine fan but this one is most excellent."
"This was a big beer. Very roasty for a barleywine. Toffee, caramel, alcohol, almost a very burnt popcorn taste (in a good way). Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and would love to try the BA version. It is definitely a sipper, though, and it would be dificult to drink more than one in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty and certainly worth a try. I'm glad I had the chance to try this one,"
""
""
""
""
""
"O= This is actually a really good beer. I loved the barrel aged version and this is just as good. The stouts were a bit of a disspointment but this is great. Great job CW keep it up."
""
"O: While I expected a bit sweeter beer due to the reviews before me I think this is a good representation of an American Barleywine. Central Waters does not dissapoint once again...definitely one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
"O: Good American Barleywine, I think I preferred this one slightly more on the fresh end"
"O: A very tasty Barleywine, but definitely one that could use some time to mellow. My only concern would be that out could get a little too one sided with the sweet malts. Would drink again, but the BA version is way better."
"overall: another awesome brew by CW. a little bit stronger in the spectrum of barley wines, but the huge caramel flavors make it unique enough to stand out. looking forward to see how it ages"
""
""
"O: One of the better aged barleywines that I've had. Lots of complexity and depth. Hard to find much wrong with it."
""
""
"O This is a great beer, thoroughly enjoyed it, but considering the barrel aged version is not hard to come by and the cost is the same, I would go with barrel aged every time."
""
""
"O - I will be revisiting this one. Very good."
""
"Fuller body, somewhat milder carbonation, creamy and lingering on the tongue. A nice barleywine with a definite sense of age to it...not quite great though."
""
""
"D/O: Recognizable as a barleywine, though not particularly memorable or even appealing, this beer fails to advance beyond mediocrity. Bitterness is the single least appealing quality, bracing in its intensity yet uninteresting in its lack of associated qualities. This beer does not deliver the decadent experience that a barleywine ought to."
"Overall a decent barleywine. Not fantastic, but good."
"A pretty basic and a bit boring Barleywine."
""
""
"A solid, rather malty barleywine. I wish the bitterness didn't kick in so quickly in the taste, but can I really complain? It's a good beer, and one of the better balanced straight-up barleywines I've had. I'm enjoying it more as I get further down the glass, but maybe that's the alcohol talking already..."
""
"Light tan head piled high from a high pour over a hazy dark copper ale. High alcohol (10%) floats above strong dark fruit, raisin, fig with significant floral hop over top. Slightly burnt malt with oak continued over fig, dark fruit that fueled by alcohol hotness. Says aged for a year on the website, but doesn't say how or in what. Guessing straight oak barrels because there seems to be wood, but not added whiskey or other flavor. Sweet and pungent off the back. Rough and raw flavor that's fun to drink, but lacks a certain elegance."
""
"O: A decent and drinkable barleywine. Both bitter and sweet throughout."
"O- This barley-wine is vary drinkable. Almost session-able (HAHA if that were even possible for barleywines. It is really a beautiful beer in terms of color and appearance. A great barley wine. I would highly recommend this too friends who are new to the style. Besides the tiny kick at the end that it gives (which is hardly noticeable) this is an absolutely perfect beer!"
""
""
"Cost: $3.99 for a single bottle or $11.99 for a four pack."
"This is a pretty good barleywine, the label says it is aged at the brewery for a year before release. I believe them, both the smell and taste remind me of Bigfoot with a year or two on it--not a lot of hops, and more sweetness and fruit flavors."
"(D)- Overall, a solid barleywine. I can see how this becomes the surperior Bourbon Barrel Barleywine. Malty and sweet, but balanced and smooth too. The hop level is quite high though; I think this would benefit from some extended time."
""
""
""
""
"Full thickness, syrupy, light carbonation towards the back quarter of it. Sticky biting bitterness combining with hot, sometimes cloying alcohol. Very powerful, very sweet, very hopped, very hot."
""
"An exceptional barleywine from a jewel of Midwest brewing. The pour produces a ruddy, reddish brown liquid with a haze produced by tiny particles suspended - manna in the heaven that is this brew. An even blanket of manila foam tops the beer, with lacing that is spotty but clings modestly like barnacles on a ship's hull. The aroma is rich and decadent - buttery, raisin studded spice cake doused in rum and orange liqueur. The flavor follows the smell, but with a bracing bitterness. Cloves and orange flavored dark chocolate is interwoven in the intense hoppiness. More butter and cream notes add to the endless complexity and decadence of the palate. A unique, delicious beer. Spectacular."
"O - This beer is just straight up awesome. Far better than I was expecting.... Needless to say I not only would try it again, I'm stocking up like it was bottled water on the eve of the zombie apocalypse."
""
""
""
"Weirdly, I'm not sure I've had a straight-up barleywine in a while, & I don't know why. This is a good, solid barleywine, more drinkable than complex. Session barleywine? Hell yeah!"
""
"O- I liked this beer but the citrus punch through me just a bit. Think I will enjoy this beer even more next time knowing what to expect."
"D This one is pretty complex and definitely a sipper; the ABV isn't too noticeable except for a warmth in the throat."
"D and O: Really enjoyable Barleywine. One of my personal favorites, and it's a great price point. Central Waters really puts out some nice products."
""
""
"O: This might be the cheapest Barleywine around, and its certainly not the worst (or even close really). Not my favorite by any means, but loads of flavor and a terrific value."
"Pours a brownish caramel color with a nice creamy head on it. The nose consists of vanilla and some sticky, caramel malts. The taste is the nose in liquid form - caramel malts move to vanilla flavors. Sweet up front. Some resinous, piney hops move in to balance the sweetness and round off the barleywine profile. The mouth is a little thin, but still pretty good. This is a solid barleywine with good complexity. Recommended!"
""
""
"Overall: One of the best Barleywines I have had. Need to try the Bourbon barrel aged one."
"This has to be one of the best fresh american barleywines that I have had. Drinks great with great flavor. Can't wait to get my mitts on the barrel aged version."
"O. Barelywines are something I enjoy infrequently because they are typically boozing and so damn big. Though Y2K certainly fits into this description, it retains a nice drinkability mainly because of its dryness. The lingering hop bitterness detracts somewhat from what is overall a good beer."
""
""
"O: A pretty simple barleywine. A good example of the style, although the taste doesn't quite live up to the smell. Even the label says this has been aged for a year, the hop bitterness is unfortunately still there."
"The flavor is mostly sweet. It has a nice caramel earthiness with some bitterness. Enough hops for it to be nicely balanced. Not too boozy but it is there."
""
""
"D/O- Very solid barleywine from Central Waters. The whole time I was drinking this I thought ""this would be a great candidate for barrel aging""...go figure, hah. Thanks a ton Brian (4DAloveofSTOUT) for headin' up to cheeseheadville to snatch this up for me!"
"Overall: This barleymine is tasty, but it almost reminds me of a Quad. I still liked it, but this is not a super sweet malt bomb barleywine. I think that its a nice sipper beer and some age will do this beer some good!"
"Overall, a really excellent barleywine. Unlike most barleywines that are fresh this beer is very balanced. I realize it ages for a year before they release it and that helps let the bitterness fall out. With some additional aging this will be a fantastic barleywine."
"12/2012 EDIT: Had a 2011 and 2012 bottle side by side tonight. There wasn't a huge difference between the two but when I did a blind taste test of each, I was able to tell which one was which. The 2011 has slightly less alcohol burn and the smell is much richer."

"Thanks to seeswo for the trade. 2011 vintage (I think). 12oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours a semi-hazy mahogany with a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that quickly dissipates, forming a frothy band around the edges and an oily slick across the surface. Some spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses toffee, a suggestion of milk chocolate, an earthy quality and a trace of booze. Taste follows nose with the addition of faint citrus notes and some hops bittering that comes out in the middle. Mouthfeel is medium-light in consistency with an even carbonation and a slight acidity. There's also a little residual alcohol heat, but nothing significant. Overall, a solid American Barleywine with good aging potential. Having just had the BA version of this beer, I have to say that the barrel aging does a lot for this beer."
"O: Not as good as the world famous Bourbon Barrel Barleywine, but still pretty nice."
"all in all, wow. amazing brew with a complex and interesting flavor profile. maybe this just hits all the notes I'm looking for in a barleywine, but this one blows me away."
"thick brown, though you can see some light through it, no head and a nice lace top it off. Smell is hopped for sure, but with a subtle sugary undertone, and a hint of alcohol too. Taste is not very strong at all. There is the natural piney hoppness you would expect from a barley wine, but not too strong, there is also a sugary, nuttiness about it as well. The alcohol is there, and that keeps this a sipper. It is actually nicely carbonated, and not harsh going down, has the warm feeling on the way. Overall this was a good brew, I would not mind having another and certainly kept me warm this evening."
"O - This was a surprisingly good treat that is an easy drinking barleywine with a good flavor profile. Wouldn't mind having this again."
"Thick body, light carbonation; overall a great barleywine that I can highly recommend."
"Pretty tasty and complex but a touch too boozy. I would probably appreciate this more in the winter."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it was a decent beer but fell a little too far on the sweet side for me. It did had a very interesting juicy flavor to it with some orange juice like qualities, which I liked. It could have used a little more balance for me though. Interesting beer and a decent one to drink this evening, but not quite an outstanding one of the style in my opinion."
"This beer is good people. Much better than the 2007 big foot I had, IMHO."
"4.0 D: Overall a very nice brew. I think this is the base beer for the BBBW (which I absolutely love). Anyway, good throughout with no weaknesses."
"Quite good and only improved by the bourbon barrel aging. Most of the success of Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine starts here."
"Impression: In an era of absolutely killer American Barleywines this one is not top of the pile, but an absolute taste treat in its own right. Wish I could get more of this. Advice? Do what it takes to get this."
"D - Despite the boozy nature, this is a very drinkable brew. I had a bottle in my fridge for quite some time and did not have it labelled, so I don't know what year this was (I have a lot to learn from some of my beer cellaring friends). A VERY solid American Barleywine from Central Waters. A must try if you can get your hands on it!"
"Overall I was impressed. Glad I was able to find it on my trip to Madison this past summer. So far Central Waters has yet to let me down."
"D- This is a complex beer that is best enjoyed sipped. I wish I had one of these for every night of winter. I am assuming that this beer is pretty hot fresh but I won't know until they release it again this year."
"Poured into a snifter. Color is amber with some reddish hues throughout. Slight head and a bit of lacing. Nose is really quite nice with cherries, dark fruits, citrus, plum skin, and some sweet bread. Taste is cherries, sweet malt, hints of booze, and a thy amount of citrus zest. Good feel with excellent drinkability. It's no surprise that BBBW has such a fantastic base."
"The drinkability is a little lower, although it drinks well for 10%, but with some of the sticky syrupy feels, and quite a bit of sweetness take away a bit from it."
"Good solid taste, can really get the barley in there. I didn't really pick up on a lot of different tastes, but a really soild full taste."
"D- easy to finish and im very glad this one found its way into my cooler. something ill try to sniff out up north this winter if i get the chance. this one seems like it would age like the best of them."
"Overall, this is a solid barleywine and worth having, if you can get your hands on it. It is drinkable but the abv is well enough hidden to warrant some caution as it is well balanced and smooth to drink."
"D: Delish. Easy to drink - I probably could drink a few of these which judging by the ABV may not be a good thing.... depending on how you look at it. ha."
"d-friggin great. so happy we stumbled upon this one. i expected much harsher, but it's delic."
"MF/D: smooth with a clean finish for the alc%. very subtle carbonation that leaves a slight warmth in the back of the throat."
"Drinkability is nice. All and all a good barley wine that seems a little harsh at the moment, some time the cellar could really improve this one."
"Poured lovely deep prune and mahogany amber with a nicely retaining animal cracker head. Exceptional clarity and brilliance. I get lots of dark fruits: raisins, currants, and a tiny hint of plum, with a touch of carob and caramel. Very mild earthy hops, barely noticeable. Flavor is very much like the aromas but with a little more caramel sweetness. Spiced rum finish. Nicely carbonated with a rich body. I wish I had more than 1 bottle."
"Drinkability is good with little alcohol evidence"
"D - Once this beer warms the drinkability is quite high for a barleywine. This isn't quite high on my list as the Bourbon Barrel Barleywine, but it's nothing to rag on either. If this had a fuller flavor it would be right there with the BBBW, but as it currently stands, it's another solid offering from Central Waters. Keep releasing barleywines I will be the first one banging down the door to try them."
"Feels smooth, creamy, and it is extremely easy to drink. Properly carbonated. Medium to full bodied. Even though the alcohol is noticeable, it does not hinder the drinkabilityl. Highly recommended."
"Pours a dark red color with a tan head. The aroma is dark fruit, caramel malt, sugar and some alcohol. The flavor is caramel, toffee, brown sugar, alcohol and dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Big flavor to this barleywine, as aggressive, leafy bittering hops grab the front of the tongue and slap it with a syrupy pinyness. The hoppy assault doesn't end there; it merely becomes reinforced by a tangy booze presence mid-palate, as both hops and alcohol battle it out through the finish. Underneath it all, but wholly overshadowed by the pine-booze combo, are subtle, tasty notes of English toffee and caramel malts. Tropical fruit, pine sap, and cough medicine linger into the finish. The mouthfeel is sticky, thick, and on the high end of the carbonation spectrum for the style. All in all, though, this is a great version of an American Barleywine...reminds me a lot of Bigfoot, but with slightly more complexity. Not quite sure where all the ""cellar-aged smoothness"" described on the label is hiding, but I'll forgive Central Waters (this time). Grab a Y2K when you can and give it a try. Highly recommended."
"Good, but some age will make this one much better."
"Perhaps this one should not have sit so long in the bourbon barrels it was aged in."
"The best straight American barleywine I've ever had. I really wish this wasn't my last bottle. It's held up so well and it's going down way too fast."
"Central Waters continues to impress. I haven't had a bad beer from them yet. Honestly, I've been super-impressed with every one I've tried thus far. Kosmyk Charlie's Y2K Catastrophe Ale is a damn good Barleywine. It's very solid in all respects. I'm curious as to what a fresh bottle tastes like. Perhaps the hops would be a little more prominent. This bottle, with a little time behind it, has come together nicely. I've really enjoyed it. Highly recommended if you have the opportunity. Thanks, Alex."
"Reviewed on 8/21/2009. Rating #1400!!! Bottle. Pours a clear dark brown with a small ring of off-white head. Aroma of raisin, sweet caramel malt, sweet prunes. Flavor is quite similar with lots of sweet prune-y malt and raisins. Meh, I'm really not a fan. Just your basic aged barleywine here."
"D- This is definitely a solid, drinkable barleywine. The BA version takes it to another level but I loved this one as well."
"Pours a cloudy deep brown color with a very thin white head that disappears quickly, leaving no lacing behind. Aroma is filled with molasses and brown sugar with citrus notes underneath it. Taste is of toffee, molasses, brown sugar, with slight hop bitterness. Medium bodied with a thick texture and a lingering aftertaste."
"Solid brown with no head and no lacing. Pretty standard for a barleywine. Aroma is super hoppy, a touch of caramel and chocolate, booze, and light oxidation.Taste is loaded weith bitter citric and piney hops, balanced by a huge caramel and toffee sweetness. Maple and brown sugar comes out as it warms. Sticky, viscous and sweet, but there's a light chalkiness on the finish that turns it slightly dry. This is very similar to fresh Bigfoot. Extremely warming on the way down. Wow, I'm really glad I have one more bottle of this to see how it ages. I would love to do a side by side with the NG Iced Barleywine a year or two from now for a good ol' Wisconsin taste-off!"
"D: A awfully malty and sweet date like brew that I would imagine would mellow with age."
"D: A nice, inviting, warming sipper."
"tres anos, 2008 as of 12/2011: lots of ruby around the sides of the deeply brown liquid; deep dark dates in the nose, syrupy and mollasseslike (flavorwise) in the mouth with lots of smashed scorched raisins. herbal/grassy/metallic bitterness underneath. some tannic (?) astringency in the finish. assuming the 08 and 11 are similar fresh, i might actually prefer this fresh over 3 yrs aged. but it has not been ruined by the years and so apparently stores well, at least."
"D - Definitely a sipper of a beer. Strong, malty sweetness and high alcohol keep this from going down too quickly. Excellent for cold winter nights in front of the fire (or snowy October nights, as the case would be today)...good barleywine overall."
"This beer pours a dark mahogany color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly leaving sticky lacing along the side of the glass. The aroma is of burnt caramel, caramel, toffee, and hints of chocolate. Nice complexity. The taste is like the aroma. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a really good beer. It is listed here as being an American Barleywine, but I think it drinks much more like an English Barleywine. Either way it drinks great."
"Pours deep copper with light tan head. Nice aroma with tasty wood and bourbon notes that don't really over shadow the fruity esters and faint maltiness. The alcohol heat does build up and singe the nose a bit. The taste starts with mildly sweet maltiness and roasty malts that then becomes wood and barrel like flavors before a formidable vanilla flavor takes hold. There's also dark fruity esters of grapes, cherries and prunes before the alcohol hotness builds to a distracting level. It could use more age. Darn tasty now though."
"Central waters blows this one out of the water. This is amazing second only to their Bourbon barrel barleywine. Nice work"
"Poured a deep amber color with good carbonation and a tannish head. Nose is lighter with lots of sugar, moalsses and fruits. Taste is very syrupy and malty, chewy which is good, very good. This is a serious bwine indeed. Dried fruits, caramel, molasses, brown sugar. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, warming and hearty with lots of sweetness. Drinkability is good."
"Overall: Decent drinkability for the ABV and style. Really sweet and has a lot of oaky flavors and smell."
"Drinkability: I perhaps did the BBW and the Y2K in the wrong order. Or perhaps I should have done them side by side. Or, something. My point is that I would have enjoyed to compare these two beyond a comparison of my reviews. This beer is a solid, drinkable barleywine, with a complex, surprisingly well-balanced flavor profile, reasonably well-hidden alcohol, and a mouthfeel to die for. That one was, well, all that, plus some, I suppose. Both are amazing beers, and I'd be lucky to cellar either for a substantial period of time."
"D: Not super drinkable due to the bite from the malt and slight alcohol flavor - they can be a little fatiguing over time. However, the flavor is pretty good so that keeps the score higher."
"Central Waters has one heck of a keeper of a Barleywine that really seems more like an Ole Ale of the aged J.W. Lee's Harvest Ale kind of thing. Remarkably yummy stuff!"
"Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights, about a finger of head that recedes but doesn't disappear. Smells is dark fruits, like sticking a plum up your nostril. Floral hops and sweet candy help make for a true sensory experience. The taste almost has a chocolate undertone, although it is really tough to distinguish flavors when you have as many things going on as this one does. Caramel, rock candy, hops, milk chocolate, marshmallows, pure vanilla extract, oak. This is a great beer for sure. Medium to full bodied and extremely smooth and creamy, definitely a sipper but it sure is a delightful one!"
"Taste is more sherry like aged qualities and some more dark fruit. I'm really digging this aged barleywine. Very smooth with light carbonation in the mouthfeel. I'm not a huge barleywine fine, but this is just the way I like them. Very good. I have one more in the cellar, but I don't think this one needs to much more time."
"Pours a rusty cedar with a silky tan head and nice lacing. Nose has floral hops, figs, cherries, caramel, and toffee. Taste has vanilla, dark candy, ripe pitted fruits and rich creamy malt. Full body is well carbonated. An excellent Barleywine from Central Waters."
"D: Barleywines come and go with me: sometimes I think they're amazing, other times I find them a chore to finish. This one was a pleasure, with a smoothness/mellowness that I sometimes can't find in the style. Good aroma and flavor, too; I'd have it again and wouldn't mind putting one or two in the cellar either [hint, hint]."
" Deep orange in color....white lace rims my glass...great nose....mainly darkfruits and licorice on the aroma....nice tasting Barley Wine..VERY easy drinking...body is really more medium than heavy...hops fit perfectly...not super hopped up, but fit in well...taste features the dark fruits....also some sweeter nutty characteristics (almonds?)..a real nice BW..wouldn't call it an all-time great but on the upper level...this may be one of the most underrated breweries in the country...I can't remember having anything other than good beer from them.."
"Despite abv, this drinks very well. Nice fruity/slightly piney touch, along with the caramel/toffee, that lingers. A very enjoyable, solidly American, Barleywine."
"D: Well, not too high in general, but for a barley wine it's pretty darn good."
"Pretty good version of an American Barleywine, since I usually don't care much for the huge hops in them. This one is a bit more complex though, with lots of deep malt flavors. If it wasn't so bitter it would be even better."
"Overall I would say this is a pretty good barley wine, lots of great flavors and an awesome aroma. Again if it was slightly less sweet I would like it a little better but still a great beer."
"Drinkability? For a 10% abv beer, it's pretty darned good. Must be because it is so damn tasty, eh? Well done, Central Waters!"
"Considering the weight this is very drinkable, could have another if available. I will be seeking this out again in WI, hope more is out there."
"d: One of the best b-wines I've tried in a while, stellar stuff. My first from Central Waters."
"D: Surprising considering the abv. Heather thought there was excellent balance between the sweet and spicy. I agree, hands down!"
"Pours out a wonderful reddish brown with nice tan head that stays around for awhile. Smells of sweet caramel, alcohol, wood, and vanilla. Very nice aroma with a lot of sweet malty notes bouncing around. Taste is delicious, nice sweet caramel malts blending into a vanilla almost dessert wine quality. Some alcohol warming, but very smooth overall. A nice bitterness helps round out the sweet syrupy texture of the brew. Light carbonation anda lighter mouthfeel help to make it more drinkable. Well balanced, very drinkable barleywine I'll always like this one."
"Worth seeking out - the base beer for the Bourbon Barrel Barleywine stands up quite well on its own."
"Central Waters has quickly become Wisconsin's best micro-brewery."
"Ovr: I'm not a huge Barlywine fan, but this is pobably the bet I've had. It was just perfectly in balance, nothing getting out of whack. The hops just encroaching on too much, and then fading, the malt laying down a nice backbone. Really great beer."
"A very nicely done BW, great balance. Not too hoppy not too sweet, hoppiness is middle of the road as far as BW's go. Once in a while brew, outstanding flavors will destroy your palate, ina good way."
"Pours a hazy dark orange, reddish brown, got some sludge from the bottle, thin off white head forms a thin ring around the glass, a few lace spots, good retention as the ring sticks around. Smell is neat, rich and powerful, toffee, buttery oak, raisins, sugary, toast, floral hops, light fruit, vanilla, pineapple/mango like tropical fruit, very fresh smelling. Taste is similar, toffee, raisins/fig, apples, light roast and nuttiness, floral, grapefruit, astringent woody bitterness with vanilla, pretty neat, very rich and flavourful, orange peel in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, alcohol is pretty well hidden, definitely drinkable. A nice barleywine, good character and a smooth drinker. Thanks to Russ for sharing!"
"drinkability is good. pretty well balanced and tasty. feels a little rough around the edges and a bit ""muddy"". seems like with a little time in the cellar this one would be pretty awesome. i'm already a huge fan of their bourbon barrel barleywine, and i think with time this could approach the same level. still, it's pretty nice even now."
"D - This is a very good barleywine. It had some nice complex flavors."
"Notes from: 8/20/07"
"D: very nice barleywine. strong, powerful, and full of flavor. not a beer for the faint-hearted at all. this could have solved any Y2K problem."
"D: The barleywine is big, so big that more than one bottle could be dangerous. I have one bottle left that I'm saving for a horizontal tasting with the barrel-aged version."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for it's weight."
"A well-crafted barleywine, a little helpful cellaring by Derek. Good barleywine aroma. Ruby with lace. The taste is dry and woody, particularly so in the finish. A touch of bourbon, a touch of chocolate. Does not seem like 10%. Satisfying above-average barlywine.Nice balance."
"Thanks to kkulacki for bringing this back from Wisconsin for me. Cherry puree red color, with just a thin ring around the side of the glass. Glistens in the light. Smells very fruity...cherries, raspberries, prunes, truffles, caramel, wine-like alcohol. Taste is similar to the aroma: kind of a strong pruney malt, with dry alcohol, biting bitterness, and a hint of cherries. Hops are strong, so I expect that this is not a super-old bottle. Portlike consistency, full bodied. Overall, it's a tasty barleywine, if a little one-sided on the bitterness. I think this is really one that would mellow with age and be very tasty."
"I have no idea what year this is.. but my guess would be '07... Thankful to BA's like Daniel ... even here in Boise... we get the hookup on some cool Wisconsin stuff occasionally."
"Pours a clear deep copper with a minimal off-white head that dissipated quickly to nothing and leaves little lacing. Smell is sweet and dominated by toffee, raisins, and figs. The alcohol burn is evident in the nose as well. The taste is very complex with the aforementioned tofee and dark fruits, but with additional vanilla and caramel sweetness along with a heavy roasted malt flavor as well. The mouthfeel is dry but super malty and alcoholic. The alcohol and malt heaviness take away from the drinkability a bit but this is a very good barleywine."
"Not sure how old this is, but I don't find the alcohol to be overpowering, I think it melds pretty well."
"Drinkability: Not as graceful as some of the finer examples of the style, but overall it's not a bad lil' barleywine."
"Pours orange/amber red with a slight 1/8 inch head and below average lacing. Lightly carbonated. Fairly strong bitter malt smell. A very bold malt flavor that is smooth and balanced. This is very good and it hides the 10% ABV extremely well. This is worth buying. Very enjoyable!"
"Central Waters Kosmyk Charlie's Y2K Catastrophe Ale is anything but a catastrophe (much like Y2K itself). Don't let my impatience to drink it dissuade you from buying it. Just don't make the mistake of drinking it before it's ready."
"It pours a very clear deep amber color with very little head. My first impression was that this barleywine leans more toward the sweet side than the hoppy side, but there is some bitterness in there, and it's not extremely malty like a Thomas Hardy or JW Lees Harvest. Hmmm, maybe this BW is in the middle? I often prefer hoppy BW's, but I thoroughly enjoy an expertly-brewed malty version as well. Whatever the case, hats off to Central Waters with the Y2K! This is a superb brew. The aroma of caramelized tropical fruits is incredible! The taste further supports the aroma. I'm not getting a big hop aroma, flavor, or a strong bitterness. Instead, the wonderful, clean, sweet, fruity, aroma/flavor is king here with just enough bitterness to balance things out. This is certainly a ""sipper"" that just gets better and better as it warms."
"Poured into a tulip a cool looking golden cherry amber color, very nice carbonation, nice creamy one-finger off-white head, some nice little islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, cherry, plums, figs, and some caramel. The taste is slighlty sweet, malty, very nice tones of cherries/plums/figs, with some nice caramel. Medium body, a complex brew. This one goes down pretty smooth/easy. The alcohol is hidden very well, be careful, lol Very drinkable, another tasty brew from CW. Thanks Daniel."
"Excellent beer overall...everything I like about American Barleywines. Reminds me a whole lot of a 2006 Double Bastard I had about a month ago. I'm really looking forward to trying the bourbon barrel aged version now."
"this is not a session beer for me. I will have it again, but probably not until I age it for a year or so. As is, I would have to say the drinkability is pretty low for me. Very raw in its present state. a bit thin for my tastes, but perhaps with time, the true flavor will shine through."
"Pretty clear, deep reddish amber colour. A hard pour produced a thin skim of fine beige bubbles plus a solid collar - it looked fairly viscous too. Bubbles were a bit sticky, producing some spotty lacing. Fruity citrus hops and caramel meld well in the aroma. Notes of toffee and cotton candy, maybe a bit buttery. Solid bitterness that turns a bit resinous and lingers in the finish. As it warmed, this became more of a light herbal hop bitterness. Heavy malt body and flavour, plenty of caramel, some toffee sweetness, a bit of burnt character in the background. Dried fruits and raisins add complexity, brown sugar, fruity hops. Carbonation was on the light side, texture was good, just short of sticky with very mild warmth. Good stuff."
"One tries to sip this tasty treat, but you'll find yourself picking up the glass at a quick pace."
"Very smooth and easy to drink -- a dangerous combination at this strength!"
"I could see Y2k being a better place with a case or 2 of this in the cellar."
" ~ This is a sipping beer, for sure. I'm glad I bought four of these so that I can store them for future indulgence. I will recommend my friends give Kosmyk Charlie a try but I won't be sharing mine. Sorry guys."
"D - Very drinkable and the 10% abv is well hidden."
"D- awesome"
"Appearance is a bright ruby red with a tightly packed head that sticks around forever. Aroma is very stick-sweet hoppiness, with some citrus notes. Taste is alcohol astringency with a lot of alcohol up-front. I could feel its warming effect with my first sip."
"Cheers."
"Inital toffee caramel sweetness, that segues into seriously bitter hops. Dryness rides out into a long finish. More herbal than pine, juicy, not too fruity though. Some peaty smoke and toasted malt comes out in the aftertaste. Mild astringency for such a huge behemoth of a Barleywine. It doesn't become cloying, but it does deserve to be sipped very slowly. One and done, a nice nightcap."
"This is a very good barley wine. It lacks some of the overpowering meatiness of some, which is not always a good thing, but in this case it makes the beer a good alternative when you're not in the mood to be overpowered. The color is an attractive cherry-ish red, and the aroma has some nice orange peel to it, over a layer of maltiness. The first impression is of fruity, yeasty flavors, but a good solid one-two punch of malt and hops quickly follows. At the very end there's a faint but unmistakable reprise of the orange peel. Very nice."
"Perfect dark ruby color, the ideal color for BW. Intricate nose of pancake batter and butterscotch, icing covered fruit cake and notes of caramel, raisins and fig. Flavor is a bit raw and grainy in the backround, mildly unrefined, but there are some seriously impressive and delicious characteristics to this barley wine. Its actually very complex. Hints of vanilla, graham, caramel, toffee, malt induced fruits, along with a very subtle, but present hop character of pine and fruits. Pure, natural body, with excellent creamy/heaviness. Wow, what a beer! Much better than the bourbon barrel aged version, this is a beer worthy of collecting"
"I'm pretty sure this beer isn't retired, but anyways. It's a very mellow barleywine, more English in inspiration, but there's a American kick to the hops. The grassy, spicy hops actually are almost an aftertaste, but still standout from the hops. The malt are slight with a vanilla-oak taste, not much fruit. Worth a try."
"Very nice, but powerful brew that is perhaps slightly overcharged on the alcohol taste, but still very worthwhile."
"Pours medium to dark copper with a good sized cream head that slowly recedes. Big malted milk sweetness m ixes with some nice raisin and prune aromas. There is also a little salt and leathery aroma, alcohol is also evident in the aroma. Taste is big and sweet maltedness, pruniness comes thru mid taste with some berry flavor mixing with the sweet malts before giving into an alcohol warmth in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, very rich and sugary, the finish balances with a nice dryness. A malt-bomb for sure, doppelbock-like qualities in the strength of the maltiness are well balanced by the slight dryness and alcohol warmth. Thanks Daniel for the opportunity."
"A very hoppy barleywine - or is it a DIPA? I've had sweeter DIPAs. A debate for another day. I really enjoyed it and am starting to wait for Central Waters to open in MD."
"D- I'm surprised this beer is this old, the alcohol dominates the malt flavors. The alcohol is not really fusel but it is pretty bitey."
"Pours a giant head, I didn't ever think a barleywine would give such a giant head, it almost overflowed! There's a good strong lacing to it as well. The color is a deep dark brown with a slightly reddish hue. The smell is very barleywine-like if you understand this at all. It's a bit sweet, it has a hop presence, and some dark fruit smells. The taste is very hoppy and has a dark fruit taste. It is a full bodied barleywine with a hoppy dark fruit taste, it's pretty good. The mouthfeel is nice, nothing bad to say there. Overall I think I would enjoy this once in a while and cellared for a bit too."
"4.5's are given not only because it is good, but because it is very interesting for a barleywine."
"Id like to try this one again after a few years in the cellar."
"2006. Slightly hazy. Deep auburn headed towards chestnut color. Huge rocky head of light tan. Excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is malty. Very sweetly caramelish. Toffeeish... do I detect some mild buttery diacetyl under there? Nice. There's a touch of yeasty mineralish character as well. Citrusy hops come through once the head subsides a little bit. In the mouth it's full bodied with an initial zestiness on the tongue. Once warm, however, it becomes more dextrinous and creamy. The flavor is aggressive. Lots of hops and bitterness atop the sweet caramel malt base. Citrusy and piney. Sweet malt combines and softens the citrus. There's some orange, grapefruit, and pineapple. The bitterness is dense, and cuts through the sweet malt with a piney-hop chainsaw before it even gets mid-palate. Rough edges, but cooling, and refreshing. It finishes mainly dry, and piney, with a cooling, minty edge - although there is still a thin strand of sticky caramel left behind. A caramel-coated pinecone! In conclusion... some like it rough! And if that's the case this one's a rarin' ta go! - and I mean that in a good way. I can only assume that that's the way this was intended to be. Soft, sweet caramel and then BAM!!! piney-juicy PUNCH! Nice!!! But for those who like it a bit more rounded you'll need a year or two in the cellar on this one. I enjoyed it, sip by sip, with my feet propped in front of the fire... ah, err, space heater ;)"
"single smuggled back from Mad Town"
"Pours a nice amber red color with a fizzy off-white colored head leaving trace amount of lacing. Smells of caramel, dark fruits, cherries, strawberries, and hint of vanilla. Taste is much of the same, complex and sweet, but not cloying. A hint of hops is detected as well as a small amount of alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel would be perfect, it's full bodied and smooth, but there is just way too much carbonation. Drinkability suffers from the carbonation levels as well; otherwise this would be a damn near perfect beer to me."
"drinkability: bitter and hoppy but enjoyable"
" Go on home your mama's calling you"
"Picked up a bottle of this in Madison, today, on my way to MN. Is this really leftover from 2000??? If so, then this is 6+ years old. Let's see about that. Pours a ruddy amber with a darker center. Finger of dense, clingy, off-cream head soon recedes to a film with minor lacing. Rich malts of toffee and butterscotch mix with rum and bourbon. Candied fruits and herbal hops round out the nose. Scorched caramel and toasted bitterness flavors lead off. Herbal bitterness follows. Rich, sweetish malts mid-palate come in and make this beer great. Bread pudding, butterscotch, candied fruits, and oak. Herbal bitterness closes the door, but the finish shows glimmers of butterscotch, madeira, and vanilla. Medium-full body with a tingly, yet creamy feel. If this is from 2000 then it has aged very well. Smooth and incredibly balanced. Should have bought more I guess!"
"A Bighuge thanks to cokes for landing this Muskie for me."
"It's a rather bold, gutsy brew that asserts from the start. While not especially unique, it does establish some measure of identity. The balance wavers slightly at times, but it never truly tilts. The alcohol carries a serious stature, and that ABV has some effect in keeping consumption limited. Still, it's worth trying if it's in the house, and it won't likely be a disappointment."
"Open this on a special occasion, or save it for your bomb shelter for future terrorist alerts. :) A good brew overall, but sip it lethargically and make it last, you won't find this around too much, and it's a very good barleywine. Compared to other Central Waters brews, this is near the top of my list."
"Cheers to cokes for the brew!"
"This is another barley wine I didn't like very much. I'm just not a fan of the style. Pours a rose amber with small head, fruity and citrus aroma. It starts out thick and malty, but has a big hop finish. I thought I'd enjoy barley wine if I found one with enough bitterness, but I still don't like the style. I'm having a hard time picking out what it is I don't like about this beer. It had good hops, the alcohol was masked fairly well, and it should have been aged enough by now. Something about the wine character of the taste doesn't agree with me."
"Overall, a nice barleywine.  Quite good, but nothing extraordinary in the catagory. Give it a shot if you are a fan of the brewery or the band (as I obviously am on both counts)."
