I agree with other posters here that there are better barley wines out there but this is a great brand to use as the "standard" representative of the style. There will likely be better brands and there will likely be worst brands depending on your taste but the OHB is a great, balanced, everyday barley wine suitable for most palettes. An extremely enjoyable beer!","BarleyBeatsGrapes","Jan 22, 2014"

4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in late 2012. Pours lightly hazy red-orange color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, floral, pine, light nuttiness, and toasted/floral earthiness; with some light spicy alcohol. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, hop, and fruity notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, floral, pine, nuttiness, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, pine, raisin, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt, hop, and fruit flavors; with an excellent bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barelywine. All around great balance and complexity of malt, hop, and fruity notes; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 07, 2013"

Deep doughy/biscuity sweetness then the hop makes itself known in the nose...very much the "olde Englishe" style 'wine. The taste is long and complex, more biscuity notes and hefty sweetness here, hops are an afterthought yet noticeably felt on the tongue, not very much alcohol detected given its heft. Finishes long and warming, nice interplay of hop and malt, malt winning out. Very nice authentic English style. I see a malt bomb here with cellaring. Good job Blue Point!","beerluvr","Jan 28, 2013"

The taste seems a bit organic and grassy moving into thick chewy malt sweetness, pine hop bitterness, a touch of pine hop flavor and grapefruit.

First experience was from a small keg the folks brought to Holiday Valley Beer & Wine festival in Ellicottville, NY a couple of years ago. IMO it stoled the show. Judging by the looks of the waxing over the cap and dried lines of the product all over the top of the bottle I'd assume that there were some bottling challenges. This one pours clear and a light shade of amber color with a wispy thin white head that's gone in a flash. Not a lot of lacing going on. Quite a bit of light colored sediment settled on the bottom of the bottle. I like the smell but its a little off. You get some of the 10% ABV right off the bat, but it also has a rich sweet caramel malty character as well. There is an unlikely corn starch piece also. This one seems under carbonated and lighter in the mouth than you might think from the nose. There is quite a bit of whiskey in the flavor that over powers the caramel taste some.

Aroma is syrupy sweet, with whiffs of alcohol. Flavor starts with the sweet maltiness, then it gets kind of ugly. A flash of bitter hoppiness turns into some sort of long-lasting plastic-y bitterness that just won't go away, coupled with substantial alcohol burn. The alcohol part wouldn't be such a problem if the plasticness didn't make me think of solvent-welding. (Sorry, got all chemical eng for a minute.)

4.1,6.5,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"On tap at the Pizza Plant on Transit,so I asked the bartender the style of this beer he says well its categorized as a barley wine but he thinks its a beefed up rauchbier so Isaid "hmm" a knowledgable barkeep kinda hard to come by.Poured into the goblet a slight hazed light amber with a thinner white head,cherry wood aromas big on the smoke with some dark fruit as well.Now this beer has a big smokey,woody profile like the before mentioned soaked cherry wood with some brown sugar and raisin quality in the finish.This beer is unique to say the least if you like smokey,woody flavors this is for you Iam glad I tried it it is very unique in my opinion.","oberon","Dec 27, 2005"

3.93,2.1,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"I shared a 2003 edition after Christmas dinner with my bro and cousin, as we did several other good beers. This beer poured a nice honey bright color with a thick head and little carbonation. You can pick up some nice fruit notes in the smell of the Bastard. The taste is nice and hoppy and spicy but definitely paletable. It was a nice beer to have at Christmas time with the warming sensation of the nigh alcohol content. A bit pricey where I got it (Happy Deli in NYC at $25 a bottle but I was willing to spend it because I can't really get it in PA). I felt somewhat better when I went into the Happy Deli 3 weeks after buying my bottle and the price was up to $30! Didn't realize beer inflation was higher than other goods and services...","ggaughan","Dec 05, 2005"

3.67,-4.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Damn wax covered bottle (silly with the bottle cap) broke as I was trying to get the wax off.. Bad start. Deep copper to amber color with a thin off-white head. The nose is very fruity. Mild citrus (tangerine) with sherry, vanilla and caramel notes. Weird flavor, almost smoky. There is little of the citrus in the taste. The vanilla an sherry notes are compounded. It doesnt say on the bottle, but Im guessing this has been on oak for a few months. It softens the hops, but the oak and smoke doesnt blend well with this beer. It does have a nice soft mouth feel, and the oak really tames the alcohol, but it just seems a little off.","carln26","0"

4.46,15.8,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"On tap and cask at Mugs in NY! (Schweet!) Very dark and clear amber rubied, but you can see through it. This bit of lovliness came to me served in an English pint, what a way to start out our pubhopping! Huge khaki creamy frothy head sitting over a half inch high. Smooth and silky, just glides over your tongue. Sweet and orangey, deeply malty, caramel sweetness, nice hoppiness. Not too strong heavy, or intense at all, one of my buds said it seemed like a triple IPA.	Really enjoyed this one, was glad to have stumbled onto it after wondering about the $17 bottle I just passed over about a half hour before hitting this.","shapudding","Feb 01, 2005"

3.98,3.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Apparently a filtered beer, the Old Howling Bastard pours a crystal-clear orange-ish amber body with a crimson cast beneath a full head of frothy off-white lace that holds quite well and leaves some very nice spider-web-like lacing about the glass. The nose is more intriguing than captivating, with a hint of apricot amidst a mildly sweet and toasty grainy maltiness amidst some medicinal and subtly smoky notes notes that are oddly compelling (think Islay whiskey... in fact, I wonder if there's some peat smoked malt in there?). Across the tongue and down the throat, the bastard seems more like a tame old kitty cat: slick and smooth and ready for a nap! - It's only lightly creamy, but its full body is pillowy smooth. Aggressive in it's flavor, a blend of bready and subtly crusty bread (with a touch of apricot marmalade drawn across the top) is all but overshadowed by its smokiness, bold bitterness, clearly noticeable alcohol, and leafy and fruity hop flavor (there's some pineapple and perhaps watermelon - I wonder if they're using some nugget hops). There's alot in there, and yet it all kind-of blends together; and the hops and bitterness eventually overwhelm the maltiness almost altogether. It finishes dry, wiped-down with alcohol, and somewhat astringent with rogue smokiness, some leafy & citrusy hop flavor, and some delicate malt that sticks in the mouth. Within a few sips it starts to build upon the palate, greatly reducing its drinkability, and numbing the tastebuds. Still, its lingering character (not unlike its nose) can be intriguing. The bottle states that the vintage is 2003, and that it's good in 2004, better in 2005, and "awesome" in 2006... ... ... I guess I should have waited a year! - or two even!","NeroFiddled","Nov 01, 2004"
2.72,-29.4,5,3,2,3,3,"This is the only Barley wine I have every tried, and chances are it will be the last. Some people love this stuff, not me, not my taste buds. It is a good novelty item, with a good story behind the name, but... just not up mmy alley. The bottle and art work are great. I would suggest only trying this as a novelty or if you REALLY love the taste of Barley","Biggness","Feb 15, 2004"
3.1,-19.5,3,3,3,4,3,"Amber body with off-white head. Intense aroma of malty sweet flavors that are not too well blended (honey, maple). Sweet smokey and light hops are hidden behind the massive malty alcohol. Very sweet palate, alcoholic and moderately astringent. Poorly balanced. A smooth medium body keeps it from being a waste. A poormans barleywine... that is very expensive..","Rastacouere","Nov 18, 2003"
3.87,0.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"on CASK at the G man in NYC. Dark brown with a fluffy white head, nice roasted malt, hoppy and yeasty nose. Bready, whole wheat malt notes, alcohol fairly prominant , medium bodied, very smooth mouth feel, hops a bit muted, could use some more IBUs to balance things out. ( I tried this one AFTER the Arrogant bastard, so it might have been a tough act to follow) The cask pour seemed somewhat "mushy" in the overall balance of this brew.","Billolick","Nov 29, 2002"
4.02,4.4,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"[Sampled from a growler filled up from a firkin] Malty nose, little head which doesn't last too long. Big malty flavour and alcohol warmth; malt lingers in the aftertaste, some hops are there too. Very smooth and quite an 'easy drinker'. Quite rich, but not as much as other barleywines (not necessarily a bad thing).","Imbiber","Beers"
4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I decided to try this very appealing ale- how could one not given its name? Nice copper hazy color with a white laced head. It had a nice aroma, sort of caramel and flowery bitterness. Not overpowering in smell or in taste- although it was quite tasty. A smooth but bitter kick at first and then it mellows out - a little cookie or biscut like. Very enjoyable and rich although not heavy. A perfect beer to sit by the fire after dinner. Alcohol is noticeable, but as it warms more of the ale- like flavors settle and the hoppiness relaxes as well. As with other BA's who reiewed this beer, my only knock it that it is very overpriced. I paid $16 for 750 ml.- not worth that much even if it is this good.","AaronRed","0"
