"This was more interesting than good, honestly, but always cool to try an 11 year old beer."
"An unimpressive barleywine. Didn't even bother finishing the bottle."

"I found this beer to be overly sour and musty. Like old fruit and old socks sour and musty. Complex, but most of the flavors were not good. Color and head were good, but the smell matched the taste."
""
""
"overall: Decent enough."

"First off, I like barley wines. I've had a few different brands and I overall like the style. Old Howling Bastard (""OHB"") is an excellent representative of the style. I agree with other posters here that there are better barley wines out there but this is a great brand to use as the ""standard"" representative of the style. There will likely be better brands and there will likely be worst brands depending on your taste but the OHB is a great, balanced, everyday barley wine suitable for most palettes. An extremely enjoyable beer!"
"O- A good barleywine. it has been awhile since I have had a barleywine and this one I would have again. The caramel really sells me on this beer."
""
""
""
"I would buy this again and wonder how different it was fresh?"
""
""
""
"So now, after about a dozen or so barley wines, I have find another one that I have liked. Thats two for me!"

"O - This was a rather impressive non-BA barleywine that has a great balance between sweet, malty flavors and the fresh hoppiness found in some barleywine. This is definitely one of the better hoppy barleywines that I've had."
"overall this is a pretty nice barleywine.. nothing out of the ordinary, but it's one of the better local ones i've had. definitely one of the better blue point beers as well."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in late 2012. Pours lightly hazy red-orange color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, biscuit, raisin, floral, pine, light nuttiness, and toasted/floral earthiness; with some light spicy alcohol. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt, hop, and fruity notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, floral, pine, nuttiness, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, pine, raisin, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of malt, hop, and fruit flavors; with an excellent bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barelywine. All around great balance and complexity of malt, hop, and fruity notes; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall it's a good beer, much better than their oatmeal stout I had last night. It's easy to drink and goes down smoothly."

"O - Not too bad. Worth a try for sure. Tame for a barleywine, so it would be a good beginner brew."
"This beer is a chestnut colored liquid with a very slim head. Mostly still and very clear. The aroma is of malt and some booze. The taste is warming, sweet, and had a firm mid taste of bitter hops. Resiny hop flavor through the finish. Sweet. Full in body. A good, but not great, barley wine."

"Nice eggshell white head melts into hazy deep copper liquid contained in the appropriate 0.3l Victory snifter. Deep doughy/biscuity sweetness then the hop makes itself known in the nose...very much the ""olde Englishe"" style 'wine. The taste is long and complex, more biscuity notes and hefty sweetness here, hops are an afterthought yet noticeably felt on the tongue, not very much alcohol detected given its heft. Finishes long and warming, nice interplay of hop and malt, malt winning out. Very nice authentic English style. I see a malt bomb here with cellaring. Good job Blue Point!"

"O: A decent hoppy barleywine, but it's getting a bit of a stale feel to it from the oxidation creeping in."
""
"Very nice Barleywine. Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a snifter. Hazy reddish-brown with a nice finger of pale white head. Aroma about ad good as it gets. Fresh- baked bread with a hi t of sweetness and alcohol on the nose. Fairly similar in terms of taste. A little thick but deliciously good. Not THE best Barleywine style ale I've had, but pretty high on the list!"
""
"The taste is very nice and i was surprised by how delicious the beer was. it is not my favorite barleywine, but it is certainly an upper tier barleywine. A very nice bread character from the Vienna malt and a nice hop presence. The booze is not overwhelming and overall i find this to be a stellar barleywine."
""
""
"O - Pretty good barleywine..."
""
"O: This is a good well balanced beer. It is a good representation of a not to sweet not to toasted malty barleywine. If you avoid barleywines for the sticky sweetness then you owe it to yourself to have a go with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not too bad by any means. Pretty solid for the style for sure."
"overall - a tasty barleywine, dead on."
""
"This is a decent barleywine, though a bit thin. It has a nice hop character which helps to counter the sweet sugar. A fuller body would help this tremendously, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"After the beer rested there was a taste of fruitiness coming through."

"O: great local product, right there with other good American barleywines"
"stopped by the brewery to grab some swag and scope out old howling bastard on cask and was pretty surprised that I have no review on this one asi had it many times. brew showed up a deep amber brown with a thin creamy head. has a wonderful caramel nose and taste. the body is super creamy as I would expect on cask. cask really works for this beer. there is a subtle bitterness to the finish that is just right. one of my fav barleys and fav local beers on cask, gotta love it! what a treat!"
"Overall: a fairly drinkable barleywine with a complex flavor and the right degree of booze."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing objectionable here, but the oxidation and lack of hop character makes me wonder how long the keg had been around (it kicked at the end of my pour). Recommended to try, but doesn't begin to compare to the best in class."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer... Smells sweet caramel notes hops are present... Great ruby color nice thick tan head, creamy... Tastes sweet pretty standard barely wine very boozy alcohol is def present in this 10 percenter Slightly above average barely wine for me not one I'd run back to get but would def pick up if I couldn't find one of my favs on hand."
""
""
"Picked up a bottle and poured into a glass. Pours deep ruby/copper with a thick, cream-colored head. Aroma of strong caramel and cereal and a lot of hops. Flavor about the same, a little sweet. Smooth texture. Not bad, but nothing really sticks out and the alcohol isn’t hidden well."
""
"D: This was more like a double IPA than a barleywine, but it had a nice enough scent and taste. The body was only ok, and the finish could have been smoother, so it wasn't super easy to drink. But it was still pretty good. Age would definitely change the brew, although I can't definitely say it would improve."
"Beer is thin and sweet with a lot of fruitiness, berry flavors in the beer, it is a little hot, finish was a little dry. I don't think I'd have it again but it is a fine barleywine."
""
""
""
"With 12 years of age on it, the Old Howling Bastard has evolved into an extremely complex animal. Its complexity combines fruits, hops, and sweet candied malts into one highly tantalizing body. A fantastic representation of the style that is not overly sweet or boozy, but rather highly balanced and robust."
""
""
"Overall: A respectable middle of the road barley wine."
""
"Taste is not too shabby really...the caramel and toffe are very prominent. So is the alcohol...its a big beer. Not too sweet and has plenty of bittering hops on the end to clean things up nicely. Mouthfeel is solid, not too thin nor is it syrupy. Well carbonated, its one of those beers where the mouthfeel is never mentioned because it is just nice and flys under the radar. This is a pretty good beer, I like it. Id be more than happy to buy this one again."
"A good sipper, Old Howling Bastard requires a commitment, but is worth the effort. Find a fire in a dark room and settle in for a long while to savor."
"Overall: A good barleywine. Sweet but balanced thanks to the hops. My kind of barleywine."
"It's not bad, but it comes nowhere close to many I've had in the style. It doesn't taste bad, but it lacks the complexity that really defines the style for me."
""
"O: A big, brash, hopped-out and boozy American barleywine, this brew could stand a couple years to mellow. At 10% ABV, its an attainable feat, but may not even be worth it, depending how the craft holds up. I like Blue Point, but wouldn't put it past them to just have created a big, bold, sorta one-dimensional barleywine like Old Howling Bastard."
"Overall: My second favorite Bluepoint beer. No it's not a bad thing...I can drink this all day! Pretty good stuff and honestly if you haven't had it...have it!. Cheers to all."
""
""
"Medium bodied with mediumish carbonation, it has a good mouthfeel and the 10%abv is well hidden. A very nice brew indeed."
"O - A solid barley wine that I suspect would be even better with some age on the bottle."
""
""
""
""
"O - It was just ok to me. Ive had a lot of Blue Point beers and I love the brewery but this one just didnt hit the mark for me. Its a decent barleywine but I feel it needed more weight to truly elevate itself."
"O- Damn near perfect! The bottle cap says 10th anniversary '99-'09, so I'm wondering if this had been sitting around for a couple of years developing into this... I've always loved this once a year brew... but this one, tonight... DAMN!!!"
"VERY GOOD, SEEK IT OUT!"
"This is a good beer and that's really where it sits. Nothing stands out obviously bad about it but there's nothing that really sets it apart either."
"A ruddy brownish color, small head forms and dissipates. Hoppy citrus aroma, bright hop notes, honey, sugary malts. In the flavor profile, oily, piney, resinous hops and barleywine like flavor from the malt. Toffee, sugary malt, solid hop bitterness throughout. A big beer, but achieves balance. Small alcohol presence for such a big beer. Overall, if you like a good hoppy barleywine, this could be for you."
"This beer was pretty impressive I thought. This poured out as a nice dark clear looking brown color. The head was large at first but settled pretty quick. The smell of the beer didn't remind me too much of a typical barely wine, it was a little fruity on the nose. The taste was a little boozy but very warming. The flavors of some dark fruits some sugary notes really shine in this beer. The mouthfeel is a little thick and smooth. Overall I enjoy this Barley Wine quite a bit and would enjoy having it again one day."
"O: After a few of these you just might find yourself howling ala the name. Decent example but ill stop there, appears easy at first but doesn’t go down without a fight."
"Really beautiful looking barleywine. Dark copper/reddish hues. Massive cream colored head, nice lacing. Smells delightful- dried fruits, figs, and sugars. Taste was not overly sweet/cloying. Nice hop presence and well balanced with the malts. Candied sugars, prune...great flavors....excellent brew right here. I will seek this out again and pick some up to age."
"O: This beer is good! Honestly this is one of the best, most well balanced barley wines I've ever had with some interesting flavors mixed in. I think this beer needs more respect. I really enjoyed this and appreciated the combination of great brewery execution and bolder, more creative flavors."
"Poured an orangey-brown with a cream head. Thin film and a thick collar is left behind, looks quite nice. Nose is caramel and toffee, some orange and interesting but not off-putting underripe banana notes. Taste has alot of citrus (lemon and orange come to mind intitially), caramel, alcohol, and finishes with a significant hop bitternss. Medium mouthfeel, and a bit of a higher carbonation that feels a bit amplified in the finish. Sticky, boozy and bitter. Enjoyable."
"Deep copper orange colour, white head, no lacing. Malt and caramel, alcohol is present but not overbearing, light hops deep down. Taste is malty, caramel, under rip banana, moderately hoppy, some alcohol comes through. Good feel, full body, quite nice, med-light carbonation. Quite nice, quite enjoyed this brew."
"O: A decent beer I probably won't buy again, but maybe a bottle to age a bit and try again."
"Overall: I think I would prefer a fresher bottle. Seems like there is something not quite right with this bottle what with the tanginess. It doesn't seemed to have improved with age."
"Overall, an average beer that I'm still glad I tried."
"Cheers!"
"O: The beer is quite drinkable considering its strength because the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"Overall - Nothing bad, just nothing of note. Indistinguishable malt flavors and some hop bitterness. I really didn't have any trouble finish both of my snifters, though."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, dark fruit and small oak hints. In the taste, dark fruits and hints of licorice. Smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry dark fruit aftertaste. Not boozy, nice small oak, decent."
"A bit creamy on the mouth. Really not a bad beer in anyway, but I'd prefer a bit of hops somewhere in this rather strong and rich flavor profile."
"O- Overall, I think this is a pretty solid barleywine. It has a very nice balance of rich malty sweetness and bitterness from the hops. "
"D - The booze and bitterness slow you down a bit."
"D- this is one drinkable barleywine. You can barely taste the alcohol with each sip. Although it's very sweet, Old Howling Bastard is a drinkable beer!"
"Overall: Awesome beer. I would recommend this to any beer drinker."
"Big thanks, as always, to the great MCLK. Thanks a ton Mark, I am so glad you moved down here. Bottle pours copper with light haze with gold hues and light tan head. The aroma has smooth dark to musty fruit notes and seem to bleed into a rye like spiciness, hops spiciness, full thick malty sweetness and a bit of heat at the end of the draw. The taste seems a bit organic and grassy moving into thick chewy malt sweetness, pine hop bitterness, a touch of pine hop flavor and grapefruit. It gets smooth and a bit grainy into the finish setting up a very pleasing finish. It leaves pine hops and fading yet faint sludgy sweet malts deep into the after taste."
"Nice beer, a good ending to our Super Bowl meal."
"220z bomber: This one pours hazy, orangish-amber color. There was very little of a just slightly tan head on it. It left a little lacing. The aroma is nice. Definitely a lot of malts, but some fruit notes popping up, mainly apricots and orange. Some earthy notes also. The taste is also good. There is a dryness and very subdued sweetness to this one. Some caramel, toffee, plus faint plums and raisins. Alcohol is not evident in the flavor profile. I bought this for the name, but will buy it again for the taste."
" Old Howling Bastard may be the result but Seductive Pirate Wench or Viking Thunder Goddess seem like more appropriate titles. I that some have aged this 2 years or more but at about the one year anniversary I find it to be just about perfect. I like my barleywine punchy though."
"All in all, this is a good brew. Definitely not anywhere near the best barleywine I've ever had, but a solid one. Definitely good to try if you like the style. If you don't like barleywines, then you probably won't like this."
"D: Good"
"Overall this beer was drinkable and even somewhat interesting, but not really noteworthy."
"It's cold outside and this beer is just about perfect for the occasion. It's very drinkable for a barleywine."
"Drinkability is affected by the alcohol presence. A slow sipper, I split the bottle and half is just about right!!! I usually don't age barleywines but this one would probably be totally awesome with the alcohol tamed"
"The beer pours a deep red/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, caramel scent that indicative a slow sipper beer. It's not especially hoppy or complex, but's it's solid and well done; mostly caramelized pale malts. The taste is good as well. It has a dry, malty flavor that's slow going down, yet quite enjoyable and delicious. Again, not especially hoppy, but well brewed and malt forward. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good barleywine. It's smooth and easy drinking; an excellent winter warmer."
"Drinkabilty- this beer isnt hard to drink at all though you can certainly notice the kick of heat at the end, its an okay beer but not one I would buy again because for me to sit and drink a 10 percent beer it better have a decent complexity, just kind of a bland blah run of the mill barley wine, dont want to beat it up to bad cuz its not offensive but just another let down from a brewery thats never done much to this point to impress me"
"Drinks fairly easy, I would love to try some fresher for comparison purposes"
"D- really just ok for me. Probably won't revisit this one."
"Drinkability is low for a regular beer yet high for a barleywine, as this is a slow sipper and but not one to drink all night. Tasty, but one to drink with caution as the ABV will creep up on you. It went great with the lamb stew that I had for dinner, complimenting it like a wine."
"D: This is a rough beer, there is booze, sharp hops, and astringency."
"d - An ok barleywine. Smelled very good, but the booze came out a little too much in the taste. Also a bit too carbonated. Probably wouldn't get again."
"10oz serving at The Devil's Den off the tap. Old Howling Bastard has a light golden with amber spots in the color and the white foam reached an inch with some froth and a bubbly look. Not much lace. In the nose I sensed a strong Amber Ale. A note of caramel malt and some light fruit such as apples, a bit of alcohol too. Overall not that interesting. Tastes include sweet malt, caramel, earthy hops, and some alcohol. Not that much going on. Feel is nearing full bodied and the carb is very low. Im glad I tried this off the tap before grabbing a big bottle. It's pretty tame for a American Barleywine."
"Average-plus drinkability, and overall a solid barleywine, if nothing to write home to yo' mama about."
"It's caramel driven but not overly sweet."
"D - This is a pretty hoppy American Barleywine which may make you think of Double IPA's, but the line is thin there anyway. The malt backbone is there giving a sufficiently full malty anchor. This is very tasty I would recommend this and I would like to see what is like in the bottle after a short aging"
"This is a fruity BW. If you're looking for a fruity BW that is high in abv that is not raw, and you don't mind the bit of thinness of the body, certainly grab this one. My gut instinct on aging this? Would doubt it...but, just a guess.. Anyway, might not fit style guidelines the way it should, but I would say this is an interesting BW that should be checked out."
"d: Not bad, but not what I was hoping for. Needed to be more balanced I think."
"The feel of this beer is light, it has been waiting to jump onto my taste buds and pops a bit right at the end. A reall wonderful beer."
"Had this again on 9/15. A little better this time. I would recommend it on a cold winter day."
"A very underwhelming barleywine. I can't see any reason to get this over the many amazing American barleywines available today. All that said, it's not a terrible beer. The musty, leathery note with the roasted malt that emerges at first is quite good, and the mild sweetness that the beer ends on is bland for a barleywine, but has more character than a lot of other beers. Also, while this definitely doesn't stand up to just being sipped and savored, it went rather well with the garlic pizza I ended up pairing it with. I wouldn't refuse this beer, but I wouldn't seek it out either."
"D: Very good barleywine - the sugar makes it all worthwhile."
"D: Pretty drinkable, this was an interesting take on the style."
"Even mouthfeel, a tad slick, tingly carbonation finish, slight warming of the cheeks. Tasty beer, could use a bit more complexity."
"D: really wonderful, but strong. Great drinkability for what it is but would be limited due to ABV and sweetness. Really a sipper though, even 12oz was tough by end."
"This review is for a 2003 bottle consumed late this summer at a tasting. Poured a light amber with almost no head. The aroma is exhibits a beer that still has quite a bit of punch and with some classic sweet barley wine notes. No oxidation. The taste is similar, but does show some light oxidized notes of sherry and band-aid. There is also a bit of woodiness, but overall still quite drinkable and fairly pleasant. A bit past its prime, but amazingly still a huge beer."
"[Sampled at the 2009 Flower City Brewers' Fest at Frontier Field, Rochester, NY]"
"drinkability - Nice sipper here. Enjoyed this beer. Has some kick at 10%."
"D: Tasty goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it might not be the best barleywine that I've had, but it's a nice stronger beer that is good to sip on for a long time."
"D - a sipper to be sure. a well aged bottle which I'm quite happy to have enjoyed!!!"
"Overall I liked this offering from Blue Point and wouldn't hesitate going after it again. If you like barley wine, try this one."
"Overall a complex and user friendly barleywine."
"5/4/4/2/10 (2.5/5)"
"Notes from 12/12/05"
"D: It's not overly enticing, but its easily approachable."
"D: Had a pint of this over two glasses. Went down nicely. Really nice beer. I have been enjoying their cask offerings as of late."
"Drinkability: A fine, respectable barleywine, at least at five years out."
"Tasted this on tap, and served in a goblet. It has an unexpected strong aroma of pineapple, and even tastes slightly like the fruit, sweet and syrupy. Mouthfeel was fine. Fruity flavor helped cut the strong alcohol taste, and made this very drinkable."
"This is a full-bodied, smooth tasty that does cloy as the tasting goes on. That does not hamper the drinkability though, as barley wines can be lovely. This beer is a total winter sipper, but for me, always enjoyable."
"A very different barley wine. Very smokey in the middle and finish with a meaty appetite. Earthy and a bit of alcohol spice. Toffee and caramel with some fig, date, prune, oxidtaion, brown sugar and peach hiding behind the smokey flavors. A bitter finish on the piney side. A good odd barley wine."
"750ML Capped Bottle. Pours a light golden color with some reddish highlights. The head was almost non-existant and settled into a light ring around the glass. The aroma is of aged grassy hops and a noticable alcohol aroma. A nice big hoppy blast kicks things off. The hops seem to be aged and have grassy, woody and citrus characteristics. Not a very strong malt presence and there is a noticable alcohol flavor. The feel is light with rather soft carbonation, finishes sweet and slick with some alcohol burn. A hoppy brew with plenty of alcohol presence. A decent drinker."
"This is one of those barleywines that grab you by the palate and won't let you go. It's intensely sweet, a touch bitter, and very alcoholic. It's incredibly thick and a definite sipper. Overall this is a real bully of a beer, but it's right on target if that's what you're looking for."
"Vintage 2003. Hand labeled 225. Rates a 5.0 on the label art scale. First experience was from a small keg the folks brought to Holiday Valley Beer & Wine festival in Ellicottville, NY a couple of years ago. IMO it stoled the show. Judging by the looks of the waxing over the cap and dried lines of the product all over the top of the bottle I'd assume that there were some bottling challenges. This one pours clear and a light shade of amber color with a wispy thin white head that's gone in a flash. Not a lot of lacing going on. Quite a bit of light colored sediment settled on the bottom of the bottle. I like the smell but its a little off. You get some of the 10% ABV right off the bat, but it also has a rich sweet caramel malty character as well. There is an unlikely corn starch piece also. This one seems under carbonated and lighter in the mouth than you might think from the nose. There is quite a bit of whiskey in the flavor that over powers the caramel taste some. Definitely a sipper. I'm glad that they bottle some. Neat idea. I remember enjoying the cask more."
"D - good drinkability, sweetness and abv keep this at a '4'."
"This is a decent barleywine, but I have to say I've had many better."
"A very respectable barley wine. Perhaps not worth the $16.99 I paid for it, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"The alcohol made its presence known, but was more warming then anything. Combined with the weighed down feel & consistancy of the beer, ten ounces was more then enough for me to enjoy."
" All in all a nice barley wine that deserves some attention"
"First off, this beer is NOT retired, and it never was...Anyway, poured a redish amber color, small but thick off-white head. Wonderful lacing and decent retention. Aromas of fruit, hops, alcohol tinged sweetness, and caramel. Taste hits you up-front with a sweet alcohol quality, sharp hops, smoked wood, caramel and fruit. Delightfully complex and surprisingly smooth. A great barelywine, Blue Point seems to have refined this brew a lot over the years. Definitely recommended."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" beige head over the very cloudy orangey amber brew. Head is quickly down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with minimal lacing. Aroma is syrupy sweet, with whiffs of alcohol. Flavor starts with the sweet maltiness, then it gets kind of ugly. A flash of bitter hoppiness turns into some sort of long-lasting plastic-y bitterness that just won't go away, coupled with substantial alcohol burn. The alcohol part wouldn't be such a problem if the plasticness didn't make me think of solvent-welding. (Sorry, got all chemical eng for a minute.) Mouthfeel and drinkability suffer from the same fate. Don't know if the wax was part of the culprit, or what, but I'm not very excited about finishing the bottle. Maybe it'll grow on me."
"Very well received..."
"I paired this up with Cracker Barrel extra sharp white cheese and it worked incredible with this brew. A solid barleywine overall. Very nice to sip and quite mellow after sitting for three years. Maybe a tad overpriced at $17, but I enjoyed it just the same. If you have the chance, check this out. Hats off to Blue Point brewery for making this caliber style of beer."
"Well this was interesting. Looks a dark red with a shot head. Smells a little smokey and sweet. My first taste sure surprised me. I was expecting American Barley Wine and my first flavor was smoked cheddar. Ah yes, its a smoked barley wine. Recommend for fans of smoked beer and BAs looking for something a little different."
"On tap at the Pizza Plant on Transit,so I asked the bartender the style of this beer he says well its categorized as a barley wine but he thinks its a beefed up rauchbier so Isaid ""hmm"" a knowledgable barkeep kinda hard to come by.Poured into the goblet a slight hazed light amber with a thinner white head,cherry wood aromas big on the smoke with some dark fruit as well.Now this beer has a big smokey,woody profile like the before mentioned soaked cherry wood with some brown sugar and raisin quality in the finish.This beer is unique to say the least if you like smokey,woody flavors this is for you Iam glad I tried it it is very unique in my opinion."
"Note : this beer is listed as retired but I picked up this growler at the brewery just three weeks ago."
"I shared a 2003 edition after Christmas dinner with my bro and cousin, as we did several other good beers. This beer poured a nice honey bright color with a thick head and little carbonation. You can pick up some nice fruit notes in the smell of the Bastard. The taste is nice and hoppy and spicy but definitely paletable. It was a nice beer to have at Christmas time with the warming sensation of the nigh alcohol content. A bit pricey where I got it (Happy Deli in NYC at $25 a bottle but I was willing to spend it because I can't really get it in PA). I felt somewhat better when I went into the Happy Deli 3 weeks after buying my bottle and the price was up to $30! Didn't realize beer inflation was higher than other goods and services..."
"Beer is good. Happy smokey beering."
"Damn wax covered bottle (silly with the bottle cap) broke as I was trying to get the wax off.. Bad start. Deep copper to amber color with a thin off-white head. The nose is very fruity. Mild citrus (tangerine) with sherry, vanilla and caramel notes. Weird flavor, almost smoky. There is little of the citrus in the taste. The vanilla an sherry notes are compounded. It doesnt say on the bottle, but Im guessing this has been on oak for a few months. It softens the hops, but the oak and smoke doesnt blend well with this beer. It does have a nice soft mouth feel, and the oak really tames the alcohol, but it just seems a little off."
"immediate above may be something else and I will over those words over and the 3.7 when I verify."
"On tap and cask at Mugs in NY! (Schweet!) Very dark and clear amber rubied, but you can see through it. This bit of lovliness came to me served in an English pint, what a way to start out our pubhopping! Huge khaki creamy frothy head sitting over a half inch high. Smooth and silky, just glides over your tongue. Sweet and orangey, deeply malty, caramel sweetness, nice hoppiness. Not too strong heavy, or intense at all, one of my buds said it seemed like a triple IPA.	Really enjoyed this one, was glad to have stumbled onto it after wondering about the $17 bottle I just passed over about a half hour before hitting this."
"So far, one of my best barley wine experiences."
"Apparently a filtered beer, the Old Howling Bastard pours a crystal-clear orange-ish amber body with a crimson cast beneath a full head of frothy off-white lace that holds quite well and leaves some very nice spider-web-like lacing about the glass. The nose is more intriguing than captivating, with a hint of apricot amidst a mildly sweet and toasty grainy maltiness amidst some medicinal and subtly smoky notes notes that are oddly compelling (think Islay whiskey... in fact, I wonder if there's some peat smoked malt in there?). Across the tongue and down the throat, the bastard seems more like a tame old kitty cat: slick and smooth and ready for a nap! - It's only lightly creamy, but its full body is pillowy smooth. Aggressive in it's flavor, a blend of bready and subtly crusty bread (with a touch of apricot marmalade drawn across the top) is all but overshadowed by its smokiness, bold bitterness, clearly noticeable alcohol, and leafy and fruity hop flavor (there's some pineapple and perhaps watermelon - I wonder if they're using some nugget hops). There's alot in there, and yet it all kind-of blends together; and the hops and bitterness eventually overwhelm the maltiness almost altogether. It finishes dry, wiped-down with alcohol, and somewhat astringent with rogue smokiness, some leafy & citrusy hop flavor, and some delicate malt that sticks in the mouth. Within a few sips it starts to build upon the palate, greatly reducing its drinkability, and numbing the tastebuds. Still, its lingering character (not unlike its nose) can be intriguing. The bottle states that the vintage is 2003, and that it's good in 2004, better in 2005, and ""awesome"" in 2006... ... ... I guess I should have waited a year! - or two even!"
"This is the only Barley wine I have every tried, and chances are it will be the last. Some people love this stuff, not me, not my taste buds. It is a good novelty item, with a good story behind the name, but... just not up mmy alley. The bottle and art work are great. I would suggest only trying this as a novelty or if you REALLY love the taste of Barley"
"Amber body with off-white head. Intense aroma of malty sweet flavors that are not too well blended (honey, maple). Sweet smokey and light hops are hidden behind the massive malty alcohol. Very sweet palate, alcoholic and moderately astringent. Poorly balanced. A smooth medium body keeps it from being a waste. A poormans barleywine... that is very expensive.."
"on CASK at the G man in NYC. Dark brown with a fluffy white head, nice roasted malt, hoppy and yeasty nose. Bready, whole wheat malt notes, alcohol fairly prominant , medium bodied, very smooth mouth feel, hops a bit muted, could use some more IBUs to balance things out. ( I tried this one AFTER the Arrogant bastard, so it might have been a tough act to follow) The cask pour seemed somewhat ""mushy"" in the overall balance of this brew."
"[Sampled from a growler filled up from a firkin] Malty nose, little head which doesn't last too long. Big malty flavour and alcohol warmth; malt lingers in the aftertaste, some hops are there too. Very smooth and quite an 'easy drinker'. Quite rich, but not as much as other barleywines (not necessarily a bad thing)."
"I decided to try this very appealing ale- how could one not given its name? Nice copper hazy color with a white laced head. It had a nice aroma, sort of caramel and flowery bitterness. Not overpowering in smell or in taste- although it was quite tasty. A smooth but bitter kick at first and then it mellows out - a little cookie or biscut like. Very enjoyable and rich although not heavy. A perfect beer to sit by the fire after dinner. Alcohol is noticeable, but as it warms more of the ale- like flavors settle and the hoppiness relaxes as well. As with other BA's who reiewed this beer, my only knock it that it is very overpriced. I paid $16 for 750 ml.- not worth that much even if it is this good."
