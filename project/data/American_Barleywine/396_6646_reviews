"O: Overall sweet, syrupy, sticky with warming citrus-alcohol notes. Strong visual and aroma, solid flavor and a great sipper ovet the long haul that reveals layers of spectrum over warming."
""
"Not sure why anyone would sleep on Ale Smith. But don't if you do . . . This is a delicious barleywine. Toffee, caramel and other subtle sweet flavors come together to make this more than another enjoyable sipper."

"Excellent barley wine. Very drinkable"

"Hot as hell and sweet as pie makes for very fine drinking."

"Overall: A pretty good barleywine, though it probably isn't something I would hunt for"

"8 months old bottle. Beautiful clear copper colour. Caramel, hazelnuts and a bit of peppery hops on the nose, same flavours, but surprisingly bitter finish. No alcohol in smell and taste. Love it, one of the best beers I've tasted."

"Flavor is a bit lackluster. Sweet, with a big bitterness at the finish."

"great barleywine. still ranks up there as one of the best"

"The flavors are strong and diverse with mostly malty tastes. I get chocolate and caramel malt but not the sweet variety. I also get fig and dark fruit, molasses, brown sugar, maple, tea leaf, barley and grainy malt. It's a bit thin but the 11% is completely hidden."
""
""
""
""
"O - I find this to be on the bitter side and also to have an excessive aged sherry character, but it is still complex and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Two year aged Old Numbskull is tasty for sure but I recall fresh being a touch better for its more vibrant hop character. Time trades the fresher hops and hotter booze for smooth edges, fuller feel and more sweetness. All in all you can't go wrong either way. This is an excellent American barleywine."
"Overall - It's hoppy, which I know everyone doesn't love, but this is very nice."

"Overall. Big. Boozey."

"O - A solid American Barleywine.  Alesmith hasn't disappointed me yet, so I didn't expect that they would here.  Will get another bottle and cellar it for a little longer next time.  Prost!"

"Overall: I can honestly say this beer is one of the best American Barleywine beers I have had. I actually had one of my favorite a few hours earlier but this just tops it by a few notches. I have seen and hesitated in buying this and finally bit the bullet because I have been impressed with other Alesmith beers, this one hit nail in the coffin, Kevin approved! Salud."

"Nice mahogany brown color with excellent clarity. There's a quarter inch head of light brown foam on top. Brussels lacing. Strangely on this barleywine I smell more of a piney hop aroma than malt. The taste has a strong pine hop edge but there's plenty of malt to back it up. Plenty of interplay between hops and malt going on. The mouth is somewhat sticky,but the drink ability for this barleywine is quite amazing. I notice hop aroma fades as it sits for awhile."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a very easy beer to get down, despite the style and ABV. I enjoyed every sip of this, not much not to like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an incredible deep amber with a tan head, color is remarkable on this. Aroma is deep roasted barley, grapes, alcohol, with heavy bready nuttiness. Taste follows the aroma well, with some residual sweetness and a tinge of hop charecter as well. This is one of the best looking beers I've ever seen, and The flavor is tops in this style."

"O - different and delicious barley wine. For such a heavy beer, it managed to be pretty refreshing. Glad to try it. It's awesome see this brewery available in IL!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Expected it to be a lot sluttier, but everything stays in good taste. Mostly amber malt and barrel driven, but the hop character is very welcome and lifts this one to a superb level."
""
""
""
"Overall, excellent. It has a lot going on, and does a good job balancing and not making anything overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - More of a triple IPA than a barely wine. It needs quite a bit more malt to be the balanced barely wine I was expecting. This is my first Alesmith ale. Maybe they are all on the hoppy side..."
""
""
""
"Overall great and one of the top end Barleywines I've ever had"
""

""
""
""
""

"O: Good drinkability. AleSmith quality. One of the best Barleywines I've ever had. Very tasty but not extremely sweet. Molasses but balanced. Recommended"
"750ml bottle: Didn’t realize I had this for so long. 2003 bottle drank in Feb 2014. This one pours a dark caramel color. There was about no head on mine, nor was there any lacing. The aroma is very nice. Faint citrus hops, along with some caramel malts. No sweetness to speak of. Possible some honey and raisins in there, as well as some toffee and biscuit. The taste is excellent. A slight sweetness, as well as a definite silky texture. Some caramel, raisin, toffee. There is a lot going on here. Actually a faint dryness to the finish. A wonderful offering."
"Overall: Good Barley wine, a little too sweet fresh, might be a little smoother with some age. Not a whole lot to the beer that makes it stand out but it is a very nice drinkable beer. $15 for 750ml bottle"

"a very american barleywine ale, as determined by its aggressive piney hop profile that is just as prevalent in nose and taste as the malt here, which is what english barleywines usually showcase. more of a balanced offering, but a massive one. beautiful red copper glow to this, high gravity for sure, under a khaki head an inch tall and thick as tar. lots of hops on the nose, bitter, which counters the sweetness of the grain well, and it transitions right into the flavor. but grain bill no doubt, caramel sweetness and a dried fruit complex, but the hops wake you right up and this finishes real hoppy and bitter. like all the foiled alesmith brews, the alcohol is brilliantly well disguised and this drinks far lighter than it really is. a scary bottle to finish alone, but i would be happy to try. nice example of the highly hopped american barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great (I'd say American-style) barleywine."
"Overall: Tasty stuff, but straddles the line between BW and DIPA. Even hoppy BW's like Bigfoot have substantial malt flavors when young, this one leans even harder on the hops. Not a big deal as I like both styles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another excellent beer from a brewery I truly admire and whose beers all seem to kick some ass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But one must admit the name has been well chosen: the Numbskull...after purchasing it I feel exactly like one - a stupid person, that's it."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall a very well made barleywine and one I would definately buy again as a splurge."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Finally getting around to reviewing ON. This is very good, despite my not being a huge fan of the style in general. The draft is excellent, and I think better than out of the bottle (freshness may play a role in this)."

"Overall - A fairly good barleywine, though mostly forgettable. While it's drinkability is there, it fails to capture the spirit of uniqueness and/or tenacity of your outstanding Barleywine. In the end it comes across as good, but unremarkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is good stuff, and can easily sneak up you. Recommended!"
"O: I was quite surprised by this beer, I've been wanting to finally try a solid and this one has done it for me, this beer is extremely well rounded and almost executed perfectly, almost gave up on this style of beer, but this one will keep me trying more of this style, well done Alesmith!"

"Full bodied, chewy, smooth, and easy to drink. Has modest carbonation. One of the best Barleywines I have had in a long time."
""
""
""
"O - Decent, but might need a little more time for it to peak."
"Overall: A really great take on the American Barley wine style. Big upfront earthy hop presence with a good balance of bready caramel malt."
""
"T: Floral hops and pine held up by a big toasted bread malt backbone. Orange zest, toffee, and some sticky floral hop resin. Totally unlike any other barleywine I've had. And I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty characteristic hoppy American barleywine, perhaps a bit heavier on the bitterness than most, but tasty nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a bright, muddled, opaque, chestnut-brown coloring with a dense, creamy, off-white head that sits low and slowly settles into a sparse, filmy surface coating. Aromas of cedar, peat, cracker and biscuit, toffee, apple, pear, and an overall fruitcake character. Smells balanced, but rich and imposing at the same time. Flavors of toffee and roast on the forward tongue, with hints of chocolate to follow. Apple pie, with all the spices, some subtle tropical fruit notes, and a light caramel highlight. Earthy notes pop in and out on the taste buds, helping to keep everything in some semblance of balance. Very balanced on a mid-bodied feel, which pulls off a lightening effect on the heavy, robust palate. The aftertaste is roasted sweetness, with a blending of all the rich, sugary sweetness together with all of the fruit characteristics, and also the first real hints of booze. A fruity sweet linger at the end, both tangy and slightly cloying, into a slick, slightly bitter, lingering finish. Tasty brew, and I bet it ages nicely."

"overall: I thought a year back would do more for this guy. Interesting and complex. Alcohol well hidden. If you dig American Barleys that are hopped up more than most Dipa's you'll probably dig this. Personally I prefer my Barley's more malt centric."

"Overall, a pretty good beer. Not sure if this would have been better fresh or not (never really intended to age it so long), but I would be up for trying a newer vintage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not too sure what to think about this beer. It has a very interesting flavor profile and the finish is wonderful. I think this would pair well with a variety of heavy meals. This, however, is not my go-to AleSmith. Definitely worth a try, though. And I would definitely want to age this."

"750 ml bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but was purchased in late 2011. Pours hazy deep ruby red color with a small dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Light soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, apple, orange zest, floral, brown sugar, pine, molasses, toast, orange rind, brown bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity/earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, orange zest, apple, toast, floral, pine, orange rind, brown sugar, brown bread, chocolate, light roast, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, orange zest, orange rind, light fruits, toast, light chocolate, brown bread, brown sugar, floral, pine, light roast, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of deep malt and hop flavors; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance, and hardly any cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied with a creamy, slick, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic well aged barleywine. Fantastic complexity and balance of deep malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"750mL bottle. Pours a dark brown murky swamp water color with lots of sediment floating around and an inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is boozey with sweet caramel and bread. Some citrus and spicy hop notes. The taste is the nice alcohol burn with some orange peel and caramel. Some breadiness and piney hops. Warming alcohol at the finish. Pretty well balanced. Creamy mouthfeel with a good deal of carbonation. Overall, this is a well crafted Barleywine. I hope I can grab a bottle to age."
""
""
""
"This is pretty damn unique. I'd be interested to see how the barrel aged version compares."

""
""
""
""
""

""
"Bottom Line: Good!"
""
""
""
""

"Old Numbskull is definitely a sipping beer with strong flavors. Bitterness is assertive and it warms well, probably best with a meal. I’ll finish this bottle with dinner tomorrow."
""
""
""
"This beer reminds me a lot of an IPA. It starts out a bit sweet, but the hops kick in so fast, the sweetness is quickly overwhelmed. I think cutting back on the hops a bit would provide a better balance. If you like a hoppy beer, give this one a try. I am not a big fan of a lot of hops, but if you are, worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a feel like i caught this beer at a strange time. It seems like it is inbetween trying to be hoppy and trying to be malty. I would definitely like to give it a try again though to get a better idea of where the sweet spot is."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a really good beer. A great interpretation of a hoppy barelywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a massive beer, the flavours are very complex and its one of the few beers that you can smell from the glass when its on the table in fri=ont of you. Highly recommended."
"Overall a good representation of the style, though it could have a little more hop balance."
""
""
"This was well worth the wait. It's listed as American but it has an English influence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid barleywine all around. Alesmith continues to impress me. I will seek this one out again including other offerings from this great brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this barleywine, and will be aiming to pick some more up so I can age it to perfection."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a solid effort - nothing particularly noteworthy other than the heightened yeast flavor and the moderate depth and intensity of the caramel flavors"
""
"I've got to cellar this one"
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty excellent barleywine. I'd like to have a real fresh one to compare."
""
""
"Deep maple, quite clear, with a nice frothy off-white head. Touch of orange peel, brown sugar, and pine. Pretty nicely done. The mid palate is exploding with flavors of citrus, pine, malt, maybe even a tiny hint of cocoa. Finishes strong and alcoholic, with hints of sweetness, biscuit, grapes, and citrus. However, a touch boozy at this point in time. Very full, thick, and chewy body and fairly brisk carbonation. This beer has much potential to age."
""
""
""
"750 bottle that has been sitting for 2 months, maybe slightly longer. Pours a beautiful deep red-orange, clear, with big creamy head that has an orange/beige hue. Smells like serious pine and toffee. Was surprised at the hop presence in the aroma here. Nice toffee flavor, with a hit of hop on the tongue. Bit of grapefruit and slight booze, but hides the abv awfully well. This is a bit too easy to drink, and definitely the most balanced of the style that I have ever encountered. Very nice."
""
" ~ This is a great example of a barleywine. It aged well and I wish I had another bottle available."
""
"A really nice Barleywine. Sure, it's not barrel aged but it works well and is well crafted."
"O: A solid Barleywine with good complexity and excellent feel. AleSmith produces well crafted brews and never seems to disappoint."
""
"A big beer, but still very enjoyable. Tons of malt, and balanced with big resiny and piny flavors as well. Really well done. Highly recommended."
""
"O: This beer has nicely mellowed over the year and could be a little dangerous for as smooth as it is. The alcohol warmth is there but one could easily sip themselves into a stopper if the was served in a pint glass."
""

"Purchased this and Avery Brewing Company's Hog Heaven for a beer club barleywine tasting last night. This was a very good barleywine, better than most of the competition. It was rich and dark with sweet caramel, molasses and raisin flavors dominating. There was a lot of boozy warmth and very little hop bitterness near the end. Old Numbskull definitely stood out among the crowd as an exceptional barleywine."
""
"This was a fantastic barleywine. The ABV is almost completely hidden. The malt is sweet but not cloying, full flavored, and delicious. There is just enough of a hop bite in the finish to round this one out. This is delicious and dangerously drinkable. I will definitely try to get my hands on this one again."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a solid drink. Not extremely complex as the malt dominated, but it was nicely put together."
""
"Overall this is a super enjoyable barleywine. Nice hop profile, and plenty dark fruit notes. I only wish it was a little less sweet, but it's a small snafu in an otherwise really enjoyable brew. Really nice stuff."
""
""
""
"Overall a real solid barleywine, rich and big and delivering on all fronts simply and nicely."
"O: It's a very good barleywine and it will stimulate me to raid my cellar for some of the other American barleywines I have stashed to compare. A really good fresh barleywine which is not easy to do always. This beer is just missing a little special something to move it into the elite category though. Maybe age would do it -- I doubt I'll ever know as Alesmith is never going to distribute in my neighborhood, but I can always hope and dream though. I bet this is exceptional in its BA form. Another winner from Alesmith."
""
""
""
"Drink- Good barleywine. I liked all the flavors and the balance that this had. Was overly done but still carried a lot of balance to it. Id like to age a bottle. Not sure how to date them though?"
""
""
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation and a decent amount of boozy sweetness that lingers over the strong malt flavors and earthy hops into a warm finish. Dry, earthy hops up front are somewhat stale/faded but the flavor is still there, adding complexity to this intense beer. Earthy and leathery malt compliment the hops befoe being countered by toffee, fig, raisin and caramel sweetness. There's plenty ofvalcohol sweetness and warmth in the finish but it's not overly hot and the high ABV is relatively well masked. Well balanced and complex but definitely a sipper. I'm glad I sat on this one for a while because it's drinking very nicely 3+ years later."
""
""
"Overall, quite an enjoyable barleywine. Not the knockout I was hoping for, but quite yummy."
"O - not worth the 14.99 I paid for it, but a good offering nonetheless. I'd be interested to try this one again for sure. Will compare with Weyerbacher Insanity tomorrow!"
"O: This beer is quite hoppy, quite unlike other beers in the style. I think this would be a barleywine that would be enjoyed by hopheads because it tastes like a hybrid between a barleywine and an imperial IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, nearly opaque honey-amber with flecks of floating vegetable matter and barley malt particles. A huge, fluffy, caramel-colored, orange-hued head forms. In fact, it overflowed my glass and I didn't even pour as aggressively as I normally do. Asymmetrical lacing and clumps of suds stick to the glass. Aromas of toffee, cherry, and sorghum dominate. Citrus and alcohol sensations in the olfactory. It has a thick, smooth mouthfeel. Flavors of ultra sweet brown sugar and sorghum up front. A little citrus tartness on the back of the tongue accentuated by a mild carbonation burn. It has a sugary butterscotch hard candy finish. A good dessert sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I meant to try this beer fresh, but wanted a Barleywine and not a IIPA. I got what I wanted. It's smooth, sweet, boozy (in a good way), and super enjoyable. The barrel-aged version of this beer must really be something. I don't think I'd drink this very often, but I will certainly try to keep 1 or 2 bottles on hand."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the big malt quality through the nose and flavoring. We were actually surprised to find as much hops as we did on the back there, which really added to the final bitterness amongst darker malts and biting booze. While the booze was certainly prominent, it was one of those cases where it added to the flavoring of the beer, rather than drowning out other flavors. This is a standup barleywine."
""
"Overall this is an excellent barleywine, while I'm not normally a fan of really hoppy barley wines this one is so well done that it works well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice dry hoppy american-style barleywine. Not ridiculously sweet like so many high ABV barleywines, thanksfully. A nice departure with the hoppiness too, it adds complexity while maintaining the balance of flavors. Surprisingly drinkable for an 11% brew."
""
""
""
""
"overall - very nice. If I pick up again, I'll let it age more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Old Numbskull is by far the most drinkable barleywines that I have had - I would have had no problem finishing the 750."
""
"O- An awesome barleywine, hops and malt play off each other perfectly, even at 11% ABV I happily finished a 750ml, I would recommend this beer very highly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great beer, and I'm kind of sorry that I sat this long on it, but I have to admit that I tend to lean towards the English barley wines and the balance and I thought it would be a good idea to put it down. I think the next chance I get, I'll pick up 2 and put one down and kill the other quickly and see what the difference may be. Plenty of great smell, plenty of great flavors, and a body that lets you know you're drinking a real beer as opposed to some watered down oat soda."
"O: delicious and incredibly complex and deep, really well balanced, alcohol is definitely present but not in a bad way, it adds to the intensity and makes you realize that it is 11%"
""
""
""
"originally reviewed: 06-07-2011"
"O: It might have been excellent, were it not for the disappointing mouthfeel. A touch of carbonation redeems Numbskull from the tactile dustbin. I would recommend the beer, broadly, though I'd steer you towards the Speedway Stout first. Overall, competent."
"O: Alesmith makes great beer; this reminded me of an American barleywine meets a double IPA meets Stone's Double Bastard: a very complex array of flavors, and a very rewarding drink"
""
"Overall: I think this beer is okay. It sits on the fence between an american barleywine and a DIPA. I think it leans a little bit more toward a DIPA. The whole stale hops taste makes me think that this bottle has sat on the shelf for a long time so take that into consideration when reading this review. But, if this beer was in fact fresh it was a dissapointment. Alesmith...please put a date on your bottles!"
""
"Pours a burnt orange/tawny color with thin cap of off-white froth, good sticky lacing. Scent is of lightly burnt caramel, brown sugar, kiss of orange rind, some dark fruit, dark crusty bread, light hint of pine. Scent components manifest themselves in taste, bready and caramel/brown sugar sweet, orange rind, prune and fig, light char and toast, noticeable alcohol burn, hoppiness at a minimum, light pine. Full side of medium bodied, some heft and slickness, moderate carbonation. A good, solid American Barleywine that straddles the middle and is balanced between hoppy and malty members of the style."
""
""
""
""
"This is a big slow sipper, really nice for a hoppy barleywine."
"Nice full bodied beer here with good carbonation. Leaves a bit of a dry finish. Overall this one is pretty solid. A little bit on the hoppier side than other barely wines I have had but that's not bad at all."
""
""
""
"Good, but doesn't scream ""barleywine"" to me. More of a DIPA."
""
"Overall: I love this. I think it is dangerously drinkable despite the high ABV, and just so easy and nice and complex."
"O- Classy sipping beer for sure. Tasty."
"Keeping another 2010 to go along with my 2011 and will pick up a 2012 as well for a vertical this year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - i had high hopes for this one but they fell flat. literally. alcohol content kicks in after the first glass. that combined with the syrupy mouthfeel makes for pretty low drinkability. i'd like to try another bottle of this or have some on tap for comparison to see if i got a bad bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Rather disappointed by this. Was expecting so much more."
""
"Big thanks goes out ot my doppelganger for sharing this one with me as a pre-game to a tasting! Served from bottle into a Bell's stemmed tulip. Poured reddish brown with a one finger off-white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, citrus, citrus hop, and caramel hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, caramel, caramel hop, dark fruit, and dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. All aspects of this one were very solid. The aroma was quite nice and complex on this one and this complexity carried over to the flavor as well. This fact made it quite drinkable and enjoyable. A definite must try if you have not done so before."
""
"DOA"
""
"O - Layers of complexity run through this bold and somewhat flagrant beer. Deep maltiness provides a base for heavy handed hopping but expresses wonderful sweetness while American hops are bold and brazen. The end result is a fairly balanced, though hop-leaning barleywine that's sure to sneak by you with it's strength."
"This bottle was average, but i seem to remember drinking another bottle or two and liking them a good deal."
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak Tulip. Pours a medium to dark red-mahogany amber. Nice one finger fine light tan head with good retention and lacing. Nice barley wine aroma of caramel malt, vanilla, honey, dark fruit with a hint of oak. Complex flavor of dark and light fruit, caramel malt, hint of citrus. Finishes just slightly dry and oaky. A bit of booziness in the finish. Creamy medium to heavy mouth feel. Very nice and well made. A year old bottle with mostly refrigerator storage. An obvious candidate for further aging."

"Dr: Very drinkable - especially for the high ABV. It'd definitely be better aged, which is a strange thing to say considering how hop-centric it tastes. I don't know that they've fully resolved the battle between malts and hops for control of the focus, but this remains an experimental and bold brew that seems to challenge the conventions of the style."
"O - A lot of flavor and aroma in this beer. Also, the pleasant mouthfeel makes this a really enjoyable beer to drink."
"O Not a bad barleywine but it felt like something was missing. Maybe a fresher bottle is what I'd be interested in but there are some nice flavors."
""
"Overall, a really nice barleywine with a nice hop bite. Really smooth, balanced, and fresh tasting. I would be interested to see how this evolves over time. I would definitely get this again."

"As I mentioned before, I'm no expert when it comes to barleywine but I am thoroughly enjoying this one and much prefer it to Stone's (although that is solid and cheaper)."
"O- I love this brew, it's like hop juice, my favorite barleywine to date."
""
""
"O: Overall, I'm very pleased with my choice here and feel like this is one of the better barley wine beers I've had the pleasure of tasting."

"O: May be the finest barley wine I've had to date. This being my first review should also say something...I felt compelled to write about this beer. Alesmith has made a near perfect blend of creaminess, sweetness, and bitterness that is a wonderfully drinkable high abv beer. The only fault I would say is that its TOO stealthy if that's even a bad thing."
""
"I'll start off by saying this... Jesus H. Christ...where have YOU been all my life??? This is...an incredible...INCREDIBLE beer. Pours a beautiful, hazy, ruby red with a thin, wispy head. The nose is a wonderful blend of vanilla and bourbon. The taste is much the same. This is a masterful flavor profile. So smooth and complex. The mouthfeel is wonderful. It's very soft on the tongue despite the bourbonic finish. Overall, I have a tough time remembering a better $11 spent. I wish to hell I'd have bought a lot more, and will when I see it again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Alesmith really never seems to disappoint. This is just another example of that. Great beer, probably one of my favorite barleywines. Definetely work it."
""
"Final thought - my first time having this beer. Such a nice ale. $10 and 11% abv. San Diego made, you know it's yummy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a mighty tasty beer, alcohol is very well hidden but definitely felt at 11.0 abv. Recommended that you try this and maybe sit on it for awhile to let the alcohol mellow."

"O: I enjoy the flavors. Not quite big enough though. I like my barley wines bigger than this. To be honest I think Alaskan beat this on all marks besides the appearance. This is the clear winner in that category for me."
"o - this is a good american barleywine. it starts hoppy and as it warms turns more syrupy and sweeter. the alcohol stays subdued for most of the glass. i'd be curious to see what some barrel-aging would do to this one."
"Overall, a very well made beer, but nothing special. It's hard to tell if more age would have helped, but the hops are still strong after at least a year."
" Overall a solid barlywine for sure. My first Alesmith brew and it didn't dissapoint."
"Pours a murky dark amber with a 2 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap. Random chunks of lace stick to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and lots of citrus fruits and citrus zest. Taste is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, citrus fruit, citrus juice, and citrus zest. A mild bittersweet flavor lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a medium body and is smooth on the drink down. Overall, this is a very good barleywine with a nice balance between sweet and bitter."
"Old Numbskull is a pretty impressive American Barleywine. This bottle is a little old, although I’m not sure how old. There really isn’t much in the hop department going on at this point. I’d be interested to see if they are more vibrant in a fresh bottle. My only other complaints are the body and the carbonation. More body and bubbles would be good. Really good stuff in any event. Easy recommendation."
"Bomber at Brasserie Beck in DC. The pour is a clearish, deep maroon blood ruby with a thick, dense, yellow head with excellent retention and sheety to wispy, sticky lace. Nose is salty, savory, toffee, white chocolate.Taste up front is saltwater toffee, sharp nutty bitter, walnuts, fresh and not cloying maple, milk chocolate, nougat, baked peaches. Palate is rich, buttery, bitter, dryish, non cloying, non syrupy. So fresh, oily, and quick on the palate. Good mouthfeel overall."
"OVERALL: This is an outstanding example of a Barleywine. The big, complex, hoppy and malty flavors come together and provide a prototypical Barleywine experience."
" this falls in line with what i expect in a barleywine and am sure i will be drinking this one again within the next month."
"Overall a pretty good beer but I found it to be a kittle thin for a barley wine. It could have been thicker and deeper in flavor."
"O - Nice beer, easy drinker, and fairly easy to get messed up on."
"O - A very well brewed barleywine and an incredibly complex sipper."
"Pours a dark amber color that forms a two finger frothy white head. Great lacing left on the sides of the glass and sediment is floating throughout. Smell notes of rich caramel, dark fruits, sweet malt, light hops, and a touch of alcohol. Initial taste was sweet apples with caramel. Also can taste the bitterness from the hops in the backbone. A slight touch of alcohol that warmed the stomach. Great carbonation and nice and crisp finish. Overall this a must try. Glad I had a chance to sip on it and would love to drink more in the future."
"This beer pours a hazy reddish color with 2 fingers of frothy of white head that recedes extremely slowly. the smell is malt s booze and a huge dose of piney hops. the flavor follows suit with a bit of malt sweetness that helps to balance out the bitterness from all the hops and there is a piney spicey hop flavor followed by big booziness. the mouthfeel is well carbed with a medium to full mouth feel and a fairly bitter nifinsh. overall a fairly good american barleywine but could definitely use some age on it."
"With thanks to Mrkennedy and Pours a hazy golden copper hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger creamy head and sporadic lacing,the smell is golden caramel,honey and piney hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of toffee soaked bitterhops,caramel,boiled candy,marzipan and honey,overall its very sessionable for its ABV and i could drink this all night with its ABV very well hidden cheers."
"(D)- A good barleywine. Very straightforward and basic for the style, but its a solid one at that."
"(O) Great barleywine, awesome that I got a chance to try it. Really good stuff."
"Overall a good Barleywine that hits most of the spots. Not amazing, but very good and consistent."
"O: This is almost the hoppiest barleywine I've ever had, behind only avery's hog heaven. What it's missing is some more of that barleywine sweetness, malt and dark fruit backbone. Still, very good."
"Good thing I have another in the cellar. Thanks to 22crowns!"
"o - Overall another great barleywine. Very easy to drink considering the ABV and super smooth, with a lot of nice fruit and caramel in the nose and mouth. Would love to have again."
"I'm personally not a fan of hoppy barleywines but this one is very solid. Definitely worth revisiting in the future to see how an aged bottle tastes and whether the robust malt potential develops any further."
"EDIT: There was no cork underneath the cap. Is this typical?"
"O: Very drinkable. Still it seems perfunctory and doesn't wow me in any way."
"D - Straddles the line between English and American barleywine. Hop bitterness is fairly restrained overall. A very good barleywine, but not one of my favorites."
"Props to 'em for bringing this to the SDIBF '11."
"This beer poured out as a brownish amber color. The head is nice then it settles into a bubbly white film of the beer leaving some decent lacing. The smell is hoppy and malty, but there are way mote hops on the nose for sure. The taste is a little citrusy sweet with a good malty finsh. The hops really kick ass on this brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and yet has a great bitter quality. Overall it's a barley for the head head I think. Pretty Impressive brew it think."
"overall this is a damn fine american barleywine. IMO i'd stop short of calling it truly outstanding, but no question it's flavorful and enjoyable; i would be very open to a revisit."
"Fairly deep bronze color. Decent level of CO2 going on. Buttery, malty aroma. Quite sweet and caramel like. Big malty blast of flavor. Again caramel and buttery sweet. Nice raisen like quality-quite the dried fruit and fig like presence. Long lingering toffeeish flavor. Hint of booze in the finish. Nice mouthfeel-somewhat sticky and sweet. Great US barleywine and a real sipper on a cool spring evening."
"O- It is a really drinkable great beer. The booziness is a little overpowering in the finish but overall it is a really great beer. This beer covers all the bases and I'm certainly glad that I have more in the cellar. I wish I could have tried it fresh as well."
"On a side note, another good beer on tap at Instant Replay, $5 for a goblet of it, pretty great deal."
"Beer begins looking up in flavor, seriously. About damn time. Beer is medium in body, thick on the palate, Mildly bitter at the end but entirely from grains, a late residual sweetness, not my favorite but a decent beer overall. Sucks I'm ending my night with such an unremarkable beer."
"M/D: medium body, medium carbonation. A good representation of the style, nothing outstanding, but very solid barleywine."
"O: This one followed the Mother of All Storms and I must say, it didn't fall flat. This is a quality American Barleywine that I would recommend without hesitation."
"Chestnut in color, with a firm off-white head, this beer is clear and relatively low in carbonation. The aroma is intense with malt...caramel and bread, with a little alcohol and fruit as well. The taste is malty and sweet, with a sharp alcohol bite. The hops are not pronounced in the aroma, but intense hop bitterness comes out in the taste. West coast. The body is a little light for the style, but still sufficiently rich. Nice balance for the style. Lingering hop finish, accented by the warmth. Overall good."
"O - Nice barleywine and one with a pretty big hop presence. One bottle was defnitely enough. I was worried that the sweetness would make this one hard to finish, but I was able to get through it."
"D: With the strength and bottle size, one is plenty. On the other hand, I found it easy to put away the whole bottle. A great barleywine - pick it up if you see it."
"Pours a clear red color with some bubbles on the top. The aroma is strong with apples and bread. The taste has hints of apple, cherry, raisins and caramel. The mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety and finishes with a nice fruity aftertaste. The alcohol is a little present as it goes down your throat. Overall a great barleywine."
"I bought this bottle recently, but it tastes like it already has a bit of age on it. Also, some clear carbonation issues. Hard to put down the whole bottle cause of those flaws."
"D - Overall, imo a very nice barleywine. Rich, creamy, and sweet. Not overly sweet, and would definitely purchase another bottle. At 11% abv no problem drinking the entire bottle. Watchout!"
"Overall, a very good beer but a tough one to have more than one glass. I'd recommend splitting a bottle with friends."
"AleSmith Make some great beers and Old Numbskull is one of them. I would have to say that this beer definitely holds true to the definition of American Barleywines with its strong hop character and fruitiness. I think I want to try and age on of these things to see what kind of flavor changes happen. My local beer store is selling a 750ml or about 25 oz bottle for $10.99 and I recommend you pick one of these up as its good stuff."
"D - An interesting take on the American Barleywine... The appearance and nose are spot on, but from there the drinker is treated to a slight departure from expectations in the other facets... Another excellent job from Alesmith, a brewery that never disappoints..."
"D - DANGER WILL ROBINSON! This bad boy clocks in at 11% abv and hides it VERY well. A bottle is a bit pricey, so this is good for an occasional treat."
"Overall: Another awesome Alesmith beer that I overlook far too often. One of my favorite American Barleywines and really fantastic when fresh."
"I feel it is more balanced like a English Barley Wine without the heaviness."
"This is definitely a sipping beer. It held up well after a couple of years. I'm guessing the alcohol burn has mellowed over time. Tasty and well balanced."
"D - This is a good barleywine. Big and sweet."
"A medium carbonation that is goes good with the hops, makes it even more drinkable. There is not a strong 'heat' character in this beer which made me happy. I am going to track down a fresh bottle and re-review."
"Raisiny alcohol up front with a big malt body - toasty caramel. Surprisingly smooth at 11% and not much hop flavor, but shows a biting, resinous hop bitterness. Shows less oxidation in the taste, it reminds me of a burnt raisin bagel...in a good way. This is an excellent barleywine that gets better the further into the bottle you get. To style, yet different. Smooth, but has enough rough edges to make it a sipper and keep you on edge. I like it, but not sure about the ageability."
"Pours a slightly hazy (almost clear) reddish amber color with a small cream colored head that disappears quickly. Scent is very malty with strong fig aroma. Figs and raisins come through the scent the most, but there are also other dark fruits and toffee in there. I also get raw honey and chocolate. Taste is quite exquisite. Very well balanced with the hops, malt, and dark fruits. This one has been aged over a year, so I'm sure it's more hoppy when fresh, but this just tastes great. I get vanilla, toffee, and honey too. The alcohol is definitely there, but balance almost perfectly throughout all the flavors. Fantastic barley wine style ale. Mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied without being too syrupy. Drinkability is fairly high. This is a very rich beer, almost like a dessert... but it doesn't bring down the drinkability very much."
"PS, for those of you on BA who are lamenting/debating Troegs Nugget Nectar and Bell's Hopslam, I may suggest you may consider a pause to consider this. Not the same style, but wow, it may give you some perspective."
"D - This is a good hoppy Barleywine thats very enjoyable with its good taste its a little too easy to drink worth picking up to give it a try sometime"
"An average pour yields a super-sized, frothy head of reddish tan delicate, large bubbles which dimples down to the surface, while wispy the lacing pretty much there for good. Vibrant sunset red color, all burnt and aglow, the orange influence helps maintain transparency and brightness, only few scattered micro-bubbles to be seen. Tangerine, grapefruit initiates its presence in your nose, the pine, vanilla cream, coal tar, moss and lichens, toffee hit you scattershot, takes awhile to sort it all out, the breadiness is sweet and close to fruitcake, however, the nectarine, apricot, pineapple scents not aggressive, overall the hops clearly in control and, while messy, the good kind of messy. Medium-bodied and lighter of touch than expected, the carbonation flips the flavors like flapjacks in your mouth. Here you feel the alcohol and there's a whiskey, vanilla, oak barrel aspect upfront. The tangerine, pink grapefruit, blood orange citrus remains a major factor. Pine sap, floral dew, orange pekoe tea, moves into plusher golden raisin, fig to apricot, nectarine, mango, pineapple fruit. With some warming you get additional caramel, honey coating. Overall sweet and not that dry while at the same time not uncritically relying on sugar to impress. Hard to fully accept it within its typed idiom."
"Medium to full bodied brew with a moderate to light amount of carbonation. This is quite a contrasting brew from start to finish, from fruity sweet to herbal and bitter. Very bold and enjoyable it wouldn't hurt to have a few of these in the house with varying ages."
"Outstanding example of a barleywine. Good balance, nothing excessive or ""in your face"" that is typical of American versions of the style. Very nice."
"Highly recommended."
"Pours a reddish amber, little to no head, with almost no carbonation. Smell dark fruity notes, plums/raisins, resiny, malty, and somewhat boozy. Taste lots of sugar, malts, not much alcohol, lacks the flavor and complexity I was expecting in this barleywine. Medium bodied, no carbonation, dry finish. Very drinkable for 11% but not much flavor or reason to drink. Would not purchase again."
"Old Numbskull is a pretty refined take on its style. The flavors are distinct and clean, the bitterness is amped up but used to great effect, and the alcohol is well-hidden (at least as far as the taste is concerned)."
"D- No trace of the alcohol anywhere. I like the darker roasted malts here, but there aren't enough hops to balance it out. I'd describe this as lightly sweet with a mild bitter finish. The flavor seems sort of faded or washed out, especially the hops, but without a bottle date it's hard to tell if that was the original intent. Not my favorite by any means, but a solid barleywine."
"Poured a reddish brown with yellow highlights and had a thin bubbly head and left a little frothy lacing sticking to the glass. A nice bouquet of hops are noticeable on the first whiff with caramel coming through as well alongside candied sugar notes but faint dark fruit character. The booze comes out more on taste but meshes good with the caramel notes alongside hopppy and slight brown sugar accents. It still had some good sweetness from the malts and candied sugar. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet slight dark fruity, hoppy, and sticky finish. It drank pretty good and the hoppy bite did add a little dimension to this barleywine. Alesmith does the style right; solid barleywine."
"Probably an older bottle... Tough getting through this... Too sweet for me..."
"2009 vintage. Pours from the 750 ml bottle a medium to dark clear reddish-orange color, with a little white head on top. Aromas of toffee, caramel, citrusy hops and a little vanilla. Medium bodied, and drinkable, hides the 11% alcohol fairly well. Flavors of citrusy hops, sugary fruits and sweet caramel. A nice barleywine, easily drinkable for its ABV."
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with carbonation being below average, but I wouldn't call it low. Drinkability is good, it was a very nice barleywine to sip on this evening. The hoppy, citrus flavors went pretty well with the big malty and caramel flavors and really balanced them out as well. Very good beer overall."
"D: Goes down dangerously easy, great kick, nice representation of style. If it weren't for the ABV, I would drink this beer all night."
"D: I really could not detect the 11 % a.b.v. at all. This is very smooth drinking beer that is not exceptional, but was quite tasty and will be worth another try in the future."
"This is very drinkable and a solid barleywine. I would be happy to have it again."
"D: smooth drinker, solid beer, I always enjoy drinking beers from Alesmith, they have yet to have let me down."
"Still trying to work out my feelings for this beer, but I think I like it. At the very least, I think it's well made and I'd like to know how old the bottle I had was. I'll certainly be seeking out more to investigate further."
"D - Very good Barleywine. Delicious and intense. Might be a bit dangerous on the 11%."
"Overall, a wonderful barleywine. Very drinkable given the ABV. Not my favorite style, but I would recommend this [and wish I had another bottle]."
"Drinkability- Easily one of the tastiest Barleywines I've had the luxury of tasting in quite some time. It's super drinkable and has definitely hit the sweet spot in terms of malt/hop balance. Alesmith is a great brewery and between this beer and Speedway Stout, I'm in love. Thanks much Jeff!"
"Drinkability: This one's probably around or perhaps just past its peak - I don't really see it getting too much more spectacular with age, as the hops have definitely hit their stride and seem to be on a downward trajectory, even though the alcohol bite has completely faded. After finishing the 750, I'm fearful of tackling the -bal 750 (but I'll soldier on somehow, right?), so you definitely can feel the 11% here, even if you can't taste it. However, as it stands, this is a remarkably well-aged, complex, mature, easy-drinking beer. Crack 'em if you got 'em, and crack 'em alongside a -bal version of the same if you got 'em - who knows when the next time AleSmith will grace us with -bal versions of this or any of their other brews may be! Highly recommended, and cheers."
"Old Numbskull has a very clear, light brown appearance. There is a moderate amount of head and lacing. Sweet malts with hints of caramels, toffee, and alcohol are the basic make up of the scents and tastes. Alcohol is pretty evident throughout the smell, taste, and finish of the beer. The feel is decent, with a prominent butterscotch candy note in the back, which I find to be rather enjoyable."
"D- easy enough to finish my share of this bottle. this is still a brewery i wish i had access to here in illinois. pretty hoppy for an english barleywine. too strong to reach for another."
"Tastes just as good as I was hoping. Sweet caramel, toffee, warming alcohol and a good dose of hop bitterness. A great beer to sip on if only I could get a few if these for the cold winters up here I would be very happy."
"D - $13 for the bottle, but I think I'd rather drink this than a $40 bottle of fantastic wine. The depth of flavors is endless. I finished the bottle too easily. A wonderful brew that has been masterfully crafted."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and smooth, surprisingly drinkable for such a strong beer."
"750 mL bottle (2009?) tasted around 12/28/09. Pours a hazy dark orange with little bubbly tan head and beautiful lacing. Caramel, pine, perfume and some tropical fruit in the aroma. Typical bitterness of a west coast barley wine followed by a little sweet caramel finish. Pretty thin bodied, decent carbonation. ABV hidden extremely well, especially if this was a fresh bottle. Solid west coast barley wine, but didn't seem too much like an english. Would've liked it to be a little more malt forward."
"Overall - An excellent barleywine... rich and warming... recommended..."
"D- This beer was very well made and holding up as it did with age just proved it. Perfect bottle for the cellar. I personally loved the fact that it was so drinkable with the ABV so high. Do yourself a favor and get a bottle to try and a to cellar. Alesmith you have done it yet again!"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, sticky, syrupy, and chewy."
"I poured from a 25 ounce bottle into a snifter. It pours a tawny port amber with a massive, sticky white head. It leaves nice lacing all along the glass. There are big piney hop aromas on the nose. The beer is thick and full of piney resin. The high abv is well hidden, making this a bit dangerous. It finishes with a lingering bitter pine. The beer is well carbonated and very smooth. IMO this is more of an American than English barleywine, and I graded it as such. It is a very enjoyable brew."
"D - At 11%, I'm amazed how easy this was to put down. One of the best English BW's I've had the pleasure to taste. If you have a bottle from or around 2007, it's on."
"D: Pretty incredible for its weight."
"Hate to think what this one was like fresh, more like a barrel aged IIPA."
"3.5 D: Not a bad brew, but the alcohol is a bit too apparent in the taste and it then becomes downright militant in the aftertaste. I wonder if aging this a few years to calm that down."
"Not as much complexity as I thought there would be, but there's no denying the craftsmanship of this barleywine."
"D: I'm liking it, not loving it. Horribly overpriced to me: I'd rather buy 3 Old Guardians instead."
"Better thank gn0sis for sending this bottle to me in an awesome trade!"
"D = A nice tasting beer, but a sipper, perhaps its drinkability will improve with more age."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a medium-sized white head. The aroma is much hoppier than expected, with citrus hops, brown sugar and sweet malt. The flavor is more of the same. The beer tastes like oranges covered in a brown sugar glaze. The hop flavor is high but the bitterness is pretty low. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: I'm not always the biggest barleywine fan, but Alesmith has a proven winner with Old Numbskull. I especially enjoy it fresh, but with some age (or from a barrel) it's delicious as well."
"Great Beer, superb barleywine."
"Very balanced and flavorful with subtle English qualities. Very nice."
"Nevertheless, the alcohol heat provides a warming mouthfeel on the tongue and back of the throat, where the heat lingers briefly. Despite the flavor profile being relatively simple, it is executed quite skillfully. A very enjoyable, high ranking barleywine."
"Drinkability: One of the best and most complex barleywines I have had. The alcohol really hits you over the head here. I do like the caramel taste, but really just a wonderful beer. A sipper though."
"Notes: A classic Barley Wine from AleSmith. I have to admit that I find Barley Wines to be a bit overbearing."
"This is a pretty classic example of the style overall that just does everything well. Very well-rounded and somewhat drinkable despite the ABV. Always a good one to go back to. I suggest aging it for a few years."
"Overall, this is a rather boring bw. It doesn't have the sweetness or balance of a great bw. I would skip this one."
"D- Wow I don't know if I could handle this lol. I was on an empty stomach when I started and felt a nice buzz; ate something, continued and still feeling a good buzz!"
"The beer poured from the galss to reveal a nice copper hue with a rich foamy head, mild lacing and legs. The aroma was a mix of apricot, pine and alcohol. The mouthfeel was buttery with a carbonation feel. There was a mild fruity and apricot taste at first that quickly gave way to the taste of earthy hops and an alcohol warmth in the finish."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth. Drinkability is amazing for such a high ABV beer. Alcohol flavor isn't harsh, pretty much non existent. I think its my new favorite barleywine!"
"D-i really like this, big flavors and well balanced. i love hops, seems a little more american west coast style barleywine but i'm not going to split hairs."
"2007 Vintage: Lots of English malts, toffee, caramel left and still pretty hot after 3 years. Very good."
"All in all, this will be a great brew for BA's that enjoy IPA's and American barleywines. I feel like this should not be labeled an English barleywine but should instead be an American."
"D: Good barleywine example."
"Draught at The Red in Santa Cruz. Deep amber with a lasting, creamy head. Candied fruit and butterscotch aroma. The flavor is really malty with caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, and some berries. The alcohol flavor is clean and smooth, but present. Hops balance nicely and never distract too much from the rich malts. Very nicely balanced and drinkable overall, quite smooth and full, but missing excitement for me."
"First sip near the recommended 50F is boozy bliss. English toffee, caramel syrup, and dried fruits hold down the sweet side of the palate, while the hops add a (distinctly American) bitter, resinous balance to the top and sides of the palate. The finish is equal parts bubbly and boozy, with a pronounced warming from the alcohol. Body is medium-thick and a bit over-carbonated at first, but becomes more manageable as the drink progresses. All in all, a delicious interpretation of the English Barleywine style, as Alesmith rarely disappoints. I almost wish I would have given this a few more months in the cellar, but Old Numbskull is still amazing fresh."
"This is full in body with mild carbonation, and then a syrupy middle. Old Numbskull ends on a warming alcohol note."
"Overall, a good attempt at an English Barleywine. Just not up to snuff when compared to other beers in this style. Still a beer I wouldn't mind have access to on a daily basis."
"- A fantastic barleywine, and fits the style very well... even fresh. I will certainly get 1 or 2 more for aging."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability; mouthfeel is near full bodied and fairly slick. The carbonation stays relatively light in the drink, keeping this one fairly smooth. The drinkability is pretty decent, taking aa good hit due to the alcohol presence."
"Not very good, which is odd I was expecting to really enjoy this. May be time to lay off the barleywines for a while. Can't finish this one."
"great mouthfeel. nice and thick. oily from the hops, and carbonated so as to make it perfectly smooth. drinkability is great as well. keeps you reaching for more. now i wish i'd gotten more of this when i had the chance."
"The body is big but clean. Some yeast character but overall smooth. A touch of heat but should age very nicely. A very nice barleywine. To me though this is more on par with an American B-wine but overall very very good."
"D: A nice sipper that improves a lot as it warms up, but still a little too much alcohol."
"D: Super easy drinking. Probably too drinkable for the ABV. So smooth all around. So smooth in fact that nothing really pops out."
"Courtesy of Mauerhan. 750ml bottle capped with silver foil served at 49 degrees in my Old Guardian glass (also courtesy of Mauerhan). Poured a translucent mahogany with a rocky, two inch beige-colored cap. Head eventually settles into a frothy, solid quarter inch skim with some residual slashes of lacing revealed during the tasting. Complex and intense nose - grapefruit, citrus, caramel, malt, brown sugar and molasses. Consistent with nose, but also a little peppery, some dark fruits (perhaps prunes or figs), with a little residual booziness at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and quite bright and lively with a mild burn at the back of the throat. Typically not a style I seek out; however, this is delicious. While there is definitely an alcohol presence, I have to say that it is not suggestive of an 11% abv. An exceptional beer I have to say."
"Poured a reddish brown with an enormous head with that slowly faded to a heavy skin. The aroma was hop citrus with a alcohol kicker and malt bring up the rear. The taste was just opposite of the aroma, toffee sweetness in front, but a refreshing bitter aftertaste. The alcohol did not loom large in the flavor. Feel was about medium bodied with modest carbonation. Drinkability was good, but this is an 11.00 ABV, so keep your wits about you."
"A foil wrapped and capped 750ml bottle split with psycohops and poured into a pair of shaker glasses. The barleywine appears a cloudy crimson brown color with about two fingers of dense tan colored foam. Aromas and flavors consist of lots of caramel, brown sugar, hints of citrus such as tangerine, dates, raisins. Falls between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation. Noticeable alcohol heat throughout. Went really well with some sharp cheddar."
"d - just about what I expect from the style, though the lower amount of sweetness than the typical English barleywine raises the drinkability a bit in my book, definitely a sipper"
"D- Not knowing the age of the bottle I would say this is not extremely fresh as I did not get a hop bomb like some other reviews. What I did get was a delicious and great balanced barleywine that I would not mind having another bottle."
"I would love to try it fresh because I am a hophead, but for anyone with the patience to age this beer it becomes a truly wonderful smooth malty treat."
"[NAH; rare-size/$;y-tap]"
"Surprisingly drinkable - nice balance and a fantastic mouthfeel made this a perfect match with some nutty, buttery-sweet Midnight Moon cheese."
"D - Good. A little bit more of the 11% alcohol comes through at the warmer temperature but I still wanted to drink another glass after the first."
"An interesting mix of powerful, alcohol heavy malt and strong hop. Thick, almost oily mouthfeel. Decent carbonation. Spicy finish from the hop, but the aftertaste has a powerful alcohol component. This is a pleasant, but a strong beer. I only notice the strength in the swallow. Easy to enjoy, easy to overindulge."
"The drinkability on this brew is what you would expect from a barleywine. It's a high octane, slow sipper. It's still a very well crafted and tasty beer, but it took me a very long time to polish off the 750 ml it was bottled in. Overall this was a great beer. I plan on buying another one and adding it to the collection for it to age. Like most barelywine's I would expect this to be much better if I gave it at least a year if not two."
"Blipped ""Something is Squeezing My Skull"" by Morrissey."
"Have had bottles before, all great. This note is from draft at the brewery from a super fresh batch. Hop bomb! Wow. Totally not what I expected. The beer was so fresh it was extremely green pine hoppy. Very interesting. Guessing bottles were still fermenting and carbinating from this batch it was so new. Very refreshing and super easy to drink 10% beer. Fun to try but I prefer bottles of this and with a year or more of age they get better and better"
"Pours a peach mahogany color with a silky tan head. Nose has fruity hops, caramel, plums, figs and sherry. Taste has chewy malts, dark fruits, toffee, earthy hops, peppery wine, and vanilla. Thick body is well carbonated. Big lasting finish. Great stuff, should age very well."
"I'm usually not aa fan of American-style Barleywines. Too much hops, heat, & coarseness (I'm looking at you, Green Flash...). This one may change my mind. Hoppy without losing its Barleywine soul, and smooth and silky mouthfeel, this is at the top of the local Barleywines that I've had. Recommended!"
"Pours a dark brown clear color body, off-white color head, decent lacing, lastingish. Strong, aroma, malty and hoppy dry. Very malty sweet. Sweet malty taste, dry. Somewhat hoppy. strong alcoholy taste. Strong. Way too alcoholy as it warms."
"D - very drinkable, all round great barleywine, ill take a glass anyday."
"This poured a hazy mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like rich caramel and orange with some resin and mild yeast. It tasted like sweet caramel and toffee with some bitter orange peel and bready yeast, and a bit of dry resin and alcohol. It was somewhat thick with mild carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this had a very strong and delicious flavor with great body. It had big hops and noticeable alcohol, which made this more of a sipping beer (fresh). If aged, the hops would fade and hopefully the alcohol would mellow out too. Combine that with the strong toffee malt backbone, and this beer has tons of potential. Another succulent AleSmith beer, which could be nearly unbeatable if it ages like I think it will."
"D: A real nice barleywine here that is not over the top with hops. I think this would age really nicely allowing the English-type malt to show it's stuff. Another winner from San Diego, an easy sipper, drinkablity as a beer is good, for a barleywine, it's fantastic."
"d: enjoyable barleywine, hoppy bitterness never overplays here"
"As Durge stated, a tasty barleywine indeed. Sediment made me feel like I was drinking a wine with silt more than a beer. My barleywine of choice from the Warwick gathering."
"Brought this home from a visit to San Diego last fall and finally got to it last night at the well chronicled Warwick Drinking Society session hosted by Ohoove last night. This one poured a dark amber color with lots of floaties and a decent oatmeal colored head and nice big clumps of lace. The aroma is incredible with butterscotch malt, buttery smooth and vanilla beauty, awesome! The flavor isn't quite as awesome as the aroma but it is still great with a viscous feel. Buttery malt and vanilla. Plenty of herbal hops bouncing around here. Nice body with even carbonation that makes this reasonably drinkable for the style. Not as robust as some but quite enjoyable to my tastes and a very solid barleywine!"
"D- This is a very drinkable barleywine. It's big and bold but delicious enough to keep sipping on all night long."
"2007 vintage- pours a red chestnut with excellent clarity. A ruby glint comes out of the brew in strong light. Medium sized head, settling down to a frothy off white and some soapy lacing. Nose- caramel, sticky hops, dark fruit. Taste- toasty malts followed by a big hop punch. More bitter than I expected and really cuts into the malt sweetness. Actually this is a very dry barleywine. A little hot in the finish between the booze and the tremendous hop presence. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. A top shelf barleywine."
"Really a great brew - one I'll need to compare to a more recent version. Though - I can't argue with this aging."
"Notes: Damn! Don't get me wrong, this is still pretty good. But, it's just way too sweet and alcoholic to be great. I wish the hop bill was substantially increased to take the edge off of the sweetness, and aid in the masking of the alcohol. No idea how old this bottle is, but I'm thinking it may have a year on it, at least. Maybe when it's fresh, the hops would be much more effective. Overall, I'm disappointed with this overly sweet malt bomb that I had high hopes for."
"08 vintage. Pours medium amber color with a fluffy tan head. Aroma is huge toffee with subtler candied grapefruit and oranges. Flavor is multifaceted with toasted bread, caramel, toffee, and graham malt notes along with a tinge of citrus and figs. Thick and chewy body, great nightcap beer."
"D - sip this one slowly and enjoy."
"given the ratings this bottle must be transitioning between good ages for sampling because this is just a step up from ordinary... 7/3/7/4/15/3.6"
"Legendary."
"D - very drinkable for a heavy beer"
"I received this bottle in a trade a year or two ago. I forgot that I had this in my stash, so I figured that 2009 should be brought in properly with a properly aged barleywine. I believe this is a 2004 or 2005 bottle, so we're looking at around 4 or 5 years of aging. This is a delicious beer. Malty, chocolately, and fruity - everything is here and balance is the name of the game. There is not much in the way of overwhelming flavors here - what you have is an easy drinking barleywine that has aged incredibly well. I'd be very interested to try a fresh one to compare the differences. I guess that means a trip to San Diego is needed! Highest recommendation."
"Ruby red color with a creamy beige colored head with excellent retention and lacing. Smell is sweet, yet hoppy. Smooth pine and citrus notes perfectly balanced by sweet caramel and dark fruit aromas, I also get a little bit of sherry and some other vinous notes. Taste is sweet caramel and brown sugar with a beautiful array of hops joining in as well; finish is hoppy, but still plenty of sweet malt to it. Flavors are in perfect harmony, nothing overpowers anything else, instead they all work together. Full bodied, but not cloyingly sweet; carbonation is at about medium levels. Excellent beer."
"Pours a beautiful red color with a thin off white head that disappears quickly. Smells of Caramel and burnt sugar some citrus hops in there too. Tastes of Caramel, toffee, pine and grapefruit. Finishes kind of dry. Nice mild lingering malt and citrus. Mouthfeel is sticky and syrupy, body is medium, carbonation is low. Alcohol is very well hidden, dangerously drinkable. I love this Barley Wine."
"D- For the ABV, its not boozy at all. I was impressed that after a year, this beer was still so hoppy. Overall, a really unique take on the style, but a very good beer."
"Great beer. A little tricky to pour at first, was hard to keep the yeast in the bottom of the bottle. My fault, I was a little too excited to try this beer. Strong taste; alcoholic, with nice mix of flavor. Enjoyed this beer a lot. Will definitely buy again. I would like to age one for a year and see the difference."
"Copper color with medium tan head. Powerful nose and obvious alcohol. Carmel sweet, with lots of hop pop. A multitude of other subtle flavors makes this something very unique. Good mouthfeel. Costs a fortune but worth the price. Super brew. Wish it was not so hard to get up my way."
"This is one of the best."
"12/02/06 Walk the Line Barleywine Festival, Dunedin, FL. 1999 vintage sampled from a 0.750L bottle. It poured a hazy brownish orange with tan head. The aroma was light with burnt oak, sweet caramel. The flavor was smooth fruity kind of sweet red wine maybe, vanilla, caramel and sweet candy orange. Delicious. I really enjoy the way the hops have rolled over with all this aging compared to a fresh bottle. It really starts to turn into a classic barleywine."
"Talk about tasting various versions of this beer at the same time! We did the BA version, and 2 different vintages of the non-barrel aged version (Vintages '03 & '99). Poured a medium amber color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas raisins, plums, alcohol, and caramel. Tastes of dark fruits (the same plums and raisins), caramel, and had a light to medium alcohol burn in the finish. Sweet."
"Drinkability is fairly high. The flavor is nice, though not as aggressive as I had hoped. Still, it's a solid Barleywine and I'm diggin it. Another great Alesmith offering IMO."
"Pours a very dark burgundy in color. A very short lived head forms on the pour and is gone quickly. Smell is malty and alcohol. But to my chagrin, a large amount of hops as well. The hops are too prominent in the flavor. I was hoping for a low hopped 'English' barleywine, which I prefer. The hops are just too much to get past to focus on the rest of the beer. My least favorite beer from an otherwise standout brewery."
"D- Hell Yes! and More Please! I think this is excellent, and even though this should be sipped its hard not to just drink it."
"Humongous ale all the way around; this is a beer to be respected and drank slowly. Every sip is a gem, and even if this isn't my absolute favorite barleywine (and the price tag really hurts me), this is an ale I would like to get to know better."
"Simply incredible...the best barleywine I have ever tasted. 11%?! You cannot even tell. So smooth and tasty you'd think it was a regular beer."
"The aroma had a nice hoppiness to it which was flowery, spicy with some caramel in the background. The taste was rich and spicy. It was real smooth and balanced. Not too hoppy not to malty. The abv was well hidden and it was smooth and creamy and delicious. It was well malted and a very enjoyable brew."
"Overall I thought this was solid, though I liked the BA Version much better, but can you really blame me! I would defintly get this one again though as it was very well done and a very solid beer overall."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. I would have liked it to have a bit more carbonation so that the mouthfeel would have been somewhat lighter, but still this is not out of style. I like the flavor and overall balance and presentation, so I would certainly like to try this one again. I am a little weird in that I don't really like fresh Barleywine, and this one at ~2 years old is pretty much in its prime. Again, I would like a tad more fizz, but still it's not bad at all."
"Overall: Homer Simpson would like this beer...its very, very good. Just make sure you put a ""Duff"" label on this before you give it to him."
"This beer is a cloudy mahogony with a lasting head. The smell is a rich blend of hops and alcohol. The taste is smooth at first with a firey finish, mellowed hops are a nice taste. The abv shows but the mellowness makes this brew quite drinkable. An ear warmer for sure. This brew would certainly age well."
"Tastes sherry-like oxidation with some chocolate. Decent clean alcohol sting that gives me some heartburn. Oranges are still present as a hop flavor, but any piney character has fallen into caramel oxidation flavor. Esters are coconut and apricot. Finish is a fight between carbonation acrid and alcohol sting. Md-thick body and respectible carbonation after being aged such a long time."
"Thanks to seaoflament for this bottle!"
"Pours dark caramel maroon colored and opaque. Smell is hoppy, warm caramelly with a touch spicy cinnamon. Taste is similar with warm, toasty, spicy hoppy caramel and cinnamon like malt and balancing hops. Very drinkable for a big barley wine. Great beer all around."
"A full four fingers of super thick rocky tan foam head erupts with a strong pour. Leaves lots of lace as it fades. Body is an attractive deep brown with ruby accents throughout. Nose i huge with invigorating doughy malts and zesty spice along with pie like fruit tones. Bold rich dark fruit tones. Bold rich dark fruit tones enter the mouth on first sip with a peppery backround. Burnt pie crust teams with piney hops show up on the back of the tongue. Dry powdery spices stay long on the tongue after the sip. Alchol is very well hidden except for a nice warm belly. Sweetness is there but short and dry. Leaves an almost glittering spicey bitter feel for the mouthfeel. This is a big hearty barleywine that will last you all night."
"A nice beer to have as a night cap once in awhile."
"Overall- Not bad overall, this beer is not a hot weather brew in my opinion but rather is something nice to drink during the cold weather months."
"D - I love English Barleywines and this one is no exception!"
"D: for 11% this is extremely drinkable. I am not sure why this isn't the standard for barleywines, since it is absolutely amazing. I always like BWs, but this just made me love them."
"Drinkability: A delightful barleywine fresh (you certainly can't say that about all of them) and one that I suspect ages quite wonderfully."
"D - Fairly drinkable for such a big beer. The alcohol is readily apparent, but not unpleasant. The hop character is the dominant flavor here, but it is kept in check by the huge malt presence. An interesting, and distinctly American, take on a classic English style."
"note: need to purchase a case for aging!"
"Pours a nice brownish color, not much carbonation, not much of a head/sticky lacing either. The nose is big and malty, nice tones of dark fruit/spices, with some caramel notes. The taste is slightly sweet at first then the malts come into plan. The alcohol is pretty present on this one. Medium body. Very drinkable tough. Worth a seek."
"D: A very solid (and slightly hopped up) representation of an English BW. I would certainly seek this out again."
"Poured a nice dark orange color with an off-white thin head. Smell was a malt soup for me with some earthy hops thrown in. The taste was a soup of big sticky sweetness, alcohol, and then cleaned out with some earthy hops. I thought this was ok, but probably wouldn't get it again. I prefer the barleywine style that Bigfoot and Old Guardian hit. This was a little to soupy, syrupy for me, but wasn't undrinkable."
"Overall,I really enjoyed this. I recommend aging it just for fun but doesn't really need to change."
"If the alcohol were brought down a notch or two, this would be a more approachable, drinkable barleywine. As is, it's a delicious if unsubtle beast, perfect for sharing. If you're tackling this huge bottle alone, you better have a long, lazy day ahead of you."
"D- pretty solid beer"
"750ml bottle with a silver decorative foil wrap. Pours into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a beautiful brownish amber color with a nice off-white head. The aroma is absolutely mouthwatering! The aroma features a huge malty aroma with lots of caramel, toffee and hops. The taste starts out unbelievably smooth and malty with the hops making their presence in the finish alongside a warming sensation from the high ABV. Despite the high ABV, this beer is dangerously drinkable, a sipper for sure. Overall, I am completely blown away with this beer. It is the best barleywine I have tried. Highly recommended."
"Overall: A wonderful English style Barleywine, though I think I like the hoppiness in the American style a bit better. I do really like this one though, and in my opinion Alesmith at this point can do no wrong. Try it, you will be glad you did!"
"Cheers."
"I like this BWSA and I can see why it's listed as an English style because of how the malt character plays center stage. I'd drink it again, no problem."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a rich and warm burnt toffee scent that's out of this world. It's a beautiful thing. The taste is excellent. It has a very complex taste that boasts of warm malty flavors and powerful hoppy notes. It goes down slow and smooth with a warm, dry finish. This is a very tastey brew. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer certainly lived up to my expectations. It's one of the better barleywines on the market. Highly recommended."
"Bought this bottle in December in Portland. Pours a nice reddish dark amber with a very nice head that fades to a thick cap and leaves some clumpy lacing. Good head for such a strong non-Belgian beer. Somewhat sweet and malty, but not overly so in the aroma. This is well balanced with some nice citrusy hops and some spicebox scents. Very nice. English in aroma with a tad more hops than usual- without straying over into DIPA terrritory at all. The taste is also wonderful with more of that sweet maltiness restrained in its sugariness, some more citrusy hops, and faint spiceiness that complements rather than dominates. A beautiful example of the style, perhaps a bit less sweet, slightly more hoppy, and slightly more robust than English examples. Mellow mouthfeel, waxy and a bit creamy, and full without being harsh. Astonishing that this is 11% abv- it doesn't taste like it. How pleasant. I'm always a fan of Alesmith's stuff."
"Pours without a head?? so no lace. Thought it might be flat but it isn't. Nose is mellow caramel. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is caramel but it is sweet and sour, some alcohol. Clean finish. $7.70 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"AleSmith has yet to do wrong that I have tasted."
"Thanks again, John!"
"This poured with only a minor, light-tan head. It was slightly hazy and medium-amber in color. It had a great malty nose accompanied by a nice alcohol scent. Mouthfeel was medium, but it had a very spicy aspect to it on the tongue, prevalently pepper, but more complex than that. The finish was explosive with the heat and the spiciness going right up the ol' chimney pipe and into the sinuses. It made my eyes water and then I sensed the tannins beginning to take over. It had a lovely lingering taste of buttery toffee. No doubt that this was an English-style barleywine."
"Way pale (light amber) in color with a tiny head. Smells so strong... Smells so bitter... Maybe a bit of caramel and other malts, but a lot of citrus and grassy hop smell to it, too. Tastes... Pretty close to a barleywine, darn it all! ""Not like that other crap we've been drinking!"" says SWMBO. Ah, interesting... Listed here (now) as an English b'wine. Well... Weird. It's way too bitter for one of those! Of course, it's not bitter enough for a 'merican b'wine... So... How do you rate it? Arg, I say, arg! I'll call it 'merican and say that it's lacking in bitterness. For an English... It's fricking amazing except that it's way too bitter. Oh! The traumas! Right, it's too bitter and too light. At least there's enough bitterness to balance out the sweetness, you know what I mean?"
"Drinkability: Good solid barleywine... I definately prefer Weyerbacher Insanity to this though."
"D- There is some nice complexity in the malt which is followed buy a big monster hop flavor. So although the hops are the biggest flavor the malt complexity really adds to this beer."
"D - This is a fine example of a traditional Barleywine w/ plenty of english malt traits and sufficient abv to make it a satisfyingly drinkable brew."
"This is one I'd like to always have on hand."
"drinkability is excellent too. perfectly balanced - even my coors light drinking father-in-law liked it and commented on how well balanced it is. one of the benchmark beers for the style. balanced and complex enough to keep you going back for more. a big beer and yet the full 750ml bottle went down with no trouble and i was still wishing for another. i really just need to get a case of this one in my cellar..."
"Hello 2008 and another year of great beer drinking, definitely going to pull out some amazing beers from my cellar this coming year, hope everybody had an enjoyable holiday"
"Pours a deep amber red/brown, mostly brown. Good off white head with good lace. nose is of mad hops and clean malts. some malt and dark sugar as well. Taste is a wonderful balance of hop and malt. The malt flavors come first with dark fruit/date and some raisin. Through the middle the sugars and hops creep up slowly. The hops become more intense as the sugar fades. A good crisp hoppy finish. Sugar and hop bitterness linger. Mouthfeel is a little bit thin, but overrall its refreshingly smooth for a BW. Drinkability is dangerously high. Overall this is a wonderful barleywine, I wish it had a little more malt and a little less hop flavor for an english style, but overall it is quite good. The 2003 in my cellar is laughing at me, and begging me to open it like a serpent in the garden."
"Drinkability is rather high, as this is a fantastic BW. Served at cellar temp, good thing theres a few more in there! Alesmith, can't go wrong, I had this during a MASSIVE BW tasting (thx SamuraiArtist!), and now a full bottle to myself is barely enough!"
"Drinks a bit slow, despite all the goodness, a very nice AMERICAN (IMO) style BW, their ABW might just rip your lips off. My favorite Cali brewery, now. Stellar offering!"
"d: Thanks to tayner for this one. I enjoyed this much more than the score would indicate, I just could not find many barleywine characteristics here."
"Drinkability - The drinkability is excellent. This is an instance when the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The mouthfeel and scent and flavor tie together to make one delicious beer. It is much easier to drink than a lot of other barleywines I have consumed. This is a beer I would regularly search out, if it was available in my area. Until then, I am content to order it online, as a special treat."
"Split with a friend and poured into Brooklyn goblets. Poured a seductive brownish-red, with one finger tan head. Quite opaque with tiny bubbles in the head. Huge hop notes followed by a nice backing of caramel. Mega-syrupy in the mouth, as one would expect from a 11% Barleywine. Unbelievably smooth for such a big beer! Hop Kicker the whole way."
"Pours a hazy red hued dark amber orange color with an innocent layer of eggshell colored bubbles that disperse quickly. Limited lacing observed. The smell is a thick rich malt over a nice hop and alcohol fibre that involuntarily cautions the user to dispense a meager portion for consideration. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is heavy but notably shy of being syrupy. Full flavored, the honey caramel vanilla taste is complemented by its smooth texture. The 11.0% ABV is not bashful nor overbearing; very smooth and without any burning effect. A really nice warmer; recommend enjoying this one when you can take it down a notch."
"I think this one has jst gone past it's peak, or possibly is in a rut and more age would bring it back."
"D: Crazy huge beer. Explosive flavor with major complexity. This one could cellar for years to come."
"Bottle. Poured a cloudy, dark amber color with almost no head. Very slight lacing. Aroma of alcohol, caramel, and maybe a hint of fruit. Nice full mouthfeel. Flavor is very potent with alcohol, almost bourbon-like. Finish is hoppy with more of a yeast and bourbon flavor to it. Very nice barleywine."
"Much more hoppy than anticipated. Full of floral piney hops with a hint of citrus. Totally american in style with some residual sugar on the finish but I think there is much more RS than the hops are letting me believe. A candied nutty character with more of a dried fig and date approach in the mouth. Maple with less brown sugar than the nose would indicate. Very toffee and caramel driven with a medium mouthfeel that leaves a long thick resiny finish. I think this would be more to my liking and much higher scoring with a years age on it. However fresh as this one is it's a damn fine beer."
"Score one for AleSmith."
"Pours a dark ruby reddish hue with a 1 inch head comprised of tiny bubbles. The foam steadily recedes leaving beautiful sticky lacing in its wake. The aroma consists of equally big hop and malt characteristics. Very pungent and inviting. Grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, caramel, butterscotch, yeast, dates, grapes and fig are all perceived. The taste and mouthfeel are excellent. Malts come through first with a light sweetness and luscious flavor, and the hops come through strong toward the middle and end. There is a pleasant lingering bitterness that leaves you salivating and reaching for another sip. The alcohol is a non-factor as far as the tongue is concerned. Overall, this is an excellent beer and probably my favorite barleywine to date."
"A superlative beer."
"D: Good and fairly easy to drink, but this one lacks any real character. Nice to try, but I probably won't be buying this one again."
"Alesmith is becoming a new favorite brewery of mine."
"Recommended"
"This beer is very drinkable and I split it with a friend. A great barleywine and I will be picking up another as soon as I get the chance."
"glad i got the chance to have this one. i dont think barleywines are my favorite beers, but this was a very enjoyable one."
"Wow- what a great tasting brew. I love barleywines of all types and this one is a hop-heads best friend. THe pour was bubbly and deep dark amber, with some sweet molasses malts, and citrusy hop aromas. The taste was complex- defined brown sugars, ripe cherries round out the sweetness while the resinous hops hit the tongue with a grapefruit hop-bomb. The sweet burning from the alcohol is evident but not distracting whatsoever. The finish is dry and despite the oily hop flavor, stays that way. Great hop flavors and the brew is light even though the flavors are so thick. I finished one bottle myself in about 45 mins- there should be a warning on beers that taste this good."
"Sort of a clashing-personality of a beer. Big, unrepentantly so, but not necessarily worth its weight in beer-dollars. For me, the ultimate BW test is, is it almost as good as Bigfoot for almost as cheap? Thats a hard prospect to come out victorious from."
"A Great barley wine. Strong in Flavor. Very thick malts, but not an overwhelming bitterness like some barley wines. Appereance is exceptional. Smell is very strong as well. There is a very nice caramel malting that is very thick. The mouthfeel is thick, but lacks crispness. This beer is very drinkable for a barley wine. You should give it a try."
"Definitely recommended. Stock up and cellar this as it should be good for years after the release!!!!"
"Seek this beer out."
"Beer poured a deep brown almost black, cloudy body with a slight tan head into my tulip glass. There was a pronouced aroma of roasted malt and milk chocolate. The taste was more of the same, and more. There was a strong roasted malt, chocolate presence along with some very nice vineous and plum tastes that gave this beer even more depth than expected. The body is full and the mouthfeel is as well but this is a very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a rusty copper to amber in color, cloudy and opaque, a two finger creamy head slowly chunks up and fades back. Aroma is aged dark fruitiness, full on sweet plums and prunes, also slightly grapey sweetness, some caramel vanilla breadiness as well. Taste follows with big pruney and plum sweetness, caramel breadiness is stronger in the flavor than it was in the aroma. Big rich sugary maltiness is nice and soft and creamy. It is cut by a small bite of alcohol at the back of the throat as well as some piney hops towards the finish. A warming alcohol blends with a nice drying hop finish. Outstanding barleywine, this bottle is about one year old but could easily age longer."
"This is a great Barley Wine. I tasted it against Stone's Old Guardian, and this was clearly the better (even if they are slightly different styles). It pours a slightly cloudy reddish amber with a relatively thin off white to tan head. The smell is very aromatic, malty with alcohol and a hint of fruit. The taste has an excellent balance with lightly sweet and complex malty intial flavor with good hop balance. The sweet malty finish is short- to meditum-lived. Full bodied, slightly creamy with soft carbonation and a clean, dry alcoholic finish. Very drinkable for this style. Probably the best BW I have had personally."
"This is one of the best barley wines that I have ever tasted. This beer pours dark brown with thick head and with a citrus hops aroma. Taste is of piney resin and rich malt-for 11% the alchohol is not over-powering and is balanced with the hops-this balance and the 11% give this beer a thick and chewy mouthfeel. For a BW this beer from Alesmith is exceptional in its drinkability. I wish I hadn't split my bottle-just kidding"
"Poured a pretty orange brown from the bottle (750ml bomber), slightly hazy dark copper brown in the glass, garnet red as I sip and look through the bottom of the glass. Not much head at all, just a slight ring around the edge. Aroma is not strong but is pleasantly malty and hoppy as well. Now this is a great tasting beer! The mouthfeel is adequatly carbonated up front, thick in the middle, and finishes clean and dry. This is a well constructed beer. Not as sweet as other barleywines, this one has plenty of hops. The malt and the hops are evenly balanced. Dangerously drinkable--if I were wise I would share this bomber; but I am very happy to have it to myself!"
"07/19/08 - 2007 vintage - almsot a year since I purchased it, hoppy and delicious..."
"Cheers!"
"I actually finished this glass with ease, although it might not be a good idea to have more than one. It's too strong for my tastes, and I think that's why I waited to try this on tap rather that drop 12 bucks fro 750ml of it. I would recommend trying it..."
"D - Tasty and quite drinkable for 10% ABV."
"As noted, AleSmith is one of my favorite American craft breweries and is a permanent fixture in my top-10. As a result, my expectations for Old Numbskull were stratospheric. In the final reckoning, it isn't one of my favorite barleywines, but it's still good beer and should warm me nicely well into the night. I'm guessing that I'll sleep like a baby too."
"One of the best balanced west coast Barley Wines Ive had the pleasure to sample."
"It pours a hazy, dull brown with virtually no head. Aroma is light hops with a significant caramel malt presece. Taste is also a lot of caramel malt, with a good amount winey oakiness. This beer hides its 11% ABV extremely well. Mouthfeel is fairly sophisticated and complex, better than most champaigns I've had. This is the most drinkable barley wine I've ever had."
"Drinkability: a very tasty barley wine that is relatively easy to consume. The alcohol is a warning to keep this at a slow sipping pace."
"it's very bitter for an english BW. the flavor is not as full as i expected and the hops provide a numbing bitterness. a little hot in the finish, too. it's tasty, but doesn't cash the check written by the aroma. nice brew, though"
"First sip reveals a syrupy texture and average body with very gentle carbonation. Flavor is as nose advertises with sweet fruit, pears again, a general sugaryness and caramel too. The beer moves to a boozy warm alcohol hit on the finish. This brew is a definate sipper even after sitting on it for a year I found it to be just a bit too hot still."
"D: The ale is big and bold, as I've come to expect from AleSmith. The high abv, while not detectable, hurts the drinkability but the ale is worth a look anyway. This strikes me as more of an American Barley Wine, based solely on the intensity of the hops."
"drinkability: good"
"Drinkability/Overall: This is a malty beast but oh so smooth. Rich flavors meld well together. Quite drinkable for 10%."
"D - I enjoyed this, but it was most certainly a sipping beer, and one that i may not go back to in the future. but, who knows? maybe i just didn't get an outstanding bottle."
"Pours a deep ruby red with a large tan foamy head. The smell is ""bisquity"" with dark fruit, alcohol, and some hop pine. The taste is hoppy with dark fruit,alcohol,bread yeast,and a fair amount of malt. The m/f is heavy with all flavors mixing well. A very good barleywine,but like most b/ws it's not too drinkable. A heavy beer with a heavy feel and taste. A definate sipper. Cheers."
"The body is huge. One of the thickest beers I've had the pleasure of eating. The residual sugars coat the palate leaving a linger bitter-sweet finish. Very good stuff. It is very green, however. I will try to age the remaining bottle for at least a year, hopefully two."
"A little pricey for what it is. But a dam fine brew."
"When poured into my glass, the color was a amber with an orange hue and no foam or lace, as usual with a barleywine style beer. The smell was of a sweet/sour/bitter nature, with the nature aroma of hops filling my nose. The taste was alot like the aroma. Swee/bitter/sour. Think and sort of creamy in the mouth. Not the best barleywine I've tasted, but, pretty damn good. Maybe my third or forth favorite."
"D- Very good. Nice complex brew. Definitely one you have to be in the mood for and if you are this beer would just be amazing."
"D- A good barleywine. Not my favorite, it's not quite sweet enough for me and a little too burnt/bitter. Still, a good product and one I wouldn't hesitate to buy again. (2007 edit- Damn near my favorite barleywine. Buy as many as you can and age them at least a year. Wonderful creamy goodness!!)"
"Cheers2Beers"
"A tasty, well balanced, and drinkable English style barleywine: well worth a pint or three. However, as I often feel, the $10+ for AleSmith's 750ml (26.2 oz) bottles is steep, especially given that similarly excellent beers can be had for $5 and even less, for 22 ounces. I like the beer, but I dislike the feeling that I'm paying for fancy marketing, bottles, and foil wrapping. I might buy it again for a special occasion, but I don't, and won't, buy it regularly."
"CHEERS !"
"Overall: Still has that slap of Old Numbskull Barleywine, but I expected a little more longevity from such an expensive brew that markets itself alongside other high end brews. I would not recommend cellaring the Old Numbskull beyond the 24 months mentioned in the 6 to 24 months or longer on the back of the bottle."
"Not a whole lot of head or lacing to speak of but the sun kissed caramel body is still inviting. Not to mention the massive nose that makes me think of a passionate kiss on the first date. It's full of magnificent caramel, bitter grapefruit hops, sherry, rum, and raisins. If I could, I would buy this again and again. Pure pleasure. Taste reminds me of Sierra Nevada Bigfoot with the hops slightly muted. This isn't a bad thing as it gives the malt a chance to shine. In all, the taste is largely the same as the nose with the hops being far more understated. I'm really enjoying this. Mouth is lightly carbonated lending a velvet feel to the body. I could drink lots of this. I would love to prepare a big meal and serve this instead of dessert. A fantastic effort at a barley wine."
"This beer is 10%, and not too subtle about it, but it's still a real treat. Going to finish a 750mL tonight, with very little effort. It's a very good thing this bottle isn't bigger, or I'd be in real trouble."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Hogtownharry): Poured a clear medium brown color ale with a small foamy brown head with minimal retention. Aroma of sweet caramel malt is dominating without being too sweet though. Some floral hops are discernable but nothing overwhelming. Taste is also dominated by sweet malt but I cant find any complexity of dry fruits characteristics that I usually enjoy. Some hops provide a slightly bitter finish but nothing to overshadow the rest of the beer. Body is defiantly too thin and watery for my liking and alcohol is well hidden. Even do I usually enjoy English style barleywine, I cannot say that I was overly impressed by this one."
"D - high due to the smoothness, but lowered due to the ABV"
"Now that's a true American Barley Wine! Big on everything; from hops, to barley, to alcohol, to richness. Full of flavor and intimitating from beginning to end. Big barley, bready, hoppy aromas stare down over a dense, ruby colored brew. Leaving good head retention and lacing, evidence of great proteins. Overwhelming flavors of barley malt, taking on molassas and brown sugar proportions. Intense hop flavor casts a piney, citrus shadow on on the malt base. Well aged and melded into a bitter, earthy, malt sweetened beverage. Alcohols take on caugh syrup intensity and reach a light solvent evaporative sensation. Though thick and heavy on the palate, the beer finishes a balanced sweet / bitter ratio. As great as it is, I often have problems assigning very high marks to the extremely-hopped Barley Wines. Alcohols strength also keeps me from scoring higher."
"This is the non-vintage version in a blue bottle with foil and a standard cap. I think I chilled this one a bit too long. Poured a great cloudy, orangey-tan into a chimay glass I had laying around. Had a lovely if short-lived tan head with some moderate lacing. Initial hit on the nose was of citrus and fruit with a bit of pine, followed by some complex malts and a dash of hops. The piney smell was was carried through in the taste with a hint of citrus and some up front hops that give it a bitter kick. As I sip it I get used to it and begin to notice the subtleties of its taste. It goes down slowly, but not unpleasantly. All in all a decent brew, and quite a lovely barleywine. I will buy another bottle and try aging it."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is veryu full bodied. The alcohol is pretty well covered up. The residual alcohol shows up as a pleasing spicyness. This beer has a pleasing spicy, hoppy and malty balance. This is just a excellent drinking beer. The beer was empty before I was aware of it."
"This one is a looker without a doubt. A gentle pour produced a tan head that was more than sufficient to top off the delicious looking honey orange liquid that lies beneath it. Quite clean. Very good from a visual standpoint. The nose lays out some crusty malt dynamics. It reeks of dirty, sugar cane-like sweetness with some toasty and frankly burnt aspects. It has a roughness to it that gives it the barley wine attitude that is so appealing. The thing is raw and to be respected. Alcohol vapour rips through at times in true wraith fashion. The taste is funky old sweetness with a dryness fueled by the alcohol. Scorched caramel and apple skins in a sense. Somewhat chalky. This barleywine stays decent without overstepping its malt boundaries into a cloying demise. Brash, but accommodating. Nice. The mouthfeel is fairly light in my experience. The lighter and less intrusive use of malt lends to a lighter body and a drinkability that flourishes due to both the superb taste and less filling nature of this brew. Well tuned. Not an abomination. Wish we had this stuff in Da Mit."
"I'd love to lay a bottle of this down for a good 4-5 years to see how it matures. As it is, it's certainly a barleywine to be reckoned with, and one well worth trying."
"Drinkability: Having been to the AleSmith brewery, I understand why they bottle in 750 ML bottles; however, that is a barleywine to consume and I wish more brewers would bottle their high gravity beers in 12 oz. bottles"
"Bottle Pours a light brown with red tints. Has almost no head. Has a good sweet aroma with a good mix of hops. Looks sort of flat with a slick texture. Has a bold duration and a good strong finish. A nice amount of bitterness. I would call it medium bodied. A very smooth drink with a touch of dryness. Very complex, it keeps my mind jumping and changing. This is one you just have to try for yourself and make your own judgement. After the 750 I decided I liked it."
" This is a well balanced barleywine. The hops are piney and citrus flavored, the malt provides a nice caramel profile, with some cherry-like fruit flavors. Mouthfeel is nice, heavy without being syrupy. Drinkability is good, but given the size of the bottle, the richness of flavor, and the fact that I can't buy it in IN, I'll save my other bottle for a while."
"a very respectable barleywine, one to seek out, it's got a lot to offer."
"D - The alcohol is so integrated and the hoppyness is so balanced, this has to be the perfect barleywine."
"Taste was deliciously sippable, with the initial impression being made by sweet and caramel malt until the citric hop oils literally took over. Finish was peppery and pungent. The beer felt sticky and a little coarse on the palette (which was undoubtedly due to a young age). I can see this one aging quite nicely, but alas I only bought this single bomber. Drinkability was good despite the intensity, since I like the characteristics it possessed. Not the epitome of the style, but a very good example."
"from the bottle. poured amber with a light tan head that left a small amount of lacing. aroma, alcohol, malts, orange, raisins, sweet pineapple, and other tropic fruits, honey. flavor I hope it taste as good as the aroma, a nice blend of fruits and chocolate the alcohol kind of takes a back seat, honey, malts. a nice bitterness and dryness. glad I have another one in the cellar"
"This beer poured a slightly hazy copper to amber color with a thin tan head. Hints of sherry, vanilla, plumbs, and a touch of tangerine on the finish. The taste is sweet and smooth. A mix of fine sherry and brandy. Layers of vanilla, black cherry, plumbs, and the tangerine I sensed in the nose. Incredibly complex. The alcohol heat blends well with the sweetness of the malt. Full, smooth mouth feel. Very satisfying, and surprisingly drinkable. Wonderful beer."
"Well, for something as brash as this beer - it ain't sweet, but that's the only way to describe the combined heaviness and easy-to-drinkness of the flavors - it's reasonably easy to drink. This glass of beer is half gone and my head is spinning cheerfully. I give it an above average score."
"Cool color just needs a head, and with the amount of hops they must have used in this one, I guess only the very low carbonation is to blame. Smell is great, but the taste needs major reworking. Scratch the overly nutty malts and the harsh tree-bark hops, and this would be a classic. As it stands, I won't be buying it again."
"750 ml capped and foil sealed bottle with blue silk screening. The bottle lists the ABV as 10%."
"This one had been aging for just short of a year when I finally cracked it open - I just couldn't wait any longer. It decanted a mostly clear red colour with fine, off-white head. This reduced to a thin wisp and produced excellent lacing throughout. Superb balance of aromas with some toffee evident even from a distance, caramel and tea, along with plenty of piney hop character. Mild alcohol pulls the aromas together nicely. Toffee and pine become stronger as it warms and a hint of fruitiness creeps in as well. Caramel and toffee kick off the flavour, but balanced bitterness comes forward as the sweetness fades in the dry finish. Subdued hop flavour. Mild alcohol starts at the mid and continues through the end. Overall, very clean and balanced. Light carbonation, medium/full body. A highly recommended barleywine, I can't wait to get hold of another bottle."
"Pours a deep amber color near brown with a white tight sticky head that is gone pretty quickly.deep vanilla aromas mixed with a generous hopped piney aroma intermingled nicely.Wow what a combination of sweet caramel and alcohol with a generous amount of grassy piney drying hop very balanced and indredibly flavorful barley wine big time winner here I wish I had more what a flavor combination with a big alcohol punch.A little harshness in the mouthfeel dept. kept it from being off the charts."
"This beer is only 9.25% ABV?!? I can feel the heat before the beer touches my lips. Kind of permeates its way up the nostrils. Other than the alcohol there is at first a subtle sweetness of malts followed by a pungent, earthy hoppiness that is more American than English. Got some sickly sweet bornw sugar and a little bit of sour cranberries too. Mouthfeel is light. Lots of bitter puckiering from the hops and even more burn from the alcohol. Tougher beer to swallow than I was expecting."
"So far, I can live with the beers presentation. But the taste is blaringly harsh in its alcoholic temperament and the finish bites like a red ant. The initial outpouring of strawberry-accented malts is hammered by the aggressive finish, while the body feels limp and anemic. At its best moments Numbskull is suggestive of fruited brandy. At its worst, its simply disappointing, even after retrieval from ideal cellaring conditions."
"Pours a clear ruby red, with some super chunks at the bottom of the bottle, medium off white head forms, spectacular lacing and legs on the glass. Smell is caramel, coffee, pine, floral/citrus, chocolate, tea and vanilla. Taste is chocolate, caramel, pine/floral/citrus hops, vanilla and rich toffee. Mouthfeel is very smooth and fulled bodied, with low carbonation. Fucking smooth as hell, aged for a while so wickedly smooth, one of the best American barley wines I've ever had. Seek out and drink. Thanks DrJay!"
"Poured at a tasting event, brought by Lou91. Tasted virtually the same. Didn't really gain much in flavor, maybe a bit more alcoholic, but had one small drawback. Seemed much more carbonated. Strange, was expecting the opposite. Either way, it was still top notch."
"A very nice barleywine. It poured a slightly cloudy burnt orange color with almost no head at all. The color was very nice though when put up to the light. The beer gave off a very fig like smell mixed with slight alchohol tones. The flavor was one of great balance. At first the sweet malts hit me and the great silky mouthfeel mixed the alchohol flavors in well with the rest. There was a nice raisen and citrus flavor and it finished off nice and clean with a little bit of hops sneaking through. I wish I knew what year this was becasue it seemed like it had aged a bit and the hops were no longer there to balance out the rest of the flavors. A very solid offering and one worth trying."
"Old Numbskull was a cloudy dark amber color with little lace or head. The aroma had a very nice hop bouquet with essences of honey, toffee and alcohol. The taste was smooth and rich with a myriad of elements that included fruitiness, sweetness, honey, toffee, and alcohol. These elements lasted into the flavorful and smooth finish which had a slight dryness. All together this was a great beer and well worth the price. Perfect for a cold damp night or any other night for that matter."
"$12.49 for a bomber."
"Decanted from a bottle with blue lettering and silver foil during a beer tasting. Smelled of cedar, pine, wild straw and nutty berries. Had a huge head and as far as bottle-conditioned goes...loved the smoky cloudiness the brew offerred. This beer has real sharp, pronounced, focused flavors and a sweet and bitter combination on the long finish. A real treat to have!"
"Shared a bottle of this with fellow BA's David and Otis Cambell at Redbones, thanks Walter. I believe it's this years vintage, the bottle showed an abv of 10%. I really liked this one, and was pretty impressed. Aroma was a bit all over the place, but I liked where it went: some sugar spun flowery notes, and with a dash of green hop arbor and twiggyness. Burnished copper in the glass, filmy thin tan head. Five minutes into this brew, I was getting those warm and fuzzy feelings :-) Very smooth, some caramel to start, real lemon citrus finish. Manages to bring a big and bold abv down to easy sipping deliciousness. That shared bottle was enough for me at one sitting."
"Great pair with 2 year old Montgomery (U.K.) Cheddar."
"Drinkability... well, I have to take away half a point because I finished the bottle solo and felt quite buzzed for a bit. This was a good thing, especially that day... I needed it. But I couldn't drink too much more of it. One was plenty, and it took a while to come back down. A wonderful beer, and even at $13.99 I will get another to cellar (I know it's a lot, but hell, it's a limited distribution here)."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" beige head over the dark amber brew. Head stands pat, nice lacing, especially for the style. Aroma is sweet malts, assertive hops, and alcohol. Taste is well-balanced, even though substantial malts and hops are present. Dry close with alcohol warming. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent for the style. Yum."
"Incredibly smooth for a barleywine, but lacking some of the complexity that I would expect from the style.. worth a try, especially for those who might normally shy away from the style, as this is a very approachable example"
"Drinkable for its strength, but nothing I would seek out. A good brew no doubt - but no Speedway Stout."
"It's a very nice barleywine with some limited complexity; but overall it's kind of obtuse."
"Body is big and thick with a chewy mouthfeel and creamy carbonation. Definately for sipping. I would love the chance to dance with a whole 750 to myself! Thanks to Felton for sharing this rare treat."
"Drinkability and Notes  Hey its a big bottle, and the alcohol means that you need two people minimum to polish this beer off in one sitting. That said, this is probably the most easily drunken barleywine I have had. It sticks well to the English style, not the over hopped American style that is so popular today. If you are looking for Bigfoot, stay away, if you want a deep, complex, balanced Barleywine seek this one out."
"i should have kept it cellared perhaps, i drank it upon purchase. still a fine offering and a noble effort for category."
"I did not get much smell from this one. The flavor was sweet malty with moderate bitterness and a good alcohol bite. The flavor lasted a bit. This had a light body and slick mouthfeel. I would not rate this a big barley wine, but a light one to share with a friend."
"This is a really nice malty barley wine. I think I could happily drink it - slowly! - all night. It's a great sipping drink, sweet and warm."
"A superior barleywine. Well carbonated, tasty orange and some roast, and lovely dark colour. Fruit was apricot peach, and honey on the tongue, well malted, and mollasses. Booziness in finish. 2000 vintage. Bottle dark for aging. Full mouthfeel. Thanks Don"
"Smells of cognac, tropical fruit, candy (liquid Smarties?), and rich, bready toffee. Hop spice/ample bitterness in there too. Oh, and alcohol. Taste is all sweet, candied tropical fruit over a toffee malt background. Alcohol is hard to ignore; cognac-like. Not too hot, but definitely warming. Spicy, medicinal, herbal hops increase in bitterness by the finish. Still, this is sweeter than it is hoppier (like an English style BW should be, no?). Finish is long and bittersweet and makes me happy. Big-bodied, oily, thick, and syrupy near the finish. Whew! This is a big bottle! I can do it though..."
"Really nice bottle. This beer pours a dark red color with moderate head that hangs around and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma has some dark fruit and molasses with some hops in there as well. The flavor starts out very malty with the dark fruits. It is followed by the strong hopping and finishes bitter. Very well rounded. Drinkability is pretty good."
"This is a very well constructed barleywine that would benefit from some aging. Alcohol presence is a bit too pronounced, at this stage, to enjoy more than one of these at a sitting. Wish I had a few of these to lay down."
"The beer pours a very pretty dark ruby color with 2 fingers of off white head that leaves sticky lace as it recedes towards the beer. The nose is very nice. There is a deep sweet caramel background but it is hidden behind a load of hops. Piney, spicey hops. The flavor follows suit, starting very sweet and slightly roasted, almost coffee-like, and moving towards a beautiful hoppy finish. What a well built barleywine. There is no hint of the alcohol. The feel is deliciously thick and rich. Hot damn. Drinkability is fantastic for this style. Everything comes together very well and results in a great beer. I would highly recommend this one."
"Drinkability is very good, incredibly complex, even for a complex style loads of interesting flavors and great transitions."
"Despite the QC problems noted in the pacific beer group, this beer was fine and very drinkable. It poured nice and alive with hints of belgian sugar and yeast - sweet and slightly skunky. Honey brown and opaque it looked great. Taste had seriously mellowed and balanced. Tastes of orange peel, honey and fresh baked bread. The hops were astringent and a nice compliment to the melllow malt flavors. I think I'm convinced that the advice to drink Alesmith fresh may be well said."
"I am numb. This is great stuff!"
"This beer poured a nice dark amber color and formed a huge foamy off white head that coated the side with solid lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. The aroma is of malt, hops(Centennial?), slight candy aspect and a hint of the alcohol. The flavor was of malt, slight caramel and some hops. The body is fairly heavy, if not quite meaty. The finish is slightly astrigent. This one is fairly heavy and probably needs more aging to mellow it out."
"Comments  AleSmith does it again!"
"750 ml green bottle with a silver foil wrapper covering the cap, I believe this is a 2003 vintage but cannot find a date to verify this. This beauty pours a dark reddish brown color with a collar of light tan. The collar leaves nice lace about the glass. The aroma is sweet with caramel and dark fruits with a good amount of alcohol as well. There is a lot more going on here that I would have to drink another one to most likely identity in this very complex and wonderful smell. The taste has a big sweetness up front that tastes of caramel, rich fruits and spiciness. The hops are present and become more evident as this one warms and creates a bitter dry finish. Mouthfeel is thick and rich and has decent carbonation. This is a very smooth barley wine that seems to improve with age from what I have read. It is excellent at the point it is now with a very complex nose and taste and a surprisingly smooth finish, I can only imagine how it could improve."
"712"
"Thanks to the LongBeachBum for this beauty. I love great barleywines and this is just that."
"""EAT"" I'll insert DRINK here as well ""CARBS - RIDE YOUR BIKE!"""
"2003 green bottle, cheers CapFlu Hazy orangey amber, very sticky off-white head, fully diminishing into a beautiful film. Aroma displays extremely complex malt profile which I'm bound to fall in love with. Potent maple, honey, caramel, cookies, molasses treats. Assertive fruitiness (lots of mango, plenty of peaches, dried bananas, oranges, watermelon, cantaloupe). It smells thick too with notes of bubble gum and brown sugar. Hard to describe overall, but every flavor is well presented and balanced by a subtle hop character and frankly, the best dessert pie never smelled that good. Taste displays more of that bubblegum I adore along with that chemy melon and soft marshmallows. After a few sips, the bitterness gets very pronounced, grapefruity, dry and bitter, a bit too much for me to appreciate in great quantities. It's a little sad though because it's my new favorite Alesmith and prefered California barley wine and there was more alcohol than I had hoped for in the taste despite being completely hidden in the aroma. Mouthfeel is top notch though, smooth as hell, velvety, chewy and creamy, medium-bodied and showing a perfect amount of carbonation. Did I say I like the aroma?"
"The flavor was outstanding. Tons of dark fruits. This beer was juicy and big and massive and the flavor never stopped in the mouth. Not once. Ripe fruits, a little banana with black cherries. Finish was long lasting. Big in the mouth. Both of us said that we wanted the entire 750 mL to ourselves and we meant it and we both could have done it. Very drinkable barley wine. Barley Wine: A style that is closely becoming my favorite but is very unmatched compared to Imperial Stouts, especially Speedway. I have had 3 beers from Alesmith so far: IPA, Speedway and Numbskull. All three were excellent. Alesmith is amazing. At this point I have a new favorite brewery."
"A simply fantastic barleywine from Alesmith, and I have to thank WVbeergeek for supplying this one as well on the Gathering. As good a barleywine as I've recently had, and certainly one I'll be waiting for next year!"
"Appearance: Amber orange tone with a decent sized cream head leaves behind some lacing. Aroma: English style toasted caramel malts slight toffee with an addition of citrus hops, can't help but notice the biscuit note that is in the malt profile interesting. Taste: Creamy alcohol infused bursts of toasted malts with that biscuit finish coming into play, what a great barley wine not excessively hoppy brings it back to the roots of a true barleywine I think I like this one. Mouthfeel: Big beer with a creamy texture to it I would classify it into the medium to full bodied range, what a brew from Alesmith. Drinkability: Easy drinking high abv could be a bad combo, but really effortless only had about a 7 ounce sample but boy did I enjoy."
"Note: After decanting the beer does have a definite obfuscated burnished copper appearance, got to love all that Gunk coating the bottom of the bottle!"
"Tasty, lip-smackingly delicious...I've got to end it there, and surely thank Mr.Longy O'BeachBum, Sir Darren McSumerianTrance hisself for allowing me to try this magnificent BW for my own self...I'm still drnking it, the jury's still out, except that I'm sure that is among my favorites. Serves as an above-average nightcap....good night, everyone!"
"I had my first bottle of this @ 5 months ago before I joined BA and didn't remember liking it this much. Good stuff! Would love to try it aged in a bourbon barrel. Hint hint."
"Flavor is presented first with a touch of sweetness that is quickly brutalized from the tongue by a burly pine hop flower flavor that lasts through to very last caramelly drop makes its way to your throat with a long lingering warmth of alcohol."
"This beer when held up to the light is a hazy copper-orange color, otherwise it is a fairly drab amber color. It is topped by a fairly dense tan head. The aroma at first is all hops; grapefruit & flower nectar. As I smell more the malt comes out in the aroma. The malt aroma helps to thicken the aroma of the hops in this beer. The taste is surprising in its restraint from bitterness. The hop flavor is here I full force though The body of this beer is like a beefy giant. I find myself enjoying this beer quite a bit. The interplay of the malt and hop is quite well done. The predominant taste is that of a hoppy nectar, there is a solid malt character & the bitterness is fairly subtle for an over hopped big beer (which I really like here). There seems to be some light oxidation notes here (perhaps a hint of sherry), which helps to further the complexity. Quite enjoyable and I have a full 750 to savor this evening."
"However...It was worth the effort, most definitely. I thoroughly enjoyed this barleywine, Old Numbskull. It was a pretty dark orangey colour with a good sized head. It smelled sweetish and citrusy, and it tasted kind of similar to its aroma. It was greatly balanced, I thought, with the hops just shining through the malts. I tasted slightly sourish citrus flavours (try saying that 5 times fast), and a delicate sweetness that made me want more! I thought it had a good mouthfeel and better drinkability. Like I said, I wanted more! Just without the hassle of the wax. that `#(*&^#$ wax..."
"I have become a big fan of Alesmith (particularly Speedway stout), This one poured a dark, amber color - decent head and retention. Smelled strongly of hops, more like a strong IPA than a barley wine. The malt sweetness and thick body are there, but the green bitterness stands way up front. An assault on the taste-buds, for sure. Clearly a quality (substantial) brew. I have become a big Barley Wine fan recently, and this is as good as any. Hops and malt both excel, strong, yet somehow still refreshing. A truly great brew, I'll give it an edge over Bigfoot and Old Crusty. It took awhile for me to work up to the really strong beers, but I love them now. Add this to the Speedway, IPA, and Wee Heavy as great Alesmith beers. Thanks, Ron!!!"
"This is a wonderful barleywine from the fine folks at Alesmith. The 1999 vintage of Old Numbskull is quite a chore to open. In fact my girlfriend can attest to this as she helped me peel off all of the black wax that this bottle is sealed in. After you get to the cap and open it, you also have to find a way to extract the rotting cork....luckily, I did this quite easily, and the beer that this rare bottle held within itself, was definately worth all of this effort. This beer pours out a very carbonated deep red/peach colour with an ample head of white bubbles! This was a much prettier barleywine than I expected it to be. Next we have the aromas, which were excellent, and consisted of sweet malts, slight citric and floral hops, and a nice flare of alcoholic spiciness. This kind of reminded me of HOTD's doggie claws, perhaps 99' DC may in fact smell like this stuff. The taste is wonderful, an explosion of sweet malts, with almost no hint of alcohol. The finish reveals some soft citric and floral hops as well as a nice flare of spices. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth on the tongue, the bottle conditioning and careful aging of this beer has really made this stuff feel like silk in your mouth. The drinkability is incredible, as you could knock this stuff back all night long. Can I get this on tap somewhere....please? No!? Well damn you than. This is really a penultimate version of the American barleywine, hand-forged to perfection by the brewers at Alesmith. I am very indebted to JCalabre for providing me with this old cellared example, of what I believe to be one of the top 5 barleywines made in the Unites States, er...no North America, er...no, what did I want to say? Oh yeah, The WORLD!"
"750ml bottle. Surprisingly hoppy aroma for a Barley Wine style. Slightly hazy and deep amber like the color of Anchor Liberty. Has a nice big head and laces well. Wonderful peach or apricot flavors with big hops that are bittering. Although not a typical Barley Wine style, this is one fantastic brew. Doesn't have the sweet malt of a Barley but more like an Imperial IPA. Alcohol is masked completely. Not a fan of Barley Wine but this was right up my alley!"
"Medium red brown color. Small frothy white head. Aroma is bready, malty and sweet. Touches of fruit and some mustiness. A full-bodied barley wine. Malts are nutty, bready, fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are grapefruity and slightly bitter. The malts are very smooth and creamy. There are a lot of complex flavors going on in this beer. Nicely balanced and very smooth. The malts really shine in this English style barley wine. Hides the 10% alcohol very well. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Thanks to Gusler for the bottle eh!"
"This is the 2002 vintage. There's no date on the bottle, which is a 750 ml green champagne-style bottle with the Old Numbskull logo in blue and a silver foil around the top. No cork. Poured into my glass, it's a dark brown brew with a reddish hue, topped by a small tannish head. The head goes down before too long to a modest lace clinging to the edges of the glass. I have to say this is the most unique barleywine I've ever smelled. Not only am I getting the expected caramel malt, English hops and citrus character (the brewer is said to have used a mix of American and English-style barleywine brewing techniques), and spicy alcohol, I'm getting some tart apple and apricot as well. The flavors are just as complex. At the front, some ""English"" hop bitterness sets the stage, and then a smooth wave of caramel malt takes over. The malt is slightly bready and yeasty as well. A bit of fruitiness is present, some fig and plum as well as a bit of the tart apple that was present in the nose. Very ""Belgian."" A hint of ""American"" citrus is detectable. Leafy/plum skin hop bitterness in the aftertaste, very pleasant. Extremely smooth mouthfeel. Surprisingly lighter bodied than most barleywines, but very complex and enjoyable. Very interesting and unique take on the style. It's like Belgium meets America meets England. I highly recommend trying this one."
"Notes: Clearly drank this one before its prime; hop-induced citrus qualities haven't been given enough time to meld with their malt counterparts; will re-review; present incarnation not nearly the equal of, say, Victory's Old Horizontal."
"update 8 May 2003: Trying the 1999 vintage, it's a hazy burnt orange color w/ a small head & a nise nose of green apples. Velvety on the tongue & sweet, it's a delite. Now the downside: the cork was sealed w/ some sort of shrink-wrapped rubber that had adhered to the bottle via concrete. What a pain in the ass to open! 2000 vintage: reddish brown in color, malty, w/ a slightly sweet taste & a dry finish. I taste a little vanilla/orange flavor. Very nice."
"Notes: A touch of age has hit the brew, it seems to be at its peak if not passing it so this holiday winter season of 2002/2003 is the time to pop the 2000. Impressive and a good go at the Barleywine style."
"This is for the 2000 Numbskull tasted on 10-25-02. Nice medium maltiness. Starts off a bit bland, but the bitterness slowly picks up as does the alcohol. Ends up really good. Body is dark reddish amber with an off-white head. There's some lemon zest in the aroma. I think it's a compbination of the alcohol, malt and yeast."
"It's golden brown and has good looking off-white head that leaves traces on top all the way to the bottom of the glass.  The smell is reminiscent of Bigfoot but slightly on the mellower side.  The hops are definitely there, but they don't smack you in the face.  The citrus flavors tend to dominate and detract slightly from the drinking experience.  Despite the 9.25% abv, the flavor of alcohol doesn't make itself obvious.  It has an almost milky mouthfeel that is reassuring in a barleywine.  It's good but it's not one of the best from Alesmith."
