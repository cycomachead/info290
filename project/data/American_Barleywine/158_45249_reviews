"Overall good beer but at 25 bucks a pop, not worth the price. There were some off flavors that detracted from the beer reaching elite status. Glad to have tried it and always intrigued to get my hands on anything Great Divide releases."

"This is a snifter beer...like that Henn' ya'll like to drink. It's rich, luxurious, and a sipper. Too easy of a sipper I'm afraid. This beer is going to have me hurting later. The booze is so well hidden that it scares me a bit. Can't get enough of that wonderful Duff....er, Ruffian. Thanks a million Aaron!"

"Bottle in trade from Adam. Big thanks for a big want to a great trader. Looks like an ’11 on the bottle so I am assuming this is a 2011 bottle, 750 ml, poured 8/17/14. Bottle #1113. Pours muddy brown with a creamy two finger off white head. Awesome aroma of whiskey, oak, vanilla, interestingly some chocolate here, toffee, and lots of figs and some brown sugar. Flavor is big time bourbon but super smooth, oak, massive vanilla tones, figs, brown sugar, some caramel, lingering vanilla oakiness. Medium to heavy bodied, medium plus carbonation, smooth finish with nearly no booze burn. Wow this is really nice."

"Overall, a pretty unique taste but I had held on to this one for about nearly a year this fall so others' mileage may vary."

"Small head with scattered lace on a cloudy brown and copper body. Aroma of whiskey first and foremost with some apple, apricot, and caramel. Flavor sweet and tangy and although it is boozy in the way you can tell it has a high alcohol content it isn't in the way that makes it hard to drink. Red apple, fig and apricot for fruity notes. Thick body and light carbonation. Smooth for sure. I held onto this one for a year and a half. I like the whiskey quality. It's almost not very beer like but still glad I tried it."

"Overall an excellent barrel aged beer and the Old Ruffian stands up well the the barrel treatment."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Obviously this beer was completely flat, and medium bodied. Not good. Overall, this would have been a very fine example of a BA barleywine if it was not completely devoid of carbonation. Hard telling if it was always like this or if it just lost pressure while aging. Still the flavors are there, and I quite enjoyed the beer even without carbonation. I will re-review with a 2011 bottle I have around..."

"Overall, I have to give this straight 4.5s. There's little fault to find in any aspect of this beer. Outstanding."

"Overall this is wonderful for a two year old barrel aged barleywine. This definitely isn't the best barrel aged barleywine I've had but it is still a great offering if you're able to get your hands on it. And despite the usual ability to age barley wines and how well regular Old Ruffian ages, I'd suggest drinking this one sooner rather than later."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is really good, nice for the style. Full bodied overall, a great carbonation level and super smooth. There's a nice sweet finish with a nice warm finish, slightly sharp at the end. Not too hot though and I actually would have predicted a lower ABV than 12.7%. Really a great beer, strong the whole way through but moderately gentle, super drinkable. Thanks Geoff for the recommendation and the trade."
""
"I've not yet had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of the base Old Ruffian, so I can only surmise as to the mollifying effect that the Colorado whiskey barrel has had here, though I will say that the understated effects have a seemingly positive spin. More relevant, supposedly, are the big and brash hops, which do well here to preserve the American status of this tasty barleywine, even as the the wood is equally Yankee in nature."

"Review #2000! The last of the surviving beers from my accident! Bottle #592 of 1188! Served from bottle into New Belgium globe. Poured a deep red brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, vanilla, wood, earth, caramel, brown sugar, and sweet alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. Still a nice touch of booze going on in this one with a nice touch of vanilla to bring the barrel to life. The touch of vanilla really helped this beer out as without it, it could have been a complete disaster without it. Worth your time trying if you get the opportunity."
""
"Great beer, only wish it'd been cracked earlier in the tasting."
""
""
""
""
"O: I definitely enjoyed this one. The whiskey bite is sharp, but the booze is well hidden and it isn't hot at all."
"Again, there are some nice qualities about it that are just unfortunately lost in is flat, murky depths."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely very drinkable for 12.7% ABV - sweet but not too sweet, with nice oak components, apparent from the barrel aging. I'll have pop the Old Ruffian soon to see how it compares. Luckily this one wasn't infected like some of the Barrel Aged Yetis that were released before this."
""
""
"Pours a red amber color with hardly any head at all. The smell is sweet and malty with just a touch of hops and alcohol. This definitely tastes like it has some age on it. The barrel characteristics have smoothed, but the bitterness level is still quite high. The sweet malt overtakes the bitter in the beginning of the sip, but the bitterness crushes the finish. The body is too thin with no carbonation."
""
""
""

""

""
""
"Overall - Incredible. I'd like more barrel, but this is one immense barleywine."
"O-This is my favorite of the BA Great Divide beers (having not had the BA Claymore). It comes across like Stranahan's and Old Ruffian have enough common flavors in their profile to really mesh well, accentuating the toffee and caramell with an oaky vanilla hint. Really well done, worth seeking out."
""
""
"Out of the gate a dark brown with an inch of khaki head. Initially probably a little cold so the first smell is some sharp oak, whiskey and raisins. As it warms the aromas blend into a better combination. Taste is similar, with raisin, sweet malt, some hops, whiskey and oak. I wonder how bourbon barrels would work with the base beer? Good amount of carbonation, not too sticky, not much alcohol burn. Overall, an above average BBal barleywine. Glad to have tried it."
""
""
"M: Full bodied. But not overly thick."
""
""
""
""
"I drank a healthy amount of the bottle and wanted more. Very drinkable now with age, but a few more years cant hurt, sans a little oxidation. A slow sipper, something to read a book by the fire with."
""
"OVERALL: This is big, complex and interesting, though the heavy booze quality and the thin, harsh feel make it quite challengind. Although Great Divide is an excellent brewery and their regular Old Ruffian is good stuff, I'd seek a different barrel aged barleywine if I were looking for this style. I'd gladly try an older bottle or a new vintage of this when it comes out, but I didn't find the 2011 is not enjoyable enough at this point to go looking for another one. Cheers again for the trade BOLTZ9555. Always a pleasure."
""
"Dark amber-garnet pour, cloudy, with a thin foamy ringlet. Nice aroma of caramel and toffee, notes of dark fruit, bourbon barrel, and earthy hops. Mostly the same in the taste, malty, sweet, caramel, toffee, molasses, touches of plum, bourbon and some hop bitterness in the finish. Full-medium body, pretty smooth...I think this was a 2011 vintage, and any heavy booziness had definitely mellowed by the time of the tasting, making this quite good overall. Second best barleywine of the night I'd say (behind MoAS, which is still one of my favorite beers)."
""
""
"Notes: Where Old Ruffian made for a good US Barley Wine the barrel aged version makes for an outstanding experience. Bottle with 8 or 9 months on it, and it feels assertive with some nice roundness.. It could do with some extra aging. Bottle picked up on my visit to Denver, and wishing I had traveled back with two more. Whiny about the distribution pulling out of DC a year or two ago..."
""
""
"A decent beer overall but at this point, this one still needs a bit of time. Nice complexities lurk underneath the booze but the barrel presence covers a lot right now. I'd love to revisit this one in a year or so."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Barrel Aged Old Ruffian is clearly an outstanding rendition of the style, perhaps even exceptional. However, for my tastes, it would need a touch more complexity, a fuller synthesis of flavors and clearly notable bourbon to truly put it over the top. Nevertheless, despite the steep price tag, I might be tempted to grab this one again."
""
"O: very good beer, but it's just a bit too dominated by the dark fruits in the taste. It also looks a bit gross, but overall it's really delicious. Happy I shared the bottle, but it's drinkable enough to want more immediately when you're done."
""
""
"Giving a bump for the great balance. Thanks for the share 4DAloveofSTOUT."
""
""
"Overall - A beer with some big bold flavours that is perfect for sharing. I think the bottle might have benefited from a bit more age to take the edge off the booze, but it was still quite smooth. A great beer that is well worth seeking out."
"Bottle: Poured a bright copper color ale with a medium size head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of whiskey is nice end very enticing with nice balanced sweet malt notes. Taste is a great balance between some whiskey notes with dry grain notes and a solid malt backbone with sweet caramel and light toffee notes. Body is quite full with medium carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I really enjoyed this one which I find had great balance between whisky and malt."
"pours deep muddy brown with a decent sized mocha head. smells very sweet and malty with a little bit of the barrel. the malt bill is very apparent on the first sip with huge amounts of brown sugar and a maple syrup like taste that fades to a very nice chard whiskey barrel. mouthfeel is a little light and carbonation is on the higher side but in this case it works. overall i am very impressed with that way this beer turned out, just enough barrel presence to complement a already impressive beer."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is amazing and yet quite underrated, imo. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Old ruffian was my first American barleywine that I liked. When that beer goes into barrels amazing things happen. It a fantastic base beer for barrel aging. This beer is the best American Barleywine that I have drank and reviewed in almost 500 beer reviews. There is nothing to dislike about this beer it is just so good. Its a nice complex beer with very well integrated barrel aging. Whats not too like? I honestly could drink a whole 750 myself... its just that fricking good. The boooze will sneek up on you so be careful, dangerously drinkable at almost 13%. Dont age this beer is drinking perfectly right now!"
"Highly recommended for many years to come! Age will do amazing things to this awesome brew."
"o - overall a winner. seek this one out. whiskey is a great match for this barleywine and a nice change from all the bourbon barrel aged barleywines these days."
"The mouthfeel is leaning towards the heavier side with carbonation being a little below average. Overall, it was a pretty good barrel aged beer but not one that really can hang with the top of the style. Things just didn't seem to come together all that well for it at times. While it was a pretty nice beer to sip on this evening, there is better out there for the price."
""
""
""
"O - An all around well balanced beer. Nice on all fronts, but not way up there."
""
"I imagine the whiskey will wait to impart its influence until after it warms up a bit--too subtle an influence there might provide for my biggest criticism. So mellow and smooth a taste for such a powerful beer, I eagerly await it taking me over (no homo--too much shades of grey in the collective consciousness right now). This is undoubtedly a propulsion into classy tastiness for the Ol Old Ruffian...."
""
"2012 vintage from a bomber. Figgy fruit smell followed quickly by the alcohol and whiskey. Dark dried fruit, carmel. Cloudy brown liquid under a decent creamy foam. Very mellow, round, smooth in the mouth followed by a brightness. Mellow malty character, sweet, Carmel. Tastes of whiskey and barrel don't overwhelm, are balanced. Pricey at $25 but very very good."
""
""
""
"This is barrel-aging done right. I can’t tell where the beer stops and the whiskey begins. Great flavor."
""
""
"O: Definitely up there in my favorite barrel aged barleywines, very enjoyable beer."
"Pours a slightly murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, wood, and bourbon/whiskey. Taste is much the same and quite sweet with an alcohol kick and woody finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is is a very good beer with a great barrel aged presence in the aroma and taste."
""
""
"Pours nice dark amber with fleeting yellow foam. Nose is bourbon barrels, vitamins, burnt caramel. As it warms, it's like cinnamon toast crunch - hella cool. Flavor is like a cinnamon bun - rich and sweet with caramel, dark malts and herbal/spice qualities. Really not doing justice with that sentence. Medium bodied with a simple syrup tone and reserved carb. Good beer, wish I would have bought some when I had the chance a couple years ago."
""
""
""
"Not as thin or hot oddly enough but still thin, a bit more carbonation"
""
"O: I was a bit worried after smelling it but the taste is great on this one. The base beer has been toned down by the barrel and the vanilla and whiskey flavors really play well with this one. My bottle says 11.1% so it must have gone down compared to previous years."
""
""
"750ml bottle generously shared by jdiddy. Pours slightly darker than unpasteurized cider with no head. Not much happening in the nose I have to say - a suggestion of dark sugars. It's shocking how little is revealed in the nose, but how robust the flavors are - malty, whiskey notes, wood, sweet and just a kiss of bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light with no carbonation and a slightly oily texture. This beer has been on my 'want's list for quite some time and I am really grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. A very solid BA Barleywine, although not as mindblowing as I anticipated given how much I enjoy the standard offering.."
""
"Overall, the best BBBW I've had this year. Incredibly balanced and complex. This is one to share as I was really feeling the three glasses I had! I don't know if it's the Stranahans barrels or not. I hope it's not because I don't know if Great Divide will have them available anymore after the deal with Breckenridge. Seek this beer out as it is fantastic."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. Stranahan's whiskey is amazing. Alcohol is hidden very well."
"O-- Conflicted as liked the beer but in reality prefer regular Ruffian more. Might be showing it's age a bit as was thin in spots and needed a lot of air to open this up. Decent enough stuff but not on par with other BA barleywines out there. Not as much substance to the body as others out there."
""
"O: Overall, a pretty good beer, but nothing too exciting. Definitely not on the top tier level, but slightly above average for the style."
""
"This is another barrel aged beer that spent way too much time in the barrel, alternatively this should have been blended with some fresh Old Ruffian as I am really wishing the base beer came through in some way. As it is this is purely a vehicle for the Stranahan barrels, if that is your thing then you will enjoy this beer, but if you are looking for beer then you might be a bit disappointed. I am enjoying this beer a little bit, so it is not a complete loss, but not enough to remotely want to finish this bottle by myself (I might finish my glass)."

"Drink- Thanks Joe! This was a long time want of mine and with the first beer of the night being this. I knew it was gonna be a good tasting. A great beer with large flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Thinner bodied than expected with a slick mouthfeel that gibes way toward the end of the palate to a dry, slightly hot finish. Well balanced with a decent barrel character that doesn't overpower/overwhelm the other flavors. Dry toasted oak flavor along with some sweet bourbon and a strong vanilla character. This is countered mid-palate by some earthy malt and hints of caramel, toffee and hazelnut. There is a decent amount of booze but the high ABV is well masked resulting in one of the most quaffable barrel aged beers I've had in a while. Thanks again Kiel!"
""

"O: Huge disappointment. Wish I could have had this a bit younger, hope my BA yeti doesn't do this."

"Cheers!"
"O: Decent, but not great frankly. Might pass if offered again, but would like to try a fresh or 1 year aged bottle for comparison."
"O- This beer is pretty complex, it’s definitely enjoyable but I had higher expectations for it, tasty and enjoyable otherwise."
"O - Like this beer, although for more bitter things I'd generally prefer a DIPA. This is a nice beer though."
"I don’t have my typical review lined up for this beer because I fear it may have been an off bottle. I’m giving it all 1.0’s to reflect exactly how bad I felt this particular bottle was. No “pfft” on the cap-crack had me thinking that this was simply low on the carbonation. Pouring the beer as hard as possible revealed zilch in the way of carbonation in the puce colored beer. The body was thin and watery to boot which has me thinking something was just flat out wrong here. Smelled like generic malt and tasted like watered malt that had wet whiskey barrel dunked in it. Some slight sourness and acetone suggests a possible infection. I can’t give the standard smells and flavors that I usually report because it was so off and weird. If I was guessing, 600 of the 750ml’s ended up going down the drain. I’ll try this again if the opportunity presents itself but no way am I going to trade for another."
"This is very tasty. It's not a 'session' beer, for sure....but it is delicious! I hope to get to taste this again, someday."
"This is going right back on my want list."
"This is barleywine number four for those of you keeping track at home. Compared side by side with the non-BA version this beer was rather interesting. The first thing that can be said about it is that this beer is devoid of bubbles, totally flat, carbonation kaput, etc. Though its reddish amber color is still rather inviting. The aromatics of this beer are a good deal of mellow bourbon characteristics. There is a lot more vanilla on the nose of this barrel than on previously smelled BA beers. There are lots of good and subtle flavors. Aside from the vanilla, oak and bourbon, which have mellowed to a really nice point, the main flavors are a rum raisin, butterscotch, and strong notes of fig. It's rather tasty stuff, if only it wasn't a flat syrup it might be even better. Overall this was tasty and I am loving this series of barleywines, because there's not been a bad one amongst them."
"O: Apparently flat bitter bourbon isn't my thing."
"2009 edition, bottle #627/1188. I'm very curious to see how the Ruffian takes to the barrel-aging. It pours a slightly murky garnet-amber topped by a very minor bit of dirty white foam. The nose comprises bourbon, oak, caramel, vanilla, toffee, grapefruit, and orange peel. The taste holds notes of orange peel, bourbon, oak, vanilla, light cocoa, ruby red grapefruit, and, near the finish, a light and vague semi-astringency. Luckily, that last bit ain't enough to really mess with things. The body is a hefty-ish medium, with a very light carbonation and a kinda oily feel. Overall, a very nice bit o' barrel-aged b-wine goodness. 'Nuff said."
"D - A definite sipper... Sophisticated... Worldly... Unfortunately, the best barrel aged beers are those that add depth and complexity to the base beer... Unfortunately, in this case the barrel aging takes away from the Old Ruffian components... While the alcohol component is nice, overall this one is a slight disappointment..."
"Full bodied, decent carbonation, this gets a stamp of approval, even though I'm not a fan of American barleywines."
"O-glsd I got to try it. More'age would have done it favors...."
"D. As always, I'd rather an English barleywine with barrel aging, but I like this."
"Pours a murky amber brown. Not really an attractive looking beer. A bit of white head that dissipates quickly. Smells phenomenal. The nose is awesome tastes heavily of bourbon with a touch of hops but not very bitter. Vry dry on the pallette but the bourbon character is the only thing that carries it..."
"It should be obvious, but this one needs a while to warm. My first sips didn't impress, but the more it warmed, the happier I was. Not quite the supremely world-class beer that BA Yeti is (but how many are there, really?), but damn excellent in its own right. I'd be willing to drink this any/every night of the week."
"Bottle 303, and thanks I believe to Jason B. Having this was like having an old friend over after several years, wiser and more interesting. At serious wine booziness, it was a major challenge to conduct intellectual exercises. Great looks with a to-inch head. Boozy but also woody aromas. Mellow, hoppy, oaky, full mouthfeel, it was very satisfying. The bourbon, Thank G-d, was minor, as we Canadians are not such big corn whiskey fans. I was getting more excellent oak. A great blending, and something I wanted to share, and is meant to share, but could not on the coldest night of the year."
"D: Goes down easy enough but I wouldn't want a ton of this. I was happy with the pour I got. Love the regular version, and this is definitely a delicious brew. Thanks again Jeff for your generosity!"
"Taste is really quite nice with the booze mingling with the dark fruits and sweetness in a really fantastic way. Good barrel character with some nice toffee and caramel. A bit hoppy as well. Mouthfeel melds the barrel character, some sweetness, booze, and a bit of bitterness quite well. Definitely a well made brew. Not quite as good as the BA Yeti, but quite good and I'm really glad I got to try this. Thanks again, Paul."
"D: I was very excited to sample this limited release, and would definitely have it again. Best enjoyed in small quantities, this beer is ideal for sharing a few ways."
"EDIT: Had this again on 2/13/11 at Max's in Baltimore, MD thanks to jslot38. Enjoyed it even more the second time around and added a few notes."
"D - Pretty low...lack of carbonation hurts tremendously. Flavors are good, but the non-existent carbonation is a real problem. This is a bit rough...I had very high expectations that sadly are not even close to being realized..."
"Overall, it is a pretty decent beer, but I expected more. The nose was a bit muted, but the taste got better. Decent drinkability."
"D - its a good beer. Easily drinking my glass. But its a big beer. Sharing with 2 others is great."
"First, I love Old Ruffian, and look forward to its release every year, so I was very excited to finally try this one. Pours a dark mahogany color, with ruby edges and a light brown head that hangs around for quite a while. On the nose, I picked up a little oxidation, some grassy hops and a little bourbon. On the palate, medium bodied, rich, alcoholic, with a little bourbon and branch, oak, milk chocolate, dark fruits and caramel. The Stranahans barrels add a nice complexity to an otherwise hoppy barley wine, but I would love to try this one fresh, and eagerly anticipate the arrival of the 2010 version."
"Bottle. Pours a murky orange color with a slight white head. The aroma is farily fruity to me with notes of apples and pears mixed with some barrel notes. The taste is very similiar to the aroma. Sweet fruit flavors up front that is very easy to drink, almost too easy. No real hop characteristics. Very smooth. Medium mouthfeel. Slight warming effect from the alcohol."
"D: Nothing offensive; nothing great. Just very middle-of-the-road as far as a barrel-aged barleywine goes. I wonder if it was just a bad bottle."
"5.0 D: Awesome brew. This demonstrates bourbon barrel aging at its finest. Bourbon complements a very solid barleywine. Highly recommended though I heard the second batch of this isn't as good."
"thanks to koopa for the trade"
"Thanks to Nate for bringing this, bottle into a Bells tulip...Pours an ugly light brown, muddled, with no carbonation at all...The aroma is awesome, lots of vanilla, really nice wood notes, a little bourbon, caramel, and a touch of hops...As great as the aroma is the tasting is as outstandingly awful. The sweetness is gone, all you get is rotten wood, lots of chalk, and a little alcohol. A weird wood finish just dooms this. This was undrinkable, could only get through half a glass."
"750 mL bottle courtesy photomike. Pours a brownish gold color with a khaki head. Big whiskey notes alongside the usual caramel and toffee, partially damped by a mild woodiness. Vanilla, caramel, and coconut are the predominant flavors with a slight astringency that could be from the wood or the hops. Markedly less hoppy/bitter than the standard version. Not a huge fan of barrel aging a hoppy BW."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Very neat and the potential is there but I think we all agreed some more time would tame this beast. Thanks Eric!!"
"Bottle #338 of 461, generously shared by Lance. Thanks! Pours dark amber with a nice tight head. Smells wonderfully sweet and whiskeyish, with notes of coconut, whiskey, and light grain, with some spicebox aromas on the finish. Seamlessly integrated, and very nice. The taste is a little hotter, and a little more overtly oaky, but luckily the oak doesn't dominate. Still has nice notes of coconut and whiskey along with the wood notes and the heat. A bit hot in the mouth, but smooth. Very nice indeed."
"There may have been a problem with the bottle I got judging by the issues with carbonation."
"Awesome beer overall. Great even for the style of -bal aged awesomebeer."
"Needs at least two more years, probably five, for the oak and peppery sting to settle. No sign of the sherry-like (I describe it as soured caramel-like) oxidation that would so enrich the flavor of this beer."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. good barrel character. overall it's a bit muddy and i think that with another year or so in the cellar this one will be amazing. now to find another somewhere..."
"This is a well made brew that feels a little unintegrated at this point, I imagine with some more age on it, it would be amazing and one of the best."
"D: I was really shocked by the amount of bitterness this beer still had. A nice beer all around..."
"Beer seems heavy, very malty, sweet up front, finishes slightly dry overall. Mouthfeel is good, no carbonation in mouth unfortunately but its still good. Overall a smooth mouthfeel. There is some bitterness in the back of the mouth. I'm glad I got to try it. Thanks Lunch."
"D: drinks easy for as big as it is bit no carbo...."
"While BA Old Ruffian isn't as mind-blowing as BA Yeti, it's still a remarkable ale that I feel incredibly lucky to have experienced. Thanks to JMBSH for both bottles. I would still take the original over this beer (and 99.9% of all beer on Earth), but BAOR is definitely one of the best of 2010 so far."
"It has flavors of pine and earth, leather and tobacco, some whiskey sweetness that balances the oak and hops. Sherry-like oxidation contributes depth. Full-bodied with a boozy, oaky, caramel finish and lingering resiny hops. This is pretty dry and hoppy for a bourbon barrel barleywine, a nice change of pace for the style."
"This is delicious stuff. The barrel-aging process lends a sharp, green, fresh & tannic woodenness to the normal Old Ruffian barleywine profile. Loads of whiskey flavor, almost as if ale & spirits were blended and bottled. Mouthfeel is smooth, chewy, and breathy with booze but far from hot. Low carbonation, thick body, and a slightly bitter hop note on the finish. This beer is a sipper for sure, and something I'd gladly have again. I almost wish I could've checked my baggage flying home from Denver and given this beer some age, but it was still wonderful fresh. A tad pricey, but a treat worth savoring."
"Overall quite a treat. Not a disappointment in any sense for what it is, and really seems a great display of barrel aging for this big hop-forward barleywine. Though, if Old Ruffian is your favorite beer, don't expect this one to wow you with being bigger and better, because it really seems to come out of the barrel its own creation. Definitely one I wish I had more bottles around to sit on for a couple year."
"Limited production. I'm stocking up, so get it while you can."
"It's pretty hot right now, so I would say to hold on to it for now."
"You can tell that it's heavy, but the 12.7% is well integrated. Quite drinkable."
"A tasty beer, but like the Barrel Aged Yeti not appreciably better than the original. I've tasted three-year-old Old Ruffian that was a lot hoppier than this interpretation; perhaps that's what happens when you put the beer in whiskey barrels."
"The palate opens with plenty of barrel character, caramel, vanilla and oak tannins. Not as complex as the nose suggests, there's still plenty of nuance, though, with honey, brown sugar and caramel. Boozy heat appears mid-palate, lingering on into the finish. Vanilla is moderately noticeable as well. A touch tannic, this aspect helps balance out the mellow sweetness of the beer. Medium-high in body and quite low in carbonation, this feels great on the palate. Soft and lush until the tannins take a hold, the way this beer segues from a malt-forward experience to the oak finish is quite excellent. As I sip this alongside the BA Old Numbskull, I can only be thankful for both, the experience and the decadence of it all. I would love to try this with a few years on it."
"A very impressive effort from the folks at Great Divide."
"Bottom line: Great looking beer colourwise though the lack of any ""real"" foam hurts just a tad. Very weak smell but more than made up for by the taste, which is superb. Mouthfeel on the thin side and the carbonation or lack thereof, in my final analysis, works ok as it does in certain other brews. Drinkability is another very strong point for this brew. Overall...I'd have to say highly recommended."
"D - It's relatively easy to drink considering the heft to it, but it still took my a while to put down my 6oz or so. A very nice beer, but for the price I think there are better options available."
"D: Suprisingly good considering its' heft. This bottle is meant to be shared by many."
"Drinkability: BA OR is a good beer. It is not a great beer, and on the whole I find it lacking in many of the ways that makes Old Ruffian itself a truly great beer. I can't help but thinking that the barrel aging really adds as much to this beer as it takes away from it. While it augments the rough, harshly pleasant earthiness of this beer, it also thins if out. While it compliments the underlying sweetness with barrel sugars, it also kills the head and mutes the bitterness in the mouth and nose. And though the barrel aging may be - on the whole - a wash, the higher abv% does knock the drinkability down a little. So, definitely worth having if barrel aging (particularly whiskey barrel aging) is your thing, but - since most people won't get the chance to try it - don't feel bad if the plain ol' every day Old Ruffian is the only thing you have access to. You're more than breakin' even."
"Drinkability: very drinkable--goes down smooth with almost no alcohol evident--which I think is spectacular given the high ABV. Nicely done here."
"D- Excellent beer but I think it loses a bit in the barrel."
"D- Definately a beer to be sipped!"
"D: No problem drinking this one. The ABV will kick my ass in the end but I'll keep drinking until I can't!"
"Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth with low carbonation."
"Overall this was about as solid as could be. One of the biggest, baddest, barrel aged beers I have ever had. I would have no issue at all with trying this one again any day!"
"Overall I'll be the first to admit that I'm a sucker for bourbon in beer, and this one did not disappoint. Definitely worth a shot if you can get your hands on it."
"D- Awesome sipper. So smooth and mellow but slightly hot.. however a bourbon barreled barleywine has got to have some balls though right?"
"D - If not for the big flavors and the ABV, I would drink this all night."
"Drinks easy enough for the style, not the best ABW I've had but pretty damn good. Way over priced at 25 dollars a 750 ml bottle IMHO"
"This is a great beer but the bourbon in the taste might be a tad too much for me. Either way, I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it."
"D: This one's pretty intense. Certainly wouldn't want to drink an entire bottle of this, but it's great for sharing"
"Another must for the winter beer flight."
"Pours a great ruby brown color with a big frothy head. The retention and lacing are both good. Some earthy hops and fruity esters in the aroma, as well as some whisky, oak, and vanilla. Flavor is very alcoholic and the whisky and oak are less apparent than in the nose. BA Ruffian is sweet with a low level of hoppiness. Finish is sweet alcohol. The beer is medium - full bodied with great carbonation."
"Drinkability - This is a great beer, and my favorite of the two BA beers Great Divide released. I am really glad I got to try this. Thanks again Jonathan."
"D - Very easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"Drinkability was pretty high for such a huge beer. All the extra time spent in barrels really smoothed out the edges on this beer mellowing out the booziness and adding to the complexity. I am pretty pleased with the final product."
"That said I'm really glad I had a chance to try it. Thanks again Ryan."
"D: World class. Simply put this is an amazing beer."
"D: Amazing. I definitely need to try the whiskey from next door they use."
"This pours a glowing, hazy cedar and has a silky tan head. The nose has a complex blend of oak and whiskey up front with sweet candy malts, ripe fruit, and subtle hops through the finish. The barrel aging compliments this ale very well. It creates a super complex flavor profile with perfect balance. Delicate yet full body suits the style. The best beer Great Divide has ever brewed."
"By the way, open this carefully. My bottle overflowed a little bit."
"Great looking brew, a deep burgundy color that has lasted the entire session so far, at least 30 minutes. Fairly nice nose has some complexity from the barrel (vanilla, whiskey, newer oak) as well as some notes from the original beer (caramel, fruit.) Flavor is nicely balanced between original beer and oak elements. Bold flavors of whiskey, caramel, toffee and vanilla. Very tasty and impressive in every way. A good beer now, but being that it is properly bottle conditioned, this ale has excellent potential."
"750ml bottle $24.99. These expensive beers scare me. I was not disappointed that I bought this one. Nice dark brown color, darker than normal ruffian. Smells like whiskey, vanilla, hops? tastes like oak, vanilla, whiskey but subtle with hints of toffee that I get from regular ruffian. This is not just whiskey, you can actually taste the barleywine in this, nice. One small sip does warm the belly so you can feel the alcohol but it doesn't play much of a factor in the taste."
