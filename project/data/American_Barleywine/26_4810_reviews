"Murky craft.  Imagining unfiltered raisin/prune juice.  Very aromatic and lush.  Gummy bear, hops and raisin standout.  Taste of hop and sweet.   Soon after a peasantly sour mixed with a bitter effect and the higher abv blending in comfortably.  Mouthfeel has hop bitterness lingering in back of the mouth.  Sugars lay on the tongue.  Overall this is really a treat.  Not one component outdoes the other.  Well done."

"My first blonde Barleywine. This is much more hop forward throughout, with less sweetness than typical Barleywines. As it warms the alcohol comes out, but is masked early on. A terrific beer than I would gladly drink again!"
""
"2013 served on tap 3/24/15. Honest, if IPAs turn to barleywine with too much age, this still has a way to go to reach barleywine status."

"Orange wax bottle.  Alcohol smell was non existent.  Fruity notes remained in the nose.  Poured a very hazy copper color.  Taste was dark fruit.  Cherry, plum, prune with a nice sweetness.  I greatly enjoyed this.  The hops obviously faded and this almost resembled a quad, but it was fantastic nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hops are very pronounced and the alcohol heat is present but tucked behind the hop burst.  A great med-full full body mouth feel. Overall a good barley wine, even if it is slightly off the ""traditional"" flavor profile and more along three floyds hop forward MO."

"Better than Bigfoot in my opinion, absolutely worth a purchase if available and one who enjoys American BWs."

"Just an awful barleywine that tastes like an IPA just like everything from 3 floyds other than Dark Lord!!!"

"Semi-hoppy barleywine. More for a barleywine/IPA drinker. Not bad, just not my thing."
"Very good beer, has the delicious notes you except from a fine barley wine such as toffee, raisins, dark fruit, has an unexpected touch of fruitiness in there reminiscent of apples and/or pears. isn't overly sweet or boozy. Slightly metallic in the finish. very good take on the style, just not quite sure i'd go through the effort and expense  it took to get it again."
""
""
"Overall - great barley wine. Hoppy, fruity, dangerously strong."
""
"This beer isn't bad, I'm just not a fan of the hoppiness.  As I figure out my tastes, I can easily say that strong citrus hops aren't my thing. As far as hippy beers go, this isn't awful."
""
""

"Overall, this was a surprisingly and remarkably hopped beer aromatically.  I guess we weren’t quite sure what to expect for a “blonde barleywine”, but for some reason a major hoppy component wasn’t it.  It was pleasant, translating well into flavoring.  Sadly, it remained way up front in the mouth, getting battered by waves of sharp booze and heavy grain.  This introductory taste actually made us think of a “Super Zombie Dust”.  It was so hopped!!  Again, however, you then hit this monstrous wall of bitters, puckers, and chemicals.  All that said, we’ve had DIPAs that are bigger malt bombs than this barleywine, but the booze keeps you in line with your thinking; at least this works when remembering style.  This beer wasn’t bad, but it just kind of took us for a loop following that description.  If you want a big, big beer that isn’t afraid to show you what it is, then this is the ticket for you, our friend."

"2013 Orange Wax.  Color: Nice deep amber, ruby tonez.  Smells like caramel and rye spice, maybe red fruits on the tail.  Smell follows on through the palate- nice caramel sweetness balanced by that rye spice, with something like apple acidity, fruits.  Bit of booze, but I suspect the age has mellowed it considerably."

"22 oz. bottle from a Sat., 12/20/2014 Better Beer Authority Bottle Share (thanks, Richard H..), 2013 vintage (orange wax), poured into a BBA snifter glass, drank over 15 minutes"

"I'd say this would be a good candidate to age or have as a barrel aged brew. As it is, it is a hop bomber that hits just a bit strong for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Seems to have aged well; no overt oxidization. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Deep amber body with only a thin off white head that quickly dissipates. Big hop notes on the nose along with some brown butter/burnt caramel. Definitely an american barleywine. This is like a DIPA with the malt bill kicked up for added body and sweetness. It works very well. This is surprisingly drinkable and almost refreshing at such a high ABV. Definitely worthwhile for hopheads out there."
""

"A decent hoppy barleywine. The big problem is that it's lacking anything particularly interesting. No flavors that really grab me, not particularly well balanced. It's what I'd expect, but nothing more."

"This is a very impressive brew. It's definitely hop forward and has alot of DIPA characteristics, but there's no question that it's a barleywine. It's pretty pricey, but it's well crafted. I really like this one fresh, but age will not hurt it."

"Hazy but still translucent copper-colored liquid, with a small off-white head that retained as a thick ringlet and dotted the glass with lacing. Aroma of thick sweet malts, and somewhat off-putting old resinous hop oils, some neutral alcohol. On the palate, caramel malts, brown sugar bubblegum, some candied fruit and more of the resinous notes detected in the aroma, hints of acetone. Hmm. Medium bodied with a bit more carbonation than expected. It was good, but not overall what I expect from a barleywine, and I wasn't really sold on it."

"Bomber came from Adam. Big thanks! White wax which I think is a 2011, poured on 12/14/13. Pours a orange brown, a bit murky, with a small yellowish brown head. Aroma is caramel, toffee, orange peel, some more fruits, figs. Flavor is big time malts, toffee, caramel, lots of fig, some orange peel, still some semblance of hops with a little dankness, and more big malty notes. Lots of flavor, and very much on the sweet side. Mouthfeel is chewy but with plenty of carbonation despite the age. This is good stuff, but I don't think it lives up to its name for me unless it is better fresh."

"22 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass; Fall 2011 Ohio bottling with yellow wax. Pours slightly cloudy reddish orange color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big caramel, grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, toast, toffee, raisin, pear, floral, grass, pine, brown sugar, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, caramel, tangerine, toast, floral, brown sugar, raisin, pear, light pine, grass, and floral/toasted earthiness. Light earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, caramel, toast, brown sugar, pear, raisin, floral, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine style. All around great balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering as expected."

"Barleywines are sometimes hard to like because they're so aggressive. This is smooth, sweet, creamy and hot. It's very manageable, not only for the style, but in general. Three Floyds has another hit with this behemoth of a beer."

"very well executed and its holding up well, still has some faint hops shining through and I can only imagine how much enamel this peel off your teeth fresh. Something I'd definitely keep my eye out for in the future both fresh and aged"
"Reveal: Huh? I deservingly got laughed at for being so sure it was not behemoth. I would have given this a 3.75."
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with modest carbonation. As mentioned before, the alcohol is well hidden. I suspect the alcohol would have been pretty strong if I drank this beer fresh. Very nicely made, and i would gladly buy this again if I get the chance."

"o: this is awesome. it's complex and changes with ever sip. 3 Floyd nailed it. I can't wait to see how it ages. the hops here are awesome and it is extremely well balanced. /96"

"orange wax edition, shared with friends, thank goodness. this beast pours a burnt orange color, with lots of yeast sediment and maybe an inch of just off white head. the nose is really sweet, English toffee, dark caramel, brown sugar, and beet sugars as well. there is also a lot of hops, not quite hog heaven level, but this is definitely an American barleywine, with some pine notes and even some tropical fruits emanating from the hopping. the taste is crisp for how sweet it is, and I think the hops do save this beer from being just a sugar bomb. the alcohol is piercing, and the flavors all combine to be like a really good bread pudding. sort of odd in a beer, but I enjoyed the flavors coming together as they did. the feel is a little sluggish. not quite bubbly enough, and the sweetness starts to take hold after half a glass or so. this beer becomes pretty punishing when its warm, but so do most barleywines. I know its the wrong time of year for this, so maybe that had something to do with my dislike of the mouthfeel, but this is a complex and enjoyable beer nevertheless. still waiting to be blown away by three floyds though."

"Overall-I have had barleywines that I like more then this for one reason or the other, but I can't recall one that is this even. I really can't say that enough, it could be because I aged this a little, but the hops are completly even with the malts. Price is a little expensive, but its worth it for this beer, an all night sipper. 4"

"Overall: I am a huge english style barleywine fan but damn does FFF hit the mark on this one. It has their well known hop profile with a candied sweetness in perfect harmony. Love this beer!"
""
""
""
""
"I have had three vintages of this monster. I love love barley wine but the Behemoth seems to stand out compared to the others. It has that signature Floyds taste to it even for being a Barley Wine. Sweet, touch of hoppiness, and goes down very very smooth. I wish that this was a year around beaty"
""
""
""
"Verdict: A good but not great barleywine from Three Floyds. Best when super fresh and with some years on it, but the hops do feel a bit out of place in this brew. An interesting experiment in the American style, but doesn't match the smooth, rich complexity of an English style barleywine."

"I'm a big fan of this beer. The hops are in a great place right now, IMO. However, I think the mouth feel and sweetness will benefit with some age. I just hope the hops stay strong with time, in which case this will be a phenomenal brew!"

"Overall: I finally got to try this one as Hudson got some in. Very good stuff, it does remind me more of a sweet DIPA than a hoppy barleywine, but that's fine by me. Nice and hoppy but not bitter, solid sweetness but not cloying. Tasty stuff."
"D: Pretty easily drinkable for such a big beer. I think some time on it will do wonders... at least I hope so for the $16 a bottle I spent!"

"Easily the best barley wine I have had, but that is more due to the hops than anything else."

I wish i could taste an aged one cause i think itd play out real nice. for the price its definitely a treat but if it was available where i live i might pick up one a year and let it go from there"

"Overall: A really great American style Barleywine. Huge hop taste with some really nice citrus esters. IPA like with the hops but a big enough boozy malt presence to remind you that it is a Barleywine. One of the best in the style."
"this is a decent barleywine, a little bit different from what i was expecting - and VERY booze forward. not bad, and i wouldn't mind seeing how last year's bottle held up."
"Bottom Line: Exceptional barley wine beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I honestly would not know this was a barleywine. Yes, I understand it was the American version. But it really tastes and feels like a Imperial IPA with a small amount of sweet red wine added. Whatever you wanna call it, it did enjoy it - while very sweet, I would recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It drinks almost like an imperial IPA, which is perhaps why I like this so much. I'm really torn between saving the other I have and drinking it soon. Hopefully I can get more so both will be an option! Another win from Three Floyds in my book and certainly worth a try if you can get it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can see why some people who have specific ideas of what a barleywine should be may find this a bit off, but overall, it is still an exceptional beer. Again, will let a couple sit and see, when the hops recede, what other flavors may emerge. Really interesting, well balanced and approachable beer."
"I love a good barleywine, and this one does well. Nice job to FFF."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am not surpirsed Three Floyds would bring the heavy hops in their barley wine. This is my favorite style and I probably prefer the creamy barley over bitter hops but no doubt this is a great representation of the style, just with the classic Three Floyds taste. I've got another bottle that I look forward to sitting on for a while and revisiting this brew in about a year."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The Barleywine style is one that I've recently started seeking out and I've become something of a connoisseur. What you have here is a very good beer and an interesting take on the style. A hop head who has a sweet tooth would definitely enjoy this one. The sheer body of this beer is enough to make any craft beer enthusiast content. If you have access to it and like DIPAs or Barleywines then pull the trigger. Would I drink it again? Yes, I'd age one."
""
"Pours a nearly opaque murky amber color with a big, fat head light caramel head. Mild, sweet toffee on the nose. A bit of dried fruit as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied. Almost creamy. A lot of dried fruit in the flavor. A little bit of alcohol and some bitterness at the finish. Decent. Not great."
""
"Very easy to drink and one of the hoppiest Barleywines I have ever had. It reminds me slightly of Avery Hog Heaven actually. If you can find this pick it up, but it is kinda expensive at $19/bomber."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Hard to believe it's 10.5% ABV. Everything is blended so well. I can't imagine the time and energy it takes to perfect something like this. A very solid brew, but easy to understand why it's a seasonal. I look forward to getting it again next year, and I definitely want to try one of the barrel aged versions at some point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Despite being more of an Imperial IPA, it has rich malts flavors that balance well with the hops. Happy I grabbed a bottle of this. I'm not sure how an aged Behemoth(regular Behemoth) would be. Wish I could try the barrel aged versions."
""
""
"O-One of the few barleywines I had fresh and really liked. Not sure if aging would do this any good."
"O- A very enjoyable barleywine, but could have used more hop bitterness in my opinion. All of the beers by three floyds are great, but this one might be a little better when aged in a bottle. I will have to purchase it at the store and give it another try to see how it compares."
"This is a beer aficionado's must try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I love this beer. It's really fueled my barley wine obsession. Always look forward to when the beer comes out. Love the artwork and of course the wax. "
""
""
"Overall: This beer is really good…the guy at the brew pub said this was one of their more sought after beers and I can see why…Three Floyds do a fantastic job with their citrus hops flavored beers and here they’ve got them playing so nicely with sweet, caramel malts…a hint of the higher ABV, but that’s to be expected from this style and it does add to the overall flavor…it’s superbly drinkable and wonderfully flavored, my only knock is the price tag…I paid $15 for a bomber (total splurge I bought at wholesale, I’m not sure what they’d charge at a store) and while it’s good, I have a hard time recommending anything that expensive…is it good, YEAH…is it worth $15, maybe…but if your like me and occasionally spend for beers typically out of your price range, this is a good experimental choice…(4.25/5)"

"The appearance is a dark amber color. the smell is really fruity. It tastes fruity as well,but you can tell their is a good amount of alcohol in it. Not a real hoppy one, if any at all. nicely carbonated. overall I would and will drink this one again."

"Poured deep gold, almost a tangerine-ish hue adorned with a huge, fluffy white cap, which took forever to diminish. Smell is a jumble of sweetness, like a rich honey type mixed with biscuit and orange blossom. Hugely hoppy towards the back of the palate. Much bitterness with a semi-citrusy/herbal/sprucey quality. Boozy finish. Nicely carbonated."

"Taste: At first it has the floral hoppy bitterness that is similar to an IPA but then it is followed by a sweet almost malty flavor that is really a nice compliment. It finishes with a slight bitterness that is a cross between a roasted and hoppy bitter."
""

"O: Wow -- I'm glad I pulled this one because it was a joy to drink. My cellar is a little on the warm side, so I thought it would be good to take a crack at this guy. I am glad I did -- it is a malty masterpiece with a good dose of bitterness to keep this very drinkable. THe hop nuances are long gone, but that doesn't matter -- this is a superb barleywine. (4.5)"
"M: It's a big medium. Not quite full bodied. It's rather chewy though."
""
""
""
"I know that this beer is incredibly hoppy when it's fresh and almost drinks like a IIPA or IIIPA. After several months, the hops have receded a little and the beer is now drinking like a GREAT barleywine. It is a must-try for fans of American Barleywines. I hope to buy it every year."
""
""
"Pours a hazy copper color with a quick fading 1 finger head that doesn't leave much on the glass. Smell is pretty sweet with fig, fruits and sugar. Plenty of malts also on the nose. Taste is surprisingly bitter. Not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be. Still some alcohol on the palate. Lots of hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is really good. Not nearly as straight forward as most barleywines. I like the hop characteristics which balances the sweetness."
"Smells of heavy pineapples (in syrup), figs, raisins, toffee, mangoes and grapefruit pith, and gooey caramel sauce with medium levels of booziness. You can really tell that this is a heavy malt bomb from the aroma alone. Tastes of medicinal / piney resinous hops over caramel sauce, peaches, and apricots that partially dries up in the finish with some herbal hopping and a rising boozy hotness."

"O: This is a great american style barleywine. Very hoppy, perhaps one of the hoppiest I've had. It's not overly sweet or overly bitter, great balance of flavors with tons of complexity. I'm not sure I could identify all the flavors, myself. Must-have if you're a fan of the style."
""
""
"4, 4, 4, 4, 3.5"
""
""
"Hard to put a finger on this one for me. Sweetness seemed just a little too much."
"This is quite a tasty American Barleywine with some nice complexity in both the malts and hops. This is a fresh bottle, and I bet the malts would get better with age... but the hops may not. So, I guess you have to decide on your priorities."
"Overall: Three Floyds continues to show me that they are masters of big beers. Crazy depth of flavor with some insane hopping to make it even better. Malts are well balanced and big. Get it, drink it, love it."
"Drink- Its flavorful, just not used to the blonde aspect still. I would have an older vintage to see how develops."
"O: definitely a solid barleywine and glad I've had different variations of this great brew"

"Three Floyds Behemoth 2010 vintage, pours an attractive ruby-amber color, and a thin, off-white head casts a good amount of lace. Flowery hop aromas surprised us at first, but upon our second sniff the flowery aromas invited us in with a slight breadiness underneath and a subtle hint of alcohol. The brew starts out sweet with a slight alcohol burn that quickly fades into a delightful hop bitterness before finishing dry. Medium in body, Behemoth is medium-light in carbonation, and not a beer for the week of heart. Wish we had another...."
"Overall this is an awesome barelywine. Huge and complex and wonderful! I don't know how I took this long to try it already when I've had 2 for some time now. Huge thanks to Azdback and whoever else sent me one of these! I apologize for the fact that I can't remember who else sent me one. But the bottom line is that this beer is very good and I'm looking forward to aging my second one for a while, if I can make it that long without drinking it!"
"Overall: Just as good as I remember it, not much difference from the age, still excellent. I would be happy if I could get this beer on a regular basis. Three Floyd's has lost a little bit of fandom from me since I went to DL Day, and their distribution lacks even where they distribute to (sometimes I wonder if they make more than Robert The Bruce), but this is enough to bring me back to their side of the fence. Definitely a sipper, but hell, I'll sip it all night."
"The palate, however, falls rather flat. Heavy on the crystal malt, this is astringent without (thankfully!) too much sweetness. While the astringency does fade as the beer warms up and has time to breathe, it is initially rather unpleasant. This beer is pretty big and sweet. The hops have faded gracefully, leaving some mild pine bitterness and some citrus fruitiness. The mid-palate has plenty of fruit, with red delicious apples, a little grape, Alcohol does appear on the finish, mildly warming. Full in body, this is soft and lush on the palate. The finish has crystal malt and a mild bitterness. Decent stuff. The alcohol is rather well-hidden IMO. However, there just isn't enough malt complexity to keep this interesting on the palate, nor is it worthy of time in a cellar IMO."

"Overall - God, this really is closer to a ipa then any barleywine ive ever had. Makes me wish i had a bottle or two to age to see waht this becomes in a couple years. Really tasty, loads of flavor and not overly sweet. Price tag was a bit much so if i ever get the chance, ill grab one bottle and cellar it. Worth a drink for sure."
"OVERALL: An enjoyable beer, but there's not much barleywine about it really. It is too hop forward and lacks a big enough malt base to put it in this style classification. Perhaps a couple years of age will do this one some good, but fresh, it's simply another hop bomb of a DIPA. This makes scoring it a tough task, as it was a really nice beer, but was also mislabled. Anyways, this is a beer I'd gladly drink in mass quantities, but not if I'm in the mood for a barleywine. Thanks for the cool beer Irishgurl4. Despite the score, I really enjoyed this one."

""
"O: Even after 4 years the hops are still going strong, although the age has smoothed things out, getting rid of most of the bitterness to let the sweetness come out. Good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to age it."

"O- Awesome barleywine, A big feel and a big flavor. Another winner from 3F."
"o - this is a nice barleywine, kind of like a bigfoot lite to me. as a fan of barleywines, i've always dug it. the 2 years on this one doesn't seem to have harmed it, but i remember enjoying it more fresh. none-the-less a worthy barleywine from a worthy brewery."

"This is a medium boded brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is a bold sipper of a brew but overall is pretty well put together for an american style barleywine. Fans of brutal DIPAs will find love in this offering. Worth a try for sure."
""
"O. A solid barleywine, but needs some age to cool off the booze factor a bit. Definitely hop forward, with a lot of spicy, bitter characteristics. It's tempered, however, with the traditional ripe fruit and caramel notes. Pretty good stuff here."

"Overall, this was a great american barley wine. A little different per FFF's usual antics, definitely a little over hyped but still very good."

"Overall an exquisitely well balanced Barleywine with a nice fruity alcohol presence and a big dose of hops..."

"The best way I can put it: a creamier fresh Bigfoot."

"OVERALL: This is a great Barleywine, but I do have to say I enjoyed the 2011 a bit more (and I did consume it back then as well). This year's offering seemed more boozy and hoppy, neither of which is a bad thing, but I just remember last year's batch going down very, very easy. I know I'll buy this again, but at $18.99 a bomber, it is tough to justify more than a bottle or two."
""
"O: It's pretty straightforward American Barleywine (on the sweet side); more or less what I'd expect, but I usually look to 3F to defy expectations, so in that sense a little disappointing. Still, very glad I got to try it."
""
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. Time has done this beer really well - I was surprised to still get a little kick from the hops which worked really well with the rest of the profile. I definitely want more of this."
""
""
"It's a top notch barleywine. It's on the hoppy side, but still well balanced."

"Pours a murky honey orange with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, brown sugar, and alcohol. Taste is the same with a nice citrus zest flavor. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barleywine with some nice citrusy aromas and flavors."
""
"O - Per the side of the bottle: ""it's not normal."" What a great barleywine! There could be a blurring of the lines between an American barleywine & a DIPA. It's not overly complex but, there's not a whole lot of things taking away from this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: the light malt base made it more of a bitter, slightly dark IPA. Great beer, and I'd love to keep one for a few years to see what happens."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark amber color with an off white head that has some large bubbles to it as well as the small ones. Takes a few minutes for the head to disappear which is about right. In the smell I get the normal hop characteristics of all FFF beers, which makes for an amazing smell, odd to get in a barley wine but this is FFF after all. After the hops I get a deep and profound sweetness throughout. The smell is up there as one of the most pleasant smelling beers out there. Taste wise this beer is very complex. At first you get a very nice smoothness to it, then you get a hit from the hops like a pale ale, and then it finishes with the sweet alcohol ending like most barley wines have. The sweetness and smoothness fade away to leave the hops that everyone knows and loves about FFF beers to linger on the palate for a while. The mouthfeel is very nice and leaves a residue on the inside of the mouth after consuming. Overall this is probably my favorite barley wine I have had and was intending to age this but was told to drink it sooner rather than later as it loses some of the hop characteristic. I would recommend this beer and next time I will pick up 2 and age one."
"O: This is a wonderful brew, above average in every respect. It is so drinkable and dangerous at 10.5% abv. You'll definitely want more than one..."
""
""
"O-- Has to be a hop bomb fresh. Get remnants of the hops but it adds a lot to the beer at this point in time. Scary easy to drink as could drink a bomber of this very quickly."
"Overall this beer is very smooth and well balanced, but not all that complex in my opinion. Price is rather steep but I'm glad at least tried it out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very good, quite hoppy, certainly a well done beer and highly recommendable."
""
"Overall – A decent barleywine, but sure not worth the price. I’d rather get a few Stone Old Guardian’s than this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good American barleywine, but the hops dominate this beer. Would like the malts to come through more. This, like many others recently it seems, flirts with what style it is: American barleywine or DIPA?"
"Overall this is an awesome barley wine and I will drink again and again. Probably my second favorite winter beer."
"O: Very good barleywine. Seems like it has age well in the year its had. Would love to have this with a few years on it."
"M - Medium to full body with a massive chew. Sludgy. Lots of sticky, resiny, tongue-coating hop oils. Light carbonation."
"O - another solid brew from Three Floyds. I was expecting less hops however, but that's nearly crazy talk when thinking FFF. But hey, hops are great and so is this beer. I wouldn't say it's their best offering nor would I say it's the best the barleywine style has to offer. I'm looking forward for this one aged a year or so. Yes I couldn't resist not stashing one back in a cool, dark place. Bottles with wax just beg for some cellaring."
"Overall: Another awesome beer from 3F that is an interesting take on barleywines. Very hop heavy for the style."
""
"O- A pretty tasty barleywine, I just had Boogoop last week and am very impressed with the FFF barleywine collection."
"2011 bottle. Pours a bright and mostly clear orange tinted brown, minimal cap of off white froth gone quickly. Even after a year, the scent is dominated by hops, muted pine and mildly bright citrus lead, backbone brings notes of buttery toffee, light caramel and whiskey. When poured at about 40-45 degrees, the flavor still had a decent hop profile, while the sweetness was light and the malts did not provide much character. As it approached room temperature, flavor blossomed with nice toffee and whiskey notes found in scent, hops still lead the overall profile though. While carbonation was at a nice level, the beer felt a little too light for the style, lacking any sticky or coating texture or even smoothness. Great scent and taste from this hop centric barleywine, body lacking compared to many other true barleywines."
"O. If you see this beer i recommend you try it. Even if you dont share my opinion. Im sure you wont regret it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really fits more with a DIPA to me. As with everything FFF they aren't stingy with the hops. Lighter mouthfeel than most barleywines. I like it, but it's not traditional. I'd prefer a bit more citrus hop otherwise very tasty even if it really isn't a traditional BW."
""
"The really impressive part of this beer is how it manages to balance these light flavors and strong finish without overpowering either."
""
"Just had this beer on draft in the Oregon District in Dayton, Ohio. One of my top 5 favorite beers! The most hoppy barleywine ever! Really reminds me of the Dreadnaught from the same brewery. Very smooth barleywine without the overpowering alcohol finish. Three Floyds is one of my favorite brewers and i look forward to trying all of their creations! Cheers"
"Overall: Really a good beer. I enjoyed it. I have had it out of the bottle but on tap is just a bit better. I recommend it to anyone."
""
"O: Drinkable! Each sip kept me interested, which can be a problem with heavy/high-alcohol beers sometimes. The more beer I drink, the more I feel that this is a hop-forward brewery, with a hop-forward agenda…and I love it!"
""
"This is not a typical barleywine. It's more like a double IPA, but it's very good if you're a hophead. If not, stay far away from this one."
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Overall, great beast of a brew that packs a fruity and malty punch."
""
"Cost: $16.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
""
""
"Taste is fruity and hop-flavor forward. Bitterness is actually fairly tame and malts are brighter than I intially thought from the nose. More caramel and sugary than earthy. Its good, I think this one is tasty fresh, not sure what would happen to it in the cellar."
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer, but needs some time for the alcohol to mellow. I've enjoyed less expensive barleywines more. I was hoping for more complexity."
""
"At around 17-18 after tax this is a stiff hard to swallow price on a beer. That said this is really really good beer, maybe even pushing great. Drop the price to 14-15 and this is a winner. That said this once again showcases the amazing hops and malt flavors that all three floyds beers beers have. I'm not sure what they are doing, but from pride and joy all the way up to Behmonth the amazing hop and malt flavors stay unquestionably theirs. I feel the price requires a full pint off the overall score."
""
""
""
""
"O - Really impressed. I will be looking for this beer in the future. This is the barleywine that makes me like barleywines!(though it is quite expensive!)"
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer goes down really well with a great, mellowed out taste. I haven't had it fresh with a hop presence but this is extremely nice as it is. A very good winter brew and my favorite barleywine to date."
""
""
""
"Palate is citrus heavy and pretty bitter, with a fairly dry and light malt backbone for a 12.5% beer. Some nice tropical fruit undertones, light sugary pale malt. Ends like a DIPA with a big bitter hop bite. I've had this before aged and didn't care for it, but fresh it's rather delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love barleywines, but American barleywines are sometimes a bit hoppier than I'd like. I'd held onto this one for several months, hoping it might tone the hop bitterness down a bit. Well, whether the time in the bottle helped make this one that much better, or it was really a stellar one to begin with, the beer I tasted was one hell of a barleywine! Get this one if you can!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a nice surprise from Three Floyds, and fortunately this doesn't suffer the sugar-overload that their other waxed creation, Dark Lord, exhibits fresh. A nice balance of malts, fruitiness and sweetness was achieved here, and putting the ""Blonde"" twist on the style was welcomed here."
""
""
""
""
"2009 Vintage. Pours an orangish-amber color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent is quite interesting. Sweet oak aromas with some bready malt character and vanilla. Some bright fruits, along with brown sugar and honey. Taste is just as it smells/ Lovely honey and bread-like malt flavors with delicious oak. Sweet fruits with just a hint of booze and vanilla. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a crisp finish. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this is a very delightful barleywine."
"Overall: A tasty barly wine, very bready, not very complex, very drinkable."
""
"Overall the 2011 is really quite nice; a complex sipper. It could be aged a bit longer, but I'm not sure if I'd go as far as next winter - and I'm not sure how much it would change by the end of this. Glad I opened it, now on to sitting here and enjoying it!"
"O: Another solid brew from my favorite Indiana brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty fantastic American barleywine. I like English better but this is great for the style. I bet bourbon or brandy barrels would make this very interesting!"
""
""
""
"Amber orange, small amount of beige head. Still a good amount of pungent hops. Typical sweet and sour aroma. Flavors are mellow. Mild bitterness from the hops and good amount of sweetness from the malt. The booze is well hidden. Mild carbonation. Decent American barley wine."

"4.0 D: Good, hoppy barleywine. At $16 per bottle, this is a very rare treat at best, but I'm still going to buy a bottle for the cellar. I'm quite curious to see what happens when the hops fade."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed this one. I hope to get a few bottles of the next batch to hold on to for a while."
"O - Very nice barleywine - well balanced and very complex. There are multiple layers of hop and malt flavors here - sweet and bitter playing off of each other quite well. Haven't had the opportunity to try this one fresh, but seems to be aging well...balance is great - still plenty of hops without dominating and the layers of different sugary flavors are really nice. Glad I have another bottle of this still sitting in the cellar."

""

"O: This had some really interesting flavors dancing around in it, but it's so boozy that it's drinkability is affected. With a few years in the cellar to mellow out i think this beer will be incredible"

"2008 vintage shared by Dave Guay - I've been wanting to try this one for a while. Pours the color and clarity of cider - no volume to the head; just a soapy skim and a thin band around the shoulders. Aromas of malt, prunes, bready, sugared fruit and ethanol comprise the nose. Taste follows nose with the addition of a little medicinal bitterness towards the finish. All and all - not as sweet as suggested by the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with an easy carbonation and a trace of acidity at the finish. Overall, this beer is really quite solid, but I do think it has a great deal more aging potential. I'd love to see this with another three years on it."
"O: This is very well made and very enjoyable. Complex and balanced."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall: A very nice barley wine opened at a good time. Any earlier and it would have been too hot. Any later and it would have been too thin."
"O- I'm typically not a fan of barleywines as they tend to be a little bit too sweet for me. However, this was a fantastic barleywine that is very hop forward, but what else would you expect from FFF."
"11/4/11 Just drank a bottle of Behemoth that I brought home from 3F and love it even more. Really has move to the top of my list for favorite barleywines along with Stone OG. Great beer and a must try if you get a chance."
"Overall - A very solid barleywine here. Incredibly balanced between hops and malt, perfect for a chilly evening. Very good beer by FFF"
"Would love to try this after a few years, will definitely be finding a bottle to try after aging."
"A really nice American Barleywine. This one is done up how I like em. I guess my tastes are trained to really enjoy something like this. I'm not sure how the Barrel Aged version would turn out. I'm inclined to say that this beer wouldn't be a candidate for the charred and oaky flavors of bourbon barrels. Also, at this point I'd also guess that a fresher bottle of this would be better, that tropical fruitiness is this beer's selling point at this juncture. We have nearly a whole vertical lined up so I'll make that call soon."
"And the lacing! This isn’t rings of foam, it’s coating the entire glass."
"Cheers."
"Deuce to tulip. Appearance (the most arbitrary category) is good; deep amber with little head. Smell is great for a barleywine. Probably the best bouquet of any unadulterated version (excludes barrel-aged BWs). Tastes great too. Everything you'd expect from a 3 Floyds brew. Alcohol is present, but that's not a bad thing. Mouthfeel is good. While I don't subtract points from the heat of the abv in the taste category, it cost them slightly in mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great beer - that I won't be drinking too often because of the $17/bomber price."
"I enjoyed the caramel of this barleywine, this is everything that I enjoy about barleywines without the intense sweetness that some examples of this style have."
"Overall, Behemoth is more basic than I anticipated, but still a satisfying sipper nonetheless. Despite the claims that this beer is a monstrous complex blast of humulus lupulus, our fresh bottle was quite tame, and about as hoppy as most aged US barleywines. I enjoyed contemplating this tasty and well-constructed beer; however, don't go into it expecting a hop bomb."
"SkÅL!"
"Overall, a great brew. Probably not worth the $17 price tag, but still a great brew that is worth picking up at least once."
"O - Overall, I think this is an excellent barleywine. Can't wait to see what a couple years of age does to this one. Still have yet to be disappointed by FFF."
"Overall: another exceptional beer by Three Floyds. I'm not sure how true to the style this one is, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I'm certainly going to pick up a bottle if I happen to spot this on the shelves somewhere."
"O - Overall very powerful brew. I prefer this one with some age on it."
"O: This is very hopped up and very sweet, but it is still good and I enjoyed it a lot more than I remember."
"The body is a hazy copper to the point of being opaque with orange hues around the edges of the glass. About an inch of foamy, tan head grows before receding quickly to a patch of bubbles that remains throughout the drink. Smells of hazelnut, caramel, malt, faint wheat and rye, and dark fruits. Tastes similar, with an emphasis on the hazelnut, malts, wheat, and an almost woody taste; initial thoughts suggest a gin barrel, as there are some piney/juniper undertones. Sugar and straw flavors finish this beer. Mouth is smooth and crisp, held together by a dry caramel finish. Overall, a great beer with just the right amount of age on it; I would love to have this again."
"Wish the BA version wasn't complete unobtanium."
"O: I have three more of these in various vintage years. Now what?"
"A hint of alcohol in the mix, detracts just a little from the mouthfeel, but it is not overpowering. Might be the best barleywine I've ever had. Will do my best to grab a couple more these and age. I expect it will only get better."
"O: Decent but not my favorite"
"O- Excellent beer. Three Floyds, you have done it again. Very good drinkability given the abv."
"An IPA barleywine, a nice twist on the barlywine style. Only complaint is a it's a little too sweet."
"O: at this point I feel that 3 Floyds can do no wrong, a nice barleywine with 3 Floyds trademark hoppy flavor, would like to try different vintages and see how this changes with age"
"2/19/2011"
"The mouthfeel is a tad thin for a beer this big; I was expecting something a bit more lush and full-bodied, but it seems a little wan. That said, this is a very impressive barleywine, and one I would readily pick up if it were distributed here."
"Overall, this is a really good beer; not the best barleywine I have ever had but extremely complex and delicious despite the 3+ years of age. I usually only like a year or 2 max on this style but this is still more than acceptable; no deterioration/oxidation what-so-ever. Recommended to sample at least once in your beer drinking lifetime; one fresh/one aged. I have had the aged one now so now I have to have acquire/sample one fresh."
"-GFunk"
"Overall this is a great barley wine and I can't wait to have it after it has 2-3 years on it. Its a must have, go get some."
"I don't know if i have any right to review this beer. I can't describe it properly. This beer smells, and tastes like the best candy you've ever had. Can't place any of the flavors or smells. Awesome sipper. Full mouthfeel, can't kill this quickly. Not nearly as sweet as I was expecting. ABV is noticeable, but not over powering to the rest of the beer. Overall, this is amazing. Totally blown away. Sorry I couldn't do it any justice in my description, it just tates like liquid candy, thats the best I can do. Beautiful beer."
"O: This beer screams to be aged. Fresh it's so aggressive and over the top. Sit on it a few years and then enjoy. 2/5"
"On tap at the UChicago Pub in May 2011. My goblet was a deep amber, translucent at the bottom of the glass and becoming darker up towards the one finger white head. This beer quite wowed me--a really pleasant sweetness of melon, peach, and grapefruit, caramel malts, and a nice bitter herbal/citric hoppiness balancing that. I was glad that this wasn't just a hop assault, but rather deliciousness in a glass, with a filling mouthfeel that finishes very dry. A very well balanced, well crafted American barleywine."
"This barleywine’s got big flavors, but it’s lacking in complexity. It’s good stuff, though a year or two in the cellar would go a long way toward smoothing the alcohol out."
"Overall, I like this beer a good deal. It didn't wow me in any category, but it's such a well put-together American barleywine, bitter but not to distraction, that I have to rate it higher overall than each of the individual parts."
" This is a great barleywine fresh or with a couple years of age on it. For me a world class brew."
"Nice barleywine. Very thick, barely off-white head. Not as hoppy as expected from a 3Fs beer but that is a bonus in this case. This was a 2009 bottle and it would have aged several more years, IMO. I'm thinking about trying to procure some verticals. Overall, worth a $4$ trade if you find some and older vintages should do well."
"Poured as a really pretty amber color, nice lacing, thin white head. Candied sugar and hops on the nose, makes this beer smell great! Taste of sweet malts and lots of hops. Nicely balanced barley wine. Dry mouthfeel not overly heavy which is surprising for the amount of flavor this has. Overall this was probably my favorite beer I had while I was visiting the brewpub there."
"On tap at FFF BrewPub. Sweet malt with some citrus aftertaste. The alcohol really shows itself here in this beer. Beer is very smooth, needs to be sipped. Not the best barley wine i've had, but enjoyable. I have had the 2008 version, and it is better then the on tap one."
"Highly drinkable. Overall, remarkably mellow brew for a 10.5% BW. Nothing here to scare away a barleywine newbi. Might be a good recommendation as a craft lovers first steps into the style."
"Loved this barleywine. I've had too many barleywines that I've felt are overly sweet. 17.99 is a little pricey for this bomber but definitely worth purchasing to treat a friend."
"To think that I've bought many bottles of this for others but this is my first. This bottle was shared with zep9865, '08 vintage, purple wax. It poured a cherry wood in color with a light off white head that laced the glass. The aromas are very sweet. There is a nice mixture of sweet malt, cherries, candied fruit, and it has a resinous hop aroma that I definitely dig. There is a light alcohol aroma present on the back end. The flavors are very sweet fruits initially. It's almost syrupy. It reminds me of toffee a toffee and citrus blend which is definitely interesting but still flavorful and tasty. That resinous factor comes into play again and the hops come alive. It is a little sweet but that should be expected of a barleywine that is roughly three years and three months old. It's a little sticky on the palate but is a fine drink. This is a top notch barleywine and a fun beer to try aged."
"O: Really crosses the border between what a Barleywine and a DIPA should be. Much thicker, sweeter and malt forward than your typical DIPA, but still in the same territory."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, dark fruit, malty, and a small alcohol presence. In the taste, dryness of brown sugar, hints of fruit and a mix of pine and citrus hops. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine and hint of citrus in the aftertaste. Not as boozy as I thought it would be and a nice hop presence."
"Update : just had a bottel behemoth 22 oz 2008 purple wax , this one is sweeter , little bit of hops are stil present , low but enough carbonation , nice white head , nice lacing , very good !!"
"O: All in all this is a nice off-shoot to the Barleywine family, not a true American, too hoppy for English, and no where near a wheatwine. Behemoth creates a style in its own. Very nice."
"When I think of barleywines I envision a dark ruby beer that is rich in malts and sweetness. Behemoth 2011 is almost the anti barleywine (in a good way). First, It has a lighter complexion with a hoppy nose that peaks the drinkers curiosity. Upon the first taste, it seems more like a double ipa than a barleywine. With an abv of 10.5%, Behemoth is very smooth and drinkable. The mouthfeel is exceptional, exactly what a barleywine should be; rich and expansive. Behemoth's finish is extraordinarily barleywie. Complex with a great sweetness and very malty. 3 floyds has once again impressed with their ability to re-invent expectation. Enjoy responsibly!"
"This Barley wine is characteristically different, mostly because it has a very hoppy nose. This is a beer that is very enjoyable and definitely a conversation piece. Immediately by its nose, one would not think of it as a Barley Wine but a sweet hoppy pale ale or high abv IPA. The color is darker than a standard Blonde but carries with it a much lighter complexion than a standard Barley Wine. The nose is sweet and full of aroma. The taste and mouth feel are thick and full of robust sweetness and hops. The finish is strong but there is not much length but it leaves you with wanting more. This is a Beer that is enjoyable and surprising to the taste buds."
"O- Overall this has not changed much in the past 3 years. It has mellowed a touch, but not TONS considering the amount of time. It is a very drinkable barleywine, especially for the alcohol content. It lacks the overall intensity and excitement I like to see in my barleywines. A bit boring. It does not have the complexity I like to see either. I would not pass this up if offered to me because it is a decent beer, but I would not SEEK this one out again. I liked this a little more fresh."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. Well balanced, surprisingly drinkable, and quite enjoyable."
"This was a very nice barelywine, though I would like to see what this would be like with just a bit more age to mellow the hops and booziness out just a tad more."
"Drink and Overall: Very drinkable. Like I previously mentioned, one of the best straight barley wine styles I have encountered. Highly drinkable, not overly sticky, and the ABV is not overly present."
"This is a world class barleywine. Great to try, but it is a pricy one!"
"2010 vintage. Chilled, but let this one warm up a bit. Color is a mix of deep amber red mixed with apricot. Light carbonation with minimal head, but persists. Great earthy hop presence in the nose, a hallmark of 3 Floyds. Also dried fruit, toasted malts, but the hops do it for me. Full palate, like jello. Extremely well-rounded and smooth - dried fruit, toasted malt, and wood. Finishes dry with earthy/piney hops that linger. Some alcohol presence, but not in the taste. For me the hop presence definitely edges other barley wines I've tried. Now its time to pick up another bottle and let it sit for a few years!"
"D: Pretty good, but strong. I'd try again and order another, but have mixed feelings about buying a 22 for $15."
"Overall- This is the first time I have tried this beer, and it happens to be the first Barleywine I have enjoyed. Maybe my palate is finally accepting to the style after not trying one for a few months. They used to be palate overload; going to have to go back and try some of the cheaper and more attainable options again!"
"Overall an excellent aroma but the flavor is just above average."
"sent down by dirts - been hanging on to this one for awhile now"
"Wow, count me impressed by Behemoth. It is eminently drinkable for a huge beer. How is it so sweet at first, but so dry at the end? I could have a few of these (and probably hurt a lot afterward). This is perhaps the best Barleywine that I've had. I really love Three Floyds' beers."
"D-I wish this were a little maltier, though regardless of the declared style, this is an expertly balanced beer."
"D: The beer is okay. The alcohol is poorly concealed. I'm disappointed. Too sweet for a fresh Barleywine. I can see why many enjoy the beer (presuming those who like this also find Hopslam and TwoHearted, Pliny to be the best of the best out there - sweet). Can't say it's for me though."
"sound: Nortt - Til Gravens Vi"
"This was the first beer I imbibed at the brewpub after a long road trip from Traverse City, MI. It turned out to be a great first choice and I feel lucky we got to try it since they were sold out of bottles and the waitress said this was some of the last of this year's production. It really blew me away with its aromas, flavors and wonderful mouthfeel and found it to be quite drinkable. I really hope I can get my hands on some again next you to compare."
"excellent but needing a few years from the current vintage (2011)"
"I was lucky enough to get one bottle of this, but I really wish I could get it fresh in all of its hop glory."
"D= Drinkablity is really good, It is a pretty high dollar bottle but it's a nice beer to try going to get a few more to age."
"D. Seems more like an aged DIPA to me. I'm not a huge fan of American barleywines, but I thought a year of age (or more) would really help round this out. I've got a 2008 still aging so that'll be the final test for this beer."
"I could drink this beer more...$9.50 for 32oz for a growler is much more doable than $16.99 for 22oz. That's a bit steep for my everyday drinker and does affect my rating. This is the first time I've seen it on tap and if it does show up again I may be able to handle $0.30 an oz rather than $0.77. Overall another quality offering from FFF"
"This is a great beer. I love it fresh with the hops really potent. In my experience, this beer is best fresh, or after 2 years. It has a ""dumb phase"" in between that I don't care for as much."
"M/D Easily drinkable, very sweet and not as much alcohol as I expected there to be. A tasty brew."
"drinkable - sure, as long as you're sitting on a stool for a while."
"2010 bottle (green wax). Poured from a bomber into a dimpled mug. Deep, slightly hazed amber pour with a thin and creamy beige cap. The aroma drips with fruitiness - from mango, to peaches, to apricot, to pear. Also in the nose, bready caramel malts some alcohol, and a massive amount of hops. But it is the tropical fruit note that makes this really special! Taste includes loads of fresh tropical fruit like mango, melon, and other fruits, piney bitter hops balance perfectly, and lead to sweet caramel towards the finish, with the alcohol not all that detectable. Chewy, resiny finish with loads of tropical fruit and lingering bitterness. Creamy full body with soft carbonation throughout. Probably one of the best American barleywines I ever had as I am not a fan of the style. This beer was yet another Three Floyds hallmark in terms of flavor - great aroma, body, use of ""sugar"" in taste, and finish."
"My only other barleywine experience is Bigfoot so I still need to expand my experience in this category. The price would likely prevent me from partaking in this on a regular basis but glad I got a chance to try it. I recommend trying this at least once."
"Again, this is a sipper. Not really what I expected at all when I picked it up. Definitely going to cellar one for awhile and re-visit to see if some of the hops/alcohol fade a bit. Not my favorite, but not bad overall."
"Overall: Kind of disappointed, I feel like this is going to be a lot better if I let it age. I was expecting a little bit more complexity from this beer."
"This beer unlike it's BA counterpart was slightly lighter in color and much clearer being a clearish amber color with a decent white head. The smell of this was strongly of hops on the nose. I'm aware this is to be the case in Am. B-wines, but it's not often hopped to this extent. The beer has lots of citrusy hops on the palate that actually mostly cover up the malty background. Though a caramel like flavor does find it's way though to make it's presence known. There is significant bitterness with this beer, heck I've had IPAs that were less bitter than this. Overall it was balanced enough and drinkable. I must admit this was a very good beer"
"And here our Three Floyds Brewpub Experience comes to an end. Good times had by all, believe you me. This capper pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of glowing off-white foam. I wouldn't go so far as to call this blonde by any stretch, but she's pretty nonetheless. The nose comprises ruby red grapefruit, leek, light-ish pine, and sweet, sweet toffee. The taste does not strive to deviate from this pre-determined path, though the grapefruit is slightly intensified, and some mandarin orange syrup seeps in as well. The body is a heavy-leaning medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a nearly chewy feel. Overall, a solid b-wine that somehow doesn't overdo it on either the hops or the malts. Right on, son."
"Drinkability -- Overall it feels like a bigger, fuller, more malt-complex IIPA from FFF. I like it now and will probably like it more with a little bit of hop fade. Very aggressive American Barleywine."
"O: I was pleasantly surprised, i feel that the age has done this beer a lot of good (though i have never had it fresh), the malt is surprisingly complex for how pale it is and i was expecting it to be much more sweet (I'm glad it is not). Perhaps not worth the cost but good."
"Drinkability: so surprised to like this! Not normally a barleywine fan, but FFF really nailed the style for me. Not hot or tough to drink at all."
" think i'll open another one in a year or two to see how it's changed. :)"
"Drinkability: Yea, I would definitely sip this for a while, it is quite enjoyable. Very sweet and hoppy, so I am intrigued to see how this would age."
"D- For something much sweeter than I typically like, it was an excellent drink. The ABV does creep up on you, but is masked throughout well. Going to have to open up my 2008 to compare here sometime soon! Bought a bottle to age as well."
"Drinkability: Behemoth is a great slow-sipper. I had it on a night after a long day. The weather outside was below freezing. This seemed an appropriate time for the beer. I enjoyed it immensely but I don't see it as an everyday drinker-- it struck me as a terrific ""treat"" beer. Maybe it was the sweetness that prompted such."
"Overall, a decent bwine, but I do want to try this fresh. I imagine it being a lot hoppier. The hops do seem a bit faded."
"2009 vintage generously shared by Andrewinski1. Poured into a tulip. Clear amber body with about a finger of off white head that dies down leaving sticky lace along the glass. Really fruity nose, really reminds me of strawberries mixed with dark fruits. Malty notes and carmel undertones round out a sweet aroma. Good deep malt flavors on this one. Musty cellar flavors supported by dark rich fruits and carmel notes. The mouthfeel is good. Enjoyable full body on this guy and carbonation is great, it's a bit hot though. I'm digging this, but it's a bit boozy. I don't mind sipping on this guy though."
"This one exceeded my expectations. Might have to seek out another bottle some time."
"The leadoff here is alcohol and sweetness giving way in the midpalate to the pine hops. The hops are strong in flavor and force the palate to experience them, burying the alcohol significantly. I suppose this is one strategy to cover up alcohol, I wonder how this ages."
"D: Best enjoyed in small quantities, this is a great bottle to share a few ways."
"Yellow wax. 2007. Dark brown with some caramel coloring when held up to the light. 1/2"" cream colored head with some yellow in it. Kind of looks like the wax on the bottle. Smells of raisins, toast and just the faintest hint of pine. Rich and complex flavors of raisin bread, caramel, touch of alcohol, molassas, and piney hops. Kind of has a spicy finish. I really like how this beers flavors just linger awhile. Thick mouthfeel with some kick yet still smooth. For a barleywine this is incredibily drinkable. Nice to sit and sip at the fireplace while watching a good movie."
"Great version of an American barleywine."
"2009 bottle poured into snifter is a bright orange with reddish hues, small off white head with decent retention and lacing. Smells of toffee, caramel, fruity hops, fresh butter, overall pretty subtle. Tastes like biscuit malts, a sharp hop bitterness, a bit roasty, some alcohol, dried fruits, slightly herbal finish. Heavy body with a light carbonation, slightly coating. Drinkability is good, but there is enough alcohol heat in the finish that takes some points away. Overall a very tasty beer, I would like to try one with 3 or more years on it."
"D. Very easy drinking barleywine. Very sweet though. Maybe a touch too sweet for my liking. I could actually use a litte more hops to balance out some of that sweetness."
"D: Damn fine barleywine in my book. I've never had this fresh, but after 1+ years of aging it tastes delicious. Alcohol was not much of an issue, but I did split the bottle"
"D - I really enjoyed this Barleywine for the surprising balance. ABV is higher but still very good beer. This is by far my favorite AB out there."
"Solid offering from Three Floyd's. While there are many attributes that can be enjoyed the one worth talking about is the alcohol. At 12.5% the booze is almost nonexistent. There is no doubt age helped mellow the flavors out but a certainly level of craftsmanship is needed to produce a product such as this. Tremendously drinkable given the abv. Behemoth is not on the top of my list of beers to try again but I will certainly seek it out in the future."
"Her heft is striking, her balance insufferable. She is my warrior princess (of the Midwest)."
"D - Drink it? Okay. Buy it? Perhaps at a deep discount..."
"pretty good, even for it being high in alcohol. only thing setting it back would be the price. i will definitely grab this again however. would like to try it fresh from the tap at the brewpub as well."
"D: Althought I enjoyed this beer, I would say on the drinkability it was very average. I don't think this is the most amazing barelywine, but definitely worth a try. Smooth & easy to drink, but a little more bitter then expected."
"Very nice.. just a little expensive."
"Mouthfeel is relatively light for a 12.5 Barleywine, although it is a blonde which would counteract any thickness you might be expecting. Very light on carbonation, nearly flat, but still pretty good. Very smooth going down"
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Not great, but good. Don't bother hunting, but ok to try if you like a hoppy barleywine."
"D- I think this beer is at its prime. Time to drink up if you have this color wax. Wish I had a couple more to be honest. A nice mellowed out American Barleywine."
"Pours a golden red/amber with about 2-3 fingers of head which dies pretty quickly. Great lacing and a perfect amount of carb for this style. Smells are sweet caramel malts, slight hop, brown sugar and some raisins. Tastes sweet at front with some earthy tones, dark fruit, hops at the end then a sweet caramel/toffee finish. Wow, this is amazing. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy, good carb, feels great to me. Drinkability is very high for a barleywine, but then again I love barleywines. I really wish i would have picked up a case of this when I saw it on sale for $13/bottle. This beer is aces!"
"Taste: Light caramel sweetness forms a base, shifting towards toffee and burnt sugar in the finish. Cherry flashes in and out, adding some dimension. Alcohol is surprisingly restrained for such a big gal, but it certainly does flex, warming and fruitiness. Faded hops are more assertive than one would guess from the aroma, providing a low to moderate bitterness that makes itself apparent in the finish, which, coupled with the bittersweet dark caramel flavors provide some semblance of balance."
"Bottle. 2008 release. Nice, sweet malty backbone with sugary notes of caramel and some hint of fruity, citrus hops. This barley wine is so well balanced in my opinion. The alcohol is just barely traceable, but that doesn't make it any less drinkable. Medium-full body with an oily mouthfeel. Warm and comforting."
"Behemoth is a good barleywine, and I'm happy to have tried it fresh, because I can leave the bottle I have in my cellar for a year or two now."
"Blue wax tasted from 22oz bottle at Lush Roscoe. The pour is clear amber with a fairly thin white head that leaves light lace around the glass. Nose of sweet caramel malt with citrus and herbal hops and some oxidative nuttiness. The hops really take over on the palate leaving the sweetness and malts on the back burner. The body is full with light carbonation and a long caramelized and super hoppy finish."
"In the words of Ron Burgundy, ""It's so damn hot! Barleywine was a bad choice."" So yeah, maybe I didn't pick the best hot and sunny Saturday afternoon to crack this one open, despite that, getting through this bomber wasn't much of a struggle."
"Overall just a super solid and very well put together Bwine. I could have drank this one all day!"
"Had my eye on this one for about 8-9 years now. Patience pays off. It showed up at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee so I nabbed a bottle. Worth the wait."
"Latest ( green wax 2010 ) edition. Poured with a fine, smallish, light tan to cream colored head and a little lace. Color is a clear, copper amber. Aroma isn't too complex - massively malty and hoppy. Flavor is similar which is aka bittersweet. Good body and fine carbonation. Fairly long finish that is like flavor. Despite massiveness and strength (don't really pick up much alcohol) of this beer, could almost qualify it as a session."
"On tap at Three Floyds on 7/21/09. Pours gold with beautiful frothy eggshell head. Super citrusy hops aroma with a touch of caramel. Nice sweetness up front followed by a solid bitterness. Medium body with okay carb. Good bitter finish with a little touch of caramel on the tongue. Incredible american barley wine."
"Three Floyds produces nothing less than outstanding beers and this offering merely reaffirms my love for their products. If there is a barleywine out there better then this one, I have yet to try it."
"D: 10% isn't crazy huge but the beer goes down pretty well. there really isnt an alcohol impact with this beer. the taste is so big with hops it doesn't even allow the alcohol to appear."
"nice flavor, great body, but the price and ABV kill this a bit. i would buy this again though, id love to try it fresh."
"Overall a very good b-wine...sweet and hoppy but neither are overwhelming. Although I like American my b-wines hoppy this is what I expected aged. I think this would be a fun vertical to do although at $18.99 for a bomber I'm not sure I can justify buying anymore than 1/year."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderately low. It has a bit of a silky and creamy feel to it as well. The drinkability is decent, it had some very nice malty flavors to it. The alcohol hurts the drinkability a bit but but not too bad. Overall I liked it a lot."
"d - Very drinkable for a high ABV barleywine. I thought the alcohol was hidden well and really enjoyed the smooth caramel malts. Would be interested to see how it ages as well."
"Would be curious to see how well this one ages. In any event, even as a baby, this is a very impressive and enjoyable beer."
"This is beer No. 1499. The beer pours red-amber with a medium off-white head. The aroma is caramel malt and citrus hops. The flavor is caramel malt with a nice mix of orange and piney hops. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. A very nice barleywine."
"08 vintage poured at a recent BA tasting event. Pours a cloudy dark orange. Nose is very sweet, caramel, and a touch of pine hops. Taste is candy malts, brown sugar, caramel, and a nice resinous hop presence, more than Dreadnaught. Mouthfeel is sticky with a medium body, and a long lingering aftertaste. Solid."
"Pours a mahogany red with a smallish head which completely disappeared. Very light lacing which didn't last. Nose is ripe cherries, bananas and butterscotch. Hoppy start gave way to dark fruit, esp. cherries, banana and butterscotch. It almost tastes like a lighter sherry. There is a little hop bitterness in the dry finish. Some alcohol warming is there, but less that the 12.5% might lead you to expect. The mouthfeel is creamy but light for the style. This was an OK barleywine but not a favorite."
"D= This beer is a homerun. Excellent barlywine that I am really happy I got to try. Well balanced and smooth. Excellent beer that I'll be looking for again."
"D- I want to put some time into the next one of these I try. This was still pretty hot and it took away from the flavor profiles. I shared this one and my half was all I really cared to drink. It was good, but a cpl years would do this one wonders!"
"Not really a drinkable beer but hey it's a barleywine although it goes down smooth I would suggest you sip this one and possibly even share it with a friend."
"Overall this was a very well-crafted American Barleywine and I look forward to trying this again. Thanks Clint! Recommended."
"It wasn't until somewhere in the second glass that the flavor score was awarded with its current perch. Warming brings out a few subtleties that weren't present right out of the chute. In the end, Behemoth Blonde Barleywine is another masterpiece from the hugely talented brewmasters at Three Floyds. An asking price of $15.99 is pretty steep. That doesn't mean that I won't continue to buy at least one bottle from every release."
"D - Warm alcohol and massive malts with a somewhat balanced finish. A bit warm and powerful though. Best shared with someone and sipped on a cold day."
"The '09 was hands down the best. This one doesn't seem to age well and really just dives off the cliff after a couple years. I really enjoyed the '09 thought. This is similar to Big Foot at first with lots of hops and bitterness to add to the nice Barleywine sweet maltiness, but doesn't age like BigFoot, instead just stinks up the place. I'll do my grading based off the '09 version as it is fresh and tasted the best."
"2009 vintage. This poured a nearly clear dark gold with a bit of light tan head. It smelled like toffee and butterscotch and succulent orange, with pineapple and a bit of bready yeast and alcohol. It tasted like orange and candied pineapple and toffee, with some grapefruit and a bit of alcohol. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very nice, clean, and balanced beer. It hid the alcohol decently too, so it was pretty easy to drink. This could definitely improve with age also, but was quite enjoyable fresh. This wasn't quite good enough to claim top spot as my favorite barleywine ever, but it was still excellent."
"Another hit from FFF."
"I love American style barleywines like Old Guardian, Bigfoot, Old Ruffian, Mirror Mirror, Old Horizontal and Old Numbskull just to name a few. Behemoth is a world class addition to the list."
"Bottle from free table at Woodshop 5.0. Pours a clear orange-gold with a thin off-white froth. Aromas of caramel and alcohol, raisins, fruity hops. Flavor is fruity with a lot of caramel and the a bitter homage to the hops that used to be in this beer (I'm guessing it was a vintage bottle). Very full body, sweet and thick and bitter. Good beer."
"Fairly drinkable considering the style"
"This one is probably better fresh. As it is, its not a bad beer, but some more complexity would be appreciated."
"A complex, hoppy, though firm malty, barleywine with a distinct FFF character. One to sip as a long ""nightcap""."
"Pillowy smooth mouthfeel silks round the mouth, ABV no where to be found which is impressive for a 12% beer. Still, can't imagine seeking this out again. Not a terrible or even a bad beer, just that there's other less-diabetes causing beers out there."
"I haven't had this beer fresh yet,now i need to so i have a compareson for this aged one. I'm so glad i have another Yellow Seal in the Cellar! I can't speak for this beer fresh, but go buy some and forget about them for a while."
"This is the best barley wine I've ever tried. This would be amazingly drinkable at any ABV, never mind 12.5%. Ridiculous. I can't wait to get more."
"D- Aging would be great in a bottle but I have to say that I'm very impressed with this beer. Definitely a big beer and one of the best american barleywines I've had. The drinkability isn't perfect due to the high alcohol content BUT the lack of a rubbing alcohol flavor really helps this beer a lot."
"BTW, this is rated at 10% abv at the brewery."
"Taste is amazing, no booze at all on the taste. Its a really solid barleywine. Has a very malty body with a very light hop to it. Worth seeking out."
"This is a classic barleywine,pours a hazy brown goo,a solid 2 finger head that dissipates with some lacing whats left is a butterscotch toffee potion with a solid alcohol kick,it is a tad sweet as it should be,mouthfeel is chewy sweet mostly snickerdoodle cookie richness,I don't consider this beer highly drinkable because of its richness,one is enough for me"
"EDIT: I had the 2009 Behemoth (blue wax) at a tasting in April 2010. I was still underwhelmed. Having the 2007 next to Perfect Storm wasn't the issue. It's just not an upper tier barleywine. Very middle of the pack."
"If you get the chance to make it to DLD make sure you check out the barrel aged incarnations of this as well."
"Drinkability gets knocked a notch only for such a high ABV. other than that this is a fine crafted American BW."
"J"
"2008 bottle, sampled Jan. 2010: This one pours a clear, amber color. There was a couple of fingers of a beige head on mine that dropped away rather quickly. Lots of pine to the nose. Still, an overall sweetness comes to the top. Also fruits (pear), caramel malts and a touch of alcohol. Oooohhh, this is smooth. A nice balance of the bitterness and sweetness. It is a touch sweet to the finish. Caramel, and some pine flavors. Some fruits in there, but in the background. Fairly full bodied. This is really excellent!"
"D- This could certainly use some aging but I liked it a lot. The look kind of threw me off but it really comes together."
"Even mouthfeel, full with moderate carbonation. Very tasty beer, drinkable, but a sipper. Thanks to autumnaldave for this lovely beer from a years-gone-by trade."
"It's big, it has character and its not for everyday, but on thanksgiving it was perfect"
"Sweet aroma, caramel, fruit and a bit of citrus. Pours to a thin head. Aroma is very well balanced of citrus hops, caramel malts, and small sweet notes of alcohol. Leaves some caramel on the palate with a hint of citrus. Nice and creamy, a great sipping beer."
"4.5/4/4.5/4.5/4"
"D-this is actually extremely drinkable, its big and smooth, not bad lingering effects from the alcohol and the high % is well hidden! another awesome beer from three floyds, man i wish I could get their stuff regularly."
"overall - i have had this beer at 2yr 1yr and fresh - all tastings are out of this world and look forward to sipping on my 07 next year at 3years"
"D- Reasonably drinkable. It lets you know the alcohol is there, without being overbearing. A pleasure to put down, but it doesn't leave me calling for more, as some brews do."
"D- What an enjoyable barleywine. The complexity of the taste is surly one of the best I've had of this style. Its so easy drinking and smooth. It's not overly sweet or boozy tasting as the case with many others in this style. I like the approach to the palate."
"D: Quite drinkable, this beer hides the high alcohol content very well, I could drink a number of these and get smashed before I knew it. The only problem lies with the price: at $20 a bomber, I can only drink these when student loans come in the mail. But gosh, would that I could drink these all the time."
"I suspect that this would/could age incredibly well! I plan to get my hands on some more of this! **update** In my opinion, this does not age well at all; best consumed fresh!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good bite of carbonation."
"Despite it's big abv, this is a very nicely done and well balanced beer that is quite easy to drink. I'd love to have more of this."
"Great beer and a must try."
"Pours a beautiful ruby copper with a nice off white head. The smell of glorious hops immediately hits you and you know this is a barleywine of the American variety. The smell fades into some red fruits and sweet malt. The taste goes the same way, with the hops dancing in the forefront behind a pretty good malt base (I only say pretty good, as I'm not a big fan of aged Behemoth--it loses the hops and the malt isn't complex enough, IMO). The mouthfeel is full and lucious, and although this is a sipper, I'm always wanting another."
"My favorite barley wine."
"D- This beer left me wanting more, but the 12% ABV prevents me from this. A definite sipper."
"EDIT: The more I thought about it and the more I drink it this beer reminded of another, Thomas Hardy's. They taste very similar. That's pretty good company."
"Good sip ability on this brew. One glass is enough in a sitting but the glass goes down mighty fine. This is a good American barleywine, worth seeking out in my book"
"Pours a great deep copper color with a nice bit of light coming through; a good bit of head for a barleywine with a nice bit of lacing as well. Great deep malt scent; very sweet with a hint of lighter malt. Great deep taste; horribly malty, thick, and sweet like a good barleywine should be; a tiny bit of hops at the end, but remarkably small for a 3F brew; has a nice hint of lighter malt attributes to make it unique and different. Goes down great for such a high ABV beer, thick and great, with no noticable alcohol. Great barleywine!"
"Behemoth was a tough battle. A fine beer by any one's reckoning, but not one for amateur, which I obviously am. I would love to see some age on this old girl."
"Rotation: one and done on fresh. Would try an aged one. Would try on-tap to see if it differs."
"Overall a pretty decent beer, but one I'd like to see with some age on it. The components of this one definitely need to introduce themselves & get comfy before this one comes together as it seems it should."
"D - The ale is bigger than its bottle, a fantastic barleywine which tastes so good fresh with the hops almost as much of a focal point as the malt and alcohol, a class act with an very smooth drinkability for such a big beer. Well worth the taste, thanks FooFaa!"
"Purple wax edition. Deep amber with a respectable head that faded quickly. Aroma was citrus as first and as Behemoth warmed, it turned to the roasted malt mentioned on the label. In terms of taste, this was a tale of two barleywines too. Cold, it was like an old girlfriend, cold and bitter. After warming up a bit, it was also like an old girlfriend; warm and sweet with the bitterness only a distant remembrance. Mouth feel? No old girlfriend references here. A little oily with a nice body (well, maybe). Drinkability? I'll be back, just not tonight."
"D - Exceptionally good, but like Dark Lord, you're only drinking one of these bad boys."
"D. Goes down great for the abv. Too sweet to drink quickly or a lot of. Very good barley wine"
"Thanks Mike for helping me out with this one. The smell is a tremendous amount of hops woth a sweet malt undertone. Pours cloudy and thick with almost no head. This beer just screams high abv. This is an extremely drinkable barleywine for something so strong. Slightly over-sweet but this is a very slight trait and I'm diggong to find something I don't like. It might be a little overpriced for a beer. But at 12.5% it's a party starter that will do. I'd buy it if it were available without me having to drive a few hours."
"It tastes very smooth, light hoppy taste, smooth light bitter finsih."
"This brew poured a light brown color w/ ruby red accents, and a thin beige head. Lacing hangs on the glass slightly. The nose on this on is of citrus hops, clove, and a touch of banana fruitiness. The taste was of caramel/toffee up front, citrus hops/banana in the middle, and a finish of a touch of alcohol warmth. Drinkability? I could drink this all night if I had access to alot more of it - superbly well balanced American Barleywine and the high ABV is well masked. The mouthfeel on this is a little slick and it lingers on the palate nicely. Overall, this brew shocked me w/ its great balance and well roundedness. Expected this to be the usual over hopped American Barlewine standing on the line of being a DIPA which I usually don't prefer, but that was definately not the case w/ this brew. Excellent work and attention to detail by Three Floyds! This is a must try for any barleywine lover and will be sampling again."
"Blipped ""Fat Bottom Girls"" by Queen"
"Rich copper hazy body with a nice head on top. Great lacing that sticks to the glass. Smell has honey and canned pineapple grape juice and is overall very sweet. Tons of coriander in the taste, with clove, honey and pepper as well. It has a fruit punch character, very sweet. Thick. Coats the mouth with velvety goodness. Well carbonated. Tons of flavor inevitably brings a bit, but overall Behemoth is a truly great beer."
"This is quite possibly the best beer I have ever had. It's amazing. If you like Alpha King, Robert the Bruce, Pride and Joy, Rabbid Rabbit or anyother of their stuff. You will LOVE this."
"Drinkability: At first, I felt that the lack of a heavy body might mean that this was a barleywine that would not age well, the alcohol presence will clearly enable this one to last; very different from most barleywines and it would be interesting to see how this matures; next time I come across a bottle, I plan to lay it down for a few years"
"This is a terrific barley wine. Not fresh, but age has probably done the heat some good, as its super layed back and almost too easy to drink."
"I traded for this one as an afterthought in a big trade, and I am very glad I did. A very nicely balanced barley wine, easy to drink and thoroughly enjoyable."
"D: Very good. It's almost unbelievable to think a beer as potent as this one can be so balanced, it's practically flawless. Rich, powerful and complex, it doesn't get much better than that."
"Pours a hazy crimson into a snifter. Head is slight and bubbly and dies quickly. Some thin strips of lacing stick to the glass. Smells of sweet and tart cherries, figs, deep caramel malts, a damp earthiness and some piney and citrusy hops. More dark fruitiness hits the palate up front with some dark chocolates, more big piny hops, some grain and a squirt of citrus finish things off. A prolific alcohol heat lingers and there's some astringency apparent after a few drinks. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied and a little creamy. Drinkability suffers slightly due to the overabundance of alcohol. There's not a lot going on in the carbonation department. This one pushes the limits in terms of complexity and alcohol, but its failures are definitely outweighed by its successes."
"Pours a medium brown with a silky tan head. Decent lace. Fantastic nose has fresh citrus hops, big malts, caramel, ripe cherries and subtle white wine grapes. Taste is a delectable blend of fruity hops, rich bready malts, carmelized candy, tropical fruit and sweet alcohols. Big, meaty body with a resigny finish. Delicate carbonation compiments the complex flavor profile. Fantastic stuff, needs to try more of FFF's offerings. Maybe I'll seek out one of the goops next."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle shared with psycohops and brothercannon. The bottle is dipped in bubble gum pink wax. Looking at some old reviews indicates this is a 2006 vintage. Poured into a trio of snifters, this barleywine appears a deep apricot color with about two fingers of dense, pillowy light ecru foam. Nose and flavor consists of pineapples, tons of sweet caramely malts, the alcohol isn't really noticeable at this point, but you can still tell it's is quite strong. Notes of prunes, raisins, tart green apples, a hint of dark cherry are also present. Thick, syrupy and full bodied with ample carbonation to match the richness and flavors. We enjoyed this along with a few various sharp cheeses, grapes and apple slices."
"D - The alcohol makes this less drinkable than the taste."
"averaged score"
"That being said, there's so many good things going on here it's ridiculous. Having had this beer many times, I'm almost at fault for celebrating its quirks. Unique and delicious. One of my all-time favorites. And yes, worth the $17 to try (if you still have a job)."
"http://www.youtube.com/user/TheGrandOleHopry1"
"Poured a deep orange, maybe even copper color with a nice tannish head. Nose is sticky with caramel, brown sugar and fruits. Taste follows the nose pretty closely. Mine had an oxidized taste, I believe it was taking a turn for the worst. I did notice dried fruits, caramel, molasses, tobacco. Mouthfeel was nice. The ABV was very well hidden!"
"D--This one must be sipped due to the crazy ABV but the alcohol is disguised very well. A bomber of this is almost perfect and I will definitely return to it in the future, and try some other barleywines in the process."
"Pours a dark amber ruby hue. A less than one finger head comes after the pour, leaing a littl foam throughout all 22 ounces. Fresh cherries soaked in some brandy with some honey drizzled over toasted malts. Starts malty and somewhat sweet. Syrupy light ruits, toasted bread grain soaking in a sort of brandy style malt sangria hits the front to middle of taste. The finish highlights the citrus and mint bitterness that slowly pushes the malt and fruity booze out of the way. The palate is boozey somewhat syrupy and a slow interchange of bitter and fruity."
"A fantastic barley wine. I will be acquiring more of this in the future. It is however overpriced. 14.99 is pretty steep for a bomber."
"Poured a fairly blonde and amber, light amount of head. Smells citrusy and piney with an undercurrent of alcohol and dark fruit? Upon first sip, I'm slammed with the hops. After that intial rush, things mellow out a bit and become more complex. There's a very nice fig sweetness underneath the citrusy hops. There's a definite alcohol afterburn here. This is a very complex beer with lots of thinking to be had. The mouthfeel was very nice, quite thick and smooth on the tongue. While it's nice to get through one of these, there's no way on earth I could have a second in a row. Side note: This is actually closer to a DIPA due to the apparently high IBU's."
"- Exactly. And, hey, for an IIPA I'd just say that I don't like it. For a barleywine... I say that the light fruitiness is not to style."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Has a dry and bitter finish with very light carbonation."
"D- Drink it. I liked it better on tap but the bottles are still good of course."
"On tap at FFFs. Dark orange in appearance. Citrus and carmel nose, a perfect mix of yummy goodness. Tastes just like it smells, carmel/citrus/hoppy. Medium on the mouth, very smooth. This beer is easy to drink but will sneak up on you if you're not careful. Always have a few bombers on-hand while they're available."
"Drinkability: As said above, alcohol is masked very well. Watch out kids! Flavor is deliciously sweet, but not cloying. Enjoy at a slow pace, if your will power permits. EDIT: 20 minutes later, I feel like I've been kicked in the head. Good thing I shared a good portion of this one; I can't imagine how I'd feel if I drank the whole thing."
"Drinkability - a fine example and a great candidate for aging."
"Behemoth is similar to a vintage Barolo: young, it's assertive and fruity, supple and lightly smokey. With a bit of age it becomes warm and mellow. Relative to experience and taste, it can be both dark and intense or soft and silky. It's ultimate appeal is that it can be both big and sophisticated at the same time. That is the beauty of this beer, and barleywines in general."
"D - Pluses include great flavor and well hidden ABV. Negatives are high carbonation, high ABV, and price ($17!!). Drinking a bomber is no problem, but ponying up enough cash for a second one is less likely. I'd love to try the barrel-aged version again and review that."
"Called just Behemoth. The aroma is right for the style as it pertains to american Barley Wines. There is plenty of hops, more than many of the style but not more than seems appropriate. It is both citrusy and Piny. There is also sweet malt and carrot juice. The appearance is perfect for the style with a larger head than many imported Barley Wines. The flavor is like the style with a bitter finish and very well hidden alcohol. The palate is appropriate for the style. Overall it's a good example of the style. Actually it's got some qualities that I wish other would have but I could do without the carrot taste."
"2007 vintage courtesy of Gillard. Pours hazy copper with lasting tan head. The aroma is nice and hoppy with pine hops and fur tree followed by sweet mildly roasty malts and hints of caramel. The taste starts hoppy and earthy and a tad thin. The hops come off as pine, grassy, resiny and earthy bitterness. Wow, lots of hops. By midway the sweet malts peak in intensity but quickly get overtaken by pine and grassy hop bitterness that run right into the after taste. Darn smooth really but would benefit from several more years of aging.2005 vintage. It pours a hue darker than the '06 with an even bolder tan head. The aroma is much more barleywine like with a suitable level of dark fruity esters to break up the once hop dominated nose. I also get a just noticeable caramel note. The taste is richer with a bit more malt caramel notes and dark fruity esters. The hops are still over powering. I think this will be excellent in a couple more years. I now wish I had another bottle."
"FFF, come to Massachusetts for real!!!"
"Review taken from notes on Monday night at Deep Ellum. I was really surprised to see this on, as Three Floyds does not distribute to this area. Appearance is a dark orange, with three fingers of white heading, taking a long time to die down. Smell is of floral hops, but of garlic, mango and other citrus fruits. Gentle flowery hops dominate in the taste, with the malt taking a backseat. Alcohol burn is there in a very mild way. Feel is on the medium side. Drinkability is superb, but after more than one of these, you would definitely be feeling it. As others have commented, this beer really tastes more like an Imperial IPA than a Barleywine. At the same time, sometimes the line between those two styles gets blurred, which isn't a bad thing. So I guess this is just a really hopped up Barleywine. Either way, I wish it was here all the time. Head over to Deep Ellum now and get some while you can. Cheers"
"D - Drinks like a DIPA, with some alcoholic heat."
"overall-this is a monster of a beer, not exactly my favorite american barley wine, party because at times it seemed more like an old ale, but definitely something i want in my weekly winter rotation"
"M/D - Medium bodied with a sticky, resinous feel. For the sttle, this is very high on the drinkability scale. Quite the sipper."
"Behemoth is more a gentle, graceful giant, my new second-favorite American Barleywine. Three Floyds has created a tremendous gem. Nothing short of outstanding."
"I had this in a bottle a few times at the Trion in New Haven, Indiana (Fort Wayne area) and just the other night on draft. I have to agree that this beer is more drinkable on draft, but I really enjoyed it out of the bottle too. I was comparing it with my buddies' HopWallop and HopSlam and definitely thought I made the best decision. It gave me a strong notion of grapefruit, but not so much that it was too sour or bitter. The balance of malt must have knocked that down a bit. It was actually dangerously smooth, I'm sure if I didn't know what I was drinking I could have ordered three or four and ended up on the floor. I'm high on barleywines lately and this is definitely one of the top five I've had. I haven't had a bad 3 Floyd's beer, but this is one of their best. Go out of your way to get this beer."
"Re-review: I have had the opportunity to have this beer on tap a few times now and it is a completely different animal on tap. Much better structure, cleaner and discernible taste profile . . . In short, out of a bottle this beer made almost no sense to me, I liked it, but more for the crazy ride it took my tastebuds on then for actual enjoying it. On tap I could see what kind of crazy genius was working behind the madness and I have a much better appreciation of the beer after having it that way. I could also probalby drink 2 of them from tap in the same night without being reduced to a ball of goo on the floor"
"Thanks to crazynelson for the trade. Poured a slightly hazy reddish-amber with little to no head (which I think is ok for a beer of this strength). Like the other strong, amber beers I've had this one has a strong sweet white bread flavor. The aroma jumps out of the glass in a strong perfume of light carmel, grains, bread crust and honey. That honey continues in the strondy bready malt flavor, which is backed up by a strong spicy/hoppy finish. Thick mouthfeel, but a great beer to share. Certainly worth trying if you get a chance."
"Overall this is one of the better malty barleywines I remember having. Definitely worth a shot."
"D - This is a very good barleywine. I liked the fruity flavors - very unique for the style."
"Simply delicious and I wish Three Floyds would come back to Ohio. Damn good."
"This is a fairly sweet barleywine with a fading hop profile that balances things our very well. For the ABV, it's a crazy drinkable beer. Very tasty."
"Great brew and one of my top rated active bottled beers for the Barley Wine style."
"It's taking all my willpower not to guzzle this stuff. It tastes so good, so complex, yet powerful in almost every respect. If the mouthfeel were a bit fuller it would easily be a 5, even considering how big this beer is. Really an amazing beer, would imagine that age does wonderful things to this beer, but even fresh wouldn't be bad either, just really really intensly hoppy I'm sure."
"8/4/8/4/17 (4.1/5)"
"I had never heard of a blonde barleywine previously. It definitely looks and smells like a barleywine--though the color is a bit lighter, more yellow, and less red than other big barleywines like Bigfoot, Old Guardian, or Old Crustacean. The smell is very sweet and its syrupy viscosity is evident even as it pours from the bottle. The light head dissipates quickly leaving a ring of lace around the edge of the glass. Though I don't notice the hops in the aroma, hops are surprisingly pronounced--spicy and piney--in the front of the taste (less so in the middle and finish). The sweetness of the aroma becomes a candy, molasses syrup flavor. I like syrupy-mouthfeel beers, but this one is too much for me. I like big ol' barleywines, but this one is overwhelming. The bottle says ""It's not normal," and that sums it up pretty well."
"D - For the style, which is friggin HUGE, very drinkable."
"Overall an exceptional Barleywine, and a very good example of the style. Defenitely one to enjoy in the winter, as this fat bitch will knock you on your ass. I think with just a slight tweaking of the recipe, this one could be one of the best out there, and even as it sits, it is one of the better American BWs around for sure. Another good one from FFF. Nice work, and Peace and Love out to joe from chi-town."
"D: A really nice beer. Thanks again to beertracker again for the opportunity to try this beer with a few years on it already. Not what I had in my head but still a really good beer. Definitely enjoyed the 2005 over the 2006. I would say either drink this fresh or give it a few years. The 05 could have gained a bit with some more time on it."
"Pours a reddish orange color, with a quarter inch of yellow foam. No lacing at all, though. Smells strongly of malt, fruit, citrus. Taste is a sweet, malty, flavor, with brown sugar, dried fruit, and hops mixed in. Good solid flavor, but it seems to fade as I work my way through the glass. Carbonation is a bit weak. Actually, it's a fair bit weak, and going flat as I finish the glass. A nice flavor, but lack of carbonation drags down the overall experience."
"Drinkability: This beer suffers from several things, notably a particularly high level of alcohol, though I can't really fault 3Fs for failing to hide it completely - when you're at 12.5%, you're naturally going to get something that sneaks through, and I think they did a fine job with what they had. It's still high, however, which does knock down the drinkability score a few points. The aroma is also somewhat weak, not in pungency as much as in complexity. This beer really shined through later on, however, and I wish many of the complexities of the mouth had been more evident in the nose. The mouthfeel was also perfectly balanced, smooth, creamy, sublime. On the whole, it's a definite winner - a tasty, great-feeling beer that I more than enjoyed while sitting back with some extra-sharp cheddar and studying for my upcoming Federal Tax exam. If I were fortunate enough to live in an area where it were feasible, I'd buy a couple of these to cellar for a year or two - I doubt the hops would suffer to the point where this became unenjoyable, and the estery alcohol might be able to use a little time to cool down. Nonetheless, recommended, fresh or otherwise - a solid brew."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Pleasing flavor and nose, and the booze is fairly subuded which ups the drinkability. Not bad at all."
"i enjoyed this. as did my girlfriend. im not sure i would drink it on a day to day basis but for a special occasion now and then this would suffice."
"2006: Lighter than the 05; more orangey than red. I would have given it a 3.5 on appearance. It is sweet like the 05 but with not as much spice kick as the 05. The body and drinkability are comparable to the 05."
"D-About as drinkable as a 12.5% barleywine can be. A pleasure to drink, not tiring at all on the palate."
"The first overly-hoppy barleywine I ever had. Typical appearance and mellow head for a barleywine. Bushel-load of hops and malt meet to provide a powerful, enjoyable aroma. These work in perfect tandem to provide your tastebuds with one of the most pleasant bludgeonings they probably can hope for. Awesome, powerful stuff! Very balanced mouthfeel - not too thick. Be careful, it's very very very easy to drink like a less-potent style - dangerously good!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, deceptive and very strong kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent high-gravity beer to drink for as long as you are able."
"Pours a deep amber color with big carbonation producing tight little bubbles that dissipate somewhat quickly to leave a medium sized head. Big orange grapefruit aroma with some caramel malt present as well. Initial taste of caramel and toffee that is exceptionally balanced by the huge amount of hops that no doubt went into the brewing of this beer. Short fruity finish. Alcohol very well hidden. Yet another world class beer by Three Floyds! Cheers!"
"Pours hazy dark orange/red with a small 1/16 inch fairly white head. Smells of fruit, alcohol, honey - smells slightly oxidized. Bottled purchased just 4 weeks ago. Fist sip is fruity and thick with apple and pear notes present. Fairly hoppy but I am guessing the hops have mellowed. Very nice, very smooth. A world class American Barley Wine."
"D: Not bad for the style. I was able to put it down after a Duvel and 3 90 Min IPA which says something. Another Solid FFF Brew!"
"Poured a slightly viscous reddish orange with a quite nice head that fades to a thin cap. Smells big and malty up-front, but with quite a bit of citrusy hop flavors on the end to balance it out. Aromas of grapefruit, brown sugar, and sweet bread are predominant. Tastes pretty mellow as far as the heat from the abv goes. More stiff malt with a big, dry minerally backbone, but overlayed by sweet brown sugar and pine and grapefruit flavors from the hops. Relatively mellow in intensity as well and quite smooth. The mouthfeel is mellow and quite creamy with nary a hint of sharp alcohol. A big beer, but smooth and enjoyable."
"D: drinks very easily for a 12.5% brew. One of the better barleywine's I've tried recently....from a bottle. Could drink this again in the same sitting...maybe 2-3 bombers worth, after that not sure if I'd still be standing."
"D- Quite drinkable almost too easy even though the abv is 12. Highly recommended you just might want to share it though."
"d: a nice example of the style and a great bp"
"D: The alcohol is strong, but its the sugar that makes this a little rough."
"Overall- Very smooth and, too, quaffable for a 10%-12% barleywine?! (Thanks Patrick)"
"Wow, I can actually say that this bottle was worth the 16 dollars. This stuff is damn near a DIPA, with a bit more caramel flavor. Amazing beer."
"Drinks great for the abv & style, some addtional aging might've helped this one in this tasting , but I rate it a great ABW!"
"I had a sample of this beer a few months ago. This particular beer was about four years old and it was much better than this younger version that I have tonight. The hops digressed to an herbal, lightly-grassy note. The alcohols meld well with the candied fruits and the beer begins to take on the prefered balance of English style barleywines. Thanks to clvand0 and to Merlin48 for the beers."
"D- Yes this is easy to drink and"
"D- its something ill enjoy again and again, but not all the time and certainly not more than one at a time. its pretty potent, and pretty expensive. a nice choice for special occasions and i cant wait to see what time will do to this one."
"Drinkability is good enjoyable but nothing special to justify the price. More or less a good barleywine for twice the price or more of other good barleywines. I might of been expecting Dark Lord in BW formate who know. Worth a try not worth repeat buying unless you have much larger budget then mine."
"D: 12.5% is way up there but it's not abrassive and it actually drinks pretty easy. This is a very tasty barleywine and I'll be getting more next year at DLD."
"Pours a bright ruby hue with a fluffy one finger off-white head that dies down to a thin whispy layer of bubbles. An outer ring remains which leaves a good amount of stick on the sides of the glass. Smell begins with a powerful punch of piney hops, slick oily hops, and rich malt. Sweet candy sugars and some spice tickle the nose as well. Booze does make an appearance, but I was expecting that for the style and abv. Overall the aroma is very powerful and can be detected from halfway across the room, I love it. Taste begins with sweet malts followed by slick piney hops. Midway the caramel malt becomes more present with a touch of citrus. Aftertaste is dry and sweet, almost like hard candy I used to get from my grandma back in the day. Overall the taste isn't as complex as I had expected after taking a whiff, but it's still good none the less. Medium to full body with a smooth and creamy feel and a carbonation that stings the mouth leaving it slightly dry. I can't belive this beer is 12%, I hardly taste any of that on the tongue which is pretty scary. Barleywines aren't my favorite style, but this is defintely one of my favorites of the group. Good beer for sure, get your hands on this one if you can."
"All around, its really hard to top this barleywine. I've been on a barleywine kick lately and this is the best American style that I've had in a LONG time. The drinkability suffers a bit because of the high ABV but every other aspect is just magnificent. In my opinion, this is FFF's best offering."
"10.5 percent ABV according to the menu I bought it off. Pretty bright copper toned barley wine with a medium light tan head and great lace. Sharp grapefruit and some malt bread in the aroma. Taste is very smooth and sweet with pear and grapefruit, raspberry and caramel malt. Lots of goodies going on here with a viscous feel. Nice tartness over the caramel underpinnings. The alcohol is evident but does not preclude reasonable drinkability. This was a joy and was available to me at the new Brass Monkey in Kokomo, Indiana (unfortunately BA doesn't allow you to give credit on their Beer Spy report for Brewpubs for some reason). Thank you!"
"D- pretty solid sipper,"
"D- This was deceivingly drinkable. The alcohol is masked very well. A unique take on the style. Sounds like a big beer, but doesn't drink like one. A little pricey, but this is the finest American barleywine I have had."
"M&D: Full body, no carbonation, makes for a brew that coats the palate. At 12.5% ABV this is a big beer, so the drinkability is limited, but....FFF is fast becoming my favorite brewery. This is an excellent example of an American BW. Skal."
"I really enjoyed this. A beast like this in a 22oz bottle is hard to finish alone but it can be done. Just dont try to get up and walk around after you drink it all :)"
"This barleywine from FFF has so much going for it. Perfectly balanced, rich and creamy, easy to drink, and so damn tastey. You'd never guess it was 12.5% ABV."
"D: Quite a drinkable barleywine. Considering the alcohol content, the blend of ingredients hides the alcohol very nicely and creates a very pleasing barleywine. Not a sipper like some, you can go ahead and take a good mouthful and taste everything this has to offer. A good beer for sure, but the price is a little exorbitant. A good beer to pick up and try though."
"Poured a clear dark amber/ruby color with thin off-white head, some lacing. Smells of caramel, lots of pine, citrus, malt, and alcohol. Tastes of citrus, sweet malt, lots of caramel, and lots of pine. Medium full body with a syrup-like consistency. Well balanced with lots of caramel and lots of pine and the slightest kick of alcohol on the back end, to remind you of how big this girl really is. Strong flavors, very sweet, very piney, and very easy to drink for as powerful as it is."
"This beer was huge. Ruby red in the light with a minimal head. Lacing was poor and hardly stuck at all. Smelled of pine, herbs, dark malts, and alcohol. Flavor was the same, just magnified by about a thousand. Pretty spicy with some hop hints in the center. Dark malts and herbal/floral scents really took the center stage. Alcohol was present but not overpowering, though it grew exponentially as it warms. Pretty thick and hearty, couldn't have more than one 22oz bottle. A good find, but pretty pricey for $14.99."
"This beer poured a beautiful dark ruby red and formed an off white bubbly head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of hops, heavy on caramel and pine. The flavor was of hops, malt, caramel and anise with a somewhat vinous taste. Medium light and fairly light for this style. It has a bittersweet finish and could use some aging. At it's current price range I doubt that I will be getting it very often."
"The aftertaste is very long lasting...the mix of pine and caramel just keeps on keeping on and that's a great way to end each sip. Another winner from Three Floyds. No doubt about it."
"Pours caramel colored with little to no head on it. Smell is malty and caramelly and while balanced somewhat, doesn't have those billowing fresh hops that many of the Three Floyds beers do. Taste however, is exceptional, and very smooth with creamy caramel, with a hint of pine at the finish. One of the smoothest barley wines I've had, and especially for 12%, it's fantastic. Quite an awesome beer by one of my favorite breweries."
"Drinkability is amazing for a 12.5% ABV beer. Can easily drink the whole 22 oz bomber and still want more of its flowery, hoppy, malty goodness."
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: none, just chatting with my neighbor who brought the beer back from a business trip to Chicago..."
"Drinkability: Surely a nice American barleywine, but I do find the price somewhat deterring."
"With a notable Three Floyds flavor profile, this full bodied barleywine is a journey of hop and malt flavors. Overall drinkability is abstruse, with a great individuality of style offset by a heavy body and ever present 12.5%abv. I struggled with this review, finally deciding that this beer is simply a dichotomy of all that makes beer what it is. Tensions emerge between hop/malt, body/carbonation, and flavor/consumption. Try it. You may not love it, but you won't be disappointed."
"MF -"
"Very smooth and soft. Very drinkable barleywine, would'nt have guessed the alcohol content."
"D: The high ABV lends toward sharing with good friends. The purists would shout that this is not a barleywine, but I throughly enjoyed this brew none the less! Recommended!"
"Good stuff thats made for strong ale drinkers, not for the light hearted at a fat ABV of 12.5%. Enjoy and proceed with caution."
"The body was thick and did what it was supposed to. Good amount of carbonation. I would love to drink another bottle but its a bit expensive and there are still thousands of beers that I haven't tried yet."
"d: Thanks to brandoman63 for the chance to try this very solid barleywine."
"drinkable?: eh, kinda. its good, not great."
"I could go on all day, but this is great, and a really underrated barleywine. Perhaps it's not indicative of the style (very hoppy), and that's hurting it's cause."
"Cheers."
"D - Great beer. Cool bottle. Great beer."
"Final Comments: I absolutely loved this barleywine and would put it as one of the best American barleywines I have had to date."
"Aftertaste is bitter but doesn't linger...a nice cleaness prevails making you look for another sip."
"I've had this one for a while, but I believe I paid about $18 for the bottle - not a cheap beer for sure. A very good and interesting barley wine, definitely worth trying, but for the price I'm not sure I'd do more than one a season."
"Poured from 22oz bottle with yellow wax (2007). Poured into tasting glass from Pizza Port bottle shop, i brought it in to share. Poured a copper brown color with white thin head that lasted only a few seconds. Smell was of sweet malt, fruit bread, a touch of alcohol. Taste was a lot less hoppy and alcoholic than I expected, most of the flavors were carmel, a little pineapple, sweet breads, with a pinch of grapefruit and alcohol. Mouthfeel is sticky but without being overtop sweet with a medium to full body and etheral carbonation level. For being 12.5% it really doesnt taste it but it will creep up on you in the end. With a nice balanced flavor and aroma, I would like to try again with a little more age."
"This is a great barley wine. I was expecting something with a harsh hop bite. This beer is very smooth with a subtle and enjoyable flavor. Go get this one. Probably the easiest drinking barley wine I've had."
"Drinkability is surprisingly pretty good for such a high ABV beer. Easy to sip, and pretty tasty. Not my favorite beer from this style. But it is solid, and well made. With that said, I would definitely balk at the price tag if I ever saw this in a store. Bigfoot and Old Guardian are just as good (if not better) IMHO, and cost much less."
"This is a big fat beer. The goofy label is definitely a forcast of things to come. I'm glad that some of my friends are fat. This is a do over. Actually, it was a ""do over"" I've had it before and am glad to have returned. The perception stuff is worth your time. The clues you get about the upcoming experience are tricky and true."
"thick feel with a gentle carbonation. strong sweet maltiness up front with notes of brown sugar, then a drying hop finish. definite presence of piney hops and tropical fruits. alcohol is fairly well-hidden, although drinkability has to take a hit from the high ABV and price."
"Maybe I should have waited longer to try this. Not much head but off white almost vanilla in color. A large abundance of different flavors. Some fruit (apple, fig, orange), brown sugar and molasses in aroma. Quite malty. Hard to specify all the different flavors here. There are a bit more hops then I expected but that is not a bad thing at all."
"Not sure how old this is (bottle dating please!), but it's a little on the raw side, and will probably be even better as it ages. As is, it's a fine, enjoyable BW, just not quite as good as expected from Three Floyds."
"Update: Just had this one again @ Starkey's barn bar. Awesome beeer... Worth the molah.. Try one on its fits like a mo fuckin glove."
"I like this beer but the high abv and unavailability make this a 4 instead of a 4.5."
"The label, the wax, the price, its enough to make anyone curious."
"Young's Old Nick  English, true, but don't be a weenie about it"
"Muddy copper color-some slight head but it goes away in a hurry. Big hoppy aroma-sort of treacle like-malty sweet with some dried fruit and honey. Big malty and hoppy flavor. Decent level of bitterness. Very syrupy and sweet flavor. Decent body. Very full and sweet. Overall a decent US barleywine. Nothing in here stands out more then any other US version. Still a fine brew. Big props to beerbeing for the bottle to try. I hate wax capped bottles of beer-not worth the hassle for the decor."
"The color is NOT blonde, it is in fact copper colored with a thin tan head, more clear than murky. The aroma is pretty good for a barley wine, my final frontier of beers (and not one I appreciate so much yet). It smells kind of similar to Hair of the Dog beers, I wonder if it's similar yeast or fermentation process? Very sweet smelling, kind of like a dark fruit cake. The flavor is rich with sweet malts, grapefruity hops, and alcohol. The aftertaste is bitter, a little too tart for my tastes. Very thick mouthfeel, goes down slow. Difficult to rate drinkability high compared to, say a kolsch, but nicely drinkable for a barleywine."
"LATER: This is getting harder to drink. It's well-crafted-- it is FFF after all--but it's just a little too schizophrenic for me. I think in the high-ABV, hoppy barley wine-ish category, the 10th anniversary beer is a much better showing."
"One of the hoppiest barleywines you'll find (and that's saying something)."
"In a word, hoppy drinkable barleywine. Nicely hopped up but there have been other hoppy barleywines I have had that are more complex at a similar or lower price. Good head and hoppy aroma. Yellow wax 2007 that I should have aged, how did I know without a warning label."
"Overall this is a nice representation, the alcohol is well hidden. I look froward to trying this one with some age on it."
"I'd buy a heckuva lot of different singles before this one again, unless some major improvements came along. I would simplify the malt bill, add a little basic sugar (maybe even brown for character) to dry it out, and add some trademark aroma hops -- this beer is made for that!"
"Oily and hoppy BW, you know the alcohol is there, but it doesnt distract from a fine frosty. Nice rosey cheeks after just one glass."
"Nice Barleywine but this really is a hopheads brew. Nice and mellow as they go it could be more complex but I wouldn't exactly be unhappy drinking this often."
"I'd stock up on these in the beer cellar if it was in my market. A must try!"
"The hops are a little overwhelming and this is definitely a beer that could use some, but at the same time was probably intended for, aging. But honestly the more it warms it seems to balance itself a bit better. Stills seems a but unbalanced to me, but still a very nice beer. I'd like to pick up another and let it sit for a couple years."
"Thanks to mjgardner for the trade!!"
"Tastes like a clust of hops that I cannot place, giant mapel syrup, broken down sugary thick bittersweet malt. Everything condense down into its purest form. Thick and intense."
"Served slightly chilled in a snifter from a twenty two ounce yellow waxed bottle. Poured a beautiful dark amber brown color. About a finger and a half of rich off-white head formed. Head hung around for a few minutes and slowly faded into a thin layer in the glass. Left some sticky lace on the glass. The smell of this beer made my mouth water. Short hoppy bursts, dark fruits including fig, plums, rum soaked cherries and raisins, and a musty yeasty aroma. Had a nice full flavor to it. More hops , cherry, wood, plum raisin, and fig. Hints of well hidden alcohol, but not boozy. Nice hoppy kick smoothed out by a nice crisp malt character. Full bodied and almost thick in the mouth. Awesome drinkability for a 12.5 % barleywine."
"Poured into a chalice a cloudy amberish color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head which lasted awhile, some islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, raisins, plums, and caramel. The taste is malty, slight tangyness, and lots of caramel. The ABV on this brew has got to be hidden the best on a barleywine. Medium body. Very drinkable, a truly awesome barleywine, highly recommended."
"This is a very slick and easy barley wine thats fantastically balanced."
"D - Quite easy to drink, but be careful this bitch will sneak right up on your heels. Took me about 2 hours to polish off a bomber. Great beer."
"A fabulous, albeit overpriced beer. This is really the only reason for the drinkability score. It hides its ABV very well, and I certainly feel I could easily drink a great deal of it otherwise. What others have said about the complexity of the flavor is definitely true. It's kind of strange...it tastes quite sweet initally and its only when the aftertaste comes does one realize how hoppy it is. The aftertaste is pleasantly long. Serving it not-too-cold definitely improves the flavor."
"05/01/08 2007 vintage delicious, thick, syrupy, delicious this will age well and should be shared to mitigate how hardcore it is."
"bottle purchased at City Wide in Mishawaka, IN. Pours red brown with a thin filmy head. fruity and lupulin filled odor. lots of sweetness on the nose too. quite floral. Taste is very hoppy and grassy. Strong hops mask and meld with the strong ethanol flavors. Sugary with some cherry and strawberry notes. quite strong and not very well balanced. thick and syrupy. Surprizingly for 3 Floyds, this one is not ""not normal"" (double negative!). kind of a run of the mill big american barleywine. i was hoping with would be more mellow and delicious. oh well."
"update:had this via a bomber and it was quite different. darker, tawny color. rum and dark tropical fruits, preserved fruits in the aroma and taste. alcohol more noticeable."
"Pours a hazy red/brown, very thick off white head, nice lacing, great retention. Smell is very sweet, lots of toffee, tons of malt, lots of grapefruit, pine and citrus, nice balance now. Taste is similar, very sweet and malty, but with a ton of hops to keep it in check, very nice balance between the flavours. Mouthfeel is full bodied, syrupy and thick, low carbonation. This aged very well, only difference is the big aroma and flavour hops dropped out a bit, but I think the malts came forward and balanced it out a little bit more. Not sure which one I like more, the fresh or aged, but both are world class."
"Yellow wax coated bottle pours a mostly clear copper body. Attractive beige head is longlasting and leaves sticky lacing around the glass. Fabulous aroma is juicy fruity, lots of tropical fruit esters and invting hops. Pink grapefruit, orange marmelade, tangerine and papaya complimented by pine resin, brown sugar and caramel. Full medium body is thick and sticky. Adequate, but tame, carbonation. Taste begins with chewy caramel which quickly fades into an aggressive sticky hoppiness. Lots of oily resins segue into bitter waves of pine resin and grapefruit bitterness. Red apple and cherry notes float into the middle. Slight alcohol warming is a welcome addition to the grapefruit pulpiness. Very complex and delicious. Hop character is not unlike Dreadnaught but enveloped in a more substantial malt profile. An outstanding American barleywine!"
"A deep amber color with a thick, cream colored head; the color of the beer darkens towards the bottom of the glass. The aroma has grapefruit and braed scents, with a touch of sugery sweetness and malty fragrance; there is alot going on in there. This must be one of the sweetest tasting barley wines I have ever had, sweet malt, carmel and spices, with of sweet fruit flavors. Then at the end a hard smack of bitterness levels the playing field. A thick and sticky feel, with it almost wanting stick to the palate, then as it reaches the back of the throat the warming sensation of alchol hits the throat. Wow, this is damn good barley wine, drink it slowly though. Grab one of these and sit by a fire on cold winter evening."
"drinkability is excellent. very well balanced and excellent barleywine that has held up very well with age."
"Served in a pint glass the Behemoth pours a copper/caramel color with a half inch tan head. Head retention is low, but the lacing is very good. The main aroma I can pick up is citrus (grapefruit) hops, with some floral hops and caramel too, but hops is the main thing I can smell. The taste is very citrusy and pine hops, but it has some sweetness to it as well. Great combination of sweet and bitterness in this beer. Some alcohol shows up in the taste as the beer warms a bit, but it's not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium/heavy, it's oily and a bit syrupy. Drinkability is good too, the beer goes down smooth and it's easier to drink than you'd think it would be, considering the ABV. At $20 a bomber, it's a once a year purchase for me (if it was cheaper I'd buy it more often). But it's worth it just to try it, a pretty good beer IMO."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It has a bit of a syrupy feel to it. But, it goes down really nice. The alcohol is masked extremely well at 12.5%. But, I think the level of alcohol limits its drinkability. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Highly recommended. The only drawback to this beer is the price. I paid twenty bucks for this bomber. I don't think I'll be drinking many more, if any at all."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale, it's hearty, robust and mouthwatering. The high abv limits sessionability."
"Unbeleivabley drinkable, while the alcohol is noticeable its not distracting. Shockingly smooth for a beer this big and of this style, espicially since its fairly fresh."
"Talk about a difference between smell and taste!! Smelled like a hop bomb....huge grapefruit, brown sugar, massive hops. Yet in the taste it was so smooth and mellow I was amazed. For the price, $20, it is quite the investment. How can they charge that much when Dark Lord is less expensive and less available. Someone needs to explain supply and demand to 3F. Still, I will buy a few more as this is an astounding example of a barleywine. English or American?? Personally I think it is bordering on an English style as the hops are not that prominent. It is so complex with grapefruit, brown sugar, nuts, caramel, super sweet and creamy. Probably my favorite barleywine right now. Spend the $20 and try this one."
"Split a bomber of this with three good friends. Bottle says that some yeast was added for bottle conditioning. Drank from over-sized wine glasses. Pours a caramel/cider color. Small head, nice lacing. Hazy. Smells of sweet, piny hops, red grapes, lots of pineapple. The taste is a complex interplay between sweet malt and hops. I really love how it bounces around. Finishes hoppy. Medium thickness to it, bright fizz on the front of the tongue. An awesome example of barleywine. We drank this one fresh, but you could definitely cellar it for a while. Highly recommended."
"D: Good for high abv."
"Originally reviewed on 12/23/06. 22 Oz Bottle. Yeast fruit bread aroma, glazed with brown sugar and tangy light floral perfumes. Some unique foreign spice in the nose, even edges of agave plants and toasted smokey char crust. Nips of musty hop spice. Light apples and tawny pineapple. Pour of cherry-hued cloud, orange fringed. RIm of whitish. Flavor is a piquant, bold bright mid-fruit, yeasty and touched with warm cream. Bites of exotic fruit show through in Horned Melon, Lechee, and Prickly Pear. Sneaking edges of smoke, planty with touches of burning juniper and aloe vera. Hops muddle in pine and resin, with lots of mixed spicy fruits. Pakistani. Lots of Loblolly brances and Georgia pine sap. Leaves a crisp lemony smack, in Goldings. Higher alcohols alight in the front of the mouth and tip of the nose. Beautifully, balanced, unique and all around tasty, however it is fairly muddled and its hard to pull out individual characters. Thanks Andy!"
" My son, who's favorite beer is Miller Lite, enjoyed a glass of this and was quickly picking up the different flavors and smells much to his amazement!"
"D: Excellent balance! The sweet fruit and malt flavors are balanced expertly by the massive hoppiness. I agree with Mcallister, this is more like a DIPA. This is not a beer to be trifled with!"
"After tasting this brew, I was left with one burning question...why on Earth is this stuff so expensive? This is a decent brew, but $18 for a bomber? There are comparable brews which are just as good (and better) that are 1/2 to 1/3 the price. I was really looking forward to getting my hands on this one, but I can't justify buying any more."
"Cheers!"
"Thank you Randy from Archers! The line forms behind me."
"Pours a small head with an OK lacing and a dark ruby color that's a little hazy. The smell is so very hoppy with fruit smell of grapefruit flavor. That's all I taste is grapefruity hops with a hint of grassy hops near the finish. The mouthfeel was fine, but had a little bite to it. Overall I will have this again after aging it for a while."
"Flavor is sweet fruit for a second but rolls to hot boozy and peppery alcohol. No hops to be found. This is a big sippin beer, dont try to have multiple pints of this, cause it will end your nite!"
"I love beer."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for splitting this with me."
"Barely carbonated, creamy mouthfeel with some astringent bitterness upon swallowing. That and the higher abv lowers the drinkability somewhat for me."
"drinkability: good"
"Drinkability/Overall: even with an older bottle, the hops are still kickin' strong, yet balanced by a rich malty backbone. Alcohol is a little harsh yet, but this is a behemoth indeed"
"D- I think its to young but is still good. Bit harsh overall. It is nice but not what I have come to expect from Three Floyds. Wish I could try a 2003 or 2002."
"Drinkability: A damn fine barleywine. I would like to have a several year old bottle of thsi, i think it would age superbly."
"Not real drinkable, I don't think I could finish a bomber of this. But I won't turn the stuff down...I just wouldn't have it often."
"The young bottles still need a bit more time to meld, but give it another 3 - 4 months, and they should be just as good as this draft sample I had at the brewery in March of 04."
"Pours a slightly murky ruby color, the frothy head lasting only for a minute. Extremely sticky and chock full of pine notes, this is a perfect balance of malt assault and hop bomb. It's over the top. The alcohol is not overt in the flavor profile, but certainly makes itself known otherwise. Chewy, bready dough maltiness combines with lingering hop oils, ripe plums, citrus...and even prunes. Warming after-effects. Light carbonation, and extremely flavorful right out of the fridge - and still obviously delicious as it warms and becomes more toxic. I'm definitely taking this bomber down...or is it taking me down? This is undoubtedly a top-notch, first class American Barleywine. FFF distributes many of their brews here in PA...send this too!"
"Pours brown to ruby red with hints of orange, a nice size tan very tight head that slowly fades. Smell is rich, sugary, pruney malt with some pine tree hop aroma. There is also a little citrus note and just a hint of booze in the aroma. Taste is unique, the malts make an incredible brief but rich appearance before the hops take over. Some pineyness and a citrusy vitamin c tablet flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied and rich, there is also some chalkiness with the vitamin c flavor, a drying hop finish with some warmth from the alcohol. Interesting beer, the alcohol conent is amazingly balanced for its strength, but there are some different flavors and textures (vitamin c) that attack my palate. Look forward to an aged sample, a very good barleywine with some major citrus characteristics."
"D: Over rated I thought. Aftertaste was cloying and not so great. WAY better barleywines out there."
"There is seriously no subtlety in this beer. Much easier to drink after it warmed a bit and I adjusted to it a tad. Lots and lots of piney and citrusy hops. Kind of made my tongue tingle. And adding to the tongue tingles is a solid burn from the alcohol. Really took away from the mouthfeel and the drinkability. Think I am picking up some tannins but am not really too sure. Just really struggled to finish this beer."
"(Also, confused by the name...nothing ""blonde"" about this beauty!)"
"I let this warm for about 15 minutes out of the fridge. Body is a very deep amber brown, very attractive. Head is a thick fat bubbley rich tan color. Nose has an electric vigorous malt hoppy perfect balance with slight spiceyness, very cool. Sweet dark fruit mingled with malt on the entrance. Sweetness is long and sugaray. Hops become evident twords the end of the palate. Sours slightly on the finish. The finish which leads to the only point of downfall to thes beer. Mouthfeel is slightly hurt by this. Very end features a slightly burnt malt. Warms belly half way thriogh. Nice hidden alchol sneaks up on you."
"decent drinkability for the bigness of the beer. this is an absolute must try if your a fan of american barleywines. very, very impressive."
"Bottle: Poured a clear light brown color ale with a medium size white head with good retention. Aroma of citrus hops is easily distinguishable with a nice strong malt presence to back it up. Taste is well balance mix between sweet malt with a strong presence of citrus and floral hops. Body is lighter then expected and alcohol is well hidden. Probably a bit too much hops for my personal taste but very good nonetheless."
"Taste is very, very good - nice hops up front, sweet, bready malts, and a nice, warm, alcohol finish. Very well balanced, and very good."
"Cherry red color with a small, light tan head, which quickly fades. Monstrous piney and resiny hop aroma, juicy as hell, which after some time begins to smell very medicinal. Nothing but hop aromatics in the aroma and if this were a Double IPA that would be fine, but in a barley wine I want malt aromatics. Still though, the hops are vibrant enough in the nose to definately be enjoyable. The body is undeniably huge and provides a nice mouth experience. The flavor is fairly well balanced between hop and malt flavors, but overall I suppose this is more of a hop accented barley wine. Loads of juicy, medicinal hop flavors throughout the palate, with hints of grapefruit. The malts hints of toffee all the way through, with hints of caramel and roasted nuts. Quite the tasty treat, but it needs your complete attention and a pretty large sample, because it changes very much throughout the tasting. Also, I am not one for aging barley wines, but this really needs some time. Maybe it will peak at around six to eight months. Just like the Raspberry Eisbock, I was hoping it would be my first 5.0...but to no avail...maybe soon, maybe sometime. Hopefully"
"Wax dipped 22 oz brown glass bomber consumed in chi-town right after the initial release. Dark slightly muddy/orangey liquid with a nice skull cap of white froth. Aromas of juicy FFF hop blend (amarillo and others) and juciy malts. Another FFF fruit punch beer as I call them, like a kicked up dreadnaught with less hops and more fruit juice/sucre. mouthfeel is clean and this mix of hops and sugar that would scare any diabetic does not get cloying anywhere along the route. Drinkability is scarily good. Another achievment."
"At 12.5% I will not reach for anything beyond this 650ml...the night begins and ends with this one...no complaints here."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the dark copper brew. Head holds nicely for the style, with slow-fading lacing. Aroma is super fruity hops, with ample malt character and alcohol whiffs. Flavor is bubble gum hops, with the malt sweetness up to the supporting role, and substantial alcohol warming in the fade-out. Have to admit it doesn't seem like 12.5abv. Mouthfeel and drinkability are incredible for what this beer ""weighs"" in at. One of the most drinkable heavy beers I've encountered. Scary stuff."
"A wonderful winter experience I hearily recommend."
"22 ounce bottle with pink wax seal. Thanks beerinator!"
"This beer is huge on the ""would I drink another"" department, but I couldn't drink more than one of these in a night, at most. I split this bottle with my roommate and was still overwhelmed in hop juiciness, but I loved every second of it regardless of the struggle."
"I'll probably try the stuff on tap again."
"Pours from the 22 oz. bottle a dark copper color with a thinish (one finger with a moderately hard pour), off-white head. The head quickly fades to a small ring of lacing around the glass and a very thin skim of tiny bubbles. Smells strongly of grapefruit, citrus, and piney hop aromas with a distinct spiciness as well. A great inviting aroma overall. Sweet sticky citrus and piney flavors explode in the mouth with a strong hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is full, sticky, and smooth. While a bit unbalanced this is an outstanding beer which I've enjoyed many times on-tap in the past and hope to many times in the future."
"Pours a ruby brown color with a very thin head. Thin film does leave some OK lacing on the glass. Smell of molasses and brown sugar stand out to me with just the faintest hint of nuts. Flavor initially is dominated by the malty sweetness but there is enough hops bitterness to keep it from being sickenly sweet. The bitterness hangs around enough to pucker your cheeks a little with the aftertaste. This may be due to the high ABV also. A beer that is well worth the try but so BIG that I wouldn't drink it very often."
"This year's vintage poured into a cognac glass. A slight creamy white tan head, which faded fast, topped the dark copper/garnet body. Citrus hops with a load of sweet malts rush out of the glass. The hops are just in front of the malts in the initial swallow. Dark fruits combine with the hops nicely. The beer is more attenuated than in previous years so the finish is a bit dryer which is more to my liking rather than the liquid fruit cake it used to be. The alcohol is somewhat obvious so drink with caution."
"This is really quite a bit different than the last time I had this (in 2004), then it did not have the tropical fruit notes. My guess is that the hop bill changed on this. The tropical fruit notes are not bad, in fact they make the usual hop character quite interesting, but it is the medicinal notes in the finish that is a bit distracting. I do have this to say for it though, it is quite interesting!"
"Shared at Lava Lounge, thanks to hero27. Beer pours a very deep ruby red as described on the bottle, excellant lacing. This is very hoppy as you might expect from an American barley wine, but there is a strong pineapple aroma as well as plum and dark fruits. Taste is much like the aroma with a strong hop and pineapple presence paired with a nice bit of alcohol warmth. Did I say this is hoppy? Mouthfeel is very smooth. Drinkable, yes, but limit how much you have. I would definately like to see this beer after a year or two of aging, can't wait to see what else is in store for this, enjoy."
"Beer is good. Happy tropical fruit beering."
"I really did not find this one to be as overdone as I expected, given the style of the beer and brewerys track record. Yes, it is aggressively hopped, but it is quite complex and well balanced. Another fine offering from Three Floyds."
"Drinkability: This is just an excellent beer. The alcohol is well hidden and is deceptive. Is this really 12.5%. I could drink this all night. This fat bottom girl makes the rocking world go round."
"Drinkability, nice. In a room full of vultures, it was hard to get more than a taste of a couple ounces. Limited release and relatively high price make this a self regulating beer. You just can't get enough to drink it every day."
"Complex, strong, and incredibly drinkable."
"Taste: A body so huge I could have just stuck a fork in it and lick it. It knocks you out with a 3-punch combo of massive caramel malt, hop bitterness you feel all the way into the nerve endings of your teeth and a and alcoholic vapor that gets you right in the chest. This is for fans of extra-large Beers, but it is pretty balanced, if in an over-the-top, super-size-me American kind of way. I think my tongue turned white from the dry astringency of the hops. A fun experiment!"
"Sorrowfully totally clear amber-orange pour atop which an initially honest off-white cover fades at a constant rhythm. Expressive aroma firstly disarming you through a blast of floral, piney, sprucey aromatic amarillos. The underlying malt is not to be neglected, highly candyish, like concentrated Jolly Rancher juice. Tons of residual sugar components, yet well developed fruitiness, rich with melon and perfumed berry notes. Quite boozy in mouth, if not necessarily harshly so thanks to the cognac-like nature of the alcohol, reminding of a concentrated wine. Thus very sweet and fittingly very hoppy, foresty, fruity, woody and throath-coating. Very malty spirit is betrayed by a rather syrupy palate, certainly fruity and alcoholic, but also rather oily and slick even, the carbonation being restrained to say the least. Far from a favourite among barleywines, just not very mature nor sagacious, it remains an experiment worth seeking out."
"Don't beleive the hype."
"A real nice brown with an orange tint, but I got barely any head out of this thing. It smelled promising with large floral bouquet of some potent flower and some sap that has caught fire mixed with a double fist punch of alcohol all sitting above a bed of sweet malt madness. The I took a sip and the train jumped the tracks. What a mess of a beer. The alcohol is so prevailent that even the hops seem weak and they are strong enough to do damage all on there own. I could see laying this one down for some years that is the only thing that could save this. Sharp, abrasive, raw and rough is the way I would describe this beer. It does have a great thick mouthfeel and if I couldn't taste anything I would enjoy this well enough. Sorry maybe if I get some again I'll lay it down for a few years."
"Comments  Thanks to skyhand for popping this hop monster at the Second Annual Beer-o-ween party. It went great with Shaun of the Dead and my spicy enchiladas."
"It poured a clear red/orange topped by a slightly coarse tan head that thinned quickly to a ring. It did leave behind some lacing though. Pink grapefruit aroma and pine resin hops were quite strong, but caramel and toffee malts, as well as ripe fruit/raisin and faint alcohol, added some complexity and provided balance. There was a big malt backbone with a bit of alcohol that attempted to balance out the intense hop bitterness and huge hop flavour. Caramel and toffee malt provided lots of sweetness, and pine, grapefruit, and orange hop flavours produced a pleasant counterpoint. Lingering bitterness and resiny grapefruit in the finish. Plenty of alcohol warmth, which became a little hot in the finish after a while. Moderately low carbonation, fine bubbles, slightly syrupy. Pretty good overall, there's a lot of potential for this one as it matures. Thanks Viggo!"
"this beer exists somewhere between a barrel aged bw and a double ipa. dark lord epitomizes excess. this is more like dreadnaught, finding happiness in balance. can't wait to see where an aged bottle or two goes, however this is ready to drink NOW."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"As soon as you pop the top off this the hops come right at you. It poured out a dark red with a tall tan head that left streaks and rings of lace as it collapsed. Big citric hop notes with plenty of pine to go along with it. There is a big sweetness there as well as some ripe fruit notes and caramel malt competes with the giant hoppiness. No real alcohol comes out in the nose surprisingly. Taste is huge as well plenty of grapefruit and pine needle hops smacking you around with a nice bitterness. Dark ripe fruit notes balance it out a bit with some sweetness as does light caramel and light doughiness. Lots of stuff going on in the flavor and it all seems to come on strong. I think in a few months it might all meld together better which would really boost this to greatness. Ends with some bitter and sweet fruits. This definitely warms you up real quick with the first sip. Thick and almost syrupy with a bit of sticky sweetness going on. No lack of body here. Pretty damn drinkable with all things considered. Another great beer form 3 Floyds."
"D - It is a great beer, but is over the top in ABV and taste, this was split in two, and took about an hour and a half to finish, but enjoyed it all."
"Opened bottle hop aroma stretched across the room. Poured out nice reddish brown to copper color. Head long lasting some lacing. Head color off white. Aroma of hops, hops and more hops. It helps to accentuate the caramel, cherry, malt, and grapefruit. Tastes of hops, hops, and more hops. With caramel, malt and some grapefruit to start. Hops flavor lingering throughout. Warming up brings in some cherry, maple, piney character as well. Nicely carbonated, full bodied with slight aclcohol warming becoming present after half pint or so. Just a spectacular American Barley Wine. Well balanced even with the large hops aroma, and hop flavoring. You never really lose the other aromas and flavoring. Smooth till the finish seemingly aged a while before bottling. Well done 3F. All I can really say to express true feeling toward this beer is WoooHOOOO"
"My kind of woman!"
"Bomber bottle with wax on the top. Pours an amber/brown color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma reveals a lot of US hops as well as slight fruit and a strong malt character. The flavor is much the same. Big caramel malt backing with some cherry flavors and lots of hops. Fairly thick mouthfeel and the drinkability is very good. This is a very nice barleywine."
"Pours a brilliant and clear deep amber to mahogany with a light tan head that falls to a ring around the top. The light passing through it gives a really nice amber to red glow to the foot of my glass. The nose is not nearly as big as I expected it to be. There is a deep caramel sweetness with notes of artificial cherry from the aroma hop and a moderate piney hop bitterness. Very nice and rather complex. I like that its not incredibly strong. Flavor big maltyness...caramel is most prominent with fruity notes and light pineyness from the hop. No real bitterness hangs on. Aftertase is a little like spun sugar. Sweet, but not cloying. Tasty. The feel is thick, slightly syrupy with a light carbonation. Drinkability is outstanding. No hint at all of the ABV on this beer. The flavors meld well together and everything just works so well. Well worth trying. I like it."
"Poured a very dark copper with a tannish head on top that chilled out for a while there. Carbonation was apparent, in the opaque body. Smelled of pine, grapefruit, cherry, malty maltiness. Taste was of a warm alcohol bite, some sweet brown sugar, pine needles, juniper, grapefruit, plum, some whiskey notes and a very sweet finish with the hops bouncing around the tongue. This stuff was too drinkable for how strong it was. As I already drink beer pretty fast, I drank this one WAY too fast. Dangerous but delicious."
"D-Wow this beer has a good balance of big juicy hops and a powerful alcohol warmth. It would be nice to have a little more complexity in the malt flavor. I think this beer is young, bottled ~2 weeks ago, so as it ages it should get better and better."
"Notes: Good Beer. If you have tried Dreadnaught, you will probably expect nothing less from Three Floyds in the Barleywine category. A must try."
" The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. It is certainly coating. The drinkability is better than average, but the acidity of this prevents me from having another one, for now. I have plenty for later."
"Mouthfeel is dense with a nice creamy aspect and good stable carbonation. Chewy without going over the top. A nice sipper as each one packs an array of flavors. I wouldn't mind having a few of these on a cold day..but you have to watch out for that ABV. Paired nicely with some 3 year old cheddar. Well worth seeking out...I have a feeling that aging this a year or two will produce some good results. Still a bit overpriced in the grand scheme of things...but I guess one should not put a price on happiness...and right now I'm pretty damn happy."
"Rounded out by a thick mouthfeel, but not cloying or pasty, I tasted this beer whenever I burped or coughed for the next 24 hours, literally. Very extreme, but very drinkable in that over-the-top way. Found it on-tap at the Blind Tiger, a couple days after their Barleywine festival, and am very happy to have experienced it."
"While there is perhaps the slightest detection of alcohol looming underneath all the huge flavors here, it's super drinkable nonetheless. A very well-done barleywine, as one would expect from this brewery. Great stuff."
"Browns tree-bark brown with large off-white head. Aroma is beautiful malt and sweet bitterness. Dark fruit aromas, prunes, raisins along with citrus fruits. Flavor is wonderful malt ! Even the bitterness seems to be infused with earthy malty flavors. Almost a light smoke or peat also was detected. Really excellent beer that I think would do amazing sitting some 22 oz. bottles for a year or two in the cellar."
"Deep amber color. Small head. Aroma is floral hops and malts. A very big bold malty and hoppy barleywine. VERY smooth taste. The big rich malts are balanced by big floral citrusy hops. A very well balanced barleywine. The alcohol is not at all evident despite the 11.5%. VERY nice. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is surprisingly dry. Aftertaste is malty, with a lingering slight bitterness."
"Translucent amber with a thin but persistent head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Aroma is full of floral and pine hops, with some malt sneaking through. I can tell immediately that this is an Americanized Barleywine... but I'm not complaining. Flavor begins with a rich carmel malt sweetness that gives way to a piney bitterness... nicely balanced... not too much bitterness, just enough. Quite a bit of flavor and aroma hops went into this, and the hoppiness is quite pleasant. Moutfeel is sticky and oily with a full body and medium to low carbonation. Absolutely delicious!"
"Hotstuff and I went on a tour of their brewery. For $5 you get a 12oz glass of 3 of their beers. I thought this was the worst of their beers. The aroma was obnoxious to me. The head was mixed with large and small bubbles. It had a heavy taste with an after bite and an initial taste that I could only describe as off. The color was very nice deep caramel brown and you could not see through it. Hotstuff did not rate it but preferred to get another Robert The Bruce instead!"
"Originally sampled 14 December 2002. a wonderful balance of hops & malt. It has a loads of malt up front w/ a very dry finish. This is a world class winter warmer. When will they have this available in Southern California? Three Floyds makes some great beers."

"Aquired some of this via trade (bottled from growler). Very dark maple syrup color with a medium beige head. Strong malt and caramel nose. Rich and full-bodied, consisting of flavors of malt, alcohol, caramel and pineapple. Nice tart hops presence in the finish. Excellent."
" Hazy, orange/red color, thick, creamy tan head receeds to wispy froth covering the beer. Blast of fruity aromas - cantaloupe and raisins mixed w/ wildflowers. Full bodied, sugary malt up front, flavors of honey on toast - hops then bite the tongue and back of the throat while more grassy hops take charge of finishing things. Hop infused , sugary sweetness coats your mouth. This is like eating hop candy! Alcohol is there but does not over power this tasty barleywine. Very drinkable w/ a unique nuttiness and exceptional balance."
"Deep amber with slight carbonation. Very fruity nose. The flavor starts out by attacking every tastebud in your mouth - primarily sweet malt, with a background bitterness and alcohol that sings its praises loudly. Caramelly mid-sip, with a floral citrusy hoppiness hiding at the end. The finish changes 3 times in 2 seconds, from hop to sweet to toffee.  The main flavor is a sweet maltiness that is incredibly similar to my buddy's 1996 barleywine, so much so that I told him to haul his keester over to the bar because they kegged it for him. Huge. Wonderful."
