"The initial smell that sways my sinuses is one of raisin and a bit of toast. A few more inhales and I also notice a little bit of citrus, I suspect from the Willamette hops. Its color appears as a deep, and slightly cloudy mahogany. Backlit by the sun, it gives off a small red flare midst the brown. My first sip includes roasted malt, a tinge of hops, and more raisins from the nose. Midway through, I also detect vanilla and a little bourbon. It lingers, joined by big wood. [rim shot] No, really, the finish really leaves you with the oak-aged portion of the process. Great sipper. Tiny bubbles and mist-droplet like lacing. I’ve had the regular version of this. I much prefer this one, as it reminds me of Widdershins, but with less oak. Good take on barleywine, without being from across the pond."

"O - Meal in a glass. Definitely a sipper. Could have used a touch more carbonation/hop balance, but based on the age, I can understand that the hops and carbo is lost. Good to finally try a 2 yr barleywine, they wont last that long in my house."

"Great color,albeit a bit cloudy, and a nice fine head that like to stick around for a while. The nose is almost barleywine all the way, with a hint of oak playing a supporting role deep down under the figs, berries, nuts, light caramel, showing as a touch of vanilla bringing up the rear. Not too much here in the way of hops or specialty malts, but that's how I prefer them anyway. The vanilla comes out a lot more on the palate, while the oak lingers in the finish- a very well-integrated and non-intrusive element. The elegant presentation of well-woven flavors, unfortunately, is marred by an underattenuated quality that dominates all else. Dry this out a touch, and it would do a lot for this beer. Solid effort, but it easily could have been on a whole other level."

"this cant have spent too much time on wood, as the oak properties are way behind the malt, and the carbonation on this is still so robust. the color is a hazy dark amber, and its real heady for an oaked brew. the nose is slightly fruity, almost dried cherries or figs on it, with all the grain taking on a sweeter, molasses sort of complexion, with just a faint staleness. the flavor is rather uniform, with a real fruity finish and an impressively light body for both the alcohol content and the norms of the style. dark caramel sweetness from the grain, it tastes like unfermented wort, but the finish is much more resolved, dryer, and honestly rather clean for the start. cherry and maybe raisin fruit flavors as well. tons of bubbles on it, a well hidden abv, and a dangerously drinkable lighter body. i could stand to see a little more of a prominent oak profile on it, may mellow the grain sweetness, but i think the beer is solid as a more drinkable barleywine. not southern tiers best, but a beer not to pass up if you havent had one."

"Overall better then expected, with the sweetness thatbi love but still needing to age a little more for my taste. Would like to pick up a bottle"
"O: A nice, approachable example of an American barleywine that displays just enough depth and complexity to remain intriguing. I could see this being a good introduction to the style for ale drinkers wanting to try something a bit stronger and heavier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) I'd go for this again... A very nice barley wine to sip on. I've probably over scored a few barley wines in the past compared to this one, because it's definitely right up there."

"Overall, this more than lived up to expectations. I went out specifically for the tapping of this keg and I'm happy I did. I will most defnitely be seeking this out in the future--would love to try it from a bottle as well."
""
""
""
"Bottled Feb 2012; 23 months old."
""
""
""
"Glad I got to try this as I think its one of the better barleywines I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the shop employee recommended this not sure how old it is but he said it had some age on it and it was drinking well, well he wasn't lying this is great. More like an English Barley Wine as the hops have matured past in your face bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite an enjoyable Barleywine. One of the more balanced I've tasted. Quite drinkable despite the abv. Usually I like to cellar a Barlywine for a good year, but this was able to be enjoyed right away. I suspect the oak has tamed some of the over the top hops and sweetness that Barleywines usually display."
""
""
"O- big caramel malt flavor with a nice citrusy flavor to compliment, a bit of age has been nice to this beer, very good."
""
"This is good...REALLY good."

"I kinda knew I was gonna love this before even cracking it open. And I did. Oh yes... I did."

"Bottle to snifter at World of Beer Tioga. Pours a reddish brown, clear, with nearly no head. Aroma of sweet hard candies, bit of dank hops, but heavy on the caramel malt. Flavor is toffee, biscuit, hard candy, dry oak, vanilla root beer. Plenty going on but super sweet. I sould have shared this with someone, but it was only my wife and I at the bar and she won't drink it. Slick mouthfeel with lowish carbonation. Not bad, but just a bit much for me. On the sweet side and a bit more oak than I would have wanted."
""
""
"O: This is a damn nice barley wine and the year I let it age has done some nice things to mellow it out a bit"
""
"O) Very good beer can't wait to have again. It's a great option for an American style barley wine"
""
""

"Overall like the oak aged Pumking the oak really does round out the hops and malts, making some flavors stronger and some secondary flavors come to life. Truly a world class Barleywine."
""
"Overall not too bad. Approachable for those starting their forray into barleywines. not overly complex. The oak smooths the beer out and adds a nice secondary flavor profile. Affordable (8.99), easy-drinking and tasty but not the greatest"
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer, but not a showstopper. I definitely enjoyed it, and it gained some complexity as it warmed up from the 46F pour temp. There’s just a “stand-out” element missing that places it behind other barlywine-styled brews I’ve drunk."
""
""
"o: I'm very glad I found one of these but I wish I had more. Great beer with some age on it."
""
""
"O: A sure winter sipper of a beer. It’s very nicely balanced and the oak is well integrated. Alcohol is very tame, even at the 9.6%. A solid buy when it’s available."
""
""
""
"O: Finally, a good beer in the past few days, it might just have been that I needed a break from stouts. This seems like a light barleywine, but I don't mean that in a bad way. It is a full and flavorful BW that is easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent American Barley Wine, one of the best Ive had. Id drink this again in a heartbeat."
"O: This seems to strike a middle ground between the hoppy American barleywine and the sweet, desserty English barleywine - and truth be told, I'm more reminded of the latter here. Oddly for the style, this is best when it's very cold; it becomes rather imbalanced and even harsh when warmed up sufficiently."
""
"Chestnut brown in color with a reddish hue and a slight haze. Poured with a short beige foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet caramel malt, prune and ripe apple aromas with spicy herbal and citrus hop aromas in the background. Vanilla aromas surface and intensify as this warms. Full bodied, chewy feel with lazy rich carbonation and a pleasant spicy tanginess. Vanilla, ripe fruit, apple and prune flavors throughout. Bready and caramel flavors up front. Tangy, peppery, herbal flavors through the middle that transition to citrusy, bitter hops at the end. Finishes with a sticky sweet maltiness on the edges with a delayed hop bitterness down the middle. Incredibly malty yet a plethora of flavors and hop character."
""
""
""
"D- could be the oakiest beer I've ever had and it's dope when you think of it as a whiskey although it has a distinct freshness to it also. The sheer amount of tannins has my pilot light flickering. A little more sweetness in the flavor would be appreciated but it's a beast as it is. This is a cigar beer if I've ever had one. Something dark to compliment the spiciness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich amber tinged deep brown with a billowing one and a half finger off white creamy head that takes forever to settle,just great clarity and a great head.Toasty oak and alcohol soaked dark fruit in the nose,as it warms a real alcohol zip comes into play.A full creamy feel with low carbonation.Flavors are lightly toasted with a shot of vanilla and raisin,it's not overly sweet though as there is a earthy more toasted finish.I like this better than the standard version,it doesn't seem to be as sweet,the oak is not overbearing.another great one from ST."
""
"Final Thoughts: I’d been curious to try Backburner for a while now (well ever since I grew to appreciate this style) and while not the beer I expected, it did impress. Just when I’d begun to peg the American Barleywine style as nothing more than citrusy malt-bombs, Backburner comes along and redefines that trend. With characteristics of both an American Barleywine, English Barleywine, and Scotch Ale, Backburner is a treat for those seek out the finer things. Would I drink it again? Sure."
""
""
"O: I hate to say it but I'm not a fan of this one. I like that the oak cuts the sweetness but its just too understated for the brigade of sweetness that attacks the palate. It's like drinking overly sweetened tea. Well put together and easy drinking gives this a bump in points. I read reviews about a strong hop profile so I really want to try a fresh version."
""
""
"Overall- I have had this before younger and it was very good. Picked up a 15 month old bottle to try. Still a solid barley wine. I have never had the un-oaked version so I don't how it compares but the oak helps this out a lot. I see they dry hop with amirillo and centennial so I'd be interested in finding a fresh bottle some day. If you like barelywine this is worth a try."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/15/2012. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big orange zest, caramel, raisin, molasses, toast, toffee, oak, floral, pine, grass, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of malt notes with moderate hop and oak balance. Taste of orange zest, caramel, raisin, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, floral, pine, oak, grass, and floral earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange zest, raisin, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toast, brown bread, floral, light pine, and hop earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and balance of deep malt flavors with moderate hop balance; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and moderately full bodied; with a creamy, fairly slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine! All around nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate hops; and dangerously smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Poured from tap into snifter at tap and mallet Rochester ny. Pours a hazy burnt orange with nice lacing. Sweet malty syrup and an almost citrus hop aroma. Taste is somewhat mild toffe at first but finishes with a big toffee caramel hop flavor with a mild vanilla woody oak. Its easy to drink....really easy but hits hard. Its better as it warms. Nice barleywine."
""
"O - A well crafted American Barley Wine. Hits the mark with a nice hop bill that balances the sweetness of the malt. It is what you would expect. The kicker though, is you are not getting much of the oak in the flavor. Perhaps the oak is working in the background to balance out the often assertive flavors in the style. Would like to see how this one works out with age and will definitely consider getting more if it is available."
""
""
""
""

"O: This is actually pretty nice. The oak tempers the sweetness a bit, and the hop character isn't astringent or overbearing."
""
""

"appears a deep brown with brilliant red highlights. nice thick off-white head. decent retention and lacing. rich boozy aroma. spicy, herbal, wood. earthy hops, complex. taste has a good balance of caramel malt, bitter hops, and slight alcohol burn. a bit syrupy, coats the tongue, mild carbonation, which works. nice beers to slowly sip and enjoy. opens up and is quite nice as it warms."

"O: A fairly sweet beer that's got a good amount of hops bitterness with a moderate amount of oak character. I didn't get much in the way of an other barrel character like like it was a wine or whiskey barrel that it was aged in and overall I'd like a bit more oak character in there. I'd had this fresh before, like out bright tank 13 day after brewing fresh along with from the store where it's had a solid amount of hops flavor and aroma which is awesome if not a bit agressive. Aged this beer has mellowed but I don't see it become an elegant after dinner beer like other Barleywine. Personally I prefer this one young and full of hops character but this still help ease the pain of a long work week just fine."
"Overall very good."

"Overall this was solid beer but with some many other barleywines out there that I like better, I probably won't buy it anytime soon again."
"O: Obviously the answer is ""It depends on the temperature."""
""
"Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip, bottled 2/15/12. Pours a orange red, with a one inch off white head, that leaves some solid lace. Smell is hard candy, vanilla, dark fruit, biscuit, carmel, grapefruit, and brown sugar. Taste is really well balanced, lots of vanilla, carmel, burnt brown sugar, and sweet grapefruit in the finish. Body is thinner than expected, the amount of carbonation you would expect, not really dry, and drinkable for its heft. This is a good and different tasting barleywine."
""
"O: its a pretty nice all around BW. really enjoy the oak aged aspects, along with the big vanilla. like BW's it has the complexity to make this one intriguing and enjoyable. Solid."
""
""
""
""
"O: I am a big Southern Tier fan, they just do it right. I am a big Barley Wine fan. This is a beer that meets the style and lives up to the Southern Tier level of quality and uniqueness."
"My sister picked this up for me at the brewery. Beautiful clear mahogany pour with two finger off-white head with decent retention and great lacing. Huge sweet oaky nose with hints of caramel, butterscotch candy, booze, vanilla, and toffee. The taste is complex and the oak is once again the star. Nicely complemented with hints of caramel, butter, brown sugar, vanilla, dark fruit (specifically figs), toffee, and just a touch of orange zest, licorice, and coconut. The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy but surprisingly smooth with a subtle bitterness and alcohol warming on the finish. With that said, it's really pretty drinkable for a 9.6% ABV beer! Had this on tap at the brewery earlier this year and it's even smoother and more drinkable than the bottle version. Probably my favorite Barley Wine..."
""
""
""
"O- Nothing really jumps out to me in this beer but overall its solid. Have had better barleywines for sure but this is a worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good. Glad to have tried it."
""
"Pours a clear brown with a foamy tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, citrus zest, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a medium citrus zest bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but really doesn’t come across as oak-aged in the aroma or flavor."
"Overall, by far the best thing about this brew was the nose. This is the closest nose we’ve found to be nearly as oaky and smooth as the Bourbon County series. The rest of the tasting falls from there drastically. The flavoring is hugely boozy throughout, with fusel fire burning away the rest of the palate, and decimating all flavor. The feel was also thinner than expected, again, taking away from the experience."
"This beer is either way too young or just doesn't work. Very raw and powerful flavors all around. Nothing seemed to mesh well. I'd like to try a bottled version with some time on it."
"Nice BW, falls into its style."
"O- This is a solid Barley wine. Its very hop forward which leaves me to think that this was only aged for a few months on oak chips. If it was aged for a longer period of time The hop flavor would have completely disappeared and I think the oak would have been more present. But, a great beer and for 7$, it is a steal."
"O- This beer is a bit dry and most of the flavors are very soft but the big pungent hops seem to dominate everything. The raw oak notes do add a nice character to the beer."
""
""
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, mellow bourbon, small dark fruits, and alcohol. In the taste, alcohol to oaky bourbon, dark fruit, and licorice. An alcohol bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry bourbon, vanilla, and alcohol like aftertaste. Too big, like a shot inside a barleywine. It's just too much for me."
""
"O- I've never had regular Backburner so I can't say if this is better or worse, but I can tell where the oak really shines through and helps this beer."
""
""
"O: I will drink this again and again. My biggest inital complaint with non BA version is that it super bitter, like Bigfoot, which I can not stand. The oak really rounds out the beer and makes it very plesant and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- one of my favorite barleywines that I've tried. Robustly hopped and so smooth with the nice blended flavors of oak. Excellent and highly recommended."
""
""
"O- Silky smooth, sweet, bitter, citrusy, with enough notes to keep even the best playing!!! Awesome blend of caramel sweetness, bitter citrus/pine, licorice, and buttered popcorn. Nice mouthfeel! Nice stickiness!!!"
""
"This one really benefits from the aging, in my opinion. The original was dominated by a persistant presence of the yeast that was used, while this was much more balanced by the oak, fruit and caramel flavors."
""
""
"Overall a fantastic barley wine made better with some oak additions. A must for anyone who likes barley wines or for those who dont think they like the style."
"O-I've had the regular Back Burner but never reviewed it. Should seek it out for comparison."
""
""
"The flavor is good too. More earthiness, more cloying caramel-like sweetness, but overall nice. Fruit notes creep in after a few quaffs. I feel like the oak doesn't shine as much in the flavor. I think my tolerance for alcohol flavor is strengthening because this one doesn't seem to bad, at least i a not getting any annoying alcoholic notes like others have had."
"I’ve always been a big fan of Backburner. Needless to say, an oak aged version was very intriguing to me. It definitely delivers, but it isn’t quite as good as Backburner. I think the oak flavor tends to mask some of its dark fruit and hop flavor. It’s still very good though. Definitely a worthy endeavor. Check it out."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, chewy, sweet, and hot."
""
"D - Very nice offering here from Southern Tier... I wasn't even aware I had purchased the oak aged version until I took my first sip... Lots of good things going on here, but perhaps a bit too young... A little time in the bottle could round this one into elite Barleywine contention..."
"NICE, NOT MUST HAVE!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- good Barleywine but not very complex. Wish this beer picked up some more flavors from the oak."
""
""
"adds a bit of complexity on top of the base beer, which was lacking a bit in that department. Doesn't quite become a complex, savory monster as many oak/barrel/bourbon aged barleywines are able to. It's better than the original, but not worth seeking out extensively."
""
""
"This oaked version of Backburner remains well balanced between malt and hops for a perfect after dinner substitute to port wines or sherries. The complexity of oak gives an overall woodish taste and powdery texture but also amplify the caramel, vanillans, and char while rounding off the rougher edges of grassy and sharp citrusy hops."
"Overall, a pretty tasty beer. Alcohol is definitely evident. I expected a little more hop presence for the style."
"All in all, a pleasure to slowly swill, but although it is well crafted & very complex, it's perhaps too much so for my liking in the Barley Wine style!"
"O: Very much like the base beer, only with added notes of vanilla and oak. I like the complexity of this, even though it's difficult to get past the sweetness in some cases. The oak and vanilla come out more and more as this warms up, so it's good to let this sit for about 20 minutes before it really shines and becomes a different beer than the regular"
""
"O: Not my favorite barleywine, but drinkable nonetheless."
""
""
"I've been in love with the Backburner, and when the base beer is as good as it is I believe you shouldn't mess with it. However, there's exceptions to that just looka at what Founders does with variations of Breakfast Stout. Pours a deep ruby red mahogany brown hue with a cream colored khaki head with fine speckled laicng forming on the sides of my glass. Aroma has oak and vanilla with hints of booze, caramelized sugars with a rolling breadiness. Also in addition there's a subdued earth, citrus pith, and herbaceous flavor combination that gets a bit jaded by the loads of vanilla and charred oak flavors, making the beer a bit dysmal for me. I like Unearthly but not a fan of Oak Aged Unearthly, this is basically the same type of oak flavor, it just doesn't do anything for me that the base beer meant so much. Mouthfeel burns a bit a, quite booze ridden with dry oak chip finish going on, cloyingly sweet at the same time not enough hops balance things out. Overall I don't like the booze level and the overt sweetness found in this beer."
"Picked up just because. Poured into a tulip glass after being forces to bowl, I hate bowling. This beer has an awesome color, deep transparent garnett red, it glows. Some puffy head, a little bit of lacing, actually more like speckling. Aroma has some pine, pith, rich malty toffee and caramel notes, and oak essence, did I just right oak essence? Well oak, its there actually it kind of takes away from the rest of the aroma. Some good things, balanced hops, citrus, pith, pine, rich caramel like malt, syrupy, sappy. Some bad things, the oak / wood flavor is a bit artificial and wood chip - E tasting. Aside from that I really enjoy the balance of this beer, some A - Barleywines are just too hoppy / bitter and this is nice. A rich full and slightly slick mouthfeel, its good, it isn't hot, and the alcohol hides well. I think this beer wwould be great in 6 months, perhaps the wood would relax at that point."
"O: a good beer, overall. I really like the peach aromas, though I'm not for sure if they're intended or not. Still, it's not cloyingly sweet like many Southern Tier beers."
"Overall-A great Barleywine style ale. I have been drinking a lot of Barleywine's lately and this one was a pleasure to drink, very drinkable but yet still complex enought to make it interesting."
"Medium body, with lower carbonation. Some warmth from alcohol. Great oak character. Awesome beer."
