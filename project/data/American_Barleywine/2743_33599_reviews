"This one is pretty impressive. Hazy brown colour, big head with a full lace and crown that leaves forever. Smell of Pine, allspices, cardamom or clove, citrus, brandy, tobacco, wood (oak?)...  Not thick and not light in the palate, not too mauch carbonation, it feels really good. Taste is just like the aroma, maybe with some hints of chocolate and a bit more sweet., though bitterness and sweetness come and go on the same level.Very good indeed. Maybe if I can get another one I'll give a perfect ten."

"O: A nice, mellow big barleywine--the 2 years aging mellow out the hops that this beer brings when it is fresh but it also mellows the heat a bit"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Time in the cellar did this one good. I might go so far as to suggest this is among the better non- barrel aged American barleywines."

"The Green Flash Brewing Co. BarleyWine gets a phenomenal penalty-shot-goal-in-overtime 9.5 / 10"

"O: an excellent, hop-forward U.S. barley wine; one of the better examples that I’ve tried."
""
""
""
""
"If I were to rate this beer as a barleywine it would get a very low mark, and that shouldn't happen because this is a very good beer. So I will rate it simply as a beer, regardless of label or sub-label."

"O: A very craftsman beer. It is complex, yet not overbearing. It is drinkable, yet gives you something to consider. I liked it."

"Barleywine pours a reddish amber color with a very small lacing head. The aroma is is very sharp, with an aged malty undertone. The taste is very sharp as well, noticeable bold malty undertone, with boozy flavors. Good full and bold flavors. Overall its a very nice traditional barleywine."
"If this brew went back to the drawing board or maybe a barrel (cough-cough) it may shape into something wonderful. However, as currently sits, it’s forgettable, but at the price point ($6/22oz) it’s worthy."
"O-It was a very complex beer. You get caramel malt to spice then hop bitterness then you get a very good malt finish and every sip gets better"
""
""
""
"O: Very nice balanced barleywine worth trying. Green Flash shows extreme competence in this style with this brew."

"overall, a great high octane brew. I appreciate the taste and like the different variations of barleywines and other high abv brews but I cant help but wonder why those idiots keep drinking that manure 4loco or whatever it is when this is just so much greater when one may want a higher abv-ed beverage....?"

"Overall: I've only had one barleywine before (Moylan's Old Blarney Barleywine Style Ale), this was my second. Both are absolutely exceptional. I get the feeling that this will be my favourite style from here on out."
""
""
"Personally, I'll be sticking with Bigfoot and Old Ruffian as my go-to barleywines, but this one is definitely worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is full, and the finish lasts and lasts. I had this beer a few months ago when it came in from the warehouse from work, and now it's come back it's even better. A very special experience."
""
""
""
"Pretty hoppy aggressive flavours. Very sharp pine and grapefruit with accompanying massive bitterness alongside some bready malt. Thick syrupy body."

"O: My favorite barleywine so far. Good amount of sweetness and bitterness."
""
"22 ounce bottle into snifter, 2011 vintage. Pours very hazy dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big orange rind, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, caramel, toast, floral, grass, molasses, dark bread, light roast, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and hop notes. Taste of big orange zest, grapefruit, pine, caramel, molasses, toast, floral, grass, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, caramel, toast, molasses, pine resin, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barleywine! Great balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"Overall it's a nice, smooth barleywine that meets my expectations for Green Flash's usual high standards."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I dig it. It is somewhat similar to and IIPA with it's hop profile. What sets it apart is it's big malt base."
""
""
""
"Overall: Clearly an American style barleywine, with a strong hop profile, yet this is a bit middle-of-the-road for the style, with a mouthfeel that is slightly thin and a malt base that is a bit understated; still, quite a nice drinker"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, brown color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of wet hop, citrus hops, slight floral hops, sweet malt, alcohol, and hop oils. Fits the style of an American Barleywine. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hop oils, hint of roasted malt, alcohol, citrus hops, slight floral hops, hint of wet hop, and a hint of earthy malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, body, and complexity. My only slight complaint is that I wish is had a little more balance in flavors between the hops and malt/alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Single finger thick off white head with little retention on a murky amber and crimson body with excellent lacing. Nice rich aroma of mostly citrus fruit but also some dark fruits and fig on a caramel malt background. Well balanced flavor with toasted caramel malts and earthy and fruity hops with notes of toffee and pine resin. Not overly sour or bitter. Alcohol is a little strong but not too bad for the ABV. Sooth, medium body and moderate carbonation."
""
""
"Pours a dark red/amber body with an off-white creamy head sticking nicely to the glass. Big floral hoppiness in the noze with a nice layer of malt. Hop is really present in the taste with a lot of floral/piney/citrusy notes an a purgent bitterness. Big malty sweetness that gives a full body which balances the hop with raisins/figs aroma. Alcohol at the end gently tickles the throat. Really good barley wine! One of the american examples that is close to an imperial IPA in terms of IBU and hoppy notes. I really love that one, recommended!"
"Overall: I’m quickly finding another style of beer that I’m liking…this barleywine is not as sweet as some I’ve had and while that’s not a bad thing, it just makes it different…the malt flavor is a little too amber malt for me, but that’s the only “knock” I’ve got and that’s probably just be a personal preference…the piney resinous hop flavor is strong and complimentary…this is a solid brew that doesn’t take long to be effective but isn’t too strong to cloud my judgment either…very drinkable and easily recommendable…I definitely want to get at least one more for the future…it’s got a vintage date which usually means it can survive in a cellar for at least a couple of years and I mind as well test that…if you just want a beer to sit back and relax with, this is a great choice…shoot, this is a great choice for disc golfing with and that’s my highest honor! I have to say, the more I drink, the more I like this brew…(4/5)"

"Pours a dark brownish ruby red color with a finger and a half dark tan head that dissipates somewhat slowly and leaves a thick ring of lacing. Smells of lots of carmel and toffee, lots of bready notes from the malt, some brown sugar, raisins, a little dankness from the hops, as well as some grapefruit and pine. Thought there would be more hops on the nose. Taste starts with some resinous hop qualities such as grapefruit, pine, and orange rind. Then in the middle the hop qualities take a back seat to the malts. Lots of carmel, toffee, breadiness, some molasses or brown sugar. Then the finish is more of the heavy malt presence: lots of sweetness and breadiness, as well as some raisins, but more of the resinous hops show through as well. More complex hops flavors show through on the end such as floral, grass, and resin. Some booze on the finish that provides a warming sensation on the way down. Tastes very much like Bells This One Goes to 11 when it warms, as the hops show through much more. A pretty full body with a thick, creamy, and oily mouthfeel. Have had better American barleywines, but still decent."
"22 oz bomber served in a snifter, purchased from Yosemite Valley's Village Store. Deep amber red/brown with a big, thick head. Oily texture. Aroma is hoppy and honey smell. Taste is mostly caramel and honey but still retains a citrus peel, pine; finishing grassy. Good Barleywine worth getting again!"

"O- I can't tell if aging would make this one any better due to the fact that the hops are so enjoyable. Either way, I also enjoyed its mild sweetness and would definitely have it again."

"O - Green Flash impresses yet again. They have not let me down in a long time. Well done Barleywine! Perfect for a Thursday night work week wind down..."
""
"O: As straight forward as the name, this is a no-frills barleywine that is solid but lacks enthuiasiasm. Strong but without complexity and interest. A good introduction to the style and a worthy stepping stone to greater brews."
""
""
""
"Overall a real pleasant straightforward barleywine, very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really tasty Barleywine and very easy to drink considering the high ABV, but not the best I've ever had. Worthy trying especially for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A finely balanced beer here, well-executed and smooth as silk, in traditional Green Flash style. Utilizes their signature malt base with some very fruity hops to set off the balance. Definitely leans more towards the fruity style of barleywines, a' la Founders Bolt Cutter, but I prefer the sharp Simcoe flavor in the Bigfoot / Old Guardian vein. Green Flash has definitely produced a fine brew here, but a bit on the mild side for me. I'll give this a B+/A-."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall solid bwine, a little bitter than most but not too cliying, nice mix of flavors"
""
""
"I enjoyed this brew. It was a very well hopped interpretation of a Barleywine that seemed like a SN Bigfoot that was taken to the next level."
"O - A very dense, complex barley wine with lots of noticeable flavors occurring. I am trying it fresh for the first time, and now I'm thinking about picking up another bottle to lay down, because I believe this beer has great potential for aging well. Will report back in a year or two."
""
"D: Not the best drinker, largely due to difficulties in keeping the high ABV under control in the taste. I've had other brews just as strong that do a better job at that task."
"This is a solid, hoppybeer that has a great flavor and good complexity. The balance is there and it has scary drinkability. It's a borderline DIPA with the tropical fruit notes from the hops, but it packs a nice barleywine-like malt character. This was a nice all around. It's definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"This beer was a bargain at 4.99 per bomber. Plus, it's bottle conditioned and should continue to evolve over time. I realize my bottle was about a year old. I must try a fresh bottle some time to see if it has a bit more hop presence."
""
""
"D: A no-frills staple west coast American barleywine."
""
""
"Bottle said 2011 Vintage"
""
" This Barleywine has everything for Fans of the West coast style wrapped up in the flavor. There is a blast of pine with slight fusel alcohol in the taste and hint of spice with a light caramel dose of malt in the deep lasting middle which leads to a bitter and slightly warm finish. The taste has slight citrus/grapefruit tinges but mainly pine oriented hops and gentle caramel from the malt combine with a strong taste of alcohol but not overboard as it mainly comes through in the finish. I enjoyed this one a lot, a pretty solid example of an American Style barlewine -very fresh and full of hops, but not really trying to be an Imperial Ipa in disguise -it has the malt backbone you expect in a Barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A West Coast styled American Barleywine that features substantial hops bitterness, alcohol and a surprisingly high amount of malts flavors. It's a great beer to sip on a cool Autumn night."
""
"Very nice barleywine that has done well with age. I think this would have been a hot mess fresh. Very pleasant drinker with a unique spice component for the style."
"One of the hoppier barleywines I've ever had. Not a miss per se, but probably below average in the barleywine patheon and the weakest of many great beers I've had from Green Flash. Extremely marginal recommendation on this one."
""
""
""
""
"D: Overall a solid American Barleywine with some real complex layers resulting from an extended boil of Pale Malts (English?), high Crystal malts, and perhaps some Special B accentuating that raisin/figgy ester profile. Huge charge of hops here. Not quite as smooth as a SN Bigfoot when fresh but just as good in its own way. Alcohol definitely asserts itself this one could benefit from another 6-12 months on it."
"O - Very impressed with this one. A little on the boozy side but very well balanced and definaitely worth a go."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy dark orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same along with a weird celery-like flavor. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the celery flavor I am picking up is pretty odd."
"M/O - Medium to big body on this one and no alcohol taste/burn. Leaves the palate clean and slightly chewy. Overall it's a great barleywine in my opinion that tends to the low-hop characteristics of the style. Will be a regular in my fridge/cellar."
""
"Green Flash Barleywine is not my favorite American Barleywine however, it is good nonetheless. .. Nice ‘warming’ winter ale."
""
"overall - if aroma was improved, it would complete the beer. solid though."
""
""
"Carbonation is really nice and overall I like this beer."
"O: this is an excellent barleywine, nice balance between bitter and sweet, nice finish, very tasty"
"O: a good barleywine - but not much else; nothing really exceptional to set it apart; a worthy buy and try"
"22oz bottle with Vintage 2012 on the bottle. Pours a dark mahogany color with an inch of frothy tan head. Lots of lacing. Aromas of booze, brown sugar, dark fruits, caramel malts and bread. Taste has a surprising amount of citrus hop flavor upfront followed by the caramel malts, earth, booze, and burnt brown sugar. Nice amount of alcohol burn. Afertaste of caramel and booze along with some dark fruits. This is a barleywine with a fair amount of hop flavor to it. Interested in aging one now. Overall, this is a solid barleywine worth seeking out."

"ADDENDUM: When eating with this beer, the alcohol gets expressed more prominently."
"22fl oz bottle. Snifter glass. Renjoyed on may´12. Pours mahogany in color. Beige, small bubbled, froth creates a thick & lasting crown. Spotty lacing on sides. Yeast & chocolate with hints of floral hops to the nose. Dry bitterness, toffee notes & toasted coffee. Viscous & creamy mouthfeel. Full body, moderate carbonation.Wood & pine on the aftertaste.ABV is felt just at the end to confirm it is not necessary to be a hot Barley Wine to be a Top one. Very nice drinking experience."
""
""
"O: Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I'd drink again, and recommend to others. A great example of an American barleywine. Extreme, but in equal measures; bittersweet, as it were."
""
""
""
"O- Finally a Green Flash that I like! Wish that I had another to sit in for a year to compare notes."
"Not bad for my first taste of barley wine. May come back and rate this again once I’ve had a few."
""
"O: Another solidly made, drinkable beer from Green Flash."
"O-- Think this barleywine is on the turn to the good stuff. Hops are not as apparent and the malt is slowing taking over. ABV is very obvious in spots and in others quite smooth. Probably will be a staple in my cellar for a while"
"O/D - Subtle version of an American Barleywine. Less aggressive hop profile than usual in the style which I liked. Rich malt yet hoppy and aggressive. Good."
""
""
"Not usually a fan of american barleywines, as compared to the english version. This one, however, was quite pleasant and the hop presence was more balanced with the malts, as opposed to a bigfoot IMO. Its hard to describe some of the hop flavors in this one, as they blend so well with the other flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the best I've had. That honor goes to the one, the only Vermonster!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad I tried this. Wish I had bought another one to age for a while."
""
"O- very nice version of a barleywine. I enjoyed it."
"Overall: a decent barleywine. I wish there were more complexity here, but overall this is a well-crafted and tasty brew."
"3.5/4.5/4/3.5/4"
""
""
"M: some oxidation, some astringency, average for style and mouthfeel"
"OVERALL: This is one of the better fresh bottles of Barleywine I've had. I'm sure it will age very well also, but I wish I had a second bottle now."
"good conventional barleywine. pours a deep ruby brown color, like an overripe apple. small white head, minimal lacing. smells strong, notes of spice and wheat bread are present, as is some darker malt sweetness. flavor is nice, well rounded, this one might age well. toffee and dried fruit mingle in the flavor as well. feel is good too, bubbly and just short of full bodied. i could drink several of these, and the price was fair. overall one of the more enjoyable barleywine's ive had this season."
"This is certainly an American barleywine, and a hopped up version of one at the that. Or it could be that the malt profile is just extremely light. Either way, it's tasty, but more geared toward the hop heads out there."
""
"Reasonable, but _really_ boozy. Neither hops nor malt are sufficient to tame the alcohol properly."
"Needs some age to get interesting, but certainly drinkable now. And undoubtedly West Coast with that huge hoppiness."
"Pretty solid barleywine, and would probably improve with a bit of age. Not bad, but not incredible given some of the other American barleywines out there."
"O - This is a really tasty barleywine. It leans toward sweet but has just enough balance."
""
"There are some redeeming characteristics in this beer. Is it great? No. With the right palette, could this beer be enjoyable? Sure. Is it mine? Not tonight."
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark copper hue which leaves a two finger creamy head and lacing everywhere,the smell is piney citrus hops,boiled candy,toffee and fresh herbs,the mouthfeel is sticky and over medium bodied with tastes of sticky piney hops lots of them mixed with carrot cake,orange marmalade,xmas pudding,boozy alcohol but only a little touch,treacle,sticky date pudding with the finish being more sweet than bitter and overall a very sweet dessert brew that i could drink more than one of cheers."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side, but about average for the style. The carbonation is moderate to above average. Overall it was a good beer, but not an outstanding one. It was flavorful and very easy drinking for the style but I just didn't find that it stood out really in any specific category. It was a pretty enjoyable and drinkable beer overall though."
""
""
""
"While one could sip this beer, it is better with food. Try beef. Green Flash’s Barley Wine has enough character to explore on its own but is much more suited as an accompaniment."
"O: It's good. A bit on the sweet side and not real hoppy for an American Barleywine. Pretty easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O- Good American Barleywine. Nothing crazy or complex going on here, but has nice sweet malts and citrus hops."
"Recommended for a test drive."
""
"I gotta say, I've only had one other barleywine (Sierra Nevada Bigfoot vintage 2010, 2011), and I'm beginning to release what type of beer I prefer when it comes to these American strong ales. I personally prefer a sweeter taste, because many times these dark brews can be just so dry and woody that I just can't really enjoy a whole 24 ounces of it. This beer offers a very smooth mouthfeel blend of medium chocolate, dark toffee, brown sugar, and a soft hop bitterness. I think the lack of hop bitterness and at the same time the lack of malt grain taste enables the ""other"" flavors to really stand out to me and add to this beer in a positive way. If you asked me what the ABV of this beer was I couldn't tell you honestly, I can't really taste the alcohol. Overall I'm very impressed with the taste of this brew and I will be chalking this up on my top barleywine list! Great job Green Flash Brewing Company!!"
""
""
"Long time since I'd had a barley wine. Well worth the wait."
"DOA"
""
" Overall pretty good,above average BW. I would not hesitate to drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm not impressed with this beer. It's palatable but lacks any pizazz. Won't buy again."
""
""
""
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice stronger beer to drink on for a long time and while it’s not a terribly high ABV, this beer is more of a sipper because it improves greatly as it warms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this beer poured reddish brown. smelled of hops and molasses. the taste was different from the other barley wines i have had. it had a good bit of a hops taste to it but it also still had that typical slight fruitness of most barely wines. I really enjoyed this beer and would not hesitate to get it again. I haven't had anything from this brewery yet that i have disliked."
"overall this was an excellent barley wine, would defiantly buy it again to share with friends."
""
""
""
""
"Hardcore traditional barleywiners may be critical of what they find here, this one is certainly unique. Everything about it I like, and it's going down alarmingly quick. Another notch in GF's bedpost. It's definitely worth another to set aside for a year or so and see how it ages."
"Great economy Barley Wine. Nice amber hue. Very bubbly. Smells of hops. Smooth drinking. The 10.9 ABV is well hidden. Not up there with Cockeyed Cooper, or Mirror Mirror, but a very nice Barley Wine non the less. I may update the review later. Time for work."
"O-A good but not great barleywine that I would purchase again."
""
""
"Deep, deep red, thick head that lasts. Smells like a brewery, but I don't detect anything specific. Very deep strong flavors of wood, and barley. Strong enough to mask the alcohol, but it dries out the mouth a bit. Very interesting, worth a try but too strong for my palate."
"DRINKABILITY: This is a sipping beer, not a drinking beer. I would not have more than one of these in an evening due simply to the high ABV. I'd say that it's somewhat memorable and has a good ""wow factor"" due to the invigorating intensity of the hops hit. A good value for the money and easy to drink means I'll have one of these again every once in a while."
""

"O- Really good American style barleywine, especially for the high abv."

"Prosit!!"
"1406"
"Overall: An aggressive but enjoyable American Barleywine. I could see this benefiting from a year of age."
"O: Pretty good. This one can be dangerous, as it's an easy drinker. Good thing I only have 1 bottle;)"
"I like what I'm getting, sip after sip."
"SkÅL!"
"O- i really liked this barleywine. Awesome balance of everythung and looked fantastic."
"i may edit and add info after i finish the other half with a maduro cigar on our 55 degree night."
"O- This need another year or two on it to bring out some complexities and dumb down the slovent/alcohol bite."
"Overall not a bad barleywine, far from perfect examples like Bigfoot or ST Backburner but with a fairly strong hop base and warming 11% this barleywine is far from forgettable."
"From a 22 oz. bottle (about 4.99 at Total Wine) into a chilled pint glass, pours a deep orange-brown with a thick head. Tastes rich and full, with citrus overtones and pine undertones with an IPA-like bitterness. Some caramel flavoring underneath. It's a lot to take, but tasty nonetheless."
"O: Not the most drinkable barleywine, but interesting nonetheless."
"O: Looked and smelled great, just didn't taste good. Will try again in the future just to see if I was unlucky and purchased a bad bottle."
"All in all, a really enjoyable Barleywine. The flavors are dynamic, pleasant, and marry well together; however, another year or two may allow the flavors to turn a bit richer to match the aromas."
"O: I really can't wait to have the 2010 and 2011's I am definetly going to have them a little later on though maybe in 3yrs. If you have any 09's I reccomend holding them for a bit longer."
"O: For the most part, the alcohol is masked from the taste, however this is definitely a beer that needs to be sipped given its strength and full-bodied nature."
"Overall: A nice beer, would drink it again."
"O: enjoyable but not my favorite barleywine. Bigfoot and TAPS are more my style."
"Overall- too much for me"
"The beer pours a brown-amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the alcohol and the brown sugar. I also get some pine from the hops and some dark fruit. The flavor is more of the same. I get some cherry and plum notes as well as some pine, toffee, alcohol and brown sugar. Low to medium bitterness and a decent amount of warming from the alcohol. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. A very tasty American barleywine."
"O - Decent, but not memorable. If you like barleys and haven't tried this one, you shouldn't pass it up."
"O: Overall it is an average barleywine. A bit hopppier than I like a barleywine but some may thoroughly enjoy this. Worth the money but not something I'd likely purchase again."
"O- A west-coast barleywine if there ever was one. Big hoppy additions to a solid style base. Worth a try if you like your beers with the hops kicked up a notch."
"Overall he had made a very good suggestion and the 5.75 i paid for this bomber was totally worth it. BTW- Thank God for spell check after the ABV in this one."
"O – Surprisingly soft for the strength of the booze on your palate, with a flavor profile balanced between sweet, bitter and booze."
"Overall impression: I liked it fresh, I like it now, and I think it could go for a few more years with ease."
"This was worth the time for the aging. I will look for this and cellar a 5 or 6 of these. I highly recommend that you add this to your cellar!"
"The beer seems to be less sweet than I recall. Pine and alcohol now play prominent roles. Still some toffee, but not as much. Orange is noticeable in the aroma, but not in the taste."
"A nice tasting beer, this is good, but not the best barleywine I've had. Still, worth a try, and one which I'd be happy to have again."
"This pours a dark, dark amber color. A nice off-white thick head forms that dissipates rather quickly, but leaves it's present felt by lacing the sides of the glass. Constant streams of carbonation bubbles travel to the top for the first 5-10 minutes. My nose capture smells of bitter chocolate, caramel, small hints of bourbon, and a sweet alcohol smell. Taste of caramel, butterscotch, bitter hops, and slight aftertaste of chocolate. Also the alcohol lets itself be known. The mouthful is what I would expect of a barleywine. Very well carbonated too. Overall I'm enjoying this beer. I think I would prefer this one fresh, as I can taste the diminishing hop flavor and I'm a hophead. So I may seek a 2011 vintage bottle out and compare."
"Overall, this one sits heavy and has a lot of heat to it but, it has a nice balance of flavors and is pretty damn tasty."
"My overall impression, a strongly above average barleywine but not the best I've had."
"I would definitely consider having it again after it had some time to age."
"Drinkability - this beer isn't meant to be consumed in large quantities so drinkability is exactly what it should be, rather low. But as to whether it was enjoyable and is worth a purchase? Absolutely. If you enjoy darker, heavier beers especially barley wines this is a great example. Not as hoppy as other American barley wines but rather something in between a British and American interpretation. Rich, complex and worth a try. Damn good brew."
"Future outlook: Enjoyed this 08 version enough that I might have to grab a newer vintage to stow away for a few years."
"Mouth is complex and sticky, amazingly bright in the mouth for the hiigh abv. As many barleywines, dangerously drinkable. A lovely beer that I could either sip, or drink all day. Overall very impressed. I like what Green Flash has done with this, one of my favorite styles. Not exactly true to style, but very much true to spirit."
"22 ounce bottle, 2008 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a ruby red/copper color with almost an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is caramel malt, toffee, and some pine and citrusy hops. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of a bit of dark fruit. There's also a bittersweet finish. Although I think at this point for both the flavor and the aroma that the malt is stronger than the hops in this brew, the hops are still quite noticable and haven't totally faded away yet. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full and a bit sticky and coating. Drinkability is good, it's easy enough to drink. I think this is a solid overall brew."
"This is one to work up to if you're just trying out barleywines. Reminded me of the Rogue Old Crustacean, only less strong."
"D: I liked this quite a bit. The aging smoothed is out quite nicely. The beer was perfect for the cold night I drank it on."
"Overall: Not the best barleywine I've had. This was unbalanced and overall pretty weak, but overall was pretty unoffensive. Maybe this is better fresh, but there are too many other barleywines that leave this in the dust for me to buy another."
"This is a chestnut colored beer, with a very slight head. It smells intensely of hops...soapy, cheesy, herbal hops. Malt is prominent in the scent as well...toasted and bread-like pale malts. Melanoidin-laden scents. The taste is firmly bitter, with a lot of malt flavor. American style, for sure. It's rich and intense. Not quite as complex as many of the style, but it is powerful and rich. Full in body, and solidly good."
"Very good looking brew. Fresh citrus hops in the nose. Full on toffee bomb. Extremely balanced, especially a semi fresh one from the west coast."
"D - I think it matched well with my dinner, but I probably would not drink it again. The sweetness and alcohol mixed well with the heavy meats in the meal."
"Poured into a large glass, and watched the creamy head pile up. Smelled what turned out to be caramel and toffee notes. The taste was outstanding. This is exactly what I like in a barleywine. The sweet toffee and caramel taste with just a hint of citrus made this beer dangerously drinkable. Fortunately, I was sharing the large bottle. Outstanding."
"D- Barley Wine has never been my favorite style... but I've had a few different ones lately and am quickly falling in love with them. At $6.00 a bomber, this is a really fine ale."
"Notes: On the hoppy side of the barleywine range maybe like an American barleywine ought to be. But still it makes for a brew that although strong on the hop profile offers a pleasing malty backbone. It sure lacks nuances and complexities but while not really memorable it is a good choice."
"D: I can finish a bomber alone, which is a plus."
"2008 vintage. This is a fine barleywine that combines the big hop notes of the west coast and the dark fruit notes of the English style. I felt a couple years really helped meld the large flavours inherent in this beer but another couple in the cellar would improve it even more. The finish is long and the hops are still there to give the beer some real life in the mouthfeel. I am glad I have a couple more of these in the cellar"
"glassware- tulip"
"D- Very good. I really liked this one and found it very easy to drink."
"A good barleywine, highly drinkable now but I'm not too confident about how this might have tasted when fresh back in '09."
"D - Impressive for 10%. Quite dangerous actually as I would have no problem finishing the bomber. I plan to enjoy this frequently."
"This beer just gets better in the mouthfeel. Creamy but still with a sharp hop bite. Full body with a lighter carbonation and a sweet yet dry finish. I'm in love, and on the way to a great beer buzz because the ABV is masked by awesomeness. This was a 2010 bottle that I've aged for a few months before opening. If you see it, buy it. This is an exceptional beer and my new favorite in the style."
"Great drinkability on this frigid Oregon New years Eve..sipping and enjoying every last heating moment."
"Pours a murky, almost brown, dark red color with a medium almost tan, off-white color head. The aroma is lots of brown sugar and dark fruits. I also get hints of alcohol and toffee. I'm picking up a bit of maple syrup and strong malt profile as well. Smell is very inviting. Taste...yep, this is an American Barleywine alright! Sweet candied dark fruits linger throughout the whole sip. Strong malt flavors with caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and molasses. It also finishes with some tasty citrus flavors and bitter hoppiness. Tasty brew. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied, and not really too crisp or syrupy...kinda hangin out between the two. Drinkability is fairly high, seeing as I love me some Barleywines! Just as long as the ABV doesn't catch up to me!"
"D: Nice, fairly hoppy barleywine. Nothing over the top, but a solid beer."
" bright red, with 2 fingers of sticky white head. The Carmel, ,bready, citrusy burnt hopps. Reeminds me of Bigfoot. Just like the smell, I bet these hops fresh would almost over the top, but wonderfull as is. A very nice mouthfeel, sizeable but not over the top, drinks fairly easy considering it's nearly 11% abv. I really like this barleywine, I am very excited I have another one."
"M/D - Full bodied, smooth and minimally carbonated. This beers is a sipper. A 22oz bomber of this and im good."
"I am a hop lover so this barleywine was right up my alley. However, I do prefer barleywines to be big complex malt bombs. This definitely has the huge malts to back up the ridiculous amount of hops. This is a brew to be appreciated and respected. It's very good. Very happy I have a few more bottles to see how this tastes when the hops fade over the next few years. Time to begin a vertical."
"Drink: I'm not a huge barleywine fan but this one struck me as pretty decent. I'll certainly have to grab a few to cellar."
"Drinkability-Enormously tasty, but a huge ABV brings down drinkability a tad. Excellent single serving. Try it with Stilton cheese, dark chocolate and some fruit."
"M/D: 10.9% abv is undetectable here. The sweetness might be off-putting towards the end. Still, an excellent barleywine worth the price of admission."
"Picked this up in Illinois over Thanksgiving. Somewhat similar to Bigfoot, this bottle had been on the shelf for a while but held up pretty well. Nice barleywine sweetness with enough hops to give it some legs."
"Mouth is fairly heavy, not quite syrupy. This is a pleasure to sip. Good beer."
"-this is a good barleywine, but i remember liking the bottle better which was a surprise. would like to get a couple more years on it"
"D: The alcohol really doesn't overpower for 11% abv in the taste, you feel it fast enough. Solidly drinkable for the style, as the alcohol is unnoticeable in the taste and the malts and hops are well balanced."
"Overall - A pretty good barleywine although nothing groundbreaking... certainly worth a try though..."
"D: this is no session beer that's for sure. Loving every minute of it but cant give superhigh marks in the drinkability dept. THANKS to Green Flash for this."
"D: I finished it, but would not buy another."
"2009 vintage. Picked this bomber up for less than $5, a pretty reasonable price indeed for a barley wine of this caliber. Pours a dark mahogany color, with a big, fluffy tan head. Nice big hoppy nose, with pine needles, earthy hops and some light maltiness. This one is very drinkable, almost like a DIPA. Pine, citrus, a little caramel, but no noticeable alcohol, whatsoever (although the label tells me it is there). A very nice barleywine, especially at that price point, but not up there with the greats."
"Big Boozey beast, reminds me of a whiskey. Very tasty, but could benefit from some more aging to take some of the bite out of the alcohol and smooth it out a bit. Big bitterness."
"(D)- A good barleywine that has smoothed out pretty well thus far. Could even use a bit more time to age, but it is tasty now."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a dark ruby brown with a light brown head that dissipates quickly to a crown with a light smattering of bubbles on top of the beer. Smell has a healthy dose of malts up front with some definite sweetness and alcohol as well. Taste is sweet caramel malts and alcohol. Feel has crisp carbonation with the warming alcohol, medium to full bodied. Overall a very good drinking barleywine."
"M&D: full-bodied, lightly warming, softly carbonated, all in all a surprisingly easy drinking and richly hoppy barley wine (or, more like a darker DIPA to be honest) with good potential to age."
"A nice American Barleywine. Lots of flavour here and a nice interplay between hops and malt."
"D - Although this beer is indeed drinkable, I wouldn't have more than one in a night. Pretty good, but not the best Green Flash has to offer and not my new favorite Barleywine."
"M & D - This beer is actually quite delicious and very well balanced for a Barleywine even though the flavors are intense. Very drinkable. It is a bit dry int he body but still good and refreshing."
"2009 vintage 22oz bottle into a Hopus glass pours a murky muddy copper with a thin khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice balance of burnt caramel and citrus and pine hops. The taste is loads of burnt caramel and slight dried fruits with a nice kick of pine hops leaving a nice bitter finish. The beer is a bit heavy with slight sticky alcohol, but it is a relatively easy sipper. This is a respectable Barleywine, one I would like to try with more than one year's age on it."
"Smooth, silky mouthfeel with some dryness at the finish."
" D- The malt flavor is nice but buried under the alcohol heat and hops. Age might help the hops and alcohol settle down. The bitterness of the hops just grows and grows whereas the other flavors do not."
"Wow. A little over the top, but more in the way of excess than excellent. Poured with a nice foamy frothy. thick, tan head and a little lace. Color is a pretty, clear, orange red amber. Aroma is massive malt and hop with yeast and fruit, plus fruit rind. Flavor's like aroma and very bitter without hardly any sweetness. Body is full and carbonation is good. Finish is like flavor and quite long with the bitterness lingering for a while. An appertif maybe."
"Pours a dark brown color with a one finger frothy head which gives way to some decent patchy lacing. The aroma is of a caramel malt backbone with a slight dark fruit presence finished off with some piney and citrus hops. The taste has a caramel malt backbone with hints of toffee present. The middle of the beer has a slight dark fruit characteristic and the end is finished off with piney hops and a slight citrus hop bite. The mouthfeel is low carbonation and creamy. The drinkability is good, the alcohol burn is non existant, there is a nice malt backbone blended well with the hops. It is an easy drink for a barelywine. The flavor is slightly smashed together however, it is a good barelywine."
"Overall this was a nice BW and also another quality offering from Green Flash. Thanks again Jeff!"
"Pours a deep orange colour with a thick white head and lacing all down the glass. Smell had lots of citrus hops and caramel malt, just as you'd expect in a west coast barleywine. A wonderful balance of the malt and hops in the taste. I'm noticing some pine flavour that I wasn't getting as much in the smell before taking a sip. Very nicely carbonated and drinkable. I got through this beer much quicker than I thought and I'm glad I bought a 2nd bottle."
"Robust hoppiness hits the tongue first. There's a strong pine flavor, undertones of grapefruit flesh and peel, dark fruit, earthy notes of tobacco and leather. Alcohol is briefly noticeable mid-palate. Quite dry overall, there's a strong malt character but it's more earthy, leathery, moderately toasty. Medium-bodied with a dry, bitter and hoppy finish with faint sherry-like oxidation. This has aged pretty gracefully."
"Drinkability is average. The alcohol is well hidden, but it could sneak up on you quick."
"Overall, a very nice beer, you should try this when you see it."
"This is a pretty easy drinking barleywine. It is much hoppier than most barleywines at the sacrifice of some of the normal spicy complexities of a barleywine. It is certainly interesting both in taste and mouthfeel considering the relatively high carbonation. Overall I would say it was enjoyable and had no problem finishing the bottle."
"D: I think this would be a pretty good beer if it wasn't for the overbearing green apple flavor, that absolutely doesn't fit with the rest of the beer. Hot boozey mess even after some aging. This is the first beer from Green Flash I've truly been disappointed with. I think they need to revise this beer."
"D - just noticed this at the local beer store the other day, have been sucked in by the dipa and ipas from green flash before, but now this 2008 might need to come home with me...dont think they well hold up for another year though, but who said anything about waiting to drink them"
"Drinkablility- very enjoyable and quite drinkable, maintains a good up front malt balance with sharp hoppy kick on the back end, a rather enjoyable barley that probably even after 2 and half years could even with stand a bit more aging to be mellowed further a good effort"
"Mouthfeel is a tad thin but not watery. Its pretty harsh to drink. Hop bitterness with not alot of flavor from either malt or hops."
"D: Barely drinkable due to the above-and-beyond booze factor. I'm not sure that aging will help this vintage. Not at all enjoyable."
"D - The most enjoyable part of this brew is certainly the nose, though the taste is not far behind. This is definitely a beer that, if found in my area, would be a staple in the ol' refrigerator."
"Overall it's enjoyable but not as big on fresh hops as I'd like."
"Verdict: Green Flash's Barleywine has the typical American Barleywine character of bitter hops over sweet caramel malt. A solid example of the style."
"Note: this beer is now listed (2009 vintage) at 10.9% abv, not 10%!"
"I'd like to try a fresher bottle of this. I know some barleywines age very well, but this one appears not to have."
"Green Flash is good for two things: making great west coast style beers and making a few surprises every now and then. This is very similar to previous batches of Sierra Nevada's Big Foot. This is a text book example of how the West does their Barley Wine."
"D: Definitely a beer that should be tried, especially if you enjoy what Green Flash has to offer, or enjoy an interesting take on American Barleywine. I sat down with this guy for a bit to try and work through its signatures and after a while got them down (I think for me at least). But it should be noted that it has an alcoholic bite and should not be taken lightly. All in all enjoy!"
"One bomber and done. The sticky viscous mouthfeel and % makes this a bomber and done for me."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, medium/full bodied with some nice weight on the tongue. Very drinkable for such a boozy, assertive beer. Strong enough to keep you from gulping, but balanced enough to keep you sipping!"
"D - It gets a little saccharine after 8oz or so, so I don't think I'd want to drink a bomber on my own. The alcohol buzz also creeps up fairly quickly. Otherwise it's a pretty enjoyable barleywine - not sure if there was bad batch/vintage, because this tastes much better than some of the recent reviews would indicate."
"D - I'm not a fan of oxidation and autolysis flavors, but the beer's flavor grows on me. It's a pleasant malty taste."
"Overall, a nice representation of the American barleywine. Because it's fairly priced I may just seek out another '08 and lay it down for a year. Cheers Green Flash!"
"taste has an alcohol bite at first and then smooths out, burnt caramel, malt, pepper, some spice, and hops in the back, ends nicely bitter."
"D- Overall easy drinking. Unique by its amount of caramel malt."
"the 200- vintage was an interesting buy but i wouldnt go into a beer store with the sole purpose of purchasing this beer, but its a good beer for a sampling session"
"Overall a good example of an American Barleywine. Though not my favorite style, this one is quite good. I like it much better than Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot Ale, which is a pretty favored one of its kind."
"Another lower ranked barley wine style ale that impressed me. This one is a dark caramel color with an antique white cream cap. Big caramel and toffee notes in the aroma with a boozy character only slightly hidden. Nice heavy mouthfeel lively on the tongue offering notes of fresh toffee brittle, barrel-aged brandy, brown sugar encrusted pecans and dried fruit jam. Great example and great price-you get alotta bang for your buck here. A pleasure and a treat, recommended."
"Mouthfeel is thick and filmy and smooth. Strength of the alcohol taste reduces drinkability."
"Rich and full mouthfeel, satisfying, finishes with a tingle and an alcoholic warmth. Tasty beer, good sipper."
"Drinkability is sort of down on this one. Sort of a wet finish that doesn't beg for the next sip. It's strong and heavy. Slower drink than a lot of big beers of the sort. Sometimes the high abv will get me to chug through faster, but not here. It's an adequate example of the style. Barleywines are a style where a decently executed one is still better than a lot of beers in a lot of other styles. Value is pretty good for a bomber, so that bumps the score a touch."
"drinkability is great - i would love to crack open a 2008 to compare but this beer is 10% - however i had no problem finishing this bomber"
"Must to try this next to other examples of the style that I hold in high regard. I would not be shocked if I had to edit some reviews due to such a tasting event."
"D- enjoyable. not something id want to drink more than one of in a sitting, and not something id reach for very often. ill check this vintage out in a few years to see what its doing then. i kind of expected more out of this one."
"Drinkability: I didn't really plan on cellaring this, but I'm not upset about it. The tamed hops makes this more like an English barleywine, but its really good."
"Very heavy, but refined, a decent drinker, but over the top, need some aging. A young tasting beer, but age will not assist the flat flavor, one to try but not again given other A choices."
"Pours a dark copper with medium ruby highlights. Pretty good , light tan head and foam for a barleywine. Warm, citrusy orange peel hop aroma. Then maybe an afterthought of caramel malts and a hint of cinnamon. The orangey hop bitterness and heat from the alcohol hit first, then the malty sweetness swings by as an afterthought. Texture is hot and gristeley up front, then very slowly smoothness out to a cognac like palate. Pretty harsh flavors and mouthfeels to this young barleywine. Bitter and a little rough upfront. Would probably smooth out after at least a year of aging. But if the beer doesn't taste good young, it won't taste much better aged."
"Pours an opaque amber into an oversized wine glass one finger head, average lacing, minimal retention. Smell is predominantly citrus, very little malt. Tastes mostly of citrus hops, some sweet toffee at the end. More or less one dimensional. Mouthfeel is creamy and pleasant, minimal carbonation. Drinkability is above average, however strongly tempered by the high ABV and hops. High alcohol hop bomb."
"Overall it's pretty one dimensional. A big ole hop-bomb."
"Flavor is sweet malt and fruit with a bit of molasses and caramel mixing with some fig and plums. Finishes with a bit of a bitey hop note that is similar to some pine sap and grapefruit rind. the alcohol is hidden as the beer doesnt warm on the swallow. Quite a nice beer, well crafted and enjoyable. Definitely more US barleywine with the hop kick on the finish."
"D: Tough to drink a bomber - better shared with another person"
"D: Quite good. This one warms the throat and chest."
"M&D - a nice balance and a smooth, medium bodied beer, a standard quality barleywine, nothing to extraordinary but there is no lacking in any element, a great standby BW"
"D- Moderate. No joke. A true barleywine. The sweetness got to me after a while, but the hops helped this one ease along. I'd seek this one out again, for sure... but I'd let it sit for 3-5 years at least... this one begs to be aged."
"D-No thanks. Won't drink this again. This was close to a drain pour and would have been if it had not improved as it warmed. Demanding day at work, so I enjoyed the buzz. If ability to produce a buzz were a review characteristic, this would rate high."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle, 2006 vintage. Poured into my Sly Fox shaker glass. Appears the color of cloudy fresh brewed iced tea with an inch of creamy rust colored foam. The head leaves a thick lace covering the entire inside of my glass opposite of where I'm sippin' from. Flavors and aromas consist of prunes, quite bitter at first, alcohol is not very apparent at this age, toffee, bitter citrus peel, dark caramel. Falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with adequate carbonation levels. Aftertaste is a bit bitter. Overall, I'd say this one held up pretty well and could go a bit longer in the cellar."
"As a whole, this beer isn't bad, but compared to a majority of barleywines available I'd say it's only slightly above average."
"Poured a brownish amber color with good carbonation and a tan head. Nose is caramel, toffee and some pine. taste has shifted toward a big caramel, toffee presence but the ABV is still strong and so is the hop profile. Mouthfeel is balanced, creamy, sweet and delicous! Damn good at 2 years!"
"Overall: not right"
"D- its not as smooth as i would want my barleywines. The grassy hops take away the drinkability. Either way you want to sip this one. Overall a good brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a bite of alcohol."
"D: Dissapointing flavor and the incredibl presence of booze make this beer not all that drinkable."
"Notes: This is just a boozy mess of a beer that completely fails to work in harmony right now. It's a shame because there are some really good flavors in here, too. That vodka-like ethanol just wore me down and made it a chore to get through even a glass. And considering that I am a cheap-ass bastard in the worst way, it takes a lot for a beer to become a drainpour. Unfortunately, this one pushed me past the threshold and the rest met its fate at the bottom of my kitchen sink. What the hell happened here? Green Flash makes excellent beers, but this just wasn't one of them! Will have to revisit this to ensure that I didn't get a bad bottle."
"Green Flash Barleywine Style Ale isn't the best American barleywine on the block, but it does more right than it does wrong. If you like caramel malt, citric hops and double-digit ABVs, give this one a whirl. Bottom line: it ain't flashy, but it's as solid as granite."
"Good mouthfeel. Lots of booze and the whole barleywine qualities keep it from being too drinkable."
"D: I'd say it's about middling when fresh. A bomber is kind of a bad idea alone and fresh, but I'd certainly enjoy having this again after aging it to let it cool off."
"One of the most hop-forward Barley Wines I have had. It is Green Flash though, so its not too surprising. Also a big kick of alcohol and bitterness. Some citrus and caramel malts. Burns a little on the way down. Above average, but not very good either."
"Clear, ruddy medium brown, with a small, tan, creamy head that slowly diminishes to a thick, lasting film. Excellent lacing. The smell is of heavenly pungent hops. So resiny, with whisps of citrus and dark fruit encircling a solid, sweet smelling malt backbone. Damn this smells huge and good! The taste is not as huge up front as I thought it would be, but as it warms in the mouth the complexity comes through. Then the alcohol warmth start to show up, building toward the alcohol-heavy finish. Coming back for more sips, the aroma that I initially found to be so enticing is now a bit overbearing in a way. Still good though. It has a full body, a dry, warm, lightly-syrupy texture, and low carbonation. This one started out with high marks but then fizzled a little. The alcohol is a bit harsh (and this is coming from somebody that LOVES big beers). I had just had an Old Guardian the day before. This one probably has more complexity, but just isn't as well-rounded. I know a big beer like this going to be cloying, and I'm going to enjoy tasting this for several hours after finishing the bottle, but this one is just a little too much . Still definitely worth a try though!"
"Green Flash came seemingly out of nowhere with a bunch of beers at all the most popular styles; tripel, double ipa, barley wine, ipa- as well as some unique combos. This beer is as good as any of their beers with a good west coast take on the style, good alcohol content, great color and good carbonation. Worth the price tag if you can find it."
"Deep caramel in body with soft off-white head. Pleasant aroma of caramel, dark fruits, booze, sugar. Alcoholic booze starts the drink and stays the whole way through. Caramel sweets, malted grain, toffee, burnt sugar, hop resiny finish. Heavy body: intense on the palate and big on the belly. Definitly a night capper but doesn't quite go that well in the summer heat."
"I love a good American Barleywine, but even after a year this beer was too hot. The mix of the alcohol and sweetness just seem to fight each other and neither wins. I can't put my finger on it, but this beer just does not meld well, it seems very rough an choppy tasting. Hard to explain. I love Green Flash, but this was not their best work IMO."
"11oz sampling. Pours a thick caramel brown color with a huge frothy beige head. Smells sweet with a pleasant waft of caramel and toffee. Alcohol is noticeable, but not over-whelming. Some piny citrus scents also fill the nose. Tastes are full and extremely bold - caramel, toffee, alcohol with citrus and pine on the finish. As the ale warms, hints of ripe mango peek through the pine overtones. Mouth-feel is thick and syrupy and coats the palate well. Finishes bitter, but sweet as the malts hold up to the large dose of hops in this West Coast version of an American Barleywine. This was exactly as I expected it to be, and a very good interpretation of the style, especially speaking in west coast terms."
"Purchased from Ledgers Liquors in summer 2007 and aged in my cellar for the last couple of years. By this point, it has lost all of its hops, but still has quite vibrant malt in the nose along with some nice apple notes. With a vigorous pour there is also quite a healthy head and a modicum of lacing. Nice, after a couple of years. The taste is rich, nutty, and honeyed. The malt shines beautifully here. Amazingly, there is still a fair hit hops in the finish, with pine and bitter orange. Subtle, but bitter enough to balance the malt and toffee notes. Extremely smooth and creamy with rich notes that are seemlessly integrated and very easy to drink. I liked this young, and I'm usually not one to abuse hops by aging- this was fairly hoppy to begin with- but this beer has really, really come together. Quite nice."
"Labeled as ""2nd Anniversary."" Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a cloudy brown with a small white head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt. Flavor is super sweet, with some roasted malt and vegetal notes. Very heavy on the palate. It seems that this one has not held up over time. Ugh, not a fan."
"If you like the pine-heavy West Coast hops, this is worth trying - but otherwise, there are better examples of the style out there."
"D: this has some nice flavors. It is fruity, bittersweet, and sticky sweet at times. Overall the sweetness steals the show. Much like the American versions this has a good dose of herbal type hops in the mix and they snap at the tongue amongst the sweetness. Nice brew with plenty of syrupy sweetness"
"CHEERS!"
"Like most barleywines, this is for sipping slowly - no frat boy guzzling here. A serious beer for serious beer drinkers."
"Although it is relatively smooth for a barleywine, it still is a barleywine, and by style is more suited for sipping. Not bad, and definitely improves as it warms. One 22oz bottle would probably be the limit though."
"Pours a very dark red amber, at points it almost appears as though light does not pass through. Head consists of a thin film atop the deep dark monster. Smells sticky, piny, citrusy, malty, syrupy, sweet, standard. Taste is very bitter with a slight hint of sweet syrupy malt and some citrus hoppy notes. Mouthfeel is very thick and pleasing, drinkability is great for a brew this size."
"Definitely a sipper by definition and style but I would seek this out when needing some extra octane. Green Flash rides again."
"D - tasty, but i would not reach for a second bomber, a bit much on the taste buds, solid beer for just haveing one though."
"Pours a copper/ruby with exceptional clarity. Three finger off white head- good retention and soapy lacing. Nose- caramel and leather and faint pine. Taste- pine and juicy fruit initially, then big caramel malt. Nutty and bready as well. Dry hot finish. Carbonation is on the low side making it an easy sipper. A very sticky and pungent barlewine. Nice stuff"
"A really nice American barleywine featuring west coast hops in a starring role."
"D- It drinks okay. i wouldn't have another, and i won't buy it again."
"2008 vintage. Pours a dark red to ruby color with a well retained whitish brown head. Smells strongly of 454-infused cherries, like something served at a frat party. Flavor is a bit harsh and boozy too, with big hot alcohol and strong dry bitterness. A fairly nice balanced malt body is detectable beneath, along with some cherry and grape, but its all a bit buried beneath the hot alcohol and bitterness. full bodied. Drinkability hurt by its obvious strength. I think it just needs a year or two to mellow out maybe."
"Pours a reddish brown with a thick dense head. Lots of lacing down the glass. Great hop aroma, grapefruit citrus and toffee malt aromas. At first there is a strong malt flavor quickly overtaken by an intense citrus hop flavor. There are faint caramel flavors behind the citrus hops. The mouthfeel is very heavy. The odd thing about this beer is that the hops are so intense that they actually sucked the moisture right out of my mouth. Definitely could have used a little mellowing to take off that hop edge. I sort of regret opening it too soon. It still has great flavors though. I can see the potential, I might have to pick up another and let it age a while."
"A solid barleywine. No problem drinking this one."
"The taste is richly malty, sufficiently strong but definitely dominated by the hop flavours and bitterness. It's hoppy and on the bitter side up front, but this is not overpowering and is complemented by a strong toffee maltliness, then a gin-like element with a bitter, strong citrusy hop finish. The palate is somewhat thin for a barleywine and lively. It has solid flavour, the alcohol is not too strong, harsh, or obvious, it has definite complexity, and it's interesting. It first took a while to grow on me but it finally did even though it's not my favourite barleywine."
"Not exactly the barleywine I was invisioning, but still good and distinctly American. What good would a traditional English style be in America unless we added a barrell of hops to it? Give this one a shot."
"Drinkability= Being a B-wine, it isn't highly sessionable. This is a good beer but it had many weird aspects to it. Good B-wine, not bad."
"Verdict: I'm a big fan. This is easy to find, and available year-round. Perfectly compliments a steak and asparagus."
"D - It's big and it's tiring, but good."
"Love the green flash stuff!!!"
"Pours deep ruby with a slight head that falls quickly. Smells sweet, malty and raisinlike with a hint of alcohol. The flavor is plummy and woody, with a strong bite of alcohol and a slight flatness in the middle. It finished with hints of toffee, caramel, and molasses. It has good hopping, though the whole beer is just barely in balance. The mouthfeel is viscous with sting of carbonation. Good though not astonishing."
"Drinkability is nice for a sipper little too much alcohol just a tad. Flavor is good would be about perfect if alcohol was a touch less."
"A dark root beer color with a nice oatmeal colored head and tons of lacing. The aroma shows me everything good in beer, malty licorice and pine hops, wonderfully merged. The taste is first overwhelmed by the perfectly creamy full bodied feel. Then the malt and pine hops flavor come out and it is a great taste treat. There's a touch of Dr. Pepper sweetness. Just a fine barleywine, no doubts!"
"D - An interesting brew... A slow drinking sipper to say the least... An interesting brew, though I'm not sure it's an excellent example of the style... Enjoyable and worth a try should you come across it in your travels..."
"I'll stick with Green Flash, but not this particular style."
"Not drinkable. As I said, I'm probably not going to finish this bomber. It takes a LOT for me not to finish a beer. I don't know why Green Flash has the reputation it does. I haven't had a single beer that I would drink again from them, but at least I was able to actually finish those beers. I won't be finishing this. Been an hour since I poured it into my glass, and it isn't getting any better with temperature."
"This brew really needs to be enjoyed with a nice strong cheese or maybe meat, but is still pretty solid on its own."
"Tastes very smooth and malty, surprisingly low hop flavor from Green Flash...was kinda hoping for a hop bomb. That's not to say it is not hoppy, cause it is, but not as bright and citrusy as the WCIPA. Hops have a more musty and cheesy feel to them and the beer has more hop bitterness than hop flavor. Alcohol is noticeable, but not nearly feeling like 10%. It is a good barleywine, just not quite great."
"D - I see potential in this one but the boozy notes make it miss the mark."
"Beer poured a deep copper color with a well sustained tan head. Nose is big caramel malts, floral hops, and dark fruits. Taste is carmalized malts, cooked sugars, figs, and a blast of northwest hops. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very smooth. Drinkability is good as the high alcohol content was not noticeable at all. I am not a huge fan of the style but this is one whopper of a beer that was very well crafted!"
"2008 Vintage. Dark brown with ruby highlights. Off white sticky head. Sticky hop aroma. Delicious, great. Anise. Very ""west coast"". Wet hop flavor. Good malt backbone, puts it over the top, flavorwise. Smooth and lush mouthfeel. Half a bomber is good. Split it with a friend. Strong and full of flavor."
"Pours a pretty dark clear rep color. Small off-white bubbly head. Dark fruity fig aroma. Sweet molasses. Some dustiness too, but not an overwhelming aroma. Alcoholy brown sugar taste. Hoppy bitterness too. Creamy heavy body. Some nuttiness as it warms up more. Tasty. Aging will probably do this one better."
"This beer is extremely drinkable for its heft. I find it goes well with a nice big juicy grilled burger with an extra sharp cheddar or hot spiced cheddar and some grilled seasoned veggies."
"D - Way too smooth, this would be dangerous if I had my druthers."
"Small medium tan head, moderate carbonation. Clear deep copper brown color. Smells very much like carrot spice cake with a rum sauce(minus the cream cheese frosting). Lots of upfront pine resin, sweet clove, cinnamon, grapefruit. Ethanol is very warm throughout and competes with the bittersweet finish for dominance. Toffee and vanilla also present. Medium body. Lots of good flavors going on but alcohol is a bit hot, making it hard to finish. Might be better with some age?"
"Bomber pours clear dull copper with light tan head and sheet lacing. It has a light IIPA rather than a barleywine aroma with hints of dark fruit and an out of place pine hoppiness as well as some alcohol. The pine hops almost smell wet. The flavor starts malty and slightly sweet with dark fruitiness. Then the pine hops hit pretty hard then a pinch of alcohol also surfaces. I also get a hard citrus candy note that borders on being medicinal. Near the finish there are mild caramel and toffee notes that feel very barleywine like. I think this is worth a year or two aging and a re-rate."
"D: This brew is too heavy for more than a glass or two, but that's what barleywines are all about."
"Edit. 2010 bottle offers notably better carbonation and head retention. Appearance and drinkability adjusted up as a result. Good traditional approach to the style."
"Love it! This is a great barley wine offering lots to contemplate and dissect with very few complaints."
"D: Big & bold. Could definitely use some cellaring."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep orange amber with reddish highlights when held to light. Fluffy 2 finger Beige head sticks itself to the glass going down. Smells of citrus and resin, caramel and biscuit. Slight earthy wood aroma as well. Very malty taste, more of an earthy woody taste with some orange and pine in there. Dry finish. Very little lingers in the end. Mouthfeel is oily/creamy Body is medium, carbonation is ample. This is a really good Barley wine, not cookie cutter like some of the others I've tried lately."
"7/4/7/4/16/3.8"
"This is a good beer, but not great. Certainly a Green Flash product with the bold Hop character."
"A hard pour produces a dark brown brew with a few centimeters of head that dissipates quickly. Floral hops dominate the aroma but a little malt manages to push through. The taste mimics the aroma but with a sourish and slightly acidic aspect to the experience. The hops make themselves known through a floral bitterness that lingers after the beer has departed. A little a too sour for my tastes."
"Thanks Green Flash. The Lord bless the hop harvest!"
"D - pretty good. Definitely an enjoyable American barleywine, and I'm not going to have any problem finishing the bomber. Would recommend to those in search of enjoyable examples of the style. Not too extreme in the flavor department, but I like that sometimes (those crazy hoppy American Barleywines might as well be DIPA's...I love both styles, but this more relaxed hop character compared to many American barleywines is really doing it for me right now). Word up"
"This is byfar the worst beer I've had in recent memory. I can only hope that based on the other reviews here that there was something wrong with my bottle. I won't be spending another $6 to find out though."
"A solid barleywine, though not exceptional. Great head and reddish brown and lacey, aroma of barleywine and hops.Some citrus taste. A sourish taste. Medium mouthfeel.Would gladly have after two or more years ageing.Alcohol warming.Good caramel.Just not too unique."
"Interesting brew. Has the content of a barleywine, but is surprisingly light tasting for the same. Scent is hoppy and acidic. Strong bitterness in the taste, with some piney accents. Sweeter finish. As barleywines go, not my favorite, but it is a good beer."
"Wow, a really good brew that is pretty easy to drink despite being this big. One of the best American barley wines."
"Best beer I've ever had. It has such an intense hops presence that I would guess that it was an IPA or double IPA. For days after I was thinking about how good this beer was. It does have a significant malt flavor, but it is matched so well with the bold hops freshness that it is less noticeable. I would say its the best balance of hops and barley that I have ever had, making it a nearly perfect beer. Go out of your way to drink this beer, you won't regret it."
"purchased in 2007- no date on bottle, just ""vintage"". cellared until this evening. Appearance is dark orange, good lace, appealing. Rich and sweet aroma, subdued hops. Hop bitterness is much more prevalent in taste-- sharp, but balanced reasonably well with alcohol and a caramel sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is fantastic, very smooth and velvety. Definitely not a swiller. Goes down smooth, not too easy, very fulfilling. above-average barleywine."
"Cheers"
"More complex than this review gets across, and very drinkable despite the bold flavor and relatively high ABV."
"Green Flash makes some serious beers and this is no exception, this one changes a lot with age I have noticed too, big hop profile when fresh, then sweet and rounded with a couple years under its belt, will be drinking again, hope to try the brandy barrel version soon, recommended"
"Won't be revisiting."
"D: I couldn't even drink half a glass; had to pour the rest out. I know Green Flash is known for their incredibly hoppy beers, and I like some of them, but this one was just too out of whack for me to enjoy."
"It's a nice color for a barleywine. There is some mistiness looking through the snifter and a pretty good head. The nose is floral and sweet. The flavor is caramel with a strong alcohol presence. There is a great hop flavor with a good tartness. The hops are mostly grapefruit with the aforementioned floral notes. The beer has a pretty good feel for a barleywine, but the alcohol is a bit dominant to enjoy for too long. It could certainly improve with age."
"Overall, this is another fantastic beer from Green Flash that is highly recommended!"
"Out of the bottle this beer was a deep garnet color approaching brown. The head was huge, three fingers of tan bubbles that descended back to a rocky cap after a while that laced well. The aroma weres quite nice, ripe fruit, figs and raisins, rich hops, toffee and alcohol esters. The flavors followed suit, I was first rushed by the flavors of fermented cherries and raisins, quite sweet. This was soon followed by pine and grapefruit notes from the hops and at last the alcohol heat and caramel malt at the end. As big as it was the balance was well struck. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth helping to make it rather drinkable. Though sweet it never became cloying even as it warmed up and I think the sugars helped control the 10% alcohol punch. It was a good example of the style and I recommend it."
"Green Flash did a pretty good job with this Barleywine. It's got a good flavor, but could use a little refining. The nose is good, but could use a little work to bring out more of the flavors it has. Frankly, I love the strong hoppy flavor, but would be very interested in trying this with some age to see how it gels. As it is right now, it's almost a little too hoppy. There's a sentence I never thought I'd say. But, for the style it's true. I suspect it's better with some age. Perhaps even dramatically so."
"Overall a pretty good representation of the style, although the alcohol could be a bit tamer. Some additional time on this one wouldn't hurt to possibly smooth things out just a bit."
"Green Flash Barleywine pours a nice copper with a bubbly offwhite head. The aroma is fresh, piney grapefruit PNW hops as advertised. Some malt an ester sneak through, but are mostly hidden by the hops. Bitterness hits right upfront in the flavor, with more piney, cirusy hops. The fruity esters shine more than the malt, which is well hidden. Damn this is a hoppy Barleywine, if you told me it was a DIPA I would believe it."
"I may pick this up again, but I was not that impressed, and with this being my first beer from Green Flash, I might be a little skeptical of trying another."
"Drinkability- I'm more of a fan of the English style of Barleywine. I'm as much of a hophead as the next guy, but it seems like each barleywine I have, they are trying to top each other with their hoppiness. Still a good beer that I would have again if offered."
"This is meant to be enjoyed in small quantities and it does numb the palate a bit near the end of the glass. It also seems to get a lot dryer as you proceed in the drinking session."
"d: This was a bit of a mess and difficult to finish. They make a great IPA, but this one isn't for me."
"Drinkability: Not a bad DIPA! As a barleywine, it's definitely coming up short in terms of malt depth. Sure, you could chalk it up to merely being ""young", but I just don't see enough malt character present to really ever come to the fore.."
"Decent carbonation, but a noticeable alcohol burn and an almost unfinished character in taste and smell (especially smell) really detract from this. Perhaps this would have mellowed out with age."
"pours up a reddish amber with a decent off-white head. the nose is straight f*cking yeast!MacNasty with cheese! also though, some subtle light fruit like pears. Not that impressed with the aroma. the taste is caramel, wood, crisp hops, and alcohol. full bodied, medium crisp carbo, sweet finish"
"I love Greenflash, but this is probably my least favorite beer from them."
"Nice take on Barelywine. I like mine more hoppy than malty, and this is a malt parade. Still, it is indeed full of flavor and interest."
"A very smooth, drinkable barelywine."
"2008 vintage, poured into a liter mug. The color is medium-dark walnut, rather effervescent with a thick head forming quickly and lasting a long time. Dense caramel aroma wafts up, together with a resin hoppiness. At first taste, it's rather heavy with sweet, syrupy malt, followed quickly by a large blast of bitterness. Hop flavor has a citric edge to it. There's a very light alcoholic touch at the finish."
"Pours a three finger very light tan head that fades slowly, leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Burnt molasses nose. Flavor is molasses and caramel with a disappointing bitter finish. $6.80 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"I couldnt finish the bottle, I was just not enjoying it at all; it was just hard to drink (and I've had a fair share of american barleywines and DIPA's in my day). Way too much harsh bitterness combined with an unusual malt character lead to a beer I will never touch again."
"I think one could drink now or age it, but I like it fresh."
"D: Nothing special to write home about. I had just tried the Rogue Crustacean prior and felt it was almost a different style of beer in body and flavors."
"Dark amber with a one finger off white head that reduces fairly quick with mild lacing on the glass. Smell is roasted malt with some hops in the background. First taste is all bittering hops with a light sweet malt background. Thought I was getting some sweetness in there but this brew is overloaded with bittering hops to an extreme. Not very forgiving on the palette. Trying to get into this but not much like a barelywine in this one, just a super west coast hopped brew. Drinkability is actually kind of hard, perfume in the taste, alcohol is present with the brew lingering on the tongue. Would probably pass on this one next time."
"D - Good for one bottle which I guess is good for a barely wine"
"This one is extremely powerful in all ways. Slight coolness for a barleywine. Fine stuff that benefits from warmth-opened in the 3rd of the All-Star game and was quite cool at first but definitely benefitted from warmth-picked it up again around end of 10th and the character really emerged then."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has an excellent hop aroma that's balanced nicely with some burnt toffee aromas. The citrus hop aroma really shines through. The taste is good. It has a smooth crystal and roasted malt flavor that leans a bit on the smokey side. The hops flavor is quite bitter and works it's way all the through to the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking barleywine. I love the hop character in this one. Recommended."
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass, beer is a very deep red color with a huge, frothy tan head that leaves nice webs of lacing on the glass. Would have been a 5, but the head was just too huge for a BW. Smell is as I expected, an excellent boquet of west coast hops. Piney, citrusy, resinous hops! The taste has a wonderful carmely sweet malt start mingled with dark fruits that transitions into a warming alcohol flavor and a nice hop bite to finish it. Well balanced, yet hop forward. The mouthfeel is full bodied and the carbonation has a chewy yet smooth feel. Drinkablilty only suffers due to the high ABV and immaturity of the brew. I think that this is an excellent American BW and I wish I had bought a second to cellar!"
"Wish we could get this in FL, I'd be a regular consumer. Well done!"
"Like everything I've tried from Green Flash, the hops are the highlight. However, layers of sweet caramel and brown sugar hit first, sweeping across the tongue. Next, pine and citrus notes dominate the sides and back of the palate, while a boozy, dark rum alcohol presence finishes the taste. The thickness of the full-bodied barleywine gives it a creamy texture, although hops and alcohol do their best to make ""bitterness"" the take-home message from this beer. This is definately a sipper, and a very enjoyable one at that. I'd purchase this one again, but probably lay it down for a year or so to see how it ages."
"Overall a slightly off bittering hop makes this kind of hard for me to drink young."
"Really had no interest in drinking this one but finished it anyway."
"2008 Vintage 22oz bomber poured into a snifter. Pours a deep amber with 2 fingers of dense tan head with lots of lacing. Citrus aroma with hints of pine and malt. Incredibly smooth considering the alcohol content. Nice, complex flavors of plum, grapefruit and caramel meld into an alcohol warmth in the middle followed by a slightly sweet finish. Full bodied sipping beer with good drinkability."
"This beer is finally available in Ohio. This barleywine poured a clear dark red amber color and formed a foamy light tan head the coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, caramel and hint of pine. The flavor was of malt, hops, caramel and pepper. The body is medium light and the finish slightly astringent yet sweet. Not a lot of nuances/complexity to this one, but maybe aging it would help."
"D: A very nice drinkable beer by style with the bitterness and alcohol being well balanced making this an very enjoyable. Not terribly complex, but a solid example none-the-less."
"A definite sipper at 10%, but getting through this bomber wasn't difficult at all."
"Very smooth considering the abv; comforting and soothing mouthfeel; warming drink, really fantastic."
"Poured with a bit of chilled haze a medium to dark brown with a thinner but well retained slight off white head atop,man I love the hopped up barley wine aromas big resiny pine and a bit of pear and grapefruit mixed with heavy alcohol and caramel sweetness.First off I noticed as took a drink that the body was a little light for the style but the flavors were spot on as far as what I was expecting,deeply piney and citric with a hefty sweet malt base with some hot alcohol as it warmed.This beer packs a punch but not enough of one in the body,man this could be awesome."
"A well done barleywine. Flavor is full and rich, but balanced enough to make this one smooth and dangerously drinkable, especially considering the ABV. I will get this one again."
"D: Sip this bomber all night long and you'll have no worries at all."
"This poured a nearly opaque ruby brown with tan head. It smelled like a blend of roasted wheat and raisins, caramel malt, and floral hops. It had a well balanced flavor of cherries, raisins, and floral hops, along with molasses and caramel malt. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a brief but very bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very rich flavor with nice complexity that results in a quite enjoyable beer. This could possibly benefit even further from aging."
"A rich mahogany color with a silky tan head and some nice lacing. The nose has a big sweet malt profile accompanied by quiet hops. The taste was a little disappointing after the intriguing smell. Young for sure. Good malts, but the hops need to mature to really balance out the beer. The body is pretty good, but a little light and undeveloped. Like I said, this one is probably a few years away from excellence."
"A great barleywine for the price, and one that shows great balance despite its age. I can only imagine in 6 months to a year how smooth this offering will be. time will only tell..."
"Bomber poured into a snifter. Dark reddish brown color with a beige head of about 2 fingers. Nice lacing and retention. Aromas of boozy caramel and sharp hops. Flavor is much the same. Lots of grapefruit and caramel with an astringent finish. Mouthfeel is dry due to the high alcohol. Pretty typical west coast overhopped barleywine, but pretty tasty nonetheless. Virtually no different from a double IPA."
"Hot at this age yet, but well-crafted and another one to be on the lookout for."
"Certainly ""American", especially as there are Pacific NW hops that come into play, especially in the aroma. This is a big brew that is certainly a slow sipper. A bottle half-the-size is certainly enough to be suitable for a nightcap that will call for dream-land."
"Overall: Not world class, but nothing to sneeze at either. There are better barleywines out there but this one will hold its own with most. It packs a big bold flavor and is darn drinkable. I like it."
"Overall: delicious. could be more refined, but who the hell wants refined in an american barleywine? deeply drinkable."
"The body is big with a nice balance of carbonation to blend with the piney aftertaste. Overall this is a great barleywine that is good fresh. Would be nice to see it again in a few years."
"Pours a rich maroon color with a lasting creamy tan head. Smell is malty and somewhat bready and slightly vegetal perhaps. Taste is piney, and hoppy bit still with dark caramel like malt hiding behind that. Lasting sweet sappy piney bitterness after each sip. Pretty nice and full of flavor. Nice barley wine!"
"Old Ruffian or Bigfoot this is not, but it's a pretty good barleywine. Nothing about it says ""great," but there are plenty of good qualities it has. It's a fairly straightforward barleywine, strong but smooth, could use more hops but is not bereft of them, and is somewhat sticky sweet. Good job, and one I'll surely have again."
"Superb. I'll have to go back and check previous reviews, but this might be the best barleywine I've ever had. It does everything right, and it's a great argument for not always cellaring; it's tremendous in its young state."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Poured the barelywine into a tasting glass. It is very nice looking, reddish brown with a carmel looking head that sticks around for a while. The nose of the beer is a mix of toffee, malt and faint hops. I like the taste, but a tad out of balance. The mouthfeel is where it shines, very thick, chewy, and creamy. Comming in at 10% abv not the most drinkable, but that is a barelywine for ya."
"Recommended..."
"Green Flash has crafted a pretty malty barleywine here that is one of the more drinkable ones I've had in a while. Recommended as it's simple and tasty."
"The mouthfeel is fairly silky and tangy and thick, but not quite motor oil. Seems less drinkable than other barleywines...the 10% really creeps up during the second pour. A good one to share, or have to have instead of dinner."
"D - a really good barleywine but lacks a uniqeness that usually appears in this style. A very straightforward american barleywine."
"Pours a hazed orange/red, thick off white head, tons of lacing, thick layer, looks pretty nice. Smell is sweet, caramel, floral, honey, some yeast, molasses, grapefruit, alcohol, some citrus, not bad. Taste is toffee, grapefruit, floral, alcohol, some brown sugar, citrus, bread, pretty solid balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, some warmth but alcohol is well hidden. Kind of like the Old Blarney in that its a middle of the road but solidly drinkable American Barleywine, not off the hook but solid to the core. Thanks a lot Jan!"
"Oxidized and lacking in redeeming qualities."
"D - This beer looked very impressive but fell a little short in other areas. The sweetness really dominated the entire experience. This might be one that I would like to try after a couple years in the cellar."
"drinkability is excellent. great balance. a solid american barleywine. i wish this one were available locally."
"With a beer this big I prefer either more background bitterness to balance the sweetness or substantial complexity in the malt/fermentation by-products. This beer lacks that balance."
"Deep red colour with a purple hue, this beer was topped by a solid cap of yellow/beige foam composed of fine bubbles. Good head retention with spotty, sticky lacing. Doughy malt aroma with some toffee, grapefruit pith and a bit of pine resin. Moderate, lingering bitterness. Lots of caramel and toffee flavour, with some dried fruit, grapefruit and pine towards the end, with alcohol in the finish. Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. A bit dry with some warmth. Tasty and quite malty, plenty of hops without overdoing it. Good stuff."
"Body and carbonation were both good. Definetely drinkable."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" tan head over the slightly cloudy reddish amber brew. Thick head holds on strong, with plenty of thick lace. Aroma is sweet yet citrsy. Taste is candy sweet, also countered by ample citrus hops character. Alcohol taste is hidden, but there's no hiding the warming. Mouthfeel is wow smooth, and drinkability is way too easy. Hella nice BW."
"The taste is malt-candy up front, and then gets more and more bitter. Very well balanced brew. The bitterness is a tad aspiriny at the end, but this doesn't detract much from my overall enjoyment of the beer. And those dandelions are in the taste too. The alcohol is out in the open, but doesn't come across too hot like it can in certain other barleywines. Everything is melded pretty well."
"I look forward to getting another one of these. A great barely wine and a good example of the West Coast style. Recommended."
"D: this is a solid beer that initially takes some self-endurance... but after you get over the 'hump'... this beer is a true coaster that will keep you reguessing its flavors/taste."
"Drinkability  I thought the booze was a bit too strong for an ale that seemed to want to impress with its balance, but otherwise this was a good drinker."
"Drinkability: I have been on a Barleywine kick as of late and I think that this is one of the best that I have had. It is a very nice balance of weight, alcohol, and drinkability."
"Surprising hop pop in the aroma, mingling with the caramel and BW malts. And again in the quaff, citrus hops actually dominate over the malty sweetness. Guess thats why this is an American BW  duh. But this needs more of a malt kick to make it a good BW."
"d: this heavy barleywine had decent hops but could use more carbonation. a good one nonetheless"
"Appears a deep clouded plum amber body slightly clouded forms a large cream off white forms thick lacing evenly strung. Aroma has a deep caramel plum and raisin tartness with fresh cut green apples and vinous grapes, touch of a woody character a bit herbaceous. Flavor is raw and herbaceous very upfront in your face with west coast hops, pine, and citrus with herbal qualities a flowing. Fruity alcoholic with charred caramel and brown sugar sweetness. Again some tree bark qualities with unwavering hop bitterness throughout much not as pure extreme grapefruit as their DIPA. Mouthfeel is big full bodied malts with oily raw resinous textures galore. Drinkability is nice a unrefined not as established west coast barleywine that really reminds me of Big Foot. Great stuff glad that I sampled it, the more I try from this brewery the more impressed I become."
"This didn't live up to my expectations but to be fair, i was expecting something in the mold of Great Divide's Hercules and i got something more akin to Young's Old Nick. Don't let that stop you from trying it..."
"This is really up there on my list of drinkable barelywines. Paired fantastically with tonights BBQ chicken (nothing but Sweet Baby Ray's). Luckily it's readily available in my market, because I only picked up one, and that won't cut it! I'm sure it won't cellar poorly, but this is really so fantastic right now, I'm not sure I'd bother...might have to pick up a case for snowboard season if my home-brewed BWs for this year don't turn out as good, which I can't imagine they will!"
"The beer pours a somewhat misty mahogany brown with a portly off white creamy head that settles slowly, leaving the lace to coat the glass. Nose has a nut like sweetness, malt and caramel back it up with a hint of the hop flowers, start is quite sweet, nice malt feel, and a bit of alcohol bitterness, top is moderate in feel. Finish continues the sweetness, the alcohol evident and the hops provides a nice spiciness, a tummy warmer for sure, somewhat dry aftertaste with a lingering sweetness, a decent barleywine, and worthy of a sample."
"In terms of drinkability, for me, I've had more enjoyment from other types of BW. Mostly because of the hop bitterness being a little strong. I will try this BW again. Certainly a more aged bottle, less cold to start. Because of it's bomber size, perhaps smaller bottles would be nice; so as to avoid feeling a little ""forced"" to finish off the bottle."
"Gotta love a bomber of barley wine for $3.99. remember what those tiny bottles of Old Crustacean used to cost?!? This one pours dark almond amber into an oversized DFH snifter, under a nice looking deep tan head that is initially puffy, then simmers slowly to a thick and mottled bubbly foam, leaving respectable, fine lacing behind on the glass. Nose is the expected wiff of sweet malts, doughy bread and some alcohol. Sweet, nutty, pleasant,heady and malty brew. Quite smooth, as the malts flow over the tongue, warming alcohol present, and snarling in all its glory. Bottom line....should have bought a case of this stuff instead of just one shimmering and tasty bottle...oh well..."
"Drinkability is good. This is a pretty nice barleywine. Not the best I've had, but it's very solid and well made. Not to mention the price is pretty good at $5 for a bomber."
"D: Not bad for a barleywine, though it did take me over 2 hours to finish the whole bottle, one of the better American barleywines that I have had. As an aside, at one point, it felt like I was drinking a weaker version of Sam Adams Triple Bock, the malt sort of has that feel, if you know what I mean. Overall, a very good barleywine from Green Flash, I enjoyed it."
"Like the IPA it is very sticky and an appealing barleywine for hop heads. How is this a barleywine as it seems to lack the malty quality and seems more on the Ruination end of things with a heavy Simcoe-like touch here? I tried this one a second time and now sense the malty quality in here which is like a quilt in a tub of hops. The resin and pine needle aspects are especially strong and I suppose the caramel malt backbone here is a bit more pronounced than their IPA. There is some vanilla and molasses there but the hops blow the loudest horns. I would love to blind taste test this with their IPA as their Imperial IPA seems quite mellow compared to the two. Bottle from State Line in Elkton, MD for $4.99."
"Poured into a chalice a nice brown/amber color, nice carbonation, nice small one-finger plus creamy tan head, which then leaves some nice creamy sticky lacing then some nice small islands. The nose is malty, hoppy, slightly spicy, good dose of caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, slightly spicy, and some caramel. The finish is slightly dry and bitter. The alcohol is hidden pretty well, with a nice warming effect. Medium body, a well rounded brew. Drinkable, a very nice BW, true to style, recommended."
"While American Barleywines often feature hops this one is a little over the top for me."
"Drinks a little slow, could it be the 10% ABV??? Yes, that & the intense hoppyness. Folks that dig big & hoppy will really like this. Me, I require a little more balance. Maybe this needs a year or 3 to mellow out??"
"A very nice American Barleywine. if you like Bigfoot, you will like this one too. Really nice looking beer. Ruby / amber color with a big head that hangs in there. Leaves a lot of lacing. Smell a bit less impressive than Bigfoot, but still gives a hint of hops and pine. Taste is very good. Hops bitterness (not quite as rough as fresh Bigfoot) and pine / resin. Absolutely no hint of the 10% abv. Knowing the alcohol level and size of the bottle (man rule: finish what you started), I sipped this one. Tasted just as good at the end as it did up front. The strong taste holds up well (for hop heads) and is never overpowering or ""too much"". Not a session beer by any means, but 22 oz over an hour or so goes down real well. This one is a winner."
"An OK Barleywine but far from an outstanding one. The flavor could be more complex and less butter flavored for a start. Worth $5 a bomber to try once but no real reason to seek this out or spend lots of money to obtain."
"This Barleywine poured a hazy medium brown with very little foam and some lace on the glass. The smell of roasted malts and pine smelling hops filled the nose. The taste of roasted malts and piney hop were very evident. Also, a hint of bitter/sweet coffee and a caramel was there, but, not really anything to write home about."
"Bottle courtesy of Naven: Poured a medium brown/burgundy color ale with a great foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt and light dry fruit is offset by some west coast hops. Taste of sweet caramel malt and subtle dry figs is balance with some citrus hops. Body is about average with some great carbonation and no alcohol was noticeable. Well done and I have to confess that I did enjoy this even though I usually prefer my barleywine with more malt profile then hop profile."
"From a 22 oz bottle this poured a rich red to brown color with a medium and spongy off-white head that left good lacing. Big rich nose of caramel and fruity hops. Morhtfeel is smooth and hides the alcohol well. Flavors of caramel, fruits, and some bitterness. Good dry bitter finish. Overall a well balanced and delightful barley wine that should only get better with age. I need to get some more of these for the cellar"
"D: The abv is huge, limiting the number of times that you can go to the well with this one. It's a good, big mouthfeel though and easily one of Green Flash's better offerings."
"d) i used to not like barleywines but this one brought me around. this is maybe my third or fourth bomber and it's consistently tasty."
"A bit less complex than many American barleywines. Could use a bigger nose. Certainly enjoyable."
"Overall, it's too over the top in alcohol and bitterness. It does get a bit more drinkable as you go through the bottle."
"Don't drink and review."
"On tap at Mad Mex Robinson: I see a commonality to the reviews of this beer from this location. I love barleywines, but this was simply the worst that I have ever had. The color was good, being a dark ruby colored brew, with a small off white head. The smell was something else. It didnt smell bad, but it did smell like root beer. The taste was predominately of root beer. This was close to undrinkable. Yuk!"
" Bud"
"Pours a dark murky brownish copper with a good sized buttery yellow to cream colored head. Strong citrusy hop aroma, pineapple, some alcohol evident in the aroma and a light fruity and berry sweetness. Taste is also quite hoppy with strong citrus notes and a big bitter and dry finish. Malts are evident in the background with some nice caramel bready sweetness and a hint of pruniness. Big dry and bitter finish also shows a quick warming alcohol pinch. Fairly rich and creamy soft with a medium to heavy body. A very nice barleywine, at first still somewhat cold it was very dipa like but as it warmed, the nice rich body and some malty flavors came forward. Very nice agressive hoppiness is great fresh but I imagine this one will age well. Thanks Christian for the opportunity."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a deep dark brown with a little hints of orange when held up to the light. There was a small white head that disappeared quickly. I am picking up the smell from about a foot away from the glass, very fruity; apples, oranges, some grapefruit and a little pepper. The biting alcohol dominates the taste, there is some cherry and strong bitterness. There is long lasting bitter solvent like aftertaste. The solvent is really turning me off."
"Bought a bottle at Fatheads in Southside Pittsburgh. Poured a nice bubbly head, and had a light caramel color. Aromoa of frswh hops, very green. Same with the taste, lively hops and malt, could use some aging, if green isn't you. smooth somewhat sweet mouthfeel. Like was said prior, it does make you want to lay down and nap, but hey, that's a good thing sometimes."
"Starts of with a sticky thickness that almost immediately gets dried up by a bitterness that scorches the palate. Citrus fruits, spicy hops, piney needles and sap. Sweet caramel malt background, but not one that plays a large role. Quite a hoppy barleywine, just as I like 'em. Extra long sticky citrus laden bitterness that finds it's way into the aftertaste. Abv is up there, so one of these is about all for me. A very nice bitter, alcoholic, hop bomb without the huge spicyness that's associated with barleywines. One I would love to get my hands on again."
"Bottom Line: Great ""22oz and go-to-bed beer."" Tasty, soothing, sleep-inducing."
"Deep scarlet red tone. Great clarity. Frothy and thick dirty white head. Lace comes in sheets. Aroma has some sweet malts and citric hops. Fairly light nose though. On the palate, the hops are grassy and resinous. Malts produce a nice sweet base. The alcohol is barely noticeable. A little fruit punch feel to it due to the nice fruitiness invloved. Body is about medium or so and the mouthfeel is smooth. Decent enough barleywine, but I like the IPAs from Green Flash better."
"This is a very well balanced barleywine. Definitely a good winter sipper. While I mentioned it's tasty young, I'm sure this one will age well. I'll crack my next bottle in a year."
"Drinkability: Honestly, I'm not sure what kind of a beast this barley wine is, but I love it. The ABV is extremely hidden, the taste is balanced beyond belief in its green state. I think this may actually be detrimental to lay down (as it's fantastic fresh), but alas, I'm very interested to see what will happen, and I'll definitely be buying another bottle or two to see what happens in the future."
"Notes: This is a pleasant surprise. Definitely a nice sipper here. I'll definitely pick up a couple of bottles to age as it is fairly harsh alcohol-wise. Still a nice Barleywine fresh, let's see what a year or so does to it."
"Dark, ruby red, almost brown, with a thin but soap-like head. Subtle smells of citrus and toffee, chocolates, a little alcohol. More citrus in the flavor followed by a cereal-like barley flavor and flowery notes with a little bitterness. The only complaint I have is that it gets too easy to drink as it warms."
"Cheers."
"Recommended."
"Nice chewy mouthfeel kicks off this barleywine, that improves as it warms, developing a rich chocolate flavor that is cut by some hot alcohol. Dark, ripe fig essence battles with a floral hop bitterness in the finish."
"I have one more in the cellar which I will come back to in about 6 months or so. Curious to see what happens with this one. All told I'd lean towards enjoy it fresh versus aging."
"Drinkability: decent barleywine. Worth giving this a shot."
"Beer is good. Happy big beering."
"Bottom line: This is one solid BWSA that I have no qualms about recommending!"
"The 10%abv is more perceivable in this beer more so than in some other American Barley wines I've had but I don't really think it takes away from a good level of drinkability in this beer. Nice well proportioned amount of sweet biscuity malt to try to balance out the big hop profile in this west coast American Barley Wine."
"D - I would have guessed this was a Double IPA, in the hoppy vein of Pliny or Hop Wallop, and not a barleywine. But I love it either way. I like it more than almost any double IPA or barleywine to date. In fact this is one of the best beers I can remember having. This is so easy to drink and tastes great. The smell is enchanting. I love this beer. If you love hops, seek it out."
"D- It would be alright if I wasn't in the mood for a barleywine (like I am now). The smell of the pine is overwhelming every time you go to take a sip."
"This is a good beer. Too much for me to enjoy on any sort of regular basis, but it's good stuff nonetheless."
"Looking forward to sitting on the other bottle for six months or so...could benefit from a bit more sweetness for me."
"Thick, full body goes down nice and smooth. I really like this one, even if they are pushing the boundaries of a barleywine. I wish I had another one here now. Drinkability is up there for me, but if you're looking for a chewy malty barleywine I would suggest you let this one sit for a while or grab the next one down the shelf."
"It's fundamental, basic, and quite good, though I do wrestle with the exceedingly bitter finish, which borders on gratuitous. In the end, it's just a minor distraction, not a disqualification. the ABV is well-incorporated, flexing smoothly and with a soothing warmth. So, the wince-inducing finish be damned, it's a hoppin' sweet good time."
"EDIT: The more I drink of this, the more DIPA-ish it becomes. I would just like more malt character from a barleywine. I'm starting to think this won't age all that well, but I'll hold onto a bottle nonetheless. This is great in the way that Stone 10th is great... but for a barleywine, I'm not quite sure yet. Perhaps a second bottle will answer my questions."
" Palate is well-balanced between sturdy caramel malt and a ton of grassy, floral hops. A sweet raisin character emerges mid-palate, then is overwhelmed by a building alcohol presence that continues to grow long after the swallow. The body is surprisingly and disappointingly thin for such an otherwise huge beer. Nevertheless, this is a pleasure to drink. Watch yourself, though; while it's unlikely this could ever ""sneak up"" on you, it is pretty powerful stuff. Plan ahead - this should probably be your only beer of the evening."
"Notes: This is a healthy offering, sturdy, big and complex. Basically it is what I want in a barleywine for the most part. The only downside is it could pay a bit more attention to the depth of the malts. Hop profile was awesome. Mouthfeel was nice and I am craving another one as soon as I finished this one so Drinkability has to be up there. Second best offering from Green Flash and that speaks volumes."
"It's enjoyable either way. It's just not what I was expected."
"Muted ruby in color. Nice, slightly tan head-great lacing on the glass. Hoppy aroma upfront-sort of raisen like, malty sweet. Very grassy-after it sits a few take a big ole whiff-screams lawnmower!! Big balanced blast of hops and malt in the flavor. Hops extremely pronounced-floral flavors, not a lot of bitterness in there. Syrupy sweet in spots-like liquid caramel. No alcohol evident. Nice, full mouthfeel-as big as the hops are, theres no hashness in the body that you sometimes get. Damn fine brew. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Great representaion of the style. This, Great Divide's Old Ruffian and Sierra's Bigfoot could be a ""holy trinity"" for me."
"Big beer with big flavor that packs a punch...not a good beginners brew into the world of ""craft brewing", but one that strong ale drinkers can appreciate...cheers."
