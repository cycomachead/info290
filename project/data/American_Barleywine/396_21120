4.19,-2.6,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Rating #1,100!!! 2012 bottle from trade. Thanks dude! Pours dark reddish amber with a small yellowish khaki head. Aroma of hard candies (like the kind on the outside of candy apples), brown sugar, toffee, biscuits, a small bit of vanilla, oak, and some whiskey. Flavor is very similar to the regular version up front: hard candy, toffee, biscuity sweetness. But the finish provides something new: notes of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. The difference from the regular is rather subtle and maybe that's because this has been in the bottle for 2 years or so. Slick and thickish bodied, low carbonation, but not quite syrupy. This is a very good beer, but I must say, I am a bit disappointed at the lack of barrel influence here. I was expecting a big oaky vanilla infusion here that I didn't really get.","BMMillsy","Mar 14, 2014"

As is, it's a bit too ""in your face"" with the bourbon and heat to thoroughly enjoy more than a four ounce sample. It's delicious in extremely small doses; the flavors are excellent and work well together, but it becomes clamoring and cumbersome in larger ones due to its heat.

Maybe this one would hold its own against the aforementioned when they were both aged differently (the aged Old Numbskull I had was an '07, as well), but nonetheless ... this one's simply lacking in a few places, with the bourbon (or the aging) covering up a few of the really nice notes that I got out of the non-bal version.

Aroma is a strong worn leather aroma, somewhat salty, some rich tobacco and sweet prunes mixed in as well. Alcohol is evident in the aroma as well. Taste shows some of the leather and salt notes but they are much more mild then in the aroma. Some decent sized bourbony bite following the leather and pruniness, a good amount of vanilla as well as a fairly strong drying woodiness before a bite and warmth of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium, low carbonation keeps it thinner on the tongue, good amount of drying wood and biting alcohol in the finish. An outstanding barleywine, aroma is incredible, the taste is powered quite a bit from the barrel ageing and the alcohol is big as well though never too much.

Rich bourbon cream aroma, resplendent with cherries, raisins, hints of milky chocolate and dark brown rum cooked with bananas. Ruby pour, with orange-yellow fringes. Hardly any head. Flavor is along the lines of the arom, with rich, creamy and almost oily sugar tannins, lots of tawny, pear, raisins and sweet cream vanilla, intended for oaky sugars. Quite light on the carbonation, which is a bummer. Theres a sweet tinge of euro-like hops along the backedge, but it makes the old hop presentation moan, as this is more subdued and to my liking. I enjoyed the light oxidization character of this beer, as truer to the plummy, raisin-like sweetness characters of the style, but without carbonation and some warmth noticeable from the barrel, I dont find this a phenomenal improvement over the straight version.","CharlesDarwin","0"

3.46,-19.5,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Bottle # 212. Very aromatic and the wood influence is unmistakable showing hints of oak, vanilla and bourbon along with the malt, which shows a bit of caramel and burnt toffee. The excessive aromatic hops in the regular Old Numbskull has tamed to an almost undetectable level. In the flavor, the hops have again tamed and the wood is clearly evident. Notes of bourbon, oak, caramel and toffee with a touch of vanilla. The body and texture is lacking. This should have been aged in a wine barrel. A bourbon barrel was not the proper vessel for this beer.","Crosling","Oct 20, 2005"
3.11,-27.7,4,3,3,3.5,3,"This beer has mostly become a vehicle for the barrel flavors, what flavors that do peak through from the Old Numbskull play a supporting role to mitigate / round-out the oak flavors. I bet you a mixture of half fresh Numbskull and half this beer would be quite tasty, there would still be a big hop and malt presence to balance out the barrel contribution. As this beer stands it does not have enough balance nor complexity to be great. I have never been a fan of barrel aged beers for barrel aged beers sake; I really prefer a bold beer flavor with the supporting role being played by the barrel character. In this case the barrel character plays the lead role, and somewhere down there in the supporting cast there is an aged version of Old Numbskull.","Gueuzedude","Apr 10, 2005"

3.45,-19.8,3.5,3.5,3,4,4,"Bottle#124/225Amber and slightly orange like colored body which is cloudy and yielding only a slight scattered film on top. Lots of bourbon in the aroma almost overpowering with vanilla and oak. Malt is buried.Vanilla, bourbon in the flavor.. Body is full and velvety smooth. I think Id prefer the original much better. The bourbon just overpowers everything else.","BierReise","Dec 24, 2004"
4.25,-1.2,4.5,4.5,4,5,4,"Rubyish orange to medium brown, hazy. Good color really. A light off-white cover tops it all. Big peppermint bourbon aroma. The regular numbskulls fruit salad (integrated melon, pineapple, cherry, banana, mango etc.) aroma is there, soaked in alcohol gently. Elegant woody riped fruits counter adequately the pencil shavings dryness emanating from those luckily subdued hops. I doubt I would enjoy the blend if hops were as straightforward as in the regular numbskull. Soft liquid caramel, subtle and smooth palate requires lips licking swiftly though its not cloying in a bad way. Very low carbonation contributes to the smooth feel. Full bodied, minty, earthy finish. Satisfying sipper from skilled craft brewers. Bourbon is the focus though, but the silky palate carries it well enough that its worth seeking even if youre getting tired of those and I admire the retraint of those hops showing just a slight piney gap. I dont know if age would really help that one. Its pretty well integrated as is, its alcohol components are warming and fitting the sipper state. Im glad to see I enjoyed it as much as the regular though. The bourbon aging has worked very similarly with this than with speedway. Thanks to Alex for sharing!","Rastacouere","Dec 12, 2004"

4.5,4.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Brown/garnet hue with a very faint off-white head. Aromatics are loaded up with an oaky vanilla character. Big alcoholic bite in the flavor, sweet caramel, roasty chocolate, dark dried fruits, cherries, vanilla, honey, oak & bourbon, there is huge complexity in this one. Mouthfeel is full, sticky and syrupy, more carbonated than I was expecting. The alcohol bite in this one is pretty intense, but it is a good sipper... makes you feel all nice and warm as it goes down. Overall, this is excellent.","kmcnair","0"
