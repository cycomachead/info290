"Totally solid barleywine - appreciated most the caramel and vanilla undertones."
"Overall -  Very good.  Strong bourbon barrel.  I will have it again."
"2015 Vintage.  Appearance in the glass is a very unattractive murky brown color with a thin khaki head.  When held up to the light the beer transforms, displaying a very cloudy yet magnificent ruby red body.  Caramel and toffee dominate the nose, dark fruits, booze, subtle barrel notes.  Taste is extremely boozy, unbalanced.  Seems like a beer that requires at least a half year to develop in the bottle.  Getting the same toffee and dark fruits on the taste with minimal bourbon and vanilla.  There is an earthy/musty bitter hop aftertaste.  Need to track down another bottle to age and (hopefully) appreciate more."

"Absolutely fantastic ! Really, this is what fans of BA beers are looking for. Wish I would have had this around a month ago when it was -15 degrees . . . Warming. Been sipping this for an hour and fifteen minutes now."
"Recommendation: Somewhat overhyped for me. Way better BA Barleywine options out there. Would try to get a hold of their Bourbon Barrel Stout or Cherry Stout instead. Those are fantastic."
"Overall: I was a little wary of the barrel aging, uncertain of how strong the bourbon flavors would be, but actually it came out as a traditional, nicely balanced and complex barleywine. The alcohol is definitely a big player here and is stronger than I prefer. Especially considering the price I would rather get a pack of SN Bigfoot, but this is a nice sipper."

"This thing is kind of a monster. Like a monster that's coated itself with caramel and smacks you in the back of the head when you're not looking."

"Overall truly delicious, probably the best barleywine I have had"

"Drinking a 2014 and wow is it drinking good!  One of my favorite Barleywines!"

"O: This is a very, very good BA Barleywine. The bourbon is not too overpowering, but blends insanely well with the base beer. Bourbon and vanilla become more prevalent as the beer warms. Top 5 BA BW for sure. Easier to acquire and cheaper than Sucaba, and is in a better format for when I want to have a single 12 oz instead of opening a 750 mL. Recommended!"
""
"Great taste light and refreshing. Great bsrley wine"
""
""
""
""
"Sweet Caramel goodness with a bourbon kick. Fantastic!"
""
""
"O - Overall this is awesome. Easily on par with Firestone's Abacus...easily. And much more accessible. I will pick up more before it's gone this season, and this will be my go to for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good fresh but can't wait to see what some age does to this beer.  To be continued......"
"Very solid beer, sweet but not overwhelmingly so, very complex, has all the delicious flavors  one would except from a fine barley wine such as Toffee, Dates, and vanilla. it is just a tad on the boozy side, i think a year on it would go a long way. overall this was a very good beer and i'd definitely recommend it to fans of the style."

"2015 Release bought today. I had 1st had this last year and was waiting for this years release.  Pour some into a snifter, put your feet up in your favorite chair and just enjoy. It does not get better than this in my experience. Not for the faint of heart, but oh so good on a winter's evening."

"Good barleywine, really enjoy what the barrel adds to this one"
""

"This is a decimate sipper but so enjoyable.  One of the best barleywines I've ever had."
""
""
""
"Worth the trade though"
""
""
""

"Boozy and hot...  Potential is here but this is like barrel aged rubbing alcohol...  Perhaps it's too young?  Going against the grain here and giving this one a very mediocre OK..."

"Overall: Heh, this brew gets me excited, every time I smell it. This is one of the best Barrel Aged BarleyWines, no lies no gimmicks. It sucks that I can't get this brew regularly, yet it keeps me hoping for the next release of  Bourbon County Brand BarleyWine. The mouthfeel holds this brew back from dominating BCBBW. This is now one of my favorite Bourbon Barrel Aged BarleyWines. This is Recommended."

"Nice sweety caramely aroma. Lots of grainy bourbon smell. Dark amber in color. Poured with a nice fluffy head. Great tasting beer. Very sweet. Lots of alcohol burn. Really can pull the bourbon barrel age out of it. One thing to note, I’m drinking mine at around 55° temp. My gf has hers refrigerated. Both are great. The colder one is slightly smoother with less alcohol burn, but not as flavorful. Another great solid barrel aged beer from CW."

"Overall, this is one tasty brew. Like I said, not as heavy as I expected it to be. The alcohol doesn't hit as hard as you might expect from an 11.5%er. Wonderfully sweet. One of the best caramel flavors you'll ever see. I'm not normally a huge fan of bourbon barrel aged beers, but this one is a must-have."

"Overall, I would put this up against any Belgian quad or dark strong for the beauty of its complexity, and overall taste. I've read that it gets even better with age. Well, I've got three more bottles and I may pick up more in the next week or so. This is heading for the cellar."

"Overall, this is a damn fine barleywine that affords an extravaganza for the senses. From the seductive aroma to the bombastic taste, there are no false steps here. I appreciate how Central Waters didn't try to go too hop forward like some American barleywines, instead opting to let the malt and bourbon take center stage. A sipper though it may be, that only serves to prolong the enjoyment. The only other barleywine I've tried on par with this is Sucaba, so that comparison should pretty much speak for itself."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I much prefer Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Stout to the barelywine. It is far too harsh for my liking."

"2013 bottle from Homer321 poured on 5/21/14. Big thanks man! Pours murky brownish amber with a small creamy yellow khaki head. Big caramel toffee aroma with vanilla, raisins, dark fruits, sweet smooth bourbon, oak, very slight oxidation. Flavor is sweet caramel bourbon, oak, dark sweet fruit, and a huuuge vanilla marshmallow finish that lingers a good while. Plenty of carbonation and a chewy body with some nice booze bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice, sweet barleywine. Dark fruits and sugar dominate the flavor, making this a nice, dessert beer."
""
"Overall, the bourbon is really up front on this one. . but the 2014 vintage crushed the 2013 vintage that I had about 3 months ago... maybe this beer is truly better fresh. An excellent BBBW"

"2013 bottle. Amber, cloudy appearance, which merits a careful pour. Excellent oaky vanilla nose, slightly pungent, one of the best noses on a beer. Sweet and subtly sour taste, which I think stems from a noticeable yeast component. No hop presence. Oaky sweet finish. Gets sweeter and oakier as it warms to room temp. This beer never disappoints."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it is a great example of what a barrel aged barleywine ale should be."
""
""
"O: got this in a trade from ba user kevsal and I am super greatful. I will be looking for this again. All bourbon barrel barleywines pretty much win my heart. Has a phenomenal smell and a pretty awesome taste to go with it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not as sweet as I expected but that leaves it a little more drinkable for a big beer. A very solid example of the style. I wish more beers like this were available to me locally. Also, for a 2012 beer this has a surprising amount of hop bite."

"A pretty delicious and deliciously drinkable powerhouse of a beer. Beautiful looking: a cloudy orange-ish brown. It looks like your dream of a barrel-aged barley wine. Mouthfeel is somewhat thinner than many barleywines but wonderfully creamy. Taste is surprisingly smooth - the aging seems to iron out the coarseness I find in many barleywines. Vanilla is the most prominent flavor. There's really just a hint of bourbon, which is a big plus in my mind, and the alcohol taste is slight as well."

"It comes across like a lighter fw Sucaba or bcbbw to me(and not as good as an overall brew) but very nice if you want something similar and ""lighter"" (maybe not the best descriptive word). O well, recommended!"

"On draft at the Local Option. Pours a cloudy amber with a substantial head. The nose is sweet vanilla and rich caramel toffee: at this point, I'm ready to take a bath in this stuff. Taste delivers what the nose promised: lots of sweet vanilla bourbon up front, then transitions into caramel maltiness, and finishes with a strong tart hoppiness. Very tart and hoppy on the end. Mouthfeel was a delight: chewy, creamy, and somewhere between medium- and high-carbed. A fantastic BA barleywine: it has all the best aspects of a english-style BA barleywine up front, and the intense hoppy tartness you see in american barleywines provides a great contrast at the end. So good I had to order another!"
""
"This promises to be one of the elite with the appearance and aroma but falls short in the flavor category. The oak and bourbon heat dominate the palate. Some dark fruit and sugars present themselves mid palate but then fade to just sugar, oak, and bourbon. Still a very good Barleywine, just not in the same league as Sucaba, MOAS, etc."

"O: Another good bourbon barrel beer from Central Waters. A little age might mellow this out."

"Beers like this are difficult for me to rate. It's clearly a well-crafted product with an abundance of intense flavors and marvelous aromas. Unfortunately, even though I enjoy American Barleywines, I'm just not a huge fan of aging these in bourbon barrels. I find that the bitter hop flavors clash a bit on my palate with the sweet, boozy notes and the malt is not allowed to work its magic. (Now English Barleywines - good gracious! Those are custom-made for bourbon-barrel-aging!) Nevertheless, I continue to try these as I come across them (or as wonderful traders - like Ri0 - bless me with their generosity) in hopes that my palate will eventually accept them."

"Very nice beer from Central Waters (which is what I've come to expect from them). My only complaint is that I really didn't pick up a whole lot of bourbon, etiher on the nose or the palate. Otherwise, this is a very fine beer from CW."
""
"Central Waters's Bourbon Barrel Barleywine Ale is an interesting and complex beer that makes for a perfect sipper on a cold winter night. I aged my bottle for a year, but I feel that even more time might help mellow out some of the booziness and the bitterness on the finish."
"so there does exist a barley wine that lives up to its hype, and it is this central waters offering. hazy and rich caramel colored beer with an awesome white head over an inch tall and lasting all the whole time. it smells like caramelized grain sugar, raw sugar, toffee dessert, and booze, but only just enough. the nose and taste both suggest ridiculous barrel influence, i mean, tons of vanilla, tons of char, tons of everything, sugars too but its not too sweet. i get good bourbon all the way through, with that oaky earthen character and all the vanilla in the world, while the booze remains way back, but persistent enough for me to want to let this warm and drink it slowly, although neither the body nor the sugar makes this hard to drink. smooth down, long vanilla finish, like creme brûlée in many ways, to rich for a ton of it, but highly appreciated in reasonable doses. a good twelve ounce to share, and finally a central waters beer worthy of its high praise, this is wonderful barleywine, as good as american made english style gets."
""
"Lots of bourbon flavor, especially vanilla, but the hops cut into the sweetness making it extremely drinkable. not as dry or hoppy as some other american barleywines so it can taste a little sweet, but this is great. almost no head whatsoever. Hopefully i can manage to age a few of these."
""
"Overall: Very tasty, boozy barleywine. The wood and vanilla flavors are offset somewhat by the hops so it's not just a bourbon fest. Nice changeup from the bourbon stouts I've had during this long winter."
""
""
""
""
"O: overall I enjoyed this beer. I am going to lay several down as I think 9 months to a year will do wonders. I am have been disappointed by most of Central Waters beers but this one is by far the best I have had from them and with a touch of cellaring, this has potential to be awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this beer was great fresh, and is still great after one yr in cellar. I have 2 more bottles of the '13 that I will open after 2 and 3 yrs and see how they progress (I am thinking this beer is only going to get smoother and smoother with time). Delicious offering as always from a great Wisconsin brewery. Nicely done Central Waters."

"O- This is not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination. I did enjoy it. However, it was too similar to a standard barleywine. If this was a standard barleywine, the smell and taste scores would be higher. However, reviewing it for what it is, this beer leaves me wanting more influence from the barrel. Perhaps age helps this beer. If I get my hands on more, I'll lay a couple down for a year. A good beer. But not amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a murky brown with a small off white head. Smell has tons of bourbon with vanilla, toffee, carmel and sweet malts. Taste is like the nose, lots of bourbon with the other flavors in the background. A little boozy. Medium to light mouthfeel with lower carbonation. Overall a very good Barleywine that if I had access to would buy a lot."
""
""
"Overall: I look forward to this release every year. A wonderful boozy but balanced sweet take on a barrel-aged barleywine."
""
"Have another 4 pack in the cellar and looking forward to seeing what its like at 6 months and on!"
""
"O - I had this to do a comparison with Insanity. This was less harsh and more mellow and sweet compared to Insanity. I would have thought Insanity would have been less bitter since it is an English style, but the bourbon was too prevalent in it. Going to age both and see how they are. I do recommend this one."
"Overall - This is a pretty good BB barley wine and hopefully the booze mellows out with some age on the bottle. It has a lot of potential."
""
""
""
""
"Superb drinking BA barleywine. Despite the abv, it doesn't seem overly hot to me, although you do feel it as you chug it down. (Sip, don't chug.) To say this is well balanced is correct. All elements come together nicely, preventing it from being too hoppy, too boozy, too sweet, or too anything else. Just a solid and delightful beer that's more drinkable that you'd expect. Very nice."

"Thank you, pmarlowe for this outstanding extra. Pours a deep amber with a thin tan head. Good retention and lacing. Heavy bourbon on the nose along with dark fruit and biscuity malt aromas. Sweet bourbon throughout the palate, offset by faint hop bitterness. Heavy mouthfeel with lots of alcohol heat and little carbonation. Overall, this great BA barleywine is one that could lay down for a few years."
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber orange and cloudy with light tan head. Smells is super sweet bourbon with alcohol coming through. Taste is fantastic!! Sweet brown sugar, big bourbon with slight tang. Heat lingering well after swallowed. Mouthfeel is clean and a little silky, not as silky as their Y2K, but very nice. Overall this is another Central Waters to seek out if you like this beer style you will not be disappointed. Picked up a case and will be aging some of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Woodman's only had 2 cases of this dropped off on Thursday; I bought two 4 packs and think I may need to go find more to age. I recently had a couple samplers of the BC Barleywine and this definitely is right there with it in terms of overall quality and complexity. VERY impressed."

"Another awesome Central Waters beer! So nice and smooth, this is one of the better barleywines I have enjoyed lately. Pours a reddish brown with a small head. Big notes of bourbon and mash! I soo wish that CW was distributed in my area! Overall....awesome!!"

"O: A big malty barley wine with an organically natural tasting barrel flavor thats great for sipping on a cold winter night. Cheers CW, keep up the good work."
""

"bottom line, if you like strong beers that overwhelm you with oaky bourbon flavors, buy more than one of this guy."
""
""
"O: One of the better barleywines out there. I bet aging makes this one unbeatable. Share with friends."
""
"Verdict: A delightful Barrel Aged Barleywine from Central Waters, and one of their finest products. The body really doesn't do this beer justice as the flavors are so spot on, perfect marshmallow toastiness. It reminds me a lot BB4D, which is one of my favorite beers to date."

"Overall: I don't think this is an American barleywine. It's more akin to a British barleywine. A nice barleywine, not too unlike Weyerbacher's Insanity though thinner; not unlike Lost Abbey's Angel Share but half the price. I picked this up in Pennsylvania last week but only got one. I'lll buy more if I get back down there sometime soon."
""
"Overall: I like this beer, although it is hard-hitting in the strength department. I'd say, though, that it needs more than just one or two years to mellow."

"Sampled from a 12ox bottle. Thanks Surge1311! This is a big, boozy beer. In fact it might be a bourbon with a hit of beer. The aroma is strong bourbon. The flavor follows with a rich malt backbone. This beer is flavorful and intense. I think the bourbon dominates too much but it's a fantastic beer that leaves you with a lot to think about."

"Pour is more of a dark auburn with a fairly tall head. Smelled the bourbon right when i cracked it open. Great aroma. Bourbon with earthy hop notes along with chocolate. The bourbon is upfront in this, so if thats not your style you may not like it. Almost a sweet taste to the bourbon. Maybe a caramel. Great brew all around."

"O- Very bourbon-forward barleywine; sometimes I find this one to be a bit too hoppy but time always does this beer well."

"Overall: One of the better barleywines I've had in a while. As a bourbon fan, I really enjoy the barrel accents in this brew. It stands out but is in no way offensive. By far the best Central Waters product I have had. They will get some more opportunities after how much I enjoyed this one."

"The appearance is dark red-brown with a thin tannish head. Its` nose comes off with malts, a good deal of bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar and raisins. Tipping this one back and it tastes of caramel, syrup, more malts, alcohol. Mouthfeel is rich and full bodied, finishes with oak and bourbon. A nice barleywine from this brewery out of Wisconsin, had to pick this one up while passing through PA."
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a hazy brown color with a cream colored head. There was a decent retention as well as some lacing for a while. There was some oily legs on the glass as well. The smell of the beer is boozy, lots of ethanol on the nose, hints of vanilla and caramel. The taste of the beer is sweet, malty with more vanilla and some subtle hop bitterness. The mouthfeel smooth, oily, moderate carbonation and kind of thick. Overall this beer is really quite good, big amounts of flavors. Has a lot of the characteristics of a solid barley wine. Worth trying for sure!"
""
""
"O - I think this will really round out in about a year. The hop bitterness is not bad, but the front it so mellow that the moderate hop bit at the end seems more pronounced. I think with some time, this will move from an A- to an A/A+"

"O - The best 12 oz. BA BW I have had to date. Not as refined or complex as the rarer examples, but this is a totally unforgiving bourbon bomb of a barleywine and I like that a lot!"
""
""
""
"O - this is a perfect candidate for the cellar, but I don't think I'd get another one fresh, even on tap. It hits hard and bitter."
""
""
""
"The beer pours clear amber red with about an inch of cappuccino-colored head. Head died quick with only a little lacing. Sweet, smoky, fruity and exciting. I can clearly smell honey, vanilla, and oak. A full, rich nose. Flavor is pretty boozy at this point. Not a ton of heat, but there is a huge bourbon flavor. The flavor also matches the smell, but I love that the barleywine is not too sweet. Very good profile which will be amazing with some age. Creamy, medium-bodied, and leaves syrup on the tongue. Already and very good beer. I can't wait for the booze and heat to mellow out. It will be fantastic."
""
""
"O: A fantastic barleywine that is complemented very nicely by bourbon barrel aging. Best bourbon barrel aged barleywine I've tried to date, although I do have Sucaba and barrel-aged Bigfoot waiting in my cellar. I inherently hate Central Waters for their terrible customer service, but they make a damn good BBBW"
""
""
""
"D: this would definitely be a prime candidate for cellaring. as soon as I took my first sip I thought maybe I opened this too soon. oh well, live and learn. regardless, there are some really good aromas/flavors going on here that im sure would develop some nice complexities over time. grab a few if you can."
"O- Overall this is one of the better BA Barleywines I've had, and I can't wait to have some more!"
"O- Lay her down and I think this will be great in a few years. She is surely hot to say the least and strongly bittered to boot."
"2013 vintage served in a snifter. This amber-ruby beauty pours w a half-finger of khaki head that recedes quickly and is retained w decent legs and spotty lacing. The aroma is of burnt brown sugar, figs, and rum-soaked raisins w a hint of vanilla. The flavor is caramel, smoky bourbon, and a lot more hops than other reviews would have led me to believe. I'm sure this ages well, but this is pretty hot fresh. Still very very good, and worth the acclaim."

"O - Great barleywine, perfect for sipping. A bit boozy, but I like that."
"O - This beer seems a little young and could use a bit of time to really tame down and let some maltiness come through better. The booziness is getting a little too much for me. All in all, the beer has complexity and I would love to age one of these bottles to see what it can morph into."

"This really hits the spot. Complex melding of flavors. Was thinking of sitting on a couple, but really drinking well right now."
""
""
"Notes: Much more of an English BA barleywine in my view. Nice for a sweet sipping beer that definitely presents bourbon flavors but isn't too harsh. Nor does it necessarily rely on the bourbon (although I'm not sure if it'd be anything special as a regular barleywine). It's a nice treat, but it isn't anything earth-shattering for the style."

"O: slightly boozy for 11.2% abv very very nice. the caramel and vanilla flavor is amazing"

"Overall: This is a fantastic brew…a pure sipper, I’m sitting here watching the Oscars and it’s perfect…it makes me want to start a fire in the fireplace…the straight barley wine flavor playing the support role here would outshine most other brews by itself, but the addition of the bourbon barrel aging gives it a sophistication deserving of a snifter glass…boozy, straight forward, intoxicating, this brew is deserving of its allusiveness…I was lucky to snatch it up when I did and thankful I have a couple more to share, it’s no surprise this is one of Central Waters highest rated beers…a top shelf brew that’s well worth the price, if you get the chance to taste this, take it…I’d love to see this on tap somewhere just to see what a little more carbonation and head would do to the overall package…fantastic! (4.5/5)"
"A fine barleywine. Probably the best thing I've had from Central Waters."

"O - a wonderfully beer, I will be ageing my other bottle for a bit to see how the beer settles into itself. If you can get some, please do! This is my first Barrel Aged Barleywine, so maybe I am just a bit overzealous, but this is wonderful."

""
""
""
"Thin flavors, but they are good. Vanilla, caramel, wood, bourbon and earthy pine. Sweet baked caramel is ever present. The bourbon barrel provides smoothness. Yet it doesn't mesh well with the other flavors. The hops have faded, to be sure."

"O: Fantastic beer right now, super excited to let a few age. Definitely one of the best barleywines I've ever had."

"This is a great barleywine. Drinking kind of hot right now but not a bad thing at all. I'm anxious to see how it mellows out."
""
"Overall: A very well done BBA barleywine. The bourbon presence is balanced nicely with the caramel malt, dark fruit, and bittering hops. While it certainly isn't anything earth-shattering as far as BBA barleywines go, this really is a phenomenal beer given the price."
"I would say this is much more refined and delicious. After having the Goose Island BBW this ain't too bad. Alcohol has toned down considerably and the cloying is abated. Smoother and palatable. Review scores considerably higher with age. Not quite GI English BBW worthy but you know us American barleywines gotta have da high alcohol presence, damn fine nonetheless."

"Finally got to try this beer after the past two that were sent to me as extras broke during shipping. Third time's a charm! 2013 vintage. Pours a ruby amber color with a small, off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is much more citrusy and hoppy than I expected. At first I get citrus hops and bitter aromas, followed by sweet, bourbon booziness. Kinda reminds me of the BA Bigfoot I had a few weeks ago. Dark fruit aromas and a bit more bourbon. Taste is hoppy as well...very interesting. After reading reviews of this beer, I was not expecting this. Maybe I drank this one too soon or the 2013 version is more hoppy? Citric, hoppy bitterness up front...immediately followed by delicious barrel flavors. Lovely bourbon with vanilla, coconut, and toffee. Not very boozy for what the ABV is...very smooth. The combo of the hoppy bitterness, the citrus, the bourbon, and the oak make this one quite enjoyable. Drinkability very high. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated, smooth, and full-bodied. Overall, I don't know what it is about this beer... but, the only other ""hop-forward"" BA barleywine I have had was BA Bigfoot. I can't imagine the base beer for this one being as hoppy as regular Bigfoot... I'm so confused right now. This beer threw me in a direction I was not expecting, but it was very delicious.... I guess I'm somewhat disappointed because I was hoping for a BA barleywine that wasn't ""familiar"". Can't rate it on that though."

"O - A FANTASTIC barleywine! A FANTASTIC BEER! One of the best beer's I have had. Extremely well balanced! Great fresh, but can't wait to put a few years of age on the bottle."
"O: A very interesting bourbon barrel barleywine. Very strong and sharp flavors. Quite hoppy, enough to not get drowned out by all the malt and bourbon (which are pretty substantial). Pretty hot right now, further intensifying the flavors. A sipper for sure, but definitely an enjoyable one."

"O - A real treat, Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine is one of those vintage releases each year that must not go unenjoyed. It's rich presence carries from aroma to flavor though the smooth feel rounds out the alcohol nicely for a bourbon barrel beer that's quite drinkable fresh. This one will still age with the best of 'em."
""
"O - Solid BA Barleywine for the price with a lot of barrel presence. This is definitely a sipper and with all of the bourbon one to have on a cold night. It's main downfall is that the bourbon really shines and make the beer a bit too hot instead of blending in well with the base beer."
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. I can tell this is a fairly young offering despite the label indication being a bit of a misfire. The alcohols is out in the open with flavor and solvent/numbing character inside the mouth. I think this would be a good one to lay down for awhile. While I enjoyed it now, I bet it would get nothing but better with some age."
""
""

""
""

"Mmmm, this is what I am talkin bout! The bourbon soaked wood, oxidized sherry flavors and sweet malt come together damn near perfectly. The mouthfeel is bigger than the 11.5% would indicate and is awesomely rich. ABV is so well integrated at this point, it is very smooth. This is awesome, one of the best beers I have had in quite some time."

"O: I thought 3.5 years might have done this a disservice, but it's still going quite strong. If I lived in WI, I would stock up on this and age it to this range. This is far better than fresh Mother of all Storms. I will say, though, that despite my gushing about it, I had Arctic Devil after this and had to drop this one a few points because AD is just that much better and rounder. Still, a recommended beer."

"12oz bottle courtesy of HopsMatt, thanks bro! Initial smell of the bottle is the same as sniffing a Jack Daniels or Crown Royal bottle: pure whiskey. The beer was an amber color, scant head. The aroma from the glass was more subdued bourbon with notes of vanilla. Flavor was vanilla, heavy booze, whiskey, caramel, decent but not great. Mouthfeel was a bit thin. I would not put this in the upper echelons of bourbon barrel barleywines but it was a decent offering overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really happy to have had this at long last. A lovely, complex sipper. That being said, very glad to have another bottle that I can sit on for a year to see if the alcohol heat lessens."
""
"A beautiful finger-and-a-half of dense, tawny head that left beautiful lacing in its wake as it fell. Color was a hazy deep-amber. Nose caused the back of my head to blow off! Coconut/vanilla bourbon melded with sweet malt to create a hot, boozy melange that seared my nostrils, filled my sinus cavity and when I stupidly struck a match to see what was going on, ignited, blowing out my brain housing group. Wheeee! Mouthfeel seemed to suffer from CWBC Disease, i.e. thinness, but the heat of this darling erased all downfalls. I had a Come-to-Jesus moment as it initially had the heat of strained and lit Sterno on my tongue. I was initially overwhelmed, but upon recovering, I got tastes of coconut/vanilla with a big caramel malt sweetness. Where did I score this? Oh, for another bottle or two to cellar ..."
""
""
"O: A good beer with plenty of potential, but the heat is still up there IMO. I would like another bottle, but I would like it to sit for a year or two."
""
"i gave a bottle of this to my dad and he said it made him stop liking craft beer. i guess my dad's getting weirder now that he barely drinks anymore (due to heavy doses of heart medication), but he had a point. he was expecting a barleywine mostly, and he barely tasted it. all he got was bourbon, and that's mainly up front in this one, but the malt bill is still there, and let's face it - barleywine is about malt. the thing i don't get is he used to be a big scotch and bourbon drinker when i was a kid.. he just said he was grossed out because there was bourbon mixed in his beer.... but he didn't complain when i gave him my homebrew blackout stout (made with applewood and oak bourbon chips). i guess the moral of the story is, don't drink this if you just got out of the hospital and are expecting a non-bourbon flavored beer."

"Overall - Excellent beer, if not the best BA barleywine out there. A consistent standby that I almost always have in my fridge."

""
""
"O - This is quite good right now, but will no doubt get even better with age. The flavors are all there, and great, and the alcohol, though noticeable, doesn't need much calming. Bourbon barrel-aged barleywine is one of my very favorite styles, and this one is good enough to stash many away for future cold and rainy days. A very well-done brew."
"One word - Outstanding! This beer is wholly enjoyable and actually showed me another side of bourbon barrel aging that I hadn't experienced previously. I love it. Do I love it as much as I love, say, King Henry or Mother of All Storms? Well, I'm hard pressed to give an answer on that. I might have to have the three side by side to determine a favorite. In any case, very well done bourbon barrel aged barleywine. Also, I suppose you could call this one ""hot"" or ""boozy"" at this stage. Personally, I enjoyed it like that, but I'm thinking it should start to mellow after little while (say 8-12months). Might even hit a sweet spot. Can't wait to try them down the road a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I do think there is a very good beer in here, but it is so masked by the alcohol that I'm having a hard time tasting what lies underneath. I'll get through it alright without a struggle, but I would lay this down for a bit before attempting it again."
""
"Overall very nice, delicious, great bourbon that brings lots of flavor without overpowering, delicious vanilla, sweeteners, fruits, malts, and even a long spicy earthy hop that brings nice bitterness and has held up for almost 2 years. I wish I could get a lot of this beer. I wouldn't call it my fav bourbon barrel aged barleywine, but it's up there. Again right in with my top 3 styles."
"Overall: A very nice barrel aged barleywine, but not in the same league as KH, Sucaba, and Leon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: With all the flavors here it would have been easy to allow one to take over and tip the balance, but at no point does this delicious masterpiece go too far in any direction. Beer Advocate encourages reviewers only to use 5s when a beer is truly exceptional - and this is one of those cases."

"This one pours a medium bodied cherry wood brown with a one finger beige head. The nose is pretty balanced. There is oak, vanilla, caramel, molasses, and even some red grape character. The flavors too are complex and it drinks an off dry. The flavors are sweet and malty, featuring dark red fruit, a good amount of oak, vanilla, toffee, and a moderate amount of alcohol. Pretty solid and more balanced than I expected. It drinks big and sticky with a good amount of wood and alcohol in the aftertaste. Overall I liked this quite a bit. It's better than the majority of barrel aged barley wines out there."

"Overall, very enjoyable brew! This one could be all-world w/ a few years of age in the cellar, as it was a bit hot for my liking."

"Cheers!"
"Morey's Bottom Line: A BIG BAD Barleywine to be sure! If you don't like big beers, this isn't for you. Plenty of bourbon and warming alcohol following each sip. A bit more on the earthy side than most English-style Barleywines. It's somewhere in between American and English."
"O: Amazing beer; I was concerned that I hadn't aged it long enough when I gave in to opening it tonight, but it's certainly already an amazing beer to drink. Have a glass of this if you're lucky enough to be in its distribution range; you won't go wrong. This rivals Hoppin Frog's Naked Evil for my favorite barleywine to date, and very well may have just overtaken it."
"O - Great beer from Central Waters. They're doing wonderful things with their barrel program."
"Drink- Its a very tasty and solid 12oz. Love the fact its single serving. The booze is very well layered and doesnt over power. Glad I have a 12 to hold onto until next year."
"O - A very enjoyable barleywine, I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to try this."
""
""
"This is a tasty beer in all aspects. Big, bold flavors and with a fuller body and better carbonation, this beer would really shine."
"Overall I really loved this beer. A great example of a Barleywine and on top of it they barrel aged this one to perfection. Thanks to TIMMYJ21 for this. Highly recommended you pick this up in a trade or off the shelf if you are so lucky."
"Now I need another 3-4 bottles to sit on, and see how they are in a year or two. Great Barleywine!"
""
""
"Picked this up thanks to a gentleman visiting from Milwaukee thus week. Tastes like a clone of Abacus, which is to say I think it's delicious. Pours dark brow/ruby with a creamy white head. Smells outstanding - vanilla, toffee, and bourbon predominate. The flavor follows, but is a touch too hot and boozy for my taste, resulting in a slightly diminished score. Body is fairly thick with perfect low to medium carbonation for this style. Overall, a great beer. I wish it was just a little less hot."
""
""
""
"Overall this is one delicious beer. Complex array of flavors keeps my palette intrigued in taking sip after sip. My only regret is that I didn't ask for a couple bottles to cellar as I think this will only get better over the next few years and beyond."

"O: A bit two dimensional caramel and bourbon, but some brown sugar sweetness comes in to add a bit to the complexity. Stays fairly dry. Solid."
""
"O - One of my favorite barrel aged barleywines to date. I wish there was more of this around, but I am glad I got to try it. Highly recommended."
"O: Awesome nose, and potential for a great flavor profile, but this one needs some time on the shelf for the booze to mellow out.  It really is quite dominating throughout most of the drink, and takes away from the flavor intricacies.  Interestingly, I recently had the non barrel aged version of this beer, and didn't note it to be particularly boozy at all.  I do however, think that one was a 2011 bottle.   I would like to get my hands on a couple more of these, throw them in the cellar and come back in a year or two,  I think they could be great then.  "
""
"O: Awesome. One that I look forward to having again soon."
""
"Poured into a tulip. Pours a cloudy mahogany with a thin beige head on top. Nose is bursting with bourbon, wood, vanilla, toffee. Really nice. Smooth feel. A bit heavy, but for the style, that's okay. This beer is like liquid butterscotch. Some caramel, toffee, vanilla beans, sweet bourbon. Double dang. This beer is amazing. This beer is meant to be consumed fresh from my experience. Loved it. Thanks, Wyatt!"

"Flavorful barleywine, tasty stuff. A little bit of carbonation could help stir up more complexities but no complaints here. Nice way to cap off a night."
"Not a bad beer, a little bit much as warms up."
""
""
"D - I love bourbon and vanilla notes in beer and this one doesn't disappoint, I could drink this all night but with the high ABV this is a nightcapper for sure. Extremely drinkable even with the big ABV."
"O: Fantastic BA Barleywine in the smell and flavor department. Big sweets are not cloying, as the bourbon really cuts it and the body isn't over the top. Could definitely use some more time to let the alcohol settle down though. Glad I still have a couple left, I will revisit them in a year or two."
"O: This beer could have been so much better, imo if it had a thicker body and a bit more chewy feel. Very good regardless though. I obtained two bottles of this through a trade and I plan to age the other bottle for about a year or two to see how it turns out. Hopefully the booziness weakens while bourbon aroma remains. Great beer."
""
""
"Exceptional BA-Barleywine, although I would definitely put this one in the English Barleywine category (it's not the barrel aging that makes it American as Weyerbacher Insanity would prove). Will let the other bottle weather for at least a year or two. So far, I'm really digging this brewery. Wish we saw them in Pennsylvania. Highly recommended."
""
"Medium to full body with excellent carbonation, helps to lighten it up and brighten flavors. There is a bit of heat on the back of the throat on the swallow and in your belly, but an excellent sipping beer."
""
""
"From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Food and Friends in Philadelphia. The strength is homage to the virile flavors. Thank you for the late-night sipping pleasure!"
"O: I was not expecting this to taste like it did being that it is classified as an American barleywine. I expected more hop bite but got more sweetness that I get from the English style. Since I tend to enjoy the English version this was a pleasant surprise to me. Overall I really liked how the alcohol and the bourbon are not overly dominating but do play nice with the sweet and oak characters."
"Poured from 12oz bottle (2011 vintage) into a snifter glass. Pours hazy and dark red appearance with a small tan head. Decent thin lacing throughout. There was a rich, thick caramel, bourbon aroma along with dark fruit like plums, good amount of toffee, and vanilla. The flavor is quite rich and fairly boozy from the bourbon especially when the beer warms up, but nice. There’s a ton of dark fruit- plums, figs, dark grapes, dates- in the flavor along with a ton of vanilla, oak, sweet booze, and toffee. Sticky medium mouthfeel. Overall a very fine example of a barleywine. Look forward to the next try!"
""
"One of the best beers I've had. If King Henry is a clear cut above this...I really gotta try King Henry."
""
"OVERALL: Didn't live up to expectations at all. Though quite boozy, the flavor is definitely there for the taking. It's a shame that the body is too light and abrasive to really let the flavors take center stage. Again, like other Central Waters' brews, the look and feel fail quite miserably. Still very happy to try this highly acclaimed beer though, so thanks again for the chance SliverX."
"O: I'd be happy drinking this all year. Very solid -bal barleywine."

"O: 3.5 / I preferred it fresh."

"O: A surprisingly great Barleywine that I can see only getting better with time."
""
"An absolute knockout of a brew. The price is a amazing for the quality of the product also. A sipper for sure, but an absolute pleasure of one."

""
""
""
""
""
"O= CW does a great job with their barrels but after trying a number of their barrel aged stouts they don't seem to be able to get the base beer right making it a barrel drink to me. This does both of them correctly. The barlywine is a fine base and the barrels are outstanding. This is the barrel aged beer I've been looking for from Central Waters."
""
"Wow, great great great barleywine. Glad I have a few more. Awesome use of the barrel."
"O: I'm not generally a huge fan of the super-heavy beers, but I appreciated this one as a kind of nightcap, sipping it over a long period of time."

"O: It's a solid beer. A for me, for sure. Central Waters barrel program is killing it for me."

"O: Not quite the beer I was expecting, but I must admit, it is much more drinkable than most bourbon barreled beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Big, sweet, burnt, sugary and boozey. The whiskey character is a little too forward which is obscuring the base Barleywine. Surely some aging is in order. Overall it's a rather tasty English Barleywine even with the booze."
""
"O - This beer starts out with a very warm and inviting aroma . The first thing I noticed was a nice alcohol warmth followed by a little bit of bourbon and lots of caramel. Very smooth for a bourbon aged brew . Loved it ."
"Pours a hazy burgundy with a modest off-white and lovely, thin beading. The nose is pretty massive - caramel, dark fruit, booze, toffee, some licorice, sweet grains, quite a bit going on, evolving with warmth. The taste is big on the sweeter, darker malt notes. The barrel does play a very dominant role but it definitely brings the beer in a different direction. The booze hits harder than I would expect which was also the case with their BA stout. Very good, nonetheless."
"O: I haven’t had many barleywines cause I don’t really enjoy the style all that much, but I found this one very, very good. This would pair especially with some cheese and not just cause it’s called a barleywine. Instead of cheese… I had popcorn."
""
""
"Bourbon Barrel Barley wine pours a deep redish color, with a nice white lacing head. There is a very full sweet wine like smell, very bousey. The taste has a strong wine like grape flavors, and a strong wood like flavor, very strong alcohol flavor. Its way to booze to enjoy another one, and hard to drink. Overall a very interesting barley wine. Might need to be aged for a while."

"Absolutely one of the best -bal barley wines I've ever had. Despite it's rich character, it never gets overpowering sweet and the bourbon is integrated perfectly."
""
"O- I was really impressed with this one. Worthy of the praise it recieves. The only problem I had was drinking it. It tastes and feels great but it is a sipper in every sense of the word. I m loving sitting down at the crib with this one on a sunday night."
"O: Wow, I'm a BW fan and love barrel beers. 5's are very tempting. I like the base Kosmyk Charlie's Catastrophe Ale and barrelizing it is just awesome. Might be too boozy for some, but high on my totem pole."
"Why we drink beer."

""
"O: This beer definitely improved in the bourbon barrels. The taste was more balanced, easier to drink, and overall more enjoyable. Both are good beers, this one is just better and I would seek it out again. 4"

"Pours a ruby amber with an off-white two finger head. Aromas of oak, dark fruit and hints of bourbon and booze are clearly present. Caramel malts dominate at first and become much more pronounced as this brew warms along with black cherries, plum, and fig. The finish is slightly sweet with bourbon notes and booze. Heavy body supported by huge malt backbone, syrupy with a perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, a wonderful BA barleywine and the perfect sipping brew. I'm laying a few down in the cellar to enjoy next winter."

"This ber is a ruby red rusty color. Short just off white head recedes to a film and then a ring around the glass fairly quickly. Aroma is very caramel and burnt sugar forward, with some coconut and vanilla from the bourbon barrel. There is also some toffee and a bit of fruitiness. The flavor is very sweet. Bourbon and caramel forward with some nice biscuity malted milk ball character. The main attraction here however is the big sweet caramel paired with a more vanilla and coconut bourbon character. Mouthfeel is big, heavy and sticky, but a nice bit of carbonation lifts the beer up and keeps it from being cloying."

"Thanks to Duff27 for this one!"

"O) I don't drink a lot of barleywines, and this was my first barrel aged for sure. Having said that, I found this quite impressive, and would certainly seek it out again."
""
""
""
"O Really great beer, especially given its price and availability. I was blown away by the quality of this beer. Drank it next to the base beer, Y2K and, while both great, you can really see the advantages of barrel aging."
"An enjoyable, heavily bourbonized, sipper of a barley wine. Fruits and caramel sweetness come out very well, with the hops and wood providing a nice finish. Bourbon notes are clear and complex. The big drawback here is how hot it is. And that it is represented in the aroma, flavor and finish...it constantly reminds you how hot the beer is. Maybe some time in the cellar would have helped. Too bad I only have one."
""
"Overall: More so than most Bourbon Barrel beers (which are often Stouts), this is truly a showcase for the Bourbon, making the beer secondary. This makes for a mighty tasty Barleywine, but one that is slightly hampered by sweetness and alcohol."
"O: A solid barely wine, but a bit overly bitter in the finish for me."
""
"O. Expected great things from this, and it delivered. Smooth easy drinking barleywine with a ton of depth and flavor."
""
"Overall: A bit rough around the edges but ends up being good. Drinkable and not too heavy"
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good barleywine here. It definitely needs some age as it drinks pretty hot right now. Lots of nice flavors, though, and an assertive hop profile to boot."
"O - Overall, I liked this beer. I wasn't blown away by any means, but having the ability to have a bourbon barrel aged barleywine of this quality on a constant basis is nice."
"D: This is an excellent deal. However, it could use a little more work to integrate the flavors properly. I'll definitely keep chasing it down in the future, but it's not a beer I need in large quantities. I like this approximately on par with Abacus; this one is more flavorful and less boozy, but Abacus has a better finish. The cost tips it in CW's favor."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It's probably the most bourbon forward bw I've had, to the point it could almost be mistaken for a bourbon but for carbonation. It's a great beer to cap off a night."
"This is a very fine barleywine. I'm going to let my remaining bottles sit, in the hopes that the bourbon kick in the finish will mellow out. I find it darn tasty, but a bit hot. The base barleywine is quite good on its own, and it shows through well here, and blends well with the bourbon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent barleywine and I hope it gets even better with more age. If only I can hold on to this a little longer."
"O- This is a really good Barleywine. All the big, sweet, malty, biscuity, hoppy flavors are present in mass quantities. The touch of oak and bourbon finishes it our really nicely. For how hefty and boozy this beer is, its pretty drinkable."
"Notes: Complex as all hell, with full body and a ton of flavor. At 11.5%, alcohol is definitely a factor in its drinkability. A true sipper. Needless to say, now that I have tried this brew, it is hands down the best release I have ever had from Central Waters. Truly well done! I'll be searching for this one next year, and buy a few to age as well."
""
""
"O- Much like Central Waters other Bourbon barrel aged beers this is a brew that Whiskey/bourbon lovers will truly fall in love with, especially if hard liquor is there go to drink, because this beer definitely packs a noticeable punch. While I did enjoy this beer I find that I don't really care for the taste of bourbon in a barley wine. I would personally say that the bourbon flavor almost slightly ruins the delicious taste of Charlie's Y2K catastrophe ale (which I am pretty certain is the barley wine used for this). Because of the high price of this beer I don't think I'm going to buy this again, although that all depends on how this turns out since I plan on aging a bottle for a good few years."
"Cost: $11.99 for a four pack."
"D/O- It's really hard to say anything negative about Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine...uhhhh, perhaps it doesn't have good drinkability? Nevermind that though, this one is meant for sipping and savoring. I feel this one may be best split with a friend for most."
"O- I like this a lot. By no means is this a King Henry but still delicious. Once CW figures out a way to thicken their barrel aged beer I will buy tons of them and hoared them all!!"
""
""
"Overall – A very impressive bourbon barrel barleywine. I really need to try and find more of these. A tasty beer with literally zero alcohol taste and just slight warming. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, if alcohol burn isn't a deal breaker for you, this is a good beer. Great for a cold winter night like tonight, warms you up. I'll definitely sit on one and see where it's at later, but a hot barleywine fresh, along with some nice barleywine as well as barrel notes in this beer."
""
"O- This may be my first bourbon aged barley wine, I'm really not sure. It is pretty amazing though! I look forward to aging a few bottles of this and see what happens."
""
""
""
"O: This is a WINNER. It builds on an already great Y2K base with bourbon, caramel, vanilla and oak…who doesn’t like that. This is perhaps only second up to Fourteen Fourteen as the greatest of Central Waters offering."
""
""
"O - Awesome. The time of the year when this and its stout counterpart come out make me happy I live in Wisconsin. Definitely world class in my book."
"O: Warming helps release the qualities of this American barleywine, as cellaring likely will, as well. One of the highest ranked WI brews on BA, it is balanced and has real substance and depth, making it one to seek out and sample."
"Liftbridge Commander is great for similar reasons. I sense a blind tasting coming up..."
""
"overall: flat out fantastic. i thought BBS was going to steal the show this year, but this one is better. another beer by CW that will fail to get the hype that other breweries like goose island or founders gets, but they make a beer that is easily as good as these breweries make. im excited to see how this one ages"
""
""
""
"Smell is is definately roasted malts, dark fruits are pretty dominant as well. Really a nice mix of roast and dark fruits that interact really well. Taste is not as nice as the nose. There is definately some strong hops that take over the taste. The hops aren't bitter at all and actually balance things nice. However I think there is just too much hops for me. The hops seem to be too strong. No doubt this would be better with some age. Gonna age the rest."
""
""
""
"O: Really good, but I think a year or 2 will do some good. Alcohol warming is pretty strong, and will likely mellow over time. Still very good now though."
"So glad I finally got to try this one and so stoked it's finally come to Minnesota."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it a lot! Can't complain much, thank you lots Central Waters, and your team!"
"Wow this beer is another one that makes me happy to live in Wisconsin. I would put this up against pretty much any other barlywine that is out. The bourbon really works nice. If you are a Bourbon aged fan this is just about perfect"
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer. As with any barleywine I think it needs a good year to really be at its peak. The alcohol just overpowers the bourbon at this point, but I have no doubt this will improve with time. I will get more of these if I can."
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: Had my first bottle from the 2013 vintage tonight. Central Waters advertised the fact that with this year's Bourbon Barrel Stout, they aged it for twice as long in the bourbon barrels. There were rumors that all of their bourbon barrel beers were aged for twice as long as in previous years. Whatever the case, this year's version of the BB Barleywine is so much smoother than last years! I will have to do a side by side comparison to be sure but as good as last year's was, there was always a slight harshness to each sip. That is totally gone this year as the bourbon integrates so much better with all of the wonderful barleywine flavors in this beer."
"and we have... Nailed it! Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barley wine! I love this beer and it is always a want! Thanks Alwatcher. Its amazing how I have never picked up on the hops as much until now. bottles 2,3&4 to come."
"Had on-tap at the Norse, this came out dark with red highlights and smelled like woody cherries and bourbon. Taste is very sweet, with ripe fruit flavors, vanilla, lots of caramel and oaked wood. I like the fact that the bourbon isn't overwhelming, and that the beer gets more and more complex as it warms. I'm also genuinely surprised at the 11.5 ABV--this was so smooth! So light! So easy to drink! I don't normally love this style, but this I would have again in a second."
""
"O: A very nicely done BBBW. The barrel presence was solid and the heat really played nicely with the other surrounding flavors. I do wish the body of the beer was a little heavier though."
""
"I had to come back and add to this review this beer really got better as it warmed, i sat there watching TV drinking this and the bourbon notes really got complex this is a hot beer and needs some age but none the less fantastic"
""
"4.5 D: I wish I reviewed this when it was fresh. The scores would have been a good bit higher. I'm curious as to whether this is in the awkward phase right now or if it just doesn't age well. In any case, even this aged bottle was very tasty."
""
"Poured a slightly hazed caramel brown color with an off-white head that reduced to a ringlet. Aroma of caramel and sweet malts, dark fruits, bourbon. Alcohol warning. Taste is sweet and cakey, woody bourbon, rum raisin, figs and black cherries, finishing with a mild, seemingly hoppy fruit character. As in the aroma, alcohol's presence is noticeable...it is a bourbon-aged barleywine, so would you expect it to be otherwise? Heavy-medium body, chewy, and quite drinkable."
""
""
""
"O- This is a very impressive BA Barleywine, smooth drinking and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is the best barleywine I've ever had. Flavors are rich, complex and for almost 12 percent, nowhere near overbearing. Only flaw to this beer is that the alcohol was definitely there, not that I dont mind it, but it prevented me from giving this beer 5 in some categories. I sampled this vintage at about 11 months old, hopefully I can find some more of this barleywine and revisit it in another year."
""
""
"O- My experience with Barleywines is limited, but this is one of the best I have tasted. I would love to try one with a little more age on it, as it seems this will only get better."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a nice reddish amber color with a one finger sticky head bthe smell is caramel bourbon and a nice boozy sweetness. The flavor follows suit and is almost like a bourbon county stout but a Barleywine. The flavors a bold and the bourbon is in your face and hot. Mouthfeel is warm medium thick and delicious. Overall a very good Barleywine can wait to have it with some age on It."
""
""
"Very enjoyable beer, one I wish I had immediate access too. While CWBBBW would struggle to compete with the top tier barrel aged Barleywines, it is an impressive beer none the less. A bit of a fuller body, slightly more depth and heat dialed down it would be spot on. Excellent beer, worth seeking out."
""
""
"Drink any 2011's you have now."
"D - solid barleywine here. The barrel aging is really well integrated into the flavors here and elevates this to a solid barleywine. I wish I had a couple more bottles of this!"
"Nostrovya!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color ale with a quite large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of light bourbon notes with the typical vanilla notes and some sweet caramelized malt notes. Taste is a nice mix between some sweet, though not overly so, notes of caramelized brown sugar with some notes bourbon and vanilla. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Easily drinkable with good balance and level of complexity."

"I cannot believe that this bottle was so young, as the flavors have settled so nicely already. An excellent barrel-aged barleywine, one I will absolutely seek out again."
"Despite the misperceptions listed above, this is a really good beer that I'd like to have again, with a little more age on it if possible. Just my second beer from Central Waters, and I look forward to more."
"A unique and boldly flavorful brew. Full on bourbon oak profile with sweet toasty malts. The only knock is the astringent alcohol presence. Some more ageing should take care of that. Well worth seeking out."
"O: Overall I really like this beer. At 50 degrees the flavors are a bit muted. But the flavors really come alive as this beer reaches room temperature. Really enjoying this one. Despite the abv this one drinks exceptionally well but it's also a great sipper as well. Glad I have a few more of these. 4.5"
"Really a rocking BA barleywine here. I will require more of these."
"This is one of the best bourbon barreled barley wines I have had. I will definitely be tracking down more!"
"Big thanks to seeswo for the trade. Served at 53 degrees in a tulip. Bottled on January 2011 indicated on the label. Pours a bright amber hue with candy apple highlights. Clarity is almost translucent, but there's a slight haze. Head is an 1/8th of an inch, loose and cream-colored and immediately dissipates into a thin band around the shoulders. Some short strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Love the nose on this beer! Bourbon, buttery notes, sugary and candied fruits. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's definitely an alcohol presence here - it's still a little hot but not in a bad way. There's also some hops bitterness that manifests towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a slightly oily consistency that is somewhat masked by an assertive carbonation. There's definitely some residual alcohol heat. Overall, this is a top notch beer. I'm glad I opened it but would love to see what a few years does to it. That said, if you like the hops character in a your American Barleywines, open it sooner than later; however, this one is really going to open up over time in my opinion."
"Overall this was a good beer. Unfortunately the only other two BA Barleywines I have to compare it to is Abacus and BA Decadence. Both are among my favorite beers and some of the top in the style. Very enjoyable though."
"O- This beer did not disappoint. Would love to try a 09' or 10' vintage to see how this beer ages and smooths out. Will be looking for the 12' when it comes out early next year!"
"Overall, one of the best American barleywines I’ve ever had. The hops seem a bit faded, which is perfect for me. For comparisons sake, fresh Bigfoot has a bit more hop character to it than I prefer, and I picked the perfect time to open this one as they have mellowed precisely. Again, a big thanks to rowingbrewer for this one. I need to acquire more of this now."
"O- A very nice barleywine; recommended. Would like to have this again."
"EDIT: 7/2012, Just opened another bottle from 2/10 and all the heat I mentioned in my review is gone. Another year in the cellar has done wonders."
"O- really nice barleywine. Sweet, malty, bourbony. Good stuff."
"Overall, a really outstanding barleywine and exactly what I was in the mood for when I picked it out for tonight. Plenty of barrel and bourbon throughout but without being overly boozy. I really liked the hop note that balanced the heavy malt and kept this from being cloying. Really delicious, the only barrel aged barleywine I can definitively say I enjoyed more was Abacus, but I much preferred the serving size of this at only 12 oz. I will definitely seek out more to drink fresh and for the cellar."
"Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine pours a completely opaque mahogany, with a towering pile of light tan foam sitting atop the beer. Its shoots past four fingers in height, settles back down to about that, and just sits there. It legitimately took five mininutes for the foam to recede, and leaves gobs and gobs of lacing down the side of the glass. The nose is very heavy on caramelized sugar and toffee, with the only evidence of the time spent in barrels being a light touch of vanilla that stays in the background. The flavor brings the barrel aging a bit more into focus. Toffee and lightly burnt sugar are still the foundation of the flavor profile, but the vanilla secondary note from the aroma is joined by a pleasant, mild bourbon taste. The mouthfeel is solid, a full, rich body paired with carbonation that just keeps the beer from being syrupy, yet lets the malt shine. I love me a barrel aged barleywine, and this is one of the better ones I've had."
"Overall, this is a VERY enjoyable beer. Smooth, rich, and big. Something to sip and savor. Worth seeking out."
"Pours a deep redish-brown with a tiny white head small bubbles floating up even after the head fades, great lacing. Smells like vanilla toffe with dark fruits and a little oaky scent. Taste is amazing big bourbon vanilla upfront blends very well with the sweet maltyness of the barleywine. Mouthfeel is great for a strong barleywine, not huge carbonation but its nice for the style just enough. Overall amazing beer I really wish I had more than the one bottle, thanks dyan for the hookup."
"O - A really nice Bourbon-forward Barleywine, such a treat!"
"O - I was expecting more of a hop flavor from an American barleywine, especially one this fresh, but this one tips the scales in favor of the malt and bourbon aging. I think with time it will calm down a little and balance out a little more. Either way it big, boozy, and definitely a solid barleywine."
"O: This was a long-time want of mine in what is becoming one of my favorite styles. I wanted to have this mellowed out a touch more, the bourbon was unmistakable. If you really take your time with this there are lots of complexities that come out. Well done Central Waters"
"O: Easily the best bargain in barrel aged beer (alliteration bonus points?). If it was available all year, I'd probably buy two 4-packs a month. A strong showing from the flagship beer of one of the best breweries around."
"mouthfeel - medium bodied and medium carbonation, drank with lots of other barleys so i felt a sweetness overload."
"Overall: Overpowering sharp alcohol. Not my liking."
"D: Might have opened this one a little early. With a little time I could see this being great. Decent now, but I'll sit on the other one I have"
"O-- Good but a bit sweet and booze driven at times. Barrel hides the base beer for a good portion of drinking. honestly thought a little too hot at times."
"Pretty good, but the bourbon flavor was a bit too strong for me. It may be that this vintage was too fresh for my tastes. I'll have to give an aged vintage a shot sometime soon."
"Overall, very nice. Nice melding of the complex flavors, not one dimensional and doesn't taste layered. Very nice."
"Pours a murky iced tea color with a huge 3 inch light orange head that fades to a chunky cap on the top of the beer. Nice distinct thin rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of brown sugar, toffee, biscuity malt, bourbon, along with some wood notes. Taste is of bourbon and wood up front, with brown sugar and malt coming through in the middle, and some nice citrus zest hop flavors on the finish. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a creamy yet sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barleywine with nice balanced bourbon flavors that don't overpower the traditional barleywine smells and tastes."
"Poured into my Stone tulip, a gratis bottle, thanks ewright! This -bal barleywine pours with almost zero head. The color is a murky darkish reddish brownish?!? The smell here makes the beer. Again with a great smelling, fair tasting bb barleywine. I love the oak, vanilla, caramel on the nose. To a lesser degree I get some piney hoppiness and orange peel as well. The flavor doesn't back it up. The flavor is dominated by malts, which should be good, but I'm not getting the balance of hops I thought I smelled. It has a little caramel but not much vanilla and is intensely bitter and alcoholic on the finish. The mouthfeel is good, mild carbonation, creamy milky coating, not syrupy cloying."
"Overall a solid take on the style but not the best I've had. I could go for some more malty notes and maybe a bit more barrel flavor. I think I would enjoy it more if it wasn't aged. Anyhow... it's still a decent beer and I see why people enjoy it. It's especially nice that it comes in 12oz bottles."
"Worth trying, I'll have to try another to see if I notice differences. I was expecting more w/ such great reviews."
"O- amazing brew, plain and simple. One of the best bbbw I've ever had. The time down has done wonderful things to this."
"Massive thanks goes out to the person (BM me if it was you and I will give you proper credit) who shared this one with the group at the ""Evening Wood"" tasting graciously hosted by cmrillo! 2011 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a deep red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. However there wasn't anything really interesting going on in it to make it overly memoriable. The flavor did however mix and compliment each other quite well. Pretty smooth for an 11.5% heavy hitter. Definitely worth trying!"
"Tastes are unbelieveable malty sweetness, breadcrumbs, yeast, brown sugar, sherry, bourbon, wine sediment, hops, American crystal, mugwort and flowers. Smells are brown sugar, booze, straight-up booze, cornchips, malt liquor, vanilla and mango slices."
"Very generous extra, huge props again to Winsconsinality. Would love to get a hold of this one again."
"Full bodied, somewhat higher carbonation, a bit creamy, lasting finish on the tongue. Drinks really nice, I was psyched to try this and I'm happy I have a 2011 bottle at home to compare this to."
"12/25/12: 2008 vintage. This has held up pretty well. Tasty, showing mild oxidation. More reminiscent of an old ale than barleywine, with fruity character especially evident on the nose. This beer stands up well to age, but is best fresh IMHO."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a pretty solid beer, but didn't really wow me like some barrel aged barleywines have. It felt a little too juicy, citrusy and bitter as well as boozy at times, but then also smooth and drinkable at times when the malty flavors came out more. It had some very nice high points to it and was a very nice sipping beer this evening, but fell a little short of being a truly world class beer of the style."
"This fine brew pours a dark amber and settles a ruby infused brown color. Oily legs cling to the glass after an inch of off white head dissipates. The nose smells very sweet with notes akin to caramel apples. There is a bit of a hop presence in the aroma but nothing too strong. The taste is also very sweet with a well masked alcohol level. The oak and vanilla bourbon characteristics offered by the oak barrel are shining through in this beer but not overpowering. You can still taste the caramel and light hop offerings as well. Some butter notes are also picked up in the flavor that add to the sweetness. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with a suiting low amount of carbonation. Overall, pretty damn smooth for such a brew and damn tasty as well."
"O: Simply not up to par with the competition. 2/5"
"Reveal is!!! Holy hell... I've had this. Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine! I've even had this year! It is sitting in a review notebook somewhere... I should find that and compare..."
"Overall this was another week of barrel aged bliss from a bottle. I am super glad that I decided to break this out today since it is just a little bit on the cooler side and this made for a fantastic afternoon sipper. I am going to head outside for a nice cigar to finish this baby up and unwind for the rest of my Sunday. If you get a chance to try this or trade for it I'd say this is one of the best bourbon barrel barleywines I have ever had so don't miss out"
"Overall - one of the best barrel aged brews I've had!"
"This is a very nice beer. Any bottles I get from here on out will be consumed fresh. I shall not age them!"
"O: Favorite beer of 2011 thus far and I am halfway through the year. This, for me, will be tough to beat. Damn near perfection to my pallet. Seek this one out if you are a barleywine fan."
"Thanks to splax23 for this one!"
"O: Good. Unexpectedly interesting."
"Overall: A pretty solid brew that I probably should have tried fresh first to get a baseline on."
"Overall, an excellent BW! Many thanks for seeswo for the hookup!"
"This is a truly great beer. Best I've had from Central Waters. Very impressed, seek out."
"O - This is an incredibly well balance BB barleywine. One of my favourites so far, awesome. Highly recommended."
"This was really nice. The other barleywines I've tried have been far too hoppy but this was a wonderful, sweet, thick treat. I do wonder if another couple of years aging would cut the remaining bitterness some but even with it this was a treat."
"Pours a cloudy dark iced tea color with translucent edges and a ruby hue against a white light. Visible effervescence sustains a shallow off eggshell collar briefly while a nice amount of spotty Belgian lacing adorns the glass. The smell is aggressive, and with high standard, quite classic. A vanilla character from the oak treatment adds nicely to the vibrant sweet malty caramel butterscotch toffee brown sugar molasses notes. Really nice!! The flavor is very pronounced... and sweet. The full bodied texture vividly supports the overall experience. The initial mouth feel was exceptionally well carbonated..especially for a beverage of this style. Full bodied without being syrupy, the texture REALLY adds a ton of value to this one. The flavor is quite NICE as it reflects the nose yet has a surprisingly black licorice thing going on, especially in the really enjoyable aftertaste. I REALLY ENJOYED considering this one!!! Again..many thanks to my long lost Minnesota connection!!"
"had a chance to have the 2011 side-by-side with the 2010 at a barrel aged tasting on 2011-08-06 - the 2011 is exactly as predicted. the bourbon is very in your face. the 2010 is much dryer and more mellow. i'd say this beer is better with a year on it."
"O: A pretty good barleywine that thankfully doesn't suffer like their two bourbon barrel stouts. The original barleywine flavors still come through the barrel aging process, which is a quality their bbal stouts unfortunately lacked."
"I would be splitting hairs to say so, but the 10 is drinking just a tad better, from age or batch variation it's hard to say, either year is world class on my palate, and i think this is one of the best bang/buck bottles in america, easily. I am going to start saving for next release now."
"O- I'm glad to see something with ""bourbon"" on the label and it not taste like it's over powered by it. This brew is a good blend of barelywine aged in bourbon barrels and made for some interesting sipping. A little on the bitter-sweet side for taste however."
"D: No, not something I'll cellar again. I liked the fresh version much more."
"This is a really nice barleywine. I wish this was available to me where I live as it'd be one that I'd go back to as often as I could. Thanks again Alex!"
"Very nice, wish I had more."
"Pours a very mixed amber color, seems to be confused as to weather it is red or orange. The head forms with a bit of work and head is a nice tan color. The aroma is honestly what threw me for a loop. Nice sweet malts power through with a slight hop and bourbon aroma in the background. A very nice aroma and it made the brew all the more enjoyable. The taste was a bit un balanced for me, nothing that age can't fix. I feel with age this brew would eventually balance out. The sweet malt and body I felt was great but the Hops and Bourbon were a bit over the top. The body I felt was perfect and overall was a very enjoyable brew."
"D-I felt that this was a great use of a bourbon barrel, Very nice and balanced flavor, decently complex, and the mouthfeel was very good for what it is. Drink this one fresh, I don't see much need for age."
"Overall: Another solid beer by Central Waters; i am becoming a big fan of their beer! I cant think of a better bourbon barrel barleywine that comes in 4 pack format. Great barrel notes and fantastic malt profile."
"Deep,deep mahogany color with a nice tight head-bordering on black but not quite so. Huge sweet malt aroma with a heavy hand of bourbon to boot. Very sweet, almost spirit sweet like one of the trendy ""schnapps""...Big and heavy malt flavors-raisens, figs, caramel, dried fruit. Huge caramel and toffee like flavors. Enough hops to be there but this is certainly all about the malt here. Still holds a touch of grain flavor. Lingering spice-almost cookie like. Huge body and lick the lips sweetness going on. A big sticky, sweet mess that I simply love. Body goes on for miles. Just a great, great beer all around. A true sipper in every sense of the word. Just great. 2009 vintage. Don't know if this is done each year but oh what a cellarable beer..."
"I'm not a big barleywine fan, but this one hit the spot. It's the first bourbon aged barleywine I have tried and I would be willing to try to find more similar to this."
"Drink and overall: Awesomely drinkable, high ABV barleywine. I like the oak barrel aging, it's done alot for Charlie. Fantastic beer, I have a few left and I am going to let them chill for a year or so."
"The smell of this beer grabs you more than anything. The bourbon stands out on the nose along with on the taste long afterwards. Defiantly a slow drinker with the bitterness on the tail end."
"Scores: Appearance 4/5; Aroma 4.5/5; Taste 3/5; Mouthfeel 2; Drinkability 2/5"
"D - Drinkability is high. Although this is a sipper to a 'T', I didn't once think of finishing this beer and not regretting having more. I would love to see what this develops into, but fresh it's still a great beer."
"Drinkability is good right now but as with many barley wines that I have tried I really think this need a year or two before it peaks. The alcohols are apparent in this one but again I think much of the hot mouth feel will fade and it will be one hell of a brew to enjoy."
" 4.0/4.0/4.0/3.5/4.0"
"D: A little heavy but nice!"
"(12oz bottle courtesy of guyinchicago!). Pours cloudy amber color with sediment and off-white head. Aroma of candied sugar, dried 'pit' fruit and bourbon. Taste is sweet almost like a tootsie pop with a bitter pop at the end.. Full bodied and slick texture. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering. This is a pretty interesting beer."
"The sweetness is a bit fatiguing and could be toned down a notch. This one will probably get better with age. Nevertheless, a great barley wine that will keep the D train warm along the tracks."
"Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, like sipping on liquid caramel. It is actually fairly hot on the palate, possibly from the alcohol, possibly from the bourbon barrel aging. Like I said, I think some time will certainly help mellow this beer out and bring out some more of its subtle complexities. I didn't realize the abv on this bad boy was 11.5% until I pulled it up on here. With this alcohol content the heat isn't much of a surprise, and this is actually fairly drinkable considering that."
"D - I'm giving this one a 5 on drinkability because it is just so all around amazing. When its cold, you are able to drink it somewhat quick and the flavors are slightly suttle and toned down, but when it warms, you can really just enjoy it, and the flavors and wonderful and the barrel aging that this brew has undergone really comes through. I love the flavors, smell and look of this beer. Just an all around amazing beer. Paul and his team have done a wonderful job with this and I hope they keep up the good work. This one only gets better with age folks, but enjoy one today and see how greatness is born!"
"DB- Good balance of oak, barleywine malts and Bourbon flavors. I would like to try this one again in the future."
"D - well balance beer with some very redeeming qualities."
"D: Drink slowly!"
"Pours a translucent cherry brown with a reasonable tannish-white head. Smells just fantastic: caramel, vanilla, bourbon. Just knocks me outta the park. This is a very fresh barley wine, with hops in the finish and big sweetness upfront. A bit boozy, bourbony and just generally, a beer that needs some time to calm down. From experience, it doesn't take long for this beer to mellow quite a bit. Based off of this fresh and generally over time, this is a barley wine for people who like them relatively sweet. Very solid levels of carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. In it's current state, it's not the most drinkable beer. As it mellows, the sweetness emerges, putting a ceiling on the drinkability. In general, this beer has well integrated bourbon without being a bourbon/booze bomb, that is on the sweeter side of an already sweet style. Fantastic, and that's before I mention that you can't pay more than $3/12oz when it's available."
"This beer looked a really nice deep red heavy amber color with a quickly fading light beige head that reduced to lacing on the surface. The smell, it's really really a wonderful fragrance. There is a honey brown sugar caramel aroma along with some hints of bourbon and vanilla. The taste was nice sweet brown sugar and vanilla flavor there were light fruit flavors hidden deep in back a hint of oak flavor. The taste when at the perfect temperature, which I assume to be the intended serving temperature, is a wonderful god like nectar, either above or below the tannins or booze come out respectively. This beer was really easy to drink when at the right temperature range, and I seriously wish that I was saving more of these bottle for myself because damn are they tasty."
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth with just the right amount of prickly carbonation, but it is lacking a little in body. A good -bal barleywine and definitely a sipper, I'll probably let my other bottles go for another year or more and see what develops."
"D- More of a sipper, but plenty drinkable. A nice and complex barleywine, with a near perfect bourbon blend. Would love to try some of these with a couple years of age on them"
"Overall impression: Forget what it looks like, just close your eyes and enjoy. Excellent example of barrel-aging."
"Medium full body. Light on the carbonation. Long boozy finish."
"Medium bodied with tight carbonation up front and a good bit of alcohol heat that lingers throughout and warms the chest. Lots of sweet caramel malt with earthy, leathery notes and slight bitter hops. Hints of caramel, chocolate, toffee and biscuit countered by the bourbon barrel notes. Sweet and boozy but not too hot with plenty of bourbon, oak and vanilla. As it warms the heat tones down a notch and the silky caramel, toffee, vanilla and marshmallow flavors become more prominent. Very complex but a bit just a touch too hot at this stage. I would love to see how this is doing in another year or two. Very good but definitely a sipper."
"Wonderfully complex, this beer rewards repeat visits by revealing new depth with every sip. May be my favorite barleywine."
"D - Good, full flavored, delicious and quite satisfying. I can't wait to try some of the other offering from CW."
"D: I found this beer to be similar in many regards to the Kuhnhenn brew I had alongside it, albeit 3% less abv. I'd definitely have it again."
"D: At 11% or so, it is a nightcap. A nice blend of bourbon and barleywine."
"Drinkability is good. This glass went down pretty easy, especially for 11.5% ABV. However, I think this beer will be even better with a few years on it. Definitely another stand out brew from Central Waters and worth seeking out."
"Overall it's quite nice. I don't know if it's on the outs or has yet to reach its peak but I would love to try some different vintages to see where I like it better."
"D: Good but would not want another"
"D: An impressive beer from Central Waters. Good flavours and something methinks to age for a while."
"The mouthfeel is defined by a creamy carbonation and medium to heavy body. The beer is decadant as it should be, but that hurts drinkability a bit. Just a fantastic brew and one I will stock up on every year when it's available."
"Drinkability- very drinkable for the strength"
"D - Though this does taste good, the overwhelming sweetness without anything counterbalance and the lingering cloying sweetness brings this way down for me."
"2010 bottle. Pours a clear, medium ruby with a scant head. Nose is nice, round malt, fruit sugars, bourbon, oak barrel. Mouth is fairly straight forward, but is good in its simplicity. Mostly bourbon, oak, burnt sugar. I feel like this is somewhat in the ""American"" vein after having some maltier, heavy ones like the Old Stock Reserves. It's the same idea as Wooden Hell but without the amazing complexity and depth. Impressive."
"All of 11.5%. Appropriately sticky, with low-medium carbonation."
"This is like Bigfoot in a Barrel. First time I've had a hoppy barleywine aged in bourbon barrels and it was an experience! I'd love to try a later vintage to see if the hops fade enough for more barrel and malt flavors come out."
"Drinkability -- Frankly, a letdown. Incredibly sweet with none of the bourbon alcohol character to cut through it. It would be easy to confuse this with, say, a J. W. Lee's Harvest Ale homebrew clone if one didn't know what it was. Certainly not terrible, but does not have the iota of balance needed for a barleywine to be great."
"It's caramel. And some wood. And booze. Not a favorite."
"Note:  Just re-visited with a year+ old bottle of the 2013 and came to the same conclusion even before checking my review so I guess I will go against the crowd on this one"
"D - 4 I feel like an old man, but I think this beer could have been helped if they dialed back to maybe 9.5% or so. Still an excellent beer, especially to share after a meal when it's getting colder out. Drink while wearing a sweater."
"First actual beer rating so don't have the lexicon down but this was very tasty. Poured a nice dark amber color. Not much head but the server may have poured some off. Great nose with the bourbon integrated well on the nose. Taste was outstanding. Definitely could taste the bourbon barrel aging on this but thought the malt and barrel aging had really integrated well. Had this a couple times from the bottle a couple months ago and I thought it was somewhat disjointed. On tap it was so much better. The bourbon added some nice sweetness to it. To me this almost tasted and smelled like the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout but in a barleywine."
"D: This had a great scent and taste, somewhat similar to Gratitude, but rough around the edges. Definitely too hot and fresh, with dominant alcohol presence that made this a bit tough to sip. The bourbon barrel didn't come through very much either, with only subtle toasted oak notes. With some age, this could develop into a fantastic brew that contends with the top barleywines. But I don't recommend even trying it fresh."
"d 4 will have to crack another open in a year or so and see if the bourbon settles down at all. right now this is huge and impressive, but i don't like it as much as the regular charlie."
"Drinkability: Have one more bottle of this. I loved this beer and I'm curious as to what some age will do to this."
"D: The 11.5% ABV is evident. I think the drinkability is relatively good with all factors considered, but others at the same tasting thought it was too hot."
"This beer in one word: Venerable"
"2010 vintage. This brew pours a mostly clear garnet amber topped by a short wisp of white bubbles. The nose comprises whiskey, oak, caramel, biting citrus, and a touch o' booze. The taste is a richer version of the smell, though the alcohol really busts its way through, Kool-Aid Man-style. I'm not so sure I'd say ""Oh yeah!"" to this with as much enthusiasm as that glass bastard. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and rather thick feel. Overall, a decent BBBW, but decidedly too boozy right now. Perhaps this guy will be calmer with some years on him, but he's too damn hot today."
"Obscenely drinkable for what it is, finished it faster than I should have. So glad I have 3 more bottles, I imagine this aging excellently. Probably the best Barleywine I have had so far."
"Pours a clear crimson mahogany color with a moderate light beige head with average retention and lacing for the style and ABV. Aroma is the highlight, a potent complex blend of bourbon, caramel malt, mild citrus hops, oak, maple, berries, etc with surprisingly little booziness. Unfortunately the flavor isn't quite as complex and balanced at the nose; I guess this could use some more age on it. Flavor starts with an intense vanilla and bourbon booziness before the base of a more English style barleywine with complex caramel malts and dark fruity esters. Finish is exceptionally boozy and drying with light citric hops. Body is medium thick with light carbonation and overall has a smooth, soft texture that covers the palate with a lingering dry bourbon finish. I really enjoyed this and look forward to aging some, but was a little let down by the hype on this as I enjoy Weyerbacher's Insanity almost as much and can buy that off the shelf."
"Drinks great, skews English BW to me, but that could be age. I'm results-oriented & this kicks ass!"
" Pretty palate wrecking. Would not be able to knock back more than one 12 oz. and still be able to taste much afterwards."
"Overall, this beer is easy to drink but the potency in flavor and ABV makes it limited as the palate and brain head south quickly."
"D: For me, bourbon aged beers are either hit or miss, and this one was without a doubt a hit. The bourbon was pronounced, but not overwhelming as it was in angle's share. This was a delicious, interesting, fun drink. If you haven't tried it, you should."
"This beer blew me away. By far the best barleywine I've ever had and also one of the best beers in general that I've had as well. I've wanted this one for a while and it surely did not disappoint"
"D: Good drinkability but definitely a sipper. Glad I picked this beer up. A little age on this might mellow out the hops and make this really special."
" I could definately find my self drinking a couple of these in a night, so enjoyable all the way through."
"D--This one was a bit of a letdown for me, something just was missing for me on this one. Really glad I got to try it though!"
"This one has a very strong smell, was able to catch a whiff of it as i poured it a couple feet below my nose. Really strong bourbon smell, and the taste is the same. Has some earthy and woody tones to it as well. It doesn't really have that hot or burning feeling as the alcohol goes down, which was slightly surprising, but that's it."
"One of my two favorite beers from one of my two favorite Wisconsin breweries, this is a perennial favorite and a blessing to those fortunate enough to live here. If you're into barleywines and haven't tried this, you should really seek it out. Don't take my word for it, continue reading below."
"Ah, what's left to say? Central Waters did an outstanding job with this one. I have to surmise this will do extremely well with various years on it. For some folks it might be too brash at this point, but I certainly enjoyed it as is. Highly recommended."
"D: A fine sipper that could use a bit more to time to mellow to the point that I write songs to pay tribute to its amazing-ness. In the meantime, I'll write a BA review to record the moment this damn fine barleywine hit my taste buds and to encourage you, dear reader, to seek it out. Glad to have a second bottle (2010 edition) for the cellar."
"D: Tastes amazing. Don't taste the ABV at all -goes down surprisingly smooth. I could drink more than one of these easily. I've had some bad barleywine experiences in the past and this changed my mind about barleywine completely. SO GOOD!"
"MF/D: gives off a slight heat that coats the mouth and throat with a smooth finish. a great special occasion beer. no wonder this is in such high demand. thought about trading the rest of my stock, but also contemplating saving it..."
"D - a *very* good barleywine, no doubts about that. so glad I have another bottle as this definitely needs to sit and mellow. i will be looking forward to that."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Just the right amount of present alcohol. Not too boozy, but enough to let you know it is bourbon-barrel aged. Drinkability, in my opinion, is great. I picked this up tonight thinking I would just slowly enjoy the one bottle I had, but think if I had more than one, I could put down another. A great drinking, great tasting, stand out in its class beer. Lived up to any hype or preconceived notions I had about it."
"D - Don't get any alcohol on this, and very smooth, highly drinkable for the ABV."
"Overall, can't believe this a top 100. Not a great beer, has potential down the line maybe. This is unbalanced and totally too woody."
"d- any time, any place, i'll drink this. i traded away way too much, but i hope everyone is enjoying it. god knows i did. definitely belongs in the top 100. it's in my top 10 easily. yum. super delic. call your sconsin ba's and get yourself some!"
"D: Even at 11.5%, plus barrel aging, there really isn't too much alcohol to this beer. One of the best barrel aged barleywines I've had."
"Drinkability is quite good. This is a tasy powerhouse of a barley wine. It has a few flaws, but they were easy to overlook when I take a sip..."
"D-this is quite tasty and has a great nose. a little heat in the back but nothing that crushes the beer at all. great oak presence, a little more bourbon in the flavor but still very nice."
"Deep garnet with lovely clarity in the light. Off-white head that lasted throughout most of the experience. Bourbon wafts through the air as it's being poured. Oh the luxury! Oak, rum, vanilla, hint of toasted nuts, and figs fill my nares and makes my mouth water. Delicious caramel, vanilla, and a touch of cocoa makes for an immediate loving of bourbon aged barleywines. Followed by toffee, black currants, and a touch of berry. Nicely full bodied and smooth carbonation. Out of this world."
"D - This is one of the nicest examples of a Bourbon barrel treatment I've come across."
"(D)- A great barleywine with a great future ahead of it. Tastes great now, but age will continue to work wonders on this guy. Rather fruit driven, but goes well with the bourbon barrel aging. Reminds me almost of a port wine. Great stuff; seek this out and buy a case to set aside and drink over the next 4 years at least."
"Carbonation level is low but appropriate. The drinkability suffers a bit due to the heat. For me, CWBBW is difficult to figure. Last summer we had a two year old bottle that had aged horribly. Not sure if there is a bottle to bottle variance, but this beer could use some aging, but for how long before a decline is unknown."
"For 11.50%abv this is very drinkable. If I had a four pack of this, I'd probably be passed out by now, but I'd have a great time getting to that point. This stuff is tasty!"
"Drinkability is definitely impacted by the sharpness of the alcohol in the taste, but not necessarily any more than in other beers of this style. Overall a tasty and somewhat unexpected beer that I'm glad to have enjoyed."
"I received a dingle bottle of this as an extra from kbutler1, many many thanks for the chance to try this beer, which was on my wants list by the way. It pours a reddish orange color, with about one finger of white heading. From the nose there is big bourbon, and some maple syrup. More of the same from the taste, except the hops come through to add a bitter element to the experience. There is also a nice caramel sweetness that accompanies everything. Mouthfeel is thick, and pretty boozy, but does not get in the way of drinkability too much. If you want a clear picture of this beer taste wise, it is very similar to the Lost Abbey Angel's Share Bourbon Barrel Aged beer, just a bit hotter and more bitter. With a few years in the cellar, it might even pan out to be a better beer. Centrsl Waters made a great Barleywine here. Cheers"
"Pours a thick, syrupy dark golden amber with a small rising off white head. Smell is bourbon and oak, dried dark fruits, alcohol. I think the barrel really takes the smell over. Taste is a wonderful intermingling between the natural flavors of the beer and the flavors imparted by the barrel. Charred oak, bourbon, sweet caramel malt, cherries, caramelized brown sugar, then dried dark fruits and a hoppy bitterness. The finish is sticky, warming a slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft (that's the only thing I can think to call it), sticky, warming and comforting (an adjective that I think should be more widely used when describing beers like this). Drinkable enough, you're not really supposed to want another. I'd love sit back and relax with this after a great meal then slip into a buzzed food coma and sleep like a baby."
"D- Moderately high- Rivals any other bal-aged barleywine I've had. Impressive stuff. If you have access to this stuff, consider yourself lucky."
"Aromas of rich caramels and moderate barrel impact. The central waters barrel aged beers are so distinct in their barrel character.... not sure what kind of barrels they use though. Butterscotch and this charred/toasted wood character that is so distinct in the taste. Some sweeter vanilla and brown sugar combine with the robustness of the barrel notes. The base beer is not as complex as I remembered from the 2009 vintage, still boasts some darker fruity notes and toasted nuts for added depth. Upper medium bodied, low carbonation, felt a little 'heavy' at times. Alcohol becomes surprisingly evident as this got closer to room temp. Still, this was not too hot, but rather warming - making you constantly aware of the ABV. This is a pretty good BA Barlweywine, though not quite as magical as when I first had the 2009 vintage."
"A nice sipper. It will be interesting to see how this ages."
"Overall: A solid effort, I'm impressed with the first Central Waters brew I've had. Well-balanced and the barrel-aging hits all of the right notes for me without being overwhelming. It doesn't make the 'top tier' for me, but is a very worthy beer."
"d - Overall a great barleywine. Has a great bourbon and sweet smell and taste. Some great oak as well. Would love to have again."
"I recommend this ish."
"D- Way too drinkable. Dangerous."
"D- 12oz was enough for one sitting but it takes some true willpower to keep the other 3 bottles I have in the ghetto cellar. hopefully I'll be able to keep at least one bottle to compare with a fresh one next year."
"I cannot believe how good this is for the price. I wish I bought more!"
"Pours the color of a rusty copper penny, with a good three fingers of light beige foam. Aromas of bourbon, oak, vanilla and cinnamon. Flavors of bourbon, dark caramel, dark fruits and vanilla. A very nicely put together beer. I love the way barley wines are helped with the addition of the bourbon barrels. An excellent example of the style."
"D- This is a highly drinkable beer that I wish I could find at my local store. Sadly, I hope it doesn't take this long to get some more of it. I think this beer was well worth the wait and hope to be able to get more of it. A very well made beer...I can see why it gets the scores it does."
"Its a sipper. Beer is medium in body and finishes dry. Lots of sweetness up front but its not cloying at all. The liquor and alcohol flavors are bright and pretty forward in the midpalate, I imagine some age on this would really help this beer out a lot. There is no aftertaste and connectivity is pretty good. I believe this will age well the malt is there and some really interesting things can develop. I enjoyed this a lot."
"D: this is one of the most delicious barleywines I have experienced, the bourbon really works well with the style"
"Medium to full bodied, sweet, and creamy. Not as smooth as Kosmyk Charlie, due to the bourbon, but still very nice. I have several more bottles, and can't wait to see how they age."
"Drinkability: I am not the biggest fan of barley wine but this one was quite good, I couldn't handle more then one of these in a session but it was quite drinkable. The alcohol was well hidden. I am definitely going to pick up some more of this for the cellar."
"For sure a sipper at 11.5%, but very good indeed. Can't wait for it to have some age on it and try some again at a later date."
"side note: I had a sample of this at the beer store, and it was served quite cold. When I drank this bottle it was served at cellaring temp and I enjoyed it much more. I would recommend letting it sit out of your refrigerator for a while before drinking."
"D: I am absolutely pumped that I managed to snag 8 bottles of these. Will drink one or two more this year with the rest to age a range of years. I really can't imagine a much better american barleywine... Kudos to Central Waters."
"Thanks Cheezdawg!"
"D: Brilliant. I weep that I can't walk a quarter mile and pick up a four pack of this anymore. Truly, Madison, WI was forged by the gods themselves."
"Overall I was very impressed with this beer and even more so when I discovered the low price. This beer is a steal and well worth a shot."
"D - Half of the bottle was enough for me right now. I have a couple of bottles left to cellar and will see how they improve as they get a chance to age."
"This beer is very fresh and ready to drink now, it will mellow out and change with age, but it is fantastic as is and if you're patient, it will also be fantastic down the road. Had a 2009 vintage about a month ago and it had calmed down a bit but was still quite boozy and nice...the 2010 picks up right where the 2009 left off, great beer from Central Waters, gonna drink one of these every few months for the next 2 years or so..."
"Very drinkable for the style, I want to get a lot of this beer, and keep it forever."
"Overall, this is a solid bwine. A little hot right now, but I can see this getting extremely tasty with time. I am glad we have CW so close to us. This is a beer that needs to be tried. Very drinkable. Well done."
"Taste is as good as any barley wine I have ever tried. Very malty with not much hops, but nicely balanced. Some type of hops that remind me of the Belgian style(Question mark) some sweetness in the background. Alcohol is warming. I think I will leave some of these a while and maybe that finish will smooth out. Just a little strong on the ""chemical"" taste at the end."
"Overall I would like to put some age on it. I think it would improve greatly"
"I usually don't cellar beers which are not bottle-conditioned, so I probably won't keep this beer long enough for its hops to mellow, which is a bit of a shame."
"Pours a murky reddish-brown with a white head. The aroma is bourbon, caramel, brown sugar and chocolate. The flavor is chocolate, oak, bourbon, brown sugar, alcohol and molasses. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel. An excellent barleywine that is enhanced by the bourbon-barrel aging."
"A few people I trust have told me that this beer is the real deal, including Overlord and Mikedashg (thanks Mike for this bottle). They were right. Deliciously complex, rich, balanced, elegant, and flat out tasty."
"D- Exceptional. Goes down nicely and very well balanced. This is definitely a sipper which cuts down on the drinkability but this one is meant to be cherished. I would have to say that one is all you really need in a sitting. This would be great for after dinner or right before bed. Central Waters again shows why it is an up and coming brewery."
"D. This style of beer is meant for slow sipping. One and done for me. I am not a big barleywine guy but this is a very good beer and one that I will enjoy drinking from time to time. CW delivers again."
"The mouthfeel is spot on for the style, very mild carbonation with a rich, creamy texture. The flavors of this beer combined so nicely, nothing really overwhelming the other components (unlike some other barrel aged beers, that basically taste like carbonated Maker's Mark). CW's Bourbon Barrel Barleywine is well balanced and delicious. I have high expectations for this beer with some age on it."
"D: So smooth, with a complexity that keeps it very interesting and enjoyable throughout. I look forward to ""more of the same"" from Central Waters. Fantastic."
"Overall, a fantastic elixir that joins the pantheon of great barleywines that includes MS Arctic Devil, The Perfect Storm, Xyauyù, Kuhnhenn Bourbon Barrel, J.W. Lees and Old Ruffian."
"After having a bottle of 09 I will bump my scores slightly seeing as with one year this beer is now of mind blowing status."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice brownish color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some very nice thick creamy sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some very nice notes of figs, raisins, plums, cherries, nice little touch of bourbon/oak. The taste is awesome, malty, sweet, lots of dark fruits, and some bourbon/oak notes. Full/Medium body, the ABV is hidden very well on this one. Very Drinkable, this is a exceptional brew, highly recommended. Thanks Todd!"
"D - This an exceptional beer and probably the best barleywine I have gotten my hands on to date. The smoothness is undeniable and really separates this beer from other barleywines I have had. After about six months in the cellar this beer is great, so I am curious to find out what a fresh version of this beer would taste like along with one that has seen some extended cellar time. Unfortunately, this was my only 2009 bottle so I will have to hope some 2010 versions are available for my indulgence. Amazing beer."
"Overall, I must say that this beer is a most likely a shell of its future self right now. Sit on this for at least 6-12 months if you want to experience the full complexity of this barleywine. That being said, it is still very tasty even in this young state."
"Not quite as good as Wooden Hell, but a damn fine bourbon barreled American barley wine that's worth picking up. Good job Central Waters!"
"Pours a dark brown with some crimson highlights. Not quite hazy and not quite opaque, but definitely not at all translucent. The smell is of bourbon, molasses, brown sugar, and caramel. The taste is equally impressive, with an absolutely gorgeous bourbon character and flavor without adding too much alcohol heat. Also picked up a little bit of oak. Moderate to full body with the perfect level of carbonation for the style, and just a little bit of alcohol heat. This one was absolutely fantastic and was perhaps the best bourbon barleywine that I've had to date, rivaled only by Kuhnhenn's version."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a small amount of CO2 leading to a smooth finish."
"Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine (2008) is damn good beer that tastes like it's at the peak of its considerable power right... about... now. Even if there are no more bottles in my cellar, I plan to stock up on this amazing elixir during the next trip up to Madtown."
"Overall: Really impressive. In the top 5 bourbon barrel BW's I've had... I think."
"Drinkability is pretty high. This one really kicks ass overall. Phenomenal BBBW, up there with Perfect Storm. A damn fine beer."
"This is an extremely complex brew, and it was suprising to me at how good it was, I wasn't expecting this monster of a beer but I guess I should have. Despite the largeness I find it pretty drinkable, though it is a slow sipper. An amazing brew."
"D: I'm very partial to this beer--it was one of my introductions to craft beer through a friend, which I didn't feel comfortable reviewing at the time. I have been wanting to try this one again and get a review out of it for quite a while now to see if it was really as good as I had remembered (as opposed to good in comparison to, well, pretty terrible beer). Central Waters did not fail me on this one--I can now say that I absolutely love it. It's one to sip, but for the style (and what I'd guess the ABV to be) it's incredibly refreshing and drinkable. I enjoyed this one over a couple hours, but only through the sheer willpower of wanting to get a good review out of it and the selfishness of wanting to save it for as long as possible. I often wish that we could easily get Central Waters stuff in Virginia, but really, really wish we could get this one specifically--I would definitely love to have this one over and over again."
"D: Awesome looking and smelling beer, just have problems with the hotness and rather spicy leather alcohol finish. I look forward to purchased some more of these and letting them get a little age on them."
"D: While this beer went down easy, I wouldn't call it ""sessionable"" to high of alcohol. Still, a very drinkable beer. One to share with ""those you like"" :)"
"Overall, really enjoyed this beer. Definitely would not mind getting another one of these."
"Tasty."
"D- the strong alcohol presence makes this a slow sipping one and done type of beer. id like to revisit this vintage again in the future, but not for a while."
"Overall, very interesting and quite nice. An excellent barleywine worth picking up if you get the chance."
"Pours a dark brown with minimal head. What head that did form, disappeared in a few seconds. Very little lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is very complex. I detect bourbon, vanilla, coconut, and some dark fruit. Alcohol is noticed. A nice flavor as well. Surprisingly the bourbon is not the prominent flavor. It is vanilla with dark fruit mostly until the bourbon comes into focus. The finish is very warm with alcohol but not harsh. Unfortunately there is not much flavor that actually comes from the base beer. It is all barrel. Full bodied with low carbonation that lends a nice texture. A good example, not great. I wonder how an older example would taste?"
"D: This has got to be one of the very best BBBW's being produced right now. Hands down. Smooth, complex, and best of all, not overly hot, ragged, or skull crushingly strong. Sure, it's meant to be sipped but those sips were coming pretty quickly for me."
"This is pretty damn nice right now.... I don't know if any more age is gonna help it though.. I think with another year, the malts may become a bit cloying and leave the hops behind and not be as balanced."
"12 ounce bottle- 2009 vintage. Pours a ruby chestnut with good clarity and a one finger light brown head. Nose- ripe dark fruit, fig, big toasty malts, vanilla and sweet bourbon. Taste- very sweet blast of bourbon and caramel malts followed by raisins and spruce. Pretty boozy. Mouthfeel- low carbonation, thick and chewy from the huge malt bill. Drying finish from alcohol heat and reasonably high hopping. An interesting brew."
"Pours deep copper with light tan head. Nice aroma with tasty wood and bourbon notes that don't really over shadow the fruity esters and faint maltiness. The alcohol heat does build up and singe the nose a bit. The taste starts with mildly sweet maltiness and roasty malts that then becomes wood and barrel like flavors before a formidable vanilla flavor takes hold. There's also dark fruity esters of grapes, cherries and prunes before the alcohol hotness builds to a distracting level. It could use more age. Darn tasty now though"
"I'm thrilled with the way the bourbon came through on this beer for being so young. Almost too young perhaps. I have another that I'll age for a year to compare against. It does remind me of some of the young 2008 GI BCS I had."
"Pours a dark amber brown color with a small off-white head that had a lasting cap but no lacing. Aroma is lightly oxidized, plenty of sticky sweet malt, a bit of hoppiness, rounded out by a touch of oak. Taste is mucho oak, vailla, caramel, and dark fruits galore. I can definitely pick out some raisins and over-ripe fruits in this one, a nice kick of piney hops, loads of caramel. Very sweet and becomes even more so as it starts to warm. Bourbon wasn't very present, but the musty, wet oak barrel was. Carbonation is nearly absent, smooth, sippable, delicious. This one tastes pretty good but there's just a touch of oxidation in the nose and in the flavor. Not sure if the bottle was starting to go bad, but it had just a hint of that oxidized cardboard taste. Still pretty darn good and I hope the other bottle I picked will age gracefully."
"Overall a favorite beer no doubt. I love this thing time and time again"
"Drinkability: An unbelievable beer. A remarkable array and assortment of flavors in near perfect balance provides for a true treat, whether alone or with dessert. No burn at all, and, well, since I don't know what the abv% is, I can't really knock any points off for drinkability there ... right? I'm going to guess between 9.5% and 10.5%, though at this level, my margin of error gets a little screwy. Regardless, this is a well-crafted beer with a good - albeit mild - nose, a fantastic mouthfeel and flavor profile, exceptional drinkability for the style, and one I would insist anyone who sees buys up instantly. And then mail it to me."
"D - Going to be slow drinking this thing."
"Some heat at first that's soon eclipsed by a gargantuan battle cruiser of bourbon and malt flavors. If you like those two things, you can't go wrong. Sweet vanilla aftertaste, plenty of rich malt and some residual hop bitterness. Drying finish, somewhat concealed in the booze department. Rich and syrupy feel, thankfully dry on the end like Y2K and not a sickly sweet aftertaste like so many barleywines. The barrel is integrated here, and it's not too hot, but you know deep down this is a booze bomb. Plenty of warmth, but not in the taste. Very well done overall, one to look forward to every year."
"12oz bottle thanks to CaptainCougar. Hazy brown with a small beige head. Sweet bourbon, lightly tart wood, plenty of malt, and fruit in the aroma. The flavor is mellow and malty with a nice bourbon and caramel touch. The balance of the beer and the barrel is great, with just a light wood flavor and not much alcohol. Full bodied with medium-light carbonation. Very nice barrel integration, with a good spread of flavors."
"Poured into my st sebastiaan tulip. Picked up in a trade with Brian23456. thanks. Dark brown with a reddish brown tint with some light passing through. Thin frothy head with white lacing that sticks, nice. Slight bourbon, molasses, brown sugar, berry compote, fantastic! Taste of bourbon covered chocolate with a oak bitterness on the finish. The dry oakiness/bitterness starts to wear on me. Mouthfeel had a little to much carbonation, but was still enjoyable. I'd like to see how this ages to mellow out the finish. Hard to have more than one."
"This was gone in no time flat as its balance was outstandingly nice between its malty chewyness and bourbony hinted, earthy vanilla warming. Remarkable stuff by Central Waters!"
"D - Would love to drink these all night, a couple of reasons why not but this one is worth having !!!"
"D-About as good as a BBA barleywine can get. The folks at CW sure know how to barrel aged beers. I am surprised they remain under the radar, but in a way I am glad they do! A well kept Wisconsin secret! Keep up the great work CW!"
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and smooth with low carbonation."
"I wish this were more widely available. Central waters only recently made it to Hudson, and at this point I think I'd be missing out if they hadn't. Highly recommended."
"If this was a one-time, brewery only release of about 1000 bottles in a 750 ml bottle, the hype would be insane."
"Central Waters has a huge hit with Bourbon Barrel Barleywine. This is my first beer from them and I'm extremely impressed. The flavor is simply massive and deep. The bourbon barrel aging adds an excellent flavor here. I didn't know what to expect, but damn...this is good stuff. I've been sitting on a few bottles from Central Waters and I'm now extremely excited to try them out. Alex, I should've hit you up for more than one bottle of this stuff. If you're reading this, you're wasting time that you should be spending tracking down Central Waters beer. Go find it!"
"Good mouthfeel, with carbonation being on the lower side. Very complex all the way around. An outstanding beer."
"Drinkability- The beer is honestly a bit sweet but not bad for it being as young as it is. I'm not 100% sure the sweetness will ever be toned down, even after some age, but everything should even out a bit. Definitely will only get better. Thanks very much Steve!"
"This is a fantastic beer and one of the best barleywines I have yet to have. Seek this out, I will be enjoying this again in the future."
"You can't drink a lot of these in a sitting, but this velvety barleywine is so unique and delicious. Central Waters needs more reach as this beer should be enjoyed by as many as possible."
"Bottle courtesy bulletrain76. Pours a muddy reddish brown color with a smallish off-white head. Huge bourbon aroma with really no other notes. Vanilla and coconut. Flavor is bourbony as well, not much beer to be found here. Finish is dry and slightly bitter. Definitely too heavy on the barrel here but it still tastes good."
"D: Despite the mystery ABV on this beer its very nice to drink on. I'm not going to be pounding these, but I would definitely drink this all night long."
"This is a nice beer with great drinkability. Very tasty."
"This is much more enjoyable than I was expecting. The coconut notes from the barrel are really nice and it really works with the thick, sweet, rich base beer; without the barrel influence, the base beer might note even be all that good or balanced. The aroma is not as complex as the flavor, but it is quite distinct with its inviting coconut note. This is definitely an enjoyable beer that I am quite glad to have tried."
"D- Not the most drinkable BW I've ever had, but overall it's such a tasty beer."
"2010 revisted on 12/23/10. Doesn't have the sweetness of 2009, but after a year the alcohol burn has faded and it's woody and dry with an appropriate bite. (early 2010 had solvents ruining things). Excited for the 2011 batch."
"Taste begins sweet, passes through some leathery tannins in the middle, barrel character near the close, and then alcohol comes on full bore at the end. Numb lips, warming down the gullet, it's all there. Mouthfeel is way smooth, and drinkability is good in the I want another sometime sense, not the I want another bottle or three right now sense. At least not if you have any sense, with abv such as it is."
"D: highly drinkable for the flavor but less so for the alcohol kick"
"Not as good as Abacus or Angel's Share (when carbonated), but still pretty terrific."
"Overall: Fantastic barleywine, can't think of any better I've had. Would be much more drinkable if the sweetness was down a notch. One bottle is perfect. Pick this one up if you can find it, I'm sure it will soon be on the top 10 of the style."
" ~ This is a good beer. I've been a fan of the Central Waters brand and I have to say, ""they haven't let me down here either."" I'm thinking they may never let me down. I appreciate that. Thanks CW."
"Find this. Drink this. Great beer."
"d: It's been a long time since I've been so sad to see an empty glass. This was just spectacular. I need more from Central Waters."
"Overall- This does not taste much like a barley wine to me. The bourbon and oak character kind of take over letting the original beer be a subtle after thought. With that said, this is still a great beer. Great flavor, aroma and mouth feel."
"D- This is an excellent bourbon barleywine. Great to sip on anytime. I will certainly seek this out again in the future."
"Everything about it is complex, great example of a barrel aged barley wine. Phenomenal beer, especially for the price, after trying one on tap at the release I bought a case. I hope I have enough."
"Update: Received the 2009 vintage in a trade with eyncognito and bumped the drinkability up to 4.5"
"The body is closer to big than moderate. A big plus is that the beer is so easy to drink. Overall a great barleywine. Thanks to flyingbison for the trade. A hidden gem for sure."
"Notes from: 4/29/08"
"3.5/3.5/3.5"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Rich, sweet, full on the palate. Moderate bitterness keeps things balanced, but this is a definite slow sipper. Bourbon flavors are very much present, but in balance with the base beer. Slight sherry-like oxidation has begun to set in, which adds a nice layer of complexity. This one should age nicely for years to come. The finish is bittersweet, with bitter eventually taking the edge. Very solid stuff, as someone who isn't a big barleywine fan I liked this quite a bit."
"Hazy amber brownish color with a beige head that has decent retention and lacing. Aroma just amazes me; I absolutely love their bourbon beers, haven't had anything else that compares. Sweet caramel, bourbon, and vanilla; just such an amazing aroma. Taste echoes the aroma. Whatever they do, the flavors just hit me perfectly. Thicker than medium body, somewhat light carbonation, but goes down very smooth. Another excellent barrel aged beer from Central Waters. Keep it up!"
"Other than the over-the-top wood (which really ruins this beer for me), I get English flavors only without the sweetness. Strange, to say the least. And, sure, I get bitterness but I associate that with tannins from the wood and not with hops. A most unpleasant experience. Given another 10 years in the bottle I might think about actually drinking one (as in, when it has mellowed down to something only slightly more extreme than a normal barleywine) but, as it is, neither I nor the wife even wants to smell it again."
"Certainly worth trying but this falls a little short for me."
"I love my wife, my guitars, my car and my own homebrew, but this beer is my favorite thing. It is very limited and hard to get aholf of, basically because I buy it all up whenever I see it. It takes me about an hour or two to finish a bottle. I think they use the same barrels as thier cherry stout, so expect slight cherry flavors to come through when it is warm. Drink at room temp. Wash over your tongue. This beer changed my freakin' life!"
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. the barrel character is present but not overpowering and works very well. this is my second favourite bourbon barrel barleywine behind kuhnhenn's. really great stuff. glad i still have another in the cellar."
"Pours a hazy dark orange, pumpkin colour, light bit of brown, thin off white head forms, drops immediately to a ring around the glass, not much lacing, looks okay. Smell is crazy, tons of bourbon, toffee, oak, vanilla, very buttery, alcohol, rum raisins, very malty, bourbon really complements. Taste is intense, big toffee, rough alcohol edge, bourbon, vanilla and oak, coconut, more toffee, raisins, bananas Foster, toasty butter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. This stuff is great, right amount of bourbon and great oak flavour, need to get some more of these. Thanks Russ!"
"D - Too much of a good thing for long term."
"Top knotch, I think I am starting to prefer bourbon aged strong ales over bourbon aged stouts. At least until my next BA stout. The residual sugars in this barleywine really pick up the complexities created by the barrels."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a wonderful cloudy amber color with a 1 1/2 in white head that leaves a nice cap on the brew and lacing sticky as glue! The smell is a wonderful bouquet of plum, raisin, grapes, and some hints of caramel and floral hops. This has a lot going on and in my first sip it was not jumbled it was subtly smooth. The taste is sharp with fruits that meld into a delightful flavor. The brew is a medium body with just enough carbonation to let the taste explode in your mouth. Great work, a must have brew!"
"D: I wish I had more than one."
"D- This beer is all about the big caramel sweet malt with some nice support from the pine hops and a very faint hint of barrel only after each sip. This beer does not have much depth of flavor but the flavors it does have are big and robust. I kind of miss the alcohol kick that cleans out the sweetness at the finish but it still goes down smooth."
"Served in a very large red wine glass at roughly cellar temperature. Purchased 06/08 consumed 10/08. Will definitely try to pick up a bottle for longer term storage."
"Dark brass-like orange with a small whipped meringue head of off-white foam. Aromas of bourbon, oak, vanilla, and bitter candy coated green monster hops. Taste is similar to the aroma but more intense. VERY hoppy with a lovely biscuity candy malt sweetness in the back and great swirling oak, vanilla, and bourbon flavors. Mouthfeel is medium/thick, drinkability is good, but not perfect, as this is definitely a sipper. A real treat from a small fantastic Wisconsin brewery that is really doing everything right when it comes to these barrell aged project beers."
"This is a wonderful little brewery from Wisconsin and this is the second simply spectacular barrel aged beer I've had from Central Waters (their bourbon-barrel aged stout being the other). I owe a big thanks to the Packers Fan who made both possible, thanks nflmvp, this was one serious treat!"
"I would recommend this beer. I found it different than other barley-wines and really good-tasting. I bought this 12oz bottle at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"D: An awesome sipper."
"Great barleywine, courtesy of Derek. Alias the Y2K barrel-aged. The bourbon aroma is mellow and pleasing The ruby colour and white bubbly head. Beatiful lace. Rich taste, the bourbon is intrinsic and its mellowed somewhat.Woody,sweetish, balanced. ABove average mouthfeel.A great sipper."
"Good stuff."
"Wonderful taste of deep stone fruits and roasty malt, deeply satisfying. One of the best all time, a sipper for sure."
"Overall I really cannot say enough good things about this one. One of the best Barley wines I have ever tasted and really just a testament to how good something can get with Barrel aging. I would love to try this one again any day of the week!"
"D - Slightly on the sweet side for my tastes but a very nice sipper with great bourbon qualities (me likes me my bourbon)."
"M/D: Clean for a barley wine. Nice bourbon finish, along with a little boozy heat. I am glad I bought 2 of these, one for now, one to cellar."
"Hell....I'm thinking of buying a really good oak aged sipping bourbon now. This was wonderful."
"Pours a cloudy deep copper with a dense head that dissipated quickly to a ring foam leaving sporadic lacing. The first aroma is the big sweet caramel malt smell with raisins, dates and subtle earthy hops. This is followed by a big bourbon backbone along with some sweet vanilla beans. The taste actually has more bourbon than the smell with a more prominent molasses sweetness. The caramel malts and earthy hops are still there as well, but the bourbon really comes out in the taste with a serious alcohol burn. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very creamy. The is a very good bourbon barleywine but the heavy bourbon presence means that getting through one of these would make for a good night. Update: I've had quite of few of these now. With 6-12 months on it, this beer is one of the best beers I've ever had. Fantastic."
"Cheers."
"Thanks goes to EliteDigger for a couple bottles of this in a recent trade!"
"Drinkability: This is pretty, Central Waters. I'll cheerfully admit that."
"Pours dark orange red with a slight 1/16 inch head and low lacing. Very lightly carbonated. Strong bourbon malt smell. Bold bourbon-malt flavor that is smooth and balanced. This is very good and the 11.2% ABV is certainly in your face. The malt tastes goes very well with the bourbon. This is worth buying. Very enjoyable! World Class!"
"12 oz. from dirty louis, into my Brooklyn snifter"
"Great barleywine all around. I'm not sure whether I like this or the regular Kosmyk Charlie better, but this is a good use of bourbon barrel aging...does not overwhelm, but mellows a bit and adds a few dimensions to the flavor."
"To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of bourbon-barreled Barleywines (especially hoppy ones like this), as I often find the barrel aging to be at odds with the hop profile, and the result ends up with a bunch of clashing colors. This achieves glory by compartmentalizing the barleywine and bourbon barrel traits up until the very end. And when they finally do converge, its absolutely harmonious. It's the best example of the style (specifically: booze barreled b'wines) that I've come across. And I can't think of another that even comes close."
"This is a brew I'd love to have every day for the rest of my life. Great barrel aging art on this. Rich and creamy middle showing off caramel and toffee. Ripe dates and dried figs, alcohol, brown sugar, rum soaked raisin, thick tight vanilla and wood with a Jefferson's Reserve bourbon flavor. I have no clue what bourbon barrels they used or why I even said that. A showing of residual sugar towards the late middle ends in earthy hop bitter bliss balancing things impressively."
"Very well done."
"D: I really don't think more than one per sitting is doable, but you'll enjoy that one!!!"
"Props to BA nflmvp for this beer on the day the NFL MVP said his good-bye."
"drinkability: a monster"
"D- pretty solid, well enjoyed, the kosmik might be better but its still solid"
"This is a really well crafted beer, the bourbon notes really made it great. Highly recommended."
"Long lasting in the mouth, never quitting...very satisfying flavor...like an orange wedge doused in cognac! So good! An excellent nightcap, which this is tonight...lovely, lovely..."
"This beer took a lot of the same flavor cues from the non-bourbon ale. This adds a light whiskey element near the end. The aroma is pleasant, with the oak and vanilla, but still too weak. The drinkability was pretty good and unlike many other barleywines. Worth a try, very tasty."
"Label is the same as the regular Kosmyk Charlies Y2K Catastrophe Ale, but with a circle shaped green sticker on the right side of the label that states, ""aged in bourbon barrels."" Only available at the brewery. Ruby brown color. Fairly powerful nose, mainly dominated by the bourbon barrel (vanilla, bourbon, oak, coconut.) Palate is okay, could be more textured and creamier. Flavor is good, but not sublime. Fairly well balanced, but the flavors dont come together very well. Ive had several better bourbon barrel aged barley wines."
"A ""by the fire sipper"" or put it in a flask and go play in the snow beer."
"Wow, HUGE hit from the guys at Central Waters. Too bad this one is so limited. It sounds like we may see this one again next winter. Damn, I sure hope so!"
"A huge thanks to nflmvp for sending this rare barleywine my way. As soon as I uncapped the bottle, my nose was bombarded with tropical fruit aromas. It was then that I knew I was in for a real treat. Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my snifter glass and allowed to warm up for 30 minutes. Served at 55°F. Appears a slightly cloudy, deep amber-red color with barely half an inch of tan head. The head fades rather quickly, leaving a thin ring around the inside of the glass and no lacing to speak of. Smells of tropical fruits (mainly pineapple), as well as toasted coconut, vanilla, bourbon, caramel malt, and oak. The bourbon really hits you upfront once you take a sip, as it should. This is followed by notes of pineapple, more bourbon, prunes, vanilla, and a nice peppery bite across the tongue. Great malt balance. The alcohol burn starts as soon as you take a sip and continues into the dry finish, although, it is always kept in check. Mouthfeel is a notch or two above medium in both body and carbonation. For me, this is certainly a sipper in order to take in all this beer has to give you. I'm glad I was able to try this rich and complex barleywine. I'd love to revisit it in a year or so to see how it's changed. If you have the chance, definitely give this one a try."
"Thanks to theFatKid13 for the bottle - :thumbup: F'n Furley!!!"
"Steve, thank you for the opportunity."
"Drinkability: Typical for a barley-wine, enjoyable for sipping, but I wouldn't want to drink more than one or two in a session."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
