"O - 4.5 - A very good representation of the barleywine style. Well balanced flavor."
""
""
"Great balance between tasty hops and solid malts, both really rich and strong, without one overpowering the other."
"Overall - Despite a lot of negativity, I really enjoyed this one."
""
""
"To start off this was a beer that was aged in a plastic keg for a year. I had to ask the bartender if it was the barrel aged or the normal big worse. Very boozy not smooth at all lots of hot alcohol in it. I would like to try this beer out of the bottle maybe sitting in plastic for a year was not a good idea. The boozy whiskey like flavor kinda drowned out everything in this beer. The head was non existent and the only aroma I could get was alcohol notes. This beer definitely needs a second try for me."
"Probably the worst thing I've had mikkeller. The name is about right on this one."
"Full of sticky malt flavor with an almost syrupy consistency. Had on tap. Alcohol comes through very balanced with the bitterness."

"I certainly hope this was just a bad bottle because, if it wasn't, my-oh-my is this a terrible beer. The beer itself wasn't all too well-carbonated. The cork didn't come out with much of a pop either. I hope it's just a bad bottle for Mikkeller's sake."

"O-By far the highest abv I've seen in a barleywine; this brew is a one hitter quitter! I love everything Mikkeller does...brilliance in brewing!"

"Pours a brownish body with moderate head and lace and textbook aroma of citric, earthy hops and a hearty malt aroma of both bready, roasted malts and sweet malt. A good barleywine and mostly holds up, but it seems at some points the alcohol make it a tad bitter or burning on the backend. Overall, the hops give it citric zip and spice and the sweet malts make themselves known, and it has a little stickiness and tart/dark fruit edge. It is a good beer, designed to be a sipper, that just a has a couple of small chinks in the armor or else it'd be one of the betters ones out there."
"Bottle courtesy of beastmaster. Pours cloudy opaque brown with no head. Aroma of biscuits, toffee, malt, brown sugar, molasses, hints of vanilla and bourbon even though not bourbon barrel aged. Taste is watery big bready malt and booze. Turpentiney, and thinner than expected. Lots of chewey sediment. No carbonation. Vodka burn. Was not ready for this after Chocolate Rain and some other beers tonight."

"O: disappointing coming from mikkeller. the flavors weren't particularly complex. the mouth feel was a little thin. barleywine is one of my favorite styles and mikkeller is one of my favorite brewers, but this one missed its mark."
"375 ml bottle into snifter, best before 3/18/2014. Pours very hazy and cloudy dark brown color with no head or carbonation; plastic corks never work. Aromas of big raisin, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, roasted malt, floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity and malty notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, light roast, floral, and toasted earthiness; some slight oxidation but barely noticeable. No bitterness; with lingering notes of raisin, caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, brown bread, chocolate, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Nice flavor balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate fruity notes; with no cloying sweetness present after the finish. Zero carbonation and medium-full bodied; with slick and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is ok, but very slow to sip on. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this this a solid barleywine. Some nice complexity and balance of malt flavors; probably would have scored quite a bit higher if it actually had carbonation, but thankfully not much oxidation was present. An enjoyable sipper."

"O: Total bummer. I found this ""gem"" in the back of a cooler at Ledgers with the price tag showing that they recieved it in Feb of 2009. I knew this was an old beer when I got into it, but figured if it's sitting back in the fridge it would be worth a shot. Man was I wrong. Got about 2 sips in before I drain poured it. All well, live and learn. Worth the risk."
"O- It gets better as I finish it, not sure if the taste is improving or the 12.0% ABV has kicked in."
""
""
"I won't be finishing this. Pretty disappointing. I've got another bottle but I'm not too excited to give it another shot."
"Reading the date-stamped reviews of others, its apparent that Mikkeller has gotten better at making this beer. It's an incredible American-style Barleywine that captures the preferred malt character of hearty English examples. Its a bright and highly rewarding ale for nightcapping any evening."

"O: Really nice barleywine, would love to try fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this sitting around for a while and finally got around to drinking it, I almost wish I had someone to share it with but what can you do"
""
"O: A simple and strong barleywine. Honestly I liked Big Worst better, it was better balanced and tastier in general, despite being flat. This one is pretty ""meh""."
""
"Overall: I wish this tasted like it smelled. End of story."
"O: Not quite as bad as I expected from the pour, but not very good."
"Wow, a pretty easy-drinking Yankee barleywine, if there ever was. Big, brash, but somehow subtle at the same rate, with a deftly integrated upsized alcohol quotient. Totally worth giving a go, especially given our early winter. November 1, really?"

"a true oddity, and perhaps the first mikkeller beer that didnt blow me away. it pours a cloudy light amber to red color with a ton of big yeast particles floating around and finally settling to the bottom. there is almost no head. the nose is alcohol and caramel english malt. flavor is the same, but spiced up a bit from the yeast. it feels like the right mix of flavors for fall, but the alcohol is strong and caustic, and it hurts the overall product. the mouthfeel would be great without the alcohol burn. its got a nice full body but is well carbonated and therefore seems to dance in the mouth, even with all that sediment. the booze just kills it though, warm on the way down too. overall a very unique take on a barleywine, but not somehting i will spend 15 dollars on again. although, my local shop has the red wine version too, which might be nice to try. we'll see..."
"Overall: I thought this was better than previous reviews would have me believe. Perhaps since it's a Mikkeller brew hopes were higher by for some people. Is it my favorite American barleywine ever? No. Is it something I would drink again? Yes. The price may be slightly high for the size of the bottle but I would recommend giving this beer a shot."
"O:  From reading some reviews I was kind of bummed, but after tasting this for myself I can say it surprised me. This is far better than expected, granted its outrageously overpriced, but that aside its fantastically complex and Well blended. The yeast settlement was rather large and chunky but not at all a ruiner.  If the price was cheaper I would buy this on a regular basis but it's too steep for my pockets. Well done. "
""
"Carbonation is perfectly soft, body seems overtly syrupy though."
""
""
"I sipped this for about 3 hours, yes, 12oz for 3 hours. i enjoyed drinking it at that pace, it was enjoyable and i would savor an evening with it again, but it is a bit expensive for what it really is."
""
"O - I could imagine a 2009 bottle being really good at this point, but the 2007 vintage is well past its prime. Cool to try, but wouldn't have it again. I suggest you open anything from 2009/2008/2007 ASAP."
"O - OK. But, won't be going out of my way to buy again. I will be aging a bottle for a year and will report back the differences. However, if you're looking for something delicious right out of the glass, Mikkeller has many more great offerings available."
"Overall: Not sure of the age of this bottle as I got it as an extra in a recent trade (cannot remember who sent it) but am rather disappointed in this beer, regardless of bottling date as a Barleywine should hold up better than this one has"
""
""
""
"T/M/O: Meh. It's pretty decent. Thick-sweet, and very flat, with no carbonation whatsoever. Rich grape juice and trace caramel. Not very satisfying. A pretty damn boring barleywine, all told. Not one of Mikkeller's greater beers. Sweet and flat, with very little depth of flavour or mouthfeel."
"O: Just ok, definitely a sipper and felt near the end like I was just trying to get through it, not something I look for in a $10 a bottle beer."
"Overall - Inexcusable amounts of sediment. Am I supposed to pour it in? Or save it for a hideous second glass? At $10 a bottle, it's a travesty to have to leave 15% behind. That said, the beer itself isn't awful, but I'm not about to buy it or drink it again."
"Got this on growler and it pours an impressive very dark non see through mahogany hue and leaves a three finger creamy moon faced head and lacing everywhere,the smell is hoppy as with aromas of pine,grapefruit,orange zest,xmas pudding and toffee and to be quite honest very similar to a DIPA,the mouthfeel is just full bodied and warming with tastes of burnt toffee,boozy alcohol,marzipan,caramel treacle,fruitcake and finished with a candied citrus bittersweetness thats more sweet than bitter and overall its a nice enough drop but probably a little hoppier than your usual Barleywines cheers."
"D: Greatly drinkable and balanced for such a big beer."
"C+"
"O- I can only imagine how smooth and balanced it will become overtime. I'll sure be picking up another one of these to age."

"O: I find this to be a nice barleywine. I particularly love the fruity, sweet flavor profile and the fact that the hops don't overwhelm all of the malt and alcohol flavors. I just wish the body were a bit fuller..."
""
""
"O- Quite impressive. It doesn't have the Mikkeller signature boozy taste. Good flavor, good aroma and decent price."
""
""
"People that drink barleywine do it for their own reasons. For some it's high end malt liquor. For others; beer multiplied. Me? I like to hide them away, forget about them for a decade and break them out on a cold and rainy Tuesday. This would stand up well, as it's already almost flat and has lots of both malt and hops. May grab another for the cellar."

"The yeast dregs don't add much to the hop centric drive and rich imperial body."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a pint glass, didn't see a best on date but it was a green bottle. This pours a very yeast dreg filled hazy brown, with a very frofty thick tan head. The smells are very fruity, full of sweet malts, some caramel and a little hops. The feel is pretty thick. The taste is pretty good, a load of sweet fruit and caramel malts, a bit of hop bitterness and a little alcohol burn on the way down. Overall this was pretty good and worth getting, but honestly bigfoot at the same price for a 6 pack as a single bottle of this is better and a better deal."
""
"Overall- A very enjoyable barleywine that will only get better with age."
"Final thought - $14 is high but at 12% and yummy it is worth a try"
""
"O :Nothing I wouldnt expect from Mikkeller a delicious multifaceted beer but i dont think i could drink more then one"
""
""
"overall: picked up a half case of these in June, so interested to see what age will do with this."
""
""
""
"taste is okay with some similar characteristics as the smell. didn't find this to have the best balance, with each sip being either too sweet or too boozy. overall kinda disappointed, it was sort of drinkable but not that enjoyable."
""
""
"Pours a deep orange color. Semi-hazy but I can see through to the other side. Head is a thin ring of lace, but I do see tiny bubbles stuck to the glass and rising to the surface. I can see sediment in the bottle so I poured this very slowly as to not disturb the yeast. I succeeded. Aroma is toffee, caramel, pine, and some faint citrus. Smells very sweet. I like this so far. Starts off cloying in the mouth. Tons of caramel sweetness comes first, then comes the toffee. The brew then takes a complete 180 and morphs into a nice pine flavor that leaves a dry finish in the mouth. Overall, incredible beer. The alcohol is there in the taste, but not overly boozy. The nice dry finish keeps this from being too sweet. Surprisingly balanced. Definitely different from other barley wines out there, but that makes it memorable."
"Overall I liked this beer but remember a little more bourbon barrel presence the last time I tried it."

"Overall Drinkability - This thing kicks you in the mouth with out even a noticeable hop presence."
"D: Mikkeller beers can be hit or miss in my experience, this kinda falls in between, interesting take on an American barleywine."
"O - The boozy flavour is not hidden enough and dominates the flavour."
"O - Powerful, dark, sweet, delicious. Needs a sharp cheese to partner up with for maximum results."
"O: I'm always happy when someone brings a Mikkeller beer to a tasting. I can't think of a more consistently awful brewery, and I feel I don't rate harshly enough most of the time. This brewery is a good way to bring that average town. Usually $15 a pop for bottled garbage. Still, this one is unpleasant but not totally irredeemable. For Mikkeller, it's even good."
"Nicely balanced, sweet with bitter finish. Good barleywine."
"O-Three years seems to be the sweet spot on this one. It hasn't been hurt by lack of carbonation. There's a slight edge of oxidation creeping in, so if you have any 2008 bottles lying around, now would be a good time to open them."
"This brew poured out as a brown colored liquid with a very small amount of head. The head that was there vanished really fast. The smell of the beer has some nice sweet dark fruit aromas, some are a little more pungent but it's a unique aroma. The taste of the beer has a good amount of hops that tingle the tongue while the sweetness of the beer unfolds. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad here but I feel it could have been better. Overall this beer wasn't too bad, I'd like to get a fresher bottle sometime."
"D: This was a very potent barleywine, with bold and tasty flavors. The body was ok, but it was pretty hot, so it must be sipped. Age would probably really help mellow and integrate the flavors. It was still enjoyable fresh, but not excellent."
"I had been eyeing this beer for awhile so when I saw it on sale for $6 I snatched it. Big mistake. Reddish-brown cor with no head and no carbonation whatsoever. Smells oxidized, old, like really old cake or something. The taste is cardboard, sugar, just not good at all. Mikkeller is just too hit or miss for me with the misses outweighing the hits by far."
"Overall I am very pleased with this beer. I was worried that it was going to be a round house kick in the mouth or make me grow a full beard by the time I was done drinking it. I would imagine this beer is still not for everyone. Not my favorite Mikkeller beer but I still like it."
"On the whole it isn’t a bad beer but it falls a little flat."
"O: A delicious beer. Not at the same level as Big Worst, but still a delight. Alcohol nearly imperceptible. Worth seeking out."
"thick brown, though you can see some light through it, no head and a nice lace top it off. Smell is hopped for sure, but with a subtle sugary undertone, and a hint of alcohol too. Taste is not very strong at all. There is the natural piney hoppness you would expect from a barley wine, but not too strong, there is also a sugary, nuttiness about it as well. The alcohol is there, and that keeps this a sipper. It is actually nicely carbonated, and not harsh going down, has the warm feeling on the way. Overall this was a good brew,"
"O: Not to bad, sat well with me, would not mind drinking another, easy drinker"
"FAIL!!!"
"SkÅL!"
"O: This is a surprisingly easy to drink beer. Not the most physically attractive beer, but drinkable nonetheless."
"Overall I like the flavor of this beer, but it isn't backed up as well by the supporting elements. I've got the Bourbon Barrel edition sitting in the cellar, will try that soon."
"Killer brew. A bit over priced like all Mikkeller’s but still very happy with the purchase."
"Overall, not a bad drink. Just wish it had a little more carbonation. Was kind of like drinking an ugly looking wine."
"Pours an ugly brown color with loads of sediment toward the bottom of the bottle. No head or lacing. The nose carried caramel, toffee, cherry, and dark fruits. There was a bit of light booze in the background as well. The flavor focused on malt sweetness with some mild fruit. Caramel held throughout, as well as a bit of alcohol. Medium body and slightly boozy. Not bad at all."
"O. Overall pretty solid barleywine. Too thin of mouthfeel for me. Flavor was not as complex as some of the best."
"A bit to sweet, wonder if it will develop a better balance over time. Tasted at a beer sampling at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"Overall, this is a great beer, whenever I come across it, I usually buy two or three bottles and drink them over the course of a few months, unless greedy guests come over empty-handed and thirsty (you know who you are...)."
"D: There's no way that I could drink more than one fo these in a sitting because of its strong alcohol content."
"D: Overall, I do like this beer, but seems a little thin for a barley wine. The toffee sweetness makes this beer drinkable for the style."
"Drinkability: At 12% this is certainly a one a done...but a good one and done. Thank you again Mikkeller for such a good brew."
"On tap at ChurchKey in Washington, DC. Poured into a snifter glass. Served beer near room temperature which is the norm at ChurchKey. Pours an opaque caramel brown with a surprisingly big beige head that recedes slowly, leaving streaks of lacing and legs after each swirl. The aroma has heavy alcoholic hops than I was expecting with a biting citrus zing and plenty of underlying caramel malts. Maybe even some caramelized esters (apples) as well. The taste is hefty with more alcohol burn even more so than the aroma suggests. The citrus hops are there but give way to the massive sugary sweetness of the malt backbone. The finish has a serious alcohol burn and a scathing bitterness, both of which limit the drinkability. The mouthfeel is sticky and thick, almost syrupy but with a ton of alcohol. This is a massively sweet and boozy barleywine that is definitely not the most drinkable I've had in the style. Abrasive but tasty stuff. This barleywine is definitely not for the faint of heart..."
"Opinion: Well, overall this is really a pretty good beer, so I have been pleasantly surprised. That said, I don't really think that it is worth the price you pay for it...but it is ready to drink right now...so how much is that worth to you? Most Barley Wines, especially American styles are green as heck when they hit the shelves, so you have to let them sit for at least a couple years before they stop making you make a face after your first sip. This beer isn't like that and is ready now. Not having to wait may be worth the $6 to $8 more a bottle that you are paying, that is up to you. This is a good beer, and one that is worth drinking. I imagine that you could cellar it, but I don't think that it would do much for it."
"Oxidation and a soy sauce-like element at some point made their home in this green glass bottle. The hops, as mention earlier, have also seen better days. That said, aging this beer was as much a choice as it was a necessity - in hindsight I prefer the more aggressive, more severe Big Worse to this more passive, devitalized version. Then again, in hindsight, I probably wouldn't have forked out the $10+ dollars for a 375ml bottle of either!"
"D-Very drinkable. Taste was gone in no time"
"D- Over all I love it! I recommend sitting on it in the right atmosphere for at least a year looking at these other reviews, I am a huge barleywine fan and this made my expectations, not to hot but just right. Perfect night cap."
"D: For 12%abv, this is a very approachable beer. I find it to have a smooth character and ended up drinking it quite quickly. Great experience, not detoured by Mikkeller at all, I would just question the conditions this bottle had been in from its birth to when I picked it off the shelf."
"Medium bodied and nicely balanced with a prominent earthy leathery malt character. There are some silky chocolate and toffee notes up front that are countered by a subtle hop bitterness and a very strong hot, boozy alcohol flavor. Sweet with hints of chocolate, toffee, biscuit and caramel but again the alcohol is the prominent flavor and is way too overpowering."
"D- its a pretty solid brew. Maybe a bit too hot and slightly all over the place but I'd go to say with a bit of time in the cellar this would be a very good american barleywine."
"Drinkability is ok, definitely a sipper. Big beer, nice on a cold night."
"M+D- Sipping beer. Perfect for a cold night. Worth a try!"
"M/D-seems to have a heavy alcohol bite. Classic barleywine thickness but not all that lively in my mouth. A touch bitter and no tingle. Mikkeller beers tend to be very hit or miss for me. This one kind of falls in the middle. All in all an interesting take on the style...bit heavy on the alc flavor but it doesn't ruin the beer. Worth a try for the fans of Mikkeller and the fans of the style."
"Not on the top of my great barleywines list. I'm not sure what is going on here but this one was a miss."
"Overall - Age has not been kind to this brew. It gets slightly bearable as it warms, but not enough to even think about finishing my glass. Too much heat."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are several others in the style that I would choose first."
"12.7 ounce caged and corked bottle, the bottle is at least a year old so it does have some age on it. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a murky copper/brown color with pretty much no head at all. Not much lacing either. Aroma is very sweet and malty, it smells like brown sugar, dark fruit (raisins, figs), and caramel. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like dark fruit (prunes, raisins), caramel, brown sugar, piney hops and booze. Alcohol is still a bit hot, maybe I should have aged this one longer. Mouthfeel/body is on the light side of medium, it's somewhat slick and coating with low/moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it would be better if the alcohol heat wasn't so noticable in the taste. This is definitely a sipping beer."
"A brownish cherry-red brew with a small tan head that sinks back into the brew quickly and leaves a smattering of lace. Smells of plums, raisins, cherries and caramel malts. A sweet and sour breadiness exists. Tastes big on the caramel malts with a nice hit of piny hops striking immediately afterward with some well-blended dark fruits at the end. The alcohol heat is evident, but mixes well, and is never overbearing. Has a medium mouth-feel and goes down creamy. Near spot-on with this one."
"jd"
"D - Very drinkable for a 12% ABV brew. Very tasty with some nice characteristics."
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown color. 1/7 inch head of an off-white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, hint of tart malt, slight citrus, slight hops, slight woody/earthiness, and alcohol. Fits the style of an American Barleywine. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, roasted malt, slight sweet malt, hops, slight citrus, and a hint of tart malt. Overall, lacking in appearance, but better in aroma, body, feel, and blend."
"2007 vintage. Pours a murky brown without too much head or lacing. Smells of brown sugar, dried fruit and caramel malt. Fairly boozy in the flavour, but still lots of sweetness. Not much bitterness, but that may have faded with the aging. Mouthfeel is a little bit thin."
"Poured into a small whiskey glass. Small head with a hazey, ruby coloreed body. No light permitted to make it through. The aroma is of unferemented sugars and plum fruit. The taste is complete unferemented sugars they overpower everything. It tastes like someone tried to add as much ferementables into this brew, but didn't have enough fire power with the yeast to get the finish. This is the first I have tried from Mikkeller and I'm not looking to try anything else from him soon."
"D: it was pretty drinkable for a 12%ABV barleywine but I think the smokey character might have been out of place. Well if it was intentional then the beer was above average across the board."
"Notes: Damn good. Mouthfeel suffers from lack of carbonation, but flavors are all right up my alley. Damn, son, this is dank!"
"Thanks Jason as forgot to post review last time."
"Alcohol is well handled, as is the palate overall. A nice beer, just lacks some of the finesse of other barleywines I've had."
"Did I miss ""Big Bad", or do comparatives not translate very well into Danish? Whatever the reason, this barleywine pours a hazy dark amber brown with a halo nof large bubbles for a head. The nose is plum, fig, raisin, molasses, and a small bit of hoppy citrus. The taste holds a strong note of bitter citrus peel, raisins, and the flesh of a mandarin orange (you always get that one fleshy wedge in every can...). The body is a hefty medium, with low carbonation and a lingering, dry bitterness accompanying a slight oral coating. Honestly, not that bad a brew, but not up to my expectations of that crazy Danish gypsy. Hm."
"D: This has nearly restored my faith in Mikkeller. Big Worse has become a really nice barleywine since the initial release and I wouldn't mind having another."
"Drinkability -- On the whole I don't care for flat beers, but this one still did it for me. So rich and decadent, but with enough bitter, spicy hop flavor to make it enjoyable and prevent it from being too cloying. Might not drink this again, but it certainly didn't waste my time."
"nice Danish brew. i will look out for more of their stuff, for sure"
"D- a sipper for sure."
"Very much a sipper. I wish I had a friend here to help me polish this off, because it's really not doing it for me. It seriously has much more in common with an English Old Ale than an American Barleywine. I probably would have given it higher marks if it were classified as an old ale."
"Dark color. Darkest barleywine I've ever seen. Not much carbonation nor head. The smell is malt thick. It's like the smell of malt extract used in the quick homebrewing recipes. I guess that is how a dense malt syrup should smell. Somehow the taste comes through to be more complex. It is definitely malt heavy (I may have got an old one). I don't really sense much hops at all. The taste also adds some smokey flavors. It's almost like it has been aged in burnt barrels, but it's not advertised that way and doesn't taste like bourbon at all. The beer has a nice aftertaste but it is too sweet to drink more than half a bottle. Interesting barleywine, with emphasis on the barley, but I like a stronger hop influence."
"Notes: Best by date: 02/07/12. A decent barleywine that is somewhat like a sweet Old Ale. Was somewhere between an English and American Barleywine with Belgian undertones. Pretty complex flavors with a good balance of fruit and dark malt with a hint of hops. It was an enjoyable sipper, but for the price, there are better options out there. Still probably worth a try."
"D: very good beer. wish i had more."
"Overall, maybe I waited too long, but I won't be buying this again."
"3/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5"
"D - This is a good barleywine, however, it is very big and very sweet."
"D - I gave this s just above average score because even though the beer is good the ABV is string and its not my fave Barleywine."
"12.7 oz green bottle corked and caged with a date of 2/17/12 on the synthetic cork. Pours a hazy brown color with no head and minimal amount of bubbles make their way to the surface. Nose is a big malt presence reeking of malt sweetness like raisins and dates soaked in whiskey. Little bit of citrus hops on the backend of the aroma. Taste is an assault of alcohol heat upfront with hop bitterness and a punch of smoked malt notes thy finishes with more alcohol warmth and citrus hops. Heavy feel with a very low carbonation level. Quite a good sipper with an interesting smoky/earthy character. I am uncertain if the 2/17/12 date was a best by date; it surely could be cellared at least that long to let that big alcohol taste mellow out. Regardless, nicely done."
"F: Some bitterness lingering, still sweet but dries off well. Heat and booze lingers, some malty sweet molasses lingers as well."
"Low carbonation and high alcohol make for a fairly thick and syrupy beer. Sweet candi sugar, raisin, and a stale hop character. It's a little sweeter than I prefer but it does dry out just enough in the finish to be ok."
"D: So strong, this is one serious beer. The one bottle was great but there is no way I could have had another bottle."
"Overall this was about what I expected it to be, just with less hops. Definitely an English barleywine and a good still version. Worth a shot."
"ADD- oh and WTF is with the super extra long cork...wtf."
"Drinkability: a sipper. I didn't like it"
"Big Worse missed the mark in several area in what I am assuming to be a young bottle. With that being said I would revisit this one again. For all its ""faults"" it is enjoyable. Given 2-5 years I would expect this to be nothing short of outstanding. I like this one but due to its sort comings at this age I have to rate drinkability lower than I would like. I like what Mikkeller does, this one just needs some age."
"edit: just read the bottle and I see they used all american hops. Ha! You'll notice my review made no mention of hops whatsoever. Who cares? I didn't miss them one bit. Convince yourself this is an ""extreme"" english barleywine, and you'll be in heaven."
"D- a slow sipper that is one and done for sure. horribly ugly looking, but you cant always judge a book by its cover. this one is worth a try."
"Might just have to pick up a few more bottles, this would be a great 'special occasion' beer."
"Pours murky brown with no head. Not a very attractive beer. The aroma is strong caramel malt with some dark fruit and alcohol. This smells very boozy. Flavor is lots of alcohol and dark fruit. Some raisins and still very boozy. Get some caramel malt. Medium mouthfeel, but too much alcohol to be very drinkable."
"Taste is very malty, with the same characteristics I was getting in the smell. Also toffee and some peppery spice. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style. A little syrupy, with an acceptable amount of carbonation. Despite the negativity, the drinkability actually doesn't suffer that much. It's a decent sipper and an obviously unique Barleywine."
"Has a very light carbonation, slightly watery on the finish but still a decent body. It's quite sharp and boozy with a noticeable warming sensation. Taste is a bit unpleasant, more like a wine or something than most barleywines. It's ok but I wouldn't seek it out."
"I imagine this is about at its peak - drink em up!"
"Toasty malts, toffee and caramel, nice earthiness, spices, light herbal/grassy hopping, cocoa powder. Nice dry finish. Feels smooth though with the age and lack of any substantial carbonation, sumptuous. Light drying in the finish. Still tasty though a little odd/scary when you first see it out of the bottle! A unique take on a barleywine."
"""Cough syrupy"" came one reply. ""Not as good as Hardy's"" came another. For mine, it is a good interpretation of style, if not understated...could have been more bitter and hop-driven."
"D: Its so freaking good that despite the intensity I find it very drinkable (because of the balance I think)."
"Notes: Another interesting beer from this brewer. This is a weak cousin of Thomas Hardy but fans of Thomas Hardy would likely enjoy it none the less."
"The cork popped out with almost no carbonation pop, and a vigorous pour got no foam at all--is this supposed to be flat? The color is very murky brown, with a slick oily surface. The nose is big and very malty: powdery cocoa, lots of caramel, and an underlying fruitiness. At taste, this is indeed hardly carbonated at all. Dense caramel malt dominates, with a lot of dry bitterness but not much hop flavor. Alcohol is quite apparent, sharp and peppery. Neither pleasant nor interesting; this is a rough barleywine without any subtlety."
"weird."
"A good beer. I would peg it as more of an big English barleywine than an American."
"Needs time, too young... Cork date barley legible... I think 07/12; that makes sense, it tastes like it's just under half-way ready. If I come across another bottle I would definitely consider putting it down until 2012 or later. But for today, I paid $10+ for a bottle of hightly alcoholic wort. I've had better from Mikkeller and expect better in the future. Cheers and brew-on!"
"Courtesy of some dude on RB, thanks. Pours clear copper with tan head. The aroma is grainy, alcohol, pale fruity esters and a bit uninspired. It isn't rich and inviting as a lot of barleywines tend to be. The flavor is herbal, hoppy, alcohol and some mild sweet malts. The hops are pine and grass. There's pale malts followed by a decent dose of an alcohol tingle near the finish. I will re-rate this beer with several years of age."
"Got this bottle at Sam's in Chicago a few months ago. Pours with no head and so no lace. Color is a very cloudy brown with amber highlights. Aroma is dark ripe fruits and vanilla, a little oak, and caramel. Flavor is about the same. Body is decent except it's almost flat. Only ever had one still beer I liked: Sam Adams Utopias. Finishi is shorter than I woulda thought. Not a session beer."
"This was one of the few barley wines that I have tried and also only my second Mikkeller. I was not overly impressed but did enjoy the drink but perhaps not for the price. 12.7oz corked bottle opened with almost no discernible pop. I shared with a girlfriend who has a lessor appreciation of beer than me so I may not have taken good enough notes but did notice this beer was very murky dark brown and poured with almost no head. For such a small amount of there was a touch of lacing. The smell was sort of similar to a dubbel with some tone of sugar and fruit and a certain background of alcohol. The barley wine made no effort to hide the high ABV and the lack of carbonation was apparent. The taste was surprisingly mild despite the alcohol and the fruit and sweet tones came out. There is certainly a time and paring for this beer and I look forward to trying it again pared well with dinner."
"This beer is great in all the wrong places for BA rating. It pours a murky brown with almost no carbonation and no head. It's really kind of ugly if you ask me. But, the aroma is good, but would be better if it were a little more carbonated. It tastes good, like a barleywine should. It's malty, slightly fruity, roasty and sweet, but not overly so. It has a very nice mouthfeel, not too thick and very drinkable for the dangerous 12% as the bottle states. I'll be happy to try this one again, but I'm in no rush to do so. I have another one in the closet. I think I'll sit on it a while and see how it is in a few months."
"Can't say much about the drinkability. It's definitely a sipper. My first barleywine, so not sure entirely what to contrast it with. Overall it had full rich flavours and enough complexity but it seemed a little bit all over the place with these. I did enjoy this as a sipper."
"Overall Impression - Very good beer. Surprisingly drinkable for a 12% ABV Barleywine."
"Overall - An excellent take on a barleywine. Recommended..."
"MF&D - the body is fine for all I can tell, bu the pervasiveness of the alcohol might make me think twice about having more than one of these guys."
"Blipped ""Things get Bad to Worse"" by The Ethiopians"
"D: A good and powerful beer. Very malt-forward with the hops playing a minor role. I enjoyed it but I think the alcohol was just a little too prominent in it. Definitely a sipper."
"Avoid. I did not enjoy this. Very unpleasant. I have had this twice (I bought it only once). Both times have been drain pours."
"Drinkability= A sipper, not a quaffer. Even though the alcohol is hidden, you feel it as the beer goes down. Good B-wine, a little creamy and sweet for me."
"D: Initially it came off boozy after the first sip, after a few more you just wont be able to put this one down while you marvel at the eloquent flavor and texture it has to offer. Excellent example per style, a beautifully downer in spite of its 12.0%abv, which would make your wish you could drink more then you really should."
"Since this bottle came from the other side of the pond, it has no English. When sampling this beer it doesn't present the 12% ABV in the mouth. The alcohol hit me in the belly like a fine Scotch or Bourbon. The color of the body is a touch darker than some other Barleywines but had the usual minimal head. Smells sweet, with notes of port, hops and orange. It has a beautiful taste balance of bitter hops and a sense of old ale. Highly sweet but not sticky or syrupy with a buttery character. Upon first trying it the alcohol is very present but fades to smooth caramel. This sucker is too hot, I mean it's on FIRE!! I should have sat on this one for 2 to 4 years. It reminds me of DFH 120 min. Too hot to drink fresh."
"Big Worse is big in some respects and not so big in others. It isn't the best barleywine that I've ever had, but it's far from the worst. Bottom line: this is an enjoyable Danish-Belgian sipper that is probably optimal at whatever date is printed on the cork."
"D- A sipper for sure. Harsh and could probably use some age. Most definitely not worth the money these are going for though."
"Pours a copper color into a pint glass. Small head, but good lacing. The first thing I notice about the smell is that it's a bit boozy, but it's not that strong. There is also some caramel and pear (?) as well. The candy sugar is strong in the taste, but there is an alcohol taste that begins to dominate as the beer warms. Initially I thought I could get used to it, but about halfway through I still wasn't enjoying this beer. The mouthfeel is good, but the taste just make this not that drinkable of a beer. It's not worth the price in my book."
"Bottle with some age on it. Pours a classic barleywine brown into a stone old guardian mug. No head. Smell is toasty toffee and a hint of old hops. Taste is very sweet toffee and caramel. It's buttery smooth yet clean. Very complex. This fades to an old, faded hoppiness. The alcohol has blended extremely well. I would really like to try a young bottle to compare it to. Very good beer, extremely drinkable"
"Overall: Mikkeller always seems to satisfy. Now I can't say that I've had a ton of Barleywines, but I can tell you of those I've had this is easily the best. In fact, it's one of the better beers I've had this month. I will most definitely be purchasing a couple more of these to hang on to for a while. Last, I'm really happy with the portion size of the beer. I get tired of drinking bombers by myself and feeling warn out at the end. At just a touch of 12 ounces, this is the perfect amount of beer for one setting."
"D - Quite a tasty beer but nothing I'd rush to buy again."
"Wow, what a flavorful, dynamic, intense, and rounded Barleywine! Although this one is excellent right now, laying this one down for another two years would most likely make it world class. This one surely has opened my eyes to Mikkeller."
"(Although it's classified as an 'american style barleywine', it's not so out-of-balance with the hops. Like most 'american' BW's are, these days.)"
"D: Really, the best thing about this beer is how well it hides the alcohol. I'm not saying that it's a session beer by any means, it's definitely a dessert beer. Meant to be savored."
"Drinkability- Sometimes I wish BA could rate in tenths of a point rather than 1/2's. Might not have rated it quite as high if that was the case. The one thing I would have liked was a longer lasting aftertaste of the caramel sweetness. As is, still a very good, even headed towards great barleywine. Think the $12 I paid was a bit too high though."
"Edit: After drinking some more I am finding the beer a bit too cloying..some more carbonation would be nice."
"Overall, decent but nothing special. Borders on being a boozy mess, but doesn't quite sink that far. So far, not seeing what the Mikeller hype is all about, especially at the prices they charge."
"Aged nine months in the cellar."
"Worth it for the experience, probably wouldn't purchase this again though. Can't remember what I paid for this bottle, seems like it was on the high-end. As far as barley wines go, probably not my favorite. I'd rather pickup a 6 of Bigfoot instead."
"D - A little rich; not chugging it. Greater bitterness and a drier finish could improve drinkability, bro."
"Definitely not a bad one, haven't had many danish barley wines, Norway and Sweden have some better ones I think. I'm more curious as to the storage of this beer. Unfortunately there's no indicator of when this was made, no batch #, no date. Still a good beer to warm you up."
"Bottle. Pours a nice orange-amber. Aroma is full, estery, of fruit steeped in mild brandy, and just a hint of woodiness. Definitely got my mouth watering. Just a hint of syrup on the palate makes for a full body. Flavor is of overripe pears, apples and plums, intoxicatingly sweet but not cloying by any means. High ABV warms the belly. Finish takes forever. I held my glass for a full two minutes before taking another sip, which worked out well because with a little warmth, this beer is outstanding. Finish was woody with licorice notes and a pervading undertone of plums and dates. Wonderful brew."
"6/3/7/3/13 (3.2/5)"
"Pours murky brown with a short off-white head. Alcoholic candy in the nose. Some wood, pine needles, and lots of brown sugar. Taste is liquor-esque. Sweet and tangy up front with resin and grapefruit/orange-slice candy flavors. Oaky-brandy notes follow with a bit of carmelized apples and figs. The alcohol burn takes hold, giving it a cognac finish. Awesome beer."
"One of the more easy drinking, accessible examples of a barleywine that I've sampled recently."
"A barleywine from Denmark, that was enough to make me curious about this one, I have enjoyed most Mikkeller brews I have had in the past and this was no exception, glad I got to try it and the Shelton Brothers were able to import this into the states, would not spend the money again but still worth checking out"
"D - I like this one. Would have more than one if not careful."
"375ml bottle, corked and caged. Bottle conditioned. Served in a snifter. Poured a hazy copper with a thin off white head. Plenty of piney hops in the aroma along with some alcohol and burnt sugar. Slight oxidation, but in a good way. This is a big beer, lots of malt. Not as bitter as the aroma would suggest. Fruit flavors. I also got a slightly smokey note in the finish. Warming. A nicely balanced barleywine."
"D - Wasn't impressed with this barley wine, there were others that I liked better"
"D: I can't really say I'd drink this stuff all night. Half way through this I'm starting to feel a little alcohol coming on. This is a great tasting complex beer that really fits the style well. Maybe on a cold winter night this would go down a little better, but this is really something. Very, very interesting."
"D - I love Barleywines, the bigger the better... That being said, this lacked many qualities I like in the style. The malt was to dominated by fruits, and everything was blown away by the alcohol, which to me felt much higher than 12%. Can't say this is an brew I would reach for again."
"Pours a very clear ruby in color with just a modest head that disipates before the first drink. Smell is plenty of hops, both citrusy and bittering. Taste is the same. Lots of hops and a little malt to try and help the cause. A decent brew, but not a stand out."
"D-Maybe should have cellared longer or tried it sooner, no way to know now."
"this beer rocks. its 12 percent, so its strong, ie barley beer. unlike most beers this strong, this beer is not rough and has a smooth taste. no afterburn. if you can find this beer its worth the expensive price. you wont be disappointed. stranglely the taste is almost soft and thats wild for a 12 percent-er."
"D: This is a good barleywine. It doesn't have a great complexity, but the flavours are good, making it a nice brew to sip. Not really hoppy at all, I'd say it's much more of an English barleywine than an American style."
"D- Easy to drink, but goes best as a sipping beer."
"Cool looking 12.7 ounce corked bottle. Pours a brown/amber color with a very nice initial tan head that settles to a foamy ring. Aroma is caramel, molasses, dark fruits and alcohol. The flavor is sweet raisins and figs, some caramel and molasses with quite a bit of hop bitterness, especially towards the finish. The beer is a little hot, I'm not going to say the alcohol is hidden, but at 12% that's kind of expected and I like the fact that there is never a dull moment here. Definitely a sipper but I like it."
"Pours a deep amber brown with a very small off white head. Aroma is very sweet with cherries, dates, toffee, nuts and alcohol. Flavor is somewhat fruity although the malt does shine through a bit more. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. Finishes long and sweet with a substantial alcohol burn."
"It's not as mellow aas I'd like it to be but it hints at the ability to get there."
"Nevertheless, this was a fun beer to try. One thing I'll say about Mikkeller, you can count on them to always makes something interesting and fun to drink."
"Bottle is 7 months old. Pours a deep brown/ruby with a nice off white head that fades quickly. Nose is solid malts and hops. That spicy barleywine nose. Taste follows, very malty with a large hop presence as well. Some nice fruity flavors in here and good spiciness. Alcohol is very present. Mouthfeel is good, viscous and amply carbonated, which always blows my mind after I pop open these mikkeller neo-corks. There is never a solid POP out of them, its always like an underwater pigeon fart. Anyway, drinkability is hampered a bit here as the alcohol is still quite hot in this one. With some age I can see this being an outstanding american style barleywine. I really have enjoyed mikkeller beers, and am glad to see them continuing in the right direction. Good beer."
"Drinkability - a delicious nightcap and kudos to anyone with enough foresight to have picked up some of these to cellar, they should be delicious in years to come."
"Poured a deep, deep brown with a small head that fades. Nose was dried fruits and lots of it. The alcohol was very subtle for 12%. Taste was like a deep, well balanced and very mature English Bwine. Lots of dried fruits, English malts, maybe some toffee and even liquorice in there. Mouthfeel was very good. That sweet dried fruit taste was nice. Since the ABV was not so brutal it kept drinkability high as well. Darn tasty!"
"wow, what a truly beautiful full delicious brew, why oh why! ..so good i want to cry.. ""I wish it were winter so I could freeze it into ice blocks and skate on it and melt it in the spring time and drink it! "" ...abv works perfectly ...amazing stuff ...""good blow this is"" ..only my second ever perfect 5!"
"Poured into a tulip a amberish color, some carbonation, little fizzy off-white head, minimal sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, some figs/raisins/prunes, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, some dark fruits, and some nice caramel notes. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden fairly well. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty BWSA, recommended."
"Poured from a 12.7 oz bottle, corked and caged, the beer is a very hazy amber with a slight head that quickly settles to a thin film over the top. On the nose at first is a huge malt prescence with hints of caramel and candied fruit. A slight, citrusy hop aroma lingers in the backround. The taste is almost reversed from the aromas. It starts with a slightly dry hop prescence, and is then followed with loads of maltiness. Flavors of caramel, fruit, and prune dominate the palate, and goes back to a pleasant dry finish. It's almost as if this is a cross between American and English barleywines. Very full bodied and thick, it's definitely a sipper. I'm enjoying it even though it's 80 degrees here. Big Worse is very drinkable and a unique experience."
"Dark orange, autumn color with a small, wispy head that disappears fairly quick. Nicely balanced nose, with hints of grapefruit-like hops, fruitcake, dough and honey covered fruits. Very characterful in flavor, with a nice honey-like sweetness, some fruits and caramel and toffee flavors. Body could have more texture and body. Still young, but its made some strides in the last six months. It seems to get more flavorful each time I have it. I really think it'll be great in a couple years."
"This is quite a strong drink but a little weak in the mouthfeel department. It seems that the flavor leaves way to quickly even though that fact makes you want to take another drink. Beware of the 12% though."
"Synthetic cork which I inadvertently wiped off the bottling date. Pours a medium dark amber color, slight haze with a half inch of tan head that quickly dissipates to a covering with some nice tracing. Aroma is such a sticky caramel, toasty malt bomb for sure. Just so deep and biscuity with a bent towards raisin, but not quite so fruity. Esters are rather restrained for a 12% brew. Slight chocolate touch in the aroma too. On the palate, the malts are just overpowering. I don't know what malt they use in their beer but it's just unbelievable, certainly something I've never tried. This is perhaps the richest beer I've ever had if I had to call a beer rich. Minimally carbonated with a smooth mouthfeel and a slight hop twang in the finish really rounds this beer well, in addition to a 12%abv that is well hidden. Regardless of the other reviews, I think this is one of the most solid commercial barley wines out there today."
"Corked and caged 12.7oz bottle poured into a pint glass. The bottle is wrapped in a silver wrapping and is corked with a synthetic cork. 14/08/11 printed on the cork, I am assuming that is the best before date. Pours a murky brownish amber color with alight tan head. The aroma is very malty with some caramel, leather and alcohol soaked fruits. The taste much like the aroma focuses on the malt. There is also a big leather like presence, it is almost like chewing on a leather boot. Finally, the hops make their presence felt in the finish. Overall, Mikkeller Big Worse is a pretty solid barleywine that seems like it would age very nicely. This is a sipper for sure, but the bottle isn't as big as it appears."
"This beer was served in a tulip glass. It was a ruby red color with a small tan head that quickly disappeared. The beer was actually pretty still. It had a dark fruit aroma, as well as a little caramel. Interesting aroma. The taste was fruity, prunes/raisins. A little warming spice from the alcohol. Maybe a touch too sharp for me, but still a nice beer."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin with a low level of carbonation and brown sugar lingering. There is also a small level of heat coming from the abv in this one. This one should age a bit more before trying."
"props to the brewer for this one"
"Tastes of sweet malts, hops, alcohol and fruits. I was very surprised when my girlfriend brought this back from Premier Gourmet for me."
"Definitely an American style barleywine with assertive hop bitterness. A bit hot at this stage with an alcohol burn that is a bit distracting."
"Honestly, I am not a barleywine person, yet. I do know that this was a great example of one."
"All around a very tasty BW. Pours an active, full head over a ruddy chestnut sipper. The aroma gives off lots of caramel malt and earthy hops, alcohol (a very little rubbing but mostly whisky type), and a handful of green apples. This one tastes a little young and would hold up to some aging. The flavor starts sweet in the front like toffee and quickly shows its hop prowess. Waves of resiny hops combine with alcohol throughout to the finish. This aggressive bounty is held up stalwartly by malt minions. The mouthfeel is a little too effervescent at first but it mellows as the tasting went on. Damn good BW; could use some aging but even for $10/bottle it's worth the admission price."
"d: There isn't anything subtle here. This is big, full-flavored, and pretty damned good. At $10 for 375ml however, this will be my only bottle."
"D: Although there is an alcohol punch, there is something compelling about this beer. This would make a great all-night sipper."
"A nice beer to get drunk on...or go to sleep with. Right now (relatively new) it's a bit hot and a lot sweet."
"Big Worse: Worse than most barleywines that cost a lot less. I don't think this is bad but it's not worth the $8.99 I paid for it."
"D - The sweet caramel & citrus flavors give it a candy like taste that is not very appealing."
"this beer poured a cloudy brown with now and and a few bubbles. nothing special to look at for sure. the smell is butterscotch, caramel, a bit doughy and faint hops. the alcohol is very present in the nose. the taste is sweet on the front end, tasting like burn pitted fruits. it's also a bit on the sour side. i also detect apricot perhaps. i am really digging this english style barley wine as i seem to enjoy the sweetness versus the hop onslaught you get from the american barleywines. overall, this is a great beer and an all night sipper. i think i could drink a couple over a night, but a third would probably plant me in the ground. i plan on putting a couple of these back for down the road. another fine offering from mikkeller."
"The body is big with a under carbonation feel. Overall, needs age...no kidding at 12%. Maybe the fusels will go away with time. But still has potential for now."
"Sidenote: The cork smells a lot like pine."
"I really wanted to taste something like Bigfoot or Old Foghorn or Thomas Hardy's...I got something like that, but mixed with a saison or a tripel...weird...not bad, just ...weird."
"I wasnt too hot on this one. I would call this more of an English BW and it fits that style well. However, for an american version, it seems to be too sweet. ABV is very warming. Very sweet overall. Not my cup of tea, but not bad overall I suppose. I have on of these cellared so I really hope it improves and mellows out a bit of the sweetness."
"Bottle courtesy of Fonefan: Poured a deep lightly hazy copper color ale with a nice foamy head with medium retention and no lacing. Aroma of citrusy hops is dominating with some light pear and some alcohol. Taste is a mix between some grapefruit hops, light caramel malt with phenols of alcohol. Medium body with average carbonation and some apparent alcohol which I didn't appreciate. Interesting take on the American barleywine style with a nice hops combination but I could do without all that alcohol."
"Appears a deep murky blood orange red brown in color with a large beige head dwindles down to fine even lacing. Aroma is tart with ripened fruit soaked in raw fusel alcohol. Abundant hop notes intertwined in the luscious malt character brings the aromatics around full character. Flavor is unsynchronized with raw hop bitterness, astringent alcohol, and overly sweet candy sugar additions might as well package this one in forties and sell in the 7/11 down the street. This is extreme beer at it's worse, might as well call this one the skullsplitter. After a half glass my eyes are blurring and my temples are buzzing, I feel like I just got done reinsulating my attic as my skin becomes warm and flush and my nose burns from the alcohol fumes. As you can see I'm not going to add to the hype of this brewery, I will give their other brews a shot. Mouthfeel is astringent in every aspect coats the palate with earthy hop oils, hot alcohol, and overtly sweet sugars in the malt profile causing me to want to go scrape my tongue. Literally causes my gag reflex to work, so let's motion to kick this one out of the UN of beers. Drinkability is shite the worst beer I've had in a long time, by the way nice synthetic cork maybe those brewers can use this one as a substitute butt plug, because this beer tastes like ass."
"An absolutely outstanding barleywine. I am definitely pumped about this brew. Highly recommend."
"Pours a translucent dark red amber color with a wispy tan lead that's gone in a flash. Little lacing present. The smell is very nice. It's been way too long since my last barleywine. The aroma has that classic caramel malt and a little molasses. You can smell how rich the body is going to be, then you get a whiff of a malt alcohol. Little carbonation, the mouth feel is full without being syrupy and very smooth with a solid tang from the alcohol. No doubt this one's a sipper. The 12% ABV provides a distinct warming effect. The flavor has a lot in common with the nose, but it doesn't line up exactly for me. What ever it is also lingers some and I just can't put my finger on it. The best that I can do is say that the alcohol burn might be stepping on the sweeter side of the malt. Thanks drunkmonk for the opportunity!!"
"D: This one warms you right up and is definitely a sipper. I loved how the sweetness from the caramel malt helped keep the alcohol from going out of control. This is an excellent beer!"
"The too-tart, too-dominant finish alerts that this should be cellared and allowed to chill out a bit. Cork gives a best-by/expiration of 2011, so this is probably still quite young. Still, a treat at any point in its life, I was glad to have tried it and lucky that Brian could spare a bottle. Cheers pal!"
"It's going to be tough for me to rate this beer but one thing I know for sure, in its curent state, it's certainly not all that drinkable for me but I *am* glad I got to try it."
"Overall a good beer with no big flaws. I think it would be better with age - the alcohol would calm down some and the bitterness in the finish would fade as well, leaving the sweetness a little more pronounced."
"I'd give it a higher rating but I'm not thrilled with the slight apricot flavor (probably just they hops they're using - but, hey, whatever). Still, this stuff rocks! Not rocks $10 per 12oz, like I paid, but rocks! If you pay $5 a bottle you're getting a good deal on a good beer."
"This Barleywine is a very well balanced beer. Most barleywines I tend to drink can be a lot of tangy sweetness and not much else. The are big rich roasted barley flavors up front. Followed by the traditional sweetness, and finish with a sour touch on the end. The big roasted flavors help to balance the big barley wine finish. A great beer, I will be buying it while I still see it around"
"Pours into the snifter a nearly-still deep red and brown. No head or lace, with a few slow and small bubbles of carbonation. In the nose, the beer exhibits rich carmel and vanilla notes. with hints of oaky sourness and honey blossom. The flavor is somewhat drier. Begins with toasted caramel and wood notes and develops an herbal hop center and deep warming alcohol finish. The body retains a bit of carbonation; can be deceivingly light initially but becomes syrupy as the beer warms."
"Drinks just average, too damn hot alcohol-wise. sit on this at least 2 years or you just have a crude OTT American Barley wine"
"Overall: I have not been overly impressed with the Mikeller brews. Don't get me wrong they are not bad, but for the price you just don't get the bang for your buck. Still waiting to try Beer Geek though as it's my favorite sytle and many rave about it. I can't wait to be the judge."
"The hot alcohol really detracts here, it adds a harsh astringency to this brew. This is a huge beer and should last for many years. I wish it was more drinkable right now as a young, super-hoppy Barley Wine though. If you wait a long time between each sip, this can be quite enjoyable, but back to back sips seem to magnify the effects of the hot alcohol on the flavor. In the end this show lots of potential, but is just too young right now."
"A sipper for sure , but a well done barley wine."
"The appearance of this beer seem to be run of the mill. It had a decent amount of head but not a whole lot. The nose is where it started to pick up. It had a fruit and floral smell to it with a bit of sweet malts. The color was a dark orange like the color of honey. After a few swigs I start to get a candy apple flavor. Still has a strong floral note and the hops are not so strong they destroy your mouth. The finish goes on for ever. I can taste this beer long after. The acid and malt balance out perfect and even gets better as it warms up. The alcohol is masked. I would have never guessed it 12%. More like a 8%. One of the better high alcohol beers Ive had. It would be easy to slide a few back in a short amount of time, and then fall down the stairs drunk."
"Clear, garnet colored body, and a small amount of carbonation brought out the wine aspects of the presentation quite nicely, as did the corked and caged green bottle. The aroma was very fruity, as I could smell plums, cherries, and pear. The taste was complex yet delicate, which is quite a feat for a 12% ABV beer. The fruits that I smelled were soaked in syrup apparently, as the hefty amount of malt made its presence known. The hops were in quite force here as well, because the finish was herbal and bitter. There was a woody dry flavor present in the background, and occasionally a little sourness was apparent as well. At first I was going to rate this a little lower in the taste category, as my first impression was that this was a little bland, but each sip revealed additional layers of complexity, and I was soon won over. A little thinner in the mouth than I typically like barleywines. More American than English in style if you ask me, and reminded me somewhat of Anchor Old Foghorn."
"It's a little pricy, but worthwhile for sure."
"drinkable?: a bit, but not worth the fight to keep it down"
"Pours amber with a decent head that fades to a ring. Big malty aromas overlaid by spice. Sweet and creamy in the nose, but smells relatively dry for a barley wine. Taste is similar- big and spicy with cardomom and anise. Notes of orange and spice cookies round it out. Once again, quite dry for a barleywine. Mouthfeel is slightly tannic, and big and sweet. Pretty drinkable if a little off style- tastes a little more in the old ale or strong ale direction. Alcohol is well hidden."
"Pours dark copper, clear, with a small effervescent cream head. Aroma is coconut, sweet caramel, raisins, and boozy. There is a hint of leather as well when agitated. Taste shows a nice sugary caramel, raisins, sweet grapes and something that hints at tartness but is overpowered by the malts. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, somewhat thick on the tongue up front, quickly cut by the effervescent carbonation, peppery hoppiness, and biting alcohol that all lead into a drying finish with a malty and caramel sweet aftertaste. A good barleywine that got better farther into it, i think a little age could either do good things or could bring the already boozy alcohol more to the forefront, look forward to seeing what develops."
"Pretty, deep tawny amber, ruby, almost a port color. You can see some bubbling though. Very nice. Looks great in a snifter. The aroma gives off lots of dark fruits with some sweet winey notes as well. The taste is a warm fruity lat. Juicey with figs and prunes with a hint of grapes and currants. The body is heavy and juicey. Great for sipping and swishing around your mouth."
"Poured from a 12.7 fl oz bottle syn. corked and caged. Poured a ruby reddish brown with a thick off white head. Smell is very similar to double bastard, sweet carmel and raisin mixed with pineapple and citrus. Taste is sweet candied fruits, brown sugar, grapefruit rind, and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium to full body with a sweet start which keeps it thick and rather dry finish which rounds out the thickness. The 12% alcohol level makes this a sipper but a damn good sipper."
"Pours a dark murky brown. Nose is minor raisins. Mild alcohol. Almost smells like dirty river water. Flavor is spiked by the alcohol. Robust flavor, but this obviously needs to be laid down for many more years before its in its prime. Feel is good. But like I said, definitely needs some time to mature."
"My second stab at a Mikkeller brew I really enjoyed the Stateside IPA,poured into a small tulip glass sort of a slight hazed deep russet color a well formed 2 finger clingy light beige colored head atop it had great lasting power.At first pop of the cork a powerful resiny hop aroma hit me and a smile crossed my face that mixed in with a brown sugar and cakey alcohol fruitiness I knew this was gonna be a doozy.Hmm after a few sips I notice that its not anywhere near as potent as I thought it would be or as bold flavor wise a little watery in the mouthfeel department definently not a big chewey barley wine.Flavors fall a bit flat compared to the aromas dark fruit sweetness mixed with brown sugar and alcohol the hops are much more subdued than what I had imagined and or hoped giving a hint of medicinal-like and white pepper flavors in the finish along with a lasting alcohol sweetness.Maybe as others have suggested cellaring might be the ticket here but it wont help out its lighter mouthfeel,it started out great and kinda peetered out in the finish."
"D- This beer has some nice sweetness but nothing to balance or support it. The orange quality at the finish is mysterious but not bold enough to and much interest."
"Pretty drinkable too. Not the most complex, but a solid beer, no doubt. Has some rough edges from the hops and alcohol, but it is an American style barleywine, so it is expected. The size of this beer is well hidden, no alcohol hotness at all."
"This beer needs much more time in the bottle. Alocohol burns big in the mouth, throat and chest. A bit discombobulated with a lacking of balance. Not to say it isn't good but I can only see this getting better, if not it's too bad. Datey raisiny characteristics with only a hint of brown sugar. The bitterness of the hops and alcohol hurt this for me. Mouth is prickly and lively another characteristic I'm not crazy about in a barley wine. Again I really do think this will be a very good beer with at least a year or more in the bottle."
"Overall, a big bitter barley wine. It's not very balanced at all and too alcoholic for me."
"Drinkability - Great barleywine. At 12% abv., it's obviously not for your average Monday morning session with the boys. A remarkably well put together brew, it was certainly no chore getting through this wee little 355mL bottle. This would easily go head to head with your Old Guardians, or Old Ruffians, or Old Horizontals, or any other Old American Barleywine."
