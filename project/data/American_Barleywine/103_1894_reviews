"A phenomenal flavor, completely unexpected after the noise. Great Mouthfeel, and a rich dark amber color."

"Overall, not a bad beer. I have not tried many Barleywine ales and certainly none with any significant age. I'm going to pick up a few more bottles of this for the cellar and see how they do over time. I'll be looking for the hop bitterness to fade and the malts to shine. I'll let you know in a year how things turn out."

"Overall – 2011 and drinking well.  A bit of an odd flavour in the aftertaste.  Maybe a touch too sweet, but indulgent."

"o: A wonderful fluid!  If this was not 9.5% ABV I could drink it all night.  Dunno if the aging helped it, it is more malty than most barleywines I have had, but I sure enjoyed it, one of the best I've had in some time!"

"a nice barleywine here, different than the conventional English versions. this is a blonde beer, which threw me off on the pour, a bit cloudy and boasting a tall and lasting inch of white head. the nose on it is surprisingly hoppy too, especially in the context of other middle ages beers, which tend not to be the most aggressively hopped ales around. wheat malt, warming booze, candy sugar, and a pleasantly complex and bright strain of ale yeast. it opens up a lot as it warms, and the sweetness is only for a second before hop bitterness takes over. the interplay between yeast and hops here is extraordinary. the alcohol flavors come across a little strong though, and slow this beers drinkability, even for a barleywine. a bomber of this is a few ounces too much really, at least for me. still the happy carbonation and lighter body for the style make it a really unique brew. good stuff here from middle ages."

"O-A decent Barleywine. One of the better beers made by Middle Ages."

"Overall, seems an entry-level barleywine as I imagined it was. But except for the odd butteryness, it's appropriate for the style and well done, just not mind-blowing."
"This beer is good but in my opinion needs some work. The malt character is there but the hops are a bit strange or unbalanced. The citrus notes do not sit as well as they should with the malt character. As a fan of Barleywines I will still recommend this as a beer that's worth a try, but I would view it more as a DIPA or strong ale than as a Barleywine."

"22oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours a caramel hue with a semi-hazy clarity and a half inch, loose, cream-colored head that eventually disperses into a creamy slick. Some lacing, but no adhesion. Nose expresses prunes, a slightly vinous character, toasted malt and a trace of wet cardboard. Taste consistent with nose; however, a bit more subdued. There's also a light earthy hoppiness and some ethanol; however, things are a bit muddled by the carbonation levels - it definitely needs a swirl to open it up. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an overly assertive carbonation level and a slightly oily texture. Overall, a fairly mediocre example of the style. Not something I need to revisit again anytime soon."
"O- The high ABV is hidden very well on this one. It is very smooth and easy to drink the first half. But the second was much harder because of the bitterness. It was actually hard to finish. Not a beer I would visit again in it's current state of maturity. Perhaps a year or two in the cellar to bypass the adolescent wildness that this brew has created, will do some good for it. I do enjoy a good IPA, double IPA, etc. but I don't want my barley-wine to be this bitter. I think some extra belgian candy sugar or something would have helped to balance this out. Or, maybe this is just too young for my preference. Maybe I will pick up another bottle to put away for some time..."

"O: Not bad, a decent beer overall. I can't say this strikes me as a particularly aggressive barleywine -- it's more of a Belgian IPA than a barleywine. During the course of a 22-ouncer, I got accustomed to the taste. If you're looking for an easy-drinking brew that packs a decent punch and doesn't particularly tax the palate, this is a good choice, although a bit pricey. A solid B+/A- overall."
""
"O: Pretty typical decent hoppy barleywine. Heavy and strong. Heavy raisin and grape, quite fruity."
"Overall I love me a nice hoppy barleywine and this one is tasty. Almost like a clone of Backburner from Southern Tier which I also enjoyed thoroughly. Great beer."
""
""
"OVERALL: A quality barleywine with a solid malt base and enough hops to give it enough charecter. Well balanced and enjoyable. The nose needs a little more pep to move this one up a class, but the feel is good and the flavor is there and in all the right places. Worth checking out if you see it, and one I'll probably be on the lookout for when on holiday in the States. Thanks again for this one Irishgurl4."

"This was a smooth, unaggressive barley wine, Very nicely done."
""
""
"Fuller medium body, nicely carbonated, sticky and chewy on the tongue with a bit of creaminess. This is a nice hoppy barleywine - I'd drink it again."
""
""
"Overall- I really have to say that this is one the easiest-drinking full-bodied beers I've had to date, and the rather high ABV coupled with the complex character and drinkability makes this one a dangerous indulgence. Hats off to Middle Ages once again."

"O/D - Overly sweet with not enough dark fruit character. Well hopped but could use less booze. OK."
""

"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a pretty decent and drinkable beer of the style, but the malty, barleywine characteristics just didn't really stand out to me. It was good, but just not a beer that really stood out in the style for me."

"Mouthfeel is a bit dryer then most barleywines."
"Pours a murky dark brown with a 1 inch fizzy beige head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Thin broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, brown sugar, alcohol, and some citrus zest. Taste is of biscuit-like malt, alcohol, and some pine and citrus zest hops. Mild hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a slightly fizzy carbonation level with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good hop-forward barleywine from Middle Ages. Lots of pine and citrus zest nicely balanced with the malt."
"Drink- Pretty tasty. A more malt forward with a little over bitter. More smooth and big than some BW's lately. A nice balance between the flavors."
"An overall delicious beer that I somehow want to find flaw in the buttery/butterscotch flavor. But without that, this beer would be quite banal."
"O - It's not too bad. Not as good as I remember it being when my buddy let me have a sip of it. Certainly filling, and not a bad taste. But I can't see myself paying this much for what I get. Thankfully, this round was a gift."
"Overall, while the first sip of this beer was excellent, subsequent sips lost the initial potency and deliciousness of the sugars, resulting in an imbalanced beverage. Middle Ages (the brewer) does note that, when young, the beer is quite hoppy, and the malts become more pronounced as the beer ages. Perhaps this one is a good cellaring beer, then."
"O: Simply delicious. The craft beer i cut my teeth on and one that I will go back for over and over again. The 9.5% alcohol adds to the fun but it's the complexity of the flavor profile that makes this beer one of my favorites."
"If there was a barleywine that was a summer beer, this would be it. Smooth and citrusy, not overly complex. If it wasn't for the high ABV, I could drink these all day."
"I can finally expunge this one from my “wants” list after it had been on there for years. Thanks John. This 2009 vintage pours clear copper with tan head. The aroma is modest in strength with malts, some floral hops, pine and some tree sap. The taste is pretty smooth with pine hop resin, some spicy hops and a bit of floral hops too. Toward midway spicy hops, earthiness and a touch of roast come forward to create a near black tea like sensation. I enjoy the way this one comes together. I could sit and sip on this all night."
" Cheers to my first ""real"" beer that has been in need of a review for several years now!"
"Overall: The bitter finish is way too overpowering. I would like a little bit more balance from this beer. I don't think I'm going to try to find it again."
"The reveal - Middle Ages Druid Fluid Barleywine. Going with the trend I've noticed from this brewery, its a bit underwhelming for the style. I'm enjoying the beer, and its well constructed but I'd consider it more an IPA or RyePA even."
"The mouthfeel on this is lush, smooth, and very creamy. Among the best I've found; it almost feels good to drink. Just shy of 10% ABV, this beer is still very drinkable."
"D/N- Wow. This is an excellent American Barley Wine. Simple yet very flavorful. Balanced just right. I will seek more of this. ISO Druid Fluid..."
"So not attempt to gargle, apparently it foams"
"Got awkward when Carl tried to gargle it.... It's hard to gargle foam he says."
"D - This is an okay barleywine. It definitely leans toward the sweeter side of the spectrum. Thanks to given2flybrewing for sharing."
"Drinkability is OK, some warming and tingly booze take away a bit, and it is on the sweet side but very tolerable on that end. A very slight stickiness on the finish but that is very good compared to most barleywines."
"Pours murky orange, thin orangeish head which quickly fades.  Smells are plum, other dark fruits, alcohol and some brown sugar.   Tastes pretty much like it smells, plums, some hops, very sweet.   Mouthfeel is sticky, low carb, kinda chewy.  Good stuff, really glad I got to try it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a orangey/lite caramel brown. Had a thin dirty white head that clung slightly with small streams of carbonation rising from the bottom. Aroma was overly sweet, slightly hoppy, and slighty fruity. Taste was hoppy up front, slight bitterness, with some sweetness to finish. Mellowed out over time, became balanced as the beer warmed up. Felt ok in the mouth. Coated nicely, and well carbonated. Alcohol was slightly hidden which was nice, and it was pleasant to drink."
"D - I'm not at all impressed with this beer. Being this is the first time I've had it, I'm hoping it's a skunky bottle. If not, this isn't something I'd expect from Middle Ages."
"O: For the price, there are other beers I'd rather buy. It's not the best barleywine I've ever had, and as I'm not a hophead, I don't think I'd care to buy this one again. Nor recommend for the style."
"Smells of candy and sugar. very sweet.. less hoppy aroma yet a stronger alcohol scent. tastes of dried apricots and burnt caramel...very buttery. this brew is rather dry to the pallet.. clean finish but not much residue on the ol' taste buds. Good beer.. ot great but worth a try."
"Mostly clear orange-brown brew becomes orange-red against a light. 1"" of frothy head settles slowly to a thick beige layer and leaves chunky lacing. Continues to generate abundant lace until the end. Nose is dominated by a great dose of pine and candied orange rind hops, then honey, biscuit, some florals. Smell is thick and sweet, like pez candy and honey. Taste is a great mix of candy sweetness, mixed citrus notes fronted by orange rind, biscuit, some boozy notes, pine, florals, hints of caramel. Bitter sweet, very tasty. Makes me think of lemoncello liquor. Tropical fruits, mango and coconut, come out as it breathes. Finish is fairly long and resiny. Still tasting pine several minutes later. Mouthfeel is viscous, carbonation on the high end but it is soft and not overbearing. Alcohol mildly apparent but blends well with everything else so it is not offensive. Overall an awesome brew, very enjoyable."
"I didn't love it, but I'll probably pick up another bottle next time I'm in Syracuse."
"D: Very nice. Not sure if it is a new favorite for the style, but still very enjoyable. Going to get some cheese to pair, and enjoy the hell out of it!"
"D- A pretty nice American barleywine; pretty fruit-forward profile which is pretty nice."
"Notes: A bizarre barleywine... Not what I would look for typically in the style but a very enjoyable brew in its own right. For a US version it sure is hoppy but here a fruity note predominates and in a way that makes it rather drinkable."
"All in all, this brew is not that great. If you enjoy very hoppy beers, then definitely try this brew once. Any more than that is not necessary. Not for me."
"D - An enjoyable offering from Middle Ages (a very underrated brewery), but far from their best and far from a top tier Barleywine... Definately was not a struggle to finish, but I""m not sure this is one I would recommend or seek out given the great array of American and English Barleywines available..."
"Overall a good baseline Barleywine that presents a balanced example of the American style."
"Got this 22 as an extra in a trade with aerozppl. Pours a very hazy, amber-ruby color with a nice off white colored head. It sticks around for a little while but settles nicely leaving some nice lacing as it quietly recedes. Smells sweet with a heavy dose of caramel. Also some piney hops help balance it out. There is some sort of ""staleness"" lurking back there. Can't really tell what it is but its there. I think it might be a touch to cold. The first couple of sips reveal some nice malty sweetness, and a good dose of piney bitter hops. I think its a nice balance between the two. I'm getting quite a bit of diactyl, almost sort of buttery. It's slightly off putting. Also a nice touch of alcohol. I think the carbonation level is spot on and it has a slightly creamy feel. This would have been a very good beer if not for those slightly off flavors. Maybe one day I can give it another shot."
"Had to post some Spinal Tap for this one"
"3.5/3.5/3/3.5/3.5"
"Sure, it's very drinkable, but for me personally, I don't see the point. Maybe my expectations where just too high, but I'm letdown by this one."
"Perhaps another couple years will help balance this one out more, but its still enjoyable for what it is."
"Compared to just about all the other brews that night this one stands out for the strength of the hops still remaining. Lots of citrus in the nose and taste, lemons, oranges, grapefruit rind, pine resin, grassy - all balanced by a sticky sweet caramel backing that tries hard (and probably fails a little) to keep up to the hops and the alcohol bite in the back. This almost feels like it falls into DIPA territory. For a couple of years on it, it's a nice surprise and lets me know it could take a few more fine. Delicious, though ultimately a little unbalanced. Tasty though!"
"D: It doesn't have the malt or the hops (due to aging?) to back up the alcohol in this beast."
"Ruby red body with a decent enough head. Things start to go downhill with the smell, which combines a highly artificial candy-like aroma with citrus hops. The flavor profile is similar, with the hops barely balancing out the rather gross candy flavors. Needless to say, this was a huge disappointment. Probably the worst barleywine I've ever had."
"D: High. This is a fine Barleywine with a dynamic well mixed flavor. I'd order another and buy again."
"Overall, solid above average barleywine. Could have used a lot more complexity as nothing in this beer challenged the palate. Still, not too shabby for an every day beer."
"I think this should be a little dryer to get the mouthfeel right and the juicy-hop addition, whatever it is, clashes with the pine. Could've been a nice and clean American Barleywine but it's a weird British/American mixture. Good flavor all around tho.. I think I just have creative differences. Of the 3 barleywines I bought the other day, this is my favorite."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for its high content; it goes down smooth and has a very complex flavor. I recommend at least one try of my hometown brew."
"Overall: First barleywine so nothing to compare it too but it is quite balanced between the malt, bitter and floral backbone. Would love to see how this would do with some age."
"Drinkability: I'd like to try this again in the future, especially for the $5 or $6 price tag, but based on this experience, I wouldn't rush out to get it. Still looking to try more Middle Ages beers, which should be fairly easy now based on my location."
"Pretty good barleywine. Very well balanced and drinkable."
"I'm not a huge fan of American BWines on the whole, they tend to be too hoppy for me. I like mine sweeter, like the English style. But this one might be my favorite to date. Poured reddish burgundy in appearance, a tranquil head topped off by some foamy lacing. Big hops on the scent, and I thought, this is going to be quite bitter. But to the contrary, while the hops were present, they took a backdoor to the fruity sweetness, augmenting the malt bomb. I could taste their effects, but they were super smooth, and the result was very drinkable. Almost like Mirror Mirror's little brother, from the sample of that I had before. It's not the biggest or most amazing barleywine, but was quite balanced for me, and balance while still retaining flavor is what I look for in these beers."
"D- ... Putting more than one of these down would be tough, not to mention how toasted one would be. Not very drinkable but it does go down."
"Bravo, Middle Ages!"
"Thanks alot Joe!"
"Drinkability is good, this is tasty and rich, but smooth and not overwhelming. I'm really digging it, and am glad I busted it out after an epic blue bird day skiing the glacier on Mt. Hood!"
"D- a pretty tasty beer in a highly liked category."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer with some strength that it worth drinking for a long time."
"22 oz. bomber with no freshness date. The beer has a lightly-carbonated amber body, topped with a loose, two finger head that leaves bits of lace. On the nose, my first impression is Cascade and Simcoe with some crystal malts. Later this evolves into tropical and citrus fruits and perhaps some berries; it is nice and aromatic, but consists mostly of hops and various alcohol notes. Big floral/leafy hop presence on the palate, with chewy malts, fruity esters, rosy alcohol, and lots of citric bitterness. Eventually the hops ebb and make way for lots of sweet crystal malts and a pleasant, warming sensation. The body is chewy, lightly-numbing, and gets dryer the more I drink. This is definitely a brew that will improve with age, but as is, it's not a great one. Not bad by any means, it's just the fruity alcohols and esters haven't melded completely with the big hoppiness and chewy sweetness. I'd like to try this one at two or three years of age."
"This one pours a cloudy amber orange with a thin white head. The smell on this one is very interesting. Its got dark fruits and bubblegum with a slight hop scent and a lot of alcohol. The taste is about the same as the smell. The bubblegum and fruit are the strongest and are only overshadowed by the alcohol. There is a slight hop bitterness on the finish but again masked by the alcohol. The mouthfeel is a little thin and hot. Drinkability on this one is poor because its so hot."
"D- Fairly easy to drink. I can't tell if aging would improve this, perhaps the abv would cool down some."
"Drinkability: Very well balanced between the malt, the fruit and the bitterness, with a thinner body than would be expected; this bottle has a year or two of age on it and is drinking nicely; it's not a barleywine in the classic sense however"
"Notes: It seems like the hoppier Middle Ages brews are exponentially better than their not-so-hoppy brews. I don't know if it's just me... but Wailing Wench, X, and this were great... and the rest of their lineup has been just okay."
"D- Very nice but it feels like this beer could be so much better I need to try and age some more longer then a year."
"D: Pretty damned drinkable for the style and ABV. This is a solid Barleywine fo sho. Really digging it. The smell is the show stopper here. I will have to trade for this to get a couple of bottles for the cellar. This beer is great."
"This brew pours a clear copper color with a big off-white head that dies down to a solid cover and modest lacing. It smells like a smooth piney hop and malt blend with a touch of lavender sweetness. Very pleasant. The taste is a deep barley and caramel sweetness with plenty of alcohol warmth. It has a fine tingly carbonation that forces a slow flow down the old gullet. Very tangy. It has a somewhat oily consistency yet it also has a certain lightness for a barleywine. It has a tart overtone, almost a grapfruit-cherry quality. Pretty drinkable. Very decent."
"This is my first barleywine, poured a beautiful opaque copper orange with a white 2 finger head which maintains good retention, leaves intermittent speckles of lacing on the inside of my goblet. ""It's gorgeous; it looks like cider!"" said the wife. Aroma is malty with citrus, orange, apple. Mouthfeel is a little thick, chewy, and slippery, with medium carbonation that goes well with the medium-full body. Taste is strongly of malt, with a little hop bitterness and a fruity peach and apple background. Even with the high ABV and big flavor of this beer, it has high drinkability for me. Overall this is a good brew, I may cellar a bottle to compare next year."
"Overall I thought this was very good. Very different for the style and something that I thought was well sought for. I would have no issue trying this one again, in fact I would actually try and seek it out."
"An American Bwine with more malth than hops! WOW! This thing had some serious malt to it and A nice hop balance for American Bwine. Poured an orange with a nice white head. Nose super malty and had some Munich malts in there somewhere. Some citrus to it as well. This was almost a twisted version of an English Bwine since the malt profile dominated. Taste was oh so thick and malty. Off balanced a little. Some citrus on the nose followed into the taste. Tasted perhaps some pineapple,apricot. It had a big tropical/citrus bouquet like the Maharaja IIPA just maltier and less hopped. Good brew but not sure if call this a Bwine. Maybe a unique Strong Ale."
"Medium body, ample CO2, quite drinkable."
"Pours a rich cloudy orange amber color with an orange rind and caramel smell and taste. Citrusy and a touch warming from the alcohol. Sharp, citrusy alcohol and hops with a medium body. Not bad."
"Overall I would say this is a nice barleywine, not in my list of favs. I would definitely pick up again if I had the chance."
"Soft and maybe slightly watery feeling, but still pretty drinkable for a BW."
"A honey amber body has murky wheat tones on the edges where light comes through. Head is a rocky medium tan that jumps to three fingers and has decent retention. Considerable scattered lace is left behind. Nose is shockingly hoppy for the style with fresh cut grassy notes and hints of vanilla oak with a bit of spice. Wow for a barley wine this sure is hoppy, matter of fact if I didnt know better I'd say I was drinking a Double IPA. Hops are creamy and piney with soughy spicey malt notes tagging along. A raw peppery bitterness coats the mouth and leaves fresh hoppy feel on the taste buds. This isnt a bad beer at all but for the style it misses the mark a bit. The drinkability is hurt by this."
"Thanks BeerTruth. What would I drink without you? A wonderful tasting Barleywine that is very drinkable. I really like it. If it was a local brew for me many bombers would be enjoyed during those cool fall and winter months."
"Overall a very good barleywine. Good drinkability despite the robust ABV."
"For the abv this is a very drinkable Barley Wine, more toward the English style in my opinion. Looking forward to tapping into this in cask."
"Update: On cask this beer is simply dumb. I had it next to Old Guardian on tap and the old guardian looked like a rookie."
"Definitely well-made, but a middle-of-the-road barleywine."
"Final Note: I highly recommended this brew to anyone who likes Barleywines. Great after dinner sipper to help a meal go down."
"But now... Now it's time to justify the average taste and drinkability scores I just gave this. Ah, shucks. You know, it's like a barleywine. Kind of. I was comparing it to smutty and, well, FOR MY TASTES, the hop profile was just all wrong. Weird and homebrewerish. Ah, but then I was reminded, with a Bigfoot, that there are other fish in the sea. I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to see such a wide range of beers - even when the style is similar. I still think that the hop profile seems a bit on the amateur side, here. I'm not trying to be harsh - I'm trying to say that work could be done on giving this a more even feel and taste in the mouth. The flavor (hops aside) and mouthfeel are spot on - just need to work on the hops. Ah, yes, then there are different batches from different years - varying according to the mysteries of hop differences. Well, I'd like to give a few other years of this one a go - this year isn't quite what I'm looking for."
"Tastes like a Barley Wine should (IMO). A good balance between hops, malts ,fruits and alcohol. Notes of caramel, fruits ( plums and other dark fruits), and a bit of alcohol."
"Overall: Very drinkable, very tasty, but kind of peculiar. An interesting mix between American and English styles, but overall I guess I'd think of it more as an American strong ale in style."
"I'm not sure this was what I expected. The flavor turned out to be decent after I was a bit scared due to the appearance. I would have liked some more hop balance and bitterness. Not sure if I would recommend it at this point..."
"Pours an amber color with a thick and creamy two inch tan head. This fluffy head dies down to leave some sticky lacing all along the sides of the glass. Smell is hoppy with citrus and pine notes coming through, as well as figs and raisins after several sniffs. The taste is quite bitter with some wine taste as well as raisins and pine. A very sticky mouth feeling with this beer and some warming presence from the high ABV. A good barleywine indeed."
"d: i'll definitely buy more, but this is too high octane to have often."
"This may be one of my favorite barley wines, but that might be because I enjoy the subtlety of the flavors whereas I find most BW's to be one-trick ponies of sweet malt. This isn't the brandy-like experience that one often gets from a true BW, but still I found this to be delicious."
"I had high expectations with this beer but it sorda fell flat.I shared this beer with my buddy John.I drank this from a brandy shifter.Burnt orange,just like fall colors.Nice off white head that fell to a ring pretty fast.The smell was boozy,hops and some spices.The taste was the same as the smell but with a nice malt backbone.The mouthful is smooth and sorda on the thick side.Nice carbonation.I liked this more as it warmed up but this is nothing I would seek out to find again."
"Pours a somewhat murky coppery orange with an okay initial head that settles pretty quickly to a cap. Some spotty lacing. The smell is fullof alcohol, dry malt, and heavy wood. Taste is somewhat similar. Tastes more like a dry mead with a relatively bitter hop presence on the finish and then aged in oak with some cedar chips tossed in. Honey on the finish as well. Unusual and quite tannic. Mouthfeel is puckery from the wood tannins, dry, and not all that heavy. Highly oaked beers like this have their place, but for me the amount of wood flavor hampers the drinkability. On the plus side, it is not sweet at all."
"I love Middle Ages and this is another top notch brew. Hop bitterness is very subdued for an American barleywine. Pick it up if you can."
"This is a solid American Barleywine. Really good stuff. Fairly easy to drink but its quite filling on the stomach, although I did have a sizable dinner not too long ago."
"Had only tried this at the Extreme Beer Fest in 2006. Pours a somewhat hazy orange to ruddy brown color. Decent enough head. Malty and hoppy smelling but has a very pronounced ""earthy"" aroma. Slightly musty smelling. Big malt flavor but again with the ""earthiness"". Detracts from the overall flavor for me. Big hop flavor as well. Decent body-not too syrupy but has a nice slickness to it. Rather drab for me overall. The earthy and musty flavors are not for me."
"The finish is pretty crazy, very puckery, delicious if you're a hop enthusiast, but maybe a bit too intense if you lean toward the English barleywines. But for me, it hits all the right buttons. I'd bet it ages well too."
"D - Once you get used to the hop character it drinks quite nice. I can see some being big fans of this just for the hop treatment. A bit different than I would want for stocking up the cellar but in the style of american barleywines I would say you need to try this one."
"Poured into a chalice a nice clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tannish head which lasted forever, then some really nice islands and sticky lacing followed. The nose is sweet malty, and lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, slightly bitter, with a nice touch of caramel. Medium body, ABV hidden very well. Very drinkable, a different barleywine in my book, but very very tasty."
"This is a good barleywine and those who like the style will probably enjoy this version."
"drinkability: pretty easy going"
"Mouthfeel is real smooth as you'd expect a 9.5% barleywine to be. Almost no carbonation and leans a little towards the slick side, but that's expected. Never gets ""too heavy."" Hops round this one out nicely. I'd like to try this one out after some laying down."
"Cheers!"
"A fine brew sent by dmeadows for the Super bowl o beer bet."
"It's pretty thick, especially with that bite as one of the accomplices. It's much heavier than a normal ale. Gotta really slug it down due to it being so dry. It's a sipper, big time. Drinkable, but only for a while. Really hard stuff."
"This is not for anyone who does not like a hoppy beer. Please if you want to experience a great example of an American barley wine please try this one. As I am indulging in my second pint while writing this I must conclude my review so I can further enjoy this marvelous brew."
"Pours a beautiful amber red with a hint of purple...or maybe I'm just dreaming that because of the label. Thick frothy head with a nice khaki color. Lace remains constant throughout the brew which makes the Druid Fluid very attractive. Smell is dominate with fruity hops which is pleasing to me. Has a hint of pine with a minor malty/choclatey undertone. Taste is quite fruity with a pleasant smoothness. There seems to be some grainy texture but that doesn't take away from the drinkability. Carbonation remains consistant throughout. Definitely pick up this brew. I love what Middle Ages has done with this barleywine. Definitely pick this one up if you get the chance, especially if you like your barleywines fruity."
"Got this freshly tapped cask ale on its first day out at Mahar's. Came with a big, fluffy, domed head that lasted for quite a while. Light copperey orange color and hazy. Aroma had big notes of floral and citrusy hops along with some sweet malt in the background and a boozy presence. This beer's strength is really detectable in the nose, and it is a great, complex aroma. Taste is very powerful - don't plan on being able to taste any additional beers after you've had this one. There is a substantial cirtus hop bang to start off, followed by an interestingly unique toffey-like malt flavor that I haven't ever experienced before. The finish has a nice bitterness, but I think this is somewhat toned down by the alcoholic strength of the beer. The mouthfeel on this ale was great, and I think the mouthfeel of just about any beer is enhanced by cask conditioning. It was served at an appropriate temperature for cask, and had a nice, subtle carbonation that did not steal any attention away from the great flavors of this beer. It had a nice thick feel on the tongue. Drinkability is not a shining characteristic of this beer. This is definately not meant for consumption in high volumes unless you want to inflict some pain on yourself. This would make a good after diner drink or night cap. Wouldn't do more than one, although as with many other beers from this brewery, one is a pleasure and very satisfying."
"D: A huge beer that is well done. Hoppy but also malty. I would drink it again."
"2006 bottle bought at Capone's in Norristown, PA in late december (wow, you know, i bought a lot of stuff there, more than i thought). Pours orange brown and clear with a tannish head. Smells sweet, a little buttery. Smooth milky, bitter malt flavor. Not overly bitter though, doesn't taste like its a super young beer. The buttery odor thing is represented in the flavor too, which is also something i picked up when i tried Wailing Wench from the same brewery. Maybe that's just a characteristic of their beers....but its not something im a huge fan of. Eh, its ok overall...drinks ok and isn't at all harsh."
"D- It is good but I wouldn't go crazy over it."
"Funny to drink, really, oddly drying, and reminiscent of ginger ale. Not particularly meaty, but still overall a good brew. Now, to find some fresh... to go with my remaining aged bottle."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a cloudy, amber color. There was a fairly good sized off-white head on it, but it dropped off rather quickly. An interesting aroma. Something different almost every time I take a whiff. Some citrus, as well as other fruits. Also some caramel and butterscotch. Maybe a hint of floral also. The taste is a touch harsh. I would expect more smoothness. Definitely a full body, and some of the carmal sweetness is coming through. A somewhat dry/slightly bitter/metallic aftertaste. Not enough to make it bad, just different. It doesnt taste like a bad bottle, just not the best flavor."
"I could not resist reviewing this beer on the Winter Solstice. Pours a good head. The nose is all ringwood since it is a Middle Ages brew. Malty with a bit of hops to it. It has a good mouthfeel and is easy to drink for a barleywine. A solid brew. Cheers."
"Truly enjoyed this Druid Fluid. The hop-malt balance tips slightly to the hop side and fits my tastes just fine. Nicely done."
"Gotta love the name of this beer, and it lives up to the hype. Very nice American barleywine--strong and hoppy. Amber colored beer with copper highlights, hazy. Strong hop character in the nose, clear, even over the turkey in the oven in the background. Big malty base comes through in the nose as well, but really stands out when taking a sip. Hop continues strong. On the web, it says the hop dominates when young, and that's exactly what I'm drinking. Strong, somewhat complex barleywine with an assertive hop. I think this one would aged very well, mellow the hop and add to the complexity of the six malt base. Worth the trip."
"A nice ballsy barleywine. Drinks a little hot and alcohol presence is undeniable, but its still damn tasty."
"An average barleywine. A shame, because the name is quite memorable even if the beer isn't!"
"This one doesn't try to be hugely anything, so don't expect to be hugely over impressed. The only thing I'd say this hugely is - is something I'd recommended for true barleywine fans."
"And oh how they danced, the little children of Stonehenge..."
"A very solid Barely Wine. This exampled was cellared for a while, I'd like to see have this on tap."
"Get one of these from the brewery if you can - great beer and great people."
"Not sure the age of this one but it looked good and smelled good with plenty of carbonation and sweet hoppiness on the nose. The taste was pleasantly balanced but with a great hop profile edging out the malt. The aftertaste was long and pleasant which BW lovers love. Great silky package as well. This is going back on the want list."
"I had this beer at Sunset Bar & Grill back in the winter and I really enjoyed it on tap. It's just as good out of the bottle. This is another above average beer from Middle Ages in Syracuse, NY."
"Pours a dark chestnut brown with a pretty dew body that leaves a spotchy tan head that disappears. The nose is sour, funky with a cooked sugar sweetness, floural hops with a strong malty background. The taste starts bitter upfront, strong hop and alcohal backdrop but balanced with a slight caramel sweetness. Nice barleywine good interpretation one that I will def go back to."
"Overall, a solid American barley wine."
"D: Not a huge fan of this beer. Sort of perfumy. Tastes as if made with sweet and low."
"While the looks bordered on a DIPA, the smell was nothing of the kind. The herbal hops were still amazingly evident, but the primary aroma was that of sweet malts, reminding me of a fruit cocktail from a can. The taste was also sweet, but not at all cloying. The individual fruit flavors were hard to pick out now, and the hops added a spicy edge. Alcohol was more evident than beers of this age, but not in a hot flashy way. This was quite a bit easier to drink than I remember from couple of years ago. I would not consider this a stunning barleywine, but it did taste quite good with some creamy Danish blue cheese."
"D - high, other than the high-ish ABV, this is an easy drinkin' BW"
"The purple wizardish label kicks ass. Plus it is gold foiled on top. This poured a very orangey amber with a great foamy off white head. Didn't last too long though. WOW! The aroma is amazing. Yeasty, fruity and strong. Kinda smells like a fruit elixer, like cough syrup. This smells o so sweet and hoppy, pine and citrus scents were noticed. The taste rocks as well. The caramel and fruit flavors rock. The alcohol isn't quite as attacking as I would have expected, you can feel it but not taste it. Nice warmth though. Many barley wines are just bumped up IPAs but even though this one kinda tastes like an ipa it is certainly a barleywine."
"Pours medium caramel with decent carbonation, not much head, some lacing. Smells are light with floral hops, a little dried fruitiness. Taste is rather balanced, hops, alcohol, and sweetness, almost caramel in nature. Very drinkable for a barleywine, a little lighter than others, but you can down more than one and be happy."
"tasty barleywine, interested to see how it will age."
"A tad dissapointing. I may have had too warm a bottle, but still, I was expecting more. It pours a nice amber with a thick creamu head and decent lacing. The smell is very nice..strong sweet maltiness, fruity elements, light yeastiness and alcohols note. However, very surprisingly, the tatse was very tart, pungent with an overwhelming hop presence...not what I expected. Mouthfeel was light to medium (is this 9.5abv?) and dry. The finish was too bitter which affects drinkability."
"2004 Vintage, Pours dark copper to muddy brown in color and quite cloudy. Sweet malt aromas of caramel, white grapes, prunes and over ripe berries. Tastes of sweet maltiness with a warm alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is thinner than I expected and I cannot discern any hop flavors, both probably due to age. A nicely aged barley wine that I would definitely hope to try fresh as well."
"Kind of reminds me of their Wailing Wench Double IPA, with maybe a touch more sweetness. I like that beer a lot, so that's great. I don't know why i was sitting on this for so long."
"Draught @ Redbones. Dark orange color. Sweet fruits (strawberries and raspberries), as well as some medicinal, herbaceous aroma hops in the nose. Hops are piney and medicinal, while the malt backing is strange and unfitting. Very sweet and just not all that exciting, at all."
"Medium bodied warming brew. Light herbally/woodsy hops on the finish that left a very tiny bit of dryness. High alcohol was hidden very well."
"not the greatest barleywine i've ever had, certainly worth a shot."
"This is incredibly drinkable for a barleywine. Dangerous. There is some flavor here that is really nice; I never tasted it in a barleywine before. Alcohol very well hidden. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of a slickness to it. Goes down fairly easily while still having a good chewy barleywine body. At this point I'm not left wanting to reach for another, however this has been in my cellar for a bit so I'll look out for a fresh bottle to try at other time. Thanks to dmeadows for throwing this my way."
"Overall very impressive."
"Another winner from Middle Ages"
"Amber with a tan head that lasts quite a long time. Nice lacing. Smell is of spice and pine. Mouthfeel is light and carbionated. Taste is hopped,but not overly so. Refreshing with a nice bite. The finish was spicy,with a hint of pine. Nice Christmas Ale!"
"Not to bad for an American Barleywine, but I was a little disappointed. The metallic bitterness and odd sort of taste left me with an odd feeling."
"Beer poured into a standard Logo'ed Pint glass. No head. Nice color - a pale golden bronze.Nice haze and opacity. Very little nose on the brew - a slight lemon/citrus tone was apparent. Neither malt nor hops domminate in this one, almost a strong pale ale flavor and note would best describe this brew. Good mouthfeel and it is easy, though not entirely rewarding, to drink. A good unoffensive redition of the Barley wine style."
"Smells almost like candy fruity, like overly fruity/sweet/chewy/sticky kids candy. Floral hop aroma. Hops are very up front for a barley wine in my view. And while they rest on a malt body, little sweetness, light viscosity. More of that fruit, and a creamy butter that starts to be a little unpleasant just as the hops kick it out and leave a pretty dry finish. The bitterness of the hops does away with the butter just before it becomes obtrusive. Mouthfeel is creamy from the butter, prickly from the hops, and full from the malt. This is a one a night at most kinda beer for me. An interesting and unique barley wine. Not the nightcap style thicker, sweeter, deeper Im most partial to but interesting for sure."
"Smells of berries, other fruits, and alcohol. Subtle taste of malt. Not much head to speak of, but a little white lace stays throughout this beer's consumption. There is a hint of caramel in the smell and taste as well. This beer is actually quite smooth for it's high alcohol content, which is most prevalent at the end of a sip."
"A decent sipper here. The warmth is good and the flavors develope nicely. Not the beastly barleywine it could be, but cleanly smooth, soothingly warm, and tender to the buds. Gives more of an impression of an English style then the bigger, hoppier American brutes that I tend to favor. Not bad though."
"Walnut brown in color, with some tinged of red. A small amount of off-white head. Most noticeable in the aroma is the caramel and toffee, but also some citrus notes. Sweet malty flavor with toffee and brown sugar. A little citrus in the finish. This was a little thinner than most barleywines I've had, but pretty good overall. It really hides the alcohol well!"
"Looks like murky iced tea in my glass with a fluffy head. The head fell to a film of bubbles that stuck around for the duration. Smells deliciously hoppy, much like Victorys StormKing. Now that has my attention. The malt smells very sweet and with the hops it smells like caramel with a bit of coffee. The flavor is very tangy, almost like grapefruit with a little malt behind it. The hops dont do much to the flavor and stand out a bit awkwardly. Its a bit different, but not entirely un-enjoyable. The mouth feel is thick with very light carbonation. Over all, Id say this beer is a tasty sipper that goes down smooth but its a barley wine. So, by style, its a bit of an odd one."
"Okay, by the end of the glass, the hops were wearing on me. A nice dry woody finish with a gentle alcohol sting, but also a bile-flavor...like when cacking up dry-heaves. Salty and acidic. I can't finish this one."
"Drinkability is good surprised the alcohol isnt as prevalent as I would expect it to be. All in all this was a nice change up from my usual porters."
"Thanks to rajendra82 for the beer. Viva BBBIF."
"Great amber color--not as dark as other barley wines. No head. Nose was very mild. Some fruits and sugary malts. Flavor was too good to put down. Berries come out at first quickly followed by all sorts of sugars. Floral bouquet then quickly rises but not too loudly so as to be a kick in the teeth, but more of a complement. Nice balance in this beer. Little bit of bread and wet flower as well. Mouthfeel is slightly cloying and stretched the cheeks out a bit. But not so much as to leave my taste buds in shock."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Appearance is a clear orange brown color with a small but persistent head. Smell is mixed berries with a dry champagne-like quality. Very interesting! There is also some bready malt there. In the taste, the berries really come out. This is the first non-fruit beer I've ever had that had such a pronounced berry taste. The sweetness of the berries and malt is balanced out by an extreme prickly dryness which dominates the finish. Alcohol is also slightly noticeable but in a good way. Mouthfeel is very nice as well, but it could maybe use a bit more body. This sample is much better than the one I had a few months ago, so it appears that age has done it well. A very bold offering and definitely of the most interesting beers (which I mean in a really, really good way) I have had in awhile."
"Drinkability was good... I liked it and would have it again."
"Pours a golden brown, clear, tight white head, copious lacing. Smell was alcohol, fruity and malty, sweet plums, small amount of hops in the nose. Taste is some alcohol up front, dark fruits, floral hoppy bitterness. Pretty smooth, carbonation was nice and low. Definately more of an english style barleywine and the hops were very subdued, however a tasty beer. Thanks DrJay!"
"Deep reddish amber colour, very clear, with a cream coloured head. The aroma is rich in malt with lower degrees of hops, ripe fruit, sugary sweetness and alcohol. The flavour is dominated by a combination of caramel maltiness, alcohol, and bitterness, with lower levels of fruit and hop character. The alcohol was a little on the coarse side, especially towards the finish. However, this mellowed somewhat as it warmed up and the fruit flavour became more pronounced, resulting in a better balance. Slightly grainy and viscous texture, decent body with lower carbonation. I found this one to be more English-like in character, with hops taking more of a backseat to malt. Not super complex, but it doesn't need to be. I'd definitely have this one again."
"Druid Fluid is a friendly sort of barleywine and would be a great beer to introduce the uninitiated to the style. I'm enjoying the fruitiness and the easy drinkability, but there are a whole host of other versions that I'd reach for first. Thanks to HappyHourHero for the bottle."
"Just average IMO...for me, so many better options out there."
"Bottle: Poured a copper-brown color ale with a medium dark head with excellent retention. Aroma of strong malty sweetness with subtle alcohol notes is clearly evident. Taste has a real creamy feel to it with some malt but everything seems to be covered by strong bitter hops. Body is full and even though taste has a warming feel to it you cannot detect the alcohol. Good barleywine overall but I guess I prefer them without too many hops and more malt presence or again maybe I should have aged the bottle a bit more."
"Thanks to ericaweizen for the chance to try my second Middle Ages brew!"
"Thx to HappyHourHero for the bottles."
"Just some curling and twisting of covering bubbles that sticks somewhat. Dark orange hue with a bit of haze but also some nice action heading up. Oaky malt, rhubarb, and some salty pine essence on nose with a Sherwin Williams paint fining. Kind of an airy flavor, not syrupy like many barleywines, and there is some kind of berry in there that is unusual; I know the alcohol is in there, but the malt is so understated, again, for the style, that it is dangerously drinkable. A little unusual, but top-notch."
"The beer pours a slightly cloudy chestnut color with some ruby highlights. I get a small fizzy beige head on an agressive pour. Aroma is some lemon mixing with butterscotch and toffee and a hit of ripe plums and raisins. The first sip reveals a smooth textured almost creamy body with very, very fine carbonation that tingles across my palate. Flavor is generally sweet with toffee and brown sugar up front which rolls to a slightly bitter finish that I attribute to alcohol not hops. Other than the bitey finish the beer is very smooth and easy to drink and enjoyable. I get a bit of belly warming afte the swallow. A nice brew for sure!"
"Pours a hazy amber/orange with 1/2 inch of tan head. The aroma is very sweet and malty. There are hints of raisens and oranges, and the hops come through just enough to balance the aroma nicely, though I wouldn't mind some more hop aroma. Feels like a lot going on in the mouth, it's sweet up front, the malt really doing it's job. There's a taste of alcohol that kicks in next, but it's smooth and warm. There's a smokey finish that is interesting, I really like it. Not too hoppy, but the hops are present and balance the malt nicely, with a slightly bitter bite at the end. Very smooth in the mouth without being sticky."
"I'm not really sure what to think about this one. Looked decent. Poured an orange amber colour with really sticky nice looking lacing. Smell was fruity with a bit of hops. Everything was nice up until the tasting came. I thought it was quite bitter and had a bit of an alcohol bite. I didn't care for it. The mouthfeel was smooth, but it seemed far too heavy to get a good drinkability rating. Perhaps the beer itself is bad and I should try it again. For now, however, this rating stands. It's not for me."
"On a side note, I will say that the cask-conditioned is better than the bottled version, but still a very good beer. I never had any problems with my caps, but that is probably because I transported the beer myself and treated it like it was fragile glassware. If you every find yourself near Syracuse, do yourself a favor and visit the brewery. It will be well worth the trip. Additionally, if you find yourself within a couple hundred miles of cask-conditioned Druid Fluid, go and drink some!"
"Gold foil removed, cap blasted off the bottle with much force. Have no idea how old this is, which would be nice to know. Really nice shade of amber/garnet. Smells slightly estery and floral. Classic underbelly of malt in the vapors. Highly hoppy. I assume this is the intention? Very IPA like with a nicely sweet undercurrent of fruity malt. Raisin, clove, pepper and sugar dance behind the hop veil. It's pretty well balanced but the over-hopped barleywine's just aren't my thing. Still a great beer."
"i see it's charm, and i'll bang it.. but i will not propose."
"For me, this is a near perfect barleywine. It's an all-inclusive brew, combining aspects of particular variations of IPA, with their citrusy-goodness, and a much more malt based old ale. Not only can this be consumed very easily, it can also be stored for ages! Let those hops mellow out, and you've got a nicely balanced barleywine. This particular bottle has been around in my possesion for about seven months and is very well-balanced, but still shows many signs of rich citrus hops. I need a new bottle."
"A very good barleywine, one that could definitely be laid down for with very positive mellowing efects. Thanks again to Southernbrew for my first beer from Middle Ages, which turned out to be a fine barleywine."
"Thanks to shippos for this one. Pours an amber color with a small head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma has a good caramel character with some citrus hops. The flavor is incredibly smooth for the level of alcohol. The caramel malts and the hops blend very well and make for a really enjoyable brew. Drinkability is really good, especially for the level of alcohol."
"This one pours a slightly pale copper color with a finger of head that falls to a healthy coating over the beer. The nose is really nice, with a nice blast of citrusy hops over tope of a really nice thick caramel malt. It smells really damn good. The flavor is nice. Very balanced between super fantastic grapefruity sweet hops and very mellow but pronounced caramel malt. The hop also rides on as a residual bitter, but in the best wey. No offensiveness, no harshness. All sweet hop. The feel is nice and thick, bordering on slightly syrupy. Very coating over the tongue. Shit. I just checked the ABV and it says 9.5. I would have guessed 7, just because I know its a barleywine. Wow. Not even a hint of that alcohol anywhere. This beer is dangerous...in a good way. I will need t find a way to get this beer in Kentucky again."
"I had this on tap at The Blue Tusk during a recent visit to Syracuse. It came as a cloudy amber beer with only a thin head. It has a great malty nose, heightening my anticipation level all the more. My first reaction to it was that it is very sweet, then that it is very potent, hence the small serving size. It tastes of cherries and plums, but with a warmness brought on by the alcohol content. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and the finish is pleasant with a good, slightly hot afterburn. Yum yum."
"On-Tap at the brewery tap :-) Dark ruddy amber/brown with a nice collar of khaki foam. The aroma is complex and it consists of dark fruits, caramel, roasted malts, alcohol, toffee, fresh, somewhat raw, herbal hops, and more! This is one hell of a beer. The taste is also very, very complex. I taste a sweet, juicy blast of fruit flavors up front, with a deep caramel malt backbone that also shows hints of toffee. The finish is juicy, with fresh green hops stealing the show. The mouthfeel is thick, coating and perfect, and the finish is very warming and decadent. The drinkability is also awesome for a barleywine. In fact, this is almost a ""session"" barleywine! Awesome stuff. Truly."
"Maybe their best brew. Barleywine it is also major hoppy and ringwood yeast and Candylike malting. Very drinkable and satisfying. Was fresh off the line served up by Old Marcus and cheers to him for this. Must get more. even a tad of bitterness in aftertaste as opposed to too much sweetness. Could be interesting iff ageable. Unique and to be enjoyed by all but the harshest palate."
"This poured out a deep cloudy copper color with a good-sized off white head. Good lacing and retention. Aroma contained cherries, caramel and a bit of other malty goodness. I really had to get this one swirling around to get much from the nose, as it was quite weak. The flavor started off with fruit sweetness before a bit of roastiness came on the backside. Notes of alcohol and caramel popped up throughout. Mouthfeel was full with a sticky sweetness. Pretty good overall drinkability, a very solid barley wine. I would definitely have this again. Thanks goes to ppoitras for this fine brew."
"Pretty drinkable for a Barleywine. Lighter in terms of abv% than most of the style as well. A bit bland re: flavor but a pretty pleasant ale. IMO there are many other better tasting barleywines out there, but this one is worth a try."
"Dark peach color with a nice frothy sticky white head on the pour in the goblet. Tropical sweetish pineapple fragrance in the nose. Initial stinging bitter grapefruit taste mellows into orange rind and sweet caramel notes on the tongue. The feel is quite rich and full bodied on the tongue and mouth. The brew then dries the tongue on the finish with slight abv warmth in the chest. Comforting in its rich bitterness. Nice."
"Bottle, of at least 6 months of age. Clear orange with a lasting tan head. Piney hop aroma. Spicy and earthy. Full mouth feel, with nice malt sweetness and lots of hops. Lingering spicy piney hop finish. Not too big. Nice complexity and drinkability."
"Tastes malty sweet, caramel, fresh bread, slight spices. Definately smells bigger than it tastes. Rather thin feeling for a BW, I prefer the thick, coating kind. I would call this an English style BW-less assertive than our American BW's. Finishes is medium w/ some hops. It need smore hops to balance the predominant malts. The alcohol is well hidden, barely warming. Not bad but not too exciting or memorable either."
"The beer appears a brownish-red or reddish brown poured in this here wine glass (It is time for me to get a real goblet)."
"A slightly hazey amber ale with a small beige head. At first the aroma is full of a fruity sweetness and then in the background the is a building hop presence. The hops make their presence felt in the flavor right away. There is some sweetness in the taste and some of it comes again from the hops in the form of a grapefruit finish. It will be interesting to see what happens to these characteristics after being put down for a year (or two)."
"Pours with a one-finger white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Good carbonation. Nose is a sweet floral. Medium bodied. Starts with an excellent mix of hops and malt, very warming the alcohol is noticeable. Some hop aftertaste. $3.55 for a 12oz bottle from Olivers Beverage Cen. Albany, NY."
"I expected this to be more British, in style, with a malt dominance. Overall, however, this has some kickass hoppiness that prevails. Nicely complex, highly drinkable, and an excellent Barleywine. Wish I could Middle Ages brews in my area."
"Very enjoyable, definitely a hop focus but not as much as others I've had. I have 4 more and am anxious to see if some of the rough edges can be smoothed out. Good nonetheless."
"Great big hops on the tongue. Various hops flavors: bitingly bitter, floral and citrusy. Rich malt with a hint of alcohool bite. Lightly nutty. Full bodied and chewy with a pleasantly bitter hops aftertaste. A pleasant surprise, this one. Could stand to be aged a bit for sure but very tasty and drinkable now. A fine barleywine."
"Pours a delicious tawny red color with an off-white head that falls to a thick Belgian lace. The aroma is alcohol, honey, caramel, grassy hops, plums, and apples. The taste leads with a calm before the storm as the flavors debate who should go first before they all bumrush your palate. It's an onslaught, but nothing particularly amazing to me. Alcohol is over the top, malts are subdued, hops are walking around all addlebrained. Unbalanced, in a word. I'm going to hang on to the rest of this pack for a couple months and see what happens. Mouthfeel is sharp and biting due to carbonation and alcohol, with a very dry finish. Decent to drink, and better than others I've had, but nothing to write home to at this point."
"Druid Fluid just love the name it was the reason for picking this brew off the shelf then I saw it was a barley wine and had to have it. Amber brew with nice head that falls to thumbnail sized creamy cap feed by constant stream of rising bubbles. Leaves a light lacing on my glass. Aroma is fruity malt with a light hop aroma. Tatse is malt, toffee, fruity and hoppy. More mellow then other barley wines nothing really comes to surface as dominating just a fruity malty brew with hint of toffee and a good dose of the old hop. Taste is good but not extraordinary. Mouthfeel is good little light for the style in my humble opinion. Drinkability is good no real alcohol taste just nice warming of the insides."
"Overall: This is easily one of the best American barleywines I've ever had. Simply flawless! The key word here is smooth. This is one heavenly brew from beginning to end. Highly recommended!"
"Very smooth and mellow, with a sweet citrus pucker emerging mid sip. The substantial alcohol is masked quite well, which makes this some dangerous stuff. A mild bitterness finishes this off, but overall quite pleasant."
"Drinkability: Probably wouldn't have grabbed another one if I had one available, but definitely not hard to finish the bottle."
"Appearance: dark brown apricot color, murky, with a little bit of head whihc recedes very quickly. Lace is not very sticky. Smell has a lot of toasted rye and wheat, with a spicy sweet chocolate smell and an charred earthy ester behind. Malt backbone is there too, with a tiny hint of hops. When you taste this beer, it almost takes you aback. The taste is very sharp up front, with a raw unmellowed hop flavor and a spiced citrus hint, with the butter from the ringwood yeast definately evident. I wasnt bothered by the aftertaste, which was pleasantly bitter and spicy, but my compatriots mostly noted that it was too metalic and bitter. Medium body and a blast of sharp carbonation give this a great mouthfeel. This beer definately needs to be aged a few years, to let the flavors tune down and mellow."
"12 ounce bottle, consumed slightly below room temp. nice foil around the cap. adds a touch of class. Pours orangey amber, moderate head/carbonation, tiny bubble film and leaves moderate lacing. Vinious, musty nose, hints of varnish. Very dry barley wine, notes of paint remover, melon, brandy, honey, biscuits (can you say complex?) very resiny hops. Grapefruit notes. Strong stuff, probably would age nicely. I'll never know, I like this stuff too much. Interesting BW, worth checking out if you enjoy this style. alot going on in this one."
"A tasty and interesting barleywine. Very English in nature in that it is malty but well balanced, but throws just a hint of Americanization in the fruitiness and sweetness. Murky tan body that leaves little lacing on top. Burnt malts start and end this brew, with a sticky hop flavor and a lot of citrus and lemon flavors that are easily detectable in the aftertaste too. Nose is both sweet and toasty with notes of lemon juice. Mouthfeel is more creamy than smacking with hops, as fits with the more English style. A great drinker, the higher ABV barely noticeable. One I wish I bought many more of, both to drink now and to age, as I think this would get quite interesting with time. Seek this one out."
"Overall, this was a solid barleywine style ale and easily my favorite Middle Ages brew. Big thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the bottle!"
"I love Middle Ages. They do things right and take a lot of pride in what they do. It shows in a big way here."
"Thanks to mah honey for schlepping this back from NYC for me."
"Notes: I like nearly everything about this beer other than the dryness which only affects the drinkability for me. To me a barleywine should finish slightly sweet. Still very solid! Cheers!"
"It pours an almost clear copper with a medium off-white head, sticking to the glass. Aroma of rich cream, dry malt, caramel and maple a an unappropriate yeasty character that shows in the form of dust. Taste is a big surprise, very fruity (berries, grapes), very alcoholic with a dry cobwebs finish. Medium bodied with high carbonation. This is no JW Lees.."
"A big, thick, cream-colored dense head collapses to a bumpy, rocky creamscape. Thick, psycho, lacy lacing. A foggy, orange/brown beer tries to hide some pinkishness. The nose is sweet, cream, fruity caramel. There is alcohol and some ink. A sweet caramel front shows lots of hops. A thick, syrupy middle, full of fruit. But it's not too sweet. Nice. The finish dries, but is still fruity fresh. Apples. And it's quite hoppy bitter. Some ink survives. What a nice, light, fruity, hoppy barley wine. It's fairly sweet, but that's nicely offset by big, tart, citrus hoppiness."
"A different barlewine, to be sure. But one I really enjoyed. Another success from the Middle Ages folks."
"Strong alcohol aroma aroma, pours with a deep reddish amber color, and a reasonable-sized fluffy off-white head, after pouring in a Rapscallion snifter. Smooth buttery flavor up front, but the alcohol is the overpowering taste here. Wish additional malt or something would temper the ethanol a bit, but that just doesn't seem to be happening today. Still, for a barleywine, that sort of trait has to be somewhat expected. Another worthy brew from Middle Ages, just wish they were a little more available outside of the region."
"Appearance: Semi-clouded copper hue with an off white cream colored head leaves fine specks of lacing down the sides of the glass. Aroma: Great English style malts here blended with an edge of pine cone and orange peel thrown in for good measures, the nose is very peculiar but the creamy edge and citrus profile brings it together. Taste: Very sweet creaminess in the flavor some candi sugar is here creating alot of sweetness, but at the same time there's a load of hopes here fighting it out for the balance of sweet and bitterness. Who will prevail, well I'm not sorry to say that a draw was found due to the pure awesome mix that each caramel sugary malts and pine cone orange citrus hops add here to the complexity. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied mild carbonation goes down without any cloying edges. Drinkability: Beware of the alcohol goes down quite smoothly here."
"Pours a burnt-copper color with a fantastic, lace-producing head. The aroma is a wildly complex mix of ripe fruits and floral hops. My first smell made me think of a well hopped American-Style Barleywine, but as your nose settles into the beer, sweet malts and fruits come popping out.Id like to have one after its aged for a couple of years. Apricot, Cherry, Plumsesters and alcohol. The taste is less complex than the aroma: grainy, malty, softness and alcohol. A little butterscotch, but nothing too serious. Finish is a slightly bitter. This is a solidly good barleywine. It falls short of the best beers of the style, but it is quite drinkable and very enjoyable.perfect for a cold January night."
"Decent drinkability but not as subtle and complex has I would have liked."
"This is a deep amber with a good head. It is a little bit thin on the flavor, but it has a fruity finish. It's far from bad, but there's nothing here that makes me willing to go out searching for it in the future. To be truly great, it would need to have the malt bumped up a good bit."
"Thanks to Todd!"
"Translucent deep orange color with a big beige heads that lasts for a while. Nose is complex, some of your typical barley wine aromas, big malt, hops and alcohol (a bit masked in this one). But yet perfumy (that's where the hops are), fruity and estery at the same time. Taste is a bit subdued, not as aggressive as other barley wines I've had. But that's good. It's fruitiness is kept to an appreciative threshhold. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is delicate and intricate with it's minimal carbonation despite it's fluffy and lacy head. Drinkability is good considering it's style."
"I also had the pleasure of this mighty brew on cask at the toad. Aged 2 years this had really come into its own. Not as raw as the bottle fresh version. Poured a hazy mahogony color with a little bit of white head. Smell was great with huge esters seeping down my nostrils and tickling my throat along with a serious bit of piney hops to balance out the huge malted notes. Taste was like drinking carbonated molassas. It was so tasty with huge rolling waves of caramel and molassas sweetness morphing into pure brown sugar coupled with a more subdued hop taste and huge notes of alcohol. This was a rare treat and perfect for the gathering."
"Big thanks to McCall for this one!"
"One of my all time favorite brews. Pours a dirty tan head, holds up better than most Middle Ages. Its a cloudy dark amber beer with a slight orange hue. Smells like a sweet Worther's Original. This beer is just so damn smooth, how strong is it? Oh man, be careful, this is like liquid crack, highly addictive. There's a butterscotch-hoppyness to the taste, very interesting. Its gone! Where am I gonna score my next fix?"
"Thanks to WRXbeerwagon for this. Had this on tap at the Blue Tusk in Syracuse not too long ago, and glad to try it again. Deep amber brown body with a beautiful light tan head. Smells of sweet toffee cookie dough with a subtle hop presence. Taste is dominated by the sweet cookie dough malts at first, but is balanced nicely by citrusy, spicy hops. Lingering bitterness and alcohol. This is a big and syrupy beer, but thankfully, it's not too cloying."
"This pours a nice medium brown with a little orange tint to it with a real nice creamy,rocky head that sticks very well,not much of an aroma some light fruitiness and alcohol smell to it.Taste is nice and and almost whisky-like with some dried fruit flavors with a dryish finish.A real nice beer from a brewery I like to drink from when in Buffalo visiting the future in-laws."
"There's a lot of bitter in this one. As others have noted, grapefruit flavors dominate. I have a Friggin' grapefruit tree. If I want grapefruit juice, I can squeeze it fresh!! This tastes almost like a mediocre west coast IPA. It's nice, but not a barleywine, from my tastebuds POV."
"The flavor delivers more fruit and less hop flavor than the aroma suggests. It starts with the big juicy fruit that the aroma exhibits (apple, apricot, plum, cherry, almost pineapple but not so sour); followed by some soft, buttery caramel and mineral character as it warms; and finishes with leafy/piney hop flavors, a bold bitterness, some dry, woody characater, and a touch of mildly peppery alcohol. The aftertaste is a long and winding road where the different flavors previously encountered reappear again and again at different points. Most complex, and quite enjoyable - and the Ringwood yeast really stands out here!"
"A very unique barleywine from Syracuse, NY. You're greeted with a dark amber brew with smallish tan head. Candy sugar with some raisin/prune aromas mingle with earthy hops, butterscotch, and Belgian mustiness. The flavors lean toward fresh earthy hops with some sweet sugary malt and finishes with a strong bitterness. It has a medium body holding the complex hop flavors, now I've got it, the hops have a minty, herbal quality that was hard to pin down, and fruity flavors like apples and peaches, an interesting route to follow for a barleywine."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a nice head that remains and laces. The aroma is of fruity Ringwood yeast, hops, and multiple malts. The taste is extremely smooth with a little warming, but overall good balance between hops and malts. The body is medium. It's not at all hard to swallow like some barley wines. The beer is very drinkable. An excellant choice, but not as good as Bigfoot Barley Wine."
"Lovely beer. Pours a messy white head. Beautifully uneven. Rich copper color, a little murky. Excellent lacing. Smells hoppy and rich, also a little sweet. Wonderful aroma. Tastes hoppy,too. Feels a little thick on the tongue, but the aroma and memory of the taste more than make up for this, and make it very drinkable."
"Really delightful stuff. And staggeringly drinkable for a baby barleywine. How much more stately can this become with age?"
"i am a big beer fanatic and have several hundred vintage ales layed down whats great about this is that it's drinkable as soon as it hits the shelves i found the complex malt quility very inviting with hints of dark fruit and a wounderful bready finish. have this with a piece of chocolate and injoy!"
"I suppose I've gotten accustomed to massive American-influenced barley wines that yank out your tongue and stomp on it a few times. Druid Fluid seemed more like the well-mannered English cousin, and perhaps more like a strong ale. While this beer won't snap your head back, it is immensely drinkable."
"Overall a good Barley Wine. This one grew on me as I drank it. A bit more aroma and body and this could be a great Barley Wine IMHO. I very nice intro to Barley Wines for the beginner."
"Thank you Davo."
"Deep Golden/Orangish in color....nose is quite interesting...juicy hops and butterscotch combination...taste is definitely juicy hops up front with that butterscotch flavor on the finish..Not real thick and rich....alcohol bites a little but seems pretty hidden...an interesting twist to the types of Barley Wines I've tried...definitely worth trying...I prefer a bit more body and tickness to my barley Wines but there is nothing wrong with this one either..."

"The ultimate delight to see, a Barley Wine, all murky and masculine sitting in the glass, the massive light tan head floating on that reddish-purple liquid, and the nose, Robust, nay I say, sinewy, lusty, vigorous are words needed to describe this beer. Fusel alcohol, over ripe pineapple, corn mash, lightly sweet and oh so pleasant an aroma for the schnozzle. Thick malt at the front, the top muscular, the finish alcohol bitter and the hops devastating in their spicy bite, potently acidic, aftertaste dry and alcohol bitter, Oh Yeah Baby, I love it."
"Notes: Yeah, I just want to say “juicy fruit” again. This beer does not surprise me coming from this brewery, I expected something of this greatness to come fro them."
"Notes: A very English-like barleywine, with very complex characters that are not typical of your US-made variety. Well worth a try if you're looking for a big beer that's different. Damn tasty!"
"This is a kick ass strong beer.  Sip with caution.  The smell is great with a nice feel to the mouth.  Not really any head because of the cask-condition, but a little white head was created at first.  White lace is left behind on the glass after drinking all of it.  Overall a yummy tasting beer"
"Outstanding barley wine. Frightningly drinkable."
