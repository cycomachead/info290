"The oak does this well. Woody bitterness subsides with air. Mild Creme brulee, big vanilla and hint of toffee. Oh yeah - and booze. Muy bien"

"Overall - Fantastic barrel. The wood permeates and some oxidation goes a long way in this beer."

"O: This is a very good BA barleywine that retains some hoppiness and isn't very barrel-forward. Certainly a bruiser but more restrained than I was expecting."
""
""
""
"O- Very nicely done BA English Barleywine. Not anywhere near the best, but it's definitely better than the vast majority of the other BA English Barleywines out there."

"Rating #1,100!!! 2012 bottle from trade. Thanks dude! Pours dark reddish amber with a small yellowish khaki head. Aroma of hard candies (like the kind on the outside of candy apples), brown sugar, toffee, biscuits, a small bit of vanilla, oak, and some whiskey. Flavor is very similar to the regular version up front: hard candy, toffee, biscuity sweetness. But the finish provides something new: notes of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. The difference from the regular is rather subtle and maybe that's because this has been in the bottle for 2 years or so. Slick and thickish bodied, low carbonation, but not quite syrupy. This is a very good beer, but I must say, I am a bit disappointed at the lack of barrel influence here. I was expecting a big oaky vanilla infusion here that I didn't really get."
"O: Numbskull is great to start out with, the barrel aging makes it even better. Well balanced malt and sweetness forward with some smooth finish."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Under medium bodied with pretty high carbonation. Okay mouthfeel, probably a little thin for my tastes. Overall, I wasn't a huge fan of this BA version of Numbskull. As I mentioned before, I could not shake the impression of buttery flavor and that pretty much sealed this beer's fate for me. Definitely would not be opposed to trying this again at some point to give it another shot."

"o - Overall I thought this was a very good beer but the taste is a bit harsh right now, keeping it from being great. I'd guess is a few years this will be outstanding. The nose is great and there is a ton of bourbon and caramel throughout. Would like to get another bottle and revisit in a year."

"This beer was pretty good, no doubt, but I don't exactly think it lives up to the acclaim it has been given. Perhaps I should have let the bottle mellow out a bit more? As is, it's a bit too ""in your face"" with the bourbon and heat to thoroughly enjoy more than a four ounce sample. It's delicious in extremely small doses; the flavors are excellent and work well together, but it becomes clamoring and cumbersome in larger ones due to its heat. I'd like to have this again with more age and see how it fares."

"This is a very good beer with a strong character. At the moment the bourbon is a bit harsh, but it will smooth out over time for sure."

"Very complex and delicious beer. The barrels really works nicely for this beer, but all the malt and hop flavors just shine richly."

"O - I thought this was a decent BA barleywine but it was still too hoppy for my taste. The hops and bitterness throw it off a bit."

"Alesmith knows their way around a barrel, & this is no exception; I'd be delighted if they stepped up the frequency & volume of their releases. A standard for the fairly rare style of barrel-aged old ale: an excellent beer."

"Pours a murky dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood. Taste is much the same with a woody flavor and an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great aroma and some tasty barrel aged flavors."

"Overall - Perhaps a bit past it's prime, but still a fantastic beer. The smell was amazing and with a little more carbonation this beer would have been even better. Glad I had the chance to try this."
"Bottle: Poured a deep copper color ale with a light foamy head with minimal retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of sweet toffee and caramel notes with light cardboard notes and light bourbon notes. Taste is also dominated by sweet toffee notes with some caramel malt with some bourbon notes though not as much as expected. Light cardboard notes a re revealing that this bottle might be past its prime. Bourbon notes are not as dominant as I would have expected. Body is a little bit thin for style with medium carbonation and no apparent alcohol notes. Fell a bit short of my expectation but good nonetheless. It would be interesting to try a fresher bottle next time."
"Overall this was super even though I think it is slightly past it's prime. The oxidated notes and low carbonation hurt the overall experience but it's a deal breaker for this style. I would say consume this within 5 years for maximum enjoyment so it is still worth it to seek out the 2007 release but get it soon."

"The beer is hazy and appears brown to amber in color. The head is off white and thin. The aroma is bold and offers malt, booze, toffee, dark fruits. Very enticing. The flavor really delivers. A delightful beer to sip and savor. Medium to full bodied. Very malt forward and well balanced. A gem - I definitely recommend this beer."
""
"Beer is medium in body, creamy with a mildly dry finish. It is strong, fruity and malty. Very strong, nice finish, a very good beer."

"O: A great barley wine and an improvement on the original. Thanks ipa247."

"O: Good but it is peaking IMO or has recently peaked"
"6/26/10. Sampled at the Tally Tasting 2010, with HUGE thanks to fata2683. Could have used this as rating 1900, but I did like one brew better, so Iâ€™m using it for 1899. Aroma is AWESOME BA. Amazing buttery, vanilla, coconut, holy shit. The flavor will knock you over. Much the same but with wonderful sweet and dark fruits. Love it."

"Drink- This was very damn tasty. I haven't had the Old Numbskull as a base beer yet, so this was quite a treat. Ill have to go pick up a bottle. Great imparted flavors on the beer and aged quite well."
"170/223. Sampled with the MN crew at the Winter gathering. Bottle via trade from cbkschubert. aroma of sweet malt, toffee, huge wood influence, alcohol, vanilla and loads of bourbon spice. Pours thick amber with minimal carbonation or head. Boatloads of vanilla, charred wood and bourbon on the palate. Spice. Sweet charred caramel. Toffee. Creme brulee. Holy thickness! Chewy. Rich thick and oily."
"Poured hazy reddish-brown hue with a large off-white frothy head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate complex aroma of bourbon, malt and caramel. Medium to heavy body with chewy malt texture and flat carbonation. Flavor is full complex sweet with the same complexity of moderate to long duration. This is one of the best."
"I mean, it was horrible, trade me all your bottles for daisy cutter."
"O - I think I actually prefer the regular 2007 over the Barrel-Aged version. Perhaps a bit too much oak for me in this one. I wonder how the other years stack up to 2007? I guess I'll have to try them and see."
"O: Not as overwhelming as some of the other Alesmith barrel aged releases, but quite good, and significantly better than the previous times I've had it."
"Pour yields a caramel-colored brew with a thin off-white head. Nose is filled with aromas of sweet bourbon, caramel, and a bit of brown sugar. Mild booze there as well. Flavor is not as integrated as the nose, but the bourbon is nice. Not terribly bourbon-forward, however. Also some caramel, sweet bread, and some brown sugar intermingling. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation and a bit of booze in the finish. A very excellent brew that I had wanted to try for some time. Thanks again, JR."
"Bravo"
"And this is also my 500th review on BA :)"
"This is the best BA barleywine that I've had to date and I wish I that I had more bottles."
"Overall I'd wanted to try this beer for a good while and I'm glad I had the opportunity. Yet another outstanding barrel-aged beer from AleSmith and one that's well worth a shot."
"Really nice and interesting -bal aged beer. Great to finally tick this one. AleSmith once again does not disappoint."
"Chad"
"Drinkability: I liked this one a little bit less than the non-bal version, truth be told. It just lacked a lot of the complexity and had a lot more unwanted spiciness and aggressiveness. Maybe this one would hold its own against the aforementioned when they were both aged differently (the aged Old Numbskull I had was an '07, as well), but nonetheless ... this one's simply lacking in a few places, with the bourbon (or the aging) covering up a few of the really nice notes that I got out of the non-bal version. Don't get me wrong - the -bal version is splendid, with the vanilla and coconut overtones amplifying some wonderful elements of this brew ... but it definitely leaves a few of the highlights untouched."
"D-this seems to have some malt issues going on, tons of burnt sugars in the flavor and a little too much alcohol. the flavors don't work super well together, the barrel aging is rather pleasant with the flavors it has added but it did thin out a little while in those barrels."
"I liked this more than the BA Wee Heavy, but less than BA Decadence and BA Speedway."
"Full creamy body a bit over carbonated, but still quite nice. Good beer, but would be better if aged in a wine barrel."
"The flavor is an oddly sour/fruity combination, but not in a bad way. Lots of caramel and toasty maltiness. Very boozy. The body is medium and the carbonation is appropriately low. Like most of the barrel aged Alesmith releases, I found this one to be solid, though very unspectacular."
"The palate is beautifully integrated with flavors of caramel, toffee, dried fruits and nuts with dates being prominent. Vanilla and bourbon are present as well, growing in prominence mid-palate with the brown sugar, maple sugar and honey. Fruity with a pronounced English yeast character, this is great. Warming on the finish with lingering flavors of caramel and toffee, there's also a touch of spice and a chocolate liqueur. Full in body with moderate carbonation and a great finish, I guess it's safe to say that I'm not filing my taxes tonight."
"This beer is just a thing of beauty and is one of the better barleywines I've had in some time. As the beer warms, I pick up a bit of chocolate as well... just very, very nice."
"Overall, I've come to the conclusion that my favorite BA beers are english barleywines. I can't think of a better style of beer to match the bourbon characteristics. This is another great example to support my conclusion."
"D- Sips by sip, this doesn't drink all that slow, but the warming sensation gives the impression that this is only a couple glasses and done. Considering the 11%, nice drinkability."
"D- The taste doesn't quite deliver what the smell promises but non the less I think this vintage is drinking very well right now."
"D: Absolutely delicious."
"This is an excellent barleywine that was probably world class a year or two ago. The flavors have mellowed out a bit and it's extremely drinkable, but it's probably lost a little complexity and body. Still extremely good."
"2007 vintage pours rosy deep copper with brown hues and micro thin off white head. The aroma is smooth oak moving to pine hops, vanilla, caramel and bourbon soaked oak. The taste is smooth goodness with pine hops mixing with vanilla and a mild amount of bourbon. The oak picks up toward midway and to the finish with increasing bourbon and a slight alcohol burn. Yum."
"No carbonation to talk about, but I'm not complaining as it works very well for this beer, a sipping beer for sure. Syrupy and coating on the palate. Drinking the whole 750ml by myself might take a while but I wouldn't complain if I had to do it."
"D: Sip, Savor, and Repeat until the bottle is empty."
"World class beer. Outstanding."
"d: Thanks to the absurdly generous rallison for the chance to try this one. I enjoyed this more than the score would indicate I think."
"D - Nope. Too big, too thick, too strong."
"Smell is all about the bourbon barrel,some vanilla. Kind of thin feel in the mouth, not much carbonation,taste on the bourbon side with a hint of chocolate/Vanilla. The barrel is the highlight of this brew. Certainly not sessionable. Well not tonight anyway. Of course I have just came back from O'Brien's where it was all about Pliny The Younger>My Bloody Valentine>Cask Stone Sublimely. So this review may be tainted. lol But for a late night sipper to end the night it is working."
"D: Definitely mellowed out the hops from the original version. This one goes down nicely despite its intensity."
"Garnet brown color with significant tan carbonation. Smells of bourbon, caramel, boozy dark fruits, and wood. Taste is more of the same. Not too hot, and the hops are totally mellowed out compared to fresh Numbskull. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Really nice and much different from regular Numbskull."
"Overall: One of the best barleywines that I have enjoyed. Seek out! A must try....cheers!"
"if I had the chance to I would crack this bad boy as much as possible. its a great beer."
"Reddish amber color with an off-white head. Smell is really sweet with lots of bourbon and butterscotch and some vanilla. Sweet caramel, quite a bit of booze in the taste, as well as oak and some bourbon flavors. High carbonation and medium body. Thanks to iowaherkeye for sharing a sample and to doubleo for giving me a bottle to share with some age on it. I'm looking forward to seeing how this ages and hopefully develops."
"Overall, whatever hangups are in this beer with the sweetness, the good points far outweigh any negative ones."
"This showed signs of complimentary oxidation. The malt was very aggressive in the flavor, with notes of maple, and tons of bourbon. The nose had some nice tobacco character."
"Notes from and tasted on 1/15/05"
"Last of the barrel aged Alesmiths I needed to try and while this was not better than the Speedway, it beat out the Wee Heavy, this barleywine has really mellowed out, I wish I would not have traded my only other bottle, this stuff will most likely improve even more with age, I look forward to next batch being released in the future, cannot wait to drink again, highly recommended"
"A great beer overall, and I'm very glad I had the chance to try it. It's not something I'd reach for often, however."
"Almost no head at all even with a vigorous pour, only a skim of light tan bubbles. Body is rich brown with some burgundy notes when held to light. Nose has a very nice oaky bourbon character with toffee and carmel malts. Big rich but mellow and smooth on first sip with huge bourbon notes. Carmalized malts give way to dark fruits that sour slightly on the back of the tongue. A dusting of mineral based spices coats the back of the tongue, as well creating a slightly thick mouthfeel. This is a big beer and the bourbon feel almost comes back to bite you as you drink more. About a 10oz. pour is plenty."
"regular Old Numbskull, booze. It was as if the barrel-aging was fighting the original character of the beer with vanilla and booze. The beautiful, bitter hoppiness I have tasted in numbskull was defeated by brute strength. This was a nice complex beer but I feel like the barrel-aging obscures some of the best aspects of an already terrific beer."
"Overall I thought this was a fine example of the aging process, and the metamorphosis that a beer can go through in a barrel aging. Nothing like the original, this came out to be much more an old ale then a hoppy barley wine. Another winner from Alesmith, and now that two out of three of the big barrel age beers from Alesmith are done; I cannot wait to get a hold of the big one!"
"This is a very good beer, but I can't say it's better than the base. In fact, it definitely isn't. I'd say the alcohol content is about 20%, so keep that in mind if you're planning on pounding a few before driving home from the boardwalk."
"Drinkability: In a line-up of various BA Old Numbskull vintages, I greatly favored the 2004 bottling. Powerfully delicious and almost cripplingly good!"
"2005, Bottle 127 of 223. Pours a murky brownish copper, zero head, completely still regardless of how aggressive it is poured. Aroma is a strong worn leather aroma, somewhat salty, some rich tobacco and sweet prunes mixed in as well. Alcohol is evident in the aroma as well. Taste shows some of the leather and salt notes but they are much more mild then in the aroma. Some decent sized bourbony bite following the leather and pruniness, a good amount of vanilla as well as a fairly strong drying woodiness before a bite and warmth of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium, low carbonation keeps it thinner on the tongue, good amount of drying wood and biting alcohol in the finish. An outstanding barleywine, aroma is incredible, the taste is powered quite a bit from the barrel ageing and the alcohol is big as well though never too much. A very good beer, the barleywine characteristics meld perfectly with the barrel ageing in the aroma but are overwhelmed in the taste."
"Overall: I liked this beer, as I knew I would. I think it was worth the $20. I hope AleSmith puts it out again."
"Originally reviewed November 26, 2006. Bottle at O'Briens in San Diego. Rich bourbon cream aroma, resplendent with cherries, raisins, hints of milky chocolate and dark brown rum cooked with bananas. Ruby pour, with orange-yellow fringes. Hardly any head. Flavor is along the lines of the arom, with rich, creamy and almost oily sugar tannins, lots of tawny, pear, raisins and sweet cream vanilla, intended for oaky sugars. Quite light on the carbonation, which is a bummer. ThereÂ’s a sweet tinge of euro-like hops along the backedge, but it makes the old hop presentation moan, as this is more subdued and to my liking. I enjoyed the light oxidization character of this beer, as truer to the plummy, raisin-like sweetness characters of the style, but without carbonation and some warmth noticeable from the barrel, I donÂ’t find this a phenomenal improvement over the straight version."
"I tried to approach this beer as unbiased as possible, keeping my expectations low. I was completely blown away. I enjoyed it more than the BA Speedway. Already working on another trade to get a 2004 bottle. I would highly recommend this beer. Worth trading another prized possession to get one."
"A sipper indeed!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Goes down with ease and not much alcohol burn at all. I'm really glad I had the opportunity to sample this bottle thanks to blitheringidiot, I doubt I'll ever lay eyes on another bottle again. I only wish Alesmith would expand their Barrel Aging a bit, so these bottles wouldn't be so damn hard to find. Worth a try if you can come across it!"
"Bottle # 212. Very aromatic and the wood influence is unmistakable showing hints of oak, vanilla and bourbon along with the malt, which shows a bit of caramel and burnt toffee. The excessive aromatic hops in the regular Old Numbskull has tamed to an almost undetectable level. In the flavor, the hops have again tamed and the wood is clearly evident. Notes of bourbon, oak, caramel and toffee with a touch of vanilla. The body and texture is lacking. This should have been aged in a wine barrel. A bourbon barrel was not the proper vessel for this beer."
"This beer has mostly become a vehicle for the barrel flavors, what flavors that do peak through from the Old Numbskull play a supporting role to mitigate / round-out the oak flavors. I bet you a mixture of half fresh Numbskull and half this beer would be quite tasty, there would still be a big hop and malt presence to balance out the barrel contribution. As this beer stands it does not have enough balance nor complexity to be great. I have never been a fan of barrel aged beers for barrel aged beers sake; I really prefer a bold beer flavor with the supporting role being played by the barrel character. In this case the barrel character plays the lead role, and somewhere down there in the supporting cast there is an aged version of Old Numbskull."
"thanks to BBB63 for this bottle #92. had this on 6/10 at kuhnhenns bash. poured a amber brown, with no head. aroma alcohol, caramel brown sugar and malts and dark fruits. flavor caramel, alcohol (bourbon), malts fruit, woody. this was very good wish I could get more."
"Bottle#124/225Amber and slightly orange like colored body which is cloudy and yielding only a slight scattered film on top. Lots of bourbon in the aroma almost overpowering with vanilla and oak. Malt is buried.Vanilla, bourbon in the flavor.. Body is full and velvety smooth. I think IÂ’d prefer the original much better. The bourbon just overpowers everything else."
"Rubyish orange to medium brown, hazy. Good color really. A light off-white cover tops it all. Big peppermint bourbon aroma. The regular numbskullÂ’s fruit salad (integrated melon, pineapple, cherry, banana, mango etc.) aroma is there, soaked in alcohol gently. Elegant woody riped fruits counter adequately the pencil shavings dryness emanating from those luckily subdued hops. I doubt I would enjoy the blend if hops were as straightforward as in the regular numbskull. Soft liquid caramel, subtle and smooth palate requires lips licking swiftly though itÂ’s not cloying in a bad way. Very low carbonation contributes to the smooth feel. Full bodied, minty, earthy finish. Satisfying sipper from skilled craft brewers. Bourbon is the focus though, but the silky palate carries it well enough that itÂ’s worth seeking even if youÂ’re getting tired of those and I admire the retraint of those hops showing just a slight piney gap. I donÂ’t know if age would really help that one. ItÂ’s pretty well integrated as is, its alcohol components are warming and fitting the sipper state. IÂ’m glad to see I enjoyed it as much as the regular though. The bourbon aging has worked very similarly with this than with speedway. Thanks to Alex for sharing!"
"Thanks to BA AleOha for picking up this one for me."
"Brown/garnet hue with a very faint off-white head. Aromatics are loaded up with an oaky vanilla character. Big alcoholic bite in the flavor, sweet caramel, roasty chocolate, dark dried fruits, cherries, vanilla, honey, oak & bourbon, there is huge complexity in this one. Mouthfeel is full, sticky and syrupy, more carbonated than I was expecting. The alcohol bite in this one is pretty intense, but it is a good sipper... makes you feel all nice and warm as it goes down. Overall, this is excellent."
