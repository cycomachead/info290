4.1,1.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/26/2013. Pours slightly hazy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, orange zest, raisin, plum, fig, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops, dark fruit, and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, raisin, plum, fig, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, pine, floral, grass, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange zest, raisin, plum, fig, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops, dark fruit, and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent American barelywine style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops, dark fruit, and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 21, 2015"

Just a tad bit too boozy for my tastes, especially considering the bit of age it has on it. I'd definitely drink this again, but either with a fresher example or maybe one with another year on it; perhaps right now this vintage is stuck in that 'awkward teenage puberty' phase. :P","TheSixthRing","Feb 13, 2015"

4.35,7.4,3.75,3.75,4.75,4.25,4.5,"OVERALL: What an incredible beer. I love a lot of what victory does and I love a lot of different Barleywines, but this beer ranks right up there near the top of both categories. Prior to this beer the only time I ever had it was when I had a 2009 Oaked variation in 2013, which was incredible. I thought I would be let down a bit by this, relatively fresh bottle, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it exceeding my expectations. The hop character that was all but lost on the 2009 created a fantastic compliment to the complex malt bill. I have two more bottles, which were both going to go in the cellar. After tasting this now, however, it’s drinking too good not to pull at least one more out of the cellar real soon.","StoneTSR","Jul 16, 2014"

Notes of pine with some alcohol sugars. Good flavor, but the alcohol is too forward. I have trouble appreciating beers of this ilk, where both the malt and hop profiles are so grand that they seem to compete for dominance, rather than dance in harmony. Hop bitterness and alcohol longer on the palate. Overall, good, though not my cup of tea (beer).","Huhzubendah","Jul 13, 2014"

This beer had ok drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, rich, a little filing, but the taste did a decent job at holding my attention and I think half the bottle is a good amount for me, i could drink the whole bottle but I would rather split it since I really don't feel the need to have another glass. What I liked the most about this beer was the hop profile and the appearance, I thought they were both pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, I thought it could be smoother and a little less carbonated. I don't think I would buy this beer again, it was nice to try, but I tend to prefer my Barleywines on the sweet and malty side and if I wanted a Barleywine that was on the hoppy side I would rather have a Bigfoot. I would recommend this to people who prefer their Barleywines on the hoppy side. All in all I thought this was a nice hoppy Barleywine, but it isn't my favorite of the style and I think it was just a little rough around the edges. Nice work guys, this was a solid hoppy Barleywine.","StoutHunter","Jan 18, 2014"

Better than the Oak Horizontal, and that was amazing. You really have to watch yourself drinking this. It is so smooth and absent in boozy taste (uncharacteristic for new years) that you really can end up pretty trashed in no time and not think much of it. I think this beer is a solid ""A" on any given year, but with 5 years on it, a clear ""A+"". I can not wait till the new plant is open and they are back to making this as a regular seasonal (They did not make it in 2012).

There was no lacing but some carbonation remained even after 7+ years. The temp was at 58 degrees at my first sip. It was a clear, auburn color. The bottom was full of chunky sediment. It had a bourbony mouthfeel, especially on the back of the throat. However, it didn't taste boozy. Again, my nose could sense the alcohol in the chalice. The overwhelming flavor in my opinion was caramel. I'm sure there might have been more going on to a more discernible palate, but maybe not. I really think the individual flavors likely melted together after near 8 years in my cellar. It was quite a treat.","VanBeer","Nov 17, 2012"

The heat I remember fresh is totally gone and is really smooth. What is also nice is that the sweetness is not thick and cloying...nor is it sugary. It is more of a burnt caramel drizzled over some apple slices with some graham cracker crumbs. This would go perfectly with a slice of cheesecake!

Thick, heavy lacing clings to the side of the glass as the brew recedes down the sides. This is a very rich smelling barley wine. Very malty with forward notes of caramel and barley. The taste is pretty decent. Hoppy, with hints of vanilla and caramel. Tons...I say TONS of booze. This is not a bashful high ABV offering. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth. It's not very effervescent, nor does it leave any kind of bitter aftertaste. The alcohol is again present, but it goes down smoothly enough.

Sweet caramel and honey in the taste, with hints of chocolate, marmalade, dried cherries, acetone, and a bit of noticeable alcohol, which is harder to hide in this range. Chewy, filmy, with a medium-full body. Nicely drinkable for the style.","Rifugium","Sep 02, 2011"

It smells of maple syrup, muted hops, a touch of caramel, and some vanilla. The taste is similar, beginning with sweet caramel and maple syrup, moving through some hops, and finishing with a touch of alcohol, especially as it warmed. Mostly though, the maple, and caramel dominate aside a touch of toffee and vanilla. Mouth is smooth, but quite rich and thick. Overall, a good American barleywine.","eclipse54","Aug 18, 2011"

There is a pleasant aroma of bread crust and berry jam, but a touch of alcohol is hiding in there. Same in the taste, and though the balanced mix of fruit and biscuity malt are nice, there's also a very slight and odd plastic taste.

I wonder if age would mellow out the alcohol? Despite the alcohol, this still has a smooth, creamy mouthfeel that keeps me wanting to sip on it all night. I'm very glad I finally got to try this one. I'd buy it again, and I'm definitely going to let a bottle or 2 sit in the cellar for a few years to see if the alcohol mellows.

The smell of the beer was a booze and sweet sugary combo with a big barley aroma too. The taste is of figs mostly, there may be some yeast and barley in the mix. The finish is a little hoppy and pretty dry. The mouthfeel for this beer is a tad over medium I think and has a balanced feel to it.

4.04,-0.2,5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"O- This might be the most drinkable barleywine I've ever tasted. It's almost dangerous with the ABV it's packing. The thing is that, although it has no offensive tastes, it doesn't quite have the complexity you might be looking for with this style. It has big flavor, but it's sort of a standard sweet maltiness you can find in a lot of beers, so if you're looking for something you can really get into and explore you might be a bit disappointed. If you're looking for something that is pleasant, comfortable, delicious, and packs a punch, this is perfect.

There is nice progression through the malt spectrum, starting light at the beginning of the sip and getting darker towards the end, which makes the malt flavors both complex and interesting. At the end of the sip, the fair herbal hops join the alcohol and clear the palate. This beer's alcohol punch has mellowed with aging, but it could use a bit more time in the cellar.

4.16,2.7,3,4.5,5,4,2.5,"There is a lot of sediment in my glass because of the bottle conditioning. Big pieces of sediment... I don't really like that but I can look past this. The smell is very malty with a fruity smell typical bitter cherry pit because of the alcohol and hops. I have a pretty good comparison of the taste. A couple of weeks ago I bought Sierra Nevada Bigfoot for the first time and it was the 2010 version. I figured out the dating code and it was actually bottled at the very end of 2009 and was saying it was 2010 anyways. I could tell that there used to be a lot of hops but they were muted in with the enormous amount of toasted rich thick malt. This tastes exactly like an aged Sierra Nevada Bigfoot but with more fruity hops instead of piney hops like Sierra Nevada has. As it got warmer this beer got a lot better actually what a difference it made.. the hops came out more as leafy green more bitter hops and the malt became more smoothed out and not so sweet and rich. When it was colder it was a lot more harsh and the alcohol came through a little too much when it was colder. Perfect balance now. I went from rating this a B- to an A- just goes to show you how the temp. can affect this type of style of beer. Still high alcohol content and so I'd probably only drink one of these take a break and move on for the rest of the night. It comes in 6 packs so that's a lot of alcohol for one 6 pack. Real quality beer from Victory but I rather have their Hop Devil, Prima, or Yakima Glory.","thebrood1987","Dec 21, 2010"

A rich malt aroma with an oaky-woodiness touch along w/ some toasted malts; some sweet notes and a bit of a spicy touch of well (I won't say medicinal or anything although I could be picking up some of the alcohol). A pleasant mix of a smooth/creamy beer with a bit of a husky feel to it. Spicy notes and caramel (and other sugary goodness) sweet malt hit me up front to the point of stickiness, then a touch of hop bitterness along with some alcohol hit me for balance; also some toasted malts. The carbonation is good so it kind of strikes the tongue as well. A well-crafted sipper that mostly controls the high aBV but I wish they'd lower it slightly so the the minor hop and fruit flavors could shine.","clayrock81","Dec 17, 2010"

The taste sharpens the fruits and heightens the flowers, creating a decently powerful hop-blast; behind that, the toffee finds a soul mate in the graham crackers and newcomer honey (let's just chalk it up to a stereotypical Mormon situation), and they settle down amidst the hop fields (so many columns...).

Nose is somewhat subdued - some hops character peaks out from behind a malty sweet backbone. Also hints of demerara sugar, and a suggestion of dark fruit and booze. Taste follows nose; however hops bitterness really asserts itself up front, followed by the sweet malty character in the middle and finishing with a lingering, almost harsh and medicinal bitterness between quaffs.

Full-bodied, starts off lighter and then plops with authority onto the palate with no intention of movement. The animal, barnyard thing persists with more pork rind, tobacco and black tea leaf nuances. Certainly trying to impress more via tactile layers of density than sheer sweetness, the butterscotch, flan, toffee, creamed coffee swirl apart via the persistent carbonation. The date, fig, golden raisin, cherry and apricot fruit once more evokes more base concentration than sugariness. You feel the alcohol but there's no real burn. It's grip lasts for some time through the finish, even arguably after most of the flavor has gone.","farrago","Jun 05, 2009"

Hops then come out and bring on a slight alcohol burn that isn't too harsh at all. There is a lot of carbonation in the mouth but it keeps the beer lively. It gets very sweet as it warms.

Not much of a head to speak of and little lacing. Leaves a very thin ring around the glass, but otherwise the glass stays clean. Smells malty sweet with a noticable hop presence. Not a real powerful aroma, but nicely balanced between hops and malt. A slight hint of alcohol in the smell. The taste is a lot stronger than the aroma. Real heavy on the malt, with some fruit and hops coming through. I also taste of a bit of smokiness, and some bitterness rounds out the taste. The alcohol is there in the taste, as it should be in an 11% beer. A medium to heavy mouthfeel that leaves a fair amount of stick in the mouth.

This is a hearty looking brew; amber body with waves of fluctuating orange when held up to the light. Also notable are its reddish hues. The head starts its journey into the glass quite strong but surrenders into a frothy white sheet that shelters the goodness below. A tiny bit of lacing at first, but in the long run it doesn't stick around for long. The smell is pretty floral and biscuity at first but then the astringency of the alcohol reveals itself. The appearance and smell guarantees permission for this beer to enter your sacred tasting chamber where there will be no contrition- it's flavor galore! This beer offers an amicable yet frenzied blend of toffee, caramel and you guessed it- barley! The mouthfeel is quite lively and untiring, but definitely not cringe-worthy.

Delicious flavor: comes out its cage with a blast of sweetness.

4.12,1.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"It almost seems like a rye taste from this. A very hoppy barleywine. This is a tale of two beers: at first, it reminds me of that berry flavored cereal I used to eat (berry flavored Kix?) Berry sweetness like in the mouth, just a little more tempored. Then the hoppiness kicks in. I'm not normally a fan of really hoppy beers, and this is probably the hoppiest barleywine I've had so far (albeit in a Small Sample Size), but that doesn't deter me at all. It doesn't really seem balancing, as the hops clear the sweetness off the palate and then some. But it's quite enjoyable. Mouthfeel is nice and coating, big and creamy, and the aftertaste is some residual sweetness mixed with some nice hops. Drinkability isn't at all hindered by the high ABV, moreso by the bitterness. But it's still drinkable. I'm not sure if this style or the others I have tasted are the norm, but I really can't argue with either method. Big malt bomb sweetness with big hops, works for me!","damienblack","Jan 12, 2009"

Although barleywines are not the most impressive looking of brews, this one was average. The aroma is a bit weak in this beer. It is slightly astringent with just a faint fruit aroma. The hops that I expect in an American Barleywine is lacking in the aroma and flavor. However, I like the taste of this one. Slightly fruity with the hop bitterness in the finish. The alcohol is well masked and just slightly warming lending no flavor to the beer. The body is not that full but has a nice soft, creamy texture. Despite the high ABV, I upped the drinkability score. I think this is the perfect introductory to barleywines. It it was mine, I might have explored this style more. This beer can easily make one horizontal.","morimech","Jan 10, 2009"

The flavor was first rate. The cherry and dark grape fruitiness mixed with the smooth creamy sweet caramel.

The complexity of the flavors is right up there with the best of them, but they're masked and the drinker is distracted by the alcohol burn.

This is a nicely hopped barleywine but not over the top allowing so many other flavors to play a major role. Toffee, brown sugar, sweet candy malt, grapefruit and pine hops and even light traces of darker fruits. Really well done. Warming but the 11% is hidden with very little alcohol sting.

4.2,3.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Sometimes mid-summer demands a mid-winter's drink. Thus the Old Horizontal. The beer pours a rich, thick, copper-amber hue with a fair amount of haze. A firm medium-sized head forms and lessens to 1/4 inch then stays true. Sturdy aromas of melanoidin-rich malts, candied fruits, and noticable citrus/pine hop scent. Flavors are quite a bit more intense than the aromas. The malts dominate the brew with a big sweet boost of toffee and caramel. The beer is very estery with mostly cherry flavors, but berries, figs, plumbs, prunes, dates, and grapes lend a hand as well. Sweet licorice, toasty, meaty flavors round out the flavors without getting into cough-syrup flavors. Hops give a deep herbal note along with moderate citrus and pine flavors that time hasn't completely eroded yet. Textures are richly malty giving a full palate and decadent richness. Moderate numbing and warming gives indications of alcohol strength but these attributes aren't as intense as most. The beer has a long sweet finish decorated with toffee and esters-mostly cherries and figs. The beer is immensely enjoyable, even if a bit too sweet and worty at times.","BEERchitect","Jul 30, 2008"

Taste starts off malty with a fruit backbone, becomes slightly tangy in the middle, only to end with a dry (but still juicy) hop bite. Mouthfeel is the most notable part of this beer in that it is slightly light in body for a Barleywine, but still has plenty of flavor profile, and a lot to offer in complexity.

Mr. Horizontal here is a mighty fine barley wine. Why? Well, glad you asked. Let's start out with appearance. Pours a rick amber topped with a desirable foam dome of an inch thickness. Aromas of subtle dark fruit, taffy(the saltwater kind) and light hops linger around the glass's rim. ON the tongue this gentlemanly sipper is at first a tinge hoppy, he is a young one after all, bottle a mere month or two ago. Once the initial bitterness subsides a rich malt, some might say slightly honeyed and caramelized, squeeks through, rewarding the drinker with additional fruit flavors of fig and raison. Everything finishes solidly and quickly, leaving a pleasant warming note down the throat. Lovely, complex and nuanced. The booze shows through with a youthful boldness, but believe me, I have had some of these from '04, and these suckers just keep getting better if you shut them away in the closet for a spell.

The appearance was absolutely amazing... ruby-red, dark-brown caramel color with a gigantic foamy and frothy head... smell was dominated by a sweet, candied, malty aroma... taste strongly complemented the nose with a deep, rich, thick, extra malty, sugar-laden, caramel, and brown-sugar flavored that was pleasing and warming without being overbearing... excellent stuff from Victory... it was very impressive how the ultra-rich flavor did not overwhelm the palate... certainly my favorite barleywine... really good mouthfeel, and drinkability only took a hit because of the hefty 11% ABV, which, by the way, is hardly detectable... awesome stuff...

The alcohol is a bit astringent, but it works well with the huge sugary sweetness. There is a raisin characteristic that starts to come through as my taste buds assimilate to the bold flavor.

It seems to hit the taste buds better from the pint glass and allows a bit easier drinking, but the snifter really opens up the fantastic smell that this brew offers that is both floral and medicinal with a slight bit of alcohol coming in as well. It is both hoppy and sweet. The appearance is very murky and cloudy with a bit of sediment in the glass. More head retention in the snifter, and virtually none in the pint glass-- in fact not much head to speak of, likely due to the alcohol content. That that appears is a creamy and ""dirty"" offwhite. The hops and carbonation provide a bit of a sting in the mouth. A good choice, but if I had to choose between this and Bigfoot I'd have to go with Bigfoot every time.

The smell is a sweet complex of malts. Caramel, toasted, and fruitiness with a touch of citrus and piney hops. The maltiness however dominated the nose. The taste is also just as complex bringing back the caramel and toasted flavors while balancing it with plum and citrusy flavors from the hops. The sweet malts dominate without being cloying or unbalanced. The hops still play a significant roll providing mild citrus and pine flavors while putting this one in perfect balance. The warmth from the alcohol also plays nicely into this one. This full bodied beer with smooth carbonation drinks nicely. An interesting take on the American barleywine style. This one is done quite well. It allows the malt to play the lead role while still letting the hops play a significant part.

The taste is a bit too strong for my liking, with too much alcohol just hanging out. This is a very full bodied, syrupy, almost liquour tasting barley wine that is compromised by just too much alcohol. There are candied sugars present, enough hops to keep it interesting, but it is the predominant alcohol that does this beer in. There is some underlying sweetness due to the candied sugars, but its that alcohol that over powers all the complexity that this beer strives for.

Early light roasted malty goodness gets overrun by some crazy strong spicy dried fruit and malt. Starts with mild hoppiness in the aftertaste which sits on your tongue, but that increases into a fairly bittersweet zone as the beer warms. Light alcohol flavors in the middle as well (hard to completely mask 11%, although Victory does a pretty damn good job here). Feel is just on the edge of syrupy, but never quite goes overboard.

Minimal head, fine carbonation, I'd say mostly dark amber in color with some reddish-brown undertones. The smell and the taste I feel are what really put Old Horizontal above other barleywines I've had. Strong indeed when it comes to alcohol content, but not overpowering and blends well with the flavor of the beer. Definitely a good slow-sipping beer. Mouthfeel is not super-smooth (I wonder what draft is like??) but does not distract too much either. Main competitors in my area (Pennsylvania) would be the two Weyerbacher barleywines--Blithering Idiot and it's pricier aged cousin Insanity.

More complexity, though subtle, is found here than in my fresher sample. Smooth, soft mouthfeel. Well rounded malts on the tounge, just a touch of ethanol, and an aged hop flavor.

The beer's body is a murky, barely translucent amber with significant red highlights. The nose is sweet, peppery, perhaps even having some peppermint. There's also a distinct caramel note. The bouquet is finished by a bit of acid, and lots of alcohol. I don't notice any distinct hop scents. The taste is remarkably mild, after the aroma. It has a bit of sweetness to it, and definite, but not extreme, alcohol flavors. A real disappointment here. It's not bad at all - there's just so little to it.

Mouthfeel is very thick First barleywine I've had in a while. Not sure when Victory releases theirs but this may be a 2005 or an early 2006 depending on release, it has aged nicely.

The taste is amazingly cohesive for such a large beer. Dangerously smooth with a creamy body. The candied fruits make up most of the body, with toasted husks and alcohol making up the remainder. Its clear that this beer has spent some time the fermentor, (or secondary, or tertiary) because of the mellowness of the alcohol taste.

The smell is very inviting - hops and citrus and just strong enough. The taste is exceptional. An initial blast of hops and grapefruit/citrus taste followed by a mild malty finish. The rough taste that a fresh Bigfoot presents can turn off the typical BMC guy. This beer presents the same initial sensation but is balanced enough for a non-hophead to enjoy as well.

Definitely a sipper, as this would be perfect on a cold winter night or what the hell, an 85 degree night in June. Even after sitting for almost 3 years, the alcohol is very present in the taste profile, which I thought would have mellowed a bit. Not a bad thing, considering its 11 % abv but still surprising nonetheless. I do think the cellaring mellowed some of the hoppiness that is usually present in a barleywine.

Once in the glass, bready, malty notes came to my nose as well as some sweet caramel. Those scents mingle with the aforementioned alcoholic spicy nose. Nice sweet nose, but I like a bit more hop presence in my barleywines. Flavor is spot on for a barleywine, but on the sweet side of things. Big, uber-satisfying mouthfeel engulfs my taste buds with sweet boozy enjoyment. Sweet caramel and toasted malts come up early and stay throughout, mingling with a fair amount of spice. Some ripe fruit is apparent as well, lending some additional sweetness and possibly a hint of acidity. Hops are spirited in their spicy attack and work well with the huge malts. Aftertaste is warm and boozey. Quite a good brew to sip on during those colder nights of the year.","BeerFink","May 04, 2006"

Mouthfeel -full, smooth, moderate carbonation, good hop oil coating, and the alcohol burn. Drinkabilty- this is a very good, but very rich ale. Alcohol taste diminshes appeal.

Bitterness and sweetness play against each other well, letting caramel and orange hop character shine. Alcohol is present throughout and lingers in the finish, but is never harsh or aggressive. Light fruit as well. Full bodied, slightly creamy texture with medium/low carbonation that's well integrated. Some dryness. This is a sipper, but still a very easy drinking barleywine.

Essences of roasted-honeyed oranges, lemon balm and crème brule soar from the glass accompanied by a mellow piney-hop character peeking out from the well aged albeit fresh fruitopic mélange. The flavors are rich and well endowed, with flavors of blood orange and citrus rind; well hopped with a buckwheat honey finish that coats the mouth from this thick & viscous nectar. Moderately to quite bitter, this brew is very flavor forward and evolved. The flavors and bitterness last for several minutes. Drinkability is very good for a brew of such weight and alcohol, which incidentally is totally repressed beneath the expansive flavors, that demand the stage and spotlight.

4.23,4.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottled on Jan 06 01. OMG, has it really been five years! Hissed when opened, not what I was expecting from a barley wine, especially one this old. Pours an eager 1.5 finger light brown head over a particulated copper-brownish liquid. Nuts, I thought I'd kept the sediment in the bottle. Smelled richly malt sweet during the pour, let's see what it is to the nose. Piney hops and sharp caramel carried on a hint of alcohol. Bigfoot-ish, but much subtler on the rough grassy hop edges. The head is now a thin layer over the top. Tastes...uhm...moderate. Enjoyable, but not killer in any particular dimension. Sweet start with caramel and some piney citrus. In comes a tamed alchol with a late wet sweet that jumps in. Woody finish that leaves the mouth dry. Aftertaste has a bit of teasing alcohol burn and caramel that's been browned a hair too long on the stove. The mouthfeel is silky delightful. Absolutely wonderful, I wish the finish weren't so dry, because it wipes away the feel and flavor when I want it to last. Now nearing the end of my wonderful experience I taste oranges, a touch of brown sugar, a little bit buttery, and a little bit yeasty. Oh, my belly feels warm. Must be some alcohol in this one, but damn, over the years it's found a way to hide itself well. Wow, this beer is wonderful. What seemed initially as a ho-hum experience has become a real bounty of flavor and mouthfeel. I love it. There is more here than I can get a handle on, subtle, but complex. Okay, now, I'm more of a malty fan so I see this beer as a solid answer to the disappointment of Bigfoot. It's like a Bigfoot in which most of that nasty grassy hop edge has been removed and the malt sweet emphasized. The hop flavor and intensity mixes with the alcohol in a similar way, however, the edgy hop rough is cut to a minimum. Wonderful. Body is md, but the liquid hangs together giving a thicker impression. I loved it...and I have two bottles left in my cellar.","mentor","Mar 23, 2006"

Each sip gives a burst of sweetness followed by a drying bitterness and then finishes with a slight alchol bite. At 11% that is no surpise. Drinkability suffers for me because this is a one and done beer for me. It is just so big that i couldn't imagine having more than one in a sitting.

Huge and creamy mouthfeel with a light, stinging sensation around the tongue and gums. Drinkability? On a cold November night with 6-8"" of the cold white stuff laying around and some nice aged cheddar to pair it with, this is certainly drinkable. Bigfoot is still my ""regular"" barleywine choice, and for high ABV decadence, I'd more often than not choose Weyerbacher's Insanity...but this is a top-notch barleywine nevertheless.

4.32,6.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12 oz bottle bottled on 11/18/03, poured into a snifter. Pours a murkey coppery brown with a thin off-white head that quickly fades to a thin ring. Aroma is big juicy pine hops over sweet caramel malt, just a bit of fruity berries mixed in, very nice. Taste starts out very sweet, caramel, candi sugar, prune juice. A slight roasted malt lingers in the background, and then a flavorful burst of flowery and piney hops hit the finish, leaving just the slightest lingering bitterness. Alcohol only barely detectable on the very end of the sip. Tastes really blend together well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly slick mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable barleywine, hiding it's alcohol well yet flavorful enough to make it an enjoyable sipper.","cubedbee","Oct 03, 2005"
4.2,3.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Deep ruby amber in color with a small off white head. Smells of toffee, caramel and flowery esters. Malt forward nose but plenty of hop bite. Toffee and candied fruit, almost molasses-cookie-like flavor, but not cloying at all. Hops are strongly present but not as forward as the interesting candy malt flavors- they compliment them and give them staying power. Long fruity hoppy finish with a lingering sting and subtle caramel sweetness. Really drinkable for a barley wine and not too sweet or cloying. Alcohol is not readily apparent, especially for the 11% abv. Dangerous.","bcm119","Oct 02, 2005"

Millions of practically microscopic carbonation bubbles circle and stream up the sides of the glass through the beautiful burgundy body of the beer into the sticky, everlasting grain-colored head. This is truly a sight to see, and when I say everlasting this head hangs around for freakin ever. The nose is sweet, grainy and resinous at the same time. My nose picks up pine, robust grapefruit and rind, and sweet sticky toffee along-side a nice toasty-nuttiness that I imagine is from the yeast. Caramelly sweet up front, the beer slides stickily back and rattles my palate with blistering Chinook bitterness and spicy pine, surprisingly the nutty yeast flavors actually register against this torrent of hops. The malt seems to be lightened up a bit by alcohol in the finish although the alcohol taste blends stealthily into the mix. Faint mineral twang in the aftertaste is a bit annoying. The mouthfeel on this beer is practically perfect, slightly sticky with a slight creamy texture added by the everlasting head. A great beer, seems to be lacking slightly on complexity though.","FormatKid","Feb 17, 2005"

The brew pours to a crystal clear mild ruby color with a nice sized light tan/darker off white head. The lacing is very good as the head has great retention. This brew is heavy on the caramel like malt and hop characteristics, citrus. The first thing that I notice about this brew is the malt; a caramel flavor is most prevalent. Also heavy hop flavors around the mid to end that are not over baring (maybe it is but I have grown accustomed to heavier hop tastes) like I thought they would be, they are there but at a moderate level. Also I was expecting more of a alcohol taste but it also seems to be quite tame for the 11% it has.

As it warms, smells of vanilla, maple syrup and buttery pancakes are revealed. Taste is amazingly balanced and never harsh like some barleywines, even fresh. A monstrous caramel malt flavor, candy-like fruit with a smooth, escalating bitter finish that lingers but never overpowers the palate. Like Hop Devil on steroids. Mouth is big, thick and full with plenty of prickly carbonation. The ABV is big but barely noticeable, until you're finished your glass (obviously). No heat here. Amazing.

Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle into a goblet, the body was hazy copper, with a tan head that was short lived. The lacing was very good. The aroma was very strong maple syrup and raisins and could be sensed from the bottle before pouring in the glass. There was also a strong pine straw like hop presence and perfumey alcohol. The taste was vinous, raisin laden, spicy, bitter, and contained strong oxidative notes. While complex and interesting, the intensity was a few notches short of the super hopped up West Coast style Barleywines. The alcohol was more of a slow burn, than an intense one. The mouthfeel was a bit thinner than anticipated. A soothing beer to calm your jitters before bedtime, for sure.","rajendra82","Oct 21, 2004"

4.03,-0.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Bottled on Jan 23, 2004 this barleywine poured a clear, rich red color with a light tan head that slowly subsides to a thin fil but leaves ample lace as it is reduced in quantity. Very nice color deviates from the average baleywine as it is much lighter than most examples. Exceptional head retention especially for the level of alcohol. Aroma is full of hops as you pour but smelling the glass gives off a sweet very alcoholic maltiness with a little toasted breadiness. No bottle conditioning means that this ale can pour all the way to the bottom of the bottle but also that it can't mature as it ages although it could very well become mellow and oxidated. Once again i am presented with a barleywine that has an exquisite balance of flavors but i do find that it is a little on the bland side. It dosen't offend but it dosen't have a strong flavor of much anything either. Very sublte initial bitterness is soon overlapped by a lighter that normal malt sweetness. The flavors then segue into a smooth lingering bitterness that lasts long enough to be noticed but then fades away. There are no faults with this ale in terms of brewing technique but i would have preferred it to be bottle conditioned. The body is very chewy and it has a nice viscosity. Smooth and drinkable this ale is a welcome addition to the American Barleywines.","RenoZymurgist","Aug 08, 2004"

Kind of vegetal with a touch of spicyness, but without any of the sharp fresh hop flavors usually found in this beer.

The fresh hop notes are a big part of the charm of this beer and I fear that would be lost with excessive aging ( more than a year). The smoothness and drinkability must be seen as positive attributes as we do not always want to wait 2-5 years to drink our barley wines.

Thick on the palate, chewy malts dominate along with some fruity hops to finish it. The alcohol character doesn't reveal an 11% ABV to me. It's well hidden I think. I enjoy the crisp hoppy finish; it doesn't conquer the thick maltiness that coats the palate, but leaves a good enough impression to garner another sip soon after.

Great flavor balance with a complex layer of hops making for an obvious bitterness that is never too much. The malt profile is also there and very balancing lending this an outstanding silky medium body to bring up all those malt subtleties.

The flavor reflected the smell, delicate candy-like roasted malts, balanced with a hop bitter finish, which I thought could have been more emphasized. The sweetness remains in the finish where there should be that hoppy bitter hit that usually conquers the palate over the sweetness. An interesting take none-the-less. The barleywine had a pleasing mouthfeel, and the drinkabilty was good for a barleywine, even if on the sweet side.

It is however a little sweet for my taste, but good non the less. Also not very much hop taste going on, but there was something very reminiscent of Storm King stout in there. A bit of a burned fruit flavor perhaps. Mouthfeel was ok, I felt it was a bit syrup like. But I may have been imaging it due to the sweetness. Drinkability was good. If I was drinking this as a desert beer, I could see myself having 2 or more. The only thing stopping me is the high abv. A nice offering from Victory, I'll certainly give it another try when next years batch comes around.","Ieatlambfries","Jan 13, 2004"
4.6,13.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Pours perfectly wonderful reddish copper in color with a light tan head that perfectly fills the glass to the rim - carbonation rising to the surface. The head dissipates moderately slowly to a thick layer of lace that hugs the sides of the glass for a long time. The lace eventually becomes a thin scattering on top. BIG hit of aroma right out of the bottle wonderful. Dark fruits, caramel malts, sweet molasses, slight alcohol notes. What a great barley wine! SO SO smooth with lots of malt in the start along with caramel and fruity sweetness. Never becomes too sweet however. Great hop finish. Lots of grapefruit and some slight roasted notes. Long aftertaste that just keeps reminding you how great this brew is. Incredibly well balanced and infinitely drinkable barley wine. While others are fairly harsh at this young of an age, this brew is begging to be enjoyed NOW. Dont know how Ill hold on to any of these long enough to put any age on them.","byrd","Jan 12, 2004"

The smell was alcohol, sweet dark fruits, malt and a little hop presence. The taste was very sweet but not cloying, a strong full presence that warmed every inch but was ""not filling ---- tastes great!"" The alcohol was slighlty noticeable but actually helped to cut through some of the sweetness. This is my first Barleywine and I was floored. Two a night is what the Doctor ordered. I think this is very drinkable for the style, but no need to drink more than... 3 (on a weeknight). This case barely made it into my house before the first taste, so I'm intent on cellaring the last 12 until next year. I saved a few to drink out of my Goblet that I ordered instead of a pint glass -- I really want to agitate this brew to get the full effect.

Nice caramel appearance, but the head didn't last too long. Piney smell with some malty sweetness. Taste was well rounded, malty, then hoppy, but balanced between the two. Mouthfeel had a slickness that was well done...I was expecting a dryer feel. Ended with a nice hoppy, alcohol presence. Very drinkable for such a high abv, altough it will definitely take me some time to finish it.

A big wallop of alcoholic fume is released upon opening. The scent of sweet malt and hops follow and hang around for awhile. The full malt body has plenty of sweet caramel and tastes of fresh bread. Grapefruit bitterness and a lemon-lime sourless mix together nicely. Slightly peppery spices add a nice complexity to this flavorful brew. Without a doubt, the big upfront warming alcohol is the most noticeable part of this BIG brew. But, unlike some other highly alcoholic barley wines, these ingredients meld well together. The alcohol is an obvious result of the brewing process and not at all obtrusive and overwhelming.","BeerResearcher","Dec 29, 2003"

The glass was a 10 ouncer that was sufficient given the 11% alcohol content. This is a wonderfully aromatic beer, which smells grainy with a hint of herbs that I think include clove and maybe coriander. The taste is a strong, lightly carbonated nectar of grains and fruit that kind of goes off when it hits the taste buds. It is rich and full-bodied, a real treat for the mouth.

The flavor is lightly sweet, quite a malty beer at this point, though there is a hint of the hop flavor left in the beer.

4.55,12.3,4.5,4.5,5,4,4,"This beer pours a conducive glowing amber with a screen of hazy brown of over it, while the body appears with a cream toned very thin head that is starting to leave a trickled collar of lace apon my glass. The first thing that attacks my senses when I crack the bottle is the complex fragrance of the floral hop tones. Victory forms a nicely hopped malt treat for relaxation, and this one is doing just that. I was having some trouble falling asleep, so I decided to crack my bottle of Old Horizontal hopefully it will put me down in a few. Back to this amazing offering from Downington, the malt richness soothes the body and mind just by taking a few whiffs of this well done handcrafted beauty. Thick and chewy rolling herds of malt graze upon my tongue, sending a backlash of gentle hop bitterness forming a smokey haze on the plains of my palate. Full notes of barley malt sweetness cyclone around clashing with bitter sweet tones of caramel, fig, and deep brandy tones making this one completely enjoyable soothing beer that is helping me fade away into this sweet night. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy with a full syrup like appeal to it, wonderful enduring beer that shall live on forever. I could drink one of these every night in front of a burning fire right before bed time to put me into an ecstasy of slumbering peacefulness. A bit challenging to my palate to enjoy in number, but it's not mant to be consumed in quantity. I love the name, the beer, and the brewery!!!","WVbeergeek","Mar 09, 2003"
4.3,6.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Deep mahogany brew with a small tan head that disappears quickly. Hugely sweet malty nose, caramel and molasses. The hops don't have so much presence in the nose, but they are definitely noticeable in the background. A little alcohol presence gives a slight nostril burn. As for the taste, it's big on the malt too. Huge caramel sweetness throughout. Hops become more noticeable as you drink more, in a leafy, earthy character. Still not as noticeable as they are in other barleywines though, unfortunately. Bitterness floats around nonchalantly. Alcohol warms thoroughly. A pretty good barleywine, but i wish it was more complex and hoppy. It could benefit from cellaring for the complexity, I'm sure. Might take away some of the harshness as well. Make sure you drink it at room temperature so all of the flavors will come out. Still very enjoyable as is. Thanks again to francisweizen for another taste of Victory!","hyuga","Mar 06, 2003"

The head was little not like from the tap, the color was a beige/light brown color, and there was a slight lace left behind as well. The smells that filled my glass were of cherries, roasted malt, dark fruits, some slight sour tones and a hint of ash as it warmed. The taste was filled through out with tones of alcohol. It was thick in the mouth but very pleasant. Flavors of alcohol, roasted malts, floral hops, citrus fruits and big dark fruits and spices as well. It had a slight bite to it but it was not overbearing. This is a big beer that has many great qualities from sharp to smooth. A good beer that gets better as the temperature rises.

It is a creamy medium bodied brew that finishes with a dry hop bitterness. Old Horizontal is a different barleywine IMO, but good nonetheless.

The alcohol was present though not overbearing. The taste started sweet at first, though not extremely complex, and ended on the back of the tongue with some nutty bitterness.

Very smooth from both sugariness and fine carbonation. Long finish lingers from minutes after each sip.

From the start to finish, lightly sweet, with the top rich and full in its mouth feel, the finish majestically hopped and the carbonation moderate, the aftertaste somewhat alcohol bitter and quite dry.

I have had Barley Wines before as categorized by this site, but primarily those with a lower ABV (i.e. Fuller's Vintage Ale, Young's Old Nick, Anchor Old Foghorn, and Thomas Hardy's (a class unto itself); and I would probably create a sub-category for the higher ABV brews. In any event, this beer was a revelation. So far, in a class by itself. The perfect beer to stand up with a strong cigar, Christmas pudding, chocolate dessert, or a platter of Stilton or Shropshire Blue. Makes me want to sit by the fire with a cigar, looking at the lake, reading Thackeray; or better yet stretched out on the sofa with someone special!","Dantes","Dec 24, 2002"

Old Horizontal was none of the above. Yes, you can tell this is not a beer to be taken likely, but it is not shocking. The color was golden red with an overall clear appearance. The smell was of berries and citrus. The taste was sweet and complex, with more berry and some caramel-like tastes. Frankly, I was expecting a beer that would be hard to get down, but this wasn't (maybe because I had a World Wide Stout the night before). It was smooth and I really didn't think twice about drinking this beer as compared to others.","doho95fu","Dec 21, 2002"

The hoppiness was more pronounced, and I found it to be quite enjoyable. I will confess that I drank it this time from a wide wine glass. I don't know why it struck me as being so sweet the first time, but it's really good on the second try. I'd go so far as to say delicious. Very little head, very little carbonation, but the color is a beautiful ruby red. This is quite a complex brew, and I would guess it would mellow and age quite nicely over time. Perhaps it tasted so sweet the first time because I had an Arrogant Bastard prior to tasting this. So I stand corrected, this is actually quite a nice brew.","LarryV","Dec 14, 2002"

On the palate more of the same, probably overly sweet a bit, caramel malt, light chocolate tones, toasty, mild hop presence, alcohol warms you up and makes itself know more towards the finish.

4.23,4.4,4.5,4,4.5,5,3.5,"This is a reddish colored beer with amber highlights. It pours with a thin tan head that quickly dissipates. The remaining ring of foam leaves a very fine lace that gradually slides back down the glass to join the beer. The aroma is of cherries, alcohol, and a hint of apple. Very appetizing. The first sip presents a very thick feeling beer with sweet cheery flavors mingled with some hop bitterness and citrus flavors. The alcohol is very apparent in this young beer. After a few sips, some chocolate flavors become apparent, reminding me of chocolate covered cherries. The sweetness dominates this beer, and it is definitely a sipping beer. There are actually many flavors that I just cannot identify solidly. Really a wonderful experience. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth. An exceptional treat for the tongue. This is not what I would call a drinking beer, but a sipping beer. As such it does well, but the sweetness and alcohol diminish the drinkability.

This brew has no head, and it is cloyingly sweet (Just two months ago I had no idea what the hell ""cloyingly"" even meant. Thanks Beer Advocate! Who says drinking isn't educational!). Anyway, it tastes like honey, caramel and molasses, with a slight but noticeable alcohol flavor.

Nutty, caramel aromas mixed in with fruity hop aromas. Thick mouthfeel and brown sugar like sweetness. Caramel, butterscotch, and toasted malt flavors mingle to rally against fruity hop flavors. Bitterness rides out along with residual sweetness. Very easy to sup and the 11% alc. content is barely noticeable making this a dangerously drinkable barley wine.

4.52,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Garnet in hue and brillantly clear, w/ the initially thick light tan head readily receding into a thin glass coating ring. A snap of caramel malt sweetness in aroma immediately yields to a well rounded, orange - like (but not grapefruity) citrusy hop nose, rich buttery toffee, and fruity esters reminescent of prune.  A waft of heaty, but pleasant ethanol rounds the aroma out, and is a harbinger of a potent brew.  Molasses sweetness hits the palate initially, then is quickly offset by assertive, but clean hop bitterness which in turn fades.. Mellow diacetyl then surfaces along with toasty Munich notes, while honey notes add depth to the malt sweetness. Hop flavor is nearly lost amongst the sweetish malt, but citrus manages to persist.  Moderately bodied, w/ a smooth, agreeable mouthfeel that helps lend dangerous drinkability.  Finishes with lingering biscuit notes and hop bitters...  Old Horizontal is a delicious barleywine.

There is a noticeable alcohol in the finish, followed by an agressive hop dryness. The hop flavor lingers.
