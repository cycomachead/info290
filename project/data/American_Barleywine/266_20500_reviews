"Nice fruity aroma when opened.  Mine said 2013 on the label.  Overall pretty good and solid barleywine for the price."
"I would buy this again."
""
""
"Real solid beer."
"Feel: Pretty well balanced. There is a viscous thickness associated with the malty sweetness, but it doesn't linger too much on the finish. Very drinkable for 11%. Adequately carbonated [4.25]"

"3.45/5: Fairly rudimentary for a barleywine, but at least it's well balanced"
""
"It's decent, and certainly a strong beer, but both the malt and hop profiles seem to be lacking some depth and definition, resulting in flavors that are quick lived and fall flat. As with many of the reviewers, we agree that this one is too boozy."
""
""
"Overall - I think this beer is better than its rating. It reminds me of a cellared Bigfoot Barleywine from SN. The malt has had some time to cut through all the hop bitterness, but that bitter hop flavor can still be found if you let the brew linger on your tongue for a split second. I am going to cellar some of these to see how the hop and malt profiles play out."

"It's got a nice alcohol heat but the rest of the flavor is muddled."

"A gentleman's beer, dark, handsome, intelligent, confident something I can be proud to drink. This is a fantastic beer, it really improved my attitude after a long day at the office. Even if you've never had or usually don't enjoy this style, I highly suggest to pick it up."
"The beer is slightly murky with a chestnut brown body and a half inch of tan head. Aromas include toffee, dates, booze, malt, perhaps prunes or raisins. Thick body with a mild but present sweetness. Big flavor with malt complexity, a touch of brown sugar. A nice beer to sip and savor."
"Overall - Pretty solid stuff. The booze is well hidden and there is a nice balance of sweet and bitter. Maybe a little thin for a barleywine, but lots of great flavours. A wood aged version of this would be excellent I'm sure."

"Overall: Without having it fresh, this seems like a good one to site on so it can cool. Not spectacular, but not bad. At less than 3 bucks and 11% ABV it is work a try, but I personally wouldn't buy it again. Admittedly, this is my favorite of the two barleywine styles."

"O: A solid barleywine. I really enjoyed this one. Worth checking out, for sure."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad brew but better barleywines out there. Lacks complexity, this is more the ""looking for a buzz"" brew. Worth tasting I don't think I would keep it. Salud!"
""
"O: A really good barleywine, from a brewery I don't know much about."
"Smell is sweet not too much fragrance, fruity fig, and black cherry nose. Apprearance is dark cherry-wood, minimal head, gone in 2 seconds, even after vigrois pour, expected from a 11%abv'r. No lacing, not too resinous, drinking smooth. Taste is sweet malt, black cherry, sweet caramel, finishes with a good hop profile( possibly simcoe, cluster).mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with a slight crips bite on the end. Overall a decent barleywine that would even better paired with duck, pate, dry cheeses such as beemster, or an aged white or yellow chedder..."
"Served from a bottle chilled into a beer tulip. Relatively sparse, tan colored head, with a dark, dark brown color. Aroma of malt, scorched caramel, and alcohol. Taste is an initial very strong malt, a tad overwhelming, which gives way to light, lingering hoppiness, caramel, and toasted grain. Good balance of sweet and bitter. Sweetness fades and bitter remains for 30 seconds to a minute, with a pleasant mouthfeel. Overall very nice. Not spectacular, but definitely worth a taste."
"overall - would be much better if the taste lived up to the smell."

"A wintry powerful brew that is a little off-putting at first, and a little hot at the end, but it's an interesting variation on Barleywines. Better than most of the Mad River stuff, in my opinion. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego."
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this beer. It's a hoppy barley wine that makes for a nice winter warmer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall I thought this was pretty good, better than the BA scores suggest. Really nice aroma, maybe a little on the hot side, but not overwhelming."
""
"O: Huh, very unusual barleywine. A bit unnecessarily harsh and almost no aroma. Not a bad barleywine, just unusual flavors and not quite right. It was okay, I drank all of it but it was kind of a mess if I'm honest."
""
""
""
" The taste is slightly caramel up front with a toasted and woody malt flavor with some light spice and dried fruit presence in the yeast profile. The taste has a mild hop accent which contributes to the bitterness in the taste which balances the malt sweetness well, but it also propels the alcohol in the taste forward on the palate adding to the perceived spiciness and warming accent in the semi-dry finish. The overall Impression is that this is a cellar worthy barleywine. I consider it pretty drinkable for the style since it is not intensely sweet, but it does have a strong alcohol influence which detracts slighlty."
""
"Overall, this has been aged between 2 and 3 years, and could stand up for years to come. The alcohol is somewhat overpowering the flavors of the malts, but the hops are still prominent."
""
"I tasted a caramel syrupy flavor mixed with hints of dark fruit, molasses and malt. With that said, you would think this is a sticky beer however it has a very smooth finish that allows you down it quite easily. I would love to get my hands on this again."
""
""
"O: This is a barley wine that was not very good when it was younger, but improved a bit with a little aging. Still doesn't blow your socks off but it has a relatively mild flavor which isn't offensive."
""
"I like it and it drinks good. However, i would not buy it again just because of its price."
""
"Overall, it's an ok barley wine but not well balanced - too sweet with lots of harsh bitter alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"This is a really nice, balanced barleywine. It's incredibly malty and sweet, but the hops are also intense and balance the flavor. The ABV is well hidden adding only some warmth to the mouthfeel. For 11% this is dangerously drinkable. I really enjoyed this one. I will definitely pick it up again."
"O - Overall, just an average barleywine. This is a well aged bottle showing a fair amount of oxidation. The age is obviously showing a bit here and really isn't doing this much service. Better fresh?...I don't know, but as this is just an average barleywine. I wouldn't turn it away, but not anywhere near the top end of the range for this style."
""
""
""
"O: Not my favorite American style barley wine. The aroma is really nice, but something in the flavor is lacking a bit. Not a whole"
""
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty good barleywine, though different than most because it has a ton of chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is very good with nice caramel as well, and no real alcohol heat. Would like to have it again sometime."
"O: Its a pretty decent aged barleywine, and I'm kind of surprised more fans of the English (malt-forward) style don't like this one. I prefer these strong beers with more of a hop presence."
""
""
""
""
"O- Maybe this needs some age to mellow out the alcohol and bring out some complexity. However, this would work well with a rich dessert like cheese cake or tiramisu."
""
""
"Drink- A nice barleywine but nothing too fancy or overwhelming. A solid above average and on the border of being great. Id have again or just age a couple if I find more."
"Toffee, brown sugar, and cinnamon rolls on the nose. A thick, slick liquid swells in your mouth with the first pull. A lot of sweet stuff in there. Not enough alcohol flavor or warmth to account for the 11% ABV. There is a bit of tartness that cuts the sweet explosion. The tartness, mind you, is the same you'd get from a sweet cherry sucker and not from an unripe banana or a grapefruit. My only criticism is that it finishes a little too quickly. Once it does finish, there's a bit of bitter alcohol that remains on the tongue. Not bad though."
"This is a fine sipping beer that unfolds with a progressive story suitable for conversation or a meal, but likely best late at night. This sample aged two years in the cellar."
"Was there some real age on this bottle to make it less hoppy and thus more pleasant? I don't know. I do know that I want to get some more and open my mind to more American barleywines. This was a real pleasant surprise and I'm glad I found it."
"12oz bottle that I picked up for $2.50, should have bought a whole four pack. I was a little hesitant given the high ABV but I love barleywine so why not tick a new one? Ruby red color, decent head at first but then it was only a memory. Initial aroma of fruit, malts, barleywine. First taste was cherry cough syrup but once I let it warm up it really came alive. Good flavors of fruit, brown sugar, barleywine, not really even a hint of hops which is fine. This is pretty good stuff, I might have to buy a four pack to age a year just to see how it does."

"O: An excellent barleywine. One of the first 'real' beers I ever tasted, and one that has only improved with time. Highly recommended, if a bit on the sweet side. More or less well-balanced."
"Plenty of toffee and caramel in the nose, with light grape, raisin and baked apple notes. I'm not sure when this was bottled, but even if it was the last day of 2010, there's still a surprisingly potent dose of bitterness in this stuff. Earthy and burnt flavors join in to provide a counterpoint to the sweetness. The fruitiness isn't as pronounced as I'd guessed it would be, and something's a little lacking here. Instead of a coating, lingering warm feel, it almost finishes clean and a tad on the thin side. This could be quite nice with a few tweaks, I reckon."
"OVERALL: The Barleycorn certainly improves with some warmth and air. It was served to me at about 45 degrees, but after sitting for a bit, it really showed itself off for what it is, a nice, solid Barleywine."
""
"O: This beer is much more than admirable – it’s fantastic. What a great introduction to Mad River. Glad to have multiple different bottles in the fridge!"
""
"O: maybe I'm a barleywine guy - third tonight - started with the Uinta Anniversary Barleywine, then tried a Harpoon Leviathan Barleywine, and now this. There is no standout in this trio - they are all excellent and I would drink them all again and again - but noticed that the John Barleycorn was the sweetest of the 3, but unfortunately, as stated, it was also allowed to warm to room temp before beginning to drink, so this may have had an impact on sweetness and taste. My ""3-strong-beers-in"" perspective: if you like or are curious about this style of beer, you have nothing to lose by trying any or all of these beers. Clearly, Mad River has made an excellent beer, and I can easily recommend it."
""
"O: This is surprisingly mediocre. I say surprisingly because the barrel-aged version was truly outstanding (I even made a second trip out to Beer Revolution to grab another glass). It was worth trying, but I don't think I'll pick it up again."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red red amber with ruby undertones. Thin layer of foam, but what is there is persistent. Muted aroma of grassy and slight caramel malt. Dry and caramel malt, molasses with some nut elements. Medium, creamy bodied. This is still a quite unique flavored barleywine. This ""2009 cellar reserve"" bottle is not as dominated by the dry grass malty flavor of the last bottle I tried, but that element is still present. The flavor is somewhat one dimensional, but still intriguing. A somewhat eccentric take on a barleywine and worth sampling every year or so."
""
"Pours a caramel color with little head, slightly hazy, sticky looking liquid. Aroma of vanilla, caramel, sugar, and alcohol. Smells like a barleywine of moderate intensity. In the taste, sweet toffee, caramel, maple syrup, dates, brown sugar and vanilla. Some wood flavor, possibly from the hops, and lots of sweetness and fruityness. Alcohol is present but has mellowed over time. Mouthfeel is that of a thick medium bodied, syrupy, decently carbonated brew. Overall, a nice sipper that really has gotten better with age."
"Very nice, great to savor, wish I bought more then just the one bottle..."
""
""
"I expected a touch more hop character in the aroma, but a pretty good beer overall. It's a bit hot, but wouldn't age it too long or the hop flavor could be lost, resulting in an overly sweet brew."
"O- aside from the astringency, this was a decent beer. Take that away, and this would be a good beer. I received this in a trade. I can't say that I would ever buy it because there are just too many better barleywines out there."
"Aroma of caramel, toffee, dark fruit, ABV, malt. Taste sweet caramel malt, spices, dark fruits, brown sugar, ABV, bitter finish."
"O: The beer definitely tastes strong, but some of the alcohol is masked from the taste. It’s a good beer so slowly sip and savor on a cold winter night."
""
""
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a brownish orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, spices, earth, and subtle alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, subtle alcohol, and caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. There was nothing on this one that really made it stand out from other Barleywines I have tasted in the past. All of the usual Barleywine flavors were present, but it just wasn’t complex enough to put this one into another league for me. Worth trying if you get the chance or are a big fan of Barleywines."
"Are all barley wines this good? I don't think so,"
""
"Bottle. 2010 vintage. Pours a dark copper color with a light tan head that collars around the glass. Sweet aroma of caramel, slight toffee, vanilla, and some citrus notes. The aroma is nice. Medium mouthfeel but bordering on a little light. Slight roast, caramel, some booze, and a lingering bitterness. Leaves a little orange like sweetness on the lips. As it warms it has a slight soapy note to it."
"Overall, I feel this barleywine may be one that is best enjoyed fresh, it does have some very nice characteristics but the flavors seemed a bit muted and the mouthfeel was not what I suspected."
"O: Not very high on my list for barleywines. Just too little going here compared to other brewers out there. Interestingly the aroma is better than the taste of this beer."
"sturdy barleywine from mad river. vintage 2010 listed at 10%abv. pours a slightly cloudy light molasses color with a faint orange tint. 2 inch off white head. smells of dried fruit and alcohol, sweet malts as well. flavor is huge malty base with gentle bittersweet fruits, plums maybe, and a major alcohol finish. even more pronounces as it warms, almost to the level of a sweet rubbing alcohol. a good winter sipper but a few of these might put you under. mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation and a booze burn. might age well..."
""
"This is the type of American Barleywine i enjoy, hops that are faded but show lightly, a lot of caramel, and a generous helping of alcohol warmth. I know most people would want to tame it, but this is what i relish."
""
""
"O: Maybe it's just me, but the vintages of this BW are solid...never had it fresh but had several '07 & '08 and at the price point this is a good BW for not being barrel aged...solid clean BW."
""
""
"O - I am glad I picked it up but wont be going back to get it again. Nothing at all really stands out. Bottom line; a very typical barleywine, if you see it, try it, but no need to go look for it."
""
"Overall this is a pretty good barleywine but nothing special. Worth drinking if you see it, but you don't need to go out of your way to find it."
"O: it was drinking better than I thought and was even more tasty than I thought it would be."
"O - This brew did not measure up to MRBC's stigma... Very disappointing. Recommended, but not worth a hunt. Very average."
""
"i don't find the beer overly boozy in flavor as others have noted. of course at 10% it does pack a wallop. glad i got to try this, and it wasn't bad, but it is not a great example of the style. maybe in a year or two this will mellow out a bit -- but for now, i find this to be too harsh."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, and it's around all the time, so I think if I were in the mood and didn't want to pop for a more expensive version, I could go back to it."
""
""
""
""
"O - Eh. Nothing special. It's not the worst beer I've ever had, but it is quite far from good in my opinion."
"Pours a murky super dark brown with a 2 inch puffy light khaki head that settles to a thin cap. A nice latticework of lace forms on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, brown sugar, toffee, and lots of citrus zest hops. Taste is of malt, brown sugar, and some citrus zest flavors. Pretty straightforward progression from the nose. There is a very mild bitterness that quickly fades from the palate. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good barleywine but nothing too special. I didn't find this one to be as bad as others seem to think in the reviews."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: Not a really terrible brew, but not really great either. Probably not a brew that I'll seek out again."
"Taste, whoo, still very hot, yeasty grittiness on the teeth, ample sweetness and huge bitterness still on this one. Tough to pull much in the way of taste out of this, the alcohol is just omniprescient or whatever that word is. Had em fresh, had em aged, just not a fan at any stage of this, despite liking many Mad River brews. Seemed to be lacking the necessary malt additions to soak up the alcohol presence."
"Overall: Definitely not one of my favorite barleywines, but decent. It needs character and personality...definitely suffers from a serious identity crisis and I just don't know what Mad River was trying to paint in this portrait. I bought a 4-pack of this based on the recommendation of the liquor store beer guy so I could try one and give out the rest as trade extras. With that said, I apologize in advance to those who received this as an extra in their trades with me…I didn’t know, I swear!"
"reviews seem harsh, i think this is a pretty good barleywine. could age really well."
"O: I would have loved for this to be a bit more aromatic and flavorful. Its mostly just booze and a tad bitter at the finish. Not bad, but not sure its worth the price."
"Overall: Its a good barleywine, and a decent value. I wish I would have tried it fresh, I bet its pretty hoppy. good, but not the best."
"Not overly impressed with this, especially given that it has had 4 years in the bottle to meld. Not bad, but not one to look for in my opinion."
"Not much head on this one. Dark mahogany colored. Just looks creamy. Smell is weak. Smells of sugar, alcohol, fig, and raisin. Tastes very similar to the nose, but the alcohol isn't present. Very boring. Not bad, but just boring. There's nothing that stands out as unique or special. Mouthfeel: next to none in carbonation. Creamy. Light. Too light IMO. Overall, this should be more like 6 or 8 bucks a 6 pack rather than 11 or 12 bucks for a 4 pack. Just not worth the money."
"Not exactly a bad barleywine, but rather weak in flavor while still being alcohol forward, overly sweet, and full of rock candy and medicinal elements that don't work well together. Mad River is capable of better, though this style isn't their forte."
"Overall, this is a good-quality barleywine, though perhaps slightly weighty on the sugars. A heavier grain counter would have helped balance the brew better. Still, the sugary flavors are well-crafted, and sure to please barleywine fans."
"2007 bottle, drank in 2008. The beer poured out as a hazy brown color. The head was pretty nice looking and thick. The lacing was pretty good here also. The smell of the beer was pretty hoppy with some sweet barley in the mix. The taste of the beer was very hoppy all around and was sweet too. The mouthfeel was thick and syrupy, had some decent carbonation to it. Overall I found it to be a pretty good barley wine."
"O - Well crafted for sure, since their were several different flavors taking place, but it didn't ""wow"" me like a few other barley wines have."
"Overall I would not get this again. Balance is not very good and the weird sour, bitterness is unpleasant and continues for a while in the aftertaste."
"Poured a hazy dark brown color with a light brown head. Big aromas of spices and booze. On the palate, full bodied, with way too much spice and a hot finish. Way too spicy for me."
"Delicious but I wish this was English style. The hops hide the great rich flavors underneath. As an American style, it's quite good though, very much like a good quality English but with a healthy punch of hops. Though I prefer my Barleywines sans hops, I would have more of this in a heartbeat."
"A decent barleywine. This is just a pretty straight forward, big beer."
"1/2"" beige head settles to patchy cloudwork. Crystal clear orangy-amber. Really great color and clarity. The smell is lovely! I'm having a hard time pinning down what exactly I'm smelling. Sweet and fruity, malty. Tiny hint of whisky, smooth aroma, suggestion of vanilla and you can almost smell the bitterness of the hops, earthy. Somewhere in the back a tiny whiff of black pepper. The flavor rolls in smooth and sweet, some southern sweet-tea leads into a mild easy round bitterness. Still enough bitterness to make me sneeze though. I'm tasting some mild pine, a little lemon-sugar. Tasty tasty barleywine. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth, lightly warming but surprisingly easy to drink at 10.8. The late finish has some interesting hoppy toffee in there."
"You know, it's not too shabby. Being that it's not obscenely sweet it makes for a nice sipper. I didn't have it fresh but it seems to have held up well (some oxidation; nothing over the top). I may see if I can track down another bottle or two."
"O: An enjoyable, everyday barley wine. Hides the ABV quite well. Not a ton of complexity, but drinkable and good for what it is."
"Deep tan head of nicely dense foam, however, you can see the bubbles pop, moves like a barrel of worms until there’s nothing left across the surface, lacing is negligible. Full on chunks floating throughout the yellow-brown liquid, vague amber darkening at the core, muddy waters. Shows a few bourbon like notes alongside the chocolate, butterscotch, banana, fig, some corn and sweeter grains, mild orange reduction, scone to soda bread, has an unfortunate lack of explosiveness and weight, kind of folds in on itself. In the mouth it’s close to full-bodied, durable carbonation helps it expand across the palate decently. More fig, yellow raisin, date and then cherry, banana, blackberry notes, still not quite sweet. Brown sugar, maple syrup and chocolate likewise clearly present yet without much soothing ability. Orange reduction with an infusion of more sour white grapefruit. Nuts and rum cake, carrot cake. Metallic undercurrent along with a light pepperiness. Not sure if this bottle has faded some but it just comes across as lacking in self-assurance and richness of expression. So, physically drinkable without making you want to drink it."
"O-A decent barleywine but not a repeater for me."
"D: Very drinkable beer. Not the best, but good. Have a few bottles still and will hold onto them and send out as extras."
"Medium body, lighter on the carbonation. Some warming alcohol. Nice mix of darker fruit, malt and hops. This could still sit for a while, as there is some heat still. Pretty good."
"Would buy again given the opportunity. Picked up a four banger on a CA roadtrip."
"Overall seek out the 2008 or 2009 version. Even the 2010 version seems to have better score but this is just sad. Man what a let down for the 2011 version..."
"Pours a translucent deep reddish color with some speckles floating around. Sizable tan head is produced from a vigorous pour that dissipates quickly, leaving lacing all up the sides of my Bruery tulip. Smells strongly of faded hops, with dark fruits and a hint of rubbing alcohol. This beer certainly is fragrant. The taste is much smoother than the smell, though I'm guessing that the age on this bottle is doing it big favors. The hops are only hinted at now, though I assume they were once strong. Bitterness does longer slightly and marries the dark fruit, booze raisin flavor of a barleywine. That being said, this beer lacks a clarity of flavor, which seems to match the nose. There is a lot going on, but I don't know if it is working all that well in harmony. Low to medium carbonation with a medium mouthfeel helps make this beer sort of drinkable for the style, I guess. I'm underwhelmed."
"Drinkability: Boozy and warming with nice dark fruit makes for decent barleywine. Although I'd not drink more than one at a sitting."
"This 2008 Barleycorn is quite a nice surprise. The flavors are well-balanced, a little sweet, but very drinkable. Maybe this ale needs some time to sit before drinking. Whatever the case, I feel that this is a really good beer with some standout flavors."
"At 11%, this is a beer i would have one over the period of 45 minutes to an hour. The flavors are consistent and the body is nice. This particular brew doesn't offer anything new though but it still makes for an excellent night cap."
"D - I liked this beer for what it is but it's certainly not a go to brew or very drinkable to me. It's a beer I'd like to sit down with in the Winter season to warm me up, but nothing I'd have more than 2 of at one sitting. Overall I think it's not bad but I won't be buying it again. I just would have liked a bit more complexity instead of just sweet fruity alcoholic flavors and smells, worth a try though for fans of Barleywines."
"This is a really solid barleywine and extremely drinkable considering it's 11% ABV. Good stuff."
"MF: Not as huge-bodied as you'd expect an 11% barleywine to be, but that makes it dangerously drinkable. This beer is smooth and slightly creamy, while not chewy or heavy."
"Gah, I'm wrong again. John Barleycorn Barleywine 2009 Vintage from Mad River Brewing Co. This has aged beautifully and its 11%! Next review I'm going to guess what I think it is then pick something completely different."
"Carbonation is near gone, making for a very smooth drink. ABV becomes a much more dominant presence. One would think that after 2 years, it would been resolved. Perhaps not."
"Cherry amber with a smooth, dense tan head that leaves sheets of silky lace on the glass. Dark fruit, brown sugar, black strap molasses and rum in the nose..nice. Butterscotch and mascerated raisin and cherry with floral hop notes and warm alcohol. Full bodied with medium carbonation. This is an amazing Barleywine, certainly worthy of extended aging, the '06 is drinking out of this world right now. This is the most underrated beer on BA...it blows my mind."
"Very good Barley Wine, very rich. A dessert beer for sure."
"My bottle has a different label and says it's the 2009 Cellar Reserve, so this must be a special run. The beer poured cloudy auburn in color, and had a one finger thick head that lasted for quite a while when left alone. There didn't appear to be any lingering carbonation after the initial pour. The aroma was very much like liquefied raisins with some slight pine in the background. The taste was sweet and vinous with a lot of toffee and very little hop presence considering the style. The sweetness was not cloying though, and there was a restrained spiciness in the finish. Very clean tasting, with almost no hot notes, which made it very drinkable for a Barleywine. The first impression made me feel that this was a little too light in the mouth, but the thickness seemed to be better after it warmed up. A straightforward, but extremely elegant drink."
"Full in body and lightly carbonated. Oil slickness and a warm alcohol finish. Not to shabby of a barleywine if I say so myself."
"But at the same price point, there's better old ales available and there's better barleywines as well, and I would recommend seeking those out first."
"I tried another from this 4-pack and it was a completely different beer. It seems the one I reviewed above was a bad beer. (I've never had a bad beer before.) The second one was delicious, sweet and fruity, but the alcohol balanced everything with a pleasant spiciness. There was no bitterness, and the mouth feel was far less carbonated and not course at all. This one was very drinkable. I'm going to have another right now. The scores now reflects the second beer."
"I really liked this one. It isnt too sweet or cloying and the hop bite balances out the fruity malts perfectly. Perhaps this is the year to drink this one because it is really quite nice. Mouthfeel was medium and chewy without being sweet. I dont know what ya'll are drinking but this was great."
"The flavor is big, with the caramel and toffee playing a big part and a pronounced hop profile coming through as well. Very little alcohol heat or burn but I'm not sure how much to expect when the abv is 9.1. Either way it's well masked in the flavor. Dates, plum, and fruit jam comes through big time in the flavor as well. Over all this is a nice barleywine but it may err just a bit of the sweet side. A more roasty 'natural' malt presence is desired. All in all this is still a very good drink."
"I'm glad this one comes in 12 oz bottles, because I don't think I could handle a bomber by myself."
"I'm not sure any barley wine is really drinkable. It's highly alcoholic and very bitter. However, there's a malty creaminess to it that keeps me drinking it."
"Overall not bad, but not great. I was hoping there would be more hop to balance out the sweet malt but a little unbalanced"
"Other comments: My favorite barleywine is Old Saguaro. That is the standard by which I rate other BWs. This one comes fairly close."
"Drink is great, this is a great barleywine, and Im thinking for the price I will pick up another."
"Taste profile's a little like a Belgian quad, but, not heavily hopped, this does seem to be an English-style Barleywine - from what Ive heard of the style. My guess is that nationalist tastebuds, over-valuing lots of citrusy hops, are the reason behind the relatively low ratings. But I dig it - I think most American-style Barleywines are overhopped, personally."
"I will never buy this again."
"D: A decent barleywine. Drinkable, but I won't be searching for it again."
"Oh, taste is pretty nice. What a dichotomy from the nose! Toasty and caramely sweet with a full body and smooth creaminess that fits in with the best barleywines. Some vanilla, raisins and rotting fig fruitiness comes out as it warms. Very enjoyable brew, I like it. Somewhere in between an English and an American BW, has some flavors from both styles here. I'd buy it again, seems to age quite well."
"This is a pretty mild barleywine. not a whole lot of complexity, just a high ABV. It easy drinking for sure and I liked the mouthfeel but otherwise would be looking somewhere else for a barleywine."
"The body was a fair bit thinner than I enjoy for the style. Drinkability was pretty good, I'll definitely grab this again. Overall, a beer you should try if your a BW fan, and worth a shot if you like beer in general."
"D - Not the best barely wine Ive had, but nothing to turn away from. It has no bad point but not enough good points."
"Poured in to a pint glass with a nice deep copper color with a carmel head. Very smooth drink even with a 9.5% ABV. Nice lite fruity smell with a little hint of prune flavor with each drink. Though the malt flavor is very present. It was my first barley wine and I have to say I was very pleased."
"D: Average drinkability for a barleywine, not something you would want to gulp but tasty. Overall this is a good barleywine, but not great."
"D:"
"Pretty sure this is the best barleywine that I've had. There's something rustic to it, and it doesn't try to be too extreme. I think it is really tasty, and definitely would like to get it again."
"There's a bit of bite as you drink this, and it leaves the tongue dry when it's done. A decent, if not slightly harsh barleywine. This beer improves as it warms, so give it time. Good for one, I'd wait until another evening to have a second."
"Drinkability: it's a pretty good beer overall, but a little imbalanced and not, in my opinion, a great example of the style."
"The best quality of this beer is its unapologetic caramel quality. It should be named ""Sugar Daddy."" But I expect a barley wine to have a little something else going for it. It's almost as if this is a good base recipe they need to riff on in future batches. It just doesn't stand out."
"The body is creamy and smooth. I can tell that some of the carbonation is lost, but it's still a pleasant sipper. This beer starts out semi-sweet like cherry candy, but then melds to a smooth bitter taste on the finish. The bitterness is low here. Plenty of malt presence as I'm getting lots of toffee and caramel. Nothing really stands out here, but it's still good nonetheless. Not a bad beer."
"D - 1 or 2 will do it on these. While there are no strong alcohol flavors, this beer is 10.8% and should be respected. At the end of the day, I could probably put down 4 or 5 of these, but the fun of this beer lies in identifying all the new aromas and flavors each time you bring it up to your mouth...after 2 of these, I think you would lose that ability...time to switch to a macro and keep that party going."
"Barleycorn is a pretty solid little barleywine that has a nice malty thick body with a touch of classy spice and warming to it. It's not as downable as some of the more caramelized yummy west coasters out there, but it sips well enough to enjoy a bottle or two of without much hassle."
"Notes: Quite a surprise, there is some US brash bitterness found on plenty of barleywines this side of the pond, but here it works rather well being a second layer to the rich malty profile. If some aging soothes that aspect and adds some complexity this has the potential to be a truly outstanding barleywine."
"D - Not an overwhelming amount of complexity, but for sure a solid beer."
"2006 Vintage on-tap at Flying Saucer for 2.75, hard to beat that! Served in a tulip glass a slightly murkey dark orange with a nice frothy khaki head that lasts and leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight burnt caramel malts and slight dried fruits. The taste is a surprisingly fruity malt front with some slight hop undertones. The beer is somewhat heavy, but the alcohol is far from overbearing. This is a very enjoyable Barley Wine, one that has aged quite well."
"The body was full and very creamy with a nice chewy sticky dry finish. The carbonation was light and fluffy. The beer's components did a nice job of distracting from the alcohol content. Very good flavors and good drinkability to this one. I felt it walked a good line on a tough style."
"I could not finish this one."
"D-huge flavors and a nice complexity blending big malt and hop together. The bitterness at the finish is a nice hop touch; but I can't keep drinking and the mouth really feels dry after sipping."
"- Overall very drinkable... but the flavors are a tad sweet and lacking some true character. The rich sweet caramel malt is present... but I get the same in a number of their beers, and many from other brewers."
"Overall, would recommend this beer for a good wintertime joy."
"F.T.- I cant believe this beer doesn't rate higher. Im not sure how this beer tasted fresh, but it sure ages well IMO."
"Chewy medium body which is shockingly very hop forward. I was not expecting this since the beer is over a year old. The hops are bitter and piny with subtle citrus notes. This is quickly balanced by a sweet alcohol and leathery malt body. Hints of earthy caramel malt, toffee, biscuit, chocolate, more hops and sweet alcohol. Although there is plenty of alcohol flavor there is very little heat or warmth in the finish. The high ABV is well masked and the excellent complexity make this beer very quaffable."
"Bottle. Pours a brown/ruby color with a creamy white head. Smell is sweet and malty, nice fruity smell, I think I'm going to like this one. Just enough carbonation, very smooth. Alcohol taste on the first drink was a surprise, not unpleasant but more than I was expecting. Very fruity taste and sweet. Sticky mouthfeel and very good. I really enjoyed this one."
"Some haze in a muddy amber brown body. Finger of light khaki brown head. Some lacing. Toffee, cookie, and mild cocoa malts on the nose. Some oxidized-ish Madeira and shoe leather. Maybe a hint of grassy hops. Taste starts off with a flash of woody hop bitterness. Soon becomes malty, with good amounts of toffee, caramel, and sugary, rummy fruits. Woody, minty, slightly astringent hop bitterness comes on into the finish. A bit too warm, with notes of fusel alcohol. More woody hops and lingering toffee in the finish. Medium-full body with a slightly sticky feel. A little harsh, although I did like the malt flavors."
"D - Next time I will have a different Barleywine, or a different Mad River brew. This beer doesn't suck, but it is not too special either."
"I have very mixed reviews on barleywines from Flat Earth's Winter Warlock to Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot - I guess I don't really know what the style should be but this seems to middle ground and I liked it."
"overall, pretty decent. not sure id want more than one at any given time. flavors are a bit all over, i would love to try this again with some time on it."
"This poured a cloudy mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like chocolate and caramel and roasted barley, with some copper hops and earthy brown sugar. It tasted like cocoa powder and roasted barley and brown sugar, with some copper hops and earthy caramel and a bit of creamy yeast. It was thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this has a very nice malty scent and taste with great body. It hid the alcohol fairly well too, so it was easy to drink. But I could see this mellowing further with some age. More like an English than American barleywine to me, and not super exciting, but still a very nice beer."
"D-Definitely along the lines of an English Barley Wine....very enjoyable and would stack up there with most if the body had a little more to it."
"D - Once again Mad River Has done me right; I never hear anyone talking about this brewery, but they seem to make some pretty solid beers. The hops and malt are well balanced and manage to play off each other well in this beer. My only complaint is that it is perhaps a touch too sugary. I find nothing serious to complain about and the hop flavor in particular is quite complex and well done. I'd drink another one if I had one."
"This actually started out okay, with a dark brown color with a hint of ruby, and a thin tan head that dissipated quickly. Initial aroma was malty sweet dark fruit, as was the first couple sips. THEN THE ALCOHOL GRABBED HOLD!! From about the fourth sip on, all I could taste and smell was alcohol, blended with a thick sweet body. Try as I could, I just could not find any other taste or nose, and ended up pouring this one out."
"All told, good stuff. Definitely plan on getting a few bottles to age for a few years."
"D: Very drinkable indeed, the flavor profile was great, but would have expected it to stand out from the other old ales and barley wines. I find this very very drinkable for an '08 and wouldn't need more aging, would be curious how it melds together to something I'd predict to be extremely mellow."
"Picked up a single at Blue Max since I'd never seen it before. This bottle was from 2008, I've never had a fresh one so I can only guess that time has muted the hops a little. It reminded me somewhat of 1-3 year old Bigfoot."
"note: If aging, I would definitely wax the tops of these bottles, as they are twist-offs."
"The few sips I took left me feeling like I had takein JD shot all night. Not a good beer!"
"I gotta say, I was looking forward to giving this one a try -- especially since the only other Mad River brew I've had is the Steelhead pale ale. I'm unfortunately a bit unimpressed with this selection. When I think of a great, intense barleywine, the first beer that jumps to mind is Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot. There's a smoothness to Bigfoot in spite of that ale's unavoidable bitterness and strength, as well as Old Foghorn and Old Crustacean, that this beer lacks. I might have jumped the gun in drinking this bottle the same year I bought it, but there are definitely some harsh edges to this brew. My bottle's vintage is 2008, so it already has a year on it, but it might be worthwhile to grab one and let it sit in a nice spot for 2 or 3 years. Until then, I'm afraid I'm inclined to reach for other barleywines instead."
"Pours a hazy copper with tan head. The aroma has light dark fruitiness, some rich creamy caramel candy sweetness that is then disrupted with mild stale grains and alcohol. The taste is nice and vaguely SN Bigfoot Ale like with both light dark fruitiness coming first along with pine hop bitterness. Then a rich caramel candy and chocolate maltiness surfaces about midway. Toward the finish dry roasted malts, hints of toffee and then the distraction of stale grains kind of finish the taste experience with a mild dose of alcohol. A couple more years of age, a bit less pine hops and better grains (non organic maybe) and this would be a stellar offering."
"The taste is not as good and soon settles into forgettable, one-dimensional blandness with alcohol. Caramelly stewed fruit, especially prunes, start things off up front with some candied orange and spicey, warm raisiny rum. It has a light but firm sweetness with light, bitterness and a fair amount of spiciness, a bit harsh, plus hints of burnt bread. This soon settles into a vague, ill-defined mix of overly hot, spicey alcohol, vague hint of prune, and hint of burnt orange peel, all subdued and nondescript. A faint hint of meaty steak sauce mixed with rough alcohol lingers after the finish. The feel is fairly thick and oily. It's boring, too strong for what you get, and quite tiresome. Perhaps I should have let it sit longer but I don't think that should have been necessary."
"notes and comments- these notes are for a 2008 vintage"
"2008 Vintage. Poured an amber reddish murky brown with practically no head. Smell is a ton of caramel malt on toffee. Some fruit. A lot of biscuit malt in the taste. Interesting balance between strong malt flavors and hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, very low carbonation (could almost be a nitrogenated beer). Overall pretty drinkable, especially for the 9.5% abv (could barely taste the alcohol). In hindsight, I feel this would be a lot better if I'd let it age a couple of years."
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my basic snifter glass. 2006 vintage. The barleywine appears a hazed rich deep brown color with about a finger or so of fluffy of white foam. Nose and flavor are of plums, notes of brown sugar and raisins, sweet caramel, toasted bread grain. Mild alcohol heat. A tad better than medium bodied with ample carbonation. Looking forward to the 2005 I've got as well."
"I ended up leaving my glass alone for a while. After letting the beer come closer to room temperature the flavor has opened up considerably. The sweetness has relaxed and brought out more of the bread flavors I was smelling. The hops are completely gone from the finish. The head is just a memory. I am still very impressed with this beer and will probably treat it more like a wine than a beer in the future by leaving it alone prior to enjoying."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, sticky, and mildly carbonated."
"2008 version. Pours chestnut with a thick, off-white, pancake head that leaves some lacing as it dissipates. Smells a little dry and austere. Quite woody with notes of molasses and wet earth. The taste is much better, with brandy and chocolate notes to begin, followed by some bitter earthy hops and wood and molasses on the finish. Not perfectly integrated yet, but the flavors are not muddied and are strong, clear, and tasty. Should age quite well. The mouthfeel is very smooth, rich, slightly sweet, and a tad boozy without being hot. Quite full flavored but the entore package is surprisingly mellow. Nice."
"An interesting take on a barleywine. More citrusy than I am used to having. Would like to try one with some age."
"Light amber with low head. Come on - give us a little more color and a bit more head. Smells like a decent I2PA - northwest hops and a touch of caramel. Oh my. That is absolutely crazy in the mouth. Not a barleywine, no. Crazy. Good. Really good. Close. But no. Not barleywine. Alas - the problem of having strict rating systems! And, hey, organic? Man, these guys rock! It's interesting and crazy and crazy... Like an I2PA, really, only with a little more body and a little more b'wine sweetness - some oxidized extract beer, some bubblegum (t-58 - bleh!), a hint of orange and bitter (this is a 2007 consumed in 2009 - note: do not age john barleycorn!). Crazy. I wonder... You know... This must be radically different, radically fruity, when fresh. All the more like an I2PA (and not like a barleywine) but much better to drink..."
"Poured into a snifter for a dark, murky ruby tinted brown with a minimal tan head. Had a strong, alkie smell with some notes of yeast, barley, syrupy malts - smell is a little runny and overpowering. Dry, hot taste upfront due to large ABV poking through but after initial taste there is a semi-sweetness to this beer that lets it go down smooth. Caramel, dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malts all seem to be tucked in there and the beer is slightly sticky. Finishes dry, like smokey or bourbonesque dry, but that is more to the alcohol leaking through than hop bitterness or dry malts. Not a bad beer to sip on at all but not the most polished barleywine out there."
"Not something I'd rush out and try again, but a pretty good barleywine. This would be great on a cold winter night."
"D- I have to say this barleywine is a refreshingly different take on the style. The flavors feel very rural and country (redundant I know). Once again not sure if this was intended based on the name but if it was it was executed masterfully."
"Definitely my favorite from Mad River."
"Pours a cloudy brown/amber color with lighter orange color along the bottom of the glass. One inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, strong hops, some sweet malt, and some fruit (raisin or plum). Fits the style of an American Barleywine. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with an average carbonation level. Also, there is a bitterness associated with this brew from the combination of high alcohol and hops. Tastes of hops up front, then alcohol, some sweet malt in the background, a hint of roasted malt, the alcohol reappears in the finish."
"One of these goes back easy. Multiple might be an issue."
"Drinkability- If not for the ABV, the balance this beer presents would make it a decent session beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good for the style, a tad more bitter than I'm used to for a barley wine, but still good."
"d - middle of the road. w/ 9.6% it's a good deal for a buzz."
"Despite what others have said I think this is a good beer, and I'd like to try a vintage on tap, a nice warm cask maybe. I would have it if I saw it at a bar I usually go to, one that didn't have much that I haven't tried. That was overly complicated, but is really for my own benefit for when I go back and read this next year when I try my other John Barleycorn from this batch. In the words of Adrian Belew - ""I LIKE IT""."
"Overall a pretty solid high ABV barleywine."
"This beer is past it's prime, but definitely not bad. It's thin, and light on the flavors, but it still has some redeeming qualities. Definitely the oldest beer I have ever tasted, and I am glad I got to try it."
"Peaks & valleys here. The look was great, the aroma not so great, and from there all was good. Will gladly have again, but won't seek it out."
"D - John Barleycorn is certainly easy to drink because despite the flaws the alcohol is well hidden and the strong flavors aren't present. However when I think of a barleywine I think of a long slow drink to sip and savor and I find myself gulping this stuff down to try and find what I'm missing. How Mad River managed to brew a barleywine that has almost zero taste is beyond me."
"Despite my above negatives... I would buy at least a few of these every year... but I would never touch them without at least a couple of years in the cellar.. it shows a ton of promise, but ""fresh", not really inviting or special."
"Not sure how this was fresh but with some age it is quite tasty."
"I resisted pouring this down the drain and I have started to like it. I think I approached it with a very strong picture of what a barley wine should be, and when it didn't meet my narrow expectations I got angry and stomped around like a child. This more resembles an old ale than what I'm used to in a B.W. Its smoothness and drinkability are quite remarkable, considering its high ABV. It's body is a bit thin, though, and it's still not really adventurous enough for my liking."
"Drinkability, even dismissing the must, isn't high. This is one-and-out for me. I'd like to see what one of these is like fresh, but after one year, it's already showing its age, not a good sign for a high ABV barleywine."
"This is so highly drinkable, to me. I could drink this in place of water, for an extended time, I think. Granted, I might not get much done in that time period, but I'd be happy. And I'd enjoy every drop of it."
"A decent enough Barleywine, though not my favorite. Just something about it that didn't suit me. Sort of a plastic-like taste. Worth a try."
"A decent drinking barleywine but it seemed a bit hot. Some aging would probably serve well with this one."
"D = A nice drinking American barleywine, but at the same time quite apparently strong in the mouthfeel and alcohol."
"D - This was a little hard to drink because it seemed to lack balance. It was too boozy for my tastes."
"2007 bottle- poured into an old guardian barleywine glass. Good amount of head that slowly recedes to a nice lacing along the edge of the glass with patches in the middle after several tastes. Smell is classic barley wine- malty sweet with a noticeable alcohol presence. Taste is similar, lots of malt sweetness followed by hops which lead into fairly strong alcohol. I would have to guess centenials, cascades, and maybe some chinooks (or something else high alpha). They've settled in nicely with time, however, the alcohol is pretty overbearing. I don't mind it but I imagine most would. Not the best, but a great winter barleywine"
"A decent barleywine, not spectacular but very respectable."
"D: another good brew from Mad River. I think this is a very drinkable Barleywine and is worth buying again. I got a sample when at the Belmont Station and thought it was worth the buy after a dixie cup gulp. I am glad I bought it"
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass, beer is a deep ruby-amber color with just a thin rim of soapy carbonation around the top of the glass. The smell is a nice mix of the complex malty undertones and the citrusy, piney hop notes. The flavor is much the same as the smell, with the maltiness of the beer coming through initially - sweet with dark fruits and alcohol and ends with a slightly bitter, piney, lemony hop finish with the burn of alcohol fumes. The mouthfeel is full bodied with just about the right amount of carbonation for a barley wine. Overall drinkability given the ABV is rather high, definitely meant to be sipped not quaffed."
"D - Definitely drinkable for a 9%+ ABV. I could drink a few of these."
"D: A rather nice barleywine. I've warmed up to the style a little more, knowing that a few months tends to put these beers in a place that I quite enjoy. Glad to have tried it, though I'm not 100% certain I'd be on the lookout for it again."
"Pretty drinkable for the style, but pretty boring. I had a Green Flash West Coast IPA before this which might have affected my palate, but this is pretty one dimensional and boring. I will probably not revisit this one soon. There are much better barleywines out there for the same price or cheaper."
"Drinkability- Not a world class Barley wine, but a worthy effort."
"This is a boozy barleywine, catching up soon enough with its 9.5% ABV. All in all, this is quite good barleywine, doing much right with flavor and texture. Good stuff. This John Barleycorn must not die."
"The smell was of dense and full of fruitiness and raisins. The taste wasn't overly sweet but was pretty well balanced. The maltiness was definitely in charge, not much hop presence. In the mouth it stayed with the tongue and abv hit the throat. The caramel sweetness was comforting. All and all not a bad barley but not my favorite."
"An interesting one. There are some complexities to it which I can't quite appreciate, yet could see someone liking. It's big, full, resinous, and earthy. I want to say it's sweet, but the woody and earthy notes don't really leave room for sweetness. Like a really earthy and intense Old Ale. Worth a shot, as it may rub you the right way, but it just falls flat in my eyes. Can't say I'll pick any more up anytime soon."
"A big, tasty treat. Powerful flavor is not for the uninitiated. More malty than hoppy. Something to be savored."
"Pours hazy copper with a short off-white head. Wood, grass, alcohol, malt, and shoe leather in the nose. Caramel and earth up front with the alcohol taste and warmth near the end. Sometimes it did taste like liquid wood it was so earthy. There is a sweet hop taste near the finish that was nice. This was very unbalanced, but still nice to drink."
"While it doesn't taste bad, there's just nothing remarkable about it. Most of the flavors just seem very vague. Personally won't get it again over other Barleywines."
"Overall impression: A big American Barleywine. Hops have definitely faded. No way to tell how fresh the sample is so the brewer takes the hit. Nothing off but I would like to see more hop aromas and flavors for this style. Worth a try."
"D: Very tasty and quaff-able, this is one of the better recent barley wines that I have enjoyed. Also, one of the better caramel-biter hops combos out there. Try it."
"D: Not bad at all, but I'll bet I wouldn't like a fresh bottle. If I could find it in six-packs I might drink it regularly to keep me from getting spoiled by the really good barleywines."
"Great Barleywine, very drinkable big beer. My first ever beer from Mad River, can't wait to pick up some more."
"I did not expect much out of this beer, therefore I was less disappointed, weakest barleywine I tried at Naja's during the festival and yes I had them all, it is cool that you can buy six packs of this stuff when it is released but I do not think I would, might be worth trying"
"This beer will definitely still age for quite some time. The hop character is still a bit rough right now and the hot alcohol notes could definitely use some mellowing out. I expected this to get better as it warmed up, but it actually got worse, more hot and more harshly hoppy. This really ended up being quite a big disappointment; it really needs at least another two years, if not five, before it might start to get drinkable."
"Drinkability - a good candidate for aging in my opinion; cool the alcohol and mellow the hops. I'd prefer it colder than the normal barleywine serving temperature, at least when fresh."
" I tried this beer last year at the barley wine fest at browers. It was twice as better this year. This is a good beer to drink on a cold night. Bravo."
"$4 single at Sahara Mart in Bloomington, IN."
"Full bodied and full-flavored mix of rich, tasty malts. So many caramelized sugars, you'd think you are eating a Sugar Daddy! All of this is nicely balanced with a firm supply of floral, orangy hops. It finishes wet with a mildly bitter aftertaste and warming alcohol. This is a seriously flavorful, sweet and bitter beer and not for the faint of heart."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice high-gravity beer that is worth drinking for as long as you can until the ABV catches up with you."
"Poured a cloudy, deep amber/copper color. Had a small tannish head. The pour reminded me of a Thomas Hardys Ale. Nose is malts, caramel, candy, brown sugar and dried fruits. Taste tasted the same. Very malty, brown sugar and fruits. It tasted more like an English bwine rather than a hopped up American bwine. It just had that feel to it. The ABV had subsided alot. Hard to rate and judge the difference between a vintage and new bottle. Mouthfeel was silky and smooth, candy, sugar dried fruits and malty but not that stout. ABV seemed lower leaving drinakbility good. Overall good!"
"A solid BW that is a pleasure too consume and worth twelve-bucks a sixer."
"Drinkability: An average barleywine. On the plus side, the alcohol's well hidden, the malt bill is interesting, and it's got a great, even, creamy head that comes through in the mouthfeel. On the other side, it's a pretty unattractive color, and the aftertaste is a little bothersome, sort of tartly vegetal in a funky way, which sort of disrupts the whole experience. Worth trying once, and cool that it's organic, but I likely won't be getting it again."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, plummish, sweet grain, and just a touch of alcohol. In the taste, dry dark fruit, very small alcohol notes, a light maltiness, and a small hop bite. A bitter and medium mouthfeel, with a dry alcohol and small dark fruit in the aftertaste. Quite easy for a big barley wine, a nice hop, and hides alcohol nicely."
"d: I've had one of these fairly fresh and I don't remember it better than average. Thanks to mikesgroove for the chance to try one of these after a little time in the cellar. It made a big difference."
"Raw and off-balance, though not putrid. Has its moments. I gleaned something enjoyable from this bottle, but wasn't transported either. Haven't had luck with new barleywines lately, having also had a weak Sisyphus recently. Probably not buying this one again."
"An inch and a half of wheat tan head colored head quickly fades to just a skim in minutes. Body is a honey ruby toned amber that sits very sharp in the glass. Nose has tons of rum soaked dark fruit and rich metalic carmalized malts. With first sip you are greeted by smooth but burnt malts that quickly yield to very hot tingly alchol notes. There is a consistant thick richness to the body of this beer. This beer drinks best when at room tempature and the alchol does calm down a bit as you drink. The alchol is slightly hot on this one, but I think a year or so will bring it around. Mouthfeel is thick but very pleasant. Drinkability is very good when warm."
"Would have loved to purchase another of these beauts to try next to a fresh one. Guess I will have to do my own cellaring and try it out in another 10 years."
"D - My bottle states that the ABV is a whopping 10.8%, not the 9.5% listed here. For it being nearly 11%, I'd say it acquits itself very well as to being drinkable. Rather than 1-and-done, as is the case with most barleywines, you might find yourself reaching for another. This was a pleasant surprise for me - I'd never seen nor heard of this before, but 1) it's a great value in that it comes in a sixer just like Bigfoot, and 2) it's got a lot to offer. A cool find - an obscure California brew making its way to the very edge of the southeastern US, how about that?"
"Drinkability: Well damn. Here is me wishing I had picked up more than a single of this. I would love to see how this develops in the cellar, it certainly has potential."
"A bit boozy overall, so not the easiest goin' down. One or two is plenty."
"HV"
"Pours a nice golden reddish/amber color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy creamy off-white head, with minimal sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly spice, some hops, with some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some hoppiness, spiced up a bit, and caramel tones. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty BW."
"A decent enough after-dinner snifter beer, but it's not an earthshattering one. Right now it's hitting the spot after work, but I don't think I'd neccesarily be drawn to it come re-up time. Still, if I was looking for a barleywine on the cheap, I'd keep this one in mind."
"Average drinkability."
"D: Drinkable but a definite pass the next time I see it."
"This is definitely a sweeter barleywine: lovers of Bigfoot or Old Guardian, beware. Tons of caramel malt, brown sugar, and ... rum soaked raisins? Interesting. There's some balancing grapefruit hops that add some fruit flavoring. Many people have noted melon: I don't taste it. The smell is nice, but not overwhelming. It's mostly just smells like sweet malt."
"This is a very nice barleywine. Great all-nighter! Very well balanced with great alcohol burn in the gut."
"A slow drinker, for certain. Not that I could'nt drink it fast, because it is rather smooth, but the alcohol is present and is a good remider that i need to take it slow."
"Appears a copper orange crystal clear in the body with a large off white billowing head after a vigorous pour into my Gulden Draak chalice. Lacing is even and thick with each sip pretty impressive looking brew. Aromatics are full of caramel malty layers with over ripened fruit soaking in alcohol along with big citric and brash pine hop character. Almost a buttered rum bread smell very luscious and inviting to the senses and than you have to dive into the first sip. Of course we're expecting west coast brashness but from back around the 2007 harvest this one is just starting to mellow out a bit. Sweet candy coated hops brown sugar, caramel, and honey sensations all at once. Full bitterness follows the barrage of malt flavor with citrus, pine, and earthy qualities noted and a nice kick of alcohol making it's presences known as well. Mouthfeel is definitely on the light side of the syrupy spectrum medium to full bodied range indeed, sticky with residual sugars left over after fermentation but makes it into a true after dinner or dessert beer depending on your preference. Carbonation level is great and hop burps singe the nose hairs occasionally providing smiles for us beergeeks lucky enough to have access to this brew. Drinkability and overall is pretty killer I grabbed a sixer at 15.99 but it was worth every penny and they disappeared much faster than I had expected. Session beer hell no, perfect for enjoying a cigar and good conversation with friends, hell yes."
"This is a good one and better than the Old Guardian IMHO."
"A few more sips in and I notice how bitter the finish really is but overall, I think it has good balance. A nice BWSA here that's a bit different tastewise than I'm used to but quite drinkable indeed. I'd drink it again."
"D: Pretty fucking strong, but pretty fucking good too."
"Very smooth with a mellow, fine carbonation. A mild booze warmth and a semidry finish. Tasty and well crafted. A nice selection to be sure."
"Drinkability: I may grab another one or two to lay down. I didn't realize the same brewery makes a lot of beers I'd seen before but never decided to pick up. This was a find for me, as I got a single bottle, and it's very easy-going while remaining complex and boozy. A nice and enveloping sipper, and one I'd like to keep trying every year if I can find it."
"Pours a glowing orange and melted caramel color. No head at all on this beer. Smell is of citrus and caramel with flavors of candied orange peel, and caramel as well with a moderate to light prickly carbonation that made it very drinkable. Some light alcohol to mingle with the orange flavors with a nice moderate hop bitterness in the finish. Pretty solid all around, I thought."
"D: Sip this one slowly and don't stand up to fast. Enjoyable!"
"maybe need to give this one some aging to enjoy it more"
"Bought 3 bottles of the 2007 from a sixer at City Wide. Pours light brown, hazy, with really no head, just a ring of bubbles cicling the glass. a bit lighter in color than i expected. Sweet and clean-smelling. a touch of ethanol on the nose too, with odors of dates, amber malt and grassy hops. smells pretty good. Taste is extremely bitter at first, even for a barleywine, and the rest of the flavors get a bit lost underneath. Some hop flavors, sweet malts, conspicuous absence of fruit flavor. Sticky and medium bodied. trending towards the lighter side of barleywines. Ill have to revisit this one after i age the other two bottles a while. I think it might have just been a little too young for my personal barleywine preferences."
"Overall this is a pretty good barleywine. It's not the best, but it's not the worst. I can't say it's worth seeking out, especially at its price."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and a little thin for my taste. Carbonation is good. Drinkability is somewhat limited due to the 10.8% abv. It still goes down smooth enough. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. It's somewhat unique and different than other barleywines on the market. Definitely worth checking out."
"The alcohol is very well hidden and it is too easy to drink. Really well done. I've got to find a way to age some of these, self-restraint not being my strong suit."
"M/D: Full bodied, carbonation is high but not prickly, body is slick and slightly creamy, sticks to the teeth a little (something I appreciate in a barleywine). Drinkability is so-so, maybe a tad low for a barleywine. Overall though, this is a solid beer. Not much to look at and the alcohol is a little too apparent, but it's still nice. I have a 2006 version and a few 2007s put away, and I think that time will really do them some good."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Not as complex as some other barleywines (see the aforementioned J.W. Lees). Still, a decently drinkable beer."
"Like grass fed organic corn, this beer is unique. The more I drink it, the more it tastes like sawdust."
"Carbonation is good, body is a little too thin, alcohol is a bit hot."
"D: For a nearly 11% big barleywine, this is pleasantly smooth and easy-to-sip right now. Well, maybe needs a little time for some fusel heat to die down... Despite an aroma that didn't quite agree with me, this is a solid/recommended choice for the barleywine fan."
"poured into a snifter. JBC, as I call it, pours a beautiful orangy/amber color with a reddish tint. Slightly off-white head retains about a quarter of an inch, and it gives the brew a nice amount of lacing. Strong hoppy aroma, followed by a sweet aroma of grains. Strong alcohol aroma in the tail-end of the nose. Citrus is the primary aroma in this with some pine. Original taste is overwhelming. My palate id perplexed, strong alcohol, sweet and fruity with a wonderful floral hop finish. Low/medium carbonation, with a complex palate, great mouthfeel. very drinkable and enjoyable. by the way, the alcohol content of the 2007 is 10.8%."
"One more note...I think this may be miscategorized as an ""American Barleywine"". Mad River is indeed an American brewer, but this is much more of an English style barleywine. Comparing it to Old Ruffian or Bigfoot is simply apples and oranges. Think Old Nick if you want a better comparison."
"problem drinking quite a few, however the 10.5abv tells me to savor! my local store sells sixers of these will go pick one up and cellar a few. lookin foward to Old Ruffian!"
"Aside, in my pre-BA days, I had a five year old bottle of this, 1998 bottling. It was nothing short of amazing and is one of my all-time favorites."
"Clear, deep reddish brown with a thin, off-white cap. Decent retention with spotty lacing. Rich caramel aroma with some warming alcohol, toffee, faint hops and a hint of roast. Medium bitterness that lingers at the back of the palate. Sweet caramel with doughy malt, mellow alcohol, a bit of dried fruit and dark malt, light grapefruit and a bit buttery. Full bodied and a little creamy, with lowish carbonation and fine bubbles, some warmth. Alcohol was definitely present, but stayed mellow. Easy drinking for the abv."
"I just shelled out $14.99 for a six of this and it is not as good as Great Divide's Old Ruffian or Avery's Hog Heaven. Don't mind its imperfections halfway through because of the high alcohol content which quite possibly smothers the positive attributes this Barley Wine might have but can't express."
"D- Not a huge fan of this. Seems like nothing is really refined in it. Pretty basic American Barleywine."
"The body was relatively heavy and went down smooth. This was a drinkable beer after 10 years, so I'm guessing its drinkable when its new."
"Poured from 12oz bottle 07 edition into a delirium tremens glass. Poured a brown amberish color with thin white head that quickly faded. Smell is toffee, malty alcohol aroma. Taste is very strong with a unbalance between the malt alcohol and bitterness. One is enough."
"Very drinkable, but at 10.8% that might be bad idea."
"Drinkability is pretty good in that this goes down really easy and drinks like a beer less then 9.5%...the is almost like the Coors Light of barleywines, light and bland and inoffensive. If your looking to slowly peel away layers of complexity, then you'll be disappointed, or perhaps it's just to subtle for a neanderthal like me!"
"I really like this beer. It is a bit light for a barleywine, but it makes up for that in smoothness and drinkability. Pours uniquely clear for a barleywine style, and has a refreshingly sweet taste rather than the common hoppy american style bwine. Very smooth, probably the most refreshing ( relatively speaking ) bwine I have tasted of yet. Good flavor for those who are not used to Barleywine, dont jump right into J.W. lees, have a few of these to acquire the taste and educate your palate. Good brew, a fun barleywine to get tipsy on, not too filling which is nice."
"2007 edition: Clear amber with quickly reducing 1 finger head. A bit of malt and piney hops in the smell, I really couldn't get much. Taste is complex and very good, fruity malt is followed by bitterness, then a bit more fruit and again bitterness. Mouthfeel is perfect, perfect carbonation, and slickness. I've laid a bottle down to see how it ages. Seems to me this is an underrated beer, on of the few rated good call that I thought were exceptional."
"2007 edition. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours an orangish-amber color with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is sweet and fruity with malt and toffee and a pretty strong amount of alcohol. The taste is pretty sweet and malty up front giving way to the hops and a warming effect from the alcohol in the finish. Overall, this is a decent barleywine that definitely needs a few years to mellow out as it is a little rough around the edges fresh. I will stash a couple of these away and re-visit after it has had a couple years to mellow."
"Overall: Strange... a mild yet tasty barleywine. Tons of flavors. Each flavor comes at you mildly and in waves. Nothing over the top about this beer. No doubt about it the most drinkable barleywine I have ever had. Quite a pleasant suprise for a beer I had never even heard of prior to the purchase."
"single bottle from Whole Foods Raleigh"
" The body of this beer is a fairly thick, but not nearly as sticky as most of the barleywines on the market. A fairly pronounced dryness can be detected long after the finish. This is a fairly drinkable beer, and although it's certainly evident that it is high in alcohol, it remains pretty smooth. This year's batch may need a few more months to soften the rough edges, but it's off to a promising start."
"John Barleycorn is a barleywine that doesn't get a whole lot of buzz. If I lived in Mad River's distribution area, I'd buy a sixer every year and would do a killer vertical tasting every now and again. This is good stuff that is disappearing remarkably quickly."
"Overall: A very decent barleywine with a lot of complex character happening there."
"Mouthfeel is a thick medium with light carbonation. The burn from the abv is not very enjoyable to me. Not enough flavor to complement it , imo. I will let the other five bottles I have sit for a while in the cellar before I come back to this one."
"Pours cloudy, medium brown with thin lacy off-white head. Smells malty and sweet with maple syrup or molasses and a touch of alcohol. The initial flavor is malty and very sweet with only slight balancing bitterness. The aftertaste is malty and lightly sour. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, slightly oily, and pretty smooth. This beer is a little sweet for my taste, but nice to split a 12 oz. bottle. I suspect it may improve with age, mellowing the sweetness.."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some dry and bitter hops also noticeable. Taste is a balance mix between some sweet malt and some bitter and citrusy hops. I personally like more malt heavy barley wine then hoppy barley wine so this was not necessarily for me. Body is about average with some good carbonation and no sign of alcohol."
"A good barleywine I'd like to lay down for a few years and try again."
"Drinkability: Paired very well with the movie ""The Lost Weekend""."
"This beer has all the balance and complexity I had hoped to find in Bigfoot."
" for this nice brew, sent for my BA annv."
"The 9.0 abv is evident here, not a bad one to sip a bottle or 2, but after that, move on! A bit pricey at $12 a sixer (my biggest bitch about this beer)"
"From a 12oz botle, this poured shockingly dark, although the deep crimson color shows up if you hold it to light. Theres little life to it and almost no head. The aroma is sugary sweet, syrupy and molasses-like. This is extremely rich, sugary and full-flavored, definitely a dessert beer. To my palate of limited range, Id be forced to say that raisin is the predominate flavor here, although theres also a tingle of hoppy pine/resin, along with the strong baked sugar strength of the alcohol. (#2770, 4/8/2007)"
"Drinkability- Overall a very tasty barleywine. More of a malt bomb than based on hops. Very drinkable."
"A ruddy and hazy dark bronze with a nice ring of lacing that stays alive with each sip. Pleasant webbing and foamy head. This year's harvest reaps apples, plums, grapes, and perhaps a very slight hint of grapefruit. The taste is very smooth, much smoother than what I remember of last year's offering. With a bitterness that quickly and quietly disappears. A back and forth between sweetness and bitterness with each sip, mellowing more as the drink warms. Very light and foamy in the mouth that eases down quite nicely. Very drinkable for the genre because of its smoothness and relaxing character. Far better than I had expected, this year's offering is fantastic."
"D-More drinkable than many barleywines, but once again, unless your a freak for them, you won't have more than a couple."
"Without a doubt, this is the best organic beer I've had to date. I'll be very curious to see how this ages in around three years. It's pretty delicious now, but has the potential to be amazing. It's not as in your face as many other american barleywines, but it stand up well to the competition. Recommended."
"I could see cellaring this for a few years. Of course that is if I could get it in NH. Enjoy if you can get them."
"This beer is a nice plum color with a fair hed the receded into a thin layer. The smell is a sweet combination of hops and fruit. The taste is sweet and the hops present a slight bitterness. The beer is very smooth, with only a slight sour bitterness in the aftertaste that hopefully will lay down with time. Drinkable for sure, as the bottle lists a slightly higher abv than listed here. Whatever the avb, it does not show at all. A good barleywine that should get better with time."
"Semi-recommended. If it's what you're in the mood for, it's enjoyable. Just be ready for it."
"The nose is very thin and made me work too hard, and the flavor almost did the same, but to a somewhat lesser degree. It is quite bitter, and almost refreshingly dry in the finish, but it doesn't overload the tastebuds with hop lava. The ABV is gutsy and hot, but while it hits hard, it doesn't strike as out of place. The size alone makes it worthy of caution, and the rather mundane presentation leave it moderately drinkable. So while I don't think John Barleycorn must die, he doesn't have to stop around real often either."
"A sipper for sure, but pretty good overall."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable, another treat from Zorro."
"I tend to like most of what Mad River attempts, and being local I can always get this. This was the early 2007 vintage, and they seem to have made this even better. It pours what I guess you would have to call a cross between red and brown, sort of deep mahogany color and up popped a big light tan head that settled slowly and left lots of big chunks of lacing in the glass. What actually greets you first when you take a big sniff is alcohol, then you get caramel malts, piney hops, and fruits like cherry or figs. Mouth feel is somewhat more dry than the nose would suggest. Flavors are of sweet caramel and chocolate. A very decent Barleywine, and it would be interesting so see how it would do if I could just buy a six-pack and leave it alone for a year."
"D: I would not grab this one again, it seems to come up short in every category."
"An OK Barley Wine that is of the bitter and woody type. If you like a strong woody beer then this is for you."
"drinkability: alright"
"Overall: I havent seen this one knocking around before, so it was a so-so pick-up. so-so because I like some of the Mad River Brewing beers, but not all. Im impressed by this though, its very English, and I would hate that to come across as Xenophobic or biased, but by that I mean that this Barleywine has a solid chewy toffee malt base, a restrained hop character in the middle but a lovely liquorice pine oil hop bite in the rising finish. Lovely. Didnt seem to be much in the way of yeasty detritus in this one, but Ill wager it will age for a year or two and improve for sure. $2.49 from Hollingshead Deli of Orange. Recommended."
"Notes: Winner. Very good barleywine and another product from Mad River that impresses this household. I could see laying some down for a yearly tasting. Was nice fresh!"
"Finishes warm with lingering spice and bitterness only from the acid."
"D - I've had other barleywines that have heaps more balance than this one. While this beer is still tasty in it's own right, I'd reach for many others before I would reach for this one."
"NOTE: Edited slightly after a second bottle at a later date."
"Poured out a darkish brown with a slightly reddish hue. Thick tan bubbly head that sticks around like that crazy Thankgsiving uncle. Would you leave already? Nose was bready, malt, with some alcohol, and sour cherry. Taste offered Good hop bitterness, balancing malts flavors, some alcohol, and a long bitter finish. Tastes more like a hop head's type of beer than a barley wine or malt lover's brew. Good mild carbonation, appropriate for the style. Rather dry mouthfeel and finish."
"Last swigs: Focused one trick pony of buttery cinamon crisp! Nice!"
"Pours a thick brown, though you can see some light through it, no head and a nice lace top it off. Smell is hopped for sure, but with a subtle sugary undertone, and a hint of alcohol too. Taste is not very strong at all. There is the natural piney hoppness you would expect from a barley wine, but not too strong, there is also a sugary, nuttiness about it as well. The alcohol is there, and that keeps this a sipper. It is actually nicely carbonated, and not harsh going down, has the warm feeling on the way. Overall this was a good brew, I would not mind having another and certainly kept me warm this evening."
"2006 version: Pours a cloudy brown color with some garnet highlights and a thick tan head taht retains impressively. The aroma has some piney and citrus hops upfront, along with some ripe berries (strawberry, blueberry), caramel, and a touch of alcohol. The flavor has some big citrus and pine hop flavor initially, along with a big caramel sweetness, some ripe fruit (strawberry, raspberry), a slight oakiness, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is just short of slick, with low carbonation...very drinkable for the style. A very solid Barleywine from Mad River, they're big beers seem to be pretty good."
"This ones just simple and solid. I really admire the upfront grainy nature of it. I guess another way to say it is that it is very direct. Great beer!"
"(looks in the bottom of the krug) John Barleycorn is dead."
"Nice garnet color with a slight head the quickly goes. A 2005 bottle conditioned properly. The smell is sweet malt with caramel tones but is backed up by large piney and spicy citrus hops and a bit of sulfur giving a medicine like quality to it. The flavor continues with a large chunk of bitterness but there is this tanic medicine flavor that digs at the tonuge almost numbing it to the flavors of the malt and blooming hops. This might straighten out in a year or two. The alcohol is well hidden and it has a good mouthfeel but it isn't too drinkable at this point."
"12 oz. stubby with ""Celebrating 2005 Harvest"" on the label. It pours a hazed garnet color that is a coppper/strawberry red when held to the light and topped with a small tan head that reduces to a collar with an island of foam in the center. The bouquet consists of sharp piney/citric/perfumy hops with sweet, vinous, and perhaps chocolate malts to back them up. The taste is about the same with a medium to high bitterness that brings it all together. The body is somewhat oily and coating, with a full body that leaves a long finish. Overall a pretty good barleywine, and I wish I had some more bottles for cellaring purposes."
"This gives the same impression as a nice quad, but not as filling. If I'd find this again, I'd definitely pick some up."
"1997 bottle that i was saving for a special occasion but had anyways. It had mellowed marvelously and was a magnificient aged barleywine. Reminded me of a mellow balanced cantillon open fermentation. A cloudy fruity appearance. Clearly barley and malt in taste."
"Drinkability: A little too over the top on the bitterness; lacking a good malt backbone; definitely not cloying but the beer lacks the balance between the sweet and bitter flavors that define the best barleywines; aging a couple of years certainly helps this brew"
"2005 bottling. This beer poured a hazy reddish brown color with a small tan head that lingered in the glass. The smell was malty and fruity with a spicy hop aroma in the backround. Taste was very fruity and malty with notes of caramel, rum soaked cherries, dark fruit and bitter hoppiness in the finish. However, I kept tasting a slight funky cardboard flavor that was unpleasant. This was a pretty full bodied barleywine, but it tastes like something is off and unbalanced. I gave the taste a 3.5 because of that cardboard aftertaste. I plan on aging my last 2 bottles for a year or more to see how this beer matures."
"Taste; a rather strong alcohol taste on the first sips, along with those hops, which have hints of grapefruit and pine trees. Sweet caramel and toffee, with a nice touch of cherries and figs. The alcohol presence fades quite a bit as it warms, making this quite drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium to full, and almost velvety smooth."
"Enchanting deep red color. Spotted, yet well laced film coating the surface. Aromatics of maple and honey covered dark fruits, along with a touch of caramel and toffee. The flavor, like the aroma, is much more malt accented with maple, caramel, fruit and toffee characteristics. Well balanced, not amazing, but balanced and pleasing to drink."
"Really interesting. This is a vastly underrated barleywine (all vintages) but the 2005, at least when fresh, would surely satisfy fans of more highly regarded American barleywines. This isn't thick and overpowering; the body is thinner than the barleywines from the likes of Rogue, Great Divide and Victory, but nonetheless is quite complex and enjoyable. And you can bet I'll be purchasing a few more bottles, as these age in a most interesting fashion. (Send me more '97!)"
"Don't forget to check out the label. The bottles have wonderful wood cuts on them, and they are different every season. I don't get to encounter enough organic beers, I'm really happy this one made it to my fridge."
"Drinkability is solid though high ABV, as advertised would make it tough for more than just one."
"Drinkability - Really tasty, gonna have to try and score a few more bottles of this while its still in season. Dont know as i'd chain drink em, but more then willing to drink this again!"
"Body is solidly medium, perhaps a bit light to hold all the interesting flavors. Texture is smooth and creamy nevertheless. Very sessionable for a barleywine, it doesn't overwhelm you the way an Old Ruffian or Double Bastard does. Worth trying."
"Medium body and very puckering from the sourness. Bit sticky too. This is alright for what it is, but if you're expecting a hoppy/maly barleywine you should look elsewhere."
"2005 bottle,poured a deep burgundy with a fluffy,sticky off white head that sticks to the glass as it settled,big orange and caramel aromas and as it warmed a herbal hop presence really showed thru quite nice.complex and flavorful raisin and deep orange with a light spiciness almost like gingerbread finishing quite dry.Iam not sure if this years vintage is better than pasts but this beer is vastly underated,flavorful and complex a top notch American Barley Wine."
"This year's release of Mad River's John Barleycorn Barleywine pours lagubrious mahogany with an aura of crimson radiating along the edges of my Duvel tulip glass, an appropriately regal vessel for this lumbering diva of a brew. The head rises at least an inch tall, dim white (slightly more off than off white) and has the consistency of whipped cream. The nose is softer than I expected, causing me to draw my nose so close to the beer I snorted a little bit of it -- no worries, as I think the high alcohol content (9.5%) cleared my sinuses. The smell opens with some cotton candy sweetness that segues quickly into tangerine rinds, fresh cherries, sour dough bread, a few hard shakes of black pepper; a solid coupling of hops and malts. An upper-cut of hops greets my palate upon the first taste, welling up from beneath my tongue and circling around to the roof if my mouth in a slow arc; strong flavor of grapefruit rinds encrusted with brown sugar. The middle brings out the hop bitterness even further, to a puckering degree, but it quickly recedes into the finish where the malt sweetness -- maraschino cherries, fruit cake, gingerbread -- has more room to move. Alcohol is warmth is evident as a warming factor at the back of my throat, but doesn't intrude into the taste. The mouthfeel is dense and chewy -- sticks to the ribs."
"When I reviewed this beer 3 years ago (the 2000 bottling) it was nice, but a bit aggressive; and I noted that I felt it would take a few years of aging. It was 2 years old then, it's 5 now, and I'm happy to say that I was correct in my analysis. It still looks like mud from all of the yeast, but it has mellowed a bit, and it still retains almost of the nice fruitiness, hops, and maltiness that it started with. Still, I'm not sure the results are worth the wait... maybe I should have given it 10 years!"
"Mouth: Not completely full but very smooth."
"It is a good experience, so if you see a bottle give it a shot, who knows what you will think."
"Very drinkable, however, not one of the best I've ever had. I had fun drinking it as I always do, and I'd suggest trying it out."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thick offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a warm, malty scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. It has a mild hop aroma; nothing over the top. It has a nice scent, but nothing too incredible. The taste is decent also. It has a run of the mill malt bill. It showcases crystal and roasted malts. It's slightly sweet with a bitter hop finish. It warms you up a bit, but it doesn't really impress me. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good brew, but nothing I would go out of the way to find. I like the flavor and aroma, but it lacks originality."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" light tan head over the slightly cloudy reddish brown brew. Head fades is reasonably resilient, with average to good lacing for the style. Aroma is sweet malts, dark fruit, and alcohol. Taste is a quick shot of sweetness upfront, quickly giving way to a hoppiness, and then a warming presence dominates the departure. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. A stereotypical american barleywine, which is what it is advertised as. We have sweet malts, alcohol and hoppiness, nice to see a brew fit the style..."
" Drinkability is good not good enough to become a regular in my frig but definitely good enough for you to try."
"All in all a nice offering. Not the best BW I have ever had, but very easy to drink and infinitely enjoyable."
"(had to do that...forgive me...)"
"Dark murky brown with a nice head of foam that lasted for quite a while. The aromas are of alcohol, brown sugar, herbal hops, and more. The taste followed suit with some lovely sweet alcohol flavors up front, a nice brown sugar heat in the middle, and a dry herbal hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and just right and the drinkability was good as well. Maybe i'm alone on this, but I thought this was an excellent barleywine that held up well over the past 7 years!"
"This was a 1997 harvest bottle tasted 10/7/04. This poured a murky brown with no head and no lace. Smell is sweet with a strong alcohol and vinegar scent coming from it. At this point I was pretty sure this would taste like crap. Sour, strong alcohol and vinous is about all I can say to describe the taste. A bit of sweetness some where but not enough to keep this one from puckering me up with every sip. Mouthfeel was okay and drinkability was non-existent. Maybe the years didnt take kindly to this one, but this is the first beer that made me involuntarily twitch with almost every sip. Hopefully I can come across a much younger bottle next time."
"This poured a reddish dark brown with a minimal head. What got me about this BW was the smoothness of the main body. This is not a huge beer but rather almost an Old Ale. Don't age this too long as the flavours are blended well now. Very food friendly."
"Poured a dark red with a small white head that subsided quickly. The aromewas of fruity esters and s touch of alcohol. The taste was not very good at all. It was sweet but in the finish there was a strange lingering bitterness that was unpleasent. The body was light for an ale of this gravity. This barleywine needs to be aged at least two more years."
"Burgandy tone. Thin beige head. Aromas of caramel and tropical fruits like pineapple and mango. Flavor follows suit. Sturdy caramel malt flavor balanced nicely with bright hop flavors or citrus and resin. Bitterness is even keeled and nice. Alcohol held in check. This is flavorful, drinkable, good..."
"An excellent barleywine. The hops are still a bit rough around the edges at this early age, but this one should age with grace."
"Source: Liquid Solutions"
"A murky brown, but an amazing aroma. It is quite fruity with notes of cherry and apricot and a slight hoppiness. Its full body is quite complex and malty. There noticeable alcohol in the finish and just enough bitterness to balance the sweet tastes. I think that this beer would age very well and would like to try it again in a few years."
"The taste is a sweet, rich kiss of malty goodness. A full, rounded breakfast of grain fills the mouth without having too heavy a body. The sensation of alcohol is apparent, but not quite like a single malt. Also, instead of peat flavors, this beer is complimented by an orchard tart from the yeast. Overall quite nice, and a pleasant surprise for an organic ale."
"On the verge of becoming something highly interesting and drinkable already."
"Not a bad winter beer. It does mellow you out."
"Pretty small tan fizzy head that quickly dissipates to a very sparse sprinkling of a lace. Dark brown in color with a slight haze. Aroma is not overly abundant, but is primarily of malt  a little bit caramel, very light hops, and what seems to be a bit of saltiness. Medium mouth feel, but sometimes the flavor seems a touch watered down. Malts are present in the start, but are fairly short lived. Decent hop flavor comes in towards the end with a bit of roastiness. And Im still picking up a bit of saltiness? The aftertaste lingers for a good while. Okay barley wine, but Ive certainly had better. Not very heavy, and doesnt really need to be aged, but it might help this brew. This one came highly recommended to me, but I probably wont be recommending it to anyone else."
"The beer pours from the 12 ounce bottle a somewhat hazy orange-amber color with the head pythonic in size, creamy in consistency and a toothsome light tan color, as it slowly dissipates the lace forms a thick veil to obscure the glass from prying eyes. Nose is sweet malt, light hints of fusel alcohol, caramel, quite crisp and fresh; a pleasant beer to sniff, start is ambrosial, rich in malt with the top moderate to full in feel. Finish has a unsparing acidity, the hops quite pronounced in their spicy bite, somewhat bitter and dry aftertaste, a quite nice barleywine, and Mad River a long time favorite Brewery."
"Drinkability  Very nice. This went down well for a 9.5 ABV. I will certainly buy again if given the opportunity."
"This is actually a review for the 2003 but I can't add a beer yet. The abv is 9.5%. Having been burned before by this product I noticed no one else reviewed so I took one for the team. I bought a single bottle just to be safe. Nice dark brown and opaque color with no head on the pour. Despite intense swishing there was little smell given off-only a nice subtle cotton candy smell. The taste was nice with a rich balance of malt and hop flavors. As it warmed, there was an artifical sweetener flavor that didn't sit right. To its credit, it was easy to drink. But this is also bad for the style. As a serious BW drinker, a good one should give you pause and make you reflect and take a good hour to finish. This one I killed in 20 minutes. Not repulsive but not a barley wine. Maybe as a scotch ale it will sell more. Break a 6-pack at berkeley bowl $1.25."
"Not an over the top beer, but well done in regards to the balance between bitterness and hops."
"Medium brown color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A medium bodied barley wine. A touch of grapefruit is balanced by a slight maltyness. This is a mild flavored barley wine, kind of a nice change of pace from the big in-your-face Barley wine so typical of the west coast. Well balanced. Very drinkable. Would improve with some aging. 9% alcohol not very noticeable. Very smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This was 2000 Harvest sample. I let this one warm up a bit before sampling. This beer poured a bright and clear amber/ice tea color. Had a long lasting frothy and dense white head. Heavy sweetness in the aroma. Cordial like caramel and toffee. Theres the smokiness of peated malt in the taste. The alcohol peeks through the sweet malt and other complex flavors, including fermented fruits, caramel. Perfectly carbonated and very flavorful. Also getting nice peppery/spicy notes. I enjoyed this beer. An excellent barleywine and very well made in my opinion."
"Pours a cloudy orange amber with minimal head and a fairly good amount of floaties. The aroma is very strong and sweet from a distance, but there's a definite malt smell. Up close, the smell becomes more fruity, having a definite apricot note atop the malty sweetness. The taste is like moldy,wet straw that has been sugar coated and doused with rubbing alcohol. High amounts of fusel type alcohols in this one, even after 4 years. A strong bitterness emerges on the finish. Mouthfeel is average for a barleywine. Drinkability is not good. Drinking this brings to mind cokes' review of Doggie Claws, with his apocolypse now theme and hints of napalm. The strong alcohol in this baby makes it a killer. I may try to light it and use it as a torch. Hoping for a rare gem on this purchase and I got burned."
"Tastes of sherry, buttered kettlecorn, and alcohol. Medium body, but seemed light for the style. Coats the tongue, but not the mouth. Smooth but very sweet and over the top on the alcohol taste."
"Tasted: 05/10/03"
"Not the best example of a barleywine. Aftertaste is too sour, taste is too thin and cloying."
"Drink this one at room temp."
"The color is a medium amber with not a medium head that will cling to the glass sides. The aroma is of malts and spices. The taste was malty, with a hint of spices and caramel. The after taste was creamy smooth with a good balance of sweetness and a hint of bitterness. This is my first time tasting this beer and I like it. Not the best but very passable!"
"Pours a slightly hazy ruby/amber color with a nice, creamy, tan head that sinks but leaves a nice lacing down the goblet. A nice rich malty aroma dominates with  some subdued alcohol in the background.  Intense chewy hoppiness with a slightly harsh alcohol finish to it.  Some slight fruit flavors and a little vinous quality as well.  Slightly thin for the style and not quite as warming as I would like it to be but not a bad brew either, just nothing special.  I was hoping for something that was going to be able to warm me up a little better than this but it isn't bad at all."
"Hazy, tawny bronze in hue, topped by a thin, but dense light tan head.  Sugar coated nuts and vinous sherry sweetness upfront in aroma, followed by notes of bitterscotch and deep caramel. Hints of leafy tobacco accompany the earthy and slightly woody hop nose.  Dark toffeeish sweetness hits the palate at first, then yields immediately to a citrusy hop flavor and sharp bitterness.  The muted malt character surfaces as the hop profile fades, and is dominated by butterscotch and well toasted malt.  Mild fruity esters eek in, but are nearly lost to the strong hop profile.  Lightly bodied for style, but quite dextrinous and smooth in mouthfeel. Finishes w/ a snap of sweetness and quickly fading bready malt and butter.  This has the potential to be an excellent barleywine, and is certainly worthy of cellaring.  In its current state, the drinkability is already very good-- perhaps dangerously so."
"Weirdest beer I ever had. the herb used is rosemary and I can't imagine why one would spoil an othrwise good beer with this herb. I dumped my beer down the drain as the taste was too funky for my tastebuds."
