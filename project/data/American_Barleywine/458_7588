It poured an opaque rust-reddish-orange with about an inch of creamy off-white colored head that dissipated into a thin film, leaving nice and sticky flecks of lacing all around the glass.  Smells like pear, apple, apricot, sweet malts, and a slight hint of alcohol.  Medium thick and creamy mouth feel with light carbonation, and it's definitely a sipper.  I taste malty sweetness blended with ripe pears and apricots, followed by a mild lingering hint of toffee, with mild hop bitterness staying on the palette for a while.  This beer is less than 5 months old and the hops and malts work together nicely, but I can imagine this beer might become overly sweet with too much age.  Alcohol is noticeable but it blends well considering that it's 11.5%.  Overall this is a very good barleywine, and I will be ageing the other two bottles from this four pack.","nizzle8287","Dec 06, 2014"

Pours very hazy orange copper color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, orange rind, apple, caramel, raisin, toast, brown sugar, floral, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, apple, caramel, raisin, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Light earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, apple, caramel, raisin, toast, brown sugar, toffee, floral, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent barleywine! All around great balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 26, 2013"

4.46,13.2,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"From my tasting notes on a 2012 vintage: I know barleywines are usually better with some age, but the word on Sisyphus is it is incredible fresh since it is made with a load of hops. The bottle I sampled was about 3 months old according to the bottle date, which is not a lot of aging time for a barleywine. The pungent citrus hop aroma crept out of the bottle as soon as I popped the top. The beer poured a copper color with very little head. There was a nice citrus, grapefruit hop bitterness at the front that quickly dissipated into a smooth caramel and toffee malt body. It had a full mouthfeel and medium to full body that you would expect from such a substantial brew with no harshness and not overly boozy. It is definitely a hoppy Barleywine. Maybe the 3 months took a bit of the hop edge and bitterness out of the Sisyphus because I thought it was just the right amount without being overly biting. The typical barleywine flavors were allowed to assert themselves and play nicely with the grapefruit hop undertones. A really wonderful brew that keeps Real Ale on the forefront of the Texas brewing scene.","brurevu","Beers"

Since I don't like American Barleywine (I prefer English Barleywine when I get Barleywine style beers), I probably would not buy this again.

The second and third glass (not the same night) however changed my mind. Seems the hops tame over time and an added caramelized or sweet note balances the hops. But make no mistake the punch in this barley wine is not for a "sisy."","Sven_Darinski","Jan 08, 2013"

Poured a deep yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I really enjoyed the aroma on this one as it was spot-on for the style and quite inviting while still letting you know that it packed a punch. The flavor seemed to follow suit, but didn’t really do anything else for me which was kind of a letdown. There was a nice touch of sweetness, but the alcohol presence definitely made itself known in it which hurt the overall appeal of this one for me. If you like Barleywines you owe it to yourself to try this one.","thagr81us","Jul 02, 2012"

Simple and nicely balanced with vague banana bread and orange subtleties. This barleywine approaches full bodied with peaceful carbonation with a calm, near whiskey-like feel.

On the tongue, the effervescence yields to a strong brown sugar note and syrup, which is kept interesting by the addition of a bright zesty flare of hops.

The taste starts with a nice bite of citrus and pine, followed quickly by rush of heavy caramel and toasted biscuits.

Lots of woody, sour beer, horse blanket notes in the aroma, some malt and hop, but overpowered by Brett. this is when I looked in the bottom of the glass and notiched the little round blackish brown and white chunks sitting there. This bottle is definitely infected with Brett. It's a good thing I happened to like the Brett flavor. I risked it and drank it and it was pretty tasty. A slight caramel flavor that is quickly overcome by the combination of alcohol, woody pine hop and a heavy wild Brett flavor. Nice and oaky and barnyard sour.

The taste is loads of brown sugar with sweet fruits and as expected, the '08 possesses a more defined almost cloying sweetness that has greatly subdued in the '07.

Hops linger throughout the finish, adding a nice bitterness to complement the syrupy, medium-thick body. All in all, a tasty barleywine that I'd gladly purchase again.

The head grows to almost one finger in heighth, but not until the very end of the pour, and it recedes quickly with some disorganized spots of lacing left behind. The smell of very sweet caramel and resiny hops mix as some dark fruits, yeast and grain move around underneath. A faint musty earthiness is detected. The hops don't hit upon the first sip as much as they linger throughout the palate. There's a good amount of fruity tanginess and bready sweetness which balances things perfectly, and doesn't keep the barley and pine resin from surfacing toward the end. The body lies toward the medium to heavy end, but it's goes down smooth, without much alcohol (11.5%) being noticed, and without weighing too much on the stomach. This is an exceptional barleywine that doesn't seem as extreme tasting as it's alcohol content would suggest, and whose components work in concert without individual extravagances.","stephens101","Feb 13, 2009"

Has a deep, smokey booziness like a scotch almost, reminds me of a harsh old ale in that respect. These factors are the big detractors for me. I didn't like that taste in Founder's Curmudgeon, and though a different style, I really don't care for it here either. Mellows out a bit as the beer approaches peak temperature, but definitely not the easiest drink in the world.

4.2,6.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Thanks to turbine2475 for the bottle. Pours thick and viscous and a beautiful dark orange color. Very little head but excellent lacing. I wonder if the brewery has some quality issues with this brew. Some of the reviews seem to be reviewing a different beer, and I had this last weekend at the brickstore where there was a pronounced band-aid taste. Happily, my 2007 bottle is clean and fresh tasting. Nice aromas of sweet citrus and honey, but a little light. The taste has more oomph, with the same sweet orange and honey, but with more vibrancy and the addition of some floral flavors reminiscent of wildflower honey. Not overly sweet, as there is a nice bitter flavor to balance on the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, abit sweet, but very clean and not sticky at all. Quite nice, a pleasure to drink, and no hotness at all even with the fairly big abv.","Georgiabeer","Apr 05, 2008"
3.6,-8.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, it was not bad by any means, just a little too sweet for my tasting. Maybe it was better fresh, or maybe it needs a couple years to figure it self out.

The flavor is interesting at first and then a little medicinal,aspirin and then hoppy bitterness. It seems hot but it does have a nice cinnamon flavor which is weird and as it wamrs it starts to taste better. It feels warming once it hits the stomach.

Slightly hazy orange colour. Herbal/floral aroma with mild malt and alcohol in the background. Kind of weird, but interesting. More malt in the flavour, caramel sweetness with moderate bitterness. Hop flavour was forward, again with the herbal character. Sort of reminded me of the grassy/herbal flavour of Jagermeister, just not as intense. Heavy body with fine, low carbonation. Alcohol was restrained and mostly contributed a pleasant warmth and hint of spice in the finish. Definitely not a clone of every other American BW out there.

Some light appley tartness blends well with the sugary caramel malts. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, somewhat sticky sugariness coats the mouth, creamy full feel from the large malt content and low levels of creamy carbonation. Some alcohol warmth in the finish as well.

Slightly silky on the tongue, refined malts with a little carmel and toffee. Well balanced with the hops, which are tough to discern. Ends with a really nice warmth.

This variant almost seems to be a different beer to me. Drink ability is still there but I'm more hessitent with it now, Not something you want to over drink in a session, and hard to go through fast (I got to the bar late and it was one of two places in Texas (they said) that got a keg of the '07.

Taste exhibits sweetness firstly, fading to the fruity alcohol, which is a bit more pronounced than the nose led to believe. Lots of warming going on.

The plums come out in full force in the flavor. High piloncillo sweetness is perceived. I get touches of melon and a grassy hop finish with some nice bitterness on the back. Some alcohol warmth, but it is impressively subdued considering the gravity on this one. Good flavors here, but I'd like a little more complexity, I guess.

The 2007 exhibits almost no positive flavor; but given the time it's been sitting around since it was bottled, maybe in Majestic Liquor's coolers, maybe not, I can sympathize (this is supported by my review in 2007). The 2008 does have some good fresh hops, but not even enough for an American Pale Ale... so maybe it's an English Barleywine? I still think it's weak.

Smell is toffee, caramel, hints of fruit and alcohol lurking-hops are understated but have a nice bit of pine/citrus aroma to them. Tastes like the smell-fairly sweet with the toffe and brown sugar and almost being too sweet and then being rescued by some piney hops that finish in the back of the throat.

Nose is heavy with fusel alcohol, sweet with malt and hints of sugar, light hop spiciness also noted, and a sure presage of whats to come, start is sweet with a thick grain presence and the top middling in its feel to the palate.

4.2,6.6,4,4,4,5,4.5,"A gentle pour from a longstanding bottle delivers a hazy, reddish-amber body beneath a creamy head of ivory colored foam. As far as barleywines go, the head retention is good, and it leaves some nice splashes and spots of lace about the glass. The nose is bright with floral, fruity and leafy hops over a rich, sweet, light-caramel and biscuity maltiness. It's quite smooth and creamy in the mouth with a full body and a very fine-bubbled, natural carbonation from bottle-conditioning. Malt and hops balance each other superbly in the flavor! Gently caramelish malt is peppered with spicy and piney hops; and then softened by floral hops; always backed by a solid bitterness. It's not overtly complex, but it's rich and satisfying in a big way. Alcohol, however, starts to become apparent after a few sips; and bitterness begins to build in the throat beyond that. Still, it's well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Nov 12, 2004"

3.98,1,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Cheers to Fly for procuring me a bottle of this rare Texas barley wine. Moderately aromatic, floral, fruity and quite lively with a nice equal balance between malt and hops along with a bouquet of apricot, pine, dough, more dough and baked bread. Rich malts (caramel, raisins, fruits) combine with a healthy hop level (pine, apricot, grapefruit, lemon, herbs) which leads into a superb, dry and lingering bitterness. After a quick vibration in the mouth, like a cell phone, more flavor consumes my palate. Its more of an apple/butter toffee flavor. Very well hidden alcohol. Creamy, coating mouthfeel. Im a sucker for a good barley wine and this one did it for me. Thanks again Fly.","Crosling","0"
4,1.5,4,4,4,3,4.5,"Hazy amber. Nice aroma, very hoppy with notes of honey and maple. I love the smoky feel in mouth which accompanies well the lemon, peaches, caramel and salt. Very hoppy as it warms, coniferous bitter aftertaste. This seemed a bit underrated to me. Now you're talking Joet!","Rastacouere","Feb 18, 2004"

4.17,5.8,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"The 10.7 percent alcohol in the ale was obvious in the nose, but didn't have quite the same warming effect in the mouth as North Coast Old Stock, tasted earlier in the evening. There had been some maturation of the flavors with age. The bitterness and floral flavors from the edgy hops still stood out from the malt, but melded into something almost reminiscent of an India Pale Ale with a kick.","TPoling","Jun 06, 2003"

3.8,-3.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Got this behemoth thanks to a trade. 2002 Bottle: Pours a murky orange color with a thin off-white head that disappeared rather quickly. Strong alcohol and malt in the nose. Flavor packs a real punch, especially as it warms. Fruity alcohol flavor with a decent malt balance. As strong as this beer tastes, I still think it is balanced quite well. I bet the cask-conditioned version of this beer rocks.","Dogbrick","Dec 17, 2002"
3.7,-6.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Cloudy yellow-brown with lots of suspended sediment. Head is fairly large, off-white and perhaps an inch thick; several minutes after pouring at least a quarter of an inch remains with quite prominent thick lace. The aroma is utterly dominated by the strong alcohol, strong bitter grapefruit hops notes are also present, along with fruity esters. Taste yields sweet malt flavors, fruit flavors (pears?), quite rough alcohol notes and bitter grapefruit hops which linger on long past the end of the taste. This particular sample has been cellared for about six months; so it seems that if it is to mellow, some greater inverval of time will be required. Still, as a Texan, I have to admire the fact that a Texas brewery has taken up the challenge of producing a barleywine ale.","Pegasus","Beers"
3.67,-6.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Cloudy medium brown with a moderate head. Fades to a nice weather patten. I'm not seeing the presence of alcohol in the aroma like has been mentioned by others. A seet malt dominates the nose along with somethign like strawberries past their prime and maybe a slight bit of banana. The alcohol kicks in a bit in the flavor and seems unbalanced at first combined with the bitter grapefruit peel hops but fades into the malt further into the glass. The alcohol is only truly noticed by the mild burn as it travels to the stomach. The mouthfeel is actually a bit soft and with the alcoholic warmth make this a comforting beer, great for relaxing. The only real drawback is the malt is slightly unbalanced by the bitterness of the alcohol and hops. I'm glad that I have two bottles so that I can see how this turns out in a year or two.","aracauna","0"
