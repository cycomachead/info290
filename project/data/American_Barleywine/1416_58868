3.85,-2.3,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"750mL bottle. Bottled 02/20/15. Pours a murky dark brown with over an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Boozey aroma with some oak, vanilla, toffee, caramel, brown sugar and a hint of hops. The taste is toffee, caramel, brown sugar with a hint of vanilla. Somewhat boozey. More bourbon flavor near the end. Some citrus hops as well. Finishes with more burnt brown sugar and wood. Lots of carbonation. Not a whole lot of flavor from the barrel but there is some. Overall, a decent enough beer I'd grab once in a while.","PicoPapa","Mar 19, 2015"

4.1,4.1,4,4,4.25,4,4,"A bit darker than I expected, deep reddish color with a nice tan head.  Smells like toffee and vanilla, slight citrus.  Dried fruit, a little bourbon, caramel, and grapefruit on the tongue. Carbonation cuts nicely through the blue cheese I'm eating with it. This bottle was a bit over two years old when I opened it.  Glad I waited, as it seems many people seem to think the hops are overpowering when fresh.  Flavors were nicely mellowed and quite enjoyable. Barrel character was definitely present but not overpowering. Haven't had this one fresh, but the way it drinks at this age, I'm happy with an old bottle.","jds16","Mar 06, 2015"

Nice dried stone fruits and brown sugar in the nose.  Taste follows with dried fruit, raisins, cherry, hints of bourbon and some alchohol, but unfortunately it has a slightly unpleasant bitterness that is somewhat different that a hoppy bitterness.  It might appeal to some but detracted from the beer for me.  Mouth is substantial, slightly viscous, sweet, but not quite cloying.

Aroma is unexpected with huge lemony citrus peel and not much else. Flavor follows with more big lemons--like chewing on the fruit--and very light caramel. Really not much else going on here, and while the flavor is only described as lemony, it isn't particularly bitter either. Maybe I'm drinking lemon Pinesol? Light to medium bodied--strange for a barleywine, particularly one aged in barrels--with medium plus carbonation. This was weird. Pretty much the exact opposite of expectations going in on a BA Barleywine. I can't say it was bad, just not right.","BMMillsy","Jul 14, 2014"

4.53,15,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A big bottle and my Friday after work is looking all good. Poured into a snifter, there is a noticeable cork pop and a lot more head than I expected from a barley wine. It is black in color and the head is huge, rocky, and light tan. Very, very nice looking. The smell is apricots, molases, vanilla, a slight hoppiness, and my mouth is watering. The taste is phenomenal, with boozy fruit, wood, vanilla and a slight banana in there somewhere. It is dry but not too much so, with a noticeable alcohol warmth as it goes down. The hops are there just at the very start and then its all wood aging from there. You taste it, you smell it, and you really get the sense that the aging process rounded off the sharp edges on this. Really, really spectacular. The mouthfeel is pleasantly carbonated and a tad sticky. Overall, I think this is a fantastic barley wine. It is not sweet like most. It could, if anything, use a bit more sweetness and a bit less woody dryness but wow, just really terrific.","roblowther","Mar 28, 2014"

Color is a clear cherry amber with a couple of lazy bubble trails. Aroma is a heavy, hop, malt, fresh sawn wood, resin, black olives. Flavor's like nose, bitter and tang up front, with a little malt and bourbon sweet, hints of dark chocolate. Body/carbonation are excellent. Finish is like flavor, the bitter hop veers a tad off, alcohol warmth, but still great sipping beer. Perfect to share with friends who are of the same mind.","drpimento","Dec 05, 2013"

I would buy this again for a night with friends who are into big beers but may not have delved into the extravagant. This is a good step up, but not a mind blower. I would drink this again, but may not buy it for personal enjoyment. Glad I had the barleywine and the barrel aged as well though, a great adventure.","Misanthropy_Sipping","Aug 04, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, raisin, orange zest, apple, floral, light pine, orange rind, grass, toast, brown sugar, light chocolate, oak, light bourbon, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of malt and hop notes with light-moderate barrel notes. Taste of caramel, raisin, orange zest, apple, floral, toast, brown sugar, light chocolate, oak, light bourbon, light pine, light clove, grass, and floral earthiness. Light amount of floral citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, floral, toast, light pine, brown sugar, light chocolate, oak, light clove, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of malt and hop flavors with light-moderate barrel presence; with a nice bitterness/sweetness balance for the style and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a slick, lightly syrupy, and sightly sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent American barleywine. All around very nice balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors with a fair amount of barrel presence; and quite smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 16, 2013"

Light bourbon and oak midway through with a hint of vanilla and a healthy dose of hop bitterness and ethanol long into the finish. Medium to thick body with a sweet hot mouthfeel and a light to moderate level of carbonation. This one wowed me at first but as it warmed the alcohol heat did start to get a little harsh.

Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is nice, it smells like caramel, dark fruit, toffee, bourbon and vanilla. The brew tastes like caramel, toffee, dark fruit, wood, bourbon, and there's also some citrusy hops and a bit of an herbal flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's syrupy and coating with good carbonation. The bourbon in this brew is noticeable, but it's not very strong in either the aroma or flavor. I do think that it's still a good brew, but I was expecting a little more bourbon kick from it.

Broad nose, really fills out, very sweet with ginger, nutmeg, vanillin oak, butterscotch, molasses, there’s some charcoal to peat like notes in there, green apple, pear, fig and white grape scents in there, more rye or buckwheat than loaf of bread type stuff, at times smells like a baseball rosin bag, turns more roasted than hoppy at the end. Full-bodied, does a good job of being dry in texture while sweeter in flavors, the oak treatment obvious throughout. Vanilla, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar and flan flavors predominate, yet there’s also a bitterness which comes through bringing nuts, smoked grill fat, cigar leaf, citrus peel and wheat germ to the fore. The fruit diminished and receded back. The carbonation bigger than was suggested visually but nothing more than a basic simmer. Stays on an even keel through the finish, no great change.

4.3,9.1,4,4,4,5,5,"Super thick and chewy. Effervescent carbonation. Sweet vanilla and dark fruits on the tip of the tongue with mild roasted caramel coffee that rides onto the mid-palate. These subtle flavors explode into a crescendo of giant pungent flavors of oak bourbon spice and alcohol which doesnt so much attack the palate as it does kind of round out the the more subtle beginning. Really quite a ride but in actuality more elegant than it comes off, but that could be the touch of age on it. The bourbon barrel influence is just enough to compliment the other flavors in the beer rather than attack and overpower them. My only complaint is the highly noticeable alcohol content but at 11.1% it's hard to hide. Extremely complex and subtle yet packed with flavor. Elegant yet filled with surprises. For an easy to find barrel aged beer, pretty damn good.","jtierney89","May 06, 2012"

The aromas are rich and malty, with some maple and tangy caramel blendings, a subtle boozey note, along with an overall roasted character. Flavors are rich and layered, with a caramel-chocolate blending initially, followed by layers of rich, malty characters, including some leaning towards a fruit sweetness. The smooth body is full, but actually kept in check by the increased ABV. Roasted, richly sweet aftertaste leads into a slick, slightly astringent and boozey finish. The increased alcohol content also keeps the sweet and malty profiles from becoming overpowering or cloying. Very decent barleywine.","GarthDanielson","May 02, 2012"

Pours a dark red, with a huge 3 inch off white head with red highlights, with plenty of lacing, and takes its time settling. Smell is lots of cooked brown sugar, bourbon, dark fruit, piny hops, and vanilla oak. Taste is powerful, balanced with everything from the nose. With bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit , and oak being the dominant flavors, but a bitterness in the finish that suggest bitter hops. This is really impressive, one of the most beautiful beers I have ever looked at and I love that it is a beer that blends wonderful with the bourbon not being the only true flavor. Body is large, nice carbonation especially for its heft, not that dry considering the style, and very drinkable for a beer of this magnitude. This Brewery is really impressive.

Appearance is a hazy tawny, zero head, zero lacing. The nose features a rich maltiness with shades of oak and molasses. The bourbon is very faint and contributes nothing more than a mellow vanilla accent at the end. The taste starts off very malty with huge notes of caramel and molasses. The bourbon makes itself more present as the taste develops on the palate. The balance is impeccable considering the weight of this brew. There is no burn whatsoever and it drinks as if it is much lighter. This beer suffers in the mouthfeel department. Again, the carbonation is nearly nonexistent which hurts the over all quality. The body is hefty enough. Overall, this beer tastes as if it is a fine recipe and even a decent bourbon barrel aged version of one, but in its current form, I am quite disappointed.","homebrew311","Mar 16, 2012"

Slightly boozy aroma, woody/breadiness is there, minor sweetness from roasted chocolate and caramel but not getting that much vanilla. A great medium-bodied brew that is really smooth thanks to the barrels - sturdy bread malt base that is complemented w/ chocolate, touches of caramel/vanilla and very minor candi-fruit tastes or something akin (not quite tropical fruit). Finish is crisp like touches of citric hops and spices; this with carbonation seems to prick the toungue on the backbite. ABV becomes noticeable at the end and this beer even starts to warm you up; really enjoyed the sweet flavors and robust malts balancing and the touch of hops as well.","clayrock81","Feb 17, 2012"

3.8,-3.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured from 750mL bottle into a 5 oz. snifter. This pours to nearly an apple cider appearance, but with a red tinge to it. Because I used a small snifter, I didn't give this a very vigorous pour, and as such, it didn't render much of a head. The nose on this is so very rich and bold. It's laden with notes of scorched caramel, malt, roasted figs, and grape distilled wine. The bourbon and woodiness from the barrel also make an appearance in the bouquet. I poured this cold, so I've let it warm up to allow some of the subtleties to liven up a bit. The taste is about as heavily influenced by the bourbon barreling as any beer I've had. Heavy on bourbon, caramel, and vanilla. As a person who also appreciates good whiskey, this is almost a "tweener," to me. This is truly a sipper. The mouth feel is on the dry side, and I really don't mind it. And while I'd consider it boozy, I wouldn't consider it hot. The alcohol is ever present throughout a single taste, but it's neither astringent nor does it seem like an 11.10% ABV beverage. Overall, this is nicely done. Wonderful, wonderful example of the style...and excellent regardless of the style.","Retail1LO","Nov 01, 2011"

You get a lot of sweetness between sweet malts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, and light bourbon barrel off notes. The bourbon is very subtle and subdued. I like more bourbon from the style. It drinks really, really sticky and is a lot like the other beers that I've had from Uinta, very malt driven.

I was a little disappointed in the lack of bourbon in the nose and flavor, but I love barrel aged beers with a strong bourbon note. As others have noted, the bourbon is there, it's just plays a minor role.

The smell and taste of this beer shows no evidence of bourbon or barrel aging. There is also a weird thing going on where the taste is robust upon first sip but quickly drops off on the tongue.

This is definitely an American Barleywine as the hops are present, but it has a great malty caramel background with toffee notes. Good barrel characteristics in this one but they play more of a background role than in other BA barleywines I've tried.

I can't help but feel that many have underestimated this offering and it is by far my favorite product from Uinta's little side project. I can't help a lot of things, like global warming (it's actually climate change, not necessarily warming), the vagaries of the stock market (it's all voodoo baby), the popularity of talentless fucks (yeah, I'm looking at you Rid Rock, Gaga, and Bieber) or my overwhelming desire to sleep with Salma Hayek (my wife never reads these reviews, with my luck she'll read this one).","Naugros","Jul 05, 2011"

Bitter earthy hops on the finish and some oak tannins. Bourbon comes through in the middle and falls off quickly after that. Thick with raisin and prune flavors, and the date and fig at the front and middle palate round things out. Oak flavors linger long in the finish and pester the tannins which is a bit odd.

The flavor is quite good as well...it's drier than the smell leads you to believe. Although it's also a little mismatched between bitterness and maltiness.

Only a very faint presence of oak and vanilla give hint to the barrel aging, no noticeable bourbon - just alcohol. Medium bodied, light for the style.

Retention is off the charts, and when the foam cap finally does creep down it leaves a near solid wall of lacing left behind. The nose is of burnt sugar and vanilla, with an appreciable bourbon presence as well. There's also a small amount of solvent alcohol in the aroma, which spoils things just a bit. The flavor is a little more polished, there's no real booziness to it, but it's also a fair bit more dull. The malt flavors don't pack nearly enough punch, but the base is more toffee than brown sugar. Any overt bitterness is blotted out by the malt, but there's definitely a grapefruit and pine pacific northwest hop flourish on the back end. The level of carbonation is spot on, just shaded a touch to the low end of the spectrum. The body though passes through being a bit light for the style and crashes into watery.

The aroma has big oak notes moving into bourbon and sweetness along with some boozy heat. I don't pick up much, if any, of the base barleywine here. The taste is pretty smooth with a brief pulse of sweet chewy malts and some cherry and plum notes. It then becomes very oak with full-on bourbon and booze drying things out into the finish. Lots and lots of barrel notes going on here squashing out most of the beer-y barleywine flavors.","BigMcLargeHuge","Feb 13, 2011"

The bourbon and wood flavors are mild enough that they don't hog too much of the spotlight, and they shouldn't overwhelm even the more timid of palate.

This one pours a translucent dark ruby brown topped by a finger or so of thick, creamy ecru foam. The nose dives right into the bourbon and oak, with some maple syrup, citrus hops, vanilla bean and caramel backing that up. The taste is heavier on the hops and adds a bit of leather to the proceedings as well. Beyond that, there are hints of burnt biscuits, oak, bourbon, molasses, and orange rind. The body is a heavy medium, with a moderate carbonation and a thick, gooey feel. Overall, a solid BBBW; it didn't really live up to my expectations, but they were pretty damn high to begin with.
