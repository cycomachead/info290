I believe this beer must have been left on the shelf in a high light area since 2010. It looked great, but the paper and tobacco really ruined the flavor.","mverity","May 24, 2014"

A tight beige head is well retained and provides a curtain of lacing as the beer is consumed. Lush, rich malt aromas provide the senses with hints of cherries and plums. Piney hop aromas also join in with some caramel and a touch of booze to round out this wonderfully aromatic brew. This Barley Wine ages with beauty and grace! The malt complexity is much more defined, with the dark fruits taking the lead with caramel and toffee sweetness playing an important role as well. Generous hopping has helped to maintain some of the piney profile and cover a bit of the alcohol burn. Medium-full in body, this 5 year-old brew is lower in carbonation.","phishsihq","Jun 05, 2013"

It was my lady's very first experience with the style and she was completely blown away. My beer geek pal and I are a tad jaded and weren't exactly blown away, but it was still an excellent representation of the style. He and I both recently had our tongues scraped raw by a fresh 2013 Bigfoot and were very pleased to be able to spend some time enjoying a really good barleywine with a bit of age on it. The rest of the 2013 Bigfoots (Bigfeet? Bigs Foot?) have been sequestered in deep storage to avoid any further unpleasantness and to hopefully achieve the blissful state that others report is possible. But this Pilot Series effectively wiped away the memory. Will definitely be seeking out another bottle or two for safe keeping.","JamesQuaff","Mar 26, 2013"

As i searched deeper, i found this beer to be complex and full of layers. A variety of awesome dark fruits, leather, vanilla, apple cider, and warming booze, that had me checking the bottle to make sure it's not BA (...it's not.) As it warms, sweet malts become more apparent and apple cider begins to take over for the dark fruits. Hop presence is really only apparent in burps, but you get a faint grapefruit bitterness only after the beer has warmed to almost room temp, I'm glad i waited to review this until after the second glass, it's full of glorious floaties and so much more complex flavors have shown themselves, allowing me to write a full review. My local liquor store still has about 8 bottles of this and i plan on grabbing atleast 2 more to see how this brew turns out 1-2 years from now.","Chris_Cali_2o9","Nov 25, 2012"

4.02,-3.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Alaskan Barleywine pours a very deep brown, with a decent amount of ruby highlights. Just under two fingers of light tan foam rise up and crown the beer. Head retention is decent, and there's just a little bit of lacing. The nose is nice, with aromas of caramel, fruity esters, and grapefruit all swimming out of the glass. The malt presence that first greets me with each sip is a well defined toffee flavor. Some dried figs and apricots swim through mid palate. The finish features a potent hop bite and a dank, grapefruit peel hoppiness. The hops are holding up fairly well so far, keeping this firmly on the American, rather than English half of the barleywine spectrum. The body, while sturdy, isn't as full and syrupy as some others. While part of me likes that in a barleywine, this does help a lot with drinkability. Carbonation is suitably understated. Alaskan Barleywine is drinking really nicely right now. I think it may be heading towards an awkward phase as it transitions from hop forward to malt forward, but I just find myself wishing I had another bottle to see what this brew's like after it has finished that transition.","axeman9182","Oct 22, 2012"

Hops smells like a combination of English and northwest hops. Not listed on the website--just a guess. Dark cherry, figs, raisins, and a strong caramel malt--but still hangs below the hops. Heavy fruit and alcohol continue in the taste to support a strong hop bite. While not a lightweight ale, the beer has a subtle balance between big hop, malt and alcohol.

Two-plus and three-plus years of aging on each of these has done them beer no injustices, they are both amazing. Lovers of this style must seek out and sample this beer. I am glad I have more aged versions and a fresh 2010 to compare in the near future to compare and contrast.

Mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip quickly dissipates. A lower level of carbonation makes for a smooth and sticky mouthfeel. A bit of alcohol warmth in the back of the throat with each sip. Overall, this is a good barleywine that I can only imagine will get better with age.

The taste is, wow - crazy smooth. The hops are present only a touch in the finish and balance the medium sweetness present in the base of the beer. This is just dead-on balance, not too sweet and not overly hopped. The reserved flavor of sugary malts carry through the body. Fabulous not in extreme flavor, but actually in its restraint. The mouthfeel has good carbonation and not too sugar coating and thick. Very good in this department as well. Overall, this beer as an 08 is fantastic, with no booze present and incredible balance. In general, American Barleywine with 2 years of age seems to be just the dead-on sweet spot where the hops are faded, but still a balancing presence against the potential for over sweetness. The Arctic Devil 08 I had a while back at 2 years pulled this off similarly.","seeswo","Apr 20, 2011"

It's vaguely disappointing, because Alaskan seems to do better balancing their beers than they've done with their Barley Wine Ale. The end effect is that the beer tastes too simple, and too heavy on the hops for my tastes. That's not to say I couldn't finish the bottle - you barely realize there's alcohol in this beer at all, it's so well hidden.

Rich, intense dark fruit aromas blended with a little booze, very warm. Creamy, mildly carbonated body suits the flavors nicely. Very rich, smooth hop and malt characters. It has characteristics of Sierra Nevada's Big Foot, but darker, though, not sweeter. You can tell from the aging processes that this beer had some more hop character when it was fresh, however it's not a bad thing. The overall flavor character is mild, although still pretty good. This is one of the better american barleywines because it's not this hop bomb with a malt back bone that makes a 22oz serving rather hard to finish. This one is I've had this fresh and liked it a lot. I'm glad I noticed the vintage date on this beer. A year is not overkill for aging this beer, it has mellowed out nicely, but any long and it might be too mellow.","100floods","Dec 13, 2010"

The malt sweetness doesn't completely dominate the bitterness as there is just enough to temper the malt and keep it from becoming overly cloying. There is a lingering, herbal, almost menthol note as well as a firm bitterness. The malt sweetness accentuates flavors of candied citrus peel, concentrated red currants, as well as toasted, toothsome, whole grain malt flavors.

Smell is brown sugar, caramel, slight pine, and amarillo hops. Taste is more like and engish barleywine than American. Strong malt base of sugary caramel. Very light hops for an 'American' barleywine but this leaves a void in the taste progression that the alcohol fills nicely. It's not too harsh though, no burn at all. I will admit that american barleywines like old guardian have destroyed my palate for well crafted, smooth beers like this.","jgap","Jan 29, 2009"

The malt is strong and sweet without any off flavors. There's a lot of caramel and a lot of barley flavor. The hops are still strong but less bitter than flavorful. The hops come through piney and maybe citric or floral. It's hard to tell exactly. It's relatively close to Old Guardian, but it's been awhile since I had one of those. The feel is exquisite, full, velvety, warming. Alcohol warms the mouth and brightens the flavors. There are some notes of honey, but it could be my imagination. It's a delicious beer, a satisfying barleywine.","popery","Jan 22, 2009"

There is still some sweetness, but it is balanced with some hop bitterness that is quite citrusy and produces a long bitter aftertaste tempered by some fruity sweetness.

The nose is of dark fruit and subtle sweet malt with a great balance of hop. The taste reflects the nose. Sweet and malty up front with lots of sugar and dark fruit taste. Hops come through the middle clear yet subtle and not very bitter. Hops rise through the finish and start to bitter a bit. On the finish the hop bitterness covers the inside of the mouth and sweet sugars reside on the lips. This is a very balanced barleywine that deserves alot of respect. The mouthfeel is nice and quite thick and chewy. Syrupy almost, defenitely a desert beer. Drinkability is quite high IMO, as the balance is something to be marveled at. This along with the smoked porter are unquestionably (IMO) alaskan brewings best offerings. So glad I can finally put a case in the cellar!!!
