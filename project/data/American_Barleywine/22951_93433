The flavor has a lot more going on, with brown sugar, vanilla, citrus, and a hint of dark fruit.  There is a slight earthy, woodsy hop flavor going along with the large malt and yeast notes.  Really nice flavor for a barleywine and certainly a solid part of the clown shoes lineup.

4.07,4.1,4.25,4,4,4,4.25,"Notes: Sampled at cellar temperature. Beautiful looking glass of beer: clear deep copper body with orange highlights beneath a massive head of frothy yellowish tan that slowly drops to a fairly thick, sudsy covering. Wide splashes and craggy, broken walls of lacing are left behind on the glass. Distinctly caramelish malt as expected in the nose with a bit of fruit (apricot, tangerine, nondescript citrus) as well, and some background raspy hops (or is that spiciness from the alcohol? Or a combination with the citrus edge?). As an ""American"" barley wine I would expect more hop aroma, but the very moderate amount that's there is OK. Medium-full in body... or should that be full-medium? Decidedly dextrinous and creamy with a very fine-bubbled moderate carbonation - thank goodness as too many barley wines are over-carbed these days, 'thinning' the malt and amping up the perceived bitterness with carbonic acid... this softer carbonation works really well to accentuate the malt. And malt is what it's about here, although there are more hops in the flavor, and some clear alcohol (which seems to be the only fault, with some higher alcohols). Rich, with a combination of golden and darker caramel notes that make me think of the color red, not that red is a flavor, but that's how I perceive it - I guess meaning that it's a midway point between the golden and the dark (?). The malt is the main component, but it's malt that's threaded through with hop flavor: dank, slightly resinous, and citrusy (clementine, lemon zest)- almost berry-like in a way (perhaps Simcoe?). But again, as an ""American"" barley wine it still seems a little light. The balance, however, is quite good; and overall it shines. Given the price of $8.99/22 oz. bottle (and I know you can find it cheaper) it's hard to argue against.","NeroFiddled","Jan 10, 2015"

4.04,3.3,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Bomber slowly decanted into a tulip glass over the course of an evening. Really quite a looker, a ruby red brown admixture with a well-formed mocha colored head and a rather appealing aroma of well-toasted malts (almost reminds one of burnt popcorn), strong hazelnut, raisins, apples, pears, and some grapefruit, tangerine, and faint pine from the bold hop regime. All the expected elements are there and well-integrated. Some folks have described this as ""hot"" or ""young"" in terms of the alcohol flavor and although you can taste the booze, I might have snagged a well-aged example as this ain't too hot at all (but see below). The alcohol flavor peeks out here and there, with the whole package bitter and resinous plus sweet in equal measure. Lots of orchard fruit, butterscotch, nuts, golden raisin, and molasses kiss candy with an astringent tea bag note that comes on strong late. IPA-like hopping in the finish, which veers towards the harshly medicinal but does remain rooted in dried citrus peel and pine territory. Standout features for me include the malt complexity, nuttiness, classic barleywine orchard fruit elements, and assertive hop flavors. If there's a drawback its that things do get a tad harsh late into a bomber, which is probably a good reason to share this sucker with some appreciative aficionados. Still, a welcome introduction to this new to Alberta contract brewer for me.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 03, 2014"

A slow sipper, to be sure, as duly noted already, but once past that simple physical limitation, all bets are off.","biboergosum","Jul 08, 2014"

4.02,2.8,4.25,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 05/09/14. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a brown/ruby red color with about an inch off-white head that stayed around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like caramel, toffee, dark fruit, bready malt and some citrus peel. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like caramel, toffee, candied oranges, bready malt, dark fruit, and some citrusy and pine hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and has moderate carbonation. And for the most part the 11% ABV is well hidden. I thought this was good, I wouldn't mind buying this again in the future.","bluejacket74","0"

The body is thick, smooth, the booze does come out as there is a little heat. Malts are centerpiece as the sweetness from caramel and toffee, maybe figs, is prevalent but a good bit of balance from dry, citric hops gives this beer a varied taste profile.

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, raisin, pear, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/earthy hops and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange peel, raisin, pear, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange peel, raisin, pear, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of citrus/floral hop and dark/toasted malt flavors; with a great malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice barleywine. All around good balance and complexity of citrus/floral hop and dark/toasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV.

This beer had good drinkability, especially for the style, the 11% didn't show up as much as I expected and even with the higher bitterness it still remained pretty drinkable and I think a bomber to myself would be a good amount and I can't say that about a lot of American Barleywines. What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, this is a pretty nice example of what an American Barleywine is all about and I thought the drinkability was pretty good too. What I like the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad and it was pretty true to style, but it was just a little too sticky for me. I would buy this beer again, since it's a little heavy on the hops I don't think this would be the type of beer I would cellar, but if I could find it fairly fresh and was in the mood for the style I'm pretty sure I would get it, but it is a little pricey. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hoppier Barleywines. All in all I was happy with this beer, I was on the fence about this brewery but the more of their big bottles i try the more I start to like this them. They had a good idea to add citra hops to Barleywine while keeping it recognizable as a Barleywine and not a DIPA. Good job guys, I'll have to be on the look out for more of your big bottles to try.","StoutHunter","Sep 13, 2013"

Admittedly I'm a little let down by this because I love clown shoes and I love barleywines but worth trying if you can find it. I will try this again after some aging but I worry because its already very sweet.","MistahBeah","Aug 10, 2013"

This is defenately a brew I would buy again. I do have a 2nd I am keeping in my beer fridge to age for a while. Cheers!","Rizalini","Jul 21, 2013"

4.51,15.3,4,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Dark orange hue with minimal white head. Smell was very intense and very good. Rich mango and pineapple followed by bitter hops and ending with sweet malt. This tasted very much like an IIPA but I feel like a lot of extremely fresh american barley wines taste this way. Notes of citrus, pine, vanilla; and very hoppy. As it warmed the barley wine character came though as the sweet malt started to balance with the hops. I really enjoyed the progression of this beer over time and would like to see how it does with some age as the hops will die down considerably.","cfaulman","Jun 03, 2013"

The best compliment I can give this brew is that it has re-invigorated my interest in the style, and bolstered my love of big beer. Ultimately, the latest from Clown Shoes defies preconceived notions of Barleywines, displaying a very complex libation that is literally a journey though potent beer sensations. Very true to Clown Shoes' style in general, this is expertly formulated and the antithesis of boring. You need this beer in your life... & Drink it fresh!","Neorebel","0"
