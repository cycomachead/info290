"Great beer, I loved it! Very expensive in Mexico but itÂ´s worth it."
""
"Appearance: brilliant chestnut to garnet mahagony with a finely bubbled, lacy off white foam cap. Smell: Citrusy hoppy nose. Taste: rich, malty, some caramel, bread, cardamom to cola finishing with a big bitter hop finish balanced by the malt and alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy, big and chewy, slight warming. Overall: Reminds me of a mixed drink."
"This was an okay beer. Will definitely not get again."

"Caramel and toffee sweetness which compliments the juicy citrus flavors and herbal tea hop bitterness.  The alcohol plays the warming card, but is masked well. A solid, sweet, citrusy barleywine."

"Fine example of the style."
"Very nice barley wine, Great hop flavour thanks toe the dry hopping!"
""
""
"Pours a medium copper color with a silky smooth, creamy topping.  The aroma has a bit of fruit, caramel, and toffee.  The flavor has a lot more going on, with brown sugar, vanilla, citrus, and a hint of dark fruit.  There is a slight earthy, woodsy hop flavor going along with the large malt and yeast notes.  Really nice flavor for a barleywine and certainly a solid part of the clown shoes lineup.  I would love to see how this would age after a few years, though it wasn't too hot with alcohol even fresh."
""
""
"Notes: Sampled at cellar temperature. Beautiful looking glass of beer: clear deep copper body with orange highlights beneath a massive head of frothy yellowish tan that slowly drops to a fairly thick, sudsy covering. Wide splashes and craggy, broken walls of lacing are left behind on the glass. Distinctly caramelish malt as expected in the nose with a bit of fruit (apricot, tangerine, nondescript citrus) as well, and some background raspy hops (or is that spiciness from the alcohol? Or a combination with the citrus edge?). As an ""American"" barley wine I would expect more hop aroma, but the very moderate amount that's there is OK. Medium-full in body... or should that be full-medium? Decidedly dextrinous and creamy with a very fine-bubbled moderate carbonation - thank goodness as too many barley wines are over-carbed these days, 'thinning' the malt and amping up the perceived bitterness with carbonic acid... this softer carbonation works really well to accentuate the malt. And malt is what it's about here, although there are more hops in the flavor, and some clear alcohol (which seems to be the only fault, with some higher alcohols). Rich, with a combination of golden and darker caramel notes that make me think of the color red, not that red is a flavor, but that's how I perceive it - I guess meaning that it's a midway point between the golden and the dark (?). The malt is the main component, but it's malt that's threaded through with hop flavor: dank, slightly resinous, and citrusy (clementine, lemon zest)- almost berry-like in a way (perhaps Simcoe?). But again, as an ""American"" barley wine it still seems a little light. The balance, however, is quite good; and overall it shines. Given the price of $8.99/22 oz. bottle (and I know you can find it cheaper) it's hard to argue against."

"O:  Pretty solid for a young barleywine.  I snagged a second bottle so we'll see how this does after a year.  It is nowhere near as abrasive as fresh Old Guardian so this is pleasant to drink fresh.  Alcohol could be masked better but other than that this is a pretty good beer."
""
"D: This was more English than American, but still had a really nice scent and taste. The body was solid, but the finish was a little harsh, so it was better to sip. Would likely age well. Fresh is good, not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice Barleywine. The 18 months has mellowed the alcohol somewhat, but it still present. While not world class still very nice."
""
""
"Overall, world class barleywine this would win most blind tastings out there, can't wait to grab another bottle to store away in the cellar."

"Delicious,  solid Barleywine from Clown Shoes. Subtle in its booziness for 11%. Perfect on a cold - ass fall evening."
""
"O: Not bad, I actually kinda like the booziness, but I could see how others would be turned off.  I do think this has the potential to develop nicely with some time in the cellar.  4"

"Overall, it's a good beer, particularly as it warms.  It never comes across as overly bitter, until you've swallowed and the pucker never leaves your palate.  Alcohol is well moderated, providing just a touch of taste and a slight burn."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice classic barleywine.  Glad i had the opportunity to try it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Certainly one of the more unique barleywines I've had, though far from the best. High focus on the hop profile while the malts seem fairly generic and simple, so questionable as to how this one might age. I enjoyed it for what it was, but likely wouldn't seek it out again."

"3.53/5: Good now...will likely get better with age, unlike 'Murica"
""
"Pours a cloudy dark orange with various shades of brown. Great aroma of fig, malt, creaminess, tea leaf, roasted nut, caramel, toffee and apricot. The flavor follows suit with a ton of maltiness, i.e. tea leaf, caramel, barley and toffee. Some fruit taste of Orange syrup, fig, raisin and apricot. The flavor follows to a light boozy end but it's never overpowering. One of the better offerings from Clown Shoes."

"some hop profile in the taste makes this a unique BW. Grapefruit/pine along with the normal BW alcohol kick."
""
""
""
""
"Had this on the 4th of July and very impressed nothing from Clown shoes disappoints"
"Overall. Nice hoppy bwine."
""
"Another 'merely good' CS brew. A rather routinely good, hopped-to-the-gills barleywine. I'll enjoy it for the few more seconds that it lasts."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I recommend trying this if you are on the fence. I'm happy that I caved and picked one up."

"Bomber slowly decanted into a tulip glass over the course of an evening. Really quite a looker, a ruby red brown admixture with a well-formed mocha colored head and a rather appealing aroma of well-toasted malts (almost reminds one of burnt popcorn), strong hazelnut, raisins, apples, pears, and some grapefruit, tangerine, and faint pine from the bold hop regime. All the expected elements are there and well-integrated. Some folks have described this as ""hot"" or ""young"" in terms of the alcohol flavor and although you can taste the booze, I might have snagged a well-aged example as this ain't too hot at all (but see below). The alcohol flavor peeks out here and there, with the whole package bitter and resinous plus sweet in equal measure. Lots of orchard fruit, butterscotch, nuts, golden raisin, and molasses kiss candy with an astringent tea bag note that comes on strong late. IPA-like hopping in the finish, which veers towards the harshly medicinal but does remain rooted in dried citrus peel and pine territory. Standout features for me include the malt complexity, nuttiness, classic barleywine orchard fruit elements, and assertive hop flavors. If there's a drawback its that things do get a tad harsh late into a bomber, which is probably a good reason to share this sucker with some appreciative aficionados. Still, a welcome introduction to this new to Alberta contract brewer for me."

"Pours a reddish brown with a solid off white head. Comes off a little hot and has a strong American bitterness that is  not that pleasant at the moment. I'm not sure why I can stop myself from ordering barley wines on tap, but more often than not I get disappointed compared with a bottle that has a little time on its side. Overall it will probably mellow out to be better than what I gave it but right now the alcohol heat and that sharp bitterness keep me negative on it for now."
"Not the most complex BW I've had but well worth a try, that being said I doubt I'd buy another to age with its 13$ price tag"
""
""
""
""
"Not the most complex of barleywines, be they new or old world in origin or style, but that doesn't seem to be the aim here. Instead, what we get is an alcoholic paean to a, let's say complicated malt, the DIPA hop schedule that loves it, and lip service paid in full to that old-seeming musty difference maker. A slow sipper, to be sure, as duly noted already, but once past that simple physical limitation, all bets are off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad barleywine. Taste isn't as complex or deep as the really good barleywines. It's worth drinking again, but isn't something that I will go out of my way to try and get. Prost!"
""
"The flavor is of sweet barley malts, lighter hops, and really no booze at all. I like my barleywines to mellow out a little before trying them and this one did."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on 05/09/14. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a brown/ruby red color with about an inch off-white head that stayed around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like caramel, toffee, dark fruit, bready malt and some citrus peel. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like caramel, toffee, candied oranges, bready malt, dark fruit, and some citrusy and pine hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and has moderate carbonation. And for the most part the 11% ABV is well hidden. I thought this was good, I wouldn't mind buying this again in the future."

"As a side note, I'm not sure if this is the base beer for Billionaire, but it would taste great barrel aged. Time, slow oxidation, and wood can only do good to a big flavorful beer like this."
""
"Poured a ruby red body with brownish tints and minor head and lace. I pick up figs, booze (bourbon), wood, caramel, toffee and other sweet malts in the aroma along with hints of dark fruits. The body is thick, smooth, the booze does come out as there is a little heat. Malts are centerpiece as the sweetness from caramel and toffee, maybe figs, is prevalent but a good bit of balance from dry, citric hops gives this beer a varied taste profile. Maybe not a barleywine for everyone with extra hops and alcohol dialed back for style but it's pretty good."
""
"But still in the end there was something I just did not like Its not been with just one clown shoes but most of those I have tasted"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice American barleywine that is good to sip on. The alcohol sneaks up on you, as it's barely detectable under all the maltiness. Pretty good price-point as well (relatively speaking), at $8.49. Certainly worth a try"
"Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Has a citrus and caramel malt aftertaste. Easy to drink, and worth trying for sure."
""
""
"Nice raisin candied yam, and how I don't know.. You may think this is crazy... But ice cream. Maybe its because its hot outside... Anyway... Very malty caramels and toffee. Raisin, prune, blackberry, plum(yes prunes are dried plums but the flavors are different), and somewhat syruppy... Now, not the maple, but if you've ever made syrup at home and tasted before adding any flavorings... Yeah, that. Mild hops on the finish. Bigger bodied and very representative of the style"
""
""
"This is a straight forward and very solid example of the style. Well crafted. It becomes redundant at times. I almost want to say it eventutally becomes a chore to drink, but that's simply not the case. Good stuff, but nothing mind blowing."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've never been all that huge on American Barleywines, and this beer isn't exactly changing my mind. It's not bad, but it's not quite blowing me away. Looking at this beer objectively, it really does hit everything it ought to for the style, though. It's got a very nice malt profile, it's generously hopped (while not being insanely bitter), and the alcohol's (likely deliberately) not hidden all that well. It's hard not to appreciate this beer. Pretty dangerously drinkable. I recommend it."

"22oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 05/15/13. Pours a murky, muddy brown color with very little head. Fair amount of lacing. The aroma is malty with a good deal of dark fruits, earth, caramel and toffee. The taste is much like the aroma. Malty at first with raisins, caramel, earth, brown sugar and toffee. Boozey with a hint of orange peel. Finishes with some more caramel maltiness. Woody. Pretty noticeable alcohol presence that may have mellowed since the year it was released. Heavy mouthfeel. Slightly sweet. Overall, good Barleywine that I would buy again."
"On tap at ACBF. This was a really tasty Barleywine, really intense, tons of strong boozy fruit, balance struck me as really interesting and quite nice. I was quite impressed with this, a very tasty Barleywine that has some assertive complex boozy fruits, plums, stonefruits, barrels. Quite nice."

"This barleywine pours a deep rust color with a small short lived off white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The aroma is a subtle blend of sweet malts, West coast hops, and booze. Body is quite close to full with a very pleasant sticky coating texture and little carbonation. The flavor is not as subtle as the nose with an abundance of sweet malt, woody notes, dry herby hops, and alcohol. There is also a little toffee/caramel flavor for good measure. This is a solid barleywine. Can't wait to see how it ages."
"This nearly full-bodied, lightly effervesced brew is smooth, slightly drying and takes on a warming aspect fairly early, even before it warms much."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/15/2013. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, raisin, pear, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/earthy hops and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange peel, raisin, pear, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange peel, raisin, pear, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of citrus/floral hop and dark/toasted malt flavors; with a great malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice barleywine. All around good balance and complexity of citrus/floral hop and dark/toasted malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"OVERALL: Solid stuff. The feel is a little sub-par here, being a touch thin and prickly perhaps, but the rest was solid and lead to an enjoyable drink. Good sweet malt base with a nice hop profile bringing a lot of character to the beer. Good looking brew too. All in all, this is another solid Clown Shoes beer that's well worth checking out if you get the chance. Cheers."
""
""
"overall - a decent barleywine, and not really boozey."
"O: it's described as an American barleywine but it has the malt forward make up of an English barleywine, which I greatly prefer. Don't expect a hop forward barleywine and you'll be rewarded with a real winner."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's not the most deft, diverse, or complex barleywine around. Still, it holds its own, giving one their daily recommended allowance of citrus, sweetness, and alcohol."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 13 oz tulip glass, not sure of the bottle date. Pours a amber brown, with a two inch off white head, that leaves behind excellent lace, with solid retention. Smell is loads if biscuity grains, hard candy, roasted toffee, brown sugar, grapefruit, and some alcohol. Taste starts with toffee, brown sugar, and biscuit and finishes with hard candy, alcohol, and grapefruit. The body is medium large, nice amount of life, a little dry, and drinks way to easy for its 11% abv. I like big hoppy barleywines and that is this. Fans of Smuttynose, Old Ruffian, Old Guardian, and Big Foot will like this tasty brew."
"Overall, a great barleywine and one that's easy to enjoy. I could drink plenty of these, especially as it was fairly cheap."
""
"Overall: this barleywine has some good things going for it. but overall it comes off as a fairly weak flavored brew. falling in as a middle of the road barleywine"
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is thick and chewy and probably pretty good for the style. This one is definitely one of those beers that takes over an hour to drink due to the sweetness and alcohol. I can already feel the hangover from this one. Not a fan. This one definitely needs more time; very raw tasting."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Slight head and no real lacing. But nose prominently features raisin and butterscotch. Bitter and a little sweetness to balance, pungent components as well. Boozy, thick, with a dry finish. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
"Maybe Clown Shoes should bottle date their bottles so I would not give their beer mediocre scores. Would be an interesting experiment to see if the alcohol heat mellows out with time."
""

"Overall a good fairly mild flavored Barleywine."

"O- great BW love the citra its dank and brooding but also sweet and creamy"
""
""
""
"Clown Shoes' first barleywine is darn good. There's a nice balance of hop presence and malty goodness. I may have to procure another to revisit in a couple years."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and I thought it was a very nice example of an American Barleywine, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style and I thought the citra hops were a nice touch and they worked well with this beer, I even think more citra hops would make this beer even better, but it may make it more DIPA like and as it stands now it's pretty easy to tell this is an American Barleywine. This beer had good drinkability, especially for the style, the 11% didn't show up as much as I expected and even with the higher bitterness it still remained pretty drinkable and I think a bomber to myself would be a good amount and I can't say that about a lot of American Barleywines. What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, this is a pretty nice example of what an American Barleywine is all about and I thought the drinkability was pretty good too. What I like the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad and it was pretty true to style, but it was just a little too sticky for me. I would buy this beer again, since it's a little heavy on the hops I don't think this would be the type of beer I would cellar, but if I could find it fairly fresh and was in the mood for the style I'm pretty sure I would get it, but it is a little pricey. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hoppier Barleywines. All in all I was happy with this beer, I was on the fence about this brewery but the more of their big bottles i try the more I start to like this them. They had a good idea to add citra hops to Barleywine while keeping it recognizable as a Barleywine and not a DIPA. Good job guys, I'll have to be on the look out for more of your big bottles to try."

"overall not bad, not sure how it would age but not bad as a basic barleywine, but doesn't do much to stand out or anything like that."
"Bought this beer because of the label... AWESOME! Pours a hazy, brownish-red color with a small white head that goes down quickly. Scent is hoppy at first. The presence of citra hops is definitely noticeable...lots of hops followed by burnt sugar. Lots of citrus and orange peel aromas. Sweet malt and more hops. Taste is sweet malt up front with a heavy hop profile followed closely behind. Quite hoppy...definitely an American barleywine. Bitter hops with a bit of booze and some burnt malt and sugar. Some dark fruits as well. Mouthfeel is full bodied, yet crisp...not too syrupy. Drinkability is high. Overall, I feel this is a solid representation of an American barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, citra hops come through, but still dominated by the malt flavors."
"O: Decent hoppy barleywine. Hoppiness isn't overpowering due to the strength of the huge caramel malt base. Pretty simple overall, lots of caramel and citra. Not to say that it's bad at all. Big, bold and heavy flavors. Good booziness that's not overpowering, just adds more kick to the flavors. I enjoyed it."
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with brown sugar and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is a nice example of a citrus hop forward barleywine."
""
""
"overall: Enjoying this. Not a standout imo but nicely done."
""
""
"either way.. you get what you pay for."
"Overall a nice offering from one of my favorite brewers but definitely not my favorite. Admittedly I'm a little let down by this because I love clown shoes and I love barleywines but worth trying if you can find it. I will try this again after some aging but I worry because its already very sweet."

"overall: this is one of the better barley wines I've had, although I've not had many and don't consider myself an expert on this style but this one stands up to stone's ""old guardian"" just not as hoppy."
""
"O/D-Starts off smelling like a DIPA then it ends up showing its Barelywine roots. But be warned, Crunkle Sam is still a hoppy beast of a beer. Quite cool. One of Clown Shoes' better hoppy offerings."

"Dark orange hue with minimal white head. Smell was very intense and very good. Rich mango and pineapple followed by bitter hops and ending with sweet malt. This tasted very much like an IIPA but I feel like a lot of extremely fresh american barley wines taste this way. Notes of citrus, pine, vanilla; and very hoppy. As it warmed the barley wine character came though as the sweet malt started to balance with the hops. I really enjoyed the progression of this beer over time and would like to see how it does with some age as the hops will die down considerably."
"There's definitely some blurry lines between this and an imperial ipa, but while nice and hoppy, still has a distinguishable American Barleywine feel, and its good."

"I don't often drink Barleywines - I've had only 6-10 different selections since I have gotten into craft beer in 2003. The best compliment I can give this brew is that it has re-invigorated my interest in the style, and bolstered my love of big beer. Ultimately, the latest from Clown Shoes defies preconceived notions of Barleywines, displaying a very complex libation that is literally a journey though potent beer sensations. Very true to Clown Shoes' style in general, this is expertly formulated and the antithesis of boring. You need this beer in your life... & Drink it fresh!"
