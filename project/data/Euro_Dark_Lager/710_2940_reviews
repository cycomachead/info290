"First time to try. Bought a six pack. Was expecting more flavor, creamy head, malty, and better feel in mouth. A bit disappointing. Actually tastes a bit flat. Hope I didn't grab a six pack that had been mishandled and stored incorrectly."
""
""
"No "" Beer Snob"" review here. Bottom line is. .....great winter time lager with semi creamy finish and some toasty notes. It my go to winter time fish fry beer."

"Kinda weak for the name. Not so creamy and doesn't taste so dark"

"Beautiful head and lacing, light texture on the tongue, a bright after taste, a dark slightly red coloration, a lingering sweetness, effervescent, a hint of coffee bitterness.  delightful and easy to drink all night."

"Overall (3.92) : This beer is probably my favorite Leinenkugels' yet. It's sessionable, tastes great, has a nutty coffee flavor, and still retains that dark euro smoothness. I'd buy a six pack to stock in my fridge in a heartbeat. Good stuff."

"While I'd never session Creamy Dark, for fear of extensive heaviness making me too full too fast, this beer is exquisite in its presentation and taste. It's almost a lighter, less-flavorful Dragon's Milk, which was another fantastic beer all the more. Giving them the same score because they both had me feeling the same way; warm, fulfilled, and satisfied. Hats off to Leinie's on other great beer."

"Pours a very deep brown in color with some ruby highlights with almost a 1-finger beige head. Some spotty lacing is seen which each sip. The aroma is of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate and caramel. The taste is pretty much the same with a slight bitter and dry finish, but doesn't linger. Good carbonation. Overall going with a solid '7"

"Lienenkugel Creamy Dark Appearance is cola with light brown on the edge when held to a light~ Odor of Mushrooms and Flowers~ I firmly believe that Leinenkugel is marketing and pricing adjunct ale as craft beer~ I wouldn't ever buy it personally, I acquired one as part of a gift pack~ I suppose it's an upgrade above most commercial beers, some mild creaminess but not much~ Leaves the palette watery and expecting more, very blah and boring. Caramel Malt, Smoke, Some Grass, some Toffee and just enough roasted malt to make it drinkable~ It is smooth~ That said, so is Budweiser which shares a 5%ABV~ I'm gonna call PHONY on Leinenkugel! Overall: 4.3 (out of 10)"

"A very nice creamy dark beer!"
""
""
"A little disappointed, with a name like Dark Creamy...well you get what I'm saying...dark yes, creamy not even close. Parts of this are ok...but it's not very balanced wth to much carbonation, bitterness and way to thin. I bought in a sample pack...would not buy in a sixer."
""
""
""
"Overall, a semi decent brew from Leinenkugel's, but lacking in certain qualities to qualify for a 'creamy' brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall wouldn't be my first choice but still it's a solid enough beer for drinking now and then. Wouldn't go out of my way to get this one."

"Leinenkugel's Creamy Dark ---3/5."

"Overall a solid beer that I would recommend for others to try."

"overall - ok brew, the taste grew on me a bit as it warmed up. for a decent priced dark lager, this does the trick"
"A very nice looking beer, with a somewhat disagreeable taste for me. Originally in 2008, gave it a solid “Eh”, would keep that grade."

"It would be nice if this beer was as creamy as the name suggests, but it simply isn't. It's got some crispness to it, and it's not devoid of smoothness. It's semi-dry and pretty light in body."

"I like a dark creamy beer and this doesn't really disappoint. I would like a little more alcohol content to make this standout. However, I decided to Half'n Half this with Canoe Paddler and was pleasantly surprised. I poured the Canoe Paddler in an English Pub Imperial Pint Glass and used a pouring spoon to drizzle on the Creamy Dark. I am not a huge fan of the Canoe Paddler by itself but do like it at times during a session, but this half and half I would take to about a 4. Happy with it. I lived in Blighty for four years and drank many a 'arf 'n 'arf from many pubs, they were better. But this is nice for the States. Wonder if anyone at Leinie though of this?"

"O - worth buying again in the Fall"

""
""
"A decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Leinenkugel seems to be improving with actual indications of flavor compared to earlier renditions ive experienced by them. This one is creamy sweet, and dark and decent by all accords."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's a beer worth knowing. It's a dark lager for the masses. It serves a purpose. I'd like to see someone try this who doesn't drink beer outside of light american lagers. As far as my money goes, I would only purchase this if I was in a dining situation where nothing else struck my interest. I won't bring him home again."
""
""
""

""

" I thing that I don't like about this beer is the aftertaste. It's very dull and underwhelming."
""

""
""
"Overall, this is a solid beer. I do not know if I would buy a six-pack. Yet, I'd try it on draught at the first notice."
"Drinkability: Meh. It does not get me excited but I suppose it is a decent beer. It is not over the top but does provide nice flavor."
""
""
"O - The flavors in this beer are pretty nice. I didn't expect that much of a hop presence in this beer but I was pleasantly surprised."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but does not have any interesting flavors and seems a little too watery on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent beer, drinkable, but nothing exceptional. The estery character and cola flavor are a bit offputting."
""
""
""
""
"To the Point: typical easy drinking Leinenkugel, not big in flavor, but if you want to drink a few and sit around the campfire during the winter … this should do the trick (that is the only reason I pick it up)."
"O - Overall, this was exceptional for the company. The flavors meld nicely. Compares to some good stout's in my opinion."

"The smell of this beer is rich and sweet and as creamy as you would hope from a bottle with creamy in it's title. It is smooth and easy to drink but the finish of the taste does not maintain the high standard set by the aroma. The hops are not over powering but still leave more after taste than my personal preference."

"12oz bottle poured into a mug. Pours a slightly transparent dark black/brown with a thin beige head. No lace. The aroma is sweet with fresh-baked cookies, bread, toffee, sweet malts. A moderately crisp body deepens the the feel of this lager, but there's a slickness to it on the finish that weakens it for me. The sweetness carries over as this beer is like fresh warm bread with sugar on top. Light chocolate malt notes round out, and there's just a kiss of alcohol on the finish. This is an easy drinker, though a bit middle-of-the-road, that I would like to have on hand time and again."

"Had this one after softball, poured into my dixie cup. Pours a brown color with a creamy kahki one finger head. Not bad here. Aroma is sweet roasted grains, lactose, nuts. Flavor follows with a slightly nutty and sweet flavor, rather smooth. A bit of hops on the finish with a slight sweetness lingering on the palate. Very smooth and easy drinking. Not bad, honestly, and I could drink a lot of this at a BBQ."

"For what this is, it's fairly solid. Certainly not something I'd go for all the time, but when the only options are BMC this is a cut above."
""
""
""
""
"Creamy Dark pours an almost black, dark color, with a tan head that disapated quickly. There was a bit of smokey aroma to it, but overall was weak. The taste was a little creamy, a bit smokey, and had a decent sweet malty backbone to it, but was a bit watery. Overall a decent dark beer, its enjoyable but could have been better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts and smoke. Taste is smoke up front, some malts, a hint of charcoal. Different and unexpected flavor profile. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I kind of purchased this as a novelty idea for 1 dollar but it ended up being as good as said price. Not something to seek out but never really worth turning away."
""
"Overall- This Euro Dark Lager has more positive points than negative. It would just be nice if they were more pronounced and given a body that had more heft."
""
""
""
""
"O-I like it. Easy drinking, good flavor, just the right abv. A good dark lager."
"Taste/Mouthfeel smooth from the get go, yes, creamy not so much. Crispness of the hops gives way to a dull malty finish that's not watery so much as unremarkable. Overall, still on the hunt for a dark/black lager that I would buy again this seems like a poor man's bock."
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a positively average beer. Nothing bad but few things that really make it stand out. If you like lighter beers check it out, otherwise probably pass."

""
""
""
""
"Pours a warm, dark, semi-transparent brown with a nice thick light tan head that hangs around for a bit and leaves just a little lacing. Aroma has licorice, unsweet chocolate and miso notes plus a hint of molasses. Flavor seems a bit on the thin side, smoky with woody, unsweet chocolate and licorice notes, not great but still pleasing. Maybe this was from not the best batch, or it's better on-tap. Texture has average body and above-average fizz. Overall, decent if not great, and worth a try."

"While this beer will probably not win many awards when stacked up against other crafts, it has a nice flavor and drinkability that make it a very good value. I grew up with Leinenkugel beers, and I owe a lot of my current appreciation of craft beer to that company. Creamy Dark doesn't try to do too much; and what it does do can really hit the spot. Try pairing this with sauerkraut-covered bratwurst from the grill."
""
"Overall: This is a nice beer for the season. Not exactly creamy and warming like one would think. This is a great dark lager for those who do not care for full-flavor dark lagers."
""
""
"I was expecting a bit more, I know leinenkugel's generally doesn't get the best ratings on here. But I do like the taste of some of their beers. This one was just all right though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appears a clear dark brown color with a relatively larger and lacier head than all the other beers I've had yet in my Leinenkugel session. Still, I would only call the lacing and head average quality at best. For something with the word ""creamy"" on the label, the texture is actually not all that creamy either, just a standard medium thickness. Still, this medium level of body is slightly thicker in feel than all the other beers from this session thus far... just not really ""creamy"" to my mouth. Taste and smell follow each other exactly once again, some chocolate malt with a modicum of roastiness and mild bittering finishing things off. It does succeed at having a classic 'clean lager' character to both the nose and the flavor, but that's about all that strikes me as memorable about this one. Not bad, not really great either."

"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small roast and creaminess. In the taste, a small roast, lager like and a small lactose presence. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry creamy roast in the aftertaste. Standard dark lager but a bit creamier and sweeter."

"another unconventional lager from leinenkugels. pours dark and frothy, just short of a guinness in appearance. smells like a standard dark lager, roasty and malty. im guessing here the ""creamy"" refers to its texture, not the presence of lactose sugars ala a milk stout, because there is no residual sweetness in the smell or taste. the texture is not in fact as creamy as i was hoping, and i found it to be a bit thinner than i was after, but still fuller bodied and smooth. slightly better than average"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty good beer, it doesn't wow or excel but its very drinkable and a great cold weather beer."
""
""
"Overall-- yikes. This is not an F, but this is not very good either... But, at least it's better than the one made by Guinness!"
""
""
"I snagged this brew for the cold season that has started. Meant to warm me up in the snow, but doesn't do much of that. Not as heavy as I'd like. I see it as generic dark brew, otherwise unable to be categorized. Wisconsin you can do better than this. It's not disgusting."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall it's a pretty crappy beer. I don't have much else to say besides that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This beer does have a creaminess that is very enjoyable and makes for a very drinkable smooth beer."
""

"Overall, this beer is weird for me. It doesn't taste like much, but I still really like it. This is also a beer that I can consume rapidly. It's gulpable. Not necessarily a good thing, but if you're not careful 6 of these can disappear in a hurry."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a deep, deep roasted ruby red with a black overtone. Airy, fluffy head dissipates to a tiny layer of bubbles. Surprisingly, there is lacing. Smells of burnt malts and tangy hops? There's a sourness in the aroma. I'm not impressed with the taste at all. There's bitter chocolates in there if you really look for it, otherwise it's more like bitter hops over roasted malts. Even for the Euro Dark Lager style, I just feel like this beer is a mess. The mouthfeel is like that of a lager. Overall, I will never drink this beer again. It's not creamy. And it's the wrong kind of dark."
"Not as heavy as one would think"
"This is a pretty smooth offering from Leinie's. It pours a subtle head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells roasty with a little chocolate/coffee. This is an easy beer to drink that has a nice smooth finish. Not to heavy for a ""dark"" beer."
"Overall, this was a pleasant surprise. I'll drink it again in the winter months, especially if Leinie's remains less expensive than some of the other darks I like."
"Drinkability is okay for a dark lager. It doesn't have the most amount of taste for a dark lager, but it does have enough balance to drink a good amount of. Drink this if you're at a party and offered one, but don't go out of your way to get one."
"Pours a dark cola brown color with thin cap of greyish tinted head, gone quickly leaving a spot or two floating on the top. Scent is pail and has notes of heavily toasted malt with faint notes of sweet cream and a splash of unwelcoming onion. Taste carries some enhanced notes of dark caramel malts, sweetness higher than expected, ends with an odd lightly grassy and oniony note. Medium bodied, lightly creamy and moderately high in carbonation. Off notes in scent and taste interfere with a mildly decent beer."
"Cheers!"
"M: For being a ""creamy"" I would say this was awfully watery. Okay coating, odd finish."
"My pour resulted in just under a finger of light-tan head that wilted quickly in this unrelenting heat. Color was a deep dark-brown with cola highlights at the edges. Nose smelled of licorice and molasses. In a lager?!? Mouthfeel was kind of thin and it tasted like drinking watery cocoa powder mix. WTF? Man, this was one bizarre beer, even for me. Finish was lightly chocolaty with a mild smokiness on the extreme finish. I really have no point of reference on this one. I am not a fan of the Black IPA hybrid style, but this was something different. I guess that what bugged me was its thin mouthfeel and its lack of Ooomph in terms of flavor. It's a neat concept, but it could be better executed, IMHO."
"D - Doesn't do a lot for me, not a lot of depth or character"
"The mouthfeel is equally as weak with a good carbonation but overlly dry for a sub 5% brew. Just like everything else the feel has little to no character and not much enticing me to drink more. I can finish this bottle and then never expect to have another. Really a simple not so great brew."
"This brew pours out as a really dark brown, almost black in color with a nice looking tan head. The aroma is packed with roasted and burnt malts and some nice hints of hops on the nose. The taste is nicely roasted with a good amount of malts upfront with a rich burnt bitterness in the aftertaste. The hops don't really shine thorugh in the flavor at all. The mouthfeel is lighter than most dark lagers which is ok I suppose. I'd prefer it to be a little thicker. Overall I was happy to have tried this one because it was one of the harder Leinie's to find in my area. I'd drink this one again."
"O - This is certainly the best Leinenkugel's offering I have tried. It looks amazing in the glass, the smell is nothing but inviting, the taste is very good, and the smooth consistency is quite pleasant. I highly recommend it!"
"overall not terrible by any means, and it is what it is."
"From notes: Brownish/black pour with a minimal tan head. Aroma is of caramel, roasted malts, a bit of chocolate, and heavy cream. Taste is creamy, malty, a bit of chocolate, and lighter of the style. Palate is sweet, short, and somewhat watery. Overall, It's not the best dark lager I've ever had, but it's about what I expected from Leinenkugels. Decent."
"Drinkability: This is an easy beer to drink. I believe I could only drink 2-3 at most. The coffee taste is good and it has a nice balance that isn't too complex or too boring."
"D: Very easy to drink, good flavors and low ABV so you could drink a few. Again a pretty good little brew from Leinenkugels. Worth a try."
"Actually kind of surprised to find this in my parents fridge, where they have (with no small amount of influence on my part) evolved towards Two Hearted, Bell's Java Stout and other very respectable brews. But I can see where it might be the right one for the job, under certain circumstances. Not bad, not great."
"D: Out of all the Leine's this is one of the few I don't mind. Not a must have, but not awful either."
"Taste: It takes a little while to first get a flavorful taste but then it goes from a mild bitterness to a very pleasant nutty aftertaste. I really like the aftertaste of this one and would really enjoy having a few of these."
"I am not a big fan of this style, but it is just an ok version of the style. It is easy to drink, but nothing I would seek out again..not bad for the price."
"In the end this could be a gateway beer for MGD drinkers ending in a discovery of true stouts."
"Bottle no. 01171-C20956. Sampled on December 14, 2010. It certainly has a handsome looking dark amber-ruby red pour with a little bit of head that never quite goes away. The aroma is rather thin with elements of yeast, grains, and malts. The body weight is around medium. The flavor has a hint of bitterness but it leaves a sour aftertaste. I had it with pizza and it was fine."
"M - smooth and, as advertised, a bit creamy."
"Drinkability - This beer isn't bad. Decent little change. The brew looked and smelled good enough. Might be more of an entry level dark beer for people looking to expand their horizons. I could drink a few of these for sure."
"From the bottle. Amber/dark brown in color. Thin head. Aroma of burnt malt/cooked grains. Malty flavor with a little chocolate and smokey/cooked grain. I would say that yes, it is smooth, and easy to drink. Enjoyable, tasty brew. Worth another purchase."
"This Dark beer from Leinie's while pouring very nicely into my beer mug where I see a dark brownish beer with a small yellowish-white head that has good retention with not much lacing. The carbonation is very good and when smelling the beer I can faintly smell some hops, but nothing that stands out. I will admit that this beer looks and feels a lot better than it tastes, because while it has a nice creamy texture to the mouthfeel and goes down nice and smoothly the taste is not as good as I was expecting. When drinking it I can taste some malts with a slight taste of hops, and even though the bottle says nothing about chocolate being in there I am pretty sure I can taste a slight bitterness of chocolate in the aftertaste. I have learned from this beer that it might not always taste as good as it looks. I don't think this is a bad beer, but not something to go out of your way for either."
"D- Malty, easy drinking. Not complex or that tasty overall but not so bad."
"This beer tastes very good. It is a bit darker and heavier than others, but nowhere near say a Guinness draught."
"D - I could drink this over basically any other non stout or porter."
"Drinkability is good, I would grab this beer if it was one of 10 beers available."
"I didn't get a whole lot out of this beer. Glad I got it in a mixed 6."
"Another step into Wisconsin beer during the Man's Weekend. It pours a dark brown with garnet highlights topped by a finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose is nearly nonexistent, a fact which was corroborated by others at the table, though some intense nasal digging did eventually flush out some very light notes of roasted malts, coffee, and caramel. The taste is also kinda light, but not nearly as much so as the smell: notes of coffee, cream, vanilla, and roasted malts dance around playfully on the 'buds. The body is a sleek medium, with a light carbonation and a decidedly creamy feel. Overall, a nice little bit o' darkness, nothin' too dark, but something easily drinkable and enjoyable, especially given the more-than-reasonable pricetag."
"Overall- this is not a bad beer at all, especially for the style. On a cool fall night I would have no problem drinking a handfull of these."
"Taste, more tobacco, a little bit of bitterness undesired in a cream style beer. Roasted malt and tobacco rule here. No hops. Alcohol and bitterness way too amped up in the mouthfeel for this style. Coffee even seems to come into this. Pass."
"This is a perfect example of a dark creamy lager. It's velvety and smooth and chocolaty without a burned flavor in most dark beers. Smooth doesn't even cover it really, it truly creamy. The empty bottle is up on my shelf as examples of great beers right next to Midas Touch, Sunset wheat and Cherry wheat. Something I would recommend to a friend who doesn't know what real beer is but wants a great introduction."
"Probably not. But the point is, it's an amazing beer. 8-)"
"Thanks to Tom H. for the Leinies Sampler."
"I suppose this brew epitomizes what you would normally expect from Leinenkugel's. It's an attempt at something different, but it doesn't quite blow you away because it falls just short; it's good, but not great. This was an awesome beer to use for boiling bratwurst, but it's not an excellent beer for drinking. Now, I would much rather have this than some other macro, but I wouldn't quite say that it does the style justice. Again - it's a good beer, but not a great example of what it aims to be."
"D- Fairly easy to drink, but there's just not a lot going on."
"I poured into a pint glass to three fingers of off white head. It is a really dark rust color, reminiscent of a bock. It has a sweet grainy smell. The taste is of a lager but there is a roasted malt character to it, as well. It has a watery mouthfeel. I remember liking this beer a few years ago. I would still choose it over a BMC, but my palate does not respect lagers the way it used to."
"D: easy to drink. No alcohol bite, no hops bite, decent taste, drink 'em up!"
"Notes - Not really great but not bad either. An unfortunate middle of the road dark lager without much flavor."
"Not bad, feel like it could 2 or 3 in a row at most. Not a whole lot to uncover, mouthfeel & roast may start to wear. Would've sworn this was a schwarzbier, but what do I know?"
"Overall: Basically, all of the Leinenkugel's I've ever had fall into the same category of good to very good. I've yet to discover one that's absolutely outstanding. I definitely will not knock this brewer. It's a good option and you can expect goodness."
"D: Refreshingly good could very easily drink this one everyday :-)"
"This is a decently drinkable brew. I have a feeling Leinenkugels take pride on brewing beers that are simple, yet drinkable."
"I dont care who owns or distributes this beer, it is allright with me."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a clear chestnut brown with a big creamy head that hangs around a while before going into a film with pretty good lacing. Aroma reminds me of a water down version of their Fireside Nut Brown Ale, burnt malts. Burnt malt taste with a hint of citrus and a bit of hops. This tastes like a beer that wants to be more but just does not get there. Drinkable."
"Drinkability: Eh, it's okay, I guess. A light counterpart to the rest of Leinenkugel's Fruity Pebbles-tasting line-up. Paired well with watching a program about Jimmy Stewart PBS."
"D-Pretty easy to drink, but not a lot of character here. Seems to be a defining characteristic of Leinenkugel beers. I could see it being a great gateway beer though as it's more complex than adjunct lager's and but isn't too complex."
"Overall, and me being a big fan of Leinies in general, think this is one of their better offerings. Better than anything that comes to mind from this category that I tried while in Europe. Cheaper too."
"Style-wise it's nice, but I wouldn't consider it a go-to."
"I have to say this brew looked great but fell a bit flat in the flavor department. The nearly black substance filling my perfect pour glass with 1.5 fingers of head, and when it settled it made a shape resembling the Bahama Islands. The aroma had a hint of malt with toffee. The taste and body were a bit weak and unimpressive. It wasn't too bad but I won't go out of my way to get one."
"Drinkability: A winner from Leinenkugel, this a perfectly drinkable light beer. The coffee taste is pleasing and I love the multiple flavors in this beer. I could have two or three."
"A clear brown pour with a foamy two finger off white head , some spotty lacing , medium to high carbonation . Aroma of slightly burnt caramel, roasted malts, a bit of chocolate , some small metallic hints , probably from the carbonation . Flavor is roasty and slightly tannic , hints of chocolate and walnut shells , light body with a watery mouthfeel , smooth slightly roasty finish as promised , quite sessionable , and a decent offering ."
"D: A standard euro lager that doesn't offer too much on the nose or palate, but is fairly drinkable. Would be good for some Sunday football I suppose."
"This brew is well balanced, crisp, and revitalizes the palate quite well. I would venture to say this would hold up well with any German Schwarz (black) beer."
"Drinkablity: Tasty and sessionable. Well crafted brew."
"Do the chickens have large talons?"
"I have noticed for the first time just how similar all the Leinie brews taste. I bought one of the Explorer 12 pks, and went through on of each flavor in the course of an afternoon and evening. I really am not as impressed as when I was a young guy and a trip to Chippewa Falls for free tour and beer was something to look forward too."
"Taste is mildly sweet malt with a surprising amount of fruitiness for a lager. Burnt toast flavor is a bit of a turnoff and there is really not much else to support it, except a bit of stale malt cardboard. The quantity of flavor is pretty low, so it is easier to put down than my review makes it sound. I dont think I will be purchasing much of this one in the future."
"Creamy Dark is one of 4 beers from Leinenkugel's Explorer Variety pack and is my favorite. Sure worth a try if you are looking for a brewed in America Dark Lager."
"I've been waiting a year for Leinenkugel's to get this one to our area. Thus I was happy to see the sampler 12 pack in the stores last weekend. To date, Leinie's has been hit and miss, so I had high hopes for Creamy Dark. Fortunately, it was pretty good. Dark (cola) color in the glass with a ""creamy"" head that offered some lacing. Roasted (dunkel) malt in the nose that remained in the first taste, mellowing to a fairly robust nutty roast malt with an odd (charcoal/cardboard) off-taste that detracted from, though it didn't quite eliminate the positive drinkability. The sip ended with a hint of hops bitterness. The thinner body made it refreshing, but less satisfying; and an astringent alcohol scent permeated the nose during the last few (warm) sips at the bottom of the glass. So for Leinie's, it was good. But there are far better craft dunkels out there."
"Despite the fairly aggressive carbonation and relative thinness it does have a decent dark character and enough balance to make it an easy-drinking enough beer. Not as sweet as the other offerings I've had from this brewery, though sweet enough for the style. While this is certainly not a hop-centric style, I do with they would dump the bland cluster hops. In the end, this beer does have a malty, but balanced character and with less fizz and more body could be much better."
"Another easy drinking brew from Lienie's. Not sure about the ""Creamy""part. It tastes somewhat like a Hobgoblin...Nutty,hint of dusted cocoa, a carbonated crisp finish. Very light hop note. As I said in other Lienie's reviews, their beers are a bit lighter then what type of beer it is....for a world of big beers, high hops and malt and other flavorings, this beer is great to go back to and relax my pallet. And not in a bad way. Very drinkable."
"O: Respectable showing from this Wisconsin based regional brewer (since 1867), but nothing that jumps out to separate itself from other craft brews."
"Drinkability: A pretty bland lager. Doesn't have much taste or flavor to speak of. Leinenkugel's has a fairly disappointing line-up and this beer falls squarely into that category."
"I'm not all that familiar with the Euro Dark Lager style. As far as I know, this is the only one I have ever tried. Not bad looking beer, dark brown to black, translucent with some faint rust clolored hues. White, moderate head with ok lacing. Not much in the way of smell. Some understated sweet roasted, somewhat smokey notes, but nothing really grabs you. Taste is kind of the same. Some bittersweet chocolatey roasted malty flavors. Not much in the way of a hop presance. Smooth, but nothing all that great. My impression of this beer was that it was almost like a porter light. The flavors kind of remind you of a porter, but not really. It's not bad. It's pretty smooth and drinkable. It does have a thick creamy mouthfeel as advertised. Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way for one. Pretty forgetable."
"I've tried this on in the past and knew that it was a decent / above average beer. I recently bought the Leine's Explorer Pack and this is far and away my favorite in there (Fall pack with the Oktoberfest). I would buy this one again but as a solo 6-pack as the rest of the beers included are not anything special."
"Nice, easy drinker."
"easy to drink but has no lasting taste or complexity to it interesting making the beer underwhelming. this beer is too simple but there is malt, a light roast and amber color vagueness that lingers. little watery could have another but won't. my friend left me a what's left of a 12 pack might use it for cooking or tomato beer. ed notes tastes good as tomato beer combo if you get bored drinking it straight."
"Overall, this is a completely average dark lager; I wish they would have attempted to add more flavor to the brew. However, I will say this is my favorite Leiny product."
"I could sit here and drink these beers all night. However, it lacks the flavor and complexity of something that would make me want to go to the fridge (or store) and get another."
"Certainly a drinkable beer, a good option from the Leine brand."
"I could drink quite a few of these no problem. This is in my top two of Leinie's beers that I've tried."
"Nice malty aroma but, surprisingly NOT creamy. That is the name, isn't it? A let-down from a brewery that is my fave micro-macro from North America. More body and complexity needed---you would think they just took bottles of their lager and added caramel coloring after ""extra-aging""...?"
"This is a good beer. Though not what I remember. I use to drink this all the time. Either my tastes have changed, or the beer has changed. Still and easy beer to drink. Definitely worth a try though. One of Leinies better offerings."
"Drink very sessionable could have a lot of them. I think this is a good drink out of the bottle beer you are not going to miss much by not using a glass, and yet there is some flavor to this beer."
"Certainly drinkable. Would make a nice addition to the session fare at a family gathering, or a decent crossover brew. Not much here though, however, to hold the interest of the dedicated craft beer afficionado. Glad to have tried it, probably wont again unless im at another shitty liquor store with shitty selection... hmmm, sounds like the circumstances that lead to the purchase in the first place..."
"D - Not bad at all but just bland. The aroma and flavor are unexciting which lands this beer in a MEH category. Not bad but not something I'd ever go out to get. In fact, I don't know of a case in which I would get it period."
"Highly drinkable and refreshing."
"This beer pours a clear brown color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel and roasted malt. It is a very pleasant aroma, but very simple too. The taste is again is simple, yet there is enough there to make it nice to drink. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a high level of carbonation. From a beer called Creamy Dark I would expect the mouthfeel is be a lot smoother, but the excess carbonation really gets in the way of that. Overall, this is a decent beer, and one of Leinie's better ones. I could drink this again if it were the best beer available."
"Pours a decent dark brown/black with some very nice initial head and a bit of lacing. Slight malt scent, not much there, but nothing bad, either. Decent taste, nice maltiness, but not much in the way of anything dark; it's pretty much a slightly smoky lager. Goes down quite smooth."
"definitely not disappointing, a little more body would have been nice, but it's quite drinkable. i'm a bit biased to leine's because it's kind of a family favorite (both sides of the fam from wisco). but this one is IMO one of leine's best offerings....and as always redily available for a good price"
"Mouthfeel?drinkability: Very easy to drink. Good overall."
"It is very drinkable. A fairly neutral beer with dark lager qualities."
"drinkability- great session beer."
"This drink has most of the good bold flavors that many superior dark beers have, yet less bitterness and ethanol. This is a great accompaniment to Italian or French bread and butter."
"A very good but average lager. Pours a darkish brown with a clingy head. Subtle hop taste. There is a crisp finish. I noticed a smokey aftertaste that I really enjoyed. when the boys at my local HiLo beverage have nothing good and i'm in a pinch I usually pull the trigger on this one."
"Poured into a pint chilled glass. A dark red pour with single finger non creamy head that quickly subsides. Just could not get into this beer. Not much aroma, poor on taste, poor on mouth feel. Nothing really to write home about. Not sure if I would try this again."
"Good pub draft that is one of my top rated active bottled beers of the Dark Lager style."
"Pours a very beautiful, clear mahogany with a warm, reddish glow. Creamy, beige head that sticks to my glass. Nose of roasted malt. Light-bodied - almost watery - with distinct, lightly sweet accents of roasted malt and an almost coffeeish edge. Basically no bitterness. Rather smooth and lovely. Good, but nothing like the Dunkels from across the pond."
"D. I am going to pick up a sixer of this stuff ASAP. I see the low reviews before me and I just wonder if this beer is better from the tap or if I just got a super fresh pour...anyway, I liked this beer and that's all that matters."
"This brew is very drinkable. Another good beer from Leine's. Not overly impressive, but it doesn't disappoint."
"Overall not bad. I enjoyed the dark fruit and mild earthyness. A decent mild session beer."
"A pretty solid Euro Dark lager. As per typical macro's its very light on the hops."
"Overall, not to bad of a beer (for a lager) but not something I'd drink again."
"Pours medium dark amber in color, looks nice at first but loses nearly all its head fairly quick, little or no lace either. The smell is very unique and difficult to place, howver the taste resembles roasted, almost burt almonds. The burt nutty taste is a bit to strong for my taste. All in all I'd drink this beer again but it wouldn't be my first, or second choice."
"This beer is caught between a marginal macro lager and a legitimate dark lager. The aroma has an unfortunate cooked corn smell, but the flavor is dominated by a pairing of nutty and roasted malt flavor that are quite nice. Its a shame Leiny's can't follow through and really make this a good beer. Still quite drink despite the flaws."
"Poured hard into a pint glass, nice clear rick dark brown color with a light tan 2 finger head that quickly disappeared. Produced a well developed aroma consisting mainly of roasted malt with a bit of hop. The flavor wasn't as sweet as I thought I'd would be, kinda of a burnt, woody flavor with a little hop on the finish. I nice drinking beer that wasnt overly heavy"
"D- they go down like water, easy but nothing in the excitement department."
"D: Not quite one and done. Intersting enough and drinkable enough, its a clear back-up beer."
"Not quite balanced enough for me but easy to drink."
"One of leines better beers, give it a try if you haven't already. This is also a good beer for those ""afraid of the dark"""
"Re-reviewing this brew after having a good years worth of reviewing. This beer poured into a pint glass has a dark brown color with a nice 1 1/2 inch off white head that leaves nice lacing. The smell is of roasted malt with hints of mild caramel and chocolate. The taste is similar to the smell. Some burnt chocolate and mile sweetness. Not as bold of flavor as some dark lagers but this is a solid brew, one of the best from Leinies, worth it from a local brewery."
"Worthy of a drink :D"
"D - Very drinkable dark lager."
"This is one of my favorite American Dark Lagers for many reasons. Great dark amber color, pours well into a glass. The creamy head does vanish to next to nothing but a good lacing remains. The aroma is real nice lots of malts and some hops can easily be detected. Good roasted flavor along with some chocolate and maybe a bit of licorice. Finishes strong and very drinkable. This is a quality dunkel that goes well with a good meal or simply on its own."
"Served in a glass from a 12oz bottle. The beer poured a dark brown, forming a 1 inch tan head, with little lacing. The aroma consisted of light malts and grain. The taste was a smooth mix of sweet malts and light grain. Not at all complex. Mouthfeel was medium and smooth. This beer had a decent flavor for a lager, and low alcohol to make it an easy drinker. Overall, this beer wasnt bad. While I wouldnt want to drink this all night, one here and there would be good, especially on a hot summer day. Worth a try."
"This creamy lager is dark, but not creamy. It poured a decent brown with a marginal head. The nose has some mild malts and light sweetness. The taste was a bit grainier than I expected. Just not much going on here. A watery body has lots of carbonation. Not very enjoyable."
"This beer was just a tad above average and one I would drink on future occasions."
"Drinkability is very much a good thing. This is a great lighter beer that you an serve off the tap at a barbeque and not have too may people sleeping on your couch."
"This is one of my favorites from Leinenkugel's. While it doesn't compare to many craft and microbrews, it is exceptional for a mass produced beer. It has a nice head with a very smooth taste. It is a darker beer that I think even people who prefer lighter beers could get into."
"Pours very transluscent dark brown with a small offwhite head. Light roasted malt and cardboard on the nose, mostly. Flavor is very cardboard like, with a very thin, watery body. Some roastiness is showing, but I guess a decent amount for an American Dark Lager... Not very good overall though, but drinkable."
"For a Leinenkugel mainstream beer this is actually one of their more quaffable offerings. Keeping to the tradition of a dark lager it has the crispness and smooth lager qualities. The taste finishes with a slight hop flavor (very subtle) and has an almost toffeish malt characteristic to it. Of all the Leinies styles offered this is one of the beers that is worth a taste."
"All in all, not a bad offering from Leinenkugel, but I won't be searching for this beer again any time soon."
"note: I hoist this fine brew in honor of Brett Farve retiring today. Here's to you Brett."
"I would rate it about the same except for the taste. Would down grade it a bit. I will try it in this style once more just to see."
"This is a really good beer. It could be on of my regulars. Not a mind-blower, but some good flavor at a reasonable price."
"Overall, better than i thought it would be. I wouldnt mind having this one again when i am not in the mood for something complex and just enjoying a good time with friends. but will i stock my fridge with it? no."
"Can't drink many of these. In fact, I got a Lenie's sampler as a present and would not buy this again."
"A drinkable beer, smells hoppy, taste is crisp, of smokey in chracter, but not bitter in taste. Mouthfeel is just average, easy to swallow. It is however a very drinkable lager, but not one I'd go out of my way to get again. This beer would be appropriate to accompany a hot milk cake with chocolate icing."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: The mouthfeel was ok but was definitely just your average lager. I don't intend on many more of these."
"drinkability is great. a few of these would not hurt any beer advocate. cheers!"
"Poured a very attractive dark brown color with decent head that dissipated slowly. Aroma was of roasted maltiness with hints of chocolate and coffee. Flavor is also malty that is well balanced by a suprising hoppiness. Mouthfeel is good and lacing on glass is decent. Very drinkable beer."
"I would def not purchase a six pack of it for recreational drinking."
"D- I guess I expected more from Leinenkugel on this one. There just wasnt enough flavor to get me to buy these and not some other dark beer."
"This is by far my favorite Leinies beer. Its dark, but its pretty thin and easy-drinking. I love the deep brown/black color and the wonderful toasted/caramel aroma. Creamy Dark is extremely smooth in the mouthfeel department, perhaps a bit thin, but it makes that 5th and 6th pint very easy to drink. The flavor is not overwhelming, but very tasty and again, caramelly. Try this beer if youre new to the Leinenkugel stable."
"Its a very dark reddish/brown beer with a nice head and almost no lacing, and it has some mild carbonation. Smells like roasted nuts and chocolate and wheat bread. Its pretty smooth and has a semi-crisp taste followed by a slightly bitter aftertaste, its not a full bodied beer. After I let it warm up a bit the bitter aftertaste seemed to mellow out a bit."
"D: it'll do ina pinch, but just slighty better than your average macro. It's dark and unoffensive--might be good training beer for the masses."
"First sip carries a mild astringency, grainy, with a minor roast note and low level sweetness in the aftertaste. Fairly clean but bland. Mouthfeel has adequate carbonation, but it's a bit watery. Papery, dry aftertaste. Something about this beer makes you want to just throw it back without pondering it at all. Not good. It's easy enough to drink, but i'm glad I didn't buy the sample."
"Flavor is toasty, roasted, and bitter. Dry finish with hints of sweeter fruits hidden in the background."
"D - Easy to drink could have a few of these in one sitting"
"Overall this brew isn't bad, but it isn't good. If you had this on tap along with your typical macros, I would go for it. But if you are in a shop looking for a 6 pack, there are many better beers. Though this brewery is usually priced about right."
"One of my favorites from Leine's. Smells nice and dark, with some roasty malts. Nice dark flavors, with roasted malts and carmels and woody/barky type flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy, but finishes a bit lacking. All in all, pretty drinkable, though not as complex as I'd like."
"edit: after tasting many more beers, this is good, but not as great as I thought it was."
"Drinkability- A nice mild beer for a dark beer would go great with a meaty dish."
"Subtle, weakish notes of a nutty malt. Taste is along the lines of a fizzy root beer, but with enough hops to balance it out and add a bit of a bite at the finish. A dark beer thats not <too heavy>, and light enough with the alcohol to push it to session status."
"Finish is okay, but not what you would hope for with a dark lager. If Im going to drink much dark beer, I think Ill go all the way to a Stout."
"Overall, this is a nice no brainer of a beer. Some strongish flavors, but not the most enjoyable to just sip on. A good session beer."
"I guess it is a lager afterall that says all."
"A pretty good beer."
"Drinkability - This would be a good beer to have when you anticipate on having a lot... it won't fill you up.... it tastes OK... on the lighter (taste-wise) side... but if that's your thing.... go for it...."
"Overall impression: This beer is not the best of its style out there - but for the price its quite a good offering."
"overall this is a very good brew, i enjoyed it a lot but can not see myself drinking it on a daily basis"
"of that Sunset Wheat there..."
"D - Not very good with the ""long haul", but sometimes that's a good thing. C+"
"D - Up there with BigButt Dopplebock as the best products from Lenie. It really impressed me."
"A nice dark lager, smooth, malty, one that I would keep in the fridge year-round. I had this on tap at the brewery, in July, so I know this will go nicely summer or winter, not something I would say about Guinness or other stouts. A classic dark beer like Beck's, Lowenbrau, etc, but I would lean toward Leinie's for my choice. This is one of their year-round labels, so give it a try and see when you like it best."
"Poured very dark with a small amout of white head. Smell was almost like a porter, but not quite a sweet. Taste was of roasted malts with a nice smooth finish. A solid beer, something for when you're looking for a dark beer that's a little different."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a beautiful ruby-brown color with an off-white, thick, bubbly head. Smell is not overwhelming, but is of dark roasted malt and slightly of hops. The taste is similar to the nose, with the toasted malts coming out very nicely. Balanced very well and has a smooth finish. Beer is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, one of my favorites by Leine's."
"D: Good beer. Leinenkugel's is one of my favorite American brewers and this is a nice example of their work."
"My dad gave me three of these, and it's probably my favorite Leinie's. Different enough from the norm to keep me interested."
"Head kind of non-viscous, belieing thinness of this beer, despite its dark color. Nose of caramel and roasted malts. Tastes very middle of the road. Seems like some sort of a ""lager-ified"" bock, with some of the superficial notes of a decent bock, but lacking the complexity and heartiness. Just not that exciting. Also, a little watery; again, not really in character with that deep, dark burnt orange color."
"Leinenkugel's Creamy Dark pours a clear, deep-mahogany body with ruby-accented chestnut highlights near the base of the glass. The head is creamy, bone-white, holds well, and leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. There's some dry roastiness in the nose, similar to dark-kilned chocolate malt, and a bit of dark caramel. It's medium bodied in the mouth with a gentle zest. The flavor is full, expressing dark caramel, almost burnt sugar, a touch of nuttiness, and some mild roastiness that lingers into the finish along with more scorched sugar. The bitterness is solid and it finishes dry. A flash of hops appears in the end as well. Very nice, almost smoky roastiness. Well-balanced. Clean. Very nice!"
"I paired this beer with Chinese as that was what I made for lunch. I was hoping to offset the sweetness of the food with the beer and accomplished the task marvelously. The only problem; I had more food than beer. Ive been known to sit down and have a few of these for conversation or relaxation. Overall I recommend this beer to anyone looking for a darker change of pace."
" Bottom Line: Pretty good beer, i've been waiting to try it for a while, and I'd reccomend it to and Euro Dark Lager fan."
"D: This beer is fairly drinkability for such a dark one."
"This is one of the best beers in the leinenkugel's mix pack case. It was pretty good and chocolate malts are nice in this beer. Mouthfeel is a little thn, but it's easy to drink. They must pasteurize their beers. If they didn't then they would be a lot better. The malts ctaste good and there is a good hop balance, but the pasteurization makes everything a little thin."
"This is classified as a Euro-dark lager, which it doesn't fit. This needs a lot more body and dextrins to fit that bill. Otherwise, this is a very nice session beer. Very clean, and quite refreshing for an otherwise average, forgettable beer."
"Pretty good for style. I keep this on hand for guests who like dark lagers. It's also my favorite beer to steam brats in. Nicely drinkable."
"Not a bad overall beer, but a little to crisp, and i just can't seem to get that metallic smell out of my head."
"The beer was served in a 23oz tall glass. The color is very deep ruby, near black with good clarity. There was a nice thick white head a top the beer that slowly reduced to a thin covering with good lacing evident. The aroma wasnt much of anything, a weak sense of malt, no detectable hop aroma. The beer has a surprisingly thin mouthfeel for its color. The taste is a slight maltiness with low hop bitterness, no detectable hop flavor or aroma. Overall the beer is very drinkable and quite smooth, but doesnt offer anything special flavor-wise, either malt or hop. It had been quite a few years since I had one of these beers and while it wasnt bad, I dont think Ill go out of my way to return soon."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y"
"Overall a nice macro dark lager. A unique creamy characteristic. Not bad at all."
"Ok, it's a few days and several more of these bad boys later, and I know it's proabably bad form to edit my review, but I just had to bump up the drinkability score to a five. Seriously, this isn't the kind of beer that grabs you by the balls and begs for attention, but I'll be damned if they aren't just plain old good! And they are dirt cheap! (that probably shouldn't be a criteria for drinkability, but when they are less than a buck a peice at the grocery store it's kind of hard not to drink them)."
"Single bottle given to me by a friend after we helped him and his wife move. Pours dark crimson with a big cream colored head. lagery odor, some chocolate tones. Flavor is sweet and mildly of roasted chocolate but a bit thin and watery too. Not bad, pretty good for a lager. You can buy this all over south bend but i think there's a lot that's better so i dont."
"Leinenkugel's Creamy is dark is a dark brown color with a creamy head. Head is below average in height and is a light brown color. Retention is weak. Aroma is of dark roasted malt with notes of coffee. Taste is of lightly roasted and dark bready malts. Again, notes of coffee. Overall sweetness is mild to moderate. Finish is a bit thin. Overall: very enjoyable flavor, if it weren't for a slight thinness I'd probably have given it a 4 for taste."
"This beer pours dark with a light frothy head and has hints of chocolate and malts. Even though it has the color of a porter or stout, the flavor is not as heavy as these brews. This is a good starter for people who are, afraid of the dark. After a taste, they may get over their phobia. You have to love Leinenkugel's ads, homey and sweet like many of their brews. As with most of their beer this has a lager finish. Try it and spring it on your friends as a treat."
"Drinks pretty good. A good entry level dunkles for the unintiated"
"I have to remember that it's a lager, and it told me so on the label, and though this past love failed to spark my endorphins with its claims of dark creaminess, i cannot fault it and accuse it of not being forthcoming. When i drink dark and creamy, i want something that will stain my teeth and give me something substantial to expectorate later. (On the positive side, it was still nice to see my old love, as I have always thought that its dark bottle looked fetching wrapped in that green and gold label.) Leinie's, there was a time for you, but we've grown apart, and I'm a different person now. We can still be friends"
"Probably an attempt at a German Dunkel, because an attempt at any other dark beer would be a failure. Even compared to the good Dunkel's, this beer is more grainy than malty, a bit chalky, and almost cola-like. The carbonaiton is a bit harsh and the body thins quickly. There is a bittering that comes partly from hops, and partly from grain hulls. The body is less creamy than the lable suggests. Overall, it's just a bit weak on the malts and it hurts the beer from start to finish."
"Nice creamy head for a CO2 dark beer. Good burnt malt aroma. Good consistency with the thicker than average body you would expect from a dark beer. Taste has a malty sweetness with a coffee finish. A good example of the style and a very nice beer from a macro/micro brewery."
"Clear and dark with deep red tinges and a finger's worth of uniform, bubbly head that dissipates quickly but clings a bit. Nose seemed more grainy than ""dark," without the even minimal hint of roasted flavors that show up in the taste. Mostly lightly sweet malt flavors with the afore-mentioned dark note, and even that quickly fades. The mouthfeel is clean but neither creamy or dark in character. Still, this one served its purpose--a refresher on a hot late spring day, and the best choice on a pretty sparse beer list."
"D- the creaminess makes it a little hard, but the flavor is light enough to accomodate it"
"I wouldn't go out of my way to try this, but when presented with the opportunity, I found it to be a drinkable brew."
"Drinkability - This is by far Leine's best product. Good tasting, drinkable and honestly described (unlike Leine's ""doppelbock""). Not a great deal of complexity, but a darn tasty lager from a large producer."
"Drinkability: Light and lively this one is an easy drinker. One of those beers that may look imposing due to its dark color, but is anice easy drinking lager. I am pleased with this brew, and it will likely find its way into my fridge again."
"I poured this beer poured into a 0.4 liter schooner and it resulted in a 1.5 cm tan head that held up for a few minutes then dissapated to 2 mm. The color of the beer is a chocolate brown. The smell is a roasted grain/coffee mocha. Most dark beers are much heavier than this beer and it has a crisp taste for a dark beer. The flavor however is abundant with roasted overtones and a sweet hoppy undertone. This beer has a sparkly mouthfeel and is very light and refreshing. Best to be dranken very cold. The price is right for this beer. It came in a case of 24 with three other leinie flavors for $18. If your looking for a heavy stout this isn't your beer but if your looking for a refreshing crispy beer with dark beer flavor this is your ticket."
"While in Detroit visiting I bought a case of Leinenkugel at a Costco. Their red ale has been a favorite of mine, and sorry to say, it is not available in San Diego. I am currently in Vietnam until Apr 06. There are some brew pubs here now putting out black beer which reminds me of Sam Adam's black lager and Leinenkugel dark."
"Pours dark brown with brown head that disappear fairly fast, but left evidence of its existence by good amount of lacing. There is some taste to this lager in the form of roasted malt. It has a watery mouthfeel. The finish was clean. I can't say this beer overly excites me but I really can't knock it either. It should be rated ""worth a try"" rather than ""not recommended"""
"This beer pours a nearly, not quite, opaque dark brown with a decent if not long lasting tan head. Some sticky lace in the pint glass and a table of bubbles. Smell is mild roasted malt with corn odors. At least this doesn't have the horse piss smell of many Euro lagers. Mouthfeel is thin...just too thin. Drinkability is fine if you are looking for stamina and not flavor. It isn't terrible, but it isn't 'good' either."
"This beer is super-smooth but still has an excellent bold flavor. I think this is a truly unique beer ata great price and a good session beer for the cooler months."
"This isn't a world class beer, but something about it makes it pretty darn good. Poured out to a darker brown color with a well formed 1/2 inch head, and some notes of lacing. Medium level of carbonation. Smell was rather weak overall, but not absent. Aromas of roasted nuts and wood, with a trace of aged cheese were noted, and overall light. Taste was decent. Flavors of lightly roasted malts, mild grains, and maple wood. Nice. Mouthfeel was appropriate for the style; medium bodied, smooth and creamy. A good level of drinkability; this is a very well made, mass produced beer, at an inexpensive price. Good for the fall months. Recommended."
"The beer is ruby tinged and has an opaque creamy head. It has a nice roasted malt and chocolate aroma. The flavor is of hazelnut and chocolate with the roasted flavor coming through on the finish. The body of this beer is somewhat thin. All in all, this is a very nice and drinkable dark beer that is a good value for the price - a definite fridge filler and a good gateway brew for our macrobrew loving friends!"
"Notes: Try this one with strawberries and chocolate some time. Strawberries really improve this beer, and this beer those strawberries."
"Smooth, with just enough bitterness."
"So is this a macro? And if so it is too damn expensive, i mean it is nice but for 6 bucks?"
"They serve this beer on tap on the SS badger, a ferry that riuns from Michigan to Wisconsin. Poured a dark brown with smallish brown head and low carbonation, could have been the plastic cup. Nose hints of malty sweetness which will turn out to be a tease. Malt sweetness in the flavor, smooth and light in body but then a big malt taste appears for a short time before the slightly malty aftertaste comes in."
"Pours a very dark brown color from the tap, with an average sized foamy head that I had figured would be a little darker. The scents are of coffee and sweet malts. The flavor is respectable, strong coffee flavors with accents of bittersweet chocolate, and probably more coffee. I notice the mouthfeel to be a little slim at first, but as I get half way through the beer, I begin to change my mind. It could be the dark color that made me expect this one to go down like tar. Maybe a medium-bodied beer here. I really wouldnt want it much heavier. The drinkability is good as well, it would take quite a few of these before I got tired of them. Worth a try! Cheers!"
"The name is a bit baffling  not a stout, not a porter, just dark and creamy beer. Appearance is dark amber with a touch of copper, a beige head that sticks around and leaves some lace. Aroma is, as advertised, creamy, with a hint of malt. Initial taste promises to be full and good, but quickly reneges on its promise and goes nowhere. Malt, caramel, and water. Light body, weak carbonation, finishing with a whimper. Pass."
"The appearance is solid, dark brown with a disappointing head. Both the smell and the taste can be summed up by one word with one capital letter: Coffee. The taste has the dark chocolate overtones of strong coffee. This is followed by a brief blast of coffee bitterness. Finish is clean. Not a bad beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability: Not a bad session beer, especially for the price."
"Definitely drinkable. An adequate flanker for the Miller machine."
"Drinkability-This beer has a high drinkability given that the taste vanishes quickly with no taste, if there was a budweiser stout this would be it....yuck"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. $5.99 for a 6-pack at the local Tops supermarket. This does indeed appear quite dark, and is slightly opaque with a 1/2""-1"" thin head that fades after a while, leaving some lacing on the glass. Smell and taste are not very distinctive... nose consists of some malt, some alcohol and a slight yeast odor, maybe a little citrus. The taste is slightly smoky with a little bit of hops- again, nothing too distinctive. Mouthfeel is not creamy at all, rather watery and thin with light to moderate carbonation. The most distinctive aspect of this brew is, of all things, the grapefruit aftertaste which I find odd and not all that pleasant. It was good to try, but I won't be buying this again."
"Another great beer that sold out the SAB monster. This is a nice diversion beer when you are out at a restaurant in some wisconsin areas. This is a very dark brown leather with a nice malty body to it and a caramel finish. As far as the current Leinenkugel lineup goes, this is probably my favorite. If looking for something other than the utterly gross berry weiss and honey weiss from Leinies, go for this one."
"12 ouncer sampled. w/o any freshness indication on the label/bottle. Pours dark maple syrup in color, off white head, disolving to a tiny bubble film. This left behind some middle of the road lacing. Ho hum so far. The nose highlighted some maple syrup and molasas. Flavor notes included some caramel and lighly roasted malts. Smooth mouthfeel, but a bit thin and watery. This is a decent, lower cost brew. Basically malty, w/o much of a hop presence. Dark beer with training wheels."
"Overall a good beer if your'e in the mood for something above a Heineken. You don't have to put too much thought into this beer, which is why I buy it on occasion. It actually makes a good summer alternative."
"Drinkable? I guess. I wouldn't get another. Next time I'll just stick to soda."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a very dry, roasted scent with lots of caramel malts and a lager yeast aroma. The taste average. It has a very bland and dry flavor that goes down slow and finishes weak and watery. It has some caramel malt sweetness, but it is roasted and dry with a musty/bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average dark lager. It has decent aroma, but average flavor. It's one and done for me."
"At $6.99 a six-pack, I could definitely find a better beer on which to spend my money."
"This beer is a very dark brownish red, with a medium-sized, off-white, creamy head that quickly diminished to a 2mm-thick film that stuck around until almost the end. Some specks of lacing, but not much. The aroma is mild, roasted malt and corn with hints of grass and resin. Taste was a little more interesting, a little grainy, still malty, and maybe a little nutty. Nothing special, but not bad. The finish was odd. A little sweet, lightly bitter and possibly a hint of cherry (or maybe thats just in my head). It has a watery mouthfeel, but theres kind of a chalkiness toward the end, thats the odd part. Otherwise, it was fairly drinkable. Not my favorite Leinie by any means, and I doubt Ill buy it again, but its not bad, just average."
"""Highest Quality", ""Hand-crafted in small batches"". Poop on you Mr.Leiny, your beer sucks."
"Drinkable, yes, but not beckoning."
"This is the best Leinenkugel that I've had so far (the others being the Amber Light, the Red, and the Honey Weiss). I wouldn't actively attempt to try this beer again but I would not turn it down if offered. Decent dark lager all in all."
"This one surprised me a bit and I mean that in a good way. Pours out to a near-black in the glass with a decent-sized head. Aroma is light and of malt and cocoa. The taste is that of a light, roasted malt combined with a hint of chocolate but comes off a bit on the thin side. Slightly watery to average moutfhfeel, but highly drinkable."
"Taste features dry, lightly roasted malt, tobacco, and wet cardboard. Mildly sweet, with a body thats on the thin side. Not bad; brings back memories of college."
"Drinkability: For a ""dark"" beer, it really is smooth. My favorite Leinenkugel's brew so far. If you're looking for an American dark lager, give it a try."
"This is a very dark lager, almost black, that reminds me a lot of a cream stout, but it is a lager and the flavor does not match the appearance or mouthfeel. That said, it is not bad tasting at all, just not as flavorful as it looks. It has hints of dark chocolate and plenty of dark malt flavors, but they are not very strong at all and make this beer a decent hot summer day brew, if you want a beer with a little character rather than a ice cold macro-swill. I have never been a Leinenkugel fan, but now I think I might change my stance on my evil neighbor state's flagship brewery."
"Mouthfell was thin even for a lager with very little carbonation at all. It goes down easy enough but you'll forget you drank it 5 seconds later, it just doesn't leave anything to remember. It ain't creamy either, although it is dark and it is a lager. In this case, 2 out of 3 is bad. Unless your almost broke, why drink this?"
"If you like a thick, creamy, dark beer this is one for you. Not to strong on the hop flavor department but the mouth feel is exceptional."
"No date on the bottle that I could find. Pours a dark clear mahogany with ruby accents leaving a decent head that disappates fast. Has a great chocolate malty aroma. The dark roasted malts are very well balanced by just enough bitterness but the maltyness continues to the end. Good session beer that is extremely drinkable and a real good buy at $4.69 a six pack."
"Creamy Dark Lager isn't a bad little drinker. In my opinion, it's the best that Leinenkugel's has to offer."
"Appearance: Chestnut brown amber with a nice sized creamy textured darj cream head, leaves specks of lacing. Aroma: Slightly toasted malts a grassy note pretty mute on the overall aroma. Taste: Flavor is a decent mix of lager characteristics with dark roasted malts giving it just a nice overall edge not bad. Clean tasting brew. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body lackluster not much to it. Drinkability: Overall decent priced easy drinking mass produced dunkel."
"Okay, pours brown with a 1 inch cream colored head that lasts for at least a few minutes. This has very little smell at all. This tastes mostly like alcohol. There's no real creamy, caramel, malty taste at all. I wish I knew what they were aiming for here. The taste just isn't much of anything. Creamy isn't really a good adjective for this beer. I mean, yes..it's dark, yes...it's thicker than say your average AB pilsner but creamy?..no. I guess I could drink these but I'd sure rather have something with a little more flavor. Sorry."
"I won't buy this again."
"Not a terribly beer, really, and I guess I'd opt for it if the pickin's were slim, but nothing I'd ever really want to have, but...that's just me...enjoy, Leinie's Lovers, enjoy!"
"This one looked quite nice with a lucious brown color and medium sized creamy head. The ""creamy"" in the name must have meant for the head because the beer wasn't creamy at all. The body was rather thin and the flavors came in rough and unbalanced. The roasted malt was a little weak because of the weak body. A sourness came at the end that was acidic and not good. This one was slightly below average."
"A nice easy drink'n dark at a very fair price. It pours a dark ruby color with a nice maintaining tan head that laces and sticks well. The aroma is of toasted grain. The taste is smokey, tosted chocolate malt backed up by a sweet caramel, brown sugar hint. The body is light, thinner than most dark brews. Compaired to some, this would be a bland beer, but its even balanced taste and mouthfeel makes it a very easy drink. A nice crossover beer for the mass pilsner crowd."
"Another trip to the ""Leinie's Tackle Box"" here. A nice beery malty odor rises when I pop the crown, but a closer whiff gave me a touch of adjunct? Pours nice and ruby dark, with a spongy head that fades quickly, some lacing. Taste is nice and ""clean," but a little hop bitterness lingers. Good roast malt, almost a stoutish tone to it. Touch of lager yeast bite in there, too. Certainly a good, drinkable beer. Wonder if the difference between this and say, the Berry Weiss is that this may be made only at the Chippewa Falls plant and not meg-produced to support Miller's big avertising pushes?"
"Not terrible as an unthoughtworthy quaffer. But don't get excited."
"Had it on tap at Buffalo Wild Wings, whose only decent beers on tap were of the Leine's ilk. This beer has the least clever name ever. This beer is creamy and dark. I don't even know what style they were going for when they made this, but it is average overall (better than berry and honey weiss, not as good as red or oktoberfest"
"One of leine's better offerings, and i will continue to drink it as my father-in-law buys it."
"Mouthfeel is average while drinkability is decent. This is not a beer I would expect this brewery to make given the rest of their stable. Still it is a decent stab at a style that is often overlooked"
"This wasn't that great of a beer. An average apperance that didn't really say much about the beer. it had a small head that discipated. There was a nice malty flavor to the beer but had a bad after taste that turned me off to it. Not a bad beer but I can definitely do without this one."
"Had this one on tap during a recent business trip. Appearance is dark and solid, with an appreciably thick, lasting head. Aroma is slightly of mixed grains and malt. First taste is slightly sweet, but less than I anticipated. Somewhat watery, but nicely drinkable. Worth having if there's nothing but macros on the menu, but not worth going out of your way to try."
"For a Dunkel, this beer is lacking in its nose and flavor.It poured a small sized tan head that contained fine-small bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was so dark brown that I could not tell if there was any carbonation in this beer.The nose was malty with a light roasted nose.The flavor was too mild for a Dunkel and it was lightly chocolate.The mouthfeel was smooth and thin with a watery texture.There was fair lacing with this beer."
"Deep mahogany color with a light brown head of tight bubbles. The head sticks around for a bit. Light hop smell coupled with aroma of sweet, dark malt. Flavor is light sweet malt, with a lingering light molasses and brown sugar. Thin, oily lacing dots the inside of the glass. Not a ton of character, but tasty and pretty drinkable."
"Pours a clear reddish dark brown with a creamy, sort of light tan head. Nose is pretty weak, with a feint hint of chocolate malt. Thin-to-medium bodied. Rather fizzy texture for a beer labeled ""Creamy"". Taste consists mainly of chocolate malt. Cascade & Mt. Hood hops supply a pleasant bitterness in the midtones that leads up to a dry chocolatey finish. Not overly spectacular, but probably one of the better offerings from Leinie's."
"Bought the tackle box sampler pack. this was definately the best of the bunch. pours a deep brown color, almost black. forms a cream head that quickly settles but lasts throughout. nice coffee and caramel tastes, much more flavorful than the avergage dark lager. for the price (7.99 for the 12 pack sampler), i'd buy this beer again on its own. easy drinking dark beer perfect for the summer."
"Minimal head and quick reducing lace. Roasted malt aroma. Very smooth taste which a thick feel. Mildly bitter. Emphasis on the malt is notable. Excellent overall flavor, which would work well with a steak or pasta."
"pours out a pretty dark brown colour with a thin foamy head. the head dies down quickly to an itsy bitsy amount of lace. dark malted aroma...light and pleasant. a nice flavour to this one...dark roasted malts....bits of coffee and chocolate. while relatively light and easy drinking...it has enough malted flavour to keep one interested and intrigued. after awhile it seems like you might be drinking alcoholic coca-cola, bringing the drinkability down a notch. if i had to chose which offering of the leinies family to drink...this would be the one. a good and somewhat tasty beer."
"Hohum, nothing special here but I am glad we met."
"This is a very nice Leinie's that is quite enjoyable. The appearance is quite nice being dark brown with red highlights and a tan head. Decent lacing along the journey through this glass. Roasted malt nose and a decent malt sense in the taste. Somewhat thin body, but it has a nice finish that is fairly dry."
"Overall, a quality dark lager, but nothing special."
"I remember enjoying this beer much more in the past. I'm not sure if they altered the recipe or if my tastes have changed. Either way you look at it, rather disappointing."
"I've rated a bunch of beers now, and didn't expect to like this one that much but really to me it is a decent dunkel and worth drinking if you like this style...definitely above average.."
"True to its word it ia a very creamy dark beer,very dark brown/black with good creamy head that doesnt stick around lond.Chocolatey aroma smells very sweet.Toasted malty taste and chocolaty,kinda thin after a few drinks.Pretty good beer had it with some hot wings and seemed to pair up pretty good."
"Color was a nice off black, brown with some off-white head, no lace. Smell is a malty caramel roast with some vanilla notes. Taste is a balance of sweet chocolatey malt and roasted malt with little hop presence. The body is to thin and light and could be more flavored. Its smooth and light, somewhat creamy I guess, nothing stood out for me. Very clean, light, and roastly sweet. Not bad."
"Sweet malts with some dark roasted malts. Hints of coffee, and a nice chocolate kick make this a pretty good brew. The body is a tad thin, and the flavor is not quite as full as it should be. It is very smooth with light carbonation. I guess you could say creamy. It is also very drinkable. I could possibly go down this road again, but a friend brought it from VA, so I don't think I will see it any time soon."
"Notes. It's tough to tell what Leinny is doing with any of it's beers, evident by the name---creamy dark lager, do they mean a stout or porter? This is more of a light porter, but the best offering by Leinenkugel, still somewhat on the average side."
"Probably the best beer that Leinenkugel's puts out, this is pretty close to being a Schwarzbier."
"A darn good American Dark Lager which you don't find too often.  Dark brown (auburn to light source) with a nice light brown head.  Nutty and roasty malt aroma and flavor.  Possible traces of a corn-ish aroma but so slight it was hard to tell for sure and it certainly did not detract.  I found the beer to be on the light-bodied side but certainly creamy."
"Leinenkugels Creamy Dark Lager is how the label on the bottle reads, but this beer is really a stout."
"This is a very attractive beer that just did not excite my tastebuds.  It was rather un-inspiring.  It did have a nice rich color and an attractive head.  It did not seem ""creamy"" at all, and it had a peculiar aftertaste which I can't quite put my finger on, but it was almost like chocolate flavored lemon juice.  Sounds weird, but that's about the best I can do.  It was definitely an acidic finish.  Not one of my favorites and not one I will try again soon."
"P.S. Do I need to see a doctor? I could swear that the mouthfeel of this beer was plenty thick for the style, if the style being referring to is American ""dark lager"".  Comments and questions are welcome. Beer mail me if you think I am nuts!"
"Pours dark brown with nice tan foamy head that lingers. Aroma has backdrop of perhaps cluster hops on malt tang; taste has slight chocolate and sweetness followed by hop bitterness; body is too light for style and not creamy as the name would suggest.  Not a bad beer if you are looking for something with more depth than the typical macro beer."
"Largely earthy-brown in hue, slightly darker in the middle but it doesnt approach black, golden highlights where the light penetrates it thoroughly (sides of the glass, for example). The tan head reached a modest finger in height, it held well enough. Not much subsequent lacing was produced. I can sumup the palate in one word: odd. The chocolate malt is very restrained as is any roasted flavors. I doubt that Leinienkugel was aiming for roasted flavors but the absents of them in a dark lager is still disappointing. There is a faint sweetness too, maybe oats or grits? Caramel malts? The hops taste old and dull and kind of cheesy in taste. The sweetness and cheese flavor are the origins for the odd taste remark. The mouthfeel has a very modest creamy sensation, maybe oats? Or maybe I am being susceptible. Medium in body but watery and thinner that need be. It is easy to drink because it is easy on the palate. I often resort to drinking this at local sporting events, it has enough flavor to keep me interested but not enough to purchase for home consumption even when six-packs run for $5.00."
"It poured nearly black with a thick caramel head.  The aroma of malt was present, though not overwhelming.  The flavor also contained a malty sweetness, but balanced well with the chocolate flavors present.  I gave it a slightly lower mouthfeel because it was a bit thin.  I enjoy this beer which can be found on sale quite reasonably some times."
"The beer pours a dark shade of ruby and throws out a medium brown creamy head.  There's a nice little chocolate/coffee aroma to this beer.  Very pleasant.  The taste is really lacking something.  I had this on tap a year ago and I remember it being quite a bit better.  The taste has some shades of cocoa and coffee bean.  A very small amount of bitterness coming from the roasted malt I believe.  Pretty average brew here."
"Very impressive color and aroma. Smooth pour and it earns the ""creamy"" moniker, as I was surprised how smooth it was for a dark beer. My first Dunkel and I would definitely buy again."
"My friends and I like this beer. It's thick, creamy, a bit cooked, creamy head. Doesn't reflect its taste in the smell though but it doesn't smell bad."
"Dark in presentation and nice smell, small and speedy bubbles...short, dense head...Very heavy on a chocolate taste, the malts are obviously chosen for this effect, a little more hop would also help...very one- dimensional in flavor, no complexity and less mouthfeel  than implied by the pour.  Nice try but doesn't make it."
