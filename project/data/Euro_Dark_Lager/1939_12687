2.98,-4.8,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Overall, not bad -- got it for a buck in a closeout section of the local beer shop. I wouldn't hunt for this again.","OtherShoe2","Oct 24, 2008"

2.62,-16.3,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Drinkability: I got a single bottle of this for the name and the country and hopefully for something different, and though I'm glad I tried it, I wouldn't try it again if I had a choice. A pretty below average brew all around, and nothing more.","asabreed","Mar 24, 2008"
3.13,0,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,"D: Tasty and it seemed to get better as I drank it, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, in a style that usually doesn’t do too much to impress a beer-drinker, this beer isn’t that bad. I could drink a few, but wouldn’t pick it if I had a decent group to choose from.","TheManiacalOne","Jan 09, 2008"
3.41,8.9,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a brown with an orange tint when light is held to it. Nose is like dirty water. Slight sugary sweet tone to it. Flavor is a little bit better than I was expecting, but still pretty lackluster. Metallic aftertaste is preceded by a slight sweet touch and a deeper typical lager. Feel is standard on the carbonation. Drinkable, sure. If this were cheaper, I might go for it in larger quantities, but I am not so impressed that I would be dropping the money for it ever again really. At least I get to add another country to the tally.","RblWthACoz","Dec 30, 2007"
3.45,10.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear amber color with a very small white head which goes away very quickly. The aroma isn't strong, but it smells like toasted malt and caramel. It tastes the same, except there's some nuttiness and some hops too. Mouthfeel is light and a bit watery, but it's also smooth. Drinkability is good, it's refreshing and easy to drink. It has just enough taste to make it interesting, it's not a bad choice as a session beer if you wanted something that wasn't overpowering but still has more taste than regular macro lagers.","bluejacket74","Apr 28, 2007"
3.72,18.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is smooth and light with a fizzy, fast moving carbonation. Easy to drink and refreshing. Overall, this was a pretty tasty lager with a some nice subtle flavors hidden within. Much better than your standard pale euro lager...I could see myself drinking this again if the situation presented itself. Check it out if you can find it...this is probably my first brew from Israel.","orbitalr0x","Apr 16, 2007"

3.56,13.7,4,3,3.5,3,4.5,"The only thing that surprised me about this beer is how much I enjoyed it. It's kinda funny to me that this beer tastes a lot like certain English bitters, but scores so much lower. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but given my druthers I'd be more apt to shell out the 5 bucks a sixer for this than some of the others I didn't mention. Put it succinctly, the bang for the buck factor is high.","jeffjfindley","Dec 02, 2006"
2.9,-7.3,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,"I definitely would not purchase this beer again, but I also wouldnt turn it down if the only alternative is the American Macro-breweries. Might be worth checking out if you happen to like this style, but otherwise, Id pass.","Contra","Sep 02, 2006"
3.81,21.7,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"My chief advice to the brewers would be to improve the mouthfeel. I found Layla just a tad too watery and lacking in carbonation. Otherwise a solid, if not earth-shattering brew.","davidshamoon","Aug 29, 2006"
2.58,-17.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Just an slightly less then average beer. It would refresh on a hot day, only for it's very watery taste and body. I would only serve this with food as a last resort, since almost any pairing is going to leave the food feeling overpowered.","RedChrome","Aug 17, 2006"
2.79,-10.9,2,3,3,2.5,2.5,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a hefe glass. Dark copper color with minimal head and no lacing. Smell is malty sweet with a slight strawberry presence. Taste is a mild malt, with more of the berry sweetness. Very low carbonation, just barely feel it on the tip of my tongue. I'm not sure if it's not supposed to have a lot of carbonation or if it's just flat. This looked interesting in the mix and match section, I doubt I'll get it again.","bort11","Aug 08, 2006"
3.07,-1.9,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"It is fairly smooth, but more from the wateriness than from the flavor. There was nothing especially bad about it, but nothing stood out either. It's a mediocre brew, at best.","jwc215","Jul 19, 2006"
2.76,-11.8,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"A pretty enough brew- golden, a good amount of head that stays for a while, pretty clear. Not un-appealing. Smell and taste are pretty basic, some sweetness and maltyness, not too much in the way of hops. Kinda reminds me of a slightly less tasty PBR, but you can actually let this guy warm a little without being afraid of it. Mouthfeel is kind of bleh, nothing exciting. Overall easy to drink, and I could have a few, but this is an unexciting brew on the whole.","scooter231","Jul 16, 2006"
3.08,-1.6,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Not bad when cold, but probably not terribly wonderful for what you're likely goind to spend on it.","ommegangpbr","Jul 16, 2006"
3.23,3.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Pours clear amber color with a medium beige head that lasts pretty well. Thin, spotty lacing. Aroma of sweet malt and grassy hops. Medium-bodied with a sweet malt character, as well as some caramel and grain flavoring. The finish is sweet and a little chalky, with a mild hops bitterness lingering. Passable overall.","Dogbrick","Jun 23, 2006"
2.91,-7,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Drinkability: bland and rather dull. Like a macro with some more grainy maltiness. Glad I picked up a single, not a sixpack.","Gavage","May 23, 2006"
2.9,-7.3,3,3,3,2,3,"Pours a four finger, white head that quickly fades to a ring leaving some lacing. Chrystal clear amber color. Very light carbonation and very light bodied. Malty nose. Starts malty, some hops, way too watery, finish is clean, not a typical lager. $1.50 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma.","jdhilt","May 09, 2006"
2.32,-25.9,3.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,2,"Certainly far better than the mass produced lagers in North America and Europe. Still, this is a dull beer which might take care of your thirst but not your tastebuds.","smcolw","May 07, 2006"
2.13,-31.9,3,2.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,"D - lower, too sweet, not very drinkable, it would be better with a mood","sinstaineddemon","Apr 13, 2006"

3.65,16.6,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Foamy, light-colored beer...head didn't last too long. I've been trying to think of a comparable beverage taste...it almost reminds me of a citrus/apple cider mix. Don't get me wrong - this is a very good beer...I just didn't know what to expect. It was very light - would probably be good as an after-dinner brew.","JohnnyM2002","Feb 27, 2006"

2.66,-15,4,3,2.5,3,2,"The mouthfeel suffers from the biting flavors, and abundant carbonation. Not impressed enough to desire another.","ypsifly","Sep 10, 2005"
3.32,6.1,5,3,3,4,3.5,"Hmm  not a bad offering. Its basic, tasty and drinkable, but a cleaner finish and less metal would have been nice.","Todd","Aug 24, 2005"
3.19,1.9,4.5,3,3,3,3.5,"This lager poured a clear, amber color with fluffy, white foam that persisted and clung to the glass. The smell was lightly malty with a touch of roastiness, though overall very minimal aroma. The taste was lightly malty with a hint of sweetness and a very mild hoppiness (somewhat soapy hops). There was some adjunct sweetness, and a touch of coffee. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry overall with medium-light body and moderate carbonation. The aftertaste had a touch of sweetness. This was an OK lager, though not very memorable.","UncleJimbo","Aug 21, 2005"
2.98,-4.8,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Whiskey and water colored. Vaguely sooty aromas combine with hash and burlap notes, its like the grains were smoked over a campfire. On the palate its dry with a splintered edge of dry wood flavor. Raisin cookie fruits can't compete with the tide of watery neutrality on the finish, nor with the dirty bitterness.","putnam","Aug 03, 2005"

2.78,-11.2,3.5,3,3,2.5,2,"I saw this beer at my local store and was very shocked to see it came from Israel. How could I pass up the opportunity to try an Israeli beer? Even though it was a bit pricey I decided to give it a try. The pour was a murky copper color which surprised me because I was thinking that this was going to be a pale lager. But then I looked on the bottle, its a "dirty" blonde lager. Well, that's a good way to describe it. The smell was nice with a strong toasted grain flavor and a caramel sweetness. I noticed hops on the smell but they seemed to be very weak. There was an added off flavor which I would equate to DMS in the smell. That flavor seemed to follow in taste esp. in the finish. The taste was nice at first, really caramelly sweet, but after awhile it was cloying and too sweet for my liking. Maybe because this was an older bottle the hops were too degraded but this beer definitely needed a little more on the hoppiness. There was also a little metallic flavor in the body. This is a thick beer esp. for a lager. The aftertaste lingered and was not really pleasant. I'm glad I tried it but I'm not going to get this one again.","granger10","Jul 15, 2004"
3.54,13.1,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"A decent beer here. Pours a golden orange color with a small film of a head that departed into the unknown even before the first sip. The aroma has some fruity malts and has a nice estery quality. Theres some hop mustiness and a hint of ripe cherry. A refreshing and lightly sweet body of malt comes through in the flavor. The body is flavorful and medium to light. Overall, a pretty mellow and flavorful beer. Not bad.","pezoids","Feb 29, 2004"
4.09,30.7,3,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Basically a nice beer, good either for just one or for a session.","Imbiber","Nov 22, 2003"
3.03,-3.2,3.5,3,3,3,3,"An Isreali beer. Who knew? Not a bad beer. It has a dark amber colorwith a nice head that doesn't seem to want to retain all too much. a caramel smell leads to a caramel taste. I detect slight hops, but not enough to notice all to much. It's an average beer. I would put it in the same catergory as Labatt's Blue.","CBFanWish","Nov 04, 2003"
3.22,2.9,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"this is surprisingly not a bad little brew from israel, of all places. it's a kosher brew to boot...i think a that's a first for me. methinks this may be tank beer repackaged for a couple of reasons: it was in the tank beer slot at the beer store, they're both brewed by the same brewery, both were referred to as 'dirty blonde' lagers, the tank beer site is no longer functional, and tanks and israel do not equal good PR these days, so they may have made a name switch, or i may be reading too far into this. anyway, to start, the best before date is cleary marked on the back of the bottle, and my best before was 21 may 2004, so this is seemigly a fresh batch i found. the brew pours a decent amber colour with a moderate head that dissolves waaay too fast. no lacing either. boo! the smell of caramel is quite evident here along with a hint of toasted grain, perhaps. the taste, while not very complex, parallels the smell but adds a bit more sweetness and a bit of maltiness as well. in general, this is a clean, refreshing brew that, while not superb, is alot better than i had anticpated. i'd try it again in the warmer months.","SixpointJMH","Sep 11, 2003"
