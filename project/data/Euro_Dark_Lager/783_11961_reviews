"Pale copper. Quarter-inch pale beige head is gone as soon as it arrives. No lace. Aroma is faint, giving notes of toast and diacetyl. Insipidly malty with a gentle bready note, followed by buttery and metallic notes. Mildly bitter finish. Light-bodied with somewhat low carbonation. Thin but slightly slick mouthfeel. Swill."
"Pretty alright brew, definetly enjoyed it."

"Lots of off notes here, i'll probably avoid it anytime i'll be in the mood for a lager, amber or any other kind."
"Overall - Not overly impressed, but does a great job of quenching thirst and is about as inoffensive as can be."

"Overall: Another rubbish beer from Faxe."

"I notice its classed here as a dark, rather than an amber, but in either category I would reach for others first."

"Final Grade: 3.15, a C+."
"Overall - I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. That's not saying it's anything spectacular, but it's not offensive and is quite drinkable. It actually reminded me a bit of a toned down English IPA. It would work well as a session beer."
"Pours a dark copper color with moderate carbonation and a frothy lace of head. Smell is on the light side, but acceptable and it's hard to pinpoint and specific aromas. Goes down really smooth. Taste is typical dark lager which is pretty darn good and slight sensation or bittterness. Carbonation feels very minimal, but no complaints. Overall very drinkable beer, and would pick up another, but have not seen this in the states."
"Overall: Quite drinkable, but not remarkable. No glaring problems, but a little boring."
"This beer is okay, different take on amber beers but feels in inconsistent. Not bad for the price. Try it out if you like sugary apple tastes."
"D - Decent beer and fairly inexpensive where I live."
"Drinkability - I found this beer became more pleasurable as i drank more and more sips. Was a decent tasting beer and the taste became very pleasant after the first few mouthfuls. I would recommend this beer to anyone looking for a nice looking beer with a decent taste."
"D- Fairly easy to go down and pretty cheap. I just didn't like how it sat in my stomach."
"Faxe Amber exceeded my expectations (which, by admission, were quite low given that I've found all of this brewery's other offerings rather disagreeable) despite that it failed at being all that desirable. It isn't something I see myself drinking again, but it's not anything I mind finishing now that I've already started drinking it this time."
"This will probably be my last Faxe brew. Pretty disappointed with both offerings, although this one was admittedly more drinkable."
"Don't avoid this, it's actually pretty good for canned beer, and if you are in Canada at $2 a can it's also a pretty good price."
"Another Faxe brew, this was my second venture into the world of faxe, and it will be my last. After having their extra strong lager, i thought this would be interesting, but i was sorrily mistaken. Poured out of the 500ml can into a pint glass, it looks real nice. Nice copper color with a nice 2 inch fluffy off white head. I had high hopes at this point. I took a nice big whiff of the smell of the beer, and man did it smell bad. Skunky, metallic (even when poured out of the can) wet hay smell. Brutal. After the first sip i was so repulsed by this, that I almost poured it out. It has a watered down, malty taste with little hops with a metallic twang, just like the extra strong lager, i think that's the trademark taste for this brewery. Just bad. Thin and watery mouthfeel, very light. This is insanely hard to drink, even when cold. I was barely able to choke down the whole thing. Avoid."
"Drinkability isn't bad. I'd drink this again and it makes a great party beer. Not as bad as some might lead on, but this definately isn't cream of the crop or top shelf quality. Consider this as you would any readily available domestic beer. Better than Corona."
"Vikings are awesome, they plunder and pillage to their hearts content, the one on this can seems happy. Although i think if he tried this beer he'd be crying on the inside. This one poured a clear light brown with lots of carbonation, a fairly thick head that dissipated moderately slow to a good lacing then nothing. There was almost no scent I only detected a tiny bit of malt. Faintly hoppy and malty definitely watery with no strong taste, the feel of this one is clean but thin and watery. For the lands that brought us Vikings this one isn't good you would think it would be but it is not. At least the can is cool!"
"why oh why did i try this one, oh ya because it was danish, their was a viking on the can and the can was comiceley huge, now that we have dicused the good parts, the color was week for an amber, the taste was bland untill the discusting after taste, and after a pint glass, i still had to suffer at least 2/3rds of the can. well i fell victom to the navelty can, if you are smart you will get as far away from this one as you can!!! I MEAN IT, THIS ONE SUCKED THE WILL TO LIVE OUT OF ME."
"i know the review seems a bit high for a not-good beer, but its not bad for what it is."
"D: I could drink all of it I am choosing not to. Not bad. Amusing for the comically large can if nothing else."
"Pours nicely actually with a pillowy creme head and a clear amber color. Flavor is bitter and eck with a metallic tone and nothing positive going on for it. Feel is decent, but who cares. This is a pretty lame beer. Thankfully it has the novelty of coming in a massive can, so at least people will but it."
"Maybe the best Oktoberfest in a can. (Seriously this tastes just like an OK fest). Nice dark tan colour with decent head and a caramel nose ( more malt than hops) The flavours are full and slightly sweet with a solid finish. Considering the $2 a tall can this is a solid beer in a style not often seen in a can."
"Purchased the can more as a novelty because of its size, it was the only cold beer I had in the house last night, settling into an SNL rerun, looking forward to anything, and I had to pour this down the sink after my second taste.. Maybe I thought the first taste was just me, and maybe it was. If you like terrible beer, with a hint of turpintine, this may be the beer for you, otherwise avoid at all costs."
"A decent beer, nothing spectacular and certainly nothing I'd try again."
"My favorite part of the beer is that Ingredients are listed on the can, ""Water, Barley Malt, Hops..., and Maize"""
"Drinkability: I've never had a beer that was a constant temperature the whole time and the smell and taste change every 10 seconds. I had no idea that one could do that, but Faxe somehow did. My mind is not going to be like this beer, it's made up about having another Faxe product, never again! After all the changing, I'm surprized the beer's color didn't change at the end."
"Poured from the can light amber with an off white head which hung around for just a bit. Hard to smell much of anything in this beer but there were some nondescript malt and hop aromas. Taste was understated as well. A bit of bread malt and mild hop bitterness almost convinced me that this was beer, but not quite. Pretty bland for sure, certainly nothing objectionable or difficult to swallow about this beer, just not that much in its favor either."
"I tried this beer on July 25, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO store. It poured a beautiful translucent coppery-red colour into the glass with a generous head that left absolutely no lacing. The aroma is that of burnt malt. The mouthfeel is slimy with some mild carbonation. The taste is malty with a strong bitterness towards the end"
"Overall alot of these brews from Denmark seem ""rushed"" . To many extracts if you ask me. worth a try."
"D: Should appeal to the masses."
"Faxe Amber pours a crystal clear deep amber body beneath a short head of off-white. The head retention is fair and the lacing is limited. The nose offers a light bit of grainy malt and some very mild grassy hops. It's crisp across the palate with a medium-light body and gently effervescent, fine-bubbled carbonation. The suggestion of caramel malts appears in the flavor, but they're not distinct. Some hops do appear however, herbal and spicy against the delicately grainy malt. A bold bitterness backs it, and it finishes dry and refreshing. Overall, very basic but well made."
"500ml Can: Poured a clear and light amber color beer with a big white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of nutty malt is the only noticeable thing. Taste of lightly sweet nutty malt with a clear finish which very little or no hops included in this beer. Overall, this is a bland and boring but refreshing Vienna."
"At one liter, this was hands down the biggest beer can Ive every had. The brew pours a light and clear amber, with a soapy head. The aroma is primarily caramel and malt, with very little hop presence. The taste is a little hollow, with a touch of sweetness in the foretaste. Theres a little caramel and toastiness, but their qualities are restrained to the point of disinterest. Its a light and almost watery brew, with very little to make you pay attention. The finish has just enough hops to provide a little balance, and the brew could stand to have a lot more bitterness. Fairly low carbonation makes this one very easy to quaff, its just not very flavorful. Not offensive, but certainly not exciting."
"A fairly drinkable brew, albeit lackluster and uneventful. Pours out to an amber orange color with a smaller head of white foam that dissipated after the first few sips. Medium low carbonation. Aromas of caramel malts and flowery flour notes. Some grain elements. Taste is medium to medium-light bodied and mild; grains, caramel malts, some sweet fruit skin notes. Somewhat dry on the palate, this could quench a thirst if one was so inclined. Mouthfeel was otherwise uneventful, with little carbonation making its way to the palate. Drinkability is average. Worth trying. I bet this is better on tap."
"..probably the least objectionable of the FAXE dextrose extract lagers but this type of high gravity extract-brewed beer always tastes lifeless, stale and too sweet to me. This is the type of crap Steelback makes on this side of the ocean...I see no need to import more from Denmark."
"Canned sample. Light copper in colour with strong carbonation. Very sweet caramel malt aroma, along with a hit of sulfur. Cloyingly sweet flavors caramel and toffee with a bit of peppery hop on the finish. Surgary sweet without any interesting malt character to back things up. A poor effort, and barely drinkable."
"Well, the head was wispy despite being given plenty of room to grow in my wiezen glass. I thought the taste was pretty bland and, while it may go down well on a hot afternoon, it certainly isn't anything special."
"This stuff really isn't all that bad."
"Difficult to drink, difficult to enjoy. Forget about it. Might be tolerable if it's found on tap."
"This is a little better than their premium lager. It has less flavor but also less DMS. Still, their are much more interesting Euro lagers available."
"Pours an orangish pink under a slightly off-white one finger head that actually manages to linger fairly well and maintains a large collar and a few strands of lace. The nose is strong and sweet, mainly of plum or grape. The mouth is very light and quite prickly. The taste is a real let down, as there isn't much here at first. As it warms, it becomes harsher, with metallic hops coming on strong. The appearance and nose are misleading, as the brew is ultimately quite unsatisfying."
"Colour is a clear, copper/amber. Head pours out about a 1/4 inch thick and disipated to nothing but a thin film. Weak smell. Mainly of malts, grass, herbs and grain husks. Though, what I do smell is nice, it needs more strength. Tastes like a decent beer that has been watered down. Definite bready malts, grains, grassy and herbal flavours with some hop bitterness, but it's too subdued. Mouthfeel is watery. Drinkable? Yeah, I guess. It's alright. Not bad, but subpar okay."
"Pours a very clear amber/orange/brown, small white head forms, no lace. Smell is clean and malty, little bit of citrus hop aroma near the end. Taste is pretty malty, honey sweetness, grassy bitter finish. Light mouthfeel, medium carbonation, not a bad beer, the cheapness overtakes crapness."
"500 ml can (same as pictured), best before date stamped on the bottom. Pours out a light brown / amber color. Nice white head right after the pour, then settled down to a thin cap covering that lasted the whole glass. Not alot of smell, some aroma of grass or grain and tiny bit of hops. Flavour has some sweetness in the middle and a very mild hoppy finish. Taste is OK, but if if you are expecting a full flavor, it will seem a touch watered down. Not alot of carbonation giving a smooth mouthfeel rather than a crisp tingle. An average amber ale, drinkable but nothing special. For the higher import price I will probably pass next time."
"Sad."
"Well who would have thought, I found a drinkable product from the Faxe brewery here. Came in a 500 ml burgundy coloured can, best before date stamped on the bottom--this appears to be some pretty fresh stuff. Pours out a light clear golden amber tone, nice frothy off-white head in the first minute or so. Smell contains grassy hops, a bit of metallic grain. Flavour is somewhat watered down, some sweetness at first but very subdued, carried over to a mild grainy middle, and ends on a mild hoppy note, with a faint astringent aftertaste, faintly herbal. Mouthfeel lacks carbonation but gets fuller as it passes along the palate, although even then the body is light. For a Faxe beer this is actually drinkable, I'm impressed that I don't have to pour the rest of it out. But in comparison to everything else sitting around it on the shelf of your beer haunt of choice/necessity it's pretty much a pass. A very one-dimensional amber lager at best."
"Thx"
"Did I mention this was boring?"
"Drinkability: a below average amber. extremely light in all aspects. i would pretty much never buy this brew again."
