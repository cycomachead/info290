It's almost a lighter, less-flavorful Dragon's Milk, which was another fantastic beer all the more. Giving them the same score because they both had me feeling the same way; warm, fulfilled, and satisfied. Hats off to Leinie's on other great beer.","SteveJeremy","Aug 11, 2014"

Caramel Malt, Smoke, Some Grass, some Toffee and just enough roasted malt to make it drinkable~ It is smooth~ That said, so is Budweiser which shares a 5%ABV~ I'm gonna call PHONY on Leinenkugel!

However, I decided to Half'n Half this with Canoe Paddler and was pleasantly surprised. I poured the Canoe Paddler in an English Pub Imperial Pint Glass and used a pouring spoon to drizzle on the Creamy Dark. I am not a huge fan of the Canoe Paddler by itself but do like it at times during a session, but this half and half I would take to about a 4. Happy with it. I lived in Blighty for four years and drank many a 'arf 'n 'arf from many pubs, they were better. But this is nice for the States.

The aroma is sweet with fresh-baked cookies, bread, toffee, sweet malts. A moderately crisp body deepens the the feel of this lager, but there's a slickness to it on the finish that weakens it for me. The sweetness carries over as this beer is like fresh warm bread with sugar on top. Light chocolate malt notes round out, and there's just a kiss of alcohol on the finish. This is an easy drinker, though a bit middle-of-the-road, that I would like to have on hand time and again.","Onenote81","Aug 16, 2012"

Still, I would only call the lacing and head average quality at best. For something with the word ""creamy"" on the label, the texture is actually not all that creamy either, just a standard medium thickness. Still, this medium level of body is slightly thicker in feel than all the other beers from this session thus far... just not really ""creamy"" to my mouth. Taste and smell follow each other exactly once again, some chocolate malt with a modicum of roastiness and mild bittering finishing things off. It does succeed at having a classic 'clean lager' character to both the nose and the flavor, but that's about all that strikes me as memorable about this one.

Finish was lightly chocolaty with a mild smokiness on the extreme finish. I really have no point of reference on this one. I am not a fan of the Black IPA hybrid style, but this was something different. I guess that what bugged me was its thin mouthfeel and its lack of Ooomph in terms of flavor.

I will admit that this beer looks and feels a lot better than it tastes, because while it has a nice creamy texture to the mouthfeel and goes down nice and smoothly the taste is not as good as I was expecting. When drinking it I can taste some malts with a slight taste of hops, and even though the bottle says nothing about chocolate being in there I am pretty sure I can taste a slight bitterness of chocolate in the aftertaste.

The nose is nearly nonexistent, a fact which was corroborated by others at the table, though some intense nasal digging did eventually flush out some very light notes of roasted malts, coffee, and caramel. The taste is also kinda light, but not nearly as much so as the smell: notes of coffee, cream, vanilla, and roasted malts dance around playfully on the 'buds. The body is a sleek medium, with a light carbonation and a decidedly creamy feel.

To date, Leinie's has been hit and miss, so I had high hopes for Creamy Dark. Fortunately, it was pretty good. Dark (cola) color in the glass with a ""creamy"" head that offered some lacing. Roasted (dunkel) malt in the nose that remained in the first taste, mellowing to a fairly robust nutty roast malt with an odd (charcoal/cardboard) off-taste that detracted from, though it didn't quite eliminate the positive drinkability. The sip ended with a hint of hops bitterness. The thinner body made it refreshing, but less satisfying; and an astringent alcohol scent permeated the nose during the last few (warm) sips at the bottom of the glass. So for Leinie's, it was good.

The taste is slightly smoky with a little bit of hops- again, nothing too distinctive. Mouthfeel is not creamy at all, rather watery and thin with light to moderate carbonation.

The chocolate malt is very restrained as is any roasted flavors. I doubt that Leinienkugel was aiming for roasted flavors but the absents of them in a dark lager is still disappointing. There is a faint sweetness too, maybe oats or grits? Caramel malts? The hops taste old and dull and kind of cheesy in taste. The sweetness and cheese flavor are the origins for the odd taste remark. The mouthfeel has a very modest creamy sensation, maybe oats? Or maybe I am being susceptible. Medium in body but watery and thinner that need be. It is easy to drink because it is easy on the palate.

The flavor also contained a malty sweetness, but balanced well with the chocolate flavors present.  I gave it a slightly lower mouthfeel because it was a bit thin.  I enjoy this beer which can be found on sale quite reasonably some times.","ryanocerus","Jul 06, 2002"
3.12,-6.9,3.5,4,3,2.5,2.5,"The beer pours a dark shade of ruby and throws out a medium brown creamy head.  There's a nice little chocolate/coffee aroma to this beer.  Very pleasant.  The taste is really lacking something.  I had this on tap a year ago and I remember it being quite a bit better.  The taste has some shades of cocoa and coffee bean.  A very small amount of bitterness coming from the roasted malt I believe.  Pretty average brew here.","Bighuge","Apr 28, 2002"
3.9,16.4,4,4,4,3,4,"Very impressive color and aroma. Smooth pour and it earns the ""creamy"" moniker, as I was surprised how smooth it was for a dark beer. My first Dunkel and I would definitely buy again.","Dogbrick","Mar 06, 2002"
3.26,-2.7,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"My friends and I like this beer. It's thick, creamy, a bit cooked, creamy head. Doesn't reflect its taste in the smell though but it doesn't smell bad.","packetknife","Beers"
2.98,-11,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Dark in presentation and nice smell, small and speedy bubbles...short, dense head...Very heavy on a chocolate taste, the malts are obviously chosen for this effect, a little more hop would also help...very one- dimensional in flavor, no complexity and less mouthfeel  than implied by the pour.  Nice try but doesn't make it.","ADR","0"
