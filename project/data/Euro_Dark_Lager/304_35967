3.54,-2.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"i think i prefer the basic lager to the dark one in this case, it seems a little thin for what it is, and the lager yeast sort of clashes with the mildly tannic grain feel, but i like the beer on the whole, and its one of those darker beers you can have with a big meal, or drink by the pitcher during the game and not get full, so in that context its a winner. there is a nice light brown foam head on it at the pout, but it dissipates rather quickly, leaving a silky medium brown beer with a ruby glow in the bright light. notes of chocolate malt, wheat, and a little oxidation arise in the smell, and the taste holds those aromatics accountable, as the two sensory experiences are essentially identical. finish is longer than it is in other dark lagers, not quite done or something, but the low alcohol and lighter medium body help it drink easy. less of a classic than the original, but there is a nuttiness i like in it, and i appreciate its deep roots. better on draft than in a bottle too.","StonedTrippin","Dec 23, 2014"

The body is a hefty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a pretty tasty dark lager, one that nudges you in the gut with its dark elbows, making sure not to say anything too forward, too offensive, or even too loud.
