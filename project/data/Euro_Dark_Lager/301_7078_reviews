"Not sure what this was meant to be. Not truly an offensive beer, but a strange and ultimately unsatisfying one."

"Overall: I haven't had this one in a while. A nice euro dark lager that was easy to drink."

"Refreshing and flavorful with good drinkability. A joyful session beer. I had low expectations and I was positively surprised."

"O - Overall a surprisingly good beer, very smooth clean and drinkable. Not the average generic dark Euro lager. By far the most interesting beer I´ve found during my short stay in Portugal. Think of it as a beacon of hope in this desert of craft beer."
"A very nice beer and one that took me a little by surprise. There is a good balance of taste and aroma, with the two pretty evenyl matched and there is a fair bit of favour in each sip."

"When in Portugal drink the ro'se wine is my advice."
"Tastes like an English Brown Ale which I wasn’t expecting. Quite refreshing and sweet."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a dark mahogany amber with reddish tones. Thin light tan head dissipates immediately to slight patches of bubbles on the surface. Very light aroma of sweet malt with some toasted malt, a hint of dark fruit, reminiscent of a light doppelbock. Flavor follows with bready and toasted malt, faint dark fruit, slight hops. Very similar to a bock, but dryer. Nice malty finish. More flavorful than most Euro dark lagers, but not as sweet and intense as a good bock. Light to medium body with a hint of carbonation. A pleasant lager with a low-key, but nice malty taste; nothing really stands out."

"O: Tastes almost like a dopplebock but not as rich. Very well balanced and tasty."

"I like this one enough that I can definitely see myself picking up a bottle again. Somewhere between an american amber, a bock and a biere de garde, I'm liking where this one is sitting."
"11.2 oz single. Not a bad looking beer at all. nice amber body and a good thick creme coloured head. Aroma isnt to bad either..caramel.bit of nut, resiny hop deep in the back. Sweet malt driven flavour as per style, slightly toasty, slight hazelnut..actually very nice. Liked the palate on this one, quite full and also smooth. Im going to say this is quite a nice dunkel. Im way against the grain on this one!"
"It isn't anything superb but it will get the job done, probably could have used a tad less sweetness and a bit more bdy."
"The taste was like the smell or aroma. There was roasted malts, mild hops and touch a caramel and a hint of other spices. A nice balance of sweet/bitterness to the finish. Not to dry nor sweet. This was a pleasant surprise."
"This is probably a popular beer in its homeland. It's sweet, full, crisp, easy to drink, and has a fairly high ABV for a standard lager."
"Overall, a pretty quality example of a brew in a category loaded with pretty bad beers. Glad to have been able to try it. Not bad at all."
"This is a non-offensive beer that's very easy to drink. It's not going to wow you, but if you're beer choices are slim it's worth a try."
"Drinkability: while the flavor is not bad, the lack of some balancing hops flavor and the general over-sweetness would make this one a little difficult to take as a session beer. I won't have a problem finishing this one, though."
"Had this in Sagres, and was quite happy with the amber pour. Had a good amount of just offwhite head that dissipated pretty quickly. Smelled nice, with mild roasted malt and toffee. Tasted pretty similar, just a little bit sweeter. Nicely carbonated leaving me with a smooth mouthfeel. My kind of amber lager, I could drink a bunch."
"The mouth has excellent carbonation, which helps overcome an average feel. Drinkability is just ok given the sweetness."
"nice looking reddish amber - puts up a full head , but fades rather quickly- faint sweet candy-like malt aroma - tastes ok - nut brown-ish, sweet and a little fruity - a heartier offering than the adjunct cervesas - drinks pretty easy - i'd have another - not bad."
"Drinkability: A unique brew and the best of the Sagres line I have tried. Very complex ..I would get another six pack"
"Mouthfeel is lightish as is the carbonation. This is quite good and easy drinking. My first brew from Portugal and I'm quite pleased with it."
"One that is easy-to-drink when looking for something sweet and light. It is an easy drinking amber lager."
"drinkability - Kind of an odd tasting beer to me.Not too fond of it."
"Overall average for the style. Perhaps a bit too sweet for my taste."
"Overall: a satiating and balanced amber lager. An interesting beer, although the level of sweetness does not recommend it for a hot day. I could give this one another try."
"D: Not very tasty, but it goes down easy simply because there isnt much to it. Its worth drinking if your alternative is a fizzy-yellow-beer, but I would prefer something a bit more flavorful."
"In beer starved Portugal, this is one of the better offerings. Still, this wouldn't stand up to the micros in America."
