"TASTE: Dark bread, smooth, creamy, chewy body, modest hopping, mildly spicy, brown sugar, baker’s chocoalte,  bale of hay, floral, warming, very clean, drying bready finish"
"Pours dark chestnut brown with a medium tan creamy head. Aroma is sweet caramel malt, notes of plum, roasty malt, mild cacao and espresso like bitterness. Taste the same as aroma. Palate is a medium body, rich and creamy with good carbonation and slightly sticky mouth feel. The finish is sweet sticky caramel malt, dark fruit, a nice chocolate and roasted espresso bitterness in the end for balance. A very rich and full flavored brew. Overall a good flavorful and tasty brew for the holidays"

"Not terribly complex but still an interesting take on, I suppose, a schwarzbier. I would drink this again."

"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Fairly complex malt character. The diacetyl complements the chocolate well. Probably cloyingly sweet to some, I enjoy the indulgence."
"Overall, this is an extremely flavorful beer with a fantastic mouthfeel. Lots of dark fruits balanced out with a cocoa finish. A very soild beer"
"The taste begins sweet with coffee and chocolate along with a kind of black licorice note. There is a thin bitterness at first but it tends to grow as I drink the beer. Although it never takes over the beer."
""
"Pours dark brown with a slight off white head that instantly recedes. Aroma leads with some figs and caramel, underneath theres some roastiness with a little earthiness. Flavor offers a nice dose of figs and raisins, caramel, a lttle chocolate and closes out with some roasted coffee grinds. Not very delicate, more heavy handed and direct in its delivery. Fuller bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, solid beer here. Better than I went in expecting it to be."

"Overall: a good example of the style. It's kind of like a lager-yeasted porter -- something about which I can't complain."

" This dark lager /bock whichever has a nice flavor of malt which does seem roasty with some fruity raisin and mild herbal hops adding to the woodiness and cocoa flavors from the chocolate malt and crystal type malts I am guessing. The yeast has a subtle berry aspect which adds to the creamy sweet flavor of the malt which works well with the lager smoothness. The flavor is roast -ier as it warms bringing an almost burnt marshmallow type caramel flavor in the finish. Overall I am a fan of this style and this is one of the better examples - bock as Full sail calls it. I like the enhanced roast as it adds to the complexity of some of the caramel malts utilized."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a half finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt and cocoa, hints of coffee. Flavor of toasted and biscuit malt, cocoa, light coffee, dark dried fruit and toffee notes. Good medium body with some creaminess, pleasant. The flavor here is fairly rich and porter-like, in a blind taste, I'd probably identify this as a baltic porter. Flavor is full and interesting and a quite nice mouth feel. Probably the best and my favorite from this series."
""
"Taste gets a few more things going - some toast, licorice and some vegetal earthiness. Cocoa is still there, drier than it smelled...not much sweetness here. Mouthfeel is fairly full for an EDL, more bockish if you axe me. Not bad, a solid addition to the enjoyable LTD series, I try and buy a sixer each time I see a new one."
"This beer would be better if the tanginess could be reduced and the head retention improved. It's drinkable but nothing to write home about."
""
"Overall: okay."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, with a fizzy light tan head, minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is pretty nice of malts, slight chocolate/coffee. The taste is very nice malty, nice notes of chocolate/coffee (even though the bottle sez there is none). Medium body, slightly dry/bitter finish. Overall this is a tasty brew, I would buy again."
""
""
"A bit salty too. A bit of an odd one. Perhaps too multi-directional. A worth trying experiment, but slightly over done?"

"Interesting beer, certainly worth a try."

"the label says I will think coffee and chocolate. not sold really. nice richer looking dark brown color and some patchy just off white lace on it. a nose of lager yeast must and roasted barley, rather simple, but fully appetizing. the taste is also straight forward. there is indeed some chocolate here, a mix of cocoa powder and Hershey bar. not sweet, but only because its a lager and the long slow cold fermentation tames it. bitter on the back end like a cup of drip, but its from the barley, clearly. I do like the feel a lot. with a slightly fuller body and a dusty almost chalky palate, still with nice carbonation. the dark malt is awesome, simple and clean, which is just right. what I do not like is its semi-gimmicky mix of flavors, its filling qualities, and its odd mix of bitter and sweet. its good, not great. at 7% abv I don't need more than one, but I am glad I tried it. when full sail first hit the scene, it was magic. since then, even in this ltd series, its been lackluster."
"The Verdict: Delicious. Tastes like a cross between an Irish stout and Kona Pipeline Porter. Complex brew with enough coffee and chocolate flavor to make you accuse the label of lying. The alcohol is well hidden, too."
"Pours pitch black with a light brown head that disappears quickly, no lacing. Sweet chocolate aroma, some roasted coffee notes, a little caramel that shows up more as the beer warms. Thick and heavy in the mouth but still ridiculously easy to drink. Sweet up front, a little nutty, tons of chocolate and a little coffee. Roasty finish makes you want to take another drink. Absolutely fantastic, a constant in my fridge as long as it's available."
"This is a smooth drinking dark winter treat. Would pair well with both hearty meals or deserts (or just drink it as your desert!) What it lacks in head and nose it more than makes up for with flavor and mouthfeel."

"Full Sail remains one of the best values in craft beer. This LTD series is amazingly complex and an awesome value. Essence of chocolateat the beginning with a clean coffee finish. Definitely get coffee in both the nose and appearance. Inviting and delicious. Alcohol is well hidden in this one. Much more complex than your average dark lager."

"Amazingly, the alcohol was almost completely hidden here, as I didn't feel it all during the time I enjoyed this. While this was not a knockout, I was really impressed by how daring and unique this was and this was certainly worthy of the ""LTD"" and the boastful claims on the bottle. Fine on it's own or as a dessert beer, this deserves a go and higher ratings than what it currently has on here. I love beers that push the envelope of what's possible and this certainly fell within that category and there's no doubt that this deserves a bigger audience and higher ratings than what it currently has on here."

"worth a purchase if you see one."
"O: This is a nice 7% dark lager; I continue to be impressed with these guys"

"O - There's really no coffee and chocolate in this? Keep making more please."
""

"In my opinion, it’s a well-crafted beer. It's among the better American bock-style beers I've had."
""
"Overall an interesting beer, I would almost call this a true baltic porter, the style that used to be made, lots of dark malt flavors, cocoa, little coffee, caramel, light black malt, very little bitterness, all that with the crispness of a lager, the way baltic porter used to be before people started calling anything a baltic porter. The very light burnt flavor from the black malt might be the only issue with this beer, and it is light. The booze does feel a little stronger than it should due to the soft lager feel, but I like it if I think of this as a baltic porter it's right where it should be I think."

"Poured into a pint glass this brew has basically no head-what is there is tan. Clear and black with ruby highlights when held up to the light. Aromas of chocolately malt is dominant. Holiday spices also here-mostly remniscent of nutmeg. A really nice taste like the aroma, milk chocolate malt, nutmeg and a bit of cinnamon along with a fair amount of sweetness present. Just a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Really easy to drink, hard to believe this is 7%. Medium bodied and carbonated-smooth and slightly velvet-like in mouthfeel. Pleasantly surprised by this beer. Very solid. Nice work!"

"O – A conundrum here, tip my hat to Full Sail for making a lager with such flavor and complexity, but still, I wish it was richer and smoother, it has typical lager carbonation and characteristics, and is a bit off-putting with the real darkness of this one."
""
""

"O/D-Pleasantly surprised here. A Porter made with Lager yeast essentially. I love Porters and therefore, I liked this one quite a bit. Definitely a cool beer to try at least once."
""
""
"Overall - Good beer, but it's not really doing it for me. It's basically a porter in a lager body. No problem drinking it, but I probably wouldn't buy it again, if only because I'd rather have an actual porter or stout in it's stead."
""
""
""
""
"O: good brew, but Full Sail has a tendancy to brew good beers. glad I picked this up. Not usually a lager fan but I am a sucker for roasty chewy beers that don't taste like sulfur (one of my least favorite lager characteriatics)"
""
"Overall. An easy drinker with some decent dark flavours going on. Drank a few of these in the hot tub on some snowy evenings at the cabin over the Christmas break. Perfect for that venue."
"O: Wow, this is excellent. It is super creamy, smooth and drinkable. Has favorable elements from a typical good brown ale and also porter-ish roasted malt. Great combination, excellent complexity and it goes down easy to boot."
""
"Taste is quite full for a lager yet without the sweet malt profile one might expect from a bock. More light roast, chocolate and a bit of dark fruit in the background. Hops not so present on the taste. Offers a nice carbonation for the pour which gives a lingering malt finish. Full body with a smooth and easy drinkability. Interesting brew and tough to pinpoint as for style/comparison though I've had plenty of worse porters along the way."
""
"A tasty dark lager. The flavors of a stout in a lager."
"overall, this is considered a lager? it has an earthy, grainy texture and feel. i like the fact people are experimenting with ingredients, and i appreciate the effort, but i resent the lager labelling. it definitely seems more of a porter or a stout and i desire to label it as so. but it is a decent drink and i can handle a few more of these, but i just wish it were labelled correctly so i could understand what's next up on my list... a great brew in the end."
"Decent but not special. I guess for a lager you could almost say it's pretty good. I doubt I'll have it again. Worth a try if you are a ticker, I guess."
""
"Overall: I enjoyed this twist on a Christmas time beer. A straightforward lager with a very good taste."
"O: Probably the best LTD offering I can remember from Full Sail, at $7 a sixer this offering is a steal. 4s across the board, a real nice beer."
""
"This is a very high quality Lager. I am very impressed at the unique flavor, I would reccomend this highly as one of the best seasonal Lager's produced, here in the United States."
""
""
""
"The chocolate stands out more than any other flavor to me, the flavor is breadier than the nose describes. I liked this one. The Euro Dark Lager style can be ho hum but this one shines through. I've been impressed with all the ltd series."
"D+"

"Euro dark lager? Thought it was a doppelbock?"
"Pours coffee black. Slight ring of brown around the edges. Small beige head, dissipates relatively quickly. The aroma is coffee, chocolate and a sweet, clean malt sweetness. Unfortunately, that sweetness tends a bit toward the somewhat sickly flavor of strong lagers. It doesn't spoil the beer or anything, but the note makes me kinda wish that it was an ale. The flavor is quite nice. It's a stout-ish dunkler bock. Fairly sweet. More caramel in the taste, though there's some chocolate throughout and plenty of roast in the finish. Pretty full bodied. Nice round feel. Finish feels a bit too sticky. No noticeable booziness. Interesting beer. I liked it more than expected. I'd be curious to try the same recipe made with a clean ale yeast."

"Overall: this is a very drinkable dark lager that has a nice balanced flavor, and is also refreshing. Definitely worth trying this."
"O. It's a very nice stout-like beer, even though it says Euro Dark Lager. Semantics, perhaps. Flavorful and refreshing."
"T: Gotta say, I wasn't a huge fan of the other LTD beers, but this one is pretty solid. Some chocolate upfront with a hint of roasted malt. A touch of dark roasted coffee and burnt malt on the finish. Pretty nice and smooth. Definitely worth a try."
"I have to score this one high since this Euro Dark category is such a catch-all of a lot of really mediocre stuff. From the bottle in the six-pack, bought at Mayfair Liquor in Denver."
"The flavor becomes more enjoyable as it warms. Initially I was put off by the harsh roasty notes but they start to mellow out as this brew sits longer. The carbonation is spot-on and in spite of the slightly stale coffee flavor that comes across I found this overall to be much more pleasing and enjoyable than I had initially expected. For the price I’d have another."
"A well done lager, easy drinking. A good winter beer."
""
"Pretty good and a fun departure for the season with the LTD line-up. It isn't perfectly suited for my tastes, but it's not bad either. If you like Session Black, you'll probably like this, too."
"12 oz single from ""Lifesource"" in Salem. $1.49 Pours a gorgeous dark brown with a huge rocky,yet thick and lasting tan head. Aroma is mostly dark chocolate ,hazelnuts and cream fudge. A little alcohol shows at first sniff then is gone. Creamy,toffee,chocolate taste..very smooth then a slight bitter ater tatse, very nice. Good on the palate..the beer gives the impression of heaviness but it fairly flows over the tongue. Overall an excellent beer best of the LTD series."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and some slight cocoa and coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O: Impressive lager...I've heard it described as a Czech Dark and now a Doppelbock...whatever the case, this is pretty good for a lager, and (just like the 6-pack holder states) there are nice notes of chocolate and coffee throughout. My kind of beer."
""
""
"Picked up a sixer of this for $5, score! The label mentions chocolate but I would not go that far. Dark black color, decent head. Smells roasty, dark, malts. Flavor is more of the same, very dark malts. This is a good lager, not sure what style it would be because I'm pretty much a novice at drinking lager beers. I would definitely buy another one of these for $5, that was a fucking steal."
"A nice six-pack surprise from Full Sail with their LTD series. Pretty nice overall if a bit too carbonated. Dark, roasted flavors are a highlight. Worth checking out..."
"An alright dopplebock, nothing too exciting, but a decent entre to the style"

"A nice dry light chocolate taste, well done."
