The taste holds notes of light chocolate, even lighter coffee, dark wheat, and a hint of hoppy florals and greenery. The body is a heavy light, with light carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

Not that this session was a disapointment, just lacking any of the benifits that I hoped to receive. The beer begins with a moderately brown, lightly headed, medium carbonated brew; eerily similar to an Amber Bock, but more robust in it's look. The aromas show a light Brown Ale maltiness, but soon follows with a lot of graininess and adjuncts (residual) sweetness, and soul-less. Flavors continue the part malt / part cereal grain character, with hints of nuts, toast, and grain hulls.

Its generally hard to find negras in Spain, and I'm not sure I had more than one when I was over there, so I thought I'd try this here in the States. Poured a nice dark brown, almost black with some chestnut highlights. Thick creamy head with no lacing. The smell consists merely of a light sour graininess, and its surprisingly sharp. The beer's worst feature. Happily, the flavors don't taste off. It's fairly light with a little toasted grain and smooth relatively thin malts. Clean, and mostly without the grainy sourness of the smell. Light to medium bodied and smooth mouthfeel. A hot weather beer that is more interesting than some- especially other Spanish brews I've had.","Georgiabeer","Apr 24, 2007"
3.25,-0.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"D: A very sippable beer, but it could use a bit more flavor to make it stand out. In the dark lager category, it seems like more could be done to distinguish itself, especially being from southern Spain, I expected some form of regional distinction.","CharlieMopps","Mar 31, 2007"
3.52,7.3,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"This beer was actually better than I thought it would be. Poured to a dark brown with medium tan head that lasted well and left decent lacing. Aroma was a little faint, but I caught a combination of malty dark fruits and a hint of licorice. Flavor was a semi-sweet molasses. Body was a tad on the thin side, and mouthfeel was a little tingly. All this led to a finish that was of medium duration and a little warming.","kimcgolf","Jan 06, 2007"
3.65,11.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I tried this in a Tapas restaurant and was not expecting this one at all. For a beer that has a modest ABV, this one packs a punch. It is a very dark, thick, somewhat syrupy pour. The head is okay, smell is good, but not great. The taste is definitely caramel or molasses, and lot's of it. Not a strong bite, some hops in the nose, but more malt than anything else. It's a good beer, not great, and I can't say that it particularly went well with the tapas I ordered, but it was a surprise for a Spanish beer. It's worth a try. L'Chaim","albern","Dec 28, 2006"
4.23,29,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Notes: I'll have to keep my eyes open for this in the future. Judging by the number of reviews it can't be all that common. Would love to see this in some mexican/spanish style restaurants.","DogFood11","Nov 09, 2006"
3.96,20.7,5,4,4,3,4,"This is a dark black beer with chocolate milk head that leaves stripes of sandy lacing all the way down. The smell is delicious milk chocolate. Tast is smooth, but a little heavy for the style. Before I looked it up I thought I was surely drinking porter or stout. Definately has the mouthfeel of stout. Drank it down no problem. A great brew.","JudgeRoughneck","Oct 30, 2006"

3.23,-1.5,3.5,3,3.5,2,3.5,"Fairly drinkable. This is a good Summer time substitute when you're in the mood for a porter or stout, but it's too hot for one.","JayTheFinn","May 08, 2006"

3.06,-6.7,4,3,3,3,3,"left me wanting for more, I wanted what I was smelling to come though in the taste. It just needed a little kick. Still the experience was still enjoyable, and would have you try a bottle if ever given the opportunity.","brushpig","Jan 29, 2006"
3.48,6.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"poured a deep brown color with moderate tannish puffy head. Smell is attractive , being a nice roasted malt scent. Taste foloows through on the smell with a toasty flavor mixed with hints of caramel. Finished on the sweet side with only a mild creaminess. Very easy to drink, but not anything spectactular. My first beer from Spain.","tgbljb","Jan 16, 2006"
3,-8.5,3,3,3,3,3,"D - This is okay, but just okay. It's unusual in taste and maybe worth a try if you can get a single ... just to say you did. Over all, nothing impressive about this beer and I won't go out of my way to try it again. Drinkable ... not a drain pourer, but why bother ...","beerphilosopher","Jan 14, 2006"
3.35,2.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"overall- the taste and smell is very similar to amber bock. kinda dissapointing. overall just an average, but refreshing and easy drinking, beer.","Gritsak","Dec 23, 2005"
3.45,5.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The pour is a dark, opaque brownish-reddish with a tan head that starts out small, but lasts until the end of the glass. Roasted malts dominate the mild aroma. The roasted malt flavor has a sweetness to it while earthy hops give this beer a crisp finish. The taste is almost medium bodied, however somebody forgot to tell this to the slightly watery mouthfeel. This beer didn't wow me, but I enjoyed it much more then I thought I would.","goschool","Nov 03, 2005"
3.81,16.2,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"Very crisp and lagericious. I would say that this beer reminds me of a mix between a schwarz and a vienna lager. It was good and drinkable, and it washed the rather exotic food down quite well. Recommended for the apparantly few amount of BA's that have access to it, but don't expect anything particularly mind blowing.","neonbrown82","Mar 17, 2005"
4.03,22.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Note: I like most of my beers on the 'warmer side', but this one really needs a good chilling to go down smooth. Drink straight out of the fridge.","AdvocateFan","Beers"
3.36,2.4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"D- This was definitely a diamond in the .99 cent bin at the liquor store. I'm not really sure it fits into the Euro Dark Lager style cause I don't really drink enough of them to know. It has good balance and is very nice to quaft. I think I will have to try some other brews from Alhambra if I can find them. Is it possible that its a Moorish brewery, I didn't think so.","rhoadsrage","0"
