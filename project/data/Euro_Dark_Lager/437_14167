Not a classic but it is a nice one and certainly one worth trying, particularly if you can find it on-tap anywhere.","flyingpig","Apr 29, 2014"

3.09,-11.5,3.5,3.25,3,3,3,"Overall not nearly as good as most of the beers I had while in Prague. THis tasted more macro like, not a lot of care in the lagering, syrup adjuncts added which brought fake syrup tastes, fusel alcohol flavors despite the low abv, and the green bottle added a hint of skunk. I hope the other bottles aren't as poor as this or I'll be very disappointed.","jlindros","Jul 27, 2013"

3.75,7.4,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Drinkable and pleasant poltmavy beer (as an European I am slightly irritated that there is very detailed classification of American beers on BA.com, but clearly distinct Czech brews are simply assigned very broad ""European"" styles). As much as I have some reservations against Staropramen brewery, I can not deny it is a well made beer.","atis","Jun 11, 2011"

4.1,17.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Appearance is deep brown red with orangish hues. Head doesn't stick around too long and fills the nose with bready malts that are sweet, but not in the molasses way. Almost some citric oj notes come through. Flavor is much the same. Easy to throw back on an empty stomach and entertaining enough to repeat again and again.","allboutbierge","Jul 29, 2009"

3.11,-10.9,3.5,2.5,3,4,3.5,"A red beer, with lace. Bit of malt and cheese in aroma. Decent Vienna. Appropriate carbonation, medium mouthfeel. Slight bitterness and mdoerate sweetness.In the sip there is a touch of fruit, barley,toast,hop. All around balanced. I can drink one, though only the one.","Sammy","Jun 12, 2006"

4.06,16.3,5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark translucent gold color. There is a very light smell which is similar to regular StaroPramen, like the classic lager. The taste however is much more complex that most lagers. It is mildly malty and light on the hops. The thing that surprised me is the layers which the taste hits you, very unexpected from a Staropramen brand. Great overall for heavy drinkers of light sippers.","Toddv29424","Apr 09, 2005"
3.53,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Draught at the brewery beer hall. Served too cold, in the appropriate stylish glass. The beer has a beautiful amber colour, served with a moderate head. Fruity aroma with hints of caramel. Some caramel in the flavour too, but not really sweet. Nutty. Tolerably well hopped.","Sigmund","Mar 30, 2005"
3.48,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This is an interested brew...reminds me of some of the other brews I had in Europe made with hop-extract (Ceres), though somewhat better. A decent beer...better than but compares to something like Heinekin, Amstel, or St.Pauli ""Dark"".","Mitchster","Aug 24, 2004"
3.2,-8.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured a clear orangish red under a thin short-lived tan head that left no collar and no lace. The nose is very mild, with just a touch of metallic hops. The mouth is well carbonated and medium-bodied, with just a touch of sweetness. The taste opens with a heavy malt taste, almost like syrup. The mild but metallic hops come out in the finish, particularly after you've had a few sips. The aftertaste gets stronger, with a mainly bitter impression. The taste grows on you.","Globetrotter","Nov 12, 2003"
