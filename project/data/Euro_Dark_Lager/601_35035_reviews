"This is a big fail. I don't know if the beer is always bad, or I just got a bad/old bottle, but I will not be revisiting either way."

"Astringent, husky toasted grains, dry finish. Not overly sweet thankfully. However it's pretty bland and one-note flavor wise. Not much body, pretty coarse and lacking finesse. Overall not something i'd pick up again."
"O: More of a sipping beer than a sessionable one, a little too sweet to be easy to drink."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has some nice flavors. The taste isn’t very complex, but it would pair well with a meal."
"Tastes of toast, caramel malt, a bit of roasty maybe. Light sweet adjunct flavor happening... Smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation gives a pleasant bite/acidity. Not huge off flavors. After taste is dark malt and slightly sweet. Bitterness and hop presence are minimal but suiting. Pretty good, nothing crazy awesome."

"Pours clear copper-brown beer with moderate tan head, leaving some laces. Smell of caramel malts and dark fruits. Good taste of caramel malts, slightly smoky and roasted, chocolate and fruits. Medium-bodied beerwith high carbonation. Pleasant, but not so well-balanced beer."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a copper color with one finger of khaki colored head. The retention was so-so and it left spots of lacing. The aroma was of cereal grains, a bit of toasted malt and a bit of sweet malt. The flavors were not as appealing however. It tasted a bit skunky with notes of cereal, booze, sweet malt, caramel malt and an underlying flavor of h that seemed to spoil the rest. The mouthfeel was frothy, the body medium and the carbonation a touch too high. I wasn’t really sure what to expect from this one and even after trying it I wasn’t really sure what to think. Personally, it just didn’t appeal to my palate."

"O-I saw this a Cyclone Liquors the other day so I decided to pick it up for 2.49 and was pleasantly suprised for the price considering it is from the Ukraine very good value and really tasty"
"O: As far as European dark lagers go, this one is very enjoyable. If it displayed a more pronounced hop flavor and a little less carbonation, it would be a stellar example of the style. Overall, this is a very solid dark lager, though there is room for improvement."
"Appearance has a red ruby brown color leaving a quickly dissapating head. Smell of mellow malts and hops. Taste of lightly roasted malts with a balanced mellow hop that finishes clean and slightly dry. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Nothing complex, just an easy drinker."
"Overall: A beautiful beer in color. Disappointing head. Great aroma and good flavor. Goes down smooth but leaves you with too much syrup flavor. I would prefer to try this in the Fall/Winter seasons. I may get this again."
"Cracked open a bottle for a Sunday night cap. There were hint of oxidation and prolonged aging, but this was still a fine beer. Sure, I'll say it had a ""velvety"" feel as the label suggests. It's a moderately thick, somewhat sweet (not too sweet) lager that's heavy with dried fruit flavors, notes of roast and caramel, and a hint of leather and cider - from age, I presume. There's a mild balancing bitterness. This really is not a bad beer at all. In the end I'd call it a tasty dessert beer that's not cloying or filling."
"$2.19 or whatever? Hell, there's some flavor there for sure. I'll go in again."
"Poured a 2"" head which pretty quickly dissipated to 1/8"". Dark in color but with a reddish tint when held to the light, no wonder they call it velvet. Smell and taste of barley malt and rye. A very mild beer, easy to drink, in fact the mildness is a surprise considering the darkness. There's also a zingy acidity which is refreshing. Very drinkable. Not a whole lot above a good pilsner but still a fine beer I'd enjoy any time."
"A decent dark lager, nothing eliciting strong oohs or aahs, but still rather balanced and drinkable."
"Not bad. As a decendant of Uke immigrants, I'm somewhat relieved it doesn't suck"
"This would be great with grilled kielbasa, if you want to pay homage to Ukraine. As mentioned, I can drink this by itself. I could see it going well with a big slice of black forest cake -- the hint of cherry and chocolate would pair beautifully with this neat, Euro lager find."
"Poured from a green 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very mild, some malts. Taste is of malts, some caramel sweetness, a bit of hops, good flavor. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"I poured this into a Sam Smith nonic. The appearance looked very good, a mahogany red body, an off-white head with good retention, some lacing on the bottle. Smell is of plums and dark fruit and the taste was just that with a little bit of malts added in. Mouthfeel was medium and smoooth, and I found myself gulping this down"
"D: Having one of these every once and a while would be nice. but not to many..."
"I'm about to read other reviews on this one because the flavor I can't place is bugging me a fair bit. I'm not going to give you a reason not to try this beer, but I'm not going to give you a reason to look for it either."
"A mediocre, unoffensive dark lager with a bit of off flavour the more it warms, although quite forgettable. I'll pass on this next time."
"D - there are some nice flavors here though it would be better if it loses the macro lager skunk and mouthfeel"
"D - Not a bad beer, still has a little ways to go with the cheap lager stank and dank."
"D: I was fairly thirsty when I opened the bottle, but even after only a few sips,was already looking forward to a different beer"
"Sure, one can drink a bunch of these, but why? I'm not sure I'll finish the rest of this bottle, and I would question if it was brewed with reactor water from Chernobyl, but then that was a graphite cooled plant. I will be looking for a more appealing offering from the Ukraine."
"I was most impressed by this beer's smell. It hinted cherry and smoked aromas. It was actually very pleasant. But that smell didn't translate into flavor which was quite frankly very bland. I was not impressed. With so much stuff to try out there I would not do a take 2 on this one."
"I never expected this beer to be so good."
"D: Really a pretty good tasting beer, could be a little bit overcarbonated leading to a somewhat harsh moutfeel but overall pretty darn tasty in my opinion"

"D - Pretty drinkable for the first 500 ml, but with the strong caramel and toffee/coffee notes, food pairing is narrow, working best with smokey foods like barbecue or chocolate cake."
"Medium effervescence was a bit more than expected. Medium body. Good beer but not great (it ain't no Aventinus)."
"A decent malty dark lager with a mid to dark colour and a good head. The nose is subtle but grows as the beer warms.The beer is smooth drinking with a nice malty finish. Not the hugest body of a dark lager but food friendly and well balanced. I prefer the pils but would buy this again."
"The more I think about the more I would relate this too a lot of dunkels I have had. Ok but not worth seeking out."
"Looks a lot like pepsi when poured into my new Spaten Hefe glass. Tan head rushes to the top of the glass before it quickly runs out of steam and settles to a solid 1 inch head that is flush with the top of the glass. It then settles further to a 1/4 inch atop the dark brown beer. I really don't see any carbonation to speak of from the bottom of the glass. The smell is of toasted malt, cookie dough, candi sugar, and mild yeast. The flavor is nothing special but in no way offensive. It has a gentle wave in the flavor profile of toasted grain, sweetness upfront, then a slow and gradual bittering towards the end of the sip. Overall this is a decent session beer if you are in the mood for something similar to a German schwarzbier."
"Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied"
"Overall its not to bad. Nothing spectacular, but I wouldn't avoid it either."
"It's crisp with a good kick. I am a fan."
"Acquired at a JONS supermarket in Hollywood, California, the Obolon Oksamytove is presented in an eye appealing green bottle, with gold and red labeling. A ""best before"" box on the back label remains undated but the bottle and labels are in mint condition. Pouring a deep mahogany brown and featuring a rich 'n tan head accompanied by a dank and slightly sour smell. Upon tasting, the light-to-moderately carbonated smooth mouthfeel is appreciated alongside subtle notes of chocolate. However, as I progress through the glass a tangy bitterness builds, and there is nothing too terribly exciting about this beer that would motivate me to actively seek it or recommend it to friends."
"Drinkability? Well, I'll never drink this stuff again, so draw your own conclusions from that."
"Call me naive, but I actually thought Oksamytove had a chance to be the best Obolon beer of them all. Maybe it was the impressive label, maybe it was the intriguing 'Deep Velvet', who knows? I suspected that I was mistaken on the pour because I smelled what was entering my pint glass. These guys need to go back to the drawing board. Better yet, they need to close down and save the taste buds of a few million Ukrainians."
"M&D: unlike the fiercely fizzy outlook, the mouthfeel is really very smooth, standing up to the beer's name. All's well, very enjoyable, but the flavour profile is slightly too simplistic to make it a real impressive beer. Still, well worth a try!!"
"Full dark Vienna Lager. Great color - dark ruby & mahogany. Intruguing aroma. Full and complex flavor with lots of roasted malts and caramelized sugar. Slightly sour finish, rich afterstaste. Obviously not designed for consummation in large volumes. Recommended!"
"Pours a red brown with a short lived bubbbly tan head. There is a very pleasing malty chew to start things off, followed by some nice hop balance. Not sweet and a good mouthfeel means I enjoy this brew. Tastes keeps with the front of the mouth long after a sip making mouth want more. A decent beer; I'd drink another."
"Poured a clear reddish amber under a thin off-white head that faded quickly and left no lace. While chilled, there is only just a hint of aroma in the nose - sweet malt, if anything. As the beer warms, the malt nose gets more pronounced. The mouth a slightly prickly with a medium body. Caramel opens the taste experience, mild and even. There's a mild but sufficient hoppy bite in the finish, leaving a nice bitter and sweet (but not bittersweet) aftertaste. This beer was a bit thinner than I had hoped, but not bad at all."
