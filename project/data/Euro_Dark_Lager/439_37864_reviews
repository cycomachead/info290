"Pretty poor stout from Portugal"
"-- Falls between a dry Irish - light-bodied and char-heavy - and English stout - sweet and fruity - to end up nowhere. Sickly artificial quality to the sweetness, like certain macro Euro dark lagers. Not roasty enough for schwarz; not enough Munich for dunkel. Still, I’d take it if Sagres was the only alternative. 3.5"

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 4C). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L2617741. AROMA: faint roastiness aromas with some odd artificial aroma. low malt profile with no esters and no diacetyl. APPEARANCE: deep brown color and opaque. medium light brown head with average retention. TASTE: low roasted flavour that lingers into the finish. low bitterness and hop flavours. clean lager profile. finishes medium-dry. PALATE: light body with average carbonation. OVERALL: altough the label says ""Stout", this is indeed an average Schwarzbier (a case of improper advertising?) that could loose the E150c."

"The cost-benefit ratio should be better there in Portugal (of course) than here, particularly because I think our Caracu less watery, although the aftertaste of Super Bock Stout is interesting. Has a certain sweetness (Stout?!)."

"Overall, ok for the price and where I found it. Good to try, but probably won't pick up again."
"O: It's a cheap stout. Not much more to say."

"330ml bottle. Lager glass. Bright brown color, reddish tints to the light & chill haze appearance. Tan froth & quickly dissipated creamy crown. Butiric & cardboard odors followed by caramel, toasted, slight floral & coffee notes. Husky & roasted upfront rounded by dried malt bitterness. Light to medium body. Moderate to moderate high carbonation. Oily to watery texture. Slight metallic hues & low hoppiness linger into a dry bitter finish."

"Started really well but whilst still drinkable, the taste didn't fully back up the look or the smell of the beer. Mainly roasted malts, sweetness and some chocolate but it was a smooth and easy to drink offering so I won't complain too much."
"O: Cool bottle and name. I'm new to Portuguese beers looked pretty cool and gave the illusion of a ‘bock’ a style which I normally like. Disappointed in that it was very watery and had a metallic taste, even a downer for a Euro Dark Lager. Will go well with my steak though."

"A watery stout with an artificial sensation, rather a light dark lager"

"Grainy on the palate, with a cocoa puffs kind of character. Some dark fruit late-mid: plums and sultanas on there. A slight charry note and some nutmeg late. Not bad, but thin. Needs more body and more oomph on the palate. Tastes slightly underattenuated and/or watered-down."

"Not sure it would muster as a Stout here in the UK, more a black lager really in body depth and feel. It's just about OK, I tried it while on holiday and obviously thought it good enough to fly home with me, so it must have something about it, I just can't find whatever that something is anymore!"

"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Dunkel lager (not a stout written on the bottle)."
"O: Decent flavor. Surprisingly okay."

"Served at a pleasant little Tapas Bar, called the Vintage Cafe, in the Rocks - not seen it anywhere else in Sydney. Served too cold, tho. having said that I had two and could quite easily have continued, so sessionable it is, even if no hops to balance out the sweet malts."
"Overall, Super Bock Stout is quite good. I agree that it's really more of a dark lager than a stout - I'm expecting a much more distinct, exotic, love-it-or-hate-it flavor/character from stouts, and this doesn't stray very far from the spirit of mass-produced lagers."
"The sourness and high carbonation take away from drinkability. Just not much going for it."
"D Drinkable, but the sweetness/fruit/anise is a bit much for me to want another. 3    "
"D: Average. Too smooth for a beer claimed ""Stout"""
"Good brew, almost like a 'light' stout. Love to see something like this take hold in the States, & I might have to see out more of the style to see if it's this drinkable. And thank you, Super Bock Stout, for showing up in a beer wasteland & making my stay more comfortable. Salut!"
"Last point, I agree that this is a dark lager and not a stout."
"Definitely not quite a stout, but more robust than a regular Euro Dark Lager."
"This beer pours a jet black colour with a nice frothy one finger cappicino laced head which leaves nice lacing,it has beautiful aromas of dark fruits and dark roasted chocolate/coffee malts,it has an average mouthfeel with a bittersweet coffee/choc taste,not a bad beer thats easy to drink."
"This was my first foray beyond golden lagers in Portugal and I was only mildly impressed. The beer was a nice dark brown color with tan head that went quickly but left nice lacing. It smelled decent, but couldn't make out much beyond very light coffee and caramel tones. Taste was about the same, left me with a smooth mouthfeel. Decent carbonation. Pretty drinkable actually. Had I not found Sagres Preta in Sagres after the one day in Lisbon, I probably would have drank more of this. Thumbs up!"
"On a final note: Make no mistake, it is closer to a Stout rather than to a Euro Dark Lager HOWEVER it is an unimpressive one. Way to bland and lacking a bit of everything that makes a great stout, great. Will not have again."
"D - Decent enough I suppose, it's weak enough to not put you off."
"Overall: despite the name confusion Super Bock Stout is a nice beer. It is not great but can be enjoyed as the richest and the most interesting dark beer in Portugal."
