Pours lightly hazy deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, toast, cocoa, brown sugar, pear, apple, roasted malt, light coffee, light smoke, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with light-moderate yeast esters; and good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, cocoa, roasted malt, pear, apple, light smoke, light coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toast, cocoa, brown sugar, light fruits, smoke, light coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt flavors with light yeast ester fruitiness; and a nice amount of flavor robustness with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, slick, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent "Stein beer" dark lager. All around nice balance, complexity, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 19, 2013"

Flavor has a malty core plus fruity and woody notes and just a touch of caramel. There also seems to be a dusty or dirty tone, perhaps from the rocks used to heat the wort.

Mouthful was slightly chewy; flavor lingered nicely and dissipated just in time to want to take another sip. Has a slight warming effect ABV at 6.5, just low enough I believe to be sessionable, but on the low end. Usually I find any lager to be very filling, but this one wasn’t to bad.

Aromas are a bit of a sweet maltiness, a touch of brown sugar and light caramel candies. Bit of toast and nuts, coupled with faint vanilla sweetness and chocolate, more on the softer side than bitter. Initial is decent bodied, toasty and smoothed out with a nice creaminess. Vanilla, chocolate, caramel, and a good nuttiness round out the base flavors, moving to a light brown sugar, touch of roast and decent bitterness on the backend. The roast and bitterness stay on the palate well, as this beer should be a bit lighter than expected, but still packs pretty good flavor for just a dunkel. The sweetness isn’t cloying, as roast and toast with pretty good hoppiness come in to balance. I liked this beer for what it was, and only qualm may have been that the bitterness and roast on the finish, although enjoyable, could have been smoothed out a bit for a more sessionable experience.","KrautAficionado","Jun 30, 2011"

3.48,-7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"22oz bottle picked up down in OC. This was an interesting beer. I went into this not really knowing what to expect from it. Very malty overall, with a rich sweetness that makes it drink like a bigger bock beer than it is. I would almost call it a doppelbock in the malt department, but the steinbier thing has given it a malt profile that is truly unique and intriguing. Dark red-brown in color with a thick light beige head that leaves a lasting slick after a few minutes. The aroma is sweet and malty with a smooth lager character, caramel, burnt sugars, licorice, and light smoke. The flavor is squarely malt driven and sweet with caramel, some chocolate, burnt marshmallows, dried fruit, light smoke, and a light spicy hop bitterness. Medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation. I liked this beer because of the cool malty flavors, but couldn't help but with it was a little drier or hoppier for balance. By the end of the bomber the sweetness became a little too intense.","bulletrain76","Oct 29, 2009"

Aroma is deeply of rich malt, reminiscent of a black lager, but dialed back a bit. Taste mirrors the nose, maybe the second runnings of a schwartzbier.

Balanced well with spicy hops. Finish is also spicy, but sweeter with the maple syrup everyone reports. Very roasty throughout. It tricks you into thinking its coffee, but my guess is that its from the burnt grain and malt from the super-heated granite. Loved this beer.","magictrokini","May 30, 2009"

I was surprised when I started pouring in that this beer is a lot darker than I was expecting. It has a cola/root beer look to it, and a creamy white heading. One of the best looking beers I have encountered in a while. Nose has some malted milk balls, chocolate, bit of rye and toasted bread. More of the same comes from the taste, which is fine, as all the flavors really work well in unison. Body is somewhere in the middle of light and medium. While it is an easy drinker, sometimes the sweetness of it becomes a bit much. Still let this one unfold, and you will see that there are multiple layers of complexity.

Roasted flavor mixes with an assortment of fruits that don't seem like they should be in a lager. Regardless still very good.

Well, I love rauchbiers, and since it was one of the few lines going I'd never tried, I ordered it. What it is is a tasty schwarzbier with a hint of roastiness from the malt, but certainly not smokey. More of a dark muddy brown than black, it looks, smells, and holds its own. Certainly has some punch, guessing at least 6% ABV. Quite worthwhile trying, though not my new favorite at least after just one go.","byaeger","Mar 21, 2009"
