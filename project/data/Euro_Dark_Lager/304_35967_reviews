"i think i prefer the basic lager to the dark one in this case, it seems a little thin for what it is, and the lager yeast sort of clashes with the mildly tannic grain feel, but i like the beer on the whole, and its one of those darker beers you can have with a big meal, or drink by the pitcher during the game and not get full, so in that context its a winner. there is a nice light brown foam head on it at the pout, but it dissipates rather quickly, leaving a silky medium brown beer with a ruby glow in the bright light. notes of chocolate malt, wheat, and a little oxidation arise in the smell, and the taste holds those aromatics accountable, as the two sensory experiences are essentially identical. finish is longer than it is in other dark lagers, not quite done or something, but the low alcohol and lighter medium body help it drink easy. less of a classic than the original, but there is a nuttiness i like in it, and i appreciate its deep roots. better on draft than in a bottle too."

"A benchmark for dark Czech lagers, no doubt about that."

"330ml bottle. Lager glass. Dark brown color & deep ruby to the light. Tan head, fairly good retention & lacing rings. Noble hop & slight toasted aromas to the nose. Toasted, dried & spicy upfront. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Watery texture. Low bitterness & spicy palate. Dry bitter finish & toasted aftertaste. Easy drinkable."
"A very delicious dark lager with exceptional smoothness and robust flavors. I have to wonder what it might be like if I had a fresh bottle, but this somewhat dated beer has been a very good experience."
"Decent beer, but nothing special. Good if you are looking for a mellow dark lager."
""
"Overall not bad, nothing special, more of that eastern Euro style herbal earthy vegetal like root like malt thing almost like there is a root beer like syrup in it, and raw molasses, etc. decent hops, a little light feeling."
"the best dark lagers are traditionally from Eastern Germany and Czech Republic ... within this geographical region this brew is rather unspectacular, nevertheless a very clean and nifty sample of the style .... there might be more spectacular dark lagers out there, but you don't go wrong with this one ..."

"Taste is similarly dry and roasty, light coffee and toast, clean and smooth without any bitterness. Quite drinkable though it gets a little thin in the body. Lightly carbonated, easily sessionable. It's rare within this style to be dry and not cloyingly sweet, as many EDL's can be. This leans more towards English Porter territory, though it's still unique and very good."

"Originally grabbed this just to get the review but the use of malts here is actually quite nice. A very nice toasted nuttiness and the roasted flavors work well. Awesome balance of malt flavors across the spectrum."

"Overall Impression: A nice alternative to the classic bohemian pilsner. Balancing roasty stout like properties with lager like drinkability, this beer deserves a place in the occasional session."

"Takin' a trip to the dark side of Czech lagers. This stuff pours a deep midnight garnet topped by over a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises mild malted milk balls, light dark greens, and a hint of toast. The taste brings in more of the same, with a bit of a tea-like character pervading the proceedings. The body is a hefty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a pretty tasty dark lager, one that nudges you in the gut with its dark elbows, making sure not to say anything too forward, too offensive, or even too loud. Not bad at all."

"Stick with regular Czechvar."
"O: Cool beer. Nothing super special but with very nice mix of flavors. Better than average dark lager."

"O: very enjoyable!"

"o: really enjoyable. its nice to drink a beer this complex that is under 5% abv."
"Overall a beer that needs to be tried, very recommendable."
""
"O: A nice light dark beer. I'm not wowed by the flavor but it's good."
""
"Peaty brown coloured beer with a head which soon dissipates to a rim job. Roasted malt nose with a hint of marmite. Well carbonated (in the abundance of very small bubbles sense) with a rather woody, very slightly smoky taste. Hops very much relegated to the background as malt dominates. Fairly one dimensional but eminently drinkable."

"O - an outstanding Czech dark lager, although probably at its best here at the brewery. (Trying the beer again many km from the brewery, I find the beer to be indistinguishable from that at the brewery)."
"Carbonation is a bit full on, body feels a bit watery."
"Nice, and very drinkable. The bitter roasted notes that you might expect in a dark lager are attenuated here - as a result it slides down all too easily. Makes a good introduction to the style, and well worth sampling."
"A decent, well flavoured and easy drinking dark lager. Certainly better than a Pale Euro lager and very drinkable."
"Ah , to be in Prague , enjoying the Czech culture and contentedly imbibing this Lager."
"330 ml. bottle. Pours a dark mahogany colour, with a big tanned head leaving a lace all over when it fades. Smell is roasted, like burnt wood, earthy chocolate. Mouth has dried fruits, chocolate and a the burnt wood earthy finish. Medium to light body, I would have like it a little bit more strong. Drinkable and good, but I prefer the usual lager one."
"D: The beer goes down smoothly and is very easy to drink, making it quite sessionable."
"Bottle solicited from Intimex Super Market in Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi. Served in my Budvar glass."
"The original imported dark lager. Nice, almost reminds me of a stout with the dark brown tint and dark beige foam. Gave me two inches of fluffy foam with some light lacing. Smells of coffee and slight metallic smell. Taste is like toffee/coffee, slightly bitter, malts, and some balls. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Drinkability is high, I wish I had picked up more but will seek them out later. Cheers, Budvar! I like you as much as your cousin, regular Budvar. Budweiser is an insult to your heritage."
"A mouth with spicy enough coffee in the aftertaste that gives a fairly strong bitterness (IBU quite high I presume), not necessarily powerful, but very persistent. The nose smells the coffee, but more style cafe macchiato. Full tasting, there are also touches of acidity, almost like a winey side (maybe coffee liqueur). The finish is a little licorice. What makes a strange contrast between the entrance and slightly winey and acid output, completely bitter. This side had advantages in the pale lager but here in the dark lager, it looks worse."
"Thanks to Lukie at Corkers Cellars for this one - the beer was well within expiry and tasted very fresh. I will certainly be buying this again, it is a very complex, drinkable, delicious dark lager."
"Seems like just a bunch of dark malts thrown into regular Budvar. Considering it's a good lager to begin with, that's no bad thing."
"D: A very drinkable beer, one that I could definitely spend an evening with."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but personally, I think the beer lacks body. Most flavors are just not it. Didn't finish this one and will probably not have it again."
"D - Quite decent. The balance of the sweet with the bitter and the lighter body make it drinkable."
"The aroma is mostly dark malt, but there are notes of yeast and sour cherry. Dry."
"Tastes of caramel & toffee, feels of sweet bready maltiness. Great smooth finish. Very drinkable, great easy beer to enjoy while traveling."
"Taste of sweet, bitter chocolate. Bitterness is just at the right level. It balances between quite hoppy and melting with the maltbitterness. Coffee and roasted malts are abundant. A clean malt profile, where the hops are almost hidden, but can still display some spicy, Saaz-like character."
"Overall - A very pleasant one this... nothing groundbreaking but a well made and very quaffable example of a dark lager..."
"Everytime I drink this dark lager I am reminded of coffee and just the slightest hint of burnt caramel - two of my favourite flavours. The colour is more of a very very dark red than black, and the head is usually tinged with a slight brown. The head is usually about an inch deep and disappears quite quickly. In the mouth, this lager manages to be a paradox of smoothness and bitterness, a paradox I like muchly."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, good carbonation, and enough body to lend enjoyability, but without hurting an extremely high drinkability."
"M&D: the body is just about right to match its low alc. strength, while the texture is softly-spritzy and quite clean, without any undesirable sugary or sticky finishing touch as happens in quite a few sweet dark lagers made in Europe. Overall the condition is not bad at all, but compared with my first encounter with this beer in the Czech Republic, which was as fresh and perfect as it could get, this beer is strangely much milder and boring. I wonder if it's to do with the psychological effect of drinking local beers in the local area? All in all, a solid beer without much complexity to play with on the palate."
"I like this beer and think that I could drink more than one in a session-but I am not sure if I would drink it all night long."
"I quite like this beer at it never dissapoints and at the moment I have a few in the fridge!"
"Excellent mouthfeel due to the maltyness. Very drinkable and would be a pleasure to drink as my everyday beer, if I were a resident of Prague."
"D - Much prefer dark Bohemian lagers to the light. A nice offering, but not the most flavoursome out there."
"This is an OK beer, not one I will rush out and find again, but drinkable."
"D - An OK beer which quenches the thirst, but not overly interesting."
"Pours a clear dark brown under a 1.5 finger off-white head that fades fairly slowly to thick film and collar. Sweet caramel nose, both strong and enticing. The mouth is well-carbonated, light but fairly sticky. Nice combination here of candy sweet caramel and roasted nuts, followed by smoe mild dry hops. The caramel lasts the longest, leaving a sweet aftertaste accented by a touch of bitter. Nice product, tasty and refreshing."
"Pleasant."
