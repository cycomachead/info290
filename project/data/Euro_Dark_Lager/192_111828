Aromas of toasted nut sweetness, subtle cream highlights, hints of grain, subtle coffee bitterness, and some light cocoa highlights.  The flavors are roasted and richly sweet forward, again heavy on the nutty characteristics, with a tangy cream tone this time.  The roasting coincides with a subtle coffee highlight to provide enough bitterness to balance throughout.  The body is light and smooth, with a tangy sweet, nutty, lingering aftertaste.  The finish is smooth and lingering, as well.  Easy drinker, and very flavorful.","GarthDanielson","Aug 20, 2014"

The somewhat ashy nature applies to the texture as well and, again, it works here. The crispness is light but firm, and the light body isn't "watery" or shallow. A creamy smoothness starts right off with the crispness on the tip of the tongue and carries through into the woody finish.","Brenden","May 05, 2014"

Aroma deep cocoa brown chocolate with cola brown sugars going on, a very nice creamy nose. Overall flavors I recommend letting it warm up a bit you'll get toasted bread, fruit notes, and dark chocolate combining into a nice sort of schwarzbier filler from their typical 1554 Black Ale available in the past. Mouthfeel is creamy dark chocolate cookie dough soft flowing carbonation goes down way too smooth.
