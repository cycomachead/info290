"Dark chocolately but surprisingly light to medium bodied.  Easy drinking and smooth-finishing.  This is not bad at all."
""
"This is a very good Black Lager that I try to keep in my fridge."
"Dark, roasty, coffee, chocolate, crisp and f'in delicious. This beer should always be in my fridge and I can't believe it doesn't get more love."
"Delicious ale from New Belgium."

"i like black lagers. this wasn't bad"

"Nice easy drink!  Love it.. Pours dark, small head, and leaves no lace behind.  But also leaves no harsh after taste.  Definitely drink it again!"

"A solid good dark beer!"

"One of the beat beers out there to have with a good hamburger...!!!"

"Pours with a small, light brown head. Has a very dark brown color. Has aromas of malts, hops, and chocolate. Hops and malts are also present in taste with a slight chocolate finish."
"Dark brown, nearly black minimal head, little lacing. Aroma was pretty much only dark roasty malts. Taste was a bit of dark roast malt, a slight touch of chocolate. Mouthfeel was pretty light for a darker beer, didn't linger on the tongue much. Not at all a bad beer, but not great either."
"nice lager, medium dark, smooth coffee, and semi sweet chocolate flavor, clean smooth flavor, little after taste, relax and enjoy a few on a  cold day with a close friend,"

"I've had a strong craving for dark lagers after returning from the Czech Republic, so I was happy to see this on the shelves of my local Whole Foods. It's a light-body beer with notes of toffee, caramel, and roasted coffee. Perhaps sweeter than I'm familiar with, but very pleasant for stout-lovers stuck in summer weather."
""
""
"One of the best dark lagers I have had that is for a good price."
""
"  Overall, I'll give 1554 Black Lager - New Belgium Brewing a 4.25. If it were just a hair more savory, I would have rated this higher. It could certainly have a little more to it; then this would be phenomenal. I may or may not pick this brew up again. It was part of the Folly variety pack recently released around here (Stark County, OH) , so I honestly don't know if its available for individual sale."

"Very nice I like how much"
""

"Not a bad beer kinda watered down with a little carbonation and some chocolate undertones"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice black lager.  The roast is pleasing and balances well with the other malts. Would recommend trying if your looking for a fresh Schwarzbier in the US and you can get it just about anywhere."
"Black lagers are hard to come by, and New Belgium does a great job on this one. Dark in color but the mouth feel is super light."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent black lager drinkable worth a try"
"Now, 1554 seems like nothing special.  It's certainly OK. and I'm drinking all of the 6 pack I bought.  But it's not as tasty as a really good lager, and not as interesting as a dark beer as any of the porters I can think of.  Neither fish nor fowl.  Just kind of bleh."
""

"Love me some new Belgium. I stick to my roots. Perfect mix of malt and freshness."
"The same as the Enlightened Black Ale--and thus underrated."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this beer.  Pours thick and dark brown with minimal tan head.  Not strong on the nose, but there is a slight dark malt scent. Medium to heavy body. Very light on the lager taste, comes off like a light porter.  Very drinkable, and I could see drinking plenty by a campfire."
""
"A nice smooth finish and soft, dark taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Completely agree with Arch578's review. (a few reviews below this one)"
"Overall - very nice. I'd say quite comparable to Guinness with a different taste. 1554 contains much more toasty flavor."
""
"12 oz bottle poured into an undersized hotel glass on a Montana ski trip. I love black lagers, so was excited to find this NB take on the style. It is sweeter than I usually prefer, with plenty of chocolate, a hint of coffee, and a very dry finish. In some ways, this seems like a beer that forgets to be a beer, if that makes sense."
""
"Really not impressed with this beer. Nothing special about its appearance or aroma, and the taste just reminded me of a cheap porter. I understand that lagers are usually meant to be more drinkable, but I feel this one went beyond drinkability to the point of lacking body and depth. I'm not particularly fond of the style to begin with, but I don't think this beer lived up to what a schwarzbier can and should be."
""
"O - But for the nose, this would be jumping into my main beer rotation.  The taste and drinkability are a great combination, and the flavors offer sufficient variety and depth to offer different aspects to focus upon with each drink.  So it will be something I'll grab occasionally, instead."

"Fat Tire was my favorite until I tried this beer, perfect blend of spices, not too heavy and surprisingly refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer overall but disappointing."
""
"This is by far the best offering from New Belgium I have had - and without a doubt the best black lager I've ever had as well.  The dang thing didn't look like a lager (it looked like a Guinness), it didn't taste like a lager - way much richer and full bodied, and it sure didn't feel like one (not so carbonated to take away from the tasting experience.)  I don;t know if this is a sessionable beer, but for me it certainly will be in the future..."

""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is roasted malts, chocolate, sweet, very easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."

"Fantastic beer. The chocolate flavor lingers on my tongue and the coloring is just gorgeous. One of my favorites to have with breakfast after a night at work. In fact, it has dethroned a few others now. It is delicious."
""
"Dark dry chocolate notes and character around a toasty, biscuit malt lager.  Highly drinkable and a crisp finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a frozen thick glass 24 oz mug.  Thick persistent amber head.  Fruity on the nose.  Crisp front palate followed by a smoooooooth finish carrying a moderate hint of malted dark chocolate (I'm not a fan of chocolate tasting beers, but this is different).  I may be giving this a higher score than most as the beer is clearly not complicated.  Yet I would argue that our early brew masters never intended for beer to be complicated.  .....  Yet, I'm sure that in 1554 this beer was considered by most a quite complicated.  I know we're also not meant to allow our emotions to come into the analysis, but I love this beer"

"Overall, this is a decent dark lager thatâ€™s sweeter than it is roasty.  Nothing to write home about, but not bad either."

"Dark reddish brown with disappearing off-white head. Aroma of chestnuts, light hazelnut, herbal notes, and mild cocoa. Tastes of chestnut, hazelnut, little cola, cocoa nibs, some herbal notes. Light bodied with light carbonation. A crisp, refined black lager that doesn't get too toasty. Well done."
"I love this stuff.  The dark roast of the malt makes me imagine of a kind of proto-schwarzbier, that, according to New Belguim, was being brewed in 1554."

"An okay version of a Black Lager, not their best..."

"Very descent Schwarzbier with not to lose to the Euro counterparties. This is a lager packed with dark chocolate flavors, not overly sweet and with huge drinkability."

"O-Not what I typically drink, but it works better than anticipated.  A solid beer for those that like dark beers but shy away from bone dry, thin stouts and huge, high alcohol imperials."

"Impressed although I think Unita's Black Lager is a step better this is a damn good beer. Excellent addition to their current selection, bought an entire 6 pack."

"The only other black lager that I ever had was by Guinness, and I found it somewhat boring.  This one's a different story.  Very good taste and a chocolaty edge.  Give it a shot."

"O-Having had the New Belgium black ale numerous times, I didn't even notice this was the lager when I bought it. Anyway, there are similarities between to the two in their flavor profiles, which are both decent enough malt-forward, drinkable dark beers. Nothing spectacular here, but definitely worth a try when you want to break your routine of IIPAs and RISs and the like."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, brown color, crystal clear, with a chestnut hue around the edges, and a filmy, clingy, dense, cream colored head.  Aromas of toasted nut sweetness, subtle cream highlights, hints of grain, subtle coffee bitterness, and some light cocoa highlights.  The flavors are roasted and richly sweet forward, again heavy on the nutty characteristics, with a tangy cream tone this time.  The roasting coincides with a subtle coffee highlight to provide enough bitterness to balance throughout.  The body is light and smooth, with a tangy sweet, nutty, lingering aftertaste.  The finish is smooth and lingering, as well.  Easy drinker, and very flavorful."

"For a ""not so handcrafted"" beer this is a wonderful example of a beer that's just enjoyable along with moving (average uneducated American beer drinkers) into something that's not piss yellow made from nothing. NBB is a go to beer for just about anyone."
""

"As an aside, I'm curious why Sam Adams Black Lager counts as a Schwarzbier but New Belgium 1554 Black lager gets stuck in the Euro Dark Lager category."
""
""
""
"That same sweetness keeps this beer from getting too sweet too soon, easing into the dryness the same way the flavor does. The somewhat ashy nature applies to the texture as well and, again, it works here. The crispness is light but firm, and the light body isn't ""watery"" or shallow. A creamy smoothness starts right off with the crispness on the tip of the tongue and carries through into the woody finish."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with good amounts of carbonation, and a little bit of a sticky finish. Overall, this is a good dark lager with nice flavors, good balance, a clean finish, and it looks great. Not my favorite style ever, but an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
" This is one to leave out the fridge for 15-20 min. Much better. Nice lacing on the mug. Overall nice brew."
""

"Black in color,but it does allow some light through when held up to the light. I see a half inch head of khaki colored foam. Brussels lacing. I get caramel and chocolate notes in the aroma. The body is smooth and creamy. I get dark malt and a light bitterness on the front of the palate. The finish brings out the sweet chocolate notes. The flavor seems a bit muted."
"The NB 1554 Black Lager is a decent offering. The beer poured a nearly opaque dark with creamy slightly offwhite head that is leaving a lace. The scent carries slight roast corn flare. The taste starts with a roast grain then turns slightly bitter and finally finishes a little sweet. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a decent sessionable beer."

"O: Easy to drink and somewhat refreshing though not overly interesting. I would perhaps order it again but I would not seek it out. Alcohol is well hidden."

"Overall: A refreshing and drinkable beer. It's crisp and clean, but all in all ... does not do much to stand out from the pack."

"Overall it's a great beer. New Belgium gets a lot of flack because they are growing into such a huge industry, but that should every businesses' goal. TO GROW. Good beer is good beer no matter how big the brewery is. New Belgium keeps growing without sacrificing quality and I keep buying."
""

""

"Overall - It is pretty decent beer, easy to drink a few of them."

""
""

"Overall - Decent but nothing to special. Kind of like a hybrid porter/lager. Its a bit weak in the flavor though. But in all, very smooth and easy to drink, but at the same time very easy to forget."

"The taste rocks like it's 1599. A nice balanced beer and very mild for the style, but very drinkable. It is missing the overly roast flavor most black lagers have, and that's a good thing. Extremely sessionable."
""
""
"Best by July 2014, nice dark crimson brown body with a big tan head fine speckled lacing left down the sides of my glass. Aroma deep cocoa brown chocolate with cola brown sugars going on, a very nice creamy nose. Overall flavors I recommend letting it warm up a bit you'll get toasted bread, fruit notes, and dark chocolate combining into a nice sort of schwarzbier filler from their typical 1554 Black Ale available in the past. Mouthfeel is creamy dark chocolate cookie dough soft flowing carbonation goes down way too smooth. Overall I'm into this beer and I can't wait to try more from New Belgium!!!"
""
""
"O- I've had this beer before and I like it. A little robust for a black lager but I ain't complaining. I would definitely drink this again. Another New Belgium brew that has high marks."
