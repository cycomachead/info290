Smells of caramel, butterscotch, Hershey's chocolate syrup, light bit of roasted grains with little to no hop presence. Taste is sweet with chocolate, vanilla, caramel, hints of coffee. There's barely any lupulin to be found in this brew and the sweetness builds because of it. Medium body and carbonation level with a creamy syrupy mouthfeel. Sweetness aside this is not a bad brew. The label claims they use cacao nibs in this, I was thinking it taste more like chocolate extract myself. I'll bet this would be good over ice cream.","johnnnniee","Nov 25, 2011"

Taste is of chocolate, toasted marshmallows, vanilla, and roasted malts. A bit earthy. This is a lighter, crisp beer that strikes a good balance with the chocolate flavor. A lot easier to drink than most chocolate beers. This is one of the best beers of the Winter Mix 12 pack. Just like the Big Moose Ale, I wouldn't mind seeing this in its own six pack.

Stickiness is quite impressive, good lacing remaing on the sides of the glass. Smell is of musty noble hops and a funky cardboard aroma. Some caramel and faint chocolate malt in the nose. Just a weak aroma overall. Charred birch bark up front with a subtle malt sweetness of cocoa powder. Taste is a bit "blah" to me. Dirty aftertaste of hay and mud with lemon. Slick watery feel with an almost medium body. Flowing carbonation from start to finish. I don't know about this beer. It's inviting with "Chocolate" in the title, but doesn't live up to it.

The taste is mostly roasted malts with a little bit of bitter chocolate characteristic with an emphasis on the bitter. The beer has a decent amount of carbonation and a fairly thick mouthfeel, but sits a little heavy for me to consider drinking more than one at a time if I ever even grab it again.

We are talking complete brown-black color that more looks thick than creamy. The head was also probably the darkest foam I have seen in awhile. Its smells are pretty faint for what I expected: roasty aromas of mainly light malts and caramel. But really no chocolate I could detect. The taste did have more of a chocolate taste but it was so light and wrapped around some coffee-ish flavors that it really minimized that flavor. Mouthfeel really got me disappointed. The drink was really watery and lacked any punch to it, especially with those flavors; way too carbonated I would say. Overall, it is approachable and accessible since it lacked any overpowering qualities, but that also hinders it from really actualizing some potential.","fitzy84","Dec 11, 2007"

3.25,-0.6,3,3,3,4.5,3.5,"Pours a very deep brown, although it looks more like it's from the chocolate instead of being a dark lager. Decent head and lacing. Nice chocolate scent, but not very much else. For a lager of any kind I would say it's weak, but it gives the chocolate scent as promised by its name. Same for the taste. It's almost like chocolate milk, but with beer. Not much to taste from the lager side, as it's covered up by the chocolate. Then again, if you don't like chocolate style beers, you shouldn't be trying this one. It goes down very, very smoothly. It would be easy to drink a few of these, if you like the flavor, although too many and it will sit in your stomach like several chocolate milks would. It won't be a problem to finish these off, but I'd prefer a hint of chocolate flavor, instead of nothing but chocolate flavor.","JamesS","Dec 04, 2007"

The body is medium but still manages to give off a wholesome feel, if that makes sense. The namesake chocolate is accompanied in the taste by a toasted barley aspect. Its very roasty and borderline smokey in nature. Still the bitterness of the dark chocolate edge is what defines this brew. It finishes bitterly and a tad dry, with some nice earthen grit.

It starts off impressively enough; essentially black with a good sized creamy tan head. Light barely penetrates on the very sides when held up to the light. It smells very strongly of malt with a sweetness mixed with a roastiness. The taste begins rather sweet, but a roastiness quickly joins it. The roasted element imparts a bit of a bittersweet chocolate element, the first appearance of its namesake. The taste isn't bad, it's just a bit bland and boring. The mouthfeel is lacking; it starts with a huge burst of carbonation and finishes very thin and watery. The drinkability is fine because it's so light.

Head retention was okay with lacing throughout the sitting. It's smell and taste, however, are rather average. Sweet smells of molasses are counterbalanced by a bitter aftertaste of what I think is baker's chocolate and burnt coffee, kind of chalky. Slightly heavy in its complexity so I would not expect to drink too many of these in one sitting.

The taste was not as good as the smell, as it had a very bitter chocolate taste to it, somewhat like baker's chocolate. I'm sure everyone's got a story about when they were a kid and "snuck" what they thought was regular chocolate, but turned out to be baker's chocolate. That is what this was kind of like. It wasn't totally unbearable, but it was nothing to get excited about either. This beer was a little bit too filling for me to have another, so I'll have to sit that out.

Taste is unusual, roasty and chocolaty, quite unlike most amber I've had. But I just don't feel the chocolate flavor contributes to this beer. Perhaps a floral or fruity aftertaste. The aftertaste is slightly bitter and dry. Mouthfeel is more light than heavy. This is ok, but I would probably look elsewhere if I wanted an amber.","RocketWidget","May 06, 2005"
3.46,5.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability/comments: This was certainly better than I expected. While it lacks the sheer drinkability of a schwarzbier, it's a good beer which I'll have to make a session out of in the future.","sprackops","Feb 17, 2005"

3.16,-3.4,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Dark chocolate brown pour which still allows a fair amount of my florescent bulbs glow to pass through. Slight off white head casually floating on top. Malty nose with a touch of hops in the background, no chocolate to speak of. A very weak smell overall. With the taste, again no chocolate, but I do find a bit of lightly toasted malts. The same kind of flavor that I typically associate with a porter without a lot of black patent in it. Finish is a much like a typical lager. Besides that I dont pick up much else. Mouthfeel is thin and the flavor disappears quickly. Drinkability is decent, but only because there isnt much flavor to turn you off with.","blitz134","Jan 25, 2005"
3.28,0.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a very small flourish of a tan-colored head. Aroma of dark roasted malt tempered by just a whiff of hops. Palate is more roasted malt balanced by light hops, a touch of chocolate, and notes of brown sugar and caramel. Medium, slightly creamy body is decent for a lager. Aftertaste of sweet malt lingers for a while. Not a beer I'd like to drink a lot of, but it's certainly decent on occasion.","ElGordo","Jan 20, 2005"
3.09,-5.5,4.5,3,3,3,3,"Chestnut with hints of plum - very creamy, sticky, retentive oatmeal head. Aroma is thin biscuit with hints of metal, coffee, and toffee. Rather simple flavor. Malt is one-dimensional caramel and only subtly so. Not as chocolatey as expected. Nondescript hop flavor is quite prominent. Thin but very smooth; reminiscent of nitro. An average beer, I would consider having it again.","waughbrew","Jan 17, 2005"
3.58,9.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Poured fron a 12 ounce bottle pulled out of this year's Classic Beer Style sampler. Color is dark clear cola, head bubbly and foamy, disappearing fairly quickly. Nose is subdued, some faint malts, and something else I can't discern. Tastes of sweet and toasted malt, with some subtle dark chocolate in the finish. The dark chocolate finish hangs on the tongue like a dusting of dark cocoa. A bit of hops offsets the maltiness that is there. Mouthfeel is light to moderate, with light carbonation. This is a pleasant dark lager, drinks easily.","babydoc","Jan 09, 2005"
3.35,2.4,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer basically looks more like root beer than it does real beer, with a crystal clear body and little head and lace. The smell is fairly weak, mostly of wet malts, yeast, and a little bit of burn molassas. The taste is not too bad, although the aftertaste is a bit sharp and, well, I cant really put my finger on what the taste is. The body of the taste is basically a slightly upscale lager with some sweet tastes of roast coffee (very slight) and a bit of chocolate, but not really that much. Its all underpinned by the regular old taste of a lager. Its drinkable sure, just not much of a drinking experience.","FranklinPCombs","Jan 06, 2005"
3.15,-3.7,4.5,2,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall I found this beer slightly puzzling between the aroma, subdued flavor and seemingly light body. It had potential that it doesn't fully reach. I think my qualms with this are amplified because I drank it in a critical context, and so if I were just sipping on these at a party I'd probably find little to gripe about.","VoodooBrew","Jan 02, 2005"

The smell was of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts. The taste was of roasted malts at the beginning, then fading into a dark chocolate taste, then finishing with a coffee aftertaste, but it was all very weak. The mouthfeel was a bit thin, but rather smooth. I cant say that I really enjoyed this one. I'm sure I will not be getting any more of these.","soulfly967","Dec 19, 2004"

A decently tasty wintertime lager which is conceptually more impressive than its realty.","Cadyfatcat","Dec 06, 2004"
3.39,3.7,4.5,3,3,4,4,"Reddish, woody body with a full cream-colored head. Nearly a picture of perfection. But it slides a bit downhill from there. A fairly ubiquitous, non-descript lager/brown ale type aroma. Some caramel malts, some husky breadiness. Not much else. More caramel apple than chocolate in the flavor, which does present some more distinct characteristics than the nose. Just the tiniest bit of fruitiness with a caramel twist and hints of cocoa. I can imagine some folks finding this a bit annoying, but I find it quite inoffensive. Not interesting, not unique, not great. But pretty drinkable on a cold football Sunday.","marburg","Dec 06, 2004"

It has a nice malty scent that is slightly chocolatey and has a roasted barley aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes chocolatey and slightly dry. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good brew.

I really enjoy the complexity, yet it's ability to remain an easy drinking lager. The flavor has qualities of dark roast, including a slightly burnt quality and aspects of fruitiness. It strikes it's peak at a temperature between lager cold and ale warm. Really quite nice. Feel is a little light, but within reason for a lager. Really nice looking beer, holding a steady head and showing some lacing. I wouldn't consider it a winter beer, as advertised, but it could make a decent session beer.","garymuchow","May 18, 2003"

The chocolate is mild but intreging. I'd happy buy a case of this or drink way too much of this if it was on draft somewhere. This would make a wonderful session beer. Maybe not a session beer I'd want every time, but definitely one to be on the list. This is a wonderful little beer.","Scoats","Apr 04, 2003"
3.61,10.4,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear, reddish-mahogany body; topped by a full and frothy ivory head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace; always maintaining a thin, creamy surface covering. The aroma is limited to some mild, fairly non-descript malt. The body is medium and it's fine and moderate carbonation leaves it lightly crisp and smooth on the tongue. It's not at all creamy, however, and I kind of wish there was something going on to give the beer some more character. The flavor delivers exactly what might be expected from the name with some caramel maltiness that's enhanced by a soft roastiness. There's a mild chocolatey note and some berry-like fruitiness that add to it's character. It's well-balanced with the hop bitterness supporting the darkish malt. It's roastiness add to the dryness of its short-lived finish with some residual caramel notes as well. Fairly interesting and well done, but nothing spectacular.","NeroFiddled","Mar 23, 2003"

I am at the halfway point of the 12 beer sampler having just finished #6, I would still recommend the purchase, for 9.99 it's a good deal.

The aftertaste has a somewhat metallic quality to it that I did not notice until after a few sips. The mouthfeel is rather smooth, with the carbonation being subdued on the tongue.

3.78,15.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Dark brown appearance, respectable layer of tan foam. The emphasis is obviously on the chocoalte malt here both in aroma and flavor. But it's not necessarily a one dimensional beer. Roasted malt bitterness offests the semi-sweet chocolate nicely. Just enough complexity in flavor to keep things interesting, but not so much to be distracting. I think Saranac deserves a lot of credit for crafting such a diverse lineup of beers and for continuing to be adventurous.","John","Dec 03, 2002"

The bitterness seems to be more due to roasted malt than hops, which don't seem to be present to any large degree.

A little bit of roastedness.  No chocolate malt or plain chocolate appears on my palate.  It's a pretty bland beer.  Body is closer to light than to medium.  This one doesn't do jackshit for me.

Creamy body and a full approach to a roasty chocolate flavor with nice hop balance late in the mouth.  I compare this favorably to Leinenkugel's Creamy Dark Lager, which is more grainy and strident up front.  The Saranac has superior mouthfeel -- not a brew to kill for but a nice drinkable micro.","ADR","Nov 13, 2002"
