Spotty lacing is seen that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is mostly of sweet dark roasted malts with a hint of dark fruits. Pretty much the same for the taste with a hint of dark bread also. Very smooth and goes down easy. Forgot how good this one is. I like this much better that the regular Heini that comes in the green bottle. Medium-bodied with medium carbonation. Overall a great brew!","BeerWithMike","Nov 23, 2014"

It has a faint sweet roasted smell, nothing grand. Malt is the star of the show here, and some toasty caramel as the brew warms a little. Great feel - it is just as good an easy drinking brew as I remembered it to be. If you want an extra delicious dark style, go Doppelbock - this is just meant to be a straightforward, sessionable brew. And if you want the regular Heineken Lager from the store to taste less skunky, go with the can for a fresher taste. I have no problems with Heineken, but the Dark especially makes me smile.","angusdegraosta","Mar 04, 2014"

Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very caramel-like with a hint of smoke on the tongue. Finish was likewise faintly smoky and semi-dry, not sweet at all.

I cannot really name what makes this wonderful flavor except for one of those things being hops. I can taste malt there also. it has a sort of dry, tannish brown head. the head gets medium large. the color of the beer itself is about lighter than guinness but darker than an amber ale. it almost has the consistency and color of guinness but lighter. the smell is kind of of caramel because of how the whole beer yields that certain taste. the taste is, in my opinion, delicious enough making it very smooth. the caramel taste is very very pleasing in this beer. it being very smooth makes it easy to drink. I drank it down within ten minutes because its pleasing and smooth. I really like this beer. if you don't like dark beers, don't try it, but if you do this is a must try. being one who has guinness as the favorite beer this one fights to be up there with guinness.

The taste follows suit, with some slightly darker caramel, some very light cocoa backing that up, and a slightly less-vague sense of the mandarin orange syrup. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised by this beer.

I asked the server, and he replied it was Heineken Dark. I hadn't had one before, so I gave a bottle a try. Poured into a short stemmed water goblet. Dark brown color with red highlights. Got a decent sized head with a sturdy pour. Smell was bready and malty. The flavor was actually decent. It reminded me a bit of a cross between a brown ale and a dubbel; it had the similar flavor profile of each. A bit malty like a brown, but a touch of sweetness as in a Belgian ale. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin but smooth. Drinkability was surprisingly good for a Euro dark beer.

It pours a nice amber, copper color, very clear, clean, with a decent off white head that hangs around a bit and laces too. The smell is nutty malts, caramel, and an off medicinal quality, although some of the off smells dissipate as things settle. The smell is the weakest link. The taste is subdued, it has a nice caramel backbone, plenty of caramelized malts, some roasted flavors, and a bit of a metallic edge as well. The beer is approaching a medium body with not much carbonation. The finish is a bit off and that's where some of the metallic flavors emerge. Not much aftertaste one way or another.

Flavors are all the same, with emphasis on the toasted grains. I'm not convinced that this is an all-malt brew.

I will confess that my expectations were not set very high for this brew, and although it didnt surpass my expectations by any great degree I still find it drinkable and not unpleasant with a meal.

It's one of the worst beers out there, and its high price and huge popularity constantly infuriate me. Heineken's trademark skunky flavor has been the subject of countless beer-geek discussions, and I for one have resolved never to touch the stuff again. So when I stumbled across a sample of Heineken Dark, I wasn't sure what to expect. I approached the beer with an open mind, and was pleased to discover it didn't have the sewerlike skunkiness that makes their regular pisslager so hateful. So is the beer a success? Does it redeem the Dutch as a nation of beermakers? (I hate Grolsch and Amstel too.) Not exactly. The beer is too sweet and remains cloying long after the swallow. I've experienced good German dunkel lagers, and I recognize that the big malt sweetness is a force to be reckoned with, and that a delicate interplay with the hops is necessary to keep the beer from going overboard. However, either the makers of Heiny don't know jack about hops, or wanted to make the beer as licorice-sweet as possible to appeal to the tasteless masses. A somewhat appealing dark ruby liquid sustains a buoyant, persistent head, with a heaping aroma of sweet caramel and molasses. The flavor is initially appealing, but there is no dryness, no finish, simply a lingering sweetness that tastes like red licorice (a confection I hate with a similar acuity to that of yellow Heineken). The beer is not BAD; in fact with the proper caramelized dish it might be pleasing. At this particular moment in time, though, it is too sweet, too cloying, although I am pleased to say it is not nearly as disgustingly bile-inducing as that dribble that comes in the green bottles.","Thrasher","Oct 29, 2004"

I know what the idea is that theyre going for, but theyre keeping the flavor low-key to attract the people who dont like the taste of beer.

3.68,14.6,4,3.5,4,4,3,"Smells strong of malt with a malty, bready taste. The beer says what it needs to say, lets you think about it for a bit, then goes away and expects you to take another sip. I could have one or two of these, but I'm certainly not sitting back with a six pack to pass the waning hours. Worth a try if it's free, like this one was.","fdrich29","Mar 26, 2004"

The smell was light and sweet with no real great overtones of anything other than malt. The drink starts very sweet with a slight hop bite in the middle followed by a smooth clean finish with little or no aftertaste. This would make a great lawnmower beer.","coasterfreak75","Mar 15, 2004"

3.1,-3.4,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Clear tea-like brown color with a middling head in size and overall duration. Laces in spare simple strings. Some pumpernickle to the overall bready aroma. Mouthfeel is a tad on the watery side, the flavor is pleasantly neutral in malt sweetness with a decided graininess to add some texture. Low degree of hoppiness overall. The finish is the most distinct part of the beer, light but dry with a continued grain fabric. The attenuation and non-threatening middle-of-the-road flavor leads me to believe that a lot of people could find this brew accessible.","ADR","Feb 17, 2004"
3.35,4.4,4,4,3,2.5,3.5,"If you have to drink Heineken this is the one to get. I have a nostalgiac affection for this beer as it was the very first ""dark"" beer that I tried, long before I was on the craft brew path. It pours a deep mahogany with a beige head that quickly disappears. The aroma is of burnt toast, roasted nuts and bittersweet chocolate, very appealing, IMO. Unfortunately the taste doesn't back up the promise of the aroma. Toasty, roasted grain flavors come through in the flavor with some non-descript, simple sweetness. Not bad, just not enough oomph. It's a very clean brew that could use a bit more malt to add some character and mouthfeel. Still, this is not a bad choice if you're looking for a light-bodied dark beer.","johnrobe","Feb 02, 2004"
3.38,5.3,4,3.5,3,3,4,"A nice deep maroon color, with a creamy tan head. Smells of roasted malt and sweetness. This is much better than heineken lager.

2.96,-7.8,3,2,3.5,3,3,"Wow, I was shocked when I tried this beer. I was expecting the flavor of heineken lager - which I do not care for, but it was not the case with this beer. This beer was totally different. Taste was very sweet and nutty. Since it is a dark beer, I was expecting some sweetness, but I could not believe how sweet this beer was. I drank this beer twice, since I really do like it. I did however get a slight stomach ache afterwards. Wasn't sure if it was the beer so I drank it again another day but got the same feeling in my stomach again. Weird because the beer tastes great. I would definately drink this beer again if I didn't feel sick after drinking it.","palma","Dec 13, 2003"
2.68,-16.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Bottom line: If you like malty flavors, and you are at a bar with a limited beer selection, give Heine Dark a try. Otherwise, it is simply a medicore dark lager.","skar","Oct 31, 2003"

The taste was malty as well with a little bit of hops at the end. The mouthfeel was very good. It was nice and meaty and had well rounded edges in accords to cabonation. I could make this a session beer easily.","Ellbert","Oct 30, 2003"
3.63,13.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I can't believe I am saying this, but for a beer brewed by Heineken this is a fairly decent beer. It poured a medium sized tan rocky head with fine-medium sized bubbles that mostly diminished. There was carbonation observed and it had an opaque body with a reddish-brown hue. The nose consisted of malt and caramel with a sweet brown flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth, slightly tingly, thin textured, and light-medium bodied. The downside is that it lacks in the flavor department.","hotstuff","Oct 28, 2003"

I really had decent hopes for this one because I thought that since it was dark, it would be decent - not sucky like normal Heineken. I was wrong. The taste was a little malty, but pretty crappy and enjoyable - the taste was very reminescent of normal Heineken with a bit more sweetness. Didn't like it much.","clvand0","Jul 19, 2003"

2.14,-33.3,3.5,2,2,2.5,2,"Deep mahogany body really throws off some red highlights, topped by a decent but loose light tan head that relatively quickly fades to nothing. Aroma of slight whiskey malt and old socks. Maybe moldy malt. Taste is slightly better, with a wet grain taste that gives way to a touch of roastiness. Hint of bitterness on the dry finish. Actually quite astringent. Mouthfeel is harsh, with moderate but noticeable carbonation atop a weak body. Drinkability is poor. This is a typical macro style lager with a bit more character, but I still don't care for it.","aaronh","Jun 26, 2003"

Taste is pleasing to the palate, with notes of light roasted malt that offers a bit of dryness, minimal hop bitterness..just enough perhaps, and again, some scant caramel flavors pop up midway. Finshes smooth and satisfying with a light, light bittersweetness that quietly fades away. Fresh samples really make all the difference here. A great intro to dark beers for someone curious about them.","beerluvr","Apr 30, 2003"

2.88,-10.3,3,2.5,3,2,3.5,"Heineken trying to make a decent brew, this dunkel is not that bad, but then again it's not that good. Pours a very dark ruby amber with a tan fizzy head high levels of artificial carbonation. This beer leaves practically no lace, definitely a macro we're dealing with here. The aroma is an off astringent metallic scent, and underneath of that there is sweet malt with nutty tones smells pretty good. Lighter in flavor than it looks, this is a the caramel malt is toned down, and there are some fruit tones in the background all tied together with a little bite of alcohol. Mouthfeel is thin, lacking a lot of body here. Overall though I would order when while out at a place with a shabby selection, depending on the price. I wouldn't drink that many of these because it's nothing special, but it does pull off an overall pretty enjoyable beer that could be consumed in quantity.","WVbeergeek","Mar 07, 2003"

This beer is certainly overpriced, but it is enjoyable.","Suds","Mar 01, 2003"

I can't say it was a horrible taste, but it was not like a dark beer. It only had very subtle roasty flavors, and you had to have a hunting dog to find the roasty aromas or flavors in this one.","ElGuapo","Jan 26, 2003"

Smell is rather ho-hum--somewhat weak and dominated by grain tastes with only a bit of roasted darkness. The darkness of this beer is also rather weak in its taste. Yeast flavors come through every bit as strongly. Turns a little crisper at the end, which is pleasant. Mouthfeel is a bit clingy but remains lighter than it might be. It's as drinkable as any mainstream brew, a category in which Heineken comfortably resides.","BitteBier","Jan 08, 2003"

The malt profile and body is lacking for a Dunkel, consisting of understated Munich malt and light chocolate.  Hop bitterness is low and lets residual malt sweetness to assert itself.
