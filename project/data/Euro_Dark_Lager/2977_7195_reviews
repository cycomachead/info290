"Pours clear light brown and looks beautiful. Thin, evanescent head. Not much going on in terms of smell; just bland nutty notes. The mouthfeel is light, almost watery, with a fair amount of carbonation. Tastes nutty, with some floral and fruity notes and some acidity. Not really bad, but not to be missed. A good refreshing brew to be enjoyed well chilled. Sessionable."

"o - Overall a pretty average beer. Not strong in any of the flavors, and not a ton going on, though not offensive or bad at all. Easy to drink, but better beers to find in France."
"Brasserie Pietra is a French brewery on the isle of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea. Corsica is known for its production of chestnuts, and the beer is brewed with chestnut flour. Not surprisingly, the clear amber-colored beer actually tastes of chestnuts. It's balanced, fluctuating between a sweet maltiness and a drying bitterness that may be in part due to the chestnuts themselves. The body is medium with a dextrinous edge and a median carbonation. At 6.0 % alcohol by volume it's strong, but not overly so, and the alcohol is well-cloaked. Probably best served well-chilled to begin with, it's a unique and interesting beer that's well worth trying."

"Clearish mahogany pour into a teku glass, a 1/4"" cap of sea foam on top that sank to a ringlet leaving dots of lacing behind. Caramel malts on the nose, wood and nutshells. Had a nutty taste somewhat reminiscent of a nut brown ale, but nothing really distinctively ""chestnut"" about it, caramel malt sweetness, mild leafy hops, and a bit of earth and cardboard. There was nothing amazing going on here, but I still quite enjoyed this one, and these days, for me to enjoy a lager is saying a lot. Light-medium body, smooth, clean, basic, easily drinkable. Not bad."

"O- I couldn't make it through the glass and the plastic band-aid flavor sticks in my mouth even after I'm finished. I couldn't really detect any other flavors hiding out in there."
""
"Overall: Interesting enough, glad I got the oppurtunity to try. Has a unique flavor profile, yet is approachable to the average consumer. Decent drinking brew."
"O- Nicely drinkable and decently refreshing. An easy, simple beer, but with a bit of a distinct character. Enjoyable"
"O: ... well, considering that's a French Beer, we can say that It's not that bad..."
"Overall, I think this a nice beer that would have been decent without the chestnuts, but their addition does bring a nice earthiness to the mixture that works quite well."
"Dr: She drinks easy, helped by the low ABV. The quality is good for an amber (I trust the brewer's definition of style over beeradvocate's). I'm glad they didn't overcaramelize the malt; that flavour wouldn't suit the beer. Give her a spin. The price is fair by French standards, though I got her in a supermarket."
"pours a dark golden yellow color, with a good amount of head that doesn't last long. mostly malt, maybe a bit of a floral aroma in the smell. taste was also very malty, better than your typical lager but still kind of average. decent carbonation and overall was an okay beer."
"Overall, while I have a hard time enjoying lagers much any more, this one really did much better by me than most. If you're staring at a menu full of coors and buds and this one happens to be on there, go for it."
"Overall - The beers taste seemed to improve as it got warmer, but I still wasn't really a big fan. There was just something about the taste that I really didn't enjoy."
"A beer brewed with chestnut flour. Pours a 2"" off-white head which lasts a reasonable time. Body is hazy amber almost apricot in hue. Taste and smell are both fairly standard lager, which surprised me considering the special addition ingredient. I would say it's richer than average with a medium weight body and I think that's where the chestnuts contributed. So just slightly better than BMC beers."
"Pours clear, light amber body with fleeting white head. The nose is chestnut, dried apple slices and grassy hops. In contrary to the aroma I can't get any chestnut flavor out of this. The taste is caramel malt and grassy hops with bitter finish. Light bodied. Nothing memorable."
"D : I would buy again of this beer. The chestnut makes it a very different beer of what we are used to."
"I'm not sure it's a dark lager, but there is something different with this beer. It boasts that it has the taste of chestnuts, but I'd have to be hard pressed to guess this solely from tasting it. Though it has some sort of interesting earthy flavour, and I kind of like it."
"I tried this beer on March 27, 2009 after pourchasing from one of my local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a translucent reddish gold with a 1"" thick white head which quickly dissipated. The aroma was sour grainy malt, and some floral notes. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was grainy malt, some toffee hints, and a bitter finish."
"This one skirts the Vienna lager genre but the color is not right, just the same it is a sturdy flavorful Munchen-style lager that can compete with any commercial Munich amber."
"Also, this beer is obviously in the wrong category."
"When poured into glass, the foam was almost white in color with a somwhat yellow haze and smooth. The color was a beautiful amber. The smell was woody, wheat and earthy with a small hint of flowers. Taste had a large overtone of earth (almost dirt), small hints of wheat and flowers and a small citrus undertone. The earthy tone was very overpowering. Mouthfeel - lightbodied. Drinkability - After tasting the earthy/dirt tones of the beer, it stops with an almost nasty taste. No wonder it was on sale. One of the worst sessions I've had."
"A hot summer day and a six-pack of Pietra would be a nice combo if you want to try something slightly different."
"Overall, a highly mediocre beer. I wouldn't seek it out, but it's also not totally unpleasant."
"Dark gold with a big head this is a pleasant nutty marzen. Very drinkable and well finished the beer shows the chestnut flavour as it warms up and opens up. A bigger mouthfeel and more complex flavour than expected from a corsican beer . Worth trying"
"D: This beer is pretty drinkable because it tastes good and is rather on the light side. Overall it's a pretty simple brew; tasty and refreshing but nothing spectacular. An interesting brew considering it has chestnut flour in it. Not bad at all."
"As for drinkability, it'd be fine to have a couple."
"D: The chestnut flour gives this beer a complexity that takes it a step above other beers of this type. Not bad overall, but not something I'd put on a must try list."
"Really solid atmosphere. Solid appearance, and a really pleasing, interesting, but not in an offensive way (more in an intriguing way) nose. Distinctive flavor, but not in a strange secret ingredient which overwhelms way and seemed like it may have been a good idea but in effect just distracts from the beer way, just in a unique flavor and solid balance way. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Bottle from the LCBO- Deep transparent amber with a fizzy and short lived white fizz. Nose is floral hops, bread crust, some spices, a bit woody. Tastes of spicy floral hops, caramel malts, some semi sweet fruit, vanilla and wood. Nice carbonation was lively throughout. Bitter and sharp finish. Pretty good stuff."
"Easily quaffable, a million times more flavor than those mass produced lager. A good lawnmower beer."
"This is an interesting beer. Its not very hoppy or sumptuosly malty, but it does have its own appeal. The weird musty flavor is not unpleasant and adds a unique character to the beer. Its not oxidization, but somewhat similar. Maybe it has something to do with the chestnut flour used."
"Not interesting, almost unpleasant. I think I'd pass."
"LCBO; pours pale yellow, fast disapearing white head. Neutral aroma. Drinkable, though not tasty still not offensive, some malts there. Passable European, but I did not finish it. Average mouthfeel. Not a dark lager at all. A tad sweet.Appropriate carbonation."
"D - Not good on the drinkability scale way to grainy in the taste I think the French should stick to wine don't bother with this beer"
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but not a fan of the grainy sweetness, making me hesitant to have another."
"Pours a dark orange, slight tinge of red and clear. Has a thin white head that dissappears quickly into a collar, faint laciness. Aroma is malt and skunk, skunk being the majority. Taste is also very skunky but I did pick up some malt and a little bitterness. Light and thin texture, has a carbonated feel to it. Not recommended as a session beer, flavor is poor."
"Very carbonated, overall a different, refreshing beer!"
"D - This is an interesting beer to be sure. It really defies classification. After one, I can't say that I really know if I like it or not. It has an interesting complexity that is puzzling but might get tiresome after a while."
"D-Unique and glad I tried it...not an all-time great but an enjoyable sweeter style amber ale...reminds me a little of Finnegans Irish Amber which is made with potatoes but this is better."
"Pours a clear amber orange, nice and bright, very thick white head forms, slightly soapy, slowly settles down to a thin layer and ring, no real lacing to speak of but looks alright. Smell is interesting, quite sweet, some caramel and corn syrup, light toasty malt, brown sugar, toast and flour, maybe a light nuttiness, some fruit, lemons, whole wheat bread, pretty clean, smells okay. Taste is similar, quite sweet at first, some caramel, lightly floral, very sweet in the middle, sugary, nuttiness and wheat flour is there but not as distinct as in the aroma, lightly spicy in the finish, touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, pretty drinkable. Not bad, the chestnut flour is pretty interesting, I kind of like this."
"Clear amber with a decent head of loose white foam. Spicy, with grassy hops, light orange and apricot fruitiness in the nose. Light, but well balanced flavours - light malt, slightly mineral body is interesting, and a mildly bitter finish. Fairly clean flavour and a bit of astringency. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. Can't say I detect any chestnut tones."
"BB end 2010. Enjoyed from an Affligem goblet - since I had one on the go at the time. Amber with surprizing one finger off-white head, low carbonation. Some lacing stuck around, as did a a cloudy, wispy centre. Feint smell of mushrooms, not too much happening on the nose. This beer had a rather unique taste that featured a floral hoppiness, bitter middle and malt finish, all of it punctuated by sweetness that was fleeting; bubblegum kept coming to mind. Overall, a tasty brew although chestnuts didn't particularly stand out."
"It's too bad some beers don't turn out as interesting as they sound. The sweetness of the nut is far more noticeable than its flavour. That one lovely, distinct element aside the beer possesses no more texture or character than any other amber beer, mainstream or otherwise. It's curious how Mediterranean beers all seem to pair so poorly with food."
"Little too much carbonisation, hence the burps, otherwise a pleasant drink."
"Bottle: Poured an amber color beer with a medium size foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Taste of light caramel malt with light sweetness. Taste is somewhat bland with some light caramel malt with some light sweet note also noticeable. Body is about average with some good carbonation. Chestnuts are impossible to detect and again not sure what they would have provided."
"I would not say it is bad, better than average supermarket beers. Maybe I will drink it again, it is strange, but drinkable."
"Very intrigued by this beer when I came upon the bottle: ""Chestnuts in beer? Hmmm...that could be good."" Well, the beer pours an appealing color: burnt ambers, copper, and bronze, all of differing tones, capped with a simple (and shallow) white head. It's a decent looking beer. The aroma carries a little malt and sugar, but little else. The taste, is restrained, but there is a notable nut character. I expected the chestnut to stand out more (I was thinking of the sweet meat inside a roasted chestnut, but got chestnut flour). There's a touch of bitterness and rustic qualities that I assume come from the nuts, along with a bit of chestnut flavor that carries on throughout the beer. Medium body, but a nice flavor. The finish is bitter and firm. It could be a little more intense, certainly, but I applaud the effort and enjoyed having something interesting."
"It really tastes like a typical ""beer", almost like a traditional cerveza in fact, but with a little extra sweetness. There's a bready aftertaste, with a little bitterness - none of which I feel particularly good about."
"Drinkability : bonne bière de la brasserie Pietra (Corse)"
"From my notes 6/12/07 pours a two-finger white head that quickly goes to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Medicinal nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is malty almost sweet, hints of alcohol, finish is clean and slightly drying. S.Fr. 3.60 ($2.93) for a 330ml bottle from Drinks of the World Lucerne, Switzerland."
"Taste is rough, with something that now, yes, reminds me vaguely of chesnuts, some bittersweet notes and fruits in the bottom. Dry finish. Again, after a while, everything is almost gone, leaving only some sulphur notes."
"I expected something unique, exotic even, when I learned about the use of chestnut flour in Pietra Biera Corsa. The sad truth is, it's just another lackluster Euro beer (that's an ale rather than a lager) that stands out from the crowd because it has a different off-flavor than most. Don't bother."
"Notes: Not a mix I took a liking to. The peppered addition gave this a life but in the end it felt kinda cheap and extract laden. For the price its a definite pass."
"Pours reddish gold with a thin, quickly dissipating head. Smells of sour cherries. Tastes of caramel but without the sugar if you can say that of something that is burnt sugar. Also has a sight hop note to it that lingers into a slightly bitter aftertaste. No real complexity. Mouthfeel is watery with just a note of silkiness on the back of the tongue. Drinkability is good, as you could down several of these without noticing, really. Probably evidence why the French are known for their wine."
"M&D: quite refreshing on the mouthfeel, and the initial clashing feel disappears quickly after the second sip (guess it's because my tongue has got used to it?!). The impression of a lager with a chestnutty character is not that bad after all, yet the overall performance for me is below average, for the body falls thin and the more pleasant flavour comes in at too late a stage. Still I don't regret that I've tried it. By the way, I suspect it goes well with roast chicken (just popping up in my mind)??..."
"Overall - A pretty poor beer....Not really worth a try..."
"330 ml bottle, labeled Pietra Bière Ambrée, bought in France. My first Corsican beer. Amber colour, large head. Nutty aroma with toffee and undefined herbal notes. Flavour is moderately malty with not-too-good hops, the chestnuts shine through. Chestnut powder in beer, WTF? Some strange medicinal character and a bitter finish and aftertaste. Not my favourite this one."
"In the aftertaste chestnut flour again, floury malt, quite standing."
"Overall: A tad bland I guess if I am honest, but really not that bad at all considering its strength. No additives are used, and this is a rather unique beer that is worth picking up off the shelves at least once, if not just for the experience of getting to try a real Chestnut Beer. Oh, and drink this closer to cellar temperature to get the best from it would be my advise, even so, this is no shining star but more like a dull planet."
"This beer is so annoying. A great commercial success, playing around with the local corsican identity, but quite a shame for the brewer. It's easy to write stuff on the label in corsican to make Corsicans proud and to look exotic for all the others; but it'd be more interesting to focus the efforts on the brewing process. I hope I won't have to drink that ever again."
"Golden color, OK head with decent lastability. Typically bottom-fermented aroma - neither very subtle nor especially inviting. The taste is balanced between malt and hops, but rather than seeming well-balanced, the beer comes across as simply not very interesting. Decent dry finish, though. I didn't detect any chestnut flavors. Soft mouthfeel and OK drinkability."
"i wouldnt refuse one of these if offered, but there are several brown ales ive tasted that are ahead of it in my queue. if pietra slashed a percent off the ABV would be a much better beer."
"Just noticed the notch on the 11.2 ounce bottle says it was bottled in December 2001. Still should not be skunked since it came in a closed cardboard package with three bottles. The beer is supposedly a chestnut beer, perhaps that has to do with the aroma when first opened. The beer has held it's own pretty well to be only 6% ABV, not highly hopped and good drinkability at 2 years of age. Sadly, it was purchased in a Raleigh store today."
