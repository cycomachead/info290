3.88,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottling date. Pours hazy very dark brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense tan head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, mint leaves, licorice, vanilla, molasses, roasted malt, biscuit, dark fruit, and a bit of bourbon. Nice and very interesting aromas as I would have expected. Taste of big chocolate, roasted malt, light coffee, licorice, bourbon, vanilla, biscuit, mint leaves, dark fruit, and some herbal spiciness. Some light licorice tartness on the finish; with some lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, mint, and licorice on the finish for a bit. Finish is fairly dry. Very nice overall balance of flavors, with no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink at 8%. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming on the finish. Overall this is a surprisingly nice and interesting black lager; that is very drinkable and balanced.","superspak","Feb 14, 2012"

2.98,-23,4.5,4,2.5,3.5,2,"This beer doesn't work for me. My big caveat, though, is that I don't like licorice, and I don't like the way it combines with beer. Adding sharpness and bitterness on top of something that's already bitter and sharp doesn't help. Adding black licorice to a rich, sweet stout might work, but here it just accentuates the qualities I don't like: the acrid and thin bitter flavors.","zeledonia","Sep 06, 2011"

4.03,4.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"I had assumed the flavor would be overwhelmingly of black licorice, but happily it's nicely integrated into the 'dark lager' experience. Dark, gummy fruit notes make an appearance, too, suggesting fig and sweet prunes. Slightly hoppy, herbal finish with a kiss of mint sharpness. Mouthfeel is medium-thin in consistency with a creamy carbonation and smooth body. Another absurd, yet well-crafted beer from Short's. Is there any flavor they can't capture in a pint?","wagenvolks","Aug 05, 2011"

3.95,2.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a snifter, this is a nice dark brown lager. A couple fingers worth of a tan head. The smell is very strong on the mint, but i also get hints of the vanilla and anise - maybe even some chocolate. It is a really interesting smelling beer. The taste is a little heavier on the anise and vanilla. Then it finishes with a nice mint and chocolate. It is a little thinner than I'd like, but it isn't a style I drink very often. Overall it is a very interesting brew from shorts. I'd drink it again if it was offered, maybe even pick another up if I see one at one of the shops I go to. As someone who isn't too fond of licorice flavor, I was surprised with how subdued Shorts made the anise flavor. It is just in the background with the vanilla, adding complexities and making this a really good beer.","J0E","Jul 16, 2011"
3.53,-8.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: This beer pours a dark brown with very little transparency and small beige head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the edges of the glass. The aroma consists of moderate doses of licorice with light coffee, vanilla, and hints of mint. The flavor starts with a quick dose of black licorice and is slightly bitter and dry. The finish has moderate dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and a touch of vanilla. It leaves behind a minty chocolate aftertaste. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation.","Giggy","Jul 15, 2011"

Active carbonation, but the bubbles are very small. Wow! Aroma is very powerful. Anise, chocolate and mint are prominent . I’m having trouble detecting the vanilla initially. There is a mint chocolate chip ice cream (which happens to be my favorite) thing going on with the aroma. Taste is sweet with a nice mix of anise and chocolate mint again. There is some bitterness, but its mostly roasty rather than hoppy. Medium bodied with a slick texture. Finish is smooth and seems like it cleanses the palate as anise and chocolate mint tend to do. This is a pretty unique beer and one that I enjoyed. If you don’t like anise or chocolate mint, then you will have a tough time with this.","trappistlover","Jul 01, 2011"

The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, and licorice. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew.

Only shorts can take a food I don't like and model a beer after it that I do like, thats some serious skill. This beer isn't that drinkable, I think one is enough for the night, I don't think I would buy a six pack of it but I would pick up a single when in the mood.

Very nice aroma that's heavy on chocolate and vanilla, and lighter on anise and mint. The beer is aged on chocolate mint leaves, anise, and vanilla beans, and I'm surprised how much chocolate comes through from the chocolate mint leaves. The anise is almost lost on the nose, but the overall effect is very pleasant, with a light snap of mint right at the end. The taste is heavier with dark licorice notes, bitter chocolate, roastiness, and a bitter earthiness. There are some vanilla notes throughout and some mintiness on the end again.

3.31,-14.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability & Final Thoughts: This beer isn't hard to drink and it's not a terrible beer, but some things about it were a little off-putting to me. When I see such a dark pour with light carbonation and a small, tan head, and smell dark chocolate and burnt coffee, I except a rather full, chewy mouthfeel and lots of bready, roasted malt character. However, this beer's body is medium at strongest and there isn't nearly the strength of roasted malt flavor one might expect. I also think the cooling spice flavors would work better if they were held up against a thicker body and breadier flavors; as it stands, they come like an afterthought in an otherwise fairly straightforward and not particularly exemplary Euro-style dark lager. Short's doesn't entirely miss the mark but they've brewed much better.","Gorgoroth","Jan 17, 2011"

Not particularly smokey just an accent to the digestive aid quality of the beer. Licorice blends fantastically. Not chocolatly malt but on the fruit plum side. Great beer...great brewery.

Short's, in my opinion, has done better with other beers. This is decent, but honestly, when they give a description of how the beer ""should"" taste (i.e. licorice) one normally cannot deny that the beer indeed does taste exactly like it (i.e. Imperial Spruce India Pilsner...holy pine trees).

4.15,7.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I treated my snifter to Short's Black Licorice Lager, which had a dark, rich brown color with a copper red outline along the curves of the glass. The head produced was minimal, with a heavy straw tinting to it and the lacing climbed, descended and clung beautifully as I swirled the beer. The smell came across strongly of roasted malts, perhaps roasted chocolate malt, with nice toasty whiffs and pleasant bits of sweetness. It was akin to a slightly overdone cookie. Upon the first sip, I was struck again by roasted malts, this time coming across like a nice toasty biscuit. As I swallowed I was hit with a pop of the star anise, producing a drop of black licorice on the tongue. There are very subdued, slight suggestions of vanilla and a refreshing aftertaste that could be construed as mint if one were so inclined. For all of the flavor elements involved, it is still a remarkably smooth beer. The lager wins out in the end in what is a crisp, clean and well made affair. The body is full and the beer finishes slightly dry.","GregoryVII","Jun 09, 2010"
4.12,6.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall this is a perfect showcasing of what Short's can do with good quality ingredients outside of barley, yeast & hops. This whacky combination of ingredients really makes for a stunningly flavorful and pallet training experience. I'd love to pair this with some lamb vindaloo and some Nan bread with mango chutney. This beer is begging for a daring food pairing for sure. Although, it's doing quite fine on its own on this perfect 70F late-spring night.","malty","Jun 07, 2010"

Unfortunately, the flavor combination really does not work that well for me. Still not a bad brew though. As it warms the flavors start to smooth out a little better. Throughout, I had the nagging sensation that I was drinking sour milk but it never came through strong enough to really hamper beer overall.

Dark chocolate, hints of fruity Kenyan coffee, tobacco, leather, and some very ripe plums. Slightly tangy/spicy edge throughout (maybe fennel). Earthy anise and licorice root also stays throughout, but it's not overbearing (reminds me of root beer more than black licorice). It's actually pretty tasty as it lingers in the long finish.

Aroma is strong of anise, like a box of good and plenty's, also some nice cola like vanilla aroma that blends with a soft mintiness. A great aroma, very soft and yet very complex. Taste is soft vanilla and cola up front that quickly blends with some anise which dwells on the palette into the somewhat astringent and slightly roasted aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium, definitely some malts here to get that alcohol up there, but still crisp and clean, soft carbonation on the tongue mid taste and an astringent, slightly bitter and nicely dry finish. I can't get enough of this beer, for its alcohol content, it is very well balanced, the anise and vanilla melded very well together and the lagering allows these flavors to come thru better without fighting other yeast flavors. Outstanding aroma and very tastey, no problem with the full 750ml. If you like black licorice, seek this out!","hoppymeal","Jun 05, 2007"
