"Overall, not something I would ever get again. I can understand the market I guess, but definitely not my cup of tea ( or beer for that matter). Also I'm not understanding the cold brewed methodology they are boasting? I would pair this with a nice Reuben  sando or corned beef and cabbage ( I mean that's the only time I would ever consider a Guinness beer). it gets a 61/100."

"Extremely smooth. Great beer and no bad after taste. First time Guinness drinker here. Can't wait to try more Guinness."

"I am not sure why people don't care for this beer, but I love the taste and the smooth coffee smell and flavor. While I recognize that there are better black lagers, I maintain this is an oldie but goodie."

"A good unique beer, but doesn't rock my house"

"As I stated earlier we very much miss the Guinness Black Lager, with the holidays near, we are looking for a different brand to replace the Guinness Black Lager. Here in Fort Collins, Colorado I've put the word out to many of our Craft Breweries are looking for a smooth Black Euro-Lager."

"This beer is not a bad beer, just very bland. The appearance is dark black with an off white head. The smell is very subtle with some sweetness coming through. The taste was a bit flat. There was a bit of bitterness in the beginning but the rest was rather neutral. Also not a fan of the mouthfeel which was too thin and not enough carbonation."

"Overall (2.97) : Dump. A poorly executed dark beer. I didn't think I'd be giving this 5's, but I didn't expect it to be quite this bad either. The roast flavor is okay, but it stays too long and becomes pasty on the palate after the swallow. A good example of how to NOT brew a black lager."

"Excellent beer - Full bodied and sessionable. Everything you could ask for in a beer. -0.05/5 because some other Schwarzbiers are better, in my opinion, though this is a go-to beer for me."

"I would say that this beer is not terribly sweet but has a luscious mouthfeel that accents the subtle flavors that it does have. Has a brief bite from carbonation and drinks very well.  After taste is brown bread."

"This beer pours with a lot of promise - nice foamy head, good colour, decent nose. Overall, there is nothing wrong with this beer. It is underwhelming, more than anything else. The roasted malts are very faint and there is little depth or complexity in the flavour. There are far better Euro Dark Lagers than this, but I would not turn it down if there was nothing else to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As the name suggests, it's a bit of a darker spin on Guinness stout. Pour yields a gentle head. The aroma is intoxicating. The roasted barley absolutely dances off the beer. Like the stout, it seems much darker and heavier than it actually is. The malt is balanced very nicely. So full of flavor, without feeling too overpowering."

"Guinness and Lager do not mix. I love Guinness Regular (in the pub) and Guinness Extra Stout and my favorite is Foreign Extra but this Guinness is terrible. It tasted slightly like Guinness but it just didn't hit the spot of the way other Guinness tastes. Lager is lager and Guinness is Guinness. Just keep it that way."

"O: I wanted to like this but it really just seemed like a sweeter, black, macro lager to me. I could easily see this appealing to you're average BMC drinker if they were told to drink it straight from the bottle and didn't know it was black. Poor example of style and just a lame lack luster beer in general."

"Bottle: Poured a clear dark color lager with a small off-white foamy head with OK retention. Aroma of lightly toasted malt is mildly pleasant. Taste is also dominated by lightly toasted malt with light dry bitter notes and watery finish. Body is light with OK carbonation. This is a water-down version of Guinness which says a lot about this beer."

"This lager pours a deep brownish mahogany with a dish soap like off white head and minimal lacing. The nose is an unappealing blend of malt sweetness and an almost chemical aroma. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy as one would expect from a guiness product. The flavor is a lack luster blend of roasted malts and...well, not much else. This one isn't bad but it is nit something I'll be returning to again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Imagine a very attractive women with little personality. This beer looks great but the overall experience is unsatisfying. Don't get me wrong; this is not a bad tasting beer. The taste, initially, is pleasant. Almost immediately, however, the flavor disappears. This beer is chugable but, aside from the buzz, what's the point. This beer is less than the some of its parts (hence, the 3.50 overall rating). P.S. Your American adjunct lager drinking buddies might like it."

"The only plus is the great looking bottle. and maybe less calories. A strong Guinness character SHOULD NOT try to cover/dumb down their signature taste, Guinness and lager do not mix."

"Final Grade: 3.19, a C+. Guinness Black Lager is no schwarzbier - it's dull and forgettable compared to the German examples I've tried, although technically this is a 'Euro Dark Lager' so I suppose that comparison is of questionable fairness. That being said, there's nothing really wrong with this beer - I'd drink it again and maybe pay for a pint at the bar if I were in the mood, though I doubt I'd buy it in-store at its standard price point. A decent rendition of an inherently mediocre beer style."
""
""
""
"Taste is the real weakness here - it's very light, thin in feel and character, with thin, light toasty taste and not much else except a hint of mineral. It is very bland, one-dimensional, finishes abruptly like mineral water with a little ground0up burnt toast in it."

"Guinness Black Lager Poured from a can into a glass. Dark also Black. Over all I really Like this brew. Not something I would get on a everyday bases. But drinkable. It is Heavy Compared to American style Lagers. I got the smell of a dark rich beer. Over all I gave this brew a 3.75. Not a big fan of Guinness Brews but this one is good."

"This is pretty unremarkable. It really does have the taste and feel of a watered down cola. The malt is there, barely; something roasted is about all you'll get out of it. It's enjoyable, but mainly in the drinkability factor. I wouldn't recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel, Like Guinness draught and Blue-moon it is very smooth leaving a refreshing, satisfying feel as it goes down. Almost perfect in my opinion."
"Overall: Not a bad brew. I would have this again if it was offered to me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not sure what Guinness is trying to do with this beer. With the roasted barley, it starts out with the possibility of being a good light bodied ale. It however misses the mark starting with its light aroma. The beer starts with toasted malt promise, but ends up being with a flat commercialized beer concoction."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not half bad, but I'm pretty sure the only difference between this and Guinness Draught is the yeast they use. I would have preferred a Guinness Draught over this because of the silky-smooth mouthfeel. Would not recommend, would not buy."
""
"This beer came out a while back and I recall getting a six-pack and destroying this in short order while doing yard work. It served its purpose admirably at this time. Now for the formal review treatment. Does look the part, brownish black with the odd red twinkle, certainly carbonated like a Euro lager, bubbly and can muster a decent off-white to vaguely tan colored head. Smells quite sweet and fruity, some fresh dough along with the requisite dark malt aroma that in this case recalls stale dark chocolate ... There is some pleasant roasted barley character on the nose though, which is of course linked in one's brain to the prototypical Irish dry stout whose fan base this brew is intended to lure over to the lager dark side. Palate is indeed a hybrid of Guinness style roasted flavors and lager traits, including aggressive carbonation and some lager yeast character. Quite dry, tastes roasted but with a little barley sugar sweetness and a fruitiness like red grapes lurks in the background ... I get a licorice toffee effect somewhere at the interface of grainy dough, chalky chocolate, and the aforementioned sweetness. There's the odd boozy note that emerges as well, the alcohol peaking out from behind the roasted flavors, and some grain husk and ash in the dry finish. A few off-flavors, metal and cardboard, but not terrible in this regard. I had the same problem with this beer than I have with its more famous brother ... You keep trying to taste more but at the end of the day its a simple no frills brew. Could be better, could be worse."

"Overall - Seemed a bit better then the last time I had it, which may be due to pouring it into a glass. Overall decent enough for a black lager, but would normally prefer something else. While it may not be as accessible, if you're looking for something in the same vein try Schwarzbier as the roasty characteristics come out even more and flavor and aromas are much fuller. They also don't necessarily cost much more than this either."

"Overall I thought this was decent beer and a nice example of the style, the balance was pretty good with all of the aspects showing up just enough and there's no off flavors to be found. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, not filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I'm sure I could drink more than a few of these if I was in the mood for it. I like the taste the most and the very thin body the least. I might buy this again and I would order it at a bar if nothing better was available. I would recommend this to anyone who wants the lightest possible dark beer, if regular Guinness is too thick for you then this might make a good alternative. All in all this isn't a bad beer and it's about the same as a remember, not a bad choice when there's not a good selection at hand."
""
"O: I'm glad there were only two in the eight pack. It isn't bad but I won't be looking for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This could have been better, but taking into account that it's a lager and not meant to be a meal in a bottle, this could also be much worse. It's a good beer to bring to parties, that's for sure, and I may go get myself some more when the weather starts to warm up again. There's nothing particularly special in this so I ask you to use your discretion, but I enjoyed it. To good health and good beer."
""
""
""

"Guinness Black Lager, however, is a half-decent example of a Dark Lager. Its dulled, forgettable features, mind you, are unmistakably those of a very hackneyed, commercialized offering. As such, it's best suited as an introduction to those accustomed to mainstream lagers; drinkers already familiar with German Schwarzbiers and quality craft renditions need not bother with it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, nice head developed, semi-dense and tan in color, good lacing and retention. Aroma was a milt malt and coffee with the appearance being, as expected, black. Had a dry taste with some coffee notes. Mouthfeel was lighter than expected, almost watery. Dry aftertaste. Seemed like Guinness Stout light to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: All in all a good experience, but world shattering it isn't. It's certainly something different from the brewery well known for it's stout, and I suppose this is a decent enough test of them to bring stout aspects to a Lager. Worth a go."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - Meh, this is about as ""average"" a brew can get. It's not horrible but not good either. Would particularly recommend."

"O- Guinness Black Lager is a worthy effort from a legendary brewery. Although I didn't find it extremely great, I would recommend it nonetheless. If Guinness bumped up the carbonation and hopping, I believe this would be an excellent brew."
""
""
""
"This is a very worthy effort from Guinness. Although not a traditional lager, this is something completely original in the lager category. The beer is not as dark as one may think, it is a dark amber color and pours a nice amount of head and lace. The beer has an earthy aroma and taste, leaving a nice hint of earthy malts on the palette. Overall this beer is great and easy to find, making it a great choice when the selection is limited at your local supermarket."

"I'm surprised that Guinness Black Lager is rated as poorly as it is on the site. I thoroughly enjoy this beer, and if I'm ever out somewhere that has it, I almost always get it rather than whatever I was going to order before I saw it on the menu. This beer not only looks cool with it's dark appearance, but is surprisingly smooth considering how dark it is. It still packs a good lager flavor, though. Of course it's not traditional Guinness, but it's just as enjoyable to me."

"poured from a 341ml bottle into a pilsner glass of all things. The beer pours black. what a shocker. The smell is faint, but there are some nice malty and roasty aromas - it's nothing fantastic but it's okay. This is a beer that is less than meets the eye for sure - it looks like it'd be similar to guinness in taste, but it's a lot more milder. It's slightly sweet and slightly malty with a very clean finish and no unpleasant aftertaste. It reminds me of waterloo dark lager in that it is opaque as anything but doesn't deliver a huge hit of taste. That's not really bad though - this is still a fine beer and i'd gladly drink it again, but wouldn't buy a six pack - there is better stuff available."

"I actually liked this one. It has that Guinness quality to it without being as in your face. This is more a version to drink on a hot day, it goes down pretty easily and smoothly, yet still true to its heritage."

"This is what I call a m'eh beer. It's okay, but nothing special. Not quite as good as Guinness stout, but a decent offering by Guinness brewery. Appearance is dark chocolate black, with a three finger head that quickly dissipates to nothing. Smells of stale coffee, plums, raisins, and malts. Taste has a bit of dark chocolate, with heavy plums and raisins. Oddly, the aftertaste is stronger than when the beer is actually in your mouth. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Overall, a m'eh beer. I'd pick it up if it were cheap or free at a party, but the stout is a better beer."
""
"basic black lager where there's nothing wrong but nothing standing out either, I wouldn't say no if passed to me but I doubt I'd spend my hard earned money on this one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Several bottle samples at the LCBO on WIlson as I explained what the term and style was to the friendly rep they sent out. Its black without much head, or unfortunately much taste either. It's not up to the style. Better than the stout they serve here.A bit thin and overcarbonated."
""
""

"I was in my local beer buying place today looking for something new and grabbed a 6-pack of the Guinness Black Lager since I like black beers and lagers. I knew it would now be as strong or have the body and flavor of a traditional Guinness Stout. But that was what I was looking for. Since the 6-pack was already chilled I had one when I got home and found it to be very refreshing and drinkable by its self on a hot summer day. This is a great dark beer with a low ABV that allows you to have several at one sitting."

"I tried this beer on a recommendation from a friend, so I went and got a 6-pack. I must say that coming from Guinness I was expecting more. As far as taste, this one fell flat for me. Although it does have a pretty smooth texture, it just has a bland, forgettable flavor."

"Overall not a bad beer, worthy of a try, but not one i will seek in the future."
""
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this beer was its lightness. Unfortunately there is very little smoke, roast, or general complexity, but no other components came out as intensely offensive at really any point in the tasting. Things just remained monotone throughout, with the aroma striking overly basic notes, with the flavor following suit. The feel lent little towards redemption in thickness, froth, or coating. Happy St. Patrick’s Day (!!), but we’re reaching for something else next."

"Not enough going on here to warrant another attempt. Not sure what the point of this beer is really."
"Easy to drink, but fairly boring. If you want something like this but better, stick to authentic Schwarzbiers. Could be a good beer for non-beer geeks to drink that is dark, but not ""heavy and bitter"" (ha ha!) like real Guinness."

"This Euro Dark Lager must be a relatively new designation as there are no guidelines listed as yet, but I am already a fan. My pour created two dense fingers of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark brown with garnet highlights and good clarity despite its low light penetration. Nose had the characteristic lager honey-like sweetness, but in this case, married with a light roastiness. Chocolate malt, perhaps? I wonder about what, exactly, constitutes ""roasted barley"" for them. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, even for a lager, but the taste was a pleasant mix of chocolate and smokiness along with a mild sweetness. I do not like Cascadian/Dark/Black IPAs because I feel as though such flavors get in the way of my beloved hops, but in this case, they meld nicely. Finish was semi-dry and the mild smokiness seemed to linger well past the swallow. As usual, I would not want a steady diet of this as a self-avowed hophead, but it beats a lot of other lagers. Not bad."
"Overall: Pretty mediocre beer, really started turning into a corn bomb as I went through the glass. Stick to their stouts."
""
""
"I hate the commercials for this beer. ""How can something be both refreshing and flavorful?"" I hope someone gets fired for that. I bought a bottle of this because of how much the advertising sucks. The beer itself isn't bad, but it's not memorable in any way. More bland than anything."
"O- I will not be getting this one again, I managed to get a 6 pack for 3.50. But even regret that. This was very lacking and did not have any of the Guinness flavors I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-what can I say about this? It's okay. It's sessionable beyond belief, you could drink this all day with out much effort. Very light and fluffy tones in this brew. Really the only thing going for this beer is its drink ability. 3"
""
""
""
""
"I wasn't really sure what Guinness wanted to accomplish with this new offering, but since it strikes a perfect balance between the bone dry Draught and the chewy Extra Stout my guess is that is exactly what they were looking for; a beer to reach for when you want a Guinness but are put off by extremes. This is actually growing on me, a good session beer with a bit more character, as well as a great companion to a meat heavy pizza or tomato and red pepper soup. Cheers!"
""
"11.2oz bottle, pours a cola-like black with a bubbly, tan colored head that dissipates quickly leaving some bubbly lacing at the top of the glass. Aromas and flavors are similar with roasted barley, chocolate, lager yeast, a little bit of cola in the flavor also. Thinner bodied, finishes clean while the roasted barley lingers a bit. Overall, great drinkability, but pretty one note as far as flavors go."

"Poured into a 12 oz. Sam Adams Glass. Pours a nice deep black, as advertized, with a short lived coffee colored head that leaves no lacing. Aroma was minimal, with little hints of the roasted malt but not much depth beyond that. It's taste isn't bad, but it's not quite as robust as a German schwarzbier. It didn't really have the chocolate or coffee profile one would expect, but just a pared down ""roast"" flavor. Like a schwarzbier, turned down to 5 or 6. It has a good lager mouthfeel. It could be pretty good, I just wish that the roast flavor matched it's dark color."
""

"As a huge fan of Euro dark lagers and schwarzbiers (is there actually a difference?), I had to try the Guinness version. I found this one very smooth and drinkable as they should be. Not the sweetest or most bitter but the balance was about perfect. Sure, I would rather have a draft Kostritzer but since I live in the US, this is not always possible. Right out of the bottle this is a great dark lager which would pair well with any food. If I had more income I would keep this beer in stock but unfortunately in the present economy I cannot afford it. The McSorley's Black Irish Lager brewed by Pabst is much more affordable and IMHO has more flavor."
""
"The taste is well balanced. The after taste is quite nice too, with a little more bite than I would expect. Overall this is a nice easy brew and vastly underrated."

""

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, char, and a sour, metallic aroma. Taste is much the same with a dark bread and metallic flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that tastes slightly better than it smells, but that isn't saying much."

"Overall I thought it was an OK beer - there are definitely other Black Lagers I would choose first but this is easy to drink and not un-enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Overall: Tought to gauge this beer's heart--is it a genuine attempt to expand a good brand, or propaganda riding the word black at the expense of Arthur's good name? At least the brewery made a modest move by staying dark with its first lager... this beer's strenght will be in its weight; however, its lack of roast will be its limitation...."

"O: Not offensive, but not memorable. My first go of a Euro Dark Lager that I'm aware of."

"Drinkable for sure, prolly not my cup of brew though."
"O: Not horrible. Wouldn't seek it out or probably even buy again, but I'd gladly drink one if offered to me freely. This has its place being the weak link in the Guinness winter selection pack."

"This was my very first black lager and it has been a great introduction into the field! I look forward to trying more since trying this beer very pleased! this was a good change from the usual college beers (hence I'm a college student). I will continue to purchase this beer it has a warm malty taste to it that is welcoming! Ha I tend to crave this taste throughout the day nothing like any other college beer (bud light, miller lite, nat. Lite, etc...). Furthermore, this beer has kept my interest high into beer since I use to think it just tasted like breaded water; this proved that notion wrong by dispelling it to the types of beers I had drank before it. I know I'm a novice but I look forward to working my way through my beers to sharpen my buds! I hope this review helps someone!"

"Another one that comes from my parent's fridge. I'm sure it'll be better than most of the swill I get to review from there. Guinness Black Lager pours a muddy brown color with a full head that quickly recedes. The aroma is actually very nice, it does a good job at capturing the roasty essence of Guinness with a nice lager twist. The taste does away with most of the roast flavor, instead presenting a solid Euro Pale Lager-esque import taste with just a bit of the roastiness coming in on the finish. The mouthfeel is thin and light, but the drinkability is rather good. Overall, it's a slightly better than average twist on the Euro Pale Lager. Perfectly drinkable, I wouldn't mind having some of these when it's warmer out."
"O: The beer is easy to drink but really lacks complexity and depth to the flavors and aromas to make it a more desirable beer in my opinion - also, I thick it could benefit from a little fuller body."
"O - Not bad. A pleasant twist on the regular. Wouldn't let it sit around long, though, I imagine it might get too bitter."

"Poured from a bottle into a goblet."
"this black lager from guinness is pretty good. the color is black with a light tan head. the smell is nothing remarkable. theres a little hint of smoke and some nuttiness, but nothing really grabs you. i do like the taste its less potent than guinness draught. which makes it really drinkable. its like you get all the fashion of walking around with a black beer in your hand with out anyone knowing that its tame. guinness is a lot heavier than this you could drink several of these in one sitting. i dont know if this beer will catch on- i dont see die hard guinness drinkers likeing it- and i dont see bud drinkers picking it up but i think is pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Honestly, this tastes like a BMC style dark lager. Only the hops in the finish save this from being complete crap. The malt taste is way to dextrin-like, and the flavors in general are extremely bland. I know Guinness can do better than this. Bleh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall Drinkability: Not a bad brew. Still not nearly as good as Good Ole' Guinness Stout."
""
""
""
"Great job Guinness - keep it up."
""
""
""

"Pretty lame and boring brew. Unfortunate that Guinness doesnt seem to care to put out more of an interesting product. Oh well, glad I only poached one of these from a friends assortment box"

"The beer exits the 330 mL bottle black with some brownish hues toward the edges and a modest amount of foam. The aroma is dark malt with hints of cocoa powder and charcoal. Husky grain is the first things that hits the palate followed by sweet dark malt. Malt dominates the experience and there isn't much of hop presence. The beer is drinkable, nothing wrong here, but I would have liked to see some more complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty terrible beer. Tastes nothing like traditional Guinness and is kind of a watered down mess. If you want to drink Guinness just get the regular stuff."
""
""
""
""
"I had high hopes for this beer but was really disappointed. It almost seems to have a metallic taste to it, like a cheap canned beer. It had a flat mouth feel for such a dark beer, it didn't seem well balanced. Not as heavy as the Guinness I'm accustomed to. I won't buy it again."
""
""
"O: Not bad but there are better lagers for cheaper. Would drink it again but not buy it myself."

"Big yuck! Something is terribly wrong here. It barely tastes like beer at all but more like evil cola. Sweet but insipid and nasty and over carbonated. I am not sure I can finish this or why I should. This is a mistake all around."
""
""
"This beer upsets me. I love guinness. Every thing they were. And still should be. What they stood for. With this they have lost alot of my respect. They have sold out to the mass market. Guinness is not supposed to be for everyone. I'm sad. I'm sick. This is like metallica singing turn the page. CHEAP. i understand what they are trying to do. Be relevant. Current. What they don't understand is that the timeless rock of a beer they have been brewing for 250 years would keep them current on its own. Bc it demands respect. Its a fucking institution. Its not my favorite beer. I prefer more aggressive american stouts but its one of the worlds best liquids. Black lager is no better than yeungling black and tan or 1554. Like bud with black die in it. POSER!!! the slogan for this beer is. "" if you are a pussy and are lying about it. Drink black lager"""
""
"Not something i will ever buy again myself."
""
"The beer poured out very smoothly and ended with a pillowy tan head, and it stuck around for good while. The beer was true to its name - it was black to my eyes and actually looked good in the glass for being so dark. The carbonation was high leading to an average mouthfeel. The smell of roasted barley was strong, not overpowering, but it did take the place of the normal hoppy taste in most beers. It was a good difference for a change. Overall, I have it a rating just above average due to its amazing black color."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a descent black lager. Nothing too special here, but as would be expected - it's highly drinkable and easy to approach."
"The body was very good, clean and crisp with a dry finish. Drinkability was very good, you could easily drink several of these low ABV brews with wiping out your taste buds. Overall, a very nice little brew that easy on your palate and on your wallet. Worth trying for most people, and a must try if you like the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was kinda disappointed with this beer, when I saw that Guinness had Guinness Black Lager I had to try it. I guess Guinness's regular stout is kind of the measuring stick for anyone trying to make a stout and was kind of hoping that that would ring true for this as well. Guess not."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium as well. What to think about this beer is the question. Well it is not great nor is it bad. Guinness original is much better offering. I find this one a tad watery for my liking. Good beer and easy to drink."
""
""
"Ho hum."
""
"O: Would never buy this again. I was drinking this with a spicy curry and it made my food taste bad. I could not believe how burned the beer tasted."
""
""
"Overall: A nice beer to try if you are just getting into darker beers. However, it lacks complexity. Refreshing roastedness and clean finish."
"To thick body and moderate carbonation. Not that much different from the Irish stout."
"Overall - Drinkable but nothing groundbreaking by any means. It has a decent amount of bitterness at the end, but it's pretty basic tasting other than that. I wouldn't buy it again, but I wouldn't turn one away if offered."
""
""
""
""
""
"- O: The velvety dry aspect is nice, makes me think of the easygoing smoothness of Guinness Draft. Dark berry quality feels appropriate for late Fall and Winter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste like an average lager with some roasted notes. Decent enough, but I wouldn't buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - About what is to be expected. A lighter bodied Guinness, but Guinness' strength, it's nice, creamy mouthfeel, is nowhere to be found. That's a bad thing. I'd drink it if offered, but I'll probably never buy it again, especially if it comes down to this or either of the Guinness stouts."

"picked up a mix six of random beers , most of the beers available were ones i already had . it had been a while since i had a black lager and give it a go. cola color with a nice malty colored head . the roasted malt aroma is pretty faint. it is a drinkable . was hoping for a bit more out of this beer , for my none beer drinking friends this can be a stepping stone for the style."

"Pour is cola in color with a thick off-white head. Nose is bland, but a bit roasty. A little bit sour, maybe? Really watery...it’s hard to really smell anything. The flavor is just as bad. It’s almost like drinking black water. Just a hint of roasted malt, a tinge of sourness, perhaps a light earthiness, but I’m really stretching for that one. Not sure what the appeal is here."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not too enjoyable. I'd certainly prefer it to a yellow fizzy beer, but when is that gonna be the choice I'm facing ... Glad I bought just a single."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown, but not quite black in color, this beer has a tan head. Some streaks of red shine through the liquid when it's held to the light. The aroma has a touch of malt...a little roasty...dark chocolate and faint coffee. It's a clean smell, no fruit and little hops. The taste is equally clean and the mouthfeel is smooth. Some chocolate and toasted malt, together with a medium hop bitterness. Medium to light in body. It's not as flavorful as I would have liked. Nothing offensive or wrong with this beer...it's a clean and tasty black lager. Unfortunately, there's also nothing particularly exciting here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a somewhat weak brew. It is pretty one note, but it just seems watered down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink but could use a fuller body and stronger aromas and flavors. The appearance is quite deceptive because you would think that this beer is a lot fuller-bodied than it actually is."
"Overall, we think this is a beer that was made to be mass produced and is not sticking to the roots they are known for. Its refreshing but has little more than that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Hate to keep comparing it to Guinness Stout, but it’s hard not to. I’ve always been a fan of black lagers, and this delivers on expectations. It’s a dark lager that tastes like Guinness. A little easier drinking if less satisfying take on the original. That said, very drinkable. Again, light, but with a nice flavor."
""
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Thin tan head. Smells of brown sugar and dried prunes. Taste is clean lager yeast, followed by some mild cracker malt, and finishing with a tangy, slightly roasted coffee finish. Mouthfeel is average. Overall an OK beer, though a bit bland."
"O: Simplistic and thin, I guess this beer is supposed to be Guinness for people who don't actually like Guinness. Easily drinkable, but still not sure why I would want to."
"O=I'm not overly familiar with Euro Dark Lagers, but this was somewhat enjoyable. I wouldn't purchase a 6-pack of it, but might try it on tap or would choose it over most adjunct lagers, if I was in the mood for a more bitter beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good but not great, you can and will find a whole lot better even from Guinness for the same price. Salud!"
""
""
"It's a decent beer, but nothing to write home about. Guinness is mostly overrated to begin with and this new beer does nothing to dispel my feelings. It's something better than normal ole draught, but it's a very average beer. Fairly easy to drink."
""
"A rather impressive lager to me. Poured nearly black with hints of brown. nearly no head left though, may be a half finger or so. Taste was sharp but overtly refreshing. beer was very heavy though. good beer for repeadly drinking for a few days or so then off to the next one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Comparable to most of the other Euro Dark Lagers I have tried. The mouthfeel is just a bit too light but besides that, not bad."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Guinness pint glass. A dark brown, almos black color. Can see why they call it black lager. Smelled like a less aromatic version of Guinness. Nothing really jumped out at me, flavor-wise. This bottle had been in my fridge for a while, so it tasted a bit sour towards the end, but not bad. Overall, a fine beer. Much more ""drinkable"" than regular Guinness. Nothing to write home about, but fine. If you like Guinness, this would be a good alternative for the warmer months."

"Guinness Black Lager pours a very dark copper color with a tan head from a brown 330 ml bottle. The head is leaving a thick lace as it fades. The aroma is kind of bready. When it's cold there is only a slight bit of roastiness and that's it and it's not much better or different when it warms. Not terrible, but the question remains, why bother?"
""
""
""
""
""
"An OK enough black lager, I suppose, just lacking a bit of sass, in either the crispness of the grain, or the roast, or the hops. Nothing wrong, really, but nothing all that right, either - for that manner, it does well to follow in the footsteps of its (much) more ubiquitous stout brother."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this beer isn't half bad. Granted, I'm partial to the Euro dark lager style, but I'd definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent malty lager which is a nice addition to the Guinness line of products, but just an above average beer unlike the classic Guinness Stout."
""
""
""
"Though it looked amazing in my glass and smelled wonderful, the taste was average at best and it had the consistency of water. I have yet to have a good glass of Guinness here in the States, hopefully I will be proven wrong if I ever go to the Emerald Isle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Meh, about what you'd expect. It's Guinness minus anything distinguishing."
""
""
""
""
""
"I absolutely love Guinness, as well as the Foreign Extra, and I think this is a great beer. It was getting so much hate that I decided to create an account and do this as my first review. It is very refreshing and goes down great. Not much smell, but great taste and after-taste, and easy to put down if you are looking for something lighter than Guinness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was okay, but nothing special. Not very flavor. My brother described as the equivalent of an American amber. I agreed."
"overall I have to mark this even LOWER than the macros becuase I hold Guinness to hi standard and they fell WELL short."
"Overall - Nothing too spectacular, but not bad. I prefer the original stout, as the lager is a bit more one-dimensional in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The lager pours black with a moderate tan head that diminishes to skim, yet leaves lacing down the glass. The aroma is medium-low malts; roast, a bit of chocolate and a bit grainy. The flavor is pretty much the nose; medium-low roasted malt, a little bittersweet chocolate with a dry, crisp finish. The carbonation is medium-high and body medium-light. Overall the flavors are restrained yet still there, decent beer, ideal as a night long session beer with some character."
""
"O- it's not bad....it's not great....it's just there. Easy drinking."
""
""
"I'm glad I still grabbed a six pack of foreign extra at the liquor store."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall its an ok beer if you want an easy drinker with a bit more flavor than say a bud. But other than that nothing exciting."
"I cannot comment on the appearance of the beer as I drank it out of the bottle."
""
""
""
"My son bought a twelver of Bud Light Plantinum at the same time I got this, and the bud was better. It kills me to say that."
"Overall pretty much a typical Black Lager, nothing here to make it particularly memorable..."
""
""
"Overall: On sale for St. Pat's, I bought a 12-pack (actually about a 11 pack of 12 fl oz bottles) for $12.99. Not a bad price to try this out. Overall, I applaud Guinness for doing something different, I just think that this a bit subdued and ""safe""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it wasn't that bad just boring and unimpressive. If you're a huge Guinness fan it might be worth a taste other wise I wouldn't bother."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. A very dark black with almost a half inch tan head with good retention, smells sweet with roasted malts, not very aromatics. tastes good, like roasted barley, a little sweet and very litltle hop bitterness not a whole lot of flavor coming out of here. mouthfeel is smooth, on the lighter side with low carbonation. Overall its a good beer with nothing offensive to speak of. Very easy to drink and Im glad I tried it. A good beer for this St. Pattys Day Weekend!"
"Guinness Black Lager pours a dark brown, with some ruby highlights, and a slight tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lace. Roasted malt dominates the nose, with hints of chocolate, cocoa, and coffee peaking through. Roasted malt flavors again take over the pallet, hints of coffee, chocolate, and caramel are noticeable. The lager yeast makes this medium bodied, medium carbonation finish crisp, clean and dry. A solid dark beer for a novice drinker or a beer blogging nerd like us."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: The taste makes me think they really did blend Harp and Guinness together for this one. Funny thing is, I like each of those beers on their own just fine, but this one combined, it's just OK and is less than the sum of the two beers alone. OK, but not worth having again."
""
""
"This beer pours black, period. There is a one finger, light brown head with lasting lace. The aroma is of burnt toast and anise. The flavor is roasted malt with nutty and phenolic notes. It's mouthfeel is light with a black licorice aftertaste. Guinness Black Lager is an okay beer, slightly recommended."
"Looks and smells like Guinness Stout. Coffee, roasted malts, and that ever so subtle hint of coffee, but the difference is the bite. Its got an astringent feeling that I associate with things like Budweiser, Coors Light, and Keystone. The taste is basically a combination of the Stout and a BMC. sad."
""
"O: I thought this was pretty good. Dare I say this impressed me more than the stout? On another note, do not compare this to a schwarzbier. This beer is not trying to be like Sam Adams black lager. It is a lager version of Guinness stout made with the intent to get customers who are too intimidated by the stout."
""
"Overall, I expected more, but maybe I shouldn't have. There's no reason to think the makers of one of the best stouts would be any good at making a dark lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-pretty ordinary, if its trying to be a schwarzbier, it misses the mark, wouldn't recommend"
""
""
""
"An okay black lager, well-balanced with what flavors are there. Certainly drinkable, but I would rather go with a Full Sail Session Black or McSorely Irish Black Lager if given the option for a black lager. If I want a dark Guinness product, one of the stouts would be more to my liking."
"T: It does taste a whole lot like a lager. Very light and smooth taste with some light flavors of roasted malt and a dry finish with a hint of coffee. Not particularly offensive but nothing I'd go out of my way for."
""
"Comments: Dry and very drinkable this beer is a good introduction to the dark side for regular lager drinkers when they want to try the deep end of the pool."
"The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall this one is not bad but I will always choose something else."
""
""
"As a Guinness lover, I was very disappointed with the Black Lager. I really wanted to like it but couldn't. Tried it cold & room temperture;and, with & without food. When poured, it didn't have the cascade; it didn't have the rich smell nor did it have the Guinness Taste. It sort of reminded me of what one would have if you added water to the Stout. And the price - not worth it."
""
""
"Overall: A very tasty black lager. Fairly straight forward flavor profile. Tastes like a lighter version of Guinness Stout."
""
""
"D: Very light in everything but color. Not a lot stands out other than th beer looks really good."
""
"I'm not too well-versed in the Euro Dark Lager style because I don't seek them out, but Guinness didn't make a bad beer here. Not satisfying to pick up a sixer of, but I'm glad my girlfriend brought some back to the house. Don't mind turning to it when I want a beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very easy drinking and refreshing, but maintains the classic Guinness character."
""
""
"Disappointing about sums up this beer. Poured from bottle into room temp glass. The beer is as black as the bottle...if it were a tire mark on asphalt I'd call it, not a scratch or burned rubber but maybe a ""skid."" Lacing was nearly absent. Head was weak and quickly dissipated into a big ""donut hole."" The flavor was not offensive but not memorable either. The mouthfeel, frankly, sucked. It was watery and overly carbonated - more like drinking a soft drink than a beer. I wouldn't but another unless my only other options were Bud, Miller or Coors."
""
""
"The nose is bland, maybe some faint bready smell, but that is it. The flavor is not much better. There is not a strong roast profile here; in fact, the whole thing is quite thin. Not sure of the purpose in adding this offering to the Guinness line."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance was interesting....looks to have a robust,hard hitting lager. Great foamy/spongy head,cocoa color,and flavorful color. The smell is quickly detectable,malty,smokey,coffee odor,but diluted clean too. The taste is all that,but the smoke overwhelms the malty/bread taste,or its too watered down..not sure. But I felt for a Guinness the taste is too diluted. Overall not bad,just not special like I was hoping."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very boring, lets say this it's better than buttwiper. I guess it was ok, but I was expecting SO much more from this company and was very let down. I can see what they are trying to do and that is build a better beer to compete W the American ""standard"" beers, well they have done that, but was that really an accomplishment or an epic fail, fail in my eyes. I won't buy another."
""
""
""
"This is the sort of beer that actively caters to the lowest-common-denominator of beer tastes. I'll be quite content to never drink another one of these in my life."
""
"This almost make Raul cry."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. Bottle into a pint glass. Light black in color ruby highlights. About a finger of off white head sits on top. Not much lacing to speak of. Mild roast up front with some bread like aroma. Taste is super light. Exactly what I expected. Decent carbonation. Not my style."
""
""
""
""
"D: Overall a light beer, little smell, little taste, good mouth feel till it dries your mouth out."
""
"O - I'm not trying to give Guinness a bad rap, but there are better black lagers out there...this one was just way too thin in every aspect"
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s not a bad beer but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
""
"Compared to regular Guiness this is a lighter beer. Now I don't mean it's a light beer, but it's easier to drink and not as heavy as regular Guiness. Besides that it has a slightly darker taste. A very refreshing dark beer for the summer."
"O- Not something I'd buy again but certainly not bad either. A good choice for those who are victims of the dark is heavy sterotype. A guiness for the warm summer months."
""
""
""
"O: Not bad. An average dark lager."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, but not my style either. I guess I really prefer ales. This one has a decent roast that may appeal to newbies, but is easy to move on to bigger and better beers."
""
"Bottle from Total Beverage Westminster poured a clear dark reddish brown with a lasting tan head. Aromas of roasted malt, light fruittiness and a hint of carmel. Mouthfeel was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of roasated malt, light carmel asnd a hint of fruittiness with a crisp lingering roasty finish."
""
""
""
"O: Not being a huge lager enthusiast, this really did nothing for me. I was okay, but not spectacular. If offered one by a friend I would gladly accept and drink without complaint, However as far as buying goes, I would not."
""
""
""
""
"O: Meh at best, the strange flavors made this one undrinkable and I drain poured it. A normal guinness stout is a thousand times better. This is just a failed experiment of some kind."
""
"Maybe I'm being a bit harsh here but I sure expected more."
""
"black pour with a lasting beige head with good lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, caramel,barley with some chocolate notes. Taste same as aroma with some light bitterness. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is roasted dark malts, barley, some yeasty notes with some light hops on the end. Seems a bit lacking in flavor and aroma for this style but drinkable. Overall nothing really remarkable, an average brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is really unexciting and just not cutting it for me. Really boring with nothing much to offer, I don't get the angle on this brew as to what Guinness was trying to do here, I don't see the appeal. I'd rather have a good Schwarzbier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not as good as Guinness Draught. It looses coffee and chocolate flavors for burnt and roastiness. Not a bad beer just not one I'd buy over the regular draught offering. Would drink if offered one though."
""
""
"Black with reddish highlights and a fluffy tan cap. Decent head retention and lots of clingy lacing. Mild aroma with just a hint of roast, green grapes and dry maltiness. Mostly the same in the flavour, with low bitterness faint chocolate. I'm just not a fan of how the roast and malt character clashes with the grapey fruitiness. Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. This is pretty middle of the road for me. I won't look for it again though due to the odd combination of flavours."
"Malty aroma has a smoky undertone and a firm yeasty note. It pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with a thick, frothy, light tan head. Malty, smoky flavor has hints of molasses, licorice and coffee. Texture, unfortunately, seems to be on the thin side, though it has a good fizz. OK, but their classic stout is still the best. On tap."
"If you like black lager, drink this."
""
""
""
"O - not Guinness' best effort. It's not a terrible beer, but I wouldn't purchase again"

"This is a big miss for me."

"Poured from the 11.2 oz bottle to a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. The name does not lie, it pours black color with little head that disappears quickly. Smalls of dark malt but it is not very strong at all. Tastes of malt with a hint of hops. Has a good amount of carbonation, but has a little bit of an aftertaste. Overall, an ok beer."

"Drinkability - good flavor in a lighter form. A workable alternative when options are limited."
""
"D/O: This isn't what I expected, but I don't know why I had higher expectations.  Pretty boring, not very well balanced, and mouthfeel is unpleasant.  I swiped one of these from my dad, and probably should have left it in the fridge for him."
"Black Lager pours a black color, with a nice size light tan head. The smell is a bit cheap, has a bit of a roasted malty aroma, but not sweet. The taste is a little smokey, pretty malty, some bitter and hops come through, but its small, and its a very wet flavor. A bit too carbonated, and not sure if I would go have a few of these. Overall its not a horrible beer, its pretty decent, has a cheap but trying taste, it just isn't there, I hope Guinness can redo this one and bump it up, it really needs less carbonation, and a drier taste, almost there but not quite."
"Beer is medium in body and tastes like nothing really. I take that back it is rather thin on the palate, finish is fine, unoffensive but not bold or interesting in any way at all. A lot like Guinness."
""
"Probably a good beer to convert people who think all dark beer is thick and nasty. There are no off flavors, and what is there is plenty mild."
"I thought it was the best out of the draught extra stout and foreign extra. I like strong beers but I think the bite of the foreign extra ruined the taste. Id say the extra stouts better than the draught and I just really like the taste of the black lager. They go down so good and smooth, its a really enjoyable beer."
"Overall, not very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"I don't really know what to think about this one. It's almost like a watered down version of original Guinness. It's very drinkable but if I'm drinking a dark beer, I prefer a bit more kick."
""
"Overall Drinkability - No off characters. Drinkable and smooth. Good 'craft' gateway for BMC diehards."

"D- this is a case of where classification can get you a bad rep.. taste is more like a EDL, but they decided on naming their baby black instead of dark. it's somewhere in between with a little bit of weak stout DNA mixed in. a failed attempt in my opinion, but i know several people who really like it. still not bad and entirely drinkable, i just wouldn't buy another sixer."
"Picked up a single for $2. Poured a near-black brown with a tan head. Huh, this is essentially a blander version of Guinness Draught. There's no sour tang, and also almost no aroma - just a faint bready, not roasty, malt note. It's similarly bitter through the finish and the body is light. It's drinkable and there's a vague cocoa taste - I'd even say there's more citrus hop flavor than malt - but there's not a lot going on here. It's a boring beer."
""
"O: A certain step down from any other Guinness offerings. Good drinkable beer, and probably a good session beer, but nothing special."
""
""
"Slainte and Happy New Year."
"Overall: A pretty good beer- it has a lot of promise, but it sticks a little too much to macro-brew principles to truly realize its potential."

"Overall: A sessionable “dark beer” that I wouldn’t turn down if offered. Nothing to bring me back for more, just another tick on the list as far as I’m concerned."

"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some grains and grass. The taste is slightly sweet, kinda malty, but with some grains/grass, and caramel. Medium Body. Not too bad, but still would not buy again."
"O/D-Hey, I really didn't mind this one. I gotta respect the innovation. Trying to sell a dark brew to a populous of beer-water drinkers. Hell, it could have went way worse."
""
"Dark ruby-brown hue with an inch of fluffy tan foam that settles to a thin covering. Sweet, lightly smokey, mild roasty aroma with some creamy chocolate notes. The flavor is surprisingly weak...dark grain and caramel. Maybe a hint of cocoa. Thin, somewhat bitter mouthfeel. Not too good. Pretty boring overall."
"O: Not overly impressed with this offering from Guinness they should stick to the original."
""
""
" The feel is is just right, snappy and dry lager body, light to medium with a smooth, creamy finish with plenty of jazz and kick left to make it VERY easy to quoff. amazingly easy Quoff."
"This beer reminds me of the Guinness Draught but it is a bit more flavorful. The stout is my favorite, so this does not stack up to what I want. It is a pretty good lager and I would take this over any light adjunct. I enjoyed it and might buy it again. Pretty good but for the most part, I will stick with the stout."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Personally, dry stouts always leave me wanting, as if someone skimmed the top off an Imperial or foreign extra stout and served it to me. This beer is along those lines: less nutty than a brown porter; less roast character than a robust porter or any other proper stout; restrained roastiness more in line with a dry schwartzbier. If you like Guinness draft you’ll like this."

"Was pretty hesitant about this at first after a recent trip to Ireland. But turns out this is the only Guinness I will drink since returning to the states. Although it does resemble the taste of regular Guinness it offers a more malty, nutty flavor that is enjoyable. Best Guinness in a bottle by far!!"
""
""
"I'm slightly disappointed in this beer. It is not reminiscent of the Guinness flavor I am fond of. I would much rather taste coffee, espresso flavored roasted malt. If I close my eyes, I feel like I'm drinking a lighter lager like a Bass Ale, Harp, or something similar. I would much rather stick to Guinness Stout."
"Not very good. Oddly bitter and dry."
"O- Overall, good but I was expecting better. For the price there are better black lagers so I may not try this again."

"Overall it's a very decent, enjoyable beer."
"I first tried Guinness Black Lager with an open mind, and knowing its not supposed to be like the original Guinness. Hence the name Black Lager! I Liked it allot, and i am not a big lager fan. It has now become what I call my everyday drinking beer. It is a nice dark lager with a slight roasted taste."
""
""
"Overall: There were very few beer options at the event I was at, so it seemed like a good idea at the time. In retrospect, I probably should have seen this coming. This is something I will not be having again. At least since they are going for that 'import' vibe I only had to have 11.2 oz. of this failed experiment."

"Overall very disappointing for a beer brewed by Guinness. There are so many good dark lagers, Guinness should have stuck to the beer they are good a brewing and it wasn't this one."
"Black in color, just like the name says and like a typical Guinness. White head poured from a bottle. Very surprised with the taste! It wasn't very thick and tasted like a very smooth lager. Smells of roasted malt and dark chocolate. This roasted taste is throughout the entire beer and makes it different."
""
"Overall I'm not especially impressed with this one."
"oh, guinness. stick to irish stout."
""
"Smooth but on the thin side. Nothing offensive but also nothing stands out to make it at all memorable."
""
""
"O: I doubt if I would come back to this"
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Head gone in a flash and no noticeable lacing. Aroma has that ""prepared to be dissapointed Euro-lager vegetable smell"" although if I dig a little deeper there's kind of a pleasant honey note. Taste is pretty bland with mild roasted malts and light hop prescence. Thin mouthfeel, kind of flat, a little dry on the finish. I realize that this beer was not aimed at someone who loves West Coast IPAs and Imperial Stouts but unlike this one, I've found most of the Guiness lineup acceptable. I'll probably see this in the future at a wedding reception as an offering to those who like better beer (it does have a cool looking bottle), but I'd probably have a Peroni or St Pauli Girl ahead of this one."
""

""
""
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of a off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight roasted malt, sweet malt, slight pale malt, and a hint of sulfur. Fits the style of an Euro Dark Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight roasted malt, hint of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hop, and slight sulfur. Overall, great appearance, good blend, but only average mouth feel, and the aroma and body are lacking."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's alright; if the flavors were stronger and it lost a bit of the carbonation it would be much better. Refreshing, but not very tasty."
""
""
"Just did not work for me - cannot see buying this again."
""
"O: Not your Father's Guinness. Frankly, the classic versions are much better. No need for me to have another of Black Lager when the original still exists."
"Cheers"
""
""
""
""
"O: Alright I guess. I could see drinking this now and again but it’s not my favorite."
"Rough all around despite the ups, and it's only a matter of time till my palate can't take anymore. I'm craving an Eisenbahn Dunkel to revive my mind...."
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty decent beer; looks like I like this one more than most. If you're looking for a beer like Guinness' Irish Dry Stouts, this isn't it, as it is more of an easy drinking lager, but I liked it. Lots of roasted malts and some nice fruit in the taste as well, I'd have it again."
""
"Guinness is trying to expand -- and maybe this will reach those uneducated beer drinkers that still describe Guinness draught as a ""heavy"" beer when they notice the more common word ""lager"" -- but when it comes down to it, I'm still reaching for a Guinness draught if I want a stout, or a Saranac/Sam Adams if I want a lager."
"Overall: Not a bad beer and certainly above average for the style. I could see myself getting a glass or two again. Probably my least favorite from the brewery. Try to grade against others I have had in the style. If I was not, this beer would be closer to a C."
""
"Personally, I believe that Guinness needs to be very careful when releasing beers. I love normal Guinness, and I always thought they could build their beers off of that. It seems they started from scratch. Maybe this is the Miller Lite of Guinness. But if that is the case, they should charge $15 a case."

""
""
"O: Light Euro lager for dark beer ""enthusiasts?"" Not sure what Guinness Ltd. was thinking here, but this beer is very unimpressive. Do NOT expect schwartzbier flavors, but rather something on par with Beck's dark, perhaps. I'd pass again and wil continue to wonder about why this beer exists."
"Drinkability – This is an easy-going beer that won’t impress anyone but will stay out of the sink."
"Black in color with a tan head with minium retention and lacing in the glass the smell is pretty lack luster no major aromas of anything. The taste of this beet was pretty plain no great strong flavors that I was hoping for in this beer. The mouthfeel was also very light and watery. This would be refreshing to have maybe one or two but not to sit down and really enjoy a beer. Overall this beer was ok but it was pretty much a major let down from what i was expecting"
""
"Uninspired and uninteresting. There are better beers out there that *deserve* your money."
""
""
""
" The taste is good, but not really impressive...I mean it is clean and slightly mineral in character with light lager yeast flavor and subtle toasted malt verging on roast notes with a light hop bitterness to accent the malt, the finish is dry and has only the slightest amount of sweetness. This is a pretty decent lager, but doesn't really do anything to differentiate itself from the rest other than to be well brewed without many flaws that are noticeable. I would drink this again since it is a good value for the price and I am a fan of the style."
""
""
""
"Color is black with an almost brown, bubbly head that leaves a good deal of lacing."
""
""
"The Rest: Not very good - more black water than black lager. Wouldn't waste my time with this one again."
""
""
"The beer is totally black, or maybe so dark brown that I can't tell the difference. It has nice carbonation, but the weak and quickly dissapearing head is dissapointing. Maybe it's my bottle, but there is an overpowering metal smell, mixed with a very faint, but nice, roastiness. The taste also had a faint, mild roastiness,with possibly a hint of molasses, kind of reminding me of a mild brown beer (because it's a bit bland). The beer is so easy to drink and I love the carbonation on my tongue. It's mild to medium body with the really great mouthfeel makes me want to swish the beer around my mouth before swallowing. This beer is ideal for a thirst quencher on a hot day, but a lot of times I'll prefer something much bolder."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Perhaps it's best attributes are the aroma and crispness to it's finish. The taste really left me expecting/wanting more character. It is easy drinking and overall quite a forgettable experience."
"D: Highly drinkable as it is low ABV and drinks very very easily."
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom 335 ml brown glass bottle, sealed with a pop-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"Quick take: Guinness brews Beck's Dark. Perfectly fine Dunkel, I was worried it might somehow be some sort of off light stout, but no, it really does taste like a German dark lager. To those asking why, well, why not, except the usual Guinness premium price tag? I picked up a six-pack of this for $7 in NH which was why I tried it. Not worth any extra outlay if the Beck's is there and cheaper, but if you can find it cheap, try it."
""
"Lesson learned, don't judge a brew by how it looks in the pint glass. A C brew especially on a morning that is 27 	degrees."

"O - Very sessionable lager. Better than I expected."
""
""
""

""
""
"This is a very poor outing and likely my one and only time trying this beer. Thin and watery, a sour astringent taste and poor acidic aftertaste. I love Guinness Stout, but this is not a winner."
"Black liquid with a thin, off-white head. Aromas of roasted grain and yeast, with a hint of chocolate. Toasted chocolate flavor with crisp grains and seltzer. Light hints of caramel and cola. Has a light, easy-drinking body despite looking like something that should be much thicker. I'll definitely be drinking this again."
""
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts. Taste is mild, some malts, a touch of bitterness at the finish, not very flavorful. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a decent but unspectacular beer."
"O: 4"
"O: not good, nuff said"
"Overall very drinakable and not bad at all, though I think I would rather just have a Guinness. Like many have said, I'm not sure what the point of this beer is, as regular Guinness is much better, and not heavy. Perhaps the idea that Guinness is too ""heavy"" prompted the creation of this one... Just ok, but there are much better options out there in just about every category."
"O- There's not much substance to it. It's easy to kick some back, but there's nothing worth remembering here."
"D- Overall, a very light beer that has a nice, if watery, maltiness to it. Not something to marvel at, but it's an easy drinking beer when you're feeling thirsty."
"Overall, this beer drinks easy and tastes alright, but it's simple so if you're expecting a lot you won't find it here."
"Well this is just bad it is not that it has poor taste it just has no taste. It has a dark look with a decent pour to it but that is where it ends. It is a water tasting lackluster attempt by guinness very disappointing. I would say to pass on this if your in a guinness mood and get the stout."
" and nothing more."
"O-it feels like every part of the flavor restrained in this beer. I don't dislike this beer, but im not sure I would seek it out again."
"Poured into a weisse vase, the beer pours jet black, with a large, foamy cascade that is like watching a Guinness Stout cascade on fastforward. You end up with a huge, chunky, airy, foamy, light brown head that starts around two inches, but settles into an uneven covering. Sparse lacing along the glass as the head settles. Aromas are clean, with a dark roasted scent riding alongside a grainy nose. Flavors are rich, with a roasted, almost charred flavor throughout the backbone, and a bitter, light hopping at the end. Also, the beer has hints of coffee throughout. The aftertaste is short and sweet, with a round, sweet, somewhat nutty flavor to it. Very clean, smooth finish. Interesting brew from the Guinness company."
"Poured into my Guinness Pint glass with a frothty tan head with thick foamy lacing. Dark Brown not as black as the stout. Very earthy aroma with hints of raisins. Flavors of coffee, dirt, and smoke. Nice light flavor and easy to drink. A little bitter at the end. I'd rather drink the stout and I do not agree with the comercial of this beer making people enjoy a dark beer."
"O: Just barely average, won't buy again unless confronted by competing macro lager swill."
"O: This brew is on par with their trademark stout, good but not great just kinda middle of the road."
"I was a little disappointed by Guinness's take on Black Lager, but it's not bad."
"Pours out black, held up to a light some red hues shine through. Smell is really pale, some roasted hints . Taste is also really pale, nothing offensive here at all, just really watery, some roasted taste hidden in the back. mouthfeel is like water. Overall not horrible, but i would much rather enjoy a typical guinness."
"Overall, this is passable, and I drank the whole bottle, I can't say it was all that enjoyable though. I wouldn't search this one out."
"Head disappeared to a lace. Nose is roasted malt, much like regular Guinness. Flavor us of roasted malt, and enough hop to dry off the tongue. Harder carbonation then regular guinness lighter mouthfeel than Guinness. Refreshing, marketed to a light beer drinker that wants to look like a good beer drinker. Looks like light Guinness, smells like light Guinness, tastes like light Guinness, you do the math. Not bad, better I think then the other reviews state, I could drink this all night, but then again I could drink Guinness all night, so there isn't too much point to buying more of these, I'll just buy the regular black stuff. Side note, went really well with horseradish cheddar."
"---Rated via Beer's Advocate for iPhone"
"overall a disappointment as far as black lagers go. there are much better domestic versions of the dark lager variety, so there isn't much impetus to ever revisit this again."
"O- I'm not a big fan of this, and don't think I'll revisit it."
"Overall - The only thing this beer has going for it is the aroma which is misleading. This is a big mistake and is a pointless beer IMO. Scrap the losses in marketing and go back to making stouts Guinness."
"Overall: I was expecting to be disappointed from reading other reviews, but I thought this was a decent drinker. Smooth. Goes good with Swiss cheese. Sam Adams Black Lager is a bit better, but I have no complaints with this Guinness version. It won't win any stout drinkers away from the Guinness mother ship."
"Has a very strong chemical odor to it. Hits the tongue with a nice crisp kick then descends into chemical bitterness. The aftertaste is hard to describe but easy to explain: awful. Really surprising from Guinness. The initial taste and aroma are very romising, but soon after the initial taste everything falls apart."
"If I had to give a difference between this and Guinness Stout, the black lager is a little more watered down but not in a bad way. It is almost more crisp and refreshing but with still some of the roasty, malted characteristic of the Stout. That said though, it is pretty average across the board. It would be an easy one to pound back a lot of (I say that about a lot of average but not bad beers) if you were in the mood for some dark beer but nothing I will buy again."
"Overall- The black lager is different enough from the stout, but not really distinguishing enough to ever make it as popular as what Guinness is known for. Too average to convert anyone I think, and I doubt it will come as a surprise that it can be easily avoided."
"O: Nothing out of the ordinary here. Very average. I imagine this beer is aimed at the lager-obsessed U.S. mainstream market, but considering the popularity of Guinness Draught, this beer is more than a bit redundant."
"Overall: As bland, boring, and deficient as their flagship beer but without the treasured history of the standard Guinness Stout."
"Poured into a pint glass a brownish-black color with a rocky tan head of decent size that leaves just a bit of patchy lacing on the glass. Not too much in the aroma department, just basic scents of dark malts and light cocoa. Dark malts in the taste, grainy, lightly toasted, pretty basic. Decent but not overly flavorful. Medium mouthfeel at best, first sip actually seemed a little sandy? But maybe that was just me. Nothing spectacular, especially when things like Kostrizer Schwarzbier exist. Or Guinness Extra Stout, for that matter. Fairly drinkable, and worth a try, but that's about it."
"As this beer warms up it starts to taste more like that gross smell."
"O - Certainly not the best Euro Dark on the market. If given a choice between your average adjunct and this, the Guiness Black Lager might win, but not by a lot."
"O- Glad I got to try this, but this was a very bland beer. An easy pounder for sure but that's about it."
"O: This beer really disappointed me. It was a decent black lager - but with a name like Guinness I was expecting more."
"Notes: ??? Guinness as a lager? The carbonation gets in the way and it works against the sour flavor profile."
"The mouthfeel is not heavy, a drinkable beer but not an excellent one."
"O - Wasn't impressed by this offering. I think Guinness should have gone a bit bolder with this one."
"Easy to drink, ok but boring beer."
"O: Strange offering from Guinness. Maybe I just don't get it... Just not very Euro Dark Lager.. more Schwarzbier and not a very good one."
"This could be a fair session beer, but there are other brews out there that I would rather drink, including those with a lower ABV and more flavor and aroma."
"O - While I highly enjoy the stout and I am glad I tried it, I won't come back to it. There are more flavorful, well rounded black lagers on the market."
"*EDIT: I have had this beer many more times since my review and it has improved a bit in my opinion, i think the initial issue was that i was drinking it too cold which masked the taste notes, now i find it to be malty, slightly smokey and also a very slight hint of caramel, i have bumped up the smell and taste notes by a full point each and the same for the overall score"
"Taste is some black patent malt and tangy minerals. Not really very pleasant, to be honest. Not sure why, but I was expecting a little more from this new brew. Its watery, metallic and lacks any sort of character. I would like to see at least a little sweetness and would a hint of hop character be too much to ask? Im not even going to comment on the 'Cold Brewed' nonsense on the label. This beer is a total farce, avoid at all costs. Guinness should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves for creating this monstrosity."
"It's ok, but absolutely no reason to buy this over Sam Adams Black Lager."
"Just not very good at all. Truly, I would expect more from a beer coming out of Guinness. Not horribly offensive, but really nothing to recommend it. Not good."
"Better than I expected. Easily sessionable. Alot of people will probably hate on this because its from Guinness but it's actually not too bad for style."
"O-this is decent. definitely enjoyable. not alot of alcohol. not as thick as it appears. I dont mind this at all. nothing exceptional but overall pretty good."
"Guinness Black Lager is a black beer with a waxy, turbanado colored foam that has pretty nice lacing and retention. The aroma is very muted and of wet cardboard. There's a touch of roast and maybe spice in the nose. It's medium-light bodied; fluffy and crisp. It's lightly flavored from a dark malt twang at the first taste to a lightly bitter finish of coffee and medicine. This stuff just goes down like water. It's a very simple, refreshing black lager."
"Overall-Not exactly why this beer is being produced. People go to Guinnes to drink Guinness, not this."
"Overall...eh"
"O: Not actively bad, just so bland and inoffensive I can't see why anyone would want one. Sam Adams Black actually has flavor, as does Session Black. Try those instead."
"Pours a deep amber to black color with a light tan head.. In the aroma, caramel, note of chocolate, and still lager like. In the taste, light chocolate, note of caramel, both very mellow. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small roast to a clean aftertaste. Lack of flavor, but a lager form of Guinness for sure."
"Very thin and watery. On the positive side, you could drink a number of these in one sitting."
"I poured from a bottle into a nonic, dark pour, big white head, nice lacing. A little roast on the nose. It has a light roasted flavor, slight astringent notes, lingering bitter finish. The beer is very light in body, high carbonation, easy drinking. I would not buy this again."
"Why make this beer....why not? It's like a Coors light with a Guinness after taste. This seems to be the result of Guinness responding to the population at large's idea that Guiness is a heavy beer and for those who do like it that sometimes they want something lighter (funny in Dublin a met a girl that was drinking Bud heavy cause it was ""lighter"" than Guinness Draught) That said I'm regular Guinness drinker and while I don't love this I wouldn't mind it here and there."
"Cold brewed? Oh God, here we go. Pours dark brown with light tan head. Nose on the really light side with faint roasty malts & cocoa. Light flavors on palate of roasty malt and watery coffee. Watery light body. Very drinkable, but not much to savor as far as taste and nose though."
"Slight lager yeast taste (think Harp). A bit of sulfur. Creamy roasted barley chocolate flavor. Fairly hefty carbonation and light body. Just a tad sweet finish. Sort of a mix of the extra stout and Harp. Not bad. Definitely the most thirst quenching dark beer I've had in a while. Good for what it aims to be. I wonder if it will last??? I might buy it again."
"Not a bad beer. Just doesn't do much for me. Could use more depth and more roasted malt character."
"I was looking forward to trying this, & didn't really even have my expectations set very high, but this was not good. Don't think I'm going to finish this one."
"O: Taken as a Schwarzbier, this is pretty good."
"Overall – not horrible, but at the same time not the best type of brew I’ve had from Guinness."
"Dark brown colored brew, with an aroma of roasted malts, still very much like Guinness. In the taste, clean lager yeast with a touch of roasted malt. Reminds me of a dunkel. Light char and hop notes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a lager with roasted malts, somewhere between a dunkel, schwarzbier and regular Guinness."
"O: A non-discript offering from Guinness. I guess it's for people who want to be hip but do not like stouts."
"O: Guinness Draught was the first beer I ever had back in 2005 so this brewery will always hold a special place in my heart. But this beer is not good. I feel like Guinness just invented the black light lager. That's really what it is. Just reeks of corporatism and dumbing down for the masses. Foreign Extra Stout came out last year and it was great. I was hoping for something similar here. Didn't happen."
"O: This is a bland beer. Really, really bland. It's not offensive like Bud Light, but it's not good either. It reminds me of Beck's, with much the same ho-hum taste profile and watery feel. Warsteiner Dunkel easily bests this in pretty much every aspect, and is cheaper than most Guinness offerings. Avoid."
"Notes: I can't figure out what Guinness is trying to do with this beer. To whom is this supposed to appeal? My best guess is that they're trying to capture a new market segment by making a beer that's more America-friendly while still staying true to the essence of their brand. They know there's a lager bias here, and they imitate American macro marketing strategies by plastering ""Cold Brewed"" and other such nonsense on the label. But they had to keep it dark and roasty, lest they stray too far from the image they have crafted for the brand. The problem with this is that the misconceptions surrounding ""light beer"" and ""dark beer"" are too powerful to overcome by playing the ""lager"" card. ""Lager"" has become synonymous with ""light beer"" over here. The average Joe doesn't care that it's a lager, or that it's ""Cold Brewed," because it's still a dark beer; the fact that it's dark is what alienates people. So who will drink this? People who don't mind dark beer, i.e. regular Guinness drinkers. But regular Guinness is better, and has a cult following, so they won't drink it. No new market segment will drink it. Ultimately I think this beer will be a colossal failure here, and I'm already starting to see it happen. I asked around at all the local bars, and sales are miserable. What's even more befuddling is the fact that Guinness has other brands (Harp and Smithwicks) that are already (seemingly) effectively capturing other market segments for them. So why bother? What's the point of this beer? I don't know what else to say."
"$7.99 for a six pack in Atlanta, GA."
"I was not sure what to expect but after several goes at it I am still trying to wrap my head around its inception. Regular draught Guinness does a great job ... consistent, drinkable, the story behind it. Sort of a lesser Guinness that has a typical carbonation of a Euro Lager. I guess I just don't see the market for it. I can understand why FES was brought to the states, 10-15 years late to the party but this concoction just does seem to hit it with me. Not saying it is bad at all, it hits the right elements ... drinkable, easy going flavor. Is it for 38-56 year old males who make more than $75,000 a year that are not into beer that much but are sick other Euro Dark Lagers? If someone was looking for a dark lager why wouldn't they just look for a solid Munich Dunkel or a dark Czech lager? Go figure, best of luck guys ... still trying to figure this one out. Regardless, it is worth a tick."
"Tastes mildly burnt/roasty - but still light on the body, as opposed to the usual heavier stout. Very enjoyable, and though I'd rather sip on a warmed Guinness Foreign Extra Stout, this one hit the spot."
"O) At $6.99 for a six pack, they're certainly not stealing your money, but you'd be better off spending a bit more and really enjoying what you're drinking."
"Overall its not bad. Not something i'd go out of my way to get but I wouldnt say no to a free one!"
"I poured this good beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice black color. The beer poured a nice pillowy tan head. The smell was like a raw steak. Sorry, thats what I got. The beer really was kinda neutral tasting but I like it. The beer also had good lacing. I think it is a good product with a good name and people who do not want a strong beer will enjoy."
"not great. I was looking for more of a schwarzbier, I guess. barely any roasty/chocolate flavors, but all of the cheap lager flavors I tend to avoid. Glad I picked up a single."
"Overall kinda meh, drinkable but some off flavors, tastes like it was macro produced but not skunked or terrible, with a bit of hops and creamy malts."
"Overall- If you are wanting a strong flavored Guinness, look elsewhere. Otherwise this is a very drinkable brew. I could easily down a 6-pack of these in one sitting."
"O - I could enjoy a few of these in a sitting."
"D - this beer seems like an intro to Guinness. Mild aroma and mild taste, and as much as I love Guinness, I'd leave this one be."
"11.2oz bottle purchased at Shaw's in North Hampton. Pours a nearly opaque dark brown to black body with a half inch or so of light tan head. Malt and milk chocolate comprise the aroma. Roasty coffee, chocolate, malty notes make up the flavor, though it finishes relatively clean. Medium to light in body with ample carbonation. An easy drinker - the flavors mesh well and don't clobber you over the head and the carbonation, body, and clean finish make this beer seem fairly light. Not bad overall but I'm not sure I'll be having this again any time soon."
"Overall I know there are tons more offerings that are more complex or have more hops but this seems to work pretty well. I was kind of shocked to see such low ratings on this one since it could easily stack up again some craft offering in the B or B+ category. To each his own I guess."
"Overall - Not worth the time to drink really, too watered down, lacks flavor, complexness and anything to remember. Pass on this."
"I am in a bodega in Brooklyn a week ago and, what is this? Black lager from Guinness? I had to try it. Not a very good one from a solid brewery. A bit too strong initially, but not overpowering. The flavors linger too long on the palate and not in a pleasant way. Don't go out of your way for this one."
"Pours to a thick but quickly receding buff head and ruby-black color. Aroma is very weak sweet grainy lager smell with very little roast detected. Flavor is equally weak and bland. I would not know there was any roasted barley in it blindfolded except for the finish. Mouthfeel is OK and there is where the ""unique character of Guinness"" shows up. Overall, I ask myself ""what's the point?"" I could have had a regular Harp lager and not known much different."
"O: Overall light and mostly bland. With my eyes closed there is very little roasted flavor at all. Seems like this was created for a crowd who likes adjunct lagers, but wanted a change in color."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle marked: 15:13-L1208GF001.Sampled on September 29,2011. The pour is a nice looking dark brown with a thick, fluffy head and excellent retention. There is a nice aura of roasted malts and barley that teases the nose in a subtle, mellow fashion.The body is better than medium. The flavor brings out a muted maltiness with the slightest of hop bitterness brining up the rear. I found it to be more appealing than a lot of previous reviewers."
"Nothing spectacular, which is what happens when you brew a beer with mass appeal, but not too shabby either. It's decent and easy to drink and would satisfy me in a pinch, but I'm not inclined to buy it again either."
"O: This is just another one of those skippable beers."
"This pours a dark brown with a decent mocha colored head. The smell is pretty light, a little burnt malt smells, kind of like a really light version of the extra stout. The feel is a little thin. The taste is pretty much like it smells, take the extra stout, burnt flavors and all and tone it down by 50% and you'll get this. Overall this probably is an okay session beer but its pretty toned down and I can't see myself buying it ever over a Guinness stout (and at that there are better stouts out there)."
"well i did read a few reviews before i bought this beer and i see it didn't rate that high and i really like guinness extra stout so it can't be that bad. pours very dark brown with a one finger tan head that didn't hold that well but did leave a nice lace. smells and taste of mild roasted malt a light hop taste smooth light mouthfeel ending slightly dry. its ok but why not have a guinness extra stout its so much better."
"Grabbed a 6 pack of this last night to take to my friends place. I figured since it was new I'd like to try it at least and see how it was. This brew poured out as a deep brown color with a fizzy tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer reminded me of most European Lagers, I suppose I was able to pick up on some roasted malts on the nose. The taste of the beer is decent It's pretty well balanced between roasted malt and a bitter lager. The flavors to me are similar to what Beck's Dark is like. The mouthfeel has a good drinkable quality to it with a pretty good dry feeling in the back end. Overall this brew isn't all that bad. I still prefer Guinness Draught on tap but I respect the ideas that they are trying to put out in bottles recently."
"O - a fine new introduction well worth a try, especially on those occasions where only beers from major distribution networks are available."
"O: Not all that bad; fairly refreshing and not offensive at all; in many ways I prefer this to the stout because it is what it is: thin, refreshing, and cold"
"Atmosphere is okay. Deep dark appearance, with a nice head and a little lacing. Nose is pretty plain, too. Flavor...same. Overall, a decent enough quaff."
"A light bodied lager that was easy to drink however, it lacked the flavor that one would expect from Guinness."
"O- Eh, not impressed. Drinkable but not something I will buy again."
"It seems that everyone is trying to compare this to their flagship beer and that's totally inappropriate. It's a Euro Lager - it's pretty sessionable and it's basically just not bad. Could they have done better? I'm sure, but it's something new - reminds me of a thin Smithwick's."
"Conclusion: This is better than the other Euro dark lager I have tasted (Baltika), but it still isn't that great. If I am going to drink Guinness beer, I would always take their stout, extra stout, or foreign extra stout (really good stuff!!) over this."
"More of a pedestrian (at best) Euro dark lager (as categorised here) than a traditional black lager as it claims to be. The label says to drink straight from the bottle, which is a ridiculous suggestion."
"O= a superb offering overall by Guinness which should hopefully find wide acclaim."
"Pours out a dark brown with a thin tan head that has some retention and very little lacing. The smell is roasted malts and some coffee. the taste starts out with some sweet malts, grains and finishes off with some coffee. The mouthfeel is very thin and watery and very light bodied for a Guinness. Not a bad beer overall and might be good once in awhile but nothing great."
"O - Average at best. I wouldn't drop money on this beer ever again. I would drink it if it was free though."
"O: This beer sucks. I love Guinness draught and stout and will defend the big G until my dying day, but this beer is horrible. Having bought this as a single due to interest, I wish I had instead just bought a 40. Don't buy this beer."
"Any who cheers!"
"M/O: Not overly carbonated which gives it a nice silky texture. Good flavor but a little plain."
"Pours a cola colored dark brown with red hues and a bubbly/ rocky tan head that clung nicely to the glass. Smells of roasted barley with a hint of coffee and a slight sourness. The taste is very metallic, a little bland, the most dominant flavors are roasted barley and earthy hops. It has a medium body with low carbonation and a dry finish. I thought this beer was ok but it lacks in the flavor department, I'm glad Central Market sells singles because I wouldn't have wanted to buy a whole six pack."
"I'll never drink this again. Gimmick beer at best."
"It's close to medium bodied and has moderate carbonation. A relatively good mouthfeel and is pretty easy to drink. It's not bad."
"Disappointing overall. I had hoped for more. Having said that, well made, of course, and hints of possibilities in the flavor. But hints aren't enough for me."
"Overall: A decent dark lager from Guinness. Could of used a little fuller body and less carbonation. Coffee flavor is nice."
"O-okay, compared to other classic black lagers, this is missing something...its not as exciting or flavorful, but is more drinkable than some others. but as a dark euro lager, this seems to be really good. its actually the best ""euro lager"" that i've had. can't quite find why people dislike this. i'm finding this to be quite enjoyable, and i'm excited that i decided to get a whole 6-pack."
"O-It's not so much that it's bad, it's just really boring. It fulfills the bare minimum requirements to be a dark lager, without shooting for anything beyond mediocrity."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost black color. The head is on inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of mostly nothing with a very faint hint of roasted malt. The taste is hard to detect for two reasons: first it is very faint, second, the extreme carbonation makes it difficult to leave this beer in my mouth longer enough to pick up anything. Not only is the mouthfeel way to aggressively carbonated it is water thin. Overall, this beer is really bad. I wasn't expecting a ton of flavor being that it is brewed by Guinness, but I was expected some flavor, and this beer simply doesn't have it."
"When it comes to products that sport the Guinness name, I'lll stick with the stouts. Still, I wouldn't decline this if offered."
"O: This is definitely a Guinness stout but just with a clean lager yeast. This is still pretty sessionable and easy drinking. This is an awesome beer. I really enjoy this, I could drink this all night, and the next week."
"Guinness Black lager is exactly what it says it is. A commercial, mass produced dark lager from a company know for their stout, that being said. Could it be more hoppy and aromatic? Yes. Can you taste carmelized, dark malt? Yes, medium taste. Is it lighter in mouthfeel, due to being a lager? Yes. A lot of people have trashed this beer for all of the above, unfairly I think. Is there better examples of this style, undoubtably(sp). Is this a great beer to someone who thinks Guinness stout is too heavy or burnt tasting, but wants to hang with the Guinness crowd? YES. Its a serious lighter version of a dark beer. Its not trying to conquer the lager market."
"Dark roasted barley malt provides a dark mahogany tined cola brown body with a light tan khaki head forms thick with highly carbonated bubbles. Aroma has a touch of coffee and nut roasted malt quality about it. Somewhat of an airy herbal quality tucked away as well, calling it a Euro dark lager or a schwarzbier light. Flavor is roasty with malts up to a point then it tries to be a stale dark brewed watered down old coffee acrid bitterness that doesn't really blend too well. They went for Guinness with a Bud Light mouthfeel, using Coors Light cold brewed ad campaigns. Pretty sad comparing this to Guinness pulled from a nitro tap, flavor was downright disappointing and I'm sure beer people and mainstream drinkers think this is pretty piss poor as a whole. The harsh overcarbonation really makes the whole flavor of the beer unpleasant somewhere between light and medium bodied but it just doesn't do anything for me."
"D ~ Will never buy this again. I go into the purchase thinking this is a Schwarz, but I end up with a mediocre Euro Lager... I don't know what to think. Sad I have 5 more. Avoid."
"Was given a bottle by a business associate of to take home and try, knowing that i am a Guinness fan. I poured the beer into my favorite laser etched pint. The head is a little more bubbly than the stout, but other than that it looked like a pint of the draught. overall the combined taste and smell did nothing for me, it did taste like a traditional lager, but i was hoping for a little more of something from it."
"A nice session beer if anything else. Not too high in the alcohol department and it goes down easy."
"The mouthfeel is lightly crisp from carbonation in a medium body that's actually fairly smooth. If not for feeling so thin, it's not bad."
"Overall- Guinness is one of my go-to beers when I can't find anything appealing because all of their beers are good and fairly inexpensive, but this would fall far below adequate for even Miller/Coors and Budweiser."
"Wow, this is just bad. Doesn't warrant a full review, really. Pours clear, dark brown black with thin tan head. Nose smells like an amber lager, some caramel and frothy lager head. Palate is solid lager mouthfeel, but the ""black"" part of it has been phoned in. No real malt flavor to speak of. Finish is short and bland."
"I was hoping FES would be on the shelf but it's oddly not. Too bad because for every FES and Anniversary Ale, there's a dud like this."
"So anyhow this pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and a creamy off white head that quickly dissipates to a cap. No widgets in here to release nitrogen and keep this head stable for an hour. Smells, yup it smells, just like a macro lager. Pilsner malt, grainy, grassy, corny. There's a faint and I mean faint aroma of roasted grains, but I would imagine most of the color from this thing came from sinamar. Taste follows the smell really well and ends with quite a dry finish. Light body, medium carbonation, thin watery mouthfeel. Maybe this would make a good gateway beer for someone, but for me this one was a let down. Nothing exciting here at all."
"O - Guiness missed with this one. I was hoping for a flavorful black lager and instead we got Guiness Lite."
"I'm so disappointed in this. Regular Guinness isn't spectacular, but it's pleasant and drinkable despite it's giant stature. This just sucked. Smelled awful, tasted bland, and nothing pleasurable about drinking it."
"wow im so glad i find this beer for 27 bucks a case it worth it. its black baby mt favorite color . looks good in a glass a nice beer smell with a taste like dark euro beers, because drinking the regular guinness doesnt do anything for .overall i would drink this and tell other so go try it"
"Pours a fantastic black color with wonderful head and some very nice lacing. Excellent scent with a cool and sweet maltiness, great toastiness scents, and hints of chocolate. Fantastic flavors, with a great smooth and sweet malt with excellent undertoned yet noticable chocolate bites, and slight coffee hints; slight earthy hop finish. Extremely smooth, it goes down a treat."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours black with about an inch tan head that went away quickly. There's a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, and some bittersweet chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a slight nutty flavor. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's pretty easy to drink and is well carbonated. Overall it's not bad, it's probably not going to impress you but I think it's a nice sessionable brew. I'd buy it again, it's a decent choice for a lower alcohol brew to end the night with."
"Overall I like it. Tasted on its own this is a decent Pilsner beer. Just don't expect it to taste like Guinness Extra Stout; this is its OWN beer."
"O- not horrible but not good. This would be a good go to beer for the college student with an adventurous outlook."
"Overall IMO it seems to me like they made this beer for people who don't like Guinness because they think it's think and heavy (which it is Not!). It seems like the same beer yet fermented cold and lacking nitro making it a boring watered down version."
"Overall this is what I expected from a brew that is trying to please the masses in America. I can just see the guys in the board room trying to figure out us Americans. Hmmm. light body, drinkable, wait... we are Guinness so it's got to be dark. can't have much alcohol. It's perfect if that's what you were looking for. Not for me. Thanks to Skip for this sample."
"I dig on the mouthfeel and think that this is a nice alternative to your everyday lager. The sizzle on the tongue with a slick Guinness feel is a nice contrast and really balances the beer. I am looking forward to pairing it with some spicy mexican food to see if it can hang. Even though this isn't a bad beer it is very middle of the road. Nothing really bold or innovative and frankly the way it's marketed hurts me deeply. Guinness has been around forever and has some great brand loyalty. I don't see why they had to get all gimmicky with their labeling or even why they needed to step into the lager market. They even went as far as to imply Arthur Guinness who died in 1803 signed the description on the back of the bottle. This beer is worth a try but blackens the eye of the brand. I'll pass next time."
"Poured a brown/black but not opaque liquid with about an inch of light tan head. Smells lightly grainy, roasted and subtle chocolate. Taste is malt/grain roasted to the point of mild smokiness. Mouthfeel is medium with mild carbonation. Overall this tastes like a mildly smoked lager. Not bad, but not great either."
"Overally: I was hoping for more with this beer honestly but everything just kind of fell short"
"I draw a lot of similarities from Dry Stouts to Schwarzbiers, so I was hoping for a better discussion among the two from the classy brewers of Guinness. However, this vague dark lager misses the mark on quality issues and recipe formulation."
"Drinkability is good on this black lager. Normally, I can't drink too many black lagers, because the smoky dark malts get to me. However, this beer has a nice balance with very nice drinkability."
"O - This is an okay lager. I didn't have high hopes for it but it wasn't half bad."
"Overall, an uninspiring lager. The off flavor is overpowering whatever flavor this brew offers."
"Pretty substandard."
"In summary, underwhelming and really reminds me of an over-malty alcohol-free beer."
"overall not impressed yet not totally turned off by this beer. probably wont buy again, but wouldnt turn down if it was free."
"Pours a very dark brown/black color. I didn't get much of a head on this when I poured it into a chilled pint glass. Has a semi-robust scent of roasted malts and some sweet carmel hints. Has a pretty mild taste of some coffee and toffee hints. Fairly heavy taste but no real texture to it. The robust malts definetly hit the taste buds. It's nice to see something between the taste of a lager and the traditional Guinness stout, but I don't see this being a huge seller. Something new to try at least."
"Serving type: bottle"
"The body is very thin and watery and the carbonation level is medium low which does not compliment this beer at all. Drinkability is just above average, it's not hard to down the beer because it's so thin and watery but at the same time it's very boring, so not enjoyable. It's like they mixed 1 part Guinness with about 5 parts black lager. It ends up with a mash-up that does nothing to accentuate the roastiness of a good dry stout and the crispness of a good lager. I'd only choose this again if BMC is the only thing available. I'd much rather just have the original."
"Dr: It's worth the price, but it's so damn unambitious. It has sparked my interest in the dark lager style, which I've hitherto neglected."
"Aromas of roasted malt with some milk chocolate notes. Smell is surely reminiscent of your standard Guinness though a bit watered down. Rather neutral in flavor with light chocolate and some firm roast character on the finish, and increasingly so with warming as the feel dries out some. Nonetheless when ice cold the flavor is a bit too thin. So I ignore the label, decrying 'Enjoy Ice Cold'. Guinness Lightbody seems to have been the intent and in a sense I guess they succeeded."
"D - Like I mentioned earlier, I was really impressed with the appearance, but after all that buildup I was let down immediately after taking my first sip; weak flavoring will make me want to pass on this one"
"Is it an exceptional beer? I'd say no. Smell, mouthfeel, taste, etc all have that mass-produced vibe about them. But, on a hot day when a guinness seems overwhelming, but a light and fruity lager is depressing, this is not a bad option."
"D -- Well, it certainly goes down easy, but I don't find it that much more outstanding than Guinness Draught. In fact, the ""cold brewing"" might actually take away from the usual Guinness ingredients. Not sure what marketing plan put this on the shelves, but I think it's sort of redundant to the other Guinness offerings."
"Not very drinkable. Not sure how this got past the corporate tasting panel, unless they thought it would appeal to the macro masses. Won't repeat this one."
"Not a bad session ale. Simple flavors and palate make this beer a worthwhile try for any Guinness Stout fan. Overall this beer tastes and feels pretty close to the stout, but a little bubbly on the tongue."
"Not bad. Remember this is not a Schwartzbier or else it would be in that style category. Every big brewery in Europe has a light and a dark/amber version of their beer and this one tastes just like the average ones, only slightly better. However, those bers are ridiculously cheap, even by our standards. And I'm talking in Euros and they're still cheap. For the price of a six-pack of this brew I would say it is not worth it. Knock off $3 and I would buy it once in a while."
"Not good. Not awful... But not a beer I'll be buying again."
"D: Overall, I was not impressed with this beer, but I wasn't really expecting to be either. Just another overpriced beer on the shelf that doesn't offer anything new. It's not repulsive, and I'd probably drink some if it was free, but I won't be searching for it myself."
"Inoffensive though entirely unexciting dark lager."
"When I first saw it at the store, I thought Huh! Could be; why not? Although Guinness is in trouble and desperation can lead to weird things. Then I saw the ratings here and was kind of deflated. Then, I poured a huge, tan, foamy, frothy, sudsy head that lasts a while and lots of lace. The color is an opaque black brown. Aroma was very nice with toasty, malt, and toffee. Flavor it falls down: like the nose but much lighter. Body is very light and the force carbonation doesn't help. Finish is like flavor and short. Schwartzbier with all the calories and a touch of the flavor."
"I finally got around to trying this due to the fact that they refuse to stock the FES until this is out of the area. That being said it pours a nice brown color with garnet fringes and a nice frothy white head. The smell is a bit off. There is the caramel notes, but my nose had a hard time picking it up through a sour-like char aroma followed by a corn syrup smell. The taste still had that corn syrup in it, but it was much more muddled amongst the caramel and char flavors. It was a bit sour and watered down, but overall it went down rather smooth and was easy to drink. The problem I have is that it doesn't seem to be of high quality."
"Though I wanted to try some FES, this sounded interesting once failure was assured. It pours a shiny black-brown, edged with garnet, topped by a finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, light milk chocolate, wheat, and rice. I'm not sure how the smell tapers at the end like that, and it kinda bothers me. The taste holds notes of wheat and very light bits o' roasted and toasted malts. Thinks look dark and rich, but end up pretty weak. The body is a heavy light, with a moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a fairly tame and, for lack of a better word, average brew, but it's not offensive and it goes down pretty easily."
"Nice label though..."
"D - While I think it's too roasty for the style, Guinness Black Lager is probably a decent introduction for the non-craft consumer. It's not something I'd buy for myself, but I'd recommend it as a potential crossover beer."
"Very disappointing beer. I struggled to finish it."
"Too roasty to be just a dark lager, but no hops to make it a Schwarzbier. A confusing hybrid that doesn't really have a purpose."
"Overall - A very poor brew. I wasn't expecting much and indeed i wasn't given much. It's a bit like a poor lager with some roasted malt flavouring thrown in..."
