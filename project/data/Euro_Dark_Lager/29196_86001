Color was a deep-garnet or deep-ruby (SRM = > 27, < 34) with NE-quality clarity when held up to the dying light of the day. Nose had a very caramel-like sweetness, perhaps from the decoction. Caramel and milk chocolate, actually. Mouthfeel was prickly, as though the carbonation was very tight. The taste was smoky, chocolaty, a little nutty and somewhat caramel. Man, this was a liquid candy bar of some stripe, although I could not put my finger on it. Finish was a bit too sweet for my taste, but there was nothing intrinsically wrong with it. You might be disappointed if you had your heart set on a schwartzbier, but otherwise, this was a decent bier.","woodychandler","Oct 23, 2013"

I wish it would have included just a bit of roast however it's drinkability and clean profile make up for that. It is to be commended that this the first schwarzbier I have had in a long time that did not have a strange mineral aspect to the finish and little to no diacetyl. Well done, would drink again.","stakem","May 20, 2013"

It has a light pale malt scent along with a touch of black malt earthiness. It's bone dry with a slight bitterness. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth, earthy black malt flavor. It's faint, but adds a solid bitterness and excellent color. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, but nothing too interesting.
