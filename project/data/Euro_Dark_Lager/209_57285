3.29,4.8,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"This beer came out a while back and I recall getting a six-pack and destroying this in short order while doing yard work. It served its purpose admirably at this time. Now for the formal review treatment. Does look the part, brownish black with the odd red twinkle, certainly carbonated like a Euro lager, bubbly and can muster a decent off-white to vaguely tan colored head. Smells quite sweet and fruity, some fresh dough along with the requisite dark malt aroma that in this case recalls stale dark chocolate ... There is some pleasant roasted barley character on the nose though, which is of course linked in one's brain to the prototypical Irish dry stout whose fan base this brew is intended to lure over to the lager dark side. Palate is indeed a hybrid of Guinness style roasted flavors and lager traits, including aggressive carbonation and some lager yeast character. Quite dry, tastes roasted but with a little barley sugar sweetness and a fruitiness like red grapes lurks in the background ... I get a licorice toffee effect somewhere at the interface of grainy dough, chalky chocolate, and the aforementioned sweetness. There's the odd boozy note that emerges as well, the alcohol peaking out from behind the roasted flavors, and some grain husk and ash in the dry finish. A few off-flavors, metal and cardboard, but not terrible in this regard. I had the same problem with this beer than I have with its more famous brother ... You keep trying to taste more but at the end of the day its a simple no frills brew. Could be better, could be worse.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 28, 2013"

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, clean, not filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention, I'm sure I could drink more than a few of these if I was in the mood for it. I like the taste the most and the very thin body the least. I might buy this again and I would order it at a bar if nothing better was available. I would recommend this to anyone who wants the lightest possible dark beer, if regular Guinness is too thick for you then this might make a good alternative. All in all this isn't a bad beer and it's about the same as a remember, not a bad choice when there's not a good selection at hand.","StoutHunter","Oct 20, 2013"

The smell is faint, but there are some nice malty and roasty aromas - it's nothing fantastic but it's okay. This is a beer that is less than meets the eye for sure - it looks like it'd be similar to guinness in taste, but it's a lot more milder. It's slightly sweet and slightly malty with a very clean finish and no unpleasant aftertaste. It reminds me of waterloo dark lager in that it is opaque as anything but doesn't deliver a huge hit of taste. That's not really bad though - this is still a fine beer and i'd gladly drink it again, but wouldn't buy a six pack - there is better stuff available.","Olek4374","Jul 23, 2013"

Appearance is dark chocolate black, with a three finger head that quickly dissipates to nothing. Smells of stale coffee, plums, raisins, and malts. Taste has a bit of dark chocolate, with heavy plums and raisins. Oddly, the aftertaste is stronger than when the beer is actually in your mouth. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Overall, a m'eh beer.

I knew it would now be as strong or have the body and flavor of a traditional Guinness Stout. But that was what I was looking for. Since the 6-pack was already chilled I had one when I got home and found it to be very refreshing and drinkable by its self on a hot summer day. This is a great dark beer with a low ABV that allows you to have several at one sitting.","gerite","Jun 21, 2013"

My pour created two dense fingers of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark brown with garnet highlights and good clarity despite its low light penetration. Nose had the characteristic lager honey-like sweetness, but in this case, married with a light roastiness. Chocolate malt, perhaps? I wonder about what, exactly, constitutes ""roasted barley"" for them. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, even for a lager, but the taste was a pleasant mix of chocolate and smokiness along with a mild sweetness. I do not like Cascadian/Dark/Black IPAs because I feel as though such flavors get in the way of my beloved hops, but in this case, they meld nicely. Finish was semi-dry and the mild smokiness seemed to linger well past the swallow. As usual, I would not want a steady diet of this as a self-avowed hophead, but it beats a lot of other lagers.

Aroma was minimal, with little hints of the roasted malt but not much depth beyond that. It's taste isn't bad, but it's not quite as robust as a German schwarzbier. It didn't really have the chocolate or coffee profile one would expect, but just a pared down ""roast"" flavor. Like a schwarzbier, turned down to 5 or 6. It has a good lager mouthfeel. It could be pretty good, I just wish that the roast flavor matched it's dark color.","delta490","Feb 15, 2013"

I found this one very smooth and drinkable as they should be. Not the sweetest or most bitter but the balance was about perfect. Sure, I would rather have a draft Kostritzer but since I live in the US, this is not always possible. Right out of the bottle this is a great dark lager which would pair well with any food. If I had more income I would keep this beer in stock but unfortunately in the present economy I cannot afford it. The McSorley's Black Irish Lager brewed by Pabst is much more affordable and IMHO has more flavor.","wattoclone","Feb 11, 2013"

Taste is much the same with a dark bread and metallic flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip.

Guinness Black Lager pours a muddy brown color with a full head that quickly recedes. The aroma is actually very nice, it does a good job at capturing the roasty essence of Guinness with a nice lager twist. The taste does away with most of the roast flavor, instead presenting a solid Euro Pale Lager-esque import taste with just a bit of the roastiness coming in on the finish. The mouthfeel is thin and light, but the drinkability is rather good. Overall, it's a slightly better than average twist on the Euro Pale Lager. Perfectly drinkable, I wouldn't mind having some of these when it's warmer out.","shand","Dec 24, 2012"

Be relevant. Current. What they don't understand is that the timeless rock of a beer they have been brewing for 250 years would keep them current on its own. Bc it demands respect. Its a fucking institution. Its not my favorite beer. I prefer more aggressive american stouts but its one of the worlds best liquids. Black lager is no better than yeungling black and tan or 1554.

2.93,-6.7,3.5,3,3,2,3,"Notes: I can't figure out what Guinness is trying to do with this beer. To whom is this supposed to appeal? My best guess is that they're trying to capture a new market segment by making a beer that's more America-friendly while still staying true to the essence of their brand. They know there's a lager bias here, and they imitate American macro marketing strategies by plastering ""Cold Brewed"" and other such nonsense on the label. But they had to keep it dark and roasty, lest they stray too far from the image they have crafted for the brand. The problem with this is that the misconceptions surrounding ""light beer"" and ""dark beer"" are too powerful to overcome by playing the ""lager"" card. ""Lager"" has become synonymous with ""light beer"" over here. The average Joe doesn't care that it's a lager, or that it's ""Cold Brewed," because it's still a dark beer; the fact that it's dark is what alienates people. So who will drink this? People who don't mind dark beer, i.e. regular Guinness drinkers. But regular Guinness is better, and has a cult following, so they won't drink it. No new market segment will drink it. Ultimately I think this beer will be a colossal failure here, and I'm already starting to see it happen. I asked around at all the local bars, and sales are miserable. What's even more befuddling is the fact that Guinness has other brands (Harp and Smithwicks) that are already (seemingly) effectively capturing other market segments for them. So why bother? What's the point of this beer? I don't know what else to say.","ryan1788a5","Oct 08, 2011"

Flavor is roasty with malts up to a point then it tries to be a stale dark brewed watered down old coffee acrid bitterness that doesn't really blend too well. They went for Guinness with a Bud Light mouthfeel, using Coors Light cold brewed ad campaigns. Pretty sad comparing this to Guinness pulled from a nitro tap, flavor was downright disappointing and I'm sure beer people and mainstream drinkers think this is pretty piss poor as a whole.

There's a faint and I mean faint aroma of roasted grains, but I would imagine most of the color from this thing came from sinamar.

Even though this isn't a bad beer it is very middle of the road. Nothing really bold or innovative and frankly the way it's marketed hurts me deeply. Guinness has been around forever and has some great brand loyalty. I don't see why they had to get all gimmicky with their labeling or even why they needed to step into the lager market. They even went as far as to imply Arthur Guinness who died in 1803 signed the description on the back of the bottle. This beer is worth a try but blackens the eye of the brand.
