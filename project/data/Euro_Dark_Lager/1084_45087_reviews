"I would love to try beers from 100 countries, but until we start getting better imports, such as some foreign craft beers that I have read about, I will have to endure a lot of mediocre/poor brew to reach my goal."

"This beer could be dangerous. It is easy to drink, and if served by the pint or by the pitcher, I could see, with a few slices of pizza, of downing a gallon of this stuff. It might not be delicious, but it sure is easy to drink. Cheers!"

"Overall, a really unbalanced beer. Loads of malts and caramel with little else. Add in the watered down mouthfeel, and this beer doesn't have a lot going for it. But, it's interesting to try beer from unassuming countries such as Greece."
"Overall I couldn't bring myself to call it average but I also couldn't really rate it as good as a 4. It feels like as you're drinking it you almost feel a potential that it just doesn't live up to."

"Tastes better than I expected. It isn't as sweet as the smell suggests. There's also enough hop to give some good balance. Body is okay and the carbonation is slightly understated. Pretty much tastes like a sweet American amber."
"I poured this really average beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a reddish color and poured a tan head head. The beer was a bready tasting affair and really had nothing exceptional, but then it really was not terrible either. Regardless it just did not stand out enough warrant buying again."
"11.2 ounce bottle, best before end of 03/2012. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear reddish/copper color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is bready and caramel malt, toffee, and some honey. The brew tastes like bready malt, toffee, and some bitter grassy hops. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. It's also smooth and easy enough to drink. Overall I think this is an OK brew and worth trying."
"O - This is an okay dark lager. It was better than their regular lager."
"Had this with my excellent Gyro at Lefteris Restaurant in Tarrytown NY, about an hour before I saw Los Lonely Boys ROCK the Music Hall...and what a pleasant surprise! I expected an adjunct, but this beer was quite good. Poured a nice copper, with about a finger of head and some nice lacing. Malty smell with just a hint of hop. Slightly sweet with a caramel overtone. Good carbonation which cut through the strong lamb flavors I was eating. Very drinkable and a great compliment to the Greek food. I eat at Lefteris when I can, so I'll be ordering this up again."
"Good beer that is very drinkable"
"O- Overall, this beer is nothing spectacular, but certainly not the worst ive had. Definitely a good middle of the road euro lager, and certainly worth a shot. Would have again. Solid 1 thumb up."
"Not a bad beer at all"
"My only question is: What is glucose syrup doing in my beer?"
"This beer has a dark, brassy color and good stickage on the glass. It has a bready aroma with some sweetness, and hints of cooked veggies and herbal hops. It's very smooth, with some body. Its maltiness and bready, caramel un- dertones all go dry with a pulling graininess. The hops are modest with a kiss of bitterness and some vague flavor in the end. Dried hay and a bit of dry biscuit finish things off. This beer settles in to be a decent Amber Lager. We were asked to pair it with a burger as well, and we agreed."
"For some reason I thought this beer would be bad. It's not."
"Mythos is most likely a Irish-style beer that has been lagered instead of treated like estery Irish ales. This gives a very clean and smooth flavor and feel to the malty-sweet beer. And with just enough malt complexity, the beer doesn't need much else."
"D: Goes down easily, not filling, the sweetness in the finish detracts slightly. Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"D- easily could knock back a few, but it isn't my favorite."
"More of a caramel sweetness in the taste, nutty, and slightly sharp and metallic, but not to an unbearable extent. Not as bad as I expected, I wouldn't buy it, but it has to be better than their green bottle helles lager."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer that is worth drinking for an entire evening."
"Prolly the best quality/price ratio of any beer you can get here."
"D: Being in Greece this would be my choice if one prefers local products. Might change my review in case chemicals are added."
"The beer is thin and watery actually and a bit of a let down after the intial smells and first couple of sips. What I thought and hoped I'd found wasn't up to stratch in the end, a pity."
