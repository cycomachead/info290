After having their extra strong lager, i thought this would be interesting, but i was sorrily mistaken. Poured out of the 500ml can into a pint glass, it looks real nice. Nice copper color with a nice 2 inch fluffy off white head. I had high hopes at this point. I took a nice big whiff of the smell of the beer, and man did it smell bad. Skunky, metallic (even when poured out of the can) wet hay smell. Brutal. After the first sip i was so repulsed by this, that I almost poured it out. It has a watered down, malty taste with little hops with a metallic twang, just like the extra strong lager, i think that's the trademark taste for this brewery. Just bad. Thin and watery mouthfeel, very light. This is insanely hard to drink, even when cold. I was barely able to choke down the whole thing. Avoid.","steeler","Jul 15, 2008"

This one poured a clear light brown with lots of carbonation, a fairly thick head that dissipated moderately slow to a good lacing then nothing. There was almost no scent I only detected a tiny bit of malt. Faintly hoppy and malty definitely watery with no strong taste, the feel of this one is clean but thin and watery.

Hard to smell much of anything in this beer but there were some nondescript malt and hop aromas. Taste was understated as well. A bit of bread malt and mild hop bitterness almost convinced me that this was beer, but not quite. Pretty bland for sure, certainly nothing objectionable or difficult to swallow about this beer, just not that much in its favor either.","kwakwhore","0"
2.13,-23.9,4.5,1.5,2,2,2.5,"I tried this beer on July 25, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO store.

3.42,22.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Faxe Amber pours a crystal clear deep amber body beneath a short head of off-white. The head retention is fair and the lacing is limited. The nose offers a light bit of grainy malt and some very mild grassy hops. It's crisp across the palate with a medium-light body and gently effervescent, fine-bubbled carbonation. The suggestion of caramel malts appears in the flavor, but they're not distinct. Some hops do appear however, herbal and spicy against the delicately grainy malt. A bold bitterness backs it, and it finishes dry and refreshing. Overall, very basic but well made.","NeroFiddled","Oct 01, 2006"
2.5,-10.7,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"500ml Can: Poured a clear and light amber color beer with a big white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of nutty malt is the only noticeable thing. Taste of lightly sweet nutty malt with a clear finish which very little or no hops included in this beer. Overall, this is a bland and boring but refreshing Vienna.","Phyl21ca","Sep 03, 2006"
3.13,11.8,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"At one liter, this was hands down the biggest beer can Ive every had. The brew pours a light and clear amber, with a soapy head. The aroma is primarily caramel and malt, with very little hop presence. The taste is a little hollow, with a touch of sweetness in the foretaste. Theres a little caramel and toastiness, but their qualities are restrained to the point of disinterest. Its a light and almost watery brew, with very little to make you pay attention. The finish has just enough hops to provide a little balance, and the brew could stand to have a lot more bitterness. Fairly low carbonation makes this one very easy to quaff, its just not very flavorful. Not offensive, but certainly not exciting.","Suds","Aug 15, 2006"
3.2,14.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"A fairly drinkable brew, albeit lackluster and uneventful. Pours out to an amber orange color with a smaller head of white foam that dissipated after the first few sips. Medium low carbonation. Aromas of caramel malts and flowery flour notes. Some grain elements. Taste is medium to medium-light bodied and mild; grains, caramel malts, some sweet fruit skin notes. Somewhat dry on the palate, this could quench a thirst if one was so inclined. Mouthfeel was otherwise uneventful, with little carbonation making its way to the palate. Drinkability is average. Worth trying. I bet this is better on tap.","Frozensoul327","Aug 10, 2006"
2.72,-2.9,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"..probably the least objectionable of the FAXE dextrose extract lagers but this type of high gravity extract-brewed beer always tastes lifeless, stale and too sweet to me.

2.38,-15,3,2.5,2.5,2,2,"Canned sample. Light copper in colour with strong carbonation. Very sweet caramel malt aroma, along with a hit of sulfur.

2.85,1.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Pours an orangish pink under a slightly off-white one finger head that actually manages to linger fairly well and maintains a large collar and a few strands of lace. The nose is strong and sweet, mainly of plum or grape. The mouth is very light and quite prickly. The taste is a real let down, as there isn't much here at first. As it warms, it becomes harsher, with metallic hops coming on strong. The appearance and nose are misleading, as the brew is ultimately quite unsatisfying.","Globetrotter","Aug 20, 2005"
2.47,-11.8,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Colour is a clear, copper/amber. Head pours out about a 1/4 inch thick and disipated to nothing but a thin film. Weak smell. Mainly of malts, grass, herbs and grain husks. Though, what I do smell is nice, it needs more strength. Tastes like a decent beer that has been watered down. Definite bready malts, grains, grassy and herbal flavours with some hop bitterness, but it's too subdued. Mouthfeel is watery. Drinkable? Yeah, I guess. It's alright. Not bad, but subpar okay.","slitherySOB","Aug 06, 2005"
3.1,10.7,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a very clear amber/orange/brown, small white head forms, no lace. Smell is clean and malty, little bit of citrus hop aroma near the end.

2.83,1.1,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"500 ml can (same as pictured), best before date stamped on the bottom. Pours out a light brown / amber color. Nice white head right after the pour, then settled down to a thin cap covering that lasted the whole glass. Not alot of smell, some aroma of grass or grain and tiny bit of hops. Flavour has some sweetness in the middle and a very mild hoppy finish. Taste is OK, but if if you are expecting a full flavor, it will seem a touch watered down. Not alot of carbonation giving a smooth mouthfeel rather than a crisp tingle. An average amber ale, drinkable but nothing special. For the higher import price I will probably pass next time.","BigBry","Jun 10, 2004"

2.83,1.1,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Well who would have thought, I found a drinkable product from the Faxe brewery here. Came in a 500 ml burgundy coloured can, best before date stamped on the bottom--this appears to be some pretty fresh stuff. Pours out a light clear golden amber tone, nice frothy off-white head in the first minute or so. Smell contains grassy hops, a bit of metallic grain. Flavour is somewhat watered down, some sweetness at first but very subdued, carried over to a mild grainy middle, and ends on a mild hoppy note, with a faint astringent aftertaste, faintly herbal. Mouthfeel lacks carbonation but gets fuller as it passes along the palate, although even then the body is light. For a Faxe beer this is actually drinkable, I'm impressed that I don't have to pour the rest of it out. But in comparison to everything else sitting around it on the shelf of your beer haunt of choice/necessity it's pretty much a pass. A very one-dimensional amber lager at best.","IronDjinn","Jan 25, 2004"
