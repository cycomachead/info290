Well, except for the two-plus fingers of dense deep-tan head that seemed determined to hang around. Color was a deep brown with garnet highlights and good clarity for the shade. Nose gave an initial hit of molasses and I wondered how that would translate in terms of taste. Only one way I know of to find out ... Mouthfeel was medium, at best, and the taste was somewhat medicinal, like cough syrup when I was a kid, but not necessarily in a bad way. I was still getting the molasses vibe and as long as you are okay with that flavor profile, it was a drinkable beer. Finish exuded a light tartness to go with the light astringency. Not bad, not great, but definitely interesting. Perhaps if a style descriptor is ever written, I can revise my scores as needed.","woodychandler","Mar 15, 2012"

There's a hint of smoke, but the darker, more foreboding style of smoke, rather than the peated variety commonly found in rauchs and schwarzes. There is also a slight, inexplicable sourness hanging in the background like a traitor of old. The taste follows the nose, with more must and more sourness, with the malts thrust into the background with some force. This is unfortunately the extent of the complexity here. Luckily, it has a very light body and does not coat the mouth, allowing the strange sour must to leave rather quickly. I'm not impressed here.","TMoney2591","Dec 20, 2009"

Smell was like most any other lager with a tiny bit of toasted malt way down inside. You really have to be looking for it. Mouthfeel is pretty average being neither unpleasant nor note worthy. The taste, though, really caught me off guard. This actually had a fair hop bitterness to it and a lovely, dry, dark malt flavour on the finish. Nice indeed. Still not an amazing beer, but somewhat better than I was anticipating.","SilentSabre","Nov 09, 2007"

Smooth sweet tone with a minor earthy edge (that is kind of like dirtier water). Feel is kind of thin on liquid with a decent carbonation. Easy to drink, but not as smooth as you'd want really.

Who would have thought that? Not me. Even though I thought this beer was kind of interesting I dont really think Id go back to it. It was worth trying once. I purchased my bottle in Council Bluffs, IA as part of a mix six-pack.","bditty187","Beers"
2.86,-7.1,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Efes Dark isn't one of the more stellar members of a style that struggles to be relevant in my eyes. It's a more faithful version of its style than its German pilsener wannabe brother, but that's about as much praise as I can muster.","BuckeyeNation","0"
3.06,-0.6,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Upon decanting into the glass, the beer released an exremely Peppy-le-pue aroma tha that detered me instantly. Just because you brew a Euro-Lager doesn't give permission to release a brew that smells badly. Nevertheless, after time, the beer does out-gass and reveals a, much improved, ordinary beer. A mildly toasty brew that houses a very Amber Bock-ish flavor, falls short of the beer that I wanted it to be. Moderate in every sense at the textrue though nothing obtrusive. Finishes short of clean or crisp. Just not the ideal brew...a simple attempt at a German Dunkel that needs help.","BEERchitect","Jun 12, 2006"
3,-2.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a medium brown color with a thick tan head and spotty lacing. Nose is of sweet malts and some fruity, yeasty characteristics. Palate is a smooth, moderately sweet malty dominance with only a faint hop balance. Finish is surprisingly dry. Body is light-medium and has moderate carbonation. I find this beer easy to drink, but a bit unmemorable. Wouldn't go out of my way for it, but wouldn't turn it down if offered either ... it's okay.","beerphilosopher","May 23, 2006"

3.07,-0.3,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"The brew has a rich, dark color a bit like dark chocolate and lots of visible carbonation. A decent head dissipated quickly. The aroma is malty and a bit floral. I cant say much for the taste; the malty sweetness hits immediatly, followed by the bitterness of hops. It could use a lot more complexity, balance, and flavor besides simple sweet and bitter, and it feels rather thin in the mouth. I wouldnt necessarily say I like it better than Efes Pilsener, which I think is an honest Pils. I freqently find that baseline indigenous beers like this one find their place mated with regional food (like Indian lagers with spicy curries), so I drank the Efes Dark with a selection of Turkish vegetable appetizers and flat bread (again from the Turkish store, natch). The pairing didnt yield the greatest results, but perhaps one would have better luck drinking it with something more meat-based like a good spicy kebab. To anyone who would choose to go this route, I would only say: Afiyet olsun!","Gattopardo","Feb 02, 2006"
3.5,13.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a brown color, but looks watery, as I can see through it. Not much head, poor retention, no lacing. The aroma is fairly malty with some caramel and hints of spicy hops. The flavor is quite smooth and there is quite a bit of caramel malt present. The finish is fairly bitter. The body is light and the drinkability is good. Fairly light, but there's really nothing special here.","clvand0","Jan 28, 2006"

4.07,32.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The nose offers a welcoming combination of caramel-soaked malt and floral hops. Once its smooth, medium body has crossed the lips, its lightly fruity and superbly caramelish, cocoa-ish, and lightly cola-like flavor appears and widens as it warms. A firm bitterness becomes apparent, and its floral and spicy hop flavors appear in the finish along with some lingering, residual bittersweet chocolate. As you progress through the glass, its alcohol starts to show, but it never becomes more than an attractive, additional asset to the beer. It's not real complex, or even that rich, but it is a very nicely done dark beer with an interesting maltiness. Kudos!","NeroFiddled","Apr 02, 2005"
3.63,17.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a sweet, malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted barley. It has a dry, fruity lager yeast aroma as well. The taste is decent as well. It has a thick and rich malty flavor that goes down smooth and finishes sweet and dry. This is a pretty good brew, but it's a little too syrupy. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking brew despite the fact that it leaves a lot of residual sweetness in the finish.","WesWes","Jan 31, 2005"
4.02,30.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This was my first brew from Turkey. Very nice one at that. I was expecting something skunky and wimpy. Instead, I got a nice dark lager, with a dark malty backbone. Had a nice amount of alcohol in the brew, but was hardly detectable. A bit chocolatey up front and clean afterwards. Very nice brew, it's dark and it's light. What more could you want? I can't think of any.","JISurfer","Jan 30, 2005"

Not too sure it's been off the shelf, but it did not taste fresh. it did pour a great head and nice lacing with decent carbonation. No accents of caramel or chocolate that is mentioned with the accompanied newsletter. A bit on the hoppy side. Served at a nice temperature and the alcohol is slightly noticeable. Cool to try a Turkish beer.","Backer2004","Nov 01, 2004"
3.08,0,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours a very dark and somewhat clear brown with chestnut highlights. Small fragile white head which quickly resolves into an insignificant film and slight lace. Smells quite sweet; predominantly grainy and bready, with toasted malts in the background and light hop aromatics. Very weak initial flavor, but develops some roasted bitter coffee malts with a nice sharp and drying hop finish. Light and well-carbonated in the mouth. Clean and easy to drink. Not bad, but not particularly inspiring.","dgallina","Aug 28, 2004"

Sweet smell. Malt, caramel, sugar and butter. Kind of a bland taste. The butter seems dominant. Which is too bad, as I was hoping for something with a bigger malt backbone. Bit if a cloying sweetness, like candied sugar or... Lollipops? Bit of a sticky, syrupy mouthfeel.

No bite, though. The aftertaste is sweet. This is the best beer I've had today, but I'm not having a good day...","Globetrotter","0"
