"O: not very complex, but what's there is enjoyable;"

"The medium body focuses on crispness, and leans pretty light. Toasty dryness builds gently."

"Yes, the legendary woodychandler comes through again with another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is nutty, a bit of hops. Taste is well balanced hops and malts, a bit of nuts, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
"A nice, loud Crack! revealed a brimful CAN, so in salute to the brewers, I utilized an inverted Glug. The pseudo-cascade was brilliant, finally settling into two fingers of dense, foamy, light-tan with limited retention, although it was already beginning to evince some great lacing. Color was more coppery than brown (SRM = ~ 22), but with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a really malty sweetness and I would have sworn that I was drinking an ale! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the taste was kind of chocolaty, sort of nutty and VERY reminiscent of Newcastle Brown Ale. Did I just type that? Well, I kid you not and if this is a lager, then I am deeply impressed! The hops were not what the verbiage had led me to expect as they were pretty much not discernible but the finish had the same sweet malt flavors that I usually get in an ale. This would be worth seeking out as a novelty, but if you are into Brown Ales (I am not), then you should definitely see how this stacks up against some of your faves."

"Poured to a great, off white head, with great creaminess and excellent retention and lacing. Appearance was a clear, dark copper color. Aroma was of malt and caramel with some fruit notes. Tasted very malty with strong notes of chocolate, caramel and toffee. Nice creamy mouth feel with a sweet to dry aftertaste, slight bite at the end."

"The flavor reminded me of a lager version of Sam Smith’s Brown Ale. It has good malt balance, a wonderful hop bitterness. It’s a wonderful beer to drink and I would argue possibly better than Brooklyn Lager."

"o - Overall a pretty nice brown ale. Lots of malts and easy to drink, definitely on the fruitier side of brown ales. Worth checking out."

"On the palate there is a very pleasant bready nuttiness but a snap that keeps it from being heavy. Very mild bitterness. Smooth and drinkable, shows excellent balance. Well made, I am hoping to try more from this local brewery."

"First sip is nicely malty, with a faint hint of fruity flavor from the yeast. Malt dominates, and the beer finishes clean with no harsh flavors. Overall a vey nice beer, I would certainly get this again."
"O – Delicious when fresh. Note: I’ve had this a second time where the keg was past-prime, and unfortunately the beer doesn’t hold up to age at all."
"Mouthfeel is light, smooth and almost slick, with almost no carbonation, a medium and flow that's smooth and watery. A really nice brown lager that's highly drinkable and easy to put down; light enough and tasty enough to be a session beer if this taste suits you."
"Kelso Nut Brown Lager looks darker than your usual lager, it fills the pint glass with a glossy shoe polish brown color with not much of a cap up top, no stickage. Smell is rather fruity with some nutty appeal and a apparent roast going on. Taste is pleasant enough for the style, I do get some dark fruit and I don't know why. Feel is medium and a bit watery, the lack of carb detrs me from drinking alot of it."
"D: The beer goes down very easily and I wouldn't have a problem drinking this all night long. In this respect, it's very sessionable."
"Pours slightly murky/hazed auburn amber. Lite tan head, tiny bubble film and extensive fine sheeting and scattered lacing. Malted up nose, toffee and minor vanilla. Easy drinking sessioner. Nicely malted up, with more toffee, def. nutty, mild hops late adding the balance. Smooth and enjoyable."
"Had a pint at Sweet Afton for $6. I tried this once before and I feel about the same - this is a great sessionable lager. The flavor is a touch light, but there are sharp toffee notes, a smoother nutty taste and then a mild caramel background. I'd be happy to have a few pints of this lager any time. Check it out next time you're in the city."
"Poured nicely into a shaker pint, with a frothy cascading head that dissipated to a thin lingering film on top of a brown hazy, unfiltered looking body. Smells very doughy, yeasty, malty. Taste is great with a very strong malt profile a good yeast taste and a very slight hop-bitterness in the back. Velvety texture, medium-full body and light carbonation make this a great pleasure to drink. My first beer from Kelso, and certainly not my last."
"Nothing too exceptional about it. The taste was very thin to me. Some malt up front and then nothing. I don't know much about the dark lager style, and my palate might be more accustomed to ales recently. Drinks really easily, though, with the right amount of carbonation and mouthfeel to take down four or five without much trouble, if that's what you're looking for."
"Good balance between hops and sweet. Verging on a brown ale, though; there are better examples of the style."
"Overall, nice to try this out, but not the greatest example of the style. Not sure how this is a Euro Dark Lager IMO; anyway, decent brew."
"Slight bitterness, great, robust flavor, carbonated with malt in the back of the throat."
"D--Very high, especially given the ABV. Packed with flavor for a session beer. An interesting, good, if not great, beer. I'd call it a hang-your-hat-on kind of beer."
"One growler down before the third string quarterback got thrown to the dogs. I'd call that drinkable. :)"
"It's pretty nice to be able to take this one home."
"Medium body, but a crisp finish for the lager style (it's something they do with the hops), it's very drinkable. One of my standard choices at local bars."
"Found on Tap at 67Buger in Fort Green, Brooklyn. Pours a nice chocolate, copper color with about one finger worth of fluffy white head. Smells of toasty malt and subtle hops. Taste is a strong caramel malt and brown sugar up front followed by a nice solid hop flavor and bitterness. Nice toasted barley character in there too. Mouthfeel is a bit off. Its nice at first, but then thins out in the middle of the sip and then picks up again at the back of the palate. Not bad. It went great with my blue cheese and bacon burger and sweet potato fries. Very drinkable to boot with enough flavor and character to keep me interested."
"Poured out a dark copper brown color, with a big uneven off white head, nice lacing. The nose offered a good malty spine surrounded by mild spice, and a hint of wood. The taste countered with some hop action, but balanced nicely by the sweet malt. Mild spicing adds good character to the beer. Crisp mouthfeel and a clean finish, this beer has sessioning written all over it."
"Overall a nice drinkable lager. Certainly a solid session beer."
