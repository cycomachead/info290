"Paddy's Irish Red pours a slightly hazy orange amber with a thin, bubbly head. The aroma is malty, with hints of caramel and nome nice herbal hops. The flavor is really nice, a well balanced blend of mildly sweet malt and a nice firm but not overpower hop character. There is a nice toffee undertone, with a hint of nutty chocolate."
"O - Based on the style, it actually is quite fitting offering up tea-like hop notes and a super dry finish. That being said, the metallic notes were a bit of a turn-off, and the mouthfeel made for a less than pleasurable experience."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with bland flavors and aromas."

"It's drinkable, but a very underwhelming example of the style and I can't envision myself ever recommending this to someone, or buying it again. If you must drink one of Trafalgar's IRAs, their Elora Irish Ale is closer to the style and at least marginally better. Honestly though, I like Smithwick's more than either of them... and that should tell you all you need to know."
"Trafalgar's slogan is: ""We only sell what we can't drink ourselves!"". There's a reason you can find so much of their brands on the shelves here in Ontario - obviously even they don't want to drink the stuff themselves. Certainly no one else will want to take it. While Paddy's may be one of their more agreeable offerings - in that it's not infected and reasonably drinkable - it's still strives to be nothing more than an average beer."
"Too dirty smelling and tasting to have more than one or two (ever) unless it was all that I had."
"Can: Poured a clear medium amber color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry unrefined grain is somewhat bland. Taste is also dominated by dry unrefined cereal taste with no discernible hops and not that great of a drinkability factor. Very bland average for style and though there is no brewing flaws there is nothing too spectacular to speak of."
"D: Drinks reasonably easy I suppose, if you don't mind the bitterness."
"Scored from north of the border, let's give it a whirl. Nice foamup on popping the tall boy. Poured into a pint (american 16oz) glass, it is red but also gold, nice foamy head. Smells kind of adjunct. Taste is very different. Balanced but from both ends. Very sweet malts then offset with peppery sharply bitter, but not overly so, hoppiness. Nice mouthfeel, carbonation is there but not over evident. In the aftertaste the bitterness continues and fades to a dry finish. Good head, holds up throughout the pint. A good pint overall the noble hops add a nice touch."
"Final Thoughts: After having this beer, my thoughts suddenly turn to the Simpsons and that episode where Homer has Red Tick Beer, not sure why but I think the Red Dog on the can might have done it. Anyways, I will give this to Trafalgar, they are consistent. When I need to tell someone a brewery to stay away from, they are at the top of my list. I know they sell mead, in addition to beer and maybe it's a bit better, however this offering was disappointing, which sadly seems par for the course for this brewery. I can't also help but ask, why brew this? Their Elora Irish Red is quite a bit better then this, so why brew this stuff?"
"Overall, a watery, bland and lackluster Irish Red. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but there just is some flavor that is missing here. The flavors are not bad, just not alway there. Just lackluster all around."
"Aside from the disastrous nose, this brew wasn't too bad. I'll probably not get it again though, knowing how many other reds there are available to me, but it's drinkable."
"The appearance of this beer is a stunning dichotomy. It pours a nice rich head that is lacing heavily, yet it is much too light a beer to be described as 'Red', having had numerous pale ales redder than this. The nose is lightly hopped and malty sweet and enjoyable, but the body does not meet these very characteristics. It is a little bit bready and thin with a hint of bitterness. Isn't strong in the mouth, but is an easy drinking beer with a little bit of character."
"Too bad this beer doesn't hold up to Team Canada's play: 2-0 after two periods; but no extra points for this underwhelming Canadian suds offering."
"I had expected much worse. I'm not sure if I could call this a ""red"" ale, but it's moderately tasty and pretty drinkable. Won't be buying it again but wouldn't turn one down. This could be a good gateway beer for people who drink macro stuff; it's a step up but nothing that would scare someone away."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Easy to drink and theres nothing really wrong with it besides being totally plain. Reminds me of Rickards Red."
"Taste is unbalanced too much sweetness for me. Also has a weird fruity tang. Not worth buying again."
"I thought I just got a bad bottle, But it doesn't seem anyone else's opinion of this brew is much different from my own. Unforunate, really."
"D - Not overly tasty, mild, sessionable drink. Light and refreshing if you like that sorta thing."
"Notes: Is this really a red? Seriously, I think Trafalgar can do better. Much better."
"This was another lackluster beer from this brewery. I get the impression that they are an all extract brewery, and that they have an irrational fear of hops. I agree with everyone else, stay away."
"Another ""red"" beer that isn't red and isn't worth buying again."
"The colour is sort of an orange/red, dark tea colour. No head whatsoever. No lacing whatsoever. Smells of caramel malts and used teabags. Taste is a bit sickly sweet, with a bit of a nutty character. Mouthfeel is light and dry. Rather bland. Would not drink it again. Am rather upset I'm left with five more bottles."
"D: A little more flavour than Richard's Red, but it should still be easily approachable to the average consumer. It is a little heavier & sweet though... a 650 mL bomber was enough for me."
"It wasnt a nice experience"
"Harsh, could not take more than a sip. Some malt, a tad roasted and oily, nothing else to balance. They could lose this one. Bottled version was better, carbonation from on-tap adds some temporary fizz, but otherwise no head. So see red colour, like a herbal tea."
"Mild, slightly sweet malt was all I got out of drinking this one. A hint of hops if you let it warm up long enough. No dimension to this beer."
"This beer poured a nice dark red color, which was good. Not much head. It also lacked some excitment in the smell. This lead to a kind of bland taste. Having spent some time in Ireland I have grown to love the Irish beers, especially the ales. I must say that this was a good attempt but it lacked some authenticity. I will drink it again though."
