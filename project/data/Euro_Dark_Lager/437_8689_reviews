"330ml bottle. Pokal glass. Dark brown color & brownish amber to the light. Yellowish froth, close & lasting crown, some rings are left. Noble hop aromas & slight chocolate hints on the back. Roasted & dried upfront. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Watery texture. Low floral bitterness in the middle lingers into a light spicy & bitter/sweet finish. Very easy drinkable beer."
"Shame on the people behind this. And selling three decilitres of this swill for 31 kroner per bottle! That's €3.75, people. Or $5.17. Or 3.08 pounds sterling."

"Tasted of mild, light caramel, with a hint of sweetness at the start. Also found a bit of roasty malt in there, and the finish displayed subtle hopping but a bit too much bitterness. Nothing to write home about, I'm afraid..."

"Beer really reminds me of dark toffee candy. Loaded! Anyway, poured at a good temperature wiht nice, medium sized, light tan head that soon settled and no lace. Color is a clear, tho almost opaque, dark ruby red. Aroma is super mild, only suggestions of roast and toffee. Flavor’s like nose. carbonic tang is in front followed by some toffee sweet with a little regular malt, caramel, hint of roast; bit shallow. Body and carbonation are ok. Finish is like flavor, good length, and good enough for a couple."

"This beer is black with brown highlights, and with a tight white head. The smell of this beer is excelent, smells like coffe flavored chocolate and caramel, but the taste is quite dissapointing, the carbonation hides most of it, i only got a little bit of caramel there. The mouthfeel has that crispy and dry lager feeling, but yet it is creamy, and maybe a littlebit buttery from the fullness of the body. Even though I miss a littlebit more flavor, it's still a drinkable beer."
"Review from notes taken during tasting at Starapromen brewery restaurant in Prague"
"Good drinking , sessionable beer for the Porter crowd who don't want to over do it...4.4% alcohol with more than a ""nut brown," less that, ""chocolate," flavours/structure."
"D: Fine. It's too bad it's more superficial characteristcs outshine the tasting experience."
"D Not very good. 2 "
"A nice dark lager that has a little of lot of things."
"Overall: a very reasonable, sessionable beer with a nice taste and huge drinkability."
"D: Will not drink this again, unless rvdoorn imports another bottle."
"Overall: My favorite Euro Dark Lager until now. Amazing how complex and full of taste such a 4.4% beer can be. Very easy to drink and highly recommendable for the style!"
"Overall, good dark beer, as it could be expected from Staropramen."
"Im not a big fan of czech lager beers, but they know how to make dark lagers. This one is good stuff. Not exceptional in any way, but solid."
"Pours a one finger cream head that fades quickly, leaving some lace. Clear deep mahogany color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Coffee bean nose. Flavor is roasted coffee some sweetness. 330ml bottle 5.80 Schönes Fräulein Restaurant Helsinki, Finland. From my notes - 7/8/2008."
"Bought this 0.5L bottle in Prague while visiting and drank it back at home in Ireland. Pours a rich dark amber with a 1.5 finger head that had a bit of yellowish to it but was basically white and it disappeared slowly into a decent lace that stuck around throughout the drink. The smell was great malty hints and some light floral & fruity hints. The taste is exactly what you would expect from the smell and was very smooth going down with more and more light fruity sugary notes coming through as it warmed up. Not a strong or harsh beer that went down great and something I could drink all day long-wish it was more available."
"This one was served cold, but others were cellar temp and a bit better in the flavor."
"One of the best Darks from the Czech Republic. Recommended!"
"A quite nice dark lager."
"this is hardly going to be a contender for the 'greatest dark beer award', however the brew has it's merrits and although the first feel was a bit odd, I actually began to enjoy it more sip by sip"
"purdy; porter-looking. big head that leaves lacing and sports the wee white circles on top. nose of dark munich malts with some toffee/caramel. not much hop presence, lager smooth with little lingering flavor (though some hop/grain bitterness does stick around)"
"A great example of the style, does exactly what its supposed to"
"It pours black with ruby/garnett throughout. The light tan head is okay, but the beer is clear and has a beautiful color. The aroma has some coffee, caramel, cherry, and some malt. The taste is somewhat sweet with some roasty character, toffee, and anise spice. A clean finish for this good beer."
"This Staropramen pours a dark brown colour with a tan head that disappears quickly, leaving a thin lace. It has a big roasted smell with some hint of chocolate and some caramel. The taste is a bit roasted with some hint of chocolate, coffee and caramel. The mouthfeel is a bit weak, but this is a lager."
"There are much better czech dark lagers. This is too sweet, and the grape and caramel flavors don't mesh well."
"(330 ml bottle). This beer has a beautiful ruby colour, and pours with a moderate head. Aroma is malty sweet with hints of oak. Flavour is mellow, just a tad too sweet in my book. Low bitterness. This is not a bad beer, but it lacks ""bite""."
"Pours a healthy clear reddish amber, much like a cola, but with almost no head whatsoever (also like a cola). The nose was mildly caramel (kind of like a cola...), while the mouth was prickly sweet, well, um, kind of like a cola. Doesn't taste like a cola, however. There's a touch of sour (too close to the best before date?) to go with the caramel sweetness. There's not much hop follow through at all, leaving a - ahem - cola-like sweet aftertaste. Nope, there are much better dark Czech lagers..."
"Was in Czech republic and tried this one.. Awesome stuff for being a dark lager! Deep ruby red clear with small short lasting light beige head. Very faint roasted malt and caramel aroma. Medium thin body. Clean dry pleasant palate. Medium bitter-sweet roasted malt flavour with hints of coffee/toffee and a wonderful dry clean finish. Super nice beer when fresh!!!!!!"
"Super rich, dark amber with a huge, frothy, foamy head thats 2 inches and sticks around. Settles, leaving patchy, tight, webby lace. Smell is very deeply roasted malt with a bit of liquorish and some floral hop notes, somewhat soft. Taste is about the same as the smell, very soft, subtle, and smooth with good deeply flavored maltiness, slightly earthy. Theres some very subtle hints of liquorish, dry hops, and maybe even some rye. Its a bit on the light side in the flavor and feel though. All in all, this is a pretty decent dark lager. When drinking it, it took me back into what it must of been like drinking beer back in the good Ol' days of Czech, Poland, Hungary, Austria, before the turn of the century."
"The first thing that meet you is a big smell of raisins, which combines together with a slight touch of coffee. The taste isn't so big unfortunately, it's fruity and reminds a bit of porters. It's semi-sweet and not bitter at all, quite easy to drink. Overall I can't say I'm disappointed because I didn't expect much at all, but it's definately worth trying out. :)"
