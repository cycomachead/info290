review_text
"Reading the review of others, I was surprised that no one called out the distinct molasses aroma. My glass has been empty for quite a while and I can still detect it. Also, it seems that the ratings are low because the reviewers expected this beer to be something it is not. It is actually a fine representation of a dark, malty lager. This is a very enjoyable beverage. Give this beer a try, ignoring the pseudo-intellectual critics who have complained."
"Pours a caramelly-cola color. Malty-sweet smell, with a off-putting “musty car” note. Cloying and syrupy."

"Wholly uninteresting, but still, it tastes alright and is unoffensive, which is about all you can hope for with these Euro lagers."
"The peak of pilsener brewery, the caramel content gives a distinct flavor and feel to this high alcohol beer."

"O: This is a pretty forgettable beer. That being said, the Euro Dark Lager style does not lend itself to greatness."

"An okay Euro dark lager. Not much to write home about, but not exactly offensive, either, though it could possibly be improved upon if fresher, I suppose. At least I’ve had another beer from an Islamic nation, which is something of a rarity."
"Overall: Good brew, especially if you are looking to try offerings from around the globe. Put this Turkish beer on your list."
"Not a bad Turkish offering, to be honest this is just about as good as I've tried from the country with only the odd exception. Definitely drinkable and easy going; it's one worth picking up if you're in the country but probably not if you mange to find it elsewhere."

"OVERALL: This Turkish whale definitely lives up the the (lack of) hype. A solid dark lager for sure. People will give it a rough time as this style is not as well appreciated as others, but it's definitely a good example of the style, and something I would have appreciated seeing more often, or at least 'at all,' while I was in Turkey. Thanks for sending your sketchy buddy to do all the dirty work on this one Doops. Well worth it!"
"O: Looking past the aging effects I see a solid dunkel worth revisiting."

"Efes could have been on the verge of being a surprise if it were in prime condition. Clear glass is usually not a beer's friend, more so in the sunny climate of Turkey."

"appears very dark brown, red highlights, thin off-white head, good head retention. malty aroma, no hops. fairly sweet taste, smooth, easy drinking. mild. lingering aftertaste. thin to medium body, medium carbonation. overall - not bad, it has a good mild flavor and high drinkability."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and a brewed tea aroma. Taste is mainly of toasted bread and slightly burnt caramel. There is a very mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is decently drinkable but nothing too exciting."

"mouthfull is heavy, and it fills your whole mouth giving you a dry taste, however i liked it in this one because it wasn't very sour."
"Smells and tastes partially skunky, but there is some mild toasted bread in there in the background of the flavor and some mild floral hopping in the aroma. And that's it. A simple beer with not much going for it other than the very basics. Overall it's not very good, but not quite bad enough for me to call it terrible. It is, however, completely forgettable and most certainly not good enough to actually seek out."
""
"Some character through the burned notes."
"Overall: Efes Dark is certainly drinkable and better than some other dark lagers I have had, but I think I prefer their standard pilsner."

"O: This beer is rather easy to drink and has a nice amount of flavors."
"O: The flavor of this beer almost reminds me of an English mild but a little sweeter. This beer is enjoyable and easy to drink, might be a little too high ABV to be sessionable but definitely one I would have again."

"This really looked like cola as it was being decanted from the bottle into a glass! Well, except for the two-plus fingers of dense deep-tan head that seemed determined to hang around. Color was a deep brown with garnet highlights and good clarity for the shade. Nose gave an initial hit of molasses and I wondered how that would translate in terms of taste. Only one way I know of to find out ... Mouthfeel was medium, at best, and the taste was somewhat medicinal, like cough syrup when I was a kid, but not necessarily in a bad way. I was still getting the molasses vibe and as long as you are okay with that flavor profile, it was a drinkable beer. Finish exuded a light tartness to go with the light astringency. Not bad, not great, but definitely interesting. Perhaps if a style descriptor is ever written, I can revise my scores as needed."
"Now that this is available in BC in a can ,I gave it a try. Not a bad dark lager with a nice caramel note to the finish on par with many of the Euro dark lagers. I like the full mouthfeel and the slightly nutty nose. It is also very food friendly which makes it a good BBQ beer. I will be picking up some cans of this for the Summer as it is hard to find decent darker lagers in cans."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, toffee. Taste is good, malts, smoke, some caramel, a touch of sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and enjoyable beer."

"Overall: I don't know why this beer doesn't get more love. I'm finding it very satisfying and tasty."
"O- It's a bit better than your average Euro Dark Lager. Not overwhelmingly so, but only a bit so. Worth a try, but maybe not worth the price."
"Overall, this is a bit of a mixed bag. I'm personally not too into it, but I see how some people might be."
"If there was something missing I would say that with its slightly elevated alcohol content there is not any extra alcohol flavor, which I think would be a plus."
"No need to hunt this one down. Efes's pilsener is better."
"O - Pretty good for what it is, would have never guessed the 6.1% abv. Overall a smooth dark beer that has good drinkability."
"Clear (!) bottle. Pours dark reddish- brown with a short lived, off-white head. Nose is grassy hops, hints of toffee and cherry. Medium, slightly crisp body. Caramel malt, toffee balanced on the palate by grassy hops, some hints of raisins and mineral water. Medium, semisweet finish. Pleasant, drinkable brew."
"Had a can of this beer that I shared with others at a beer tasting. I borought this back from Turkey. The can is quite cool...black with a red panther. The appearance was a darker amber, almost a caramel color. Decent carbonation lent to a nice head that did not lace. There really was nothing on the nose....perhaps some malt, but that was it. The taste did have some malt and sweetness to it, but mostly grain. This beer wasn't too bad, but I probably just pefer to drink the standard Efes."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the malt with some toffee and a little bit of grass from the hops. The flavor is equally malty. I get some cocoa and toasted malt, as well as some toffee and a little bit of grass. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad, but nothing special."
"not bad for the area, but nothing i would ever get out of the area."
"A surprisingly quaffable, if not particularly memorable strong-ish dark lager, reminiscent at times of a low-grade dunkel. On the sweet side overall, but balanced to the point where my palate essentially just doesn't give a flying fuck, despite what my brain is telling it."
"I went to restraint row in new York city and experienced Turkish food for the first time. When I asked for a Turkish beer they offered fees and fees dark. I went with the dark and I would compare it to new castle which I love. Unfortunately it was not as creamy and it was a hint skunky. I would like to give a fresh efes beer a try but the initial smell ruined my experience with this beer."
"Decent for the style, impressive for the Efes family, overall enjoyable but not noteworthy."
"Acceptable on the palate and drinkable enough if the flavor suits the drinker."
"This would easily wash down some fresh bread with figs and cheese, or sustain a long evening with some Turkish coffee at the end."
"D: Got this in the BotM shipment. Guess I enjoyed the other 2 because I had a few too many beers before...but this one isn't impressive at all after I sat down to review it."
"The first and worst beer I had on the hot holiday trip 2010."
"Overall - A respectable entry out of Turkey, but nothing I'd go out of the way for."
"I really didn't like this beer and probably was generous on the ratings. If this is Turkey's best, I hope they have a good beer import."
"Overall, a weak lager that just didn't have many redeeming qualities. Standard bland macro. Not available here in TX (though we do get the Efes Pilsener which I have at Cafe Istanbul as it's best option there). Got in BOMC. Rotation - liked the Pilsener so wanted to try this one. It's on the menu there but they never have it and can't explain why on the menu. Glad I got to try it finally but one is enough. [N;N]"
"Comments: A beer of the month selection. Although I have traveled in Turkey, I cannot remember trying this beer in country. I would like to try this beer at its freshest moment."
"This is a very refreshing, tasty, and drinkable dark lager, as good as any other European dark lager I've tried."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking beer that has a good taste to it, thought the clear glass bottle puts one off the smell. For now."
"Efes beers are pretty much the only ones you can get in Turkey. Beer culture is obviously not a big component in this country, but this beer in particular makes Miller light seem drinkable. Quite simply even for its style profile, its boring, bland, under-carbonated, and doesn't feel right."
"Efes Dark is a very sparkling, solid dark reddish brown beer with a small, turbulent, khaki head. It has a skunky aroma... Yeah, it's just skunk here-- can't really pick up on anything else. It has a medium light body that's lively in the mouth with a rough finish. A poison chemical flavor overpowers everything. I'm pretty sure that's fusel. There is a faint sweetness and bitterness in there but I really have to pay attention to detect it. This gave me a headache. At least it looked nice. I'm going to chalk this up to a light-poisoned bottle."
"D - Could be better with some more carbonation. I would consider this great tho"
"It is ultra carbonated. The flavor is metallic and crappy. If Budweiser were dark."
"Like most EDLs, the color stands as a highly translucent dark amber-brown, with a minor white froth standing in for a beefier head. The smell here is very musty, with a strong malt character coming through, though drier than usual. There's a hint of smoke, but the darker, more foreboding style of smoke, rather than the peated variety commonly found in rauchs and schwarzes. There is also a slight, inexplicable sourness hanging in the background like a traitor of old. The taste follows the nose, with more must and more sourness, with the malts thrust into the background with some force. This is unfortunately the extent of the complexity here. Luckily, it has a very light body and does not coat the mouth, allowing the strange sour must to leave rather quickly. I'm not impressed here."
"This beer pours a brilliantly clear dark brown with a surprisingly large rocky head that fades rather quickly. The bubbles are tan and smallish. Aroma wise I get a faint graininess and stinky cabbage along with a touch of roast. The beer is thin and lifeless with a slight toasted note but it finishes very dry in the back of the palate, not a pleasing dry but borderline astringent. No hop aroma, flavor, and just the slightest hint of bittering. Not an appealing beer at all. I would not recommend it."
"I first had this beer in Turkey. Though I would revisit it. Well, I think it was better in Turkey, maybe it was more fresh. This pours dark but not not thick at all. Doesn't have much nose at all, maybe a hint of coffee. The taste is somewhat lacking but is pretty drinkable."
"Body was a bit lacking for a dark beer. Not a good effort, just a sweet and syrupy beverage that misses the mark."
"I guess I can say I've tried it but I won't be going back"
"don't go out of your way for this one"
"The mouthfeel is pretty light, zingy carbonation, very refreshing, so points for that. A nice Efes option for beer geeks in Turkey who want something maltier."
"D: Not bad. Lots of pretty good flavors, they don't seem to come together to create a good beer though."
"D: Not too bad; pretty good for the style."
"The aroma is sweet like maple syrup and brown sugar combined with some toasted gains throw in. The appearance is dark brown with a super small head. The flavor is like the aroma with medicinal, bitter, and cardboard elements. The palate is thin. Overall it's bad."
"After a while, the beer gets a bit generic, perhaps even a little sloppy, with a musty head and grainy body. Pours a solid brown with no special features. The mouthfeel is more comforting, with a little bit of spice and a little bit of cocoa and a whole lot more of porter feel than a typical knockoff dark. All in all, though, because of its crispness, it is quite refreshing and very drinkable."
"D - Pretty much average. Good? No. But it's not bad either. Bland I would call it."
"It is has mostly a lightly sweet, roasted toffee flavour with hints of herbs, prunes, and nuts in the finish. It's easy to drink, smooth, and has fairly firm character."
"Tastes of a generic dark beer. Lots of malts, good mix with spices. Smokey flavor with a lot of caramel mixed in. Reminded me of another beer that I had, couldnt put my finger on it. I would recommend it to try, I was happy with one. Wouldnt go as far as a six pack.."
"Not a bad beer to throw back. I do enjoy the Efes lager better."
"This was a different experience from a country I generally don't associate with beer, which is why I tried it. I like some of the ideas going into it, but the variety of components are a bit too much and it feels unbalanced and a bit unpleasant."
"This was pretty average all the way around, with hthe exception of taste. I was really surprised. Poured up a clear dark brown and almost looked like a furniture varnish. Smell was like most any other lager with a tiny bit of toasted malt way down inside. You really have to be looking for it. Mouthfeel is pretty average being neither unpleasant nor note worthy. The taste, though, really caught me off guard. This actually had a fair hop bitterness to it and a lovely, dry, dark malt flavour on the finish. Nice indeed. Still not an amazing beer, but somewhat better than I was anticipating."
"Pours dark with some light passing through. Nose is dirty. Seems almost rotten in a way. Flavor is pretty decent. Smooth sweet tone with a minor earthy edge (that is kind of like dirtier water). Feel is kind of thin on liquid with a decent carbonation. Easy to drink, but not as smooth as you'd want really. Nice to try. Nice to move on."
"D - very disappointing, their pilsner is quite nice, this is a let down"
"It's not bad. It's ok to drink, but it's pretty mediocre overall."
"Will have to tell the cashier Lady to keep stocking this one."
"Drinkability- Not bad. Not great."
"I found it surprisingly drinkable considering the sweetness, lack of carbonation, and the lack of balance. To me this is sort of a dessert lager. Who would have thought that? Not me. Even though I thought this beer was kind of interesting I dont really think Id go back to it. It was worth trying once. I purchased my bottle in Council Bluffs, IA as part of a mix six-pack."
"Efes Dark isn't one of the more stellar members of a style that struggles to be relevant in my eyes. It's a more faithful version of its style than its German pilsener wannabe brother, but that's about as much praise as I can muster."
"Upon decanting into the glass, the beer released an exremely Peppy-le-pue aroma tha that detered me instantly. Just because you brew a Euro-Lager doesn't give permission to release a brew that smells badly. Nevertheless, after time, the beer does out-gass and reveals a, much improved, ordinary beer. A mildly toasty brew that houses a very Amber Bock-ish flavor, falls short of the beer that I wanted it to be. Moderate in every sense at the textrue though nothing obtrusive. Finishes short of clean or crisp. Just not the ideal brew...a simple attempt at a German Dunkel that needs help."
"Pours a medium brown color with a thick tan head and spotty lacing. Nose is of sweet malts and some fruity, yeasty characteristics. Palate is a smooth, moderately sweet malty dominance with only a faint hop balance. Finish is surprisingly dry. Body is light-medium and has moderate carbonation. I find this beer easy to drink, but a bit unmemorable. Wouldn't go out of my way for it, but wouldn't turn it down if offered either ... it's okay."
"Not a bad try, but needs improvement."
"The brew has a rich, dark color a bit like dark chocolate and lots of visible carbonation. A decent head dissipated quickly. The aroma is malty and a bit floral. I cant say much for the taste; the malty sweetness hits immediatly, followed by the bitterness of hops. It could use a lot more complexity, balance, and flavor besides simple sweet and bitter, and it feels rather thin in the mouth. I wouldnt necessarily say I like it better than Efes Pilsener, which I think is an honest Pils. I freqently find that baseline indigenous beers like this one find their place mated with regional food (like Indian lagers with spicy curries), so I drank the Efes Dark with a selection of Turkish vegetable appetizers and flat bread (again from the Turkish store, natch). The pairing didnt yield the greatest results, but perhaps one would have better luck drinking it with something more meat-based like a good spicy kebab. To anyone who would choose to go this route, I would only say: Afiyet olsun!"
"Pours a brown color, but looks watery, as I can see through it. Not much head, poor retention, no lacing. The aroma is fairly malty with some caramel and hints of spicy hops. The flavor is quite smooth and there is quite a bit of caramel malt present. The finish is fairly bitter. The body is light and the drinkability is good. Fairly light, but there's really nothing special here."
"Opinion: I am pretty disappointed in this beer. The aroma was a lot more pleasant than the flavor. This dry grainy thing is really distracting. I don't think that the bitterness in the finish is made up as much of hops as it is from the base malts and the roast."
"pours a dark mohogany with a thin head that disapears into a few stray bubbles. the aroma is clean, a little sweet, hint ofchocolate. the flavor is prune, malty, chocolate, spicy, hint of hopsack, little peppery in the finish. the mouthfeel is a little thick, i did not like that, it had the consisticy of a big stout or barleywine. great beer for a cold night."
"(330ml / 11.6 oz bottle)"
"Selection of beer of the month club. poured a deep brown, reddish highlites noted, with foamy tannish head. Smell is of roasted malt and sweet caramel. taste is smooth and a mixture of malt and caramel. Finishes with a dry coffee bitterness. a Decent brew."
"The nose offers a welcoming combination of caramel-soaked malt and floral hops. Once its smooth, medium body has crossed the lips, its lightly fruity and superbly caramelish, cocoa-ish, and lightly cola-like flavor appears and widens as it warms. A firm bitterness becomes apparent, and its floral and spicy hop flavors appear in the finish along with some lingering, residual bittersweet chocolate. As you progress through the glass, its alcohol starts to show, but it never becomes more than an attractive, additional asset to the beer. It's not real complex, or even that rich, but it is a very nicely done dark beer with an interesting maltiness. Kudos!"
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a sweet, malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted barley. It has a dry, fruity lager yeast aroma as well. The taste is decent as well. It has a thick and rich malty flavor that goes down smooth and finishes sweet and dry. This is a pretty good brew, but it's a little too syrupy. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking brew despite the fact that it leaves a lot of residual sweetness in the finish."
"This was my first brew from Turkey. Very nice one at that. I was expecting something skunky and wimpy. Instead, I got a nice dark lager, with a dark malty backbone. Had a nice amount of alcohol in the brew, but was hardly detectable. A bit chocolatey up front and clean afterwards. Very nice brew, it's dark and it's light. What more could you want? I can't think of any."
"Received this in my final selections from the Beer of the Month club. Not too sure it's been off the shelf, but it did not taste fresh. it did pour a great head and nice lacing with decent carbonation. No accents of caramel or chocolate that is mentioned with the accompanied newsletter. A bit on the hoppy side. Served at a nice temperature and the alcohol is slightly noticeable. Cool to try a Turkish beer."
"Pours a very dark and somewhat clear brown with chestnut highlights. Small fragile white head which quickly resolves into an insignificant film and slight lace. Smells quite sweet; predominantly grainy and bready, with toasted malts in the background and light hop aromatics. Very weak initial flavor, but develops some roasted bitter coffee malts with a nice sharp and drying hop finish. Light and well-carbonated in the mouth. Clean and easy to drink. Not bad, but not particularly inspiring."
"33 cl bottle, twist off. Dating of 12.03.05, brought back from Turkey."
"Pours with a three-finger light brown head that leaves some lace. Clear deep amber color. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Slightly malty nose. Starts sweet finishes mellow, not syrupy. Bought this for my 58th country and it isn't a bad dark. $1.75 for a 330ml bottle (mislabeled at 11.6oz) from Vintage Cellar, Blacksburg, Va."
"Opaque dark almost black color. The short head disappeared quickly. Some sweet dark malts in the smell. In the taste, dark orasted malts, almost caramelized. Slightly smoky caramel with some fruity notes of cherries, and a sweet aftertaste, almost like soda. Hops only add some thickness. The mouthfeel may be as bit light and watery. Still a decent beer."
"Ehh, not too bad. Poured kind of a caramel dyed with red food colouring. Reminded me of Werther's candy a little. Decent, 1 finger head that actually lasted, surprisingly. Sweet smell. Malt, caramel, sugar and butter. Kind of a bland taste. The butter seems dominant. Which is too bad, as I was hoping for something with a bigger malt backbone. Bit if a cloying sweetness, like candied sugar or... Lollipops? Bit of a sticky, syrupy mouthfeel. It's nothing to bitch about, but it certainly deserves no praise either."
"Despite it's heaviness, I could drink several. It's memorable, far better than the pilsener."
"Pours clear dark amber, almost caramel color under a thin off-white head that fades quickly to collar and film. No lace. The nose has a touch of caramel to it. The mouth is light and prickly. The taste is not unpleasant, but I expect more from a dark. There's some caramel and malty sweetness in the opening, and a very slight hint of hops in the finish. No bite, though. The aftertaste is sweet. This is the best beer I've had today, but I'm not having a good day..."
