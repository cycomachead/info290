3.96,13.5,3.75,4,4.25,3.25,3.75,"The Crack and inverted Glug threatened to overflow my Anderson Valley CANglass with its dense, two-plus fingers of dense, deep-tan head with good retention. It also created a nice pseudo-cascading action before I was forced to back off. Color was a deep, dark-brown with light penetration only at the edges. Nose was rich with a smoky, dark chocolate smell. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side for my taste, but oh!, what a taste! I described an earlier beer today as being like drinking a chocolate milk shake, but this was even closer to the taste than that one. Very chocolaty without being overly sweet, which is just the way that I like such things. Sweet really turns me off. Finish was semi-sweet and the chocolate flavors really lingered well after the swallow.","woodychandler","Jul 20, 2013"
3.24,-7.2,3.75,2.75,3.5,3,3.25,"Overall this is a nice ""euro dark lager"" whatever that means, reminds me of a less impressive Lion Stout, still enjoyable, Would recommend if you are facing this versus any mainstream Japanese pilsner-esque beers... Orion, Kirin, Asahi etc...","JoeAmerican77","Jul 06, 2013"

4.03,15.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Had this on tap at the Yebisu Museum in Ebisu, Tokyo. Poured into a half-pint glass. No transparency at all with a thick beige creamy head. Head is delicious and flavored like coffee. Roasted coffee dominates the scent as well. The taste is a bit watery but still palatable. Very bitter like iced coffee. Beautiful scattered ring lacing around the glass. Overall, a wonderful black lager especially if you are looking for a coffee-influenced taste.","shigg85","Apr 27, 2012"

3.58,2.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O: Again, if it comes down to either ordering the standard Asahi, Kirin, Sapporo golden lagers or this one, I`m choosing this all day long. Definitely not one that would be my beer of choice back in the states, but I applaud the effort by Sapporo to market a darker beer. Now, if only demand for this kind of product would increase so the other big brewers came out with similar products!","mdvatab","Dec 30, 2011"

3.42,-2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"O - Not a terrible example of the style. I think if you could get this on tap and it was just a little bit creamier it would be a damn fine beer. As it is, it's pleasant enough.","xylophonica","Jun 18, 2010"
3.83,9.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Easy drinker, good for a few. One of my first choices when I find it available while traveling in Japan.","soju6","Feb 06, 2010"

3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"M&D: the carbonation is kept at a ""healthy"" level, i.e. soft enough and not at all spritzy, while the body remains medium-minus to go well with the refreshing flavour profile. I find this beer more like a slightly more malty, heavier Schwarzbier, which, aided by Sapporo's dry-ish touch and a delicate hop profile, is rendered even more quaffable~~","wl0307","Nov 01, 2009"
3.92,12.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: I would have this again and would recommend this to those who like to try a roasted malt and mildly hoppy ""black beer"".","capra12","Feb 12, 2009"
2.79,-20.1,2,3,3,1.5,3,"D- Overall a very average dark lager. Admittedly, though, I have pulled more of these off the shelves of Japanese convenience stores than any other beer - but this is mostly a testemant to the lack of dark brew options here.","JeremyBrews","Jan 09, 2009"

3.91,12,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Enjoyed at the Ginza Lion Beerhall. Nice dark brown, bordering on black with a large mocha head. An impressive appearance from a major brewer. Caramel cocoa and coffee in the aroma. Smooth, roasty taste, somewhat like kostritzer, with the emphasis very much on the malts. Creamy mouthfeel and mild carbonation. Surprisingly good, and a solid quaffer.","bobsy","Dec 20, 2007"

3.26,-6.6,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Had at the Yebisu Beer Museum's bar. It's deep black with brown edges and a tan head that fades. Looks good. Nose is roasted caramel malts, and slight hoppy sweetness. Taste is decent malty goodness, slightly burnt on the finish, and an underlying sweetness. Not bad. Average mouthfeel and drinkability.","shivtim","Aug 10, 2007"
3.76,7.7,4,3,4,4,4,"This beer is a bit off the beaten path compared to most Japanese beers. If you're looking for a native beer that doesn't lack flavor and is a bit more malty than hoppy, this beer is a good bet. It's one of the best beers I've been able to find in Japan that is even available in the smaller cities. It's far better on tap if you can find it (I did at my local Ikaku restaurant), but don't hesitate to drink it straight from the can or bottle. Thumbs up from this gaijin.","jerryj","Jun 03, 2007"

4.1,17.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: This is my go-to beer in Japan as it's generally the most flavorful option at most stores and it doesn't run quite as expensive as Japanese craft brews. Definitely recommended in this land of rice lagers and happoshu.","soulgrowl","Jun 09, 2006"
3.4,-2.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Not bad for a macro, not bad at all. Had a couple of these at the Da Vinci bar in the ANA Hotel in Akasaka. Quite pleasant roasty aromas, and a good roasted caramel flavour, although fairly weak in body. Carbonation was a bit higher than I'd like as well, but still pretty drinkable.","crwills","Beers"

3.83,9.7,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"A quickly disappearing coke-like head: brownish with big bubbles. The color is dark purple, and the only thin I could get from the smell was some winy notes. The taste is interesting: smoked malts, winy grape notes, cherry and dark chocolate, floury on the tongue. The carbonation is citric and iodated. The mouthfeel is a bit rough from the chocolate like bitterness, but shows some creamyness too. A nice beer.","tjd25","Jul 18, 2003"
3.08,-11.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"I enjoy drinking this beer, despite its inflated price. It lacks the taste that Asahi's ""black"" beer pulls off, but it's great presentation and feels good in the mouth. The smell's a little watery, with only a slight maltiness. The very dark red color and fleeting head remind me of a nice Pennsylvania Dutch Birch Beer (not beer). There's a pretty high carbonation, which unfortunately doesn't give way to too much else. There's some type of earthy, slightly bitter unrefined beer taste, like peanut shells or something. Maybe a little dark cherry taste in there as well.","donnebaby","Beers"
3,-14,3,3,3,3,3,"The was an extraordinarily average beer. Tan rapidly disappearing head, medium to light lacing. The faintest aroma of coffee and nuts. This is very similar to the original Yebisu only, with the ever distant coffee and hazelnut flavor in the background. I would not bother to drink this again, but then again I am not a big fan of the style.","Naerhu","0"
