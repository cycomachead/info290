The smell of the beer was roasts and had a bit of smoke on the nose as well. The taste of the beer was a lot like a porter, it's roasted and has a slight sweetness to it.

3.4,-8.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a beer mug, a deep reddish brown clour with a quickly dissipating head. Tastes of caramel and toffee all the way. A strong malt presence can be felt in the first sip - sweet with burnt sugar, almost too much for a Euro Dark Lager. Mouthfeel is thin and pretty above average on the sting. I would pass this as average on drinkability because of its sweetness.","BeerSingh","Aug 03, 2009"

A really nice looking beer, (and a neat looking bottle by the way). Smelled nice, sort of a burnt chocolate smell. The taste was what you would expect from the smell. Sort of a burnt chocolate with just a hint of bitterness behind it. Maybe a burnt bitter chocolate? Really, I expect it really is derived from their porter To me, it tastes like a porter. It reminded me a LOT of Sierra Nevada's porter. If the bottle has said porter, it would have been an excellent representation of the style. Medium carbonation felt just about right. A couple would be enough, due to the style. I really enjoyed it though. Would hightly recommend it, and I'm hoping they still have some in stock when I get back to the store...","showell","May 02, 2009"

3.44,-7.3,4,2.5,3.5,4,4,"To me this is more of a schwarzbier than a BP due to abv, thickness, and strength of flavor. As the latter, this would be among my favorites, but as a Baltic Porter, it lacks both punch and character.","daliandragon","Feb 13, 2009"

Multi-layers of sticky, spotty lace cling to the pint glass, right above a good 1/2 finger covering of froth which doesn't go away until a drink is taken. Strong and sweet malt aromas float to the nose and envelop notes of butter, coffee, and slight medicinals. Has a medium to full-bodied mouth-feel, with a small amount of viscosity. The palate involves some spicy alcohol up front with some more sweet malts and a hop hit at the end for balance. Not as ""portery"" as expected, but still a good drinker that has it's own character to make up for it's shortcomings in the taste department.","stephens101","Dec 08, 2008"

Full, thick, chewy mouth feel. Full, malty flavor, with lots of molasses and smoke up front, fading to mostly molasses with a hint of burnt, chocolate malt in the finish. Rather sweet, with no obvious hops at all -- just enough to provide counterbalance to the ample malt. Leaves a smokey aftertaste. Somewhat similar to a German Rauchbier, tho not as intensely smokey and caramelized. Rather like a Baltic Porter, too -- has the fullness and intense toasted malt character.

Tastes a little weak but with the same sweet caramel malt as the smell. I expected more of a roastier flavor being that it is Fire-Brewed but it isn't bad.

No visible carbonation, little retention (it looked almost exactly like a root beer!) and little lacing. Aromas of toasted malt and grain with horse-blanket mustiness (classically what one would expect from a Baltic Porter). Well balanced flavors of sweet malts, roasted malts and hops with a long smoky finish. Medium body and light to medium carbonation (the fizziness is again present in the mouthfeel). Nothing remarkable, but straight up, a fine brew.","thekevlarkid","Jul 15, 2008"
4.8,29.4,5,5,4.5,5,5,"Extra apperance points for the super cool logo on the bottle. Pours a nice deep ruby with a large off white head, moderate lacing. Awesome nose a great purpley, granity aroma, the same that I love in sam smith's. It smells a little figgy, caramely and sweet. And tastes the same way figs, caramel you have to like a sweet beer to like this one but as I come back the simplicity and granity taste make this one a winner. It rolls across the tongue to a smooth finish and I could easily drink this all night long. Only the sweetness keeps this from a perfect score (in the dark lager or doppellbock category no similarity to a synbrnchoff, okocim or zyweic porters). I bought this beer looking for eastern european porter and got something totally different and totally delicious.","templar316","Jul 02, 2008"
4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Flavor is pleasant and unified. Certainly sweeter, and lighter than I had expected for a Baltic Porter.

Nose has a deep roasted grain aroma, sweet, caramel and a bit of licorice, clean and fresh. Start has a nice sweet toasted malt presence; just a bit bitter at the back, top is moderate in feel to the palate.

Very little dryness in this one, and it comes off as being watery. Carbonation is low as well.

Aroma of sweet roasted malt, with notes of caramel and toffee and a hint of peat smoke. Palate is again dominated by sweet malt, a touch of roastiness, and sweet caramel and light fruit. Finish is actually fairly dry and ends with a touch of peat smoke. The body is rich enough to handle the sweet flavors here, with a slight velvety character - very nice.

It's a bit sweet and some more hops might offset this for better balance but overall its an interesting and drinkable brew. It's also a medium body beer which is deceptive after initial inspection.

4.03,8.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear chestnutty brown, topped with a pufy, cream colored head. Unusual color, as brown beers are actually more like mahogany. This one's much more towards an aged leathery brown color. Good retention and lacing, sticking around for the long haul. Pretty dunkel-like aroma, with a hint of woodsy, campfire smokiness. Light, but present and intriguing. A bit of floral hops in the mix. The flavor opens with lagery clean malt. Sweetly roasty in that dunkel way, burnt caramel, with an added splash of wood-smoked malty sweetness, which always reminds me of smoked cheddar or bacon. Clean all the way through. Absolutely no off flavors. Lightly smoky finish, with modest floral hop bitters. Dryish, with feisty carbonation. Lightish bodied. A nice sessioner with a bit of smoke for complexity, but not enough so that you can't even look at bacon for a week. I'd like to see one of these brewed by a US craft brewery, rather than a smoked porter.","UnionMade","Sep 03, 2006"
4.17,12.4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"""Fire-Brewed Dark Beer"". Pours an dark brown, almost pitch black color with a creamy light tan head. Smell consists of coffee and slight hints of dark fruit and chocolate. Taste is just delicious! Taste starts out with sweet roasted malt, and finishes slightly bitter with a lingering coffee aftertaste. Wow! Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Overall, this is an outstanding brew that is definately recommended.","cjgator3","Aug 31, 2006"
3.48,-6.2,4,3.5,4,3,2.5,"This is a difficult beer to review...it's tasty, with a nice smoked flavor, but not enough to be a porter. A beautiful dark beer, with a 1/2 inch head on it. The smell is sweet malt and smokey, roasted malt. It's a great full beer, both in taste and mouthfeel, that really makes me realize that flavor and how a beer feels in my mouth is really the most important thing fr me, appearance and aroma are great...but give me taste anytime. I think on of these is my limit.","ccs","Aug 20, 2006"

4.55,22.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"I am familiar with Okocim's Porter so I eagerly jumped at the opportunity to try this one - Since it is a large bottle (0.5 l) I poured it into a large glass (over 0.5 l) - It poured a dark reddish-black with a large tight tan head which dissipated slightly leaving nice lacing - The aroma is immediately malty and sweet with hints of dark fruits - The taste is also malty and slightly sweet and fruity but very complex with hints of smoke (after all the malts are ""fire roasted) around the edges - It is full-bodied and smooth and drinks really easily - It's not perfect but it certainly got my attention as a beer that I'd like to keep around","Cindirene","Jul 11, 2006"

3.89,4.9,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Some head 'residue', a muddy brown with amber highlights when held to the light. A rather pleasent aroma, nice nose on this one. Some smokey chocolat - darker malts well present. Light bodied but quite decent tasting for a dunkel lager. A little watery maybe but I think it's just part of this style to not be too robust. Nice malt featured in the back part of the mouth. Not much aftertaste or finish, but more taste as far as in terms of standard lagers - like a refreshing taste. This, I found, to be perhaps a little artificial at times, very caramelly malt but reminds me of ""purple freezies"" in being more of an artificial flavour. I think perhaps it's the amber malt leaving me with this feeling. That aside, this is a good one; not bad at all. Tasty.","biegaman","Jun 01, 2006"
3.32,-10.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"An interesting brew. Clearly an effort to design a Rauchbier for the masses. As already mentioned, much better than regular Okocim lager. Worth a try.","ernie","Apr 28, 2006"
3.45,-7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Update - I thought I'd update by 2006 review with a 2008 sample. It is greater than the sum of its parts. My ratings are all 3.5 with one 3.0 but I will buy this whenever I see it in the store. It's nothing stellar but strangely sessionable.","RoyalT","Aug 24, 2005"
3.68,-0.8,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"500 ml bottle, bought in Poland. Beautiful dark mahogany colour, large and lasting creamy tan head. Aroma of rye bread, caramel and toasted malts, hints of leather. Flavour is very rich and malty sweet, you might say VERY sweet. Notes of caramel and plenty of lightly toasted malts. Hints of coffee. Just enough hops in the finish to balance the sweetness. Interesting beer!","Sigmund","Beers"
3.23,-12.9,4.5,4,3,3,2.5,"D: while remaining an easy-drinking dark lager, it lacks enough flavour and body to make it really enjoyable, hence the below-average drinkability.","wl0307","0"
