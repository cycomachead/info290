Aromas of molasses overwhelm me as soon as I get beer to meet glass. Hints of smoke, roast, and chocolate round out the aroma, but my God this smells like sugary unfermented molasses mostly. Wow the flavor does not stray from the aroma much. Sweet brown sugar and molasses run the show here. Light prunes and plums in the flavor as well and little to counter the malty or adjuct-y sweetness in this beer. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet thick sugary syrupy mouthfeel. I have no way to tell how old this bottle is but I suspect it may be less than fresh. That said the burnt sugar and molasses seem to be all this beer offers, it reminds me more of the barley malt sodas that I had in the Caribbean than actual beer.","johnnnniee","Jan 16, 2014"

I would put it at light to medium. The taste is overly sweet and malty with moderate bitterness and a clean finish.

The taste basically follows, with the harsher aspects of coffee pushed to the fore, along with a kind of overly smoked influence. All told, it's as though the smell was peat smoked and soured, but in a bad way, leading to a partly objectionable flavor. The body is lightly moderate, with a moderate carbonation and a thick but slippery feel. Overall, this is almost a pretty good brew, but the flavor misses the mark, leading to a feeling of ""if only...""; nonetheless, it spitefully maintains a decently high level of drinkability (...just not as high as it could be).","TMoney2591","Mar 12, 2010"

Semi-dry aftertaste with very low english hop profile. The roasted character takes care of the bitterness and the flavor is well-balanced.

I was a bit shocked when I was in Spain recently, to see so many San Miguel signs, but I then discovered that Spain has its own San Miguel-- I'm not sure if they're connected or totally unrelated.

Overall, this is a smooth, easy to drink lager that has an interesting and satisfying roasted character about it. Not much depth to it, but enjoyable.","pezoids","Sep 19, 2004"
3.15,-8.2,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured very dark and with barely any head to speak of. Nose was somewhat abrasive sweet caramel malts. Taste matched the smell, sweet with caramel. It reminded me of some sort of weak version of Coke. Faint hop dryness. Creamy in the mouth and low carbonation I think helped this beer to be a little bit drinkable for me.","donnebaby","Jul 20, 2004"
2.45,-28.6,3.5,3.5,2,2,2,"Poured from that 330 ml brown uber-stubbie bottle, no freshness date to be found. A quick fizzle of head that disappears almost sooner than it appeared, it almost looks like I poured a glass of Dr. Pepper. Mahogany-toned body, it gets that cherry red cola appearance when held up to the light. Right off the start I pick up dried date and fig aromas on the nose, while a sort of sweet malty molasses shows up after that, and then notes of black current as well. Curious. I'm not sure if the flavour has decided upon where it wants to stand, I have the dried fruit, toasted malt and molasses kind of thrown at me all at once. However it's not a very strong throw, it falls a bit short due to the watery mouthfeel which also affects the strength of the flavour as well, which is rather weak. No sir, I'm not impressed with this at all. However, to end on a positive note, how about 3 cheers for uber-stubbies!","IronDjinn","Jun 27, 2004"

3.4,-0.9,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Notes: The smell pumps you up and the taste brings you back down. It's not bad and it has it's strong points but lacks in the most important which is taste. Just a little too watery and thin. Mabuhay!","BeerAngel","Apr 01, 2004"
3.83,11.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This was a real surprising beer from San Miguel. After the experiences drinking San Miguels (not the dark lager) in the P.I. back in the day, I wasn't too sure I'd be getting anything very good with this one. This is one easy-drinking brew and worth picking up if you see it on the shelf.","Boilermaker88","Mar 11, 2004"

3.08,-10.2,3.5,3,3,2.5,3.5,"The beer disembogues the bottle a deep sanguineous color, the head Bunyanesque in size and a light brown color, the texture is frothy and the lace a thick and clinging sheet. Nose is sweet malt, molasses like, fresh crisp and clean to the senses, start is lightly sweet, nicely malted, top a bit thin. Finish is mild in its acidity, the hops mild and pleasing to the palate, aftertaste very dry and long-lasting, drinkable, but a much better beer on July 4, 1962 when I pulled my first liberty in Subic Bay, Philippines and sampled my first foreign beer, geez that more than 40 years ago, time sure flies when youre having fun.","Gusler","Feb 08, 2004"
3.27,-4.7,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Begins with a creamy but receding beige head with an average amount of lace. The aroma is a surprisingly interesting mixture of roasted coffee, chocolate or mollasses and even a hint of raisins. There is a sourness and bitterness to this beer. Initally, it has a stout-like flavour and there is a suggestion of soapiness. You can taste the alcohol in the finish. On the palate, San Miguel Dark is softly carbonated, dry and a bit thin. Not a bad brew.","mwrseeley","Dec 31, 2003"

3.5,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,"This is a nice beer from the Philippines, I must say. Perhaps a bit one dimensional due to the malt being the focal point, but it is quite easy to drink, and I can imagine having this with some dark poultry, like duck for instance. It isn't a grounbreaking beer in anyway, but is a good old easy to drink dark lager.","Beastdog75","Nov 20, 2003"
3.83,11.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"poured a dark brownish color, sweet malt aroma on the first sniff, first taste was surprisingly great . I was hit by a blast of sweet chocolate roastedness, which leveled out as the glass went down but I savored it to the end.Tasty refreshing all a beer should be. It reminded me of Xingu, but I thought this was better","grynder33","Oct 30, 2003"
3.04,-11.4,4,2.5,3,4,3,"Dark brown color, large head. Aroma is roasted malts/ Dark roasted malts, slightly sweet. Hops are subdued. Mild taste and flavor. Well balanced, but a little thin tasting. Not a bad beer, but nothing special. Better than I expected. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","beerguy101","Sep 20, 2003"

3.8,10.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A clear, very deep mahogany body rests beneath a creamy head of light tan foam that slowly receeds to a solid collar and leaves some very nice transient lace. The nose offers a sweetish toffee malt that's clean and welcoming. It's smooth and creamy across the palate with a medium body and delicate, somewhat restrained carbonation. The flavor delivers a mild fruity note and a dollop of gentle, sweet buttery caramel that's just enough to keep it interesting. The underlying bitterness balances very nicely in the mouth, and emerges a bit in a short-lived finish that expresses some light nuttiness. A well-brewed beer with some interesting character. Very nice!","NeroFiddled","Aug 12, 2003"
3.15,-8.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"This is a very nice Dunkel from the Phillipines. It pours a very dark amber with some retention in the cream colored head. A small level of lace was observed through most of the glass. A very nice nose gives a bit of floral and caramel malt sense and the flavor is sweet, but not over the top as with many heavy Dunkels. There apears to be only a moderate ABV for this beer, though none is listed. Overall, this is a nicely drinkable Dunkel at moderate price levels.","AtLagerHeads","Jul 11, 2003"
2.71,-21,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Taste: I'm not that familiar with dark lagers. I really felt like this tasted like an unfinished beer, if that makes any sense. There is a slightly hoppy taste to it, but I'm left, considering the dark color, expecting a richness that just wasn't there.","woemad","Jun 08, 2003"

3.68,7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Clear dark brown with a nice big and cottony head.  Very caramel aroma, malty to be sure.  Nice chocolate and toffee early flavor, minimal hops, but the early flavor is taken to the close by a medium-bodied mouthfeel.  Slight sense of papery notes, but not pronounced.  Not a huge impression but unexpectedly good, tasty, and drinkable.  One of the best darker Lagers I've had from an equatorial country.","ADR","Oct 04, 2002"
2.1,-38.8,2,2,2,2,2.5,"i don't know about this one, it looks a hell of a lot better than the regular San Miguel, but in the end, there was nothing happening, very thin body, watery texture, quite sweet, and very bland.","rastaman","Aug 08, 2002"
