"As of 2014, it is an award winning brew that has a solid unique flavor."

"Not too bad of a beer"

"Not a bad ""go-to"" beer."

"Dark malt pils.  Not exceptionally malty nor exceptionally hoppy.  If you like dark lagers this is for you to add to the beer you had.  I will drink it again."

" This is very interesting just because of how unique it is. SBCs other year-round beers are very mediocre but I really enjoyed the pils-noir since it stood out among their other offerings."

"Pils Noir pours a dark copper color with a small non-lacing head. There is a rich malty aroma, with a nice spice note. the taste has nice malty backbone, with a good spice note, nice crisp sweet malt finish. Nice flavors, but overall the body is a bit watery. Overall its a nice lighter beer, good spice notes, nice flavors."

"My pour netted me a finger of fizzy, deep-tan head that quickly fell away to wisps. Color was a deep-garnet or deep-ruby (SRM = > 27, < 34) with NE-quality clarity when held up to the dying light of the day. Nose had a very caramel-like sweetness, perhaps from the decoction. Caramel and milk chocolate, actually. Mouthfeel was prickly, as though the carbonation was very tight. The taste was smoky, chocolaty, a little nutty and somewhat caramel. Man, this was a liquid candy bar of some stripe, although I could not put my finger on it. Finish was a bit too sweet for my taste, but there was nothing intrinsically wrong with it. You might be disappointed if you had your heart set on a schwartzbier, but otherwise, this was a decent bier."

"That said, this offering did pair well with my tilapia dinner."

"Bottom Line: Decent brew"
"O--Just a step below excellent. Still , ""pretty damn good"" is pretty damn good. I'd give it two thumbs up, especially at its reasonable price. Still finding it hard to believe that I preferred the bottle to the draught, though."

"Inoffensive is the best I can say."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is clean, crisp and one of the more enjoyable schwarzbiers I have had in a long time. I wish it would have included just a bit of roast however it's drinkability and clean profile make up for that. It is to be commended that this the first schwarzbier I have had in a long time that did not have a strange mineral aspect to the finish and little to no diacetyl. Well done, would drink again."

"I would drink this again. Good brew, Central PA."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light pale malt scent along with a touch of black malt earthiness. It's bone dry with a slight bitterness. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth, earthy black malt flavor. It's faint, but adds a solid bitterness and excellent color. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer, but nothing too interesting. Nonetheless, I'd throw a few of these in the fridge any day."

"D: first of all, this should be labeled on this website as a Schwarz, not simply as a German Pils. baring the mis-labeling on BA, this is a pretty solid Schwarz. plenty of bitter dark malt while not being fruity. lager-like throughout. wouldn't hate for a touch more on the hop aroma side of things, maybe some aroma has worn off due to time since bottling, but without any date coding impossible to tell."

"O - Not bad. A unique brew if anything, a gimmick if you will. Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer, but I would've hoped a little more character could be in a unique beer such as this. Regardless, SBC still has yet to disappoint me, so keep it up guys!"

"Similar to a Schwarzbier in flavor. The Pilsner qualities are completely lost. I can't say that I'm crazy about this one."
"I like this beer it was good. I hope to try more of thier products as they come my way."

"Once again, thank you SBC!"
