3.56,14.1,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"-- Falls between a dry Irish - light-bodied and char-heavy - and English stout - sweet and fruity - to end up nowhere. Sickly artificial quality to the sweetness, like certain macro Euro dark lagers. Not roasty enough for schwarz; not enough Munich for dunkel. Still, I’d take it if Sagres was the only alternative. 3.5","StJamesGate","Oct 28, 2014"

3,-3.8,,,,,,"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 4C). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L2617741. AROMA: faint roastiness aromas with some odd artificial aroma. low malt profile with no esters and no diacetyl. APPEARANCE: deep brown color and opaque. medium light brown head with average retention. TASTE: low roasted flavour that lingers into the finish. low bitterness and hop flavours. clean lager profile. finishes medium-dry. PALATE: light body with average carbonation. OVERALL: altough the label says ""Stout", this is indeed an average Schwarzbier (a case of improper advertising?) that could loose the E150c.","titvs","Sep 22, 2014"

2.58,-17.3,4,2.25,2.25,3,3,"O: Cool bottle and name. I'm new to Portuguese beers looked pretty cool and gave the illusion of a ‘bock’ a style which I normally like. Disappointed in that it was very watery and had a metallic taste, even a downer for a Euro Dark Lager. Will go well with my steak though.","patre_tim","Sep 14, 2013"

3.23,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Served at a pleasant little Tapas Bar, called the Vintage Cafe, in the Rocks - not seen it anywhere else in Sydney. Served too cold, tho. having said that I had two and could quite easily have continued, so sessionable it is, even if no hops to balance out the sweet malts.","heygeebee","Feb 17, 2011"
3.41,9.3,3.5,2.5,4,3,3.5,"Overall, Super Bock Stout is quite good. I agree that it's really more of a dark lager than a stout - I'm expecting a much more distinct, exotic, love-it-or-hate-it flavor/character from stouts, and this doesn't stray very far from the spirit of mass-produced lagers.","bluepiranha","Oct 24, 2010"

3.18,1.9,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This was my first foray beyond golden lagers in Portugal and I was only mildly impressed. The beer was a nice dark brown color with tan head that went quickly but left nice lacing. It smelled decent, but couldn't make out much beyond very light coffee and caramel tones. Taste was about the same, left me with a smooth mouthfeel. Decent carbonation. Pretty drinkable actually. Had I not found Sagres Preta in Sagres after the one day in Lisbon, I probably would have drank more of this. Thumbs up!","NewGeneric","Jan 15, 2009"
2.48,-20.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,2,"On a final note: Make no mistake, it is closer to a Stout rather than to a Euro Dark Lager HOWEVER it is an unimpressive one. Way to bland and lacking a bit of everything that makes a great stout, great. Will not have again.","endovelico","Jul 23, 2007"
