"Not going to get into aroma. I love lagers, but I don't find them to be nose pleasers per say. Off white head holds on nicely throughout the glass, especially against the dark base. Tried to get a decent pic of the pretty deep brown color. The roasted malt comes through, though not to the extent the color would lead you to believe. Also a surprisingly faint coffee taste, along with almost a nutty flavor. Going to look through reviews and see if anyone else gets that. Sort of a dark lager/brown ale combo. Off the top of my head, I think it is a better version of a Beck's Dark."

"This is where it gets interesting. I had to use a spoon to get some of the head out of the glass to pour the rest. The taste was okay, nothing special, but like I said, I think this was a bad bottle. I will find this again and give it a fair shot."

"The mouth feel is foamy - too foamy. Still, it was an experience, just one I don't care to repeat."

"O: not bad, but not up with, for example, better Czech versions."

"The beer pours a dark, dull amber with a razor thin head that doesn't lace. The nose has a grain sweetness, notes of coffee and roast, but not much else. It drinks with a grain-forward sweetness with a touch of fruit and caramel, but very little bitterness. The mouthfeel presents a lingering grain sweetness, good carbonation, a mild reinforcing roast, touch of chocolate, and a little bitterness. This is a decent beer, but absolutely average."

"D- I didn't expect much from this one, but I'm pleasantly surprised. A tasty flavorful brew that I could definitely drink more than one of."

"At first, before I've identified the style, it's from the feel that I definitely notice this isn't an American bruiser of any kind, nor is it in porter or stout territory. It isn't bland, though, and its crispness and moderate carbonation keep it going while it doesn't lack smoothness, so that even as a light to medium-bodied dark lager, it works."

"It's medium bodied for a Lager and once again, it's the best Lager I have ever had from any brewery."
"Thanks Chuck."

"O- A very flavorful roasty and sweet lager that drinks like a milk stout/porter/oatmeal stout hybrid. Great creamy mouthfeel and very sessionable. This would be a staple in my fridge if I could get this beer around Cleveland."

"This is a very enjoyable beer. It had very little head or lacing in a pint glass. Smells good and taste improves as it warms a bit. Smooth with toasty, coffee-like flavor. Pairs better with food than porter, but has a flavor that is similar. I was glad to discover Elevator Brewing since it a local brewery. Columbus Brewing's regular offerings are good but more for hop enthusiasts."
"The smell is somewhat subdued but a little sulfur is noticeable at the fringe with a little bit of caramel. The taste is similar with roasted malts, caramel, and a tiny amount of chocolate. Maybe even vanilla? Not a very sweet beer at all, but that's to be expected."

"Overall: Actually, one of the best dark lagers I've had. EXTREMELY sessionable, but, at the same time, not boring. Would love to get my hands on a 6pk of this!"
"O: Overall I would definly have this again loved it and all I tasted there."
"Overall a not too shabby dark larger. Actually contemplating another bottle."
"The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected but it makes it easy drinking and very enjoyable. The carbonation is just right with a slight sting on the palate. Overall, this is an easy drinking, flavorful lager. Things came together pretty well here; another solid offering from Elevator."
"O:Very good beer overall. It has great color and taste and a fairly good aroma as well. This beer is definitely one that you can drink an entire 6-pack of on a hot summer day"
"Overall this is a pretty nice brew. They boast on the label that it won a bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and I can see why."
"This beer poured a clear very dark amber color and formed a nice foamy light tan head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An aroma of malts, breads and lightly of chocolate. The flavor was of malt, chocolate and bread. The body is fairly light and the finish slightly sweet. Not a bad beer."
"Future outlook: A pleasant easy drinking beer...but not really in line with my preferences, and not something I will likely seek out in the future."
"Lighter body, but not overly fizzy. Alcohol is a non-factor here. Overall, not terribly interesting but without any major flaws. This would be easy to drink a lot of."
"Elevator Dark Horse Lager is solid beer from the gate to the backstretch to the finish line. Even though it uses lager yeast, it's really more of an American brown ale than anything else. Forget being a dark horse, this stuff is a favorite."
"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. For a brew at just over 5% abv the alcohol is quite pronounced but plays off with a nice subtle fruity flavor that meshes well with the other flavors. It is quite drinkable but a little too sweet for my liking and at times the buttery notes just dont blend well with the other flavors. As the brew warms, it picks up a bit of a light roasted quality about the malt that lingers in the mouth."
"Drinkability is good. Slides down easy and has enough flavor to warrant making it a session beer."
"Medium bodied for a lager. slightly dry but overall a very smooth and easy drinking beer. I am slowly becoming sold that I need to be paying more attention to Elevator, and next time I see this in stores I'll probably come home with some."
"This is good dark lager, try it."
"Not too shabby. Dark Horse is straightforward & plays it safe. Certainly nothing wrong with that. Still, with other quality beers available locally (from Elevator & others), this won't end up in any sort of regular rotation."
"Pours a clear dark brown color with a faint head that gives way to very little lacing. The aroma is nice, a caramel malt with some breadiness and some biscuit present. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone with a nice taste of toast and biscuits. There is also a hint of dark fruits present. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated. It is a little too much going on in the mouth. The drinkability is very good, a nice smooth flavor with a nice taste. There is a nice enough balance to keep you wanting more. The mouthfeel is a little bit distracting though."
"Note: the beer did not survive this review."
"D = This is an easy drinker."
"The aromas were a little roasted and bready yeast, it was very light and subtle. Basically what I look for in a lager when it comes to smell. The flavor was roasted and sweet at the same time. It was crisp and light in the mouth with good carbonation. It was a easy brew to drink and was looking for more when I finished it"
"D- Pretty sessionable. Finishes clean and dry. Easy to drink."
"D- Easy drinker for sure, not something out would go out and seek but then again I wouldn't turn it down either."
"Pours a transparent dark amber almost brown color. less than a 1/2 finger of head that dissipates to a then film almost immediately. Not a whole lot on the nose. A hint of toasty sweet bread. The taste is dominated by roasted barley and a bready malt backbone. A little sweetness kicks in before it finishes slight bitter and dry. This beer has the crispness you expect from a lager while providing nice roasted characters. The mouthfeel is quite pleasant, as well. An overall easy drinking and enjoyable brew."
"Overall a nice little lager I have to say. Not the biggest fan of the style, but I have to admit this kind of worked for me. I would have no issue at all with trying this one again any day!"
"This was decent. Definitely a little darker tasting than you would expect from a normal lager. I'm not sure how old this bottle was, but it seemed to have a bit of fade on it. I'd like to re-review in the future with a fresher sample."
"I had this on-tap at the Huntington Field ball-park in Columbus. While I was pleased to find an alternative to Bud Light, I can't say this beer is anything to get too excited about. Dark-brown body, light frothy head. Minimal aroma. Flavor was Newcastle-ish; some light toffee roastiness accompanied by wateriness. Not bad, but hardly terrific."
"This might be the closest to style beer that the Elevator offers... if compared to good Dunkels."
"Cheers to session beers!"
"D: A nice, drinkable lager. The first dark lager I think I've had. I'll definitely try this one again!"
"Thanks to csmiley for the opportunity to sample this."
"Above average brew. Gives off a floral smell with roasted malt character. Not quite as dark as the name suggests but does taste more like a schwarzbier than a lager. Mouthfeel is average and is on par with red/amber lagers with a bit more weight to it. Drinkability is fair given the well balanced nature of this beer."
"22 ounce bottle, it's Elevator's first bottled beer (purchased at Blacklick Wine and Spirits). Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with some red tints too. Head retention is average, lacing is very good. Aroma is toasted malt and nuts, with a bit of chocolate and hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but the hops come out more in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's on the creamy side and has average carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and very easy to drink with a dry finish. Overall I think it's a good, sessionable dark lager (5.3% ABV). I'd definitely pick this up again, it's a good choice and the first bottled selection Elevator is selling in the Columbus area. Recommended."
"Drinkability- Very smooth, will be revisited in the future for certain."
"Clear dark brown, with a slightly off white head that has alright retention, minimal lacing. Mild aroma of toasted malt and some fruitiness. Flavor of malt, slight chocolate and a bit nutty. Balanced off with some floral hoppiness. Dry and clean finish. Decent overall, nice example."
"On draught at the brewpub. Pours a mostly clear dark brown color with a medium and fluffy beige head that has decent retention. Patchy lacing. Aroma of roasted nuts and malt, with hints of hops. Medium, smooth body with a nice roasted character. Notes of malt, chocolate and nuts along with a decent amount of hops. The finish is dry and roasty with a lingering mild hoppiness. Pretty good all around."
