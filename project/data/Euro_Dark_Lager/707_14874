4.19,17.7,4,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,"500 ml bottle from BevMo. Nose of yeast and mild vanilla. Mild roasted malt, pleasant caramel taste. Slightly smoky. Silky mouth feel. No hops bitterness. Good carbonation with a semi-dry finish that makes it very easy to drink. Light, yet flavorful. Love the low ABV.","loubar","Nov 21, 2014"

3.68,3.4,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Light roasted malt, a little prickly from the carbonation, smooth mild coffee and tobacco flavors linger in the aftertaste. Schwartzbier-ish. Light bodied but somewhat substantial, a little watery in the finish, traces of oxidation. Overall it's a good dark lager, maybe a little bit long in the tooth, but still has some life left.","emerge077","Aug 12, 2013"

4.3,20.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O -- Sometimes too much Saaz hop can fatigue my palate, but the balance with the toasted and roasty malts -- on top of a very drinkable 4.8 ABV -- makes this a very enjoyable beer.","steveh","Nov 27, 2011"

3.73,4.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"O- This had a lot of the similarities as their double bock but the melanodin and sweetness really start to dominate as it warms and there isn't any alcohol or hops to cut the sweetness.","rhoadsrage","Jul 19, 2011"
3.75,5.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Thanks again goes out to D. Kurtz for hooking me up with 3 of these rarities-Maibock, Dark Lager & Double Bock. Pours Clear dark red/brown beer with a large beige head. Aroma is malty sweet with notes of coffee and caramel. Flavor is malty with notes of caramel, grainy hops. Nothing special but a great beer when you want to keep it simple.","beergod1","Jan 23, 2011"

3.2,-10.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Kind of a rough beer and quite heavy too, although you shouldn't let the cheap looking bottle and the sugar listed in the nutricion facts frighten you off. In the end it's better than one expects.","stoepsel","Aug 04, 2010"
3.6,1.1,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Firstly my bottle looks abit different to this but its exactly the same beer and it pours a ruby cola hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head and a layer of lacing around the sides of glass,i really like the aroma of this its very sweet indeed almost like maple syrup,milo,caramel and lots of honey,the mouthfeel is quite sessionable and just above light but could be thicker and has tastes of sweet toffee,caramel,roasted barley,dark dried fruits and finishes with a buttery,maple syrup smooth finish,overall it definately took me by suprise as i wasnt expecting it to be like this and my only real complaint is its mouthfeel and if you dont like sweet beers you will not like this one but im quite enjoying it and more than likely will revisit.","ADZA","Jun 27, 2010"

4.13,16,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours an extra dark chestnut brown with a couple fingers of thick tan head displaying some good retention and fair lacing. The aroma is is nutty, umami, mildly roasty, and figgy. The flavor is lightly vinous, nutty, and meaty with a nicely bitter oatmeal raisin cookie finish. Medium-thick bodied with a pleasantly subdued carbonation, nicely done though perhaps a bit light for the richly full flavor. Overall this is a really nice beer, a fully flavored lager with nutty rich characters but also low in alcohol and easy drinking. Very good.","vacax","Aug 25, 2009"
4.5,26.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: I havn't had so many dark lagers - but if they're all like this, I'm sure gonna drink a lot of them.","Evil_Pidde","Jan 25, 2009"
4.45,25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The taste is full, rich, and complex, yet still light and easy going, with great depth. It has toasted grain, hint of rich whole wheat, earth, caramelised grain, hint of mapple syrup, root beer, full-flavour. It has both sweetness and a little bitterness plus a zesty spicey bite, but the sweetness is a little too strong and the bitterness is very light, the spicey zestiness being the main counterpoint to the sweetness. Dunkels and dark lagers generally shouldn't be very bitter anyway, but it is still just a tad on the overly sweet side. Overall, it's well-rounded, fairly balanced, with solid depth and range of character, very pleasant, enjoyable, satisfying yet easy to drink.","Offa","Jun 20, 2008"
4.38,23,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A dark eurolager or a swartzbier? I think it is more in the latter style. Anyway this beer is very pleasant, tasty and highly drinkable: It suits both a Mediterranean meze and BBQ.","bark","Mar 24, 2008"
3.85,8.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Nice Dark brown with a tan head. This beer smells malty and tastes malty with a pleasant sweetness to the finish.

4,12.4,4,4,4,4,4,"(500 ml bottle, called Tmavé Lezak in Czech. Bought in Sweden.) I somehow managed to delete my original comments here, damn! But this is still a nice dunkel, deep reddish brown colour, decent head. Flavour is malty and bready with a moderate but nice roastiness, notes of caramel, moderately sweet. I would like some more hops in the finish, but thats the Czech dunkel style, I guess.","Sigmund","Beers"
3.62,1.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a beautiful clear dark brown under a small tan head that disappears too quickly. Much too quickly. The nose is full of sweet caramel, with may one plum thrown in. The mouth is heavy and mildly carbonated. The taste is sweet - caramel and fruit, as promised by the nose. This is followed by some mild hoppiness that lingers well into the aftertaste, which is nevertheless more fruity than bitter. This beer has a lot of promise, and certainly isn't bad, but somehow, I'm disappointed. It seems to be just a bit more watery than it could or should be.","Globetrotter","0"
