"O - I can see flaws here, but there was something about the way that this all came together that I dug. The simpler flavor did wear out it's welcome by the end of the bottle. But overall quite good. I would have to be in the mood, but would likely buy again."

"Nothing good comes from a plastic liter bottle."
"DATE TASTED: February 7, 2015... GLASSWARE: Baltika stange... OCCASION: A pinewood derby/violin recital/quiz bowl triple play--quite a day!... APPEARANCE: this beer is heard before it is seen, with a sizzling fizzle that quiets to an iced tea head of inconsistent bubbles; dark amber translucent body that holds steady effervescent; weak, spotty lacing... AROMA: caramel syrup is clearly present; pitchy, sweet malts are unbalanced by any hop aromas... PALATE: rather thin, watery mouthfeel that moves swiftly to the throat--akin to a sugarless iced tea...TASTE: mildly sweet, with faint caramel; a pungent finish, with awkward, cloying unbalanced corn maltiness--were are the hops? ...OVERALL: a slightly alcoholic, corny, malty, syrupy attempt at a dunkel...what’s not to like? not much...slightly enjoyable ..."
"Nice and dense dark beer from Russia. Recommend this one"

"Didn't have much expectation, but surprisingly good.  Very smooth going down, nice dark, brown color and relatively low on carbonation.  I sensed a bit of chocolate and slight bitterness.  Overall, I'd buy this again at my local deli."

"medium body with low to medium carbonation, probably a little old."

"500 ml bottle into lager glass, best before 6/25/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, raisin, plum, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, light chocolate, raisin, plum, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; with very good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean lager flavors as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice dunkel lager style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall 3.75: A surprise and a good beer. Would be a great complement to almost any food. While a bit on the sweet side, it is smooth and balanced. Definitely worth a try if you find it."

"Pours out to a nice buff, creamy head that falls to a creamy ring that persists. no significant lacing. Color is reddish dark brown and filtered clarity. Aroma is caramelized malts, molasses, honey graham crackers with a slight wisp of spicy hops. Flavor is malty and sweet but not as sweet as the nose implies. No discernible hops on the tongue. Mouthfeel is thin and sticky. Overall, a decent quaff that is worthy of repeating."

"O- Okay. Really, better than I was expecting, but still cheap tasting and syrupy."
""
""
""
""
"This the most balanced of the Baltikas, likely the best one along with number 6. But it is good, not great. If you like caramel beers, this may be your choice."
""
""
""
""
""
"The sweetness is prevalent in the flavor at first with a quick hint of low bitterness at the end. It seems to fit into the style well enough but there is nothing extraordinary about it. Easy to drink though."
""
""
"I think this is a very middle of the pack output from Baltika. The color looked great & inviting progressing from a dark brown to dark yellow. There was a hint of sweetness to the smell that wasnt supported by the taste. The finish reminded me of caramel both in taste & in sucking it off the sides of my mouth. I think in the future I'll stick with #6 if I can, but this wouldn't be the worst 3rd choice."

"Makes me glad I do not live in Russia."
"Pours a clear dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and some caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a toasted bread flavor on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors and one of the better Baltika beers in my opinion."
"Pours a crystal clear, medium brown; the color of strong pekoe tea. Sweet smells of warm pumpernickel, waffles. Taste is toasty with definite notes of rye/pumpernickel. Sweet caramel and toffee on the swallow. Medium body. Smell of rye malt really picks up as it warms a bit. This is an awesome beer!"
""
"overall, it's a really good brew. nice head, beautiful lacing, can session it (for awhile), and it makes me want to try the others in its line up. and maybe a blonde russian farm girl, too!"
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom half-liter brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Overall: Grains and hops could be tasted in this beer. Baltika #4 is a practical dark beer. The taste does not seek to overpower anybody. Baltika #4 has the dark beer flavour without any harshness. There are no rough edges with Baltika#4. Baltika #4 is a mellow dark beer that is easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good beer, I just have two things in mind when I drink it. If it is best suited for after dinner or after dessert, that is the question? Salud!"
""
"This pours a dark amber color with a fluffy beige head. The scent is mainly malts with some yeast present. The taste is sweet and malty to begin with and finishes with a toasted malted after taste. Leaves a decent lacing around the glass and drinks rather smoothly. A pretty decent dark lager from Russia."
""
"The color when poured into a glass was a medium dark golden brown with a reddish hue. There was no foam or lace what so ever. The smell of roasted malts, caramel and molasses was very evident in the aroma of this dark larger. I could taste the roasted malts, but also it had a flavor, reminding me of, I hate to say this, but, Alfalfa. It had a grassy aftertaste. There is also a taste of sweet caramel and molasses on the aftertaste, along with the alfalfa. If not for the grassy taste, this would be a lot better dark lager."
""
"I have never been to Russia, but I love the name and I love the culture. What I know of it, anyway. I know when I was in Poland, they drank more vodka than we do water. Maybe in Russia they drink more Baltika than water! If I lived there, I know I would!"
""
""
"Poured this Euro Dark Lager from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy amber color, produced a small cream colored head, poor retention and left little lacing on the glass. The aroma of this lager consisted of sweet candy syrup and caramel. The foundation of this brew consisted of sweet cereal grains, caramel, grapes, and some spicy hops. The balance of this brew was off- it was way to sweet- Unlike any Euro Lager I have had. Decent session beer if your looking for something different, but not something that I would go back to if there are other options."
""
"O - This is actually pretty drinkable and alongside some complexity this beer is far from a waste. Of this brewery's beers, I find this to be on the high end. Not bad for the $2 price tag."
"Atmosphere is okay. Decent appearance, although no lacing. Nose is simple combo of malt and hefty infusion of molasses. Flavor is malty with the a slight sweet tinge, but seems a little a shallow and washed-out. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
""
""
"Overall - It's okay. Lacks a decent balance. Probably wouldn't buy again."
"Murky and unpleasant, but a lovely sudsy brew. Label says production date is 25.05.11, so this stuff is a year and a half old. Thank you BevMo, for dusting the bottles so no one notices. That might explain the uninspiring taste. I'll check the dates next time."
"Taste is like the smell. It's earthy, it's malty. It's pungent. Not a lot of hops. It's got a dark fruit flavour to it and it tastes...old. Not surprising since it was brewed 9 months ago and is a lager. It says it's good for a year, though. It's by no means a complex beer, but it's by no means bad either. I probably won't buy it again since I liked the #9 a lot better and it is the same price. Actually, I will probably buy another one if it is noticeably fresher. This one has a staleness to it that might not be there if it were on the fresher side."
"Za Vas!!!"

"Food match: What goes with pumpernickel tasting beers? Pumpernickel! For the uninitiated - pumpernickel is a dark rye bread that is as dense as a black hole, just as dark and a little sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems to be a bit sweet and lacks any complexity in the taste."
"O: This is not a great beer and that is unfortunate because Baltika makes some decent beers. I am unlikely to buy this beer again. The best part of this beer is the appearance."
""
"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear copper color with a nice amount of rising carbonation. The off-white head retained itself rather well and laced as a sliding curtain. The aroma was of bread malt, a little brown sugar, caramel malt, some nuts and a hint of hops. The flavors were appealing and I can see why this became their flagship beer. I tasted caramel malt, toasted malt, sweet malt (it was a sweet beer in general), some bread, a little butter and booze on the finish. It had very little hop presence but I didn’t find that detracted from the brew much. The mouthfeel was decent, the body medium and the carbonation medium/light. A nice Euro Dark Lager and a beer I could definitely have a session of."
"Pours a dark reddish-amber hue with a frothy, thin, white head that quickly dissipates in to a wispy lace leaving a semi trail down the glass. Strong caramel malt aroma with a mix of fruits and a buttery finish. Smooth sweet maltness flavor followed caramel and some fruitiness. Medium body and medium carbonation. Decent dark lager – not my favorite but it was very smooth and tasty."
"500ml bottle. Mug. Enjoyed on mar´12.Dark amber color,orangish to the light.Clear appearance.Light beige froth.Creamy lasting crown.Toasted malt & intense caramel malt aromas.Sweet malty upfront,adjunct cereal smoothness.Low hoppiness.Ripe fruits -apricot,plum- & some molasses in the middle.Medium body,soft carbonation.Chocolates note finish.Sweet malty aftertaste.Well balanced flavors & aromas.Flavorful & pleasant beer."

"Sweet caramel hits you immediately, almost thumping you over the head. After that there is a smooth spicy alcohol taste mixed with the grainy herb taste. Heavy on carbonation, it seems like it is almost trying to be a soda beer. Drinks much like an ale in its lightness but the caramel is the body note. Smell is quite sweet and the look is a gorgeous dark red. Comes in a fancy tall 1 pint 9 oz bottle as apparently Russia has something to prove. Don't let the ""Dark Lager"" tag fool you, this is a smooth beer for sessions or light meals. A bit pricey for casual drinking, but if you are feeling adventurous, Baltikas are never in the bad category, and like this one, are usually quite good. For a country known for its vodkas, they make a damn fine beer. Because of its sweetness, it is a terrific beer to give someone who thinks that all ""dark"" beers taste of charcoal."
"Overall this is really a sugar bomb. Drinkability suffers as a result and really the actual flavors just aren't that good."
""
""
"T: light body, same as aroma, a little bittternes at the very end, the roast is left on palate"

"Very simple beer, but/and it is worth buying. One of the better dark lagers that I have tasted."
"My pour produced over two fingers worth of fizzing mocha-colored head with surprisingly decent retention. Underneath the head was a glass of burnt orangish-amber beer with NE-plus quality clarity. BUPGOO! Bringing the glass up to my sniffer, it evinced a nutty, chocolaty odor and I was primed! Mouthfeel was medium and it had a grainy, nutty, chocolaty taste in my mouth, like a chocolate-covered granola bar. Boy howdy, after having sifted through CAN after CAN of AALs, this was a welcome change of pace. I have never felt ripped off after drinking a Baltika beer, even if it was not all that great, given their relatively low price point. Finish continued with that same nutty chocolate flavor and I found myself wishing that I had another bottle. Good stuff."

"This brew poured out as a decent looking brown color. The head was pretty good looking at first but disappeared within a few minutes. The smell of the beer had some typical lager earthy notes to it with a slight roasted sweetness. The taste of the beer had some caramel elements to it along with some roasted nuts and grassy earth flavors. The first sip wasn't that good to me but as I drank the beer it got better. The mouthfeel was decent, had a medium body and carbonation. Overall this brew wasn't too bad but I wasn't blown away by it either. It was ok, I might drink it again depending on the situation."
"Appearance is a dark ruby amber having a thin stiff head that dissipates to a thin film. Smell of rich malt, molassas and darker fruits. Taste follows the nose having a mild hop note that finishes clean. Mouthfeel is medium, a little viscous with good carbonation. Overall a very enjoyable dark lager."
"O: Besides the slightly metallic finish, nothing bad about this beer, but nothing stands out either. Hard to review it since this style does not have a description."
"There was a decent amount of alcohol flavor in the front of the mouth."
"The finish continues the redundancy of sweetness and I can't help but think that if the yeast had more aggressive in their feasting that this beer would have come out a little drier and more enjoyable for my palate."
"Baltika #4, the original, a must tick. This one pours a medium bodied, light amber in color with ruby highlights. A scummy off white head laced the glass. It smells of sweet malts and kind of has a chocolate malt, like Ovaltine, aspect to it. I didn't quite expect that, so all in all in smells appealing. The flavor is very sweet and on the verge of syrupy. It's all malt and actually tastes like a Scottish/Wee Heavy. It's lightly nutty has a lot of sweet fruit going on. It's very interesting and much better than I thought it would be. It is very sweet though. It drinks between light and medium in body and is a really smooth drinker. Overall it's a solid brew and exceeded my expectations."
"O- Pleasantly surprised by this beer. It's not the greatest in the world, but for the style it's very drinkable, and has a pleasant flavor. Recommended for the style."
"Overall - Not a bad brew at all. It tastes good, and is at least somewhat interesting to think about."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep reddish copper brown color with a decent beige head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lace. Smells of caramel molasses and brown sugar with hints of corn and grain deep underneath. Very little hop presence but hints of earthy floral hops. Sweet caramel toffee and molasses flavor, almost a bit too sweet. Little to no hop taste whatsoever. Crisp carbonic acid is the only thing keeping this from being overly cloying. Medium body with a sweet slick mouthfeel. Despite the fact that this is an old bottle I actually kind of enjoyed it. I wonder if a fresher bottle might have more hops to counter the sweetness. Further research is surely warranted."
"Pours dark amber brown - full white foam settles to a thin layer with excess around the glass. Smell is all malt, minimal sweetness. All malt taste, notes of caramel, some sweetness. Smooth - little bite or bitter close, if any. East drinker, maybe a touch too sweet, but good."
"Overall I think it worth a go. See how it sits on your palate; this is the kind of brew you will be quaff on a regular basis if the unusual flavor makes it for you."
"Overall: Beer I would drink again but not necessarily seek it out. I am eager to try other beers from this brewery."
"I'm a fan of Baltika, and this beer is no exception. However, it is so smooth and easy drinking as to render it uninteresting. Still, worth a try, as are some of Baltika's other offerings."
"Overall a solid brew, and a pleasant surprise. I'd expected something a little more pedestrian based on the scores, but I dig this. Almost reminds me of a dark german lager. Pretty good stuff, and quite drinkable."
"I'm usually a fan of sweet beers, but this just takes it a little too far. Too sweet, too cloying, with not enough balance of bitterness and hops. Can't really stomach more than one serving of this."
"Picked up a .5L bottle for $1.90 in Astoria. This beer actually tastes more like a Vienna lager thanks to the spicy hop finish. The beer starts with a big caramel flavor with a toasty edge. From a corporate lager, I didn't expect much, but this had a balance from Euro pepper and lemon hops. The body is a touch thick to be really drinkable, but I'd have a few."
"Copper pour with a creamy off-white head. Aroma is sweet and malty with some hints of raisins and cookie dough. Flavor is sweet and malty at the beginning with a good hint of dough and raisins near the middle. Finishes sweet with some hints of apple skins. Alcohol warms. Quite a nice beer."
"D: i really enjoy most of the baltika beers and this one was no exception, very tasty and would probably buy again"
"D: Very drinkable, might have to let the wife try."
"Let me just say, this isn't a bad beer by any means...I've had far more disgusting brews. That being said, this beer really falls short in the taste category. Seeing as I don't have any general characteristics upon which to base Euro Dark Lagers, I can only go by what I know...and I know this should be darker, meatier and foamier."
"This beer was relatively cheap (compared to other single bombers I usually pick up) was not expecting much out of this but I was very impressed."
"It definately tastes better than it smells, just like Tika the Guinea Piggie, LOL. But having only tasted two Baltika's so far, I bet this one is going to be my favorite for sure. Remember, I'm a weirdo Shiner drinker from Texas, so base your judgement of my review on that. But I can assure Shiner lovers that the chances of them enjoying this beer are quite high."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer (and the large bottle!) and was left wanting more."
"Drinkability: Taste is not bad, however it's not anything special either. That combined with the watery finish makes it something that I don't think I'll buy again."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and hops. Taste is of malts, caramel, hops, slightly sweet, good flavor. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality brew."
"Average brew. Much sweeter than I was expecting."
"The beer pours an amber-brown color with a tan head. The aroma is actually pretty nice. I get notes of grapes, toffee, biscuits and iced tea. The flavor is similar, but a little more exciting. In addition to the dominant toffee malt characteristics, I get earthy and grassy hops, caramel, honey and graham crackers. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad at all."
"Drinkability: this beer is better than I was anticipating. I rather like the flavor, feel and smell of this beer; it might have to go into rotation around here."
"D: Baltika 4 and 6 are two beers I would consider sessionable."
"I have a hard time imagining be able to drink this all night (as it is I only have one bottle and can test this hypothesis). The sweetness is a bit much, but the spice does provide some balance. A dark lager? I am not sure."
"Carb is a little too soft for such a sweet beverage. Body is medium, drinkability nothing to write home about, but won't have much trouble finishing this one."
"DB- Cheap stuff, wanted to try some of their offerings. The flavor has its good points but is a bit sweet, certainly a refreshing dark lager. Not bad for what it is."
"Drinkability is very good. Great beer all around."
"Medium brown brew reveals red highlights against a light. 1"" of light tan head settles quickly to virtually nothing. Nose is overpowering with sweet burnt caramel. Taste is exactly the same and that's about it. Very simple and boring, pretty terrible. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, rather smooth, light carbonation. Finishes with the same burnt caramel with a bit of licorice."
"I would have imagined Russian beers to not be of good quality, but this changed my perception"
"Overall, this is definitely an enjoyable beer, especially for the price. I have yet to be disappointed with Baltika brews, and this one is no exeception."
"Drinkability: This beer certainly isn't bad, but it lacks depth that keeps it from being a quality beer. It's cheap, though, and definitely worth a try."
"Tasted watered down. No hints of caramel that is usually present. I expect more substance from my dark lagers. Fairly unremarkable."
"Not a beer to be recommended, but some may like it."
"I like several of the Baltika brews, this one is ok. Won't be revisiting with examples like Hofbrau or Spaten Dunkel on hand."
"Didn't really enjoy the experience, should of spend my Euro's on a Belgian beer."
"Beer is smooth and nice. Finishes cleanly with no aftertaste. There is a mild sweetness up front and not a whole lot in the back. This is a very drinkable beer overall mouthfeel is good but the flavor is a little mild. Second taste, I'm bumping the flavor up. Its reasonably sweet and has a hint of roast at the end but its not distracting. I like this beer. I tihnk Baltika is criminally underrated on this website. Shame on you."
"16.9 oz bottle picked up locally, well chilled, let's give a whirl. Bottle smell is some molasses some sweet malt almost smells like a dubbel, not much hopping. Pours to an opaque medium brown with a thin quickly disappearing head. Taste is heavy, thick and sweet. A dark lager? This is more like a tripel. Lots of molasses and brown sugar. Great thick mouthfeel and body but woah, sweet. Too sweet for me. This would probably go good with some really spicy food but alone its tough to swill."
"Drinkability: I find this beer to be cloyingly sweet and too malty. One is enough as the combination just does not work for me."
"Baltika 4 is a very clear, sparkling, brown beer with a thin, bubbly, blotchy, off white head that leaves nice lacing. It has a very sweet aroma... like wort boiling. It also kind of reminds me of brown sugar and sorghum. It's medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. It's pretty sweet and nutty. It's a very simple malt flavor with a slight hint of grassy bitterness. It's a sweet and simple affair."
"This beer pours a clear watery dark amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel, and hints of chocolate. It is a pleasant aroma. The taste is much like the aroma. It lacks any sort of complexity, but is mildly interesting. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that is a little too low. Overall, this is a decent beer that I could drink again."
"Notes: This is a very approachable European lager, however it has enough hop presence to distinguish itself. It has all that nice easy body and slight caramel malt, however, it actually has a hop presence which most don't."
"D-the high carbonation makes this a rough sip. Not a bad taste but could be smoother."
"Overall: Not a very good beer in terms of taste. I would advise you to buy it for two reasons: The color is excellent and worth pouring just to see, and the packaging also is intriguing and artistic."
"A sweet lager which I don't find incredibly pleasant to drink. It hits pretty much all the marks for the style though and is a decent representation of what it should be."
"Carbonation is too low, and lets the sweetness run rampant."
"Overall, the beer is ok but nothing like I thought it would taste with the name dark lager. Its more like a light ale."
"There's a good balance of crispness and smoothness is a well-rounded mouthfeel complimented by a carbonation that's just the right level in a medium to full body."
"Again, my thanks to Mike and Ranee for the gift."
"Offers enough structure to hold its own and shows no obvious weakness."
"Smooth, creamy and full-bodied. Very good, just wish it looked a little better. But that is the least of my concerns."
"D big time YES. ""can i have another sir?"""
"NOTES: BBCSD-0908-GeoffV"
"Sort of a chestnut colour, a bit translucent, slightly chill hazed. The beige cap fell after a few minutes to a lingering collar. Not much in the way of lacing. Aromas of cereal grain, barley husk, caramel, and a kiss of hops. Malty, grainy sweetness with a little buttery toffee and chocolate adding some depth. Bitterness was low, but still present, and hop flavour was just noticeable in the finish. Lingering sugary caramel with light bitterness. Lightish body with average carbonation, some residual sugar. Decent, but fairly average."
"Cheers!"
"FInal thoughts: Starts with a slightly watery, toasted malty, slightly fruity, crisp and refreshing drink for summer, then adds all kinds of weird flavors on the finish that only go away when you drink more, which makes you drunk faster so I guess it somewhat does its job."
"A beautiful deep copper colour with sweet molasses notes in the aroma. Head is not persistent but overall impressions were promising. Flavour is sweet malt/treacle and bread offset with a moderate carbonation and enough hop to prevent cloying. Quite enjoyable but the sweetness reduces the drinkability a little. It kind of reminds me of Barons Black Wattle though they are different beers. Hmm."
"relatively light mouthfeel. crispy toward the end. maybe a bit flat in the carbonation. good drinkability."
"Overall a tasty dark lager."
"T/M: Light body, lacking punch until the very end. It is water-like until it hits the back of the tongue, then the carbonation comes through. Same buttery malts from the nose are present on the palate. A faint hint of hops balances out the caramel and butterscotch malts. Finally a touch of banana finishes her off in the aftertaste."
"overall/drinkability - good - i can see buying this again - reminds of brown ales and better then alot - the best baltika i have had yet! and a few months past its prime???"
"Overall, it's the best Baltika I've had, but that's only out of 4. I will have to try more from this Russian brewery asap."
"The foam was med. wheat in color, semi thick and dissapated rather quickly. The color was dark ruby red, amber highlights with a mahogany undertone. The smell was hoppy and dark fruity undertones. It has a deep lager taste with a hint of carmel. Mouthfeel - med. to full-bodied - a good throwdown. Drinkability - deep and smooth - a good session."
"Looks red and perfectly clear. Smells almost syrupy malty, which it is. Tastes of oodles of pure malt, with just a hint of odd metallic astringency holding it back. A no frills, straightforward, uncomplicated lager."
"Picked up a bottle for $2.25 at Blanchard's in Allston. Poured into a tall lager glass. Tons of carbonation, with bubbles coating most sides of the glass. Sunset red color. Fluffy white head that remained afloat for a lot longer than expected. Smell was of faint traces of cherry and licorice. Taste was dominated by malt. That pretty much took over the beer from there. This beer was also a bit more watery than I would at guessed after my first glance. No really harsh aftertaste or anything, combined with a decent abv, makes this beer fairly drinkable. This was my first Baltika from what I can remember, and it was a pleasant surprise."
"This is a pretty extreme beer as far as I'm concerned. I can't even notice any hops, just very, very sweet and malty - it clogs the throat with its insanity. Too much for more than a sip, or a drizzle over a rich and heavy dessert."
"Surprisingly refreshing although there is that deep, sticky flavour of spicy raisins on the mid-palate. I think it's just too cold. Waiting for it to warm up now... Still waiting.... Okay, slightly sour on the front, very fruity, with overtones of burnt toffee throughout. Hint of artificial lemon flavour towards the back, like those lemon sherbet lollies (without the sherbet). The dominant flavour though, is that toffee, raisin character. Very heavy for breakfast. Very sweet and heavy, but very good in the mouthfeel. I'd rather have this in my mouth than Saddam's cock. Not all that drinkable this early in the morning, but that's my fucking fault for drinking it this early in the morning."
"D - Average at best. Would not drink a bunch of them."
"Pours a very attractive ruby hue with a tan head that dissipates quickly. Smells of toasty and fruity malts that promise a lot of sweet flavors to come. It is definitely sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Maraschino cherry-like taste, with lots of toasty and carmelly malts; it has a distinct spiciness that is hard to describe but makes it more interesting. It could definitely use some more hops to give it a nice roundness but it is quite good nonetheless. I would rate its taste higher if not for a small but pesky taste of alchol that should not be detectable in a beer with this abv level. Along with the hefeweizen and porter, this is one of my favorite Baltikas."
"D: This one is a lot sweeter than I expected. Nothing wrong with a cold sweet iced tea but, this is not really what I want from a ""dark lager""."
"Light and easily drinkable. I could certainly revisit this beer or have a couple bottles per sitting."
"Pretty tasty dark lager and by far the most flavorful I've had from Baltika."
"D - the flavor and aroma are not anything amazing, but I would consider picking up a few of these if I wanted to drink heavily. It's very easy drinking and it by no measure tastes bad, to me at least."
"a cloudy tea in color with a small beige colored head and no lace to speak of. smell is much better with caramel and candy and strong tea aromas present. taste is same with flavors melding together nicely. mouthfeel and carbonation good. russian beers keep surprising me. i would buy this beer again any time."
"Pours a clear reddish brown colored body with an off-white head, big and lasting. Has an aroma of roasted and chocolate notes. A malty grainy nose too. Some strawberry fruitiness too. Fruity grainy roasted taste. Strawberry and some chocolate too, creaminess too. Some hotness. Lagery tasting. Not bad tasting. Somewhat refreshing."
"A reddish tint to this drink with no head or lacing. Mocha, cocoa flavors mixed in a burnt malt aroma. Great taste with a slight cherry flavor mixed with the generally malty ingredient. A good mouthfeel makes it light, slightly creamy with a good carbonation. Overall, one of the best I had in the series."
"Drinkability: Not the most elegant, graceful beer around, but it's a reasonably tasty Eastern Europe brew and one of the standouts in the rogues gallery that is the Baltika line."
"Moutheel felt rather thin. Overall, I did not enjoy it too much, the beer is not bad, but it is quite unusual and did not appeal to my taste."
"D: I think this works better as a dunkel but still would have some faults even in this category especially with regards to aroma and taste. However if you are looking for a Russian beer at an affordable price this is a good beer for you."
"D - Good stuff overall. Unique enough to stand apart but tame enough to make for an easy drinking brew. Full of flavor and character, a pleasure to drink."
"Overly sweet and toasty taste for me. Kind of acrid and cardboard-y. Some hoodlum unfermented sugars crept up and stole the rims of this civic. Not very tasty, but certainly not a drain pour either. I like the other 3 Baltikas I've had better (8,9 and 6). The dark fruitiness is too prevalent for a lager, IMO. Get rid of some of that sweetness and they may have something."
"Unimpressed, even with its 89 score at BevMo. Pours clear brown with a minimal off-white head. Caramel, molasses, and dough inthe nose. Watery taste of the same, except with a bitter metallic bite that goes away as the beer warms. Did not live up to its billing."
"This big bottle pours amber leaning toward the reddish side of the spectrum. The large tan head has sank into a concave crater leaving big lacing,some of the thickest I've ever seen. The nose is malty with lots of sweet caramely aromas. The flavors are just as syrupy sweet as the nose hints at. Toasted honey oat flavors with mild hoppy spice,almost seems like some aged oak barrel(bourbon)flavorings as well. Medium body and gently carbonated,bordering on creamy. If this is the original,Baltika has a nice base to build from. This isn't going to blow anybody's mind,it is enjoyable and easy to drink,no complaints."
"Another pleasant surprise from Baltika, my expectations were low for this beer but it provided a tasty treat. Quite flavorful for a low strength lager, pleasant aroma also. Worth a try."
"Poured deep copper to brown with ruby highlights. Very light head that quickly settled into the glass. Aroma of malt, malt and more malt. Bready. Taste is very sweet with no noticeable hop component. Malt dominance carries through in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick and heavy with a vinous quality. Overall, decent but not my favorite. Malt presence is a little too heavy for my tastes, but if you like malty brews, you'll probably find it enjoyable."
"The beer sort of reminds me of a dumbed down version of becks dark, which is not a particularly impressive beer to begin with. However, this beer has less flavor and is even more watery then Beck's. Not good."
"D - Fairly drinkable, but the malt is a bit one dimensional."
"Drinkability is good. It's not the best beer I've had but all things considered ( including the sale price ) I'd drink it again without question."
"overall a fine beer, but not as good as others in its style."
"D - I think this is one of the better Baltika beers it has a good taste thats pretty easy to drink with a price thats dirt cheap for $1.75 you have to try it once"
"Poured a 16.9oz bottle into my brand spanking new, New Belgium globe. This really is surprisingly a pretty beer. When Poured it reminded me of all those fancy beer pictures you see on the cover of crappy beer books. This beer pours almost a brandy color with a 2 inch beige head that leaves little lacing. The aroma is raisins, malt and a little bit of roasted barley. The taste is caramel, raisins, and just a bit of barleywine after taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty creamy. Compared to the only other offering I've had from Baltika (#9 in a big 2 liter plastic bottle) this is heaven sent but on the range of good beer, this falls in the middle."
"Brown in color with gentle prickle and a wispy head. This review was done on a bottle although I had it on draft originally at the Russian House in Washington D.C.. It seemed much better to me when I had it on draft, but it may have been the ""romance"" of the moment. It has a malty nose with hints of lightly roasted malts. Fresh and smooth attack. Awkward taste at first but builds to a smooth malty flavor with pronounced chocolate. Clean finish. I would call this beer from a bottle a C+."
"Very average dunkel, which is fine with me. Good aroma of caramel malts, that is all I could pick up. Pours a rich amber color with a thick dissipating head that leaves no lacing. Relatively smooth mouthfeel, somewhat thin on the palate, and a good aftertaste. Flavor is solid, what your standard dark lager should be. I like this beer and the price is right so I will try to keeep a couple of these on hand."
"drinkability - Easy drinking, cheap overseas beer, think it was $1.50 for a single, good size bottle. Nice for a dark lager, easy on the ABV."
"Not very enjoyable. The light flavors allowed the imperfections to stick out."
"D - This is an okay dark lager. It was really sweet."
""
"D: A run of the mill dark lager, nothing stands out but nothing makes me turn away in disgust."
"Overall, this was a very good brew, nothing outstanding, but still very good. I agree with the other reviews on the richness and hardiness of this beer. Would be good for winter."
"Not a lot of depth, but a delicious beer and satisfying drink. Everything about this beer works together well. Recommended."
"Overall - this is a beer that is definitely worth a try. I got mine for less than $2 a bottle (a decent sized bottle too). It has the characteristic Baltika maltiness but even more so, since this is a darker version. Not for everyone, but those who like Baltika will enjoy it."
"D: Ok drinkability."
"I had never heard of a dark lager before, but this was a really interesting drink. I drank this straight from the bottle, so I'm not really sure what it looked like. However, it had a strong molasses flavor that was interesting and mostly enjoyable. Its mouthfeel was thicker than any of the other Baltikas. It was sweet at first, with a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. Interesting specialty beer."
"D- A slightly below par dark lager. I drank this beer quite a bit while in Russia and Uzbekistan, apparently my nostalgic thoughts were misplaced."
"D - This is an outstanding brew, but I don't think I could stomach more than one due to the outrageous sugary cake batter sweetness."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium, dark amber color with lots of brownish tan head and great tracing. Aromas of sweet caramel, melanoidin toastiness, light dark fruity aromas, and just a touch of hops. On the palate, it really opens up. Lots of sweet chocolate flavor, toasted bread, raisin, toffee, and a hint of spice. Hop flavor is close to none and bitterness is just barely there, not enough to keep up with the sweetness. Carbonation is medium low providing a rich malty mouthfeel. A little too sweet for my taste, hurting drinkability."
"With the introduction of a new Beer Department guy at the grocery, comes a few changes on the shelves. Fortunately, quality imported lagers are among his favorites; thanks for adding this to the stock, Aaron."
"Baltika #4 pours a nice, two-finger tan froth on a berry-brown body, well presented. The smell exudes berry and caramel, faint whiffs of malt, but is a little weak. The taste is better, a little more malty than the nose, and the mix of berry and caramel makes for a candyish taste without going overboard. The texture goes flat a bit early, a disappointment and resulting in a lower drinkability than it otherwise might have received. A fairly good beer that could use a little more carbonation and complexity."
"D: An interesting Dark Lager, a good buy at $1.99 a bottle, definitely drinkable, candy in a glass."
"This was my first Baltika brew and I was very surprised at how nice it was. The smell was of a sweet malt reminding me of a doppelbock. The taste had a great semi-sweet flavor with a very slight hop bitterness in the end to round it out nicely. The bitterness didn't linger at all in the finish. I will definatley be buying some more Baltika Dark Lager very soon."
"My first thought was that this dark lager was pretty much a watered-down Baltika porter. Maybe I should have had this before the porter."
"Highly recommended..."
"D- All in all not a bad beer, somewhat unique to what I have had before. Very drinkable would be good year round"
"next was the dark lager #4; pours a deep copper w/ aslight tan head, some lacing; good malty nose w/ notes of caramel & faint alcohol; good robust flavor, malty & sweet, like a marzen; good med body w/ just enough residual sweetness; I find this addition from baltika quite good, i could drink a gallon of this stuff easy..."
"No real fruit flavors, just thick malt sweetness with some prunes or raisins. Neither complex nor awe inspiring, but pleasant."
"Better than expected after reading the reviews. Sweet, with hints of raisins - strong malt, and no hops to speak of. A bit more alcohol taste than you would expect at 5.6%. Still prefer the Baltika Porter, but a good change of pace for a hophead like me. Great value at under $2 for more than a pint."
"A serviceable dunkel. Neutral to synthetic aroma. Brown without significant head. Lighter mouthfeel filled with carbonation. Noticeable soda-like taste because of syrup. Satisfies a thirtsty summer, but would not seek out again. Much better dunkel is available."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle. The beer pours a deep amber, forming a 1 inch creamy tan head. Good amount of light lacing along the glass. The aroma is light sweet malt. The taste is a good sweet malt nutty flavor up front, along with a light hint of fruitiness in the finish. Medium mouthfeel. Full flavor and smooth finish make for a very drinkable and sessionable ale. Overall, I enjoyed this brew more than I thought. Definitely worth drinking again."
"D - A style I haven't had much of but am appreciating as a very tasty session beer when I want malt over hops (as in now, in winter) without being full from a few like can happen with stouts, scotch ales and the like."
"The only real downside is the pricing. I've only seen this beer in bombers, and it's usually not cheap. Still, don't let that take away from this brew. It's excellent and multi-purpose."
"When I first poured it, I couldn't tell what color it was because there were so many carbonation bubbles that it blocked my eyes from peering into the beer. When they left, I saw that the beer is a murky brown, but when held up into the light, it was then a dark cranberry red color. It had a nice and fluffy 1 finger head of white foam that when it dissipated away, it decided to leave a small film of white foam, some white rings, and a just a small spatter of white sticky lace here and there. It had a light aroma of milk chocolate, caramel, toasted malts, and a small hint of peppery hops. When I swirled it around to see if I could get the aroma to wake up, this slight smell of vegetables came out from hiding. It didn't ruin the smell, but it didn't need to be there. Whatever you do, don't swirl it around to wake the aroma up. It had a very nice, light, gentle taste of milk chocolate, a touch of sweet caramel, toasted malts, and the slightest taste of hops at the end. I couldn't tell what kind of hops they were because the taste of hops was too small. The mouthfeel was nice and light with an aftertaste of clean water (that's good!), roasted and toasted malts, and a hint of milk chocolate. I think I might have found a new cheap ($1.80 for this big bottle) decent light beer. This was another one of those beers that I kept taking sip after sip and then finding out the I had just drank the whole bottle without even noticing it. I will get another bottle of this in the near future. I sure hope I don't break the bank if I buy another one."
"Nothing spectacular here, but I wouldn't turn down one either."
"An interesting beer, with a slightly unusual taste for this style. Worth trying (and it's pretty cheap too), but hardly anything spectacular."
"The drinkability is very good for those with an open mind. I like this brew a lot and fell that is is over looked and under rated. Prosit MK"
"Tried this beer tonight at the Bier Stein, Eugene, OR. Not nearly as dark as i would expect a dark lager to be, more of a dark amber. Thick creamy head. Slight sour taste, possibly the rye malt coming through. Tasted better than i thought it would to be honest. I smelled the faintest notes of apple. To me it seemed to have a fizzy texture, Not bubbly, but i would compare the texture to a witbier like hoegarden perhaps. Easy to drink."
"There is little carbonation in the flat but creamy brew, and while it's easy to drink it won't be my first choice upon next bottle-shop visit, nor a regular choice."
"There really are layers of flavors in this brew and I'm enjoying the discovery."
"Drinkability - not something I'd get regularly but it's a good drinker."
"Notes: Oddly enough, even though this beer wasn't great, for some reason it makes me look forward to trying the rest of the #'s in the Baltika line."
"Drinkability: I would have preferred to share this bottle. Glad I've had my first Russian beer, though. Won't seek this one out, though."
"beer #3 from the Baltika Challenge. tan head on a dark transparent beer. foamy head. smell is sweet and malty and a little sour. taste is sweet, maybe a little oversweet, slightly chocolately, malty, bready. pleasing flavor though overall. thicker than #2 and #3 and ok for the style. a good regular euro dark."
"Translucent brown, looks a whole lot like Coca-cola. Has a very tiny tan head, with some lacing. Nose is syrupy and sweet, malts and unroasted beans. Taste is sweet and malty. Slight coffee aftertaste, whole grains. Mouthfeel is decent and smooth. Ok drinkability. Not bad."
"Too sweet for me, will not buy again"
"Would pair brilliantly with any slow cooked, full flavored beef or pork dish, but certainly stuffed cabbage with a tomato based sauce would be great as well...Enjoy"
"I kinda want to compare this beer to German Dunkels because of the firm pilsner base that holds more maltiness than graininess, but with added amber grains. That said, the grains add a caramel and lightly toasted bread flavor, but not as much as good Dunkels. It's not as caramel-like or toffee-like as English Reds--just caught somewhere in between. An underlying sweetness is noticed, but undefined-- powder sugar-like. Not a bad beer, just remains a bit vague for me."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty drinkable beer, but would you want to considering the choices out there? It's worth a try for sure, and if you get a hold of a 6-pack you won't get bored of it, but better tasting beer is out there. I'd recommend trying Porter from Baltika, which is quite a delight.."
"Pours a deep orange-ish brown. Nice tight, creamy head that fades away, but clings to the glass. The smell is yeasty and a little malty. Tastes very sweet/malty. Tiny bit of bitterness with some hop flavor, but not enough to really make out what it is. Some citrus, so maybe cascade. Some caramel notes as well. It's thick and creamy. Some carbonation scraping on the tongue, but not too much. All in all it's very drinkable. I would buy it again."
"Drinkable. I could easily enjoy another."
"A smooth drink. And I really rather enjoyed it. I will definately be buying this again."
"Served in a pint glass, it pours a cloudy brown/orange color with an off-white fluffy head. I can only smell caramel and bready malts, not much else since the aroma isn't strong. It tastes the same way to me, like caramel and malt. It finishes slightly bitter, but the aftertaste doesn't linger for too long. The mouthfeel is slick, with a light/medium body. It is relatively easy to drink, with not too much carbonation. It's an OK beer, I guess. Nothing impressive, but it's not awful either. One day I'll have to try a fresher bottle of this. I'd drink this again, but I don't think this will become a regular beer for me."
"Despite its blandness and lack of anything special, it was somewhat drinkable, but that was due more to its water qualities than beer qualities."
"It used to be a very pleasant dark beer with substantial notes of rye, reminding to some of us home-made black bread... Sadly to say, quality has diminished in last two or three years and now No. 4 is another example of highly publicized crap from former USSR. There is an unpleasant tone in aroma, even more unpleasant sourness in the palate and quite a low-grade aftertaste. Stopped buying it. Not worth a try, definitely"
"The beers from Baltika brewery has been a pleasant surprise, just stay away for # 9 as that stuff is swill!"
"One finger tan head, moderate carb bubbles and reddish brown body. Coriander, pepper, bit of banana esters, not an overpowering aroma altogether. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, fizzy, slightly chewy, leads you to expect more out of this than what you get. Taste is overwhelmingly malt, maybe a hint of hops on the back end. Drinkable but not really impressive in any regard."
"Last swigs: Tastes like crunchy pretzels. Gotta dig the cheap big bottles of Baltika. Always an adventure. This is actually not bad."
"I've never tried a beer brewed in Russia before so this seemed like a nice change from the norm. Poured a cloudy brownish red color with no head and a very small white lacing that one could barely notice. Smell was very nice, dark fruits, honey, candy. Taste was even better with some sugars accentuating the flavors that had noticed in the smell. It also has an almost juicy character that one would not expect from the description on the back of the bottle. Mouthfeel was hoppy and medium bodied, with the hops hitting you up front leading into the juicy tastes. Seemed very well balanced as well. I could see myself drinking a few of these and still wanting more. Next time im at the Dan Murphy's im picking up some more of these as I was taken aback with the complexities rife within this interesting brew."
"Largish bottle, pours dull cloudy brown, unsightly largish bubble quickly deoparting head, next to no nose picked up. Pretty boring beer, sweetness picked up but minimal hops and flavor notes. Not worth the $1.49 I paid, I spilled 1/2 of this down the drain..not worth loosing the brain cells and adding girth to my belly"
"Drinkability: An unpretentious worker's beer for the booboisie. Something with a bit of taste, a bit of alcohol, and no nonsense of froofy flavours and aromas. Have it with borscht, pickled herrings, and black bread."
"Sweetness detracts from quaffability. Worth a try not a bad brew"
"This beer pours a dark orange with an off white head. The smell is malt and caramel. The taste is also malt and caramel with no apparent hop characteristics. It's not really my cup of tea so to speak, but it is interesting for what it is. Definitely not bad, I've been pleasantly surprised by the beers from this brewery, I really didn't have very high expectations, and while their beers are not spectacular, they certainly aren't bad either. Worth a try, I wouldn't go looking for this, but I wouldn't turn it down either."
"Received from Zorro in BCG BIF. A best before date of 31.03.06 is printed on the reverse label."
"Overall I would say it was Ok at the least, I would be willing to try this again, but by no means would go out on a hunt to find it again. People who hate bitter beers would probably like this alot."
"500 ml bottle. Baltika #4 pours out a brownish color with a small head. The aroma is sugary and nutty. Sweet molasses and nut flavor. Spices in the finish. No real hop flavors or bitterness. This is a sweet, sticky mess. The nutty flavors are nice, but the sweetness is cloying. Alcohol level is noticable and high. I became bored with this beer long before I reached the end of the half liter. Could be worse, but certainly nothing I'll ever buy again."
"Mouthfeel is thin to medium"
"Drinkability: An above average dark euro lager, pretty pleasing compared to what i was expecting."
"Definitely worth a try! At $2 per, this sweetness is just right."
"A thin brew, on the high carbonated side. Overall, not bad, just weak. Weak seems to be the defining word here. If offered, I would partake, just will not seek out for purchase."
"color is of powdered ice tea this beer has a nice dried fruit armoa especially raisins. its funny but a russian beer reminds me of irish soda bread with raisins. a inviting aroma for those cold russian summer nights.taste is simple, touch of fruit,touch of tea bit grainy in the mouth, definitly a cold climate beer, the aftertaste is very subtle but has a lasting effect. a good beer with dinner if you just need something to help wash down the food. i'd much rather enjoy this beer while camping in the fall and eating some stew out of a can."
"This is my first Baltika, but it won't be my last. Not too bad at all. I really don't think it's a true lager, but it tastes OK to me."
"Feel is clean and creamy within a medium sticky malt laden body. Not too sweet, it seems to fit just right for what it is. Which is pretty good all around in flavor, body, and drinkability. Just sweet enough with just the right amount of light dryness. A very nice little dark lager. Much better from other times I've ventured to try it. By far the best sample yet; helps to get it fresh. Well as fresh as it can get being from the otherside of the earth."
"poured a very cloudy, reddish brown color with moderate head. Smell is of caramel, mioxed with toasted malt. Taste follows through with carame. Also some molasses prsent. Too sweet for my taste, almost like a scottish ale, but not as good. finished with more sweetness. OK, but not something to try again."
"Drinkability: Although an interesting brew, ultimately this one becomes very difficult to finish; the hotness, carbonation and full body makes it very filling and the bitterness is not particularly enjoyable"
"The mouthfeel is rather light and clean, revealing its lager rather than ale background. But if you consider it a Vienna lager, it's pretty close to style. Overall good, but not great. I could session this, though."
"Baltika #4 is one of the better EDLs that I've had so far. It cleaves pretty closely to the style guidelines as I understand them and wins its drinker over with competence rather than flash. Batika is perhaps the best of the (former) Eastern Bloc breweries and continues to impress in a 'moderate expectations' kind of way."
"Drinkability: Lets just say one bottle is enough. While I enjoyed this beer I would definatly retire this after one. My dad took and a few sips and found it to be quite enjoyabe. Overall It was alright it was unique and worth trying."
"Pours a brilliantly clear ruby color when held up to the light. It is tipped by a frothy, slightly rocky light tan colored head. I smell aromas of thin grain, slight caramel, and a hint of toasted dark grain character. The beer has a light, filling fullness to it as it hits my palate for the first time. There is a light caramel sweetness here and it is joined by a slightly herbal, almost menthol like character. This beer has a slight character of aged malt in the finish, but other than this it is pretty clean. The finish on this beer is lightly sweet with a light, complimenting bitterness."
"Drinkability: Pleasant, although not earth-shattering, beer. I am glad that they began distributing this to Texas."
"Mouthfeel was very nice. Creamy, oily. enough carbonation to penetrate the taste into your gums Yumm... sticks to the roof of your mouth type of beer. Very solid dark lager."
"The mouthfeel is too light, and the sweetness gets annoying after a while."
"The beer is highly carbonated and goes down well. It is easy drinking and not bad. I think it should be re-labeled as an Oktoberfest/Marzen though."
"Mouthfeel is plesant though and easy drinkable, could just have litle more taste."
"Baltika #4 is dark brown in color with an above average-sized, light brown head. Retention is pretty good. The aroma is of dark caramel malts, very German in smell, but not as powerful as it could be. The taste is also very German-like. Very full and malty. Caramel and bready tastes with some sugary sweetness. This definently isn't a typical generic dark euro lager, there is plenty of ease in drinkability without sacrifice of flavor."
"Too sweet for my tastes, but a well-brewed beer, and the second best I've tasted of the Baltika line (after the Wheat)."
"Poured a distinct translucent amber with a 2 finger tan head that slooowly dissipated leaving a cover on top and some lacing . Aroma of bread and dark fruits? Taste was malty and fruity with medium body and a slightly bitter finish. With all these semi obscure and very interesting beers on the market, I doubt I'll ever buy a macro again."
"the mouthfeel is smooth rich and creamy. drinkability, is for me, fantastic, I love the rye bread flavor I percieve, easily one of the best Euro-Lagers I've had, would make a nice session brew."
"Drinkability  This was on the lighter side of the EDLs that Ive had, but it was very tasty and made for a great mid-afternoon snack."
"I told myself this would be the final Baltika beer I'd try -- but I enjoyed this one, especially when it was cold. Really enjoyed this ""dark lager"" chilled."
"D- A nice mellow all malt brew that is well built but not very interesting. There is no depth to the malt and no hops or alcohol to support it. It also had a powerful carbonation that detracted from the brew."
"The beer pours a deep rosey amber color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is raisiney and bready and caramel sweet. The flavor is right there with the nose. Big bit of riasiney, very slight roasted in the background. Not bad. The feel is a little thin for the flavor. I want a more robust feel on it. Overall, this is an okay beer. I'm not really going back to it as fast as I would a better beer."
"Starts with a big frothy head that hangs around, atop a good amber body. Happy little ""beer"" smell, slightly better than your average ""dark"" beer. Taste is a little bit biscuity, but mouthfeel is somewhat watery. Its labaled as ""Original," some presumably this was the first style for this brand, but tellingly their advertising pushes the ""3" pale lager. An alcohol burn sneaked up on me as I got to the bottom of my .5 liter serving."
"drinkability is average, i'd drink it again but i'd drink a lot of things again, definitely not bad."
"poured a yellow copper color with a light tan medium sized head that stayed around for a while with some good lacing. aroma got a little molasses, malts maybe honey slight bitterness. flavor was about the same. not to bad of a beer but noy overly impressed by it"
"I was tremendously impressed with this one. For those who seemed skeptical, perhaps this just wasn't for them. I, however, was greatly impressed with this one. It poured a reddish brown colour. Very red, and crystal clear. About a 12mm thick head that quickly subsided to a thin haze. At this point, I'm still expecting mediocrity, perhap something even sub-standard. I gave my glass a swirl and took a smell. WOW...malt! ..and some sweetness, and that sweetness is un-deniably caramel. BIG sweet / caramel malt smell. The taste, too, was BIG malt and sweet. A little nutiness on the finish. Very tasty! I am greatly impressed. Smooth mouthfeel. Little to none carbonation/carbonation""sting"". Nice smell, good taste, just plain satisfying. Do try this out if given the chance."
"Honey colored with a thick quarter inch high head of beige foam. Or is that styrofoam? It's not really moving. Just sitting there. Full aroma of sweet malts and cinnamon, some light brown sugar, and some toffee and sweet pear. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel leads to a sweet malty flavor, a little syrupy. Only the second beer I've ever called cloying. There is molasses and sweet toffee, and tingly undercurrent of hops in the finish. A strange aftertaste lingers. Can't put my finger on that flavor, but it may keep me from finishing the bottle."
"I've been burned by several Russian (or insert variant former USSR entity here) beers, so I wasn't expecting too much from my first pass at this brewery. I guess my basic reaction is ""not too bad."" Chestnut amberish-brown, with a nice head that stayed a while. Some caramel and cane sugar in the flavor, pretty sweet but not over the top. Finish is clean. On the heavy-handed side for a lager, but still drinkable."
"This beer is a dark amber/ brown color with alight tan head that does not stick around for long. It has a malty sweet aroma with a hint of molasses. The first taste gives you that molasses witha hint of licorice. Followed by a more balanced maltyness with a slight hop spiceyness. Even after the distinctive flavors weaken by the middle of the bottle you are still left with a malty sweetness at the back of your tongue. Nice."
"This copper brown lager formed an attractive head when poured into a pint glass. There was little aroma, simple hints of grassy spices. The flavors were watery caramel, spices, and a lager yeast finish. While it wasn't impressive, this brew was quite easy to drink."
"Drinkable? NO! This is Crap! OK so this isn't OE 800 but it is BAD!"
"Sweet malty nose. Iced tea look in the pint glass. Decent reddish hued tan head on the pour. Sweet toffee/caramel taste with a slight burnt caramel finish. A little too much on the sweet side. Medium to lighter side on the mouth. Just too sweet for me... not balenced. enough to make it better than just average."
"Surprisingly, I found that I hadn't had this yet, and chose it to accompany Ukrainian meatballs at Karmancyk's Russian Deli in NordEast Minneapolis for lunch today, and they met each other well."
"A tasty beer that probably is better than my rating indicates. Nice malty flavor and smells pretty good. Goes down smooth with a nice aftertaste. Its weird that I can't come up with more to describe it. Its good, but nothing really stands out. I would buy it again."
"Very drinkable, will purchase again."
"Poured a nice dark copper brown with a slightly off-white head that stuck around for quite a ways into the glass. Smell is of caramel and toasted malts, hint of noble hops in the aroma, too. Taste is flat and unimpressive compared to the appearance and aroma. Big let-down. Bit of hops to lead things off, then when you expect the caramel and toasted malt flavors, you get a big hole filled with a vague malt flavor that never truly develops to its potential. Finishes off with a nice hop aftertaste, kinda like a bite, but more of a slow gnawing instead. Mouthfeel is alright, medium bodied. Very drinkable, but not too interesting to keep ordering round after round."
"Baltika #4 was a dark copper/red color. There was a big frothy head and some decent lace. It had a nice caramelly aroma with some hop bouquet. The taste was sweet and malty (caramel and a hint of molasses) with some hop bite. The finish was dry and slightly bitter. A pretty good, well-balanced beer with a bit of complexity to it."
"$1.99 a bottle."
"Pours with a two-fingered off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a little lace. Light carbonation. Medium bodied. Nice clear, deep amber. Nose is slightly malty. Starts smooth, malty and strong plum/raisin flavor, finishes smooth with hints of plum. A very good dark lager."
"Thin to medium mouthfeel with fizzy carbonation. Not one I'd drink a lot of."
"The color of the body is a thick and murky brownish black with an off biege colored head. Aroma is fairly subdued but presents carmel like aromas. Taste is much the same with an dominant carmel flavor over the normal chocolately and coffee tastes of a porter. Typical porter tastes take a back seat. Mouthfeel is full but by no means 'chewy'. One could drink alot of these but I felt that one, maybe two would be enough for me. It left a heavy aftertaste that surely would linger on for an evening."
"Pours a hazy, amber red color with a substantial amount of beige head fed by active carbonation. Sweet, caramely malts dominate the smell. A touch of bready yeast is present as well. Sweet from start to finish with a bit of bitterness and yeast toward the beginning. A decidedly unremarkable finish typical of many macro lagers. Mouthfeel is clean but also somewhat watered down. In terms of drinkability, this beer goes down easily, but it's probably not sufficiently interesting to find its way back into my fridge."
"After the excellent #6, this is a bit of a disappointment. Though not an awful beer, it's certainly not one I'd jump for."
"Its not even on the Ќяїѕтмдѕ Lїѕт for my worst enemy."
"Dark brown color. Small to medium head. Aroma is malty and sweet. A medium bodied dunkel. Malts are sweet and fruity. Hops are very mild and a touch spicy. Its overly sweet and very one-dimensional It much better than the strong ale, but its still only just marginally drinkable. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is very sweet."
"The beer pours a limpid deep mahogany color, the head impressive in size, frothy in consistency, the color a light tan with the lace a fine sheet. Nose is all malt, lightly sweet, as is the start with the top skeletal in feel. Finish is crisply acidic, the hops minimal, the aftertaste dry. Drinkable, but certainly not very impressive in any category."
"Brownish and dull appearance with a low bodied head that doesn't have much to keep it from falling in on itself. Minimal lacing properties. Aroma is decent, somewhat buttery with some accent of raisin. Malt is pretty sweet, bready, but somewhat thin in in overall impression, as well as the finely carbonated body. Creamy, slightly watery, without a lot of initial distinction other than overall sweetness. De-constructs slightly with a slightly sour tea-like hop underscoring the finish. Better beginning than end to this beer, but decently average and drinkable beer."
"Had worse, but had much, much better."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is fruity with a mixture of pale and crystal malts; a bit breadlike. The taste is decent, but not great. Again there is the balance between malts, but there is an annoying amount of bread taste here. It tastes like a dark whitbread ale. The mouthfeel is alright. I would like a little more carbonation and a lighter body. It drinks fairly well. This is my first Russian brewed ale."
"This bier was pretty good looking but when I drank it I wondered how something as dark as this could be so watery in taste. No real hoppiness at all in the nose or on the tongue. Caramel malts come through as well as some molasses. Finishes with a spicy alcohol taste. The finish is the best part of this one."
"When this beer was poured into my glass, it poured a large off-white head with fine-small bubbles. There was fizzy carbonation observed with this beer. The beer had excelent lacing. The body was clear and the hue was amber. The nose was malty and the flavor was somewhat bitter. The body is light and thin and the mouthfeel was smooth and thin. This is a very drinkable beer that goes down very easily. I hope to have the chance to drink this one again."
"Clear mohagony appearance. A thinish light bronw head adorns the top of the beer. A nice creamy looking collar accentuates. Lacing is spotty. The nose is a pleasureland of carmelized malts, toffee, molasses and rum cake. Very nice. The flavor doesn't live up to the nose, but is good nonetheless....just a tad bit watered down. I get carmelized malt, brown sugar, bitterness (roasted malt and hop attributed I believe) and toasted malt. A nice comination overall. Mouthfeel is creamy, body is about medium. A very respectable Russian dunkel. Damn, this is the second beer I've tried from this brewery I like. Time to get some more."
"Poured a clear red amber with a nice head that left way too soon. Big malt sweets dominate this brew. Fruity is there too. Balance is seemingly unwanted, but almost achieved. A spicy bitter is there, but I'm not sure it tastes all that much like a hop bitter. A drinkable beer, but nothing extra special."
"However, I'm not sure how Baltika's lighter incarnations would fare in my taste tests as this ""dark"" beer is really more of an amber."
"The bottle pops like a soda bottle when you open it - not a good sign. There's also too much foam in the head. The good news (so to speak) is that this too much head disappears very quickly. The remaining lace is Ok, but it slides down a bit too quickly. There is also a hint of sourness in the bouquet. (Maybe not the best bottle to judge by.) The color is a nice caramel malt, while the taste has a definite hoppy bite. The sour nose does not translate to the tongue. It is a bit thin in the mouth, but the hops persist, leaving a nice impression. This is a good, drinkable product."

"Pours a clear, orangish-copper with some reddish highlights and a creamy off-white head that holds well and maintains a thin surface covering throughout most of the glass. Some thin lace adds to its appearance. The aroma displays a bready, caramelish malt that's accentuated by a light touch of chocolate and some very mild herbal hops. The body is medium/light with a fine-bubbled carbonation that gently caresses the tongue. It's smooth and lightly creamy. The flavor offers some fairly well-attenuated, but still sweet, caramel/toasty malt with a thread of alcohol and a gently backing bitterness. It finishes dry with some lingering mildly toasty malt and a touch of alcohol. Overall, not a bad beer with some interesting character and a good drinkability."
"The Baltika 4 Baltika Original is labeled a ""Dark Beer"" and comes in at 5.6% alcohol by volume. From the 16.9 FL OZ bottle pours the dense, dark amber brew sporting a weak head. The flavor balance is toward the sweet side, with a big malty character matched to a big body and culminating in a clean, dry finish. Was expecting a little bit more from this dark beer."
"Pours with a nice looking light brown head over ever so slight hazy light brown/amber liquid. Nose is nicely malty/sweet, and fresh to boot! Taste is surprisingly good, sharp effervescence gives way to a crisp substantial maltiness. Notes of brown sugar tasted as well. Dries slightly in the finish from the somewhat subdued hopping, then sweetens up as it fades out. I wasn't expecting too much from this one, but I do say that I enjoyed this one until the last drop!"
"Smoky amber color. A rough pour produced a bubbly beige head, didn't last long at all. Some minor lacing. Thin and wispy head barely covers the top. Smell is faintly of toasted carmel malt. Taste is somewhat sweet, carmel malts, and added sugars. Not much hops to balance. Thin and watery, but not overly carbonated. Beer seems to thin out, and flavors evaporate as it warms slightly. Sweet malt and sugar finish lingers. Nothing really wrong with this beer, just a little away from being good."
"The bumpy, rocky, well retained head sits atop a garnet hued crystal clear brew.  The overall mellow aroma is comprised of herbal hops, dark caramel sweetness, and a hint of chocolate malt.  Malt sweetness persists at a high level from start to finish in this brew tapered only slightly by meager hop and roasted malt bitterness. Depth of malt character is lacking, w/ notes of dark Munich malt overshadowed by the strong sweetness.  That being said, sweetness never becomes cloying, and this brew retains decent drinkability.  Lightly bodied, w/ an underattenuated, sugary mouthfeel that lends an artificial fullness.  Finishes expectedly sweet, w/ light toasty malt on the back of the tongue.  Baltika dark, although lacking all around in character for a Dunkel, is a unique brew in itself.  Although it grew on me as I drank it, the sweetness is a touch overbearing."
"An attractive beer:  reddish-brown with a big tan head.  There is a noticeable metallic and astringent flaw in the beer, but it is drinkable.  Sweet, molasses and malt nose.  Not a lot of bitterness, and sometimes cloying.  Alcohol is pronounced for the concentration.  I didnt know what to expect (I bought the bottle simply because Id never had a Russian beer before.)"

"Pours a dark brown / amber in color. The aroma's were of fruit and caramel malt. The same on the palate (didn't really enjoy it). I may of had a bad bottle, I'm not sure, I did not inspect it well...I was sitting on the stoop with the neighbors. In any sense, I will have to re-review it."
"Notes: Quite and interesting brew, an oddity to enjoy perhaps. Not whole heartedly bad but not what one would expect in a beer in the traditional sense."
"Very rarely am I so rough on a beer but this stuff is god awful. It smelled like metal so bad that I could barely get past that. There was NO substance to the beer. Very flat and no taste. If anything, it tastes like it smelled. BAD!!! It did have a decent color though."
