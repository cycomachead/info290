"Like a pale lager initially but with more sweetness but from the middle on the beer improves on this with a lot of sweet malts & caramel. Not a classic but it is a nice one and certainly one worth trying, particularly if you can find it on-tap anywhere."

"Overall not nearly as good as most of the beers I had while in Prague. THis tasted more macro like, not a lot of care in the lagering, syrup adjuncts added which brought fake syrup tastes, fusel alcohol flavors despite the low abv, and the green bottle added a hint of skunk. I hope the other bottles aren't as poor as this or I'll be very disappointed."

"D- This is a pretty good beer, and my favorite to date of the Staropramen lineup."
"O - a fine mediumâ€”dark lager worth seeking out"
"Drinkable and pleasant poltmavy beer (as an European I am slightly irritated that there is very detailed classification of American beers on BA.com, but clearly distinct Czech brews are simply assigned very broad ""European"" styles). As much as I have some reservations against Staropramen brewery, I can not deny it is a well made beer."
"Overall-a unique beer, but it doesn't entirely come together for me, worth a try though."
"A rather good dark lager, interesting fruit associations."
"D: This is a very nice beer. I'll buy it again."
"Appearance is deep brown red with orangish hues. Head doesn't stick around too long and fills the nose with bready malts that are sweet, but not in the molasses way. Almost some citric oj notes come through. Flavor is much the same. Easy to throw back on an empty stomach and entertaining enough to repeat again and again."
"D: This is my kind of lager. I'm a stout guy but I'd much order this again rather than try to pair my bratwurst with Guinness."
"Drinkability: Overall a good beer. Not my favorite dark lager, but a good choice nonetheless."
"drinkability: staropramen has something interesting beers. notning compares to this. I liked though."
"Interesting beer, not only worth a try but sincerely recommended."
"A red beer, with lace. Bit of malt and cheese in aroma. Decent Vienna. Appropriate carbonation, medium mouthfeel. Slight bitterness and mdoerate sweetness.In the sip there is a touch of fruit, barley,toast,hop. All around balanced. I can drink one, though only the one."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Medium-light body."
"D: overall it's an interesting beer with a nice presentation. O.K. polotmave beer it is."
"Overall, a Czech pils with some roasted notes. Not very exciting."
"Pours a dark translucent gold color. There is a very light smell which is similar to regular StaroPramen, like the classic lager. The taste however is much more complex that most lagers. It is mildly malty and light on the hops. The thing that surprised me is the layers which the taste hits you, very unexpected from a Staropramen brand. Great overall for heavy drinkers of light sippers."
"Draught at the brewery beer hall. Served too cold, in the appropriate stylish glass. The beer has a beautiful amber colour, served with a moderate head. Fruity aroma with hints of caramel. Some caramel in the flavour too, but not really sweet. Nutty. Tolerably well hopped."
"This is an interested brew...reminds me of some of the other brews I had in Europe made with hop-extract (Ceres), though somewhat better. A decent beer...better than but compares to something like Heinekin, Amstel, or St.Pauli ""Dark""."
"Poured a clear orangish red under a thin short-lived tan head that left no collar and no lace. The nose is very mild, with just a touch of metallic hops. The mouth is well carbonated and medium-bodied, with just a touch of sweetness. The taste opens with a heavy malt taste, almost like syrup. The mild but metallic hops come out in the finish, particularly after you've had a few sips. The aftertaste gets stronger, with a mainly bitter impression. The taste grows on you."
