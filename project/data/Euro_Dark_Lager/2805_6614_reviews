"A touch of light sweetness alit on the palate, with subtle cocoa powder and dark choco action following. Had a smidge of roastyness and a little bitterness following. The choco notes lingered well, like a mocha milkshake. Quite nice! Zum wohl!"

"Beer is tart and dark, mildly dry finish, you know what I think it is? Brett o. I thought about this review and description for a couple of hours and this is what I landed on. I think this beer is made or finished with Brett o. It is only mildly tart but not funky, not heavy but light on that palate. I did not enjoy this beer as much as I hoped. I think Death and Taxes is a superior beer by far and I'm basically done with this. Thanks for another #1 (if it survives the spot after this review) but I don't think I'd have it again."
"Pours a dark brown with a light tan head and a bit of lacing. Thin collar. The nose brings a slight amount of roast as well as some mild hops and a slight acidic cherry character. The flavor is mostly malty with a bit of roast and some noticeable Continental hops. A bit of cherry there as well. Light body and slight acidity. Not bad at all, but not quite as good as the Moonlight dark lagers that I've come across. Interesting flavor and profile, though it doesn't quite measure up."
"Now, of course, a LOT of the enjoyment of this beer is the experience of where you're drinking it. With the accordion player or oompah loompah duo playing tunes, the servers constantly bringing you new glasses because they know you want one before you do, the other servers cajoling you into shots of cinnamon schnapps, and the beer cheese appetizer, you can't help but love this beer. Great color, great head, great smell, great feel, incredible taste."
"What a great beer and what a great place to enjoy it. I did not find it a tourist trap at all."
"D: The beer goes down very smoothly and is very sessionable."
"Only available on tap at the 2 places mentioned. A must have beer for the novice or the professional."
"Its a dark mahogany brown lager with a very rich blackish hue. Head is voluminous and voluptuous. Light aromas of roast malt, some candy sugar. Dry in taste, smooth, easy and pairs excellently with roast pork and dumplings. Well done all around."
"Did not even know Prague had the very dark lagers until I stumbled onto this beer. Even thought it was a stout at first, that's how similar it smelled, tasted, and felt. Would have to say this beer even beats out many stouts at what they do best."
"A complex blend of darker malt flavors. I can detect black patent grains. There is a good shot of hops at the swallow. The body is moderate with an above average level of carbonation. Frankly, this is a delicious treat."
"Dark in color and has a light full flavor taste. Perfect example of what a dark lager should be. I can't locals were saying this beer was going down hill. How much better can it be."
"This beer is very good for geting people into dark ale. Just a shame they don't export it. I picked up a glass and another for a mate at the shop."
"Dinkability : A very good beer not in the style ""Euro dark lager"" but Marzen (dark)"
"As stated before, U Fleku is a tourist trap you must visit in Prague. Avoid the awful liquor they put in front of you and expect you to pay for. More than one of these beers is too much."
"Finishes smooth and clean. Not too dry or sweet. Not that you'd notice though, since the waiter will have given you another before you've put the empty glass down..."
"Tourist trap prices and they stick a little glass of liqueur in front of you and expect you to pay for it, which is a little irritating. There are waitpersons lurking about with big trays of beer ready to stick another mug in front of you the moment you finish drinking. But this stuff is actually a little unique, and a trip to Prague would not be complete without drinking a mug or two of this interesting brew."
"As someone else said, I too was tired of drinking all the Pils so popular in Czech and Eastern Europe so when I walked in this place I was in heaven. Poured a dark brown color with a nice tan head. Nose was strong of roasted malt, which was welcoming. Also had notes of coffee and maybe some caramel. I came here several nights in a row and drank a lot of this. The drinkabilty is so high that even some friends who dont normally like ""dark"" beer were quaffing these down. I miss this beer."
"This beer was good so for me that I forgot to eat."
"Beautiful, unfiltered dark beer with very complex flavours. Has, if anything, improved since the brewery renovation in the mid-1980's. A good example of a Dunkles Maerzen, a style rare outside the Czech Republic and Franconia."
"Some bitter notes in the aftertaste, light liquorice, herbal bitterness. Not bad."
"On the palate, it's generally rich dark-malty and consists of almost all the elements as I could sense from its aroma, with a tinge of black-fruit's tartness and fruity hops which provide very good balance between sourness and sweet maltiness. But perhaps because it is served one degree too cold, some of the flavours really are kept at bay. The aftertaste is equally affected as well, I think--a bit short and light, with a little bit of brown-sugary, sticky mouthfeel left on the sides of my tongue which I am not so fond of. Overall, it's a medium-bodied, medium-rich flavoured (for lagers) dark beer, though, as an ale-goer, I'd expect it to have more assertive flavour and complexity to be really interesting. But that's just my biased opinion on beers in general, and I do think it can be a much more complex and enjoyable dark lager if served at a slightly higher temperature."
"This stuff looks quite good, deep deep, color, almost black, with a nice tan head to top it off. Smells good, lots of roasted malts, and a bit of coffee and chocolate thrown in as well. The taste is quite good as well. Nice clean and crisp as a lager should be, but with a hefty amount of flavor. Lots of roasted flavors with a bit of hoppy goodness to round it out. Medium carbonation. I could drink this stuff all night if it weren't so expensive. All around an excellent beer and definitely a must try while you're in prague."
"Draught at U Fleku. Served too cold. Very dark brown, nearly black colour - impenetrable for light. Moderate creamy tan head. Lovely aroma of leather and oak, dark chocolate and liquorice. Flavour is malty and moderately roasty, notes of dark chocolate and coffee. Never mind the inflated prices (by Czech standards), this beer is a must (at least once). And the liqueur we were forced to buy (which I drank AFTER the beer) actually tasted not-too-bad."
"The atmosphere was a little silly: a touristy rendition of an old beer hall complete with oom-pah tuba and accordion music, and the food was standard Czech fare. The waitpersons, however, circulate continuously with handfuls of mugs containing U Flecku ""House Beer."""
"It pours a dark brown with a lightish tinge around the edges and a light tan head. The aroma is buttery with some caramel and toffee, yet it is clean. The taste has some butter, caramel, some chocolate and is slightly sweet with a mild spiciness. There is low hops and bitterness, but it is smooth, clean and refreshing."
"The best dark beer in CZ to be sure."
"Really a great beer. If you make it to prague make sure to hit U Fleku just for the beer."
"Too bad the growlers at the pub are so darn expensive :-("
"The best beer i tasted during my 10-day trip to Prague and also the best dark beer i ever had. You can only find it in the ""U Fleku"" brewpub. A black coloured beer topped by a large tanned head. Aroma is malty and my nose also cought coffee hints. Taste is... HEAVEN. Damn this beer. It's excellent. If u ever find your self in Pague go to this pub just to taste the beer... It will worth it. Quite drinkable and strong mouthfeel. The ABV is ideal to spend some time at the pub drinking the ""U Fleku House Beer"". Excellent beer"
"A classic very drinkable dark Czech Lager, one of the best available in the Czech Republic in my opinion."
