"Cheers!"

"I have had this beer here several times, over the past few years, at this establishment.  It appears to be one of the restaurants staple beers.  The beer is a very nice, dark cola color that produced a very nice, thick, off-white head that is well retained.  The beer has a lighter, sweet malt aroma, as does the taste, but the taste is certainly more full.  The beer has a lighter feel to it.  It is smooth and creamy and good to the last drop.  This beer is really well done.  I am a huge fan."

"I was introduced to this beer at a social gathering so I wasn't really able to give it my full tasting experience attention but I liked it so much I decided to post.  For me the rich, dark ebony appearance was very appealing enhanced by the bottle packaging.  I didn't have access to proper tasting glassware but on direct pour some head appeared but quickly dissipated which was somewhat disappointing from an aesthetic standpoint but as I found out this in no way degraded the positive experience for me.  Also, the lower carbonation made it much lighter on the midsection.  Aroma was slightly raisiny, slightly chocolaty to me and again very inviting.  Initial wash over the tongue was smooth and creamy, with a pleasantly sweet aftertaste which I loved and just balanced with the right amount of bitterness.  Overall this beer for me is probably best in fall/winter months with bigger-flavored meals and would probably make for some fantastic recipes as well as complement some deserts but I thoroughly enjoyed it on a warmer evening."

"Overall: I tend to like dark European lagers, and this is among the better of them. I'd definitely have this again."

"500ml bottle. Pokal glass. Brown color, very dark amber tints to the light. Beige tan froth, close crown & correct retention. Roasted, sweettish aromas & slightly hoppy notes. Some metallic odors. Sweet malty syrup flavors & cloying sensation. Light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Watery texture. Sweetish finish & slight earthy bitterness. Flat & boring."

"O: This beer doesn't have a very complex taste, but it is rather easy to drink."

"500 ml. bottle, pours a dark brown colour, with a small off white head that dissipates soon, leaving a small lace. Smell is very weak, some coffee and caramel. Medium to light body and too much carbonation. Taste of caramel, chocolate, some coffee and coke."
"O -- A very nice beer that's a cross between a Munich Dunkel and a Schwarzbier. I would love to sample this fresh at the source, it's the type of Dark Lager I love to find."

"O: Being a Czech dark lager, I expected more Saaz hops. It's certainly well made, but like I said, it's just too sweet at the end of the day. Still pretty good."
"O Nice complexity and layers of flavors but, honestly a bit overpowering. The coffee is a little too dominating. If this were subdued a bit, the subtleties of the other flavors would work better in the overall scheme. However still good. Plays like a brown or a porter. The sour aftertaste was unsatisfying."

"Light molasses and sweetened coffee in the aroma, some toasted marshmallow and sweet grains and coarse yeast. Flavors are similarly lightly sweet, toasted grains, molasses and honeyed toast. Feels a bit thin but not out of place for the style. Easy to have several, certainly no chore to drink. Simple but tasty enough, worth trying."
"After enjoying the pils, figured I'd jump right into this guy, the cousin. It pours a clear dark sienna topped by over a finger of dusty wan khaki foam. The nose comprises husky barley and a touch of lightly watered-down maple syrup. It's insanely simplistic, yet still pleasant. Right on. The taste holds notes of darkly toasted malts, bruleed cocoa, and what seems like some blackstrap molasses. Things are darker, sweeter than I imagined, to say the least. Thing is, everything is too light to make it stick, so to speak, like a thick stout or porter would. I'm not sure what to think of this, frankly: Things are overly sweet, a bit too roasty-ish, a complete pendulum swing from the usual watered-down roast that normally finds its way into these Euro darks. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively dry finish. Overall, I just couldn't deal with the near-cloying sweetness of this beer. It was all too much."
