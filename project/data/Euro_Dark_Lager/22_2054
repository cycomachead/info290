It would be a great beer for a session drinker but not something I'd like to sit down and enjoy one or two of. Better than most Macros but that's really not saying much.","Haydn-Juby","Feb 15, 2013"

2.58,-11.3,3,2.5,2.5,2,3,"What we have here folks, is a more fizzy version of good ol' Rickard's Red. Why the good folks at Unibroue felt they needed to go down this road, can only be explained by marketing pie charts and the like. A pity.","biboergosum","Aug 07, 2009"
3.26,12,4,3,3.5,3,3,"My father-in-law picked up a six pack of this brew on a recent trip Quebec. I read the reviews of this beer and I am surprised it got such low marks. It's certainly not the best ale I have ever tasted, but In this reviewer's opinion it is in the "C" range. Like other reviewers, I did not like the screwcap. As for the taste, I won't waste your time with a begnign list of responses from the palate. I conclude by stating the follwing: "If given the choice between a Bud or U Rousse...I'll go for the U Rousse.","Dangerous","Sep 07, 2008"
2.36,-18.9,3,2,2.5,2,2.5,"U Rousse isn't revolting but it's nothing I'd ever recommend. It's weird to find such a poorly made offering from a brewery that was once known only for some of the world's greatest Belgian renditions and whose portfolio is otherwise world-class.","biegaman","Oct 25, 2007"
2.5,-14.1,3,3,2.5,2,2,"This beer, while certainly not offfensive, lacks a real well defined character; its a bit of this and a bit of that, and I think that's the problem with it. It's worth a try but doesn't go down as a particularly memorable beer in any event.","ThatWineGuy","Sep 29, 2007"
2.77,-4.8,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a deep red with almost no head or carbonation. Nose is very fruity mixed with that beery scent. Flavor is sweetened fruit, very lightly hopped. Overall the this is pretty thin and watery. Overall, a disappointment from Unibroue. Thanks to dherling for the bottle.","thaichile","May 04, 2007"
2.44,-16.2,3,1.5,2.5,3,3,"Overall -- bleh. Yeah, you heard me, bleh. My lowest review so far.","crwills","Nov 09, 2005"
3.15,8.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a crystal clear reddish brown, small white head forms, goes pretty quick. Smell is chocolate, sweet malt, honey, smells like a lager. Sweet honey, some crystal malt, a grassy skunkiness. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, high aggressive carbonation, another strange Unibroue, don't know why they still make the U line.","Viggo","Sep 15, 2005"
3.08,5.8,3,2.5,3,4,3.5,"Lose the clear bottle, and this could be a great everyday beer. Mild enough to have more than a couple, with enough flavor to keep me satisfied. Aside from the skunkiness, it was nice. Simple and easy going.","UnionMade","May 20, 2005"
2.64,-9.3,2,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Looks like tea. Tea has no head. Smells like apple must and spiced pumpkin. Tastes like sweet hokey caramel without enough hops to pull it off. Kinda thin, weak, boring. ZZZzzz.","waughbrew","Apr 21, 2005"
3.42,17.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This is a well made uncomplex all malt dunkel lager NOT some complex Unibroue belgian clone. If you come at this beer from any other frame of reference, you devalue your objectivity....and miss out on enjoying a lot of small batch micro lagers for what they are..","pootz","Mar 22, 2005"

2.68,-7.9,2.5,2,3,2.5,3,"This is not a particularly good beer. I had it on tap at my hotel in Montreal. It poured sort of a copper color, with little head retention. The taste is not very strong. It is a littbe but sweet with a slight malty taste pushing through. It is not unlike Killian's or a beer like that, with little taste, but not an offensive taste either. It's best attribute is that is a thirst-quencher.","bignick","Sep 10, 2004"
2.87,-1.4,2.5,3,3,2,3,"I expected so much more, but I can see the market that they are trying to appeal to. That said, I would have thought that Unibroue would not try to be a Sleemans and brew a world-class lager vs. a mediocre one. Still ... it's better than most basic lagers that are being made, fairly easy to drink and somewhat quenching.","Todd","Aug 06, 2004"
3,3.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Pretty average. I used my Bitburger glass with this one, pour looked like a twice dunked tea bag. Head was all in my face to start, but has wimped out and left a little bit floating on top. Aroma...trying to figure it out...smells like dried sweet malt with some ball bearings thrown in. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly under-carbonated (for my tastes), so there's some syrupy quality present. Taste is also a bit flat, with some bitterness covering up that sweet malt again. I did have some initial metallic notes with those first sips as well. I like lagers in general, but this one made me think: Unibroue, don't bother.","PatandDavid","Jul 21, 2004"
1.7,-41.6,2,2,1.5,2,1.5,"Feigning a viscous crispness, odd dextrins and a lingering metallic taste from start to finish. Carbonic and harsh with the grain. This beer was hard to finish and if this beer is axed I will not miss it at all.","Jason","Jun 14, 2004"
2.93,0.7,3.5,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Strange appearance overall, kind of a chill hazed iced tea color. Very nice head, 1/2 an inch on a medium hard pour. Good lace. Like U, a nutty aroma, slightly more pronounced and walnut-like with toasted oat tones. The flavor is very similar to U as well, malt-accented with slightly more caramel and butteriness than straight brown sugar. Hopping is minimal, white pepper in nuances. Since this beer is largely a repeat of U in many respects, it doesn't really rate as high in my book. Both are easy drinkers. Thanks to PatandDavid for this beer.","ADR","May 12, 2004"
3.3,13.4,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Bottle  Poured a light amber colored beer with a nice standard head with standard retention. Aroma is sweet with some nice malt easily detectable. Taste is very sweet, light and quite refreshing. This is not your usual Belgian Ale from Unibroue but more of a summer beer to drink on the patio.","Phyl21ca","Mar 01, 2004"
3.15,8.2,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"more balanced and better hops than U at a small price premium that is well worth it. Slightly more pleasing color than U but in same bottle. Lowest on Unibroue's quality scale is still better than any national brand. However distracts from their upper scale Belgium focus notables.","Sammy","Dec 03, 2003"
3.06,5.2,4,3,3,3,3,"Overall, this is a pretty boring attempt at an amber lager. Unibroue should stick to Belgians.","kbub6f","Jul 05, 2003"
