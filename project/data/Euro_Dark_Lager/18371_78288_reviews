"A really nice, just really pleasant beer from Pretty Things. I wish this style got more attention from breweries, it's awesome."
"A very drinkable toasty lager, the Lovely Saint Winefrede is a fairly dry, light-viscosity dark beer that's nonetheless bursting with burnt-caramel sweetness, warmed oak and maple seasoning, well-toasted brown bread textures, and a lot of medium-roast Colombian coffee qualities sprinkled around the flavor-complex.  It has a dry, espresso, biscuit, and booze nose; decent head that deflates over ten minutes or so; and a lurking buoyancy in the weight along the tongue that keeps this beer both afloat and tethered to its lager-heart.  Nonetheless, its clarion brown color, its not-fully-burnt, brown-malty-sweet backbone—which underlies the more burnt, coffee-tasting top-layers (which I assume result from the ""decoction"")—and its richly warm quaffability  hem Lovely Saint Winefride firmly in a ""brown"" frame of reference, despite its lager-premised creative process."
"Generally enjoyable beer. I'd drink it again but may not seek it out."
""
"This beer is more than the sum of its parts. An excellent and fully enjoyable brew the whole way through."

"Overall:  I have never never had a bad beer from Pretty Things but I have to admit I came to this bottle with low expectations but this beer has taught me a lesson not to judge a beer by its BA category; I am compelled by the complexity here - top notch"
""
"O: A very nice Euro-style lager with lots of maltiness and yeast character to go along with it. Great to sip on and enjoy, as it opens up and unfolds nicely as it warms. Definitely worth trying"

"Poured into a flute glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a thin light tan head that dissipates to a ring around the glass. Nice aroma of toasted malt and chocolate. Flavor is toasted malt, charred coffee and chocolate, light grassy hops. Medium bodied. A nice ale on the border between porter and brown ale, but with more char and chocolate than usually encountered in those two styles. I'm not sure that Euro dark lager is really very accurate for this more complex dark ale."

"M: Substantial! Thick. Nourishing."

"The beer style reminds of a porter with its chocolate and toffee tastes and smells. Overall, St. Winny is an okay beer but I'll probably lose her number."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Dark brown color, mahogany highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light coffee and chocolate, flavor is malty chocolate, light bakers chocolate at finish. $7.99 for a 22oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."
"O: Surprisingly good brew. It's basically an english brown lager. Toasted malt, nuttiness, a little smoke. Lagering it seems to have made it super smooth though, thus extremely drinkable. Great variety and balance of flavors. I enjoy brown ales in general so I'm a little biased. Another nice beer from Pretty Things."

"The beer pours a dark brown, and sits in the glass as almost black with a deep maroon tint to it and a rocky finger width sandy head made of medium sized bubbles that smooth out on top to create a creamy texture. The body is lager clean and full of racing bubbles that refill the head. The beer’s lacing is dry and sticky on the sides of the glass, leaving thick sheet on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells warmly roasty with hints of coffee, bakers chocolate, and nice nutty scents. Theirs a slight metallic tinge to the smell, presumably coming from the lager yeast. It is a pleasing yet clean smell. On the tongue, the beer tastes roasted sweet and bitter with a faint hint of an acidic tingle. The balance between hoppy bitter and a roasted bitter seems to be well played out in this beer. The flavor begins with roasted nut flavors and a touch of char. The finish is oddly dampered and mellow compared to the rest of the taste, bringing light sweet bread flavors to mind with a hint of raisin and date dark fruit flavors. The aftertaste returns to the roast of the malts, which touch slightly charred flavors. As the beer warms, the dark fruit flavors rise in the mouth and linger in the aftertaste. On the mouth, the beer feels clean and crisp on the mouth. It feels on the high end of light in body, and leaves the mouth with a nice light dry roast in the mouth. Overall, this is a lovely dark lager with some really nice roasty malt qualities. I think its timing in release is perfect, as Pretty Things releases it just as winter begins to loosen its grip on the land. The beer is light and drinkable, but with some lovely dark beer roast flavors and nuances. The touch of dark fruit on the finish adds a lovely layer of complexity to this beer, and reminds me slightly of Triple Bag by Long Trail, on lighter. This beer is delicious and quite drinkable. Try it."

"Dark chestnut with a 1"" dense tan/beige cap that produced solid sheets of very sticky lace. Good head retention too. Enjoyable aroma with a rich maltiness, dry roast and floral notes, a bit of yeasty sharpness, a bit nutty with a hint of toffee. Roasty flavour with medium/low bitterness. Light floral hoppiness with bread and malt character nicely balanced to keep it from being overly sweet. Mild toffee and cocoa. Grassy bitterness in the finish. Medium to full body with creamy carbonation, slight astringency. Nice texture overall. This was an enjoyable beer and I would purchase it again. The only thing that seemed slightly out of balance was the pronounced bitterness in the finish."

"Overall: An example of the kind of lagers more brewers should be trying to create. Big, powerful, and packed full of flavor, Pretty Things shows that these often overlooked styles can deliver when done right."
"o: this is a very nice lager that i recommend to everyone. it says it's brewed to mark the end of winter but this would be just as nice in the fall around a fire."
"O: A bigger, bock-like beer with a deep and complex malt character owing to the decoction mashing. It has shades of a big English Brown ale to it as well, though it is very clean. This beer begs to be paired with a game stew."

"O: The flavors of earthy hops—particularly those that persist through the finish—don't make this one of the easiest beers to drink, but it a rather interesting beer to sip."

"O - Overall this is a good beer but not my favourite from Pretty Things."
"All up: really lovely stuff. In no way comparable to the generic Euro Darks which share its classification. In fact, this has the complexity and style of the better doppelbocks (if perhaps losing something of the booze and sweetness). Don't let the classification put you off: this is very good indeed."
"O: Beautifully-crafted, but sweet to a fault, Lovely Saint Winefride hits an interesting high in the dark lager style. I wouldn’t buy it again, but it was a nice drink."
""
"O - An excellent Brown/Dark Lager. I am a fan of this style and this one really hits the mark. The malty sweetness and body really are excellent. Would love to have this one again...good stuff."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice Dark Lager. The flavors are really nicely balanced and complex. I like the bit of nuttiness and dark fruit."
"D - This was surprisingly enjoyable. I had low expectations, but this was a very nice brown lager and was a nice palate cleanser among the sours and stouts we had. Would gladly drink this again."
"O: Pretty good. A lot like the standard brown ale, but with a lot lighter body. For a style I don't drink very often, I certainly enjoyed this one."
"A somewhat transluscent but dark brown color with a healthy light brown head and very decent lacing. The aroma is deep, near charcoal swampy brown bread malt. A nice sour mash edge, nice. The flavor excites with unheard of earthy molasses, brown bread and bitter charcoal. There’s a nice grassy hop here that finishes a bit dry like a nice brown ale but delivers a certain bock-like quality and it is very drinkable from a chilled glass. Tart, malty, medium-light bodied with a dry edge and modest but entirely adequate carbonation. A great lager brew. Unique!"
"Overall this is quite a treat, best dark lager I've ever had."
""
""
"O: Interesting. Too roasty for my liking for this style, but at least this beer was different and unique."

"Delicious, no real category for this, very unique."

"22 oz bottle from Best Damn in San Diego. As always, an interesting offering from Pretty Things."
"Other than the husky astringent qualities of the bitterness, I quite like this beer. I think it is going to be a seasonal release. I would definitely look for it again next year."

"Taste starts malty, with a burnt chewy texture to the middle, and closes with some warmth and a lasting bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, and drinkability is good as well. Nice brew overall."
" The taste of this is not like most lagers...more bock-like with some gentle raisin and slight toasted malt with a light nutty roasted tinge with more spice as it goes on. The hops have a very herbal quality and lasting bite as they increasingly take over the malt from mid-taste until the dry finish. Each taste starts the ride over again with the malt in front and keeps a decent amount of chewy and almost biscuit-like tastes. Overall I enjoyed this for what it is- a unique lager with higher than average hop presence. It is kind of like a brown pilsner or hoppy bock depending which way your palate favors. I like that it is a style bender."
""
"This is pretty good; a nice dark lager, like a less estery brown ale."
"The body is a bit heavy and somewhat chewy. Soft carbonation. Overall real tasty stuff here. Glad to try it and would grab this again."
""

"Mouthfeel is decent- full bodied, chewy, with medium light carbonation. Good beer- wouldn't get it again if I'm looking for a lager but maybe if I'm looking for a good dark brew."
"Overall: A cross between Saint Botolphs and and English Brown. Not a bad beer as it has moments of real depth and complexity. I have been blown away by several Pretty Things brews, however this one just struck me as just above average. Not likely to get this one again."
"22oz bottle served in a pilsener glass at 53 degrees. Pours a semi-hazy brown with red highlights when backlit. Head is one inch, dense and cream-colored and eventually settles into a creamy, broken slick. Thick, textured rings of lacing coat the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses toasted malts, a nutty character and a trace of wet cardboard - reminds me of a nut brown ale. Taste consistent with nose, although thankfully no wet cardboard. I have to say that the flavor profile is very well-rounded. There's is almost a nutty sweetness, but a pleasant, light,earthy hops bittering peaks out and cuts it to keep it from being cloying. There's also a slight ashiness or char towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a consistent carbonation level that falls just short of lively. There's also a slight acidity present. Overall, I can't say that I am rating this to style; however, I did quite enjoy this beer. As previously stated, this beer had a lot of qualities reminiscent of a nut brown ale, in my opinion. That said, I found it really well-balanced and quite drinkable. The $7.99 pricetag would probably keep me from buying this beer on a regular basis, but it has definitely piqued my interest in exploring this style further."

"Tastey beer with character and punch but a bit outside of what might be expected for this style."
"Feel is at a pretty much medium. There is some life in the carb and the aftertaste is lingering. I have never had an off bottle of pretty things, they know how to tweak the carb per style, which is English dominated from what I've seen. I love these guys."
"Another quality offering from Pretty Things. nothing quite falls into traditional style guidelines, but nothing is too extreme as to be hard to drink. a bit pricey, but that's nitpicking."
"The flavor is an improvement: Darker malts predominate the smell. There's a good hop counterpoint. The unpleasant smell comes back in the swallow, but the aftertaste has an enjoyable bitterness. The body is as would be expected; the carbonation is similarly neutral."

"I'm looking forward to the day I'm a crazy old man who sits on the porch and yells at the world passing by. I could do it with this beer in hand."
"The alcohol was right on target as I couldn't taste it but certainly felt it once I worked my way through the Bomber. There isn't a description for this category of beer on here and I had yet to try one from this style before tonight. With that being said, this was wonderful to try and had made me wonder why more beers like this aren't on the shelf. This taste probably leans too much toward the earthy aspect of bitterness for some drinkers but those who seek this out looking for deviance from the norm will not be disappointed. It may look like cola and have the initial taste of sasparilla but there's no doubt that this is a pretty thing unto itself. A perfect beer for this time of year!"
""
"Overall it's enjoyable but I was hoping for a little more. Too similar in experience to St. Botolphs and not quite as good for me to ever choose this over Botolphs."
"Overall a pretty nice beer, nice lager flavors and crispness, with nice brown toasty malts, nice hop kick, fairly bitter and tasty but a decent hop profile although maybe slightly too bitter and earthy, but otherwise pretty nice."

"Pint glass. Pours a deep brown with a big tan head; not much lacing. Smell is grain and herbs, some woody notes. Taste starts off with rich grainy notes, then some burnt toffee, then lots of charred bitterness. The burnt quality takes over as it warms. It's medium in body, moderately carbonated. A decent beer, but a little too strong and a little too burnt."
"O- a great and unique brew, I really enjoyed this one, nice and roasty toasty, great for the end of winter as is intended, nice but not overwheliming complexity, and a very nice drink ability, I would deffinatley recommend this one!!!"

"Extremely dark mahogany. From a distance it looks black. A small amount of foam is is left around the rim. Rich chocolate and coffee aroma. Slightly smokey. Flavor is heavy on roasted malts. Chocolate and coffee just like the aroma. Faint amounts of an earthy hop character but it is covered by the large amount of malts. Thin body and a big carbonation tingle but it has a subtle creamy mouthfeel. Soon after the big malt flavor a overwhelming bitterness sets in. Extremely earthy and dry. A bitterness that will not leave the back of my palate."
"A true winter brew. Lean on sweetness, big on bitter. I like this."
"O/D-Exceeded my expectations after I head this beer's description. But then I remembered that this was a Pretty Things brew and I remembered that they can do no wrong. Another bottle of liquid gold from PT."
"This is a mighty fine dark lager -- exactly the hearty, smooth, deliciousness other examples from the style seem to lack. I have to try it on draft, because this bottle was quick finished."
"Overall I am a big fan of Pretty Things and this is another great beer to add to their lineup. I highly recommend trying it if you find it."
"This Saint, even as a solid lager at 7%, could make you drink a few, perhaps causing you to do something stupid, or dare I say, lose your head."
