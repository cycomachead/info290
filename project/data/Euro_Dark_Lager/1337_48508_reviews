"500ml bottle. Pours a dark rusty brown with a medium lasting beige head. Aroma and taste is sweet dark caramel malt and grains, some mild dark fruit notes and yeast with light bitterness. Palate is a medium body, smooth with good carbonation. The finish is dark malted grains and caramel, some toasted malt and yeast, with mild dark fruit flavor and soft bitterness on the end for balance. A very good caramel malt character. Overall this is a well balanced, tasty and enjoyable brew any time, very good brew."

"Grainy and earthy enough to satisfy the lager drinkers with caramel and molasses notes that will please brown ale fans and enough hop bitterness to keep the IPA lovers happy. Easy drinking and accessible to fans of any beer style."

"When I got home I was unbelievably impressed. Great pour, great smell, amazing head (how many times are we actually able to say that in our lives?). It was rich, malty, hoppy, and dark. Honey, dark caramel, chocolate, fall leaves and burnt hay. Just fantastic."
"Overall: For a EDL, I enjoyed it. I'll revisit thus again."

"One of the best lagers I have ever tasted, I only sought this after seeing it being made on the Beer Geeks TV show. Great on tap at the brewery, where I was told I would not be able to find it in bottle shops. Heh - that may have been true in SD, but in LA, I tracked a couple down. Still tasty as hell."

"this beer is disgusting. i love the idea, but the execution is appalling really. granted, my bottle had a little date on it, and may have deteriorated some, but i cannot imagine a great beer ever lived in here. sticky brown caramel color with some tan suds. the nose is sweet malt, but not fresh and harvest grainy, but more a euro extract thing, like a home brewers extract. no hops at all in nose or taste, but thats there least of the worries here. the flavor is an acrid funk that turns into unfermented sweetness. old taffy and gum and gross fair candy come to the forefront, behind stale grain and other off flavors. hard to believe this is rated as high as it is. thick and textured for a lager, although carbonation is fine. the price is right on some of these port bombers, but as much as midnight expression made my day for being so awesome and cheap, this one turned me right back off. if you can make older viscosity, you can do better than this."

"22 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 3/13/2013. Pours lightly hazy deep reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, toast, cocoa, brown sugar, pear, apple, roasted malt, light coffee, light smoke, floral, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted malt notes with light-moderate yeast esters; and good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toast, brown sugar, cocoa, roasted malt, pear, apple, light smoke, light coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toast, cocoa, brown sugar, light fruits, smoke, light coffee, floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt flavors with light yeast ester fruitiness; and a nice amount of flavor robustness with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, slick, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent ""Stein beer"" dark lager. All around nice balance, complexity, and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"it is an interesting note about dropping the glowing 'hot rocks' into the boil, but i wonder how much that contributes overall to the flavor. this is just a great 'standard' beer with some great properties. i like the way it laces on the sides. i like the semi-chocolate-y taste. i like the 6.5 % abv. it's not a super awesome brew, but a great standard which is very easy to drink and with a respectable abv."
""
"Overall, this is pretty good. It won't knock anybody socks off, but it doesn't do anything wrong."
""
""
"I probably gave this beer a bit better rating than I should have. It definitely had its moments."
"O: Delicious. Refreshing, gulpable, sweet, balanced, earthy, Good price point ($5.15). Ill buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting and not exactly what I was expecting when I opened this one - the hot volcanic lava rocks must have made the brewing experience interesting. Very malty but pretty easy to drink. Reminds me a bit of a schwartzbier."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and seems a little reminiscent of a schwartzbier and a porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is nice zesty toasty caramelly dark chocolate, dry woody-toasty licorice finish with light bitterness after being sweeter up front. Feel is good. However, it does not pack much character for the abv."
""
"an interesting brew that really has some euro flavor with an american slant, that makes it interesting, but not great. Definitely worth a try if you see it on tap, I don't think many will dislike this beer but of course not many may fall head over heals for it either."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good, but not impressive. Comes across as fairly generic. Lots of simple hop character, with a basic malt character. Based on the flavor profile, I'd have never guessed this to be a pale ale or a light IPA, not a lager."
""
""
"O: I've gotta get this again. This beer impressed me with its quirky character and refreshing flavor and body. I'll see if my lighter beer drinking friends might like this."
"Very easy drinking and packed with flavor. A very nicely done Dark Lager."
"This was a good beer, sweeter than I expected, with no roastyness to speak of. Still worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Okay by all standards. If you like this style you will most likely enjoy this brew. Port does a good job with their Hot Rocks Lager but it misses the mark for me. The combination of malty sweetness and roasty grains coats the tongue in a manner which I don't much care for. In any event, a solid brew but one I won't be revisiting any time soon."
""
"O: Intriquing flavor at the start, interesting but a bomber may overstay its welcome as it loses some mystic by the bottoms end. I would suggest splitting with a friend, the flavor stays fresh, intriquuing and leaving you wanting more this way then like a house guest after 3 days. still an interesting take.."
""
""
"This is a nice dark lager. When I got the initial hits of malt and caramel, I was worried that it was going to be too much. But it ended up being quite balanced and even. Thorough flavor profile. Even delivery. Not overly complex, but it works. I can dig it."
""

"Deep brown-almost black in body with khaki head that stays around. Smells of hazelnut, almost light coffee, and vague pine. Tastes of hazelnut, roasted coffee, slight prune, vague chocolate, and some grassiness. Cola-like in mouthfeel and medium bodied. Sticky on the palate but worth trying."
""
""
""
"Not something I'd buy regularly, but a tasty one off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not to bad"
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, slight caramel, and some mineral aromas. Taste is of roasted and toasted malt and some burnt caramel and slight mineral flavors. There is a medium roasty and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I prefer the way it smells over the way it tastes."
""
"DOA"
"Overall: an easy to drink dark lager but the flavor profile is a bit mild."
""
""
""
""
"A refreshing twist to the dark lager style. At the very least it's a good malt option for those who are bured from hops."
""
""
"I don't understand the packaging here. This beer is made by putting red-hot chunks of granite into the wort. This is how some old-school Germans boiled their wort and it lends the beer a hearty, rich, cooked-sugar complexity that is entirely unique. If the earth were a beer, this is what it would taste like. This deep winter, Euro dark lager, ""stein"" beer screams of its German ancestry. So why put it in a bottle with little Hawaiian guys dancing around a fire on the label? Beats me. Hand me another."
"Surprisingly chocolaty. But you can definitely taste the granite. A really unique taste. Flavors blend together well. Toasted Malta, touch of caramel, chocolate and a mineral like quality. The granite really adds a unique quality to this dark lager. Somehow makes it taste cleaner and crisper. A strange beer for sure but overall its pretty good. A little boring and a little too malt heavy at times though."
"A good dark lager. Decently balanced for flavor. Smooth and easy drinking."
""
""
"O: I really wasn't sure what effect the ""hot rocks"" (using hot rocks to achieve the boil) method they used would have. Maybe that's where the roasty flavors come from. Or, as the label hints, it was just fun to do - either way, while it's nothing Earth shatteringly different, I really enjoyed this beer and will be putting it in the regular rotation."
""

"Pours a dark, semi-transparent cola brown with a very thick but not too persistent light tan head. The sample I got fizzed like nobody’s business, so you may want to have a towel handy. Malty aroma has a firm fruity note and just a hint of miso. Flavor has a malty core plus fruity and woody notes and just a touch of caramel. There also seems to be a dusty or dirty tone, perhaps from the rocks used to heat the wort. Smooth texture has good body and a fair amount of fizz."
""
""
"Overall, a very tasty dark lager with a nice bright and dark flavor on draft and very drinkable. Which is why I bought a growler after tasting it on draft."
"D - Very drinkable. Feels smooth with a nice roasted dryness that balanced the hop and other flavors nicely."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Dark copper color with a tan head. Aroma is full of caramel and dark fruits, specifically the dank odor of prunes and the sweetness of figs. Flavor is very similar, pungent dark fruits and a light toffee finish. This is a full-flavored lager that can hold my attention, but unfortunately the sweet + prune combo is a little much to deal with over the course of 22 ounces."

"Final thought - this is a very, very nicely crafted lager! $5 a pop, 6% and just all around awesome"

"O - Wow, not what I was expecting in a ""lager"". Lager's are not my favorite style, so I am pleasantly surprised. Well done..."

"O: Got to admit. I was expecting something a little lighter when I purchased this bottle and not that this is a bad beer, but the plan was to pair this with Japanese food and this just didn't work with it. Now I understand that isn't the beers fault, but it is what it is. Otherwise, a decent brew with lots of malty characteristics and a fair drinkability."

"The appearance of the Hot Rocks Lager is great.. The beer poured a ddep rich amber that was nearly opaque. A huge froathy off-white head formed and is lacing down on the glass. The aroma carried caramel malt and slight spice. The taste starts with a sweet malt then becomes dry on the pallet. The mouthfeel is good medium body....big carbonation...which I think affects the taste slightly. Overall this is a good beer."

"O: A very nice beer. I dig that this was a collaboration with some brewery I've never heard of. Even still, I like the experiment in using dark granite rocks to help heat the wort and give some nice off-kilter flavors. Think the process produced some nicely done caramelized, almost decoction-like qualities. Really glad to have tried this."
"More complex than you think and expect. A very nice lager."
"Fairly dry, heavy side of light. Lively carbonation. Drinks easy. I just realy don't think I would visit it again, even with the higher scores, but that's how I feel about the style in general."
"O - Probably the best lager I've had from the west coast. I am an ale sort of person but definitely not opposed to lagers. I just normally drink ales. In a very good way, this beer reminds me of a delicious brown ale."
"O: Really impressed with this beer. For the ABV and lager style it has the depth of flavor of a stronger porter or stout.This would be an excellent christmas/cold weather beer. You should try this,"
"Great stuff. Bright and ballsy malt profile with plenty of added intrigue from the hot rocks."
"Pours a thick murky brown hue with dark copper highlights and leaves a bubble laden two finger head that settles to an outer rim,the smell is steam,caramel,fruity hops and toffee fondue,the mouthfeel is spot on for a lager its light bodied but the difference setting it apart from other lagers is this light body has abit of backbone which carries the tastes nicely of sticky caramel,burnt toffee,raspberries,poached fruit and finishes pretty much like a milky bitter white coffee that you have been waiting for ages to cool down and is ready for sculling and overall im a big fan of this brew as you dont see the hot rock method used too much these days and compared to one of our local australian micro breweries that brews a brew using the similar style this one is far superior and my only complaint is that i probably will not see this again for a while and am looking forwards to seeing it again one day cheers."
"A treat. A lager with a lot of flavor, but still very sesionable. Could drink a ton of this."
"O: A really enjoyable brew with a very ale-like presence and big malty flavor that surpasses any schwarzbier I’ve had before. Great job Port."
"Overall: Looks good, smells good, taste good, feels good. But nothing spectacular. Very affordable at 3.99 a bomber."
"A great lager. Seriously a must try for those who appreciate lagers."
"O: For a beer that looks like I just poured a Coke, once a lot of the carbonation burned off this beer was pretty drinkable. Interesting flavors, but I wasn’t blow away."
"Huh, I'm surprised BA doesn't have a style category for steinbier. Though, I think, this i only the second example I've tried of the style, the first being a ceramic bottle with a grolsch-type lid, from Germany, that was very flat and not very good. This one is alright."
"T/M/O- Really nice sweet bready malt flavor, melded nicely with hints of raisins and plum. Sourness is not there at all, I'd be concerned of sour flavor of this beer being bad, but really was only present in the aroma. Mouthful was slightly chewy; flavor lingered nicely and dissipated just in time to want to take another sip. Has a slight warming effect ABV at 6.5, just low enough I believe to be sessionable, but on the low end. Usually I find any lager to be very filling, but this one wasn’t to bad. This isn’t your typical strait forward lager either, it definiently has character. I'd recommend it for sure, although I'd probably go for there IPA that’s just my style preference."
"Pours a dark nearly opaque brown, a bit reddish on the edges with decent offqhite head that dies to a decent film, laces ok enough. Aromas are a bit of a sweet maltiness, a touch of brown sugar and light caramel candies. Bit of toast and nuts, coupled with faint vanilla sweetness and chocolate, more on the softer side than bitter. Initial is decent bodied, toasty and smoothed out with a nice creaminess. Vanilla, chocolate, caramel, and a good nuttiness round out the base flavors, moving to a light brown sugar, touch of roast and decent bitterness on the backend. The roast and bitterness stay on the palate well, as this beer should be a bit lighter than expected, but still packs pretty good flavor for just a dunkel. The sweetness isn’t cloying, as roast and toast with pretty good hoppiness come in to balance. I liked this beer for what it was, and only qualm may have been that the bitterness and roast on the finish, although enjoyable, could have been smoothed out a bit for a more sessionable experience."
"O: interesting lager with a nice array of malty flavors, it is rich while still being light bodied at the same time"
"Pours a hazy deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, small fruit, charcoal, and some small smoke. In the taste, small sweet fruit, dry rocks, and a hint of smoke. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry hint of smoke. Almost like a rauch, and quite ""grill"" like."
"Overall, I dig Hot Rocks for its combination of toasty, sweet, and smokey. Reminds me of a Kostritzer with a tinge of Rauchbier. I can’t say it’s smooth – it’s not – but it is flavorful and pairing well with the seasoned hamburger and noodles in gravy I’m eating with it. Due to its more abrasive effect on the palate, one per sitting is all I need."
"Very smooth and easy to drink; very well crafted lager. At $4,99 / 22oz, I will certainly seek this out in the future."
"O- Another solid beer from Port Brewing, very flavorful for such a clean, drinkable beer."
"Hot rocks lager is a decent lager and another great choice from what I'm realizing must be a fantastic brewery."
"O- an interesting beer that reminds me very much of a schwartzbeer. ill probably try this again if it is a yearly release."
"I tried this a couple of months ago, but it was a year old bottle. I like this one better, feels more balanced."
"Bottled 3/14/11. Pours a dark brown color with a large cream-tan colored head that goes down rather slowly. Scent is extremely malty with hints of chocolate and roasted nuts. Hints of vanilla as well. Taste is initially very malty with some roasted chocolate flavors. There is a bit of burnt nuttiness, along with bread and dark fruits. I find this beer to be very tasty. Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied and well-carbonated. Leaves a bubbling sensation in the mouth and has a very smooth, crisp finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a fantastic dark lager that I would definitely purchase again."
"Drink- I thought this was pretty good. I like the Dark Lager aspect to it with some malts, sweetness and a little yeast in the profile. Probably wont have again but still pretty good."
"Taste is fairly bitter and sharp. There's a lot of coffee and almost tart flavors from the toasty roasty flavors. Unique but good!"
"A heavy and thick lager, more reminiscent of a porter than anything else. Earthy and roasty, lots of flavor, and perfect with food."
"Good enough for a second pint, especially at $3!"
"Drinkable. That's its best attribute. It's not a particularly captivating beer, although I like the concept of the way it was brewed. Perhaps they could have produced a more interesting result, however."
"O: I enjoyed the little story behind the beer on the bottle. It actually turned out quite nice. Light, yet full and warming."
"It's odd, it seems a perfect accompaniment to a cool summer meal or a warm winter's feast - a very nice balance, I enjoyed this greatly."
"Not a bad beer at all."
"Not a bad rich flavor, but not much for drinking a pint."
"O: This is tasty and is the easiest finishing bomber I've ever had. This isn't mind-blowing in the taste category but goes down easily enough."
"Good stuff. Reminds me a lot of a Brown Ale in some ways. Very tasty and another great brew from Port who has yet to disappoint."
"Plenty drinkable, this is a smooth and tasty beer."
"Overall, an interesting lager. Glad I tried it, but not my style."
"$20 bottle at Fallen Rock club, Denver. Shared with JMSHB. Darkish body, almost nohead though lace. Sweeet with spices and pepper, root beerish.Chocolate, caramel, nuts. A brown ale more than anything. Average mouthfeel.Understated carbonation.Needed something very American, smoke or whatever."
"Reviewed on 2/4/2010. Bottle thanks to daknole. Pours a deep brown with a small tan head. Aroma of sweet bready malt. I don't really get too much from the aroma...Flavor of the same sweet grainy, bready malt with a touch of roast. Some grainy sourness too (not too sour, just a hint of sour). Although not very complex, certainly quite tasty and super drinkable! My favorite dunkel thus far."
"Drinkability is also good. This is a pretty tasty lager, I'd happily have another."
"Nice balance of chocolate malt and bittering hop (peppery?). The body is thin as would be expected. High carbonation. The finish is interesting as it mostly dark malts, not hoppy. The aftertaste is muted but lasting, similar to drinking hot cocoa. A smooth and flavorful beer."
"Thin mouthfeel. Or perhaps it's just so smooth. Again, should have paired it. Makes it quite drinkable. Nothing bad here."
"Appears a deep dark cola brown hue with a nice light beige tan head dwindling quickly. Aroma has dark roasted malt layers a touch of cola and fruit tones. Mild herbal layer with caramelized sugars just for a spot to dress my oldest son in the nose. Dark cola anise in the background, creamy dark chocolate mildy roasted malt character minimal hop impact. Hint of bready dough yeast, solid brown ale lager that's what it reminds me of. Mouthfeel is medium bodied creamy textured even carbonation not bad. Drinkability is solid all around a decent interesting brew from Pizza Port callaboration with Bend Brewing up in Oregon."
"Definite drinkability points for the cheapness $4, and for the uniqueness of this beer."
"I thought this beer was okay, nothing extraordinary being brewed with hot rocks in the process. I wouldn't pass it down if offered."
"As a sidenote, this beer had a ton of sediment in the bottle. Luckily very little of it came out. Most had partially solidified at the bottom. Maybe that bottle conditioning gave it that perfect head."
"All in all a good dark lager that is easy to drink, and I would love to have again."
"   D-  This beer is very dry with the melanoidin/nougat flavor grown and just the hop bitterness to follow.  It would be nice if there was more caramel flavors form the lava rocks to add some depth and flavor. "
"Drinkability for a lager seemed a bit rough. No signs of abv though"
"D - This is a pretty interesting beer that I'm enjoying quite a bit it has a good taste but I think one or two in a sitting is enough for me worth trying sometime"
"The technique doesn't produce as distinct a beer as it seems it would, but it does result - in the hands of these two capable brewers at least - in a notably flavourful and superbly drinkable lager. Too bad this beer itself is nearly as rare as the brewing methods used to make it; I could see enjoying a good many of these if it were regularly accessible."
"D-Pretty easy drinking for something so reminiscent of a dopplebock but as with those beers the richness catches up with you after awhile."
"The ever creative port brewing nails it again. A generally subtle style with a slight spin and it makes this brew exciting. Hunt this one down!"
"M/D - Medium body, lots of carbonation that help bring out the flavors. Finishes just a tad on the sweet side from the grains. Very drinkable because of the taste is refreshing and doesn't dry out the palate, also the low alcohol level allow for good drinkability."
"Quite complex over the course of the tasting. Worth a second try. Looking forward to comparing it to the Original."
"There's a metallic roughness to the flavor that's supported by toasted and caramelized malt, light roastiness, hints of coffee and fruitiness. It's rather full-bodied and rich, making it not exactly sessionable, but certainly enjoyable and easy enough to drink a pint of. It's nice to see new breweries using traditional, arguably archaic brewing methods such as this - I don't think I've had another stone beer beyond this one, but I'd love to try more."
"D: Overall it's a pretty good offering from port brewing drinks well but it reminds me of an amber ale."
"Drinkability - This is a strange one that you'll love or hate. I enjoyed the uniqueness of this effort and especially appreciated the expert lagering that went into the storage process. I don't know if it was the granite or whatever but this had that musty character like it was aged in a damp cave, something almost impossible to find outside of Germany."
"I like the novelty of this, although you'd never know it was brewed using black granite if you weren't 1) told so, or 2) an expert on black granite. As is, it's a refreshing dark lager that elbows into bock territory, flavor-wise, although not really texturally. All I know is the flavor is the best thing about it, which is pretty much 95% of the reason I drink beer, and I was left wanting more of the same after this bomber was gone."
"Drinks pretty easy, not perfect, but right in my malt-centric wheelhouse. I wonder if these guys will do Rauch or Dopplebock? They might want to give it some serious thought..."
"Poured it's Cherry Coke lookin' self into my Zatec fluted glass. A finger of lagerish foamy head. Smells a bit nutty, a bit cocoa-y, and a bit toasted-y. Dry bock-ish taste. Highly carbonated with a very dry cocoa powder, light coffee, and toasted flavor. Not my favorite Port brew, but for style, it's pretty tasty. I could go for a couple more."
"Pours a dark cherry cola color with red hues and a full finger foamy tan head that fades with stringy patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is sweet and spicy with a toasted malty character..really significant cinnamon notes. Medium bodied mouth feel nicely carbonated and creamy smooth. The texture compliments the rich sweet malty. Full flavored, big sweet and malty with an over the top cinnamon spice. At 6.5% ABV this one is a easy drinking keeper! Recommended."
"Drinkability: A lot of malty flavor, like a big dunkel but a nicely balanced hop profile, too"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, different representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink if you're looking for a poundable darker beer that is different from your typical stout or porter."
"Overall this was a rather uninteresting beer."
"It is ok, not true to style at all but not bad."
"D-Nice stuff, Crisp and dry with good flavours overall in this interestingly created brew. A well done lager from the IPA and wild beer masters!"
"Liked this beer a lot. Improved as it warmed. The last few sips were the best. Need to get back to Philly and get another bottle."
"Overall this was a really intresting beer and not at all what I was expecting."
"Found a bottle of this last spring at By the Bottle in Vancouver, WA. The colour was a garnet-brown and had about a 1/4 inch head. The aroma was malty and sweet with some biscuit, but no other standout smells. On the palate, there was burnt malt, light smoke, some brown sugar and some bitterness around the back of my palate. The finish was sweetly malty but not overtly so."
"22oz bottle picked up down in OC. This was an interesting beer. I went into this not really knowing what to expect from it. Very malty overall, with a rich sweetness that makes it drink like a bigger bock beer than it is. I would almost call it a doppelbock in the malt department, but the steinbier thing has given it a malt profile that is truly unique and intriguing. Dark red-brown in color with a thick light beige head that leaves a lasting slick after a few minutes. The aroma is sweet and malty with a smooth lager character, caramel, burnt sugars, licorice, and light smoke. The flavor is squarely malt driven and sweet with caramel, some chocolate, burnt marshmallows, dried fruit, light smoke, and a light spicy hop bitterness. Medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation. I liked this beer because of the cool malty flavors, but couldn't help but with it was a little drier or hoppier for balance. By the end of the bomber the sweetness became a little too intense."
"Drinkability: Really nice, and very drinkable. Seems a pretty unique style, people should make more."
"I had high hopes for Hot Rocks. Perhaps too high. I like collaboration beers and this effort by Port and Bend Brewing has an interesting story. Read the label if you're interested. I won't rehash it here. The results are alright, but aren't spectacular. It just doesn't have any standout qualities that make it shine. It's alright and is definitely worth a try, but go for the single bomber. You can thank me later."
"A dark brown beer poured into a pint glass. The first smell is of a malty sweetness that smells very inviting. The taste is different than the smell, with chocolate and roasted grains being the predominant flavor. There is not a lot of carbonation, which is okay in this beer. Overall this is a very drinkable beer that would go very well with a hamburger or a steak."
"D: Easy to drink, but not that impressive, and in all reality tastes a lot more like a porter or a stout than a lager. Really not that impressed with this beer, just doesn't really do anything for me. Some nice flavors, but has some off, maybe a little green flavors. Very cool collaboration, but the end product just didn't do it for me."
"D: Interesting flavor combinations, but lacks any outstanding charachter."
"This is a fine beer, but not really doing it for me. More roast and malt than I was expecting. Eh."
"A fun beer to try, with a (these days) rather unique brewing process, but it is not that great a beer to really enjoy (at least not for me). The flavor is very strange and a bit too bitter and herbal for me in a dark lager like this."
"overall more of a dunkel than a red ale."
"Light to medium bodied, highly drinkable but slightly under-carbonated. For the novelty alone this is worth checking out since it is a collaborated effort, and they did heat the wort with hot rocks."
"Mouthfeel was slightly thin. Drinkability was great but its not a session beer. A nice lager, but I think I'm more in love with the way it was brewed than how it tasted."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the clear reddish brown brew. Head recedes gradually to a slight layer of froth, with average lacing. Aroma is deeply of rich malt, reminiscent of a black lager, but dialed back a bit. Taste mirrors the nose, maybe the second runnings of a schwartzbier. Chewy sweetness upfront, peeks of crisp hoppiness to close. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is nice and easy. One I would definitely look for again."
"The process by which Hot Rocks Lager was brewed is more interesting than the beer itself. That said, this is a pretty enjoyable schwarzbier that is a few more flavor facets away from being worthy of a repeat purchase. If it's ever released again, that is."
"10 oz. pour at the Brickskellar, DC"
"drinkability: high"
"Not including Bamberg, Germany I'm not much of a lager fan. If forced to drink one I would probably choose this, but there just isn't a whole lot going on. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm sorry to say I won't be having an other anytime soon."
"d: an easy to drink brew, just nothing that really stands out for me"
"Pours a coppery brown color with 2 fingers of khaki tan head into a pint glass. OK retention and some spotty lacing. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, cinnamon, and some floral hops. Tastes of chocolate, molasses, cinnamon, nuts, roasted malt, coffee, smooke, and light citrus. Medium in body with good carbonation. Smooth with a light bitter finish. Easy to drink, nice and roasty."
"Overall I'd like to taste more beers that actively use rocks in the brewing process as the two I've had definitely change the flavor profile. Definitely worth a shot."
"D- Easy to drink. Great darker lager, but it doesn't seem to have much direction"
"Pours a dark mahogany with a thick tan head. Looks opaque until held up to the light. Thick lacking. Burnt sugar and roasted malt aroma. Some caramel/molasses aroma as well. Toasty. Heavier mouthfeel than expected, somewhat syrupy, with a long finish. Not the taste I was expecting. None of that sweet lagery nonsense. Grainy and minerals, with a strong malt character. Balanced well with spicy hops. Finish is also spicy, but sweeter with the maple syrup everyone reports. Very roasty throughout. It tricks you into thinking its coffee, but my guess is that its from the burnt grain and malt from the super-heated granite. Loved this beer."
"MF/D: Has a fullness to the body that I really like. Although it's not a very complex brew, I'm finding it highly drinkable."
"Not bad tasting at all but doesn't really taste like a lager. Ends up tasting like a stout."
"D: Very drinkable beer, but maybe this type of beer isn't my thing but I expected more from Port."
"D - Big malty lager with a spicy flair. Port always brews a quality beer, and this is no exception."
"Cheers!"
"Definitely worth a try."
"In the end this is quite malt focused, even if I can't quite decide if the initial hop focus in the flavor was distracting or intriguing. This is quite a tasty beer and the unique notes, presumably from the stoning process, makes this that much more interesting to try."
"Drinkability: Intensely drinkable, could knock them back all day. ABV is no where to be found."
"D - a great lager but this is sort of too much for me so there is no way id drink more than 1."
"D: not overly complex. Overt in toasted malt charachter. Easy enough to drink (or sip)."
"This very dark deep amber colored beer poured out with a good amount of lacing that retreated to wisps of lacing. The beer smelled of good balance of hops and malt with the aroma of a good roast. The caramel and chocolate gave hints to a fig like taste. Overall this beer was a roasted dry excellent light porter which is a lager. Strange but an excellent beer."
"- Overall somewhat drinkable... the strength of the brew should spit out an unnoticeable 8.0% Alc. by Vol. but doesn't.. bit sweet but overall very good."
"D - Pretty nice. Easy enough to drink."
"Always cool to see two brewers collaborate and try using a technique not commonly used. I would prefer even more hops in this one. All the malt flavor makes me want to go for something else, but for $4.00 I am not going to complain."
"Tasty, sweet, nutty toasty quality comes out in this biznatch. It's a nutty of an O is hot rocks lager-0."
"but i am good for 1 or 2 bombers worth if the mood is right."
"Drinkability- Was impressed by this one. I like the flavors and mouthfeel and found it very drinkable."
"Interesting take on the Steinbier, always good to see invention alive and well. Cool beer that tastes pretty good."
"Pours cola colored brown with small head that disappears completely within moments. Nose is weak to nonexistent, with a suggestion of musty caramel. Palate has an earthy quality that is probably the rock influence, but beyond that it's just a light roasty malt flavor profile. It's watery, with not much exciting going on."
"This is the first beer I've had that took the ""stein bier"" concept quite literally, and I like it a lot. Smooth like a lager should be, yet nice and sweet in its own right. I would love to see more brewers take a crack at this style. Definite thumbs up from me!"
"Good work on this beer! With all the problems the Lost Abbey has been having lately, it's good to see that quality control issues aside, they still put together fantastic recipes. No significant problems with this beer. I'd love to see this become a regular beer in the Port lineup as opposed to a one-off."
"It is always nice to see something new from Port on the shelf. This bomber was bought at Liquor World in Cambridge for six bucks. I was surprised when I started pouring in that this beer is a lot darker than I was expecting. It has a cola/root beer look to it, and a creamy white heading. One of the best looking beers I have encountered in a while. Nose has some malted milk balls, chocolate, bit of rye and toasted bread. More of the same comes from the taste, which is fine, as all the flavors really work well in unison. Body is somewhere in the middle of light and medium. While it is an easy drinker, sometimes the sweetness of it becomes a bit much. Still let this one unfold, and you will see that there are multiple layers of complexity. A very nice beer they have crafted here. I love the fact that they brewed this style, which I rarely try."
"I'm a lager fan and happy to see more coming from our leading craft breweries. This one's fine, but nothing to get too excited about. Beef up the carbonation a bit, get a bit more hop bite - then this one would be special."
"As I watch the B's seal the Game 1 deal I gotta say that this drinks well. I'll leave the commentary to the Habs' antics for a more relevant forum. This drinks very nicely and is enjoyable as hell."
"I would never have guessed this was a lager."
"Very unusual beer for Port to make. Once they did away with the amigo lager i thought they were going to go for more extreme style beers. Pours a dark brown, almost black color with almost no head. Mostly dark malt aroma, no hop aroma whatsoever. The taste was extremely good though, really nice carmalazation. Not roasty but malty sweet but well balanced. Good CO2. A very good example of a german schwarzbier in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Fairly enjoyable. It's definitely good to see someone's trying to bring a little excitement to the humble, sometimes dull lager, especially when it's in the form of broiled hunks of granite."
"D: Excellent flavor, and excellent feel. This is a solidly enjoyably ale that I'd definitely recommend."
"Dark brown colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is malty with a hint of coffee.Taste also is coffee,malts,sweet cream and perhaps a pinch of chocolate.This is very smooth and creamy from the first sip to last gulp.I would recommend and purchase again."
"D- Nothing crazy here, but a nice solid stein beer that I could session. I don't drink a lot of lagers, I would definetly drink this one again. Cool colaboration. I would like to see the process of making this beer, or at least the magma (think Austin Powers here) part."
"Cracked open a bomber and poured into a mug. Lives up to the dark lager name in color. Borders on dark red and brown and has a thin tan head. Sweet malty goodness on the nose. Mostly caramel and molasses. The same sweetness in the aroma comes through in the taste. Roasted flavor mixes with an assortment of fruits that don't seem like they should be in a lager. Regardless still very good. Reminds me more of a brown ale although it resembles a lager feel on the finish. Not usually a style I go with but overall this was a tasty brew. Also interesting to try out a beer using the ""hot rocks"" method as explained on the label."
"On a side note_- I remember a brew by AleSmith and Tomme Arthur and another Port brewer (Bagby or Nickels I think) that used this same method for brewing using with the hot rocks. Can't quite remember the name of that brew except the word stone or stoned was in it."
"Cool to hear Tomme collaborated with Bend Brewing on this and also the whole idea of this brew in general, did not even know this type of thing was done, will be drinking again, recommended"
"Quite refreshing. I enjoyed it."
"D: Not a bad little brew out of Port, glad I got to try it."
"A little prickly, medium-low, carbonation on the tongue, and some body. A little harsh in the finish which seems to be from a combination of the alcohol and grain tannins. Not bad but the finish is just a tad harsh. A little smoother as it warms up."
"Very robust and flavorful. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall its good, but nothing I would search out for, and very overpriced."
"All in all, good and interesting. As I've never had a stein beer before, I have no frame of reference for properly rating and judging this, but, it did taste good."
"I don't drink a lot of lagers. I'm really only so so on double bocks--even those that are supposed to be the best in the style. But this is a real nice beer. The color is ruddy brown and slightly hazy red when held in front of a light--very pretty. The smell is malty. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp lager. The taste is also clean, malty, slightly nutty, with a detectable toasty backdrop. Very well balanced and exceptionally drinkable. Good beer! Well done, Port Brewing. The idea that this was brewed using hot rocks to boil the wort also adds serious coolness points."
"Hot Rocks is pretty damn flavorful for a lager of the darker persuasion. It's very similar to a schwarzbier."
"Spotted this on tap at the Toronado last night. I asked what kind of beer it was and he said something along the lines of, ""not sure, it's dark, I think it's a rauchbier."" Well, I love rauchbiers, and since it was one of the few lines going I'd never tried, I ordered it. What it is is a tasty schwarzbier with a hint of roastiness from the malt, but certainly not smokey. More of a dark muddy brown than black, it looks, smells, and holds its own. Certainly has some punch, guessing at least 6% ABV. Quite worthwhile trying, though not my new favorite at least after just one go."
"D: It's a bit big for a Euro lager. I'm really nitpicking here, but I expected something that was a bit more sessionable. I would definitely have another glass if I see it again."
"Tan one-finger quickly dissipating head over dark almost opaque brown body with a fair bit of lacing. Sweetish caramel and B and M Baked Brown bread (!) in the nose, and a slightly sweetish malt taste. Not overly hoppy, but there is enough presence in the nose and taste to make this one drinkable lager for the hopheads among us. Very tasty, and a much needed lagerlicous deviation from ale madness. Lets hope Tomme and Tonya get together again soon!"
"This was quite the tasty Lager, with a deep tangy feel to it and a solid drinkibility that worked for me. Good stuff and it's nice to see another Lager beer coming out of Port Brewing."
