"Not the most flavorful, but a nice Czech dark that's very easy to drink."
"Drinkable & fairly enjoyable in a average sort of way, probably because of how easy it was to drink. Not the best Czech dark beer but a nice offering with a decent alcohol content & a well-balanced taste."

"A very drinkable and easy going beer, with just enough taste."

"O: A pretty nice dark lager."
"Nice - a well-crafted dark lager. Rich and smooth. A blend of subtle flavours give it a rounded character. Czech quality at it's finest - definitely worth your time."
"O - One of the best, and tastiest Czech dark lagers."
"O/D - Nothing overly interesting. Flavourful but maybe too sweet. I didn't mind it."
"drinkability: well balanced, equally drinkable lager."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is also quite sessionable."
"Poured with a nice foamy, frothy, somewhat thick, light tan head taht mostly lasts and a little lace. Color is a very nice clear dark cherry. Nose is super nice: dark, toasty, roasty malts, a little cocoa, toffee, and the barest hint of dark, ripe fruit. Flavor is like aroma but sweetness comes out a bit more, but just barely. Subtlely delicious. Body is ok and carbonation is maybe just a bit fizzy. Finish is like flavor and slowly tapers to a medium to long duration. Session."
"I enjoyed Bernard Cerne mildly, but it's fairly simple and isn't anything to write home about. An average European dark lager that is undoubtedly better at the source. Would pair with a pork and cabbage based dish, in quantity."
"Overall, one of the best dark lagers I have tried. I think even the best."
"Drinkability: As it's flavorful yet remains light and relatively low in alcohol, for once, the idea of a Weekend at Bernie's doesn't sound so bad. Quite a nice dark lager, actually. I'll admit to being a bit hesitant towards these odd imports from remote places in Eastern Europe, but I'll cheerfully try any other Bernard products in the future."

"D - The heaviness and strength of flavour make it a bit hard to drink a lot of."
"The burnt molasses is the main flavor--very sweet with burnt biscuity mouthfeel. Light alcohol warmth. It is a little too coyly sweet for my taste."
"Glad I had it, and yes, it was worth the extra wonga."
"Other comments: This is one of the better dark lagers I've tried. Well worth a try or two or three or four..."
"M&D: the texture is soothing and clean, with a healthy amount of fizziness; the balance is reached between the relaxingly-light dark malts and herbal bitter hops, on top of a consistent input of tart dark-fruitiness. All in all, this is yet another good quality Czech Cerne, medium-bodied, almost a bit like a porter for a lager..."
"Overall - A superb example of what a lager can be... definitely recommended..."
"Pours to a nice near black color with a good creamy head. Smell of sweet malts detected but not a whole lot more. It has a good medium body to it, but like any good dark lagers are very easy drinking. Packs a lot of flavor, of toasty malts, coffee and caramel notes. Very creamy and smooth with a nice hop finish! Perfect balance. Nothing too complex but its not supposed to be. This is a nice straight forward easy drinking dark lager. Grab it if you have the chance."
"Pours with a nice light brown head and a great nose of caramel and coffee. Wow! This one is complex. Caramel, coffee, honey and wheat. Feels great in the mount and goes down a little to good. Half liter bottle with a flip style resealable cap. ABV is actually 5.1% not 13%."
"The 13% is the gravity in Plato, NOT the ABV. That´s 5.1%."
"Very refreshing."
"Pours a very dark brown, with a light brown one finger head that fades a bit too quickly, leaving decent lace at first, then absolutely nothing. The nose is faintly of caramel. The mouth is light and mildly carbonated. There's a good smooth sweet caramel opening, but no hop backbone. Just a shadow of bitterness emerges in the aftertaste, but it quickly disappears. This one ends up being OK, but a bit too one dimensional."
"Notes: highly carbonated"
"Thanks for a great beer Matt!"
"An unusual masterpiece, thanks to Georgina for bringing from her hometown. From the re-sealable cap through the finish, this style turned me and my mates on my head. Why did I agree to share it? Starting as a tart and sweet stout with roastiness and coffee and some chocolate, it moved through as a dunkel and finished with a mildly sour but beautiful yeast at the end of the bottle. Appearance: Mocha head and retaining lace. Its unpasteurized, but drunk fresh. Been imitated, but had the real thing."
