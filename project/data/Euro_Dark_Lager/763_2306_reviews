"My first beer from Moonlight on tap at Toronado SF.  I was eager to try this having had Coffee and Cigarettes at Cellarmakers about a mile or so from Toronado.  The look and smell were good but honestly I was not enjoying the taste.  A strong charred, burnt taste that was overpowering the rest of the beer.  Maybe the fact I had C&C earlier that day distorted my rating (I realize that one is a porter and the othe a Euro dark lager) but I wound up leaving some of this beer in the glass which I rarely do unless a beer is completely missing it for me.  I know othe BA's like this lager and maybe on another day I would have liked it more.  I can't recommend this beer."

"The batch I had on tap had a substantial diacetyl problem. Too bad really felt like the beer could've been great. Will try again."

"4 oz. draft pour in Santa Rosa, CA, at Flavor Bistro. Typically don't care much for black beers but this one is miraculously, almost paradoxically light -- no gut-busting thickness or crazy high-ABV undertow beneath the flavor, which is impressively complex: slightly charred, pleasant notes of coffee and chocolate... very fresh-tasting, too, which is the upside of it being brewed only a few miles away."
""
"Wonderfully balanced and presented, with a classic lager feel.  Wonderful brew."

"On tap at the Toronado in San Francisco and only $5. Dark black, good head. Aroma is dark malts, nice. Flavor is dark malts with hints of mild chocolate and a definite lager flavor. This definitely tastes like a schwartzbier. Another nice beer from Moonlight."

"This is by far their most intensely flavored beer I've been able to sample from them so far, but it's also the most challenging to finish a full pint of, unfortunately. I'm astonished on how a dark lager could ever taste this bready, thick, and intense, and yet still retain a low gravity. Definitely not a bad offering during the colder months, however - and I always gladly revisit this whenever I'm in the mood. Recommended for those wanting an adventurous new favorite lager!"

"O- Middling black lager. Apparently I am totally bucking the reviews. I wish I had another chance to review this."
""
""
"On tap. Pours a very dark brown with small tan head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite roasty with a bit of coffee and some light dark chocolate. The taste is dry and roasty with light coffee and dark bitter chocolate. The finish is dry with some roastiness and a light bitterness. Lingering roastiness. Light body. Medium carbonation. This is quite enjoyable. A light bodied, dry, roasty beer that you can easily have several of. Awesome."
""
"This is a stellar Black Lager. Incredibly fresh the deep malt flavors, yet still light and extremely quaffable. Seek this out if you're in the bay area."
""

"O: Great beer. It seems fairly complex and it's gets even zanier as ti warms. I'm actually really impressed. Damn. I'd drink this all day long if I could. Solid!"
"Wow. Hallelujah. Thats the first thing that comes to mind after I take a whiff of this one...and taste it. The complexities of this one almost seem like a porter or stout. But it's a lager?! Brilliant. Amazing beer. This is one of my top beers of the year. I appreciate when brewers can make beers outside of the popular styles of the day and really do it well. This is one of those beers. A real pleasure to drink. This would garner my highest suggestion for a beer to try. Do it if ya get the chance."
"I could drink this half liter for a while. Great rendition of a dark lager. Lots of flavor but still very light. I only give a 4 overall because this isn't my favorite style to drink."
"smells smokey and malty. taste sweet and very flavorful ... lots of roast and malty goodness ... well carbonated good mouth feel ... overall a really good representation of the style"
"It looks, smells, and feels like a stout, almost, with an easy-sipping smoothness in spite of the roasted notes. The flavor is smooth with roast and bittering to define it, as well as a robust roast and a dry finish. It’s full flavored, with so much going on, and it remains one of my absolute favorite brews. Brian Hunt is an unsung marvel of brewing. Bravo!"
""
""
"O - Delicious. Would be excellent with a dark chocolate dessert or perhaps a nice charred steak and garlic potatoes. Highly recommended, great lager."
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee, and some hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty and hop bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"Had this a couple times on tap on a recent trip to SF. I'm always a fan of the style, seeking out new (at least to me) examples, and this is the best I've had. It has the agreeable drinkability of your standard dark lager or schwarzbier, but the depth of a great Baltic porter. There were fruity, cherry tones at times, and then dry toffee and cocoa with an interesting cola edge. I'm so impressed by how many, clean distinct (and delicious) dark malt flavors are crammed into this lager. Go find this beer. You need it."

"O- An awesome beer, Moonlight makes some of the most flavorful lagers I've had in a long time, this is a really drinkable, tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Just a bit too much. I love char and roast and other bitter flavors, but this was a bit over the top."
""

"O: One of the world’s easiest drinking beers. Flavors are rich enough to be interesting but not overly complex or strong."
""
"Loved it."
""

"Reminds me of Sam Adams Black Lager with an extreme roast, mashed grain flavor. Bonus points in the overall."
"Flavors of Belgian dark chocolate, Islay smoke, coffee, all nicely interwoven. A dry roasty finish that leaves a dose of lingering bitterness. Medium bodied and creamy with a fine blend of flavors. Easily sessionable, and one of the most intensely flavorful lagers in recent memory. Paired nicely with pesto foccacia and an appetizer of celery wrapped in parmesan and thin raw beef."
"Moonlight makes some very good beers, and this one is no exception. It has tons of flavor for the ABV, and if you get the chance to try it, I highly suggest it."
"Never has any brewer so successfully obliterated style guidelines; while it drinks like a schwarzbier, its flavour profile is on a whole other level. On my extended vacation in California I learned that you can be certain of more in life than just death and taxes - you can be sure that wherever there's Moonlight on tap, there's world-class beer to be had."
"O: Awesome. Very complex beer. Whenever I see this on tap, I order it. At 5% this is a beer you can and should have a few of."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors here are extremely well balanced and very complex. It seems to get more and more complex with each sip."
"Overall, this was a great beer. A very, very nice black lager."
"Bottle: Poured a dark color lager with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of lightly roasted malt notes with some caramel and light black chocolate notes. Taste is also a mix between some light caramel malt with subtle notes of chocolate and light dry bitter finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well doe for the style with great drinkability and complexity ratio."
"Poured from tap into pint glass. Very little head, black, but holds a dark dark amber in the light. Nose is fair cocoa, a tad splash of coffee, roasty malt towards to end. Taste is sweet chocolate, much like the nose forecasts, but a good amount of coffee comes forth. Mouth feel is good, good carb for the 'light' nature of the brew. Drinkability is excellent, goes down easy and is not heavy on the tongue (like a guinness...but more body). Overall, a great session, go-to for a darker beer that brings flavor."
"Black color. Light brown head with good retention. Nose is full of roasted malts and coffee. Taste is equally intense with the roast and coffee, but adds a sweet caramel and chocolate for a robust taste. Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Super creamy for the ABV. This has the flavor of a robust porter, but accomplishes this with a low ABV and lager yeast."
"Overall – The taste is decent and the the drinkability is very high on this one. I think that based on the high ratings on this site that I expected more from it however. The appearance is boring and the mouthfeel was lacking. I'd still drink it again though."
"Simple and delicious. Nothing else."
"O: This one did go down easily thanks to the somewhat thin body and light ABV, but the not particularly great flavor makes this just an average beer all around. Was interesting to have a lightly smoky lager, in contrast to the very over-smoked ones I've had in the past."
"D: That smooth body and lightness on the tongue make this a very drinkable beer. In fact, I had one more before moving on."
"Had this on tap during my California trip last fall. Reviewing from my notes. Pours pitch black with thin tan head, nice lacing down the glass. Smells of some roasted malt and more hops than I expected, I got a hint of some citrus. Small bitterness in the flavour, fairly well balanced. A very delicious beer. Nice carbonation level."
"Drinkable for days, as the tastes were not too strong, and the brew went down almost too easily. Highly recommended if you happen on it."
"Have always been a fan of this beer, and only wish I had more of a chance to drink it. One of the best domestic lagers I can think of, and at only 5% abv., this is the sort of beer I could hang back with and drink all night. Great stuff."
"D: True to style and fairly interesting, this dark lager from Moonlight is easy to drink and less strong than most ales that offer similar roasty qualities. Still, it doesn't provide any unique appealing sensory qualities over a good American porter. I feel that I may have done this beer a slight disservice in drinking it alone, since its profile begs to be paired with savory or spicy food."
"D- I get this whenever I see it on tap. It was listed as 4.2% alcohol on the menu and I can't think of another 4.2% beer with this much flavor or character. Highly recommended."
"I am glad I tried it while down here since this is probably my only chance to get a taste since I have never seen it in Boise. It would be a Boise favorite I tell you if it was distributed. But as I said one man show...how the story was told to me though is the guy is totally happy with that. I personally think that is cool that he has found his work load and happy spot. Stay with it is what I say..."
"Beer is a little ashy, medium to light in body, creamy mouthfeel, but the bitterness at the back of the beer is distracting, its quite ashy. The beer gets better the more I drink and the more I allow it to warm but this was a little bit of a disappointment for me. 16 ounces was way way more than enough honestly. I don't think I'd have it again, I've had other schwartz beers that were better."
"Overall a tasty and complex dark lager."
"Same and straightforward in the taste. It's has medium carbonation and is very smooth going down. Nothing fatiguing about this lager at all! Extremely drinkable and very enjoyable!"
"enjoyed on tap at Toronado. I like the style, and this was a decent example of it, though not the best I have had. Served a little cold. Lacey. Above average mouthfeel, with chocolate and a little sour, or rather coffee bitter astringent. Good drinkability.For some reason, it did not seem at peak condition."
"A soft black lager served in a tall glass. Light but not thin, dark but not overly roasty, with a classic clean dry stout-style finish that makes this not only a good drinker but an excellent accompaniment to food. The longer I sipped it the more I enjoyed it. A beautiful beer."
"D: It's nice to have a good Moonlight beer again after the abomination that is Artemis. I'd grab a pint of this again."
"Tap, City Beer Store. This beer pours coffee black with a tight off-white head. The aroma is mild but clean. There's light coffee, roast, fruit, floral/grassy hops and grain. The beer is smooth and light, quite good for a schwarzbier. The flavor starts mildly sweet and finishes dry. It's a refreshing, drinkable beer."
"One finger light tan head, quick dissipation, some lacing present. Black opaque body, no visible carbonation. Roasted malt nose, floral hops, pretty dry finish from bready malts. Taste features a bit of bitterness on back end, really well balanced, not too much roasted character on the tastebuds. no character dominates. Mouthfeel features pretty good effervescence, fairly light for the color. Drinkability at this ABV and for the 'dark' beer category is extremely high. The more Moonlight products I have, the more I'm impressed. Recommended."
"Quite a nice dark lager. Clear and deep brown with coppery edges. Not much of a cap on my pint, but that was okay. The bit of foam that was present stuck like glue to the glass and left a lot of lace behind. Mild aroma, a bit of dry cocoa and and roast. Solid bitterness with more chocolate, roast, and sweetness. Clean malt flavour. Medium bodied, smooth carbonation. Pretty tasty and a nice follow up to the Reality Czech."
"J"
"A solidly made beer."
"Thoroughly enjoyable, lots of flavor but still restrained enough to appeal to a novice palate - huge drinkability - glad to know you can find pitchers of this at some of the other eateries in the area."
"Ok. Maybe not, but oh dear lord D&T is amazing."
"Moonlight makes some consistently enjoyable beers and this is one of my favorites. Early in my beer drinking career I decided I didn't like this style but beers like this one have cause me to do a complete 180. If you're ever in the Bay Area one of your top beery priorities should be finding out where Moonlight is on tap."
"D: Tasty, tasty beer, goes down easily, highly drinkable, the ABV on this makes it ridiculously drinkable!"
"D - I've tried other schwatzbiers and found them to be like other lagers , except black. This was more like a stout brewed with lager yeast. Full of flavor and complex. One of the best surprises and one of the best beers I've had in a very long time. Unfortunately,to the best of my knowledge, it's not available in Kansas City. If you're ever in the Northern California area, seek it out, you will not be disappointed."
"Pours a shimmering, opaque black. There is a nice tan head and a good deal of lacing. The nose is roasted malt, chocolate, dry coffee, and hints of smoke. The taste brings forward a lot of bitter dark chocolate and some coffee; a bit of sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and dry. Quite drinkable--as much as I was disappointed by Reality Czech, I was very pleased with this one."
"Drinkability: This is what a Schwarzbier wanted to be all along - lots of complexity, with chocolate and roasted coffee flavors along with the grassy Germanic hop bill; just incredible"
"D - This is under 5%!? This is a schwarzbier?! I could drink this one all night - the best of the Moonlight beers that I tried on my trip."
"Another quality standby from the Moonlight camp."
"The only downfall of D&T is that it is only avail. in a tiny part of the US. Fortunately I live there."
"Moonlight is a brewery of dreams and starlight. May they brew forever!"
"super light for the extreme flavor. goes down like crazy. you see the color, you taste the complexity and then you wonder why it's not 9.5% abv"
"drinkability? how about drink-a-suckadong? yeah... I said it. I'll drink D&T until the day I die."
"D- Here is where this lager excels...For a beer that is blacker than black it drinks like water. Light bodied and more drinkable and darker than Schwarzbiers native to Germany. World class beer! If you're in the Bay Area and get the opportunity to drink this beer, do so."
"Drinkability is ok, I don't drink a lot of schwartzbier, but like most any other western US version of a classic euro style, this one seems amped up...which maybe I like, but I'd probably just assume have a porter at that point, as I always found a lot of the charm of a schwartz to be the light body. But the huge flavor and low ABV is still a plus. My first Moonlight beer, in spite of the style, I had to order it based on the name...and that's probably it's best feature!"
"One of the better interprestations of this style."
"It wasn't bad, but nothing distinctly stood out aside from the unusual aroma."
"Carbonation was good."
"Filling and warm as it hits the stomach, something I could easily drink for days."
"Had this on tap at Ben 'n Nick's in Oakland, CA. A true masterpiece and, for my money, the best in its class. Pours a an impenetrable black, the way a schwarzbier should, with a beautiful brown head that scatters aromas of dark chocolate trouffles and expresso right and left. This is one enticing beer. The tastes of dark chocolate and french roast (with the perfect level of bitterness come through loud and clear. Its body is on the medium-light end of the spectrum and its surprisingly low ABV make it one of the most of the most drinkable black brews out there. I highly recommend it."
"D: Very, God I loved this one."
"D: Not sure the best way to rate drinkability for this one. Definitely easy to drink, but I would expect so at 4.2%. Nevertheless good will likely get it again."
"The taste is similar, but with a strongly toasted malt emphasis and without the caramel. It has hints of chocolate and coffee, burnt toast, with initial sweetness balanced by a zesty, spicy bitterness. It has a long, mellow finish and is satisfying, smooth and fairly light while having fairly full body and flavor. It is not especially complex, though, and overtime starts to become slightly dulled."
"D- Thinner and light with an ok after taster. I guess that means it is drinkable."
"Coffee, chocolate. It reminded me of a porter on cask. Rich, foamy, gummy head. Not too sweet, low alcohol presence. Not much aroma."
"D: Great stuff, this!"
"Very good, a rich schwarzbier. It seems to dial back the roast and coffee bitterness and smooth it out somehow. Makes it a very easy to drink and enjoy beer!"
"D: Lots of flavour for a 4% or so beer, Moonlight strikes again with another quality product."
"Enjoyed on-tap at The Hydro Grill in Calistoga. The sulphur flavor scared off my brother but I really dug this beer. Pours a complete black color. Not thick but thin in appearance. No head and light on the carbonation. Nose was spent matches and fireplace ash. Not overly strong but just enough to be able to piece it together. Flavor was the aroma but all the more so. Plus I got some cocoa and coffee beans coming out, but as if they were placed in the roaster and forgotten about for an extra hour or so."
"Second beer from Moonlight and it was quite good, would love to try the sour version of this, not too familiar with this style but better than the ones I have had in the past, tasted great with my pulled pork sandwich, will definitely drink this again if I see it, recommended"
"Drinkability> rather drinkable, I must say!"
"The only drawback is that it is a bit intense -- it's my understanding that, as a low-alcohol lager, this is supposed to be an easy-drinking dark beer. This beer is many things, many of them extremely positive, but as I had to stop after two pints, I wouldn't say it's the most drinkable."
"Overall: I have had this beer before, and I liked it. I still like it. I tend to find myself leaning away from lagers, and drinking more sour beers and hop bombs. This beer is a good reminder that there are many good lagers out there."
"On tap @ Toronado. Black color, thin head of light tan foam. The aroma is mild with notes of toasty malt and a brisk hoppiness. The taste is very pleasant, lightly sweet, toasted malt with a solid lingering hop bitterness. It is very enjoyable and the lingering bitterness keeps you coming back. Medium body with decent carbonation. This is a true session beer, and if I didn't have so many other choices at the Toronado I would probably stick with it..."
"This is the best kept secret of Northern California beers. While this beer is almost black it is very light and refreshing. The lager yeast and dark malts balance perfectly to make this the most drinkable dark beer I have ever tasted. Only on draft, it is the most commonly found of Moonlight's beers."
"On tap at the Flavor Bistro in Santa Rosa, CA. Poured a nice dark black, but with good clarity when viewed at it's edges. High roasted smell and flavor. Medium-light mouthfeel. The roastiness is front and center but on a little lighter body. Not a creamy mouthfeel or anything like Guinness. Good beer to showcase a roasted malt character and not be overtaken by alcohol or anything else."
"Mouth: Enters crisp and lightly soured, though rich. Coffee and caramel, prunes and raisins, give way to a burnt toast, bitter finish that allows a hop balance to shine through a bit. Mouthfeel is creamy yet it contains some sparkly carbonation that tickles the roof of my mouth. Swallow is creamy and bright. This is my favorite schwarzbier, and is quickly becoming one of my favorite beers... period."
"D: Flavors are intense - burnt/smoky flavor is overbearing after a while. I liked the flavor in moderation but wanted something sweeter after this. Actually wanted some water and a tongue scraper...a very good beer to try, not sure about making it a session beer, despite its low ABV. Still, a very tasty example."
"Pitch black like a stout with no head whatsoever (due to the bartender's pour, not a lack of carbonation). Strong aromas of roasted barley and faint smoke. Like the smell, the taste is intensely roasty. Undertones of bittersweet chocolate and burnt toast are present as well. It's not an extremely complex brew, but I don't think it's trying to be. It's pretty light-bodied and crisp despite the big flavor, very quaffable stuff. Hard to believe this is only 4.2% ABV. A great brew all in all, and one of the better schwarzbiers I've had (admittedly not many)."
"Forget all day, I could drink this all week!"
"Excellent beeer for the style, and really just an excellent beer all around. I remember drinking this beer while I worked on my taxes on Jupiter's patio in Berkeley 10 or 15 years ago. It was great to have it again and see its still a fine brew. Pours black with a thin tan head and little lacing. The sccent is mostly of clean lightly toasted grain- no sourness from the grain which you sometimes get with the style. The flavor is a perfectly balanced mix of hop bitterness and light toastiness with a crisp mouthfeel and good medium body. Its refreshing, tasty, and clean. Not grainy in the mouth, sour, too toasty, nor sweet. Beautiful example of a style that's hard to find done right in this country."
"The brew had a medium body with medium to high carbonation, appropriate for the style. I did not want another one after this."
"I would never have guessed that Moonlight Death and Taxes would be my co-favorite beer from George's Mostly Unauthorized Home Bottling Project II... especially given the hoppy nature of the others. It's amazing beer, though, and will probably never be topped by another schawarzbier in terms of flavor and sheer drinkability. The Grim Reaper and the taxman can go screw themselves. I'll drink Death and Taxes and think about ways to cheat them both."
"22 oz bottle filled using a counter-pressure technique. You all know the drill. It pours from the bottle a solid dark brown to black color. A small finger of head falls to a very spotty coat over top. The dark quality leaves me unsure about the clarity, and there is no detectable carbonation working up to the surface. The aroma is nice, with a solid chocolate and roast malt character, with a very solid pine backbone that really acts as an arbitrator between the chocolate and roast. I like it. The flavor hits with a strong roast to ashen character that moves to the nice solid chocolate sweetness, finishing with a strong but not offensive pine hop, that has a strong bitterness associated with it. The finish leaves me with hints of mintyness, but I know this is not a flavor from anything, but from the sum of the parts. It is interesting and I like how it comes across. Mouthfeel is on the lighter end of moderate, with a carbonation that is of the same quality. I am very impressed with the magnitude of the flavor and aroma of this brew. It really hits hard and sticks with me. I'm not sure the hop is right for a traditional schwarzbier, but I like how it plays with the other flavors, and the minty aftertaste really draws me back. This one is a winner, especially at 4.2%."
"Mouthfeel is quite arid and light in body with a somewhat chalky dryness to it as well. Goes down incredibly easy and is packed full of flavor. An interesting brew that I'm happy to have had the chance to sample."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head is down to a layer of teensy bubbles quickly, yet laces heavily and lastingly. Aroma is sweet dark malt, with roasty coffee notes. Flavor following in the same footsteps, sweet countered with coffee bitterness, which lasts long after the swallow. Mouthfeel is smooth, possibly a tad under-carbonated, and drinkability is good and enjoyable. Yet another offering tempting me to visit my friend out in SD, CA..."
"22 oz bottle from RedwoodGeorge's magnificent bottling project. Thanks for the opportunity! Pours a dark, ebony body topped by a small cocoa head. Rings of lacing are left on the glass. Looks very much a stout instead of a lager. Aroma is dark chocolate and caramel accented by earthy hops and a citrusy note. A kiss of wood smoke adds a pleasant touch. Light medium body with an ideal medium carbonation. Taste has a lasting smokiness, almost like a rauchbier. Dark chocolate maltiness is dominant, balanced by an interesting hops bitterness that wavers between earthiness and citrus. Beautifully executed schwarzbier here that ranks up there with Sprecher Black Bavarian as America's best for the style. I love the smokiness in this one."
"this is certainly a fresh beer, perhaps a bit on the ill-conceived side.. more than anything, it's definitely not my bag. the only lowpoint in a box of wondrous treats.. thanks george!"
"Drinkability is great, very nice black lager here. Kudos to Brian for brewing this one. The best Schwarzbier I have had."
"A plenty tasty and easy to drink beer. Refreshingly dry and highly hopped this is a great beer for those that find most lagers a bit too sweet."
"My critisims of this beer are really just minor tweaks that would make a solid beer and excellent one."
"D: Not a stout, nor a porter. Very nice and original."
"A great dark lager. In the same league with Sprechers Black Bavarian."
"Anyway, this was a real treat and proved to be another signature beer from the ever-ingenious Moonlight Brewing. These guys never cease to amaze, and I felt honored to partake of this fine Schwarzbier at the Flavor Bistro with my wonderful wife and a great BA, Rapapoda."
"This is a nice, drinkable beer. It seems like a porter that was made with lager yeast."
"On tap at the Toronado. Poured a deep brown, almost black color with a fluffy white head with good lacing. The aroma is led by some bold roasted malts, coffees and a bit of hops in the background. The taste is what you smell, big toasty malts with a bit of hop bitterness blended well. This beer is enjoyable and leaves your mouth wanting more. This is my first Moonlight beer and I really enjoyed it. Wish I could get some of their beers back in the East."
"drinkability - I really enjoyed this beer and I highly recommend it. someone at the table next to me proclaimed, ""hell yes, they've got death and taxes on tap!"" when he looked at the menu. I think that says it all."
"Drinkability- I'm digging it! I really like the light sweetness level. Very drinkable...will visit again in the future."
"Comments: Its hard to imagine how good this beer is without trying it yourself. One of the strongest flavored beers I have had to date."
"Overall: lovely session brew with a little smokiness to change things up."
"This was on tap at the Toranado. Very dark brown to black, thin head that left a beautiful lace on the side of the glass. Aroma has roast malt, mild chocolate, heavy espresso. The taste has the espresso up front, followed by the mil chocolate. Definite hop bite in the flavor. Just brightens the taste a bit. Slick, full mouth feel, with just a touch of alcohol heat. Decent drinakbility."
"drinkability: went down pretty smooth. I wish a local bar had this as I would order it often as it an easy drinker."
"Drinkability and Notes  Great drinkability, has all of the wonderful flavors of a great American stout without the filling, ultra-heavy body. I will rate this beer ignoring that it is a Schwarzbier, because while this is really not really to style, I like it more than any Schwarzbier that I have ever had."
"I must admit I didn't like this beer as much as I wanted to. Black as any stout on the market, a thin tan head topped it and lacing was minimal. Slight roasted aroma was followed by a very roasted taste profile with moderate bitterness. A very sticky aftertaste was a bit unappealing for me, very spritzy mouthfeel and I opted for another beer when I had a second pint. Possibly this one could grow on me but inital meeting was take it or leave it."

"On-Tap @ Le Toronado. Strong coffee coloured with a nice tan head of foam that lasts and leaves excellent lacing as well. The aromas are crazy for a lager. Coffee, chocolate, big German malts, and nice spicy hops in the background as well. The taste was magnificent. Malty as all hell with a great roastiness up front. Totally lager-like and German up front but it really gets ale-like in complexity, and almost porter/stout like in the middle palate and finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the carbonation levels are plush. Drinkability is insane. It's like crack. Great stuff."
"A almost always end up having one of these at Toronado."
"Nice bubbly head, lasting on an intense dark color body. The smell shows a strong coffee character, dry coffee beans on one side, and coffee and cream or ice cream on the other. The taste is definitely coffee, notes of toffee and praline. Quite sparkling. Biscuity in the mouthfeel, with some refreshing notes of lemon and a hint of grassy hoppiness that dries the mouth a little bit. Mouthfeel is light and fesh, roasted and almost smoked. Wooden and creamy. Quite drinkable."
"The taste is just as you would smell it. It's loaded with coffee and licorce flavors, slightly chocolate. For all of this, it's still a pretty light beer. It's feel is full bodied, but still light enough to be described as feeling like a lighter lager. It's very refreshing and very easy to drink. There's no bitterness that is often associated with dark beers. This would be a great beer for those who have never really drank darker styles but would like to. It's very easy to drink... lot's of it!"
"Tap, Toronado, San Francisco. A pretty unique dark lager. Mashy/oaty, quite ashy and salty, pretty big hit of hops and bitterness. Pretty tasty, but a little unbalanced. Quite smooth and grainy to , pretty interesting stuff, didn't think it was a dunkel when i was trying it though."
"This was one of my favorite beers when playing pool with my buds. It is only available on tap in the SF Bay area but if you see it, go for it. If you like porters and stouts try this, it is similar but a little different."
"Dark black color, with a dark purple tint that rather pretty. Medium head. Aroma is roasted malts and coffee. A medium bodied Schwarthbeir. Malts are roasted, coffee and chocolate. Hops are slightly bitter. Very smooth. Lots of flavor. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
