"Good but still no the perfect one for me"
""

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  This is a much better beer than their ""green meenie"".  it is very flavorful and is lightly carbonated.  Not often seen in the states but worth a try."
""
"Deep brown with an amber hue and excellent clarity. Poured with a thick, light beige foam with decent retention. Light, dark roast malt and corn cereal aroma. No hop aromas. Light to moderate bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Light to medium with a dry finish. Dark bready sweetness followed by corn cereal flavors. Very light hop bitterness at the finish with no hop flavor. "
"Heineken Dark Lager change my mind on Heineken Brews. FYI: this was in a BROWN bottle.  Not Green."
"        Overall, I'll rate Heineken Dark Lager - Heineken Nederland B.V. with a 3.75. I enjoyed this more than their flagship product, which I've only ever had the green bottled version of at the time of this review."

"Pours a deep mahogany in color with some ruby highlights. About a good 1/2 finger of foamy beige head is seen when first poured. Settles down a a few mm's during the drink. Spotty lacing is seen that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is mostly of sweet dark roasted malts with a hint of dark fruits. Pretty much the same for the taste with a hint of dark bread also. Very smooth and goes down easy. Forgot how good this one is. I like this much better that the regular Heini that comes in the green bottle. Medium-bodied with medium carbonation. Overall a great brew!"

"great beer better then the normal Heineken."

"O: This one surprised me. It's very easy to drink and quite flavorful. Worth a shot if you're into dark lagers or dark beers in general"

"Alleluia. Just got this at the distributor - haven't had Heineken Dark since the 90s. Good deep brown and a fine head, even a little lacing. It has a faint sweet roasted smell, nothing grand. Malt is the star of the show here, and some toasty caramel as the brew warms a little. Great feel - it is just as good an easy drinking brew as I remembered it to be. If you want an extra delicious dark style, go Doppelbock - this is just meant to be a straightforward, sessionable brew. And if you want the regular Heineken Lager from the store to taste less skunky, go with the can for a fresher taste. I have no problems with Heineken, but the Dark especially makes me smile."

"Heineken Dark is by Far my Favorite Dark Lager Beer,and I Myself have never tasted another Dark Lager that even comes close to it's perfect balance of flavors and taste,it simply is an utterly Delishious and perfectly rounded Beer~Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This taste like a poorly brewed thin stout. Not sure of what the brewers are trying to do with this one. This is not a good beer at all."

"Don’t ask why I tasted this, just thank me for taking the bullet instead of you. I am a huge fan of Heineken and even Heineken Light - nothing is better for a day full of outdoor activities. Needless to say, Heineken went too far when producing this Euro Dark Lager. It lacks a clear difference in flavor profile from its counterpart and doesn’t feel complete. It might be worth trying as reviews are mixed, but I wouldn’t recommend buying a full case on a whim."

"O - Pleasantly surprised given the tepid ratings for this beer. I'll definitely drink this in the future."
"call me old fashion but I primarily rate my beers based upon taste. I'm also a big Heineken fan. However this brew still disappointed me. It lacked a clean after taste and the flavor that it did have did not satisfy. Personally I would not recommend this brew however that is just me. I found it truly disappointing."
""
""
""
"I find this beer to be very sessionable and delicious. This is indeed a beverage that I will seek out in the future."
""
""
""
"I would consider this an underrated beer for sure. I never heard of it until I was at a friend's place, and was handed a bottle of it, and was very thankful once I started drinking it. It is definitely a little bit darker than a normal lager, but that makes it enjoyable to me, since most porters are too dark, but sometimes I like to have darker beers than a traditional lager. If you have not tried this beer, I would definitely recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer makes me feel like I am drinking a less filling porter. I love the flavor and smell. It's smooth with a great semi-coffee aftertaste. I'm definitely a Brown/Amber Lager kind of guy, so this beer fit right into my preference. I think this beer will be my staple for a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Kind of tastes like cheap gas station coffee. Not too bad but not too good either. It's alright, I could drink lots of these so I'd recommend it, nothing amazing, just another beer."
""
""
"Overall, this wasn't too bad but it isn't anything to get excited over. I'm surprised I chose this beer as I've had poor results with dark lagers."
""
""
""
""
" I first tried this beer with a friend and was a little unconvinced that heineken could pull this off. Well i was wrong they nailed it for me. If a dark somewhat ""light"" lager is what you prefer with hints of chocolate, caramel, cream, and roasted malt. You have to try this stand out beer from heineken. Top 5 of mine for sure."

"Another beer that I used to drink decades ago but haven't touched in years. I recall back then that this beer was a delicious find and I think this holds true today. Perhaps a little fizzy on the mouthfeel side of things, but its warm, welcoming dark flavors are the highlight."
"The pour erased any question that it might not be dark. I had two-plus fingers of rocky, deep-tan head by the time that I was done and it looked like the top of a root beer float. Color was ruby-red with NE-quality clarity and I began to think of the last time I had seen a beer this pretty. Nose was rich with caramel, toffee, even coconut. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very caramel-like with a hint of smoke on the tongue. Finish was likewise faintly smoky and semi-dry, not sweet at all. First of all, I am not ashamed to say that I was impressed. Secondly, is it too much to ask them to CAN this beer? I would readily put some in the cooler."
" I would definitely give this one a try, even if you don't care for typical darks."
""
""
""

"I would give it a 2.25/5. I don't think I will buy it again, but its not bad! Definately worth trying atleast once."

"Overall - I would not recommend this, but it is better than standard Heineken, which is one of the worst beers I've ever had. I guess you could give it a shot once, but I would never buy this again."

"12 oz bottle at Brazilia Grill. Pours dark amber with short lived white head. Aroma is of caramel and a lot of dark fruit. Body is light and smooth. Taste is similar to aroma with mostly fruit and caramel, slight hint of hops. Short, sweet finish. It was Ok with steak, better than other selections at this place."
""
"Tastes somewhat comparable to other examples of the style I have tried. It just lacks depth generally and reminds me too much of regular Heineken in the end."
""
"Overall: Pretty nice looking and smelling, but the taste and mouthfeel are pretty lackluster."

"O: looks like a Munich dark; tastes like a Mexican amber. Does improve a little with some warming, and significantly better than the widely available imported lager in the green bottles and cans."
"Flavor is similar, fairly sweet with wet paper graininess. Very bland and dull. Malt-o-meal cereal (malt oatmeal) and brown sugar, wet stewed grain husks. Watery body, fairly clean aftertaste. Not something i'd revisit, it's a laughable, feeble attempt at a dark lager."

"This one poured out as a deep amber coloe with a thin fizzy cream colored head on top. The smell of the beer is pretty sweet with lots of caramel notes on the nose. The taste of the beer was also on the sweeter side, the malts were nicely roasted also. The mouthfeel of this beer was decent but nothing too special. I could have had a little more body to it. Overall this beer was pretty good to me, I would like to have it again one day just to try it again."

"Overall man are some folks trying to hype this beer? not nearly worth the A rating to some and not close to a B+ either this is just a typical Heineken brewed with more malt. Pass on it if you can!"
""

"this beer is an especially pleasing brew to enjoy. its a nice dark lager. the beer has a smooth taste to it. it tastes hoppy and has a nice carmel or chocolate flavor to it because of all that is in it. I cannot really name what makes this wonderful flavor except for one of those things being hops. I can taste malt there also. it has a sort of dry, tannish brown head. the head gets medium large. the color of the beer itself is about lighter than guinness but darker than an amber ale. it almost has the consistency and color of guinness but lighter. the smell is kind of of caramel because of how the whole beer yields that certain taste. the taste is, in my opinion, delicious enough making it very smooth. the caramel taste is very very pleasing in this beer. it being very smooth makes it easy to drink. I drank it down within ten minutes because its pleasing and smooth. I really like this beer. if you don't like dark beers, don't try it, but if you do this is a must try. being one who has guinness as the favorite beer this one fights to be up there with guinness. I would give it a B plus just because I save the A region for extremely pleasing beers."

"I was told this wasn't half bad, though it was by a wholesale salesman selling it... It pours a deep, dark ruby topped by a finger of dusty pale-tan foam. The nose comprises flaky biscuits, caramel, and a vague sense of mandarin orange syrup. The taste follows suit, with some slightly darker caramel, some very light cocoa backing that up, and a slightly less-vague sense of the mandarin orange syrup. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It's not all that great, but it's nowhere near offensive, and it borders on downright easily-drinkable. In fact, I could see drinking this again. Not bad, for once, Heineken..."
""
"Overall Drinkability - While I don't have high regard for its light lager brother, this beer might be one of the best in the Euro Dark Lager style. At least as far as I've had. Not much in the way of off characters except for the slight metallic astringency and mild acidity, but that might be a result of shelf life. Not amazing in any sense, but definitely worth a try."
"Overall I'm glad I tried it. I was pleasantly surprised. It's a very sessionable brew that I would not be afraid to tote to a party of non-BAs, but still be known as the ""beer expert."""
"O: Heineken may be known for its green bottled skunk lager, but there's none of that here. I found it very delicious and exceedingly drinkable."
"Pours a clear dark crimson brown with a 1 inch beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing whatsoever. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some nutty aromas. Taste is of caramel malt, bread, and nuts. Mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has an almost soda-like carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good dark lager from Heineken that is much better than their regular green bottle style."
"Pours a clear light brown color, fizzy head forms and retention is little to none. Light aroma of sugary malts and noble hops. In the flavor, a crisp caramel maltyness, toasted grain, hint of bitterness and a more or less clean finish. Very unoffensive and easily consumed. A nice macro euro dark lager that has no unpleasant qualities, but little else to offer."
"I thought this was sort of ""the corona of Holland"" and generally wasn't impressed at all."
"Not a bad beer, but I wish it was more like the green. With that said, if you hate the green, I'd say check this out, its very different."
"T: a medium light body, some sweet notes, toast flavour, bitterness but the end is not so long"
"The beer is a dark brown color with red highlights and a bubbly tan head that quickly faded. The smell is mostly roasted malt with some nutty flavor and earthy hops. Tastes a bit weak, there are flavors of roasted malt, molasses abd copper. Feels thin and watery with low carbonation. This is a solid brew I could see myself drinking this if there isn't craftbeer to choose from."
"m/d - medium body, somewhat sticky considering abv. interesting beer, interesting to drink a non-skunked brew from heine."
"Not a bad beer at all. Pours brown with red highlights, little tan head with lacing. Very big on the malt smell. Sweet tasting, roasted coffee, with light hopping, lager yeast is evident. Easy drinking, somewhat comparable to Negra Modelo. Good beer, enjoyable even."
"Certainly better than its green bottled lager brother."
"RJT"
"I had some Chinese food tonight with my wife at Mandarin Gourmet in Brookline. On the menu, the beer list includes one offering merely shown as ""dark beer"". I asked the server, and he replied it was Heineken Dark. I hadn't had one before, so I gave a bottle a try. Poured into a short stemmed water goblet. Dark brown color with red highlights. Got a decent sized head with a sturdy pour. Smell was bready and malty. The flavor was actually decent. It reminded me a bit of a cross between a brown ale and a dubbel; it had the similar flavor profile of each. A bit malty like a brown, but a touch of sweetness as in a Belgian ale. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin but smooth. Drinkability was surprisingly good for a Euro dark beer. It paired well with the food, and was a lot more flavorful than a run of the mill Heineken."
"D--Easy to drink. Just not interesting to drink"
"Definitely one of the better Euro dark beers. No similarity in comparison to regular Heineken. Has a bittery malty taste, a beautiful dark amber color, minimal head, and a slight, but welcomed aftertaste. Definitely a beginner beer, but you can never go wrong with Heiny Dark!"
"D - Considering the thin body and low ABV and really reserved flavor this one is really easy to drink. However, the not-so-great flavor kind of takes away from the drinkability."
"D: Easy to drink. My second Euro Dark Lager and I like this style, so far."
"Pours a deep brown russet color with a thick soapy off white head and some lacing. Smells of vanilla and barley soaked in wet dog scent. Tastes of barley, some sweet malts, and a little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is decent."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights. One finger head gone in a jiffy. Fruity aroma dominates - a blend of prunes and apples. Also a faint malt essence coming in under the rest. Taste is initially covered up by carbonation, but malt sweetness eventually emerges and fruity hops come in behind the rest. Nothing firm and distinct about this dark lager, but several qualities are muddled together. Vague breadiness long into the aftertaste. Medium body. Lack of excellence and clarity leaves me done at one."
"a friend recommended this beer for me to try, and im glad he did. its incredibly hard to find it but i finally found it after looking @ 30 different liquor stores i finally found 3 six packs at a bevmo in orange county (and bought all 3 of them). normally i cannot drink heineken but i can easily say this is brew is now one of my top 5 favorites of all time. if you ever get a chance to at least try it DO NOT pass it up."
"This beer (according to the label) won two awards in Paris in the 1800s. If that's the only critical acclaim this beer has enjoyed, that would be a shame. I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys a good dark lager. Just fantastic."
"Poured into a pint glass a dark mahogany with a nice foamy beige 2 finger head. Good retention and substantial lacing. Slight roasted nutty aroma. Taste was dominated by sweet malt, caramel, and raisin bread. A medium-light body with big carbonation. Goes down easy and is quite refreshing. Unintrusive aftertaste. A year-round session brew and much more likable than regular Heineken lager."
"drinkability - Average drinkability, the lasting bitter aftertaste wears on my palette after awhile, making this beer a shorter than wanted experience."
"D- All around a slightly better than average beer, and one preferible to the mainstream ""normal"" heineken."
"D- Above average. This is a much better beer than I am used to from the usually embarrassing Heineken. A bit more body and an firmer sense of self would make this beer really good."
"D: due to the fact that it taste more like a bock makes it even for tastier and drinkable for me."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, I found this beer to be much better than I had anticipated. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this beer is quite sessionable."
"Drinkability- Nice balance of a lighter lager and slightly darker tones, easy to drink more than a six pack."
"Heineken Dark was one of those beers I drank in the 80's when I wanted something different. That was before I got into the craft styles. This poured an amber-red with a two-inch or so short-lived frothy tan head that fizzles. But the carbonation remains active throughout. Bottle no. 927452852044 had a mild mixture of caramel malts, thin hops, and bread. The taste had a sweet bitterness like an ESB with a nudge of thin hops at the end. I drank this quickly and easily. It does bring back some memories but there are plenty of similar and superior beers to choose from these days."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with no freshness date. Pours dark amber color with about an inch of head. Lots of carbonated bubbles coming to the top. No real scents. Flavor full of malts. Not hoppy at all. No real balance. Pretty easily drinkable. I prefer fresh Heineken Lager better."
"Reddish brown color with a tan head and decent retention. Smells of dark malt with grain. A slight caramel aroma. Tastes consists of caramel , grain, and some chocolate. Thin watery mouthfeel with decent carbonation. The drinkability is below average. Not much to get excited about here."
"If you like dark beer this is a must try. Aroma is malty but not skunky. It pours with a light brown creamy long lasting head, is a clear dark caramel color, smooth and creamy to the palate with a nutty toasty flavor. With little aftertaste it compliments a variety of foods, ie. brie and rich cheeses, spicy dishes, but doesn't overpower like Guinness. Low alchohol and good price makes it a good choice for a party. Not easy to find, it's worth looking for."
"Drinkability- has to rank high on drinkabilty a nice balance of a lighter lager and slightly darker tones, a very great session dark lager, a good beer i would seek out again though i wish it were available in 12 packs, somewhat impressed better then I expected"
"I would drink this one any day over a normal Heine."
"P.S. If you are drinking Green Heineken, always opt for the Heine-can."
"Drinkablity? The abv obviously isn't a problem, I just find it lacks any kind of oomph so 1 bottle at a sitting is enough for me."
"D: Tasty the first one but becomes cloying to take several."
"A very nice dark lager. While it's somewhat light in the body, this beer has a firm malt base. It is smooth, creamy with just enough of a dark malt profile to give it character. While it's by far not a hoppy lager, it finishes dry with little aftertaste"
"D-Very good sessionable beer indeed. Not bad. I would have it again if someone brought it to a bbq or something."
"D - Good, it was too easy to drink actually. I found myself wanting to gulp it down and not write down notes. There were enough complex smells and flavors to keep me guessing. This beer would be good by itself. One of the best macro beers I've had in a long time. I had trouble believing this was the same company."
"D- A surprisingly refreshing and complex lager, ESPECIALLY considering its evil distant cousin - the Heineken Pale Lager. Nice balance of malts and just enough bittering hops. If I'm in a lager mood and there's no micro- options, I won't hesitate to grab a few of these."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of caramel and malts. Taste has some malts and caramel, a little milder than I expected. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good beer."
"cheers!"
"One of my favorite beers be far.Highly drinkable if you can find it...it's that damn good!"
"Taste is exponentially better than Heineken Lager, but still is not all that tasty. A bit too sweet with a fake chocolate flavor and an astringent, plasticy aftertaste. Body is light and only slightly watery, carbonation is adequate. I would probably take a Baltika #4 over this one, but I've yet to come across a Euro Dark that I really enjoy."
"Drinkablity: Well done brew. Good alternative to regular Heineken. Very drinkable, yet presents hearty qualities."
"MF&D - I wish this beer were just a bit thicker. I good offering from a macro beer company."
"D- Meh. Pretty average brew to me. Easy to drink, I suppose it would be sessionable if you had no other alternative."
"Pours a clear dark brownish copper color with a very thin tan colored head. Nose is dominated by sweet malts and grains with a hint of fruitiness. Taste is roasted malts with notes of caramel and dark bread. A strong maltiness is present both upfront and in the finish. This is a decent beer, but it doesn't really have any distinguishing characteristics aside from the strong maltiness. I wanted to like it more but couldn't."
"A dark amber color pour with a small offwhite head, no lacing. Aroma is of lightly sweet caramel,slightly nutty,faint hops. Flavor is semi-sweet,toasty malt flavor (better than expected) lightly bitter,some caramel,with just a hint of grass. Light body,crisp clean mouthfeel, very sessionable and a pretty good drinker"
"Heineken Dark Lager is very average in the grand scheme of beer. The nose is weak, the flavor's convoluted and uninspiring, and it's not enjoyable. That being said, I don't really hate it. There's just not much to like. If it had something to add some pizzazz, it'd be dramatically improved. Maybe some hops? Pretty average all around. Maybe worth a try, but I wouldn't suggest seeking it out."
"D: Easy session beer. I've drank this beer a lot, just not recently. One of my ""gateway beers"". Its good to see that this is one that I still enjoy. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a bit of a change."
"drinkable despite its flaws. the prospect of a darker heineken excited me, however ill stick to the regular stuff."
"Not a very good beer. Just has a very odd taste and its just not good."
"Overall, not too bad, but nothing you'd put near the top of your list either. I always find this on the beer menu in Thai/Chinese/Vietnamese restaurants but never try it. Glad I did, as it is an interesting spin by this huge brewer."
"D: Well, it's better than Heineken's lighter offerings. Why don't they use this wonderful brown bottle for their other beers? Maybe then they wouldn't have such a bad reputation for being light-struck all the time."
"D: this beer was just okay for me, I would have trouble buying it if it was next to something else in the store."
"D Goes down easily, hops are a little too strong for my taste but not overpowering crisp finish. For a dark lager would be good on a hot day. Would pare well with red meat"
"It's not bad; I've had worse that cost more than this. It won't be one of my regulars or even semi-regulars, though."
"very surprised by this beer. It is an awesome combo with a good salmon meal. Pours a nice rich red color though not much to say for a nice frothy head. The flavor is right on for a dark lager, not too powerful but still great. I got a cedar/coffee dark taste from it. This may be one of my new favorite brews."
"Drinkability. Nothing jumped out at me. I was expecting more flavor and body. Very bland and weak. Either I got an old bottle or this is a really poor beer."
"Overall it is an okay beer not to bad."
"Pours brown into the glass with decent head that sticks it out a little. Smells of a touch of yeast, maybe a bit of caramel...nothing smacking you in the face, but nothing unpleasant. Taste is decently malty sweet with a touch of caramel flavor up front and fades off to a thin flavor and mouthfeel. Highly carbonated. Better than this beer's more popular brother. Fairly drinkable."
"Feel is better again than the original, but nothing too much. The body is slight but there, and the carbonation is good, keeps it refreshing."
"D: While this is certainly better than most other Heineken beers, it's still wildly uneven on the whole."
"Well, it's better than the usual Heineken in the green bottle. Actually a beautiful brown color in the glass with a nice small head that stays with it. Taste wise it feels like there is some potential at first, but once swallowed you just get bland-ness. Def above average, but not by much."
"Drinkability: Sits heavier than the mouthfeel would indicate. Flavor is mild. Not a great black lager, but I could drink it I suppse."
"An ok dark lager, it tasted better on my first six pack, not sure yet if they're be a 3rd."
"Average stuff..."
"D: Drinkability was a huge disappointment, dump and avoid at all cost."
"Back in college I would often treat myself to a six pack if I had some extra cash or I was just feeling special. It's a very good dunkel, completely different in taste from regular Heineken Lager. The heavier flavor and thick appearance are great. Although not real complex in flavor I think the overall taste does this beer justice. My biggest drawback is the over-inflated price of Heineken. If I want to enjoy a good dark beer I can save a couple of bucks and pick up lots of other choices just as good if not better than this one."
"Heineken, I apologize for my previous bias!"
"Not too shabby, though one can do better in the category. Makes a nice changeup in their portfolio and shows they don't only brew pale colored beer."
"For a beer from a mass-market brewer, this isn't too bad. Nothing about it is going to excite a true beer-lover but it's a whole lot better than the regular Heineken, that's for sure. Slightly malty and bready with a good nose and a halfway decent head. The taste is good... if only there was more of it. I knocked this one back in no time flat, the way I might with a good quality root beer. There's not a lot to savour and enjoy here, but what little there is deserves some acknowledgement from those of us who appreciate a good beer."
"Nice drinking, but nothing out of the ordinary."
"Medium feel with nice bubbly carbonation. This would be drinkable if I could get past the diacetyl."
"The taste is fairly sweet with a hint of bitterness, somewhat toasty with caramel, but develops a faint, unpleasant burnt taste before a fairly nice grainy finish. It's somewhat fizzy and thin, with a weak, watery, fizzy palate that vanishes quickly to leave almost no remnant in the mouth. It also overall gets worse as one drinks it."
""
"Overall not a bad drinking beer. Is it worth the money? Probably not, but more so than it's green-bottled ""I just paid nine bucks to drink skunk urine"" counterpart."
"I bought this beer expecting much worse things and was pleasantly surprised. I haven't had a Heineken dark in years, decades is more like it, and I'm no fan of their lager counterpart which to me is just a slightly sweeter version of any number of characterless American macros. Enough said. The beer was a bit of a pleasant surprise, just because I was expecting so little. It pours a nice amber, copper color, very clear, clean, with a decent off white head that hangs around a bit and laces too. The smell is nutty malts, caramel, and an off medicinal quality, although some of the off smells dissipate as things settle. The smell is the weakest link. The taste is subdued, it has a nice caramel backbone, plenty of caramelized malts, some roasted flavors, and a bit of a metallic edge as well. The beer is approaching a medium body with not much carbonation. The finish is a bit off and that's where some of the metallic flavors emerge. Not much aftertaste one way or another. Not a bad beer, and I'm glad I gave it a try."
"D - Not sure if I would have this again. It would really have to pair well with the food I would eat. Not for casual consumption."
"Good all around beer. Try it if you haven't."
"You can tell it's Heineken when you taste it. If you're picking this up thinking it will be a completely new and different experience than Heineken lager, just put the bottle back down. That being said, this is a decent dunkel; not the best by far, but certainly not a purchasethat you will regret. I mentioned Heine's lager because this is literally just a dark version of their standard lager; no major difference except that it has a more pleasant scent to it and the taste has a heavier malt-influence. I wouldn't mind picking up a sixer of this again in the near future."
"Pours a dark brown color, some carbonation, tiny fizzy tannish head, minimally sticky lacing follows. The nose is slightly malty, toffee and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some toffee, and caramel. Light-Medium body. Slight drinkability, most likely would not buy again."
"Drinkability: While never complex or overly impressive, it does exhibit far more character than the standard Heineken."
"Very drinkable. A good beer for those who say they like dark beer."
"Very Dark Amber pour with a smallish light tan head that doesnt last too long unfortunately. Good looking beer. Smell isnt too strong to begin but the lightly malty caramel, alcohol smells I do pick up are subtle but nice at first, but then turn into an almost nauseatingly artificial syrupy caramel smell. Tastes of some lightly roasty malts, a touch of yeast, and has a very quick finish and basically no bitterness. Body is a tad watery, yet has a fairly rich, full flavor for a (dark)lager nonetheless. Overall, a good easy drinking darker session beer. Not terrible, but I wouldn't get this again."
"D - This is an okay brew. I thought it improved as it warmed up."
"Not bad at all for the style. Lacks the ""Euro-skunk"" and sulfurish blandness of its pale counterpart. Not a bad brew for a conventional/almost pedestrian ""sessionable"" dark lager."
"Acceptable, but I will not be getting this one again."
"(d)""sigh", was very disappointed and not impressed, i suppose i was expecting something more, more full body more something. I am willing to give it another go, but on average just by this experience i would pass 9 times out of 10."
"I've been a long time Heineken fan and when I first saw this beer on the shelf I got very excited. Of course I bought it and took it home and let it chill. I was not sure what to expect when I tried it but I guess I got my hopes up. The flavor was surely fine, I felt it had a nice thick creamy taste to it, although that is not one of my favorites. It went down very smooth and left a nice aftertaste and I think I could get use to it after some time. I know there are some looking for this type of beer but as an original Heineken fan it just isn't quite adequate."
"The drinkability is ok at best, I might look good to the unwashed drinking it, but it does not feel that great. MK"
" ps. the ABV is either 4.6 or 4.8 i'm not sure which, I knew at 1 point, but you know how brain cells go..."
"I was surprised how much I liked this beer, I bought it on a whim thinking it would be, well, not so good. But it looked good, very dark, smelled kind of nutty and tasted good with a well-balanced mix of malts, oats and nuts flavors. It went well with the Hamburger I was eating. I would recommend this beer as most people would be surprised on its taste."
" it feels slick, a light bodied brew trying really hard to be medium bodied...but falls short. After a few minutes this stuff is lifeless and flat. Drinkability: one is enough, maybe too much."
"This was a decent beer I have to say. Had it my my in laws and did not know what to expect going in. Poured a nice hazelnut brown with a small maybe an inch of head. Quick faded left no real lace. Some nice carbonation. Smell was of light grains with a touch of bittering hops, maybe very light. Taste was a classic heinken but with a bit of a dark wheat twist. Lots of grain here with a bit of the yeast. Nice smooth feel, not slick or watered down. Good carbonation. Could have drank this one all night. Overall a solid dark lager, a good call for sure for a keg or a cooler full"
"D-Better than a regular Heineken but rather mediocre in every sense of the word. Tastes kind of like the dark malt syrup used for extract brewing"
"This came in a 12oz bottle...appearance was dark. Not dark like a stout, but dark enough. The smell was pleasant. You can smell the roasted ingredients which are pleasant on the the ole schnoze. Taste is full of roasted bits. It's east on the taste buds, and goes well with good meal, like steak or prime rib. Mouthfeel is alittle on the thick side, in that it will coat the tounge, but not disgustingly so. The drinkability is high (at least for me). A good session beer for someone that likes a dark beer, but doesn't want the gut filling properties of a full on stout. All around this is not a bad offering from a company ( I say company and not brewery on purpose) that is reknowned for their fizzy yellow skunk piss lager."
"Drinkability- On the higher end of average."
"The smell is a sweet malt aroma,very nice btw.The taste is like malt to , little bit of sweetnes and i can taste something like a coffee taste far away, some caramel too. It feels very nice on the mouth, refreshing but with a nice body. This is a really nice beer , i would drink it more often."
"drinkability - I would buy this again. I don't like Heineken but I like this style. Malt, not too dark, and not much smoked taste that I expected. Good job Heineken !"
"Expecting a total disaster, I was a bit relieved when I opened the bottle and was met by dark, toasty aromas instead of pungent, off-putting ones. The pour delivered a thin, dark brown (cola-like) color with fizzy carbonationa and weak head retention. Aromas of toasted grains, light malts, and a mild bready / roasty nature. Flavors are all the same, with emphasis on the toasted grains. I'm not convinced that this is an all-malt brew. The feel is a predictibly watered, moderately astringent feel with hardly an aftertaste at all. Again, a little cola-like late. Not a failure, but still no German Dunkel either."
"A pretty good session beer but there are much better ones."
"The drinkability is not too high for me but I could drink a six pack if it is what I had."
"Pours brown,with a redish hue. Thin tan head, not much in the way of retention, and just some lacing. Smell is good,but weak. Carmel malts, and dark fruits. Body is thin, with some carbionation. Taste is sweet carmel,and fruit, somewhat spicy,with a nice smooth refreshing finish. Very drinkable. Recommened"
"A dark rich red, like a burnt blood red. Poured with a medium head. Smells of sweet caramel or toffee. After taste of coffee and caramel. This beer had a lot of carbonation. a little more than i like. Drinkabillity on this one is average to a little above. Pretty good dark beer."
"12oz bottle from Florians. Dark brown body with ruby-red highlights and about a half an inch of tan head that dissipates quickly leaving only a little lacing. Smells malty and roasty, with somewhat of a licorice or banana-like quality. Tastes slightly roasty, sweet, and licorice-like quality. Medium in body. Not particularly offensive, but not wow-ing either. Seems like a Schwarzbier (like Sam Adams Black Lager), but only about half-way to where it should be IMO. Imressive for a Heinekin product, and a pretty decent beer overall."
"Pours deep chestnut , 10w30 looking. Head is fizzy, three fingered, beige, and lasts about 20 seconds. Aroma is boring with some roasty malts, coffee, and some hops. FLavours are muteed molasses, some chocolate, slight hops bitterness. Its pretty boring all the way around, finishes watery and unmemorable. Thanks Chris!"
"Dispensed from 12oz bottle into a pint glass. A dark brown beer emerges, not quite opaque, with a small but puffy tan head. Im not sure what the aroma of a euro dark lager is but this one is very very fruity. Lots of plums and figs. Tons of malt here. Not one sign of a single hop leaf in this one. This is a nice beer. I really dont know what category this may be, but I cant imagine all dark euro lagers are like this. Very fruity and a bit sweet, but I may try this one again. Due to its sweetness and overwhleming fruitiness, drinkability may be small, but still a nice beer."
"Heineken Dark Lager was a clear red-brown color with a light tan head. The head was medium in size, but was soon reduced to a thin layer and left a little lacing behind. The aroma was sweet malt and a little toasty. The taste was toasted malt and lightly bitter with a dry finish. The body was medium-light with good carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's a decent dark lager, but nothing to seek out."
"I was very surprised by this brew. This is the tastiest Euro I have had. If you're gonna drink a macro dark lager this is a good choice."
"Better than Heineken's light lager offerings, but nothing stands out here. Slightly fruity nose, big black color. Mostly malty, hops kick keeps it balanced. Lingering maltiness is good, but nothing takes your tongue for a ride - good or bad. I don't think taking down a six-pack would be difficult, but nothing really makes me come back for more."
"This beer looks really neat because it's a reddish brown color with a creamy brown head. The smell is an awesome creamy, sour deliciousness. The taste is the kicker though. There's a strange sourness that I can't really figure out. I'm not too crazy about this. I mean it's neat but not worth going out of your way to try. The mouthfeel is average because it's just like any other normal lager beer but some corosive graininess. I'd say overall I'd probably care for one or two then after that I'd just go to something normal.."
"Heineken Dark Lager pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and a fluffy off white, almost tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malty and very sweet. Taste is heavy on the malt, very sweet, but balanced out in the finish with some mild hop bitterness. It's a lot more interesting than their regular and light lagers."
"Pours a very clear deep red with a fizzy, three finger biege head. Passing retention and weak lacing. Very light aroma, mabye some saaz and/or tettnanger? Hint of toasted malt as well. Slight crystal sweetness at first sip, followed by spicy cola flavor like cardamon. Toasted malt flavor is mild, apparent in the drying afteraste along with a balancing but light noble hop bitterness. Light body, med-high carbonation. Crisp and slightly sweet. Finish suggests some residual caramel sweetness and mild german hops, but its mostly clean. Drinkable with a charismatic taste; in a non-offensive kind of way."
"This isn't the worst beer, very middle of the road. I was actually surprised with the components of this beer. It does have some flavor and good aromas, but it is so bland it's nothing to brag about. Pretty much what you would expect from Heineken."
"Its ok to drink, but not something I would pick up unless my options were severly limited."
"Pours a rusty brown remeniscient of what iced tea concentrate would look like with a frothy, khaki head that maintains its integrity. Leaves a little lacing. Clean lager aromas with a dark malty backbone and a faint herbal hops scent (possibly goldings?). Big malty flavors start this one off. Toasted and roasted malt lingers on the tongue along with the herbal hops. Just damned clean. Only fault is that it drinks a little watery. The flavors up front seem to die off too quickly. Mouthfeel is creamy with a very soft carbonation. Again, like with the taste, this seems a bit watery in the mouth. The only fault I see here. Perfect drinkability. Lots of flavor and a relatively thin body make this for optimal fall sessioning. I just wish I had bought more than this single. A surprising offering from Heineken."
"Well-crafted; superbly balanced; interesting enough to have more than one."
"Eric"
"The first impression of taste was a great mouthfeel, perfect carbonation, and a great balance of hops and toasted malt. As ""macro euro lagers"" go this beats the green bottles and would make a nide bunch of beers to frink in a row, a session at the local pub or sports bar. But, since the dark variety is not readily available I suggest throwing some in the cooler for your next barbeque. Its not complex, not over-flavorful, but compared to many others, it certainly was not a let down."
"Mouth is malty and flabby. None of the richness of the nose is evident in the flavor at all. Limp and weak. Some faint herbal hops. lightly fizzy and really thin. Nothing particularly appealing about this one. Way worse than regular Heineken. Pass."
"This brew feels kind of syrupy. It doesnt just go down the hatch like a golden lager. This has a bit more presence to it."
"This beer pours a dark amber with a foamy tan head. There is no lacing and the head dissipates to a little ring around the edge of the glass. The beer smells of some faint roasted malts. The taste is has the slight flavor of some roasted coffee and chocolate flavored malts. This beer has an average thickness to it and overall is about average on drinkability. Not a bad choice as a last resort."
"Pours a deep ruby copper with a nice two finger head. Smell is malty, grassy, some adjunct aromas. Not too bad on the taste front..malty throughout with a sticky quality that coats the palate...a light slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a tad too sticky for my liking, yet not unpleasant. Because of this quality, drinkability is lowered. All in all, a bit of a surprise."
"Cheers!"
"I am a fan of Heineken Lager so when i saw this beer i was intrigued. I however was not a fan of this beer. I felt it was just bland, not a lot of different things going going on with this. The head also died rather quickly. I was little dissappointed with this one"
"Overall i like this more than the normal heineken, but it's not that good of a beer. somewhat easy to put down, but not one i would want a six pack in my fridge much."
"Whoa back up the bus, It's been a while since I've been on a blah beer streak but this makes 2 in a row that just have me wondering."
" The pour produces a tannish, rapidly dissipating foamy head. A dark chocolate color ensues giving way to a dark roasted malty flavor, with a ""smooth bitterness"" that one expects from a dark Euro finish. Medium bodied at best, this beer gives you the darkness you crave, and the ability to drink an easy 6 if that's the road you are traveling on - a road well traveled indeed...enjoy"
"Color is dark brown with a ruby glow. The creamy head is average-sized and light brown. Aroma has a mild, generic dark malt sweetness with a touch of herbal hop. Taste is much like the aroma: mild malt sweetness with just a bit of hop. A lightly roasted finish is the highlight. Overall: not a bad dark lager, just not that great either, the malt flavors need a little more punch."
"D: Pretty drinkable. I'm not sure I'll ever buy a six-pack of these, but I liked it a lot more than I expected to."
"Nice food accompaniment."
"A surprising beer, to say the least. Heads and tails above its lighter counterpart."
"Pours a deep, dark amber color with a bit of head retention and very little carbonation, which I took as a positive sign considering how many lagers seem overly fizzy. The aroma is pleasantly sweet and malty, and sweetness is the predominant feature of the taste as well. After the sweet sensations fade Im left with a rather thin, watery flavour. I will confess that my expectations were not set very high for this brew, and although it didnt surpass my expectations by any great degree I still find it drinkable and not unpleasant with a meal. I would certainly choose it over the standard Heineken lager, but overall it lacks the texture of a really good dark lager."
"The mouthfeel was very light with a light body and light carbonation [obviously, ""light"" was a theme in my tasting of this beer]. Overall, the beer was weak and one dimensional. Not bad in a pinch, just don't expect anything interesting."
"Not really the creaminess I would expect from this beer. I could down a sixer of these without doubt if the selection is limited, however this would not be a prefferred selection among many others."
"A bit thin and slightly astringent but drinkable. Goes well with spicy food."
"Overall, I am delighted with this beer. I came into it with a low expectation and was put in my place. Nice, well rounded beer. Not a whole lot going on and a little insipid, but not bad at all. Give it a go."
"Shimmering bright red wine, carbonated tan froth head, dots of lacing noticeable. A nice aroma of caramel, malts and black licorise. A tinge carbonated (expected), toasted wheat bread. Sweet, burnt malts, and a touch of chocolate to finish. For a mass produced dark lager, this one was surprisingly satisfying, quite nice indeed!"
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Benji loved this one. Damn near took my glass and went for more. Peaches didn't care of it as much. Oh well, her loss."
"Pours a clear, dark ruby-brown color. Head looks decent for a split second, but then recedes to a thin haze. Consistency is too oily to leave much for lacing. Smells of faint roasted malt and caramel..not offensive, just weak. Taste follows suit pretty well..almost all malts..toasted with some toffee & nutty accents. Mouthfeel is too thin and the metallic flavors turn me off a little also. Thin mouthfeel and apparent low-alcohol make this one that's easy to drink, but not one I'd especially want to drink on a regular basis."
"I was skeptical, but this is actually very good and is highly competetive with some of the better dark Euro-Lagers like Ayinger, Paulaner, Hacker-Pschorr, etc. Nicely brewed and very easy to drink. I can see myself drinking more of this in the future. Recommended."
"Overall, this is a great beer. It should honestly be rated a bit higher. This seems like an almost reverse of the regular Heineken which I honestly don't enjoy too much. Props to Heineken making a great beer."
"A slightly above average dark European lager. I like to see this beer when I am at a restaraunt with a limited selection. It takes me by surprise. Good drinkability level and better than it's Heineken lager counterpart."
"Notes: My sample was ""Special Dark""; very drinkable beer"
"If I were drinking only one or two, I think I prefer this to Heineken's green label, but if I've got to down more than two Heinekens, they'll have to be green labels."
"Heineken Dark is respectable drinking most of the time, although probably a little too sweet for serious drinking"
"Label states: ""Est. 1873"""
"Deep brownish amber color that displays bright red hues when held up to the light. The beer pours with a brilliant clarity and a thin head that disappears in an instant. Smooth, nutty lager that's a bit dry on the palate, but very well balanced, and that seems to emphasize toasted malt over any other flavor component."
"Appears a very dark mahogany color with a frothy, orangish-tan head accumulated through a vigorous pour. The smell is interesting. Sweet and malty, yet hoppy as well. Also notice caramel and nutty characteristics. Very well-balanced scent. The flavor is overwhelmingly malty and sweet, especially the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is at or around medium-bodied, but has a weird, almost syrupy feel to it. Drinkability isnt bad. It goes down smooth. Overall, this is an average beer. Not bad, but there really isnt anything that sets it apart from the competition."
"Pours a four-finger light tan head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Clear deep amber color. Medium bodied and very light carbonation. Sweet malty nose. Starts sweet finish is like a dry root beer. Better than their lager. $1.45 for a 12oz. bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"This was the best selection at a place I was at that had about 12 bottled beers available. I was surprised they even had this in stock. Although not outstanding Heineken Dark seemed okay, in a pinch."
"A dark brown beer with some ruby highlights. Has a small beige head that disappears immeadiatly. There is a very light roasted malt aroma with a hint of sweet molasses in the background. The flavor has hints of a malty sweetness and a roasted bitterness. But hints is is as good as it gets."
"Notes: This is an average beer that doesn't taste bad, but certainly does not impress. This is just a beer that I kill time with friends with and it hasn't let me down. If better microbrews were available, I would drink them, but there aren't many choices in New Orleans apart from Martin's Wine Cellar. In short, Heineken Dark is a beer I sometimes choose to have and will never turn down."
"Pours a dark brown color witha very small tan head that recededs fast into nothing. The faint smeel is sweet and malty. Taste is very unimpressive, and bland. There just isn't much there. The smell does not translate over into the taste. There is a mild sweetness and a mild bitterness, but nothing that stands out. The mouthfeel is medium-thin. Overall, this beer is bad."
"Not a bad drinking beer.. I prefer this over standard Heineken for the simple fact that there is a little more going on here and the brown bottle better ensures the beer won't be skunky from being light struck."
"Sure looks a lot better than green bottle pale Heineken. Dark cola brown body with a amber edges and a dense cap of light tan head. Nose consists of clean, soapy, lightly roasted malts, dry cocoa, and whiffs of metal. Lightly sweetened malt up front; kind of cola-ish and brown sugary. Toasted caramel and light cocoa flavors detectable. Finish is lightly roasted and mildly bitter with lingering tobacco and cola malts. Light-medium body with adequate carbonation levels. Not bad really."
"It's not something I'd go out with the specific intent of buying, but if your options are limited to the typical items most people think of as ""beer," this is a good choice."
"from the bottle. poured a dark amber with a light tan head. aroma, malts some sweetness, almost brown sugur almost white, a roasted nut . not a whole lot going on with this one, got hints of malts and hops, some sweetness, and a dry mouth feel. do not think I will buy this one again"
"Overall a pretty good beer. Could use a little refinement on the malt but not too bad. I would have probably guessed this one was a decent brown ale if I didn't see the bottle. This one is definately worth a try."
"Completely ordinary dark lager, basically."
"Overall-a pleasent surprise, this is a fairly well flavored and deviously drinkable dark lager that also isn't too overbearing. This could end up becoming a guilty pleasure for me from time to time."
"The beer pours a beautiful ruby red color with a thick frothy tan head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with lager yeast. The taste is decent. It has a smooth malty flavor with a dry lager yeast finish that is a bit watery. It has good mouthfeel. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good dark lager and another fine offering from Heineken. It goes down easy; a good drinker."
"Nothing at all like the much more popular green Heineken! Poured very red. Nice slightly off-white head which almost appeared to have a slightly creamy consistency. Nice lacing, but the head disapeared a little too fast. The smell was very malty, and a bit sweet, too. Taste was of a dry roasted malt with almost a toasted aftertaste. Very nice. The mouth feel was a lot thinner than I would have thought by simply looking at it and smelling it. So much so that I rated it as average. That is really that only real negative thing I have to say about this stuff, is that it is really thin. Other than that, I thought it was great!"
"Mouthfeel was all right, nothing spectacular. A somewhat drinkable beer though, much much better than the green-bottled crap."
"I am a true lover of lagers, in all styles. That said, I absolutely despise Heineken. It's one of the worst beers out there, and its high price and huge popularity constantly infuriate me. Heineken's trademark skunky flavor has been the subject of countless beer-geek discussions, and I for one have resolved never to touch the stuff again. So when I stumbled across a sample of Heineken Dark, I wasn't sure what to expect. I approached the beer with an open mind, and was pleased to discover it didn't have the sewerlike skunkiness that makes their regular pisslager so hateful. So is the beer a success? Does it redeem the Dutch as a nation of beermakers? (I hate Grolsch and Amstel too.) Not exactly. The beer is too sweet and remains cloying long after the swallow. I've experienced good German dunkel lagers, and I recognize that the big malt sweetness is a force to be reckoned with, and that a delicate interplay with the hops is necessary to keep the beer from going overboard. However, either the makers of Heiny don't know jack about hops, or wanted to make the beer as licorice-sweet as possible to appeal to the tasteless masses. A somewhat appealing dark ruby liquid sustains a buoyant, persistent head, with a heaping aroma of sweet caramel and molasses. The flavor is initially appealing, but there is no dryness, no finish, simply a lingering sweetness that tastes like red licorice (a confection I hate with a similar acuity to that of yellow Heineken). The beer is not BAD; in fact with the proper caramelized dish it might be pleasing. At this particular moment in time, though, it is too sweet, too cloying, although I am pleased to say it is not nearly as disgustingly bile-inducing as that dribble that comes in the green bottles."
"Drinkability - a worthwhile session beer for the most part. I enjoyed it."
"I can't say that I like Heineken Lager, but I do find it to be drinkable. Heineken Dark though needs a recipe change. The Dr. Jekyl beginning is okay, but the Mr. Hyde finish is definitely not."
"Nice enough looking beer , when poured into my gl;ass. Darkish amber..almost even garnet in colour..nice sized off white head..though it did not last. The aroma is surprisingly malty and even touches of chocolate. Again the flavour is much more malty and even has hints of chocolate( milk), small hop bit at the end. KInda average on the palate..does tend towards wateryness near the end. Not a bad dark lager at all..I would drink again, but hardly a classic"
"12 ounce bottle, pours dark brown, with an average looking off white head. a bit of chocolate in the nose. Taste is a bit skunky (yes even the dark is skunky!) with notes of cocoa, caramel and chocolate maybe a little wet cardboard. Medium body. Fairly smooth stuff. Clean and non descript with flavors that are sort of muted. Eh, not my favorite stuff. worth a try if youre into dark lagers."
"12 oz bottle at Luna's in Stuart, FL. Pours a dark brown nearly shiny mahogany color. Foamy light tan head settles fast. Leaves smalls traces on the glass. Smell is a slightly toasty, sweet, molasses. Not unpleasant at all. Nothing like the traditional Heineken lager. Taste was mostly sweet, slighltly malty. Touches of carmel and toasted biscuit. Some buttery and no hops to note. An overall very pleasant surprise. Stays together then finishes watery for the most part. Easy enough to drink, better than I expected and good in a pinch."
"This brew is a clear, dark brown colored drink, with a decent sized brown bubbly head topping it off. Some caramel malt scent. Clean tasting, some roasted malt tones, some slight hop bitterness. Medium/thin bodied. I know what the idea is that theyre going for, but theyre keeping the flavor low-key to attract the people who dont like the taste of beer. Not bad but dont buy it unless its on sale or the best thing in the bar."
"Smells strong of malt with a malty, bready taste. The beer says what it needs to say, lets you think about it for a bit, then goes away and expects you to take another sip. I could have one or two of these, but I'm certainly not sitting back with a six pack to pass the waning hours. Worth a try if it's free, like this one was."
"Zum wohl!"
"The pour was dark copper with a nice three-quarter inch head that quickly dissapated to a thin foam. The remaining head stuck to the glass nicely. The smell was light and sweet with no real great overtones of anything other than malt. The drink starts very sweet with a slight hop bite in the middle followed by a smooth clean finish with little or no aftertaste. This would make a great lawnmower beer."
"Drinkable, great for a macro but I can find better."
"Clear tea-like brown color with a middling head in size and overall duration. Laces in spare simple strings. Some pumpernickle to the overall bready aroma. Mouthfeel is a tad on the watery side, the flavor is pleasantly neutral in malt sweetness with a decided graininess to add some texture. Low degree of hoppiness overall. The finish is the most distinct part of the beer, light but dry with a continued grain fabric. The attenuation and non-threatening middle-of-the-road flavor leads me to believe that a lot of people could find this brew accessible."
"If you have to drink Heineken this is the one to get. I have a nostalgiac affection for this beer as it was the very first ""dark"" beer that I tried, long before I was on the craft brew path. It pours a deep mahogany with a beige head that quickly disappears. The aroma is of burnt toast, roasted nuts and bittersweet chocolate, very appealing, IMO. Unfortunately the taste doesn't back up the promise of the aroma. Toasty, roasted grain flavors come through in the flavor with some non-descript, simple sweetness. Not bad, just not enough oomph. It's a very clean brew that could use a bit more malt to add some character and mouthfeel. Still, this is not a bad choice if you're looking for a light-bodied dark beer."
"A nice deep maroon color, with a creamy tan head. Smells of roasted malt and sweetness. This is much better than heineken lager. Still a little too thin and sweet to be considered a very good beer, in my opinion, but much improved over their flagship brew."
"Wow, I was shocked when I tried this beer. I was expecting the flavor of heineken lager - which I do not care for, but it was not the case with this beer. This beer was totally different. Taste was very sweet and nutty. Since it is a dark beer, I was expecting some sweetness, but I could not believe how sweet this beer was. I drank this beer twice, since I really do like it. I did however get a slight stomach ache afterwards. Wasn't sure if it was the beer so I drank it again another day but got the same feeling in my stomach again. Weird because the beer tastes great. I would definately drink this beer again if I didn't feel sick after drinking it."
"Bottom line: If you like malty flavors, and you are at a bar with a limited beer selection, give Heine Dark a try. Otherwise, it is simply a medicore dark lager."
"This was much better than I expected. It was a nice brown/red color with a small head that faded to a lace. The smell was malty. The taste was malty as well with a little bit of hops at the end. The mouthfeel was very good. It was nice and meaty and had well rounded edges in accords to cabonation. I could make this a session beer easily."
"I can't believe I am saying this, but for a beer brewed by Heineken this is a fairly decent beer. It poured a medium sized tan rocky head with fine-medium sized bubbles that mostly diminished. There was carbonation observed and it had an opaque body with a reddish-brown hue. The nose consisted of malt and caramel with a sweet brown flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth, slightly tingly, thin textured, and light-medium bodied. The downside is that it lacks in the flavor department."
"Comments  Chase this with a shot of Jaegermeister."
"On the pour a deep incarnadine color, the head miniscule, the color something akin to dirty grey, the lace AWOL. Nose prototypical malt and nothing else, the start slightly sweet with the top cadaverous and the finish ferine in its acidic bite, hops as one would expect for the style and brewery sparse, dry aftertaste, another Habeas Corpus beer wheres the body, and wheres the flavor."
"Not a bad beer, but not great, its a cookie cutter example of a dark euro. At first pour, it comes out a very very deep mohogany, with a tan head that fades fast. Wit hthe first sip, youll notice a good amount of malt, and a lsightly thin mouthfeel, but not overly watery, some hop notes are found at the end but not as much as you would expect. Not a bad beer if you cant find better."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with a small head and moderate lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly sweet and interesting. I really had decent hopes for this one because I thought that since it was dark, it would be decent - not sucky like normal Heineken. I was wrong. The taste was a little malty, but pretty crappy and enjoyable - the taste was very reminescent of normal Heineken with a bit more sweetness. Didn't like it much."
"I liked the beer at first, but towards the end of the glass I got bored with it. Nothing wrong with it over all, okay balance, just slightly boring."
"Deep mahogany body really throws off some red highlights, topped by a decent but loose light tan head that relatively quickly fades to nothing. Aroma of slight whiskey malt and old socks. Maybe moldy malt. Taste is slightly better, with a wet grain taste that gives way to a touch of roastiness. Hint of bitterness on the dry finish. Actually quite astringent. Mouthfeel is harsh, with moderate but noticeable carbonation atop a weak body. Drinkability is poor. This is a typical macro style lager with a bit more character, but I still don't care for it."
"In summary, a decent product. Not as drinkable as some other similar beers, but much less offensive than the regular Heineken lager."
"The downside of that is we become too accustomed to The Lager as a bare minimum beer. Therefore we give little credibility to the other Heinekens on the market. Get past that commercial stigmata - then you can enjoy their more craftier brews."
"This pours with light brownish head that settles on top of clear ruby liquid tinged with brown. Dark malts and some caramel detected in the nose. Taste is pleasing to the palate, with notes of light roasted malt that offers a bit of dryness, minimal hop bitterness..just enough perhaps, and again, some scant caramel flavors pop up midway. Finshes smooth and satisfying with a light, light bittersweetness that quietly fades away. Fresh samples really make all the difference here. A great intro to dark beers for someone curious about them."
"Drinkability: Totally unexciting. Why bother."
"A decent example of a macro European dark lager. Head is dark white, with very little lacing. Taste is of chocolatey malts, with a slight hop taste. The finish is a bit rough, burning on the way down. I liked this somewhat. I wish it were cheaper here in the states, as I might try it more often. Not a great dark lager, but not bad."
"Heineken trying to make a decent brew, this dunkel is not that bad, but then again it's not that good. Pours a very dark ruby amber with a tan fizzy head high levels of artificial carbonation. This beer leaves practically no lace, definitely a macro we're dealing with here. The aroma is an off astringent metallic scent, and underneath of that there is sweet malt with nutty tones smells pretty good. Lighter in flavor than it looks, this is a the caramel malt is toned down, and there are some fruit tones in the background all tied together with a little bite of alcohol. Mouthfeel is thin, lacking a lot of body here. Overall though I would order when while out at a place with a shabby selection, depending on the price. I wouldn't drink that many of these because it's nothing special, but it does pull off an overall pretty enjoyable beer that could be consumed in quantity."
"Really, this beer is not all that bad....in fact, it's a decent flavorful dark lager. Pours deep brownish-red with a slight , whispy head. Roasted grain and hop aroma is faint, but appealing. Initial taste is sweet and malty. Very drinkable. Light body, and slightly watery mouthfeel, but not nearly as light as expected. This beer is certainly overpriced, but it is enjoyable."
" The taste is very sweet for a so-called dark beer, and i was not so fond of this. There was a blend of malts with again, granny smith apples. It was so strange. I can't say it was a horrible taste, but it was not like a dark beer. It only had very subtle roasty flavors, and you had to have a hunting dog to find the roasty aromas or flavors in this one."
"Taste trys far too hard to be inoffensive; there's a little bit of roasted malt here, but not enough to be a good dark beer. Bland bittering hops and none too many of them. The only redemption is a mildly interesting bittersweet finish. Would work as a session beer in a pinch if it wasn't so overcarbonated."
"Dark ruby brown with a minimal amount of head consisting of atypically small bubbles. Dissipates quickly with minimal lacing. Smell is rather ho-hum--somewhat weak and dominated by grain tastes with only a bit of roasted darkness. The darkness of this beer is also rather weak in its taste. Yeast flavors come through every bit as strongly. Turns a little crisper at the end, which is pleasant. Mouthfeel is a bit clingy but remains lighter than it might be. It's as drinkable as any mainstream brew, a category in which Heineken comfortably resides."
"Pours a dark brown color with a tan head that lasted through a few swallows. It's nice to taste a Heinekin product in a brown bottle. Nice malty taste. Kind of reminds me of a Newcastle Brown. I really like this stuff. It would really make a nice session beer."
"Pours a clear dark brownish copper color with a very thin tan colored head. Nose is dominated by sweet malts and grains with a hint of fruitiness. Taste is roasted malts with notes of caramel and dark bread. A strong maltiness is present both upfront and in the finish. This is a decent beer, but it doesnt really have any distinguishing characteristics aside from the strong maltiness."
"I note with satisfaction that this beer is packaged in brown glass rather than the familiar Heineken green."
"Heineken Special Dark Beer is a well built dark beer that satisfied my taste for both a stout and a porter at the same time. Although a bit thin for a stout or porter, if your not too picky this one will be a winner, it was for me."
"Pours a dark tea color with a 2 finger tan head.  The smell is extremely faint.  Maybe a little caramel and slightly sweet smell to it, but really hard to tell.  It has a slightly creamy mouthfeel with an earthy/musty taste...but not offensive.  It has a light to medium body and almost a bit watery at the finish.  Okay beer.  Prosit!"
"Light brown / garnet hue w/ a head that settle into a thin but persistent layer.  The aroma consists of lightly toasty Munich malt, a bit of dark caramel and a touch of chocolate malt.  Hop nose is completely absent.  The malt profile and body is lacking for a Dunkel, consisting of understated Munich malt and light chocolate.  Hop bitterness is low and lets residual malt sweetness to assert itself.  There's really not much else there flavorwise.  The finish is a bit grainy and sweet.  This is a pretty insipid example of the style."
"Reddish-brown, tan head that doesn't hold. No real smell to speak of. No real taste to speak of either. Slight bitter after-taste. Watery."
"Dark-brown/red with tan head.  Aroma was not appealling in the least and try as I did, I could not identify any specific smells.  Highly carbonated... after puring in the bottle, it fizzed like sode for a short time.  Malty and moderately bitter.  I ended up not wanting to finish this beer."
"Had to force my way through it. Almost no flavor and the metallic aftertaste was unpleasant to say the least. Not bad looking, though."
"Notes: Not too shabby, if you like dark lagers this is not really that bad. It is somewhat middle of the road but there are no off flavours or complexities that jump out and make your taste buds scream."
"Sweet with a pronounced apple aroma.  Some caramel malt, but not much.  Mildly hopped.  Mouthfeel was thin.  Not very satisfying."
