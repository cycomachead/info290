4.33,35.7,4.25,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Brasserie Pietra is a French brewery on the isle of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea. Corsica is known for its production of chestnuts, and the beer is brewed with chestnut flour. Not surprisingly, the clear amber-colored beer actually tastes of chestnuts. It's balanced, fluctuating between a sweet maltiness and a drying bitterness that may be in part due to the chestnuts themselves. The body is medium with a dextrinous edge and a median carbonation. At 6.0 % alcohol by volume it's strong, but not overly so, and the alcohol is well-cloaked. Probably best served well-chilled to begin with, it's a unique and interesting beer that's well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","0"

There was nothing amazing going on here, but I still quite enjoyed this one, and these days, for me to enjoy a lager is saying a lot. Light-medium body, smooth, clean, basic, easily drinkable.

Well, the beer pours an appealing color: burnt ambers, copper, and bronze, all of differing tones, capped with a simple (and shallow) white head. It's a decent looking beer. The aroma carries a little malt and sugar, but little else. The taste, is restrained, but there is a notable nut character. I expected the chestnut to stand out more (I was thinking of the sweet meat inside a roasted chestnut, but got chestnut flour). There's a touch of bitterness and rustic qualities that I assume come from the nuts, along with a bit of chestnut flavor that carries on throughout the beer. Medium body, but a nice flavor.
