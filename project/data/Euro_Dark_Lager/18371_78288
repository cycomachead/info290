3.97,1.3,3.75,4.25,3.75,4.25,4,"A very drinkable toasty lager, the Lovely Saint Winefrede is a fairly dry, light-viscosity dark beer that's nonetheless bursting with burnt-caramel sweetness, warmed oak and maple seasoning, well-toasted brown bread textures, and a lot of medium-roast Colombian coffee qualities sprinkled around the flavor-complex.  It has a dry, espresso, biscuit, and booze nose; decent head that deflates over ten minutes or so; and a lurking buoyancy in the weight along the tongue that keeps this beer both afloat and tethered to its lager-heart.  Nonetheless, its clarion brown color, its not-fully-burnt, brown-malty-sweet backbone—which underlies the more burnt, coffee-tasting top-layers (which I assume result from the "decoction")—and its richly warm quaffability  hem Lovely Saint Winefride firmly in a "brown" frame of reference, despite its lager-premised creative process.","OrestesMethuon","Mar 09, 2015"

3.96,1,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"Poured into a flute glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a thin light tan head that dissipates to a ring around the glass. Nice aroma of toasted malt and chocolate. Flavor is toasted malt, charred coffee and chocolate, light grassy hops. Medium bodied. A nice ale on the border between porter and brown ale, but with more char and chocolate than usually encountered in those two styles.

4.08,4.1,4.25,3.75,4.25,4.25,4,"The beer pours a dark brown, and sits in the glass as almost black with a deep maroon tint to it and a rocky finger width sandy head made of medium sized bubbles that smooth out on top to create a creamy texture. The body is lager clean and full of racing bubbles that refill the head. The beer’s lacing is dry and sticky on the sides of the glass, leaving thick sheet on the glass. On the nose, the beer smells warmly roasty with hints of coffee, bakers chocolate, and nice nutty scents. Theirs a slight metallic tinge to the smell, presumably coming from the lager yeast. It is a pleasing yet clean smell. On the tongue, the beer tastes roasted sweet and bitter with a faint hint of an acidic tingle. The balance between hoppy bitter and a roasted bitter seems to be well played out in this beer. The flavor begins with roasted nut flavors and a touch of char. The finish is oddly dampered and mellow compared to the rest of the taste, bringing light sweet bread flavors to mind with a hint of raisin and date dark fruit flavors. The aftertaste returns to the roast of the malts, which touch slightly charred flavors. As the beer warms, the dark fruit flavors rise in the mouth and linger in the aftertaste. On the mouth, the beer feels clean and crisp on the mouth. It feels on the high end of light in body, and leaves the mouth with a nice light dry roast in the mouth. Overall, this is a lovely dark lager with some really nice roasty malt qualities. I think its timing in release is perfect, as Pretty Things releases it just as winter begins to loosen its grip on the land. The beer is light and drinkable, but with some lovely dark beer roast flavors and nuances. The touch of dark fruit on the finish adds a lovely layer of complexity to this beer, and reminds me slightly of Triple Bag by Long Trail, on lighter. This beer is delicious and quite drinkable. Try it.","Maxwell","Mar 22, 2013"

Enjoyable aroma with a rich maltiness, dry roast and floral notes, a bit of yeasty sharpness, a bit nutty with a hint of toffee. Roasty flavour with medium/low bitterness. Light floral hoppiness with bread and malt character nicely balanced to keep it from being overly sweet. Mild toffee and cocoa. Grassy bitterness in the finish. Medium to full body with creamy carbonation, slight astringency. Nice texture overall. This was an enjoyable beer and I would purchase it again.

A nice sour mash edge, nice. The flavor excites with unheard of earthy molasses, brown bread and bitter charcoal. There’s a nice grassy hop here that finishes a bit dry like a nice brown ale but delivers a certain bock-like quality and it is very drinkable from a chilled glass.

3.86,-1.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4," The taste of this is not like most lagers...more bock-like with some gentle raisin and slight toasted malt with a light nutty roasted tinge with more spice as it goes on. The hops have a very herbal quality and lasting bite as they increasingly take over the malt from mid-taste until the dry finish. Each taste starts the ride over again with the malt in front and keeps a decent amount of chewy and almost biscuit-like tastes. Overall I enjoyed this for what it is- a unique lager with higher than average hop presence. It is kind of like a brown pilsner or hoppy bock depending which way your palate favors. I like that it is a style bender.","Slatetank","Mar 18, 2012"

3.91,-0.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"22oz bottle served in a pilsener glass at 53 degrees. Pours a semi-hazy brown with red highlights when backlit. Head is one inch, dense and cream-colored and eventually settles into a creamy, broken slick. Thick, textured rings of lacing coat the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses toasted malts, a nutty character and a trace of wet cardboard - reminds me of a nut brown ale. Taste consistent with nose, although thankfully no wet cardboard. I have to say that the flavor profile is very well-rounded. There's is almost a nutty sweetness, but a pleasant, light,earthy hops bittering peaks out and cuts it to keep it from being cloying. There's also a slight ashiness or char towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a consistent carbonation level that falls just short of lively. There's also a slight acidity present. Overall, I can't say that I am rating this to style; however, I did quite enjoy this beer. As previously stated, this beer had a lot of qualities reminiscent of a nut brown ale, in my opinion. That said, I found it really well-balanced and quite drinkable. The $7.99 pricetag would probably keep me from buying this beer on a regular basis, but it has definitely piqued my interest in exploring this style further.","Jwale73","Mar 10, 2012"
