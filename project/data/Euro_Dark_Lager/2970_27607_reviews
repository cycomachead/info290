"Sweet and more full-bodied than what you find in this part of the world. I think that it had a nice, fruity complexity and was well done."
"when in Thailand and all you can find is light lagers this beer is like Carmel Gold"

"This is a big miss, in just about every way."

"This is one amazing beer. I was in a discount grocery store and stumbled upon this, selling for just $2.99 for a 6 pack. Seriously, $2.99. I have tried a few discounted beers, and so far, they rank up there with the best micro brews I have had. Smooth and Zesty! This is one of them, and even my girlfriend (who is not too huge a beer fan) agrees. Amazing is all I can say. It honestly is one of the best tasting micro brews I have ever had. That with the $2.99 price? Unbelievable, like seriously unbelievable. This is a beer that you can drink 1 after another, or drink with a good steak or burger. It is cheaper than most micro brews by 3x (at least at this store here in cali), and tastes as good or better. If you like dark beers, you gotta get your lips on these. I am all for American brews, but this imported brew blows American brews out of the water. As I was drinking it, I was thinking about the cost to make it, bottle it, import it on boats from thousands of miles away, and how it still is so cheap and so damn good tasting. I am blown away. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it is the first time I have had it."

"Beerlao Dark does not compare to the dark lagers of continental Europe but it's one of the more approachable, flavourful, and all around better beers I've tried from Southeast Asia. Having never traveled there I imagine this may be as good as it gets in that part of the world (a reasonable assumption given the awful exports I've been subjected to)."

"Decent dark lager. Its body is a bit too thin and boozy, but its hoppy and caramel profile were a positive surprise. Overall it became an interesting beer."

"O_Not bad as far as Asian lagers go. It goes well with spicy food."
""
""
" The flavor has a mild cereal and bready malt flavor which is mildly sweet essence with toastiness of lightly roasted malt and gentle yeast which has a tangy flavor but not over the top, just enough to notice as it finishes with a slight crisp bran-like taste with a mix of sweetness and earthy malt flavors with slight residual sweetness as it finishes with a slight dark brown sugar accent. Overall a pretty decent dark lager, not the best, but has a nice drinkability and was better than expected"
"The appearance is dark mahogany with crimson highlights. Big soapy white head that hangs around for a long time. The aroma is pretty faint. Some lager yeast, dark fruits, brown bread. Prickly carbonation (too prickly actually) with some hop bitterness in the back. A tad sweet. Light to medium in body. Ok."
"M- Not too heavy. Sweet and boozy while still managing to be drinkable and refreshing."
""
"Overall- Slightly above average. Wouldn't purchase again but I wouldn't refuse it if someone offered it to me."
"O: This is a surprising easy to drink Euro Dark Lager with a slightly lighter body which makes it good for drinking in warm weather. Pairs well with intensely flavorful foods."

"O/D - An OK dark lager. Definitely a step up from the run of the mill yellow lagers around the country. I could have a few of these but it really doesn't stand out too much style wise. Decent, but off style and far too sweet."
"For our first experience with Beerlao Euro Dark Lager, I am very impressed. I will be buying more of this in the near future. I bet this would be a great beer to pair with some brown rice sushi or with an Asian chicken dish."
""
"O: Interesting and a little better than expected."

"This is a pretty simple, one-dimensional beer. If this were American it'd be a poorly put together amber lager. As a European lager I give it slightly more credit. Nonetheless, it's disappointing and forgettable."
"Quite disappointed with this beer like the other beer lao. It is just a sweet and malty bland beer with some caramel and just a hint of spices. Quite sweet and sugary. Very little bitterness. Has some of that old lager flavor but for the most part it goes down fairly easy. Itâ€™s still drinkable, but far from a great beer."
"Overall: a decent and drinkable dark lager. I'm going to award some bonus points here for the light smokiness, which really is a treat here (again, if not to-style)."
"This is a decent beer, but nothing exceptional."
"Pours a transparent, ruddy color with a generous cream-colored head. Aroma is mildly malty and nondescript. Flavor profile is malty (dark malt) and one-dimensional, but not unpleasant. An easy-to-drink beer with enough flavor to keep you interested, but nothing to write home about."
"I used to buy this all the time at a Thai restaurant on 9th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen, New York City. Matched my tom yum fried rice amazingly well. It is one of the darkest lagers i've seen from Southeast Asia, only comparable to ABC Stout from Singapore (although this beer is much better). The smell is enjoyable with lots of nutty notes (even more than most Guinness sold abroad). But the highest note for this beer (as it should be for any) is the taste. Amazingly smooth yet thick in the way a good dark lager should be, this brew fulfills all of my expectations of what I want when I order a dark beer. Hard to find, but if you can, get a bottle and enjoy it! A great representation for the country of Laos!"

"D: drinkable? yes. desirable? hardly. cool to sample a brew from Laos, but otherwise not really worth seeking."
""
"Pours a super dark brown w/ a one finger cocoa head. Impossible to see through, and almost zero lacing on my snifter glass. Nose is that of caramel malt, nuttiness, and diapers. Not a big fan of that last smell. Fortunately, I don't get the diaper in the taste, just caramel malt and nuttiness. Maybe a hint of chocolate as well. Mouthfeel is probably the strongest part of this beer. It's full bodied malty- actually pretty good. Overall, I would not seek this beer out again. My first brew from Laos though, so I wanted to check it out. Cheers."
"Surprisingly Beerlao has created a pretty decent beer here. This is my first Laotian beer and I have to admit I was honestly surprised. The beer has a nice nutmeg brown color, and a somewhat spicy aroma. The beer pours smoothly and goes down smoothly. It tastes very clean and goes down smoothly. The beer has a decent amount of alcohol in it but does not have the overly sweet taste usually asociated with higher alcohol content beers. A worthy effort, I look forward to finding more Laotian beers in the future."
"Overall- I fully expected a lot less flavor than this. Nice beer. 4/5"
"O - Overall this is a surprisingly good beer. Definately a hidden gem this is a tasty beer from a country I, quite honestly, wasnt expecting something good from. Would definately purchase this again."
"O - I found this beer to be surprisingly good. I would definitely have it again."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a solid pilsner and caramel malt scent that's sweet to the nose, but also dry in the finish. There's also a metallic character as well that takes away from the aroma. The taste is decent. It has a smooth caramel malt flavor laid over a base of pilsner malts. It goes down easy with a velvety sweetness and mouthfeel and finishes dry with a slight metallic edge. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty solid dark lager. It's an easy drinker with good malt character."
"Really good drinkable not too light yet not too overburden load. I would definitely pick this one up again."
"summary: i enjoy this one and if i have a chance to travel to Laos i can say that i'll have another dark lager there."
"D - I wouldn't go back for another."
"I enjoyed this beer a lot if for no other reason than that I can cross off another Southeastern Asian country off my ""To Drink"" list!"
"Overall, about what you'd expect from the style. Give it a shot if you're interested."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a small head. Smell is of caramel and malts. Taste is good, a bit nutty, malts are there as well as a hint of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality brew."
"Very easy to drink; dark in color, but the flavor doesn't reflect that too much other than a slightly toasted tone. A good pick to change things up."
"Overall it was a solid, enjoyable beer and boasted one of the higher ABVs you're going to find in an Asian beer available in Shanghai."
"d- okay, i just happened upon a free single of this and figured why not. it's not an awesome beer, but it's solid. i probably won't pick it up again though."
"D: It's quite drinkable for a dark beer and is particularly suited for drinking during the summer months (or Southeast Asian climate)."
"D: Decent, and I can see it complementing Laotian food well by providing respite from the strong flavors."
"Apparently the easiest beer from Southeast Asia for me to acquire out here in NoVa. Huh. Anyway, it pours a clear dark tawny with about half a finger of light ecru mini-foam on top. The nose is dark wheat, cinnamon, and nutmeg; a helluva lot better than I was expecting (I blame Thailand and 'Nam for this). The taste doesn't deviate too far, with notes of dark malts, wheat, and a slight underlying sweetness. Honestly, this may be the best-tasting Euro Dark I've had in a long goddamn time. Who'da thunk it? The body is light, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a rather watery feel. Not an optimal feel, but a surprisingly highly drinkable brew nonetheless. Right on, Laos."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Mystery bits in bottom of glass that may or may not be yeast. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Faint malty nose. Flavor reminds me of honey cough syrup. Far better than their Lager. $1.85 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Dmooth, light effervescence, medium-full body. Some hops in aftertaste after warming. Quite a good beer"
"The body on this beer is a bit light for the style, it initially feels medium, but really is a bit too watery on the way down. Flavor has an earthiness to it, and exhibits a decent malty character. Weakness is the lack of any balanced sweetness. Makes you wonder how water from different regions affects the beer - in this case, its a negative to me. Overall a fairly drinkable beer, and better than any other asian beer I've had."
"With exponentially more body and flavors than the other beers made in this region, for now, this is the go to beer in SE Asia (other than any imports you can find, which are scarce but increasingly available in some places). Overall, it is pretty easy drinking, wherever you may enjoy it."
"Good drinkability. Compared to most others I've tried in this style over the past, this one stands out."
"Dark brown with a hint of orange under nary a finger of beige head. Smells of skunkiness and caramel malts. There's a metallic thing going on in the taste as well as a sour overtone. This is really quite bad. It's thin and drinkable if you can overcome the flavor. Not for me."
"Can chen!"
"Aroma is fruity and a bit fruit-sweet with a malty undertone. Pours a slightly hazy cinnamon- brown with a decent cream-colored head. Flavor is crisp, malty, slightly yeasty and just a little fruity with just a tiny bit of sweetness. Texture is rather smooth and fizzy, rather typical. Worth a try."
"This would make for a respectable drinker in the hotter weather. Not the greatest, not the worst ever drank."
"drinkability is alright, its hot humid and this dark beer lao is easy to drink and a bit more tasty than other brew"
"Surprisingly white colored head given the deeper brown to amber hued liquid, you get about a half finger with average retention, good tenacity in what lacing there is. Fully transparent. Direct and simple nose based in caramelized brown sugar, cola bean, rice and processed flour, some okra or greens notes, over time a strong earthiness comes out, not much by way of fruit or citrus, for what it's worth clean dissolve. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation has a tough edge to it, adds some turbulence. Not that sweet, however, the caramel, honey, brown sugar the most prominent part by default. Can't shake that vegetal edge, maybe, just maybe some orange peel. More of the earthy, sort of minerally, stuff. You can drink it without pain nor suffering but once the glass is empty you hardly remember it."
"Skip this one, even if you are in the area."
"The taste is caramel and a bit nutty. The overly processed taste to the beer and what appears to be a cheaply made beer, is enough for me. This isn't good enough to suffer through. Perhaps with a fresher Beerlao, I would think differently, but I only have the one to rate and it isn't good."
"Overall I dig Beer Lao. The light is better than the dark in my opinion, but this is something I wouldn't mink having every once in a while."
"yeah, anyways, this one's just kinda there for me. has that kind of skunky smell that all important green bottles, or anything from the south pacific has. kind of a syrupy mouthfeel with a sweet, no roast flavor. this is pretty much how dark beers from warm climate breweries always taste! yeah, we'll probably shelve this at the store cause it will attract about a months worth of curiosity purchases but i doubt this will hang with other beers from its region like singha or tiger."
"Beerlao Dark is a very clear brown lager with a fluffy off white head that leaves nice lacing. It has a faint aroma of grain and vegetables, with a hint of sweet and a hint of sour. It has a smooth medium body with a watery finish. It tastes slightly sweet, like dark malt extract, with no roastiness, really. There's a touch of chocolate and caramel and maybe squash or yams. It's relatively inoffensive."
"Finish then ""finishes"" with long pleasant malt and hops. End palate and finish is strength of this beer. Not what I would call ""drink"" friendly."
"Overall, this is much better than the standard BeerLao, and I guess if I was stranded there I'd go for this."
"Drinkability: Especially for Southeast Asia, this is one of the more drinkable options. Being a dark beer, which in itself distinguishes it from other options, it displays a few dunkel characteristics as well, making it a good change of pace from the Singha variety beers."
"Dark, opaque and typically dunkel in apppearance. I love the malty aromas with roasted coffee bean and toffee that isn't too overbearing. It's just right. The taste is a liitle bit of a letdown unfortunately. I mean, again, it tastes like a usual dunkel beer from Germany, but I feel that it is lacking character considering I've never had a beer from Laos before and was hoping for some ingenuity. I don't consider rice additives ingenuity by the way. The finish has enough bitters to keep me reaching for my glass, though the length is slightly short."
"Drinkability: Delightfully tolerable! And here I was worried a tolerable beer from Laos would be as incredibly rare a find as the Laotian Rock Rat."
"From a twelve ounce bottle - Pours a clear brownish red. Below average carbonation, and lacing. Smells of mild malts and mild hops...maybe some rice or other adjuncts? First sip is surprisingly lighter than expected, some mild bitterness. Weak malt backbone. On a whole not very good but better than their lager"
"This is a dark beer that goes down easy in hot weather by the Mekong River. I did this review after finishing a delicious beerfest here in St. Louis, so it faired poorly compared to what I'd been drinking. The truth is it's a damn good brew for the part of the world it's from. You're lucky to find any other commercially produced beer in Asia that's not just headache-inducing formaldahyde-brewed piss. Plus it's cheap... Cheers Communist Comarades!"
"Poured from a 12 oz single bought from my local Asian farmer's market for $1.49. This beer is surprisingly decent. Pours dark chestnut with an okay head that fades to a swirly cap. Smells grainy and malty with some notes of cocoa and cream as well as a touch of lager yeast. The taste is similar, with nice cocoa notes over a grainy, malty base that lacks the grainy sourness you sometimes find in these Euro lagers. Relatively clean in the mouth with a pleasantly creamy finish. Not bad at all."
