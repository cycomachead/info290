"how they call this thing a black lager i dont understand, i mean, while that might be true of this, it is certainly a whole lot more than that, and to call it that is a major understatement. more than dark malt and lager yeast i taste blackberries, fresh and sweet and almost jammy. if thats achieved with grain alone, then hats off to you moa! the feel is also different for the declared style, robust in both body and carbonation, perhaps a product of the bottle fermentation. i am sick of hearing people bash these beers and watching them sit on shelves, they are splendid, especially for the price, and while i dont love this as much as their breakfast, i think it speaks volumes about quality and uniqueness of this brewing culture. where to the berries come from, and all the body while still being low alcohol? all these bubbles make it sing like an ale, yet refresh like the stated lager. i am confused but happily surprised by this. really well made beer that stands out from the crowd. making something complex out of something simple isnt always good, but in this case its stupendous."

"Brown lager, Euro dark lager, whatevs - this sort of beer is already borderline in terms of lack of sexiness - so applying a yeasty, overly carbonated bottle treatment is hardly the cure, lads. All it does is transfer the focus of banality, a little like re-arranging lifeboats on the Titanic. Not worth the 10 bones this goes for around here, that much is certain."

"Food match: Would suit both dessert and a main course - I'm drinking it with a vegan pie that has ale in it and they go together well, and I could see this working with char-grilled steaks too, or with a chocolate tart for dessert."
"A delightful dark lager with a lightly sweet character well-balanced with roasted grain notes and a decent hop bitterness all rolled into a smooth drinking lager beer body."

"Overall not very good. The aroma isn't too bad, but the flavor doesn't really do well. Too many bad flavors, and aromas are a bit meh as well, way too much carbonation, not very drinkable. I def won't finish the entire 750 by myself, and I'm glad it was cheap."
"O: While this beer doesnâ€™t have the strongest aromas and flavors, it definitely makes up for it in terms of drinkability. This beer goes down like a breeze."

"Another new offering for me from these guys and after a push again from my local i grabbed as i gotta admit this brewery scares me at times anyway it pours a light mahogany hue which leaves a three finger khaki creamy head and similar lacing,the smell is dark berries,chocolate malts and a hint of hops,the mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with tastes of dark bitter chocolate,raspberries,a hit of caramel and finished quite smooth,overall its alright but i would not buy it again thats for sure nothing memorable by any means cheers."

"12 oz bottle. Pours dark red-brown with a long lasting tanned head and nice lacing. Aroma is of funky yeast, bready, toasted malt and hint of hops. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of toasted malt, toffee and earthy hops. Finish is long, slightly astringent and bitter. Good beer to try once."

"O: An enjoyable ""rare beer"""

"Not a bad beer, not my style, but it can be enjoyed over a good meal I'm sure."
"Overall it is ok, but no Noir notes which I expected since it was aged in noir barrells."
"Price = $10.00 at Whole Foods (NYC)"
"O: While this beer does have some flaws and inconsistencies, it is still very easy to like."
"D - Overall this is a very interesting beer. I don't think I've ever smelled or tasted anything quite like it. Interesting doesn't translate into outstanding, but this is a good beer, and I will probably try it again."
"Drinkability: This is not my style but I do like this beer; very refreshing"
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades slowly to a ring leaving some lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Opaque brown color. Nose is slight malt. Flavor is caramel and baked molasses. Smooth, surprisingly good being in a green bottle. $4.25 for a 375ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Dark lager? No... really? If I hadn't seen the label I'd think this was a dark ale from the UK. It has all the signature citrus and slight bitterness of an EPA, with none of the pithish dry bitterness of American black lagers. Smooth taste, thin body and a nice malty finish make this an easy thing to drink. Bonus: nice curvy bottle shape; unusual but fits well in your hand. Don't drink it too slowly as it develops a somewhat corny smell after a while. Worth seeking out."
"Overall, pretty tasty. Nothing earth-shattering, but enjoyable and very easy drinking. More intensity would improve this. A cheaper price would too. $5.00/single makes this tough to repeat. But I liked it."
"Pours a slightly hazy warm brown with a decent, if not persistent, pale tan head. Aroma is malty and just slightly nutty, not strong but still inviting. Flavor is malty with nutty and hoppy hints - not wonderful, but enjoyable nevertheless. Texture is smooth and fizzy, leaving a bit of a tingle behind, along with a hint of hops."
"Poured hazy brown color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting and excellent lacing. Moderate toasted malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Session drinkable brew."
"D- nice session ale, not a chugger per-say but still good to sit down with a few(if it weren't so pricey)"
"The beer pours an orange-brown color with a white head. The aroma is pretty basic with toffee malt. The flavor is more of the same, lots of toffee. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad, but nothing specials."
"The best of the lot from the three Moa beers I tried recently. Much better than the original lager, and much more character than the blanc. Pours dark brown, almost black, with a nice robust head that is very finely beaded and pure white. Nice smells and tastes of bitter chocolate, not at all sweet, overlay the deep, smooth lager undertones, and there are some nice clean earthy notes throughout. It fades a little as it warms and picks up just a touch of grainy sourness, but overall a very pleasant beer. I will say that the beers are a bit confusing- with names like noir and blanc, the champagne yeast, and the bottle, you certainly initially expect a Belgian style ale- not a lager. Other than that, nice to see another craft beer from down under."
"Moa Noir is to New Zealand as Eisenbahn Dunkel is to Brazil. None of the three Moa beers I've had exceeded 5.5% ABV. Despite that, all three (including this) have been good to me. Moa has certainly carved itself a part of the beer market most breweries of its generation (Moa was founded in 2003) have shyed away from."
"D: I didn't want this bottle to end. Very impressive. When I swirled the yeast and poured it into my glass I picked up a slight Belgian Dubbel vibe. Very enjoyable."
"D: A great dark lager. Sweet, like a mini-dopplebock. Glad to try it."
"Notes: A decent dark lager, but fairly subtle in lots of ways. Easy to drink, I'm sure this is a crowd pleaser and would be a good ""gateway beer"" for some who says they don't like ""dark beers."" Could drink quite a few of these."
"Funny looking head, two fingers deep and dissolving fast, viewing it from the glass outsides big bubbles, from the open top more dense microfoam, no real lacing, leaves a brown cream dusting across the surface. Very clear amber brown color with red hues, the transparency is almost shocking, more ochre at the rims. Creamy, but not necessarily soft, nose of milk chocolate, malt, cocoa and a touch of cappuccino, still not that toasty nor roasty, brazil nuts and then subtle plum, cherry fruit scents, some sodabread, or scone like bread notes. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is broad and very bubbly, lifts things off the tongue almost immediately. While still heavy on the malts with chocolate, cocoa, coffee accents, there's more grain, cereal and meadow grass elements to give it erectness. Some peat moss and earth too. The additional hoppiness does not bring bitterness, more so dryness which leads into a crisp, precise finish. Makes you want to categorize it as a ""food beer."""
"After enjoying the Moa Original lager I decided to pick this up toaday and I enjoyed this to.Poured more of a russett color with a tight one finger off white head that settled slowly.Big chocolate notes in the nose with slight roast and a hint of smoke,the smoke is stronger on the palate wich was a surprise, not a bad one just a surprise.Chocolate and earth round out the flavor profile,its quite dry in the finish.Very nice dark lager beer,maybe the best I have had of the style."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, but finishes tingly, clean, crisp and dry. Tasty and drinkable beer, happy to have stumbled upon it in a wine bar."
"D: The carbonation on these beers makes them awesomely drinkable."
"D= Wow, this was a killer beer. I had wanted to try this one, but was afraid the green bottle would screw up the flavor. No worries there, this was like a beautiful combination of a dunkel and a porter. Delicious and sessionable!"
"Drinkability- Nope (See Taste)"
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a cola brown color with a khaki colored tight head that dissipated into a solid cap. Light lager aromas, a bit of roasted malt, wood, and tin. Bigger roasted character in the taste, some wood and/or smoke. The feel is thin with fizzy carbonation; finishes with a roasted bitterness. An easy drinking lager, with a light feel yet some nice flavor."
"The taste is rich caramelised fruit, burnt buttery caramel, bread crust (toasty whole wheat), . It starts sweet and develops light bitterness and a light yeasty-fruity sourness and it's zesty and a little spicey. It's very tasty, complex, with a lot of flavour and character. A lot is going on and it all coordinates very nicely. It's highly drinkable."
"Good stuff."
"D - Stout like flavours without the heaviness, I dig it."
"Drinkability- Overall a nice schwartzbier. Could have some more sweetness to be considered a contender though. Raped in the ass from the $7 bucks my wife paid for it. Maybe worth about $2"
"A great challenger to the German dunkels."
