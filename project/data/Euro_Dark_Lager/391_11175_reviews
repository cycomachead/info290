"Just imbibed two pints at a Calgary pub near work. Another Big Rock brew that has been around for a long time and I've probably had it numerous times previously without caring too much about what I was drinking. This is classified as a Euro Dark Lager here? Sure I guess. It does have some old world character and there's a dearth of obvious American hop flavors. A coppery reddish brown beer with minimal beige foam, one that smells vaguely like brown sugar and cereal bowl malts with a hint of grassy hops, overall a pretty subdued aroma. Tastes malty and sweet as well, there's a sweetness that one might as well describe as honey coupled with sweet dough (not sure if this actually contains said honey). Could be more of a light brown sugar effect though. There's a similarly light nuttiness, hints of cherry bubblegum, and some dry cardboard and semi-earthy hops in the finish. Thin and fizzy like a standard macro-lager. Nothing too terrible but what's there is largely forgettable. This is what Big Rock used to represent and still backslides into at times."

"D - Pretty much a run-of-the-mill brew for local Big Rock. A marginal improvement over usual macro-lagers, but doesn't hold a candle to true craft. This brewery is really only good as a gateway to bigger, better things in the world of beer. Problem is, some people get stuck here and never find their way to the vast world of craft beer. A decent brew, but I'll pass next time."

"simple stuff brewed for the masses, there's nothing wrong with it but not something I'd bother with again"

"Drinkability - Quite drinkable due to its lightness. I do not recommend drinking this with food as the food will surely overpower the beer flavoring."
"D: Went down smoothly. I'd drink more!"
"D - Drinkable, yes, but quite bland."
"D - I must say, I've found Big Rock beers to be rather plain, but was taken aback by the sweet honey flavour in this one. Definitely impressed and would actually order this one over their other offerings the next time I'm at a pub!"
"I have yet to come across a fantastic honey lager, but this one beats the bunch I've had. The honey is natural in the taste, sweet, but not cloyingly so. Overall, this is a very simple and sweet thirst quenching lager. Average at best, but a good alternative to the standard macro."
"I would highly recommend this beer. It's a very nice smooth brown lager."
"Light-bodied with low carbonation and a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. This a simple, decent, easy drinking lager if that honeyed sweetness isn't too much for you. I like it, but don't think I would want to have more than one or two."
"Two fingers' of ecru head with solid retention. Color was a rich, deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was sweet, but not just lager sweet, enhanced with a honey scent. Mouthfeel was medium with a nice smooth taste of sweet honey. Finish had a nice, smooth sweetness."
"Drinkability - really not something I would seek out. There are better examples of the style that aren't so overbearing and much cheaper."
"Final Thoughts: As a fan of Sleeman Honey Brown, I thought this offering might be somewhat comparable, but sadly it falls a little bit flat. I would certainly drink it again if offered, but I would not go out of my way for this beer."
"The bottle's gone fairly quickly, so it's not a pain to drink, but not one I will seek out. Not quite balanced in taste or mouthfeel, this is a mediocre offering."
"Not enough character to be really likeable, and not enough to demand one more drink, either."
"My strangely affectionate history with this brewer, coupled with this brew's overall temperateness, makes for an easy, if not at all complex, hot tub sipper. As far as the hotel management was concerned, it was Honey Brown Cola, all right?"
"Pours a clear and dark amber and topped with a quickly disappearing bone white head, leaving little lacing. Smell is bland, maybe a crack of honey, but otherwise phenolic and green apple like in both taste and aroma with only the slightest hint of honey taste. I wouldn't really classify this as a Dunkel lager as its not even that dark and has no real qualities of a dunkel lager, not really sure where this beer fits in but is not a beer I would seek out or drink again for any real reason."
"The beer looks better than it tastes. There is a sweet caramel note to this brew that decreases its drinkability. In fact the finish is too cloying considering this beer should be easydrinking. Pass on this offering from Big Rock and get the much better Trad Ale instead"
"This one has a nice copper orangey color with a good size white bubbly head and leaves very mild lacing.The nose is sweet honey and mollases and some fruity aroma in there too.Taste is a little too sweet for my liking,definetly honey in there and comes at you with a dryness to it,kinda tastes like orange marmalade,medium body with some mild carbs,not a bad beer i guess if you like it sweet,1 is good enough for me."
"This poured copper with a creamy head that dwindled to a thin ring. Not much to smell, other than some floral/clover sweetness and honey. The taste is slightly sweet with honey and additional molasses. No detectable hops. The mouthfeel seems right for the style, but there's not much to recommend here beyond saying it's not a bad beer if you're offered one."
"This one doesn't do it for me. Besides looking at it, nothing is very pleasant here."
"Poured as agressively as possbile and still managed only 1 finger of head. Some lacing stuck around. Nice copper colored look to this beer. Smelt of malt and sweet flowers. Very sweet would be the initial impression followed by a hint of chocolate malt and a hint of Euro mineral water. Kind of watery and too sweet compared to what is out there."
"Overall the beer is sweet, though not fruity sweet, but a cloying feeling in the mouth. It look pretty in the class--clear golden and crisp with a white, fluffy head the maintains good retention. But the aroma signaled where it went down hill--very light aroma, no hop, and the smell that's present is somewhat medicinal. The taste has caramel notes with a little nutty flavor, but hard to tell. Very watery with little mouthfeel. Just not much there. Maybe a lawnmower beer if it's the only thing offered, otherwise go another direction."
"Pours a clear brown/red with orange highlights, big white head, some nice lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet, honey and molasses, citrus and floral. Taste is sweet and honey/molasses, with some grains and citrus. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Not a bad beer."
"Smell is of bready malts with caramel and toffee notes, not too bad. Taste is less impressive, a bit too sweet for my taste, cavity inducing almost. Bready, but not much bite to speak of. Soft and smooth in the mouth, but and slides down pretty easily. Like I said, a bit too sweet for my taste, it makes my teeth hurt after a couple, which could make it hard to make this one a session beer...."
"I wasn't impressed with this one at all. Light brown in colour, with hints of gold. Fairly carbonated with some earthy hop presence. I hardly got any honey flavor at all, but I did get an unpleasant bitter chemical flavor. Not much body either... quite watery. If you want a honey beer, do yourself a favor, avoid this one and try Fuller's Organic Honeydew if you can find it. Even Sleeman's Honey Brown is better than this one."
"This would actually be a really good beer if it wasn't for the aftertaste. Just kills everything. All the Big Rock beers I have tried have this same unpleasant aftertaste. If this could be changed, they all would be alot better. I'd be willing to give this a try again in the future to see if it was just the case I bought, but I won't be hunting any down anytime soon."
"Not recommened."
"D- very light tart beer with not much hops to balance the tartness. It is missing any sort of malt depth that I would accept from this style."
"Deep bronze in color. Small but lasting head of dense foam that leaves some lacing. Smell of grain and ""Alberta Clover Honey"" gives a floral aroma. Taste is sweet at the start, but has some hop to balance - Very well rounded. Finishes with a controlled bitterness. I found it a bit sweeter than other honey-browns, my favourite compared to Sleeman and Rickards."
"Pours an amber color with a solid rocky head and some decent lacing. The aroma is mostly of honey sweetness with some soft fruitiness. Taste is of Strong honey with some floral hop notes and not much malt complexity. This has more honey taste than any beer Ive tried before. Its almost too sweet to be drinkable, but theres just enough hoppiness to make the finish palatable. Very watery mouthfeel. I dont think Ill buy it again but its not terrible."
"The flavour is lightly malty with the grainy toasty finish and a bit of honey bite. I think the honey must be giving it a lightly acidic character which is actually quite refreshing. That brightness keeps the mouthfeel light and overall it's very easy drinking."
"A clear amberish/orangey looking beverage, it pours out with a healthy frothy white head which recedes to a decent ring, and leaves a fair amount of lacing. The nose is sweet flowery malt, akin to a spring meadow, which always takes me to a wonderful place. However regarding the flavour, any present malt sinks immediately into the rich, sweet taste of fermented clover honey. No roasted malt character to be detected at all, which is what I usually crave in a brown of any kind. Far too sweet to drink more than one of in any sitting, this is bordering along mead sweetness. I'll stick to Grasshopper for now as my regular."
