3.5,4.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not too bad, really. Decent aroma, body, & appearance. Flavor reminds me a bit of a soft drink and carbonation is a tad aggressive. Finish is like flavor, yet not too bad. You could do a lot worse. This might be the best beer out of this brewery. I could see having another of these.","drpimento","0"
3.83,14,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall this is a decent beer with potential but not without flaws. The carbonation is a bit over-the-top and the sweetness could be toned down. A bit better balancing would definitely make this one a winner.","Phocion","Feb 16, 2014"

3.38,0.6,3.75,3.75,3.25,3,3.25,"Yet another random new Wisconsin brewery coming into the area. This offering is a dark lager brewed with Cascade, Centennial, and Hallertauer hops. Alright (spoken in a fake Australian accent). It pours a dark garnet-brown topped by a finger or so of ashen foam. The nose comprises walnuts, mild coffee, dark greens, and a kiss of toasted rye bread. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a distinct vein of strong, dark molasses that clashes with the milder notes surrounding it. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a decent dark lager, but that weird molasses-y bit hinders things flavor-wise, and the overly-high carbonation and a watery body don't help matters either. Beyond those issues, though, it's pretty good...","TMoney2591","0"
