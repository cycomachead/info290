3.74,0.5,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"how they call this thing a black lager i dont understand, i mean, while that might be true of this, it is certainly a whole lot more than that, and to call it that is a major understatement. more than dark malt and lager yeast i taste blackberries, fresh and sweet and almost jammy. if thats achieved with grain alone, then hats off to you moa! the feel is also different for the declared style, robust in both body and carbonation, perhaps a product of the bottle fermentation. i am sick of hearing people bash these beers and watching them sit on shelves, they are splendid, especially for the price, and while i dont love this as much as their breakfast, i think it speaks volumes about quality and uniqueness of this brewing culture. where to the berries come from, and all the body while still being low alcohol? all these bubbles make it sing like an ale, yet refresh like the stated lager. i am confused but happily surprised by this. really well made beer that stands out from the crowd. making something complex out of something simple isnt always good, but in this case its stupendous.","StonedTrippin","Oct 29, 2013"

3.42,-8.1,3.75,3.5,3.5,3,3.25,"Brown lager, Euro dark lager, whatevs - this sort of beer is already borderline in terms of lack of sexiness - so applying a yeasty, overly carbonated bottle treatment is hardly the cure, lads. All it does is transfer the focus of banality, a little like re-arranging lifeboats on the Titanic. Not worth the 10 bones this goes for around here, that much is certain.","biboergosum","Jul 07, 2013"

Too many bad flavors, and aromas are a bit meh as well, way too much carbonation, not very drinkable.

Taste is of toasted malt, toffee and earthy hops. Finish is long, slightly astringent and bitter. Good beer to try once.","mikeg67","Dec 31, 2011"

3.76,1.1,4,3,4,4,4,"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades slowly to a ring leaving some lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Opaque brown color. Nose is slight malt. Flavor is caramel and baked molasses. Smooth, surprisingly good being in a green bottle. $4.25 for a 375ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA.","jdhilt","Jul 30, 2010"
3.57,-4,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Dark lager? No... really? If I hadn't seen the label I'd think this was a dark ale from the UK. It has all the signature citrus and slight bitterness of an EPA, with none of the pithish dry bitterness of American black lagers. Smooth taste, thin body and a nice malty finish make this an easy thing to drink. Bonus: nice curvy bottle shape; unusual but fits well in your hand. Don't drink it too slowly as it develops a somewhat corny smell after a while. Worth seeking out.","gfreed","Jul 29, 2010"
3.7,-0.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, pretty tasty. Nothing earth-shattering, but enjoyable and very easy drinking. More intensity would improve this. A cheaper price would too. $5.00/single makes this tough to repeat. But I liked it.","OtherShoe2","Jun 07, 2010"
3.53,-5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazy warm brown with a decent, if not persistent, pale tan head. Aroma is malty and just slightly nutty, not strong but still inviting. Flavor is malty with nutty and hoppy hints - not wonderful, but enjoyable nevertheless. Texture is smooth and fizzy, leaving a bit of a tingle behind, along with a hint of hops.","Cyberkedi","Jun 04, 2010"
3.16,-15.1,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Poured hazy brown color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting and excellent lacing. Moderate toasted malt aroma.

3.75,0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The best of the lot from the three Moa beers I tried recently. Much better than the original lager, and much more character than the blanc. Pours dark brown, almost black, with a nice robust head that is very finely beaded and pure white. Nice smells and tastes of bitter chocolate, not at all sweet, overlay the deep, smooth lager undertones, and there are some nice clean earthy notes throughout. It fades a little as it warms and picks up just a touch of grainy sourness, but overall a very pleasant beer. I will say that the beers are a bit confusing- with names like noir and blanc, the champagne yeast, and the bottle, you certainly initially expect a Belgian style ale- not a lager. Other than that, nice to see another craft beer from down under.","Georgiabeer","Mar 20, 2010"
3.92,5.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Moa Noir is to New Zealand as Eisenbahn Dunkel is to Brazil. None of the three Moa beers I've had exceeded 5.5% ABV. Despite that, all three (including this) have been good to me. Moa has certainly carved itself a part of the beer market most breweries of its generation (Moa was founded in 2003) have shyed away from.","DoubleJ","Mar 13, 2010"

3.77,1.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Notes: A decent dark lager, but fairly subtle in lots of ways. Easy to drink, I'm sure this is a crowd pleaser and would be a good ""gateway beer"" for some who says they don't like ""dark beers."" Could drink quite a few of these.","SFLpunk","Beers"
3.72,0,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Funny looking head, two fingers deep and dissolving fast, viewing it from the glass outsides big bubbles, from the open top more dense microfoam, no real lacing, leaves a brown cream dusting across the surface. Very clear amber brown color with red hues, the transparency is almost shocking, more ochre at the rims. Creamy, but not necessarily soft, nose of milk chocolate, malt, cocoa and a touch of cappuccino, still not that toasty nor roasty, brazil nuts and then subtle plum, cherry fruit scents, some sodabread, or scone like bread notes. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is broad and very bubbly, lifts things off the tongue almost immediately. While still heavy on the malts with chocolate, cocoa, coffee accents, there's more grain, cereal and meadow grass elements to give it erectness. Some peat moss and earth too. The additional hoppiness does not bring bitterness, more so dryness which leads into a crisp, precise finish. Makes you want to categorize it as a ""food beer.""","farrago","0"
4.1,10.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"After enjoying the Moa Original lager I decided to pick this up toaday and I enjoyed this to.Poured more of a russett color with a tight one finger off white head that settled slowly.Big chocolate notes in the nose with slight roast and a hint of smoke,the smoke is stronger on the palate wich was a surprise, not a bad one just a surprise.Chocolate and earth round out the flavor profile,its quite dry in the finish.Very nice dark lager beer,maybe the best I have had of the style.","oberon","May 28, 2009"

3.83,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a cola brown color with a khaki colored tight head that dissipated into a solid cap. Light lager aromas, a bit of roasted malt, wood, and tin. Bigger roasted character in the taste, some wood and/or smoke. The feel is thin with fizzy carbonation; finishes with a roasted bitterness. An easy drinking lager, with a light feel yet some nice flavor.","Gmann","Jul 10, 2008"
4.85,30.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"The taste is rich caramelised fruit, burnt buttery caramel, bread crust (toasty whole wheat), . It starts sweet and develops light bitterness and a light yeasty-fruity sourness and it's zesty and a little spicey. It's very tasty, complex, with a lot of flavour and character.
