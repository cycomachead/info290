3.36,4.3,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Deep chestnut brown colour; ruby highlights show when held to light. Topped by two fingers of tan head. Fair retention and good lace. Mute aroma - toasted bread and light coffee notes, a hint of burnt sugar. Pleasant but quite weak. Malt forward, burnt toast and black coffee flavour, lightly sweet; finishes clean aside from some light char that lingers in the back of the mouth. Light-bodied with low carbonation. Thin, but not quite watery. A little slight on character, but what's there tastes decent.","mintjellie","Jan 06, 2012"

3.51,9,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Smooth, mild and easy to throw back, this is a serviceable, fairly enjoyable example of a beer style that I often find either bland or cloying. Potentially very sessionable if you are in the mood for something dark, but not complex enough to satisfy serious beer geeks... I could definitely see myself getting this again if I found it on-tap somewhere.","thehyperduck","Jul 15, 2011"

3.31,2.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"O/D - Not bad, but it could be improved upon. It's got too much cola and burnt coffee. Needs improvement, but it's alright.","tbeckett","Jun 01, 2011"
3.21,-0.3,2.5,4,3,3,3,"M: Very light body and taste, the mouth feel is too simple all the goodness of the coffee like aroma and tasting is lost with the missing malts or other flavors.","karait95","May 12, 2011"
3.37,4.7,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Not bad but seems to be missing something, either punch or body I'm not sure. Saved it for last but probably my least favourite of the 4-pack sampler.","bryehn","Feb 22, 2011"
2.74,-14.9,2,3,2.5,3,3,"Of the four that come in the mixed pack I would have to say this is the weakest. There's just not a lot that interests me in the taste.","MeisterBurger","Jan 02, 2011"
3.18,-1.2,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Certainly worth a try, as this is by no means a bad effort (indeed, as I can see from my review, ""not bad"" as a descriptor keeps coming up) - it just needs some work to stand out among the other efforts featured in this dark ale heavy province.","JohnnyBarman","Nov 08, 2010"
3.5,8.7,2.5,2.5,4,3.5,4,"Final Thoughts: Cameron's has always struck me as a gateway brewery. They don't quite brew stuff that appeals to the beer connoisseur but they are certainly not the kind of brewery who brews macro swill to get by. This beer is no exception, and is really the kind of beverage to ween someone off adjunct lager syndrome and into more flavourful beer drinking.","TheHammer","Oct 15, 2010"

3.13,-2.8,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Drink - A nice drinkable beer. Would be pretty decent as a session beer for the dark beer fans. I'm interested in trying the other variety's in Cameron's lineup.","spinrsx","Jul 29, 2010"
3.27,1.6,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark reddish-brown, but not quite opaque, colour with light tan head. Some spotty lacing down the glass. I can smell some hops with the dark chocolate malt. Flavour has a mild bitterness, but it wasn't too much to overpower the sweetness of the beer. Quite sweet overall, maybe a bit too much. Body is a little bit thin, but carbonation was nice. Easy to drink and have pitchers of, but not something to seek out.","kwjd","Jul 25, 2010"
3.35,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"A decent dark lager that would make a good summer quencher.","Reinheitsgebot71","Jun 29, 2010"
3.22,0,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"341ml bottle from the Cameron's Mixer Pack, purchased at the Lawrence & Avenue LCBO. Deep chestnut brown with copper edges and a sliver of cream white head. Some lacing lingers after each sip. Smell is cream, dark bread dough, brown sugar, pecan, fruity and floral aromas. Taste is basic roasted/black malts, some sweetness, water, vague spice from the hops, barely traceable nuttiness to finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied, thin, watery, only a touch of creaminess midway, small bite toward the end, drying chalky finish, no aftertaste. Easy to drink, but ultimately a bland and characterless beer.","cratez","Jun 26, 2010"
2.44,-24.2,4,2.5,2,3,2.5,"D - Very disappointing beer. It was bland and almost completely lacked flavour for me. After seeing the dark brown pour in to my glass I had higher expectations and this missed those expectations without a doubt. Won't be buying this again.","TheSevenDuffs","May 19, 2010"
3.03,-5.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"People who like this little flavour and character in their beers are not the ones likely drink a beer with 'dark' in its name. Colour aside, this has no difference from most conventional pale ales or lagers; it has no more sweetness, roast, bitterness or body. The brewery claims that it took 266 batches to get the recipe right - I suggest they try a few more.","biegaman","Jan 30, 2010"
3.56,10.6,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Light, but not too thin. The wateriness in the nose does not come through in the body. A good alternative to macro lagers.","BDTyre","Dec 18, 2009"

All in all very drinkable and would be a great dark beer for someone who doesn't drink a whole lot of beer especially dark. Although the colour is nice don't let it fool you. All in all a decent beer but I was hoping for a nice dark roasted malt, bitter finish. Well I guess I will just have to try all the Cameron's beers to find one I like.","terryeckmeier","Oct 27, 2008"
2.98,-7.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Kinda plain and disappointing, although I'm sure it would be a decent stepping stone beer as there's more going on in here than in some of the more commercially available beers. The vote is still out on Cameron's - one good, one bad.","bobsy","Feb 17, 2008"

2,-37.9,2,2,2,2,2,"Bottle: Poured a dark brown color ale with a medium off-white foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of molasses malt is quite overpowering. Taste of molasses malt are also overly present in this beer and its not something that I generally look for. Hops are pretty much non-existent and body is just above average. Id say this is generally quite boring","Phyl21ca","0"
