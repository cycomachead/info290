Off white head holds on nicely throughout the glass, especially against the dark base. Tried to get a decent pic of the pretty deep brown color. The roasted malt comes through, though not to the extent the color would lead you to believe. Also a surprisingly faint coffee taste, along with almost a nutty flavor. Going to look through reviews and see if anyone else gets that. Sort of a dark lager/brown ale combo. Off the top of my head, I think it is a better version of a Beck's Dark.","WesMantooth","Jul 25, 2014"

3.7,1.6,3.5,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"The beer pours a dark, dull amber with a razor thin head that doesn't lace. The nose has a grain sweetness, notes of coffee and roast, but not much else. It drinks with a grain-forward sweetness with a touch of fruit and caramel, but very little bitterness. The mouthfeel presents a lingering grain sweetness, good carbonation, a mild reinforcing roast, touch of chocolate, and a little bitterness. This is a decent beer, but absolutely average.","ThePorterSorter","Jun 02, 2013"

4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"At first, before I've identified the style, it's from the feel that I definitely notice this isn't an American bruiser of any kind, nor is it in porter or stout territory. It isn't bland, though, and its crispness and moderate carbonation keep it going while it doesn't lack smoothness, so that even as a light to medium-bodied dark lager, it works.","Brenden","Apr 27, 2012"

Smooth with toasty, coffee-like flavor. Pairs better with food than porter, but has a flavor that is similar. I was glad to discover Elevator Brewing since it a local brewery. Columbus Brewing's regular offerings are good but more for hop enthusiasts.","TuffNut87","Nov 20, 2011"

3.83,5.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a clear very dark amber color and formed a nice foamy light tan head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided.

4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Elevator Dark Horse Lager is solid beer from the gate to the backstretch to the finish line. Even though it uses lager yeast, it's really more of an American brown ale than anything else. Forget being a dark horse, this stuff is a favorite.","BuckeyeNation","Oct 30, 2010"
3.65,0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. For a brew at just over 5% abv the alcohol is quite pronounced but plays off with a nice subtle fruity flavor that meshes well with the other flavors. It is quite drinkable but a little too sweet for my liking and at times the buttery notes just dont blend well with the other flavors. As the brew warms, it picks up a bit of a light roasted quality about the malt that lingers in the mouth.","stakem","Oct 19, 2010"

3.82,4.9,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Not too shabby. Dark Horse is straightforward & plays it safe. Certainly nothing wrong with that. Still, with other quality beers available locally (from Elevator & others), this won't end up in any sort of regular rotation.","Ryan011235","Jun 03, 2010"
3.79,4.1,3,4,4,2.5,4,"Pours a clear dark brown color with a faint head that gives way to very little lacing. The aroma is nice, a caramel malt with some breadiness and some biscuit present. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone with a nice taste of toast and biscuits. There is also a hint of dark fruits present. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated. It is a little too much going on in the mouth. The drinkability is very good, a nice smooth flavor with a nice taste. There is a nice enough balance to keep you wanting more. The mouthfeel is a little bit distracting though.","goblue3509","Apr 02, 2010"

3.83,5.2,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Pours a transparent dark amber almost brown color. less than a 1/2 finger of head that dissipates to a then film almost immediately. Not a whole lot on the nose. A hint of toasty sweet bread. The taste is dominated by roasted barley and a bready malt backbone. A little sweetness kicks in before it finishes slight bitter and dry. This beer has the crispness you expect from a lager while providing nice roasted characters. The mouthfeel is quite pleasant, as well. An overall easy drinking and enjoyable brew.","Freethyhops","Aug 24, 2009"

3.45,-5.2,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Above average brew. Gives off a floral smell with roasted malt character. Not quite as dark as the name suggests but does taste more like a schwarzbier than a lager. Mouthfeel is average and is on par with red/amber lagers with a bit more weight to it. Drinkability is fair given the well balanced nature of this beer.","mashedpotatoes","May 06, 2008"
4.1,12.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle, it's Elevator's first bottled beer (purchased at Blacklick Wine and Spirits). Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with some red tints too. Head retention is average, lacing is very good. Aroma is toasted malt and nuts, with a bit of chocolate and hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, but the hops come out more in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's on the creamy side and has average carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and very easy to drink with a dry finish. Overall I think it's a good, sessionable dark lager (5.3% ABV). I'd definitely pick this up again, it's a good choice and the first bottled selection Elevator is selling in the Columbus area.

The finish is dry and roasty with a lingering mild hoppiness. Pretty good all around.","Dogbrick","0"
