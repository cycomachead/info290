4.26,8.1,4.5,4,4.5,3.75,4.25,"Černé Pivo is Czech for “Black Beer.” If you didn’t peep the label and no one told you, you’d never be able to tell that this is a session beer weighing in at only 4%. A first gulp reveals a pleasantly carbonated, sweet yet roasted, light bodied smooth beer. Since it is a session beer, it is very easy to put down but the full flavor of the beer makes it seem more practical to sip slowly and enjoy.","RummyRedbeard","May 24, 2013"

4.34,10.2,4.75,3.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Absolutely fantastic. I would absolutely make this a mainstay, provided I could get it on tap regularly or in sixers/twelve packs. The flavor is bold but its contituents are all well balanced and below the cloying threshold. Remarkably similar to some of my favorite schwarzbiers. Highly recommended!","deciding39","Jan 22, 2013"

4.28,8.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The beer pours a dark, dark brown, bordering on black, with the faintest hint of ruddy red coloring. The beer pours with a nice lightly khaki color head that sits a fingers width above the beer with plenty of tightly packed, little bubbles that form a very smooth top to the head. The lacing on the sides of the glass is thin, tightly packed, and moves out with tendrils along the glass. On the nose, the beer smells lightly roasty, with a nice bready tinge and some slight hay notes. As the beer is swirled in the glass I get strong waftings of milk chocolate with the slightest hint of sea salt, which has me very intrigued. The smell is light, lager-clean, and inviting. On the tongue, the beer tastes roasty, but clean and light. The beer begins with light and watery milk chocolate before pulling in watered down and light roasted malts that suggest very light coffee, and is really quite pleasant. The finish of the beer is where it really shines, bringing the roast to a full flavor and hinting at chocolate on the sides of the taste. The aftertaste rings with light roasted chocolate, coffee, and even a slight hint of vanilla. On the mouth, this beer feels light and clean in body, as a lager should, and is honestly a little watery in feel, though paired with the flavors of this beer, that is certainly not a bad thing. After the beer passes, the mouth is left clean with only a light feeling of dryness on the roof of the mouth. Overall, I love this beer. Notch has done it again. All hail the session king. It is smooth, light, and extremely drinkable, and yet still is packed with flavors reminiscent of a big old stout. This beer could be knocked back all night, and is perfect to sip in front of a fire. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Jan 07, 2013"

4.22,7.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Taste is sweet dark worty character to start, pop of citrus in the middle, and then cruises through the close with a sedate bitterness. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is awesome. Session abv, session flavor, I'm sold.","ppoitras","Mar 14, 2012"
3.38,-14.2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a 1" beige head with decent life and replenishing with more pours. The body is dark raw umber brown, almost coffee. Not a lot of smell but what I get is roasted malt, yeast, and a hint at sourness. The taste has very mild roasted malt, slight hint of sour. In the aftertaste black coffee comes out. It's OK.","MoreThanWine","Mar 10, 2012"

3.82,-3,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Very easy to drink but that is a given factor here, certainly a bold flavor profile for its size. Great to see Notch broaden their portfolio and further define their intent of brining sessionable beers to the public.","Jason","Feb 18, 2012"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall:For the style, this is one of the best I have had. I would make this more the a 3.5- 3.75 if not grading to style. I like to roastiness of this one. Not my favorite from Notch, but certainly one of their better offerings. I would pick this one up again.","tigg924","Feb 13, 2012"

4.1,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"overall pretty good. They def got plenty of dark malt flavor and kept the overall beer light and sessionable. Nice chocolate, caramel, coffee and roast without charred bitterness or acidity, hint of bittering hops, nice hints of lager appearance as well.","jlindros","Dec 29, 2011"

3.73,-5.3,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"O/D-At $4.19 a 22 oz. this is a pretty decent beer. Very sessionable at 4% ABV. Great mouthfeel. Flavor and feel mix together to create an enjoyable experience per sip. Perhaps I should give their other beers a shot.","VelvetExtract","Dec 27, 2011"
