"Expected a more full flavour beer.  Left a bitter after taste."

"O: A little cheesy on the nose, flavor is not too bad and mouth feel is fine. Not too bad overall."
""

"Overall - Unremarkable, not likely to be purchased again. Would rather have something else."
""
""
""
"acceptable. I'd order it if I went to a bar or restaurant that had it."
""
"This is another beer that to me would appeal to people that are trying to get away from the typical Bud Light type beer. This to me could be considered a gateway beer for future Rogue and Stone drinkers."

"I buy a can of this once every couple months because I like dunkels and it's one of the two widely available in Ontario (the other being the markedly superior King Dark Lager). So the fact that I'm even drinking this stuff is more a testament to the neglect of this underrated style than evidence of any real fondness for it. Still, until I can get the King more readily, or until another local craft brewery starts making a dunkel, I'll keep drinking this once in a while."

"These beers are tricky to find in Alberta, so I'm likely not going to search out this particular one out. Overall, it's okay; it is very drinkable, has no harsh aftertaste, and the nice dark colour can make it seem like you're drinking fancy beer if your friends are having Canadian. Still, i wouldn't have minded a little more caramel or vanilla flavour, and a heavier body."

"D - Not terrible, but not very good either. I think I made it through 6oz before I gave up and moved on to something better. More flavorful than the fizzy yellow beer that is so popular in Ontario, but only marginally so. Would do in a pinch over Labatt or something, but not something I'd buy again."
""
"Overall – Well… it was a little too sweet and cola like in flavoring for me. Not bad if that is what you want from a beer, but not something that I personally really enjoyed."
""
"A OK beer."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: This one has me at a crossroads. On the one hand it has a strange flavor to it that is putting me off and on the other hand there really isn't anything outright bad about it. Would I drink it again? No, I'm probably not even going to finish the one I'm drinking now."
""
""
"O - There's some sour & metallic notes that make this one miss the mark in the flavour department. The flavour is just light overall making this one is quite easy to drink. This isn't something I'll seek out."
"Pours a clean deep amber to brown in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, lager like notes with a note of caramel roast. In the taste, a caramel like roast in the beginning and the end, but in the center of it all is a basic lager. A small bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, small roasty lager like aftertaste. Well, it is a basic dark lager."
""
"Overall- A sub par Euro Dark Lager (if this is what its trying to be). Unpleasant aromas and bizzare flavours make this almost a drain pour. Disappointed and hoping to try a better representation of the style in the future."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A pretty decent product from the Canadian brewery, a good beer to either enjoy in mass quantities or with a hearty meal."
"O: Bias declaration: I just don't see the point of dark lagers. Either buy a lager or buy an ale. A dark lager tries to be both and ends up being nothing. Last time I try one."
"Urg. What is it with the stuff that Brick sends West? Both this and the Amber Lager taste like a buck-a-beer, with a stingy dose of caramel syrup stirred in. Not even up to Rickard's Red's oh so lofty standards. Uneven, and unappetizing."
""
""
""
"Actually like any boring mass produced dark lager."
""
""
"M: The sensation is not bad, refreshing as a good lager and with a lasting ending, again nothing important going on here, not smooth changes between sweetness and bitterness or in between..."
""
""
"This poured a dark brown with a tiny head, although it kept decent lacing throughout the glass. The smell is pretty non-existent, and the taste is roasted malt, some dark fruits, cola, nutty aftertastes but not really a lot of body here. Sweeter than I would ideally like, but it drinks okay and I did have two with dinner--but yeah, I don't think I'll ever think about this beer again. And it's too damn adjunct-y sweet."

"473 mL can with batch code. Pours light black with red highlights and medium carbonation, and topped with a thick tan head that never dissipates and leaves large patches of lace. Smells ""lagery," with strong adjuncts and maybe some roast. Bit of dough and caramel corn on the palate, with hints of coffee and chocolate. Bitterness creeps in later, but doesn't linger. The body is light and highly-carbonated, dry and tingly. Not too bad for an adjunct dark lager, and it tastes pretty similar to Yuengling Porter, but it's fairly pricey for what it is."
"O/D - Meh. Underwhelming. I was expecting more of an English Brown Ale. Not worth seeking out IMO. Not a whole lot of interesting stuff going on."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with pretty bland flavours and aromas."
"Final Grade: 2.72, a forgettable C-. I've never been a very big fan of this brewery's offerings, and Waterloo Dark Lager is no exception. To be fair, it's not *terrible* - from an objective standpoint, I'd probably consider it one of Brick's more tolerable beers. That being said, it's completely uninspiring, and I wouldn't be surprised if a few of the 5 remaining bottles are still hanging around in my fridge a month from now. At least it was cheap. If you're looking for something of the same quality as your average macro lager with a sweeter, slightly roasty flavour, this isn't the worst option, but there are certainly better ones (e.g. Upper Canada Dark, which costs less and tastes better anyway)."
"Pours a translucent, dark-brown ruby-red. A small tannish ring happens. The smell is different - peaty, almost woody and dirty. Taste = lots of mineral. Sweet sugars and slightly smoked malts. Carbonated well, lively. A ""backwoods"" kinda beer, not the best thing in the world, but decent imo."
"Overall – The beer was quite drinkable, but also not very exciting. There is nothing about it that would want to make me purchase it again."
"Not a bad dark lager, very light tasting with no strong features, but it is refreshing and creamy. Good summer beer."
"D - Not bad, reasonably pleasant and quite drinkable. There is plenty of malt character and while it is certainly nothing I would trade for or go out of my way to find, there is nothing off putting about it. It is, if nothing else, quite a bit better than the one other beer from this brewery that I had a chance to try."
"O - I prefer this when I have no money and grab this over other buck a beers but it is a somewhat weak facsimile of a dark beer (lager) - glad I live close to Grand River Brewery and not the Brick"
"Cold beer store special, tall can out of a bucket of ice. Good amber brown, clear with a soft creamy light tan head. Loads of brown sugar and caramel notes on the nose with a little spice. The taste is honey lager and medium roasted malts. The mouthfeel is slightly dry with a light body and a miner bitter finish. Over all, not bad for a Lager. Quite refreshing and an easy drinker but a perhaps a tad too sweet."
"Pours a dark brown, with some mahogany highlights. Creamy beige head that's fairly persistent. Leaves no lacing. Nose has some grain, very generic lager notes if that means anything. Extremely mild chocolate and some faint grassiness. Taste is some mild chocolate, metallic, some general creaminess (in the mouthfeel too) and a bit of caramel. Highly carbonated but too watery in the mouthfeel to leave any impression. Metallic in the finish again, and not a really pleasant drink to be had overall. A couple of redeeming qualities however."
"Really easy to drink and accessible to people that may not like ""dark"" beers, but too thin and overly sweet to be a regular in my rotation."
"This is a delicious example of an accessible dark beer for the average palate. While it will not be a favourite of the most hard-core fans of dark lagers, it is of admirable quality! Much more interesting than the average Brick beer. The rich brown colour and creamy head is appealing, its smell nutty (though not overpowering), and its taste leaves little to be desired. Feels a little thin in your mouth, but goes down like a dream come true!"
"Pours a dark brown colour with thick tan head that dissipates to leave a nice ring. Some rings of lacing. Smells quite nutty, with typical macro lager smell. Flavour is much nicer than a typical lager, but still pretty muted. Smooth mouthfeel. I used to drink this a lot when I went to university in Waterloo, I seem to remember it being better then, but I also hadn't tried too many beers at the time."
"D= oddly, did well before and also with seafood pasta. I'd drink it again."
"Decent, carbonated mouthfeel, pretty drinkable. Not something I would ever buy."
"Kind of bland but a nice change from all the macros."
"It's drinkable. It's OK, it's not terrible. It's nowhere near what I thought it would be, though. I won't be getting it again."
"Here goes #300 time flies when you're having fun. Another tallboy from the Canadian tour, the can thanks me for supporting a craft brewery, cheers. Popping the top and pouring the brew into a glass yields a dark brown barely translucent color with a tan head that foams then recedes. The smell albeit weak is of some caramel malts and red licorice. Taste of this brew is not too impressive. The taste is a very mild roasted malt flavor with some sweetness and no real hopping stands out. For the style I was expecting some body and backbone but this brew has neither. Mouthfeel though it is well carbonated is rather watery and bland. The best thing this brew has going for it is the art on the can. As for the brew inside the can, nothing stands out."
"D: Drinks pretty easily if the sweetness doesn't bother you."
"The taste is smooth and lightly nutty with balance between the sweet malt and hops. Some faint sourness and low bitterness. Nothing outstanding but certainly not offensive. Definitely not complex for the style (if Munich Dunkel Lager is correct). It's somewhat refreshing for a dark lager and I could drink this beer all night on any session occassion."
"Served in pint glass"
"The only good thing that seemed to come out of this beer was its muted quality, solely for dumbing down the strange chemical aftertaste. Not recommended. If you're buying local, get something else a shot."
"Very thin body, watery, very light on the palate, with low carbonation."
"Once upon a time (when Fort Garry Dark was new and exciting) I would have liked this beer. There are many better beers than this one available to us now."
"Also, where does it say this is a dunkel? The can I have only says premium dark, nothing else."
"Final Thoughts: Well, you certainly could do better, and you certainly could do worse. I'll be honest, I expected a bit more richness on this one because for a dunkel it's fairly tame. Still I wouldn't call it bad, by any means. I can see this being good with sheppard's pie. Worth picking a can, but don't go and buy a case."
"Clear dark amber with a slight creamy tan head that quickly fades. The smell is faint and malt heavy. The flavors also are tilted to the maltier side.. sweet maltiness with just the slightest suggestion of hops. Light bodied with seltzery carbonation, finishes a little too sweet. Cool looking bottle but the stuff inside just doesn't deliver much."
"Scary? That's an odd commercial description. Body looks ok, but I am not getting much as far as aroma is concerned. Almost not there. Slightly malty if anything. Taste is of malt and slightly coffee and chocolate, but just barely. Smooth on the palate though, which is why I had 2. I also like the stubbies."
"Waterloo dark pours a clear brown/amber with a thin quickly fading head. The aroma is the best part of the beer, with some sweet caramel malt and nice herbal hops. The flavor just has a hint of the nice malty aroma, with not much else. There is just a slight hint of black/roasted, but it comes off as astringency more than anything else. The finish is thin, and somewhat clean."
"Chocolatey sweetness to the taste, a tiny bit cloying, limited bitterness or hoppiness. A bit unbalanced, it needs a bit of hoppiness to grip it all together. Still, I enjoy the offbeat, sweet aftertaste. Definitely not what you'd expect from the dark colour. Thin, almost watery taste, but I don't necessarily think of it as a bad thing. It's an enjoyable, quaffable brew in my books, but maybe it's just that I've developed a soft spot for it. Try to get it on tap, it's worse in bottles and the worst out of cans."
"D-Not impressive, but decent enough to finish."
"Picked up at the Niagara Falls Beer Store. Poured out of the can a dark coca-cola color with some reddish hues that could be seen when held up to the light. Very thin head showed almost no retention and laced very poorly. Very sweet malt aromas. Flavors are a little too sweet as well, near cloying for me, sweet malt, roasted malt, caramel, a little coffee and also a little off. Sort funky, need more hops to level it. Finish lingers."
"Bottle: Poured a clear above average brown color lager with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of lightly sweet caramel malt. Taste is also dominated by lightly sweet malt note. Definitely too thin for the style with some average carbonation. Refreshing but a bit thin and lacing some flavour."
"I've had this on draft before and it was much better than this canned version. That's to be expected, but the discrepancy was too much to justify drinking this out of a can again. It seems to lack personality; no nose, little head and a timid flavour. It's really not awful and it does go down easy but it reminds me of a much watered-down Guinness. If you like a mild dark beer that's nice for porch drinking this could be your baby."
"A tad boring and not very drinkable. Bland comes to mind."
"D-yeah, right"
"Overall for a dark beer this fairly bland, a good introduction to the novice but not worth seeking out if your used to more complex darks. Its a hybrid. Worth a try,"
"Even with the lack of carbonation, it still was not an unpleasant experience, this beer isn't that bad."
"Mouthfeel is still average - I don't think Brick has ever been able to get their carbonation levels perfect, but I can't complain, as this isn't quite as bad as others for that. It certainly lacks the ultra-effervescent of macro beers. Drinkability, however, also remains high. The light-ish body make this a beer that's virtually designed for mass consumption. And yet it's just barely erudite enough to be appreciated by a beer nerd. It may just be nostalgia, but Waterloo Dark will probably always get my recommendation."
"I tried this beer on July 11, 2007 at Jack Astor's Restaurant (Front/York) in Toronto. The beer poured a dark reddish-brown into the glass with little head, and constant effervescence. What head there was...was gone in the blink of an eye. The aroma was weak with malt. The mouthfeel was thick and full-bodied. The taste was bland for a dark beer, some malt flavour, but not much else."
"Overall this beer is quite mild and easy to drink. Looking at it Id expect more punch from it. Easy beer to introduce macrobrew drinker to."
"Overall, its ok. I'll probably drink it again, but I won't go hunt it down."
"Final Statement: If offered, drink up. It's not that bad of brew. I certainly will never buy more than a single of this, if ever. Another mediocre beer I've had from Brick."
"Poured out a dark but clear color, like coca cola, but without a head. The nose smelled of old dust, a musty room, seltzer. The taste had maybe, at best, some mild malt notes to it. The mouthfeel was crisp, clean. A very drinkable beer, but why would you?"
"Quite thin bodied for its style. Not very refreshing either. Checks out ok in some categories, but lacks just as much in the others. Flavours are in check, but this beer just doesnt have any features that impress. Weak malt bill, no dimension of roast or depth. Aroma almost non-existent. A good effort, but not something that will ever stand out."
"This transition seems to have given Waterloo dark some dunkel characteristics as the hops have been slightly attenuated and the malts beefed up...a pleasant change."
"D: This is by far my favorite from Brick. This will allow the non dark beer drinkers to sample a dark beer, but still please the dark beer lovers alike."
"Note: I know this isnt a bad bottle, Ive had this beer several times before."
"Well, this was a big let down. Found this at a local specialty store where they bring in products you can't get anywhere else. It's not terrible, but not really good either. If the roasted malt at the start continued through to the finish, and if the mouthfeel was sturdier, then it would be decent."
"Dark, sourish, true to its style but certainly not the best example of it. Quaffable but weak mouthfeel. Modest taste some chocolate malt.Spot of coffee and nuts, the latter like a brown. Even a hint of licorice. Reasonable carbonation. Malty but not cloying sweet."
"all of this is completely appropriate for a dark eurolager, but it doesn't fit with the munich dunkel style. this is on the path to schwartzbier as far as smoothness and chocolate goes, and if I get a chance to do the brewery tour, I'll certainly mention this."
"The taste also leaves you dry and lacking, lacking for something else."
"D: Taste is quite bland and unoffensive, so it's easy to drink. Perhaps it'll win a few customers from the macro's?"
"Pours a rich dark brown/red, big off white head and some lace. Smell is sweet malt, some roastiness and faint hops. The taste is not very present, a little malt and roast but pretty bland. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, medium carbonation and an easy drinker."
"Another brand that Brick has put in stubbies. The beer pours a a dark brown / mahogony color with a short tan colored head. Too bad the foam is gone in less than a minute. A little bit of sweet malt smell, but not much else. I was expecting a full flavored, full bodied brew, but wasn't there. There is some malt flavor, and I found it quite sweet. Overall it is quite thin and watery, yet still very smooth. That fact does make it easy to drink, especially is people are a bit tentative because of the dark color. Still a bit pricey for a slightly above average lager beer."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly good. Overall, there's nothing outstanding about this brew, but having it on-tap is much more pleasant than my experience with the bottled version. I'm glad that a friend basically bullied me into trying it again."
"I was expecting to be very disappointed by this beer, as it was given to me by a friend who really didn't like it. After trying it though, I wouldn't mind having it again."
"tried this dark lager on a return trip to jack's in niagra falls. the first time i was there it was kicked so, i waltzed across the street from my motel on the next day to see if the had aquired another. they had. i was exited to try this dark lager that iwas told to be good. it pours a nice opaque black with a mohogany head that looked delicious. that was the last good thing i have to say. this was one foul swill. it had to be a bad keg or dirty lines. it totally ruined this brew. the smell was a rancid vinigar. the taste was dominated by a strong vinigar, creamy grossness although i couls talse some decent malts in the very far back. mouthfeel was almost impossible to register due to the overwhelming vinigar flavor. i choked down 3/4 of this pint and told the bar maid it was bad. she had almost no reaction. probobly because she was really busy. so i left."
"This beer needs some added 'kick'."
"Save for a nice looking pour, there isn't much else to say about this beer."
"I can't say I could recommend this to anyone else at all, not in good conscience at least, it is very mediocre and not worth your hard earned money (especially what I paid for it here in Alberta). I do like the stubbie bottles though."
"Quite undistinguished I'm afraid."
"Dark appearance, still somewhat watery on tap, faintly sweet, but with absolutely no life to recommend it after one glass. If I was offered it, I think I'd pass."
"As the last reviewer noted, I'm not sure this is a dark ale - seemed much more like a dark lager. I checked the brewery's website, and they did not identify which branch of the beer family tree this is from. A pleasant dark beer, whatever it is. Mild roasted malt with a touch of grainy sweetness. Firm bittering at the finish. Quite mild, overall."
"Amazing beer. I find it quite fascinating that someone has managed to brew a beer as dark as this with zero flavor. The appearance of this beer is indeed a little suspicious. Wait, I think I tasted something...a twinge of some kind of bitterness, burnt toast maybe. Strange brew...kill what's inside of you..."
