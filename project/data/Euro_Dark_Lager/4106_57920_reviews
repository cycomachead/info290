"Pours to a buff head that lasts and laces. Transparent ruby black color.  Slight roast and decocted malt aroma with a honey-like floral hop note. Flavor is reminiscent of molasses, coffee and toffee, with a balancing clean bitterness and hop spice. Mouthfeel is light medium. Overall an outstandingly satisfying and complex dark lager."

"This is truly a finely crafted lager. Poured into a 33 cl Žatec glass, pours a dark mahogany with an appetizing head. Wonderful complex caramel, chocolate, slightly sweet/roasted nose. Taste confirms the nose, and boy is there a lot to taste in this wonderfully crafted Czech beer!"

"Light rolling body that actually build up a bit on the back end. Nice roasted character and toasted malts. Caramel and toffee on the side of the tongue, burnt malt bitterness with a touch of alcohol heat. A little thin up front but has no astringencies."
"obviously well crafted but not something that butters my biscuit, there is nothing bad about this beer I would just prefer others before reaching for this"

"Good beer, faithful to style and very pleasant to drink. A beer not for drinking a single bottle, once it has a good mix between drinkability and flavor."
""

"Taste is dryish toasty bread crust, lightly sweet caramelised prunes & raisins, woody-peppery light bitterness, dry toastiness dominating finish."

"O - I much prefer this over the Zatec pilsner. A nice sessionable lager."

"Finishes with roast and light chocolate . Easy drinking and unoffensive."
"Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark black with a large off white head. Smells of dark roasted malt and some flowery hops. Tastes of malt with some chocolatey overtones and some hops, a nice surprise for a dark lager. Beer is carbonated perfectly and has good balance for its light body. Overall a pretty good beer."

"Overall / Drinkability: Quite a nice beer, but I find one is enough. There are aspects of this beer which are very much doppelbock in style (aroma especially, sometimes the taste) which perhaps makes this an even more appealing beer in he end. Tasty, aromatic, and yet one 500 mL is enough. I guess this beer is nicely sating as well. So while I tried it I'm not seeing a desire to go out and get more."
"An OK schwartzbier, but the wax-like flavours spoils it a bit."

"Pours a curious, translucent muddy caramel color (similar to Maudite) with a frothy tan head that dissipates in fairly short order. The aroma is mild and clean, with a malt sweetness akin to maple syrup. The syrupy sweetness manifests much more in the taste, which is almost bock-like. Not a whole lot of complexity here in spite of the saaz hops touted by the label. To me, the body is too light to support the malty backbone, which perplexes the palate and makes the beer taste watered down in spite of the pronounced sweetness. There is some consolation in the fact that the finish is cleaner than one would expect, but on the whole I feel this brew misses the mark, being short on identity and lacking in complexity."
"Overall, I started to like this beer a little more as I drank it. I feel that it's way too carbonated though, but it has a good taste profile."
"Well composed, balanced and easy to drink."
"Overall: Not a bad beer at all, though I wish there a bit more hops involved to balance out the sweeter flavors"
""
"O: Good drinker that goes down easy. Good example of the style. Well worth checking out."
"Overall: I wish this beer weren't so mild, but that being said it is still quite tasty and very quaffable indeed. I'd have this again."
""
"O: A little too out of balance for me to really enjoy - I want a slight amount of bitterness and/or hops to make the flavor profile whole for me. Not overly easy to drink... Not sure that I would really want to go out of my way to sample this again."
"O: This beer isn’t overly difficult to drink but could use a little more hops to help balance out some of the sweetness."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a dark brown color with some garnet highlights that appeared when held up to sunlight. The head was a thin layer of tan foam that retained fairly well and left sliding bands of lacing. The aroma was of chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, bread and toasted malt. The flavors were just plain delicious and I was impressed. I tasted lots of chocolate, caramel and some honey followed by some earthy malt and toasted malt. I also tasted some dark fruits as it warmed up. The finish was clean and crisp aided by just enough Czech (Saaz?) hops. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation perfect. This, in short, was the best authentic Euro Dark Lager I’ve ever had and I can now see what this brewery has been doing for over a 1,000 (!) years."
"I'll be on the lookout for more of these Tmavé lagers and I'll likely grab some more bottles of this particular beer in the future. Rock Solid. If other dark Czech lagers are anything like this one, I need to go."
"Overall: This is almost exactly what I am looking for in a dark lager. The effervescence and clean finish of a lager with the depth of malt character and well constructed hop profile of an ale."
"I'm a little surprised by this one as I didn't expect much but it was pretty good, I'm not saying this is a beer that's going too blow you away but for the style of beer it's great"
"deep amber capped by a slight off white head with good retention. scent is pretty clean, hint of caramel and yeast. taste is trending sweet with toffee and worther's origional like caramelly goodness, light grassyness. light bodied. This is a good beer, but not as good as another dark lager I just had from the brother neighbor to the east."
"Overall: This was a very nice alternative to all the lagers and pilsners of Europe. Porters and dark lagers from Europe are getting better with every one I review. That means they can onle be better across the ocean on draft. Someday, someday."
"A thing all by itself, and a gorgeous one, especially coming from a nondescript brewery."
"Thanks to Rob for providing the 500mL sample. Poured mahogany with a nice cap of foam, persists with good lacing. Smell is roasted, earthy, slightly smoky. Taste is more of the same with additional notes of brown sugar, charred toast, creamy mouthfeel. This one is good!"
"Pours from a 500 ml bottle, into a 1/2 liter glass dark ruby brown hue with a large creamy tan head forming nice and thick. Fine speckled lacing surrounds the sides of my glass. Aroma has hints of dark fruit a touch of raisin even some plum with a toasted dark malt breadiness coming together as well. A slight herbal hop finish comes through almost like a tea leaf earthiness in the background. Very nice clean chocolate malt presence with low roasted malt bitterness levels, mild herbal earthy hops very crisp with more fruit adding to the complexity of the malt character utilized here. Mouthfeel is creamy medium bodied nice dark lager, textbook perfect dark beer that comes off super drinkable. This is almost like the old recipe Penn Dark used to use before all their problems started, awesome beer so easy to consume it's simply pleasure in a glass."
"Overall (4): Although the Czech's think dark beers are for women, Zatec Dark is great for this man. The malty aromas compliment the coffee and biscuit flavour leaving a nice complexity not found in many lagers. A great dark brew (since 1004!)"
"Poured a 1.5"" beige head. Body is dark as coffee. There is almost no smell, not even as it warmed. Taste is milder and less interesting than I'd anticipated. There is ever so slight roasted malt and chocolate but this is clearly one of the lightest dark beer manifestations I've had. A little sweet in the aftertaste and almost no hops evident to me."
"Flavorful with notes of lightly charred toast, raisin, prune, and molasses. Light bodied, fairly easily drinkable. Dry finish, not especially sweet, but there are hints of sweetness there. Carbonation is fine, lending to a more creamy body, but it's still a bit thin, showing it's lager roots, not particularly a bad thing. This is surprisingly good in fact. Somewhere between a Baltic Porter and Munich Dunkel."
"Notes: This is quite a neat style of lager nicely drinkable I'm glad I picked it up. Cheers."
"The beer exits the bottle with a dark brown color and caramel highlights. A solid cap of creamy foam patiently waits overhead and then clings to glass as the level decreases. The nose puts forth a dark grain, bready sweetness and something reminiscent of prunes. Smooth as it goes down. Sweet dark malt greet the palate along with rich dark fruity notes. A metallic tinge through the center is a prelude to a dash of hops. The palate is left with the sense that it something hefty, but it quickly springs back to life willing and eager for another round--even on a hot day."
"Pretty good beer. Poured with a decent sized, foamy, frothy, thick, creamy, light tan head and a little lace. Color is a clear dark brown amber. Aroma is malt, roast, fresh baked dark bread, toffee. Flavor is similar to nose with a little sweetness that's nicely countered with the yeast, dark malt, and carbonic acid. Body is good, smooth and full yet cut again by carbonic acid. Finish is like flavor, has good length, and is clean. Session beer."
"Creamy mouthfeel, full bodied for a lager. Nice even carbonation. Overall it was very drinkable."
"Poured into a becker a deeper brown with a tinge of scarlet,a thinner but well sustained off white head atop.A mix of toasty bread and bitter chocolate in the nose,I picked up a little hard water as well.Quite dry on the palate with a big firm malt base,there are notes of bitter chocolate and earth in the finish.This a real nice Czech dark lager,its not sweet and chocolaty like some of their neighbors dunkle lagers,big and malty without being sweet."
"Zatec Dark Lager pours an almost solid black, with *faint* cherry highlights showing under the proper lighting. The foam that crowns this beer is khaki colored and comes to two, maybe two and a half fingers in height. Retention is solid, and there's a faint bit of lacing left behind. The nose is an nice blend of slightly roasted nuttiness and sweet caramel/toffee. The flavor features a role reversal as caramel is what immediately jumps out, with nutty notes falling more in the background. Despite the jet black color, there's little in the way of darker, roasted grain flavors beyond just a touch of chocolate. All that is interrupted by a subtle, but definitely present bite of bitterness from the noble hops. That transitions to a floral, slightly herbal finish. The body is firmly middle of the road, about what one would expect from a lager of this size. The carbonation though is lacking, and leaves the beer feeling a bit dull. Zatec is a bit outside of my wheelhouse, and is probably a beer I wouldn't have picked up on my own, but I'm glad I got to try it as it's a fairly solid offering."
"a great very drinkable beer which I'd love to find again."
"Just as I'm getting interested in dark lagers, Zatec dark dissapoints. I'll stay on the light side of Zatec in the future."
"500ml bottle from Capital Market, Salem.$3.49 Im guessing this is this beer..the label is very different but the alc is the same and its called 'Dark lager Beer"" Nice brown with a garnet tinge to it beer, with a lovelly ,huge frothy,thick creme coloured head. Aroma is mostly dark chocolate, weak coffees, and some breadiness. Taste is mostly the same with some additions of dark dried fruits and a brisk hop note in the end. Kinda thin but not too bad on the palate. OK"
"D - This is a really good dark lager. Not my favorite style but this is one of the better ones and very affordable."
"Mouthfeel / Drink - Easily drinkable and a little tangy from the cherry and lime notes. I was quite impressed with this dark lagers unique taste."
"D-easy to drink, not very complex, a good session beer"
"As of June 1st, this gem from a brewery in operation since 1004 AD is now available in the US thanks to Merchant du Vin. Rich, bright, leathery, dark brown with a tan cream head. Toasty malts in the nose. Fairly light bodied and smooth. Malty sweet with hints of brown sugar, cereal grains, chocolate and a wisp of smoke. Herbal, tea-like hops. Suggestions of grape. Bready. Toasty. Dry finish. A delicious, full-flavored brew, lagered for 45 days, 80 feet underground. Yeah."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is dominated by roasted malts. Taste is also very malty, some notes of chocolate. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Na'zdravi!"
"Dark, cola brown with a fizzy tan head. Dark fruit and cocoa in the aroma with a touch of noble hop. Sweet chocolate and raisin with butterscotch and molasses flavors. Light bodied with sharp, fizzy carbonation. A pretty good dark lager with flavors that almost nudge it into bock territory."
"Enjoyable for what it is, but not the same calibre as the Pilsener."
"A pretty good dark lager, retaining the underlying Czech bright pilsner characteristics, amongst the blackened malt upgrade. Easy to drink, and appropriate for this seasonally interstitial period in the beer-swilling continuum."
"A very drinkable brew if you are willing to try it yet I would prefer a dark lager with more hops"
"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the ""regular"" Zatec. I just don't like this beer because a. It is likely why most non-BAs hate dark beer and b. It's a waste of their time. Perfecting the light-colored Zatec should be their priority. You can still drink it and it has something over average macro lagers, etc."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a while if you're in the mood for the style."
"This beer kicks some major, major ass."
"D-I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but it's nice enough."
"Full of body and flavor, this is a solid choice for those looking for something a bit more meaty in a lager."
"Light dark fruit is added in the flavor. Soft dark plum and prune. The malt gives it a sweetness, like a Jolly Rancher candy, but not too powerful. Slightly chewy on the back end. Hops don't intrude much here, and being from the Czech Rep I kind of expected a bit more Saaz. But, still, this is a nice beer"
"The mouthfeel is about right for this style. From the looks of the bottle I was expecting something closer to a Schwarzbier, but this is still a nice beer with good flavors. I could definitely enjoy another one."
"Really drinkable and enjoyable."
"Overall quite a nice lager that makes me look forward to my upcoming month in Prague. A very nice balance of malt and hop, somewhat sweet, somewhat dry -- if not for the relatively high ABV this might make a very nice session beer. Hopefully I'll get to try it on tap sometime this summer."
