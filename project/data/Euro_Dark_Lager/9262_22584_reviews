"O: Another Euro dark lager. Par for the course if not a notch below. Drinkability suffers as the body is rife with residuals to the point of being sticky. Nothing here that warrants a second look."

"Quite decent considering it is an Adjunct Lager, plain but tasty with high drinkability."

"Semi-roasted grain with a sweet astringency of nickel, corn syrup, and light cocoa. Not terrible. Easy 'kick-back' beer. Drinks light with a rough carb-rush finish. Husky grains accentuate that coarseness."

"O: needs to be revisited with a sample that is definitively fresh. Reason #1345 for a trip to Spain."
"A definite step up from the other Alhambra beers I've tried. There was a great balance to the beer and the roasted malts are complimented beautifully by the sweetness and the touches of chocolate."

"Really a solid dark lager. Great taste and smell with that lager ""lightness"" to it."

"11.2 oz bottle at Rodega in Washington, DC. Pours brown with off-white, medium lasting, thin head. Aroma is of bready malt and buckwheat. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is toffee, caramel and hint of herbal hops. Finish is medium and dry. Drinkable brew."

"330ml bottle. Lager glass. From my notes. Dark brown color, deep ruby to the light. Brownish beige crown presents acceptable retention & short lacing. Roasted malt aroma, sweet touch & candy hues. Flavor profile shows roasted malts, sweet –no annoying- character , hints of licorice, anise & subtle chocolate. Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation. Watery texture. ABV is well hidden so drinkability is ok. Pretty decent Euro Dark Lager."

"Overall a very descent beer that I would definitely buy again."

"This is a decent dark lager. Very drinkable with well hidden alcohol. I've never seen this on a store shelf, so if you're in the downtown Arlington Heights area, stop in and give it a try. Just a 2 block walk from the Metropolis Performing Arts Center, so a convenient stop for a before or after theater drink."

"O: The beer is extremely easy to drink and almost goes down like water."

"Overall Drinkability - The metallic, astringent, stale, and acidic off-characters are so prominent that this beer has almost no redeeming qualities."
"O - This is more interesting than the vast majority of Spanish mass-market beers, however, it's a bit disappointing."
"O- Not a bad beer really. Made for a nice drink to go along with some really good tapas during a recent visit to Chicago."
"Bottle at a South American restaurant in Old Town, San Diego."
"Pours an almost opaque dark brown with a 1 inch tan head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. Random dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and caramel notes. Taste is very much the same with a roasted malt/grain taste and a sweet caramel presence. A very slight roast bitterness on the tongue after each sip that quickly fades. A good level of carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is very easy drinking."
"Finishes with a light dry roasted aftertaste."
"This beer to me was a bit surprising. I picked up a bottle years ago at my local shop and gave it a try. It poured out as a deep brown color, the head was pretty good looking and tan in color. The smell of the beer has some aromas of sweet roasted nuts and some burnt caramel. The taste was a little sweet upfront and slowly faded into a more bitter toasted aftertaste. The mouthfeel was a little watery but still had enough body to hold my interest. Overall I found this beer to be much better than I expected it to be."
"medium-light body, its just like a premium version of an industrial beer"
"D: Meh.. I don't think I will need to get this again.. definitely a little thin and odd ball."
"Poured a dark brown in color with brown highlights that had a thinhead and left almost no lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma had toffee roastiness upfront with coffee bean and faint vanilla notes. The toffee was more potent on the palate with, nutty, caramel, malts, and vanilla accents. The brew was light in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, malty, nutty, and crisp finish. It drank good and was surprisingly good coming from spain."
"Drinkability: After a few moments of deliberation, I cannot think of any reason to go out and buy this. Any bar or store that has this will have better beers available."
"Drinkability: Really quite uninteresting, don't think I'd buy it again."
"Drinkability: this is a very quaffable, approachable lager. Dark in color but light in intensity, the subtle complexities make up for its lack of boldness. Good stuff."
"d - easy going down"
"I'm not sure I would qualify this as a session brew. It has some strange aromas going on, which is welcomed sometimes. I would recommend it if you come across it. Glad I tried it."
"My first Iberian brew. It pours a translucent garnet, nearly clear when light is added, with nice black highlights (as though Klaus Jansen inked it) topped by over a finger of fluffy ecru foam. The nose comprises dark wheat, that awesome soapy smell that seems to hang around all sorts o' brews, and the slimmest possible slice o' chocolate. The taste holds notes of light chocolate, even lighter coffee, dark wheat, and a hint of hoppy florals and greenery. The body is a heavy light, with light carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Not bad for a Euro dark...if I needed a fairly inexpensive darker, lighter brew, I might definitely lean this bottle's way."
"Comments: This beer was featured in one of my beer of the month clubs. This is an interesting and solid entry in the Euro Dark Lager style."
"Overall, a standard dark lager. Didn't suck but didn't impress either. If in Spain or Spanish themed restaurant and faced with limited choices, I could have another but outside of that I wouldn't have another. [N;N]"
"D- Super nice drinkability i was able to pair many very excellent dishes with it and the best being some simple roasted almonds go figure."
"D - Overall this is a decent beer definitely not the first beer I'd grab but if given to me I'd still drink it if Euro lagers are your thing its worth a shot"
"D: Could definitely drink a few of these with a meal. Would love to see this offered at Mexican restaurants. Would be good on a hot summer day too."
"Overall, this is a good dark lager that I would reccomend to others, particularly since you don't often get a chance to sample a quality Spanish beer."
"Poured a dark cola brown into a tulip glass, nice foamy off white head that does not last long, some lacing remained after the head dissipated. Aroma was not strong, a earthy dark fruit smell. Tasted some malt, maybe a little fig or raisin. The beer was thin not much body body which you would expect with this type of beer. Was drinkable and I would drink again, however, I would not go out of my way to obtain one."
"Corn and other grain flavors appear up front but luckily soon afterward the roast and smoke flavors kick in helping you forget the lackluster beginning to this highly sessionable light bodied brew. The finish is pleasant. Very dry, with no lingering bitterness, very clean."
"Not bad in small doses, but that aftertaste shows up & just builds, which hurt my overall enjoyment of it."
"This is a very enjoyable brew."
"D – Very drinkable, quenching, substantive and pairable. This is mass brewing at its finest."
"Pretty drinkable... my first beer of the style, so I don't know a whole lot about them, but this certainly isn't bad. It's just not great. I'll have no problem finishing these, but there's probably better out there."
"Average stuff from southern Spain."
"The body was what you'd expect from a lighter lager like this. The drinkability was also typical for the style. Overall, a pleasant enough beer, I'd grab another one from the deli to go with a sandwich, buy I probably wouldn't seek it out."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is very mild, some malts. Taste is of malts and chocolate, finishing a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall not bad, but nothing special about this beer."
"D: Highly drinkable!! This is a nice schwarzbier that could be an easy session beer, especially with spicy Latino food."
"tamarind."
"D: A real nice surprise out of Spain which has been giving me some good beers lately."
"A deep dark brown color body with a short lasting light tan head , light carbonation . Aroma of licorice, brown bread faint floral hops and brown sugar . Flavor of toasted malt , caramel, cereal grain , light chocolate , spicy hops , and a hint of dark fruit . Light body, thin mouthfeel, with a hint of licorice in the finish . Drinkable and better than expected but nothing special ."
"Maybe a bit of oxidation in this one after a long trip across the sea and maybe some considerable shelf time."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is effervescent, with any bit of supposedly refreshing carbonation broken up on the palate and disappearing in no time at each sip; this is a artificially fizzy, super thin-bodied, really bad-made beer that has almost nothing to provide apart from sugary water - definitely (one of) the worst I've had in the past two years..."
"This could be a decent dessert beer, maybe with some ice cream or chocolate mousse. The fruit flavors would go well with that. On its own, though, or with a meal, there's just not much exciting about this beer."
"The aroma is dark fruit and toasted malt with a touch of paper. The appearance is dark brown with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall it's not bad but not good. It's one of those beers where you can feel the potential but the brewer won't get it there."
"As European dark lagers go, Alhambra Negra isn't bad. Unfortunately, it isn't good either. It has just occured to me that this is what Budweiser Dark (should A-B ever decide to go that route) would taste like. Bottom line: dumbed down dark beer for those who think it's cool to be seen drinking an import."
"Drinkability: Not so bad. Oh, wait, this isn't a malta?"
"From a bottle - Pours dark brown almost black but clear pale with a small almost non existent head. Smells of malts and corn. First sip is malty with some corn with a not much hop presence. Finishes well. Nicely bodied not typical of beers from Latin America."
"Thin body with not much going for it other then the fact that its cold and wet. Feels slightly watered down and has an unnatural processed flavor. This one I bet tastes great on vacation in Spain but here in the comfort of my home its a poor showing."
"Alhambra Negra pours a dark brown with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is a touch malty and a bit estery. The flavor pretty much reflects that too. No real hop flavors standout. Tastes kinda like a macro lager. No real off flavors, but not compelling in any way."
"D: This beer is very unique for me. I think a sixer is just what the Dr. ordered."
"This was alright, but seemed a bit tired/old, could be better at the source. Not a style that please me to begin with, but would take it over BMC or most Eurolagers I've had..."
"D: This beer didn't do much for me. While it did have some strong points, it didn't measure up with its taste."
"The mouth is slightly above pedestrian. Easy enough to drink and went well with the grilled octopus, curry chicken salad & olives."
"I would not drink this beer again unless I were presented with extremely limited options."
"D - tried it cold: didn't like it. let it warm: liked it less. maybe paired with the right dish it could be better... I have no idea how old this is, but based on the carbination I imagine its within expiration. I've moved past my days of being a beer snob (like I had any rite) and try my best to go at every beer I try with an open mind. we have american macro-lagers that turn their nose up at this one. Maybe this is an aquired taste?"
"The adjuncts in this beer make it a lower quality brew. I got this in my beer of the month package and it's the only thing that has disappointed me so far."
"D - This is a nice clean, drinkable lager. Even though Spanish beer might be viewed as a novelty beer in the US (and perhaps North America), this beer is done well and I believe it is suited well to quite a wide range of food pairings. I tried this with North African-style marinated fish and spicy Spanish rice and it was quite wonderful."
"This may be one of the more interesting beers in the wine-loving country of Spain. However, its mass-appeal style is not my style. It is different from the ubiquitous light lagers of the world."
"Overall: not offensive but weak watery beer. It can be quite refreshing for a dark lager but not much in there."
"Not a bad beer, and it sure is a nice treat to try a European beer not from Belgium, just to see what other countries are doing again. If I'm at Amada, I might order it again. But I just can't see myself buying this beer outside of a restaurant."
"Pours dark brown into a pint glass, it has a black body that fades towards the edges of the glass. The head on top of this one crackels and doesn't retain itself too well. It has a well balanced taste that isn't overly sweet and has some roasted charactersitcs to it. It felt a little stronger than the listed ABV, but still quite enjoyable. Matched nicely with my BBQ beef sandwich."
"Guess I was expecting a beer more similar to Negra Modelo. I am a bit disapointed. Instead of a creamy, malty, Vienna Lager, I got this grainy concoction of semi-roastiness and raw cereal grain. Not that this session was a disapointment, just lacking any of the benifits that I hoped to receive. The beer begins with a moderately brown, lightly headed, medium carbonated brew; eerily similar to an Amber Bock, but more robust in it's look. The aromas show a light Brown Ale maltiness, but soon follows with a lot of graininess and adjuncts (residual) sweetness, and soul-less. Flavors continue the part malt / part cereal grain character, with hints of nuts, toast, and grain hulls. Nearly thin in the body with an emphasis on an over-sparge astringency that hurts the drinkability. finishes quite grainy and void. Not the beer that I was hoping for at all."
"Not the greatest beer in the world, but not bad. Its generally hard to find negras in Spain, and I'm not sure I had more than one when I was over there, so I thought I'd try this here in the States. Poured a nice dark brown, almost black with some chestnut highlights. Thick creamy head with no lacing. The smell consists merely of a light sour graininess, and its surprisingly sharp. The beer's worst feature. Happily, the flavors don't taste off. It's fairly light with a little toasted grain and smooth relatively thin malts. Clean, and mostly without the grainy sourness of the smell. Light to medium bodied and smooth mouthfeel. A hot weather beer that is more interesting than some- especially other Spanish brews I've had."
"D: A very sippable beer, but it could use a bit more flavor to make it stand out. In the dark lager category, it seems like more could be done to distinguish itself, especially being from southern Spain, I expected some form of regional distinction."
"This beer was actually better than I thought it would be. Poured to a dark brown with medium tan head that lasted well and left decent lacing. Aroma was a little faint, but I caught a combination of malty dark fruits and a hint of licorice. Flavor was a semi-sweet molasses. Body was a tad on the thin side, and mouthfeel was a little tingly. All this led to a finish that was of medium duration and a little warming."
"I tried this in a Tapas restaurant and was not expecting this one at all. For a beer that has a modest ABV, this one packs a punch. It is a very dark, thick, somewhat syrupy pour. The head is okay, smell is good, but not great. The taste is definitely caramel or molasses, and lot's of it. Not a strong bite, some hops in the nose, but more malt than anything else. It's a good beer, not great, and I can't say that it particularly went well with the tapas I ordered, but it was a surprise for a Spanish beer. It's worth a try. L'Chaim"
"Notes: I'll have to keep my eyes open for this in the future. Judging by the number of reviews it can't be all that common. Would love to see this in some mexican/spanish style restaurants."
"This is a dark black beer with chocolate milk head that leaves stripes of sandy lacing all the way down. The smell is delicious milk chocolate. Tast is smooth, but a little heavy for the style. Before I looked it up I thought I was surely drinking porter or stout. Definately has the mouthfeel of stout. Drank it down no problem. A great brew."
"Recommended."
"An entirely unoffensive beer with a surprising amount of flavor. Worth a try for sure."
"I'd buy it in a restraunt that is lacking in good beers...otherwise I don't think I would seek it out..solid though"
"D - which all results in a high drinkability, very surprised and impressed"
"Fairly drinkable. This is a good Summer time substitute when you're in the mood for a porter or stout, but it's too hot for one."
"(11.15 oz / 33o ml yellowish brown bottle with the Alhambra logo embossed around the neck 4 times)"
"left me wanting for more, I wanted what I was smelling to come though in the taste. It just needed a little kick. Still the experience was still enjoyable, and would have you try a bottle if ever given the opportunity."
"poured a deep brown color with moderate tannish puffy head. Smell is attractive , being a nice roasted malt scent. Taste foloows through on the smell with a toasty flavor mixed with hints of caramel. Finished on the sweet side with only a mild creaminess. Very easy to drink, but not anything spectactular. My first beer from Spain."
"D - This is okay, but just okay. It's unusual in taste and maybe worth a try if you can get a single ... just to say you did. Over all, nothing impressive about this beer and I won't go out of my way to try it again. Drinkable ... not a drain pourer, but why bother ..."
"overall- the taste and smell is very similar to amber bock. kinda dissapointing. overall just an average, but refreshing and easy drinking, beer."
"The pour is a dark, opaque brownish-reddish with a tan head that starts out small, but lasts until the end of the glass. Roasted malts dominate the mild aroma. The roasted malt flavor has a sweetness to it while earthy hops give this beer a crisp finish. The taste is almost medium bodied, however somebody forgot to tell this to the slightly watery mouthfeel. This beer didn't wow me, but I enjoyed it much more then I thought I would."
"Very crisp and lagericious. I would say that this beer reminds me of a mix between a schwarz and a vienna lager. It was good and drinkable, and it washed the rather exotic food down quite well. Recommended for the apparantly few amount of BA's that have access to it, but don't expect anything particularly mind blowing."
"Note: I like most of my beers on the 'warmer side', but this one really needs a good chilling to go down smooth. Drink straight out of the fridge."
"D- This was definitely a diamond in the .99 cent bin at the liquor store. I'm not really sure it fits into the Euro Dark Lager style cause I don't really drink enough of them to know. It has good balance and is very nice to quaft. I think I will have to try some other brews from Alhambra if I can find them. Is it possible that its a Moorish brewery, I didn't think so."
