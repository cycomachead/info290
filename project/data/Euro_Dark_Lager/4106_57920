There are aspects of this beer which are very much doppelbock in style (aroma especially, sometimes the taste) which perhaps makes this an even more appealing beer in he end. Tasty, aromatic, and yet one 500 mL is enough. I guess this beer is nicely sating as well. So while I tried it I'm not seeing a desire to go out and get more.","damndirtyape","Jul 29, 2012"

2.94,-22.2,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"Pours a curious, translucent muddy caramel color (similar to Maudite) with a frothy tan head that dissipates in fairly short order. The aroma is mild and clean, with a malt sweetness akin to maple syrup. The syrupy sweetness manifests much more in the taste, which is almost bock-like. Not a whole lot of complexity here in spite of the saaz hops touted by the label. To me, the body is too light to support the malty backbone, which perplexes the palate and makes the beer taste watered down in spite of the pronounced sweetness. There is some consolation in the fact that the finish is cleaner than one would expect, but on the whole I feel this brew misses the mark, being short on identity and lacking in complexity.","MaximalC","Jun 28, 2012"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Out of a bottle this beer was a dark brown color with some garnet highlights that appeared when held up to sunlight. The head was a thin layer of tan foam that retained fairly well and left sliding bands of lacing. The aroma was of chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, bread and toasted malt. The flavors were just plain delicious and I was impressed. I tasted lots of chocolate, caramel and some honey followed by some earthy malt and toasted malt. I also tasted some dark fruits as it warmed up. The finish was clean and crisp aided by just enough Czech (Saaz?) hops. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation perfect. This, in short, was the best authentic Euro Dark Lager I’ve ever had and I can now see what this brewery has been doing for over a 1,000 (!) years.","thekevlarkid","Feb 05, 2012"

Fine speckled lacing surrounds the sides of my glass. Aroma has hints of dark fruit a touch of raisin even some plum with a toasted dark malt breadiness coming together as well. A slight herbal hop finish comes through almost like a tea leaf earthiness in the background. Very nice clean chocolate malt presence with low roasted malt bitterness levels, mild herbal earthy hops very crisp with more fruit adding to the complexity of the malt character utilized here. Mouthfeel is creamy medium bodied nice dark lager, textbook perfect dark beer that comes off super drinkable. This is almost like the old recipe Penn Dark used to use before all their problems started, awesome beer so easy to consume it's simply pleasure in a glass.","WVbeergeek","Oct 04, 2011"
4.27,13,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall (4): Although the Czech's think dark beers are for women, Zatec Dark is great for this man. The malty aromas compliment the coffee and biscuit flavour leaving a nice complexity not found in many lagers. A great dark brew (since 1004!)","tonyf55","Sep 30, 2011"
3.35,-11.4,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a 1.5"" beige head. Body is dark as coffee. There is almost no smell, not even as it warmed. Taste is milder and less interesting than I'd anticipated.

A little sweet in the aftertaste and almost no hops evident to me.","MoreThanWine","Sep 03, 2011"
3.76,-0.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Flavorful with notes of lightly charred toast, raisin, prune, and molasses. Light bodied, fairly easily drinkable. Dry finish, not especially sweet, but there are hints of sweetness there. Carbonation is fine, lending to a more creamy body, but it's still a bit thin, showing it's lager roots, not particularly a bad thing. This is surprisingly good in fact. Somewhere between a Baltic Porter and Munich Dunkel.","emerge077","Jul 16, 2011"

4.05,7.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The beer exits the bottle with a dark brown color and caramel highlights. A solid cap of creamy foam patiently waits overhead and then clings to glass as the level decreases. The nose puts forth a dark grain, bready sweetness and something reminiscent of prunes. Smooth as it goes down. Sweet dark malt greet the palate along with rich dark fruity notes. A metallic tinge through the center is a prelude to a dash of hops. The palate is left with the sense that it something hefty, but it quickly springs back to life willing and eager for another round--even on a hot day.","BeardedBoffin","Jul 06, 2011"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pretty good beer. Poured with a decent sized, foamy, frothy, thick, creamy, light tan head and a little lace. Color is a clear dark brown amber. Aroma is malt, roast, fresh baked dark bread, toffee. Flavor is similar to nose with a little sweetness that's nicely countered with the yeast, dark malt, and carbonic acid. Body is good, smooth and full yet cut again by carbonic acid. Finish is like flavor, has good length, and is clean. Session beer.","drpimento","Jul 03, 2011"

3.8,0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Zatec Dark Lager pours an almost solid black, with *faint* cherry highlights showing under the proper lighting. The foam that crowns this beer is khaki colored and comes to two, maybe two and a half fingers in height. Retention is solid, and there's a faint bit of lacing left behind. The nose is an nice blend of slightly roasted nuttiness and sweet caramel/toffee. The flavor features a role reversal as caramel is what immediately jumps out, with nutty notes falling more in the background. Despite the jet black color, there's little in the way of darker, roasted grain flavors beyond just a touch of chocolate. All that is interrupted by a subtle, but definitely present bite of bitterness from the noble hops. That transitions to a floral, slightly herbal finish. The body is firmly middle of the road, about what one would expect from a lager of this size. The carbonation though is lacking, and leaves the beer feeling a bit dull. Zatec is a bit outside of my wheelhouse, and is probably a beer I wouldn't have picked up on my own, but I'm glad I got to try it as it's a fairly solid offering.","axeman9182","Apr 14, 2011"
