4.11,7.6,4,4.25,4,4,4.25," This dark lager /bock whichever has a nice flavor of malt which does seem roasty with some fruity raisin and mild herbal hops adding to the woodiness and cocoa flavors from the chocolate malt and crystal type malts I am guessing. The yeast has a subtle berry aspect which adds to the creamy sweet flavor of the malt which works well with the lager smoothness. The flavor is roast -ier as it warms bringing an almost burnt marshmallow type caramel flavor in the finish. Overall I am a fan of this style and this is one of the better examples - bock as Full sail calls it. I like the enhanced roast as it adds to the complexity of some of the caramel malts utilized.","Slatetank","Dec 15, 2013"

Aroma of dark toasted malt and cocoa, hints of coffee. Flavor of toasted and biscuit malt, cocoa, light coffee, dark dried fruit and toffee notes. Good medium body with some creaminess, pleasant. The flavor here is fairly rich and porter-like, in a blind taste, I'd probably identify this as a baltic porter. Flavor is full and interesting and a quite nice mouth feel.

I do like the feel a lot. with a slightly fuller body and a dusty almost chalky palate, still with nice carbonation. the dark malt is awesome, simple and clean, which is just right. what I do not like is its semi-gimmicky mix of flavors, its filling qualities, and its odd mix of bitter and sweet. its good, not great. at 7% abv I don't need more than one, but I am glad I tried it. when full sail first hit the scene, it was magic. since then, even in this ltd series, its been lackluster.","StonedTrippin","Nov 07, 2013"

The very light burnt flavor from the black malt might be the only issue with this beer, and it is light. The booze does feel a little stronger than it should due to the soft lager feel, but I like it if I think of this as a baltic porter it's right where it should be I think.","jlindros","Mar 10, 2013"

3.93,2.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"T: Gotta say, I wasn't a huge fan of the other LTD beers, but this one is pretty solid. Some chocolate upfront with a hint of roasted malt. A touch of dark roasted coffee and burnt malt on the finish. Pretty nice and smooth. Definitely worth a try.","notchucknorris","Nov 19, 2012"
4.05,6,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"I have to score this one high since this Euro Dark category is such a catch-all of a lot of really mediocre stuff. From the bottle in the six-pack, bought at Mayfair Liquor in Denver.","mactrail","Nov 18, 2012"
4.03,5.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The flavor becomes more enjoyable as it warms. Initially I was put off by the harsh roasty notes but they start to mellow out as this brew sits longer. The carbonation is spot-on and in spite of the slightly stale coffee flavor that comes across I found this overall to be much more pleasing and enjoyable than I had initially expected. For the price I’d have another.","elNopalero","Nov 18, 2012"

4.1,7.3,4,4,4,5,4,"12 oz single from ""Lifesource"" in Salem. $1.49 Pours a gorgeous dark brown with a huge rocky,yet thick and lasting tan head. Aroma is mostly dark chocolate ,hazelnuts and cream fudge. A little alcohol shows at first sniff then is gone. Creamy,toffee,chocolate taste..very smooth then a slight bitter ater tatse, very nice. Good on the palate..the beer gives the impression of heaviness but it fairly flows over the tongue. Overall an excellent beer best of the LTD series.","Reidrover","Nov 10, 2012"

3.83,0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt and some slight cocoa and coffee aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 08, 2012"
4.05,6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O: Impressive lager...I've heard it described as a Czech Dark and now a Doppelbock...whatever the case, this is pretty good for a lager, and (just like the 6-pack holder states) there are nice notes of chocolate and coffee throughout. My kind of beer.","Scotchboy","Nov 07, 2012"

Flavor is more of the same, very dark malts. This is a good lager, not sure what style it would be because I'm pretty much a novice at drinking lager beers. I would definitely buy another one of these for $5, that was a fucking steal.","ArrogantB","Oct 27, 2012"
