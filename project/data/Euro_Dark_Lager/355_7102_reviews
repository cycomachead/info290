"Altogether I can see this as being a nice, easy-drinker in the summer heat, as it's not too strong and is rather refreshing in its own right.  It's not bad for the price I paid for it ($6.99), but I'm sure it would be a better beer within code!"
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  I've had this before and I remember it with more fondness then, but it was the summer and I had it with a spicy meal, which is where I think this beer would shine better.  It doesn't quite work well in the winter with a simple stir fry.  Still, I rather enjoyed it and I wouldn't mind another, but I need to find the right food to pair it with."
""
"Overall an easy drinking somewhat sweet beer that would pair well with spicy Asian or Mexican food. Tasty beer. No bottling date found."
"I like this beer and will look forward to my next drink."

"Good value, and pairs well with food, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"A pretty standard, toasty, malty dark lager. Flavorful enough, nothing wrong with it. As mentioned above, the kind of beer that feels right to drink on a warm evening."

"Pours a solid dark brown with clear ruby highlights at the edges and a huge creamy off white head that takes forever to dissipate. Aromas of molasses overwhelm me as soon as I get beer to meet glass. Hints of smoke, roast, and chocolate round out the aroma, but my God this smells like sugary unfermented molasses mostly. Wow the flavor does not stray from the aroma much. Sweet brown sugar and molasses run the show here. Light prunes and plums in the flavor as well and little to counter the malty or adjuct-y sweetness in this beer. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet thick sugary syrupy mouthfeel. I have no way to tell how old this bottle is but I suspect it may be less than fresh. That said the burnt sugar and molasses seem to be all this beer offers, it reminds me more of the barley malt sodas that I had in the Caribbean than actual beer."

"This is one of those beers that just never gets talked about--no hype, just an all-around good brew. It is way outside of the box, as most beers in this realm, light or dark, are dry and usually lacking any real complex characteristics. It is the same thinking of the sweeter Stouts consumed in hotter climates. For something completely different, give it a go."

"It is drinkable, not unpleasant, but nothing special on a global scale."

"First had this years ago when it was known as Creveca Negra. Enjoyable beer."
""
""
"I dug this a lot. Not what I expected it to be. A nice rich, flavorful beer."
"Great toasted malt character, fairly nutty, with just enough roast to not overwhelm. Some off flavors, but not am offensive beer."

"I got a bottle of this (under the cerveza negra alias) as a part of a mix and match 6 pack. I included it on a whim, as a generally enjoy dark lagers and had never heard of this beer. I was very pleasantly surprised. Even drinking it straight from the bottle, the roasted malts and caramel tones were very evident. It was an extremely smooth lager witha great mouthfeel. Thick, but not porter thick, it was exactly what a dark lager should feel like. This may become my new go to session beer."
"Pleasantly surprised...I would pick this over Negra Modelo all day long."

"O: enjoyable and better than expected. At least average even by European standards."
""
"From your options in the P.I. if you are unable to get the Golden eagle, this is your best bet. Each of them are ok though. There are far worse options in the world and especially in the Philippines."
""
"A very nice dark beer with some bold, delicious presence. Rich and satisfying."
"It poured a nice thick tan head that dissipated into a nice ring around the edges. Smelled like roasted and caramel malt, period! Tasted like roasted and caramel malt. High carbonation, full-bodied. A little sour tastiing at first, but the aftertaste was sweet and wet. An average dark lager that is good to drink during the winter. Not my favorite beer overall."
""
""
"Overall - This is the first dark lager I've ever tried. It's ok.. It's like a brown ale with just heavier flavors."
""
"not a bad brew really, especially for this part of the world. it pours quite dark from the bottle, chocolate syrup looking, with a one inch mocha colored head with surprisingly good retention. the nose is real malty, german in origin, like an extract though, a little bit off and not totally fresh, but some cocoa powder aroma wakes it up a bit. the flavor doesnt carry as much chocolate as the nose, but it is yummy all the same. a little bitterness turns metallic in the finish, my main critique. plenty drinkable, fuller bodied but well carbonated. fairly priced and down easy, not so nice when it warms up, but if you drink it quickly, this is a pretty good euro style dark lager."
""
""
"wow what a great beer always wanted to try it they have new bottles a now im sorry i wanted so long a dark pour which makes your mouth water a taste that goes smooths a tasty bit of malts and carmel that will make a enjoy night for anybody only 5.0 so drink drink drink"
""
"O: This beer seems to taste like a sweeter and fruitier version of a schwartzbier. It’s not a bad choice if you are looking for something that’s dark but still extremely drinkable."
"Pours a dark brown, substantial tan head that dissipates quickly. Very smooth extremely malty, roasty sweetness with a unique buttery note. As a huge fan of dark beers and in particular schwarzbiers/dark lagers I would have to rate this beer as one of the best. More flavorful than Kostritzer, very sessionable, pairs well with mexican and spicy asian food and is never harsh or bitter. Perfectly balanced."

"Not as dark as most Euro Darks but pretty malty and definitely not watery.  There is a sweetness to this that is interesting but not entirely pleasant."
"I enjoyed it, much to my surprise."
""
""
"A little more caramel then I like in a beer, as I do prefer the beers that have more hops presence."
"Overall - strange beer with lots of caramel overpowering all other flavoros."
"O: Goes down pretty easy, somewhat tasty, not too filling, mild kick, ok representation of style. If the sweetness didn't hold in the aftertaste so much, this would be a much more enjoyable beer."
"Tolerable. More so than their ""pils"" and light lager."
""
"From the 355 ml. bottle. It pours dark brown with reddish highlights when held to the light. A decent enough head that lingers and settles into a ring. The aroma is of dark, sweet roasted malts, yeast, and sugar. The hops are more in the background. While the body is nice and smooth it does not have a lot of texture to it. I would put it at light to medium. The taste is overly sweet and malty with moderate bitterness and a clean finish. It brings me back to my early days of beer drinking when I would drink Heineken Dark, Michelob Dark, or Beck's Dark."
""
""
"Conclusion: Without doubt this is the best Euro Dark Lager I have tasted. It far exceeded my expectations, and is surprisingly smooth and balanced. The flavors are not as excellent as one might expect from a small established craft brewery, but they are outstanding for a large macro-type brewing operation."

"The beer appears a deep, dark brown hue with beige cap that fades rapidly, leaving random traces of lacing on the glass. The aroma offers a heavy dose of brown bread, pumpernickel, malt, fruit. Smells good. The flavor is ok. I like the aroma better. A bit sweet, slightly dry in the finish. A solid example of the style. Folks seem to rate lagers a bit low, in my opinion. While this beer is not stellar, it's a nice example of the style, offering balance and complexity in both the aroma and flavor. I would have this again."
"Pours a dark, chestnut brown color w/ a thin cocoa head. Average lacing on my snifter glass. Very dark. Nose is toffee, dark fruit, and roasted malt. Taste is actually not that bad- toffee, malt, dark fruit and slight hops. Maybe some coffee in the background. Feel is medium, a little flat, w/ a toffee/coffee aftertaste. Probably the weakest point of this beer. Overall, this isn't bad at all- especially for the style. Cheers."

"M: The sensation is pretty good, there is a balanced flavor and aroma, it is pleasant and last medium to long for a nice bittersweet ending more sweet than bitter."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark reddish brown with a lasting tan head. Aroma and taste is sweet dark lightly toasted malts, barley and grains with some light hops. Palate is medium body with light carbonation. Finish is sweet dark malts, some very light fruitiness and light hops. Flavor is lacking and becomes bland, carbonation turns flat and ends overly sweet. Overall not my favorite and would not buy again."
"D - An all around solid brew. It boasts an interesting flavor profile without trying to do too much. Didn't expect much coming in, but this beer certainly exceeded expectations."
"overall: this is fun to drink because my dad has plenty of stories involving being too young, too far from home, and having this beer be far too accessible during a scary time long ago...(not that now isn't scary as well, but that's another topic for another website)."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark amber-brown with a 2 inch tan head that settles to a small cap. Nice foamy rings of lace mark the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, caramel, and malted milk. Taste is of roasty dark malt, malted milk powder, with a caramel/toffee finish. There is a nice roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium body and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good dark lager and my first beer from the Philippines. I would definitely get this one again in the future."
"This isn't a bad brew. The flavors are nice."
"Very tasty beer - great surprise."
"Darker than expected the pour is deep brown with a nice topping of foam and lace. Raw barley husk, cocoa powder, and a sourdough tang form the main flavor components with grape skin and sulfur in the back. Clean and fairly full for the style, better than the usual lagers imported from tropical locales. Nice for the style, but I'm sure it's main appeal in the States is the stubby ""fancy import"" bottle."
"T: a light body, not a very nice flavour is so flat, just a little roast, no end at all"
"Overall Very typical asian dark lager. Not all that easy to drink, its a bit to sweet for me"
"A decent enough dark lager, given its predisposition, the drawbacks ever so slight. Drinkable, yet hardly recommendable when compared to more headier Euro and otherwise, competition, as it kind of lags on the palate after a while - don't actually ask me what that means."
"RJT"
"Overall: I could drink something like this all day. Great taste. Less filling. A good surprise from the Philippines. Well done."
"O - I would buy again, overall nice thick lager with great malty flavor."
"This beer is pretty nice, to be honest. It has nice complexity and good heft. A solid pickup overall."
"This brew gives off the appearance of a Nut Brown Ale, It's darker in color but still transluscent enough to see through it. It's got a roasted aroma to it but it's not strong. The flavor also plays the same role. It's more full flavored than most beers from this area but still doesn't compare to a stout. It's got more of a lager taste than a roasted flavor to it."
"Drinkability: It's light yet flavorful body makes for a great drinkability but there is always something better out there. Still a good brew. "
"Drinkability: a richly tasty and ever-so-drinkable beer. It reminds me of the flavors of a mild ale, except with a fruity lager kick. I can really dig it; San Miguel Dark has caused me to raise my opinion of the whole Philippine archipelago."
"decent drinkability. decent, but unspectactular."
"Fairly smooth with light effervescence at tip of tongue. Medium body (leans towards light). Malt/caramel/vanilla aftertaste lingers and tapers off nicely. Very good brew, I highly recommend it."
"San Miguel was my favorite import for as long as I can remember, long before I became a BA. This is very much as I remember it and it is much better than any BMC or the most ubiquitous import swill."
"B+"
"D- in my opinion a little too sweet to drink more than one in a session."
"The beer pours a hazy medium to dark brown color with a white head. For an aroma I get earthy hops, dark malt, caramel, toffee and bread. The flavor is very malty with some toffee and bready malts as well as some earthy hops to keep the beer somewhat balanced. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel."
"looked promising but never really wowed me in any area, don't go looking for this but drink it before the water if your ever in Manila"
"I'm very impressed with this beer. It's given me hope that there is actually good Asian beer out there."
"Appears deep cola in color. Tan head goes to skim and ring. Smell is rich dark malt, hops, caramel. Taste is caramel, dark malt, some lite hops bite. A touch of black licorice. Dry slightly bitter aftertaste. Mouithfeel is active carbonation - a touch harsh in my opinion. Light/medium body not especially smooth but OK. I drank this years ago before BA and enjoyed it. Now - it's just a decent dark euro lager...how things have changed int he beer world."
"Overall,Sessionable, drinkable if a bit underpowered"
"Pours a dark ruby-brown that wants to be cloudily opaque, but doesn't quite get there. The frothy tan head starts out as a thick mass, but dissipates fairly quickly, leaving almost no lacing behind. The nose holds notes of dark malts, dark coffee, and toasted wheat. The taste basically follows, with the harsher aspects of coffee pushed to the fore, along with a kind of overly smoked influence. All told, it's as though the smell was peat smoked and soured, but in a bad way, leading to a partly objectionable flavor. The body is lightly moderate, with a moderate carbonation and a thick but slippery feel. Overall, this is almost a pretty good brew, but the flavor misses the mark, leading to a feeling of ""if only...""; nonetheless, it spitefully maintains a decently high level of drinkability (...just not as high as it could be)."
"The major downfall of this beer is that the taste is only fair, not great, but at least it is inoffensive. In other areas, San Mig dark rates fairly high for its style."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is sweet, malts and molasses. Taste is good, mostly of chocolate malts, a degree of sweetness. Feels creamy in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Pours a pretty dark reddish color body, with a huge tan colored head, lasting. Very strong malty aroma, some nuttiness, and lots of earthiness. Some funkiness too, like ripe bananas. Somewhat watery mouthfeel, somewhat creamy too. Malty earthy aftertaste. Some bananas in the taste. Some roasted notes. Not too shabby. Carbonated, but not harsh. A little sweet after a while."
"Drinkability: Not so bad, really, and a nice surprise after the poor showing of their unwelcome flagship lager."
"D - It's drinkable, but I'd probably switch to something else after one or two."
"A dark cola color pour with a thick foamy , lasting light brown head. Aroma is braedy , malty , with some cinnamon and caramel notes . Flavor is sweet like molasses , with caramel ,plums and some spice , light hop flavor . Crisp clean mouthfeel , medium body , high carbonation . A light earthy hop flavor in the finish ,Quite sessionable . Not too bad."
"D - I could see heart burn happening after a few of these, but nonetheless, it goes down good but probably isn't the beer you would want to chug and finish the night off with."
"Flavor, unfortunately, is very muted compared to the scent. Still a heck of a beer that if I had to classify would be a Schwarzbier. Nice roasty malt character with a hint of ale fruitiness. I actually like this beer quite a bit and would be more than happy to kick it in the Philippines with this tasty lager."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, not overpowering."
"Drinkablity - I think I would have another."
" ~ This is an interesting brew. I really appreciate the look and aroma offered but find the flavors to be sub par. I think this brew to be at best average concerning the overall drinkability. However, I must admit this beer does get better as is goes down."
"Overall, I would not purchase this beer again. There is too much to be desired. However, it is easy to drink I would say simply because it is so light."
"Tastes of light malts, a bit creamy, and with an unexpected lingering finish. Offers good carbonation and a decent feel and drink. Fairly decent with a light malt structure one would expect from the latitude of origin, yet far from the hot weather styles typical thereof."
"A very robust, sweet quaff, but I'm not so sure that I'd call it a Euro dark lager. Perhaps an Asian dark lager."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The beer is dark burnt amber with red hues. The head is caramel and quickly diminishes to a very light lace. The nose is very sweet, and you get the malts and spiciness in the background. The taste is ok, sweet malt forward, a little out of balance due to the sweetness. This is an ok session beer, probably would not purchase it, but would drink many if they were free and the company was good."
"A nice dark lager. Would certainly revisit this beer."
"Bottle thanks to mmm///beer. Pours a dark black color which is reddish when held up to a light source. A small white head. A pleasant nutty and fruity aroma, some malt too. The flavor is quite nice; tons of dark fruits; plums and prune, but also something quite sweet, berries perhaps. A toasted malt and a bit of light milk chocolates. I like this beer, it is full of flavor and well made."
"D - This reminds me of Newcastle. Like that omnipresent brew, there is nothing wrong with some watery nutty flavors and easy drinkability. Boring, but unoffensive. Sort of a wallflower really."
"D: A good drink overall, sweet and very smooth to consume. A six pack wouldn't go to waste and you can easily drink 3 or 4 no problem despite its sweet nature."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew was a very dark, almost black color with a minimal tan head leaving light lacing. The smell was slightly sweet with some caramel and fig notes. The taste was of raisin and roasted malts. This brew has an alcohol finish that is unusual. Not the best flavor brew. Nothing I was really looking for in a session. Not very impressed."
"This beer poured a brownish almost black color, but when I held my glass up to the light it showed a dark amber color and looked thin. The head was 3/4 inch thick with a brown color which dissapeared after a few minutes. Beer smelled of sweet roasted grains with hints of caramel and toffee w/ a slight pungent smell that creeps through. As the beer warms up, I could smell some raisens. The beer has a sweet malt taste of butterscotch, caramel. There is bitterness present w/ a slight burnt aftertaste. SMD is a light to medium body beer and the carbonation is good. I would like to try this beer with some filipino food , like adobo or kare kare. Good beer overall."
"The taste is very smooth, with a great sweet-bitter balance, light tartness, and a lot going on. It is constantly interesting, tantalizing, yet pleasant, with toasted grain, licorice, chocolate, fruit, whisky, and leaves. Despite a full flavour and palate, it is light in body with a very lively, engaging palate."
"Drinkablity: During all the time I have spent in the Philippines, I have never seen this brew there. I will be on the lookout for it next time though. It would be a tasty alternative to San Miguel's other brews."
"Surprisingly good. Honestly, I hadn't expected much in the way of flavor due to the style. I really enjoyed the combination of smokey dark grain and sweet dark fruit. Flavor is unified, and has enough depth of character to be interesting. I would definitely get this again."
"During a brewery tour I was told they had produced an all malt product in the past. It was discontinued due to cost - malted barley is imported mostly from Australia. When the average beer here sells for about $0.50 USD, you can see where it would be hard to make an all malt beer that would have to sell at twice the price."
"Given g=how disappointing San Miguel lager was, I was pleasntly surprised by this. Efes dark is a better valuie where I live so not sure when I'll be paying Saint Micheal another visit"
"some roasting aromas ... looks like hour old coca cola ... some decent flavours in this dark lager, but a quite thin, i guess the hotter weather is made for this one ... smooth but needs more cowbell!.. there are many better dark lagers out there but who really cares..."
"d- very smooth I could drink a bunch of these, i am sure it taste better in the country that it is made in."
"Wasn't expecting much for a beer labeled 'dark lager,' but hey, what do I know? Beer was dark with a bit of tan head. Taste was roasty maltiness, that wasn't too bad. Mouth feel was even better. I had two of these the other night at a harvest celebration. A good beer that is very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A good sweet beer, not what I was expecting in a very good way."
"Drinkability: Tasty and drinkable, good for the style."
"Drinkability: Flavorful, but a bit too sweet."
"I will be searching for this one again. I would love to see this on tap."
"D: A good beer, a nice surprise. Drinkable, and at 5% the type of beer I would gladly have a couple of. Definitely worth trying."
"A very drinkable beer, I love the way this feels in the mouth, so smooth."
"Mouth feel is light and refreshing and I think would be a good pairning with Mexican food or Thai-pour me another"
"Light mouthfeel,some creamyness and a grainy texture. Goes down very smooth. A good refreshing taste could session this one. Reminded me of Samuel Smith,if you like those beers you'll like this one."
"Although it's classified as a Euro Dark Lager, it's very similar to a Schwarzbier. It's very drinkable, however I found that the aftertaste is a little bit of a dissapointment. It doesn't ruin the beer, but I feel it shouldn't be there. It's definately worth a try, especially if it's fresh."
"A purply dark pour, some light peeks through at at the edges and a small white head with high carbonation. The smell arrives shortly after the bottle is opened, a little coffee and light malt. The taste is similar but is thinner than expected considering the strength of the aroma. The body is simply too light. This one is oh so close to being a nice sessionable alternative to American lagers. Drinkable, but the subpar mouthfeel and overall bubbliness detract."
"Pours a very dark mahogany color with a tall bubbly tan head that quickly fades into a thin lace. Nose is sweet roasted malts and, as another reviewer mentioned, saltwater taffy. Taste is sweet malt along with some molasses and dark buttery toffee. Mildly bitter hops are present towards the end. The carbonation level seems a bit high. Fairly unremarkable overall except for the odd, if somewhat interesting, taffy-like aroma."
"Pours a dark ruby amber color with an average head. Smell is an average malty flavor and maybe some coffee tones. Taste is a mess without any direction to it. Just a lot of roasted malt flavors. Yes it's dark. Yes it's a lager. I just wish there were more here. No hoppiness to speak of either. Mouthfeel is watery and thin. The aftertaste is acidic and annoying. Not much body to it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they were stuck on an island in the Philippeans"
"Notes: It was just alright to me. Average would sum it up."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Trouble-free and uncomplicated but far from boring, a social beer that has an acceptable profile for lovers of Dark Lagers. A reasonable effort which doesnt disappoint. Above average!"
"Overall, a good example of the style. A solid lager with deep, dark flavors. A good year-round choice."
"Thanks for the Phillipine beer Darren."
"San Miguel Dark Lager comes in a twelve ounce stubby (I like the retro look, although I'm not sure they've ever changed their bottle). It pours a dark brown color, as advertised, with a tan head. I've got to say, the aroma is much more interesting than I had anticipated, it consists primarily of sweet malt. Nice, sweet malty flavor, hops aren't a player in this beer. Frankly, much better than I anticpated, definitely worth a try."
"Pours deep burgudy with mahogany highlights and good clarity. Soapy, dark tan head shows poor lacing and no lacing whatsoever. Roasted barley with a hint of coffee in the nose, background crystal malt and very faint fruitiness. The taste is crystal sweet with a good roasted bitterness and a faint raisin flavor. Semi-dry aftertaste with very low english hop profile. The roasted character takes care of the bitterness and the flavor is well-balanced. The Smooth, light body has medium carbonation and finishes mellow with a hint of licorice. Quaffable with a pleasent sweet/roasted flavor."
"The color is a dark brown with a ruby glow. Aroma is of dark sweet malts with a distinct aroma of fresh, dark bread. Taste is more of the sweet dark malt with an element of breadiness. Middle of the sip becomes more bittersweet and is reminiscent of toffee or molasses. The only disappointment here is a weak, abrupt finish. Wow, this is surprisingly very good, with plenty of flavor and enough complexity. This gives most euro dark lagers a run for their money, I did not expect this good of a beer from a macro brewery from the Philippines."
"Pours a dark mahogany with a finger or so of off-white head. Nose is a quirky mix of molasses, caramel, and bready malt. Taste is rather...unique as well - gobs of molasses and caramel, bready malt, lactose, with a hint of dark fruit and a metallic finish. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. Hard to get a hold on this one. Sweet, milky, bready, metallic, cloying. I can't imagine drinking too many of these in the humid tropics in the Philippines. There's a lot going on but it doesn't quite mesh. One and done for me, not that I could easily get ahold of more"
"Bottom line: This dark lager falls a little short in flavour but it's worth a try."
"Overall, avoid."
"Pours a deep brown into my Carlsberg imperial pint glass. A bit of bubly making its way to the surface to help form a slight ring around the beer foam. Smells very bland, but promising of roasted malts to be enjoyed. Flavor profile was a little roasted and rye bredy, but for the most part, very country kitchen. Pretty refreshing though. Something I could drink all night at a bar if the price is right. Plus the second beer I've ever had from the Phillipines and the first one I've reviewed."
"Sweet malty/cola-like aroma. Dark brown color with a thumb thick, bubbly, tan head. Fairly decent looking brew. Lots of raisin in the fore. Quite sweet. Some stewed prunes, caramel, dates and some mild roasty notes. I think they were obvioulst going for a Schwarzbier here and that is mostly what it tastes like. I think it should be classified as such rather than as a Dark larger. Its a pretty tasty brew if you are into Schwarzbiers, which I am."
"Reminescent of an Irish Red and a weaker German Bock. A solid lager with toasted, bready, yeasty, malty, and moderatly grainy characteristics in the nose and flavor. Appears clear and mohogany / ruby / brown. Quickly fading head and little protein. Finsihes a bit sugary and, again, grain like. Better than most south-of-the-boarder beers, but still not my favorite."
"the mouthfeel was very watery when i first poured it, but as it warmed up it became more substantial."
"The pour is dark brown with red hues and a frothy tan head that fades into memory. The nose is roasty, with sweet toffee and caramel malts. The taste is right along those lines. Burnt malt, molasses, toffee, caramel, a dash of chocolate and a lactose-like sweetness with a mild, tangy hop finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but highly carbonated. I won't be rushing out to buy more of this, but I won't pass it up it if I should ever see it at a party."
"I used to drink this stuff a lot during the '80's when I was in the military, because they seemed to always have great prices and a good supply at the on-post/on-base liquor stores. I'd first tried the lighter version, and enjoyed it. Both have a bit of a slightly sweet taste, not in my interest-zone any longer, but it was very enjoyable. I was a bit shocked when I was in Spain recently, to see so many San Miguel signs, but I then discovered that Spain has its own San Miguel-- I'm not sure if they're connected or totally unrelated. This is a good overall dark beer, fine with meals and steak cookouts etc."
"Pours a black, but when held near light it has a dark red hue. It has a foamy head and is existent until the end. I sense some sweet malty and scotch aromas. Scotch is apparent in the taste a and maybe a little bourbon too. Goes down quite smooth even though it is quite carbonated. Has a slightly bitter aftertaste. This happens to be a tasty full-bodied brew and enjoyed this better than the regular San Miguel."
"Very nice flavor with a little bit of a carmel taste and hints of coffee. Its also not bitter in the least. All in all, one of my favorite beers to drink both at home and at the pubs."
"Mouthfeel is medium, lighter than a stout but not quite as light as typical schwartzbiers. Finishes clean, very robust, holds my interest. I could session this."
"Deep tan head settles over clear brownish-red liquid, very dark in appearance. Nose is heavy on earthy and sweet maltiness, hint of light smokiness, some hints of light chocolate. Decent mouthfeel, taste is heavy on sweetness...almost too much there, some more chocolate notes, barely any hoppiness to report. Finishes quite malty and sweet, that's about it. Not nearly as good as I remember it being years ago when I last drank it."
"Overall a good, non-thinking lager for the summertime paired with some picnic/bbq. Appearance is awesome, same with the mouthfeel. Everything else is just average."
"Drinkability: Much better than what I was expecting; I could see drinking a few of these with a pizza"
"Hey now, pretty nice find (on Beergeek). Solid dark lager, pour was dark brown with a smallish tan head, minimal lacing. Nice malt and light chocolate aroma, and in the taste  which also was tangy, slightly sweet. Typical dark lager, low in hops, high in malts  good deal. Thin to medium bodied and carbed  a good dark brew for long haul drinking (5%)."
"Small, tan, flat, still head. Some popping bubbles. Clear, dark brown beer with red highlights. The nose is sugary sweet, malty with burnt caramel and molasses. Burnt sugar/caramel up front. A fullish, milky middle bursting with molasses. A tangy, sourish finish. More caramel and molasses, a little bitter. Not bad. Fairly flavorful."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a 1/4"" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts with a creamy, yet slightly dry lager yeast aroma. It is sweet with caramel malts. The taste is decent. It has a very sweet crystal malt flavor that is a little bland and dry on the finish. It has a nice roasted quality to it. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a decent dark lager. It has good aroma and decent flavor. It's not the best I've had, but I would drink it again if it was in the fridge."
"Overall Impression: This one started strong and faded. Its not offensive and shows glimmers of greatness, but it just cant go the distance. For a lager its rather interesting and enjoyable. Im not driven to a session, but Im not against another either. Im waffling like a Belgian on this one. Not bad, not great, worth a try, dont kill yourself looking."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown,, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Overall the aroma is worth the go around, but the taste just did not hit the spot...and thats the most important part."
"edit: so after reviewing i noticed it was euro dark lager, not the style i expected perhaps this is more to its style then i let on. i beleive this is the first of this style i have ahd so perhaps it is my lack of knowledge not the beers lack of personality. still say skip it."
"tastes moderately sweet and raisin. no bready, malty backbone to this one. the mouthfeel is much thicker than i expected. really, it's a thick beer! but don't expect a stout -- there's no roasted malt/coffee/chocolate flavors here. the flavor just kind of drops off a cliff."
"This beer pours out dark brown with some ruby highlights. Has a nice light brown head. There is a strong malty aroma with serious molasses overtones and a coffee background. The flavor is very sweet at first but disappears quickly with a hint of coffee bitterness on the finish Has a very watery mouthfeel."
"I shuddered when I picked this bottle up the name brought back bad memories from when I was in viet nam in 68, san miguel is one of the few beers that we could get and most of the time had to drink in warm, it was one of the worst beers over there and it was not dark lager.so I thought I would give this 1 a go. poured dark amber, with a light tan head. aroma malty, caramel, brown sugar, metallic, cherry coke. flavor, weak could hardly pull anything out faint hints of chocolate, Toffee, and some cherry, but had to let it stay in my mouth for a while. watery it wasnt as bad as I thought it was going to be"
"San Miguel Dark Lager is a much better beer than is San Miguel Premium Lager. It's better than decent solo and would probably go well with a wide variety of foods. Now if I could only find a Filipino restaurant in Des Moines."
"Pours with a two-finger light brown head that leaves some lace. Deep, clear amber color. Light bodied and medium carbonation. Malty and slightly metallic nose. Starts malty, finishes with some roasted coffee but not much; still it is much better than say, Becks Dark. $1.94 for a 12oz. bottle from Olivers Beverage Albany, NY."
"Glowing brown color with a burgundy highlight that comes through when held up to the light. Small tan head floats above. The beer gives off sour dark notes. Leathery and almost rubbery. Rawhide? Actually reminds me of a pencil eraser. The taste is light and semi malty. Some caramel notes are evident. Light, almost watery body. Overall, this is a smooth, easy to drink lager that has an interesting and satisfying roasted character about it. Not much depth to it, but enjoyable."
"This beer poured very dark and with barely any head to speak of. Nose was somewhat abrasive sweet caramel malts. Taste matched the smell, sweet with caramel. It reminded me of some sort of weak version of Coke. Faint hop dryness. Creamy in the mouth and low carbonation I think helped this beer to be a little bit drinkable for me."
"Poured from that 330 ml brown uber-stubbie bottle, no freshness date to be found. A quick fizzle of head that disappears almost sooner than it appeared, it almost looks like I poured a glass of Dr. Pepper. Mahogany-toned body, it gets that cherry red cola appearance when held up to the light. Right off the start I pick up dried date and fig aromas on the nose, while a sort of sweet malty molasses shows up after that, and then notes of black current as well. Curious. I'm not sure if the flavour has decided upon where it wants to stand, I have the dried fruit, toasted malt and molasses kind of thrown at me all at once. However it's not a very strong throw, it falls a bit short due to the watery mouthfeel which also affects the strength of the flavour as well, which is rather weak. No sir, I'm not impressed with this at all. However, to end on a positive note, how about 3 cheers for uber-stubbies!"
"Not a bad beer."
"Notes: The smell pumps you up and the taste brings you back down. It's not bad and it has it's strong points but lacks in the most important which is taste. Just a little too watery and thin. Mabuhay!"
"This was a real surprising beer from San Miguel. After the experiences drinking San Miguels (not the dark lager) in the P.I. back in the day, I wasn't too sure I'd be getting anything very good with this one. This is one easy-drinking brew and worth picking up if you see it on the shelf."
"Tasty drinkable brew, almost could be a bock beer."
"The beer disembogues the bottle a deep sanguineous color, the head Bunyanesque in size and a light brown color, the texture is frothy and the lace a thick and clinging sheet. Nose is sweet malt, molasses like, fresh crisp and clean to the senses, start is lightly sweet, nicely malted, top a bit thin. Finish is mild in its acidity, the hops mild and pleasing to the palate, aftertaste very dry and long-lasting, drinkable, but a much better beer on July 4, 1962 when I pulled my first liberty in Subic Bay, Philippines and sampled my first foreign beer, geez that more than 40 years ago, time sure flies when youre having fun."
"Begins with a creamy but receding beige head with an average amount of lace. The aroma is a surprisingly interesting mixture of roasted coffee, chocolate or mollasses and even a hint of raisins. There is a sourness and bitterness to this beer. Initally, it has a stout-like flavour and there is a suggestion of soapiness. You can taste the alcohol in the finish. On the palate, San Miguel Dark is softly carbonated, dry and a bit thin. Not a bad brew."
"Notes: Middling dark lager."
"This is a nice beer from the Philippines, I must say. Perhaps a bit one dimensional due to the malt being the focal point, but it is quite easy to drink, and I can imagine having this with some dark poultry, like duck for instance. It isn't a grounbreaking beer in anyway, but is a good old easy to drink dark lager."
"poured a dark brownish color, sweet malt aroma on the first sniff, first taste was surprisingly great . I was hit by a blast of sweet chocolate roastedness, which leveled out as the glass went down but I savored it to the end.Tasty refreshing all a beer should be. It reminded me of Xingu, but I thought this was better"
"Dark brown color, large head. Aroma is roasted malts/ Dark roasted malts, slightly sweet. Hops are subdued. Mild taste and flavor. Well balanced, but a little thin tasting. Not a bad beer, but nothing special. Better than I expected. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Drinkability  This goes great with cotton candy, giant swirly lollipops, and pier fries."
"A clear, very deep mahogany body rests beneath a creamy head of light tan foam that slowly receeds to a solid collar and leaves some very nice transient lace. The nose offers a sweetish toffee malt that's clean and welcoming. It's smooth and creamy across the palate with a medium body and delicate, somewhat restrained carbonation. The flavor delivers a mild fruity note and a dollop of gentle, sweet buttery caramel that's just enough to keep it interesting. The underlying bitterness balances very nicely in the mouth, and emerges a bit in a short-lived finish that expresses some light nuttiness. A well-brewed beer with some interesting character. Very nice!"
"This is a very nice Dunkel from the Phillipines. It pours a very dark amber with some retention in the cream colored head. A small level of lace was observed through most of the glass. A very nice nose gives a bit of floral and caramel malt sense and the flavor is sweet, but not over the top as with many heavy Dunkels. There apears to be only a moderate ABV for this beer, though none is listed. Overall, this is a nicely drinkable Dunkel at moderate price levels."
"Taste: I'm not that familiar with dark lagers. I really felt like this tasted like an unfinished beer, if that makes any sense. There is a slightly hoppy taste to it, but I'm left, considering the dark color, expecting a richness that just wasn't there."
"Rings rather hollow, like a can of Dr. Pepper left out overnight."
"Well I heard good things about this one but I didnt think to highly of it.Not as dark as I thought it would be almost a chesnut brown color,did have a nice head wich stayed for awhile.Smell was spicey,and malty.The flavor was a little dry for me I was hoping it would be a little sweeter,real light texture wich made kind easy to drink but didnt feel great in the mouth.Nothing to write home about but okay."
"Clear dark brown with a nice big and cottony head.  Very caramel aroma, malty to be sure.  Nice chocolate and toffee early flavor, minimal hops, but the early flavor is taken to the close by a medium-bodied mouthfeel.  Slight sense of papery notes, but not pronounced.  Not a huge impression but unexpectedly good, tasty, and drinkable.  One of the best darker Lagers I've had from an equatorial country."
"i don't know about this one, it looks a hell of a lot better than the regular San Miguel, but in the end, there was nothing happening, very thin body, watery texture, quite sweet, and very bland."
"Cerveza Negra is the taste of a robust spirit.  Full of flavor with caramel tones that tease the palate.  when poured, it is rich and creamy.  A surprising favorite of mine from the philippines."
