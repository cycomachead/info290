3.25,-22.1,4,4,2.75,3.5,3,"My first beer from Moonlight on tap at Toronado SF.  I was eager to try this having had Coffee and Cigarettes at Cellarmakers about a mile or so from Toronado.  The look and smell were good but honestly I was not enjoying the taste.  A strong charred, burnt taste that was overpowering the rest of the beer.  Maybe the fact I had C&C earlier that day distorted my rating (I realize that one is a porter and the othe a Euro dark lager) but I wound up leaving some of this beer in the glass which I rarely do unless a beer is completely missing it for me.  I know othe BA's like this lager and maybe on another day I would have liked it more.  I can't recommend this beer.","ELS","Apr 01, 2015"

Typically don't care much for black beers but this one is miraculously, almost paradoxically light -- no gut-busting thickness or crazy high-ABV undertow beneath the flavor, which is impressively complex: slightly charred, pleasant notes of coffee and chocolate... very fresh-tasting, too, which is the upside of it being brewed only a few miles away.","JonahNW","Oct 31, 2014"

I'm astonished on how a dark lager could ever taste this bready, thick, and intense, and yet still retain a low gravity. Definitely not a bad offering during the colder months, however - and I always gladly revisit this whenever I'm in the mood.

It has the agreeable drinkability of your standard dark lager or schwarzbier, but the depth of a great Baltic porter. There were fruity, cherry tones at times, and then dry toffee and cocoa with an interesting cola edge.

Nose is fair cocoa, a tad splash of coffee, roasty malt towards to end. Taste is sweet chocolate, much like the nose forecasts, but a good amount of coffee comes forth. Mouth feel is good, good carb for the 'light' nature of the brew. Drinkability is excellent, goes down easy and is not heavy on the tongue (like a guinness...but more body).

The flavor is a perfectly balanced mix of hop bitterness and light toastiness with a crisp mouthfeel and good medium body. Its refreshing, tasty, and clean.

A small finger of head falls to a very spotty coat over top. The dark quality leaves me unsure about the clarity, and there is no detectable carbonation working up to the surface. The aroma is nice, with a solid chocolate and roast malt character, with a very solid pine backbone that really acts as an arbitrator between the chocolate and roast. I like it. The flavor hits with a strong roast to ashen character that moves to the nice solid chocolate sweetness, finishing with a strong but not offensive pine hop, that has a strong bitterness associated with it. The finish leaves me with hints of mintyness, but I know this is not a flavor from anything, but from the sum of the parts. It is interesting and I like how it comes across. Mouthfeel is on the lighter end of moderate, with a carbonation that is of the same quality. I am very impressed with the magnitude of the flavor and aroma of this brew. It really hits hard and sticks with me. I'm not sure the hop is right for a traditional schwarzbier, but I like how it plays with the other flavors, and the minty aftertaste really draws me back.

A kiss of wood smoke adds a pleasant touch. Light medium body with an ideal medium carbonation. Taste has a lasting smokiness, almost like a rauchbier. Dark chocolate maltiness is dominant, balanced by an interesting hops bitterness that wavers between earthiness and citrus.

4.55,9.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Drinkability and Notes  Great drinkability, has all of the wonderful flavors of a great American stout without the filling, ultra-heavy body. I will rate this beer ignoring that it is a Schwarzbier, because while this is really not really to style, I like it more than any Schwarzbier that I have ever had.","OldSock","Jul 27, 2005"
3.65,-12.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I must admit I didn't like this beer as much as I wanted to. Black as any stout on the market, a thin tan head topped it and lacing was minimal. Slight roasted aroma was followed by a very roasted taste profile with moderate bitterness. A very sticky aftertaste was a bit unappealing for me, very spritzy mouthfeel and I opted for another beer when I had a second pint. Possibly this one could grow on me but inital meeting was take it or leave it.","Mark","Jun 23, 2005"

4.63,11,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"On-Tap @ Le Toronado. Strong coffee coloured with a nice tan head of foam that lasts and leaves excellent lacing as well. The aromas are crazy for a lager. Coffee, chocolate, big German malts, and nice spicy hops in the background as well. The taste was magnificent. Malty as all hell with a great roastiness up front. Totally lager-like and German up front but it really gets ale-like in complexity, and almost porter/stout like in the middle palate and finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the carbonation levels are plush. Drinkability is insane. It's like crack. Great stuff.","francisweizen","May 03, 2005"

4.03,-3.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Nice bubbly head, lasting on an intense dark color body. The smell shows a strong coffee character, dry coffee beans on one side, and coffee and cream or ice cream on the other. The taste is definitely coffee, notes of toffee and praline. Quite sparkling. Biscuity in the mouthfeel, with some refreshing notes of lemon and a hint of grassy hoppiness that dries the mouth a little bit. Mouthfeel is light and fesh, roasted and almost smoked. Wooden and creamy. Quite drinkable.","tjd25","Feb 21, 2005"
4.59,10.1,5,3.5,5,4.5,5,"The taste is just as you would smell it. It's loaded with coffee and licorce flavors, slightly chocolate. For all of this, it's still a pretty light beer. It's feel is full bodied, but still light enough to be described as feeling like a lighter lager. It's very refreshing and very easy to drink. There's no bitterness that is often associated with dark beers. This would be a great beer for those who have never really drank darker styles but would like to. It's very easy to drink... lot's of it!","Furball","Sep 09, 2004"
3.33,-20.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Tap, Toronado, San Francisco. A pretty unique dark lager. Mashy/oaty, quite ashy and salty, pretty big hit of hops and bitterness. Pretty tasty, but a little unbalanced. Quite smooth and grainy to , pretty interesting stuff, didn't think it was a dunkel when i was trying it though.","rastaman","Sep 02, 2004"
4.33,3.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This was one of my favorite beers when playing pool with my buds. It is only available on tap in the SF Bay area but if you see it, go for it. If you like porters and stouts try this, it is similar but a little different.","Bang34","Mar 10, 2004"
4.16,-0.2,5,4,4,5,4,"Dark black color, with a dark purple tint that rather pretty. Medium head. Aroma is roasted malts and coffee. A medium bodied Schwarthbeir. Malts are roasted, coffee and chocolate. Hops are slightly bitter. Very smooth. Lots of flavor. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Oct 10, 2003"
