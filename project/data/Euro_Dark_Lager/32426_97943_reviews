"To clarify, when I say 'sweet' I mean it tastes like someone added a few packets of Equal at bottling; not a desireable attribute in beer."

"Not too bad, really. Decent aroma, body, & appearance. Flavor reminds me a bit of a soft drink and carbonation is a tad aggressive. Finish is like flavor, yet not too bad. You could do a lot worse. This might be the best beer out of this brewery. I could see having another of these."
"Overall this is a decent beer with potential but not without flaws. The carbonation is a bit over-the-top and the sweetness could be toned down. A bit better balancing would definitely make this one a winner."

"O: Ok. I wish the hop presence was a little more notable. There is only just enough to keep it from being cloyingly sweet. The malt character is similar to a bock."

"Overall, a very enjoyable beer that I'd easily drink more of."

"Not real sure what to make of this one, try it if you love molasses I guess. Will be interested to see what they do with the taproom down the road."
"Yet another random new Wisconsin brewery coming into the area. This offering is a dark lager brewed with Cascade, Centennial, and Hallertauer hops. Alright (spoken in a fake Australian accent). It pours a dark garnet-brown topped by a finger or so of ashen foam. The nose comprises walnuts, mild coffee, dark greens, and a kiss of toasted rye bread. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a distinct vein of strong, dark molasses that clashes with the milder notes surrounding it. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a decent dark lager, but that weird molasses-y bit hinders things flavor-wise, and the overly-high carbonation and a watery body don't help matters either. Beyond those issues, though, it's pretty good..."
