To be fair, it's not *terrible* - from an objective standpoint, I'd probably consider it one of Brick's more tolerable beers. That being said, it's completely uninspiring, and I wouldn't be surprised if a few of the 5 remaining bottles are still hanging around in my fridge a month from now. At least it was cheap. If you're looking for something of the same quality as your average macro lager with a sweeter, slightly roasty flavour, this isn't the worst option, but there are certainly better ones (e.g. Upper Canada Dark, which costs less and tastes better anyway).","thehyperduck","Jul 28, 2011"

The taste is a very mild roasted malt flavor with some sweetness and no real hopping stands out. For the style I was expecting some body and backbone but this brew has neither.

2.69,-10.9,2.5,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Overall for a dark beer this fairly bland, a good introduction to the novice but not worth seeking out if your used to more complex darks. Its a hybrid. Worth a try,","drinkininthewood","Oct 30, 2007"
3.35,10.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,"Even with the lack of carbonation, it still was not an unpleasant experience, this beer isn't that bad.","funkengruven","Aug 21, 2007"
3.69,22.2,2.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Mouthfeel is still average - I don't think Brick has ever been able to get their carbonation levels perfect, but I can't complain, as this isn't quite as bad as others for that. It certainly lacks the ultra-effervescent of macro beers. Drinkability, however, also remains high. The light-ish body make this a beer that's virtually designed for mass consumption. And yet it's just barely erudite enough to be appreciated by a beer nerd. It may just be nostalgia, but Waterloo Dark will probably always get my recommendation.","headlessparrot","Aug 17, 2007"
2.88,-4.6,3,2.5,3,3,3,"I tried this beer on July 11, 2007 at Jack Astor's Restaurant (Front/York) in Toronto. The beer poured a dark reddish-brown into the glass with little head, and constant effervescence. What head there was...was gone in the blink of an eye. The aroma was weak with malt. The mouthfeel was thick and full-bodied. The taste was bland for a dark beer, some malt flavour, but not much else.","cyrenaica","Jul 11, 2007"
3.51,16.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall this beer is quite mild and easy to drink. Looking at it Id expect more punch from it. Easy beer to introduce macrobrew drinker to.","Wintermute","May 14, 2007"
2.85,-5.6,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Overall, its ok. I'll probably drink it again, but I won't go hunt it down.","BrewSomerville","May 05, 2007"
2.83,-6.3,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Final Statement: If offered, drink up. It's not that bad of brew. I certainly will never buy more than a single of this, if ever. Another mediocre beer I've had from Brick.","MMansfield","Jan 17, 2007"
2.51,-16.9,3,2,2,3.5,3.5,"Poured out a dark but clear color, like coca cola, but without a head. The nose smelled of old dust, a musty room, seltzer. The taste had maybe, at best, some mild malt notes to it. The mouthfeel was crisp, clean. A very drinkable beer, but why would you?","dherling","Jan 10, 2007"
2.75,-8.9,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Quite thin bodied for its style. Not very refreshing either. Checks out ok in some categories, but lacks just as much in the others. Flavours are in check, but this beer just doesnt have any features that impress. Weak malt bill, no dimension of roast or depth. Aroma almost non-existent. A good effort, but not something that will ever stand out.","biegaman","Oct 30, 2006"
3.45,14.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This transition seems to have given Waterloo dark some dunkel characteristics as the hops have been slightly attenuated and the malts beefed up...a pleasant change.","pootz","Oct 25, 2006"
4.36,44.4,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: This is by far my favorite from Brick. This will allow the non dark beer drinkers to sample a dark beer, but still please the dark beer lovers alike.","ThirdCoast","Oct 20, 2006"

2.26,-25.2,3,2,2,2,3,"Well, this was a big let down. Found this at a local specialty store where they bring in products you can't get anywhere else. It's not terrible, but not really good either. If the roasted malt at the start continued through to the finish, and if the mouthfeel was sturdier, then it would be decent.","Noxious26","Aug 11, 2006"
2.63,-12.9,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Dark, sourish, true to its style but certainly not the best example of it. Quaffable but weak mouthfeel. Modest taste some chocolate malt.Spot of coffee and nuts, the latter like a brown. Even a hint of licorice. Reasonable carbonation. Malty but not cloying sweet.","Sammy","Jul 17, 2006"
3.73,23.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"all of this is completely appropriate for a dark eurolager, but it doesn't fit with the munich dunkel style. this is on the path to schwartzbier as far as smoothness and chocolate goes, and if I get a chance to do the brewery tour, I'll certainly mention this.","tfinn","May 14, 2006"
2.11,-30.1,3,2,2,2.5,2,"The taste also leaves you dry and lacking, lacking for something else.","Shiloh","Jan 28, 2006"
2.88,-4.6,3,2.5,2.5,3,4,"D: Taste is quite bland and unoffensive, so it's easy to drink. Perhaps it'll win a few customers from the macro's?","Derek","Oct 10, 2005"
2.83,-6.3,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a rich dark brown/red, big off white head and some lace. Smell is sweet malt, some roastiness and faint hops. The taste is not very present, a little malt and roast but pretty bland. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, medium carbonation and an easy drinker.","Viggo","Jun 25, 2005"
3.13,3.6,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Another brand that Brick has put in stubbies. The beer pours a a dark brown / mahogony color with a short tan colored head. Too bad the foam is gone in less than a minute. A little bit of sweet malt smell, but not much else. I was expecting a full flavored, full bodied brew, but wasn't there. There is some malt flavor, and I found it quite sweet. Overall it is quite thin and watery, yet still very smooth. That fact does make it easy to drink, especially is people are a bit tentative because of the dark color. Still a bit pricey for a slightly above average lager beer.","BigBry","Jun 11, 2005"
3.68,21.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability: Surprisingly good. Overall, there's nothing outstanding about this brew, but having it on-tap is much more pleasant than my experience with the bottled version. I'm glad that a friend basically bullied me into trying it again.","DrJay","Jan 30, 2005"
3.55,17.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"I was expecting to be very disappointed by this beer, as it was given to me by a friend who really didn't like it. After trying it though, I wouldn't mind having it again.","elricorico","Dec 01, 2004"
1.77,-41.4,4,2,1.5,2.5,1,"tried this dark lager on a return trip to jack's in niagra falls. the first time i was there it was kicked so, i waltzed across the street from my motel on the next day to see if the had aquired another. they had. i was exited to try this dark lager that iwas told to be good. it pours a nice opaque black with a mohogany head that looked delicious. that was the last good thing i have to say. this was one foul swill. it had to be a bad keg or dirty lines. it totally ruined this brew. the smell was a rancid vinigar. the taste was dominated by a strong vinigar, creamy grossness although i couls talse some decent malts in the very far back. mouthfeel was almost impossible to register due to the overwhelming vinigar flavor. i choked down 3/4 of this pint and told the bar maid it was bad. she had almost no reaction. probobly because she was really busy. so i left.","ramrod666","Aug 26, 2004"

2.06,-31.8,3,2,2,2,2,"I can't say I could recommend this to anyone else at all, not in good conscience at least, it is very mediocre and not worth your hard earned money (especially what I paid for it here in Alberta). I do like the stubbie bottles though.","IronDjinn","Jun 11, 2004"

3.13,3.6,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"As the last reviewer noted, I'm not sure this is a dark ale - seemed much more like a dark lager. I checked the brewery's website, and they did not identify which branch of the beer family tree this is from. A pleasant dark beer, whatever it is. Mild roasted malt with a touch of grainy sweetness. Firm bittering at the finish. Quite mild, overall.","Brent","Jan 01, 2003"
1.57,-48,3.5,1.5,1.5,2,1,"Amazing beer. I find it quite fascinating that someone has managed to brew a beer as dark as this with zero flavor. The appearance of this beer is indeed a little suspicious. Wait, I think I tasted something...a twinge of some kind of bitterness, burnt toast maybe. Strange brew...kill what's inside of you...","John","Aug 06, 2002"
