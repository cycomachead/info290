"This beer was not bad"
"It pours a clear deep mahogany brown body beneath creamy head of light tan that holds well and leaves some very nice lacing. The nose it gently caramelish (mainly dark caramel), nutty, and lightly toasty. The flavor adds some more golden caramel to it, a hint of light fruitiness, and a touch of dusty chocolate as well, backed by some leafy and herbal hops. It's got a very firm bitterness to it and it finishes dry with a bit of crushed granite, some bakers chocolate, and more leafy hops."

"Taste is a roasted sweetness balanced by a decent hop finish.  Not overly crisp and clean but pretty tasty."

"Solid overall dark lager, which is a style uncommon to expect from an American craft brewer."

"O: This is a very drinkable beer with a couple slight rough edges, but nothing that would prevent me from drinking many more. Quite enjoyable. Corn sweetness and bitterness level makes this very enjoyable."

"A decent enough dark lager, with more than a few Munich Dunkel notes to recommend it by. Perhaps a tad plain, but that's a positive aspect in this realm, where off-flavours and unwelcome phenols tend to lurk. Worthy of a round or two over dark wooden tables."

"A well done dark lager. Easy drinking, but still quite flavorful."

"Not too bad, but nothing extraordinary about this one."

"A strong roast bitterness but not necessarily a deep roast malt feel with a light yeast character. Just doesn't blend together all that well for me with the flavor switching from yeast to roast to a metallic off flavor (very small but comes out nonetheless)."
"Overall, I was expecting more from a stellar brewery. This beer is certainly drinkable, sessionable, but lacking a real knockout punch of flavor."
"A big thanks to the legendary woodychandler for this beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a cola color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very mild, some light roasted malts are detected. Taste is also kind of light, some roasted malts, a touch of smoke, really not a whole lot going on. Feels medium/full in the mouth and overall is pretty much a mediocre beer."

"O: This is a nice dark lager. It's a bit surprising to see this coming from California, but Anderson Valley did a good job of capturing a well-rounded, drinkable version of a somewhat unpopular style."

"Overall meh, not the best schwarzbier, lager seemed a little too warm, some metallic notes, decent dark malts, overall just not the best put together beer."
""
"O: Ive probably had about 50 of these, Im writing this review as I drink my last one. This is a great beer. I could see myself returning to this over and over again, its perfectly balanced and makes for an awesome everyday beer. I really cant recommend this enough."
"Overall an enjoyable beer with some great flavor."
""
"O: Again - not exactly what I was hoping for... an interesting (head scratcher) beer, especially from AVBC. Good - perhaps better as dark summer beer, but definitely not great."
""
"What CAN you do when a beer foams through the opening right after the Crack? NOT an inverted Glug, I assure you! I allowed things to settle in until two fingers of dense, deep-tan head had formed, evincing good retention. I had poured it into my Anderson Valley CAN glass, which is pretty darn cool. Color was a deep, dark brown (SRM = > 34, < 44) with NE-quality clarity and ruby highlights. Nose had notes of milk chocolate and a light smokiness. Mouthfeel was medium and the the taste was very chocolaty, more sweet than I might have preferred, but not bad. Beautiful lacing began to appear as I drank from the glass. Finish was silky smooth and I was halfway through it before it even registered how quickly that I was drinking. Good stuff and worth a shot if this is your style of beer. For me, I'm going back to an IPA."

"Light body but full feeling in the mouth. Prickly and brisk carbonation but the beer holds up to it. Typical of something akin to a negro modelo but definitely more roast character a bit more complexity and body. Lightly roasted malt up front, dry grains along the mid palate and balancing faint hop bitterness, roast character lingers, subtle notes of coffee and toffee. Pairing oddly really well with garlic pesto right now, brings out the more sublte flavors. Pretty good."
""
""
"Overall a good beer. Not something I will likely buy again though. The beer just doesn't wow me."
""
"O: Not amazing but easy to drink and pairs very well with some lamb sausages off the grill. There is a little more subtly to the flavor and aroma of this beer but I can appreciate it."

"16oz can. Deep clear amber with a rocky off-white head. This retains with a smooth froth that rings the sides of the glass with sticky lace. The aroma is a nice mix of sweet and roasty (maybe even smoky) with a tinge of green citrus and floral accents on the edges. The taste has a crisp green hop bite, surrounded by a combination of malt sweetness and lingering roast. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a tight creaminess to the carbonation, yet this remains very smooth. This was decent. It could have used a bit more of a push from the malts but itâ€™s still pretty drinkable."
"16oz can poured into chilled glass. The color is a medium brown with a foamy beige head. The aroma has a nice malt smell to it. The texture is ok with a heavy malt taste. I didn't know what to expect from this beer but the taste was pretty unique. Not really a fan of the overall flavor but I'm sure others would like it."
""
"Not a bad brew from a brewery I'm not very fond of. If only there were some actual Mexican beers as drinkable as this. From the 16 oz can purchased at Bine & Vine in San Diego."

"Many craft beer folk will NOT appreciate this beer, since its flavor is so subdued, subtle, and simple--very unlike most American style hoppy ales. Still, this is a classic, spartan, super high quality beer--to be appreciated by those with cultivated tastes."

"O:Pretty drinkable and fairly flavorful. No where near as good as Death and Taxes, but it's tough to beat Moonlight. Cheers!"
"El Steinber, for what it's worth, is a spot-on American craft version of a Euro Dark Lager that's not in a green bottle. It nails the taste of the Euro imports I've had, from the nice maltiness, right down to a slight metallic aftertaste. It'd be better if they lost that characteristic aftertaste, but it's still a good beer that's highly drinkable."
""
""
"The body was smooth and easy, as is typical for the style. Drinkability was good, 16oz can was gone quickly, and I see myself grabbing more in the future. Overall, a pretty good beer, not quite up with the best examples of the style, but certainly worth a shot if you see it."

"pours a really nice clear brown with a deep redness. thick head with a good bit of nice lacing. smell has a slight caramel to it, with a little maltiness. taste is all malt with a little hoppiness. comes across pretty light for such a dark brew. over all this is a pretty solid beer. i definitely wouldnt be opposed to trying more beers from anderson valley."
"Overall - This beer's got some nice things going for it, in fact it might be the best Euro dark lager style beer I've come across. This is a beer, in can form, I'd bring with me to the river. That said, it's not a style that really grabs me. I'd rather go with a nice ESB, even without that crisp lager edge."
"O: Considering that the Euro Dark Lager isn't exactly the greatest or most complex style, El Steinber is a pretty good version of it. Oddly drinkable."
"Overall this is quite a fail on Anderson valley, I expected a dark lager with chocolate tones and sweet malts and got a dry bitter lager. Skip it if you can."

"Pours a clear dark copper with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, char, and slight nutty aromas. Taste is much the same with toast and slight metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with a metallic flavor that lingers in the mouth and is quite unpleasant."
"Overall: this beer really doesn't grab me. The lingering aftertaste and the relatively strong corn aroma are not pluses in my book. However, there is some pleasure to be had drinking this beer; it could just be cleaner."
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of the style, it had some nice roasty flavors with some crisp and clean lager flavors, it fulfilled my craving for this style. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, crisp, clean, and the flavors did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these on a cool summer night, I think it's fairly sessionable. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel, they were pretty good and the taste was pretty nice also, it's pretty much what I want from the style. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty bland and it didn't get me too excited to drink this beer, I think the aroma could use a little work. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a Black Lager, it's got just about everything that I look for in the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style and it might make a for good introduction to dark beers. All in all i was pretty happy with this beer, it really hit the spot on this warm spring night and I know I will be drinking a few more of these this summer, good job guys this is one solid beer."

"Interesting overall beer. Definitely sessionable. In fact, if I could find a sixer of this, I would take it to the next poker night or NHL playoff watch party. As a standalone, not going to blow you away. An interesting choice for Anderson Valley, but at the same time, you can see why they did it."

"Overall: Works fairly well as a easy-going, easy-drinking dark lager."
"This beer left a ridiculous amount of lacing on the glass. It was like a sheet. Unfortunately, the taste didn't stack up to the apparent thickness of the beer. I realize that adjuncts were used in it to make it a bit lighter, but I don't think that did the beer any real favors. It was easy to drink, no doubt, but it wasn't particularly enjoyable. In some regards it tasted like an improved formula for Dos Equis. I don't regret trying it, but AV is way better than this."
"Medium body and mostly firm feel, though a bit thinner than the best lagers. The beer has a nice, clean toffee-like malty flavor up front and a slight spicy note at mid-palate that carries through to the finish. Unfortunately, the beer lacks the malty ``chewiness'' one finds in the best examples. Still, a nice easy-drinking, sessionable lager in the European tradition that accompanies just about any meal."
"O: The thin and watery nature of this beer makes it taste somewhat like a Mexican Munich Dunkel Lager."
""
"o - Overall a pretty average beer. Not much going on except some roasted malts; probably wouldn't seek it out again."
