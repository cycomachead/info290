"Overall - Not sure how I feel about it. Sometimes I like the flavors, sometimes they seem off. As I click Review, I like it. That could change by the end of the glass."

"Had at tasting. vintage was 06 or 07 one of about 850. first appearance was great, it pour thicker than 10w50 moter oil dark as a cave 50 ft under the earth with a finger width tan to cream white head. aroma is certainly overloads of black licorice, hints of cookie dough and vanilla. taste see above with a short alcohol burn for the back of your throat very cream and full the whole way through. My advice is split it if ya have it it does have a level of sweetness and licorice to it that would make it hard to finish more than half a bomber. Overall a homerun especially in tasting eviroment"

"I have to admit I put two strikes against this one since it was a licorice beer. However, interestingly enough, there seems to be a nice minty tone to this from the licorice. And thankfully the licorice doesn't overpower things at all. What you get is a nice, evenly robust lager with a nice little flavor ride. Odd as it seems for me to say, this may end up being one of my favorite Shorts brews."

"O: I'm pleasantly surprised. I've been very critical of Shorts to date. Of the beers that I've had from them to this point, I've felt they've been forced, gimmicky, or too busy and discordant. This beer has done a lot to restore my faith in them. It is delicious and perfectly balanced. Great idea, even better execution."
"O: It's a decent beer, but the funky end is really off putting. I have had so many bad experiences with Short's beers that I will never trade for any of their stuff again. I guess I'm just gonna have to make it out to their brew pub someday."
"Taste-Liquid peppermint patty, chocolate, mint leaves, roasted coffee, vanilla bean. Exceptional flavor and character. Every sip has a different flavor nuance. An excellent, flavorfull brew. Seek it out if you can. Highly recommended."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottling date. Pours hazy very dark brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense tan head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, mint leaves, licorice, vanilla, molasses, roasted malt, biscuit, dark fruit, and a bit of bourbon. Nice and very interesting aromas as I would have expected. Taste of big chocolate, roasted malt, light coffee, licorice, bourbon, vanilla, biscuit, mint leaves, dark fruit, and some herbal spiciness. Some light licorice tartness on the finish; with some lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, mint, and licorice on the finish for a bit. Finish is fairly dry. Very nice overall balance of flavors, with no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink at 8%. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming on the finish. Overall this is a surprisingly nice and interesting black lager; that is very drinkable and balanced."

"D - Very drinkable. Really big an bold flavors, but they come together really nicely and taste balanced. I really like the vanilla been and anise combination."
"Bourbon, corn and then I was getting mostly the mint here, the concoction tasted off, yes lactose. Lager secondary, black coloured body. Some chalky taste, a little roasted malt. Whole thing does not carry together. Rather ordinary though drinkable.Stephen’s bottle from a previous batch.Tried again with Steve's bottle, and much better. Soft bodied, licorice and mint, better drinkable.."
"O: Definitely very drinkable and delicious. A nice surprise"
""
"M/O - Bitter up front, a bit hot - maybe this is partially due to the vanilla bean, but overall drinks smoothly. I'll bet this beer is really something when fresh, and while odd, this was not bad at all, even at a ripe old age of 3."
""
"Interesting offering as always from the folks at Short's. Certainly not your typical ""Euro Dark Lager"" but I like what they've done here. Flavors working well with one another."
""
"O: Wow, this has to be one of the worst beers I've had the misfortune of trying as of recent. Unbearably heavy on the anise, with virtually no redeeming quality that I can think of. It's as if someone took a subpar dark beer and thought they might spice it up a bit by adding mouthwash to it. It simply doesn't work on so many levels."

"A beguiling brew, and I'd expect nothing less from Short's. I'm a big fan of both licorice and the combination of chocolate and mint and I found this very interesting, though likely not a beer I'll seek out again."
""
""

""

"Another interesting idea comes up short. Too watery and the yeast strain doesn't play nice with the initial licorice flavor."
"Thanks a ton Dan for the opportunity to try this, hope to try more Short's too."
"O: Just a really weird, funky, flavor and aroma to this. Not very good."
"O: Goes down ok, not very tasty, well hidden kick, interesting represntation of style. I wanted to like this beer, but it just didn't do it for me. It was a licorice beer, it was licorice with beer...and it was a bit much."
"This beer doesn't work for me. My big caveat, though, is that I don't like licorice, and I don't like the way it combines with beer. Adding sharpness and bitterness on top of something that's already bitter and sharp doesn't help. Adding black licorice to a rich, sweet stout might work, but here it just accentuates the qualities I don't like: the acrid and thin bitter flavors."
"My experience with this beer pretty much mirrored the one that I had with it on draft last year. The nose really delivering the promised flavors (and it seemed even a bit more here in the bottle) but the flavor, while still good, just didn’t bring it as hard. This is still a really tasty and unique offering from Short’s though and I’d definitely recommend checking it out if given the chance."
"Very unique brew, glad I got to try it. Not really a fan of licorice though.."
"A really cool beer to be able to try. This lager aged quite well, I'd say. The anise is strong, but probably at the highest level it can be without ruining the beer."
"I had assumed the flavor would be overwhelmingly of black licorice, but happily it's nicely integrated into the 'dark lager' experience. Dark, gummy fruit notes make an appearance, too, suggesting fig and sweet prunes. Slightly hoppy, herbal finish with a kiss of mint sharpness. Mouthfeel is medium-thin in consistency with a creamy carbonation and smooth body. Another absurd, yet well-crafted beer from Short's. Is there any flavor they can't capture in a pint?"
"Hmm a very odd beer yet good Something weird happening on the finish, like a balloon swelling on the tongue? Very minty and full of bitter anise. Light vanilla on the finish and again the mint girl scout cookies. Some almost bourbon notes but more like a canadian whiskey. Milk chocolate, dark bready malts, and more. A oddly interesting brew."
"Lighter body, with a good feel from the carbonation. Some alcohol is felt, but still hidden well. This is the most complex dark lager I have had. Certainly unique, with many layers. Well done, and this is from someone who doesn't like black licorice much."
"O: This is a very well done experimental beer, with a taste of anise that is very well balanced with all the other elements, it does not become over powering. Very interesting brew."
"O- a complex brew, but it just wasn't doing it for me, not quite to my taste but seemed to be well crafted, we'll call it average."
"O - Not a bad beer, the anise and licorice aren't so overpowring as to wreck the beer like often seems to happen here. Good effort by shorts."
"Poured into a snifter, this is a nice dark brown lager. A couple fingers worth of a tan head. The smell is very strong on the mint, but i also get hints of the vanilla and anise - maybe even some chocolate. It is a really interesting smelling beer. The taste is a little heavier on the anise and vanilla. Then it finishes with a nice mint and chocolate. It is a little thinner than I'd like, but it isn't a style I drink very often. Overall it is a very interesting brew from shorts. I'd drink it again if it was offered, maybe even pick another up if I see one at one of the shops I go to. As someone who isn't too fond of licorice flavor, I was surprised with how subdued Shorts made the anise flavor. It is just in the background with the vanilla, adding complexities and making this a really good beer."
"Bottle: This beer pours a dark brown with very little transparency and small beige head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the edges of the glass. The aroma consists of moderate doses of licorice with light coffee, vanilla, and hints of mint. The flavor starts with a quick dose of black licorice and is slightly bitter and dry. The finish has moderate dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and a touch of vanilla. It leaves behind a minty chocolate aftertaste. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation."
"Fuller medium body, slightly higher carbonation, attempts to be creamy but some prickly feel as well. Another off beat and interesting beer from Short's, although it feels like there's something off here."
"After having the horrific experience of having the PB & J Ale by Short's I was kind of turned off by the company. But I am so glad that I tried this. This is one of the best beers I've had in a long time. I didn't find the anise flavour to be very strong. To me it tasted more like mint chocolate chip ice cream. a beautifully crafted beer."
"I went into this knowing that this beer would not be my cup of tea, so I kept an opened mind when reviewing. It is tasty and flavorful...no denying that...but I think the mint keeps it from tasting like the namesake..."
"6/3/2011"
"(12oz bottle courtesy of rayl101! Pours black with a nice fluffy khaki head. When held up to the light, you can see its actually dark brown with some ruby hue. Active carbonation, but the bubbles are very small. Wow! Aroma is very powerful. Anise, chocolate and mint are prominent . I’m having trouble detecting the vanilla initially. There is a mint chocolate chip ice cream (which happens to be my favorite) thing going on with the aroma. Taste is sweet with a nice mix of anise and chocolate mint again. There is some bitterness, but its mostly roasty rather than hoppy. Medium bodied with a slick texture. Finish is smooth and seems like it cleanses the palate as anise and chocolate mint tend to do. This is a pretty unique beer and one that I enjoyed. If you don’t like anise or chocolate mint, then you will have a tough time with this."
"Another interesting beer from Short's who always seems to stray from the beaten path."
"Overall, while the quality of the brew is evident, it just didn't sit well on my palate. The mint and anise, while a nice combination in theory, end up working against one another here. Again, others may find this better than I do."
"M/O. mouthfeel is a nice medium body that has a slight dry feel to it and is very relaxing and enjoyable to drink after a nice meal."
"O - Very good beer. I would definitely like to have it again. Considering I love chocolate mint foods, etc., this beer was a very good drink for me."
"Overall: Solid beer and I would certainly love to have this again. I doubt I would want more than a 12 oz bottle to myself in one sitting but certainly an enjoyable beer and a great way to be introduced to this creative and innovative brewery."
"D - I am intrigued by this one. The flavors all take their turn and meld nicely. I can't say its something I would drink often, but it was nice to try. 3.5"
"The body is black with a creamy tan topper. Head dissipates quick and leaves little lace. Shorts has created an interesting beer once again! Nose is of mint, anise, and vanilla. The taste follows with more mint and chocolate. Tasty if you like mint. Medium body and low/medium carbonation. Very smooth and extremely drinkable. Everyone must try this beer- not everyone will like this beer."
"Beer is mildly sweet with a nice moderate finish. The anise is the star of the flavor and it does have this medicinal quality to it but I don't hate it. I like it more than other anise beers I've had and I'd even have it again."
"O- This beer was interesting to me as to be honest I didn't think I would like it. The flavors were very well blended and no one flavor outshined the others. ABV is a little high but it never really shows itself while drinking this beer. Overall another great beer from Short's!"
"O - an interesting beer from Short's, as usual. Probably not something I would buy again, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Massive thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one with funkydelic and I at an impromptu tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller sampler wine glass. Poured a deep dark brown with a minimal slightly tan off-white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, smoke, and licorice. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, and licorice. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. Nothing on this one really made me want to drink a whole lot of it. It was very interesting that they were able to tie the licorice into this beer very effectively, but I was not a fan of the flavors that came along with it. Worth trying for any licorice fan, but I would leave it at that..."
"I really enjoyed this, a well executed one-off that didn't disappoint"
"Overall I thought this was pretty good and interesting beer. I have to admit I came into this beer thinking I probably wouldn't like it, but I came away pretty impressed with the way shorts took the black ale base and infused all these different flavors to make a pretty damn tasty brew. Only shorts can take a food I don't like and model a beer after it that I do like, thats some serious skill. This beer isn't that drinkable, I think one is enough for the night, I don't think I would buy a six pack of it but I would pick up a single when in the mood. If you like black licorice or those mint chocolate cookie then you should give this brew a try. Another solid and unique offering from shorts."
"Overall I found this to be a pretty enjoyable brew given that I am not a huge fan of licorice. I think that the anise and mint pair well together and also go great with the chocolaty notes. I am not sure if this is something I would get all the time, but it is a pretty interesting treat if I am in the mood for something very different, but well executed."
"overall - another nice idiosyncratic brew from shorts."
"As usual, another extremely interesting beer from Short's. This one is pours dark and slightly murky, but with a head that sticks around. Very nice aroma that's heavy on chocolate and vanilla, and lighter on anise and mint. The beer is aged on chocolate mint leaves, anise, and vanilla beans, and I'm surprised how much chocolate comes through from the chocolate mint leaves. The anise is almost lost on the nose, but the overall effect is very pleasant, with a light snap of mint right at the end. The taste is heavier with dark licorice notes, bitter chocolate, roastiness, and a bitter earthiness. There are some vanilla notes throughout and some mintiness on the end again. A substantial beer, and perhaps just a touch harsher than it should be, but so very interesting."
"D. I don't detect the Madagascar bourbon vanilla on the nose or tongue. A unique beer - interesting enough to seek out more Short's"
"d - Overall a pretty decent beer from Short's; one of their better beers that I've had. Lots of sweet licorice in the taste. Probably couldn't drink more than one of these personally due to licorice overload, but nice none the less."
"Another great brew from the Short's crew. I found the nose very inviting, and the bold, dark, sweet flavors mingled well on my palate. Although i didnt find the overall flavor to taste be quite like black licorice, this did not deter my brain from enjoying this charming, flavorful, dark brew. Its really something unique, to my mind, and i will definitely buy this again to savor next to a roaring fire during this cold Michigan winter season."
"This is an unusual mix of flavors, so it's particular to the drinker, but there's good drinkability to it. ABV keeps it down a touch as well."
"Drinkability & Final Thoughts: This beer isn't hard to drink and it's not a terrible beer, but some things about it were a little off-putting to me. When I see such a dark pour with light carbonation and a small, tan head, and smell dark chocolate and burnt coffee, I except a rather full, chewy mouthfeel and lots of bready, roasted malt character. However, this beer's body is medium at strongest and there isn't nearly the strength of roasted malt flavor one might expect. I also think the cooling spice flavors would work better if they were held up against a thicker body and breadier flavors; as it stands, they come like an afterthought in an otherwise fairly straightforward and not particularly exemplary Euro-style dark lager. Short's doesn't entirely miss the mark but they've brewed much better."
"Pour a brown with a bit of head the disappears quickly. Smells strongly of licorice but not too overwhelmly strong. Tastes a bit bitter but overall fairly smooth. A lot of black licorice on the palette but well balanced with the rest of the malt profile. Fairly drinkable for a bitter herbal beer"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being below average. Drinkability is pretty decent and better then I expected going in. The star anise was a little strong for me, but I liked how the chocolate kicked in some towards the finish. Pretty decent beer overall."
"Drinkability is nice. This is pretty nice dark lager with good subtle hints of black licorice."
"Poured from the tap a deep dark brown (almost black) with ruby hued edges and a short khaki head. Aromas of black licorice, mint, tarragon and simmering cocoa. On the palate, this one was fairly crisp, medium bodied, somewhat medicinal, with chocolate-mint, licorice and roasted malt. Good, but not all that drinkable."
"Drinkability is good. Not a ""wow"" beer. But I'll enjoy the bottle I have."
"D: Good. I bought it again so i could rate it because I liked it so much. I may not buy a six-pack, but I'd definitely order a second pint."
"D - not too shabby - all in all a fine and very creative concoction."
"Poured from bomber into snifter. Liquid is a dark brown with a small mocha head that quickly fades. Smell is lots of black licorice, some dark malts, no hops at all. Taste is a very bitter black licorice, sugary dark malt, a slightly toasted flavor, and the finish is more black licorice. Mouthfeel was very heavy with a medium carbonation - I would have liked this one to be a little cleaner. It was tough finishing this one - I give shorts credit for their creativity, but I think there could have been something done to balance out some of the strong flavors in this beer."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - One is enough for me, but I enjoyed it."
"Pours near black with a thin head and not much lacing. The nose is quite nice with a good dose of black licorice. After that, a tad bit of vanilla and light molasses. Taste is all black licorice. Slightly sweet. Tastes fairly authentic. Good feel with a nice sweetness and good carbonation. Nice feel. A fairly one dimensional brew, but quite good and spot on in nailing the flavor."
"overall a very solid an very interesting offering. i could see myself doing this one on a whim again."
"(D)- A fun and unique take on the style. A nice idea to kick up the flavor a notch with the black licorice addition. Smooth and creamy. A successful offering from Shorts."
"The pour is like a decently formed schwarts beer. Black dark brown clear with an off white head of about two fingers. Nose was a very brisk lager apple fruit with a hint of molasses and a lot of black licorice. Palate was a savory brew of a tad bit of tang acidic quality of leathery malt. Not particularly smokey just an accent to the digestive aid quality of the beer. Licorice blends fantastically. Not chocolatly malt but on the fruit plum side. Great beer...great brewery. Fantastic food beer broad palate range with a jean feel."
"Drinkability - I'm not sure what a ""Euro Dark Lager"" is, especially since there is no description on this site. However, I will say...it does not blow me away. Short's, in my opinion, has done better with other beers. This is decent, but honestly, when they give a description of how the beer ""should"" taste (i.e. licorice) one normally cannot deny that the beer indeed does taste exactly like it (i.e. Imperial Spruce India Pilsner...holy pine trees). Here, I do not get the same. The licorice flavor is lackluster, though it is noticeable. Overall not a bad beer, but short (pun intended) of what I expected from Short's."
"Fun to try and one of the most unique beers I've had. Can't see myself having more than one of these and I wouldn't need to try it again. Worth trying, but I can see how people could get turned off by this one."
"D-Pretty high. This is one elegant beer. I'm gonna get another one of these as soon as possible."
"D - I can't do more than 3 or 4 sips of this. I don't love black licorice but never hated it. This is just a bit too much for me. I hope this never touches my lips again."
"4.5 D: Another tasty and innovative beer from Short's. Usually you won't find both of those words in the same sentence, but Short's seems to do it like clockwork. I like this a lot as it is, but if it were a bit thicker, it could be great."
"D - Better than I expected. Reminded me of thin mints, or licorice cough drops like Fisherman's Friend. I had a couple pours of this one, and I may seek out a few of the new 12oz bottles to compare."
"I have found other lagers that I really like, this one I love. I could drink multiple bottles of this in a sitting. Solid beer from beginning to end. Highly recommended, great beer."
"d - fairly drinkable, it's helped by the fact that Short's did not go overboard on the licorice, there are many other flavors going on with this that keep it interesting, alcohol is well hidden and it's easy on the palate"
"Pours jet black with a nice tan head. In the aroma, vanilla and bourbon like notes. In the taste, bourbon notes, vanilla, chocolate and a small minty burn. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry licorice and mint aftertaste. Nice bourbon like flavor minus the oak, and kind of like the minty chocolate in the end."
"this is a beer worth seeking out if you want something original, thanks irishkyle21 for sending this one my way"
"D- Seems to have a lot of flavors working in this one. Makes you want to keep sipping all night trying to pick them all out. Very good beer all around though. Would love a few of these this winter."
"What a weird brew. Weird, but good. I don't believe I need another any time soon, but it's certainly piqued my interest to see what other bizarrities this brewery has cooked up."
"D-very interesting beer, tons of licorice everywhere but the flavor seems to meld some rich chocolaty malts and the licorice to create a very dessert like beer that hasn't been seen before."
"D - Another interesting one by Short's. I think this one would have been better a year or so ago and is heading downwards. I enjoyed it, but others at the tasting didn't like it so much. Try at your own risk. That said, I think you could say that with most/all of Short's crazy beers."
"Tastes great, sweet, licorice, molasses a warming alcohol that leaves me wanting more. Great beer."
"Another huge thanks to Sean for bringing this...Pours a dark brown with a super light tan head...Aroma is medium lots of stuff going on, black licorice dominates, get some of the mint on the back...Taste is lighter than the aroma, the black licorice does not prenent as much as you would think. Light feel for sure, lager totally shows."
"Very drinkable, if you are looking for something different, buy it, buy it regardless, you won't regret it."
"Overall impression: An odd beer. Can't say I've ever had one like it. Enjoyable but not sure I'd seek it out again. A rare one and glad I could try it once."
"Overall, another very unique beer from Shorts. Some unique flavors. A very big lager that I wasn't expecting. Drinks easy, however."
"M/D: I could pound this beer, so at 8 percent it is super drinkable. Also super creamy and smooth feel. Great brew!"
"D: The ale doesn't feel like an 8% whopper (of course these 12 oz bottles could be lower). An interesting take that oculd use a little more anise."
"Overall, a different and extremely well-made beer. I might get a sixpack for the cellar."
"Another unique one, and well done by Shorts."
"A nice change of pace beer, this goes down slower than a standard lager."
"A nice black pour with a light tan two finger head , leaving some spotty lacing , medium carbonation . Aroma of black licorice, vanilla , roast , and a hint of mint leaves . Flavor is much the same as the aroma , roasty , , wood , vanilla , chocolate, licorice, and light hops , light;y bitter , short finish , light body, thin feel, quite drinkable and not too bad ."
"Cheers to you, Shorts, you really know how to make them!"
"This is certainly one of those beers you wish was year-round, even with the oddball ingredients. The quest to obtain this beer will be worth it."
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"Cheers!"
"D- It's a definite sipper. Flavor made me want to take full sips, but the ABV really sneaks up on you about halfway through the bottle. The complexities of this beer really make me want to drink it again to try to ""figure it out."""
"D: due to this beer being a lager, itis very smooth and clean. Nice to have a few glasses but may become a little much."
"I treated my snifter to Short's Black Licorice Lager, which had a dark, rich brown color with a copper red outline along the curves of the glass. The head produced was minimal, with a heavy straw tinting to it and the lacing climbed, descended and clung beautifully as I swirled the beer. The smell came across strongly of roasted malts, perhaps roasted chocolate malt, with nice toasty whiffs and pleasant bits of sweetness. It was akin to a slightly overdone cookie. Upon the first sip, I was struck again by roasted malts, this time coming across like a nice toasty biscuit. As I swallowed I was hit with a pop of the star anise, producing a drop of black licorice on the tongue. There are very subdued, slight suggestions of vanilla and a refreshing aftertaste that could be construed as mint if one were so inclined. For all of the flavor elements involved, it is still a remarkably smooth beer. The lager wins out in the end in what is a crisp, clean and well made affair. The body is full and the beer finishes slightly dry."
"Overall this is a perfect showcasing of what Short's can do with good quality ingredients outside of barley, yeast & hops. This whacky combination of ingredients really makes for a stunningly flavorful and pallet training experience. I'd love to pair this with some lamb vindaloo and some Nan bread with mango chutney. This beer is begging for a daring food pairing for sure. Although, it's doing quite fine on its own on this perfect 70F late-spring night."
"D - Short's certainly nailed the flavor, it is also very easy drinking and wouldn't of guessed it was 8%. This has a lot of flavor and YOU should definitely try it!"
"i wouldn't really like to session this one, but very tasty - a nice treat with a meal i would imagine"
"D- The alcohol is well hidden, but it does catch up with you. The mint aspect is a bit overdone, but this is unique, tasty, and well worth a try."
"D-I wanted this beer to give me more than it did. I was looking forward to this, but came away somewhat disappointed based on my apparently lofty expectations."
"This is pretty off the wall with an complex mix of flavors. I'm not sure if it really tastes like black licorice, but it does taste interesting. I love trying Short's beers because of stuff like this."
"Overall I like it, I don't know that I would stock the fridge with it though."
"Dark crimson-brown in the glass, excellent clarity and head retention. The nose is a melange of licorice, vanilla and root beer. It's faintly tar-like, chocolatey, minty, roasty. The taste is similarly odd; licorice, root beer, green tea and mint at the forefront with a subtle vanilla character. Medium-light body, herbal, spicy, unique. Black licorice finish. An odd beer, but very enjoyable."
"Palate is medium-full and fairly smooth with somewhat soft carbonation. Overall this beer is good and very different. My only real criticism is that drinkability is not terribly high."
"D: Good, damn these Imperial series brews are so good and so unique. The best Lager to ever pass my lips."
"Overall, this is a wonderfully crafted and very sweet dessert beer that's not fooling around when it comes to the licorice. Their imperial series has been a wonderfully creative mix of beers and this is definitely one of my favorites. An outstanding beer."
"Very smooth, and medium on the mouthfeel. Enjoyable and well done."
"Poured a dark brown color with a large (5 finger) sized off white head. Aromas of licorice, anise, roasty, vanilla beans, and chocolate. Tastes started off very minty with licorice, chocolate, lighter vanilla, herbal, and anise. This one was, as most Short's are, 'different' and I appreciate a brewer trying beers like this!"
"D - Drinkability is good. This is one of the most interesting brews I've had for a while. The alcohol content is fairly high but does not hinder the beer in any way. Unfortunately, the flavor combination really does not work that well for me. Still not a bad brew though. As it warms the flavors start to smooth out a little better. Throughout, I had the nagging sensation that I was drinking sour milk but it never came through strong enough to really hamper beer overall. Just something that sits in the back of the mind and will not go away. Still, I'm glad I got the chance to try it out."
"Black Licorice Lager is an extremely interesting and unique beer. I truly have never experienced a beer quite like it. Given the fact that I hate licorice, I'm surprised that I like it as much as I do. But, it has a very nice flavor and really impresses. I can't say I'm in love with it, but I definitely like it quite a bit. I haven't had much experience with Short's beer, but I am very impressed with what I've had. They certainly have a knack for blazing unchartered territory. This venture is an overall success. Recommended if you can find a bottle."
"Thanks to hoppymeal for this one."
"Drinkability- This is by far the tastiest Short's brew I've had so far (although I have a growler of Cup O' Joe in the fridge, expecting good things). It's pretty damned unique and not some crazy ass licorice beer like the name implies. It's lightly chocolaty with some licorice and caramel. I wish the mint played more of a role but none-the-less this thing is tasty. Big thanks again to Jeff for his generosity!"
"From the other Short's beers I have tried I'm not sure if I could have finished a whole 750ml bottle by myself (maybe their Imperial Black Cherry Porter) but I will have no problem finishing and savoring this bottle."
"Thanks to hoppymeal for sending this as an extra in a trade a while back..."
"Roasted malts and anise spice up front. Hints at being a licorice bomb, but luckily more flavors quickly blend in mid-palate. Dark chocolate, hints of fruity Kenyan coffee, tobacco, leather, and some very ripe plums. Slightly tangy/spicy edge throughout (maybe fennel). Earthy anise and licorice root also stays throughout, but it's not overbearing (reminds me of root beer more than black licorice). It's actually pretty tasty as it lingers in the long finish. Medium body with a somewhat oily feel, especially in the finish. I like this a lot! Another great brew from Joe Short."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Easy drinking somewhat lighter lager body. Quite an interesting, complex brew overall. A good one to share with its strong flavor, herbal/spicy profile and aftertaste. If you enjoy black licorice you need to seek this out. Another wonderful experiment by Short's."
"Drinkability: Recommended. The best root beer I've had in a coon's age. Yet another wonderful creation by Short's Brewing."
"Thanks again, hoppymeal"
"D: Split the bottle with some fellow BA's and enjoyed every sip. The light mouthfeel and low alcohol makes it easy to drink but the licorice taste could be a little much after a 750 of this."
"So goes with the taste. Very well balanced. Soft bourbon, anise, fennel and caramel blend nicely. Presently surprising. The anise/licorice is not the main focus. Slight medicinal touches. Easy drinking as well. Very nice brew!"
"Pours black with a small light coffee and cream colored head that slowly recedes to a ring, sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Aroma is strong of anise, like a box of good and plenty's, also some nice cola like vanilla aroma that blends with a soft mintiness. A great aroma, very soft and yet very complex. Taste is soft vanilla and cola up front that quickly blends with some anise which dwells on the palette into the somewhat astringent and slightly roasted aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium, definitely some malts here to get that alcohol up there, but still crisp and clean, soft carbonation on the tongue mid taste and an astringent, slightly bitter and nicely dry finish. I can't get enough of this beer, for its alcohol content, it is very well balanced, the anise and vanilla melded very well together and the lagering allows these flavors to come thru better without fighting other yeast flavors. Outstanding aroma and very tastey, no problem with the full 750ml. If you like black licorice, seek this out!"
