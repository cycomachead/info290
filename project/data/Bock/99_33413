This beer is like most other saranac beers, if it were a pitcher it would be todd wellmeyer. It's a solid but it will not overwhelm you.

3.5,2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium amber with a one finger head, OK longevity and decent lace. Good caramel malt smells mixed with just enough hop aroma, although perhaps a bit much for a bock. Nice rich caramel malt flavors but a bit too much hop flavor/bitterness at the end - at least for a bock anyway. Good flavor though, better than the Black Diamond Bock IMO. A decent offering.","sabrills70","Feb 02, 2007"
3.06,-10.8,4,3,3,3,3,"Medium reddish-amber with a medium-sized, off-white, frothy, slowly-diminishing head. Some tiny particles floating around in it and the case wasnt old or mishandled, all other beers in the 12 Beers case were fine. Smell is of mild malt and very light fruit. Taste is mostly bready malt, with caramel and some hops showing up on the finish but mostly just to impart some bitterness. It has a medium-full body, dry texture and low carbonation. Overall, its not bad, just nothing special.","ski271","Jan 24, 2007"
3.92,14.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"F.X. Matt has delivered a beautiful beer in their Saranac Bock. From it's glowing orange-chestnut body and creamy tan head, to it's lingering finish, it's a winner! It offers a very nice appearance of slightly hazy deep amber and chestnut, with a crimson-orange cast and glowing orange and gold highlights. Good head retention. Good lacing. The beautifully malty aroma expresses a bit of toastiness and dark caramel as well as some floral, leafy, and spicy hops. In the mouth it's smooth with a lightly dextrinous body; and just enough very-fine-bubbled carbonation to give a gentle zest to the tongue. The flavor is well-balanced, and malty but not sweet. It's grainy, toffeeish, and caramelish; balanced by a firm bitterness, spicy and floral hops, and an underlying acidity. It finishes dry and floral with a spicy hop and alcohol accent. It's not the biggest, or the most malty, or even the most drinkable... but it is really well done and accessible with a decent amount of character. Worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Jan 07, 2007"

The aroma is mostly malt; caramel seems to come out the most but also a biscuit like property. The taste is mostly of malts, caramel again along with a roasted flavor that seems to go pretty well together and finishes with the lightest of hops as it is there a sec and gone the next. Over all this is a middle of the road brew, not something to write home about but not a bad offering, it is easy to drink.","Stimack","Jan 01, 2007"

3.25,-5.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"A watered down bock with some flavor, but lacking in overall presence. Copper pour releases some bready malt aromas- not much different on tasting only with a slight bitter finish rounding out the profile. Not much here, but it is drinkable. Like most of saranac's offerings, it is a good intro to the style for those scared of better tasting brews.","kernalklink","Dec 25, 2006"
3.7,7.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours an amber color with an offwite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a smooth, malty scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has a dry, yet malty flavor that boasts of a mild crystal malt and not much else. It goes down easy and finishes with some residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent brew, but nothing too impressive.","WesWes","Dec 23, 2006"
3.03,-11.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"D: Drinkable, but I don't think this would be at the top of my list when ordering a brew. Nothing that blows me away--how come Saranac seems to be a pedestrian brewery?","bjohnson","Dec 21, 2006"

3.68,7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours a very clear bronze with copper highlights. Dense two finger head, off-white in color and holds a cap well, leaving spotty lace. Crystal and lots of pale malt in the nose, with a light noble hop aroma. Toasty Munich and Vienna maltiness upfront, followed by caramel and slight dextrinous taste. Hop profile is perhaps more assertive than appropriate, but the bitterness in the aftertaste really balances out this malty beer along with plenty of floral Hallertau and spicy Saaz flavor. The medium-full body and light carbonation exaggerate the rich malt character creating a heavier mouthfeel and lingering sweetness without cloying. Finishes residual with an evenly matched german hop acidity, allowing a good drinkability.","PBRstreetgang","Dec 15, 2006"
4.34,26.5,3,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Got this in the Saranac 12 Beers of Winter Sampler. So far this is the best of the bunch. I once tasted Wagners Sled Dog Dopplebock and really disliked the strong flavor and wasnt sure how I was going to like this bock beer when I saw the dark color. I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted it. It had a creamy mouthfeel, rich malty flavor and smooth finish.This was an excellent tasting lager and was much better tasting than Saranacs Adirondack Lager. I would like to see Saranac add this one to their regular lineup as well.","rohrbachsfan","Dec 11, 2006"
4.05,18.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Dark lager is the description and yes is a spring bock or doppelbock. It is closer to a doppelbock in color and a spring hybrid bock in flavor.

The beer presents a significant sweet malt smell, but its richness and depth could be a little more intense. The beer is modestly sweet with a clean fresh bread crust flavor. The finish has a slight herbal bitterness. Appropriately, theres not much hop flavor in the beer. Medium body and fairly medium carbonation. This is a clean and drinkable bock.

4.47,30.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A new-found variety to me. Not that I hadn't seen them before, but only recently have I bought (and enjoyed) traditional Bock beers. Most of the others from Germany. I'd tried another rather popular ""Bock"" style (from a US brewery) and found it drinkable, but nothing to write home (or write BA) about. So this was a pleasant surprise to try a version from one of my favorite breweries. Incredibly rich color and head retention, with a nice malty flavor and richness, augmented by subtle carbonation. Just enough hops (even a bit more than expected) to balance the flavor while not detracting from the malt. My sample bottle came from my 12 Beers of Winter variety pack, but I'd buy this by the 6-er or the case if I could.","tugdriver7","Nov 08, 2006"

The smell of the malt immediately rises to the top of the glass after the pour with the malt hitting your lips as soon as you taste it. German style beer, with almost a dubbel taste. Nice, thick mouthfeel. Saranac's description of a ""rich full-bodied"" beer is right on the nose. Highly recommended.","maddogruss","Oct 31, 2006"
3.41,-0.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: another decent but not overwhelming beer from Saranac. A bit more maltiness in the flavor would bring it up a notch. Since it is milder this is an easy to drink bock.","Gavage","Oct 30, 2006"

The smell was sweet yet not sweet. I know that doesn't make sense, but that's the best I can describe it. The taste was a good bitter taste, but not awful strong. It went down very smooth. Don't drink and review.","treehugger02010","Oct 28, 2006"

I'm never quite sure how to describe bock flavor, but I know it when I taste it or smell it. The sweet, caramel and licorish-like malts are there, although not terrible rich. There's also a bit of a spicey, hot hops element to this brew. It seems Saranac has been uping their hops in a couple brews lately - awesome. Overall, not a bad beer for a the price. Tasty and very drinkable but no award winner.","tempest","Oct 25, 2006"
