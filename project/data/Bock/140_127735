I like the elements that make it up but the final flavor just doesn't work out for me. The rye's spice and sweets clash sometimes with the citrus which clashes with the apple and grape fruit flavors present. Not bad by any means but I don't think the vision results in a balanced final product.","cbutova","Beers"

Nice aroma of caramel malt, light tropical fruit and rye. Flavor of bready and caramel malt with a hint of biscuit, citrus juice and an assertive dose of tart rye, grassy hops. Medium bodied with peppery carbonation. An interesting hybrid of bock and hopped rye. There is moderate bock style malt flavors here, but they are pushed into the background by the peppery hops and semi-tart rye flavors, which combine very nicely. Certainly not a traditional bock, but an interesting and tasty variant of rye ales. I liked this quite a bit.","LiquidAmber","Sep 09, 2014"

4,7.8,,,,,,"A rye bock???  Consider my curiosity aroused...  A fairly active pour yields a large voluminous two plus fingers worthy of crisp frothy light khaki colored head comprised of mostly large chunky bubbles...  Excellent retention...  The color is a chameleon light mix of light gold and dark copper that changes based upon the lighting...  A moderate bit of exceedingly small bubbled carbonation rises sluggishly throughout...  The nose is kind of hard to place...  A mix of toasted malt and overly ripened fruits...  Some light caramel notes as well...  Toffee...  Some light brown sugar...  Perhaps just the faintest hint of rye...  Quite tasty...  Stays true to the aroma...  There may be the addition of some faint semi sweet chocolate...  No standouts, just great harmony amongst the various flavors...  Goes down easily sip after sip...  Uber quaffable...  I can't quite place my finger on it as there is nothing earth shattering about this beer, it's just really solid and highly enjoyable in every facet...  All the components work well together to yield something that is much more than the sum of its parts...  A terrific job by Sierra Nevada and Oskar Blues...  This would be  staple on my rotation if readily available and year round...  Hands down the best of the Beer Camp Across America collection that I've tried...","philbe311","Sep 07, 2014"

Coarse feel and finish, drinkable yet bock doesn't come to mind as much as amber lager does, and that diminishes with warming.

Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. Well done brew. One of my favorite from the Beer Camp 12 pack.","Jmamay22","Aug 19, 2014"

Rye malt and tea leaf mix with lemon, lime, tangerines, floral perfume, honeysuckle and apricot to form a beer that is unconventional and off beat. I like it, despite it being unlike any Bock I've ever had or for that matter any rye.","KYGunner","Aug 17, 2014"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a gorgeous clear amber color with a nice bit of bubbles and a wonderful, fluffy, two finger off-white head. A very nice looking beer. Scents of rye toast, tangy sweet orange flesh, marmalade, apricot jelly, sweet malt and a bit of white wheat bread. A very nice, sweet, malty and bright fruity aroma profile. It is enticing and showcases the ingredients nicely. Flavor begins with a nice bit of spicy rye toast, mingling with marmalade, tangy wheat and a lightly bitter orange peel flavor. This moves into a middle with a more moderate level of bitterness with flavors of orange peel, more overt toasty rye, a bit of alcohol and hint of grapefruit peel and floral hops. Finish is lightly sweet but balanced with a light level of bitterness with notes of toasted rye, orange peel, a bit of wheat bread and tangy wheat malt and a bit of floral hops. Aftertaste is toasted spicy rye, bitter orange peel and a hint of white wheat bread. A good flavor profile that is quite complex in its overall makeup yet stays bright and refreshing. Very nicely done. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth, easy drinking feel. Very nice and quite refreshing in body despite the beer's ABV. Overall this is a nice beer that took some good ingredients and made a wonderful end product. It's malty and rich, yet also bright, fruity and refreshing. The aroma is also superb and the mouthfeel enhances the overall impression. Very well done.","Auraan","Aug 07, 2014"

Smell is a bit underwhelming for me; it's not bad in any way but it is really muted. I love to sniff so smell is a must for me. What is there is mostly mild hops and faint rye. Taste is pretty solid, good all around but again, fairly benign. I think Sierra Nevada and the collaborators were't really trying to ruffle any feathers with these beers or break any new ground, as everything so far seems to be pretty mild. Nutty, earthy, some citrusy hops and I get the very faint notes of anise or fennel. Some pleasant rye and caroway aftertaste. Moderate body with lively carbonation. Overall, decent, but like usual I wish the rye flavor was a little more robust.","Samuel906","Aug 06, 2014"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, I was really pleased with this, especially considering that it hasn't gotten as much buzz as some of the other beers in the box. I like rye beers, so perhaps this one speaks to me more than to most people. I was impressed with how detectible the rye was in this beer--sometimes it can be just a fleeting afterthought that allows the brewer to put that sexy "RYE" on the label. Not so in this case. I'd gladly buy another round of this one if it were available for regular purchase.","LambicPentameter","Aug 06, 2014"

Style guidelines really don't apply here, but who cares? The ends justify the means. This one needs to be more than a one-time deal.

Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange peel, caramel, toast, spicy rye, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/grassy hops and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange peel, caramel, toast, spicy rye, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange peel, caramel, toast, spicy rye, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of bright citrus/grassy hops and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice hoppy bock style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/grassy hops and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 01, 2014"

Who was the genius that thought this would be a good marketing idea? This really could be an excellent series and I am a huge fan of Sierra Nevada, but seriously you couldn't do a better job of getting relatively fresh beers out the door instead of what appears to be just another attempt to cash in on the popularity of the craft brew industry. I'm not saying the beers are horrible and the reason I bought this 12 pack was that some of breweries don't distribute in Texas, but I don't encourage or recommend anyone buy this series at it's inflated price.

Not surprisingly, it’s the rye and this Ella hop varietal that are emphasized here, and it’s quite clear. Still, it’s pulled off with enough finesse that you don’t forget what the beer is, and you can focus on whichever side(s) of it you please. Personally, I’m pleased that it’s so drinkable, looks great, and legitimately pulls off a fusion of disparate style and ingredients.","fmccormi","Jul 29, 2014"

Large bock flavors come through on the nose and then a hint of the dry, earthy rye kicks in. This guy tastes a lot like the nose, the bock coming through but just not enough of the rye for me. I'm a big rye fan and when I see rye, I expect some serious rye flavors, I'm talking Cain and Ebel rye flavor, Red Rye IPA flavors!! However, it's a well made beer, excellent malt backbone, great mouthfeel, super smooth. Overall a well made beer and very drinkable for 7+ % abv but just not enough rye coming through to make me excited.","bneel317","Jul 29, 2014"

The beer itself is a clear light brown that appears almost orange, which is unlike any bock I've had before. The smell is sweet as a traditional bock but with strong rye notes that almost cover the smell. The smell also seems to have a sweet orange smell as well. The hop smell appears to be floral. The taste is a bit different than the smell. The taste tends to have all of the same notes but in different degrees. In the taste, the rye notes are much stronger as are the sweet orange notes, the sweetness normally associated with bocks is really down in comparison. The floral and orange hop notes are still present. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the thicker side despite the biting carbonation. The feel is smooth but fluffy at the same time. Overall, a decent attempt at a hybrid bock and while it does succeed to an extent, the bock part of the beer seems to suffer quite a bit.

There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid balance of rye and citrus forward hops that is slightly better in the smell to me.","UCLABrewN84","Beers"

Aroma has a lot of grassy, flowery hop scent, and some identifiable rye pepperiness. Great malt flavor, complex with notes of bread crusts along with spicy rye. Bitterness is moderate, in the maibock range. Finish is rather dry for the the general bock style but perfectly good for this hybrid. This a fine, fine beer, possibly the best in the collection so far for me.","allengarvin","Jul 23, 2014"

Served in a mug, the beer pours a mostly clear copper/orange color with about an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is very light, the brew smells like rye, toffee, and some fruit (berries, light citrus). It tastes like bready malt, apples, spicy rye, candied oranges and also a weird slightly metallic bitter flavor that isn't exactly pleasing. Unfortunately the taste only gets worse the longer I drink it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. It seems to me that something is definitely off with this brew. Problem is I'm not going to buy another case just to see if this was a bad can or not, but if I come across a single somewhere I'll try it again.","bluejacket74","Jul 20, 2014"
