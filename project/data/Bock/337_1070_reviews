"O: An easy drinker, and maybe a good gateway for someone getting into craft beer, but not the best Bock available for sure. Nothing offensive, but nothing to seek out."

"Had this on tap at the brewery. Had a decent light brown color with a short head. Not too bad for a spring beer. Decent flavor with decent body. Not too much flavor. Goes down easy and was very nice to drink. But nothing too spectacular as I was expecting more."

"The first sip on this one starts off really sweet. Thankfully that tones down on further tastes. Still pretty malty sweet. Smooth feel with a mild carbonation. A fairly easy-to-drink brew. Been ages since I've had a bock, or at least I can't recall the last time I had one. This isn't all too bad really."

"Mouth...Aw heck I can't finish this review. It's not a real traditional bock, but it's a good interpretation of it to me. Absolutely delicious and refreshing on a hot Texas day."

"FOOD NOTE: this thing really sweetens and opens up when I drink it with food. I'm not big on pairing food with beer, but this particular brew and a happy accident showed me how sometimes a proper food pairing can help bring out the good flavor notes in the beer -- anything salty seems to help this beer's taste."

"Overall I really like this spring bock because it is such a complex flavored beer with a rather high alcohol content in which the alcohol does not dominate. The boys and gals at Saint Arnolds have a great beer here and I tip my virtual hat to them."

"O: A very sessionable beer. Robust but not overpowering. Bless you, St. Arnold."
"Atmosphere is decent. Nice hue, medium carbonation, not much head or lacing. Nose is malty with some sweet notes. Syrupy, woody malt character, with a cloying synthetic sweetness. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Getting more of the flavor of the sweet malt...kinda like it. Very easy drinking. Even a bit of hops on the backend...but mainly, a decent malty bock. Almost like a doppelbock light. So much better, and certainly more boozy than it's in state rival Shiner, for nearly the same price."
""
"Overall, to me it's Meh. Weird, like it can't figure out what style it is. Not too crazy about it. This will probably be my only one."
"Other reviews have accurately noted this beer's characteristics so I will not bother you again with that. I like the beer fine but, having had many German bocks and remembering back to when I used to drink Shiner Bock (when it was a true bock), I find this one a bit too hoppy for the style. Sure, it fits the American taste (too many hops) but, again, not truly representative of the style."
"An easy drinking beer. I could see myself having one of these after mowing the lawn."
""
"first off thanks to UHCougar12 for this beer! translucent copper body with a thin off white head that settles rather quickly. taste and smell are very similiar, no big surprises. nice bready malt body with some caramel make this an easy drinkin bock. medium body and a slight crispness make an enjoyable bock beer."
""
"Pour is a dark copper, transparent, with a yellowish white head. The nose has hints of brown malt, loads of caramel, rather buttery caramel/toffee with a hint of grain underneath. The taste is much of the same but sweeter, buttery caramel and toffee cascade over the tongue as a fruity malt sweetness plays in back. The grain sits faintly underneath. The body is super creamy and lush, lighter carbonation but the body is actually rather airy itself."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear dark copper with a two-finger length off white head. The aroma is sweet and bready. The taste is slightly sweet with some hop bitterness to balance. The roasted barley malt definitely comes through in the taste, but the flavors are certainly a bit odd. There is light carbonation and the beer has a medium body. There is a lingering aftertaste. This is an interesting and fairly easy to drink bock. I would recommend it."

"A good spring bock. A bit more head retention would be nice. Good malt character and fairly well-balanced with the bittering. Not a stunner, but certainly enjoyable."

"Pours a muddy light brown color with a thin off-white head. Limited spotty lacing on the sides of the glass before falling into a thin collar. The nose is fairly plain with some bready malt and a touch of caramel. Bread crust there, too. The flavor brings some malt sweetness and lightly-toasted bread. Slightly doughy with some caramel and light toffee. Perhaps a bit nutty. Light bitterness in the midpalate and in the finish. Actually, perhaps a bit too much bitterness, as it cuts through the sweet caramel that makes the flavor so enjoyable. The feel is medium with good carbonation. A solid take on the style."
"D - A slightly above-average bock. Probably the definition if 'B' beer. Enjoyable in the moment, but not something I'd seek out again. Carbonation zest would keep me from having multiple bottles/pints."
"Overall - I'm just discovering the whole bock concept. I just don't like most lagers, but this is good. I don't know that I'd seek it out, but it's tasty and I could put a bunch of these away no problem."
"The beer was a dark copper orange color with a thick off white head. It smells of mostly sweet caramel with a hint of apple and lemon. There is a slight bitterness followed by loads of sweet malt, with nutty flavors, alcohol, lemon and a bready finish. The beer is medium bodied and sticky. This is a little too malty for my taste."
"Decent beer. Very abundant locally in Austin but wouldn't be my first go-to for a mid/lighter style."
"Overall: A good bock and a perfect brew for spring. This is another winner from St. Arnold and a beer I would enjoy drinking again and again. This bock would also stand up very well to its German counterparts. Certain larger companies that make ""Bock"" could learn a thing or two from this."
"The beer pours a brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is pretty good. I get a ton of malt, mainly toffee and some bready malts. Just what I expect in a bock. The flavor is more of the same. There is a nice caramel and toffee backbone to the flavor. The alcohol is not noticeable. There is some slight hop flavor, but the beer is pretty sweet overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice bock."
"The Beer had a good bock color. The nice was nice but not over bearing. I smelt malts originally. The taste was the same. Lots of sweet malts and very easy on the pallate. I really enjoyed this beer. One of the best bocks that ive ever had. Really really good beer."
"Pours clear light brown in color with a soda like off-white head. Doesn't last more than a minute. No lacing at all. The nose is somewhat toasty with minimal hop presence. Seems to have lots of earth tones. Smells good but not very aromatic. You have to dig for it. Taste is of toasted grains and bread like. It has some bitter hops flavor as well. Nothing to special. Close to light bodied and high carbonation. Which makes it a little refreshing for a bock seeing is that the flavors are mellow. Drinkability is high in the sense that nothing is over powering. Although ABV would bring it down. An average beer at best. A little better than shiner bock."
"D - Very drinkable, really great offering from St. Arnold."
"Pretty good for a Bock beer, it's rich and flavorable."
"First off, once again i'm biased about these guys, i like em' and what they are doing in Texas. Had this at a BBQ and found it very easy to drink, amlost too easy. I was not a fan of the damination of the caramely malty notes, kind of over-powered the beer. Good beer, but not one of the better ones from these guys."
"D: It's actually quite good. It aroma is very sweet and the initial flavor is sweet, but there is just enough hop to reel in the sweetness."
"D: Not a bad little bock. Easy drinking and refreshing, though not all that balanced."
"D - Very easy to drink, and quite tasty. If it weren't a seasonal, would make a pretty good session beer. Recommended."
"Pours a clear amber with a thin tan head. Has a freshly kilned barley aroma. Taste is very malt oriented, as a bock should be. A hint of hops only to balance the powerful sweetness. A hint of alcohol is detectable in the finish. Mouthfeel is good, medium carbonation. I would drink this again, a good example of a style that you don't see too often."
"The mouth could use a bit more heft but it works as a lighter version. The sweetness limited me to one, but it was an enjoyable one!"
"Overall, a good beginner bock, certainly drinkable, but not very complex."
"Reddish brown pour into a pint glass. Nice head with little or no lacing. Lovely clarity that is very inviting. Subtle caramel malt nose. Floral aromas waft by intermittently. Taste is all malt and a clean finish Not a terribly complex beer, but I like its good malt flavor and drinkability."
"Spring Bock is an interesting beer. There's some good flavors inside, and it's relatively easy-drinking, but the mouthfeel wasn't my favorite for a bock. All in all though, it's a nice spring seasonal that's off the beaten path of typical styles."
"M/D - Light- to medium-bodied with medium carbonation. It is overall dry, crisp and refreshing. It is a good toasted flavor."
"Pale & pilsner malts starting things off in the flavor department--some caramel notes pull through as it warms. Grassy hops lend a healthy dose of bitterness to balance the malt; mineral-water crispness with a trace of musty, sour sulfur in the finish. Mouthfeel is where St. Arnold's Spring Bock shines, as its medium-light body is both crisp and creamily smooth at the same time. Lingering bitter note from the hops is mild enough to allow the malt to sweeten up the back of the palate. Wow...what an underrated beer. Wish I would've known sooner. Definitely a repeat for me this spring...next stop: six-pack."
"on tap at Petrol station. Clear, bright copper color, 1/2 finger of foam with a half life of about 20 seconds. The aroma is malty-sweet and a little toasted, very much bock-y. The taste is what I would call strong lager, sweet, clean, and malty. Absolutely appropriate for the style while not being anything too out of the ordinary. The bodyis medium-plus, again giving appropriate bock presence. Very good for the style, should be rated higher in my opinion."
"d- very drinkable, and very enjoyable. i wish that this beer wasn't seasonal."
"This is a fine bock, just what I expected for the style, and very enjoyable and drinkable."
"D- This isn't an increadible beer. It's not all that complex. But it is quite drinkable and works well for what it is. I will certainly try this again when it comes out in the spring. Could be a nice memory former for what spring in Texas is like."
"D: A good bock. Nothing out of this world, but this is a good beer that I could and do revisit from time to time."
"very clean finish, nice carbonation, and very smooth. A great Bock!"
"Very refreshing, easy to drink, and a pleasant bock overall."
"Overall impression: A nice spring offering, good bock flavors and plenty drinkable."
"D - good brew, celebrate Spring!"
"Not too many southern American bocks out there to compare to, it's an underrepresented style in the region. The flavor profile is sweet caramely malts playing off of toasty malts and a slight hop bitterness. Taste is pretty similar to the nose. A mild alcohol bite ensues in mid-palate and the finish is decently clean for a bock. It's ok, but perhaps a bit too toasty for me. Probably my least favorite seasonal from SA."
"Pours a nice clear/clean golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tannish head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, sweet, with some spices and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, spicey. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Like I said, this is the best bock I've had as to date."
"A nice beer for early spring in Texas."
"Maltier than my usual brews but refreshing. I enjoyed the bitter kick at the end, but it might offend bock purists."
"One of my favorite St Arnold beers."
"Not bad drinkability. An interesting bock; a decent beer overall."
"D- Very drinkable for elevated ABV"
"Pours a body which is amber red in color, clear, and has a medium-sized white head. Has a hoppy aroma. A nice clean taste, hops, and some malt, with a bitter aftertaste. Not too much flavor but clean, almost like a lawnmower beer."
"Drinkability: Reasonably decent on the drinkability though the sweetness would keep me from simply pounding them down, but, yeah, it's a good bock, overall."
"From a 12oz bottle - Pours a slightly cloudy orange/red with a small white head. Smells of spices, alcohol, malt, and honey. First taste sweet and floral and even with tons of honey notes present, this beer falls off as it is devoid of much other flavor. Not impressed."
"D: very drinkable, one of the better bocks I have had. great for early spring."
"Pours like honey out of the battle settling into the glass just the same. Head is a quick fading biscuity tan standing at one and a half inches. Nose has sweet ripe grape skins matched with soft but zesty phelonic spicey tones. As you take first sip you get creamy carmalized sweetness and dusty peppery feel. The spice feel is consistant and very dry throughout the palate. Leaves kind of a bitter resin like mouthfeel. Would maybe go well with a piece of rubarb pie. Drinkability is average."
"Tastes dark toasted malt that's drying from solid ferment. A mild flat sour cuts the wet and clears the way for hop flavor. Rounded flower hops, but also a dirty and vegetal contribution. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is moderate. If the flavors were more pleasing the mouthfeel would help with the flavors. Because the flavor is a bit unfavorable, the mouthfeel holding the flavors on the tongue is a negative."
"Pours a deep amber/copper color, minimal tan head rises and fades, spots of lacing on the glass. Smell is malt-mania! Sticky-sweet brown sugar, brown bread, caramel. Taste falls right in line with the smell, slightly tangy citric hop presence. Really active carbonation, tongue-zinging bubbles on this one, medium-bodied, slight drying effect. This is tasty...if it was available in my area, or on tap somewhere, I'd have it again in a heartbeat."
"Overall- Not a bad beer. I'm not a big Bock fan to begin with but I couldn't penalize it because of my personal tastes. Too me it was just a bit too sweet and not balanced well between the hops and malts."
"D - very nice drinking bock from Texaas"
"Something about Saint Arnold's bottles and labels appeals to me. Just thought I'd throw that out there. Spring Bock is a solid (there's that word again) version that is close to being good. If you love the style, bump the taste score to the next highest number. Thanks mhewes. Under the cap... 'Hop, drop & roll'."
"D- Good beer! glad i was able to try this one!"
"There is a definite alcohol bite to this, though it does have a bit of spicy hop in the finish. Is a bit too dry in the mouth for me. But all in all, a very nice version of a bock. I could drink this frequently.l"
"A good beer, but a bit too high in ABV for the style, making it not as drinkable as others. This is pushing into Dopplebock territory, really."
"What can I say? I just didn't like this one."
"Like I said, the mouthfeel should be thicker and smoother. Some moderate crispness and a nice lingering apple like sweetness on the finish are nice though, which do increase drinkability to me."
"D: A beer that you will know how many you drank. Doesn't really go down quickly, but it is something that can be enjoyed."
"One will hit the spot but another is unnecessary... that said, this is a well done bock."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, my overall impression of this beer is that it's rather lack-luster, although it's difficult to pin-point exactly what is making me feel that way. I really wouldn't want to drink this beer again unless my options were limited."
"Drinkability: This is a tasty beer, but should quench better. An all around solid brew."
"Poured into my pilsner glass a nice crystal clear copper color, very light tan head that settles fairly quickly. Aroma is very malty sweet, almost molasses like. Taste is somewhat bready with hints of caramel or butterscotch. a slight bit of syrupy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thicker than I expected, but not too bad. All in all this is a good spring afternoon beer. Nice and sweet, clean, crisp. A good style."
"Spring Bock is a damn fine beer. I had somewhat high expectations given St. Arnold's lofty reputation and this certainly met the bill. The nose could certainly stand a little fine tuning, but it's still a fine beer despite that small flaw. Certainly recommended."
"Notes: Very enjoyable stuff, one of the better American-made bocks I've tried."
"Good drinkable beer. Perfect for spring with it's warm days and cold nights."
"D: This is my first St. Arnold's brew and I actually think it's quite drinkable. I'd definitely be interested in trying a few more from this brewery."
"Verdict: Spring Bock is a well-balanced dark lager with rich malt and crisp citrus hiding above-average potency. With this beer Saint Arnold is really forcing me to rethink my standards for a good bock, and I love them for it."
"12oz bottle courtesy of mhewes, this is my second St. Arnold's brew. Dark reddish color with a good sized head. The smell was kinda ""beery"" and average. I know that doesn't make sense so I'll say it smelled ""lagerish"". The flavor was nice and clean with a hint of fruitiness. This was a decent beer and easy to drink but I am just not able to appreciate lagers fully (yet)."
"Overall, I thought this was a very solid offering from them. I would have no issues with drinking this one down regular. Very nice offering."
"Smells like tasty caramel malt. The taste fits the smell, with tasty caramel, toffee, and a hint of hops rounding it out. There's an acidic tang from either hops or a hint of dark fruits; I'm not sure. Just very pleasant and drinkable."
"Served in my Leute Bok glass. No freshness dating on bottle. Poured a nice hazy amber color. Three-quarter inch loose white head disappeared within about 30 seconds. Some watery lacing, but poor adherence. Nose is a little boozey and sweet as well as the presence of dark fruit. Flavor was definitely more full-bodied than the nose. Sweet, malty, bready, caramel and dark fruit flavors; finish was a bit tangy. Some effervescence in the mouth creates a light burn. Drinkability is limited. It was definitely worth a try and had an interesting taste, but wouldn't want more than one."
"This is heavy as expected but doesn't necessarily pack as much flavor punch as we'd like. Good effort nonetheless"
"I'd be willing to partner up with this Saint for a session, & considering how quickly it's going perhaps it's good I only have one. Nice bock!"
"Drinks pretty easy, a solid Bock"
"Smooth and clean, this beer is easy to drink and nice example of the bock style."
"Thanks to JonathanL7890 for this one!!"
"D - This is the perfect beer to have while sitting on the back pourch in the Texas spring worth trying sometime"
"Got this one on tap at the flying saucer, Came out in a pint glass,Poured an amber color with a 2 finger beige head. The smell was malty with a hint of bread crust. The taste was malt, bread and just a hint of honey after taste. The mouthfeel was not as light, a bit bitter in the end. But overall this beer was very very enjoyable. I hope to find this for some home consumption. A great seasonal bock to enjoy"
"Medium amber with a very faint haze and a thin cap of fine, beige bubbles. Decent head retention with a little lacing. Malty aroma, bread crust, a little buttery, toasty with mild fruit character. Restrained, balanced bitterness. Just a little fruit, malt dominates the flavour profile. Notes of sweet toasty malt, bread, and honey. Bitterness comes forward in the finish. Medium bodied with ample carbonation, fluffy texture. Pretty good stuff. Quite a drinkable bock."
"Muddy orange, brown pour with a medium yellowish tan head. Smell is slightly sour, sweet and strange, and may be coming from the yeast or perhaps its from being a bit old. Almost a teriyaki or soy smell/flavor. Taste is similar to the smell, oddly sweet, and not particularly pleasant. Didn't taste like the 2 other Heller Bocks I've had. Unusual and sort of hard to describe, but I wasn't impressed and didn't finish it. Need to rerate with a fresher bottle, probably."
"Enjoyed it."
"D - Good brew for the hop head that wants to try a bock. Will definately have at my first BBQ of the year."
"D - A very nice Texas bock, with a hint more hops that the brew from Shiner, Texas. This would be perfect watching the barbecue on a spring day."
"A decent offering by Saint Arnold's. I recommend trying this spring seasonal if you ever visit the Houston area."
"A rather enjoyable beer that I look forward to each spring."
"pours a nice amber color and has a nice creamy head. laces moderatly down the glass.has kind of a carmal taste. not to bad juat a little different but as with all saint arnolds products it was good. this is a beer i will probably buy again. this is a good beer to show up at a party with."
"Drinkability: Not a bad bock but it does have a few disconcerting flaws"
"An enjoyable beer and one of the better Bocks I've had."
"St. Arnild offers many seasonals and this is one of the brewery's good, but not necessarily great seasnal products. Still, it is worth the occasional sample and it does have enough positive qualities to recommend."
"This is a very good bock. A very good beer for the style. A whole lot more authentic than Shiner Bock, as again, this tastes like a real German bock! At first, I thought it was a tad sweet, but the hops balance this brew out very well. Very good for a nice spring evening."
"Not the best Bock but kudos to the effort; I dont see many around here. I would definitely go for another next time I have Bockish cravings."
"A solid bock, much better than the one Shiner makes. It's a beer worth trying, escpecially if you are a bock fan."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a bottled on notch (Dec 06) on the front label. Had a very small head that quickly disappeared. The color was a clear amber/copper with good carbonation. The aroma was very bready with bunch of sweet malt and a hint of caramel. The mouthfeel was standard. The taste was malty with a good hint of the alcohol in it - warms you up as you drink which surprised me since only 6.4%. It's a middle of the road beer for me - not great but not bad. Don't see a place for this in my regular rotation but worth having a single or two each year. (3.5, RB, T, O)"
"Looks golden with a little red in it. Smells of lots of flavor, light but complex - almost citrusy, can't quite put my finger on it. Tastes sweet and heavy, what I smelled came back for more. Heavier on the tongue than I would have expected, given the color, but right for a bock. Carbonated just right. I probably couldn't drink as much of this in one sitting as I want - our Texas spring is like everyone else's deep summer, I imagine this would be a lot better in a cooler evening after some hard labor in the sun."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a scant 1/4"" beige head over the clear copper brew. Head fades down to a film of small bubbles pretty quick, but with ample lacing. Aroma is a bag of grain, with plenty of fruitiness. Taste is great maltiness, the tinges of fruit in the middle, with a slightly gritty close. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is very nice. Mmm, bock."
"A nice American bock. Not something I'd seek out, but I'm glad I tried it."
"A fresh spring bock. Nice. Pours out to a medium auburn color with a small off white head of foam. Medium low level of carbonation, with some hints of lace. Aromas of fresh malts, with a very pronounced vegetal character. Taste is medium bodied and very malty; dense roasted malt, grain, spiced herbs, a touch of caramel. Mouthfeel is again medium bodied, with some density noted on the palate. North of average drinkability. Special thanks to assurbanipaul for the sample."
"A decent bock beer and quite easy to drink."
"St. Arnold wins again."
"I drank this at in the box outside my door temp ~ 50F. Into my Troegenator mug I gave it a stiff pour which produced a heady beer with a nice amber shine body. Smells like a very light cream caramel with a touch of citrus spice. Beautiful taste very delicate but sure, sticky malt but thin enough with just enough alcohol to make sure it is not cloy. Great mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Opinion: Well...this is a pretty drinkable beer, but it is severely lacking to be considered a Bock. There needs to be a bunch more toastiness along with some Melanoidin presence. This beer is closer to an Oktoberfest as it is a Bock in my opinion. It still lacks the malt presence for an OFest also, but that style is closer. This is a clean and well-crafted beer, but closer to the Dark Lager category than it is in the Bock category. Oh well...maybe next year it will shape up. We have had better years of this style."
"This is a really good beer by a really good label. st. arnold out of houston. it has a really nice color, mainly redish amber. it has a little head on it, not much, but ok. the flavor is very complex, and it has hints of strawberry or raspberry or some fruity flavor to it, which i'm not used to. its an entirely different beer, so get ready. not the most drinkable beer in the world, but really good overall."
"D - The drinkability is above average."
"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"a Texas Bock."
"Pours with a frothy amber colored head that sits atop a orange-amber colored beer. The aroma has notes of caramel and a sweet concentrated, fruity maltiness that I associate with strong Lagers and notes of toasted malt. The taste is sweet up front with a rich malty finish that almost has a meatiness to it. I get notes of bergamot in this beer, though it seems to be a mix of the maltiness and perhaps the subtle hopping. This beer has a medium full body to it that coats the mouth with sweet malt notes. The finish has a bit of bitterness as well as an astringency that is a mix of toasted malts and a tannic like drying. Definitely interesting and tasty, though it could use a bit more oomph."
"Notes: Again, great summer beer and a very nice alternative to the macros that are often consumed in the sweltering Texas summer heat eventhough it's a ""spring bock""."
"Raised in south Texas, he works hard and plays hard. He wanted little of this bock. At least its better than Shiner Bock."
"Mouthfeel is not too heavy, very clean, easily sessionable. Not anywhere near the Salvator class of doppels but not bad for a local craft attempt at a bock. Dare I say it but I much prefer this to a Shiner, it's intended competition and market in this area of the country."
"This beer reminds me a lot of Abita Amber which I most recently consumed about a week ago. Spring Bock's appearance is caramel amber in color with the usual slight head featured in Saint Arnold beers. The aroma is of sweet bready malts and a touch of grain. Taste is malty sweet, almost a little sugary, mainly of caramel malts. Overall, I find this to be a very drinkable, but not quite rich or complex enough."
"Comments - My poor luck with Saint Arnold's continues. Goes fairly well with cajun spicy pork and garlic roasted tomoatoes, with spicy carrots on the side."
"Exceptionally drinkable. The first one was down before I even realized it. I'll buy this one again for sure. Saint Arnold's produces a good lineup of brews, and the Spring Bock is a great reflection of their ability to craft quality beers at affordable price points. Good show."
"The copper color is good for its style. The head is lacking. As it pours, it appears to be low on carbonation (even less than its style). The smell brightens the senses and wants to make up for the lackluster carbonation. The first taste is a very good malty sweetness. As it swishes in the mouth one gets the hint of hops. After a couple of minutes, the taste becomes dominated by caramel. As it warms even more, caramel and almost a buttery taste takes over. This makes the drinkability rather disappointing considering the decline in taste is quite rapid."
"This is not a bad beer but is nothing memorable. It is sweet thin and not very balanced. I want a truly good Amercian Bock."
"Pours a carmel/red color, with a small creamy tan head. Smell is carmely and malty, with hints of brown sugar. Taste is supersweet with brown sugar and carmel flavors. Slight roasted quality and a hint of alcohol are also present in the flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, perfect carbonation that seems to sit in the background. Drinkability is good, I could down quite a few of these. A very good beer from a brewer that I have never heard of until a week ago, but I now respect each of their offerings. Thanks aain assurbanipaul for the Texas sized trade. (even though I hate the ""Texas-Sized"" cliche)"
"Sampled from bottle. Pours a crystal clear chestnut brown with a thin, scattered, off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is mild roasted malts and is, for the lack of a better word, clean. Flavor is somewhat bitter for a bock (yeah!) and the roasted/toasty flavors of the caramelized european malts are truly special because the flavors are layered, and not one-dimensional: a complex malt flavor with just a hint of a spicy hop flavor addition. Medium to full-bodied and smooth as glass. A hint of alcohol presence takes a bit away from the mouthfeel, but this is easy drinking. If you are in Texas, home to both Shiner Bock and St. Arnolds, do yourself a favor and pick up the St. Arnolds Bock over the Shiner. You'll be glad you did."
"I haven't sampled too many bocks so I don't have a lot to go on as far as comparisions. However, if all spring bocks are like this one, I'll be drinking a heck of a lot more of them! This is truly a nice beer. Thanks again to HardTarget."
"Beautiful deep amber color. Dark tan head that dies quickly to a lasting lace. Slightly metallic smell (?). And then... It tastes... It tastes... Well... Big and malty. Fruity - but, hmm, what fruit? Not a zesty citrus - something more reserved. (sip) A nice, ripe red delicious apple. A wee bit earthy. Lingering malty taste and feel. Ah, a touch of the butterscotchy diacetyl, perhaps? A fine beer - pour me another, barkeep!"
"The small, noisy, yellowish-tan head dies fast. Leaves no lacing. The beer is clear and dark red-amber (almost amber-red). Peanuts in the nose and some fruit. Taste is fruity, dark, nutty, then thick, buttery, very dark malty, then strongly buttery, bitter, alcoholic. Grapes burps. It's pretty good: flavorful. It's not sweet at all... almost sour in its lack of sweetness. Plenty of nice flavors, though."
"Overall Impression: While others have stated that this isn’t their best brew, I think that says more for the quality of their other offerings. I found this quite enjoyable and drinkable. It’s heavy enough for one to scratch my beer itch, but I’ll be bock for more (sorry). Recommended."
"Seems a little thin for a true bock, yet it had a great balance of malt & hop taste. Its pretty easy to drink too. I put down a pint in about less than a minute. I'll probably buy a sixer every spring."
"Pours a bright amber color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates into a trace amount of lace. Nose is lightly toasted sweet malts, light caramel, and wet wood. Light to medium in body with a nice crispness. Taste is a bit fruity with some sweet caramel notes that are nicely balanced by some bitter hops. This is a decent and refreshing brew, but it is not one of my favorite offerings from Saint Arnold Brewing."
