"It seems overall Bocks receive no due.  By general standards of a Bock, this brew is finely crafted.  I don't partake in many Bocks but on this 56*F day in Chicago this fits well.  But might I add that this is quenchable enough to session on a summer night."

"O - Not as sweet as the nose suggested to me, but overall a very good beer from New Glarus.  Taste is very straightforward.  This would be a beer that I could drink on a mid-range temperature day with ease.  3.75/5"
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, moderate-high carbonation.  No alcohol, dissipating finish. (4.00)"

"Thanks, WI-Beer-Man, for the opportunity"

"a mild carbonation but really lacking in a rich bock taste.  Failed to meet my expectations."

"A very well-made bock. A smooth, well-balanced, tasty lager!"
""

"O- Not quite in the outstanding territory, but it's a good beer with some enjoyable qualities. It'd be easy to kill a sixer of these."

"O - While New Glarus' Back 40 is a drinkable bock to be sure, it just seems to be lacking something; its somewhat transparent flavor and thin feel don't stand up to their Uff-da bock, a crown jewel for the style which begs the question, ""why"" for Back 40."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Solid, well executed example of a bock. No surprise here, are you surprised?"
"Overall: Just more awesomely executed beer from New Glarus. I feel like a broken record saying this but they do all their styles so well. This one is a touch single dimensional on the sweetness side but that's getting nitpicky. No doubt worth a try."

"From a sampler pack a friend brought across the border! Gorgeous dark caramel color, smooth drinker that goes down without a fight and leaves several distinct levels of lacing behind. Don't be deceived by the color on this one, it is certainly session-able! An absolute must for any lager-lover who is lucky enough to have access to it."

"Back Forty is an all around well made bock. It's easy drinking, shows a touch of spice with bread galore and a dry finish. I could see myself picking this up again in the future and I suggest you give it a try as well if you're into the style."
"All around, not a bad beer. I picked it up in a variety pack. I'm not sure I would go out of my way to find this one, though."
"It pours beautifully, with a full head, but that's where it ends for me. A bock should be full and strong, and this is weak and mild, and very sweet. A lot of what New Glarus does, to me, is just Spotted Cow with a twist. And I am not a fan of Spotted Cow."

"The beer pours a dark brown color with copper edges and is mostly clear with a tight off white head. Nose is toasted grain, sweet malt, and brown sugar. Taste has less grain and a hint musky, a bit sweet, brown sugar, stronger carb, flavors get a hint muted."

"Even as I like the malty-rich character of Back 40, I find its one-dimensional sweetness unable to balance with any melanoidin character within the beer. Unable to finish drier, and unable to deliver more complex malt taste both limit the beer's more favorable finishes."
"Overall, if you like Bock beer you'll love this. It's a great, easy drinking beer, would be great with some barbecued ribs."

"Smooth caramelized malts, nutty and dry flavors, earthy witha clean aftertaste. A little watery, but thankfully not sticky sweet like some bocks. This one is lighter with traditional flavors, less sweet than Uff-Da used to be. Overall it's not bad, but not my personal favorite."

"Pours a muddy bronze color with a modest, coarse, off-white head. Aroma is fairly one-dimensional, smelling of caramel. Taste is comparable to the aroma, with a malty sweetness matched by just enough hops to lend balance. The amalgam precipitates a slight, cherry-like tartness near the back end that's the closest thing to complexity this brew has to offer. The mouthfeel is light, perky, and drinkable--probably the best thing this beer has going for it. This ultimately comes off as a safe and nondescript bock, which is less than desirable for a style I already find to be pretty underwhelming."

"Low B"

"Another solid beer from New Glarus."
"O - was hopping for better scent. not a lot there. but the velvety carmel taste is real flavorful. Nice Maibock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bubbly and thin on the tongue, but smooth. Quite lovely."
""
""
""
"O: I am more than willing to highly rate lagers (and am, in fact, happy to do so), but this one falls a bit short of the mark. Looking for more than what I got, and I do understand that it doesnâ€™t need to be a malt bomb. Still decent in a pinch, if you need it."
""
""
""
"The label does call this a ""Wisconsin Bock," but the beer tastes a lot more like a dunkel lager than a bock. There's a smooth bread dark bread crust and light caramel malt character with a mild bready aroma to match. It's a very easy drinking beer, but lacks the earthiness and occasional fruit of a bock. Yeah, it's a nice dunkel, just don't pick this up looking for a traditional bock."
""
"O- I have not had many bocks, so I can't really compare to what the best is of the style. As for the beer itself, I really enjoyed it. Nothing exceptional, but overall just a solid beer in all categories."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great, easy drinking bock. The fermentation profile adds a great fruity dimension to the beer."
""
""
""
""
"O- Very drinkable, balanced, and a little complexity. Similar to what it says on their six pack carriers, NG has a way of being ""true to style", as well."
"Very drinkable beer, but lacks the caramelization of most bocks."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid bock. Has the toasted malty flavor expected for the style."
"I don't love the bock style but this beer sure does do it well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's very flavorful without being overpowering. It is scrumptious."
""
""
""
"I had one at room temperature the other night and it was much better that way. Try it unchilled."
""
""
"O: This one deserves better reviews than it is getting to my mind."
""
""
""
"O: A solid bock, could easily knock a few of these down."

"12 oz bottle: This one pours a clear, dark caramel brown color. There was a bit of a light tan head on it that lingers awhile and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is good. Mainly a caramel malt, but also hints of some fruits, nuts and a hint of roast. The taste is good. Just a hint of sweetness in the caramel malt body. Hints of spices, fruits, and a hint of dryness in the finish. A very nice beer."
"Highly enjoyable..I normally avoid Bock at all costs, this beer is truly an exception. German brewers take note of this one."
"o - Overall a decent bock, though not my favorite from NG. Some nice sweet dark fruit in the taste, though it was missing in the nose, and a bit too thin of a body for me. Would try it again."

"My overall impression of Back 40 improves over time; swirling out some of the carbonation makes the beer easier to drink and as the beer warms, some of the roughish aspects are lessened."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: I believe this is the perfect body for a bock. It is pretty much medium, but not too crisp and not too heavy. Good aftertaste and coating. By far the best part of this beer."
""
"This beer pours a light bodied deep mahogany with a one finger off white head. The nose is typical of a bock, slightly sweet malt with a slight nuttiness. The flavors are initially slightly sweet but finish dry and malty. It's on par for the style. It drinks light and somewhat dry. It's ok."
""
"This poured out as a nice looking dark brown color with a cream colored head on top. The smell of this beer was really quite nice, the aromas of dark malts and bready yeast with some dark fruits in there too. A unique nose on this beer for sure. The taste of the beer wasn't as impressive as I had hoped for. The flavors seemed a little on the muted side, nothing really popped, there were some lager yeast-like flavors in there and mostly a dull dark malt base. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it was medium bodied with decent amount of bubbles to it. Overall I felt that this beer just needed some additional malts or something to boost the sweetness of the beer just a bit. Other than that I thought it was pretty good."
""
""
"Beer is fine, I like it, medium to light in body, sweet but not overly sweet, a decent finish on the whole thing, enjoyable but not overly sweet or dry on the finihs. I'd have it again."
"Pours a medium caramel color with a short white head and some nice lacing on the way down. The nose brings some very faint hops and a bit of bready plus a touch of caramel. Flavor is pretty similar. Body is medium with good carbonation and a semi-dry finish; just a touch of sweetness comes through. Not bad for an American Bock."
"The beer appears a clear, light caramel shade of brown with over an inch of dense, off white. Excellent head retention and ample lacing. The aroma offers brown bread, malt, a faint hint of alcohol. Light in body. Simple and easy to drink. Not complex, per se but enjoyable and sessionable. A good pairing with brats and sauerkraut. I would have this again."
""
""
"O- Easy drinking beer and really brings out the toasted flavored malts without going overboard. Would certainly pick this beer up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a quality bock. Next to Uff-da itâ€™s a bit simple, but good for what it is supposed to be. To use the well-worn BA addage: Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A sufficient bock."
""
""
""
"D-This one is a little disappointing for me; I'm left wanting more body and a bigger malt profile."
""
"Appears a transparent dark brown with reddish highlights, sporting a foamy collar that lasts for about a minute, no lacing. Smells of semi-toasted malts, brown sugar, nougat, bread, and toffee, in descending order of strength. The flavor follows the nose's presentation almost in perfect lockstep... Hops present only as a floral garnish on the nose and as earthy tones in the mid sip. Medium-light body, clean finish, carbonated appropriately."
""
"O: I really love bocks. They are so easy to drink with smooth, caramel notes. This is also a great beer and style to bring women into craft beer. Just have to convince them to try it."
""
""
"O - a nice thirst quencher, but not much in other departments unfortunately.. this looked a lot better than it was which surprises me from new glarus."
"Serving type: Bottle poured into Celebrator tulip/chalice"
"The beer pours a dark copper to brown color with a fine head that clung to glass. The aroma is malty, bready, laced with caramel and fruit. Smooth and malty across the palate. Lots of good malty action in the flavor. Bready, grainy, with a dash of sweetness, this is a well flavored beer. A nicely made, clean bock."
""
""
""
"O: A very nice beer. Very well balanced and smooth beyond belief, making this one a dangerously easy drinker."
""
"Thanks to Crass3000 for this one!"
"I was given a bottle of the Back 40 from my boss in a trade of beers. The beer poured a brownish clear amber with thin slightly off white head that left a nice lace on my glass. The smell included rich sweet malt. The taste was a nice malt start with good sweet tones that turned slightly bitter towards then end from the hops. The mouthfeel is a nice medium body beer with good carbonation. Overall this is another great creation by New Glarus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great drinking beer that went down exceptionally smooth. Not my favorite style but I would gladly drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- This is truly a traditional Bock -- more so than Uff-da, but it also seems just a little lackluster overall. I'm trying to harken back to my early days of hunting down Rhinelander Bock each spring to see if this reminds me of that sort of beer, but it's just not as exciting. Overall, this is a good drinker and goes down easy, but it just seems a bit lacking. I might have to revisit on another day."

"A nice simple domestic rendition of the style..."

"O) This was a nice late fall selection. Decent transition brew to your winter warmers. A little lighter fair than NG's Uff Da, but just as enjoyable."
"O: Very drinkable. Great for a tailgate, which was the original purpose of this guy."
"overall, not my favorite bock from new glarus. I think this one really pales in comparison to the uff-da. a nice easy drinking bock, but nothing in the way of complexity or depth"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with quite a punchy carbonation. Almost a bit too bubbly for me but it still goes down nicely. Overall, just a solid bock from New Glarus and I'm not surprised as they've brewed plenty of great bock's in the past!"
"Overall, I enjoyed this brew and can only hope to sample more from this brewer."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I definitely need to get a six-pack of this the next time it is in season. Very good stuff. If it is this good on an 85Âº summer night, I bet it is excellent when there is a nice chill in the air."
"The aroma was your classic malty bock. Nice sweet caramel and nutty aromas mixed in with a good earthy tone. The flavor followed through very closely with a nice bitter malty flavor and a good amount of sweetness in it as well. Carbonation that is more then decent never let it go flat and kept you entertained throughout the session. Easily a sessionable beer, as I could have thrown down more then one."
"Aromas of green apple, grass and dark bread. A hint of brown sugar. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel introduces a sharp cider crispness. Subtle sweet maltiness follows with suggestions of brown sugar and biscuit. Mild hopping balances out the taste profile. Bright effervescence throughout the session. Dry finish with a puckering tartness. Overall, Back Forty is a highly sessionable Bock with a robust malt character that's worth exploring."
"O: Goes down alright, somewhat tasty, not filling, mild kick, ok representation of style. This was cool to try but not one that I would seek out."
"Pours a muddied chestnut brown with a frothy two fingers of foam leaving nice lace retention. The nose contains rich bready malts, a strong grassy herbal hop scent with almost a slight sour roasted chocolate note. The taste has dry chocolate malt upfront with the slightest sour hint. Finishes with dark cacao at the end along with hay. Refreshing if not a bit thin - a hearty sessionable beer, not bad at all."
"Pours a nice nutty brown with white lace on the side of the glass. Smells a bit toasty and nutty. First taste is of malty bready goodness that just keeps you drinking more and more. Finishes a bit nutty as well. did i say nutty?? lol This is a great brew. Definitely something I could drink for a few hours with the boys. Highly recommended"
"Poured into my goddamn Aventinus glass and the beer is a medium brown with a large off-white head. Lots of lace and great head retention. Fairly clear overall. Smell is quite malty like a Bock should be with some breadiness. Taste is very similar, but more subdued which is a surprise. Quite clean in flavor and finish. Appropriately carbonated with a medium body. I could drink several of these in a sitting and be quite satisfied. A solid Bock from New Glarus."
"O: A solid representation of the style the whole way through, Back 40 Bock is highly sessionable and really easy to drink. Body is a bit thin but its still crisp and refreshing. Another above average beer from New Glarus."
"Overall a tasty, drinkable beer, and surely underrated. Don't take it for granted..."
"Pretty weak overall, I'd expect better from NG."
"O: Decent, nice malts, nothing too special, little syrupy, decent hops, nutty, tasty, nice dark wheats."
"D: Not impressed. Wheres the body? Has little to no bulk at all. Could pass as a standard brown ale really."
"Slightly hazed mahogany body. Thin off white head leaves sporadic patches of lace. Weak maltiness on the nose with allusions to adjuncts. Body is about medium. Moderate amounts of carbonation. Very easy going beer without a lot of malt depth or richness. It's just kind of there. Maybe a good crossover bock for the macro crowd, but this pales in comparison to the Uff Da Bock, which is exceptional IMHO."
"Kind of a light weight bock/dark lager offering. Dark copper colored...disappointed in the clarity...a bit hazy...somewhat nutty in flavor with some bready notes...but overall not a lot of strong malt flavors expected. Drinks fine but something I'd more expect to experience wearing a Leinie label....actually I think I prefer their 1888 Bock to this..run of the mill and another NG beer that seems dumbed down for the masses (like their Honey Bock)."
"O: An average bock with decent aromas and flavors."
"Overall - I like my bock a little richer than this. Not a bad beer, but not one I'd pick from the New Glarus stable."
"Solid, good bock that one could easily be taking down by the twos & threes on the patio in the springtime. Nice addition to the New Glarus line, & one I'd consider for kicking back."
"This beer poured a black color, with very small head. The smell was rich, and malt, and had a doughy oder to it. The taste was full, and had a doughy malty like flavor. Nice feel tot he beer, easy to drink as well. Overall a very nice bock, would get this one again."
"D: Overall, this is a pretty good example of the style. Even though this isn't my favorite style, I'd probably order it if I saw it on draft."
"The head graces the glass with a random patchy pattern of lace; muddled brown color shows some chill haze. Fresh-cut hay, ripe apple orchard and fresh-baked dark bread fills the nose. Lagered smoothness unleashes a re- freshing crispness in the medium body. Sweet, toasted, bready maltiness is the tune this brew is singing, a broad reach from caramel to toasted pie crust to biscuits. Modest hopping stretches far enough to balance and leaves some oily herbal flavor in the drying, malty end. ""Wow"" comes to mind; extremely drinkable with a tightly packed, toasted character that unfolds with each sip. A good hunt for any true lager lover out there."
"D= Pretty insanely drinkable, but then it is only 5.5% abv. Would be a perfect beer to pair with food. I could easily see myself killing a six pack of this at a summer cookout..."
"This beer has a beautiful pour; two fingers of head that slowly deflate, leaving thick lacing on the glass. Smells sweet and of brown spices, cinnamon or nutmeg. The taste is crisp, sweet and creamy. Caramel and mild spices mixed with something leafy and fresh."
"D: This is very drinkable, but not anything I would go searching for. There's just nothing special about this beer. It's a bit tasteless. I love New Glarus beers, but this one just doesn't cut it. I do know a lot of other people like it though, so go try it out for yourself!"
"Final impression - Lacks aroma and flavor. This is the stuff that makes alcoholics."
"Drink ability is decent: Overall an above average Bock, but doesn't wow on any fronts."
"Pours a nice burnt sienna with a pillowy mocha-like head of foam. Doesn't appear to be highly carbonated. Head disapates quickly to leave a touch of lace. Smell is of lightly toasted bread, malt sweetness, and a touch of yeasty goodness. Flavor seems to vary with hints of prune and bran cereal. Touch of sweetness rounds out the flavor profile. For a 5% beer this is packed with flavor that gets a bit tiring on my pallete, but is still a great beer as winter turns to spring."
"Drink this is one you will take large drinks of and you will want more than one."
"a bit flat in the feel. Low abv makes it drinkable but I think takes away some of the feel."
"Drinkability - I like it OK but it isn't something I'd anxiously await to come out as a seasonal release."
"D - Tastes like warm, homemade bread - in a good way. Very comforting and soothing after a long day. The drier finish and restrained flavors makes this a good candidate for someone to try who doesn't think they like bock beers. Well done."
"d- This beer I could see on a draft list and not feel that it is anything special. The beer is competely and utterly average in my opinion. Not bad, but not good. And this is coming from a guy that considers New Glarus one of my favorite breweriess."
"D - This is a decent bock, but there are better out there. Very sessionable. You could stock a sixer as a regular drinker. Probably not as good as the Uff Da but it is tasty."
"I wish I could buy this more often. A great cheap everyday beer that would shake up the styles I usually get for that purpose."
"drinkability: fine"
"Taste is ridiculously clean, soft, fluffy, inviting. This is one of those few beers where the taste and the mouthfeel are so tightly knit that you can't really review them separately. Dark fruits and dark bready malt float on top of dry, fluffy, airy carbonation; superbly drinkable; hints of bread crust, a dash of cocoa powder, and a faintly earthy figgy note. The hops only show up in person for a flash on the fading finish, leafy and floral, preferring to spend the rest of the time providing that fantastic, dry, ultra clean, light sensation that counterbalances the malt body. Really unique. The flavor profile really is subdued, and I'd rate it lower if it wasn't so well done and didn't feel so, well, right. Top to bottom, a beautiful beer. I would by this by the case if I lived close enough."
"Not bad and quite drinkable."
"If consumed at the proper temperature, this beer has great drinkability with an appropriately clean, slightly sweet and satisfying finish."
"The beer pours a light brown color with a white head. The aroma is toffee, grass and some molasses. It smells about like a bock should. The flavor is toffee, grass and chocolate. The beer is also very dry, not sweet like a lot of bocks are. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Decent, but I expect more from New Glarus."
"Drinkability -- For the uninitiated, Wisconsin is the standard bearer of bock biers in the US, and New Glarus is the standard bearer of craft beer in Wisconsin. Somehow it just doesn't come together. A crisp, refreshing beer for certain, but there's not much flavor. Not my favorite New Glarus offering."
"D: Highly drinkable. Intriguing, but refreshing. 4.5"
"D - A real easy drinker, very sessionable"
"D: Good drinkability. Very straightforward, clean and crisp."
"Drinkability: Overall it is pretty bland and wouldn't make it difficult to stop after one."
"D: easy drinking"
"from the ODB - thanks mane"
"Solid, traditional bock beer. Served with a great, foamy, frothy, sudsy, light tan head that lasts and lots of lace. Color is a clear, dark garnet. Aroma is malt, caramel, toffee and just a hint of molasses. Flavor's the same and has the sweetness perfectly balanced. Body is just what it should be, ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of short to medium length. This is quitessential bock beer. Session."
"D: I'm hoping this is a bad bottle somehow. The beer had basically no taste. Wut??"
"D/O- Drinkability is high. A six pack of this would make for a nice fall/winter night. Low ABV keeps you wanting more. A solid, albeit not-standout offering from New Glarus."
" i'm tired of letting my own local bias and soft spot for a brewery I loved back in 03 continue to influence my perceptions. can't help but think more and more new glarus has shrewdly built a larger than reality reputation on the strength of the extreme provincialism in WI and the desire for unavailable things elsewhere. in other words, they sell to the prideful locals and boost their rep by not selling to the nonlocals. still dig their crack'd wheat and maybe a couple others, but if their beers were nationally distributed they would probably be considered a notch below BBC."
"D - easy to drink."
"D: It's an easy drinker. While this is a fine beer, I don't know if I will be searching for it."
"D: Overall another easy drinking beer from NG. Hits the style and substance for my my money."
"I didn't care for it, but my roommates gf said its good for girls and she really likes it."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into trusty shaker glass. Poured a brownish color with a decent head that lingered a bit as I sipped. Aroma of nuts, malt, and a little vanilla. Mouthfeel was decent and the taste was a little sweet nuttiness, malt, a bit of vanilla, with a mild/smooth finish. I would be more than happy to do another one or three of these. Another good one from Mr. Carey."
"pours a mahogany color with a fresh tan ring lacing clings to the glass as i drink this one.. smell is nuts and malts some toffee and baked bread..taste is sweet vienna malts mixed with roasted malts some baked bread toffee and some hops..mouth fell is medium with a sweet malt taste,,its ok drinkable @ 5.5 you can drink a few,,its good its NG"
"Mouthfeel-Medium carbonation coats the palate. A healthy malty body, but does not let any sweetness overtake it. The hops are even-keeled and provide a good balance. Similar to the aroma, this has a lager mouthfeel with an extra malt bump. A Bock at 5.5%..genius! This is satisfying and could be a bit of a winter warmer despite the lower ABV which makes no difference to me. Finishes clean. New Glarus has yet to brew anything I didn't truly love. Sessionable for a Bock. Yummy even."
"Drinks rather easily and represents the style pretty well. However, it just doesn't have a real strong presence in the nose and taste department. Worth a shot."
"Very drinkable. I don't think this was quite as good as Uff-da, but a different beer altogether. Not complex, but well-balanced and pairs well with a cold winter night."
"It's gorgeous, easy to drink, but it's not what I'm looking for from a bock, at all."
"I'm surprised this one was able to retain as much flavor for the lower ABV, worth a try."
"Pours a somewhat murky dark brown. Huge thick tan head. Malty sweet smell with a touch of maple and toffee. Used coffee grounds. The taste is slghtly sweet with more of a grainy corn flavor. I pick up something kind of like raw oatmeal. There is a clean toated malt flavor throughout. The bitterness from the hops makes the aftertaste a little fruity. I can taste a twang from the alcohol. The mouthfeel was a little thin and wet for something with this depth of flavor. Overall a decent beer. The flavor is complex and pretty well balanced. Good drinkability. It would be a good beer to warm you up on a ten degree night."
" ~ Thanks again to the crew at New Glarus. I don;t think this bock lives up to the Uff-da. That being said, Uff-da was a a much different bock."
"Easy to drink with nice mouth feel. Well done, but not my favorite style."
"Well certainly not a bad bock, the flavor leaves you wanting more. That said, this is a very easy drinking beer, and I would have no problem knocking back a few of them. Enjoyable, but this one definitely won't blow your socks off."
"Dark brown color with a reddish tint, one finger of head that slowly settled to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Mild aroma with hints of caramel, figs, and raisins. Maybe a little charcoal as well. The first sip I thought I tasted some smoke but that did not come back as I worked through the glass. The flavor is mostly caramel with some faint hints of dark fruit. The flavor is just not very interesting or complex. The body feels bigger that it is and is nicely carbonated. New Glarus gets the mouthfeel right in just about every beer. Do not understand the need to introduce this bock when they already have one of the best, Uff-da, in the portfolio. Just bring that one back. This is just average, well made, but average."
"This pours a dark brown and cloudy. The aroma is slightly sweet, of caramel and pastry with a bit of sour tart in it as well. The taste is sweet, mostly malty with a slightly sour tart finish. It drinks very light, I was expecting something a bit deeper."
"(D)- A fantastic Bock. Great flavor, balance, and feel without being too bold. A ""clean"" tasting and easy drinking bock. I still miss Uff-da, but this is quite good; easier drinking for the style."
"Overall this seems to fit what I understand a bock to be to a T. It's certainly not a dopplebock but the family traits are there, if only at a less intense level. The one extreme virtue that this seems to have is its drinkability - pretty much par for the course for New Glarus."
"Pretty nice beer overall. Not outstanding in any way, but good."
"Bring back Uff-da."
"I had high hopes that they would have replaced Uff-da with a similar tasting bock although I almost lost hope after tasting Cabin Fever. I understand why New Glarus is making these least common denominator beers but it pains me to know this was at the expense of Uff-da. A real 'Wisconsin Bock' needs some body and bold flavor."
"D - On the sweet side making me not want more than 1 in a sitting."
"This new seasonal from New Glarus is a must try for New Glarus fans. It pours a dark brown color and has that familar bock smell to it. This beer starts out with a semi strong bock taste but finishes very nicely with little after taste. Pretty smooth and nice flavor, definetly a good taste for the price."
"Overall it is a solid beer, better than other ""Wisconsin bocks"""
"Moderately low carbonation, the mouthfeel is medium bodied and nice and smooth overall. Back 40 Bock is easy to drink, with very clean malt flavors and not it's not too strong making it a nice sessionable beer for fall. Much as I suspected: not as good as Uff-Da but far tastier than Cabin Fever."
