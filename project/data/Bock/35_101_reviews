"Mildy sweet with a taste of nutmeg and cinnamon.  A great seasonal offering - perfect for a cold December evening."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - an inoffensive lager that is a good change of pace from some of the heavy hitters that craft has to offer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"very smooth winter beer. better on draft"
""
""
""
"little hint of a citrus taste. your lady will love this beer while sitting by a roaring fire."
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this out of a bottle a few days ago. It's a bit bitter, but balanced by nice malt sweetness and a fair bit of spice (cinammon maybe?) and it tastes absolutely fantastic. Pairs well with seafood, for what it's worth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep caramel brown (BEER BOTTLE) color with mild spiced malt smell. The taste is a mild malty sweetness, some ginger and other spices. A good winter beer with a light-med. body and very drinkable!"
""
""
""
""
"you can definitely taste the spices, which were pleasant but overall the flavors are a little too strong in my opinion. this is definitely a bold brew. not my favorite holiday beer but it's alright"
""
""
""
"It had a nice bock beer taste."
""

"Aesop Rock show, shit sucked ass..."
""
"Rich in flavorful Nutmeg and Ginger! Pairs great with food!"
""
"Half finger head leaves in a hurry poured into a wide mouth goblet blood orange in color  overall this is a good brew"

"Good winter lager with some citrus, malt & a hint of spice."

"Rust copper color  on pour ! More of a wheat taste than a hops taste! Drank out of a bottle. Poured into a glass head lasted about 30 sec. Bubbles semi present on pour! A good lager not all world but not every beer is"
""
""
"Overall:  This is a good winter beer.  Good balance between malt and sweet and hops.  Very drinkable."
"Smooth and creamy with a hint of cinnamon"
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  this beer looked better than it tasted, it was good but not great, I would probably not seek this one out again as there are better options available, Sam Adams makes a lot of beers but many are underwhelming."
""
""
""
"Malty with spice. One of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"  Overall, Winter Lager is a beautiful beer that sports a strong malt backbone that is well complimented by a cinnamon-like spiciness. Easy to drink and quite tasteful. I recommend."
"Scent of caramel with a little hay.  Clean, crisp with decent amount of carbonation.  Not as heavy or filling as a double bock but still some of the same rich taste with the malt dominating."
"This is good stuff.  It's got a reddish hue to it with a head on top that you have to respect.  It's a strong lager taste but with a cinnamon/ginger spice with it making it a pleasantly interesting taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice, light smooth lager just perfect for the winter months if you are looking for a beer with taste that does not fill you too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet, smooth, and delicious. If your lady likes beer this would be good for her."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light hazel color with an eggshell white head that trails the glass. The smell has bits of sweetness from the malt with some spice like nutmeg and clove coming through as well. The taste was a bit heavy with the spice and heavy characters from the malt coming through. A mainstay for the season and a very decent one at that."
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit."
"Goes down smooth, but unfortunately doesn't taste that good. Not awful, just not good."
""
""
"Pretty good beer. Has a nice spiciness that is refreshing in the cold months."
"Red cooper color with a thing head and lace.. A/T ginger and cinnamon spice, wheat and crystal malt, earthy bitterness.. Thin with low carbonation.. It is decent and I like drinking it in the samuel adams variety packs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my top five favorites."
"Love this beer, I really appreciate the taste, aroma, and drinkability of this brew. Great balance"
"Overall: A typical Sam Adams brew."
"Good seasonal lager, but seems a little light compared to  a good winter ale."
""
""
"great winter beer. delicious bock"
""
""
""
"Good seasonal beer. Wish it was around longer."
""
""
""
""
"Nice Amber colour. Superb taste."
"On draft in a frosted mug (ugh). Clean and crisp, spices are subtle and well balanced.  A good easy drinking winter beer."
""

"Looks great! Smells so so. Very average tasting beer. Just OK. Below average i think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Purchased the variety pack and poured into a Harpoon Pint Glass.  Ok the carbonation is light but makes it enjoyable.  The nose was average and nothing special.  The taste pretty much followed suit but added a little extra with some nice spiciness.  This was not overpowering it was just enough to keep it lively.  Nothing to really hold my attention or make me yearn for another one.  Overall it is a Sam Adams and usually they are all just average drinkable beers.  I hate to say that because I have just moved from Vermont and love the New England Area beers but Sam Adams just seems to produce more average brews than strong ones and this beer, Winter Lager, just happens to be one of the average ones."
""
""
""
"Overall: Classic holiday spiced lager, very drinkable, great color and a nice change to the usual ales I consume."
""
""
""
""
"Edit: I actually had a holiday party, and found that I ended up drinking a lot of these myself. I kept coming back to it for the smooth, easy drinkabiIity and pleasant flavors. I've revised the score up a little to reflect the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed it and have developed an appreciation for for this subtle spiced lager. Perhaps I will seek it out again after all!"

"Best winter lager in my opinion! In fact, my favorite winter beer and something I just need to have during the christmas time. Dark copper color, very fruity almost lemon smell and something resembling Hefe wheat beers. Average carbonaton, light foam. Taste is very fruity with mild hops, very ale'ish in fact and not lager. Bit sweet, a hint of Hefe here too. Just terrific product in my opinion!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh. Meh meh meh meh."
""
"Solid seasonal offering by Sam Adams. Look is nice - an amber brown with clarity. Smells lagery with a hint of wheat. Taste is like an amber ale with a little hint if winter flavor. You get a tad of the wheat on the tongue. Feels like a good refreshing lager that isn't watered down. Overall I prefer some of Sam's other offerings but this is good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly dark red, smells of pleasant Christmas spices. Cinnamon and nutmeg. Smooth drinking.   Yum"
"Good stuff, can'r wait until next winter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very nice beer, overall. It pours nicely and behaves like I would expect a Sam Adams beer to behave. The head hangs around, the carbonation is steady, and it smells of biscuity caramel malt. There are hints of nutmeg and orange that wrap around the caramel and cola to produce a very pleasant combination."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Copper brown in color with excellent clarity.  A fingernail of beige colored foam covers the majority of the top.  Light aromas of caramel and dark malt are in the aroma.  The flavor is subtle caramel and dark malt.  The body is smooth and gentle."
""
"Not a bad seasional brew. A lil bit of orange with a pinch of spice. Not hateful at all."
""
""
"Pours a brown color with a redish tint about two fingers of foam and leaves no lace. Aroma is coriander, orange, and maybe a hint of nutmeg but is not overwhelming with aroma very subtle. Taste is very much like the nose, but bread, some orange and spices. However flavor is subtle as well."

"O:  A very mediocre beer.  Some good notes, but I will not be having it again."
""
""
""
"O- Not a bad winter beer, but didn't wow me.  I am enjoying it and wouldn't pass it if it was offered to me, but I would buy it at a store."
""

"O: the harshness at the finish is a turn off for me;"

"O: Samuel Adams is generally my go to for non-craft brews. It's almost universally carried, isn't overly expensive, and most beers are above average. The winter lager isn't generally a favorite of mine but it isn't a bad beer. It's exceptionally average in many regards while being above in a few. There is a pretty nice balance in the flavor of malt and hops, which is a staple of the Bock style and the highlight of the drink. Not their best brew in my opinion, but a worthy bock and a decent holiday staple."

"Pours a nice copper tone with a thick head. Head settles into a creamy off white and foamy lace that displayed excellent retention. The aroma is quite strong which bothers me somewhat. Very grainy smell with a slight element of not fresh bread or vegetables that for me is slightly off putting. Upon first tasting, the flavor reflected the aroma. However, the taste develops into a pleasant blend of earthy spices, grainy malt and smooth finish. Feel is medium bodes with light carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer to enjoy in the winter, but not my favorite."

"My favorite installation from Jim Koch and the boys at Sam Adams. It's a solid, spiced treat I keep on hand all winter long."

"Overall not a bad beer. It borders the line between a quick beer and a slow beer. I'm sure I could chug it if I wanted to. Not the best beer I've had, but not the worst by far."
""
""
""
""
"Nice, well-balanced, flavorful winter holiday beer.  I used to drink this a lot, and then became tired of it and took a break for a couple of years.  Just had one this weekend and remembered why I used to drink it a lot.  Nice spice, but not overdone.  Enjoyable and sessionable."
""
""
"Overall: I'd throw this above Shiner and the other Texas bocks, but below Anchor's and more serious beers. However, given that this was from the convenience store on the other side of my block, I'm more than happy about it. Sam Adams always seems like a family reunion beer to me, but this one's alright."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ginger, cinnamon, toasted, nutty malt, caramel, and a hint of orange peel form the aroma. Spices are subtle, in comparison to the melanoidin character. Flavor reveals fruity specialty malt and orange at the base, with notes of cinnamon and ginger weaving throughout. The finish is slightly bitter. Orange dominates, overwhelming the bock notes. The spices are fairly subtle, but ginger emerges in the aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Bottle from the 12 pack Pours a slightly hazy brown amber color with a decent off white head that persists for a while leaving spotty lace on the sides. Aromas of cinnamon and citrus with a caramel brown sugary malt to back it up. The flavor is rich and dark sugary malts with a spicy citrusy bite to counter. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. I’ve had this many times in the past and its never been my favorite, but today with a grilled cheese and some cracked pepper chips it just worked."

"ar around greater boston area. They are definitely an illegal pay for play participant. They are the big players In MA. Budlight is not considered a beer here. So much is expected of Sam adams, but they are always the sucky beer, avoid them and always go for real local beer, that i am not going to mention here, you have to try to taste yourselves."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its a good beer smoth finish that you would expect from Samuel Adams brand with a nice hardy taste but not reals heavy leaving room for one more"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with a small, light brown head. Is dark amber in color. Has aromas of orange peel, malts, and hops. Initial taste is sweet from a balance of malts, hops, and the brewed orange peels. The finishing taste is created from the persistence of the orange peels combined with cinnamon and  a hint of ginger. Seems like it would be a great beer to drink next to the fireplace on a cold day."

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall:  I'm going to agree with the Adjunct Hippie on this one.  The Winter Lager is fairly decent, but it's not a bock.  I liked it better at the beginning than toward the end.  I wouldn't turn one down if it was offered to me, and I might seek it out in a situation where the only alternatives are Bud Light and other weak AALs."

"I poured this beer from a bottle into a pint glass. It has a nice foamy head that dissipates into a good lacing. The color is dark and reminds me of cola a bit. As for taste, very strong hops, with a bit of spice.  The mouthfeel is smooth. Overall, I find this beer drinkable, but I much prefer the regular Boston Lager. I don't generally like bock beers. I don't think I'll buy it again."

"Edit : I see that this is a Bock. It is absolutely nothing like a Bock. I would knock the rating down but it's too good to do that. Approach it like a Bock and you'll probably be sorely disappointed. Approach it like a winter beer and you'll be jumping rope."

"Pours a nice dark amber in color with a thin off-white head. A good amount of acing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of caramel malts with a few spices. The taste of the caramel malts comes right though with some toffee, cinnamon and nutmeg in the mix as well. Very tasty with perfect carbonation. Medium-bodied. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. A tasty brew for the cooler months."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a one finger light tan head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of mild caramel malt, slight holiday spicing. Flavor of sweet caramel malt, mild toffee, light cinnamon, finishes with caramel malt and light grassy hops. Medium bodied with a hint of creaminess. A pleasant light bock style beer with an appropriately mild holiday spicing. Is as I expect from Boston Beer, a nicely made, mellow ale that doesn't push the envelope, but is a satisfactory and enjoyable example of its style."
"*Following my last gulp the empty glass smelled just like a ginger bread cookie. It reminded me of some childhood memories. This was by far the highlight of this beer for me"
""
""
"Overall: This is a decent straight-up bock. There are better bocks, and better winter seasonals, on the market. I had this with a homemade pizza and some roasted vegetables, and it didn't fail to compliment the meal, but it didn't add much either. This is the kind of beer I would only get again if it was the only thing on draft that wasn't a BMC lager or a light beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"I'm a SA fan and have had a dozen of their brews, this is my least favorite, just not enough there. Easy to drink but the sour finish is a turn off for me. Taste like a honey lager...where is the winter spices? Not terrible but I won't be buying again, to many other great winter brews to choose from."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-easy drinking, but flavor is not overly compelling"
""
"Overall: Still my favorite seasonal from Sam Adams (excluding two times, first when double bock was seasonal, and then when noble pils was seasonal). Not the most special anymore, but I still enjoy it. It is a pretty solid brew, a little bit of a pumped up version of Boston Lager."
"This is very drinkable. Neither the smell nor the drink blows me away, but together I could find myself drinking this all the time. The main things I gather are malt, honey, and spices. I will get this again next winter out of habit of course."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours red orange with a nice one finger slightly off white head. Smells of winter spices and slight berry, nice compliment to the malt tones. Tastes of some dark roasted malts with fruity tones such as berries, with very slight wintertime spice. Beer is carbonated nicely light body, sessionable. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really good beer. Perhaps not what I would pin as great spice beer or bock for that matter ,its a very drinkable and nice lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark amber color with a great creamy head and mild carbonation. Fruity, spiced aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma with more depth and malt. The carbonation is more noticeable than it appears. Maybe a bit too crisp...not bad but. Slightly sweet. Finishes a bit maltier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid winter bock."
""
"Just like the name implies, this is a tasty beer for cooler weather. Brings to mind winter holidays, sitting in front of a fireplace. Easy drinking, strong taste and aroma - cinnamon and spice, mostly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's about what I'd expect from a standard beer from SA; to-style, well-made, but relatively boring. But, it's a fine tasty beer that would be great with a meal, for cooking, or alone. I think I might actually save this one as an idea to help bridge macro drinkers into craft (isn't that so often the domain of Sam Adams...)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent, I used to like this a lot but it just isnt my kinda beer these days, still I like the cherry in it though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Even with low expectations, this Beer dissapointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a good, easy drinking winter brew. It's like a cute little nephew to the German weizenbocks."
""
""
"EBD 6/14. Pours a medium amber with a nice ruby hue. Solid head with a well formed lacing. Nose is of sweet malt with a bit of spice. Light medium bodied, normal carbonation and mouthfeel. The taste is quite interesting and well balanced. It has a slight sweetness over a soft spice background. Crisp finish with a carbonation burst of slight bitterness and spice. A very well done lager."

"Big fan of this one. Smells of cinnamon and nutmeg with hits of citrus. The taste is a pleasant mixture of the spices and citrus with a slightly bitter after taste. I really enjoyed this one although doesn't really remind me that much of winter more of a fall beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Maybe my favorite offering from Boston Beer Co. Yeah, so I feel that it is more of a fall beer than that of winter. So what. Still a damn fine brew that gets the job done in January."
""
"On tap at one of the bars in Denver International Airport. Dark amber color, almost brown. Aroma is malty, not much hint of spice. Flavor is a nice malty lager with just a touch of spice. Overall not a bad beer at all, I need to start giving more Sam Adams beers a chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Samuel Adams Winter Lager is one of my winter favourites. Its a very full bodied and bold beer by any standards. Rather complex and filling but more willing to let you have another after another. I've had Sam Adams Winter Lager in a bottle, can, and on tap. Honestly there's no difference in taste other than the can is a wee bit more foamy like other Sam Adams cans available. The appearance is more of a dark brownish black like most bock beers and dark lagers. Looks imitating at first to most light beer drinkers but its easy to get used to. Smellwise its more of a full bodied smell with a bit of ginger in there. Tastewise its a rather complex beer without being too pretentious in itself. Very full and bold with some ginger and spices that aren't easily obvious. In the mouth Sam Adams Winter Lager is very tame and smooth. Very odd for a full Bock Lager like as such really. Overall Samuel Adams Winter Lager is probably the best winter beer available in my opinion. I mean I do like Harpoon's, Narragensetts, or Long Trails offerings but Sams Winter Lager will always be a winter favourite. Even though I prefer Octoberfest but Winter is a close second."

"O - Really not half bad. It does have s good flavor especially if you are in to malty beers. Its not overpowering. Very drinkable."
""
"Poured with a half finger head that dissipates quickly. Color is quite nice, a clear dark amber/light ruby Not too much of a nose to it, malt with a touch of spice and a slight citrus hop aroma. Beer itself tastes about the same. Malty, get a touch of cinnamon and residue bite from the ginger, then hops which aren't very heavy. Feels a little thin in the mouth, like something the should be for thirst quenching in the summer. Pretty good overall, one of the better Sam seasonals I've had, wouldn't turn one down."
""

"Overall this lager fits well into the winter scene with its pleasant dose of spice. Always pick this one up in the winter as its well priced for its flavor."

"o: nothing too complex here, but its smooth and drinks nice. i like the heavier mouthfeel presented here combined with the caramel. its nice for drinking when you want something descent but don't want to concentrate too hard on picking out all the flavors"

"This is a decent bock and well worth the 7.50 a six pack purchase price."
""
"This is the 7th Sam I've had. Pretty strong medicine. Big flavor, a smoky wheat bock. Nice spicy flavor to it, but you can taste the booze too. Nice dark brownish color with a potent nose. Relatively little head. One of Sams better seasonals, always like to grab some in their winter mix pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very minimal head upon pouring. Nice dark slightly reddish appearance. Like most SA brews, this one is easy to drink. Not too heavy and actually very light for a bock. Can't really get any kind of specific aroma so I guess they were able to achieve a nice balance of all the spices. Nothing to special for me but easy to drink."

"Overall: A solid lager but not much more than that. I personally feel it could have been better balanced or even leaned more heavily on the spices to create something a little more ""winterish"". The orange peel seemed the dominant addition and I thought cinnamon and ginger would have made better stars for a winter lager."

"Diamonds are forever."
"Very nice color. Dark brown with a reddish tint. Less than a finger of head. Not a very significant scent, light orange peel. Taste is great. Extremely smooth, again the orange peel comes through. Mouthfeel is also great, perfectly carbonated. Overall: definitely something I could drink more of."
""
""
""
""
"The first thing that strikes me about this beer is the deep reddish brown color it has when you pour it into a glass. You can taste noble hops which is the hops sam adams puts in a lot of their beers. I love how you can taste the orange and cinnamon with every sip that you take. Delicious beer, perfect for a nice cold day."

"O: I don't know if its worth the 1 minute commercial Samuel Adam's give this beer, but hey, its really not a bad beer at all. Its a little thin in aroma and lacking complexity but its quite drinkable by anyone's standers. this could hardly offend a valley girl who's palate is used to nothing but White fn Zin. psych I went way too far.

"O - This is a rock solid effort by BBC - a Sam Adams lager I enjoy and would not mind having again."
"You know, this is probably my least favorite of the Sam Adams seasonals. I would drink it if it's the only craft option, but beyond that, there are much better options. Price like most SA beers is really good, so that's a plus."

"Snagged a six-pack from the same place I found the superlative Lagunitas Little Sumpin' (see that review). I am a big advocate of Boston Lager and like this brewery well enough, gimmicks like ""chocolate cherry porter"" notwithstanding. Why does everyone have to murder porter with all kinds of additives and random flavorings like chai spices and sock lint? Its not already an interesting style? Its kinda like how a beer is magically made ""wintery"" by chucking in some spices. Bock is already supposed to be pretty hearty and rich. Ahem. I digress. This winter bock pours a rather pretty red-orange amber color, with around three fingers of light tan foam and a pleasant aroma of mellow rich dark malts, caramel, molasses, a little sour dark fruit like sultanas. Nice but the whole aroma is downplayed, like great song on the radio that you want to crank up but the volume knob is unfortunately busted. Taste is similar, with some toasty bread crusts, biscuits, barley-based coffee substitute and crackers, subdued caramel and molasses as per the nose, and candied plums along with herbal/spicy hop notes. Some would have the cinnamon, ginger, and orange peel spice addition amped up. I respectfully disagree. This is actually an example of skilled spice use in brewing, the spices provide a background warmth and some aromatics but not at the expense of everything else. I get a little sulphur on the nose and perhaps the palate as well, maybe a hint of DMS, but at expected levels for a lager and these components add complexity without being nasty. Fairly light body but semi-chewy nonetheless and the finish is quite nice: The malts stick around, there's some hop leaf and a floral sweet spice like licorice tablets. Has some of the sweet and sour character of old world porters. This beer used to be higher ABV and more flavorful (or so I read, wasn't into beer back then), too bad its been neutered a bit because its pretty good now and must have been even better ""back in the day"". Compare it to Anchor Bock, which has bolder flavors but perhaps less complexity."
""
""
"Overall: Not half bad. Personally, this could very well fall under the ""brown ale"" style but hey, I don't make those sort of calls. A tad more spice could not hurt. Great to enjoy on a cold night. A pinch too sweet to make this a session beer. Worth trying but is low on my list of must-have winter seasonals."

"O - Not a bad beer. Definitely a holiday brew. I wouldn't buy a twelve pack of just the Winter Lager, but still decent."

"What a pleasant brew! This was poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The appearance was remarkable with a deep caramel color, almost like a fine cognac. The head doesn't stick around long and their isn't much lacing but not a big deal. The scent is a lot like the taste, very balanced with very very light citrus and some other spices which Sam Adams claims cinnamon among, although it isn't easy to pick up anything specific. I actually got some ginger and something of a coriander scent although I doubt it's actually in the beer but that's fine I like coriander. The mouth-feel is pleasant and full....not too water and not too creamy, like I said balance was their aim here. The taste is very pleasant with a bouquet of spices and notes, none of which jump out at you, but I think that's why this recipe works so well. Hints of ginger and orange for sure and you will get some cinnamon on the taste, something I didn't get from the scent. This is a very very smooth beer and this is something anyone can enjoy. Some of the more ""refined"" beer snobs might be a bit disappointed with the ""lack"" of complexity or boldness but putting this in perspective as a fine seasonal brew, I think it's pretty damn good and would recommend this to anyone."

"I think highly of Samuel Adams because I know that they have the potential to make great beers. And they have a number of excellent winter beers too, especially in my opinion the Double Bock and the Fuzzywig. But this easy-to-find offering is disappointing. The spices make the smell and taste rather confusing. The beer is crisp but offers nothing special in the mouthfeel, and overall the beer tastes mediocre and confusing. This a dumbed down winter beer, and it's unfortunate that Samuel Adams doesn't make their better winter beers more widely available."
""
"The Verdict: It’s ok. Like most of Samuel Adams’ offerings, this is craft beer dumbed down for the masses. Drinkable, but ultimately bland compared to the many great seasonals now available."

"Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a super clear amber beer with a soft, thin, off white head that leaves nice lacing. It has a light aroma of light grain, orange peel and ginger. It has a smooth, medium body with a light, slightly watery finish. The mouth is left just a little gritty. It's lightly flavored with malt and orange peel. There's a little bitterness after the swallow. This is where the ginger and cardamom come out. This is just kind of a simple session beer. It doesn't have a lot of personality, but it's certainly quaffable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice seasonal from Sam Adams. Nothing to jump up and down about, but a very solid craft beer. Subtle Citrus notes and like spice flavors ... well balanced with the hop bitterness. Golden color with a white head. Clean mouthfeel. Rather Crisp for a winter lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - For an easily accessible beer that falls into the ""pop"" category, I am very impressed. Great tasting beer; smooth; warm; spicy, and refreshing. An easy sell for those not willing to venture into more adventurous beers. Nice work, Sam..."
""
""
""
""
"Body depth OK and overall not a bad beer at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Spices are subdued, toasted malt flavor dominates. Lighter bodied than I would expect from a bock but the firm hop bitterness and medium-thin body make this easy drinking and you could easily reach for another one."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a Samuel Adams glass. Deep copper with a thick creamy white head. Lingers on and leaves some lacing. Aroma is winter-esque spices, but nothing really stands out. It all just sort of blends. The taste is about the same. There is definitely some winter spice action here, but at the end, there isn't really anything distinct and it sort of tastes muddled. It's certainly not bad, but I just feel like focusing on one or two of the seasonal spices would make this beer more distinct."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours up a deep clear amber with a one finger foamy white head, a little bit of retention and a moderate amount of lacing. The nose is pretty mild. I basically only get a nebulous hard to describe freshness. Taste is good,but sort of one dimensional. There is a dry taste upfront followed by a dry bitter metallic finish. Mouthfeel is undistinctive,but inoffensive. Okay, but I don't feel the need to have more."
""
""
""
"O: Again not a bad little beer from Sam Adams, nice spice characters with good malty body, good ABV so you could put down 2 or 3 with no problem."

"O- Fairly complex brew in regards to all the flavors and ingredients that seem to be highlighted but it's very well balanced considering. I have had SA brews that seem to be overwhelmed by artificial flavorings...Chocolate Bock, Cherry Wheat to name a few...but this one seems to be the real deal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"This is my favorite beer of all. I wish it was not a seasonal brew. It flies of the store shelves. The flavor is stronger than the regular Boston Lager and the taste is pleasant without feeling heavy. I like lagers so this hits the spot. Please Mr. Adams consider making this a year round brew."

"O- This is another example of a great beer for those who have never gone beyond the light lager. It has some malt flavor, without being overwhelming. There's nothing here to scare anyone away. For myself, I will never buy this, but for the style and for what it is, it serves a purpose."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- good for sessions and campfires with roasted hotdogs"
""
""
"Overall, the initial perceptions given by both the aroma and the taste were very nice. Unfortunately, subsequent examples of both couldn’t live up the promise, and the beer came across as more watery than expected. There are still good flavors in here, but they needed to be cranked up a notch to be noticed—especially the sugars, which are almost lost."

""
""

"Overall: I'm surprised by this beer...it's definitely a bavarian style lager first, rich sweet malt base, with some winter spices added for flavor almost as an after thought...it's not overly sweet at any point, the candy is subtle, maybe too subtle and the spices are very muted (too muted)...while it is a winter seasonal ale, i would say it's the most basic christmas/winter seasonal i've had this year...if you like lagers and a bit of variety, you'll like this beer...but, if you like that candy sweetness that reminds you of christmas or sitting by a fireplace, this one may not fulfill your needs...it's worth trying because the malt flavor is drinkable, but i'm surprised how muted the other flavors are...(3/5)"
"Sam Adams has been making a number of respectable beers lately, along with a lot of forgettable, nondescript standbys. This beer definitely qualifies as one of the latter."

"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, best before May 2013. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a nice amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of apple, pear, caramel, ginger, toast, grass, cracker, light pepper, and herbal. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and solid complexity. Taste of apple, pear, caramel, toast, cracker, grass, ginger, light cinnamon, light citrus, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruits, caramel, toast, bread, grass, ginger, light cinnamon, and light herbal on the finish for a short bit. Nice flavor balance with a fair amount of robustness; with a nice subtle balance of the added spices; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good bock style. Good flavor balance with a fair amount of robustness; and extremely smooth to drink. This was a nicely enjoyable offering."
"Drinkability: A solid brew. Upon first impression, it is not too festive or wintery but it is tasty drinking. It will do the job."
""
""
"Overall I would highly recommend that this beer at least be given a try during the winter months. It is definitely the most widely distributed and most well known winter brew, but don't let this deter you from giving it a try, as I'm sure it will come to hold a regular spot in your fridge over the cold season."

"Had a glass with dinner at Applebee's. Served in a Weiss beer glass, beer was rich amber in color with a nice head with good lacing and retention. Aroma was sweet and malty with spicy notes.

"Copper in color, translucent and absent of any haze. Small head with broken bits of lacing. Malty aroma with a hint of caramel. Flavor notes are slight. Caramel, hops and spices. Nothing too interesting going on here. The body/mouthfeel is above average but wishing for some stronger flavors. Overall a decent beer that under-delivers."
""
""
"Would I recommend it? Depends on the other options available, but if at a beer bar or store with a wide selection, I'd probably recommend a pass (but not take any offense if my advice was ignored)."

"The beer pours a candied brown, bordering on amber, with a huge fluffy cream head with yellowing notes. The beers body is lager clean, completely free of any haze, and quite translucent, though the beer’s darkness does fight this a little bit. The lacing is fat and sticky, leaving webbing behind on my mug. On the nose, the beer smells spicy, with a little too much cinnamon burn and a note of ginger. Slight citrus notes are found when the glass is swirled, and underlying all the smells is a caramelly smell that is tinged with wheat. The beer tastes abrasively spicy with a clear cinnamon burn that seems to hurt the other flavors. The beer begins with light caramel malts and slight cinnamon before opening into a slightly biscuity malt that is immediately torn out of the mouth by the cinnamon spice which drowns out most other notes and lingers in the mouth. Slight hints of the ginger and orange peel can be felt at the fringes of the palate, and perhaps a touch of grassy hops can be tasted, but this is all below the cinnamon, which is rocking around on the palate like an unwanted elephant. This flavor is much spicier than I recall it being in years past, and is really hurt by the overwhelming cinnamon. Now, when I say it tastes like cinnamon, I don’t mean the nice cinnamon flavors of a baked good, but the burn with a slight bitter flavor that you get from putting too much cinnamon in your mouth… In case anyone was thinking I was just complaining about the taste of cinnamon… On the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied with a slight chew to it. Carbonation gives a little bite in the beginning, and then mellows over the tongue to provide a clean drink, though the spices punch nasty burns on my tongue. The mouth is left dry with a spice burn after the beer has left, with saliva only on the very edges of my tongue. Overall, this is a very heavy handed beer. I’ve had a couple of this year’s batch, and I have to say that the Boston Beer Company really overdid the spice this year. On their site they claim they searched far and wide this year to bring the best cinnamon sticks all the way from Vietnam, and while I applaud them on finding cool foreign ingredients, I wish they would stop playing with a recipe that tasted perfectly fine last year. This beer needs to tone down its spice so that other flavors can be enjoyed. I am a little weirded out that no one else has said anything else about the spice for this years version, so maybe it was just my pack, though that would be very strange... Perhaps its just my palate? Anyways, its cheap and easily found so try it for yourself, don't trust my opinion."

"Overall: A positive surprise! It's a nice rich lager with some proper flavour, but not too overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It doesn't taste like anything really, aside from the slight hop and caramel taste. There are better bocks and winter ales out there than this."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice tasting brew, perfect for cool winter evening and very drinkable."
""
"Overall- Not a bad beer. I probably wouldn't seek it out or anything, but I wouldn't pass it up if it was offered to me either."
"Taste is bright - lots of clean dry malt, with some biscuit, Christmas spices. Nothing offensive here, very tasty but very sweet. Easy to drink. Mouthfeel is light, slightly creamy with high carbonation. Overall a great session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"An incredibly plain beer, but not a bad beer. I remember loving this to death a few years ago, now its not too exciting. It's still pretty good though. Above average, but not by much."
""
""
"The taste was slightly malty with a bit of ginger but it was very weak. I found a hint of cinnamon but it was sparse and fleeting. This is not the best entry from Samuel Adams and my least favorite in the Holiday Sampler."
""
""
""
""
"overall, a rather plain, but drinkable brew. a little bitter finish, but easily sessionable. if you like sam adams."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - honestly a little plain. nothing really stands out all that much. not a bad beer at all, but nothing exceptional."
""
""
""
"Overall: Average winter brew. I always enjoy a few every year."
""
""
""
"So unfortunately, my nose is plugged up so I didn't get the full experience but I get the wheat/bread/smoky flavor and I enjoyed the mixture of spices all in a dark brew. Quite enjoyable winter beer, even if it is a bit strong on the aftertaste. Very filling."

"O – This is a pretty good lager. I’m not sure how much it fits the bock style, but the toasted and caramelized malts are there. As it is, neither the seasonal spices nor the malts really dominate the aroma or taste. I wish at least one of them would be just a bit more pronounced and take center stage. Regardless, this is a tasty and very drinkable beer that is well-suited to the season."

"O: Not special really. Not particularly flavorful and I really didn't pick up and spices/clove/ginger/orange peel..."
""
"O: Not bad, but not up to my standards for a good winter seasonal beer."
"O-An interesting combination of ingredients used here and overall I think it works. Unique and tasty with plenty of different malt flavors with subtle spicing that enhances the taste. Well done. Enough flavor complexity for a December night with a fresh foot of snow on the ground (like today) yet light enough for several in a sitting."
""
""
""

""
"O: Its ok. Not my favorite of the Sam seasonals but its decent."
""
""

"Nice beer for a seasonal from our Boston brethren. Especially for something I can get at a chain restaurant."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So this is a nice winter brew. It's heavy enough for drinking on a cold winter's day, but light enough that you have no problem being able to put down a few."
""
"Overall: This is an average beer. I'm beginning to think that winter spicy lagers aren't really on my desired beer radar. It wasn't bad, just not something I'm going to spend my money on again."
""

""

"O - Like most of Sam Adams brews to me: not terrible but far from memorable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Solid winter lager that is Very rich but highly enjoyable."
""
"I look forward to Sam's winter every year and this is not the dark lager I was expecting like the label says. Pours copper color with a white head and tastes like a beer I drink in October. Still very good but does not present itself as a dark winter beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty bland, a very average beer. It also has some earthy notes that don't mix in well with the rest of it."
"A strange one - a spiced dark wheat lager. A bit too lively, doesn't have the smoothness of wheat and the body doesn't quite hold the spice. But drinkable, I'd buy this for family Christmas dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-decent brew, isn't the best example of the style but still a really drinkable beer. Wouldn't mind having a few more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Kind of not true to the style, kind of flawed, but I've still drank a million of these in my day when I was first discovering craft beer, and somehow it doesnt seem like winter until I have at least one. I'll probably be drinking this in SA Winter Classic packs until I die."

"So far Sam Adams just does not do it for me. The only one of their beers I liked so far is the Octoberfest."

""
""

"Simple and delicious. Sam Adam's has always done good with the Bocks."
""
""
""
""

"The bock pours out a dark-golden brown with a lightly tanned head. The head pours thick but disappears quickly as though it were wispy. The smell of the beer was incredible - my nose was pleasantly assaulted with the aroma of spice, cinnamon, and oranges - it was truly great. I was surprised at the rich taste of this lager - rivaling their Boston Lager in my opinion. I could distinctly taste everything I smelled from the bottle making it a great experience. Overall, I rated it a little lower since the beer did leave an aftertaste that didn't agree with me. Nonetheless, I still have one bottle left of this stuff and I think I might just crack it open tonight."

"an ok seasonal beer. would be better with more spice and flavor, and less grain."
"Poured a clear amber with a one finger white head that receded to a ring of white, leaving some lacing. Pretty good looking. Scents of caramel, sweet malt, sweet spices, cinnamon-like and dark fruit. A pretty good aroma profile, sweet, spicy and inviting. Flavor begins with sweet malt and caramel, with a moderate level of floral hop bitterness. This moves into some indeterminable sweet spices in the middle alongside the malt, caramel and hops and some breadiness and toasty malt flavors. The finish continues those flavors with a nice aftertaste of caramel and floral hops. A good, malty, sweet, yet not cloying flavor profile. Quite balanced between sweetness and hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink, fairly dry and slightly creamy. Overall not a bad Winter beer. Its got a good mix of sweet malt, hops and spices in both aroma and flavor that balance well together and make for a good drink. I'd go back to it."

"I'm giving this a 2 because it made me sick for some reason, twice. The 1st time I had it I was drinking on an empty stomach and I got incredibly drunk after only 2 beers. I wound up drinking about 5 or 6 and even though I ate, the sick feeling never went away and I felt sick the next day too. Tried again the other night after I had dinner and got sick again after only drinking 4. It's not normal for me to get sick on 4, 5 or even 10 beers but my stomach felt like it was a washing machine. There is probably something in the brew that doesn't agree with me this year. I've been able to drink this in years past and has been my favorite winter brew until this year."

""
""
""

"Pours a deep copper color with a large white head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smell is very subtly spicy in its character. There is a slight citrus and a very faint alcohol aroma as well. Taste has typical lager characteristics, the spiciness comes through right away along with a slight sweetness and the beer is balanced with a nice bite towards the finish. High carbonation, medium body, and watery mouthfeel. This beer is slightly above average. Similar in flavor to Boston Lager with more spice character. To me there is definitely an off flavor present in this beer that leads to an almost stale character. Not my favorite Sam Adams by far, but decent for the style they were going for."
""
""
"Taste/feel: This to me is a lot like an amber. The malts are pretty huge in this. The taste is similar to Samuel Adams' Pumpkin Ale mixed with their Oktoberfest. The bottle mentions some cinnamon and nutmeg, and it's there, but appropriately it's more in the background. A very enjoyable beer. I even get a tinge of sourness or something in there on the finish which makes this beer pretty thirst quenching. A great winter beer, and is probably my favorite of the Samuel Adams seasonals."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent winter seasonal from Samuel Adams."
""
"O: Enjoyable and relatively easy to drink though the spice flavors are a little too intense for me to have more than one in a session."

""

""

"Pouring much darker than their regular Lager, shades of red, brown, and amber blend to create a beautiful color palette. Notes of pine, cardamom, and orange drift of the very thick head, and when you discover that the brewery used ginger, cinnamon, and orange zest to make their winter seasonal the melange of aromas makes sense. On the tongue, just what you'd expect form a great snow seasonal; mild hop presence, a slight ginger bite mixed a fuller sweetness from the cinnamon and orange, thick and creamy (reminiscent of cream sodas), with a warm lingering finish. A perfect beer for sipping near the fireplace, enjoying conversation with good friends in a cozy room, or snuggling up with that special someone. Bypass food with this pint, it shines all on it's own, and strongly echoes the flavors of the season. Open one up, and find some mistletoe...cheers!"
"O: Drinkable, but not particularly tasty. Wouldn't recommend or purchase. Could be compelled to drink again."
""
"O: This was a better-than-average Sam Adams beer, but not by much. A respectable, cheap dark lager if that’s your thing (and you can’t find any Boston Lager)."
"Poured into a Samuel Adams perfect pint glass. Pours clear dark copper with a soapy, quickly dissipating white head. The carbonation appears to be mild. The aroma is of bready malt with some caramel sweetness. The spices are pretty subtle. I get some of the orange zest and the cinnamon and ginger. There's a nice malt backbone here with some cinnamon and ginger bite that builds up as you drink it. I get the orange zest as well. There's the caramel sweetness that adds to the backbone pretty well. There is also some hop bitterness in the back. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is pretty high. This is a very good beer that I enjoy drinking when it comes into season."

"This might be the best beer from the Boston Beer Company. A perfect winter seasonal. Spiced with cinnamon, ginger and a hint of orange, I can't get enough. It's not strong, but the spices do help give the beer a warming property to it. It's a tasty, warming, drinkable beer to look for every year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I can't say I loved this one. The spice levels could've certainly been higher and the overall beer better balanced and interesting. It is a fairly easy drinker, just nothing exciting."
""
"I love this beer for what it is... An everyday winter beer. Nothing wrong with that."
"Good beer for the season. Very heavy with a bitter/hoppy aftertaste, more than i was expecting in a lager. Not overly impressed but i could see myself drinking this from time to time. Like most of Sams offerings it was much better from the tap. well crafted and fairly inexpensive for a fancy man beer. I think next time though I will stick to the boston lager"

"Overall: Decent winter brew offering. Straight out of the bottle I thought it was one of the better brews in the bunch, but a day later and poured into a glass, I don't find it nearly as interesting. Nonetheless, it's nothing I'd go out of my way for, but it's not a deal breaker in the Sam Adams Winter pack."
""
"O - Nice. A good beer for this time of year, and one of my favorites from Sam Adams' winter variety packs. Want to have it on tap one day."
""
""
""
""
""
"SA seasonal on tap, I assume it's mostly fresh. This pours an amber color with a finger thick off white head which has good retention. The smells are malty, some toffee, nutty, caramel and a hint of molasses. The feel is medium ish. The taste is good enough similar to the smells, a little nutty toffee with other malts low hop bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Smells of gingerbread, cinnamon, and orange peel, taste runs through each of these elements in reverse order as the nose. First some orange peel, a burst of cinnamon dust, and than gingerbread. As it warms, it gains a graham cracker-like quality to the malt. The body is unfortunately somewhat watery, thin, and fizzy."

"Pours a transparent burnt caramel/honey color with a modest cream-colored head that leaves little to no lacing. Aroma is sweet and spicy, but not overbearing. Medium to light bodied, the flavor is malty up front with a complement of seasonal spices. Prickly carbonation makes it difficult to dissect the spice profile, though the bottle mentions cinnamon and ginger. There's also a faint wheatiness lurking beneath the surface as well. Hop flavors are pretty well subdued, which I actually prefer, and the finish manages to subside without any objectionable aftertaste, leaving a sweet, malty stickiness that lingers on the lips. On the whole, Sam Adams Winter Lager is a respectable and easy to drink seasonal brew with enough flavor and complexity to keep you interested for the entire glass."

"I really like all bock varieties and this is a solid offering by SA. Not as complex as some continental varieties; it is very tasty and more balanced than many others. Spicing is a nice addition to the style!"
""
""
""
"Ahhh...Sam Adams. I have found most of their offerings to be solid choices...no different with the winter lager. Drank this out of a bottle with April as the notched as the month to drink by for best taste. Got this at my local krogers on sale in the Winter Variety pack. Good looking brew poured into my pint glass. The smell is bready with strong orangy overtones. I think this beer tastes great. Hops and spices from start to finish. Overall a great winter lager. cheers!"

"Overall: I remember my first encounter with this beer. It's much the same now. It's a mess when it warms. When it's super cold it's drinkable, but as it warms it falls apart and becomes a watery mess."

"It has a nice, crisp taste without being light and you can smell the perfect blend of oranges and spices brewed into it. A very tasty treat during the colder months of the year."
""
"O: An average winter ale."
""
""
"This is one of the go-to winter holiday beers. The taste and the smell go hand-in-hand producing a cloud of wintery spice and everything nice. It pours a nice amber brown into a glass and retains a small little head for the first half of the beer. After that, the appearance can begin to fail a bit as it loses its carbonation and (too large) of pieces of spice/flower begin floating around in the glass. As much as I like real solid pieces of the mix in my brew, these can get in the way of just enjoying the drink. However, comparatively to other winter brews, this is definitely one of my favorite American choices. I enjoy most of Samuel Adams' brews, and this is one my favorite of their extensive lineup."
""
"M - Light bodied with a decent amount of carbonation."
"Overall, I didn't really enjoy this beer and don't plan on drinking any time in the future. However, it wasn't terrible, just not to my liking because of the spice flavors."

"Final Grade: 3.58, a solid, respectable B-grade. This is an excellent winter session lager. It is refreshing and light, not overly complex, and the spices are well-integrated (i.e. not overpowering). There are other bocks and warmers I would pick before SA's Winter Lager, but this is a noticeably light, easy-drinking example for the style. Worth a try, but not a worldbeater."
"Overall this beer surprised me, and I'm glad I got it!"

""
""
"This is a great beer for those wanting to try something new but not too keen on the powerful, strong craft beers on the market these days. A friend of mine is always sampling the new stouts and IPAs I'm trying and we can never find one we agree on. He's a fan of the lightweight commoners (Bud Light, Keystone Light, etc.) and for once this one has enough flavor and class that I am a fan and he is also a fan which blew me away. This is a good bridge between the everyday run of the mill and the ""good stuff"" that you'll only discover if you start looking for the quality perfect beers and quit grabbing what's on the commercials and ads and plastered all over the place."

""
""
""
"O-I've had this for years but never thought to review it until this sampler, this is a decent seasonal offering..."
""
"Body is about medium in heaviness with adequate, but slightly less carbonation than I think would be optimal. The result is a fairly smooth lager, whereas I would like a bit more crispness with the body and lower alcohol content. Finish is fairy dry, a bit wet around the edges."

"Overall: this is a very nice subtle winter beer. It has just a little bit of each ingredient to make it a nice winter brew. Cheers."

"O: Nothing special to this beer, but it is pleasant. It's a everyday beer, one I could happily drink but wouldn't seek out."
"Very drinkable lager that drinks like an amber ale and pairs well with pizza, pasta, deli meats and crackers. I'd drink this year-round if it was available."
"O: Very drinkable and nicely complex bock. One of the better seasonal offerings by both Sam Adams and winter beers in general."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good lager. Nice spice additions. Flavors are overall mild, but work well together. It is an easy beer to drink, but I like my palate to be challanged a bit more. I would probably not buy this beer again."

""
""
"In late 2006, I received a few bottles of this from someone who didn't like it. This was one of the first craft beers I ever had, and I thought it was terrible. At some point in 2008, I tried it again, and I didn't like it. In 2012, I still don't like it. The difference now is that I have a better idea of why I do not like this."
"I paired this with a spicy (as in hot sauce) cheese kielbasa sandwich and it held up very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Tastes a lot like Boston Lager. Pretty good but nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
"This is a beautiful looking beer. Deep ruby caramel, I expected a mouth-filling drink. I don't think this beer has enough body for a winter brew, however - it felt too thin. The smell is spicy, almost exotic - again, something I would normally associate with warmer times. This is completely personal preference, of course! Maltiness is quite apparent - my mouth is still feeling dried out by it as we speak! I'd prefer if the slight hoppiness of this brew were more balanced with some comfortable sweetness; the malty feel seems to call for that. At any rate, it's pleasant enough, but I don't think it's one I'll go back to too often."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark with a deep red color, tight creamy head and impressive lacing. The smell is harder to place--mostly just spicy. The flavor is malt-heavy and spice-heavy, with a lot of nice nutmeg and ginger giving it body and excitement. I like winter beers with heavy spice, and this has it. I could use a bit more orange, though. It's very rich and drinkable--I was more and more impressed as we worked through the six-pack, I will say!"
""
"The 5.5% ABV is just right."
"I really think this could have been amped up with the spices, maybe even kick the alcohol up a bit and make it more interesting. A solid beer, but a bit underwhelming."
""
"Same old Sam Adams copper color, same old cinnamon/orange smell. Same old sweet malty sweetness. Where are the hops? Do the brewmasters who I see on TV realize that their products have a soapy sour mouthfeel and aftertaste? No body, thin."

"Among my least favorite of the Sam Adams regular beers, but it's pretty inoffensive compared to some of the spiced concoctions sold for big prices by others. This was a deal in the $11.99 twelve-pack."

"D/O: This amber-colored bock more approachable that it seems to be appealing, at least when it is deconstructed during careful analysis. However, when the layers are all allowed to unite and slip by without overly careful scrutiny, it comes across as interesting and very food-friendly."
"From the look of this beer it looks like they might be trying to recreate the type of beers that show up in Norway in the Xmas season. It is a Vienna lager in style and actually tasted a little like Negro Modelo in its caramel notes in the nose and the also the malty finish. Easy drinking yet with enough complexity to make it interesting. With all the winter ales out there it is nice to see a winter lager."
""
""
"A pretty good beer. SA has always put out stellar beer and for the price, I think they are the best in the business. I could certainly drink some of these over the winter months."
"T: Light and malty flavor with some bready malts and a touch of ginger and maybe some other spices I couldn't quite pick out. It's by no means bad, but none of the flavors really jump out at you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a recommended Sam Adams seasonal in my book. It's cloying, one-sided, and difficult to keep drinking. Got this one by mistake after ordering a Boston Lager. Not a fan."

"M: A hair thin, but fine textured and appropriately carbonated (not too much)."
"Like it, will buy it again next year."

"Didnt know there was a winter and summer lager,so take this review with a noob in mind. The color was a bit scarey to me,..lager I thought were bonde,this is almost red. Beautiful head,but not white,more creamy bone color. The grains are in the aroma,cant smell any skunky hops. A very nice suprise to the taste buds,a very full bodied (whatever that means) lager. No fancy twists,or jabs from fruits or hops. It went great with my dinner. I loved this beer."
""
"Very subdued aroma, but a beautiful nut-brown color. The flavor is a slight tart at first but very balanced. This beer warms you well as a good winter beer should. Hints of spice, but other than that not terribly different from basic Sam lager to me."
""
""
"As always, a subtle, easy drinking, well-crafted beer but for the uninitiated."

"M: I'm wondering about how this beer would taste if warmed up, maybe mulled with some additional spices. Funny how certain beers can continue to surprise me..."
""
""
"Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a 4oz sample glass. Served cool. Pours an off white head and a nice reddish brown amber body. Very clear. Yeast is strong in the nose. A bit course in the malt department. Not smooth and almost candy-like most bocks. As it warms you get a little more depth to the malt. Hops is there in the background but you don't think about it. Not a bad beer but not what it use to be. The nose is too yeasty. I remember when this beer was very spicy and holiday like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a fine winter lager. It's not one I would go out of my way for—in fact, I don't enjoy it as much as some of the other Sam winter seasonals—but I'm glad I have a few bottles to enjoy."
""
""
""
"I have to say it was a lot better than I thought it was going to be, but this will probably be the only time I try it."
""

"This is a balanced, drinkable beer. Nothing outstanding."

"This was part of the Sam Adams Winter Variety Pack, but not the best beer in the pack. Is says Lager, but it is really a Bock with some ginger and cinnamon added for extra flavor. It appeared a little paler than most bocks with about a finger of tan head that left some god lacing. The mouthfeel was light to medium with maderate carbonation. Even with the extra, there was not as much aroma and flavore as expected. Overall it is a pretty good Christmas beer but there are better ones in the Winter Variety Pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad Bock; It has character and refreshing. Nothing to crazy in terms of tastes, but still a decent Christmas beer. Worth a try."
""
""
"Overall enjoyable beer, not quite to the standards of winter warmers, but I think this represents a bock fairly well. Not a bad choice for a draught beer at a sports bar and it complemented my fish n chips very well."
""
""
"Overall: Like the ski chick said in the commercial: ""It's good!"" This is what a Christmas beer should taste like."
"Notes: looks just like an English Pale Ale. Spices are discernible but subtle. This is very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
"The taste of this beer reminds me even more of winter. To me, the taste is similar to that of an octoberfest, but the spices are much more noticeable. Once again, I can't put my finger on the exact spices in this, since I don't go around tasting random spices all day. But, I know the spices they use in this beer go very well in it, and that it gives it that winter flavor that makes this the perfect winter beer."
""
""
""
"Overall this has a nice drinkability and decent character, but is a bit subtle for my tastes. Nice, but not exceptional holiday beer."
""
"I recommend this beer to people that are newer to craft beer. They will probably like this winter lager. If you get the winter variety pack from Sam Adams, keep the Fezziwig and Black and Brew over this option."
"To me this is an 	average Bock, not bad but not great even if it is easy drinking. It would probably be good with about any food, but it wouldn't be great IMHO."

"O: Not a terrible offering from Sam Adams, but not their best. I won't be purchasing this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very mediocre offering from Samuel Adams. Pours dark with little head. Taste is avg. initially but gets better with a pretty solid finish. You can taste the advertised ginger and a little bit of cinnamon. However, doesn't really warm you up as advertised. I thought this beer used to be a lot better."
"Overall - A decent winter beer that is very drinkable. This isn't the sort of beer that I would get excited over each holiday season though. Considering the awful beer that is available to me locally, I was glad to see this one tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But the taste was surprisingly good! the mouthfeel and flavors were well balanced and complex enough to keep my interest past the bottom of my first one. I will try again."

"Overall a pretty good bock. Suitable for the winter with it's spicy notes."

""
""
"Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall this one is pretty solid. Lots of good flavors going on here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A better choice than most things offered at your average bar, but for winter ales, better ones can certainly be found in your local craft beer store for not much more of a dent in your Christmas budget. Also, not a great session beer."
"O: Overall I think this is a great beer. S.A. never lets me down especially when it comes to seasonal brews. Its not the best winter seasonal out there but a good one nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"D: Good. Not necessarily a go-to or one worth searching high and low for but a nice choice when offered."
""
""

"O-pretty ok beer from SA"

"O) I paired this beer with a double bacon cheeseburger, bottomless fries, and an overpriced mall Santa photo package. I must say, it was a nice evening, and this is a very fine winter lager."

""
""

"O- to me this beer is vastly underrated, what an awesome lager!"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is not my favorite beer or style, but I think this represents fairly well. Inevitably, since I live in a beer starved area, I end up drinking quite a few of these every winter."
"O - SA Winter Lager is a decent bock if you enjoy a little spice in your beer."

"Overall: Very good beer. A little to spicy for outdoors. But an excellent indoor beer or with homemade soup."

"O - A decent winter beer, nice malt flavors and spice medley. Good to have on a cool night with dinner, though there are better options for the season."
"O-A decent offering from SA, one of my first darker beers and I have to say I enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
""
""
"O: Wow, I really enjoyed this holiday winter lager. Good example of the winter lager style."
""
""
"O- Not a huge lager fan but this one was nice. Not really the best of the SA holiday pack but still keeps ya nice and toasty on those cold winter nights."
""
""
"O: Not bad at all. I won't be getting six-packs of this anytime soon, but I would have no problem putting a few of these away if they were given to me. A decent session beer if you can look past the 5.5% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
"Dr: Quite drinkable and nice for the style. I enjoyed it on tap and I enjoy it now out of the bottle. I won't pursue this in future, but I do enjoy it. It's not exactly special, but it's enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"D: All the ingredients in this beer are in the right balance and the flavors meld together so well. It is easy drinking all the way through this beer and quite satisfying."
""
""
"O: Not the most interesting brew; but not like I couldn’t have a few, either."
""
""
"O: I had this on tap before I formally reviewed it, and I think I liked it better then. Appearance and nose were disappointing. Taste was good. Nothing spectacular here, but it's better on-tap."

""
""
""
""
""
"O-Could be the worst beer of the Winter Mix, there is nothing bad about this beer, just nothing great about either."
""
"I love Sam Adams. This is great lager, and it is this type of beer that has got me seeking out lagers now and not just witbiers or reds. Thanks Sam! The flavor is rich, and even though it's filling i still find myself wanting more. Very good brew, I look forward to it every winter."
"Decent beer that's easy to drink, but nothing really jumps out as ""Winter"" to me."
"I had this prior on tap, it was better. This is a beer worth having."
""
"Overall, an almost slammable winter beer, as far as I can tell. It goes down like a canned macro."
""
"This is a nice winter offering. It offered a little more complexity than the Boston Lager. I also think the ABV is a little higher. Not a bad brew."
""
"not crisp and cold and refreshing like most lagers, and not even fully seasonally applicable due to its average abv and dumbed down flavor. sam makes some epic beers, but this ones just average. pours a light indian brown color into that funny sam adams glassware, good head. smells like a malt bomb, but tastes a bit cinnamon and clove spice, thick mouthfeel drags it down and sits in the gut. not a good session lager. of the winter brews the cream stout and the scotch murder this one. id say pass it by but its so damn common in the northeast..."
"This beer is OK. I prefer Old Fezziwig to it, however. Can we get six packs of Old Fezzi instead of this?"
"O: Just an ok winter lager. Nothing really special – it was easy to drink but nothing I would grab again."
""
"All around good winter beer. The beer pours to an amber-brown color and rich, patchy permanent head. Aroma is malty and spicy (are there spices in this beer?). Flavor is smooth caramel malt and tangy spiciness that suggests ginger and/or Saaz hops. Finishes pleasingly bitter/spicy. A good beer for the holiday season!"
"Not really noticing the spice taste or smell that others have noticed. Real typical of a Sam Adams line. Would not stock my fridge as it is a seasonal but always look forward to the holidays cause I know it will be available."
""
""
""
"Nothing special. I'm not a fan of this years batch really...it doesn't really justify me buying any more."
"O: good for the style and good for me, have it any time during the winter"
""
"Overall this is a nice brew, nice change from the regular lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overally I really like this beer because its cold outside (at least in Nebraska it is) and this beer really does seem to go well with this kind of weather and the coming Christmas season (and Thanksgiving which has since passed). You can find it in stores now but only until spring comes which is awhile off right now. Give this one a try especially if you live in a cold area during winter. compare it to Blue Moon winter, Winter Tilt by Empyrean in Lincoln, NE, and Goose Island winter."
""
"Overall- not bad, I just wouldn't seek out again."
""
"It pours a deep copper red with a thin head. It looks very inviting with a rich red color. The smell is malty with a hint of caramel and alcohol. Subtle floral hop aroma present, but the smell is predominantly malt. It isn’t super fragrant. The spices show up in the flavor. There is a small dicetyl taste here as well. Overall it tastes very much like a pumpkin beer. The cinnamon is pretty noticeable. The finish has a nice spicy bite, but there is a little metallic aftertaste that did not sit well with me. It is an interesting brew. It tastes more like a pumpkin beer than a bock. It's OK once of twice a year."
""
""
"O: Not a bad winter beer, a little lighter than I would like though."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber colors with an off white head. All im picking up on the nose is some cinnamon and a slight maltiness. Big spicy maltiness up front with flavors including cinnamon, nutmeg, and buttered toasted. Finishes clean with a slight metallic taste leftover in the mouth (very moderate though). The finish also leaves a nice buttery flavor on the bag of the tongue. Definitely makes for a decent winter session beer. Better than expected."
"Impressed by this brew. Still not set as a favorite, but quite tasty. I get a hankering for it on cold Kansas nights."
"The taste was actually very nice...almost identical to the nose: rye, oak, clove, dark malts, and a very nice hop bite. This was a very balanced beer from BBC. I enjoyed it."
""
"Flight delayed so airport barhopping is the activity du jour. Last bar had hop devil. Not super happy I left. Brown liquid is topped with a very thin film of head. No lacing. Aroma is minimal can pick up on some spice, but it is pretty neutral. Flavor has some breathless along with some clovey cinnamon spice. I also think of banana bread with this one. Nice, but not great. Minimal hop presence at best. Mouthfeel is pretty nice. Good carb. Light and refreshing. What I expected, wanted, and got from BBC. Overall, ""meh"" is a good description of this beer. It's good enough, but nothing I would get if I could find an average alternative."
"O - I look forward to this every winter. Say what you will about Sam Adams products but I look forward to knowing that any bar/restaurant will have a quality beer on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The carbonation is mild to medium; the small bubbles are medium strong. The liquid is a bit sticky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the perfect brew for the season! TIZ the season for these winter ales. Anyway the beer looks kinda of a caramel color and very inviting the smell is kinda light you can surely pick out the hops mixed with sweet malts for its finish. The mouthfeel is nice very balanced and it is an overall great beer for the season. Grab one while you can!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid winter bock. Has a nice hop presence for the style. Very well balanced."
""
"The beer is crystal clear and copper / amber hued. The light beige head is an inch thick and leaves ample lacing on the pint glass. The primary scents are malt, holiday spices. Yams and/or pumpkin flavors along with some cinnamon and nutmeg. Slightly sweet with minimal bitterness. Light bodied, but not thin. Overall, a decent seasonal brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought I would be offended by the spices in this one but it is very well done, adding a complexity to the beer rather than over powering it. Well done and would drink again for a winter warmer."
"Decent."
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, not the worst winter I've had, but not the best either. I will likely not revisit."
""
""
"O- Strong in appearance and flavor, weak in mouthfeel and smell. Overall, just alright but since I've got four more varieities in this sampler to try, I'm happy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Decent, easy to drink and low alcohol make this a good beer. Not overly flavorful or anything out of this world, but worth a chance if your a boston lager fan, maybe looking for a spin on the classic lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - As I mentioned earlier, this is a good beer, though removing the spices of the past recipe ( I am thinking back quite a few years) lower some of its uniqueness. Good session beer, and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours a clear amber. decent head that slowly falls into a small layer. smells of spices, definitly a little cinnamon, and citrus as it says. very smooth beer. hits with some malty cinnamon spice up front, finishing with some citrusy bite at the end. leaves a flavorful creamy feeling in my mouth. good after taste. At first sip i wasnt sure if i was gonna like it but its really pretty good. nothing incredible but overall a pretty good buy for a winter lager."
"overall; not a bad drink and an interesting turn on the style. Worth a try but nothing to go crazy over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random dots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain and a variety of winter spices. Not much going on in the smell department. Taste is of malt/grain, some citrus flavors, and a lot of different spices (cinnamon, clove, etc.). There is a slight bitterness from the spices with each sip but it quickly fades. This beer has a bubbly level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is pretty good Winter beer but nothing too special really."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A good winter brew. Not spectacular, but not too bad either."
"I miss some of the beers they've removed, like the fruity lambic. That was my favorite."
"O- I find this one to be very similar to the Boston Lager, but with a little more of the spice notes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber color with no head at all. Aroma of sweet Caramel malts and spices, cinnamon and a slight note of nutmeg are present. The taste is a bit too sweet, not much of a hop bitterness to balance. It's fairly easy to drink but there is nothing special here. Not something I would ever seek out."
"O: A pretty solid beer and one that I would not pass up on draft in light of lesser options. This beer is a great value and something that could easily be shared among friends of varying degree of beer savvy. Not spectacular but certainly solid and easy to drink."
"First sip is a little vegetal and gross. Later sips aren't as off putting, but there's something there that just doesn't work. Some astringency in the mouthfeel, though light bodied and fairly smooth otherwise. Earthy vegetal flavor that reminds me of pumpkin or squash oddly enough. Some nutty malt character in there too, maybe some nutmeg? Overall the flavors don't coalesce well. Not too sure what to make of this, not really looking forward to finishing the glass either. edit: drank a 2nd one straight from the fridge a few weeks later, didn't seem as bad. Still a bit astringent with discordant flavors though."
""
""
"O: The concept behind this beer is novel, but as a product, it doesn't come together (at least not this year). In years past, this beer was a winter staple for me, but this year I think I'll find something else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was not impressed with this beer. It was very light in the mouthfeel category and the taste was just lacking. I was surprised to learn this is a bock, because it is one of my more favored styles, but I was sorely disappointed."
""
""
""
"O - Overall a good winter beer. I pick this up every year, and it is a staple at a lot of local places. Not overwhelming but solid"

"Had this served in a 25 ounce glass, I really enjoyed the first few sips, but after that this beer became a bit too much for my stomach. Certainly a better beer in a 12 or 16 ounce size, but I will happily try it again. Samuel Adams once again provides a great tasting beer for the mass market."
"Overall: Definitely recommended for cold days in the winter and fall. Delicious beer."

"I poured from the bottle into my usual truncated conical glass. The head was a finger width of tan foam that faded to light lacing. A ruby amber hue in color, much like American iced tea, was evident when the glass was held to the light. the aroma starts off with a sweet caramel malt note, and then fades to a faint of spice and hops. The taste hit in two waves... The first was the malty bready taste, and faded to a nice spice/hop note. The after taste the ginger made a subtle but clear presence that was nice as well. Mouth feel was light to medium with a good bit of carbonation tickling my tongue. Over all I like this seasonal. The spices were a little on the light side in aroma and taste, but this beats over doing it by a wide margin. It's a good seasonal lager overall, but it's not outstanding to where I would go out of my way to buy it again.... Fortunately for this beer my regular store stocks it, so a few more six packs will be consumed."
"O - Very nice on cold nights, I have nothing to compare it to yet in the style, but I liked this beer for sure. Looking forward to trying others."
"Not bad, but the most 'winter'-y part of this is the spice, and even for the price point, most other winter seasonals are better. Might be worth a look if you want some of that seasonal spice but desire the lager flavor profile."
"O: Nothing exceptional, but quite solid. Picked it up yesterday on a whim for an 11-11 party (eleven letters in Winter Lager). I can see this being a good change of pace from stronger beers during the cold months. Will likely buy it again."
"O: I wasn't overly impressed with this one. I'd rather have a good winter warmer on a cold day than revisit this one again."
"Overall: A re-review of my first review on BA. This was one of the first seasonals that I was drawn to, and one of the first beers that pulled me away from the boredom of adjunct lagers."
"Overall: A good holiday lager. The falvors are complex but subtle. Very drinkable."
"Super bready/toasty, adjuncty, skunky (it's fresh though). Just a hint of spiciness, at least partly from the hops. Watery. Very flimsy body, I wouldn't even call it ""light"". No kudos for this one, Samuel Adams. And yes, I like the bock style in general and I am very pro-lager, this just falls short."
"This beers ok. It's certainly not in the top twenty of winter seasonals I'd drink."
"This beer used to be a 7% ACTUAL wheat bock with a thick body, and a hearty, meaty flavor to it. I used to look forward to this one every year but will NOT purchase this ever again until I see the 7% abv slapped back on the bottle."
"O: For less than $10, it's hard to get better than this. This is a very good beer that is masterfully balanced and uses its additives well. Recommended."
"Overall - I was really impressed with this beer, pleasantly surprised. Very flavorful, complex and very well balanced, and at 5.5% ABV this is extremely sessionable. Taste of this brew reminded me of Fat Tire. This is the first flavor I tried in this sampler, can't wait to see what else is in store."
"o - decent, but nothing memorable. fits the style i suppose. probably the least enjoyable out of the winter sampler pack for me so far."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The sensory glass really gives the visual perception of this looking over-carbonated from the constant stream of bubbles but it is pleasantly modest and not overdone in the feel. The finish is quite crisp and while the spices are very upfront and noticeable, they are not overdone. This was a refreshing spiced brew that is a well done example of a spiced winter offering, I wouldn't mind having this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium and it is well carbonated."
"O: Average beer, and probably my least favorite from the winter pack. The combination of flavors just didn't appeal to me."
"On tap at the dutch, deep amber small off white head with moderate retention. Nose of cereal and light grass. Malty cerealness caresses the palate balanced with lightly cutting bitterness. Flowery and grass. Medium bodied and quiet enjoyable of this mid fall day."
"Comments: Sam Adams’ specialty beers are sometimes poorly executed, however this one is certainly a success. This beer is based on a very good bock with a sensible addition of typical holiday spices."
"Pours with a big foamy head to it, amber-brown color to it. Big, bubbly carbonation. Aroma is good, has a citrus hint to it but I didn't notice the ginger, a bit of cinnamon is there. Lighter-bodied than I expected, but still highly drinkable, not too much ABV. Overall this beer is similar to their Octoberfest, but I think the flavors weren't as prominent so I would go with the Octoberfest instead. Still not bad, I got this as a gift and enjoyed it."
"The flavors are all spiced up, all of the spices noted on the bottle are detectable. Orange zest, cinnamon, the ginger adds a bit of zing to it. The Malts balance out the spices. not a big fan of how these spices come together though, mostly the ginger i think."
"Overall Drinkability - This has to be the worst beer I've had from Sam Adams. Usually they get decent scores from me, but not this time around!"
"O: solid beer overall, I'd have it again. Might not be a go-to at times, but it hits the spot sometimes."
"O: An average holiday spiced beer. I always pick up a single every year hoping this beer gets better, but have yet to be wowed."
"Another one of their seasonal selections, sold in the variety pack and, if I’m not mistaken, separately in sixers. Poured in a Sam Adams perfect pint glass a clear amber/brown color. For some reason this feels exceptionally cold right now—as I’m not picking up much of anything on the aroma at first. Even as it warms there’s not a very noticeable aroma. Muted, malty. Taste is a different matter as I can definitely catch a blend of holiday spices with each sip. It’s spicy, not as in hot but as in flavorful, with a finish that invites another sip, although I can’t escape the feeling that this is just Sam Adam’s Lager with spices."
"O - Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a solidly done bock. It's very drinkable and a solid offering in the winter pack. Well done!"
"A great but easy to drink holiday style beer."
"Some sips come across like soda, but overall this is an enjoyable bock. I look forward to it every year."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a ruby red with a 1 inch one head, leaves some lacing. Smell is dark fruits, cinnamon, little nutmeg, clove,and a little orange. Taste is similar, Cinnamon & dark fruits have a power struggle, but those are the dominant flavors. Body should be heavier, but plenty of carbonation. Dribkability is almost too easy. Not what I remember it being years ago."
"O: I find this to be a very average beer. It is a good winter beer and gives your body a warm feeling."
"Pours a ruddy brown body with thin off white head. head dissipated almost instantly. Light spotting of glass, not lacing. Aroma is indistinct and bland. Tastes of sour caramel and too acidicaly sweet.Not nice tasting spices. Aftertaste is cloying. drink the Holiday Porter or Fezziwig instead!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a Golden Amber color. Has a light malty smell with a hint of spice toward the end. Plenty of carbonation. Tastes of hops an spice throughout. Little to no off-white head and leaves minimal lacing. Great beer. Makes me want to be in the ice house or by a campfire up north."
"O: Certainly not the best winter seasonal I've had, but far from the worst. Some of their other 'seasonals' from the mixed pack work better IMO, but that's up to BBC. Still a solid beer though"
"Overall I really enjoy this beer and look forward to it every year. Like many Sam Adams beers it has great flavor and is easy to drink several in one sitting."
"Pours a nice looking reddish amber. Very thin head and light lacing. Smells a little sweet, malty, some pie spices and what I could swear is pumpkin (this smells very similar to their Pumpkin Ale). Taste follows the nose. I definitely get some pumpkin. Pleasant, easy drinking, not spectacular but solid and sessionable. About what I expected."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - I could definitely drink quite a bit of this, but it just isn't that special. I remember it being better last year. It's holiday properties are weak and dwindling at best. It also exceptionally dry. It's an alright bock/lager, but it's just sort of average."
"O - this is fine, not great. The nose is quite good and would be much appreciated also on the tongue, but it's not there."
"I would definetly get this again, and I would recommend it to beer drinkers everywhere."
"All in all, a solid Bock...not spectacular...but a solid brew."
"O: My least favorite in the 2011 Winter pack. Will likely give away the second bottle. To label this as a bock leaves me scratching my head. Gimme a NG Uff-da any day over this."
"GOOD, HAVE SOME!"
"Overall: You know, I remember getting this during the winter for several years from 2003-2008, and I remember not only this being way better, but I remember there being some noble hops, a warmer experience in the mouthfeel, and it having quite a bit more body to it. Not only that, but I remember being overwhelmed with suds. Damn...bit let down. Going to try in on-tap this winter and review it again."
"O- Not a bad beer, but not my favorite. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one again, but wouldn't refuse it either....now I know I'm drinking this a bit past it's prime but I had this when I first bought the sampler pack in Winter 2010 and this wasn't really any different. I'm guessing this is standard for the style....I just couldn't do more than a bottle of this in a sitting...oh well!"
"(From backlog.) On-tap at Carraba's. Looking at the pour, it seems just like Boston Lager: bronze liquid with a smallish ecru cap, and radiant translucence. There is a small amount of hop character in the nose, which plays out as fruity-floral and spicy on the palate, atop a dry and biscuity malt base. Again, I see very little difference between this and Boston Lager. Nice feel, very crisp. Easy drinking overall, although I prefer BBCSABL over BBCSAWL."
"O - a nice variation for fans of Sam Adams Lager."
"Overall: Great mouthfeel. Spices seem muddied. This may be because of age. A good balanced beer. Would like to review a fresher example."
"The Winter Lager pours out as a slightly hazy looking brown color with a generous tan colored head on top. The aromas of some wintery spices, malts and some hops are on the nose. The taste is a little spicy but balanced enough that you can get all the flavors at different times. The mouthfeel is carbonated enough to make the mouth tingle but smooth enough to drink several if one chooses too. It's a pretty good brew in my opinion I love when the Winter season falls because it's always great to have that first Sam Adams Seasonal of that time of year."
" First, 5.5% is a bit weak-sauce for a bock. This can be summarized as initially exciting me, and then failing. The smell reminded me of cooking Christmas deserts upon opening the bottle, but once in the class hardly anything was detectable over the malt smell. Finally, initially the taste was reminiscent of mulled cider, but the body and finish were unimpressive and then that awkward flavor snuck in... Overall an alright Bock, that flopped."
"Had this on tap at the little taproom in the Spokane Airport. It was poured into a shaker pint, beer was a dark brown with a slight redish hint, sort of like barkdust (I say that in the most positive way) I cannot report accurately on the head as the server seemed to quickly dismiss it into the sink. (dummy) Due to the lacking head, I can only describe the head as having properties of darkish sweet malts and some spices. The taste was quite impressive to me. Taste is of dark malts as well as a slight wheat flavor, there are also elements of spices, very good. Mouthfeel is nice, carbonation is refreshing. Overall this is a great beer, I'll definitely be buying a 6 pack of this when winter rolls around."
"Pours a dark brown with an off white head. Aroma of caramel, roasted malt, alittle sweetness. Tastes like a pretty balanced lager, some sugary malts, faint spices and a light roasted flavor. Mellow and easy to drink. Medium bodied. Decent beer and always worth getting in the colder months."
"D- A great seasonal brew from Sam Adams. This couldn't serve as a year round brew, but a nice reminder that the holidays are near."
"taste: the taste is close to identical to the white ale in terms of spices. everything else is shoved to the side to make way for the coriander blitz approaching. there is a tinge of cinnamon which i like, and the ginger provides a nice aftertaste/encourages a slightly dry mouthfeel."
"I wouldn't buy a 6 pack of this beer, but it's a nice change of pace and a decent enough beer to enjoy in the Sam Adams Winter Pack. A good beer to sample, but not one that I'd add to my list of regulars and definitely not a session beer."
"A typical winter beer, spices and malt characterize this beer, however the taste might be a little overpowering, cannot drink many of these. I do like this beer, but find myself wanting a slightly lighter beer as winter closes, but I will seek this beer as winter arrives again."
"Summary: This is an above average beer. I gave it 7.6/10, or C. I'm a little disappointed in this beer. It's a seasonal beer, so I was expecting something special...a higher alcohol content, some holiday spiciness, or that feeling of warmth...instead I got a beer that tastes slightly better than the average winter beer. Now it is possible that maybe this was a bad batch, I don't know, all I know is what I taste. Now overall this isn't a bad beer, but it's not great either. Maybe I'll try it again next year."
"O: The relatively light body of this beer could make it one that's very easy to drink for the style but there's no way that I could have more than one of these in a sitting given all of the spices."
"Resembles a lighter-bodied and more sessionable winter warmer. A favorite of mine for the style."
"Samual Adams continues to impress with their ability to brew macro quantities with micro savoryness! This beer is a dark amber with decent head and lacing. Te smell has some roast to it, which is revealed in the flavor/taste. The mouth feel is good...which means SESSION!!! Enjoy!"
"MF- Almost a full body that's slightly crisp at the same time."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of caramelized malt with light fruity ester is very interesting. Taste is easily quaffable with notes of caramelized malt with sweet undertones and light fruity ester. Body is about average with goo carbonation. Wheat malt is not easily identifiable. Easy to drink with just enough character."
"This is a great winter lager. This beer has a good balance of spices including cinnamon, ginger, and orange zest in tandem with the caramel malt taste. I recommend this to anyone who wants to relax with a good lager on a cold winter night..."
"D: The spiciness is way overdone here because it covers up the other flavors."
"It's easy to drink, but is pretty uninteresting. It would be a decent gateway beer for someone just getting into craft beer."
"D - Very drinkable, particularly for the season."
"Served from a 12 oz bottle into a Pint glass. Poured a dark orange color. Produced a creamy white head, average retention and average lacing. Contains a spicy aroma of ginger and orange peel. This beer has a medium body, somewhat malty, it has traces of spice, mostly ginger and a slight hint of cinnamon. The beer has a nice finish."
"Drinkability is about good, easy going. Are there better things out there I would say yes."
"Poured reddish-brown in color with a big frothy light brown head that had excellent lacing. The aroma was of lightly toasted grainy malts, cloves, ginger and mild resin like hops with a medicine like odor. It taste bitter-sweet with an acidic finish that stayed with you a while. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied with a creamy texture. Overall an decent brew."
"This isn't a bad beer at all, and I still like it, but from the bottle it seriously pales in comparison with the draft version. One of my friends suggested that they may have come from two sources, and that the Boston brewery typically puts out better batches than the PA one. I'm not sure whether that guess is true, but the difference was so great that I think he's probably right."
"D= I thought the smell and taste could have been bolder, but it's still enjoyable."
"its is a very good beer on this cold night iim spending alone in my cabin. im going mad and this beer is bringing me joy! thank you mr adams! i really enjoy this! its so very flavorful and a bit spicy but thats ok it is spicy in the right way. i really appreciate this!"
"The CPJ"
"Beer poured out perfectly, perfect amount of foam that vanished fast. This is a great tasting beer to say the least. This so far has become one of my favorites. Thankfully the keg tubes were cleaned so it did not mess with the taste. Awesome beer period!"
"It poured a lightly carbonated sunset orange color with a tight, white head. There were smells of cinnamon, faint ginger, and a hint of hop spice. The taste was well balanced and not overly spiced like Harpoon. A pleasant mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, orange peel, toasted malt and some citrusy hops enveloped my taste buds. Sam Adams fluctuates the alcohol percentage of their winter lagers; this year's was low but kept it highly drinkable. Cheers!"
"Had it on tap as well as in the bottle, it's a great cold weather beer if your not into stout/porter family style brews. Pours a caramel color body with a decent 2 finger tan head. Taste is a spiced, with some cinnamon and caramel notes. Overall a easy to drink and tasty beer, can be found all over the place on tap (best way to enjoy it). I liked it so much I bought a few 12 packs over the winter."
"D - Stuff is the solid winter seasonal but I remember it being much, much better. In fact, I remember all the sam seasonals being far better in previous years, and I dont think I'm the only one with that opinion."
"Original head was not observed as it was brought to me after it was drawn. One finger head of light brown with semi dense clinging lace. Color is a 18 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell has aromas of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, toffee, and honey. Taste is well balanced with flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, toffee, spices, honey and melon. Bold and full in the mouthfeel category. Maybe a little heavy for an all nighter, but very flavorful and great for a treat."
"Feels a little heavy, even though it's a bock. Not sure if it's the yeast or the hops in this that doesn't really suit me that well. This came in a sampler pack of a few different Sam Adams brews. Will probably not buy it on its own."
"Pretty carbonated and nice and drinkable. Something I wouldn't mind trying again next winter!"
"Pours a rich, deep reddish-amber color, with a thick, creamy sand-colored head that clings to the side of the glass. The aroma is largely just a thin graininess, but there are subtle notes of sweet malts and a dull earthy hop presence underneath. The flavor is more defined, with a sweet caramel malt base contrasted by a bit of earthy, peppery hops, but it all just seems a bit stale. The added spices are not distinct themselves, but they instead build on the dull earthiness of the hops. The mouthfeel is fine, but it doesn't do anything to prop up the dull, dreary flavor profile. Overall, I finished every bottle of this beer from the winter sampler pack, but I didn't particularly enjoy them."
"I do have to say that I believe they changed their recipe along with their more obvious change of label. I actually prefer the past Winter Lagers because it really did taste more like a winter warmer or heavier bock. This Winter Lager"
"This is not quite a winter warmer but a good spiced winter beer."
"A decent, moderately spiced lager, evoking memories of the holiday season past. Given the still frigid weather hereabouts, this is a welcome tipple."
"A solid offering from Sam Adams that's perfect for warming up when it's cold outside. I will come back to this one when it's on tap and feel comfortable recommending it to fans of the style -- very good!"
"D: this represents a good middle of the road bock/christmas beer. I'll defiantly keep buying the mixed 12s and keep drinking these, but wouldn't pass the opportunity to cook with them."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours a clear copper color with a half inch of head. The aroma is a blend of cereal malt, cardamom, nutmeg and lemon rind. The taste is very similar to the aroma with the addition of some cinnamon, ginger and caramel malt flavors.The mouthfeel is low-to-medium bodied with strong carbonation and a dry, spicy finish. It's a bit over spiced for my tastes and definitely could have used a stronger ABV to hold it all together."
"From what I'm told, Samuel Adams Winter Lager was a once stupefying seasonal that has been gradually toned down over the years. While my first time trying it was only five years ago, I could then - and still do now - draw comparisons to a Belgian dubbel or German weizenbock which alone grants it more character than most beers brewed on a similar scale. In other words, no matter how good it might have once been, it's still pretty good now."
"This beer pours a beautiful head. I have had a lot of this one from bottles this winter and have wanted to try it on tap but haven't yet. It has some good taste of spices and hops. A good winter beer to get ready for some spring IPAS and one of the better ones in the winter pack."
"Drinkability: Very good beer that I would drink again. The flavors work well together and it is not too heavy. Looking forward to my next one."
"D- Despite the off taste and smell the other factors come together to make a nice beer to drink."
"I thought the smell and taste could have been bolder, but it's still enjoyable."
"Drinkability - Awwww....CHEERS TO MY MUG! This is a good beer and one i would stock. Thanks to SpinRSX for getting me into this and pushing me twds my mug! This is a great night!"
"Clear brown pour with nice head. Scents of very light spice and cherry. Aside from the light sweetness and hint of spice, this was watery in flavor in that there was not much. Mouthfeel was pretty standard, as was drinkability. Overall this particular beer was not all that great, but I'd drink it if someone bought me one."
"Nothing terribly exciting, but pretty good for a craft brewery with as big a presence as Sam Adams. Something I'm sure would go well with many different folks at the holidays / to ward off the chill. I've had better winter lagers to be sure, but this one weren't bad."
"Poured into a pint glass. Very dark amber brown color with some light tan head on it. Nice malty smell, not too strong. Sweet taste, quite a bit of caramel, bit of a bitter aftertaste - not bad though. Good medium body beer. Pretty drinkable I would say. Probably couldn't have 12 of these but 6 wouldn't be bad."
"Slightly sweet in taste, not too sweet and not too bitter. Somewhat unexceptional. Smooth finish. Good drinkability for a winter lager but this wouldn't be my first choice."
"The beer was a great, deep amber-red color, with no head. The beer was vibrant and crystal in appearance. Smells of sweet malt, with a hint of hops. The beer had flavors of caramel and old world fruit sweetness (fig and date), with toasty characteristics. Very crisp finish, with a nice, smooth, darkly sweet, fruity aftertaste."
"This is the best ofthe winter pack so far. I will happily drink this one again! (I do have a few more varieties to go!)"
"Pours a dark ruby red colour, 1/4 inch head that vanished almost immediately with no retention or lacing at all. Aromas of spicy malt, bitter hop and faint alcohol round out the nose. Palate is spicy with a good malt presence, dry hop notes and a semi sweet finish. Medium mouthfeel that is quite watery and does not linger. Drinks OK, its not offensive in any way. 1 or 2 would be good but thats about it."
"Final Thoughts: All in all a nice change of pace but nothing to write home about. Sam Adams has impressed me enough to wish they had more of a presence at the LCBO, and sincerely wish they could get a mix six pack up here. I really ought to make a trip out to Boston one of these days."
"Cheers!!"
"Overall: Not a bad seasonal offer. It is pretty balanced, not sweet, and the finish is not cloying. However, there are much better seasonal offerings. To be honest, if you want a winter beer that is not as heavy and flavor loaded, but still delivers some interesting taste, this beer is for you. However, if you are looking for a Noel style, or heavy winter beer: this is not the first thing you should grab."
"Definitely another quality brew from Sam Adams. I really like the array of flavors going on in this one. Gonna remember this one for winters to come."
"Drinkability: I don't really like a lot of Sam Adams beer, but this is one of the few that I really enjoy. It is very drinkable and the spiciness of the ginger makes it great to warm up to in the winter months."
"Weird beer, not at all what was expected, no aroma, way more flavor than a lager usually has, classified as a bock not a winter warmer, and strangely flavored not in a bad way though. Worth picking up just for all of the contradictions going on in it."
"A nice winter beer, well ballanced between malty, spicy and hops. Very drinkable."
"D: Quite enjoyed it. My favorite of the Sam Adams Winter Pack."
"mouthfeel is light and slightly under carbonated, overall a fairly drinkable very strict to the style representation."
"Cheeers!"
"This beer seemed to not be quite what I was expecting in almost all categories. The smell was weaker than I expected, and the beer was not as much of a ""warm you up"" winter beer as I had expected. Although it wasn't what I expected, the taste was still good, and it is a easy drinker. All-in-all, it is a solid beer."
"Drinkability - not hard to put more than a few of these away, a very high quality brew for a reasonable price."
"this is a wonderful beer for a chilly night."
"It is easy to drink a few of those, but as a seasonal brew, I would hope, that next year the Boston Brewing Company would take a look at some of our micro breweries."
"Overall: Not the best winter lager out there, quite average in nature and obviously geared more for frequent imbibement."
"Hmmm...was underwhelmed here, but I should know better than to let my expectations rise due to a national advertising campaign. I just don't put the Boston Beer Co in the same camp as other macros (I suppose they really are at this point) and was expecting a bit more. Flavor? Yes, more please."
"D: Very drinkable and warming great for a cold winters evening."
"overall it was alright, again i have had better but it worked. no real complaints."
"Had a few bottles at the airport waiting for a flight. Poured into a pint glass. Deep amber but clear with a thin head. Smelled mostly of malt if anything at all and taste was the same. Solid easy to drink winter brew. Easy to have a few and the standout option at the mini pub in the airport."
"Amber in color with sharp clarity. Big head with decent retention, leaving spotted lacing. Smell is malty and spicy. Toasted and caramel malts, ginger and a little cinnamon. Flavor profile follows the nose but the spices are a little less prominent. Medium body with plenty of carbonation. Unlike many spiced up brews, this one goes down easy. Solid winter option from BBC."
"Very good beer. Starts off with a nice poor, not too much head, but that's ok from a winter beer. Lots of flavors going on with this beer, very festive and spicy. Drinkability is also very high which is impressive considering it's a darker beer. In the end the wheat adds a nice subtle touch that finishes this beer off nicely."
"I remember when this beer was bigger. I brought it to a party once and nobody liked it, they thought it was too strong. I don't think they would complain today since this beer still has the same flavor profile it once had, but the intensity of those flavors have been dialed down. It's still a decent beer, though."
"Flavor is spicy and full with caramel flavors, a touch of citrus, and some puckering cinnamon. The body is full, maybe too full, with moderate carbonation. The finish is a bit cloying which knocks a few points off, but otherwise this is a decent seasonal that I don't mind in the mixed pack."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Impression: Like most of SA beers it is not outstanding and has no major flaws. For the price it's okay. Recommended only if you're crazy for this style."
"D - An enjoyable offering. I've had 4 of 6 and looking forward to to the other two."
"very unusual beer flavors. a definite change of taste. quite decent."
"2.5 D: Having had several of these in a night, I can say it's not the most drinkable. After a while, it gets a bit cloying without keeping my tastebuds too excited. Pretty mediocre overall."
"Good winter beer as the name suggest, towards the end had a slight warming feeling, very enjoyable."
"D: Exceptional. I could drink this all day. Very clean, crisp taste. Entices the nose & makes the taste buds want more. Very good Winter beer."
"It's an easy taste with a balance of hops that favors the malts and lets them shine, Sam Adams Winter Lager is a bock for the cold weather. And a highly drinkable one at that."
"I liked this beer. A solid, but not too powerful flavor. This could definitely be a session beer. And it went perfect with my pork roast!"
"This was a nice beer to enjoy with dinner,however, not one of my top of the list bocks."
"Had on tap at an Olive Garden restaurant. I do not like eating at chain style restaurants,but had no choice. Beer selection was pretty poor- I think this was the best choice. Looked ok in the 20 oz glass and it was only $5. A slight malty smell,but not much aroma. Taste was kinda bland- sorta sweet with cinnamon & some spice with a slightly thick mouthfeel. I did not order another one."
"Poured out of the fridge, color is copper with a streak of crimson, 1-finger head reduces to an impressive thin beige head, nicer-than-average lacing. Aroma of clove spice, and wheat bread. Taste is bready, a little stale, but with a malty dry finish -- no surprise that it's a lager. Mouthfeel is not so hot, and it brings the drinkability down."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. At smaller bars that don't have a big selection, this is a top pick for me. I can, and have, enjoyed this beer for a whole night."
"Not the best offering from the Boston Beer Company I've had. Poured a reddish amber with some foamy head that lasted only briefly. There was not much smell to speak of with this beer. Maybe could pick up some strained hops. Taste was fair, had some bitterness to it but was not overwhelming and nothing stood out. The mouthfeel was dry and left some lingering bitter aftertaste. Worth a try, but wont be going out of my way for more."
"Drinkability - Somewhat bland and tasteless. I like many of BB's brews, but this one seems to have stretched them a bit thin."
"A very pleasant beer to enjoy on a cold night. I believe I enjoyed last year's a bit more though. I don't know if the ingredients are any different, or if my palate expects more these days."
"D- Simple but good. Too much alcohol for a long session, but perhaps good for a shorter warming session in front of the fire with a good book."
"Samuel Adams is a wonderful beer during the holiday season. It is probably the best beer during the holiday season. It is a malt beverage which is what makes it even better. It is Cinnamon flavored. It is only available in small beer stores for a limited amount of time. I wait all year around for this to come out. It may be the best Samuel Adams seasonal beer."
"This beer never wowed me, but it's pretty enjoyable, tastes good."
"D-this is easy drinking, decent body to it with some assertive malt presence. doesn't have much hop presence or wheat presence but still easy to drink."
"Under a finger of beige head settles over mahogany and ruby hues. Aroma is relatively sweet malt and spices. Flavors fall a little flat. There's spiciness but it's a straightforward malt breadiness otherwise. The carbonation's a little too high, otherwise the mouthfeel seems right. Small cap of retention and a tad bit of lacing. This beer's okay ... the spice is really all that's ""wintery"" about it, though."
"D-Decent drinkability though getting a bit of a metallic sense in the aftertaste which I find commonly in lager styles."
"D: I could honestly drink this all day long. Many have stated in forums that this brew was not what it used to be.... etc..etc...etc. That may be so, but I can't speak to that. All I know is that the brew I just had (and have had many times this winter season) was excellent!"
"D - Very good. I easily had several in one sitting."
"D. Drinkable for sure. This is the kind of beer you can have quite a few of. Not an amazing beer by any accounts, but not bad either."
"D - I could kick back with a few of these. Nothing to crazy going on here but a solid brew that I'll probably have again before the seasons change."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about brew was the full look and blend of Christmas spice. The latter is apparent in both the aroma and the taste, giving us something that is seasonally appropriate and fitting for the weather. For the style it is arguably weak in the robustness category, but it certainly does not disappoint."
"Very drinkable because it is so mild. But that's the problem, it just doesn't stand out, even from other wheat ales. Good solid construction, just not eye (mouth?) - catching."
"I'm glad this beer came to Ontario this year. Pours a clear amber-brown colour with white head that dissipates without too much lacing. Smells of caramel with mild spicing. Very mild bitterness, but more sweetness. A very balanced winter beer, without the spices dominating too much. Smooth mouthfeel. Very nice beer."
"D - Good, 6 pack will do for now, makes you want to take another drink"
"D: Easy to drink. Low in booze, not too heavy."
"Not too spicy and yet not completely bland, an inoffensive and pleasantly drinkable mild winter seasonal beer."
"The Rest: Body is just on the thin side of medium and drinkability is good. This is a pretty unoffensive, easy-drinking lager that's been spiced-up a bit."
"Pours a clear copper amber with a nice two fingered light tan head, thin lacing chasing the beverage out. A light malt and spice hints on the nose, very subduded. On the palate, sweet roasted malts and a white pepper fusion the ends in a dry metallic finish, very complex. A little heavy for a lager, fair enough carbonation, but hell I liked it!"
"Not the least drinkable beer I've ever had."
"D - This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down pretty easily, but overall this is a pretty forgettable beer. I think it would have helped if it was a bit heavier, and the flavors stood out more. I would give this beer another shot, if I didn't have to pay for it."
"Yup, a nice spiced bock... crisp and easy to drink with an interesting flavor profile. It's a little thin and watery to me, but a well put together beer."
"D/M: smooth on the pallet, strong carbonation, slight depth of flavor helps drinkability but lack of outstanding characteristics hurt the brew slightly"
"D: A tasty and refreshing brew, but perhaps a little too much by way of flavorings."
"D - A pleasant beer to enjoy at a party."
"D - You can down quite a few of these with ease. Very delicious beer."
"I'd drink it with a meal if it was around, otherwise, eh."
"Very enjoyable beer but a little on the filling side. 2-3 would be plenty"
"The flavors are faint but I like it. I don't know if I'm being biased but this is a nice drinkable winter lager. I'm actually sitting in front of a fire and staring at a Christmas tree enjoying this so that may have some influence."
"I should remember that ""Bock"" is a style of lager, but when the label(s) scream(s) ""Lager", I default to the Greg Koch ""fizzy yellow sissy beer"" expectation, sometimes to be pleasantly surprised, as in this case. I got a finger of deep-tan head with good retention off of my pour. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. I have seen pennies that were less copper-colored than this beer. I was reminded (again) of the beauteous Linda Lou, a striking redhead whose hair was not only this color, but hers was also as coarse as wire. Sigh. She left me while I was on a seven-month deployment to marry somebody other than me. My beer may taste faintly of salty tears. Boo hoo. Nose smelled of ginger (OK, now a reference might be getting old), cinnamon and nutmeg. I was reminded of baking cookies with my maternal grandmother as a kid. The other kids used to make fun of me for my culinary endeavors until they tried what I had made. I still like to cook, just not for by myself. If only I had Linda Lou for whom to make meals ... Mouthfeel was big, thick, creamy. You should really brace yourself for this one. The spices were simply alive on the tongue, each getting a turn on the ol' palate. It was like eating one of those cookies. The finish left me in a melancholy, nostalgic mood but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Good news, also, for my followers - it CAN be purchased outside of the Winter Sampler, unlike Old Fezziwg. Try some for yourself."
"This beer pours a clear, deep, amber color with finger thick head and lasting lace. The aroma has hints of vanilla, spices, and caramel. The flavor begins with ginger followed by malt sweetness and cinnamon notes. It's got a medium full mouthfeel whan combined with the flavor gives it a high drinkability. Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a very good beer and is a good compliment for steak. Highly recommended!"
"D- Extremely drinkable. It is going down like im in a frat house"
"The smooth, malty flavor is very pleasant and leaves very little aftertaste, making this beer very drinkable. Overall, this is an excellent mainstream ""winter"" beer that most anyone can enjoy."
"D - Pleasantly surprised, as I really wasn't expecting much going in. Nice character overall, but it gets a little too sweet for me by the end."
"Overall - Winter Lager, IMO is the best of the pure Sam Seasonals (i.e. Noble Pils, Summer Ale, Octoberfest, and this). I always find myself drinking some during the winter, even with the plethora of other great winter and Christmas beers out there. This beer isn't remarkable, but it's solid."
"Verdict: Not disappointing for a winter brew. It has enough complex flavors for me and most everybody without being a hard drinker. At some times thin and not very intense with flavor, it still remains a fairly impressive Sam Adams beer and I wouldn't mind making it a winter season regular. B (3.7)"
"Like many have said I am also a sucker for Sam Adams seasonal beers, but this is definitely my favorite. The bottle tastes like it has been handcrafted individually just for the person who is consuming it. The mixture of spices in the beer is perfect...not to much and not to little."
"I would rather have the regular Sam Adams, but not by too much."
"i am a sucker for all of sam adams seasonals- i like the octoberfest better than the winter lager- but that being said, the winter lager is still a very solid beer. there is a deep citrus flavor mixed with some holiday spices and just the right amount of bitterness. sam adams winter lager is truly a great cold weather drink."
"This Winter Lager pours a medium dark amber color with a good long lasting head. Right away you take in the scents of malts and hops. Upon tasting there is a fantastic mixture of spices. Absolutely delightful on a cold winter night."
"Overall is decently enjoyable. The beer is worthy of the season."
"Drinkability: Far less 'spiced' that I expected and in that, it's easy to drink."
"Cheers!"
"As much as I want to really like this beer, there's just a few characteristics that bring it down."
"M/D: a medium bodied feel with the usual mass craft drinkability."
"I definitely lose a bit in the mouthfeel here. The body is medium but feels a touch fuller to me, and carbonation is adequate to add to the smooth feel but not too much to go beyond that."
"D: Nothing would prevent easy drinking except for my dislike of the taste. I could have multiple, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"D. I don't have a problem drinking this beer - it just doesn't have much flavor. Given that, one is enough for me."
"I picked this up because it was cheap and I just wanted a not so complex brew to enjoy while reading. This was perfect. I didn't spend the entire time trying to detect every subtle quality, I was able to just enjoy. When I want a break from more complex brews, this would be one I would go to."
"Medium body and carbonation. Dry, with a bitter, almost sour aftertaste. Not bad, but not a beer I will go out of my way to get again."
"D - Drinks great for a winter ale, not bad, not bland, not too spicy, Good balance for wonderful winter action. Easy to drink, but not water."
"Easy drinking, but uneventful. A nice beer to share with friends."
"Pretty good lager, could session this and enjoy it. Nothing to go wild over but I could see having this again in the future."
"Overall, quite a nice little lager. I enjoy these winter and fall lagers so much more (on the whole) than run-of-the-mill lagers. There's so much more flavour and depth to them, without them getting so complex that they overwhelm you. A great beer to just sit and drink on the holidays. Now... how come they can get this in Newfoundland and not in PEI? We're so much closer!"
"Overall: a really good beer. I liked this beer more than their boston lager, and would highly recommend this beer not only for taste but it was pretty well priced. Drank while eating almonds."
"Mouthfeel is very satisfying as the richness of the beer imparts a satisfying warming quality as I drink. Drinkability is excellent. This is a great go-to winter seasonal that is also a nice accompaniment to hearty winter stews."
"Sam Adam has consistent visually appealing beer. The clarity is impressive. Burgundy color, over a white head. decent carbonation. Head retention is below average. Has a clean lager smell. nice malt character to the aroma as well. Flavor is similar to the nose. Spiced clean flavor. Sooo much better than the double bock from S.A. Brewing Co. Decent viscosity to the beer, suiting mouthfeel. Very similar to pumpkin beers of the fall, with out pumpkin and with lager yeast. I am surprised how much I enjoyed this beer."
"D: I'm definitely a biased ale man, so lagers aren't exactly my cup-o-tea (or ale, I guess ha.) So with that in mind, it's a little easier to understand my criticism with lager drinkability. It's certainly one of the best American lagers that I've had (along with Yeungling), and it has a nice, full flavor. However, its ultimate lack of real complexity coupled with my finding it a bit cloying keeps me from reaching for another. Definitely one of my go-to lagers, though, and one I keep going back to around the Holiday season (especially considering its inclusion in the Sam Adams Holiday sampler.)"
"Drinkability: Nicely balanced and a lower ABV than traditional Bocks make this a nice holiday brew."
"A very drinkable winter lager. It's not as jam-packed with Christmas spices as other winter ales, but what is there is nice and in decent balance. I'd never buy a bottle, but when the tap list isn't too impressive, this is a brew that can be relied on."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, malty lager standardness, hints of spice, mainly cinnamon. In the taste, cinnamon stands out with a standard lager undertones. A small cinnamon bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry cinnamon aftertaste. Big cinnamon and still quite lager like, average."
"This is my favorite brew out of the holiday pack. It has a deep dark red color with medium almond head. Malty smell with some caramel. The flavor and drinkability are off the charts. Not as spicy as some xmas brews, but thats why I love it. Christmas Ale from Great Lakes is very good, but this goes down easier for me. One of my favorite Sam Adams"
"D - the nose seemed a little plain but the spices and light hops really round out the flavours, easy drinking enough to be a nice winter session beer"
"Overall this is pretty much a last resort for places that don't carry craft beer. I'd take the standard Boston Lager over this every time."
"Poured from the bottle a amber color with a thin off white head that faded and left trace amount of lacing for the remainder of the beer. Smell is of caramel and toasted malt some citrusy hops and a faint cinamin/herbaly spice note. Taste is mostly sweet bready malt with a hint of cinamin and spice with a tiny citrusy hoppy twang. This beer seems subdoed from years past. Mouthfeel is clean and light, very light bodied beer. Drinkability is quite easy on this one nothing too comples or over spiced, good balance but I could have used a bit more body and presence by the spice and hops in this beer."
"D: Very high, not much to this one."
"Just okay, would not buy in a 6er."
"I got a growler of this to enjoy during a football game, and it's an easy-drinking brew in both decency and the abv is low enough to not ""kill"" you prior to finishing it! Cheers!!!"
"It would be easy to drink a six pack of this in one sitting. Another good holiday one from Sam Adams."
"Drinkabilty - Anyone could drink this beer all night and not get sick with it. I would rather stick to my craft beers and sample many throughout the night. But then again, Samuel Adams isn't my favorite brewery. With my ongoing pattern of trying holiday/winter ales, I discovered this one was lowest on my list so far."
"The beer pours a reddish-brown color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is ginger and cinnamon with some toffee and wheat mixed in. A little bit spicier than I was expecting. The flavor is just like the aroma. I get some wheat, ginger, cinnamon, caramel and toffee. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Pretty good, but nothing too exciting."
"Overall its pretty average, I would buy it again though, and it definitely is nice and comforting to curl up with under a blanket with the dog while watching some football."
"I have never been a huge fan of Sam Adams line of brews but this one was decent and more drinkable to me than some their other brews. Perhaps it was a good tapping at the pub which I had it. Still plenty of flavor, but much more drinkable and smooth than say their Boston Ale. Very light hop aftertaste. Nice color. Good beer Jim!"
"I was dissapointed with this beer. It poured an amber color with a tan head that went away very quicly. At first taste I get the hops bitterness and then I taste the ginger. I think the bitterness also comes from the orange peel. I bought a six pack and I think that's all I really need of this beer. This beer was very average in every way and nothing stood out."
"D - I could definitely kick back with a few of these. Nothing to crazy going on here but a solid brew that I'll probably have again before the seasons change."
"Samuel Adams continues to amaze. Winter Lager is fantastic."
"Drunk straight from the bottle. Caramel malty flavor, enough hops to neutralize the sweetness. Otherwise pretty watery. My recollection was of a beer with more body and malt backbone. Mouthfeel has some carbonation but doesn't have the crispness of other lagers. Very drinkable though."
"Overall: solid beer, good option for a winter brew. The spices are not overpowering, which can be a problem with some spiced beers. I feel it is best with an aggressive pour and a couple min to warm up."
"Drinkability- has a clean finish that makes me want more..."
"Sam Adams does it once again. i will admit that i am a very big fan of their beers specially for a high end beer with such a beautiful colorful top, the body presents a beautiful amber color. it's smell of orange ginger and grounded cinnamon. the taste is smooth very refreshing experience, its not lame or dry. this kind of beer will creep up on you. you cant drink real fast or down them you got to take exceptional sips to enjoy its lusty aroma. i will admit it is one of my favorite seasonals yet."
"O- All in all a good beer. Significantly different on tap than in bottle."
"The foam was dark wheat in color and dissapated quickly. The color was a brown burgandy with carmel highlights. Smell was of a dominate yet subtle hops aroma with hints of orange peel, spices and licorice. Taste was of a dominate orange hops underlined by spices like licorice, anise and nutmeg. Mouthfeel - medium-bodied and crisp. Drinkability - not too bad a beer for the holidays due to the spice flavors, but a little too 'watered down' for my taste."
"12 oz bottle from Sam Adams winter pack. Pours deep mahogany with a large off-white head. Nice carbonation. Aroma is caramel malt with spicy hops in the background. Medium, oily body. Flavor is spicy hops balanced by caramel malt and some brown sugar. Long finish becomes dry. Good all around beer."
"D-Could drink all day and night, puts me right in the Christmas mood"
"Overall: Good beer overall. Another solid offering from Sam Adams. Not my favorite beer they've put out, but it's worth a shot."
"Final thoughts: Disappointed; replace this with Fezziwig and Sam Adams with have some pretty decent seasonals."
"Drinkability: Pretty delicious, but substatial enough to encourage savoring."
"The beer pours a deep amber color, almost brown with a white head. The aroma smells of caramel malts and a faint hint of hops. The taste is sweet, an interesting combination of hops and malt. The mouthfeel is medium light. Overall this is an outstanding bock."
"Drinkability - This beer is ok. I like the plain ol' Boston Lager better however. This is a decent little change. Probably wouldn't want to make this my dominant beer, but at times and in moderation is ok."
"very drinkable, cheap and widely available, but IMHO, not really worth buying. too one dimensional like most SA brews. drank this lone bottle at a friends house."
"Tawny amber color with thin, white head that dissipates quickly. Muted, bready malt aromas with a pleasing crispness and ample caramel malt. Clean malt flavors, toasty and slightly nutty; more caramel abounds. Hop bitterness balances the maltiness nicely, without much in the way of any real hop flavor. Crisp, dry mouthfeel. A very drinkable, sturdy beer; a winter classic in my book."
"Kind of a beer that doesn't seem like all that much at first, but with consideration and appreciation for the subtle, is quite good. Poured with a giant, foamy, frothy, fluffy, light tan head that lasts a while and lots of lace. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is malt, caramel, and toffee. Flavor is like nose and is not too sweet allowing the subtle drier roast malt to show a bit. Body is ok and caroboantion is good. Finish is like flavor and a tad on the short side. Easy drinking session beer."
"Glad to have tried it and I would like to continue trying more seasonal lagers since most of the seasonal beers I've tried so far have been pale ales."
"low to medium bodied moutfeel with average carbonation. the first couple drink well, then boredom starts to set in."
"The appearance is amber with a medium head. The aroma is malty and somewhat hoppy with a bit of adjuncts and caramel. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall this is a drinkable beer and not bad but not great. I have to say I would drink it again."
"Pours dark brown with some foam. Smell has a little bit of dried fruit, but also a baked bread-like aroma. The taste is solid, sweet and with some malty notes. I recall this being better in years past. Medium bodied and smooth, it is a decent beer for the cold months. I think the Sam Adams has beeter offerings however."
"D- Nothing offensive and well-balanced. Enjoyable."
" The taste is ok. Its slightly sweet and malty, but has that wet cardboard taste to it. There is a hint of spice, but I can't put my finger on it. The mouthfeel is actually not bad, a little fuller than I would have expected. The finish lingers, tastes like wet cardboard."
"DB- Reminds me a lot of the Fezziwig which I had last night. This one definitely has a more pronounced grainy, bready feel to it though. Drinks decently but not something I would go back to often."
"D - Very drinkable beer. The flavors are all fairly balanced, but just a little dull. The mouthfeel is pretty crisp which makes it a refreshing beer."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, but has a thick mouthfeel. Overall, its fine. Nothing too special imo."
"Overall, I was not too impressed with this beer. It had a taste that could easily get lost in the shuffle of holiday beers. There was nothing that made this beer stand out. I cannot see myself purchasing another 6pck. If this was on-tap at a bar with limited options I would probably order it."
"First sip... You know it's a Sam Adams. It possesses that familiar Sammy A taste. It pours a great thick head that you expect from the Boston Beer Company. Smell is average with a hint of something found in a maier bock. However the taste is very different. A warm fruity collection of spices hits your palette at the perfect moment. Very enjoyable and not over done like in past years. A full flavored and certainly drinkable winter brew. Bravo Samuel Adams."
"Picked up the Sam Adams winter sampler mostly to review beers I've had before. Winter Lager is a straight-forward amber lager, not a whole lot going on. Want something more than a pale lager but not too heavy? This could workl"
"Well it's more of a spiced bock than anything else, there's lots of holiday spices, it's right in your face but not overpowering which makes it easy drinking and quite tasty. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and chewy with a nice sharp carbonation."
"Decent brew, but entirely too malty for me. I'd like it to be a little more balanced with hops, as my favorite Bocks are. But good for the price."
"Ok, I can't get with this brew. Looks great in the glass, but the flavor was off-putting to me. I found an odd sourness to the taste, especially the finish. Maybe it's the added flavors I wasn't digging. I'm obviously in the minority, but this beer just didn't work for me."
"This beer is simply delicious, and rates very high on my list of favorite brews. Almost all of the Samuel Adams brand is good to excellent, and this is no exception. I consider this to be a great beer worthy of your time and money. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
"This beer pours a really nice dark amber color, with a small head. It smells like the regular lager with a bunch of spices. Has a full body flavor, lots of spices, a nice strong lager taste. Easy to drink, but low with the carbondation. Overall a really good beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Pretty light bodied, the carbonation is moderate and pretty smooth overall. This is a pretty easy drinking beer. A good offering from SA."
"cheers"
"D: an enjoyable winter bock. Not filling at all and truly leaves you wanting more - maybe that aftertaste is what does it. I would certainly have this as a sipping beer for an evening"
"Final Notes: Definitely on the somewhat lighter side when it comes to winter beers. A great session beer and one to pair with either a big Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, drank after dinner as a dessert beer, or paired with either a caramel or chocolate dessert. The ABV is not overkill (5.8%) and the flavors are very good."
"D: Clean, balanced taste. Smooth, light mouthfeel. Easy to drink."
"d- overall this is a pretty good beer it has clean tastes and is a good change of pace for the season"
"12 bottle poured into shaker glass. Poured a darker copper color with decent head and lots of bubbles. Aroma of spices and malt. Taste of malt, caramel, sweetness, and a touch of cinnamin. Definitely one of SA's better brews that I look forward to getting a taste of every winter."
"D- Would be a good cross over beer for the die hard American Macro Lager types."
"D- I for some reason think this may be Sam Adams best beer. I used to think it could be sold year round, but perhaps with all the spice it is best that it is a winter beer."
"This lager pours a red-tinged amber with little foam. There also appears to be very little carbonation. The taste is very light and void of taste for a beer of this color. A biscutty maltiness dominates the taste with faint spices in the finish. Every year I try it and every year I walk away mildly disappointed."
"Pours a clear mahogany with an average sized off white head. Head recedes pretty quickly and leaves little to no lacing behind. Smell is malt with a subtle spiciness to it. Taste is again lots of malts with some dark fruits and a hint of spice as well, not sure exactly what though. A good beer but overall just kind of average, which certainly isn't a bad thing. Definitely a drinkable brew though, could easily knock back a few of these."
"Clear deep amber color, off white head that dissapears quick. Lots of carbonation. Smells of spices and malt, good smell. Tastes of malts, spices and hops, good taste. Slight bitter aftertaste, not bad. Can drink 2 or 3 of these in a row. Noticed on the label this year that its in color and states that it is a ""malt beverage"". Has it always said that? I dont remember."
"This one pours a dark hickory in color with a light off white head. It's pretty thin in consistency. The smell is just so-so. It smells of light malt, slight wheat, and light spices. The taste is better. It's pretty sweet and a little dry. It has moderate maltiness and has a maple like sweetness. It drinks pretty light and crisp. It's ok, nothing special and is easy to drink, although I don't think I'd want to have another one."
"Very nice looking beer. Its amber in color moderately carbonated. Definitely smell the spices coming through with a hint of pumpkin. Not overwhelming on the hops. The spices and pumpkin aroma continue to the palate. Has a medium thickness. Good beer."
"d - A decent bock that is widely available and easy to drink. Can definitely drink a few of these and while not my favorite, something I can drink at Thanksgiving with non BA's and we can all enjoy. I enjoyed the smell and would have it again."
"This is an interesting one. The flavors are really not all that palate pleasing and I'm not crazy about it, but the mouthfeel is pretty solid and all in all, it's not a bad iteration of a winter lager. I'd take it over SABL any day."
"Drinkability - this one is very high on the drinkability scale. I could have these one after the other with no problem whatsoever. It's a nice Winter Lager, but I wish there was just a bit more oomph to it, maybe some more spices to kick it up a notch."
"Pours a nice amber with small white head. Aroma of spices, cinnamon, sweet malts, caramel. Taste is the same as aroma. Palate is crisp, good carbonation. Finish is sweet spices, some cinamon with some slight bitter hoppiness to add some balance. Overall a very nice winter seasonal."
"D: Another great seasonal from Samuel Adams. Looking to get more of this during the winter."
"Nice appearance. Very nice smell. Nice blend of flavors. Very nice mouthfeel. Everything about this fits great for what I know of bocks. Pretty decent. I would recommend this to others."
"d- good brew to drink with a Holiday meal, but theres just a lot of better choices other than this around. Nothing too special though. definitly not worth seeking out or paying a lot for."
"12oz bottle with a Best Before Date notched at Apr. From the Samuel Adams Winter Classics mix 12 pack. Pours a dirty copper color with very little head. Aromas of caramel, spices, and malt. Taste is mostly of spices with some caramel and malt mixed in. Slight bit of orange peel bite to it. This beer is a bit thin. Overall its an alright beer that fits the season well."
"Drinkability: Although it is tasty, I didn't find this one to be extremely drinkable. About 2 or 3 of these and I'm ready to move on to something else."
"D- This is damn good. I'm shocked, but I shouldn't be. Definitely a suggestion to craft enthusiasts and novices alike. Samuel Adams has always been a solid beer up until now, why wouldn't I enjoy their winter offering?"
"Pours a medium-dark red with a fingers worth of tan head. Smells are spices up front, maybe slight clove and cardamon. I also smell some sweet malt, and maybe some ginger. Tastes are spices at the front, same as the nose, some ginger slight clove and that strange green apple yeastiness I've been picking up in Sam Adams beers lately. Mouthfeel is medium and this is very drinkable."
"Poured a clear brown in color with reddish highlights that had a half finger of head and left some good lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma seemed to have a good spice kick like cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and brown sugar. It also had a good fruity malty aroma with slight hop character. The taste was pretty similar with fruity malts cinnamon brown sugar accents but it did have a little hop flavor on the backend. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, spice, and slight creamy finish. It drank pretty good and its definitely starting to feel a lot like christmas after drinking some of this brew; solid back brew."
"D: A solid beer with decently distinctive character."
"A pretty decent beer. Nothing special, but I wasn't disappointed and it went pretty well with the meal. I would have liked something a bit richer, but for a lager I really can't complain."
"D: A very pleasant winter brew, it did not knock my socks off, but worth trying."
"Taste: Thin and artificial. Nondescript maltiness up front that quite bland and flavorless but not super sweet. In the middle the carbonation becomes more prevalent and there is a lifeless ripe fruit flavor with a banana edge and faint spices. Finish is short, semisweet, and spicy."
"As a side note, I hate to be one of those guys who complain that this year's seasonal isn't as good as last year's seasonal, but it should be noted that the formulation of the Winter Lager has changed in recent years. At one time this was a super malty 6.9% ABV warmer. I hadn't had this in a few years, and I remembered it being very malty and sweet and perhaps a bit more subtle with the spices. That's not to say that it used to be better, because this is very good on its own terms. It's just different than you may remember if you haven't tried this in a while. I still recommend it."
"D: Very easy to drink many of these, though that may not be all that positive. I was expecting a little more bite to this one, but didn't get it. This was one of the beers that got me into darker/heavier beers, though i seem to remember it having more bite to it, though my palate was young."
"Very drinkable. Came as 2 of a seasonal 12 pack--now I have to see if they sell them in sixers."
"Without the spices this might be a great summer beer. With them it's just odd and not good for a hot day or a cold one. Could go well with some dessert but who buys a beer for the 2-3 times a year they do that?"
"Body is a frothy medium that evaporates quick, could easily throw these back, but why?"
"Medium body, high carbonation, mild dryness. Decent drinking, although the combo of cinnamon and citrus is a little weird. Pretty average overall, and not one of the better SA beers."
"Mouthfeel with good carbonation and malt undertones. Surprising that this is a winter lager as its fairly light and drinkable. Good beer."
"D-I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but it's pretty good."
"D. This is a very drinkable beer that will be very satisfying to a lot of people that like this kind of beer."
"D- Drink ability is relatively high as this is a very safe beer. It's well balanced and delicious, but quite neutral. I could drink more than a few of these back to back, but after a while the ginger may begin to pose a problem."
"No hard feelings to Sam Adams--they produce a solid line, but this one is lower on my list than the rest."
"It is an interesting brew, not really a bock, but what else woudl you call it."
"Drinkability> Easy"
"Fairly heavy carbonation. Easy drinking brew."
"I had Samuel Adams Winter Lager in a bar in Lexington, KY and sadly it was the best thing they had. I'm not much on Bocks. Its a beer style that is kind of a palate cleanser, but the spices came through just enough for this winter lager hit the spot."
"Overall this was a good beer, but nothing I would rave about though. The flavors are very balanced and unoffensive. I don't think i would by a six pack of this but I don't mind the 2 that they throw into their winter variety pack. This beer is better then the white ale that's for sure."
"12/14/12: The 2012 version of this beer is not nearly as good as the '10 or even the '11 and I feel the difference is significant enough to warrant a note on this review. The delicious spicy finish is MIA in this version, much more subtle. Hops are more prevalent as well. I would lower my previous flavor grade from 4 on the '10 to a 3 on this version."
"The main thing that stuck out for me was that the head and lacing were phenomenal. I poured the perfect pint into a Sam Adams glass myself and the head stayed for minutes and the lacing was impressive. It did everything it was supposed to pretty well, but unfortunately, personally I'm just not into the taste. Seemed almost skunky to me so maybe mine was just old but it didn't go down easy for me."
"Mouthfeel seemed a little heavy on the carbonation, but the aftertaste was clean and malt forward. This is an OK beer, but overall nothing special."
"Notes: Out of the Sam Adams Winter Sampler"
"D-for a winter beer, very drinkable. More of session beer for the colder time of year I guess."
"i love trying seasonal beers. i had this one at a bar on tap. the color is good, looks very rich. the taste is equally rich. very creamy taste. it is a beer that you can tell is one brewed for christmas time. i wouldnt want to drink more than one of these in a night as it is very very sweet."
"Pours a deep ruby burgundy color with an off white head and a generous amount of lacing. Smells of cinnamon and a little hops. Tastes very sweet with some evening out by the mild hops, hints of cinnamon and nutmeg and good malt character. Mouthfeel is very nice. And drinkability is high. A good offering from Sam Adams."
"Light and drinkable."
"D - Pretty drinkable beer with only a 5.6% ABV. Although it does have a nice flavor, and the ABV isn't high. Due to the complexity of the flavor, I couldn't see myself drinking more than 2-3 of these in a sitting before I became sick of it."
"It isn't as forward on the flavors as I recalled. This makes it not quite as good as Old Fezziwig in my opinion as a winter warmer."
"Overall this is a a solid beer."
"Overall: A decent brew, not terribly complex or interesting. Worth a try."
"D - Very drinkable and widely available on tap as a seasonal just about anywhere."
"Overall: I never miss SAWL when it hits the shelves - a great goto winter brew. It's always a hit with BCMers when I take some to a MMA/football watch party. Two bummers though - SA, why did you change the label guys? The new label looks like spring! The old label, while a bit boring, represented the cold snowy blustery nights of winter with it's color alone. The other bummer is that one pump and done head. Even with a hardcore pour, that's all you get. Still, I dig this brew."
"Well balanced but rather bland."
"A nice winter beer, but it pretty much tastes like Boston Lager with spices added to it."
"D - Heavy but drinkable, I don't think I would want more than two of these in a session, however."
"Reddish brown color, almost flat very little carbonation. Head disappeared on contact. Very sweet and malty to the nose with hints of orange zest and cinnamon. This beer is spiced with cinamon and ginger, orange peels come up. Besides that it is very malty and it is heavy. Mouthfeel is medium to thick zero bubble feel. Minimal hop drying and presence. Surpisingly drinkable though. Solid seasonal beer."
"Drinkability: quite quaffable. Flavor is not overpowering and the overall experience is quite refreshing."
"D: I was surprised by this one. All the spices work really well. Not a bad brew overall."
"D- an easy drinking beer, nothing really special but a solid brew in its own right."
"D - Well thankfully I only have one more since I only sprung for the half case but it really hasn't improved much from last year. Still mostly lager in taste and if I wanted a lager I would take the Boston since it at least carries more sweetness."
"Drinks a bit above average as well. I'd buy again, good for holiday festivities to be sure."
"Workin' my way through the Winter Styles pack. This one pours a nice clear dark ruby brown topped by nearly a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises caramel, light roasted malts, light milk chocolate, rye bread, and orange zest. The taste is very similar, but a bit spicier: Newcomers nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander, and cola add some complexity to the flavor, but seem to somewhat overshadow the other parts. Or, rather, it comes in phases. However you prefer to hear it, everything doesn't mesh perfectly. Yeah. The body is a nice medium, with a moderate carbonation and a semi-grainy feel. Overall, a very nice brew, one that could use some tweaking, but is still an easy and enjoyable drinker."
"Notes: nothing extreme here and no ingredients that dominate the nose or palate. just a balanced but shifting brew. good concept of a winter bock"
"Drinkability: Okay - I think this really isn't a bock but is instead more like an attempt at a watered down winter warmer. The spices become more of a bitter finish as the beer warms up - I dunno...maybe it a bock lager after all but the spices take away from it. I probably won't get again - there are better winter beers out there."
"If given one again I would probably pair it against something sweet"
"D-well...considering there are no negative tastes in it and the taste doesn't diminish...its fairly drinkable. not sure i feel the need to buy more tho"
"- Overall not too bad, but doesn't stand out much among the others in the holiday pack...."
"The performance is just not sure in any one aspect, it isn't cohesive. It feels too easy. I wish I could have tasted it as a meatier 7% guy as I've seen it mentioned it was in the past. I respect Sam Adams, but I'm afraid they've gone close to the lowest common denominator here."
"Overall: Not a bad showing by SA. Not a show stopper but quite quaffable for a bock."
"The mouthfeel is good, certainly full bodied. Rich, well balanced and full of flavor. A perfect winter beer, especially if you're not particularly in the mood for a stout or porter. A versatile beer and extremely drinkable. Another winter favorite."
"Why is this a winter seasonal? I think I could, and would drink this year round. A great beer that I'm sure to drink a lot of this season."
"I've had this about two years ago on tap; I remember enjoying it. I never was a big fan of Samuel Adams, this is one of their first brews I enjoyed. Since my visit to the Brewery I learned to appreciate and wanting try more of their beers; I'm glad I did."
"Winter Lager--Malt Beverage Brewed With Spices--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.60% ABV. 20 IBU's? (3.5 / 5.0) No sediment. Thick pour. Thin fizzy thin lace off white head. Clear pretty bright rich copper red color. Mild cinnamon ginger orange peel toasted wheat ester mild hop front. Tangy zesty mild sweet toasty wheat mellow fruit spice Dunkel body. Mild hop odd end. Sampled 11/2/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $7.49 at Seattle Fred Meyer--Ballard on 11/2/2010."
"D: Good seasonal brew, easy to drink. Well worth a try."
"A great seasonal from Sam Adams, and a solid way to dive into the Winter Variety pack. Enjoy this one and savor it."
"A very nice winter seasonal that captures the season without killing you with gimmicks. Other than maybe Brooklyn BCS, my favorite beer of the season so far."
"Value: For once,I don't mind spending 8 or 9 bucks on a sixer of Samuel Adams."
"D: A nice beer for a winter evening."
"While this is the first Winter Lager I've ever tried I would have to say that to me this beer is a C possibly C+ at best, wouldn't recommend."
"D-This is a decently drinkable beer, I could easily drink two or three, but not terribly quickly. Not a session brew for me, but a nice beer to sit down and enjoy over a conversation."
"Recommendable and will hopefully buy more."
"I found this one easy to drink and to like. Just a nice pleasant beer, nothing outstanding, but very much worth trying if you want a nice easy to drink beer. I'd happily have more of this."
"Drinkability: Fairly easy to drink."
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle with a date of April clipped off the label. The pour is a nice looking amber-red with about a finger of cream colored sliky head. I like the label on this year's edition better than the snow white one from 2009. The aroma is well-spiced with nutmeg and malts. The taste also has an enjoyable nutmeg, toasted maltiness to it. A very likeable beer."
"Drinkability: Overall, this brew is drinkable, but not above average. I haven't been impressed by Sam Adams yet. They make better beer than some of the other big brewers, but most of their beers lack malt character and aroma. A sure sign they are cutting corners to make a subpar product for the masses."
"A nice dessert for Santa."
"D- Easy to drink, but nothing impressive. Watered down for the masses. I won't buy again, and I love Sam Adams. Its redeeming factor is that it has that signature Sam Adams taste, and thats a winner."
"Smells like a really nice sweet malt with some cinnamon and some orange on the back. The taste is a very nice malty full bodied beer. Its like a wheat beer but with a bunch of rich malts thrown in to mix with the wheat. The malt tastes like a hint of chocolate with bready and toffee/carmael like malt. Like I said this blends very well with that cereal malt wheat taste that Samuel Adams uses in some of their beers. The cinnamon blends in so well as well. The hops are very mild but mix in with the orange corriander like finish. There is also some very slight ginger in there as well to mix in with the cinnamon and malts used which reminds you of Christmas in a way. I guess that's why they call it Winter Lager and now give it it's new more festive label. This is a very good beer and my favorite seasonal from Samuel Adams besides the Noble Pils."
"Overall, this is a decent dark wheat lager, but nothing overly special. Worth a try."
"D- The drinkability is average, it is a nice beer for the winter months."
"Being analytical towards this brew is all fine and dandy, but in the long run, it is probably best to just sit back and enjoy. Your beer taste buds are smarter than you think."
"D - High, SA's best seasonal beer IMHO."
"The mouthfeel is great, full bodied malty and smooth as crystal clear water. This is the first of the winter pack this year and so far I am impressed, this is a very good American take on a classic German style."
"A fair brew that's subtly flavored, goes down easy."
"D - definitely drinkable. A nice easy beer for lazy winter nights."
"Overall, Winter Lager is one of my favorite seasonals from Sam Adams. Although the smell is average at best, the beer has a warming taste to it that makes it a good pick for the colder months. It's not overpowering, which allows you to have as many as you want ... or can handle."
"Overall I would say this is one of the better Sam Adams beers i have had yet, its the 2nd of the Winter Classic I have tried and the 2nd best by the company overall i have had, only behind the Pumpkin Harvest Ale(by the way they really need 6-packs or 12-packs of it next year) Very surprised with this one, I will for sure be drinking this a few more times this winter."
"D- not bad. Goes down pretty easy. Hopefully not the best brew of the package"
"D - Smooth and malty; a great winter warmer with a very reasonable ABV, with a good flavor punch."
"The mouthfeel is about right for a winter lager."
"Really an excellent season lager"
"Nice Bock, no the best but could be a first one of this style"
" Medium mouthfeel and easy drinking. I wouldn't turn this beer down but wouldn't seek it out either."
"Another good offering from the Boston Brewing Company. Not my favorite, but hey, I can't enjoy every style equally, can I? Still, I think they nailed what they were going for."
"Overall I liked this beer. It's definitely meant for the winter season and is an appropriate seasonal by Sam Adams. If you are like me and want to try all of the Sam Adams varieties, give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed."
"Overall: I like this stuff. It goes well with roast beef or even a burger. Very warming feeling."
"(Bottle into pint glass - sampled 4/5/10) Picture perfect pour with a dark brown color and creamy off white head. Took a while for the head to fall and a nice lacing was left behind as it did. the nose was strong with a molasses malt complimented by the strong flowery hops one would expect from Sam Adams. Notes of clove and some fruit also sneak in there. The flavor pulls all these aromas together, with the initial sweetness being cut by the bitter crisp hop finish at the end. A nice warming brew, which would benefit a little more with a little less hop, but I know that would never happen with this brewer!"
"Pretty easy to drink, but much better when served closer to room temp. Also matched well with lots of different foods, particularly a big bowl of beef stew and biscuits. Probably my favorite seasonal from them, and one that my wife enjoys quite a bit as well."
"I was first introduced to winter lagers last year, and I've yet to be disappointed. Sam Adams isn't my favorite, but it's still a good beer. The color has a nice dark amber tint, and flavor to match. I'll be trying out other winter lagers for my kegerator in the future, but I'll be keeping this one on a short list."
"I liked this one overall and will probably try it again next winter, not something I'll crave in the summer to reminisce about the winter beers."
"This beer is a beautiful red mahogany color, it has a good head retention with lacing. The aroma is full of malt and typical Christmas beer spices. The taste of of a light bodied malty sweetness and finishes with a spicy dryness. As a lager is suites well making this a easy to drink but full flavored beer."
"This is a good seasonal beer. Quite good all around. Easy to drink. Right now, it's a nice way to say goodbye to the winter."
"Overall Impression: Great beer!! I had this beer in the cellar since the winter of 2008 and it has a best if used by date of may and I was very impressed with how good the beer is even after having it in the cellar for close to a year and a half!!"
"This is one of the best beers I have had. It looks dark in the glass and smells wonderful. The spices brewed into it really add a lot to the flavor and smell. This is like Guinness in the way that you can't drink a lot at one time. Enjoy the winter months with a Winter Lager."
"The pour is dark with a cream colored head that fades fast leaving minimal residue. The taste is mostly malt with a minimal about of hops. This is a very drinkable beer.."
"A very drinkable brew. Maybe not as wintery as say Great Lakes Christmas Ale, but still a solid offering from SA."
"Notes: Good winter ale that is warming. The spices combined the way they are, really do remind me of winter."
"This was actually about what I was expecting. After trying several Sam Adams beers, I have grown to really enjoy their offerings. Their Boston lager just blew me away, but the Winter lager isn't quite as exceptional. Still good, but not as complex, and quite a bit weaker. Still a good beer though. It pours a little browner than the Boston lager, with a white head. Smell is malt, with a hint of spice. Taste is the same, but I think it's still a bit weak for a winter ale. Mouthfeel is fine, and I'd have more if I had them. If you like a decent lager, it's fine. I think I'd get the Boston lager first though."
"O: Good, pretty easy to drink, but spices could be a bit much after a while. A good Sam Adams beer. I would recommend trying this if you are already a fan of SA. It definitely has their characteristics. I wouldn't say it is a stand out bock beer, but it is a good seasonal offering to mix up your every day beers with."
"D: Pretty nice. The spices to a great job of balancing the malty sweetness without being cloying or intrusive. The alternating finish is quite attractive. I would like this beer to be just a bit bigger, a bit more bock - (even) maltier and more heft."
"D - seriously, enough cinnamon. dont recall it being this bold in the past. highly accessible ""winterized"" bock...might pair well with some carb-heavy German food."
"D- Good beer, average ABV, I'd drink a few more."
"Poured out of a bottle into a pint glass. Perfect for a winter day. Has a nice blend of spices, with some great cinnamon and brown sugar hints. Actually has solid drinkability as opposed to the Sam Adams Summer, which to me becomes a little overbearing after a few. I personally prefer a little less spiceyness in my lagers (ala Brooklyn), but when it's in the right setting, there are few winter lagers I'd prefer to pour. Thumbs Up."
"Skål!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"d: ok, but pretty weak as a winter offering; drink only if nothing else available"
"D - Very drinkable and a true winter beer. Sessionable. It's warming and packs a good kick after a while, though you'd have to drink more than a few to be wasted."
"D: Very easy to drink. Looking forward to the next."
"Overall, a great beer that most people can appreciate, especially in the cold midwest winters. It isn't too polarizing to put people off, but rewards the ones that try it."
"M/D - Overall another good brew from Sam Adams. Medium bodied and very easy going, with a sweet malt taste with a fair amount of spices, not overly done just well rounded. A pretty good seasonal that I could drink a couple of and share the beer love with others."
"Didn't like it as much this year, maybe due to different tastes this year or just a recipe change. Has kind of a artificial Hi-C fruit punch taste to it, mouthfeel is weak and prickly, seems unbalanced. Still, not a bad beer. The spice and bready malts are nice."
"This Winter Lager is a nice addition to the Sam Adams winter sampler."
"I had one of these cold, and one that was just cool. Obviously the one that was cold didn't match up to the cool one at all. The cool one really brought out the flavors and drinkability. This was one of the first ""good"" beers I had and I must say, after learning how to appreciate beer properly, this brew is so much better."
"D - Can think of others I would session, but it is not a bad beer."
"Good taste, and very drinkable. I think this is one of their better seasonals."
"Note: Good taste, not overpowering and easy to drink."
"very drinkable and well balanced for the winter, but there's better stuff out there for the cold."
"Personally I think any beer that is emblazoned with the ""winter"" title should be stronger and richer. It feels like it has been dumbed down to appease simpler tastes."
"Overall, better than I expected, but not quite good enough for a regular drink. I'll be looking forward to my summer ale..."
"D: This is one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams. Nice full flavored lager that makes a great session beer on those cold New England nights."
"You have redeemed yourself from the Cherry Wheat."
"D: Glorious. Beer that actually has flavor but doesn't feel like your drinking a protein shake. I can drink 6 or 8 and not wake up feeling terrible. Really one of the best pound for pound readily available beers."
"D: I generally don't classify winter beers as exceedingly drinkable, but this one is fairly sessionable, as far as winter beers go."
"d - the spices limit drinkability for me as they wear on the palate a little bit, not all that interesting, but I wouldn't have a problem drinking a few bottles on a cold night"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Very rich holiday beer. Nice to enjoy with a good meal. Good carbonation, feels great on the palate."
"Review from notes taken on: 12/6/09."
"Drinkability: A little heavy but complex enough to keep me interested in the beer. Good but not great."
"The taste/mouthfeel is thinner than you'd expect, some buttery character. Simple malts with some balancing hops. All subdued and watery, to be honest. some hints of spice that don't counter the buttery, watery, diluted character in this mess of underwhelming boringness masquerading as a beer with some flavor."
"Cheers!"
"decent. well-balanced."
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. I did enjoy it but it's mostly average."
"d- Oh yes. Easy to repeat."
"D: easy drinking here; matches perfectly with most winter holiday meals -- and especially desserts like pumpkin pie."
"12oz. bottle. Pours reddish-amber with a small off-white head. Light aroma, some caramel, light spice. Flavor is caramel malts, spice, slightly sweet. Decent mouthfeel, not too carbonated. A fair winter brew, especially when considering the price."
"Drinkability: This is a pleasant enough beer to have with dinner or as something to drink while engaged in chatting with friends. It has an interesting mix of flavors but it not so complex as to demand your full attention. It would be interesting to have 3-4 of these of an evening to see if the flavors grow on one. While I won't go out of my way to have one of these again I also won't make any special effort to avoid it. This is a good workman-like beer and a good value for the money. One of the strengths of this beer is that the spices are subdued and enrich the flavor without taking it over."
"D - This is a tasty, refreshing lager that provides exactly what it advertises (cinnamon, ginger, orange peel). I think it could honestly do without the orange peel but either way it's very easy to drink a sixer. Will definitely anticipate this beer for next winter."
"M/D - Light-bodied. Lively carbonation. No lingering effects. Very drinkable. Refreshing alternative to heavier winter ales."
"Way, way drinkable. It would be easy to overdo it. I could have finished a 6-pack in a snap if it didn't finish me first."
"next I'll reach for a really great homebrew!"
"D--It is what it is. Would this be my choice if you gave me options for the style? No, but a solid seasonal that is often the ""best"" choice at some restaurants and bars who do not carry lots of choices."
"I will look fwd to this seasonal in years to come. One of the better seasonal offerings by BBC/Sa in my opinion. One of the only spiced brew I have really really enjoyed in a sessionable context."
"D: Drinkable, I think that the brewery went just a tad on the conservative side for a winter brew."
"Mouthfeel is nice and crisp, but just a bit substantially thicker than other traditional lagers. Good for the style. Coats the mouth very well and lingers for just a few seconds. The drinkability is decent - I honestly don't see myself having more than one or two of these for a night, but it's still very pleasing. Not a bad seasonal by the BBC."
"Overall, I am not very impressed with this offering from Sam Adams - I won't be seeking it out again."
"D- A nice beer that has some interesting stuff going on but isn't too over-the-top."
"man, if i could just find someone who love the coastal wheat and cranberry lambic but hates the winter lager...TRADE? ;)"
"if i'm in the airport tomorrow in newark and this is the best thing they have available for $8, i'll probably get it - as long as it comes with a $1 shot."
"Not too much to change about this one."
"This is probably my favorite Winter seasonal beer. It's very tasty on-tap and from the bottle. Winter Lager brings a fairly strong taste, but it isn't overwhelming or too bitter. As with most Sam Adams beers, this beer as a beautiful dark color. Give this beer a try, it's something different for the winter season."
"Pours forth a darker amber color. Smells of caramel and cinnamon. Bit harder to discern the smells tonight with a clogged nose. taste of caramel in the tongue. Always an enjoyable drink on a cold day for me. Feels rather water no real bit to it. I could sit down on a cold winter day in front of a fire place and easily polish of a few without even noticing."
"Decent, easy drinker when you are at an office party without better alternatives."
"Pours dark amber and clear in appearance. Aroma is of malt, some caramel and a touch of all-spice. Taste is pleasantly sweet with some hops for balance. The spices are there but stay in the background which is a good thing I think. I'm not detecting any wheat goodness but that's okay. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and finishes clean. I think I'll have another. I bought a case to share with family/friends on Christmas Eve and its a very approachable ""micro"" brew for guests to try."
"Not the greatest, just tasty and reasonably priced."
"Due to the sweetness, Samuel Adams Winter Lager went very well with Christmas cookies; however, when it was gone, there was no evidence left behind on glass or palate, and not much to remember."
"This beer pours a clear brownish amber body with a thin white head that dissipates somewhat quickly. The aromas are bready and some hints of dark fruit. The flavor is sweet crystal malt up front up front with enough spice and character to balance. The spices of cinnamon and ginger are a nice added touch as well. The body is a bit thin, but warmth does it some good. Not a typical bock, but a good beer nonetheless."
"Very easy to drink but probably not for everyone."
"when i poured into my glass it had about a 1/2 inch head that disappeared into a nice thin white lace. It smells la little strong of hops but not to overpowering. has a nice balance of hops and malts, l little bitter but nice(that's my thought). a very nice mouth feel. i think it is very drinkable and would recommend it to anybody who likes a hearty lager. I also think this beer fits this time of year, its cold and it will warm you up."
"D- This was a pretty drinkable beer which I enjoyed for the most part. This was until the beer got a little warmer. The alcohol jumped out a little more making the beer harder to swallow. Overall though I would drink this again but as something more than just a sipper."
"D: Has a nice taste, low abv, can drink plenty of these."
"Drinkability: I thoroughly enjoy this seasonal offering from Sam Adams. It's been on my radar for a while now, and it will continue to be on my radar."
"Pours a dark amber brown with a half finger off white head. Aroma is slight with caramel maltiness and faint hops. Flavor follows suit with malty sweetness, bread, and just the slightest detection of brewing spices. Light to medium bodied. Not a lot of depth or interest, but decent for sure."
"I really like this beer, I buy cases whenever I can.Also like the slight cinnamon flavor that the beer has,must say its really nice. I find the beer to be smooth with nice lacing and a great smell.its a really nice all around beer for the cold season."
"D: pretty easy drinking winter style beer. A little too heavy on the orange flavors for my liking. Definitely not your typical bock."
"D: simple to pick up and drink a few."
"Poured into a stein this brew has a nice reddish-brown color with a slight off white head that is about 2 fingers and settles into a nice cap. The aroma is of slightly toasted malts, hints of some seasonal spices of clove and prunes. There is also a mild doughy smell. The taste is of faint spices and chocolate and caramel malts. More on the stout side of a winter ale (with much less spice to my liking). This is an all around solid brew. Not much I don't like. It is not over the top great, but wonderful to bring to a holiday party to pass and not offend anyone."
"Overall/notes: Good beer from Boston Brewing Co. and being my first bock, makes me want to find some more! The sweetness is a major plus. Cheers!"
"D - I could get f*#@ed up on this bad daddy. These go down me just way too easily. Epitomy of a session beer."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a dark amber with a finger of off white head. Not much in the aroma department, a little caramel sweetness and some noble hops. Light to medium bodied. Wheaty with some malt sweetness, a little bit of spice in the finish. Not a whole lot going on here, but it's fairly drinkable."
"Anyhoo, finishes decent, a little unusual flavors in there. . . similar at times to Anchor's Christmas, you start to think there is like nutmeg or celery in there along with a dash of cinnamon and other holiday type ""adjuncts"" that are lively. Wheat body gives it a lighter liveliness than a lot of winter seasonals."
"Pours with a good, thick head and has a pleasant and slightly sweet aftertaste."
"D: Good beer for a cold day."
"Drinkability is above average. This is a reasonable winter beer overall."
"Had this on tap many times, and in bottle. But this review is for on tap. Has a thick foamy slightly off white head that hangs around for quite a bit. Faintly smells sweet and spicy. Has a sweet, but not too sweet aftertaste. This is a very drinkable bock style beer. I like it."
"The feel is good, syrupy as it goes down. Drinkability is excellent because this was is tasty and not too strong. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Big off-white head with a dark amber body. Laced pretty good. Roasted malt and the slightest hint of orange in the finish. Very mild flavored taste. This beer seems weaker to me than in prior years. Overall not a bad tasting brew."
"D - good brew, wish it was available longer in the season. gets me in the Christmas spirit!"
"Clear reddish copper with no head. Smells appropriately seasonal...cherries, cinnamon, cloves. Taste is cherry, wood, a bit of cinnamon in the aftertaste. Finishes clean. Mouthfeel is well carbonated but a bit thin. Drinkability is very good. Not a challenging beer at all, it passes mostly unnoticed. Maybe a good trainer beer, but I like the Boston Lager much better."
"D. This beer tastes like Christmas. It is really good and goes down easily. I think that I will get it in my kegerator next year."
"Dark amber in color, thin ring of eggshell foam. No real head or retention. The smell is maily malt with some faint, indistinguishable spices. I am guessing nutmeg or other 'Christmas' flavors, but pretty tough to tell. No real overpowering flavors, good balance between malty sweetness and some earthy hops in the finish. Low carbonation keep it smooth, slightly creamy, and easy to drink. Good but not great, nothing really helps it to stand out. Lighter body, as expected from a lager."
"D: Pretty easy to drink; not heavy at all, and the 5.8% ABV keeps it to sessionable levels."
"In general e very well balanced beer, and rather ale-ish for a lager (which for me is a good thing)."
"Dark amber pour hinting of ruby. The malt dominated the spices. There was an earthy hops aroma, but it was fairly weak. Cinnamon and nutmeg are there in weak amounts. It's malty sweet and the spices are hinting...it's tough to pick out a single one. This is actually a good thing. No single flavor overpowering another. Nice and balanced. I've always enjoyed this, but I was more fond of it this year than previous years...maybe it's my fancy pants Sam Adams glass I just got!"
"D- Amazingly drinkable. I had to slow myself down as I could hardly contain myself."
":)"
"D- Overall a nice drinkable brew."
"My favorite of the Sam Adams catalog of beers(Octoberfest close second). Finally, a winter beer that is more interested in being medium and drinkable rather than overpowering."
"Notes: My perception of this beer is about the same as my perception of most Sam Adams beers: not exactly a stellar brew, yet never a bad choice either. Not my favorite winter seasonal or my favorite Sam Adams beer, but a decent beer nevertheless."
"A solid winter beer, and very drinkable during the holiday season."
"Overall an enjoyable winter brew, but not quite the bock I was expecting."
"Overall, great beer, and another solid attempt by Sam Adams, although I think some of my local breweries do it better. I highly recommend this to you and yours, as always, Cheers."
"I like this beer because you have to wait for it every year to be released. It kind of lets me know Christmas is coming and all is right with the world. I know thats far fetched but it really is a great beer. What I like most about this beer is the fact that although you can taste the extra spices they don't overpower the drinkability. So with that said, Happy Holidays!"
"D: A nice beer, a real winter beer. In Sweden this is marketed as a x-mas beer - but this doesn't go to well with x-mas food (at least not swedish). This is a really nice winter beer, but not the best x-mas beer."
"D - Definitely a drinkable brew perfect for the winter season"
"Drinkability - I enjoyed drinking this beer. Heavy enough to satisfy, yet not so heavy that it becomes a chore to drink the beer. Would definitely get a 12-pack next time around."
"About a half an inch head of loose tan foam which swiftly disperses to a thin surface layering, minimal lacing at best. Clear red amber liquid with more orange zinc hue around the rims, easily transparent. Whiff of nutmeg and ginger in the nose, toasted cocoa and caramel, close to white pepper at times, moderate apricot, apple fruit and close to zero citrus presence, it's really all over the place, sometimes smells like Dr. Pepper. Light-bodied with sufficient carbonation to churn it up into a larger presence. More metallic and herbaceous here with the malts, caramel and molasses a diminished force. Ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg remains strong, contributes to its overall dryness. Regrettably, it is a touch boring and suggests more personality than it delivers."
"D - very drinkable and refreshing"
"D - A good winter seasonal but one of the weaker seasonals from Saumel Adams in terms of their Christmas offerings. I'd stop at two pints too. The whole beer is good but overall a bit cloying with extended consumption."
"good breakfast beer."
"Drinkability- Overally this beer actually was not to bad at all, nothing I personally would regularly probably seek out as I am not hugely into a lot of winter lagers but it exceded my expectations so it is one I would give another look, overall just a very nice rich ale that is not bad if you just want one easy drinking beer at the local pub or by the tv,"
"The taste is really rich, the carmel and other spiced malts hit the palate first, notes of ginger playing at the tongue throughout. An excellent offering from SA"
"D: This is a one off beer. I don't think I would want to have more than one due to the strong ginger flavor, but it is tasty when you are in the mood for a winter spice beer."
"Beer is full bodied with an interesting sweetness. There is a cereal like aftertaste that gets stronger the more you drink. Low bitterness although there is some hop bitterness present. There is also a hint of spice in the midpalate. Drinkability high, mouthfeel is ok."
"Overall, this beer is kind of unremarkable. I expected something better than this but it kinda let me down. Boston Lager is a good deal better."
"Overall a good beer out of those that are readily available. Like others from Sam Adams though, better beers out there for the money, but they are harder to find."
"Looks nice. Clear and coppery, with a frothy, tan head. Not too much going on with the smell. First taste is all smoky malt, going into some bitter and spice. What really is distracting from this bottle is a metallic bent in the aftertaste. The body is thin, and I'm left remembering how this beer was a bit bolder in years past. I may have sampled from an ""off"" batch, though."
"D: A good winter lager. Very good in terms of balance. Good stuff for the price/style..."
"This brew is very good - a yearly tradition for me and my fellow beer drinkers, and rightfully so."
"Drinkability: This has a bit more flavor than Samuel Adams Boston Lager and was definitely enjoyable. The finish was really great and a little less carbonation would have helped with drinkability, but this beer would go incredible well with Thanksgiving dinner."
"I would buy this again."
"Note: In all fairness this is not a type of beer I usually drink. My ratings are on the poor side, but they're definitely skewed due to my preference of stouts and porters. Maybe a great beer if you enjoy this style. Worth a try. Certainly not a favorite of mine."
"D - Very easy to drink. Manageable ABV. Certainly is a winter warmer to me, as the malty notes go well against a cold Iowa night."
"F: Finishes a little sweet still, a little drier would make it even nicer. The dark malt and syrupy flavor sticks around (pun intended) as it clings to the sides of the mouth and the tongue for a short while leaving the sticky flavor. A slight bitterness and spicy earthy hop flavor remain at the finish, but don't get stronger at all."
"Medium bodied and slightly syrupy leads to a quick and smooth drink, though, not the most exciting."
"D: Good. I'd order another, and maybe 6 more."
"I would definitely recommend this beer. Got this on tap, but I've had it on bottle before. It's still a great beer all around."
"D - A very drinkable beer"
"Drinkability/Overall: It's certainly drinkable, and I wouldn't turn it down if offered to me, but it's just not that interesting. Does not compare favorably to Southern Tier's Old Man Winter, which I'd had the day before. There's nothing at all unpleasant about it, it's just tame."
"Taste: Definitely some cinnamon. Little bit of ginger as well? Pretty tasty but it's nothing to go too crazy over."
"This beer was especially impressive, possibly due to my previous encounters with Samuel Adams (personal preferences). The beer is a rich, dark amber color, emitting scents of various spices from the very first pour. I enjoyed its crisp notes and spiced finish. While I tend to enjoy most dark wheat beers, I did particularly enjoy this seasonal brew."
"[Drinkability]: Pretty good beer."
"Mouth is light on tongue with some bitterness carbonation average. A good equal malt and bitterness drink, I've had this for an Evening and it's a good session beer."
"Pours a clear, deep copper/amber hue with a tan head that leaves a very nice lacing. Smells slightly of hops, and a nice bouquet of other spices, but nothing really jumps out at me. Taste is very good. Malty, but with many spices, cinnamon, ginger, seem to be prominent, as well as fruits such as berries and even some caramel. Feels slightly more bodied than i was expecting, and quite a pleasant surprise. Goes down smooth and is a reasonably priced holiday favourite"
"This is a well-made brew and a good seasonal choice. One or two is all I would want. I don't find bocks to be imminently quaffable. I got bored with it by halfway through the second one. A cleaner finish would have made this a bit easier to drink. 5.8% is a little sneaky too."
"Overall, a decent brew yet pretty standard. Has some interesting flavors and is actually quite refreshing."
"Mouthfeel & drinkability are OK, though I certainly won't be buying any 6 or 12 packs of this this year. It's just amazing to me that they are calling this the same name as previous years' beer. In the past I've bought multiple 12 packs of the SA Winter Lager. Those were a rich malty, slightly spiced lagers -- great stuff. This was thin, pale, and overspiced, I thought. Quite disappointing, especially given my expectations from the past."
"On tap at a bar on Boylston Street. Served in a pint glass. Dark reddish brown color. Faint head and lacing. Smells a bit like cinnamon and pine. Taste was good but not great. Bit of caramel and toasted nuts noticed. Pretty malty beer. The body was a bit on the light side for a winter beer. Fairly simple to drink, not a beer to ponder. Easy beer to have with food or by itself. Another crowd pleaser from SA."
"(D)- This is a good beer, but it just reminds me of a toned-down version of their Old Fezziwig Ale, which is much better than this."
"D- Goes down easy, but for me there is something in the spices that doesnt do it for me."
"Where did the winter lager that I had from Sam Adams two years ago go? I didn't get to try it last year, but I remember trying it a couple years ago and it being a little heartier and more ""winter-like"" than it currently is. Sam's needs to rework this beer. It's very good, but simply too light and boring."
"had on tap at chilis it came in chilled mug a red/brown color with a very small head and thin lacing had a malty smell with some citrus..the taste was sweet malts and biscuits with some caramel and toffee taste it had some nice hops in the finish,,overall a typically good sam adams brew..not great but drinkable/enjoyable as most boston beers co. are"
"D - The beer is light enough to have all night, but the flavor is too light and offputting to make you want to do that."
"Pours a red brown without much head. The head that is there is sticking around for a while. The smell is primarily of sweet malt with a slightly acidic smell. Possibly citrus. Tasty malt forward taste, slightly sweet. It's nothing special but I kind of like it. A good easy drinker with some flavor but I won't break the bank on it."
"D- i love it .. cheers and enjoy"
"D - Good winter bock with low abv."
"Overall, I wasn't too impressed. Nothing terrible, but nothing spectacular. Average is the best word."
"Carbonation is typical Sam Adams, but it works. Instead of being a heavy Winter Warmer style of beer, it's a crisp, refreshing Bock-style with spices. It's very light bodied and would be a great session beer for a cold Saturday evening - unless you want something with more alcohol."
"Overall, this may be one of the better spiced winter beers I've had. With that said, it lacks the body and intense malt presence I enjoy in my Bocks and winter beers. This is much closer to a spiced Marzen than a Bock. Not something I would buy regularly but would be happy to drink if offered."
"Overall- for a bock or a lager this beer is light bodied. on the bottle it says "" a dark wheat lager"". definitely nothing to crazy. only picked it up cuz the store didn't have sh#t!! not to bummed but wish i had something different."
"very nice clear reddish mahogany color. 1 finger head that left an average amount of lacing. The aroma is strong with roasted malt and cinnamon, maybe a little hoppieness in there. The taste is a nice blend of malt, orange, cinnamin, and balanced out with some hops. Medium mouthfeel, very drinkable. If I could change this beer Id make it more full flavored and a little more heavy."
"That being said this beer more then likely won't blow any minds. Its just a solid session-able seasonal lager that balances many flavors together"
"D: A very nice winter beer that I could have quite a few of easily"
"Overall, I'd say that this beer is a very nice winter seasonal, I'm pretty sure it's to style, although I haven't had too many bocks. Very sessionable in a winter-esque way."
"D- I anticipated the taste being a little richer/heartier than it actually is. The spices kind of give this beer a weird aftertaste that makes it a little difficult to put down easily."
"D - Like the Creamy Stout, this beer appeals to a larger crowd, and it seems to fit the bill. Personally, when I have a bock, I want something full bodied and heavy, especially during the winter. I understand what Sam Adams is putting out but this beer seems more like a fall/spring beer, not a winter beer or maybe even a bock for that matter."
"That said, I like this beer a lot. Some winter ales are over the top with the nutmeg and spice, but not this one. Just a good solid, well balanced beer, and something I look forward to each winter. Because of the good pricing in 12 packs, this is my go-to beer this time of year."
"D - A little to sweet to pound these, but can drink more than one easily."
"Overall, very drinkable, middle-of-the-road winter offering"
"Excellent drinkability - the earthiness is just a bit trying by the end, but still nicely flavorful and well balanced, easy drinking beer."
"This is a good bear to sit down on a winter night and sip away at. Great taste. I highly recommend it."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm not big on lagers, or Sam Adams for that matter...but this is a well crafted beer no questions asked. Fairly unique too. I feel like they achieved exactly what they were aiming for with this one."
"D- Easy to drink a few of, but not really a session beer. Good beer to drink with heavier food such as steaks and ribs. A personal favorite of mine which is my wintertime go-to dinner beer."
"Overall: Doesn't scream winter to me or even particularly lager, it warms you up sure but it is too light in my honest opinion."
"I wish this beer was available year round."
"D: This is a pretty easy drinking beer and one that you could easily have several of in a session. I'm not the biggest fan of bocks, but I found this one to be fairly enjoyable and wouldn't turn it down if offered one."
"I have to say...I really wanted to like this beer from all that I have heard. Unfortunately, it really was nothing special. It really did not have a ton of flavor and tasted just ""ok"". Didn;t hate it, but for the price there are way better choices than sam's winter."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable beer and one of my favorite selections from SA. I will definitely turn to this beer at least one more time this season and will look forward to it in winters to come."
"Nice medium body and pleasent lingering after taste. Would defenatly reach fo another."
"Smooth and drinkable, had another one to taste for sure."
"Nicely carbonated, with a solid body to it. On a colder day, this is a beer that I could drink for a while."
"The only real downfall is the fact that only 2 came inside the Winter variety pack."
"D: Very High, one of the best tasting Winter beers i have ever had the pleasure of drinking.This beer is full flavored and goes down nicely. Only downfall is.... it's a seasonal beer"
"D: Pretty good. It isn't really a show-stopper, but it's widely available and not bad at all."
"Drinakblity is great! This would make a very nice session beer as it is quite flavorful and goes down smooth. I look forward to having many more of these in the coming cold winter months."
"D: I really like this beer. As I noted above, the flavors could use just a little more balance, but overall it's tasty and very drinkable. When I go out to restaurants this time of year that don't have anything special on tap this is almost always what I get. This would be good to session as well."
"Drinkability - Pleasant to drink. As the beer warms up, the slight spice is no longer noticeable and the hops finish very well - Cheers!"
"An old friend of mine. One of the beers that got me started years ago. Mediocre example of the style, malty and spicy with little hop presence. The thing I did appreciate about this beer was the alcohol bite which warms you on those cold winter nights and also the spice character. Nutmeg, vanilla extract and cinnamon were all present. Still not very tasty, close to a cola feel and a bitterness from spice in the finish that is mildly unpleasant."
"D -- Very nice drinker for cooler to colder days and nights."
"Drinkability: Nice, hearty winter lager with just a touch of spice so you can't forget the upcoming festivities. Of course, this isn't really a Bock. A Bock with wheat and spices? Nein!"
"drinkabiltiy is good - one of the better seasonal SA beers"
"Drinkability - Very much so. I can't wait for it to get a bit cooler outside so I can sit out in the cool autumn air with a jacket and enjoy a few of these on the porch. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this today and couldn't help myself to having one tonight. I can't wait for the other SA Winter Seasonals to come out! My god I'm going to stock up on those!"
"I love this brew, but of course it takes a back seat to old Fezzie."
"D. I will buy a few more of these this season. A good session beer with, alot of flavor."
"has a nice brownish/amber appearance, filtered. had a nice head that stuck around for most of the beer. smell i found hints of the spices they claim to have, but mainly strong malty presence. taste more of the same as with the smell. mouthfeel is what you would expect as well as the drinkability. certainly a beer made for average beer drinkers, or drinking of high quantities; nothing too stand out here."
"whenever i get a chance to head to the Sam Adam's Brewpub im def getting a few of these"
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours a rich amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells malty with some spices. Taste starts of malty and finishes bitter. Medium bodied in the mouth. A little heavy on the stomach to drink to many of these. Overall a fairly decent beer."
"Pours a very dark copper color with a one finger off white head. The smell of of roasted malts, caramel, and some bread. The taste is of roasted malt up front with a slight hop bitterness on the back end to balance out the flavor. The mouthfeel is slightly more carbonated than what i expected for a bock. Overall the drinkability on this is above average, solid selection."
"D- decent but lacking a little in all departments"
"Notes: This is a great winter beer with a good balance of flavor, complexity and drinkability."
"Dark scarlet orange with a whipped tan head that leaves some fine lace on the glass. The smell is biscuit malty and spicy with cinnamon and orange zest. It tastes much like the smell, spicy and clovey with sweet maltiness and a dry faint hop bite in the finish. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. A good winter brew for the money."
"Drinks easily. Good beer for a cold winter day."
"D: Goes down easy, very smooth and easy to reach for another, at the same time not very memorable. Perhaps this would have been better a couple of months ago. Worth trying for something different. I won't complain about this being in the mix next winter when I want Old Fezziwig (unlike Cranberry lambic)."
"D: Good winter beer. Another solid seasonal from the BBC."
"Thanks for this one Jim! You do good work."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this one. My grades for this beer on tap and bottle seem fairly accurate which is a good thing. This one will definitely be in my fridge next winter."
"Copper in color. Holds a nice head and has a visible carbonation or ""prickle."" Classic beer smell with a full mouth flavor. The spices creates an almost hoppy bitterness. I had typically imbibed this beer from the bottle and decided to pour it into a pint glass for the purpose of review. I found that I enjoyed it much more from the bottle directly. I suspect this is because some of the flavors that I did not enjoy, or perhaps simply did not expect were muted on the occasions where I sucked it directly out of the bottle."
"This is decent but there are much better choices for this style."
"Drinkability: This is something that I could easily drink 2 (or more) of at one sitting, in short order."
"I'll bet this is better fresh on tap. I'll have to look for it next winter."
"Notes: I've had a long history with this beer, and it was the first beer that turned me to the craft beer world. I still look forward to the coming of winter and the Winter Lager hitting the shelves, and my friends and I still like to reminisce about old times with the beer that opened all of our eyes to how good beer can be. Although this (obviously) isn't as good as it was when I first had it, it's still a deliciously perfect beer for the winter months, and I'll probably buy at least one six-pack every year for as long as the Boston Beer Company keeps putting this beer out there."
"The appearance of this beer was simply amazing. It was amber or ruby in color with two fingers worth of light tan head that just wouldn't quit. After every drink I took it left a thick ring completely around my glass. The smell was of wheat and spices. The taste started off with a caramel and malt semi sweetness. It had a nice spice flavor throughout. It was medium bodied with a clean crisp finish. This is a very solid beer that I wouldn't mind having a few of."
"12oz bottle into a Boston Lager glass, pours a crisp light copper with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is crisp sweet malts and slight Earthy hops. The taste is very well balanced, but a bit on the sweet side. The beer is fairly light, but does provide the warmth you'd expect from a Winter beer. This one is enjoyable, but its not exactly what I look for in a Winter Beer."
"I feel like taste and body wise, this beer only goes about 70 percent of the way there, it has great components that could shine...if only there were a bit more of them. The cinnamon again comes through and offers not only flavor, but astringincy, just not enough of either. This beer is certainly not a bad beer, it just isn't a big enough beer. That being said, however, I could drink quite a few of them."
"D - This is a very drinkable winter beer. A nice alternative to heavier winter warmers and spiced ales, and more approachable for those that aren't beer enthusiasts. I keep this one on hand throughout the holidays."
"Pours a dark amber-brown from the bottle with loads of light brown head, causing me to slow my pour. Head doesn't stick around for long, however. Smell is light but pleasant--bready and sweet--and the taste is much the same with a caramel/molasses/brown sugar sweetness. Light spicing also in the taste, perhaps the cinnamon the bottle mentions. Mouthfeel is very creamy and full, leaving my mouth well hydrated. This is great stuff, and I'll look for it again next winter."
"Great beer, as is typical from Sam Adams. You never have to worry about drinking a quality beer from the Boston Beer Company, unless you don't like the taste. Personally I find Winter Lager to be their best offering, with a lovely color and a nice thick but not too overwhelming of a taste. The smell seems a bit funky to me, but not awful."
"Not bad, better than BMC. Typical Adams offering."
"D..Refer to mouthfeel. Not something I'd go out of may way to drink."
"Poured a copper red into my goblet with a voluminous 2-finger head which leaves prodigious lacing throughout the drink. Aroma is bread, nuts, fig, caramel, a little bit of toast. Mouthfeel is a little slick and syrupy with not much carbonation. Taste is very malty, very much like the aroma, with lots of nuts and bread, vanilla and caramel. Drinkability is good. Overall this is a good brew and I will seek this out again."
"Drinkability is meh. This is another mediocre smattering from Sam Adams. Slightly more drinkable then the rest but just as easily forgotten. I won't drink it again unless I have to."
"Pours a clear caramel amber color with 1 finger of off-white head. OK retention leaves some lacing. Smells of caramel, cinnamon, holiday spices, toasted malt, citrus hops, and light butterscotch notes. Tastes of molasses, toasted malt, and sweet grain with some cinnamon and ginger and a finish of orange zest and lemon. Medium in body with average carbonation. Smooth with a nice dry crisp finish. A good session brew for the winter months, easy to drink and somewhat hearty to keep you warm."
"m/d - Not too thick, flavor lingers briefly. Really drinkable, especially at the price and with the availability. I have gone through 2 cases of this over the winter and have turned many non-craft drinkers on to it. Recommended for sure."
"D - It is good. Not heavy enough that I couldn't have a few but not light enough to make me need 20 to be full."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As I've already stated finish is drier. The beer is medium-light in body with levels of carbonation that seem to be a little high to me, they scrub away and take the attention away from the more delicate flavors in this beer. This beer is easy enough to drink allright, I finished that 12er in no time...did I enjoy every beer though, was I happy to be drinking every beer?, no. I didn't look forward to the flavor of each and every brew, it was beer so I drank it. You won't catch me buying this beer again. Overall this is an okay beer, but why waste the money when there's so much better out there?"
"D: The is a very drinkable brew, I can see why it's a winter lager though because its warming and it would make you sweat on a hot day!"
"D - eh, I didn't really enjoy this beer. This review is based off of the '08 release which I though was far inferior to the '07 release."
"This poured a clear dark copper with tan head. It smelled like creamy yeast and caramel malt with fresh wheat and lemon and hops. It tasted like copper hops and earthy barley and sweet creamy yeast, with some lemon hops and caramel malt. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a pretty nice, malty beer. It smelled great, but the flavor wasn't as big or clean. Still, it was good with good body too. It was definitely easy to drink, almost like a generic version of Clipper City's Winter Storm. Pretty enjoyable."
"D - Somewhat refreshing for a winter seasonal...not overly complex, just a good drinking beer"
"Very good on tap. Certainly much better than in the bottle."
"For a seasonal beer I found this one to be quite drinkable. Often times holiday beers focus to much on the ""spice."" I enjoy drinking the pumpkin pie but would rather eat it. This winter larger is very easy to drink. The color is nice and the aroma is fine. I don't taste much of the spice, which I like. I just bought a case of it at a local beverage store and I'm not dissatisfied (hey, a case of good beer for $12, not bad)."
"Drinkability: Good beer. This is a seasonal that you can find in more bars than most other good winter beers and is often a fall-back for me in an otherwise BMC bar."
"Verdict: A solid Winter seasonal and, at least in my opinion, one of Sam Adam's best offerings. A safe bet for a mellow, but still full-flavored Winter seasonal, Winter Lager is worth a try for sure."
"nice, but typically safe offering from sam adams. didnt find anything that stood out, but good for drinking a high quantitity for sure. has a nice brownish/amber appearance, filtered. had a nice head that stuck around for most of the beer. smell i found hints of the spices they claim to have, but mainly strong malty presence. taste more of the same as with the smell. mouthfeel is what you would expect as well as the drinkability. certainly a beer made for average beer drinkers, or drinking of high quantities; nothing too stand out here."
"D-Got this the variety pack...one of my favorite in it. Very enjoyable beer I'd consider buying in a sixer."
"Winter Lager's a good beer. It's definitely nice during the cold months. Frankly, I prefer BBC's Holiday Porter and Old Fezziwig. I wish they put those in six packs. But, this is good beer. Definitely one to pick around this time of year. Easily recommended."
"Very drinkable - not heavy at all, easy to see having more than a few."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. I feel like this category is the beers' strong point. It is tasty, malty, crisp, with a nice depth of flavor. Nicely done Mr. Adams."
"Taste is malty with a lot of the sweetness replaced by hoppy and toasty bitterness. Not getting too many winter spices in the flavor. Overall, a decent beer, and I give props to BBC for doing a winter beer that's a lager."
"I'm not too sure of classifying this as a bock due to the wheat malt and spices used."
"D: A heck of a beer overall, one that I'll wait for every year. Great balances of malts and hops with a spiciness that most beers don't have."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very drinkable."
"Poured into my SA pint glass. Looks like a Boston Lager. Sweet malt and caramel aroma. Slight hop smell. Good bitterness, for a lager. Medium bodied. Easy to drink just not what I'd prefer to have again. Nothing too special, normal. Sometimes normal is ok, not for me."
"SA Winter Lager pours a dark amber with a one-finger off-white head. Moderate lacing. The smell is slightly roasted malts and yeast with spices (maybe allspice & nutmeg). The taste is malty with hints of allspice & cinnamon, but not too pronounced. Mouthfeel is crisp at first, then smooth. This is a very drinkable beer, much smoother than I expected."
"a very drinkable brew. can't beat the price."
"Bottle from the Winter Classics collection pack into my pint glass. Pours a dark clear amber with a small white head that fades to a light cover. Some lacing present. Smells of malt, caramel, and spices. Feels light bodied, moderate carbonation, definitely the malty characteristics of the Boston Lager, but with a sweet spicey twist. Worth a try."
"Cheers and Hoppy Holidays!"
"Very good drinkability. A winter session beer dare I say? (I know, I know, too much alcohol, but it goes down very easy) A great winter staple and it's nice that the freshness is ensured each year."
"Drinkability: Again, I would give it a fair drinkability, but I'm just not a huge fan of this one compared to the other brews from Sam Adams. It's not overpowering though and it would be fairly easy to session with."
"Drinkability- Occupies an odd slot for me. Tasty and full bodied enough to enjoy a couple, not so flavorful and tasty as to be crave it very often. A good brew, but not exceptional"
"Pours a nice deep copper color with a beautiful two-finger billowy head. Lacing is excellent. Smell is slightly spiced but mostly uneventful. Taste is warm, lightly spicy with large caramel overtones. Mouthfeel is thick with a nice lingering flavor and aftertaste. Drinkability is quite high with this well balanced beer."
"drink: not too bad. smooth going"
"D- Easy to drink."
"Smooth, buttery and just a little roasty. Lightly roasted malt, with caramel flavors. Little bit of hop to carry the end, but overall the experience is sweet. A little dry and grassy to finish. Light to medium body, not too much behind it. Very drinkable and inoffensive, easy to session. Not much to say about this one. It's a step above the typical spiced winter fare, and some at some places, probably a step above what else is on tap, but it probably wouldn't make it into a regular winter rotation for me."
"D - Definitely drinkable. Very good both fridge or cellar temp. It's quite refreshing too, unlike some other Winter beers. So this would be a great choice for those that live in warmer climates but still want a special seasonal."
"Poured from draft into pint glass. Poured a deep dark mahogany with a half finger of tan head. Smell is almost non-existent, slight chocolate smell. Taste is light cocoa with some light malty taste in the undertones. Light mouthfeel. Could drink several of these for sure."
"Pours a clear, dark brown. 3/4 inch head of a slightly off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt and spices. Fits the style. Has a smooth and very crisp mouth feel. There was a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt and a little bit of spices (coriander). A little hoppiness is noticeable, but not overpowering by any means. Overall, a little too sweet for my tastes, but worth a try."
"A lovely seasonal offering from our pals in JP. Readily available on draught, which is a grand thing. A clear dark amber pour with a fluffy but not bubbly off-white/beige-yellow head with nice lace retention throughout. The aroma offers a spiced caramel malt as does the taste, although with a fine & not overwhelmingly nice hop floral bitterness. Very drinkable. Very flavorful without gimicky sweet 'flavors.'"
"Lighter Amber color. Big off white head that dissipated quickly. No lacing. Light spice aroma and taste of the same. Expected a darker wintery version. There was a hint of spices in this beer but it was really subtle. Overall a pleasant beer, but nothing special. The body was too thin to make it impressive."
"I can't believe how much better this is on tap.. Its like a different brew..."
"A nice beer for a change of pace. But not one of Sam's best. It has a dark and clear amber color. The scent is ok, but with a slight banana like smell. Its fairly well carbonated and light on the dark roasted malt taste. Actually, its light on both hops and malt. Its easy to drink. Just not something that I would seek out."
"A pretty good beer from Sam Adams - not overpowering, but solid nonetheless."
"Goose Island has consistently put out bad tasting beer. Sam Adams has put out some decent beer, but it all starts tasting the same after a while."
"D_Lots of spices and light body, high repeatability. Not offensive"
"Drinkability: I like it. It is not offensive. It tastes like a very tame IPA with a touch of spices"
"A very good beer. Worth the cost and enjoyed every time I have the opportunity to enjoy it."
"drinkability - great, really easy to go through a six pack each with some good company."
"That being said, there are better holiday spiced beers out there, which is a shame, as I understand this isn't nearly as ""big"" a beer as it used to be. I wish I had been able to sample earlier releases so I would have a basis for comparison."
"Drinkability: A solid winter beer, and very sessionable. It was one of the beers I drank before I really got into craft beers, and I still enjoy it."
"Notes: A nice lager that tastes a lot like a nice brown ale with minimal spicing."
"Nice and crisp beer, but smooth also. Easy drinker. Tastes of aforementioned roasted caramel, and high malt. Light bitterness on this one. Very good winter brew. Recommend."
"Overall - This is one of the best winter beers around. A must try for all, a refill for me!"
"All in all, a pretty darn good beer."
"Samuel Adams Winter Lager poured a nice dark amber color with a nice tan head. The smell was light, with caramel and a hint of hops. The taste was a light sweetness, faintest hint of hops. After it warmed more caramel was present . The mouthfeel was ok. Drinkability was nice. Overall this is a decent bock, a good beer with some nice flavor."
"D: Typical Sam Adams -- competently brewed, but certainly not offensive for the public en-masse."
"Once again, another perfectly good offering from Sam Adams. Not my first pick for winter beers, but definitely acceptable."
"Overall, a good brew and a definite recommendation."
"D. Pretty drinkable but not the best winter beer to have. Ill pass"
"D - Drinkable, however im not so sure i would go out of my way to have another. Doesnt pack the presence and flavor that id expect from a winter beer."
"Nose is good balanced combo of rich malts, spices and hops. Taste is good and is a nice change from some of the over produced holiday beers. It is smooth and balanced on the palate with a combination of moderately rich malts, sweet caramel, holiday spices and a nice hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation level leaves an extra smooth almost creamy finish. Two thumbs up on this one."
"D-This is a good beer, very drinkable and a classic winter seasonal. This beer probably has a lot of nostalgic appeal, as it's one of the earlier craft beers that I encountered. Beyond the nostalgia, though, this one is a good one."
"This beer is average in my opinion. It doesn't take any risks, and just gets by as usual."
"Just what I'd expect from the Boston Beer Company. I don't know how unique this brew is in terms of a winter seasonal, but it's put together very well. It's said that you must look at the whole picture to appreciate it; you would be wise to do the same with this one. It's quite hearty and will definately keep you warm during the cold months - a must-try."
"Color is a nice clear coppery amber with a decent head. Aroma is fairly strong, malty with a firm undertone of spice and a hint of caramel. Flavor matches the aroma, malty and spicy with caramel and nutty hints. Texture is lively and jazzy, leaving a pleasing finish."
"A nice, basic but tasty winter seasonal overall. It's very easy to drink and just a solid brew overall. It won't knock your socks off, but it won't disappoint either."
"I tend to be a fan of the Sammy seasonals - no exception here. Solid session effort."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Really nice session winter brew that goes down easy with decent flavors. Sure the look and smell isn't that great but this is a brew you have several of in a session and pound. Still pretty damned good."
"Taste & Mouthfeel: Delicately sweet malt with an almost peppery hop taste. The aftertaste leaves a little bit of sugar on the tongue with a burnt hops taste prevailing. The carbonation works well with the hops profile."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"Overall, this is a super-drinkable, sweet malty beer that I look forward to having a couple of times each winter."
"Overall this is not significantly better on-tap, although I kind of get the impression that the tap lines might not be the most clean in the world. Worth a shot either way."
"Overall: Like most Sam Adam brews, I'm not quite a fan. Their attempt to make micro-brewed taste with macro-brew practices lands them somewhere in between. I wish they could focus more on improving their flavors and less on targeting the mass consumer with generic flavors that prove a ""jack of all trades but master of none."""
"Thanks jim."
"D - Pretty drinkable because its smooth and light but nothing interesting. I was hoping for more."
"Had this on-tap at Olive Garden (not what I expected) in a 220z pilsner glass (again, unexpected) and found it quite tasty (as expected) the beer was a medium amber with orange-ish color under a 1"" off-white head that dissipated pretty quickly leaving some decent if not overly impressive lacing on the glass. The smell was hard to quantify perhaps due to the restaurant surroundings but light malt and even a lighter spice were present. The taste was first sweet malt (caramel?) and spice (nutmeg, allspice?) with a very light hop finish overshadowed by the spice. The beer was a bit thin but with decent carbonation so the mouthfeel was rather nice. The drinkability was good and I'd have had a couple of more if I hadn't been driving. Ciao Bella"
"D - A seasonal winter brew that could be enjoyed year round... Easy to drink and highly sessionable... Not overly impressed by any specific characteristics, but it's just a solid and enjoyable brew..."
"I've started the Christmas meal off with one of these for the past couple years and it complements the heavier menu nicely which apparently is something they were aiming for with this brew. You could easily drink 2 or 3 with the course of the meal although I usually move on to something a bit heavier after the first glass. Nothing extraordinary but surprisingly good for something that is so common. In all likelihood, I'll be having this again at the next holiday gathering."
"Tasty and highly drinkable. My father had a six for me on Christmas eve and I had no problem killing it dead. I might've even kept going had there been more."
"mouthfeel is crisp, dry, and quite sweet. very easy to drink/session - yum"
"Had this one on Friday at a christmas party. Dark pour, wheat flavor, nice hoppy beer, nice spices as well, not bad I am warming up to Sam Adams beers. Overall this beer was a pretty good beer, my friend stuck with the Hoegaarden. He tends not to like hoppy beers."
"D - I could have a few of these. This is an enjoyable winter brew."
"Compared to others in the style, this is very drinkable. I will definitely have this again, time after time. I love the winter seasonals!"
"Highly recomended for your winter enjoyment."
"D: Definitely easy to drink for the flavor it has."
"Other comments: A good beer, but would be improved with just a touch more bitterness maybe approaching the level of bittering used in their Boston Lager. I used a bottle of this and a bottle of Old Fezziwig in batter for cod last night and that was damn good!"
"I tried this on tap last night while out for dinner. Overall an enjoyable beer. Appearance is a dark amber color, slightly darker than the normal sam adams. As I drank it down the beer left a bit of lacing on the sides of the glass. Mouthfeel was not outstanding but gave a 'full sensation' and went well with my steak. Certainly a beer that I would have again but not an all time favorite."
"Reviewed on: 12-10-2008 16:24:57(My Birthday)"
"Drinkability is definitely high. I can imagine being snowed in and drinking a six pack of this, nice balanced brew."
"Very drinkable , light refreshing. Is advertised as being brewed with winter spices but i really could not pick any up. Malts are very pronounced , would buy again"
"The Winter Lager finishes well, with a slight bitterness and smokiness that lingers on the palate."
"Overall I wouldn't rank this beer as an elite beer but its as good as it gets for a beer made by a more advertised beer company then your typical micro brewery."
"A highly carbonated brew with a slight creaminess and a nice lager."
"Drinkability: Definitely thought this was an Herb/Spiced beer when I tred it. Spices are too overwhelming to make this an easy drink. Other than that it's not bad though."
"Beer is drinkable and i enjoy this beer the most when it is paired with chicken wings."
"D=easy to drink but unfulfilling. I probably wouldn't order it again."
"D- Easy to drink, although the lack of hops makes it harder for me to drink this beer. May give it a shot again some day, but only as a last resort."
"D: I'm very tempted to have another and will look forward to the rest of the bottles in my sampler case."
"I just tried this beer side by side with Samual Adam's Boston Lager and I hate to admit but there wasn't a whole lot of difference. The Winter Lager poured a couple shades darker and there is a presence of spices in the aroma. It has almost the same malty taste but, again, there are spices added...a little more peppery. It has more carbonation than the Boston Lager but same mouthfeel and drinkability. I have to admit my respect for Sam Adams went down a notch after trying this. I guess those 21 proclaimed beer styles will eventually bump into one another eventually."
"12oz. bottle poured into regular pint glass. A very lovely coppery-orange color. About 1 1/2-2 fingers of head that quickly dissapated. Nice lacing on the glass. Not much aroma, but what there is, is very pleasant. The spice aroma translate better into flavor when tasted. Not much body, very thin mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer. I could see this being a good companion to a long session. The flavor and spice aren't overpowering as is the case with many winter seasonals."
" I don't know why I didn't like this the last time I drank it. Very enjoyable. An easily sessionable brew."
"which leads to this beer being easily very drinkable"
"Pours a dark amber/light brown with a fairly thin head that fades to a thin ring. Smells lightly malty and slightly spicy with nutmeg and cinammon and there is a slight grainy sourness. The taste is pretty mellow, but nicely integrated with gentle malt, light spice, and a clean minerality and slight lager twang. Smooth and mellow in the mouth with a bit of spice on the finish and just a hint of chocolate. Pleasant and easy to drink, but somewhat forgettable."
"Pours a bronze/brown with an orange tint. Thick, white head. Smells super malty. Tastes of a bit of clove and wheat, mostly caramel malt, a bit vinous. No hops to speak of. Adequate carbonation- something that BBC always seems to get perfectly right. Very good stuff, here. Try it out."
"D - I could easily have a six pack of this...balanced just right between the sweetness and creaminess"
"This was the third of several different beers that I had at tonight's party and was one of the most pleasing of the bunch. Poured a dark amber with a soda pop head that doesn't lasts but gives off yummy aromas of cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon??? and other spices that are very enticing. Tastes like all of the above spices compressed into deliciously toasted malts that are well-backed with citrusy hops. Nice enough feel but I agree with the recent reviewers below who would've preferred that it be heavier. Overall: probably one the best you can find at a major supermarket for next couple of months."
"Perfect mouthfeel for a beer of this kind with controlled carbonation and appropriate body. When SA gets one right it really gets one right. I still think too many of their beers suffer from an insistence to try everything, but their hits (Boston Lager, Black Lager, Oktoberfest) are excellent. Maybe they should just stick to lagers..."
"This is a pretty neat winter offering, and I'd happily have it again. However, I don't think it's the kind of beer I'd be likely to hunt down, as I do see room for improvement in the nose and flavour, and have found beers that carry off this style better."
"Easy to drink lager. I've had several of these at one time and enjoyed them all."
"Drinkablilty: This beer is definately a go to beer for nights where I want to have a few beers during a game. Its full of flavor and it has a decent amount of alcohol that it hides pretty well. Overall I would buy this beer again and again but if you were looking for a more serious winter bock I would search elsewhere."
"The beer is very creamy, nicely carbonated for a bock beer, has a burnt brown sugar, roasted sweet grain flavor. There are ample nutmeg type spices, maybe a little nuttiness in the background. There is a bit of a hop presence right at the finish, but the sweet malts, the roasted grains, the raisiny sweet fruits, the burnt or charred brown sugars, the creaminess throughout, and the medium bodied, sweet orange peel presence amply defines this beer. This is surprisingly good. I've turned away from many SA products because they are sometimes pale imitators. Not so this bock beer. It is quite good and well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"d: Sweeter than I'd like, but not bad overall."
"Dark transparent caramel color with small white head. A quite unpleasant aroma of sugary, syrupy, molasses with dark fruit tones. The taste is one of a traditional bock but downgraded with massive amounts of sugary sweet syrup. Deep dark fruits with some medicinal characteristics and Aunt Jemima syrup to top it off. There's an aspect of artificiality that revolves around the drink that turns me off like a Runts banana compared to a real banana. If you're looking for the best or better, don't bother with this one."
"D- You could easily drink a six pack of this with good friends on a cold winter night."
"Re-review...drank a lot of this over the winter, bottled and on tap, and it was solid all around. Like most of Jim's beers, I'd like to see it taken up a notch, but kudos to him for what he is doing, and I must remember he is brewing for the masses. SA seasonal is usually the only viable choice in the sea of macros available at such places as Fridays. I definately prefer Winter over the standard SA Boston."
"D: Tastes pretty much like I remembered from when it first came out. Not too terribly interesting, but a good session beer."
"I guess you could have these one after another, but I couldn't buy a case of this stuff. Decent, but not over the top. Can sip or have with food. Worth a try."
"D: Nothing stands out good or bad. It's fairly drinkable but it might be hard to get all the way through this keg."
"12oz bottle served in SA Sensory Pint. Best by March 2009 notched on the bottle. Poured a deep translucent copper with a half inch loose white cap embedded with clusters of grape-like rings. Head quickly dissipated into a swirl of foam with a solid ring around the shoulders. Nose is malty with a touch of spice. Taste follows nose with some additional caramel character and a light hops bittering at the finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied, but closer to light with a subtle background effervescence. Easy drinking and flavorful seasonal."
"D-This one let me down a little this year I remember really liking it last year and im not sure if its due to how much my palate has changed or what, but with all the fantastic winters out there I cant see picking this one up again this year."
"Drinkability is very good if you are looking for a spicy winter lager."
"Drinkability is good; the spices give a warming sensation. That is welcomed on a day with cold rain and snow and a temperature near freezing."
"D- Excellent winter beer. Sweet with a well balanced spice note. These go down very nice on a cold winter night."
"Notes: A good sessionable winter offering from SA. It hits the right notes (hint of winter-type spices, some warmth from alcohol) without going overboard anywhere. Nicely balanced and enjoyable."
"Drinkability is good but the sweetness and spice would get old pretty quickly."
"Very drinkable brew. A nice easy drinking amber lager."
"pours a crystal clear amber with a decent big bubbled head that dissipates rapidly. Smells slightly sweet some what metallic. Cant detect any spices or much hops. Taste is nice, toasty malt, ginger, honey, maybe nutmeg or something i cant quite place. Very nice taste. It has a warming feel to it. Carbed just right. It has a very soft feel to it, very enjoyable. It's almost cottony toasty sweet. Wonderful brew, probably my favorite sam adams beer. A must have on a cold night like tonight. I'm so glad I bought a 6 pack! Yummy Yummy Yummy!"
"Deep copper hue with a thin white head. The nose is nutmeg, cinnamon, toasted malt, wheat, hints of honey and citrus. The taste is peppery, really citrus and acidic. There where hints of spices. This wasn't a bad lager is was rather nice and warming for those cold nights."
"Smooth like all Sam Adams products but not much else."
"Better than average atmosphere, good flavor and drinkability. Really good balance."
"D: Goes down very well, an excellent cold weather drink!"
"M-"
"D- Drinks damn well for a hearty brew"
"D - Low ABV, excellent flavor that screams winter is here.."
"Overall: A great beer and a wonderful one to have during the holidays. So much so that my wife initially drank most of my first beer and then ordered one for herself -- and she is not a beer drinker. You can't go wrong with this one. Recommended."
"Poured aggressively into a pint glass a murky copper color with little to no head. Tons of tiny bubbles rising to the top. Smells of malt and spice but not overwhelmingly so. Tastes pretty much the way it smells. Sweet malt and spices with enough bitterness to balance it all. I have and will drink a few more of these."
"Good beer, overall. Easy to drink enough to drink, though there are some barely noticable odd notes in the taste and mouthfee."
"After reading the description of a bock this was really true to style, more like a review of this beer."
"D: Very drinkable. Good choice depending on what may be available. More flavor would helb this beer."
"D - I could have had two more of these without thinking about it. A great flavor, and good drinking beer."
"Bottle. Auburn pour, minimal head. Weak aroma of malt, spice, and some citrus. Flat flavor. More malt than anything else. Not really what I expected from a bock. Thinner than it should be, and lacking in substance. Didn't quite get the spiciness everyone else raves about. Decent, but a lot weaker than I hoped for."
"Creamy tan head, ruby colour. Aroma of spices, ginger, cinnamon, malt sweet. flavour is malty, sweet, caramel, christmasy spices. very smooth mouthfeel. This is not a spectacular beer in that it is not aggressive in any way, but looking att the beautiful lacing, smelling the aroma of christmas and feeling it's warming soft quality puts you in the christmas spirit like no other beer!"
"Would get again."
"Not going to have this one again."
"Overall, a very nice lager; one of Sam Adams' better offerings."
"D - A sweet beer without being overdone, and an excellent combination of malt and spice. Not as heavy and overpowering as I remember it on tap from the night before. I'll definitely be picking up more of this before the season is up."
"D - This a great example of a Christmas beer with enough of a Bock characteristic to let both crowds enjoy, a wonderful seasonal"
"Beer pours a solid amber color with a strong, slightly sticky head. Husky malt aroma with a spice character. A medium bodied, smooth lager. The maltiness indicates the bock influence of this beer but the husky grain could be a little more bold. The beer finishes quick with some pleasant spice and a little hop bitterness. An earthiness pervades the entire experience. Not overwhelming and a good drinking beer."
"I've had this beer at least once that past few years, and keep Overall, I feel that this beer lacks a true sense of what it wants to be. The list of ingredients in this beer sounds convincing, however they are imbalanced and seem to clash with one another. I think with a proper cohesion in flavor (perhaps more malt would work?), this could be a winner."
"Aroma and flavors of spicy, earthy malts with a touch of sweetness. Hops kick in toward the end with a light pine touch, although nothing is too overbearing here. A little weak overall. A dry finish."
"Pours a medium brown red color body, with a white head that is lasting. Has a slight aroma of hops, some spices, and maybe wheat? A nice taste of spices, some barley. Dry in the palate, a pale taste. Might be a little old."
"Definitely a very good beer! One of Samuel Adams best beers. A great winter brew"
"This is still a very good beer. I remember this one being a little better a few years back."
"Maybe this is better on tap, I've had this 3 times on tap in the past 2 nights and it sure is a treat. A nice dark brown in color, awesome lacing, a nice size head.. smell is of rich caramel and spice, a decent combination of malty characteristics, goes down smooth in the mouthfeel, decent carbonation. This is a beer that you have to have on tap to experience it's real potential, SA's Winter Lager continues to be my go-to beer on tap this year only because it's stayed the same over the past few years and BBC hasn't screwed with the formula. Overall, this is a sure pleaser this coming winter if your in search for a tasty, hearty beer on tap."
"Not great but definitely not bad. Sessionable and enjoyable."
"Drinkability is as about high as it gets. This is a great beer with just about anything. Today it was pizza. YUMMY!"
"Poured hard at the bar in a pint glass. A wonderful honey color with a spirited 2 finger head that lasted forever. A nice aroma of sweet malt that was complimented with a flowery hop presence. Great tasting brew, just enough hops to not let the malt overpower. A hint of orange rounds it out making for an excellent flavor. The beer is rich and complex yet drinks easily. All in all a fine beer"
"mid body. good carbonation. i like this beer. i end up with a couple twelve packs every year."
"I love the taste, it is also very drinkable, not at all overly spicy as i was afraid, but slightly, just hints, and it was biscuity, malty, well rounded. Mouthfeel I would say is around average for sam beer, good carbonation, substantial"
"This is one of BB's best! and I'm not afraid to say it."
"Sweet malts and hops smells which come through in the taste. I like the carbonation and smoothness of this brew. One thing about Sam Adams beers is that they are full bodied - you can tell they take time in the brewing."
"Very drinkable, though much more breadlike in character than would be expected, and certainly falling behind in the flavor profile of the bottled version."
"D- This is a good brew, nothing too great, I have had many better bocks"
"Like I said, i could only drink four in a night before moving on to something a bit better at the bar."
"Not a bad beer, just not a great beer. Only slightly better than average."
"D: It goes down fairly easily. A good winter-time gulper, for sure."
"Pretty easy drinking, but nothung special."
"M + D: A rather straight forward feel... medium bodied, carbonation is about right. Inoffensive, easy drinking."
"Pours a deep brown color with a nice white head that disappears rather quickly. Aroma is that of cinnamon and ginger along with a malty sweetness and some citrus. Taste is rich and full bodied, nice malt flavor good balance in the spice department. The orange zest is a nice touch, not too heavy, blends in well with the cinnamon and ginger. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. A good beer for a cold winters' nite."
"Thinish as most Sam Adams are, this could use more body. But it drinks well, and is satisfying. I would say to them, save the additions, they don't really come through, just up the malt a bit. If you want a beer with good cinnamon/ginger see Great Lakes' Christmas Ale, are really good one."
"The feel of this beer is medium and is pretty drinkable. It goes down well and has a nice smooth feel."
"M - A little lighter then I expected but not too light. Adds to the drinkability of this. Not a heavy beer but not too light either."
"Notes: Well this one is still tasty and will more than likely continue to be. Although it is not pack a punch like it used to it can hold it's own rather well. Cheers"
"I'd consider this a medium to light bodied beer. It has a nice texture, and pretty tame carbonation. Very nice beer for this time of year. I could see myself picking up a sixer of these for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner."
"Pretty easy to drink. Good balance of spice vs. malt and hops. Probably the best thing this beer has going for it."
"This beer is a favorite. My highest review so far."
"My first experience with a winter brew; not too heavy but just right."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. The brew pours a dark red color with a long lasting white head. The smell is unremarkable. There is a slight malt sweetness, but nothing else sticks out. The taste is pleasnt malt with a dry finish. I do not taste any of the spices. The beer is full bodied and quite drinkable. An enjoyable part of the mixed pack, but I think it used to be better."
"I poured this 12 ounce beer into a pilsner glass. It pours a copper/amber color with a 1 and a half finger beige head. The smell is a bit of a vegetable like malt, not too different from a typical amber. The taste is fairly well balanced with slightly muddy caramel flavors. Could use a bit more of a hop bite. There is a light to medium mouth feel, slightly sticky. This is a sessionable beer for when the mercury starts to drop. I would probably like to break it up with a stout or a slightly more hoppy PA if I was tossing down several."
"D: I had a nice mini session that could have gone on long into the night. It was balanced, tasty, light-bodied and had a modest ABV."
"This beer pours an extreme copper color. It is rather deep and glows slightly. There is a thin ivory head that fades fast, lace minimal but sticks to the side of the glass. Smell is more sweet then spicy. There are slightly muted hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, malty sweetness subdued overall with a burned caramel. Taste is all over the place, spice, sweet, malts all hit the taste buds. It's not a stand out beer - but one that you can easily go back to. Feel is lighter then expected in a winter lager. Overall, I am not a big fan of Sams brews...however, the winter lager is more palatable than other brews. I wouldn't purposely go buy a six pack of this, but certainly would not turn it down!"
"This is a very light version of a winter beer, as far as winter beers go, normally. However, I think this wheat lager was clearly intended to be this way. Easy drinking."
"D- easy enough to put back a few. one of the better lagers from boston beer. 2-3 in a sitting would be plenty"
"D: This is not the Winter Lager of a few years ago but the lower ABV makes it much easier to consume a few."
"D - Great with a hearty meal."
"This is very nice, a good start to my trying of winter brews!"
"Drinkability is excellent. I always remember this as a good beer, but I am amazed at how much I am enjoying it this year! Like I said earlier, everything I have had from this year's winter sampler is better than I remember. Highly enjoyable and highly recommended."
"D - Not the best offering I've had from Sam Adams, but not a bad brew. Definitely doesn't fit a winter warmer style. 3.5"
"Had one at Bruins game recently (B's beat the Pens 3-0) and Sam Adams seems to have upped the spice. Eew."
"Pours a dark brown/orange with sudsy eggshell head and spotty lacing. Smell: mostly caramel with some wheat in the background, vague spice, herbal hops. Taste: toasted, caramel malt, sweet, some notes of cinnamon, orange juice/ginger/leafy hops. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, slick, sticky finish. Pretty good, could be a bit heftier."
"The Sam Winter Lager is a nice, highly drinkable beer. Nothing fancy, but they do a very good job here by keeping it simple and not trying to overdo it. I am not a fan of the Sam's Summer Ale, but the Winter Lager is one that I return to every season when I get tired of the over-spiced christmas beers out there. A reliable brew, this one."
"Drinkability: This had been my favorite winter brew for years, mainly because it never disappoints and is widely available during the winter months. I have enjoyed this beer from bottles and straight from the tap."
"I would drink this again anytime"
"Overall: ""Always a good decision."""
"D= good veryy nice for a winter night"
"Mild, balanced flavors make this one a pretty drinkable winter beer."
"Winter Lager is a decent beer, though there are many better seasonal offerings that I'd choose to enjoy on a ""cold"" southern California night."
"A great darkish tan pour, with a fluffy off white head. Tastes malty sweet with low hop bitterness. Id have liked if it had a bit more ABV, but all in all a decent representation of style. Full bodied and smooth, it goes down easy, and as we all know, Sam Adams makes some devilishly drinkable beer."
"D: Even though being quite the mouthful, this is a really easy drinker, I could have a session with this beer, simply because it isn't bursting with flavor and doesn't overwhelm the senses. Nice beer all around. But kinda bland in the nose and that translates to the taste as well."
"M/D: The beer had a light-to-medium body, a little light in the level of carbonation, and maybe a little watered down. The beer was smooth and crisp and easy to drink. Overall an average beer, kind of par for the course with Sam Adams."
"All in all quite drinkable lager, nice interpretation of the style, though it does play things a bit safe."
"well balanced and great for the non-beer drinker's seasonal"
"D: Not real heavy of a beer with a relatively low ABV."
"Not a bad fall back beer during winter since this is pretty much everywhere, with a modest ABV you can drink a bit of this and not worry too much."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, it tastes good and it goes down well. Low ABV for a bock though. One of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams."
"Drinkability - I was kind of expecting a let down on this one, but it turned out alright. Rather enjoyable while not too heavy overall."
"D - Since it is the holiday season, and there are sooo many wonderful beers to try, I will have to see you next year...unless I purchase another Winter Classic Sampler that is. Your stout and porter brothers are the reason that I purchase the Sampler though. Sorry."
"D- A rather great winter beer. The spices aren't overpowering as featured in many other winter brews. Decent amount of alcohol to warm up with, but perhaps too much to make a session winter beer out of this."
"D--Not too bad at all!"
"D: Unsurprisingly, this is a nice, above average across the board brew from SA. I'd have liked to see a more aggressive hop and spice presence, but there's nothing wrong with what they've done here."
"Pours a dark amber/red color very active carbonation nice two finger white head. smells sweet and a little chocolatey, taste of some ginger, I dont know if I taste that just becuase it says it on the box but it also says cinnamon and but I dont taste that. Mouthfeel is good, fairly fizzy in the mouth but nothign special. I will finish this 6 pack but probably won't seek this out again, nothing special."
"another great beer by SAs"
"A nice dark copper pour with a one finger white head. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt and some spice. The flavor really shines, sweet malt with a hint of citrus,some cinnamon, maybe some coriander ,very balanced. Creamy mouthfeel,with soft carbonation,and a dash of hops in the finish. A solid offering. Thanks Sam"
"Nicely drinkable. A good beer, but not overly complex. I wish there was a bit more to it."
"Future outlook: Another solid addition to the Samuel Adams Winter Classics Mix Pack, which I will surely pick up again next season."
"This is a beer that seems just right for a celebration and it may not be the best beer for the coldest days, but it sure is a winter beer. It seems to get better as you drink more of it, and it leaves you with a good aftertaste. Definitely worth the try and I know I'll be getting it again for special occasions this winter and hopefully for winters to come. Again- highly recommend."
"And I love the colors on the label."
"D - A nice easy beer to relax with in the winter, I plan on having a few more of these throughout the season."
"MF&D - IMO, not a Bock at all, but nevertheless a quality beer. Great beer to quaff throughout the Holiday Season. Seasons Greetings!"
"This beer of dark robust brown was poured into a pint glass. Giving itself a good frothing of head and a lingerence of lace. The aroma is a good mixture of cinnimon and hoppier beer. When tasting a slight cinnimon taste is there that mixes with the ginger giving a good amount of flavor for a Sam Adams beer drinker."
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark copper color with a light tan head that fades to a nebulous cap. Big thick sweet malt aroma with some cinnamon and wheaty esters. Flavor is less sweet with dark malts, ginger, and noble hops. Semi dry finish, thinnish body. No real distinguishing features here. Needs to be thicker and sweeter to be a good winter beer."
"Drinkability is very good and I am looking forward to having more of these through the season, as long as it is available that is! Last year it dissapeared from the store long before Winter actually arrived. An excellent beer!"
"D= This was an easy drinking beer that I will gladly order again when I am at a ""non-beer"" restaurant. Moderate alcohol and good flavor make this highly sessionable."
"Drinkability is high. It's a solid beer with decent flavor and easily enjoyable. One of my favorite from SA, and one of my conversion beers."
"This is one of my favorite Sam Adams beers, and one of my favorite American bocks. Very tasty and highly recommended."
"Like almost everything else from Samuel Adams, Winter Lager is a decent, solid representation of the intended style, but it makes its way softly, without kicking in any doors or breaking any new ground. The brew is medium-bodied and very smooth with light carbonation, and is highly drinkable."
"Good drinkability, and the slightly higher ABV is well-masked. Seems to be getting better the warmer they get and the more I drink!"
"Pretty firmly carbonated yet the reduced bitterness makes this beer a bit more drinkable. Nonetheless the comparisons to Boston Lager are undeniable. And this is slightly better, and in fact a bit reminiscent of the BL of yore, but not quite...."
"The nose on the beer has a bit of hops to it with a nice toasty malt hint to it. There is a slight bit of dark malts as well. The beer pours with an inch head, and the beer has a dark copper colour to it. It looks incredibly clear with a fair amount of carbonation. There is a sweetness that comes out more when the beer is poured. The beer is sweet, bitter, and toasty. It's almost like an oktoberfest with a focus on complexity rather than drinkability. There is the usual lager crispness that is expected though. The sweetness tastes absolutely wonderfull. I'm really surprised at the great balace of the sweetness, bitterness, and toastiness, yet leaving some room for complexity. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but with a lot of carbonation. For the amount flavours, this beer is very drinkable."
"Overall, a good beer to grab-- especially for someone who isn't into ""darker"" beers"
"This beer is wonderful. It pours a beautiful cooper color and has a foam that lingers. Low carbonation. This beer is just wonderful with just the right amount of winter time spice. I was really surprised by how good this beer really was and I must say it is one of the best that Sam Adams puts out. I like Sam Adams but this is absolutely one of their better brews! Highly recommended and one I will be buying all winter!!"
"Drinkability: Oh how I wish this wasn't my last one (I have been saving it for almost a year now)! And I do wish so primarily due to the fact that it holds a balance between the -- almost -- equally satisfying smell and taste experiences, wich qualifies Sam' Adams Winter Lager as a definite ""let's have another one, eh?!""-er!"
"The taste brings cinnamon to the game along with the orange, light chocolate and corriander. It is smooth and hits mostly at the back of the tongue with a little bitterness that is welcome after all the spice. It is clean and refreshing!"
"Sam Adams is the best value on the american market for beer. Although this is not my favorite beer, it's up there and it's always a trusty option when a bar doesn't have a good selection of beer. You can never go wrong with a Sam Adams product."
"Had a rough morning so I cracked one of these SOB's open because it had often been a winter warmer for me in the past; I reviewed the appearance and jumped in the shower. (Yes, I drank this in the shower and wrote the rest by memory after my morning coffee). Out of the bottle this beer was a copper/amber color leaning towards the dark side with some visible rising carbonation. The head was tan, displayed nice retention and lacing too. The aroma was mostly spices and malt with some sweetness. The flavors were first caramel and chocolate malt blended with winter spices, nutmeg and cinnamon followed by a bite of hoppiness at the end. The suddenness of the hops gave the beer a slightly astringent quality. Still, the body was medium, the carbonation average and the mouthfeel good. It didn't save my day, but this beer totally took the edge off my morning."
"Taste is similar to the aroma, the caramel and the trademark strong hoppiness of Sam Adams. Toasted malt as well. Fairly mellow and plain going down, also quite tart. However clean and clear while being easy to drink. This is an updated review from almost 2 years ago, and I know find this beer much better than before."
"I must say, this seasonal offering from Sam Adams sort of let me down. I like almost all of their beers but this one just wasn't doing it for me. I tried it plenty of times but found it to be lacking too much in overall flavor. The appearance is beautiful and it is a good beer body wise, but the flavor department is just lacking way too much for me."
"Second best Sam Adams you can get. The flavor is very rich, and delicious. Highly recomend this beer. Has nice head and is good with a nice dinner of lets say steak and potatoes. It warms the heart when you drink it, even if the beer is ice cold. When winter rolls around, def. pick some up."
"Dark amber in color with the spices that make it a good seasonal beer. I still prefer the Sam Adams Lager or the Boston Ale over this one, even in the winter. Spicy, malty aroma, medium tan head and a pretty good amount of lacing. This is a little more hearty than their standard lager. Malty and spicy with some sugar notes in the taste. A sour finish and aftertaste. A decent seasonal selection from Sam Adams."
"D-Nothing crazy, more or less a bready, fruitier, spiced version of Boston Lager. This is fine non-offensive, tasty with a nice nose. I wouldn't turn it down but, if given a choice, there are better holiday offerings available."
"Enjoyed a couple of these on tap at a pub the other night, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Although it was served up in a plastic cup It was still a very good experience. Poured a dark amber color with a thick creamy tan head. The aroma was spicy and malty, very appealing. The flavor was fantastic very malty and sweet with a well balanced mix of spices and citrus notes. Thick mouthfeel and the beer finishes creamy and smoooth. I would order this one again in a heartbeat."
"Pours out of the bottle a caramel Color, with smell of sweet fruits. Nice creamy head and very creamy and flavorfull. It is very nice in your mouth Refreshing. It has a sweet Finish to it at the end The only thing about Sam Adams I don't like they price all their beers to high! I will most likely Get a case again next winter, As this beer is a great product!"
"D: Decent drinkability with a good hearty wheat bock body and subtle spicings makes this a decent brew that along with a fairly low abv could be easily drunk in multiples."
"drinkability- not the best Bock that I've had and not the worst, Its just alright."
"Anyway, it poured a clear amber brown with a slight head that stuck around just lightly. At first it was a little roasty and included some spice flavor matched with some hops with a good balance; but as I drank more of it it became more and more yeasty, the yeast seemed to dominate the flavor for me and the mouthfeel. I was really expecting some roasted malts in this but was a little let down. The flavor made sense though because the label says ""a dark WHEAT lager brewed with winter spices."" SA seems to really like including wheat in all their seasonals. And again Sam Adams meets expectations, can't say I've ever been WOW'd but they always meet your expectations well."
"A dark amber beer with an average tan head. The nose and taste are a little light for my idea of a good bock. There are toasty grains, subtle hops and some caramel sweetness. Good start, but needs more. The body is clean and light with marginal carbonation. Another session brew from Sam Adams."
"This beer is matched up very well with its season. It's best served in a cold glass in the low 40's F. The head is fairly frothy and the appearance is a dark golden color. The taste is strong and refreshing, with hints of cinnamon or nutmeg. It's one of my favorite winter seasonals. Easily a beer you could drink in heavy succession."
"Prost!"
"Drinkability is rather excellent, it's hard to stop drinking this brew and I'm able to savor every last drop and look forward to this beer being re-released every winter."
"For additional Massachusetts winter beers I'd also suggest Wachusetts Winter Lager."
"Drinkability - this is a merely good lager. As for sessionability, I could drink a few of these at a sitting only occassionally."
"I could have a few of these"
"Overall - A very good example of a bock.. very drinkable... recommended..."
"Clear copper pour with a big offwhite head. Smell is tart malt with spices, and I got no wheat from it. Taste is spiced like an english strong ale. Perhaps some biscuity notes. I didn't see this as a weizen bock at all, but still enjoyed the beer. To me this was a classic example of a good Christmas beer. Worth trying and I seemed to have enjoyed it more than my rating indicates."
" aggressive. Still, a decent brew and readily available."
"I could drink this everyday, especially when a 12 pack is on sale for FIVE BUCKS! WHOA!"
"This beer is to the winter what S.A. Summer Ale is to the Summer: A very refreshing, drinkable beer"
"D - This is one of my favorite offerings from Sam Adams and a great addition to the Winter Classics variety case. Very smooth, well-balanced and easy to drink. I could drink these all winter long."
"Overall this is a pretty average beer for me. I really like wheat beers but I think it just tasted too processed."
"D: Definitely a very drinkable beer. Great combination of mouthfeel and taste. Recommended."

"N.B.: the ""freshest by"" month was not notched and this was neither fresh or foul."
"A traditioanl lager with some varied malts and added flavors= a very tasty quaffable brew."
"Pours a nice amber with a good bit of slightly off white head that leaves a touch of lacing as it goes down. Nose is nice, lots of sweet malt, some grapes and fruitiness. Taste is similar, very tasty. Not the post complex beer I've ever tasted, but one I'd drink a fair bit. A nice surprise, actually, much better than I expected. Feel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this one was a nice treat. Not a super beer, but one I could sip on for days."
"I had this on tap this evening while bowling (not that that matters). The Winter lager had a nice Amber color that I liked, but had no head. This was probably due to the glassware at the bowling alley, so I still gave it a 3.5 for appearance. If I were judging it against style, it doesn't taste like a bock to me. If I were judging it as a continental lager, or a European dark lager, it would get big points. The malty flavor dominates, but it's not too sweet. I drank it pretty quickly, so it must have been decent. For the record, it was the only beer that I had tonight, so I feel confident in my rating."
" a D+, I didn't intend for it to be quite that low. I stand by my statement above, at the worst it is a C-, no lower."
"Poured a fizzy yellow like a macro..wait..it is a macro!! Smell is sugary carmel and fruit like aromas. Taste is raisin and caramel with just a hint of hop bitterness.Really sweet and pretty good. Decent and typical Sam Adams. Still, SA could do a whole lot more than these weak efforts seem to offer."
"Has a copperish body with ruby tint with a small head that receded with no lacings. The smell is rather bland; picked up some spice with the malts and some hop sharpness, but nothing stood out. The taste was alright, I picked up some hops and hints of caramel malt that balanced out real good for a smooth, light to medium body that contained some spice. Nothing real standout, especially for a winter seasonal, but it gets the job done."
"drinkability...nice...wish is was avaliable more often."
"Aroma is sweet grainy malts with piney hops and some spices with a touch of yeast. Pour yeilds a clear amber-tinged brown beer with a large off-white head that has good lacing. Flavor finishes bitter and salty but pleasent. Yeasty aftertaste. Watery body and fizzy carbonation, but doesn't go down exceptionally smoothly."
"Drinkability: Decent beer but seems like it could be so much more if things were just pumped up a bit. As with many Sam Adams, this is a decent beginners beer but doesn't do much after you have tried other spicy winter beers. This is the downside to the holiday mix pack in my opinion."
"Cheers."
"D- I think I could drink a few at this time of year when it comes out. I wouldnt want to drink a 12er of them, the slightly higher alcohol content was noticeable."
"This is a very tasty Winter Bock and one of the more enjoyable ones from Sam Adams. With a good tate profile and easy drinkibility, it's one that I never hesitate to order up when I'm dining out somewhere."
"D - Good drinkability, and an easily sessionable lager."
"Taste is very crisp, mostly controlled by the caramel malt, not much of else though, very little spice for a winter offering, decent bitterness to round it out and a good amount of carbonation."
"D: Pretty nice beer. I expect a winter brew to have more of a complex baseline and a little more excitement to it. Overall, not bad. I think this is a good brew for appealing to the masses."
" I had this beer as part of a holiday mini tour of several seasonal holiday beers. While some were more flavorful this one seemed in line in the general taste department. It was much lighter and more watery though which makes it either more or less drinkable depending on your taste."
"12 oz. bottle poured into pint glass. Rich amber color with off-white head which dissipates. No lacing. Aroma is of burnt caramel and ripe fruit. Flavor of toffee, pale malt, and burnt caramel. Finishes rich and slightly sweet. Light mouthfeel lends itself to high drinkability."
"I remember when this beer used to be a little bit bigger, badder and ... well better. It used to be closer to 7% abv and with a lot more brawn you would expect from a bock. Todays version is decent, a good pick if you are going to a house or dinner party and don't want to rock the boat."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a nice creamy slickness to it. Overall this is a solid and tasty brew. I'd be very happy if this were my best option at a restaurant."
"12oz bottle from Clarendon Wines in Boston. Pours a clear dark gold with decent head and nice lacing. Aroma is all malt. The flavour is pretty nice - and not all malt as I was fearing. It's well rounded with a decent amount of fruitiness. Spices do not stand out, but perhaps they contribute to what I'm tasting. I'm pretty happy with this one."
"D - Not bad, not very complex or impressive tho either. I wouldn't feel too bad wasting the night on this, but I could be drinking something better."
"D: This is one of my new favorites. I'll be drinking a lot more while Sam Adams is still brewing it this winter...and maybe putting it up for the fall."
"Notes: A decent winter warmer that leaves you expecting more. The best way to describe this beer is ""mild and spicy."""
"This is a delicious and complex brew. It had a great amber color and a study, white, 2-finger head. The smell was a bit muted but was pleasing with a fresh wheat smell. It tastes very good with a lot of intermingling, but balanced flavors. There is strong wheat, a bit of noble hops and a few spices I can't quite identify. Ginger? The beer featured a very pleasing and creamy mouthfeel. I could drink it again and again."
"I stumbled onto this beer this past winter (2007). I must say that I really enjoy it! I have always loved the Boston Lager and am very impressed with the Boston Brewing Company's winter offering. The wintery spices really make this brew, as well as the perfect balance, in my opinion, of hops."
"Winter lager poured a dark copper, with a big, frothy head. It smelled sweet, with hops, gingerbread, cinnamon. The beer tasted like it smelled, malty and gingerbreadish with hops at the end. This is a very good brew to have after coming in from the cold."
"D = This is a very drinkable beer, overall good taste and mouthfeel, low enough alcohol to drink easily. I would recommend it."
"Nicely balanced brew I just wish that they could come out with this all year round. Great taste and good warmth makes it good anyday of the year."
"pours a dark amber color with an average head that laces quite well. smell is kinda unique, malty with an essence of belgian yeast, maybe i'm crazy. some fruity aroma as well. taste is pretty good, has some strong malt flavor, as well as some spiciness to it, not sure where it comes from, but it doesn't seem hop derived. another good brew from boston beer"
"Drinkability: A decent wintertime beer and one of the better offerings in the Sam Adams Box of Winter Delights."
"Pours a an amber color with a tannish orange head. Smells of wheat malt. Taste is dry, pretty hoppy, with some spices. Hints of caramel and wheat. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Pretty drinkable, a little high in alcohol for a session beer, but smooth and refreshing."
"A nice amber color on to pour with a soft and kinda stickey head. Has a nice aroma of spices and what seems to be roasted hops. Maybe some maple taste on the drink with a kick of hops which goes down nice and smooth. Finish is a nice roastedness with a bit of a kick added to it. A nice brew some the winter months and something I look foward to often. Sam Adams once again proves to be the best american advertised beer brewer."
"From the winter sampler served in a Celebrator Bock glassbubbly, somewhat creamy pencil-point thin white head on a lively amber body, resembling a dunkela flattening malt with hints of wheat and clovefluctuates in taste between an unsweetened tea and a heavier lagersubtle palate early with a zest as it finishes; esters produce an indistinct yet perceptible fruity finish rather smooth overalldoesnt rival the Boston lager in character or immediacy, but as a lager in a winter mix, appropriate"
"Crisp and clean with a moderate body and mostly slick texture. Higher in carbonation but about average for the style. Primarily malty but still nicely balanced and slightly dry in the finish. A well rounded and very suitable winter brew. A nice change from all the other syrupy, uber-roasty winter brews."
"Drinkability- Highly drinkable beer for those cold winter months. Good session beer for a cold winter night. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability- Not a great brew, but well worth trying."
"Very good seasonal brew."
"Dark amber color with a goodly sized off-white head and nice lacing. The smell is sweet and lightly toasted malts with a bit of earthiness to it. Tastes of sweet malts up front with toasted and earthy flavors following. Finishes dry. Not bad, not bad. I could definitely knock back a few of these on a cold winter evening and have a good time, but not a great beer.."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, with a best by month notch in the front label, into a pint glass. It was a clear ruby color with slight carbonation and lots of lacing. It had a good sized beige head that settled into a thin foam. The aroma was malty with cinnamon - slightly weak in strength. The taste was good but not overwhelming. Followed the taste with malt bite and slight spiciness. Mouthfeel was solid. Overall, it's not a bad beer but doesn't really have you thinking of the next one. Don't see mysefl buying another at a store but might get at a bar if craft selection is weak. (One and done; tap change-up)"
"D - This is definitely, in my opinion, a very drinkable lager. While it may not be the most exciting or flavorful winter lager, its smoothness and maltiness make it an easy, pleasant drink. Definitely a good beer to have on hand for day to day drinking or with a meal."
"D- Overall a good beer, there are no off flavors that distract from the overall quality. I continue to drink this at the bar and at home."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams Pint Glass. Poured a clear amber red with a thin head that melted away quickly. Aroma is malty, caramel and toffee with hints of cinnamon. Taste is malty up front with just hint of spices. Mouthfeel is crisp, medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation. Another good offering from Sam Adams."
"D: The biting hops combine with the light spicyness to lower the drinkability."
"Smell is malts, some roastiness and sweet caramel along with some cinammon. Smell is pretty thin, actually. The malts and spices are there, but they don't seem 'robust' so much as 'a bit aggresive.' Maybe a bit thicker mouthfeel would have helped. Carbonation was medium and nice. Drinkability is okay, but this isn't a beer that i would help myself to unless somebody else was buying."
"Nice brew and interpretation of the style."
"doublebock. Still, a very well crafted brew and worth a shot."
"drinkability - Very nice well balance beer, one of my favorite winter beers. Come in the winter pack or 6pack."
"D- This is a very nice winter brew, it is easy to drink any of these without a problem. Its a shame it is only available for a short time."
"Taste is smooth malt backed up with a hint of cinnamon. For a winter brew, this could be spicier. Not real complex, just really smooth and really easy to drink."
"Ahhhh - Cheers and Merry Christmas!"
"Decent, quaffable, but nothing to write home about. For the price, I can find dozens of better brews available a few feet away."
"Overall, this is a muddled, but drinkable brew. Don't expect to taste what's described on the bottle; however, it is a tasty, warming, and easy-to-drink brew that makes for a great choice after a long day of skiing."
"The taste is a good balance between the malt and hops. A very sweet camel taste, but is balanced nicely by the finish in whihch the spiciness of cinnamon and ginger dominate."
"Poured into pint glass, beer pours a nice shade of amber with somewhat thick head. Somewhat poor retention and no lacing. Smell was very good, very complex. Initially I noticed malt, gingerbread, and some hops I swear, deeper exploration did bring out a touch of cinnamon and some biscuit. Taste was somewhat bland. Dominated by malt however some spices are present, the cinnamon seems to be there but I wish it were a little more pronounced to differentiate it from a basic Bock. Carbonation was moderate and a somewhat thin mouthfeel, dry aftertaste. Overall another mediocre beer from Sam. While I enjoyed it I dont think I would seek it out on its own."
"Not a bad beer but probably wouldn't seek out again."
"Not a particularly complex beer, but worth a try (and has the added benefit of being readily available just about anywhere.)"
"Bought it for the season. Great pour with a really thick head that laced out eventually. Dark amber in appearance with crisp textures. The smell was not overpowering but explicit: wintry aromas, mainly cinnamon, breezily texture the scent. The taste is sweet but a bit watery at the finish. Smooth and light in overall moutfeel. I prefer heavy drinks for the winter, especially for New England winters, but this Boston staple gives us a light but tasty drink for the holiday season. Cheers!"
"This beer poured a reddish copper with a two-finger head. I didn't get much in the smell besides a little bit of malt and a very tiny bit of hops. The taste is pleasant and starts with smooth malts and ends with just a little bit of hop bite and spiciness. The mouthfeel has a medium amount of carbonation and isn't unpleasant. I found this beer very drinkable and could see myself reaching for a couple more."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark amber with 1 cm off white head that is mostly lasting. Aroma is light, only able to get a hint of gingerbread. Initial taste of ginger, spice, and citrus. Hint of hops balanced with sweetness at the end. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, slight lacing. Alcohol is hidden well. Very drinkable beer and look forward to it every year."
"Poured a clear dark amber color with a nice frothy, off white head that retains well. Light lacing on glass. Smells of maltiness and some hop spiciness. Taste is malty, great balance, smooth, light spiciness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated. Good drinkability."
"D - A good choice for the holidays for family. I mean, your average beer drinker should be able handle this with out complaining too much."
"D - Very easy to drink several pints of this."
"I stopped on the way home and picked up a 12 pack, which I'll try tomorrow."
"I was never a really big fan of any Sam Adams brews until I came across this one... This is a truly awesome beer that is one of the best I've tried all season... Pours a ruby-red chestnut color with a one-finger head that lingers for a bit before tapering off... Smell is very complex... slightly smokey with some cinnamon, lemon and spices... Flavor strongly complements the aroma, with some ginger and a smoky essence that really makes this beer a pleasure to drink... wouldn't mind downing a few of these in a single setting.. the drinkability was really good and the mouthfeel was great... This is a wonderful brew and is definitely recommended.. they should make this one available all year 'round..."
"D - Lightly spiced and malty, with a nice clean finish that lets some of the spice come through on the aftertaste. Really nice. Much more drinkable than the bottled version IMO."
"Notes: I bought this in a six pack. I don't think I would buy it more than once a winter because I just am not to into it. It's a good beer, but just not something I will run out to buy."
"Had a large glass of the bock on tap and couldn't tell the difference between tap or the bottle. The color was a medium dark brown with very little tan foam. The smell was a little weak on the roasted malts and hops. Also, the taste was about the same as the aroma. A little weak and lack luster. Not a lot to write home about, just a average beer that had nothing special to write home about. Couldn't pick out anything of interest, just another average ale."
"Always look for this one when the cooler months pass by."
"Poured into a pint glass.Poured a dark caramel color with a thick off-white head.It smells kind of like cinnamon and nutmeg,With a touch of malt characteristics.Has a buiscuit taste,but you can definatley taste the malt in it.This beer has a very light mouthfeel and is very drinkable.Drinking this on a cold winter's night will definatly take off some of the bite of winter."
"Drinkability - Doesn't appear to completely match up with the style. This beer does taste good, though, and that's probably most important. Nice little hint of holiday spice, too."
"On draught. Copper-amber color, with a thick head, leaving lots of lacing. Bready aroma. This beer has a thick, creamy mouth feel. The flavor is malty, with minimal wheat flavor. Hop background is slightly bitter but hardly noticeable. This doesnt make me think ""Winter"" in any way."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and has a medium body. Nice"
"Drinkability- Not a bad seasonal but not something I would drink year round."
"D- A nice bock beer that is pretty simple but still tasty. I will probably buy a 6-pack of this while it's still out in stores. Just a good solid bock."
"Beautiful looking beer. Near perfect dark bronze color with thick creamy lasting off-white head. Sticks to the side of the glass like ocean foam on the shore. I smell sweetness and roasted malt. Good heavy semi-sweet lager flavor. I can't detect any obscure flavors. I only taste good basic beer ingredients. Warming going down. Thick and chewy. This would be a good appetizer before a meal."
"The Winter Lager pours a nice reddish amber with a finger foam head. It has a pillowy head. It has a freshness date which tells you when to drink it by, which is nice. The smell is aromatic of spices of cinnamon and nutmeg. The taste is malty for sure with a biscuit flavor. It has a nice balance of hops to the brew. Overall a wonderful winter style beer."
"I like this SA offering better than any I have had so far. Still, SA could do a whole lot more than these weak efforts seem to offer."
"Drinkability: Simple and direct. It's easy drinking, but not engendering much excitement in my breast."
"Copper color, weak, shallow head. Smells inert. Clean metallic taste that you'd expect from a winter lager. I don't really know what to make of winter lagers except that they are clean with a metallic twinge and are expensive, which doesn't add up to me. Little aftertaste, the beer is gone shortly after it's swallowed. I'd probably drink this as my #2 beer of the night after something stronger to sort of reawaken my senses with something strong enough to clean my palette but clean enough not to leave a lingering, heavy impression. Would buy again for a party or something, but I wouldn't drink a 12 pack myself of it."
"Drinkability- One of the most delightful SA beers Ive ever had, its a winner."
"Overall- It's a solid beer. An easy one to use as a ""go to"" during the winter months, especially when a tap list may be running short."
"This is a winter beer that I look forward to every year and it brings back fond memories of first snows and a good beer shared with good friends."
"D- The smooth rich flavors of malts have enough sweetness to offer body but not sweetness in flavor. The cinnamon is a mysterious flavor that is perfect."
"Sure its drinkable. It is also quite pedestrian. More was expected out of this beer, but didn't quite materialized. This beer is not a bock, but more like a watered down spiced pumpkin drink."
"Had this beer on tap at a local watering hole. It is a light brown with very little head. The nose is spicy and malty, great for the winter season...like a malty gingerbread house. The taste is good, it has the flavor you want in a winter seasonal beer but lighter and refreshing. The mouthfeel is pretty carbonated with some slight oily viscosity. I could and did drink many of these in a sitting."
"D: Uniquely spiced with plenty of malty flavor with a slick, smooth feel."
"Certainly not top shelf, but a noble effort from Sam Adams. Not a bad pick-up."
"A classic winter beer, and one of my favorite Sam Adams, probably second on my list behind the Boston Lager. The appearance is the weak point of the beer, the color is a nice amber color but the head was small and quickly diminishing. The aroma is malt sweetness balanced with Christmas spices and a little bit of toastyness. There is also a slight background of hops and fruity esters. The spices come out more pronounced in the flavor balanced with sweet toasty malt. The mouthfeel is crisp as would be expected with a lager, and is a very drinkable beer."
"Overall this is a solid yet forgettable bock. I wouldn't seek it out but I would definitely drink it if offered."
"Pours a light amber into my Sam Adams specialty glass. By the way, thanks Allstrom bros! Nice, thick tan head that stays around for a bit longer than expected. I wonder if the shape of the specialty glass is behind this apparent anomaly? As the head fades a spotty lacing is left behind for a few drinks. Aromatically there is a very faint hint of spice that precedes some malty goodness. Tastes of sugar, syrup and sweet malts that are perfectly balanced by the hops. Mouthfeel is nice and light bodied yet fulfilling. This is a highly drinkable and tasty beverage that leaves me gratified."
"D: This beer would have gotten a 5 for drinkability because it's tasty, easy and refreshing. The one drawback(?) is the 5.8 ABV witch excludes this from session beer status. Bottom line is this beer would be wonderful 2-3 times around, especially if the weather outside is frightful, but any more than that and you might start losing the ability to respect this particular brew."
"D - it's an easy drinking beer, good seasonal."
"I will look forward to this brew every winter. would be awsome with a spicy steak or maybe a strong fish."
"A nice malty bock with a touch of spice. Great full-body."
"12 oz bottle. A: Red/brown, some tan head that reduces down to a thin caked on layer. Some lacing. S: Roasted malts, cinnamon, clove, vanilla, slightly metallic. T: Nice malt profile; the spices really come through on the finish, along with some slight bitterness. Butterscotch, some very distant tartness. M: Crisp, refreshing, nice robust body. D: Solid winter offering. Good drinkability, the spices are very nice and subtle compared to some other of the winter beers like Harpoon."
"D: A nice malty brew! Easy ABV, very sessionable if it was a year round. Very nice!"
"Drinkability: To me it's another one of those Sam Adams beers that I couldn't care less about. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. It's too bad that I don't adore the taste of dark roasted wheat or I would have enjoyed it more."
"Had this at a friend's party. It was on ice, so I gave it a chance to warm up. Poured a yellow-orange with minimal head, despite a fairly active carbonation. The aroma is unremarkable, a little spice note, but hops are definitely out to lunch. There's a little bit of malt sweetness that's balance by a light spice presence. the spicing is done well, it doesn't hit you over the head with any particular clove, ginger, or other spices. I had a few bottles of Lakeshore Brewery's winter beer a few years back that got relegated to beer bread duty because the spices were so overwhelming. Not a problem here. Rather light-bodied, but not out of style for this lager. The light body and carbonation make this quite drinkable, and the spicing is subtle enough to be interesting as you try to tease out the various flavors. For winter brews I tend to prefer larger ales, but this is a nice effort"
"D - Really good, I can sit back and drink a couple of these."
"Poured this from a 12 oz brown bottle with freshness date clearly marked. Poured a deep copper color with a thin white head that left a bit of lacing here and there. Smell was of faint spices and the taste delivered what was promised. Lots of holiday spices like cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg. Also, wheat is very present. Very malty, though the hops make themselves known. Energizing carbonation helps against the dreary winter days. Another fine offering from Sam Adams."
"If I rated this one strictly on the ""bock"" guidelines, I would have drug it through the mud on body alone.... but the spices and the holiday season makes it more reasonable and acceptable. This is the first Sam Adams beer I reviewed on BA, and I'm sure it obviously won't be the last; but this one needs more body.... but tonight, it sure goes nicely with the jazz."
"Drinkability: Good winter brew. Hearty enough and adventurously flavored to satisfy the winter brew style, without going overboard."
"Pours a rich copper color with a foamy white head that settles and leaves a thin layer covering the top, and sticks to the side of the glass. Smell is of sweet caramel malt, and slim hops. Crisp taste, very little bittering with a smooth mouthfeeling. Nice decent caramel malt aftertaste."
"very clear deep copper with an off white head that doesn't hold too well and leaves a minimal amount of lace. smells pretty good. a nice malty character with spices (nutmeg, clove and cinnamon stand out) and a faint hop character as well. taste is the same. malt and spice play the main role. hops in the finish. light side of medium body. the spices don't suit my palate so well, but this is an average, not bad, winter lager. another run of the mill brew from sam adams that is far from bad, but i don't think i'll pick this one up on my own accord."
"Drinkability is quite good, it has lots of malty goodness, not much hop presence to speak of, goes down smooth and is fairly sessionable."
"...did anyone else notice that this was a flavoured malt liquor? Not at all what i was expecting from Sam Adams. Certainly explains the lightness of this Winter Brew. The spices were nice, but t still feels like a K-Mart version of a Winter Brew to me."
"I can see why I started drinking beer. I never really looked forward to winter except for when I'd start to see Winter Lager show up on tap handles at the bars. I'll continue to come back to this one for as long as they make it."
"Drinkability: Decent, although I probably wouldn't refer to this beer in the winter. I wouldn't even consider it a good beer, with so many others out there that surpass it. Don't bother revisiting."
"D - For a winter warmer its ok it has a good taste it worth a try"
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer decently. It is not a stand out, nor is it something that I will try to seek out (not that it is hard) but if I went to a friends house and this was all he/she had, it would still be a good day!"
"Overall: Nice easy drinking brew that is pretty balance and tasty for a xmas offering. I will pick up a six pack to enjoy throughout the season."
"The Winter Lager's appearance was a deep, reddish colour with some head on top. The smell had a combination of spices and caramel in the beer. As for the taste, slight hoppiness with the spices converting over successful from the aroma. Light carbination best describes the mouthfeel of this beer. As for the drinkability, a couple of beers in one sitting would be the best approach. I did try this beer with pumpkin bread, and it surprised me how well these two complimented each other."
"Personal taste would probably rate beer a bit lower."
"Overall a good winter offering from Sam Adams. I enjoyed a few of these at a bar while watching a football game with friends and between the 6 of us this is all we drank the whole time, everybody was happy with it."
"Drinkablity is average. Pretty satisfying full taste, but rather rich and heavy for the realtivly low ABV."
"It's 4 A.M. but I could go for another!...I am surprised to say...I liked it and would buy it again...I usually don't go for Sam Adams beer but so far this one has impressed..."
"Got this beer on tap at The Bulldog on Canal St. The appearance was a nice dark color with a thick off white head. The aroma was of toasted malts with hint of hops. The taste was the same as the smell. Great balance of malt and hops. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall drinkability was good. I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable and a nice winter session beer. Very smooth and good flavor. The smell is weak, but it could be my fault for being sick."
"Pours a clear reddish color with a thick head and not much lacing. Smell is somewhat mild with some cinnamon and other spice aroma. Has a strong malt flavor that is balanced by the spices. Medium-bodied and smooth. An easy to drink beer. Overall a pretty decent brew."
"Drinkability: An excellent winter session beer - it's hearty and warming but easy on the palate and remarkably smooth. Recommended and underrated."
"Pours clear copper with a medium sized head. Aroma is sweet and spicy with some herbal hops. Taste is sweet with a lot of caramel at first. Then some bread and spiciness. Finishes with a touch of herbal hops and a lingering spiciness. Nice medium to full bodied mouthfeel. This is quite drinkable and a really solid and good winter seasonal."
"Good body and a great mouthfeel in general. This is the last of the sixpack that I had and I'll be grabbing another soon for the Holidays. Recommended even as a bridge beer for BMC folks."
"This is a fine example of the bock style. It has a prominent malt character, and a certain spiciness that seems to fall right in line with the season. The one possible drawback for me is the somewhat over carbonation. Other than that, this brew is very easy to consume and I would gladly have another."
"Overall, a very nice winter brew that goes down easy that has some holiday-type undertones. Get it while you can."
"The taste is also a little weak. Sweet malt and mild cinnamon. It is easy drinking but rather unspectacular. I keep swirling and sipping the beer hoping something will pop. But now I am at the end of the second bottle and still nothing."
"Average drinkability. Nothing special."
"D- a bit less than what i expected from the boston sam and from a so-called bock, but still flavorful enough to drink in succession without gettin bored."
"Clear reddish copper color with visible carbonation. Half inch head dissipates to thin layer and leaves lacing all the way down. Not a strong aroma. Taste is not overly sweet the malt is nicley balanced with the hops. Sometimes there is a slight taste of pepper. Feels just a bit thin but a very drinkable beer. I've been drinking this regularily since it came out (here) a few weeks ago. I am not at all tired of it."
"picked up their winter sampler today, this was #1 ; pours a clear, med. copper-brown w/ a thin tan head which dissaptes quickly leaving little lacing ; not a strong aroma, a faint caramel/ munich malt smell w/ some nuts and hop in there as well ; a little thin on the flavor as well, for a bock, a malty caramelish flavor, a faint nutty undertone too, a slightly alcoholic finish ; a good med. bodied brew, sweet, yet dry, good carbonation as well ; a drinkable brew, for sure, i could drink this one anytime, even in the summer..."
"One of my favorite bocks, an excellent winter seasonal, good warming effect."
"Poured from the brown glass 12 oz. bottle into my straight sided beer tumbler. A very attractive mahogany color below the ample dark white head. Aromas of bread, raisins and clove. Taste is of very nicely balanced malt and orange peel. A little light on the hop. The recipe varies from year to year and this one is a little on the light side, but not to light for the style. Drinkability is very nice, light and quite sessionable."
"D: Easy to drink and smooth."
"D - Not too spicy, easy to drink."
"Drinkabiliy: easy and does justice to the Winter label."
"A tad thin, but overall a very solid brew."
"Overall, a pretty nice standard for the winter months, waiting for the White Ale to come out. It seems to stick around for too long, however, as does the Summer Ale. Not so much a complaint about the beer, which is solid, so much as SA's seasonal greed. Ba-humbug."
"D- a solid bock, pretty good session beer too"
"I would agree with most of what has been said here about the Winter Lager. The only thing I would ad is that the flavours come out much more once the beer warmed up a little. I would recommend leaving this one out on the counter for about ten minutes before drinking."
"D- Quite drinkable. I could have several of these in a night. It has just the right balance to make it a very easy-drinking lager, but also that extra flavor that makes it sooo much better than a typical macro lager."
"All in all, nother nice SA seasonal offering."
"This is a really good winter beer. It pours a beautiful amber color with a nice thick copper head that sticks to the sides of the glass really well. It has a rich malty aroma with hints of spices that I couldn't really make out in the aroma. The taste brought them out though. It has a really nice rich roasted malty taste with hints of hops and some cinnamon. It has a sweet aftertaste and really good mouthfeel. This is one excellent winter beer. I definately recommend it."
"Drinkability - One of the better Sam Adam's seasonals and a good choice for my first Bock (I've had Doubles, but my first single). Definetly on a Lager kick now and I'm looking forward to more to come, specficially Sam's Double Bock. Definetly starting to see the potential everyone see's in better Lagers and I'm on a quest to find the best."
"Mouthfeel is good for a lager. Drinkablity is high. Cant wait to get a sixer. Overall very nice winter brew, look forward to this one every year."
"A light/clear mahogany color with a thin fuzzy light tan head and good lace. The aroma is clean toffee but very thin, hard to detect the complexities that are to come in the flavor. The taste first announces raisin and nutmeg and more toffee malt. It's a little nutty and mildly carbonated. Fairly thin bodied, not unlike many bocks. Kind of winelike and even a bit grassy at moments. Pretty drinkable none-the-less. Definitely interesting, a fair amount going on and recommended for a taste. Not your average bock."
"One of my favorites from Sam Adams, Winter Lager is a very nice accompaniment to the onset of Winter, a good bock that can go with the season's hearty dinners or with dessert. A terrific amber color, Winter Lager pours a great head--really a beer with a terrific presentation. The taste brings out multiple flavors, with mild citrus, good spices such as ginger and cinnamon, and a strong malty flavor. It finishes well, and is easy to have a few of. An excellent creation from Sam Adams."
"Pours a dark amber color with an off-white head that dissipated into a light cap. The smell is of wine grapes, has some woody characteristics. The taste is of brown bread malt, raisins, sweet with hints of caramel, a bit buttery. I don't pick up much in spiciness. The feel is moderate and very crisp, finishes smooth and balanced, though perhaps a touch on the sweet side. A very easy drinking brew, no off-putting flavors though nothing fantastic."
"Taste is good with moderately high malt impact with mellow toasted grain and mostly clean yeast flavor. Overall a pretty average beer, but is pretty drinkable"
"This said the mouthfeel and caramel notes are enjoyable. Very drinkable winter brew. Typically I look for heartier winter brews, but while not necessarily bad this is just okay."
"Sam Adams Winter Lager is a nice American take on a German bock. The color is a perfect amber with just the right amount of head. The smell is much like a nice double bock from Germany. The taste is full taste with a lingering spiciness which is very nice. The mouthfeel is strong and thick. The drinkibility is great for the winter. Warms you up when you need it!"
"Medium body, you'd probably feel a bit full after a session. But the flavor is habit forming."
"***New note on the following day of trying this...I took the bottle out of the fridge and let it sit a full 15 minutes prior to pouring it. This beer is a good lesson to me in not drinking a beer too cold, especially a bock. The mouthfeel is actually good, the awesome warming taste comes through more, and this is just an all around awesome winter session beer assuming it's served at the right temperature."
"Overall this is an excellent Bock...another work of art from SA"
"D- I was really impressed with this. This is the perfect winter beer to just have around. Didn't blow my socks off, but I am going to keep this around for sure."
"Apart from a hint of orange, I've never picked up any spicing in this beer. Ditto the impact of the wheat in the grist - if I hadn't read it on the label, I'd never have guessed it. All that being said, the end result is a delicious beer that I drink ton of during the winter. 12 oz. bottle - best before April, 2008."
"I was pretty disappointed in this one. I seem to remember this being a lot better the first time I had it a couple years ago. Now it's just bland. I don't really see the point in buying it. I say give it a pass."
"copper colored without any really head from the pour and the little bit that was there disappeared pretty quickly. good taste though; can taste hints of cinnamon and a few other spices within when it first hits the mouth yet it has hints of bitterness mixed with a bit of caramely smoothness at the end but not sharp and on the whole enjoyable. can smell a bit of the spice and even some malt coming through it well. easy to drink and pretty enjoyable on the whole. just wondering why i was able to buy it already seeing that November has just come around but hey not going to complain."
"Pours a brown color with a one finger head. Aroma is light and malty with some spiciness. Very smooth as well. Taste is sweet upfront but then fades into a nice mixture of malt and spice towards the back of the tongue.I even detect caramel as well in the aftertaste.Very drinkable bock that's perfectly for the long winter months."
"Overall this is a drinkable beer with good flavor seasonal appeal but less complexity and boldness than I had hoped for. Good entry beer for people investigating winter brews."
"The bottom line: This beer is nothing overly spectacular, but you can do much worse. The spice tones in this beer are, if anything, understated, so it might be a good beer for people who aren't into the spicier winter warmer style. This isn't bad though, crisp, relatively easy drinking. A winter Oktoberfest if anything."
"D - Despite the somewhat heavy mouthfeel this beer is reasonably drinkable. It finishes quite clean and has just enough carbonation to lift the taste off the palate."
"Drinkability of this winter beer is very good."
"D: A good brew from Sam Adams, would have like more spice character to really bring on a Christmasy/Winter feel. Easy to drink, would buy again, one of the first winter brews I have seen this season, cool looking bottle."
"Overall, a little disappointed here. It's not bad in any way, but it just a little ""pedestrian"". I seem to remember this being a bit better last year. I don't blame Boston Beer though.... I wouldn't want them to take any glory away from Old Fezziwig..."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer by Samuel Adams....one of the best ones I've had"
"the color is beautiful, just a simple, pretty amber. the taste (IMO) is not as rough and bitter as the octoberfest (but i'm only comparing it to bottle). i didn't immediately drink it with food so i didn't have anything to compare the smell against, but the taste and drinkability, for me at least, were spot on. i will order this anytime i find it on tap, that's for sure."
"Pours out nice with a good head and a nice copper color, although it was lighter than expected, since the label says dark lager. Nice head and good lacing. It has a nice scent, very sweet with hints of spices. Goes down smoothly, it would not be hard to drink more than one in a single setting. Excellent taste, a nice blend of malt (very sweet initial taste) and hops (slightly bitter, still slightly sweet) aftertaste. Nice little bit of winter spiciness to add to the taste."
"Overall I think this is my favorite of the Sammy seasonals and a very fine brew from a larger brewer. Well done and I wouldn't be surprised to find this on tap in my house this winter."
"drinkability is great. this is a tasty winter lager that warms the stomach and is not filling. another great offering from the guys at the Boston Beer Company. cheers!"
"poured into a pint galss it had a deep copper color. It left a nice lace on the glass. As for the spices, I did'nt pick up too cinnamon or anything else. I picked up roasted malts and was left with a pleasent doughy flavor. very pleasent beer and nice for the winter months."
"Pours deep amber with generous light tan head that it didnt retain too long. Thin mouthfeel with proper carbonation and very smooth. The ginger and cinnamon used are evident. Definitely very drinkable. I enjoyed it, and I consider myself more of an ale guy than lager guy. Lacing on glass was medium. Not bad."
"not bad..i think that pumpkin spice would get tiresome fairly quickly though"
"Pours a beautiful ruby red with a nice head and good lacing. Unfortunately, the appearance is the best thing about this solid but uninteresting beer. Cherry-ish aroma. Flavor is sourish, somewhat watery cherry spice. Also some notes reminiscent of a watery doppelbock -- for reasons I can't explain, this always reminds me of meat. A decent hoppiness at the end at least does a good job of balancing the fruity notes up front."
"Little head forms on this dark caramel colored beer when poured with little care. The smell contains notes of caramel, soft malts, metal, and spices. Mouthfeel is light and flows well to the back of the tongue. Malty base with almost a fruit aftertaste create the palate. Some tinges of spice and a slight burnt coffee fill in the cracks."
"D- this is a fairly drinkable bock with good cinnamon and spice highlights."
"A rich amber appearance with a nice frothy head. Smell of dark fruits and sweet malt. Taste, I've tried to smell and taste the cinnamon but couldn't, mainly malt and dried fruit. mouthfeel is light to medium that goes down smooth leaving a slight dry bitter aftertaste."
"be. Still, this is a decent, flavorful brew, with a crisp and clean mouthfeel."
"D - One of my favorites from SA. Nice flavor."
"This beer is matched up very well with its season. It's best served in a cold glass in the low 40's F. The head is fairly frothy and the appearance is a dark golden color. The taste is strong and refreshing, with hints of cinnamon or nutmeg. It's one of my favorite winter seasonals."
"This was a beer i tried on recommendation, and spent the rest of winter enjoying. It supposed to have cinnamon. The smell of a bit spicy came through but nothing too powerful. Like most sam adams it had a frothy head. Its suprisingly smooth and flavorful. Its a little above average in abv but still very drinkable. This is not the best beer in the world or even the best winter beer. It is however a top winter seasonal to try and look forward to."
"The taste was well-balanced  and maybe too much so. I wanted a big malty taste but thought some bitter hops came on too strong at the beginning. Some dry roastiness at the end went some way toward redeeming things, and I liked the full-bodied feel."
"A very drinkable beer and a good choice for the cold months. I don't think this beer is something I would make a special effort to find, though."
"Meduim body with a light feel,a good tangyness. Very smooth and drinkable. Could drink a few of these,very enjoyable and easy drinking."
"Pours a dark amber color. I love the smell of this brew, very spicy, warming, and unique. I know they use numerous spices in this brew, but the cinnamon stands out above the rest. Going down, it's rich, thick, and hearty."
"At a random trip to World Market, I came across this guy sitting on a shelf all alone. Sam Adams Winter Brew. I had to give him a home. ""Dark wheat malt liquor brewed with winter spices."""
"An excellent beer by Sam Adams that will warm you up on a cold winters night. It has a nice copper color coming out of the bottle with a small, but adequate, off white colored head. The taste is a nice blend of malt and hops. The mouthfeel is a nice heavy feeling  you know youre drinking a darker beer. It goes down well, but has a little bite at the finish that is typical in most Sam Adams brews. Nothing that would deter you from having another onevery drinkable."
"Overall a very well-defined winter beer. It tastes just like it's described and is a great beer to greet the winter season."
"One of the best surprises of the holiday season, hopefully they will have it again next year."
"I think this tastes more like a vienna lager than a bock but who really gives a shit anyways. This is a pretty decent beer and should be a Godsend to folks without good beer distribution in their area. Another above average but less than amazing brew from Smadams."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. Appears a rich, dark copper color with about a finger of off white head. Smells of spicy dried stone fruits , caramel malts and honey. Tastes of caramelized sugar, bittersweet chocolate and a hint of lemony hops. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Finishes dry and mildly bitter. A nice, approachable beer."
"A drinkable beer, but not outstanding by any standards."
"Poured into pint glass. Had a nice red color, looked appealing. The head was thin and disappeared quickly. Aroma was bitter and hoppy. Tasted of dough with slighty spicy hints. Felt ok in the mouth, not to thick or thin. Fairly easy to drink, flavor and mouthfeel didn't do too much either way. I'm not a fan of hoppy beers, so I definately prefer the some of the other winter seasonals like the Fezziwigs."
"I like it. It is very drinkable, just a nice blend of flavors and a good mouthfeel. I think winter ales are becoming my favorite types of beers."
"DA: This Winter season Lager has a good amount of depth and charechter. I'm on my third one."
"Edit: 2010, & the recipe is fruity & crisp. Easy drinking, but so different that it obviously should have a different listing. Old rating stands."
"D - Very easy to drink. This would be so much better enjoyed in front of a warm fire, rather than here in the airport."
"Drinkability: Much better than the last time I had this (or at least remember. Either this has evolved since last I had this, or my memory has faded (which is not impossible). If next years version is similar I look forward to having it as part of the mix 12 again."
"The mouthfeel is not impressive but fits well with the taste. The drinability is good but could be too hoppy after a couple for me. I think it goes well with food though and could drink several over the course of a good winter dinner."
"mouthfeel is almost creamy with a crisp finish to it. overall i'm impressed."
"This beer is sessionable if you like them sweet."
"Poured into my slender cylinder glass, this bock is a brownish amber color with a slight white head that leaves a nice little lacing. It is tough to discern much from the nose. Slight hop presence. Taste is warm and malty with a bit of spice at the finish. A bit light in the mouth and not too complex, but easy drinking. Not bad when you need to pound a few in the winter."
"This is one, IMO - that tastes better on a nice tap than on a bottle. It's not a great winter, but good one and a good selection for a wintery brew on tap that is easy to drink, esp. for style."
"Moderately carbonated, and very smooth. Warm enough for sitting out on the patio on a 30 degree January night in California, but light enough to make a fairly decent session brew. As with most Sam Adams seasonals, I'd have to say it's nothing spectacular, but probably one of the better draft beers at most bars."
"Suffers a little due to the in my estimation, Sam Adams' undoing, of a slightly stale aura. Sometimes quality control can't control production. Not much in its sprit, a bit dull at times."
"Not a bad Bock, but Boston Beer Co. didn't take a lot of chances in terms of flavor in this rendition. This offering seems rather static and subtle compared to its German counterparts."
"Pours a pale amber with a cream colored head that holds like cappucino foam in this pint glass...a surprise. Aroma is very Sam, hops are sweet with the aroma of unconverted caramel malt sugars, and that familiar aroma of a wheat-tinged doppelbock, but cleaner, less earthy and less intense than a doppel all around. This is my first plain old ""bock"" so doppels are what I'm comparing it to. Taste is again very Sam, but with a sweeter husky backbone than the standard Boston lager. Im drinking this too cold (my buddy had this in the fridge unlike the cellar temps I ususally drink at) for a fair comparisons, and it needs to warm up. Once it does, the wheat is more detectable, and it makes this a bit more rounded ain unique, though its not light years away in taste from other sam beers. Mouthfeel is medium, nothing startling here. On part and satisfactory. Overall its better than most beers I take a chance on, but not one I'll be crazy about buying, though one I'd pick over others in a generic tap list. Of note, there was a twelver of this at a small mixed gathering I went to, and I found many of the bottles left on the table half empty or nearly full, meaning many of the non-craft drinkers tried it and left it on the table, sadly. This makes my heart both sad and glad, as to a craft drinker some Sam brew can seem almost macro, until you put it next to the thirty pack of coors light at a celebration and realize, it really isn't even close to being tasteless, non-threatening swill."
"Poured a nice deep amber color with a decent beige head that left good lacing. Aromas were very thin and a hint of skunkiness, but not bad. Taste was pretty good, a little hops up front and a nice malty finish. Not much in the spice department as the label suggests, but whatever. Not sure this is a bock, but again, whatever. A decent lager worth trying, but not a standout by any means."
"D: I find this lager to be more drinkable than the plain Sam Adams Boston Lager. Has more body and taste to it and I really like it although for a winter brew I guess I was expecting more of a seasonal taste; spices etc."
"Prost!"
"I dont know about ""bock," but this is still a nice beer. It's smooth and creamy from the wheat, with sweet, almost spicey, barley malt flavors. I was a little surprised when I found out this was a wheat beer, as there isn't much wheat flavor apparent. A little bland in the flavor department, but its a solid offering and worth a try."
"Drinkability is pretty good, the beer isn't really tasty enough to have a lot of, this is a safe beer for someone wanting to try craft beer without diving headfirst into the style. A decent offering from Sam Adams, but nowhere near my favorite bock."
"D - Not bad. Wouldn't mind having more but not particularly exciting."
"It smells more malty with a hint (maybe) of some kind of spice but I'm not sure. When I took a sip I knew it was a Sam Adams because it had the traditional Sam Adams Boston Lager taste to it (not sure if that makes sense). I was looking for more spiciness from this beer since it was a winter brew but I was surprised to find that it didn't have a huge spice profile. It was more on the malty side and I thought the body was a touch heavy. For a winter lager I found it to be a tasty beer. Nothing outstanding but tasty."
"This beer is pretty hard to distinguish from the flagship Boston Lager. The only difference I can see is that the head tends to be smaller and dissipate faster. That means the color is a nice healthy shade of copper. The smell is and dominated by the malts with the hops relatively subdued in the background. As is usually the case, the smell was indicative of the taste which was dominated by the malts with the hops more in the background. The malt character is similar to the regular Boston Lager. The taste is strong, fairly sweet, complex, but still very clean. The main difference I noticed is that the hops are more sublte. They are there and provide a nice balance, but there's less of that dry intrusive hoppy bitterness as compared to the non-seasonal Boston Lager. All in all this was an excellent beer and the subtler hops make this an easy choice for a session beer. Watch out for that increased alcohol content though."
"This beer poured a pretty clear copper color. It doesnt have much head or lacing. The smell is sweet and caramel tones are noticeable. The taste is sweet with the malt and cereal tastes pronounced. The mouthfeel is full bodied, but not heavy. This beer is very smooth and Id consider it one that is highly drinkable  knocking back a few of these wouldnt be a problem at all."
"Still, this beer was easy to drink and clearly a beer for the masses, versus those looking for more ""challenging beers."" Nonetheless, it was enjoyable for a pretty middle-of-the-road product."
"I am definitely liking this seasonal beer from sam adams!"
"Poured at 40 degrees into a pint glass. I have had these before, so no surprises this year. It's a rich, dark lager. It is fairly light compared to other winter beers. Not especially high in alcohol (5.8%) and not overly malty. There are some wintery spicey noted in the background. Perhaps a little citrusy? It's probably the mildest winter beer you will ever encounter. It's OK, but the sweetness gets a little tiring after you've put back one or two. I would prefer a heavy winter ale or a crisp golden lager, this hybrid style is not a favorite."
"Drinkability is through the roof. Eminently drinkable....I could have several with great ease. All in all, the very consistent Brewer/Patriot does it again."
"Nice to sit and sip at the bar, kitchen table, next to a fire, just about anywhere. Comforting for the winter."
"Nice amber full bodied lager.. a bock, not sure if it's that style but fairly close. Malty,toasty nose excellent Belgian lace. Sweet in the start and balanced in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel, pure pleasure hard to fault this beer. Not overwhelming alcohol, so also highly drinkable."
"Went to one of those holiday parties yesterday where you pretty much have to drink what is offered. Fortunately, the host is a BA (by definition though not by membership) and I knew he'd do something well in the beer dept. I was not disappointed. He handed me a Sam Adams Winter Lager and I knew it would be a great party. The label mentions spices, but if present, they were in the background in a supporting role because the smell and taste said malt first with touch of hops for balance. Yes, a little sweet, but not too sweet and ultimately very drinkable. Most of all, rich caramel malt taste with just the right carbonation to be extremely refreshing on a cold winter evening. Another Sam Adams success story."
"Very light and watery, with a slightly thick, sweet aftertaste. Pungent. Far too sweet to drink a lot of. Needs a more bitter counterbalance."
"Body is very light which makes for an easy winter beer to have in a session."
"d-not bad for my first time having it.goes well with nachos and onion peels.very well balanced but i dont know if i would call it a winter beer.i would have again."
"Not bad. Certainly gettable, especially when your options are lacking in great beery awesomeness."
"My main issue with this beer was that it just never went anywhere. Not a bad beer, but not enough noticeable qualities to be good either. It was just...there."
"Had this beer on-tap at the Friendly Stop in Glendale, OH (Cincinnati suburb.) Adam and the gang serve up a decent beer with a great dark color, wonderful aroma, and a drinkability I have grown to expect from ole Sammy A. The head retention was a dissapointment. It seemed to go flat almost immediately after being drawn from the tap. Overall, a OK beer that went great with ""Adam's Garlic Burger."""
"Drinkability-- easily in quanity or with a meal."
"Overall, a very nice, unique, and enjoyable winter offering from Sam Adams. I get this often when it's available, since it's definitely worth it."
"D:Overall this beer is okay, if a little boring. I was expecting a little more spicyness or wheat character, but it's not bad by any measure."
"Pours a dark rich brown with a frothy white head. Smells a bit like cinnimon with a hint of citrus, very malty with little hop presence. The taste is rich and deep, very malty and some sweetness. Reminds me of the Octoberfest with more spice and less sweet. Aftertaste is clean and crisp with the malt drawn out. A good mouthfeel, pretty smooth and easy to drink. A good winter offering and another beer that didn't disappoint from Sam Adams. Cheers!"
"I have had this many times over the years, but just now getting to review it. 5.8 % ABV, enjoy before April. Dark reddish/copper in color. Thick off-white fluffy head holds together well. Nose is full of toffee, spices, cinnamon, and a bit of a grainy aroma. Hints of fruit as well. Flavors are furity, apple, banana, caramel, with a hint of floral, earthy hops. Very well balanced, as neither the malt, spices, or hops seems to want to take over. A bit thin and overcarbonated. Overall, and enjoyable winter warmer, that is very easy to drink, like many other Sam Adams brews."
"Drinkability--a good, easily drinkable winter beer."
""
"This beer poured a copper color with a small/medium head. The smell had aromas of malt, caramel, hops, and a little spice. The taste had a full body of malt taste with a caramel sweetness to it. The hop flavor was also medium and well-balanced. I also detected a bit of cinnamon flavor as well. The mouthfeel was light/medium with a medium carbonation. The drinkability was above average, but since it was a little bit sweeter than I prefer, I can't see myself drinking too many of them. Nonetheless, this was a smooth lager brewed with great care and was very enjoyable as a seasonal. I would definately reccommend it if it's in stock."
"Overall: Cant believe that I missed the opportunity to Review this to date as this is one of my favorite Seasonal Brews from Sam Adams. It is always a pleasure to sink a couple more of these once I get cracked into my annual SA Winter Classics Pack. Id have no problems splashing Benjamins on a Six-Pack for this one, at any time of the year. Recommended."
"Poured a very light copper to tan in appearance. Clear with a off white head that is somewhat thin with some moderate lacing down the sides of the glass. No spices are apparent, a very light hop smell. No bitterness, a very pleasent mouthfell to it, goes down very smooth and very satisfying. Moderate in carbonation and very bubbly. Overall a very good seasonal beer. This is one that i will buy when it comes out yearly."
"Drinkable: yeah it is"
"Pours a nice amber color with a tan head. Mild malty aroma, without a hint of the spices it contains. Sweet flavor, with some hints of cinnamon, but predominantly this is a malt beer.. Extremely easy drinking, just the right amount of carbonation. One of the best seasonals that Sam Adams offers."
"Promising dark, bitter aroma. Deep, dark copper color with a head of gentle fizz that hangs around for awhile. Rich; smokey, almost burnt taste with some mild spices and an alcoholic character of which I'm not overly fond. Fine beer, but not super. Never really delivers anything extra special or complex after the initial sniff. I'd definitely choose a Winter Ale over this; in particular, I'm thinking of the Summit Winter Ale."
"Very refreshing and slightly sweet taste, a quite enjoyable balance of spices and hops. I myself an a Guiness man and usually don't venture into the realm of ligher beers and ales, but this beer was a very common ground between the dark stouts I'm used to and the lighter type beers (think the Millers and Dud's of the world) except with much more flavor and body. Definetly recommend."
"Upon pouring into my pint glass, I immediately took notice of its bold, copper coloring. Unfortunately, the smell was not as strong as its appearance would lead you to believe but you could still make out the sweet aroma of malt and spices. However, the flavor was what you come to expect from Sam Adams and I was not disappointed. The beer was sweet tasting, balanced and smooth from start to finish. I especially enjoyed how it coated the glass with each sip. Overall, looking forward to having it again as the winter creeps in."
"I'm a fan of this winter brew, even though it's not all that complex. There is a rich caramel malt character up front, balanced by a nice bitter hop finish. The spices don't really come through too strongly, although there are hints of nutmeg and cloves. Mouthfeel is fizzy, and a bit sticky. A very sessionable winter brew that goes very well with food."
"Clear, rich coppery colour. The pour produced little head, which left little lacing on the glass. Plain aroma with some malt and caramel. Low bitterness, again with some crackery malt and caramel sweetness. Mild spices kicked in towards the end. The body seemed heavier than it was due to a slight syrupy character that appeared after a few sips. Carbonation was a little on the higher side and it was a bit dry. A fairly average beer, nothing really wrong, quaffable."
"Eric"
"Drinkability: good; i wish i had another in my fridge for later"
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper color with a good sized white head. Lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma isn't strong at all, but what I can smell is some sweet malt, spices and a bit of hops. It tastes like spices (cinnamon, nutmeg), caramel and malt, with a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. The drinkability is OK. Overall the beer is good. I'd drink it again, it's a decent seasonal beer."
"From the Sam Adams Winter Classics pack: Pours a nice copper color with a smallish head. Appears to be pretty full bodied for a lager. Smell is awfully mild I thought there would be more spice to it, oh well. Taste is pretty typical for a Sam Adams. This one is heavy on the malts, nice and sweet with just a touch of spice. Mouthfeel is slightly heavier than the average SA brew. Overall a fine brew to take to the in-laws on a boring winters night."
"OK, but not the best warmer out there by a long shot. Easy to drink, but a little bland."
"An incredible offering from Boston Brewing Company. This beer is definitely on the upper echelon of their beers, and one to keep an eye out for each coming winter."
"This is one hell of a beer. Easy to drink and a definete must when it gets cold outside."
"Drinkability: Like all of Sam Adams brews, this one if a good quality beer that is always a safe bet. Nothing too spectacular here, but nice and refreshing."
"This is a decent bock with some spiciness. Overall, it's closer to a German-style 'winter' or 'Christmas' bier than an English style that typically highlight the spices more. With the exception of the spices, it reminds me of the bock biers that I had when I visited the Austrian Alpine area last January."
"A good brew that tastes strong. This is a good beer that could be an every day beverage if not for that fact that it is seasonal."
"12oz. bottle, with a freshness date of Apr. 2007. Poured into a pint glass, the beer is a dark copper, almost brown shade. 1/4 inch head that quickly faded, leaving slight lacing on the glass. The aroma is weak, mainly the spices being detectable. The mouthfeel is just right for a lager. The taste to me, is like a weaker version of Sam Adams Old Fezziwig Ale. The spices arent as strong, and the beer not as thick, but still very enjoyable. Easily a session beer, and worth sharing with family and friends on the cold winter evenings."
"This winter warmer poured dark amber with a copper head and generous lacing throughout. Th aromas were not impressive- somewhat sour malt with some spice. The taste saved the brew as the slight citrus peel and cinnamon flavors balanced well with the toasted malts and became refreshing. Good carbonation, no real hint of alcohol. A more distinct flavor combination would help, but the mild flavors add to its drinkability."
"This is a nice wheat lager. The rich body and spiceienss is a nice surprise. My only complaint is the balance, and how the beer finished. Took off for drinkability points accordingly."
"This beer is a staple of mine in the winter time. It is highly drinkable with a good warming feeling. It is a good beer in the winter evenings. It is a dark lager that has a seasonal flavor. I buy this beer in the Sam Adams winter pack. I would recommend this beer to all my friends"
"I found the aroma to be acceptable, the first taste lended a spice which pleased me. The taste after a few sips degraded to your average winter brew. I enjoyed this brew as I do every year, but I feel it's a once a year experience. Not worthy of stocking."
"D: This one was Okay, a good experience, but nothing that stood out to me as exemplery. I will drink this one again if it comes across my table, but is not something I would stock up on if available."
"pours one finger head with some lacing and copper color. smell was slightly fruity and spice. taste reminded me of devils food cake or spice cake, clean finish with no after taste. mouthfeel is light nice carbonation which adds to the spice taste. nice enjoyable beer."
"This is just the type of beer you need for winter. It goes right along with any food youll have begining wiht turkey at Thanksgiving and everything else down the line. The beer appears as a dark amber almost brown color. It reminds me of the ocktoberfest style except its alot more bitter. I can only have two of these without feeling full but like i said before its a great beer for the winter months."
"Drinkability - This beer I would rank much higher than the Harpoon Winter Warmer. This is how a balanced warmer should be. They very much got this recipe correctly balanced. I would recommend this brew over any other Winter Warmer-class beer that is commonly available."
"Decent beer, good overall. Looks good in the glass and goes down smooth. No overiding taste or smell however. I'd drink it again"
"Poured a darker reddish amber , with a smaller offwhite head. The aroma is of slightly caramelish , roasted malt , some spices and cinnamon , light bit of hop as well. The taste starts off with a pleasant gingerbread maltiness , some slight reddish fruit , some toasted character , hint of nutmeg , caramel , more spice and cinnamon in the end. The mouthfeel is average to slightly creamed from a decent carbonation. I love to grab a few of these every winter season. They have a very nice flavor , a decent kick , with some holiday feel from the spice , nutmeg and cinnamon. A must try if your into seasonal brews."
"Not so remarkable that I'd make this the focus of a tasting, but easily sessionable, and well balanced for a winter seasonal. I'm always happy to see the blue bottles on the shelves and have many fond memories with this beer."
"Poured this one out of a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, best before April. The color is dark brown with red tints, this beer is very clear. It poured with a one finger head which had poor retention. The smell was a little bit of malt, cinammon and maybe some alcohol. The taste has notes of bread and cinnamon with other spices hop bitterness is also noticable. The body is very light with fairly high carbonation maybe too light for my taste I like a fuller bodied winter warmer. Because of the light body and mellow taste profile this is pretty drinkable it isn't great but it is a pretty solid beer."
"D - It was pretty good. I liked the hint of cinnamon. It was understated."
"Orange body with a small white head. Very malty with a small hint of hops in the back. A bit citrusy. Easy drinking with not a lot of alcohol warming at all. Not a real winter warmer in that respect. It is fairly drinkable, but not teriffic flavor overall. I would not go out of my way to have it in the future."
"Matt"
"Overall a very drinkable winter brew. Although I found it a bit odd for the folks at Sam Adams to use a lager for a winter beer, I am more used to an Ale for a winter beer. Still I would recommend it."
"Another excellent selection in the Winter Classics sampler and one that's also widely available on tap. A great choice in an establishment that doesn't offer much in the way of craft brews."
"Overall a very tatsy and highly drinkable winter brew. A standard."
"Though pleasantly carbonated, all in all I found this variety to be a little thin. The flavor is lacking  it gets real close to being average, but somehow misses the mark for me."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-n"
"Nice clean lager mouthfeel. Very crisp. Color is a nice brown. Can certainly taste a crystal malt and maybe a handful of chocolate malt too. Nice aroma, quite festive...not a everyday beer. What spices here,maybe nutmeg and allspice. Well hopped as well. There is a good bit of bitterness in this beer. Overall, decent flavor, seasonally spiced, and clean bready flavor."
"Pours a deep amber/hazel with a thin head that fizzles out into nothing. Smell really makes me a little sick to my stomach. Big bunch of ginger, spice, berries, and sweentess. That same awful sickening character in the aroma show up in the flavor, but then it takes a backseat to some roasted and toasted malts and some pleasant ginger and spice tones. Mouthfeel is moderate body with moderate carbonation. I just think this is gross, and it's a chore to finish this."
"Samuel Adams Winter Lager was a clear dark amber color with an off-white head. The head had decent retention with some lacing. The aroma was malty with a touch of spices. The taste was malty as well and a little toasty with some spices and hops. It was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. It's a nice winter seasonal."
"Sam Adams Winter Lager poured to a vibrant reddish copper liquid with a thin head from decent carbonation. Some lacing. Cinnamon malt smell, maybe some smokey caramel. I taste malt, cinnamon, and well done pie crust. Kind of thick in the mouth and a bit oily. I find this to be a somewhat drinkable beer, one of my favorites from Sam Adams."
"Overall- Not a mindblowingly spicy winter beer here but a surprisingly tasty beer. Not bad!"
"I don't care much for this beer. It's just not for me. It looks alright--starts out with a nice head and a good caramel color. Smells--well, I can't really put my finger on it. Same thing for the taste. I've had a couple of these now over a couple of different nights to get a feel for it and I still don't like it. ""Dark wheat lager brewed with winter spices."" Okay. It just seems muddled and I can't get anything out of it and I don't think it's very tasty. Makes me not want to finish the glass. Oh well. I still love Sammy Adams, and we'll try again next year. (I liked Anheuser-Busch's Winter Warmer better. Yikes!)"
"For me, this beer is a given every year, especially considering its easy availability (usually appears in my local Kroger around the beginning of November). It's a dependable stalwart in a crowded marketplace of winter seasonals."
"I like this one. I feel that SA so far has hit the mark on the two seasonals I've sampled in their winter mix pack."
"Pours a nice garnet color with an two finger slightly off-white head that settles to just a coating. Nice aroma with caramel malts and some spices, possibly cinnamon, definitely ginger. Taste is similar to the smell with sweet caramel malts dominant and some spiceness in the background. Nice mouthfeel. Good body, which is a bit thicker than other lagers but still nice and relatively low carbonation. Great drinkability. Low ABV, great taste from the caramel malts and spices, and great drinkability make this very sessionable."
"Perhaps a bit timid on all fronts, this is kind of a Bock with training wheels. Despite its overall lightness and somewhat grainy texture and taste, the beer is remarkably refreshing and drinkable."
"Drank very easy, much tastier than last year"
"The winter lager is a nice changeup from the heavily spiced pumpkin et al beers of fall. The flavor begins with the cinnamon note with actually effects the mouthfeel, giving a textured and warm feeling. However, the flavor quickly transitions to a nice lagery flavor supported but just a hint of hops. The beer is remarkably drinkable for a spiced beer, and does less damage to the palate than expected. The winter lager is a great way to transition from fall to winter."
"This is a very smooth and drinkable lager with enough body and malted flavor to enjoy throughout the winter. This is reminiscent of one of the first darker beers I ever tried: Coors Winterfest but with better balanced flavor and a smoother mouthfeel and finish. I hate to see their Octoberfest go, but the winter lager is a nice replacement. A nice seasonal offering from Boston Beer Co."
"This beer poured a deep copper/auburn color. It honestly appeared purplish in a way. It didn't have much head at all, with very little lacing. This beer smells of nuts and floral type tones. It tastes a bit spicy and has quite a bit of carbonation on the tongue, which surprised me w/ the lack of head to it. It's not a great beer, but definitely worth checking out. However, if you are interested in a seasonal, the Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is killing this one."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with an April '07 best-by date, although the marking is very faint. I had to check all 6 bottles in the pack to confirm the date. Pours a lovely copper color with a small white head. Good retention on it. Smells mostly of sweet, dark barley. Nice toasty, bready smell. Tastes much of the same. Good, clean taste - warm and refreshing. The toasted barley blooms in the mouth. Good creaminess for a lager - not too thick, but not at all watery. Overall, my favorite Sam Adams' offering. An excellent winter brew: warm and freshing, perfect for sipping."
"D: I've like this beer much more in the past. Do they change their recipe every year? Seems thin and flavorless compared to past years"
"Alright...I haven't reviewed for a few months...so here goes. Pours a dark copper color with moderate head and some lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). The scent is not very strong, has a sweet aroma. Has a fairly malty taste, with a clean finish. Has a thicker mouthfeel to it. A decent beer, but nothing all that impressive. Worth trying over the holiday season."
"This is one fine brew, I could down a few of these in one sitting easy."
"Very enjoyable brew all around. I wish it was a little beefier, but overall its not a bad rendition of a mellow lagered weizenbock."
"This is poured into a 22 oz Hefe weizen glass. Nice deep copper hue and a large foamy head. The head dissipates slowly, but never completely goes away. The aroma is only slight; there seems to be a hint of toasted malt, a touch of spices I can't place (nutmeg), and sugary molasses. The taste is malt dominated! There is the cinammon, the malt, and the malt. Very little hop presence. The body is a little thin. I would say that since I finished the 6 pack in two nights it's a very drinkable brew. A nice seasonal that I would say one should try."
"Drinkability: Decent, but not exceptional."
"Mouth: Strong mouth feel is the first noticeable attribute, heavily carbonated. Apple pie notes in the flavor, cinnamon plus tart flavors along the sides of the tongue. A dry finish leaves the back of the mouth asking ""when's it my turn??"" More character comes out as it warms - the presence of nutmeg makes itself known, but unfortunately as the temperature increases the sweetness up front increases but the back of the mouth gets filled with some grungy flavor that I don't like."
"Very drinkable Beer, perfect thing as we slip into Winter."
"Altogether this brew is malty, sweet and warming. If only it were colder out. Damn these Indian summers."
"Pours a dark brownish copper color with a fizzy tan head that quickly dissapears. Smell is sweet and malty with some winter spices, alcohol and a wierd metallic twang in the aroma as well. Semi-thick and slightly chewy mouthfeel make way for a nice malty base with some holiday spices. Overall, this is a decent brew but nothing to get excited about."
"Deep amber color with a sticky tan head for some good lacing action. The nose offers some unexpected notes such as celery, pure honey, and malt characters. The taste is a mellow blend of smooth roasted malts, toffee, and ginger cookies in the background and finish. Later tastes reveal some wheat crackers, orange peel, and something similar to pumpkin. Medium body and a terrific mouthfeel that is smooth up front, creamy in the middle, and a pop of fizz at the end. A very nice winter warmer without being too pretentious."
"Delicious and delicate, with intriguing subtleties, this is definitely the most impressive beer I've had from Samuel Adams' very long list of offerings."
"D: Easy beer to session, but not really that enjoyable for me. I normally like this beer more, but it seems really weak this time."
"M&D - a nice flavor, warm for a winters night, a very nice offering from Sam Adams, with a higher-ish drinkability"
"D: A very drinkable beer, the low alcohol and easy taste/mouthfeel contribute to it, while the carmel malts and spices/hops give it a nice taste to go down also."
"Overall, I wish I had a more extensive vocabulary. There's a lot of great tastes and aromas happening here, and most importantly its balanced beatifully."
"A dark copper pour with a decent-sized head. Smells strongly of cinnamon and spices with lots of malt characteristics. Has a taste and body of an Oktoberfest with strong malts, but heavier in the spices. A complex, warming mouthfeel allowing the spices to be noticed. Quite drinkable."
"Slightly complex, with no overpowering flavors. A good choice for the winter. Recommended."
"A tasty and drinkable beer, Sam Adams makes another winner."
"d - i had four of these in a row during a football game and enjoyed every one. solid brew. i'll go back again for this one."
"Clear dark copper body with thin offwhite head. Light scent, dominated by spice. Malty, somewhat roasty, with spice notes... Seems similar to an ESB in some ways. Flavor isn't quite as strong as I'd anticipated, but still a pretty flavorful tasty beer with a medium body."
"Pours a dark amber color with a decent white head and some decent lacing. Smell is of sweet malt, carmel, alcohol, and a little spice. Taste is a little sweet initially combined with some spice, and a little hops at the end. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkablility is decent."
"Drinkability is good, this goes down easy."
"This review is for the 2006 release. Pours a garnet color with a fluffy head. Aroma is malty, caramel with toffee overtones. Taste is malty, a bit too sweet for my taste. I find this beer to be a little dull and unexciting - kind of one dimensional. After one, I've had enough and find it's time to move on. It's obviously a well crafted beer, I think it could use a bit more hoppiness to balance out the huge malt profile."
"A nice brew. Very drinkable, and complex enough to keep things interesting."
"D- It was okay but probably not again for me."
"If they haven't got one already, the Boston Beer Co really should be presented with some sort of lifetime achievement award."
"Notes: I liked this offering. It's not an eye opening experience. More along the lines of a solid representation, nothing offensive, well made and highly drinkable. Well done."
"Slainte!"
"When in the mood for a lager I would definitely go for this one when available."
"Pours a darker shade of copper with a light tan head, leaving some lacing on the glass. Aroma is carmel like malts and spices. Nice malty flavor with evident spices. I wish the flavor was a little more assertive, but its good. Drinkability is high, this is one of my favorite Sam Adam's seasonals."
"I enjoyed it last year, enjoyed it in the sampler pack this year and am looking forward to buying a couple of six packs when I get the chance. Definitely one of the best winter beers I can buy around here, highly recommended."
"I am going to be consuming a lot of these during this winter, its only October."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- This beer's rolling and slick carbonation is certainly enjoyable, and it further punctuates the nice balance of all ingredients. This is an easy, drinkable, relatively light winter warmer... not the nightcap that finishes off a backbreaking day shoveling snow out of your driveway."
"Sam Adams consistently puts out good stuff and this seasonal is no exception. Pours an amber orange with a thick head and minimal lacing. Smells reminiscent of trappists brews. Dried fruits hops and spice. Minimal alcohol hint. Taste is smooth with a flavorful burst. Not watered down. This lager is highly drinkable as a sipper or as a weekend warriors' ale."
"Amber color- tan head  malt, nutmeg, salt nose- malt, chocolate, prunes, orange taste- medium body- aftertaste malty Amber color- tan head  malt, nutmeg, salt nose- malt, chocolate, prunes, orange taste- medium body- aftertaste malty Amber color- tan head  malt, nutmeg, salt nose- malt, chocolate, prunes, orange taste- medium body- aftertaste malty"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is amber/red. A decent head that lingers for just a few minutes. The smell is spicy with a distinct toasty bread aroma. The taste is pleasant and never overpowering when you consider this beer does have spices in it. Mouthfeel is about average. Certainly does not detract from the overall experince of this beer. Drinkability is above average as this is one brew I could drink year round. When it re-appears this winter, I plan on stocking up!"
"Appearance is a red-amber color with a nice head. Has an interesting spicy and almost yeasty aroma. Taste is malty with some wheat flavor and some nutmeg, I believe. Mouthfeel is average and clean feeling. A nice, drinkable beer that is a bit light feeling for winter, I think, but nicely spiced for the time."
"Drinkability- Nice but not my favorite seasonal; that would be Great Lakes Christmas Ale."
"Prost! MK"
"Darn tasty, but I only want a glass or two. Really delicious with a couple of squares of a Cadbury Fruit and Nut bar."
"Adam"
"This one has been available in Alberta for a while, but I have always forgot to review it on here. Blue labelled 300ml bottle, with a bit on the back telling about the ""Saigon Cinnamon"" used in brewing this winter beer. The beer's colour is a lovely ruby/off purple colour that shimmers a hazy nectarine hue. The head is solid and billowy, slightly dimpled with good staying power. It stayed at perfect level, just topping the glass. The foam is a dirty dull white, hints of light red and brown throughout. Thick islands of lace. A great looking spiced beer, perfect for the dinner table in winter. The aroma is subtle and warming, with the promised cinnamon aroma and a light but grainy malt that is sweet but balanced with a little citrus hopping. There is some tangy lime or apricot in the smell, adding a little salinity. The tangy fruits actually become more pronounced the farther you go with this beer's aroma, and I found it a little odd. It just feels as though it should not be there next to the cinnamon and dark malts. However, besides that the aroma is very nice, with the likes of maple syrup, brown sugar, buttered bread, a little black licorice, and other anonymous spices. Inhaling in close with the nose very near there are some very sugary candy notes as well. All of this with no off-putting strongness or alcohol astringency; this is a very subtle but appetising aroma. Warm, soft, almost relaxing. The taste is medicinal and full of cinnamon and brown bread malts. There is some clove and and other spices that seem to remind me of my grandmother's kitchen. Cumin, caraway. Definite licorice and horehound here. The malts are nicely combined with the volume to give a light barleywine flavour as well. The taste is woody and vinous, with a full body and low, creamy carbonation. Drinkability is high, and this goes down easily in both winter and summer. A nice little dark lager. Fulfilling and easy to drink."
"CRUX: PERFECT WINTER SNOW SHOVELING REFRESHER. Paired quite nicely with chicken and zucchini in a spicy (cinnimon, clove,) tagine sauce. Winter beer/ hot morrocan? My, my, How sophisticated!"
"Tall sandy coloured tight spongy head on the pour that settles to a thin cap. Clear deep dark amber/chestnut tone, a more vibrant old copper/garnet when held to direct light. Sweet caramel malt and cinnamon aroma up front, with some nutmeg and light hops in the background. Sweet, sweet caramel malt flavour--almost to the point of be cloyingly sweet, but not quite--blends well with that Saigon cinnamon they mention on the back label, it's what also jumps to the forefront at first. Then comes some banana flavour, nutmeg, clove and some ginger, rounded out nicely with some light spicy hops. And the mouthfeel is gorgeous: full, rich and velvety smooth for any style of lager, it hugs you from the inside. It's a month before it's best before date still, and I'm fully enjoying this winter warmer on a hot sunny day in April. Good stuff, glad I happened across it at the last minute. Hope we get some more of this in next year."
"Opinion: Well, this isn't too bad of a beer. It is quite sweet and a bit one sided for my opinion. I would prefer a bit more of a dry contribution form the grain bill to balance the caramel. As it is, the sweet caramel and roast run the show, and there is a bit of floral hops thrown in to obscure the mix. It is an all right beer, but I will be looking to see what is next to it in the cooler next time."
"Samuel Adams Winter Lager pours a very nice copper color with a fluffy off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I like the aroma, it has a bit of citrus in it. Taste is nicely balanced, hoppy and a little citrusy. Pretty darn good for a lager, nice and flavorful. Well worth a try."
"D - OK drinkability. Becomes a little overly sweet towards the end. A decent Sam Adams beer."
"Sam Winter is a decently-priced seasonal choice. It's enjoyable but not particularly memorable."
"Ive liked all of the beers that Ive had from Boston Beer Co. so far. However Im not quite as impressed with this beer as I have been with their others. It seems more like a hybrid of their Boston Lager and their Old Fezziwig Ale with a bit more sweetness."
"I could put away a few of these and not get bored with the taste or bloated."
"Notes: not bad. Its a little on the bland side. The aroma is good and the flavor upfront is good also, but it just fades too fast in the finish."
"Second bottle of this reinforces what I thought on the first. It's not exceptionally smooth. It's not entirely rough, but it doesn't have smooth edges, as they say. A slight hoppy bitterness on the mid-late body gives it an interesting delivery on the spices. I'm not refined enough to say what those spices are - suffice it to say that they're patently winter-esque without being overly so, like this year's Anchor winter offering was. Some taste maltiness in this, which I get mostly in the finish. Again, a decent beer. Worth a try."
"Worth having, this is a beer I wouldn't mind revisiting whenever it becomes available."
"Drinkability  A very good starter winter warmer. Incredibly drinkable. The score might not reflect it but I really enjoy this beer. Im sure I will pick up another sixer next year."
"I have to admit I'm not a lager fan, but this one is alright. It's heavier than most lagers, and the added flavors from the spices keep me drinking it. I don't think it's much of a session beer, but it sure hits the spot on a cold day like today. I'm looking forward to drinking it again next winter."
"The beer feels like a lager would feel in heavyness, but again the spice was just too much. If you like the spice I say go for it, but to me I could never drink more than one in a sitting."
"Smelled like a fruit cake made with plenty of citrus fruit to give it that tropical Christmas feel. Orangey ,marmalady aroma dominates, but there are plenty of malty and spicy notes beneath that. Taste is sweet caramel malts, citrus, yeast and spice. Definitely gets you in the holiday spirit, but it gets a little too off base for the style."
"A slim creamy head graces the top of this deep, clear, amber brew. Lots of streaming carbonation present throughout. The smell is faint, however, just the aroma of bready malt and mild spice. The first thing I notice in the taste is the cinnamon spice. The malt is caramelly and bread-like, but not real strong in flavor. It tastes very clean like a lager should be, and its well carbonated. Very smooth, and medium thick, it coats well and goes down pretty easy. Not overly strong in flavor or alcohol, this winter warmer is drinkable and enjoyable..."
"For a style I typically don't choose due to the tendency of brewers to overspice, I'm impressed with this interpretation. Nice complexity without over or under doing the spices. Good malt balance and relatively easy to drink."
"D: A definition session beer. Not something like a Chimay Blue Label which one would savor every drop; instead, this is a great beer you can share with friends, both beer advocates and illiterates alike."
"I had this at a pub in Northampton, MA. I immediately loved the color, beautifully dark and full. It smelled great, cinnamon, maybe a little bit of nutmeg. The head was a medium size and went down after a minute or so. It didn't taste too carbonated. It went down smooth and tasted quite good. I'd drink this again in a heartbeat."
"Clear bronze color. Beautiful head leaves sheets of lace behind.. The smell is toffee malts, caramel, and a hint of hops. The taste is big-time caramel malts resting on a medium body. Drinkability is superb, and it was nice to try this on-tap after Groundhog Day. You can't go wrong with this one..another good offering from Boston Beer Co."
"beer is very easy to drink. deffently fit the cold weather."
"During the time that it's available, this is a great default beer to keep on hand."
"Part of a great winter pack, this winter warmer has a deep reddish copper color with an inch thick head, and has lovely spotty and streaky lacings. The smell is of toasted malt, caramel, I almost want to say a little orange in there, which I found odd. Taste is quite nice, carameled malts on the forefront with spices of cinnamon and orange peel and the hops kick in for a smooth but tingly ride down the throat and eases into a warm feeling through the torso. And I had to raid the spice cabinet to be sure, but I think I'm picking up something like corriander. Body is great, and the action comes mostly toward end, and I really like the warm feel. Overall, this is quite a nice beer, beautiful and fun to drink."
"This beer poured a clear reddish/amber color with a 3/4 inch head. The aroma was of malt, spices and a slight whiff of hops. Taste was malt sweetness, maple syrup and holiday spices. I could detect some nutmeg, cinammon, vanilla and allspice. This beer is mighty tasty and I try to pick some up every year if I can. I think the 5.99 I paid for a sixer was a bargain."
"The last beer is a SA winter mix pack I purchased. A best before month of March is notched on the label."
"I don't know if this was a bad keg or what the story was. I was quite surprised by the flaws in this beers. Normally Boston Beer makes products that, at the very least, don't offend."
"Drinkability is medium. Its full and flavorful so its not session beer for me. Though I did enjoy them spread out over time."
"A medium-brown color with an off-white head that didn't stick around very long and left behind only a touch of lacing. Aromas of roasted sugar, burnt wood, and honey seemed to come out. The taste was a dominated by sweet malt, but the finish was bitter. With time, the malt taste was closely followed by a hop bitterness that had flavors of various dried fruits and honey. The texture was soft and sticky with a bit of sweet fruit flavoring that lingered on my tongue. The drinkability was high because this is flavorful enough to enjoy over and over, but low enough in ABV to enjoy the evenning."
"Overall: This is easily my favorite of the Sam Adams brews. I didn't realize this was a wheat lager until seeing Jason's review, and lo and behold there it is on the label. Definitely worth a try."
"I prefer this out of the bottle as opposed to on-tap. Amber in appearance, leaving a good-ok lacing. The aroma is sweet and the taste has traces of fruit & nutmeg. The mouthfeel is very good, & could happily spend the night drinking only these. A slightly better Winter Warmer for my money, however, is Sam Adams Old Fezziwig (sp?)."
"After an aggressive pour, a huge off-white head forms on top of a deep amber beer. A lacing is left down the sides of the glass. The aroma is on the weak side, a malty sweetness dominates with not much else to speak of. The taste is delightfully nuanced. A malty sweetness presides, leaving a slight stickiness in the mouth. There is a bit of a nutmeg and cinnamon taste in the beginning and a slight bit of fruitiness in the background. The malt is king here though. As I already mentioned, it has a fair amount of sweetness, but this is cut by a nice toasted malt element that provides a biscuity taste, which keeps the sweetness from becoming cloying. The mouthfeel is fairly chewy for a lager, adding a nice amount of sturdiness. It is fairly drinkable, though it becomes a bit less appealing when it warms up. This is a tasty and harty winter-time lager. A nice choice when out and about and faced with the same old offerings."
"Pours a clear dark reddish/copper color, very small head, some carbonation, some lacing afterwards. Scents of malts, sweet toffee/caramel, and some spices. The taste is sweet malty and a slight roasty, with a dry finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, not a Winter Warmer in my book, but nice. Another great beer from Samuel Adams, Would definitely recommend to others."
"This is a tasty beer and I commend BBC for using spice subtly. And it actually does taste like higher quality cinammon than the supermarket variety as the label touts. This beer is a deal at $6 per sixer. Definitely worth a try."
"Had on tap at Shaker's in Plainville, MA. Great place for lunch, haven't tried dinner there yet. This beer is copper/brown in color with good clarity and has an aroma of freshly picked flowers and hops. The body is strong and the weight is just right for the style, not too heavy but not watered down, either. This is a rich, strong brew that is smooth and yummy, certainly a beer one can put down a lot of."
"Drinkability: Always good. You might not want to knock back 2 or 3 while on your lunch break but very smooth and easy to put back."
"Pours a dark copper color with a thin tan head that doesnt retain. The aroma is intensely malty with chocolate and toasted bread in the forefront, some floral hops, muted spices and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is nicely balanced with a chocolate and earthy malt character, and floral and grassy hops to balance, slight winter spices and a smidge of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium, with moderate carbonation and drinkability is good. Descent beer, not grea but tasty and drinkable."
"Flavor is not all there in my opinion. Some malts, and a touch of something sweet like gingerbread, but it just seems lacking. No hop character. A very thin flavor."
"Bit of head, bit of hops. Some spice in taste, chocolate malt and caramel for sweetness.nutmeg, cinammon Drop of fruit. Mild spice aroma. SLightly astringent finish. Not a bad one. An average craft beer. Medium body, suitably carbonated at Pizza Plant Transit."
"Drinkability: A solid brew, a bit lacking in complexities but still pretty good, and one that I would be happy to put back all night long."
"Drinkability is very good. For someone that is not a big fan of winter beers, I'm trying a lot and appreciating the style. This would be one of the better I've tried."
"The Sam Winter poured a deep brown, resembled stained cherry wood. Mostly sweet aroma bread and butter pudding. The taste is inviting and complex, gingerbread, some cream custard, and notes of clove and orange. Finishes with a small hop bite to balance things out. Mouthfeel and drink ability are good but not excellent."
"Went to my local dive and decided to try some winter brews, 'cause I hadn't had them for a while. The first one I had (which will remain nameless) wasn't very good. This Sam's was much better. It was a nice red color with a good head to it. It had a fruity smell to it and a pleasant fruity flavor, with a hint of hops. A very smooth, drinkable beer."
"Overall = A solid Winter warmer. Recommended."
"Appearance is a clear dark orange, with a small head and a little lacing. Smell is almost non-existant to me. Taste is something else: quite tasty, obviously on the malty side, with some cinnamon coming through. Seems better then I recall it being in the past. Very smooth on the palate; seems to be going down faster then most beers I drink. Like most good beers, it tastes best as it warms a little. Could stand to be heartier in body and alcohol for a WW, but the way it stands, its quite tasty and drinkable. I'd never refuse one...unless there was something better of course ;)"
"D - This is drinkable, although I would certainly prefer other beers to it. Would work well with some foods (Christmas goose perhaps?). I don't want another really, I don't know what it is, but I don't like this beer much at all."
"Very drinkable session beer for a winter evening. Great balance and lingering warmth make this highly satisfying."
"An enormously average beer, and not a memorable winter beer at all. I won't feel the need to try this again."
"Taste was where I was severely lost. This years attempt is too spicy and not beery enough. Every sip reminded me of oyster crackers more than beer. Just stale oyster crackers. The spiciness was not so overwhelming, just poorly balanced. The mouthfeel was also quite disappointed, leaving a lingering bad astringent feeling in my mouth. Just disappointing all around and not recommended this year. All in all, it was barely drinkable, even when my palate was worn out severely the first time I had it this season."
"Overall not a bad beer, but not a 6-pack i will pick up again.... at least not this year. i would say avoid unless your selection sucks. i would much rather the normal lager or ale to this one."
"The spices are what ruin it for me. Although they are not dominant, they are noticible in the nose and palate. To me, spices should either be front-and-center or not there at all. The body and maltiness are also not what they used to be. It's is a perfectly drinkable beer, but not as special as it used to be. There are plenty of other Sam Adams beers worth seeking out, but this is not one of them."
"I was drawn by the name Samuel Adams, self proclaimed brewer of the finest brews. To date not disappointed. So I see this Winter Brew and its a must try. In a pilsner glass the head is powerful to say the least. The beer pours a robust copper color. A fine lacing is left on the sides of the glass as the head recedes like a tide down east. The smell is pungent and apple-like spicy reminds me of autumn and the changing of the colors. The taste is also spicy apple like with hints of cinnamon and allspice. Good weight, more than a characteristic lager. A pleasure to drink, a great companion to a hearty meat and potatoes meal. Not necessarily just a winter beer but should be out just before Thanksgiving. A bit hearty for a session beer but for any meal is excellent."
"This is a nice beer. It's basically a Dunkelweizen brewed with a lager yeast instead of a Bavarian strain. Kind of a weird hybrid but a good idea that turned out rather nicely. I wish more American brewers would think of inventive hybrid styles like this."
"The beer pours a amber color with a nice head that holds a little and laces a little. It smells and tastes like sweet malts and spices - probably cinnamon. There is almost no presence of hops. There is good thickness, but it is a little overcarbonated which seems to be pretty common for a Sam Adams product. But it is one of the better winter seasonals. Sure beats their cranberry lambic and Harpoon's Winter Warmer."
"A dark amber colour in the glass with a good head that left little lacing. Aroma was very slight, but fruity and slightly sweet. Taste is slightly sweet with some caramel malts and spicy hop flavours coming through. Finish is dry with a lingering citrusy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, not overly carbonated. Although, since it is a Winter Warmer, I would have perfered a slightly higher ABV so that it actually provides a slight warming affect. However, its an excellent beer and I've drank a lot of them this season."
"I guess I liked it better this time around. Either they have improved the recipe, or my tastes have grown more accustomed to the type of flavors this beer exhibits. Whatever the case may be, I will probably not avoid it any more."
"Beautiful rubied amber body with a loud thick head of densely packed small tan bubbles. Not much lacing. The smell is rich and full of sweetness, both malt and holiday spices. Smooth and creamy with nice malt notes up front finishing with cinnamon and hints of hop bitters. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, light on the tongue. Nice and drinkable and an easy choice that is readily available around the holidays."
"This winter warmer brew was a tad bit disappointing. Not bad but to me it fell short in the flavor department. It poured a clear amber color that formed a light head that quickly disappeared. The smell was a very, very light hoppy and fruity smell. The taste is also very light with slight wheat and hop overtones. The carbonation gives a bit of a sharp bite to the tongue. The mouth feel is also light and even. Needs to be bumped up a notch in flavor."
"Pours a vibrant burnt orange color with a couple fingers of khaki cream on top and lacing galor. Nose is rich with musty, husky sweet malt, lactose/cream and gentle spices. Flavor is caramel/toffee sweet, with some creamy, spicy notes - like a gingerbread cookie with whipped cream on top. Mouthfeel is surprisingly rich for a winter warmer lager which makes for an indulgent drink, but makes it a filling experience. A very nice warmer here, very well executed. The spices tend to get out of control in this genre and Sam Adams did well to use them sparingly, but effectively. Kudos."
"The mouthfeel is light and somewhat creamy. Easy to drink and it keeps me satisfied throughout the session."
"The bottles taste closer to an Oktoberfest to me."
"drinkability: quite"
" This is still a fairly solid winter sipping beer that will probably be in my fridge intermittantly for the next few months."
"Notes: All around great winter lager...highly recommended."
"Poured a reddish-orange hue into a pint glass. Smells sweetly of caramel and toffee aromas, cinnamon and malt also present. Thick foamy cream-colored head lasts a few minutes before falling away to whitish lacing. Tastes very much like a brown ale, almost reminiscent to that of a Newcastle, although much more complex, with a much creamier yet light mouthfeel. Overall excellent lager, would definitely purchase again."
"This is still a solid, and pretty drinkable winter warmer, but I would reach for the Fezziwig before a Winter Lager - simply a personal preferenc."
"An average winter offering with kudos on the varied, season oriented smell. Maybe letting one rest for a year would bring the flavors together."
"Flavor was delectably spicy with not-so-subtle caramel, molasses and syrup tones. The spices were more of a burst on the palate (dominated by nutmeg and cinnamon) that quickly vanished. Just a slight hop presence at the end. Medium body with a slight syrupy feel. Definitely one of the most drinkable Sam Adams beers."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but I long for something with a bit more presence."
"This beer poured out with a small head. It is tea-like in color. The smell is a sweet smell. It has a nice lightly spiced taste. Not over the top like many winter warmers. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth. No bad aftertastes here. The drinkability is pretty good. I could drink more of these. This beer is higher end within the style."
"Body is almost medium with vigorous carbonation and a slick texture."
"Drinkability is good see above remarks, Sam Adams has been know to make good beers occasionally, this and there Oktoberfest plus their Schwarzbier."
"Notes: ""A dark wheat lager brewed with winter spices"" adorns the bottle. And thats very true, but not much more than this. A good winter brew nevertheless."
"Notes/Drinkability: Much better than their regular lager in my opinion. Pick this up if you see it in the store."
"Definitely a nice winter warmer. The spices remind one of the season and the warm alcohol flavor that is allowed to creep in at the end feels nice going down. I would certainly drink it again and could have in a row on a particularly cold winter night (yes it gets cold in Arizona!)"
"Drinkability: This is a ""where'd my beer go?"" experience."
"Tried this beer at the company Christmas party. Nice event, sit down dinner and band. The main beer choices were Coors Lite on tap and bottled Budweiser. As soon as they got the Sam Adams tap working, I was on it!!!! Appearance was good. I didn'[t notice a great head but it left some lacing and had a nice coppery/caramel color. Could definitely smell the spices, I'm figuring cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor was nicely balanced between the spices and malt flavor. Nothing too overpowering. The spices were noticible first and then smooth, rich malt and spice flavor. This beer is heavier and has a stronger mouthfeel than what I am used to (lagers, marzens and Pale Ales). It was very drinkable. I would have enjoyed something else to wash down dinner and then switch to this afterwards and just enjoy the rich flavor for it's own sake. I would drink this again."
"PS: The Sam Adams holiday pack in general is pleasing; only the Cranberry ""Lambic"" disappointed me."
"I just tried this for again without tasting anything prior to skew the flavor and I can honestly say that this is entirely too insipid for my taste. It really does taste like a weird waffle syrup of some kind without the sugar. It needs som e hops quick. Jeez, more often then not I'm finding I'm not a big fan of Sam Adams' offerings."
"And I also got a 12 of Milwaukee's Best Ice. And it sucks shit in comparison. There you go."
"from the bottle. poured a dark amber, with a small light tan head wit a small amount of lacing. aroma malts, caramel got a little pumpkin pie spices and just a small amount of hops. flavor caramel, spices, got some berries. not to bad of a beer good session beer"
"Another solid offering from Jim Koch and the gang. Pours a beautiful deep copper color with a nice fluffy tan head that stays around. I noticed a moderate amount of lacing. The smell is rich and malty with hints of cinammon, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie. Taste is very complex and perfectly balanced between the toasted malt, noble hops and winter spices. The warming effect from the alcohol is just noticable for a relatively high ABV (5.9%). A new winter favorite of mine. Hope Santa brings me more."
"I thought this was an easy drinking well balanced beer. But there was something in the aroma and flavor I couldn't quite place. Kind of reminded me of wheat bread."
"Taste is intricate and interesting. It's like laced coffee. A mild coffee flavor with bitter, roastedness going on, with spices all throughout it. Ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg? Caramel, toasted maltyness... it's interesting. Mouthfeel is also quite nice, warming, with a lightly dry finish. A very drinkable brew- warming, tasty, lovely."
"I'm a big fan of this seasonal beer - more complex and interesting than the standard Boston Lager. Lots of typical winter spice (nutmeg and allspice are definetely present), with some underlying tones of wood and banana. A most enjoyable beer and highly reccomended for this time of the year."
"Tastes of toasted malt with medium sweetness. Good level, low, level of hops balacing the malt. The spices show up as well, maybe allspice. Hint of tanginess. Nothing super exciting, but comes together fairly well. Good mouthfeel and I could easily drink a second."
"A must try!!"
"Taste; I get nutmeg upfront, then some biscuity malts and caramel, and some other spices I can't put my finger on. Mouthfeel was a litlle thin for what I like a winter warmer, but the carbonation was nice and smooth. I don't usually go for the Sam Adams beers anymore as I tend to be a bit disapointed in them nowadays, but I was surprised how good this was."
"Overall, surprisingly delightful and rich beer. A macro with a craft touch. Gotta go get some more. Sad there are only two in the twelve-pack."
"Tastes like it came out of a dirty tap. I like this beer minus the metal - did I mention the metal? Perhaps a re-review is in order at a later point in time."
"This beer came an orange gold with a creamy head that fell a bit but was sustained for the duration. Smells like a little cranberry sourness, an apple sweetness, a slight dry hop and a bit of grain. Tastes like blueberries, currants a touch of grapefruit with nice molasses sweetness. A few spices seem to be hiding in here as well. Mouth feel is full with a light carbonation. This is a tasty sipping beer. Lively enough to get your attention, but not overpowering."
"Grab a bottle and let it prepare you for the Sam Adams Double Bock this Winter."
"A bit more hop character than the standard SA Boston lager. Darker and more body too, but not as well balanced as its non-seasonal counterpart. Although, the warming alcohol presence does help it out."
"Overall, I'm very impressed with this. I haven't actually tried any Sam Adams before this but must admit that it's better than I was expecting. Can't wait to try again."
"Overall impression: Nice winter warmer - not overly complex but well made. Nice for the cold winter evenings to come."
"Deffinately taste the spices and malt, a good beer, but I would prefer maybe a little more hops. I had to review this beer over because I drank it a different temperature(let it warm up a little)and it had much more flavor. I was thinking that it needed to be really cold like most lagers, but you can pretty much drink it at ale temperatures."
"I guess it's a four straight down. This is far from a perfect beer, but it's very pleasant, doesn't get in the way of itself, and makes me happy to be drinking it. Nothing really amazing, but for what it is it is relatively flawless. High marks for style."
"Pours a dark amber with an off white, slightly tan head. Smells malty, cinnamon, with a slight hint of caramel and citris. Taste is caramel with malt sweetness, though slightly bitter in the back end. Medium bodied, goes down smooth but carbonation is apparent. Highly drinkable with its low alcohol and mild taste, not too sweet. I enjoy the Winter Lager more than their other seasonal offerings, but there are several better available in this years holiday 12 pack."
"This is a pretty straightforward holiday beer, but the wheat certainly adds a nice complexity. There is the usual cinnamon flavor, with the added citrus/tartness from wheat. Dark malts make this caramel sweet and rich. Recommended."
"Overall: Solid, drinkable winter warmer, but not as good as Old Fezziwig."
"Pours a nice dark copper color and makes a nice fluffy eggshell colored head that lingers around for a bit, makes some nice lacing as well. Aroma is strong of malt and winter spices, particularly cinnamon. Rich malty flavor, very little bittering or hop character, very slight spice in the background, a bit bready, some caramel sweetness. Light to medium body, peppery carbonation, finishes a bit sticky. Not bad, but not my favorite offering from Boston Beer Co."
"This beer pours a golden brown color with a light brown, fluffy head. The head fades slowly, leaving mediocre laces. This beer has a malty biscut like aroma. I detect a slight spicy aroma as well. It has a very slightly fruity aroma also. I detect a very subtle, mild hop aroma. This beer tastes biscut like. It is malty sweet. I taste a decent spice flavor. Cinnamon flavors are noticable. It has a very slight hop flavor, but it is almost not detectable. This beer goes down smooth leaving a spicy, biscut like aftertaste. This beer is maybe just a little over carbonated. I think this beer would make an excelent session beer. It is low in alcohol, and the mild flavor is quite appealing. This is always one of the beers I look forward to at Christmas time."
"Enjoyed the winter lager with some Thanksgiving leftovers and it complimented it perfectly."
"This is my first beer of this style and look forward to trying others. Once again a good offering from the Boston Brewing Company. Keep up the good work!!"
"This is not a stand out beer, but is still a quality one. Its not a bad addition to the winter mix pack."
"I could definitely drink a few of these. A beer you can keep tasting and that doesn't really fade away. Definitely good with a wide array of food too."
"Another Sam beer with a nice two finger head and a dark amber color.You can say what you want,their beers always look good.The smell is a little disappointing,average at best,with some spices and a little cooked veggie smell.This does taste pretty good however.A nice mix of malt and holiday spices make me look forward to this beer each year.It's not Sam's best beer,but it's still pretty good."
"A little too much carbonation for my taste; it seems to kick you right in the teeth as soon as it touches the tongue. This beer has the classic bitterness of Sam Adams products but is nicely hopped. This is an especially toasty and very malty beer, but this is exactly what one should be looking for in a winter brew. Really well rounded beer with a great warming feeling for those chilly winter nights; enjoy in front of the fire."
"Another solid seasonal offering from Samuel Adams."
"Drinkability: Highly quaffable. Another fine example from Sam Adams. Winter warmers don't generally impress me but this one is well done. I like it and I could even see warming this up and adding some mulling spices. Definitely recommended."
"overall- this was the first ""craft"" beer ive had back a couple years ago. it taste absolutely nothing like i remember. for me its a nice, easy to find seasonal beer. nothing spectacular but just solid and easy to drink."
"This is a hard beer for me to describe. The spice/flavoring is too overpowering to get a feel for the underlying beer. While I generally enjoy winter beers tremendously, this one just didn't do it for me. I think toning down the other stuff and ramping up the beer itself would improve it, but then again there's no accounting for taste."
"I picked this one up at Old Chicago for their winter beer fest and found it to be much more enjoyable that I expected it to be. It poured a very nice reddish copper color with a small head. It smelled mostly of toasted hops and spices. It ahs a nice level of carbonation and tastes great. It has a nice kick to it making it a very enjoyable beer. It tastes of spices, toasted hops, and a hint of caramel."
"Once again, say 'thanks' to Jim for producing a solid 'gateway' beer into a style I had not considered even remotely drinkable before. I'm sure it's not the best of its style, but it's tame enough for everyone to enjoy."
"The head was very low - surprisingly for a wheat-based beer (it says its wheat based on the bottle). The beer is a light brown color and seems more highly carbonated than a 'regular' beer. The aroma has a mild toastiness and maltiness, with some hops (or spices, hard to place) and is very clean. The beer's taste is flavorful with a nice rounded malty presence. There is a minor tartness and a slight bitterness at the end but this is only there to balance the beer. Overall this is a little uninspiring but not too bad. It doesn't really seem like a 'winter warmer' to me, though - a little light for that."
"12 oz., purchase before April notched on the back, along with a blurb about the cinnamon they used. Pours an orange/red that casts a bright red, almost pink shadow when light shines through. Smells sweet, with raisins, hops, ginger, allspice?, metal?, and a good dose of cinnamon. Cinnamon and ginger immediately on the palate, with other spices, dark/caramel malts, and maybe some hops, along with a crisp, medium mouthfeel. I remember it tasting better than this with less spices and more malts/heavier body."
"Good price ($3.25) made this a great sippin session brew"
"Pours a beautiful, clear, dark, reddish-copper with a small, off-white, tight head that quickly diminished to a thick film. Some decent lacing, especially early. The smell is mild and has a sweet caramel maltiness with some light spice and a hint of fruit. The taste is impressive, especially considering the lackluster initial nose. Big thick flavors of caramel, cookie and wheat, along with some herbs, leathery yeast and something else I cant put my finger on. It has a much larger body than expected and is lightly syrupy with low carbonation. Its a very interesting offering from BBC. Very enjoyable, and a bit on the low end of the spectrum of winter warmers as far as spices go, which is a good thing in my opinion. I hate when brewers go overboard on things like pickling spice. Definitely not a problem here, though my friends that do like the big spice flavors of winter warmers might be a bit disappointed by this beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: Weak. That's pretty much all I have to say about this. It tastes good, smells even better, but it's just a pansy version of what a winter warmer can be. This one doesn't warm you at all. Isn't that the point of the style anyways?"
"Has a very nice dark amber color. Extremely smooth and very drinkable. Very refreshing and rich taste. The taste makes you feel at home wherever you are. Not heavy on the stomach. Not much carbonation. Has a very pleasing and relaxing aroma. Not much head."
"This beer pours a nice amber brown with a nice head that stays around and leaves some lacing. Very nice. The smell is of wheat/caramel and spices. Well overall this tastes like a porter mixed with a dunkle. Weird. But it was nice with fruity malts and and allright almost of hop flavors. This is mildly spiced. Average mouthfeel. 2 or 3 of these would be enough, tastes more alcoholly than it is. Fairly drinkable though."
"Drinkability: Maybe my favorite Sam Adams brew, and maybe (aside from the Doppelbock in my opinion) their best seasonal. Very good for any time of year, especially for winter. I'd like to try it with a dessert eventually, as I think it'd be a perfect accompaniment for one."
"The taste was as smooth as I've had, with yeasts, hops and honey. It finished very clean and sweet, with a wonderful creamy aftertaste. It was something I could definitely see myself buying in the future, drinking on a cold winter night."
"Pours a dark amber, very clear, two fingers of fomay cream colored head, great retention, moderate lacing. Nose is nice malted wheat, some slight cinammon/nutmeg spices, a little light. Taste is the same maltiness, very smooth, giving way to a slight but sharp spiciness in the finish. Everything is very well rounded, the spices are just a little subdued for my tastes, but overall this is a nice flavorful malty winter warmer. Between this and the Old Fezziweg, I think this is slightly better due to a thicker moutfheel and fuller malt."
"It poured a full-bodied, darker amber color with a medium white head. Smell was fresh, yeasty and malty. Taste was of caramel with spices, slight fruit, and finishes with a very faint bitterness. Mouthfeel was of medium carbonation. Drinkability was very smooth and satisfying. When warmed, the presence of alcohol was more pronounced. A very good, consistent holiday/winter beer."
"Overall, this is my favorite Samuel Adams brew. It is a well-balanced, strong flavored and very impressive effort. Session beer, for cold late fall and winter nights? I could definitely see that."
"pouring created a nice head that left a thin lace over the top. has a dark amber color that almost has a raspberry color. my nose is a little stuffed so i am not getting too much of an aroma from the beer itself. as for flavor, it is very nice being incredibly smooth. it almost warms you from the inside."
"Verdict: Tasty seasonal offering that doesn't bash you over the head with spice flavor."
"Great drinkability! One of my favorite Sam offerings and by far my favorite winter beer. Sweet and tasty and always welcome in my home. Try one after Thanksgiving dinner, watching the Lions lose, (as usual), it's a wonderful thing."
"Pours a ruby orange hue, with good clarity. A creamy, off-white two finger head holds nicely, but produces weak lacing. Caramel and wheat nose, hiding a slight floral hop aroma. Strong malt sweetness from the wheat and an unrefined sugar taste; with a healthly hop bitterness that balances it out. Medium body and active carbonation leave only a touch of residual sweetness, and renders a good drinkability at the cost of the appropriate alcohol warmth. Not quite a weizenbock, and defintley not a lager, but a nice seasonal, no doubt."
"Notes: I love love freakin love this beer. My favorite Sam Adam's beer so far (although, to admit I haven't tried very many). At first I was a little surprised, and dissapointed, to learn that the abv on this was less than 6%. I figured a winter warmer ought to be a bit stronger. The beer tastes great the way it is though, and might actually be better for it. I like the quaffability of this beer. The spicing is subtle, and I could drink more than a few bottles over the course of a night without getting sick of it."
"Drinkability: Sweet flavor is enjoyable but there isn't much else to this beer. The spices don't come through and the flavor is only average."
"D: This is one of my favorite session beers in season. Good flavor for a good price. Reccommended."
"After about half way through, I have changed my opinion slightly. Not sure if I can attribute this to the raise in temperature or my taste buds acclimating. The taste is much more rounded. Still has a bit of cooking spice aftertaste, but much better (for whatever reason) halfway through."
"this is a perfect beer for a cold winter evening when you're not in the mood for a stout or porter, excellent lager. This is my first time trying this beer but i'll look forward to its release in years to come."
"Tasty stuff. A solid winter warmer."
"This brew pours a clear dark amber color. The head is small, white, and creamy. The aroma is very malty and clean. The taste is quite spicy, and interesting. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, this brew is a nice change of pace, and another solid offering from BBC."
"Beer i usually good. Happy beering."
"Pretty good winter warmer, usually at the right price."
"Very pleasant for a winter warmer."
"Nice dark reddish color. The spices in this beer hit you immediately and make for a tasty beer if you like something a bit on the sweet side and not so bitter. Clearly best suited for the colder weather but I can drink this one anytime just the same."
"not too strong, so a good many could be consumed. not all that warming, though"
"An impressively complex brew. The mix of spice, fruit, toastiness and malt meld together to produce a rich and flavorful beer. Recommended."
"Drinkability: I've had better winter beers, but this one is good. I'd definitely choose this over the mega-brews commonly found in the bars of my area. Would I buy the beer again? Sure. There is nothing objectionable here."
"Notes: I like this one better out of the bottle and/or good and fresh. Either way, it is a nudge or two better than your average beer."
"Nice full mouthfeel coats the tongue without being chewy. Very drinkable, especially during a cold snap."
"I'd recommend it, but not something I would drink all the time."
" This beer (to me) is very drinkable for a winter lager beir. I have not sampled a whole lot of winter lagers, and those I have generally were not this thirst quenching. Being that Samuel Adams Brewing Company made this, it was slightly expected that this beer might lean more towards a more thirst quenching winter lager. The mouthfeel hit with me very well."
"will try again"
"A nice, basic but tasty winter seasonal overall. It's very easy to drink and just a solid brew overall. It won't knock your socks off, but it won't disappoint either."
"Cheers..."
"This one surprised me. Pours a brown color with a medium head that dies off quickly and leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a nutty character with some sweetness. The flavor has a maple syrup component as well as some sweet malts and a bit of spice. Some hops are evident in there as well. The mouthfeel was moderate, but just thick enough. Drinkability was good. This is probably the best beer I've had out of the Sam Adams Winter 12 pack."
"A very dark amber/brown beer with ruby highlights. Small bubbly off white head. Has a sweet malty aroma with ahint of carmel in the background. The malty sweetness starts out the flavor. There is a nice burst of hop bitterness in the middle and a hint of carmel with a smooth finish."
"This beer is going on sale everywhere now that Spring is getting ready to be sprung, and I might just grab a couple more 12 packs to hold me off until November."
"Drinkability: I had my second pint ordered before I was 2/3 finished with the first one - and I finished that first one in about 6 big, satisfying swigs. The main bottle vs. tap difference of subdued maltiness makes this beer very drinkable and very refreshing."
"Pours a dark red/maroon color, with a very small creamy, off-white head. Good retention from what it had on the pour. Smells very sweet with malt, brown sugar, and maple syrup. Slight cinnamon spiciness present. Taste is very full and rich. Big malt flavors, which give way to roasted malt/chcolate flavors, and closing with honey sweetness. Mouthfeel is very full with carbonation and maltiness. A Good hearty winter brew, maybe not that sessionable, but very good anyways."
"This poured a mid amber, not much of a head, left a slight collar most of the way, smell was a bit fruity, not a lot of aroma, taste was decent, light hops, good bit of malt and some spiciness, hint of fruit as well, mouthfeel was moderately carbonated, a bit creamy, smooth, drinkability is good, I had 2- 20 oz.'ers with my meal, and it was quite a bit better on-tap, than the bottles I bought on the way home, not bad, nothing phenomenal. I could drink this again, but definitely on-tap!"
"Overall, this one is ok, but doesn't grab me on a 70 degree southern California winter's night..."
"Has a deep amber color, slightly cloudy. The head is creamy white and very sticky. Smells sweet and spicy. The taste is a blend of spicies. There is good amount of carbonation and alcohol. Seems to hit the taste buds fast. Cinnamon, some sugar, and wheat malts can also be found in the taste. I enjoy this beer every winter. I am always looking forward for it's release. 6.94% alc. by volume, very toasty! [correction} It has come to my attention that Sam Adams lowered the alcohol by volume to 5.8%"
"Tastes flat and like rice. Again, I thought they didn't DO that... Thin-bodied but a good texture. Budweiser-esque palate gives way to a cloying, sticky zing. Not impressed."
"Drinkability: A very nice effort from SA; I'll be back for more"
"Overall-Winter warmer indeed, another fine brew from Sam Adams that I thoroughly enjoyed, all characteristics of a brew of this kind are here and then some. Perfect for the winter months, just beware of the kick."
"I just wasn't so pumped about this one. Looks pretty good though. Pours a darkish red amber color with a tiny bit of tan off-white head. The smell seems really off to me. Almost smells like warm yogurt or something as unappealing as that. I can detect some maltiness under that strange scent though. Taste is passable, but not as direct as I might like. The nutty malts come through, though there's a lot of other flavors that sort of seem to take a back seat. Nothing really meshes well with this beer, it's just sort of a hodge-podge of grains and water. Not a thrilling mouthfeel either, a tad watery. Decently drinkable, but I think Sam Adams makes better brew than this one. Maybe it's better in the bottle, but I haven't tried that this year."
"This beer pours a dark almond color, with a tan head. This beer has a fairly malty smell with a bit of spice in it too. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy. This beer has hints of vanilla and nutmeg, which results in an interesting and enjoyable flavor. I wish this wasn't a seasonal beer, it is very good in my opinion, quite drinkable."
"This is much tastier than their regular beer. I'm pleasantly surprised."
"I sampled a 12 ouncer with ""purchase before"" dating notched onto the label. Pours a fairly dark shade of almond, clear, witha soft tan head, which is showing respectable retention. Alot of bubbles continue to rise to the top. Real nice long lasting and well developed lacing left behind after a swig or two. Nose is malty with some faint spicing noticable. This is a smooth drinking winter warmer.Its lighter in body then others of the style. They call it a ""dark wheat lager"". Mouthfeel is quite creamy. Notes of vanilla and nutmeg in a generally bready flavor profile. Nice, highly drinkable cold weather brew. Well worth a try, enjoyable sessioner, that packs a punch at 6.9%!"
"Color on this is a nice deep amber color, smallish head that vanishes quickly. I get some sharp hops on the nose, flowery hops, probably european, but just a guess. Taste is pretty average, some rich malts then bounced down against the hops. I don't pick up any spices that are supposed to be here. This is a step above average beers, but not by much. Not great, but not bad.."
"I could certainly drink more than one of these in a sitting, particularly if I'm just hanging out with friends or enjoying a nice big multi-course meal. Beware the slightly higher alcohol content if you choose to drink more than one. It was definitely a nice winter seasonal."
"Quite drinkable if you like IPA's as this reminded me more of an IPA than anything else."
"I think that it is rediculous when BBC gets any crap on BA - their beers are solid and we owe them a ton for the role they serve in the beer world."
"Not such a bad winter warmer but definately less complex than most. Doesn't have that ""piney"" or ""sprucy"" character that some may like, but i find this more drinkable than most as I'm not a big tree taste fan... unless its maple."
"Drinkability- Can't get over this metallic taste. It pretty much ruins the whole experience for me. Wonder if I just got a bad batch. Truthfully, I wasn't expecting much anyway. No big loss here."
"I noticed the sam adams website says 5.8 % abv while BA says 6.94%. Judging by the way it tastes and the way I feel after drinking a couple, I would go with the 5.8%."
"Pours an amber colour into the glass, the head disappears quickly. Malty aroma and some hints of caramel. Has a warming roasted malty taste, also a bit spicy taste. Spicy from orange peel i think. It has a bready aftertaste. A nice beer for the winter sessions."
"A great winter time beverage. Pours a nice oaked cherry with mohagany notes, the head is creamy/off white with good head retention. The smell is of dark roasted malts and nice syrup tones, hints of caramel tickle the nose. The taste has oaked rasins dipped in caramel, very nice but light enough to have more than enough. Light bodied and very nice, drink these and you won't want winter to end."
"Drinkability: much like many winter/christmas brews, the spice only allows me to have a few. I can stomach quite a few more of these than I can of GLB Chirstmas Ale, yet I don't think that's a good thing. There's something to be said for the overwhelming spice that accompanies this style of beer, and I believe Sam Adams is slightly off the mark."
"Pours with a two-finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Clear, deep amber color. Medium bodied. Floral nose. Light-medium carbonation. Starts prickly and malty with a little hops, mellow finish. More flavor as it warms. Much better than their regular lager. 83¢ for a 12oz bottle from Market Basket Concord, NH."
"Stuck, pea coat covering of seemingly creamy head. Deep, ruby red hue to an almost luminescent mahogany hue that is frozen like an icy pond cracking with temperature drops on a still night. Kind of a dewy, pre-pubescent malt character on nose with some nutmeg and just a touch of allspice thrown in for talking points. Washed up on the beach, driftwood malt fire-in-the-hole splash to start, with a me-love-you-long-time promise of some holiday spices, but there simply is no delivery. Malt is weak; simply unimpressed overall."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side but it smooth and easy to drink. I could have a few of these and it's nice on a cold night. Almost reminds me of a spiced up oktoberfest brew. Worth a try."
"The taste is bready and sweet and has nice malt highlights. The starchiness is a bit much after a while as it makes it necessary to brush one's teeth after a beer or two. Still, the rich, warm, and almost fruity flavor is quite nice, and a winter treat."
"great copper tone, full, sturdy head with great staying power, the spices in the smell and flavor were not overpowering by any means, I just didn't like em, I guess I just like hops and malt, I don't want my beer tasting at all like a pumpkin pie, also there was a sour note in the aftertaste that really bugged me"
"A very balanced, drinkable beer. Makes me think well of the brewer in spite of their dorky commercials and tendency avoid distinctive brews."
"Served in a very tall, very narrow pilsner glass at California Pizza Kitchen. The beer came out with a great looking head that gave off a great aroma and first taste. The beer was red with a hint of amber and smelled of raspberry and maybe cherry as well as some mild spices like nutmeg. That first taste with some head and beer gave me much of the same. Once I was strictly into the beer, it was smooth, although maybe a little too much carbonation for this type of beer. It did well with my pizza and it is definitely an annual beer that I would have again, although probably only one of these per sitting because of the sweetness."
"This is a slightly better than most middle of the road WW. It has complexity is the smell and the taste of roasted malt and perhaps a prolonged boil. There is some light spicing that must be going on perhaps some oragne zest and nutmeg, but very light touch as the malt prevails and the hops are present only as an after thought. It is a very nice beer that I would drink over SS WW any day."
"This was my first beer from my 2004 Sam Adams Wimter Classics 12 pack. As a fan of the Boston Lager, I was looking forward to sampling the winter brews from BBC. The Winter Lager is a great start and did not disappoint. It pours a beautiful bright amber color with a slight off-white head about 1/4 inch thick. Not a great deal of aroma here, but I pick up small scents of nutmeg or cinammon that you may expect from a winter selection, plus some light hops and malt. The taste is nice with a good balance of hops and malt, and I also pick up a slight bitter fruity taste, almost reminding of the after-taste of a fresh sour apple. Carbonation is excellent and the lager fills your mouth and body with a jolt of wamth that you would hope for in a winter warmer. Drinkability is above average, as I could see myself drinking a number of these at a holiday gathering. Overall, a great start to my Winter Classics pack...although I am not looking forward to the Cranberry ""lambic"" based on the reviews I have read so far."
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a small off-white head. Sweet, malty aroma. The flavor is malty with a decent amount of hops. I find this beer to be overly sweet. There is a nice spiciness, but not too spicy like so many winter beers. Medium mouthfeel. Like most beers from Sam Adams, this beer is very drinkable."
"Excellent choice to start the holidays, I could not get enough of this at a Christmas party last night. The hints of cinnamon made my mouth sparkle, along with its refreshing taste. Sam Adams continues to impress me. Everyone else around me, even those stubborn to drink anything besides BMC agreed this time. Aroma and appearance were not the highlights for this winter warmer."
"It tastes of sweet malts and spices, crackers and fruits, just enough hops to offset the sweetness. Some spiciness in the mix. Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation up front, then creamy, with nice finish. Very drinkable"
"Elements of the flavor of this beer remind of of Dixie Blackened Voodoo, I think that is because this beer has a molasses-like flavor. Appearance is amber-brown with average-sized, creamy head. Smell is treachy, nice and full. Taste is totally malty, with some taste of spices in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little creamy, which fits this beer nicely. This is an enjoyable beer, I like this more than the similar Blackened Voodoo, because this doesn't cloy."
"2004 release. Been a while since I've had this. Label has changed, but the beer is as I remember it. Pours reddish brown with an impressive off white head that falls to a sustantial ring, large bubbles. Sweet fruit aroma with some spices, a little peppery. Creamy mouthful. Sweet malt in the taste with that slight metallic twang I notice in a lot of Sammys. Finishes with a nice hop kick. Warming alcohol notes, a very nice winter lager. Solid all around."
"Overall, this is an average brew. I'd return to it again, but only if I had to."
"From the Winter Sampler pack. Poured aggressively, it offers a 1 finger white head with ok staying power. Body is a burnt amber. Aroma is of sweet malt and spice (corriander?). Taste offers up more spiciness. A surprising fruity apple finish is present. A decent beer which I seem to enjoy every winter."
"Keeping me warm during a cold Colorado winter."
"Final Thought: It's a much stronger version of their Boston Lager in short, a solid seasonal..."
"Poured a very nice,deep copper color. A slight head that leaves a trace of lacing on down. Not much aroma-slightly toasted malt,maybe a hint of caramel. Malt flavor dominates. Quite crisp on the palate actually. Some residual sweetness. Dont get any of the ""winter spices"" the label speaks of. Decent body. A very drinkable beer but I dont think it would be the first thing I reach for in the way of ""winter beers"". I honestly think this and some of the other SA seasonals have been toned down over the years. This seems to become more lackluster with every year."
"When I was younger this was one winter seasonal that I looked foward to seeing on the shelves. This is a solid choice and a great pick when in the boston area selection is rather limited."
"Mouthfeel was good. Medium-ish body considering it's 7% almost. A nice option during the winter months. But I would of liked to see a little more spices. I remember last year's had a little bit more of a kick with the spices. But nevertheless, a good brew."
"1/2"" light beige head over a coppery brew, and lacing was good. Aroma was very light, what was present was yeasty. Sedate caramel malts flavor, with slight hops character. Mouthfeel somewhat neutral, and drinkability good. Another more homogenized brew from Sam Adams to try and meet everyone's expectations, most likely overly impressing no one. Still not a bad brew, however, and a good choice from a limited tap menu..."
"Pours a mild reddish brown color with a foamy head that doesn't last long. Full of carbonation but little smell and flavor for what I have come to expect for a winter brew. There is a little taste of hopps along with lingering spice in the background but it is not overpowering. An easy beer to drink but not what I look for in a winter beer. It is easy to put away a few of these unlike other beers of the type which are more filling and strong tasting. Still not a bad beer, nothing really stands out and nothing really falters. Not bad to try but if you want that spicy harty winter beer look elsewhere."
"Pours a dark amber color and has little or no head and leaves no lace. The caramel malts dominate the aroma and mix in a interesting fashion with the wheat malts. The wheat lightens this lager up a lot, but it still has a nice body with a nice malty backbone. Definitely a drinkable winter beer."
"Well, the pour was a dark copper red but the head was lacking a bit in size and seemed a little fizzy. The smell has some nice spice to it but was a little strong on the alcohol. That's about all the bad that I have to say about this beer. The taste had an amazing complexity. Caramel malty sweetness upfront followed by a roasted barley flavor that holds for the duration of the drink. The spices are perfect in amount and flavor. There seems to be a good amount of cinnamon, which I love, and ginger but they never get too strong and mix beautifully with the malts and hops, just perfect. Hops are spicy and have a European flavor to them. They seem to come with the spices but pick up towards the finish. Slightly belly warming on the way down, which is the intent of this beer right. Body is medium thick and holds the flavors really well. Very drinkable, but maybe after a few I might grow a little tired but I'm not sure, i guess i gotta try sometime soon to see."
"Pours translucent dark reddish-brown with moderate foamy head. I was expecting more spice in the nose, mostly was malts, a little hops, and alcohol. Taste was surprisingly unspiced, mainly malt and some fruity notes. However, despite its taste shortcomings, it is still a solid, consistent brew from Sam. I'd drink it again."
"I was presented with a translucent amber pour that was topped with a fine rocky tan head. It had light malt aroma. The taste was a fine malty brew with quite a bit of fruitiness to it, and even a strong apricot and hop finish. The beer is medium bodied and oily. This is a nice beer and pleasantly sweet and fruity. I will definately be sampling more of this as it seems to be widely available at bars that normally don't have a decent beer on tap."
"One of the better of the Sam Adams main line of beers, this is a product I look forward to every year. They seem to have fixed the label, which used to read ""Winter Lager"" and underneath it ""A Dark Wheat Ale"". It's now simply ""Winter Brew"" [and underneath: ""A dark wheat malt liquor""], with no hint of whether it's an ale or lager."
"It has some nice body to it and it is very enjoyable now that the weather has cooled down."
"A dark orange/red color, with a light tan head that dissipates in a minute or two. Faint odor of spices; nothing really stands out. Taste is a bit on the hoppy side, with a slightly bitter/sour aftertaste. Pleasant but undistinguised, overall. Falls somewhere near the middle of the curve in the Great Beer Lineup."
"Reddish/auburn color, with minimal head, which dissipates quickly. Aroma is of cloves and mild almond & malt. Good hop flavor, with no initial bitterness. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste, which is pleasant. Heavy feel on the palate, but not overly malty. Well balanced, with just enough mixture of hops an dmalt to make a pleasing, non-session beer."
"A medium body, more like a wheat or thin brown ale than a lager, even a seasonal one. Quite drinkable, but would have liked the spices to have been more noticeable."
"This ""dark wheat lager"" pours a clear, deep amber body with a ruby cast. It's topped by a frothy head of ivory cream that holds exceptionally well and leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. The nose is malty and clean with a hint of hops and just a suggestion of the winter spices that are used. They do come out in the flavor, however, once the rich, wheaty and caramel-glazed maltiness subsides a little bit; and they stick around to linger in the aftertaste. A bit of cinnamon is discernable, and perhaps some nutmeg, but overall the spices are nicely restrained, lending more to balance than flavor. And it's really well-balanced with the spices working in tandem with the low-key bitterness to balance the malt and dry the finish. A slap of delicately spicy noble hop ties everything together throughout; and it's alternating sweet malt - spicy finish keeps it really drinkable. Nicely done! A very enjoyable ""winter"" ale that's quite welcome on my table at any time during the year."
"good beer to drink around the holidays, nice sweet taste, something to look forward to around christmas, very filling and full bodied, wouldent reccomend drinking with a full course meal, but better as somethign to enjoy talking with friends and family, making fun of louis for breaking the christmas train ect..."
"Another gem of a seasonal from our boys at the BBC. Dark and rich, very complex. Got it in the Winter variety pack, next year I'll be looking for 12 packs of this. Drinkability was only hindered by the higher than average ABV. A great brew for a cold Winter's night."
"Lots of delicious sweet wheat malt. Dark and ripe fruits dominate the taste profile. Perfect spicy hops in the background. Deceptively strong. Oh, I just love this beer. Amazed I found it in early May. I will go back to this same store and buy more because I just can't get enough of it."
"Surprisingly damned good! I wish I would've bought more of this when it was still around. One of the first BBC brews i've really liked!"
"This is a decent winter beer, but I don't find it to be all that exciting."
"Overall a great winter beer. Its basically a bigger beefier version of the boston lager. Sort of like what the Boston lager would taste like if it were a barleywine but without the alcohol content. Still a great winter session beer."
"A nice winter lager, not the greatest though."
"This beer pours amber-brown with a thick sand-colored head. The head itself thins, but remains at least a few millimeters thick until the last drop of beer is imbibed. Overall, I found Winter Lager to be a very enjoyable beer, although it was not dazzling enough to become one of my favorites."
"Notes: I was impressed with this one. Very drinkable."
"I'd be interested to re-review this when next year's comes out and try it earlier in the season."
"A great session beer for a long winters night."
"It is a dark copper color with a tan head. You can smell the spices in the aroma, but it is not overwhelming. The body is medium to full. It is malty with some caramel and buttery notes as well as the spices (I pick up the citrus and cinnamon the most). The finish is crisp and has a warming bite. A nice winter beer that is not heavy and goes down smooth."
"Very drinkable, strong yet civilized brew. Not quite a top 50 brew, but probably the best thing you can get at your local supermarket tonight! ;)"
"All in all, the Winter Lager is my favorite Sam Adams and one of my favorite beers period!"
"A brandy beer to be used with good friends in deep conversation."
"This is exactly the way a winter lager should look. Beautiful rust color and fluffy tan head. The taste has a wonderful amount of honey, orange, corriander, and other spices. The spices are there, but it ends with a sweet finish. It is only the end of February and I am already dreading the soon-to-be disappearing winter brews like this one. This truly is one of my favorite from Sam Adams"
"This deep red amber lager left a nice lacing down the side of my pint. Smell a hint of cinamon and ginger amongst the caramel malts. This beer is not heavily hopped and has a nice caramel spiced malted finish. It has a nice mouthfeel to it as the malts weigh this brew nicely. This is quite more interesting than the Sam lager which is enjoyable in itself. It warms me up nicely on a cool desert winter night!"
"Smells of fruity (grapes) wheat malt, with a faint hop backing (tettnanger?). Taste is spicy, fruity, with a crisp wheat feel. Light bitterness in the finish. Not bad, but it could be tastier (and better)."
"I actually was pleasantly surprised with this beer. My expectations were exceeded by this sturdy and eventful lager. The spices were apparent, but never in your face. Hats-off to the brewers for crafting a beer with great balance and originality!"
"Beef Notes: Not my favorite Sam or winter brew by a long shot. I had it on tap and it was better, but it's still a decent beer."
"Fairly clean, aside from the diacetyl. It could possibly be the lines. Maybe it's some spice I'm not familiar with. A very unusual beer, I'm not quite sure what style this could be. Spice, wheat malt, odd hops. Maybe some kind of wacko agressively hopped bock interpretation? Not bad, but this is easily my least favorite beer from Boston Beer Co. The flavors are sort of indistinct, with an odd roughness to the overall feel. I think the carbonation on all of Sam Adams' lagers is a bit too agressive. Good with dinner, but I didn't want another one."
"This is a beautifully clear beer. The color is like an amber copper with ruby red highlights. Creamy white head of foam. The aroma is creamy and buttery smooth, with the emphasis on butter. Taste is oily sweet, buttery crisp with their winter spices and flavorful. Not sure what spices are in this beer  Hard to distinguish. The body is medium sweet with a soft spicy finish. Interesting, flavorful."
"The color is copper wit a big off white foamy head that stays for a good time dissipating to nice lacing that clings to the walls of the glass. Has a nice smell of floral, spice and nuts, a real nice mix! A good beer for the cold days of winter. As I said earlier, there are better winter brews available, but this one is not bad!"
"For a winter seasonal from a (sorta) mass-producer of beer, Samuel Adams Winter Lager is a standout. And at its price level, this lager even more appealing."
"Foamy slightly sticky light tan head that lasts a long time. Head does eventually diminish to a scattering on the surface and a ring around the edge of the glass. The brew is clear reddish-brown in color. Good bit of malt on the nose. Carmel notes are apparent. Spices are also noticeable  brown sugar, ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Some light notes of dark fruits are also present. Hops are light, but noticeable. Nice start with malt, bread notes, and light flavor of dark fruits. Spices similar to the aroma come to the foreground next. Hop finish balances out the brew nicely, and lingers for a short period. Not being a huge lager fan to start with, I wasnt expecting much. This one doesnt blow the roof of the building, but its nice nonetheless, and is actually better then I was expecting from my memories."
"This lager poured a clear, deep red, chestnut color with creamy, tan foam that clung to the glass and left some lace. The smell was very niceand crisp and malty with aromas of biscuit. The taste was slightly sweet and malty with flavors of bread, some tangy hops, a bit of floral hops, a mild bitterness and a hint of spice. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and good carbonation. The finish was hoppy. This was a surprisingly good lager and was easy to drink. Kudos to Boston Beer Co. for this year's batch of this lager."
"Big, light tan, fine, foamy head on top of a deep, reddish-copper body. Clumpy, sticky lacing. The aroma is very nutty and a little tangy. Roasty grains in the tangy front. The middle turns sourish with a little roasty chocolate. Smooth, but a little thin. Nuts! in the finish. More roasty grains and some dark, bitter chocolate. This is a nice, grainsy brown with a great, dry finish. I like it."
"This maple syrup colored brew hits the nose with an ample malty aroma of warm bread. The mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant. There is a spicy flavor there but it rightly is too subtle for me to guess the spice. The wheat yields a nice bready flavor to go along with the substantial maltiness, Just enough hops for a little length om the tongue. I'd like another."
"It is a copper-brown color. Mild aroma. Hints of spices and malts. There is somewhat of a tan head. Smooth and creamy taste. This is good, but it still is very nondescript. I would never turn one down, but there is no compelling reason to buy it with beers like Sierra Nevada Celebration or Pyramid Snow Cap out there."
"This beer was very...well, delectable. It had a moderate head and had a great taste, but somewhat of a strong aftertaste. I've only had this and the Boston Ale before, and I most certainly would recommend this brand before I would the Samuel Adams Boston Ale. PS---Boston Sucks, and Grimaldi blows."
"Drinkabililty: Not the best winter variety I've had, but this is a darn good beer. Kudos, Mr. Koch. It's a pretty cold day in PA today and this is hitting the spot."
"I'm having mine with a pepperoni pizza and I'm not complaining about the pairing, that's for certain. But, I was thinking a medium-heat curry chicken dish would go nice. Or perhaps Tandoori chicken."
"The body is slightly thinner than expected. The spices ride the tongue for a short while after swallowing. This is easily drinkable, as this is one of the mellower winter beers out there. The flavor is not overwhelming but enjoyable, so several of these can be quaffed."
"Good mouthfeel, smooth finish. VERY drinkable, although the ABV might slow you down after you've had a couple. This beer is an excellent template for how a spiced beer should be brewed. Incredibly balanced and tasty, this one is a hands-down winner."
"Overall Impression: A great looking, good tasting beer. Overall a bit on the mild side. Nice spices, hides the alcohol well: good beer! Recommended."
"All in all, Winter Lager is an enjoyable winter beer (the label says that it's 'a dark wheat lager brewed with winter spices'). It's my first Sam Adams brew and I was pleasantly surprised. I can see myself buying this one again."
"This is a good tasting amber colored lager beer that always seems to sneak up on me, if you know what I mean...it's a little stronger than your average lager. I usually get this in a Sam Adams Holiday Classics sampler pack that is often a gift. It's a fairly tasty winter brew. The almost wine-like malty aroma and spicy aroma is very pleasant. This beer is brewed with ""winter spices"" but I'm not sure which of these are present. I smell a bit of cardamom and perhaps a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. I don't know that I can taste the spices, although there is peculier dryish character towards the finish that reminds me of nutmeg. The tawny malt flavors of this beer give it additional character. The finish is bit fruity yet fairly dry. One of the better winter beers, especially when fresh. Shouldn't be served too cold to appreciate it's character, even though it's a lager."
"Very easy to drink and after the Old Feziwig, the best of the Sam Adams winter beers. Better on tap than in bottles, but either way it is good."
"Not a bad offering from Sam Adams. Though beer snobs might look down on Boston Beer, when they make a good beer, it should be applauded, and this is quite an interesting offering, and I'd probably have one next year."
"Drinkability: I think the spice can get to you with this one if you drink too many in a row. If you like Christmas spice, then this is a beer for you that you can drink all night long. In my opinion, if your only having a couple of em, then this is an easy drinking brew with good taste, low carbonation and great mouthfeel."
"A very drinkable brew, very mild and low key but tasty."
"bottle I would rate slighlty less."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is fruity and full of spices. The lager smell comes through revealing a bit of yeasty scent. The taste is decent. There is quite a lot of ginger used in this one. There are some crystal malts here giving it a malty taste. It's crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking seasonal beer. I always look forward each year to having one."
"(I've been on a personal boycott of S.A. products but this is the best S.A. I've had in years)"
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, not that memorable."
"I tried this beer at both fridge cold and room temperature. Of the two choices, I have found that it tastes better when cold. When it pours into the glass, the head climbs up high to the rim with small to medium bubbles. In fact, I'd say the head was uncharacteristic of a typical lager. I really enjoyed the rich, bold color of this lager and could hardly wait to dive into it after a long night at work. The taste is very clean. There isn't a lot of extra spices in there, which is something I've come to expect from winter brews. In fact, I was looking for more of a holiday beer. What I got was a very drinkable lager. After taste fades quickly even with massive swishing. This sealed the deal: if you buy a Samuel Adams holiday beer, buy the Uncle Fezziwig."
"I would drink this again if out and about and best choice on tap but not sure if I would buy any bottles for home consumption."
"Comments: I didnt care at all for the 2003 offering, but the 2004 sample that I had was so above and beyond the 03 that I completely rewrote the review."
"This beer was served ice cold and improved a little as it warmed, although because it went down so easily, maybe it didn't last long enough to show its true character."
"The tatse is quite nice. I'm not a huge lager fan, but this was something I could drink all evening long. Nice caramel malt with a spicey middle. Scant hop burn at the end. Moderate body makes it highly quaffable."
"Pours a good half-inch head over a coppery body. But not a lot of smell. Maltiness is pleasant without having too much actual taste, though, just a little bit crystal. I had not pegged this for a wheat. Couldn't peg any kind of hop profile. Leaves a decent enough malty aftertaste."
"The color as it comes fresh from the bottle a pellucid burnished copper with a mastodonic head that is frothy in texture and the color light tan with a thick sealing sheet of lace. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and pleasing to the senses with the start lightly sweet and decently malted, top is fair to middling in feel. Finish is modestly carbonated, the hops relatively unobtrusive in their spiciness, quite dry aftertaste, another of those benign beers that are just plain good to drink when youre not in the mood for a Bad Boy beer. Ive always found Samuel Adams beers to be quite drinkable and always a good session beer."
"Cheers"
"Color is bronze-to-copper with a distinct redness in the main body. Translucent bronze when held to light with decent carbonation. White head of about one finger of foam fades shortly to a spotty ring of foam around edge of glass. Aroma is very sweet and malty; a vaguely citric hop presence makes itself known in the middle of the nose as the beer warms. Spices, which are also vague in the aroma, are much more prominent in the flavor: slightly nutmeggy and clovey, with cinnamon gradually coming to the fore. This balances nicely with a sweet maltiness, and more citric hop that begins early in the palate and lasts. Mouthfeel is refreshing and sort of wet (because this is a ""wheat lager," according to the label?) with a slight tingle of carbonation. I'm not sure what food I'd match this with, but this ought to be a very solid session beer. Comfortable and easy-drinking."
"I am consistently surprised at a brewery that can simultaneously make beers like the flagship lager and ale, and then make ""beers"" like the cherry wheat. This one finally falls in between. I neither like it nor hate it. The aroma is immediately sweet and somewhat attractive. You can definitely smell the spice. It pours nicely with a off-white head to reveal a medium2dark amber color. The flavor is, in my humble opinion always a bit off and unbalanced(I've had several six-packs to make sure I wasn't just tasting the occasional off-batch). Did anyone say that a spiced beer shouldn't be hop balanced?"
"A well balanced bit of malt goes nicely with the spices from the nose. Crisp & smooth like a lager should be. Just a tingle of hops at the back end remind you that its beer."
"Very good, and while not great, a fun stronger lager for the colder months. I sip it by the fire with She Who Much Be Obeyed when I'm of the mind to drink what she drinks. They flow easily and tastily. She looks forward to the fall release each year, and while I'm not quite as atwitter as she, I certainly don't dread it."
"In the mouth it is fluffy. Elements of lean, woody, hop tannins coexist with raw sugars, balancing out more-or-less dry. Some maraschino cherry and cranberry fruit prevails on the mid-palate together with sweet spice flavors."
"Not bad by any means, but not a holy grail or anything either...Color when served was clear Irish Setter red, no head to speak of. Aroma was malty. Taste to me was of a sweet biscuit mix, hops were nowhere to be found. Not sure where the spices went. I would have again if at a bar where this was about it...pleasant and easy to drink, but no big deal. pat"
"John"
"This is a brew I usually look forward too every year, as it was one of my first winter beers. Pours a crystal copper color with a medium head. Lacing was not significant. A sweet one with some hop bitterness as well. Drinkabilility is good but not one of Sammy's best IMO. Though it did get easier to drink as the night progressed."
"I could tell right away upon pouring this one that it was going to be good. Had a nice, dark, bronze colour with a quite thick tan coloured head. One can tell from the smell that this is a sweet, spicey one. The taste, however, is even sweeter and spicier than the smell seems to indicate. Not a lot of carbonation in this one, which makes it easy to drink. I feel confident that I could knock out quite a few of these lovelies with little trouble. I'll certainly be buying more of this."
"Medium feel and very easy drinking - very smooth, no overpowering alcohol sense. Might be the best easily available winter beer out there. Drink it in the same session as Old Fezziwig and you won't like it as much, seems like a weaker version. It's preferable on it's own."
"Color is deep copper with an sticky off white head that trails down the glass.Aroma is definitely of a spiced lager.Picking up citrus,nutmeg,cinnamon, a bit of wheat and a slight alcohol scent on the end.Milky feel and mellow balance of malt and hops.Nice warming effect with even taste of spices and citrus.Finish is slight spice with dryness.A very interesting take on a winter beer.I like this a lot and will continue to look forward to it in winters to come."
"Winter Lager has an easy drinkability and a pleasant malty flavor. It's a nice brew for a quiet winter's night."
"Poured a crystal clear medium copper with a huge head and good lace. Smell is malty with hints of vanilla, raisin and maple. a bit nutty. Taste is just like the smell but with some hop bitterness that hits last. Fairly well balanced. Finishes a bit heavy and dry. Good drinkability. A good brew, but could be better. It another example of Sam Adams trying to appeal to much the masses insted of producing a finer beer that only those who truly appreciate would enjoy. Although that is what buisness is all about, right?"
"It wasn't until the third bottle, after my taste buds had been taken hostage, that I was able to appreciate this beer. Upon the first sip, I didn't really find it all that engaging. Maybe I expected too much from this contract brewer, but Winter Lager's presence still seems a little onerous. It's got a great appearance and a heavenly smell, but once it hits the tongue, it's sticky and hollowly bitter. The alcoholic notes impel me to call this a good beer despite its shortcomings, but as a seasonal I can't say this is something I'll look forward to every winter."
"This might be my favorite Sammy brew. Had this in a 25 oz. mug. Wow, I didn't realize how hard this one can hit you. Copper with a small white sticky head. The coloring of this one is great - perhaps because of the clarity. Aroma is sweet with caramel, some orange peel. Slightly alcoholic, with just a hint of wintery spices. This beer is extremely smooth. Medium to full-bodied. Starts a little on the spicey side, and then moves to the sweetness and ends with a slight bit of hops. Really nice warming effect from this beer. The drinkability suffers on this one only because it is so unexpectedly strong."
"Amber, copper color, small white head. Smell is faint. Some ginger, some hops, some caramel malts, hint of citrus. Taste is thin, clean and mostly of caramel malts, touch of hops and a touch of ginger or citrus. Too subtle on the spices in my opinion. More robust in years past maybe [?]"
"amber reddish color with a farily decent white heead. cinnmon and orange along with a juicy malty aroma. smooth crisp tastewith nice malty finish. spices are very well balanced, not over powering. slight bit on cinnamon in the aftertaste. very good and drinkable winter beer."
"nice winter standard, possibly a ""conversion beer"". I know alot of people knock the BBC, but I do feel this is a delightful little concotion of thiers"
"oh yeah. for being nearly 7% abv, it is very smooth with little alcohol taste."
"Have drank this seasonal over the last few years on tap and in the bottle,went out last night and had this on tap.Pours a brownish amber with alight but somewhat sticky head,aroma is rich and malty.The flavor has a nice flavorful holiday spice to it its a nice rich tasting brew,this beer is served at alot of the big name bar and grilles wich is great compared to most of there other offerings.A beer with some nice spiced notes and is slightly warming."
"I may have sold this beer short in the past. this is damn good, especially for a lager. Worth a second look."
"This beer supposedly nears the 7% abv range, but it really doesn't seem all that strong to me. I only had one of these out of the sampler (my brother had the other one), so maybe a six-pack of this brew would help me distinguish more characteristics here. For a lager, it is more complex than your average dark brew, but this one would be even better if it were a bit more assertive in the aroma and flavor department."
"Drinkability: A good everyday winter brew. Has character and interesting notes, but not too heavy and sweet."
"Notes: A mixed bag for me; sweetness can be cloying if you're not in the mood for it."
"The Sam Adams Winter Lager is a beer that I look foreward to every year and this year's version is just as good as ever. The beer is a very pretty dark amber color and looks great when held up to a light. The smell is very malty with hints of cinnamon and some other spices. The taste, unlike the Old Fez, is a much more balanced beer with less emphasis on the spice and more emphasis on the balance. There are many different layers of this beer, from the cinnamon flavors to the hint of orange this is a very complex brew. Given all the spice flavors, this is a beer I could start out on but not one I could make a session out of."
"Super coppery color thats pretty deep and glowing, thin ivory head that fades fast, lace minimal but sticking in thin ink blot patches. Smell is more sweet then spicy, the spice seems citric like cinnamon and nutmeg mixed with pepper and orange peels, malty sweetness subdued overall with a burnt-like caramel. Not all that strong but interesting. Taste is all over the place, layers of different spicyness, including dried peppers, cinnamon, curried apples, orange peels, did someone mix the fruit salad with the salsa? Some malty sweetness of caramel lingers in the back trying desparately to keep things in check but lets go in quite a few areas. A mild but wild ride, nothing really stands out or is overwhelming. Feel is lighter then medium with a texture that didn't fit in the carbonation for me. Seems creamy, but the smoothness is all but lost due to the carb bite it tends to have mixed with the spices. Not something I'd have again really, but wouldn't turn it down if offered. Subtle but complex, but maybe trying a little to hard to stand out."
"Have to say i was dissapointed I have had this beer the last 5 winters ..it was always excellent..maybe its just my changed taste buds but i think the recipe has been ""tweeked"" for the worst ..my opinion only!"
"Appearance: Pours a ruby copper tone with a massive fluffy tan head leaving healthy amounts of dispersed lacing. Aroma: Nice shot of pine cone scented hops initially much better improved from last year's Winter lager, this is a rich malty lager nice caramel sweetness mixed with some bready dough like yeast notes and an undertow of spices. Taste: Full flavor syrupy rich nutty edge with hop bitterness not as dominant in flavor as the aromatic qualities with the bready finish characteristic of most Sam Adams products the spiciness bites at the palate nice winter lager, the BBC can still get it done when it wants to. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied slightly syrupy texture and a strong carbonation, does the palate good. Drinkability: Glad to see a lager around 7%abv this one can definitely be sipped on it's on tap at a local restaurant in Morgantown right now very tasty."
"this beer has a different label now, no more sam, wait hes on there, hes just a little sam now. i was excited to see this at the store since id never had it. it pours a deep copper that is very pleasing to the peepers. the smell of spices, ginger, cinnamon, basically everything delicious. it has the perfect balance of malt and hops (a tad bitter) with caramel, cinnamon and spice running all over the place. this stuff is delicious. nice medium bodied mouthfeel, not thin at all, a tad sticky in the mouth. this is an awesome beer, its not very expensive and it has a nice alcohol kick. goodtimes."
"Dark copper color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is spicy and sweet. Nicely malty, medium hopped. Slightly roasted malts, good flavor. Full taste, smooth flavor. Mostly malts in this beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter, some spiciness."
"Medium red-copper color beer with amber highlights. Topped by a thick cream colored head. It displays excellent retention and good lacing. The aroma is rather light, with just a touch of clove spices. The taste is rather sweet, with an interesting nutmeg flavor mixed in with the roasted malts. A nice caramel flavor comes through as well. Mild bittering on the finish leads to an herbal aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Drinkability is decent. Not a bad beer, but not all that exceptional either."
"Poured a crystal clear deep brown with a perfect compact head. The head seemed to last about a minute or two before receding to the sides of the glass for the remainder. The smell is very malty with a hint of cinnamon and orange/citrus. The first thing I noticed with my first taste was the explosion on my tongue. Sensory overload, courtesy of carbonation. The second sip was a bit more manageable, with a bit malt presence, subtle hops, and a bit of spicyness. Good for one glass, but I dunno about the second bottle..."
"This beer pours a clear brown-red color with a moderate tan clingy head. The mouthfeel is on the thin side of moderate. The smell is of malt with just a touch of allspice. The taste is mild spritzy malt with a slight clove and a slightly unpleasant sharp bitterness. This is a fairly drinkable winter lager but not by any stretch great. The odd bitterness seems to ruin it for me."
"This is a very nice beer. I was a little concerned when I picked up this bottle of a winter beer once spring had sprung, but apparently I've just gotten lucky. Poured out a very good looking dark amber with a nice ivory head that was creamy and longlasting. The lacing effect lasted down the glass. A nice malty, yeasty, bready aroma that increased with warmth. Full mouthfeel and a creamy sense. Alcohol noted in the flavor. Bits of hop bitterness jump on along the route and the finish is fairly dry. Some very faint hints of spice peek through and there is just a sense of crispness in the final finish. Well done Sam."
"Pours out a nice dark amber color. A nice looking head, eventually dimishes but never completely disappears. Tastes pretty malty, lots of spices mixed in there. The taste slightly reminds me of their double bock brew, but it could be just me. Great beer though, give it a shot."
"Pours a nice dark garnet color. A thick tan head gives way to a thick lace to the end of the beer. Aroma is malt and spices and a hint of dark fruits like plums come to mind. The taste is a roasted malt and small hint of the spices. This brew went down smooth and is very drinkable."
"I first tried this on tap, earlier this winter, and was disappointed. Right now, drinking from a bottle, in a Minnesota late March that still won't give up to a proper springtime, I can't find a fault with this tasty, delicious brew."
"Pours typical of Samuel Adams. The smell is sweet, with accents of yeast and wheat. This is a very malty brew, with a thick mouthfeel. Goes down smooth and pretty filling. I liked this although I don't know what a ""winter lager"" is. I think it supposed to be like an Oktoberfest with a heavy malt taste?"
"Not a bad brew, but I would like to see SA crank this beer up a notch. Really, it's pretty unique in my beer experience. I haven't had a lot of spiced, dark wheat lagers in the past."
"Decent, but far from a special weizenbock or winter brew."
"At the bottom of the Sammy collection...this is a beer that I would only drink one of, and is entirely forgettable."
"Notes. To me, this is what a winter lager should be, loved this beer--very complex."
"Loved this winter lager. Seemed like an ale though. Nice malt flavor with spices flavors that are just perfect for the holiday season. You can just pour you a glass and sit down and enjoy the evening. I can't find it now, but look forward to more next winter."
"I've never had this on-tap, so I was eager to try this when my local pub added it. The healthy off-white head sat nicely on this deep copper colored brew. A good amount of lace clung nicely to the glass for the whole pint. Caramel, hops, and malt were the three strongest smells. The taste was nicely spiced and sweet with just a touch of hops. At first touch to the tongue it is crisp and spicy, but finishes very smooth. Overall a fine warming winter brew that is not fabulous, but also should not disappoint."
"There was almost no head on this dark brown/chestnut/dark copper brew. The place I was in was a little smokey, and I'd had a few already, but there wasn't really much noticeable aroma -- a little bit of a sweet scent but nothing dramatic by any means -- pretty much par for the course for a lager without much head I suppose. It tasted fine but *felt* watered down -- not much body to it, certainly not very full at all. It had a nice caramel malt sweetness going, and it was a solid beer for what I paid -- $3.50 for a legit pint."
"OK...but I will not buy again."
"Tall head in the glass sits atop a light amber colored body. The trademark Sam Adams hop aroma is backed up by a nice mellow malt. The first sip brings forth a smooth body supporting a crisp caramel malt flavor and mellow hop spice. Very drinkable winter brew and one of the only guaranteed decent brews on tap in most an bar locally."
"This is by far my favorite Sam Adams offering and one I will look for every year. Overall, a very good wintertime lager. Seems to be one of those beers some really like while others just don't care for it."
"Not a bad brew. When I first got it, I wasnt too keen on the taste, but it grew on me after a while. It started out very bitter in the first few sips, but then mellowed out to something more enjoyable. The appearance was very nice too. It was a golden brown color with a good foamy head to it that lasted a little while. The aftertaste was wheaty and was actually good with an orange slice. I like to try things like that in my wheat beers."
"Good balance and full bodied without being heavy. Enough flavor to endure all evening."
"Finished with the spicy character lingering for a while and combined nicely with the ""warm, fuzzy feeling"" from the alcohol. A perfect beer for the season."
"Impressed with Boston Beer Co.'s overall lineup, I was excited to try this, my first Sam Adams seasonal. It poured an amber, mahogany color. A small head with good retention, active carbonation and tight lacing rounded out the beer's appearance. A sweet malt odor dominated the smell, accompanied by a hint of hops and indeterminate spices. The same malt presence was evident in the taste, along with the complementary hops and spices. It actually tasted like the Boston Lager loaded with choice spice and maybe a little more hop presence. The medium body fit the lager style and made for a decent mouthfeel. All around, this was a very enjoyable winter lager, and an excellent representative of the Sam Adams line."
"This is really quite a good beer. The best winter lager I've sampled. Nice amber color, clear with beige brown head that is very steady. Aroma is dark, rich, sweet malt that is close to molasses, and pushing cloyingly sweet, but, fortunately doesn't get there. Superb. Taste is a very rich sweet lager with dark roast flavor. Despite the richness one is able to take big drinks and enjoy a full flavor without being overwhelmed. Not necessarily a sipping beer. Spices are subtle. Medium fullness and carbonation feel without excessiveness. Overall a very nice winter brew. Even warms up very well for a lager."
"Seems like when I am out at a bar and they don't have much to offer I can usually fall back on this one. During the winter months, that is."
"Described on the label as ""rich, hearty and dark," this beer is, as one would expect, a bit underwhelming given its big-label origins. Nevertheless it is a not unsatisfying experience. Clear amber in color with a thin bubbly head. The aroma is sweet and sugary with something of a gingerbread character. The flavor is mildly fruity with a citric hop taste, with lots of malty sweetness and a understated (perhaps too understated) spicy character. Dry finish with a slightly sweet aftertaste, and a medium body. Heavier than the typical Sam Adams product, but a bit light on the warming effect, and not enough body to feel very _substantial_."
"A very tasty Winter offering from Sam Adams, I'll be sure to have a few more of these before Winter ends and they dissappear."
"Ruby red body topped by a big off-white foamy head of micro bubbles. Aroma is a lively blend of spices, including nutmeg and cloves, caramel and wheat malt, and perhaps some floral hops. Taste seems to indicate that the spices have been scaled back this year, to me a very good thing. The various malts roll in and down the throat, living the spices to battle it out with the hops in the aftertaste. I believe it's the best batch in several seasons for this beer, and I am quite pleased. Take the spices out altogether next year, and I'll be down right euphoric."
"In general, I'm not a huge fan of spice beer, even during the holidays, but this one seems to be well-balanced, subtle and successful."
"It's a spectacularly attractive beer. Thick, sticky head on top of a deep, dark, brown brew. Aroma is malty and spicy. There's a bit of citrus, maybe cinnamon, and a few fleeting smells that are hard to nail down. Supposedly a wheat lager, but I had trouble picking out the wheat tastes. Instead, there's countless layered flavors....sweet-ish and occasionally peppery....good hop balance. They've done a good job with his one: its interesting, drinkable, and available everywhere at this time of year."
"Beautiful in the glass. A rich amber with ruby highlights. Pours a decent, dense, quiet head with good retention. A bit spicy in the nose but not very aromatic. The taste is par for the course for a holiday brew. A bit of molasses and plums along with some subtle spices. Seems to be an attempt at a craft brew for the mainstream masses. Not bad at all, but the mass marketing of Sam Adams may affect my attitude."
"Nice beer, with a great color. dark copper.. Great mouthfeel, kind of sweetly ritch and malty. Seems very well balanced. Aftertast is not the best, but it is one of the better sam adams available around here."
"Oelergud - Cheers!"
"a re-review. clear deep amber color. huge off-white colored head that holds. lots of nice lace makes for a overall pretty looking brew. nice malty aroma, earthy hoppiness and spice. extreme creaminess makes for an amazing mouthfeel for a high ABV winter brew. rich maltiness balances well with slight spicy flavors (orange, chocolate and nutmeg come to mind). a slight spicy hop finish. all this goodness totally masks the 7% ABV. i was looking forward to re-reviewing this brew, thinking my first review was poor and my scores probably too high. well my first review WAS poor but i didn't ratchet down my lofty numbers a bit. an exceptional lager!"
"Nice big stiff creamy head over really dark amber body with golden highlights. The smell is little more than light sweet caramel malt. The flavor is surprisingly good for a lager. Very little of the typical lager flavor comes through, nice sandy caramel, lightly sweet. Good stuff."
"Pours a clear deep amber-copper color, small creamy off white head, malty spicy orange-cinnamon aroma, clean malty spicy flavors, nice lasting finish, great warming alcohol feel, medium-full body heavy but soft mouthfeel, very balanced, my favorite brew from Samuel Adams."
"Pours to an amber color with an off-white heat that quickly dissipates. The aromas are full of spices. Could be ginger and/or cinnamon. The roast malt aroma was also noted. The flavor was rich, with roasted malt, a hint of chocolate, and the mentioned spices. The hop bitterness was minimal. Overall, it was light-bodied, and smooth; a very drinkable beer."
"Taste is rich, creamy, malty, wheaty with a touch of prune/raisens etc and baking spices. Hop bitterness is kept fairly low, but are not absent. A bit sweet overall, but not even close to being over the top. The alcohol is completely hidden in the flavor. A really nice rich winter amber beer. I had one of these at Valley Forge park (on the sly of course) after walking my dog, looking out at the river when it was wicked cold out. Quite nice. Its hard to beat a hearty beer like this when you're freezing you ass off and loving every minute of it."
"Clear dark amber with a yellowish sturdy head of cottony foam. Laces in rings. A little caramel and spice in the aromatic profile. Creamy malt impression, tinged with a bit of allspice and maybe a touch of subtle molasses. Good hop balance, somes sense of candied citron rind and other slightly astringent flavors. This is a sturdy and flavorful Winter beer to my tastes, not overblown in concept or marketing, just well-crafted and pleasant in flavor. Judicious use of spices and high drinkability due to its medium body and creamy qualities. The best beer in the variety pack and one I would purchase again."
"Not all that complex, but I do like it. Reddish amber with a foamy head that quickly died down to nearly nothing. I am not picking up much spice in the aroma, but am picking up some roasted malts, alcohol, and some hops in the back. Mouthfeel is not quite smooth, with some carbonated bubbles, and the alcohol warms the back of the throat. I like the higher octane of this brew, and it isnt overpoweringly alcoholic in taste, but I think it might be taking over some of the flavor where some hops or spice flavor should be. All in all not a bad Winter seasonal, but not even close to some of the others I have tried this season."
"Copper colored with small head, nice lace. Spicy aroma with hint of bitterness. Tastes slightly hoppy bitter with enveloping mouthfeel. Somewhat hoppy and spicy with sweet malt and trace of cinamon. Full mouthfeel with sweet richness. Full flavored and very complex. Great cold weather brew."
"I don't drink too much lager anymore but I have always been curious about this one. Deep amber appearance and decent head retention. Lacing was pretty good with some nice ring like shapes. I didn't detect too much in the way of spices but then I didn't care. I really do not prefer overdone spicing. Mouthfeel was a little thin but the smooth taste and excellent drinkabilty, made this a brew I probably will try again."
"Re-review: I got a fresh bottle and what a difference. It looks pretty in the glass with the head forming out of a gradually rising level of beer. I don't quite the spicy aroma as others. The taste on a fresh bottle is a full point higher (3.5->4.5). Orange peels the dominant flavor. Very slight bitterness and a caramel aftertaste. No metallic taste or sourness. Make sure you get the the fresh Winter Classic packs - 2002 has the Sam Adams Light. I even paid $2 less for a 2002 vs. a year old one. Buyer beware."
"In past years I have gone through obscene amounts of this very good stuff, and look forward to each and every year when I can get my hands on it."
"Deep, burnished ochre under a light khaki head that leaves a maze of lace. Bouquet of chocolate pound cake and gingerbread cookies. Big and caramely malt spine coats your throat but is quelled by a nice earthy hop flavor. Smooth, spicy, balanced and seriously drinkable. A top notch Winter brew."
"Pour an dark amber-copper color, with a little bit of creamy tan head that leaves wispy rings of sticky lace. Sweet malt aroma with hints of spice - cinnamon and ginger. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. Nice toasted malt flavor, with some hints of carmel and dark chocolate. Spices are noticable, but not overpowering, with hints of gingerbread, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Finishes a bit dry with a long lasting spicy gingerbread flavor. Very drinkable and packs a punch that you do not notice or expect. Yummy!"
"Pours a medium to dark amber color with a nice cream colored head. Aroma is of sweet roasted malts with notes of cinnamon, ginger, orange peel, and caramel. All of the aromas come through in the taste as well as some notes of chocolate. It has a somewhat heavy mouth feel and a light hop bitterness. A very complex, and tasty, winter brew."
"2002 version. You can sort of think of Winter Lager as Old Fezziwig Light. It pours a dark reddish brown in the glass and maintains a thin off-white head. It has a nice malty aroma with a hint of caramel. The taste is all malt with a slight citrus quality in the dry finish. The ""winter spices"" are pretty muted. All in all a good dark lager but don't expect a winter warmer. The mouthfeel is too thin for that."
"Poured a deep ruby-brown with a light thick, foamy, off-white head that eventually rested at about a 1/4 and remained throughout consumption. Sweet aroma consisted of malt, spice, caramel and a pleasant fruit scent. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Midtones had a light orange peel taste to it. Spices are in there too, and add to the complex flavor of the beer. Malt finish with a slight caramel sweetness. An enjoyable, heart warming and complex winter lager. The nearly 7% abv can have a rather pleasing effect on a cold winter night."
"2003 Edition: as with the OF, this years versions are better than last years, so stock up!"
"Id recommend you trying one of these it really gets you in the mood for a cold winters night!"
"Also tasted the 2001 version (Purchase by April 02) on the same day: very dull !! Could only describe as a spicy malt character with no outstanding items."
"It is slightly crisp at first, but smooths out nicely. This ties in with the drinkability. Very smooth for a brew with such a high alcohol content. Enjoy!"
"A hard pour reveals a long lasting, loose-knit tan head, settling atop beautiful looking deep amber liquid, gently carbonated. Nice amount of maltiness in the nose with some toastiness as well as notes of spices...a bit of ginger perhaps? Taste is smooth, sweet at first, with some spiciness on the palate, giving away to maltiness. Finishes slightly dry & clean...a nice Winter warmer-type of brew."
"Tasty and exceptionally smooth for the ABV, but I was expecting something a little more sure of itself."
"Not as potent or strong of a 'christmas ale taste' as other brews such as anchor or sierra nevada.  That doesnt mean that it's not an excellent brew though.  Pours one of the prettiest heads I have yet to see in my beer drinking career.  It holds that head fairly well and leaves a heavy lace through the glass.  Carbonation is lots of big thick bubbles, leaving the drinker with a tingly feeling on their palate.   The body is medium/heavy, not really heavy but does have a substance to it.  This adds to its awesome mouthfeel.  Has a spicy cimmanon with a touch of cinnimanon scent to it; it is all in the tip of the nose.  Flavor is close to the same, sort of an apple/cinnimanon/various other spice tastes (im not good enough yet to recognize them yet though im trying).  A great winter brew that is very much worth trying."
"Pours a nice amber hue with a nice white head, solid malt flavor with spicy tones, a little bit of hops finish things.  A big favorite of mine, this beer certainly makes the arrival of winter a little bit easier!"
"Had on draught at Gameworks. Not sure if Sam is watering this down any now that they are trying to be more mainstream. Not very full-bodied, but flavorful with a nice spicy aftertaste. If I had to choose a larger-scale seasonal beer this would be it. If you can get your hands on Old Fezziwig I would try that instead and it is much more enjoyable."
"An attractive brew, this one pours a reddish-amber color with a bubbly, though short-lived head. Smell is big on the spices -- I sensed orange peel and other citrus, ginger and some hops. Taste was more of the same, with the central focus on spiciness. Notes of citrus were definitely detected here along with some maltiness. Mouthfeel was relatively smooth for a spice beer, and for a lager of nearly 7% ABV, this is one easy drinker. A solid, well-crafted brew that I will probably enjoy again."
"Notes: Spices are quite distinct, bold and adds another level of complexity to this brew, but without being overwhelming or artificial. Also has a nice warming effect that tends to sneak up on you. A pretty damn tasty winter beer."
"Clear light amber. Had a steady stream of carbonation pouring through it supporting 1/2 of white foam.  Leaves a beautiful lace on the glass.  Somewhat musty aroma of with a bit of toasted malt and ginger ... aroma is pretty subdued.  Flavor begins sweet with some fresh plum flavors... finishing with grain, carmel and some ginger as well... I can barely detect cinnamon... has a slightly metallic aftertaste.  Medium to full body with a smooth mouthfeel.  Very drinkable... a fine winter warmer."
"361"
"2002 edition. A dark amber brew with an off-white head. Head settles and leaves lace, but stays at about 1 cm, which is good enough for me. Sweet spiced aroma of caramel and ginger along with wheat and faint orange peel and hops. The spices combine with the sweetness really well and make the aroma great. Wheat dominates the flavor, making it crisp and refreshing, but alongside that is a caramel sweetness that lets you know that this is more than just a wheat beer. Cinnamon, ginger, and orange peel give a great wintery feel in the spice department. Earthy character from the wheat and the hop bite near the middle. Crisp wheat finish. Alcohol warms, again making this a great cold weather brew. A great beer to sit back with on a winter's night for a nightcap, or to pair with hearty foods at a winter feast. This review is based on my total experience from this beer, not just the sample from this year that I'm currently drinking. It does seem that this year's is not as rich as it has been in the past. However, I do still find it very enjoyable."
"Note: My taste bud's have matured and my beer exploration has expanded so much, that this beer is now merely average. This year, it seemed thin, watery and not flavorful at all. Some blend of spices, but overall mostly stale nutmeg and sourness dominate this one. Spices linger. Not nearly as good as the Shipyard Winter ale, which really the only one I have to compare it too. I will leave up both sets of notes, to show how my beer tastes have developed in the past two years."
"spicy winter brew with a little kick to it. goes down smooth and smells pretty good. this was pretty enjoyable. it works well as a winter beer. pours nice covered in foam. malty at the start followed by a delicious spicy hops kick."
"Brownish appearance with creamy froth.  Malty/spicy aroma, medium body, excellent malty/spicy flavor with hops in a supporting role.  Texture was thick and chewy like a winter lager should be but very drinkable.  One of my best experiences with spiced beer."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"Attractive ruby hue and excellent clarity.  The head is weak, but manages to leave a respectable lace.  The strong Hallertauer hop nose is followed by quite subtle and non descript spices.  Perhaps orange zest and nutmeg?  Moderate body and very slick mouthfeel. It almost has that ""oily"" mouthfeel that the Boston Lager has. The refined Hallertauer Mittelfruh hop flavor is quite high, but the hop bitterness is mild and thus imparts a significant sweetness to the brew.   Lots of caramelized sugars in flavor, perhaps from the prodigious use of crystal malt.  Mild nutmeg is present in flavor as well.  Winter Lager finishes sweet w/ lingering crystal malt sweentess.  Overall it's a very flavorful brew, but the sweetness borderlines on being cloying and thus hurts the drinkability."
"Nice brown color with a respectable light tan head. Faint spicy, clean aroma. Nice, slightly sweet malty taste, with just a hint of spice. Trace alcohol finish. I prefer a bit heavier brew in the winter, but on those occasions when I want something a bit lighter, this will do just fine."
"This is a pretty average beer in my opinion.   I definately like their other winter offering a lot better.  Old Fezziwig.  This beer just doesn't have anything that really stands out to me.  Wheat malt taste present with very slight hop bitterness."
"Amber, almost cranberry color. Sweet/Spice nose with hints of alcohol. Average head retention. Spicy with a slightly bitter finish. Overall, an above average dark lager."
"Note: It is not called Winter Lager here in Texas. Texas Law says that beer over 5% is an ale, but since this is a lagered beer, BBC labels the Texas version Winter Brew on the bottle even though the six pack holder still says ""Winter Lager"". Some more of Texas' own wacky beer laws!"
"Ive heard people say that Sams seasonals have been slightly off, but I think Sams getting back into their stride with the 2002/03 Winter (not that youll see much of it after January 1). Its got a deep ruby amber color, with an off white sticky head. Huge thick lace. The aroma is heavily malted, with spices and rich coffees. The taste, in this fresh batch is a little raw, with assertive malts, well balanced with spices and hops. This is a big/fast seller, and hard to get in Winter. Ive got to buy an extra twelve and forget about it because it should cellar very well. Wonderful!"
"i really liked this beer, had a really well rounded flavour, tasty to boot aswell, shame we don't get it round here."
"Another good one from ""Sammy""...I like ""Old fezz"" better but this is good in its own right..Light reddish copper appearance with a decent head...aroma is sweetish, but not as strong as ""Old Fezz""...tastes a bit like a Bock..but it says it is a wheat lager on the bottle...very easy drinking and tasty...an excellent winter beer.Not a real hoppy beer..definitely more on the malty side, and it really doesn't taste much like wheat to me.."
"Spice and sweet caramel aromas.  Head is sticky and endures.  Beautiful red copper color, clear.  Great malty sweetness offset by a unmistakable hops presense, also a hint of spice.  Absolute delightful mouthfeel, silky smooth.  Also very highly drinkable and worthy being termed a 'Winter' brew.  Almost 7%abv this one makes a cold night toasty warm."
"This reminds me alot of Boston Lager with a little more oomph.  A nice winter offering, slightly spicy, but just slightly with a nice taste of malt througout.  Good stuff."
"A dark wheat?  Really didn't strike me as having a lot of wheat characteristics.  I also didn't detect much spicing in the brew.  It has a nice, sturdy malt body with a mildly fruity undercurrent.  Pleasant, but not a lot of zip for a seasonal."
"The perfect beer for a snowy night."
"A full lager.  Smelled like a winter brew with all the spices wafting out of the glass.  Very malty with a touch hops at the end.  It took me a while to drink this beer, not because I did not like it, but because of it's rich flavor."
"Prosit!"
"A favorite of the SA brews. Excellent."
"An excellent beer with some slight fruity overtones."
