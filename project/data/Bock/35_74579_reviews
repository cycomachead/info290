"Slightly spicy and thick mouthfeel..it would be tough to get more than one down at a sitting."

"Too sweet for everyday consumption, but a tasty beverage nonetheless"

"O - Very enjoyable, would go good with steak or pork; I would purchase again if they continue to produce."
"O- the cinnamon and pepper are well balanced, leaving me wanting more with each sip, well done"

"Dark brown with both ruby and copper edges. The nose is mostly malty with slight chocolate undertones.  The flavor profile is mostly reminiscent of a mild bock with some faint chocolate notes and a hint of chili heat.  This is an enjoyable offering and works well as a little nightcap just before bed."

"Almost 3 years old. Deep onyx body, with a frothy chocolate head, it's more reminiscent of a stout, in appearance. Aroma is chocolatey, dark chocolate, with a touch of malt fruitiness, mild melanoidins, and a hint of chili. Dark chocolate dominates the flavor, with an almost dark cherry specialty malt fruitiness lingering into the finish. Somewhat fat in flavour, with rich malt sweetness that is not quite cloying."
""
"Overall a bit sweet/heavy for me. Something more safe and grounded on the palate would keep me coming back for more."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/17/2011. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, plum, chocolate, cocoa, molasses, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, biscuit, light coffee, cinnamon, herbal, light chile, clove, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, yeast ester, and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, prune, chocolate, cocoa, toast, molasses, biscuit, dark bread, light coffee, cinnamon, clove, light chile, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light cinnamon/chile spice with slight heat on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, plum, chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, light coffee, cinnamon, clove, light chile, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, spice, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a nice malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good spiced bock style. Good balance, robustness, and complexity of malt, spice, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall: Was fortunate to find a bottle of this laying around. When I picked it up, I was thinking that the pepper would be all gone. I was surprised to find that there was still decent heat especially in the aftertaste as the beer warmed. While I would have liked more heat, my problem with this beer is more the chocolate flavors that were ok, but far from the best I have had. It seems like the dark chocolate and milk chocolate do not mesh as well here as in other beers. Would love to try this one fresh, but in reading other reviews, the taste seems to hold up."
""
"O - I enjoyed this quite a bit, despite some flaws. Might be a shade too sweet, could have used a little more chilies, but overall a pretty decent beer that I would buy again when in the mood."
""
""
"Overall, I’m glad It didn’t my mouth or south end, but I wanted more out of a chili chocolate bock called the Vixen I was expecting some S & M maybe get slapped around a bit…it wouldn’t have hurt the balance glad to see this in a 12 ounce format as part of a lager mixed case I picked up in PA!"
""
""
"This is a tough beer to review because it tastes nothing like the description of the beer. Nothing about this says Bock and there is zero chili or heat. I get the chocolate and I get the nibs but that's about it. This comes across as a basic flavored ale. The aroma has hints of chocolate but nothing spicy."

" I’m not really a fan of the bock, but this is pretty good. Very drinkable at 8.5%. The chili and chocolate are very faint, but that’s not a bad thing. Very surprised with this beer. I’ve had some of the Imperial Series, and still don’t consider Sam Adams one of my favorites, but this one avoided the taste that seems to come with every other Sam Adams beer I’ve ever had. Not bashing on Sam Adams, either. It’s just that a few of their craft brews are not even close to standard. Overall, very good. I might just have to try some of the others of this series"

"Despite this pleasant lightness, I feel like the beer could be richer and more exciting overall. It's still pretty solid, but it doesn't really run with the potential it shows. It could use more of something: chilli, chocolate, goat? Whatever it needs, bring it in the next iteration please."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The sublte quality of the chili is what makes this beer so great in my opinion. The sharpness following the sweet chocolate makes The ""Vixen"" exactly that!"
""
""
""
"Better than I expected it would be. The first few sips were amazing before it settled down. A good warming brew for a chilly night. Definitely the best of the 4 beers from the SA Small Batch gift pack."
""
""
"Overall, a little disappointed. This is utterly forgettable. No complexity, bland all the way around."
""
"O - This is a good brew. Interesting take on a bock."
""
"O: I thought this was a really cool beer. I love chili chocolate to begin with so when I found this beer I had to try it. Of course, chocolate and beer, and chili and beer are a great mix so this takes advantage of both in one bottle."
""
"It’s an interesting idea with the chocolate and chilies."
""
""
""
""
"O - The Vixen is a nice bock if you're in the mood for something sweet and slightly spicy."
""
""
"Not bad, but not not really any better than the Polish Porters I can compare it to since it drinks more like a porter than a bock."
""
""
""
"I would have liked a little more heat being a chocolate CHILI bock but it is a pretty good chocolate Doppelbock and I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little disappointing. Too sweet with no heat balance. Comes off like a sweet milk stout."
""
""
"Overall: Excellent brew, reminded me of some of the real Aztec Chocolate drinks I had in the Carribean, not the sugar sweetened chocolate crap we have here in the states, but real spiced chocolate drinks that are not sweetened."
""
"O - A decent harmony with the beer and added ingredients. The cocoa nibs are the most prominent with the other declared spices taking a decidedly secondary role. The base bock is well done and it's probably the best 'chocolate beer' I've had from Boston Beer Company. For improvement though, I'd like to see more chili 'kick' as advertised."
""
"O: Didnt think I would get the chance to have this as it was 1 of 2 missing from my batch series collection. Now that I have had it, this beer was definitely worth the wait and the price."
""
""
"Its a bock, I get it ... just too damn sweet for my liking. Not enough chili pepper or chocolate to back this beer up. Played it very safe here."
""
"My first time having chili in a beer and it was pretty good. Not as much chocolate as I would have thought, but just the right amount of chili. I’d definitely have it again."
""
""
""
"O- Overall, not a bad beer from Sam Adams that is definitely worth a try."

"Pours a dark reddish brown with a creamy beige head. Not too dark to see its color in the light. Pretty nice looking, and the head sticks around for quite awhile. Aroma is a surprisingly mild. There's some light cocoa, caramel, chili pepper spice, a touch of cinnamon and some very light roast character. What's there is decent, but you have to look for it. The taste is better. There's more pepper flavor and mild but noticeable spice, and that spice blends well with the chocolate flavor. The chocolate is still just kinda sweet and boring. It's nice enough, but there are much more interesting chocolate chili beers around. Fairly clean finish. Some lingering caramel-chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It's a fine beer, but the flavors need to be refined and amped up. That said, I do think it's a big improvement on the normal SA Chocolate Bock."
""
"A solid, if simple beer. Pours black with a very short head, and no lacing. The chocolate and chili are pretty prominent in the nose, and there is a bit of vinous sourness as well. The taste is nice with well balanced flavors of rich chocolate and spicy chili- always a nice combination. Pretty well done. Smooth in the mouth and quite drinkable."
""
""
"M - Surprisingly bright medium/full body."
""
"O- Looking forward to having this again. This would be great in/with a nice bowl of chili on a cold day. Really glad I finally got around to trying this. A bargin at $3.50!!!"
"O - Not a bad beer, but the chocolate/cocoa really overpowers everything else. Probably wouldn't get this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
"C"
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Nicely done, the chili character is restrained while the chocolate is robust, which is a wise balance for a beer that contains these elements. Not as complex as some chili/chocolate imperial stouts that I have had, but it is flavorful and smooth so I guess it is what one would expect for a spiced Bock."
"Overall: I wanted more chili flavor out of this one. The base beer is smooth with nice chocolate notes. I was hoping for more with this one."
"As good a lager as I've had, very drinkable given all that's going on in the glass. A good selection from Sam Adams."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a very dark brown to black color with a brown head. The aroma has a lot of chocolate and roasted malt up front, with a touch of pepper mixed in. The flavor has the same components but in different ratios. I really like the way the peppers were done in this beer, adding some great flavor as well as a hint of heat in the throat. The chocolate also really stands out, with a hint of roasted malt. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"D - Very drinkable. The heat from the chilies is really nice with the cocoa and spices. Nicely balanced."
"Overall, I really wish they had done more with this. Great concept, somewhat lacking in follow-through."
"The dark brown color of the beer bordered on black, and the pour resulted in a large three finger thick head atop it. The smell was chocolate and red apples, and did not seem to give any indication of the spicing. The taste was good, but a little simpler than the ingredients hinted at. There was a some chocolate up front, followed by brown sugar and some salt, and ending with cinnamon. I really couldn't detect much chili presence other than a faint hint, which I would have easily missed if blind tasting. The body was a little thicker than a typical bock, but the spices made it less soothing. I was hoping it would be better than it was. Less than the sum of its parts."
""
""
""
""
"3.05/5: Y'know, I remember this one being better..."
"Final Thoughts: Very good beer. I enjoy the balance of deep flavor but keeping it flow with the body. This beer is what it says it is. It's got more earthy chili/cinnamon then I was expecting (was expecting a bit of a red hots cinnamon and cayenne heat chili) but it all flows. I would buy this again."
""
""
"A nice interesting beer. Goes down fairly easy considering the strength, and has a nice flavor profile. If you are looking for something out of the ordinary, or just a really nice beer, give this one a try."
"Saw a beer in a magazine about beer called the vixen... given the ingredient list of Chili cinnamon and cocoa nibs I knew I had to pict this one up. Samuel Adams has a history of making good chocolate bocks (the christmas one stands out). It doesn't have a thick head but it is an attractive tan. It smells of cocoa and cinnamon... The taste is intriguing.. The strongest tastes are the cocoa and the cinnamon but the finish definitely has the taste of chili. It gives the beer a rich taste that is surprisingly smooth and silky. I have to say this is definitely a nice surprise was almost I wouldn't find a bottle of this one."
""
"I guess I was looking for a little heat from chilii peppers, but it's not there. Still, the beer has a great mouthfeel, chocolate flavor and is a nice dessert brew."
""
""
""
"I say skip past this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good variation of style, this is exactly what you would expect from a Sam Adams bock-style beer with the added advertised attributes."
""
"Overall: A very solid version of a Bock. Nice robust malts and chocolate. The spices are subtle but noticeable enough to add a interesting kick."
""
""
"Overall: This drinks exactly like their Chocolate Bock, go figure. Luckily that was probably my favorite of their releases this winter. You get plenty of the chocolate flavors which are complemented by the roasted malts. Unfortunately the chili doesn’t shine through quite as much as I had hoped. Every time I see a beer that includes chili peppers (I’m looking at you Theobroma) I wish for some actual spice and a bit of heat to shine through. All around a great beer from Sam Adams. I’ll have to try a few more from this new line."
""
"DOA"
""
"O= Actually a decent beer from SA. I have been pretty unimpressed with this series so far and this one actually works pretty well. Not a bad beer. The flavors work but the bock portion is a little weak. Worth checking out."
""
""
"Taste is good. Lots of chocolate with a light hint of red chilies...chipotle-esque without the heat, a deft touch indeed. Very smooth, the carbonation is soft and light, which works well for the beer. ABV is very well hidden and the body is silky smooth while maintaining a light, bockish feel. This is my second bottle bought and wouldn’t mind having another some time down the road."
""
""
"O: a great bock, a nice surprise from Sam Adams and one I will buy more of."
""
""
"O: Pretty decent stuff. I enjoyed it more than Chocolate Bock. I'm not a huge fan of the whole chili beer concept, but this works. This would be a great beer to cook with too. I can see it in a nice chili con carne."
"The only beer of this sam adams limited release series that I enjoy. Wish the rest of them turned out like this."
"Notes: A conservative bock with interesting qualities. I will be buying another...couple."
""
""
"Overall, solid B...well crafted, and nicely executed. Thanks John!"

"Overall – not a bad tasting brew at all, but as it often happens with Sam Adams beers, it seems like they don’t stick their necks out quite far enough. It seems like this one is peters a little too much on the safe side. It could be brewed in a slightly more interesting way perhaps. Not at all a bad brew though."
""
""
"This beer has a dark black body with a 2"" tan color head, that lays down quickly. The smell is faint of chocolate with a little malt. The taste has a nice chocolate malt flavor up front, then a very light chili flavor on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is good and overall a good beer, i wanted a little more heat."
""
""
"O: Not a terribly impressive beer. The chocolate and chili are both lacking, which combined with a watery body and a strong licorice flavor make for a disappointment."
"O:Solid beer, just expected more heat and chili taste. The name, the dark look, and 8.5% made me expect a tongue bruiser. I do wish this beer would have lived up to it's name, mildly disappointed."
"22 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with tanned, long lasting, foamy head and soda like carbonation. Aroma is of bready malt, spices, some chocolate and cacao notes. The body is medium and smooth. Taste is toasted malt, caramel, cinnamon, pepper, sweet cacao and chocolate. Long, very spicy finish. Interesting brew but it is too sweet for me. Pepper provides a burning sensation but does not offset sweetness like hops do."
"O: Decent Bock – Sams Adams always has good beers but never great beers. This is a strong beer masked nicely by the malt and sweetness."
""
"O: Was really expecting more of the spices and chilies to come through, but then again its Sam Adams and they never go to the extreme and always like playing it safe."
"Overall a one-of-a-kind brew. Dark, rich, and enticing. Some serious heat from the chillies and the alcohol at the end. Not an easy drinker by any means, but unique and interesting flavor profile."
"Pours out a dark brown color, almost black, with a tan foam collar that doesn't leave any lacing but sticks around for an impressive amount of time. Smells mostly of bitter chocolate but a tiny amount of roasted character does also come through in the aroma. Flavor is mostly chocolate, but also has some dark fruits and cinnamon swimming around in a bock toasted malt. Finish is where the gentle warming of the chiles within shows up as a sort of indirect lip warming sensation and a tickling in the nasal passages. Texture is medium thick yet creamy. Overall, it comes across exactly as though they added chiles to their chocolate bock, not that this is a bad thing."
""
"Very dark coloured, slightly spicy aroma. The taste is of a rather basic bock, enhanced by a little heat, and lots of chocolate. As if the chocolate is to make up for the bock taste. Everything is OK by itself, but the characteristics are not well integrated. Decent drinkability. Medium mouthfeel."
"As beer warms and progresses, the chilis get to me. Heartburn alert. The remainder is dumped."
""
""
""
"Overall: Seems to be the Chocolate Bock given a boost and an addition of chilies, cinnamon, and love. I'm down for that."
""
""
"I'm glad I got to try this but I'm not sure I would have it again. The powdery characteristics in my opinion detracted from the overall balance and drinkability."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is dominated by chocolate. Taste is chocolate, some chili spicyness, very rich and flavorful. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer worth seeking out."
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black with red brown tones at the edges. Two finger fine to medium light tan head dissipates quickly to a film with lacing on the sides. Very faint aroma of dark malt and chocolate. Flavor is interesting, dark malt dominated by chocolate and a hint of vanilla The chilies appear in the finish and work quite nicely, making an interesting flavor progression. Medium bodied with a nice play between the chili and the carbonation for a peppery mouthfeel. I like this one quite a bit. Interesting ad tasty."
"D- This is fairly drinkable, but my expectations were such that I had trouble polishing it off as I expected. Great idea, but flavors need to be much bolder."
""

""

"O- Bad? No, but not what I was expecting. Glad to try it but won't buy again"

"Very interesting beer. Nice dark color good head. Very nice poor. The smell was a bit faint. I did pick up a bit of chocolate and a very slight hint of chili. The taste was good. Not what I was expecting but good. I was thinking more robust, but it was a very good blend of sweet and spicy, a but on the subtle side but over all good. From the complexity and verity of flavors the palate has its work cut out for it. Over all a little light on the taste but for what it is not bad at all."
"This one snuck up on me - I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Major kudos to Sam Adams for making such a unique/original/fun beer ... I expect this type of thing from DFH, not SA."
""
"O: A pretty good beer that just misses the mark of being rememberable."
""
""
"O-Chocolate Chili Bock...the name sounds so intriguing. It has so much potential. However, this was sure a let down. I know Samuel Adams every once in awhile pleases me but most often i'm disappointed so i shouldn't have got my hopes up for this either. they should basically just leave the word Chili out of the name, it adds nothing to the beer and is probably just used to trick people in to drinking it. over priced as well."
"Easy drinker for the ABV but was expecting more complexity and some spice. Disregarding the name, definitely true to the style and interestingly different. Just don't compare it with chili beers."
"Flavor is some sweet chocolate and a bit of roasted malt. I do get a little tingly warmth that could be chilli pepper, but no cinnamon anywhere. Hops and booze are also absent from the flavor profile. Flavor is not very robust in similar fashion to the nose. A decent beer, but I was hoping for more complex and bold flavors, this seems a little washed out and bland. An introductory chocolate/chilli beer? A little disappointed am I."
""
"Poured into a tumbler pint, the beer is an extremely dark ruby-brown coloring, with a thick, dense, frothy, milk-chocolate colored head that starts massively above the beer, but settles into a solid inch and a half. Good lacing along the glass as the head recedes. Aromas are subtle, with a bit of spiciness noted, as well as some roasted grain scents. The beer's flavors are a little more substantial, with a round palate of chocolate and toasted cereal blends, and a hint of pepper spicing. The body is light and slick, giving the flavors a short shelf-life on the palate. The aftertaste gives a bit more of the chili pepper essence, but only slightly, with a filmy linger of chocolate as well. The finish is somewhat clingy and filmy on the palate and all over the mouth. Clears away given a little bit of time. I was really hoping for a little more from this in terms of the flavor profiles, but it's not bad."
""
""
"Bomber from Total Beverage Wstminster poured a clear dark reddish brown with a lasting tan head. Aromas of cocoa, cinnamon,chilies, light vanilla and light earthiness. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth with a lightly warming finish. Flavors of cocoa, cinnamon, chilies, light carmel and light vanilla with a smooth lightly warming lingering cinnamon finish."
""
""
"A pretty interesting and balanced flavor profile. Not a huge fan of cinnamon in beer but I can see why they used it here and it is pretty good. I hope Sam Adams releases more specialty bombers because the first series was affordable and tasty."
"O: After the first couple sips this does tend to ease up and become easier to consume after the initial unique flavor shock, though would probably still be hesitant on ordering seconds. The chili is held in check compared to others by style ive experienced and has a bigger sweeter, caramel body then most as well. Nice chocolate roasted cocoa and chili mix provides for a unique combination, one you just have to experience for yourself. worthy of a try."
""
""
"Drinkability - Batch No 1, eh? Nice initial effort for the inaugural small batch series. A fine nightcap as winter is definitely here with sub-zero wind chills. Bundle up, drink a good brew, and stay warm. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel: Average mouthfeel but with a thick, burning aftertaste."
""
""
""
"O - This has some good drinkability. It goes down smooth, and it has a nice flavor to it. Overall, I thought this was a really enjoyable beer. The chocolate presence is really nice, but I wish there would have been some more chili presence in the taste. I recommend checking this one out, I would try it again."
""
"Overall: A flop. Flavors are almost there, but fall short in the long run. No depth and the vegetable aftertaste is distracting at best."
""
""
"Dark brown, nearly black beer with a thin tan head. It's an alluring beer...a unique smell. Spice, chocolate, and chili in its aroma. Malt, dark fruit (cherry?), and robust roast coffee. The flavor is also unique...chocolate and malt, with some spice. Not as much heat as I expected, but lots more flavor. Nice intensity of experience. Full in body, but I love the smell. This beer is well worth a try."
"overall - a good balance of sweet and savory."
""
""
"Black bodied beer with a decent crop of brown head. Lace is quite abundant. Aroma is light spice, biscuity malt and dusty chocolate. Flavor is very agreeable. Rich malty body with heavy, but not overdone, chocolate notes. Chili spiciness is an afterthought and spicing is light. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen. This is quite flavorful and very drinkable."
"Overall- Pretty good, better than the other Sam Adams chocolatey offerings I've had. The mild spicy aftershock cleanses the palate, masks the alcohol, and keeps it from getting too heavy. I have to dock them points for the brewing approach though; adding cocoa after the fact makes me feel like this a glorified malt-based yoohoo. At least they don't try to hide it."
""
"O: This is a pretty good beer. I would of liked more cinnamon and chili spice, but I am a guy who likes things hot. This beer has a lot of good flavor and it shows. I like this more than the Chocolate Bock, in which gives off a tart flavor. This is definitely a beer worth picking up and buying."
""
""
"O - If you like their Chocolate Bock you'll need to try it, this beer also won a medal at the GABF this year. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try a bottle but will pass on it after this glass."
"O: I wanted to like this, but really just couldn't. To me, this was like drinking a particularly large bottle of mole poblano. The chocolate and cinnamon aromas and flavors are overpowering, causing the caramel sweetness I typically associate with good bockbiers to take a backseat. If you really like chocolate and cinnamon, this may work for you, but for me, this was just too much."
"The chili flavor would have been more interesting if it were pair with the chocolate. Instead, this bock is like a chocolate soft drink that leaves a mild burning in the throat."
"I thought this was a barley wine when I opened it, not reading down the label. So that was pretty amusing on first gulp. Usual well-made product from BBC. It is not bad, just overly spiced and a very slow sipper. It's probably better with some flavorful food."
""
"Easy going beer that in true Samuel Adams style, despite the brewing ingredients, remains a subtle beer. Worse, even the subtlety gets lost after a while end up with a lightly chocolate bock. Most of all, the chili peel tannins are present throughout."
""
""
""
"Surprisingly good, it hits all the right notes and is a bit bigger than the typical bock in flavors and strength."
""
"D: This had a very pronounced chili flavor that mingled well with the bock characteristics. Nice scent and taste, with refreshingly light body. The alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink. If this ages as well as the regular Sam Adams Chocolate Bock, it should be a nice addition to the cellar. Not super exciting fresh, but a solid brew."
"O - The aroma of this beer didn't do much for me, but the flavor was quite nice. I think the chocolate, cocoa, and roasty flavors work well with the subtle chili finish. This beer is easy to drink and very smooth as well. It's certainly worthy to be a permanent offering, and probably my favorite thus far in this series of small batches."
""
"I liked this beer, but it seemed one of those instances where the sum of the parts might have gone in a bit different direction than anticipated. Much more stout-like than a bock, with the chocolate lending a significant density to the flavor without a direct chocolate flavor. I really did not pick up much in the way of chili spice or flavor, but there was something that seemed to lend a bit of brightness to the chocolate malt note - or perhaps it was just the power of suggestion."
"O- A good beer that I am glad that I tried. Wish the chili peppers were more noticeable, but still a solid beer. Nice balance and 8.5% ABV is very well hidden, worth the money. Definitely want to explore the rest of this series from Sam Adams."
"22oz bottle purchased at Market Basket in Portsmouth, batch #1. Pours a dark brown almost opaque body with slight brown highlights and less than a half inch of light tan head. Pepper and chocolate waft from the beer, though only lightly. Chocolate (cocoa nibs?), spice, and chili pepper comprise the flavor, though the chocolate and spice definitely balance the flavor. Medium in body and carbonation. The pepper becomes a bit more prominent as the beer warms, but the other flavors are still enough to balance it out. Unique and delightful."
""
"Drank some of this at a Christmas Eve party at my house with my cousin, my inlaw and myself. We drank The Vixen and a Rogue Chocolate Stout side by side. We realized it was 2 different styles, bock vs. stout, But it was strickly judged on flavor not style, presentation logo art or anything like that. Just 2 chocolate flavored beers. Guess what we all picked the ""The Vixen"" over the ""Rogue"". It taste more like a Porter than a Bock. Very complex mixture of flavors: Chocolate, caramel, mild cinamon notes, and faint roasted chili flavor(achiote maybe?). The chocolate flavor was a smooth dark chocolate not extreme bitter like the Rogue. Again both fine chocolate beers (that BTW go great with beef tamales and pasole!)"
""
"I'd like to try it on tap one of these days. Until then, only worth checking out if you want a variation on the chocolate bock."
""
"Good, but the lack of chili is mildly disappointing. Still, a good offering from the Boston Beer Company."
"Pours dark, almost black, with thick head. Probably the most head I've ever seen on a lager, but eventually thins to a lace. Smells chocolatey with lots of alcohol. Goes down very thick and smooth with a slight burning later in the back of the throat. Not sure if it the chili or alcohol. Overall this is an excellent beer. I've never been into chili beers much, but this one stands out."
"I'm very glad the chili is so subtle. I've only had a couple chili beers, but they've been heavy handed. I don't mind heat, but with beer it's a strange flavor combo I'm not into."
"Overall: A beer that I'd definitely try again, but would like to with some age to it to see how it tastes then. Despite the name, the chili is detectable, but not really spicy or anything, it's really subtle."
"Overall: A beer that I suppose you should try if you like more maltier(spelling) beers. Don't expect much heat, because there is none. For a darker beer it was good, but for the description...needs some updating."
"Overall, I liked this beer, and would buy it again. Nice winter warmer."
"Certainly, until that time, well worth trying."
"Overall Drinkability - Well balanced. Bold, interesting, and no major flaws. Slightly better flavor profiles and a bit more complexity and this beer would be pretty ace. Almost there, Sam!"
"Overall ""Damn why did I put this one in the back of the cooler for a week?"" Far tastier than I expected, Very recommended."
"bottle. Since there was no born on date or suggested freshness date, I am guessing you could age this one nicely and try in a year or so to see how the flavors develop."
"This stuff is black as night with a very solid tan head and lots of lacing. The aroma offers a sort of metallic charcoal malt. Pretty tame and nothing special. The taste buds pick up deep malt with sharp dark chocolate charcoal and a slight citrus hint. I don’t pick up any obvious chili but there may be a slight edge in there somewhere. It has an unusual, near minty quality. It’s clearly full bodied with a thick but managable feel. Carbonation is prickly stuff that cuts the thickness adequately to make this reasonably drinkable. These Sam Adams special brews are indeed, special."
"Overall: Great beer. Extremely unique. I will definitely try to find this one again."
"The feel is medium bodied and is pretty drinkable. It has pretty even feel and goes down easy."
"4.99 for the bomber was a nice price too; split this one with the missus and paired it up with some spicy pot roast as well."
"overall, i really liked this concoction. obviously i have nothing to compare it to, but within the bock/doppelbock style, it holds its own. i may not care to revisit this, but would definitley recommend for sampling."

"Dark chestnut colored with ruby highlights and an oatmeal colored head that slowly recedes. Aroma of cocoa and toasty malt. Rich flavor of cocoa, sea salt, woody notes, dried leaves, marshmallow. Moderate offsetting bitterness, subtle chili spice, not overpowering, would actually like more. Complex flavors, but just not that thrilling. Sort of vegetal, not sure where the saltiness comes from. Watery mouthfeel, could use more body for my tastes."
"O - I found the Vixen to be an interesting and unique beer. The chocolate and chili flavors are well-balanced and provide a unique dimension to a standard bock-type beer."
""
""
"Other than the late-arriving pepper, clean aftertaste, slight bitter. I did not get any metallic notes others have found. I'll buy a couple more bottles for sure."

"O: Very interesting beer, diverse flavor, I'm really enjoying the heat from the chili on the finish. Good beer overall, just very different."
"Good stuff. Would gladly try this one again. Could easily session this one too - since it strikes a nice balance with the chili rather than being too heavy handed with chili."
"Wouldn't try this one again"
"D: Overall, this is a good beer, but in typical Sam Adams fashion, they go halfway with it. Cool concept with lots potential, but still falls a little flat."
""
"Side note go pick up one of sams new beer !"
"O: If you're a fan of classic bock beer, then don't try this beer. Otherwise, it's an interesting, well made brew."
"A- pour produces a 2 finger light mocha colored head resting on a very deep brown colored body. Decent retention. Good lacing. 4 "
"B "
"Well done Samuel Adams. Nice winter sipper"

"Not bad, chili doesn't really come through."

"O - I recently tried the Chocolate Bock from Sam Adams. This beer has more chocolate flavor. The hint of pepper doesn't overwhelm the the beer but I don't know if it's quite enough."
"Delcious as an American-brewed (really) Double Bock, the beer is delicious in its simplistic recipe and the layering of chocolate, cinnamon, and chili peppers. But the base Bock beer is limited because of the use of one-dimensional caramel malts and the under development of malt character that would have otherwise created the savory bread, meaty, and brine character that make traditional German varieties so desirable."
""
"This is the best beer I've ever had by S.A. I'd drink it all winter."
"Would perhaps try it again."
"Otherwise pretty darn good, smooth, chocolatey, sticky tasting. If you like that sort of dessert beer, (especially if you like the SA Choco bock original) than you will like this."
"O- not a huge fan. Had huge expectations, but overall, this is worse than the Chocolate Bock"
""
""
"This brew poured out as a thick looking deep brown color. Nearly black to me. The head was creamy looking with a light tan color. The smell of the beer was lightly roasted with some minimal chocolate and malt aromas coming off of it. The taste of the beer I found to be really nice. There is a very subtle flavor from the Chili in there, so faint that it's nearly non existent. The chocolate notes come in to sweeten the beer a bit. The mouthfeel of the beer had a nice heavier body to it with a creamy smooth feel to it. Overall I found this brew to be rather enjoyable on most levels. The aroms was the only weakness I think."
"O-Would be a lot better if the spices were toned down a lot, still a decent beer."
"Perhaps with cellering this brew would come forward and actually be a Chocolate Chili Bock, but the one I am consuming now misses that mark."
""
""
"This beer is a nice shift from the standard Sam Adams brew. The appearance is nice and dark with a light brown foam. The pour is full and the foam and fades. The smell gets more of a chocolate aroma as the beer warms which is ok but it is not strong. There are also hints of malt in the aroma. The taste is good, malty, with a chocolate and slight sizzle of the chilis. The mouthfeel is full, maybe ""thickish"" with some carbonation completing the taste. Overall, this beer is nice and I believe it will go over well although for my taste I would like little less chocolate and maybe a touch of hops."
"Dark root beer body and a tan head. Light chocolate smell. Candy chocolate smell. Where is the chili on this? If it was a chocolate bock it would be okay. As a chocolate chile beer this is way off. Lacks in all departments. Not a bad tasting beer but just deliver as advertised."
""
""
"An interesting beer. It has an overabundance of chocolate in both aroma and flavor. Sadly it is lacking in the chili department. Sad because you can tell the beer had a lot of potential. Hides the alcohol well, not overly sweet. I think the beer would have been better if they had just left the chilis out and made a chocolate bock."
"Not a home run but pretty tasty and balanced (I guess it's better to err on the side of less chili). Drinks easy; wouldn't guess it was near 9 percent."
"Interesting overall, but after the recent experience of Stone's 11.11.11 Vertical Epic Ale, spicy chili cravings left this beer wanting for a bigger dose of heat, which could have even made it a more well-rounded brew, as it leans a bit on the sweet side still. In afterthought, the combination of flavors is actually reminiscent of a peaty Scotch ale, with a similar weight and sweetness combined with that touch of smokiness in the finish. It seems that with this beer the brewers at Boston Beer Co. may have actually created, not a masterpiece, but a hybrid beer more worthy of its own ""style"" than the failed stylistic creation that is Infinium."
""
""
"O: Despite my initial hesitancy with the soy profile, it's delicious once you get past it. Great winter beer; we had it before bed a few hours after our Thanksgiving meal and it seemed appropriate. With the chocolate notes, it's pretty nontraditional for a bock."
""
"O: The is chocolaty and smooth and goes down very easy."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer in reality is type sweet, NO it is not like ""Cherry Wheat"" or any Sam Adams fruit/sweet inspired beer I have had. Vixen has captured my heart, pours gently and digests perfectly. It is built for dark beer, flavor beer, and real beer drinkers alike. Tastes of alchol perfectly balanced with bitterness of the hops and chocolate make this a f'n homerun. Cheers to all and enjoy!"
"Overall I am glad to buy this one and it was actually worth the money since this was the most balanced chocolate chili beer I ever had. Buy it!"
"Overall I like this one a lot. I wasn't very impressed with the smell but the taste made up for it. Interesting balance of flavors and the chilis make it a little different."
""
""
""
"O: really astounded by this brew, loved the character depth in the taste and the mouthfeel, appearance was about on par for what i had hoped as was the scent"
""
"D: This beer doesn't taste like it's 8.5% ABV, as I can't get any alcohol flavor at all on the taste. It drinks very easily."
""
""
""
"O: While the chili flavor is almost nowhere to be seen the rest of the ingredients are nicely integrated. This is probably one of the better Bocks I've had although it may not be true to the original style. This is 3x better than their chocolate bock and I'd love to see this one on the shelves as a seasonal if not year round."
""
"Overall, it's heavier than you'd think for a bock--and it's got big flavors. I like it a lot--it's one of the better beers I've had in the past few months--maybe the best. But it's a lot to take in. At 22 ounces, this bottle is plenty on its own (which is fine, since it's got a $6 price-tag."
""
"Overall nice I could do one of these anytie. Good winter beer."
""
""
"Overall - Not bad, sort of a chili pepper spin on the classic chocolate bock. A little stronger and more malty then chocolate bock. Worth a drink if your are a fan, this is the trend at the momment, and sammy adams did a decent job."
"Paired excellent with the chili, very easy drinking as well, the first half was gone in 10 mins and second half went a bit slower. Not incredibly different from their regular Chocolate Bock, but the chili and cinnamon are well integrated, definitely worth trying."
"O: Overall very enjoyable. The chilies are a bit subtle, but I suppose that is probably a good thing. You can certainly feel the spice. A very interesting beer, and one I am glad that I tried."
"An imperial chocolate bock with spice this one works in many ways better but the spices are not it's friend. A very worthy beer no matter what that dark beer drinker thinks!"
"Aroma of sweet chocolaty malt. Color is deepest brown with very full deep beige head. head lasts and laces the glass wonderously! Taste is absolute heaven ! Flavors of Chocolate, cinnamon, sweet malt. Not hoppy. Chilies are more discerned by light heat rather than anything else. Excellent warmer on a cold rainy night! This is my first try of a beer with chilies in it, I hope this is typical!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice beer"
""
"O: I thought this was a pretty nice beer. The flavors are good. I'm not a fan of overly sweet beers, but I would drink one of these every once in a while if shared."
"22 oz. bottle pours a dark brown with some ruby highlights when held to the light.The aroma is chocolate, light caramel, Spice, and a hint of pepper. It has a nice thick tan head that lasts a minute or so before fading to a thick film that leaves behind a combination of webbing and rings for lacing on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with lots of milk chocolate. There are some faint spicy notes in the background. The finish is a mixture of caramel and light fruit/raisin with a slight hint of smoke. I did not taste any spicy heat initially, but about half way through the glass, I did get just a hint of a spicy burn in the back of my throat. As it warms, the alcohol starts to lightly come through. Medium-full bodied with light-moderate carbonation and a somewhat sticky mouthfeel."
""
"Probably won't pick this one up again... It wasn't bad but really a little sweet for me and not something I would revisit..."
""
"Beer is light in body and has a little bite to it, very nice, a little roasty for a bock but overall it is nice. Dry finish, decent bitterness from the chocolate, I like it. Decent, the chili could even be a bit more forward and I would enjoy it perhaps slightly more."
""
"EDIT: This is one of those situations where scoring doesn't really reflect how much I liked this. It seems pretty average based upon the numbers, but it's quite tasty."
"O: Another novelty bock much akin to SA Chocolate Bock, this 8.5% ABV flavored beer tries to do many things, but it succeeds at relatively few. Alone, it's a bastardized American bock that carries some sweet satisfaction. However, the chili niche is lost on me as well as the intended flavoring."
""
"Overall a very nice beer"
"Overall it's decent. Not terrible, but need Alot of work. Seriously lacking the chili all around."
"overall not a bad bock at all"
"O: I would liked more malt backbone in this."
""
"O: Not a bad effort, better than some I've had in the ""Latin Stout"" category. Wouldn't age it."
"The mouthfeel is light, especially for a beer with this amount of alcohol. I think it works for the delicacy of the flavors. The drinkability is very good, probably this brew's best aspect. Overall, an enjoyable beer that went down very easily. I don't regret buying a bomber, but I probably won't buy another."
""
""
"O- Not bad, but i would expect a little more chili to come through."
""
"O - very solid beer, but not an interesting one, the label is cool as hell though, and definitely worth having once"
""
"Talk about a beer not living up to its labeled promise. Not sure if want to try the other beers in this new series."
""
"This tastes like an interesting experiment. The chocolate works well, but the chili falls flat. I probably wouldn't mind, but it part of the name of this beer. I would drink this again, but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
"O: Not bad. The biggest surprises were the lack of any chili notes and the lightness of body. I detected the similar ""taste"" that I get from 95% of all SA beers have. That being said, the chocolate was definitely detectable and nice, and the mf was pleasing."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: When you compare this to say Hunaphu it gets ran over by a bus. The flavor could have been so much better but it just falls tremendously short. Fail Sam Adams Fail"
"Fully malty flavor, light roast and milk chocolate flavors, a bare hint of chili spice that leaves me wanting more unfortunately. On it's own, it's pretty good. Full bodied, rich and smooth feel. Toffee, chocolate, vegetal tobacco and ancho sweetness. Pretty easygoing, and deceptively smooth considering the higher abv. Pretty drinkable and not too spicy, just enough of a hint to make things interesting I guess."
""
""
"4.5 T: Initially, I was pissed since I was in the mood for a spicy treat. Though this didn't deliver on the heat, it turned out to be a pretty damn good beer once I got over my expectations. The nose is inexplicably weak and boring, but the taste is complex and well rounded and the mouthfeel is phenomenal. BA, you were wrong."
""
"Overall, not bad, drinkable, and pretty tasty. I wish the flavors stood out more as well as the nose."
""
"O: Very enjoyable, nicely done chocolate bock. I docked it a half point in the taste for having such a weak chili presence since that's included in the name."
""
"Pours a dark brown bordering black color, off white head. Aroma of roasted malts, some chocolate and mild mocha. In the taste, full on decadent chocolate upfront, with alittle roasted malt flavor. In the finish, the presence of chili's is noticed, but not overstated. Mild chocolate with a touch of spice. Draws some parallels to Mexican Mole sauce, and to this would be a fine pairing. Overall, an interesting brew, and worth the try."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Nice dark brown with cream colored foam. Not much lacing. Dissipates quickly to a ring. The smell is sweet roasty malt and caramel. No pepper. The taste is caramel, chocolate, dark malt and chili. The chili is towards the middle and end. Very nice addition to the flavor. No spiciness just pepper. Medium heavy mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Overall a good beer. I like the addition of the chili. Not everyone will like it but i do. Definitely worth a try."
"O - Nice effort from BBC and I enjoyed the beer. I'd consider trying some of the others based on this."
"O - Overall this is a great idea, but it falls short in aroma and flavor. A beer with this kind of name should be big and bold and showcase what it's all about."
"not really picking up any chili peppers, cinnamin, or cocoa nibs which this is claimed to be brewed with, but this is a solid bock regardless. not really something i would buy again, bocks really arent my favorite style, but its good to see sam adams stepping up and offering something for the true beer geeks."
"Pours a deep black with small tan head. Very little lacing. Smells like a little bit of roasted chocolate with heat in the back. Maybe a bit of earthy hops. Starts light bodied with a smooth and creamy roasted flavor. A bit of melted chocolate sauce with medium bitterness and citrus hops. A bit of a tingly finish. Mouthfeel is lighter than you'd expect from the nose. Easy drinking and quite nice. Probably ages well"
"Nose is best feature of this beer - a nice, infused chocolatey character with some miscellaneous notes that tease for identification. Appearance wasn't the usual Sam Adams, as the head didn't last long at all. Dark brown to light black colour. Palate has a nice chocolatey flavor with minimal chili presence. Good holiday beer."
"O - Overall not a bad Bock, but the chocolate dominated and the chili didn't live up to its billing. That's a shame, as there are few greater flavor matches exciting as chili and chocolate."
""
"O: this is very similar to the chocolate bock from the Winter Classics mix pack, it has increased strength which is well integrated in the brew, the addition of chili is lost a little bit. I hoped for a increased amount of heat."
""
"Rich aroma is malty with chocolate and yeasty overtones and smoky and molasses notes. It pours a dark opaque chocolate brown with a fairly thick light tan head that leaves some good lacing. Malty flavor has chocolate, coffee and molasses notes, plus a hint of caramel and a bit of a kick from the spice - tastes more like a stout than a bock. Smooth, fizzy texture has firm body and leaves a chocolaty and sassy finish. Vixen indeed!"
""
"M/O: Very filling and good bock flavor with a nice twist on the ingredients."
"Overall, while I admit that I wasn't looking forward to this beer--there were too many chances that it could have turned out an overpowered flavor mess--I'm quite surprised at the brew's deliciousness and drinkability. I would have expected something of this quality to come from Dogfish Head, so well crafted is the brew, and based solely on the strengths of The Vixen, am very much looking forward to Sam Adams' other offerings in this latest series. Highly recommended."
"WTF are the negative comments about in other reviews? This, in the end, is beer first, and all the other flavors second. Good balance, and it delivers on all flavors promised. I really liked this one, and will seek it out again before it disappears."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation levels and feels soft and slightly creamy on the palate. Overall, a decent brew. Would have like to see a bit more with the spices here. Honestly wasn't expecting too much, hence, not thatmuch of a disappointment here."
""
"Overall, I liked the nose a lot and the chili and spice does come through in the taste as I assume they were looking for. This is the second new Sam Adams beer I've had now that has had very low carbonation, which surprised me. A huge step down from new DIPA. 1 out of 2 is not bad so far. Still two more of these to try..."
""
""
"D/O I won’t have any problem finishing the bomber (for the sake of research of course) but this is one big beer and the relatively high ABV of 8.5% means that I would not be reaching for a second one of these. Overall this is a big, interesting, challenging beer whose many tastes compete for your attention and succeeds in nearly every way. Bravo! 3.5"
""
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention is OK, and there's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like chocolate, bready malt, dark fruit, molasses and a bit of coffee. I don't pick up any chilies in the aroma. There are some chilies noticeable in the taste, along with chocolate, dark fruit, cinnamon, and caramel malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and goes down easy with good carbonation. I think it's a decent beer overall, but if you're expecting a lot of chilies in this beer, you're going to be disappointed. But I still think it's worth trying, it's not bad at all."
""
""
"The Vixen is a good chocolate bock but needs a little improvement in the cloying piquant flavor."
"M&D - sharp and a bit biting on the palate, not sour, just a strong acid profile, roasted chocolate malts balance this acid sufficiently, but not enough to make this beer particularly inviting"
""
"Solid brew, good malt backbone. Decent accent flavors and insane smoothness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D-As this one warms up, it becomes a lot more drinkable. There's a harsh bitter note at the finish that really dissipates as it warms up to room temperature."
""
""
"Drinks as a bland, boozy, bock. I hope the other two released alongside this are better."
"The aroma was your classic malty bock. Nice sweet caramel and nutty aromas mixed in with a good earthy tone. The flavor followed through very closely with a nice bitter malty flavor and a good amount of sweetness in it as well. Carbonation that is more then decent never let it go flat and kept you entertained throughout the session."
""
"I am quite pleasantly surprised with this beer as I tried the griffins bow from this series and just did not like it. The only complaint I would have about this beer is that it is really more like a stout, however, I love stouts."
"O: Not a bad beer, but could have been excellent."
""
"I was so intrigued by anything and everything chili-fused in beer, especially if it's coupled with chocolate. Simply put, this falls short from what it's billed to be. The chocolate and bock qualities are there, albeit weak but the chilies are missing. Not a bad beer by any means, but nothing special at all."
""
"Overall: If they were going to do a chili chocolate beer, I wish they would have committed to it. Not bad, but common."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet chocolate and a spicy chili note. In the taste, cocoa sweetness and a nice mellow chili spice heat underneath. A spice like bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry cocoa and hint of chili in the aftertaste. I get it, mellow chili set off with big chocolate. Good, but just for one."
"I was really excited to try this one. Nothing exciting right off the pour, and the aroma was pretty mild. There was a hint of spice but really not a ton more than that. Nice and rich after the first sip, and a little surprisingly, the chili and chocolate were pretty mild and on the back end. Still detectable, but not overwhelming. I would've liked those flavors to pop a little more, but still, pretty good beer overall."
"Overall: this beer is a slow sipper but full of flavor. As a fan of SA Double Bock, this one to me is just as good in a different way. I like this one a lot."
"O- impressed. Warming and full of flavor, BBC created a brew that I will boast about and come back to"
"Poured into a .5 liter stein a deep mahogany with a thinner off white head atop that lasted well,dark fruit and light chocolate in the nose,dark fruit dominated with that chocolate being somewhat light.Sweet dark fruit and molasses flavors,the chili is very light in the finish,it doesnt really play a role.Its not a bad bock but the chili and chocolate play minor roles in the beer."
"Sam does offer something interesting with this beer. It has a nice mix of flavors, and the heat works well. Though a solid beer, it is not amazing (which is the normal complaint against Sam). The beer seems slightly off balance in the amount of bitterness (this does improve as the beer warms), and the body seems a bit light. These flaws keep it from being an amazing beer in my eyes. However, I am not mad that I spent the money. In this world of rare, limited, and expensive brews, it isn't such a bad thing to find an experiment that is solid rather than a disaster. I would be interested in trying this again with a year or two of age."
"Overall: As always, a beer with a world class mouthfeel is going to be treated kindly by me. This beer has great flavors, deft use of spices, and a great price. Since drinking it two days ago, I've bought more."
"Creamy mouthfeel but a medium body that seems light and falls apart over the tongue. Glad I tried it, but it could use a little more punch."
"O- This was a lot better when the brought it to the EBF, not so much now."
"Overall not impressed. Not very much chili, chocolate, or bock going on here."
"O - Beer is okay. Really wouldnt buy it again, way to sweet to be a good bock."
"This beer pours almost black with a finger tall just off white head that recedes to a thin film. Little to no lacing. Aroma is nice. Cocoa forward with a hint of caramel sweetness. Flavor is similar with A bit of chili heat which complements the coco really well. A but of sweetness. Very nice. Good carb and good mouthfeel. Very nice surprise."
"This one sounded like the most promising of the new batch of SA bombers, so hopes are high right now. It pours a clear dark ruby-brown topped by a finger of cream-tan foam. Dammit, bocks are just a generally attractive-looking style, ain't they? The nose comprises cocoa, light roasted malts, very light coffee, and, with some deep sniffs (induced by the name, admittedly), some light and very mild peppers. The taste follows pretty closely, though now the pepper are a bit more pronounced: they're mostly there for flavor, with very little heat actually coming through. Imagine a very mild mole, and this would come close to that image. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a silky feel, and a finish that leans toward the dry. Overall, a very tasty brew that combines the chocolate, bock, and pepper elements very well. Good times."
"O - a unique tasting bock that's worth a try."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a dark mahogany, with a nice two inch sticky head, we have lacing, I repeat tons of beautiful lacing. Smell chocolate, dark fruits, burnt coffee, and a hint of spicy pepper. Taste is all that, just the slightest bit of spice in the finish. Body is big, but very approachable for the abv. Perfect carbonation. I am so surprised how much I like this beer. The only other beer with peppers I have had, was Rogues and not even close to good. Don't judge a book by the cover. Very nice brew."
"o - Overall a pretty nice bock. I liked the nose a lot and the chili and spice does come through in the taste as I assume they were looking for. This is the second new Sam Adams beer I've had now that has had very low carbonation, which surprised me. Worth checking out."
"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights when held to light, huge tan head shows great retention and moderate lace. Smells mostly of chocolate and alcohol with faint hints of caramel, licorice and a faint spicy earthy tone. I would never guess form the aroma there were chili's in here. Taste is moderately malty and sweet. Lots of chocolate and caramel flavors up front. Slight melanoid and toffee type flavors midway with a warming earthy spice that lingers long into the finish. Medium to thick body, moderate level of carbonation, sweet sticky chocolate mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this brew. The chocolate is there, the bock is there, the peppers provide some nice flavors and subtle heat. Great Job Sam Adams."
"O: An interesting take on their regular chocolate bock. The chilis don't come out too much, even as it warms. The chocolate is a bit subdued compared to the regular, though. A bit more mellow, even with the higher abv. I like it"
"Poured a 2"" chocolate malt hued head with pretty good lasting power. Body is dark as coffee. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is high on cocoa, roasted malts, and coffee. I was surprised the chili was so understated. It sort of built as a subtle burn the further I got through it. All in all this is a very tasty dessert-style beer, but I guess I expected more chili since it's on the label."
"This beer reminded me of twizzlers. As soon as I poured it and even tasted it. It reminded me of the one candy that I hated. I usually like every beer I try and give it at least an average rating, but this beer just grossed me out because it reminded me of a licorice flavor. I expected a more chocolaty taste with a bigger burn at the end. I would have loved a stronger chocolate taste and more burn, but no it just gave me a sick feeling like I just ate a pack of licorice. My buddy loved it. I believe a lot of people would love it, but me myself I will never buy it again."
"Overall not bad, light but I wouldn't expect SA to go crazy as they have a huge med taste fan base."
"Smooth and rich, very dark appearance with a thin tan laced head. Roasted malt, cocoa nibs with a sweet chocolate spicey aftertaste. There is a slight peppery warmth to it when the beer is warmed and sitting for a while. You get more of it when it is warmer rather than straight out of the cooler. A pretty unique, intriguing beer. I love anything different than the norm, and this was a decent attempt at it."
"Like most Sam Adams beers the taste and aroma are dead on, they're just not strong enough. I had hoped the the small batch series would be different but I guess you can't teach old brewers new tricks."
"Pours near-black with reddish highlights, thin cap of khaki froth, gone quickly. Scent is muted and gives off notes of cocoa powder, roasted malt, faint spice and faint dark fruit. Taste leads with a chocolate milk like taste, faint woodsy spicing and faint hint at fruit... not getting the chili. Beer is fuller side of medium body, smooth and uber dry (like sucking on a piece of lumber). Decent beer, a touch dry and lacking in complexity."
"o - a pretty solid beer all around. i quite enjoyed this one. probably couldn't drink more than a bomber at a time though. worth seeking out in my opinion."
"Pours a one-fingered light tan head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Black with faint ruby highlights. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light chocolate nose and flavor is almost sweet chocolate with cinnamon, no chili. $5.99 for a 22oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Wow, very happy to see this one come from Sam Adams. A great interesting brew here. This brew is very good tasting, full bodied and full of great character. A great spin on the style. Great stuff here."
"A decent bock. Appropriate chocolate flavor and subtle spice. Could use a touch more heat from the peppers."
"Poured into a Victory tulip with an average head, khacki in color that leaves a nice receding lacing on the glass. Dark garnet liquid with an undistinguished nose. Nice smooth mouthfeel with notes of cinnamon and bitter chocolate...the chili isn't really noticable at all. Nice bitter finish, hoppy/chocolatey. Nice but I expected just a bit more from this one."
"O: I was a little nervous about this beer. The label made it sound like there was a lot going on, maybe too much, but damn, this is another surprise from SA. I had their DIPA yesterday and was really impressed with that and now another one that just doesn't fit the SA blueprint. Complex and rather tasty. Smooth and drinkable."
"O: I was surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. I liked it enough to grab a few more bottles the next day, with hopes of making it through the holidays. This is the most interesting and flavorful beer I've had from Sam Adams yet."
"I like it. don't love it. the 8.5% isn't detectable, which is good, but this is a ""safe"" chili beer. I love that they are mixing things up, and this could be great with a bit more cocoa/chili flavors to make it stand out a bit more."
"Overall not a bad beer at all and good to see some different stuff from sam adams."
"Definitely worth the pick up at $6. Recommended to chili beer fans or to anyone who has a bad experience with chili beers. This one pulls it off."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer for the price. I really wish the chili heat and the cocoa nibs played a bigger part though. I probably won't buy again, but it wasn't a bad purchase."
"4/4/3/5/4.5/3.5"
"Good time, Cheers."
"O: pretty different, glad to see Sam Adams branching out a bit more. So far the Tasman is my favorite in the bunch."
