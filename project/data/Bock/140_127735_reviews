"3.59/5.00"
"An interesting beer.  One can is plenty as it's so rich.  Well brewed."
""
"I Crack!ed this bad boy open and oh, how I wanted to CANduct an inverted Glug, but I CANstrained myself due to its relative age. I still got a little better than a skim of tawny head, but the bartender's trick is mt best friend of late and this created a brief finger of tawny head before falling back and leaving nice lacing in its wake. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "
""
""
"Overall this Oskar Blues inspired brew is quite good just nothing to brag about."

"This is definitely confused, but DELICIOUS.  Rye bock? Bock? No. Rye? ABSOLUTELY!  This seems more analogous to something like the August Schell Emerald Rye lager than a Rye bock.  A definite miss on the style, but an absolute winner for any fan of rye!"
""
"There are a lot of competing flavors here, and it mostly works. I probably wouldn't have guessed this was a bock, if I didn't know what I was drinking, because the bock flavors are overshadowed by the unique combination of hops, rye, and wheat. It's interesting."

"12/3...BCAA 11/12...pours bright copper orange, heavy high white foam. Very sticky lots of lacing. Bright floral nose with rye background. Taste is very different - tangy wheat with peppers. Bright hoppy taste with rye blended throughout. Clever."
"O - An awesome brew.  Well done Sierra/Oskar Blues"

"Citrus nose and taste dominates. A slight sense of cherries back there too. Mind aftertaste. Very pleasant."
""
""
"Very nice and smooth Rye Bock, has some real nice rye flavors without being too overpowering. Very smooth and easy to drink~"
""
""
""
""
""
"An easy drinking beer that I would buy a six pack of easily. Surprised how much the hop character shines through even after all this time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is slick, with a medium body, mild carbonation and an easy flow as it goes down. A really good bock and a fine collaboration, this was full of flavor and hoppier than most bocks."
""
"Orange body with a small tan head. Hops, alcohol, pine, fruit aroma. Citrus and alcohol with a malty body. Mild sweetness and a mix of sweet and bitter notes in the finish. Quite hoppy for a bock style beer. Interesting."
""
""
""
"Enjoyable."
""
""
"Pretty big disappointment actually resulted in a drain pour."
""
"Dark orange, semi-hazy with a nice one inch head. Faded after a couple minutes to about a quarter inch, nice lacing. Aroma was sweet, with a bit of honey, wheat and some peppery rye notes. Taste was similar to the smell, with a bit of tropical fruit flavors as well. This was somewhat similar to the Yonder Bock, with the addition of the peppery bite from the rye. The mouthfeel was very creamy and smooth, quite nice. Quite tasty, I'd buy this one again."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a Bock. The rye spice and fruit notes add a nice kick."
""
""
""
""
"A slightly above average beer - about par for the course for the Beer Camp series."
"O=Bocks are usually available in the spring, but this summer offering would likely pair well with barbecue chicken or pork or another slightly spicy or smoky meal.  I enjoyed this and would consider purchasing for cooler spring nights if available again."
"3.88 | 87 | B+"
"O- This one is nice. The rye character isn't the most noticeable, but I think it does a great part in the body for crisping up what is usually a sweeter style."
"Overall a complex and tasty one off beer.  Much better than I expected."
""
""
""
""
"o: A very flavorful bock, as expected given the name.  An interesting member of the BCAA series, easy drinking and pleasant."
""

""

"Flavor is rich and malty with some rye and light fruity notes.  I do get a bit of drying on the finish and a peppery bite too.  The beer drinks very easy and I am done with the can much faster than I anticipated when I opened the can."
"Pours redish brown with a thick white head. Flavors of rye and wheat are heavy throughout. Super balanced. Would totally drink again."
""
""
""
""
"12 oz can. Pours a copper orange with a long lasting medium beige head. some lacing. Aroma of rye and grains fill the nose along with some fruity notes, yeast some bread notes as well. Taste same as aroma with so mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body, smooth with mild carbonation. Finish is sweet rye and grains, some yeast and barley, fruity and slight rye nutty ending. Overall a good drinking brew."
"The beer has a definite rye nose wrapped in earthy woodsy hops. It’s brilliant chestnut with an off-white foam cap. A very creamy palate features rye body and spiciness. The beer has a very nice balance between the barley malt and the rye with a big bitter hop finish. The beer has a medium full body and medium to medium low carbonation."
""
""
"This a nice hoppy brew for the style that did have the bock yeast strain base taste."
""
""
"The last  of the 12-pack I grabbed at Tipples a while back now.  Pours deep reddish orange with a fluffy off white head.  Very nice looking.  Aroma of light rye spice, dark fruits, and a bit of hoppy grass balance.  Flavor is a big malt bomb, deep dark fruits, candi sugar.  Just kind of a big malt bomb here without much else going on.  Medium plus bodied with medium low carbonation.   This was a good bit uninspiring and not something I want to drink again."
""
"Copper colored, clear. Thin white head, decent lacing and head retention.   Aroma is earthy, herbal.  Taste is malty, a bit sweet. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I think I enjoyed this beer more on draft mote than the can.  I would still drink it again though."
""

""

""

"O-There is nothing bad to this beer, just that there is nothing good to this beer."
""
""

"Solid, but nothing overly memorable. Definitely more rye than bock."
""
""
""
"There are sips of this beer that I find to be good and some sips that just seem to not really come together all that well, probably more of the latter. I like the elements that make it up but the final flavor just doesn't work out for me. The rye's spice and sweets clash sometimes with the citrus which clashes with the apple and grape fruit flavors present. Not bad by any means but I don't think the vision results in a balanced final product."
""
"This is honestly a solid beer, everything about it is fruity. The hops and the malt are great together and reminds me of a cigar city IPA. Not sure why this isn't rated higher"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Unlike any other bock I have had by a long shot, and I really enjoyed the interplay between the fruity hops, sweet malts, and spicy rye. Would definitely buy again if sold in singles."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was pretty terrible"
""
""
""
"I guess I do like lagers. Best beer I have had out of a can period."
""
""
""
""
""
"Its an amber brew w/ a fairly thick head. Smells slightly sweet & fruity. The flavor starts off malty but finishes with a punch of hops. Very interesting bock. Solid brew but I would put the Beer Camp Cigar City Tropical Maibock above this offering."
""
"O: One of my favorites out of this case. Very well done and tasty brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a  two finger light khaki head with good retention and lots of lacing. Nice aroma of caramel malt, light tropical fruit and rye. Flavor of bready and caramel malt with a hint of biscuit, citrus juice and an assertive dose of tart rye, grassy hops. Medium bodied with peppery carbonation. An interesting hybrid of bock and hopped rye. There is moderate bock style malt flavors here, but they are pushed into the background by the peppery hops and semi-tart rye flavors, which combine very nicely. Certainly not a traditional bock, but an interesting and tasty variant of rye ales. I liked this quite a bit."
"Mouthfeel is lightly sweet and full throughout the mouth, then drying,  leading to believe that there area some stronger hop undertones"

"A rye bock???  Consider my curiosity aroused...  A fairly active pour yields a large voluminous two plus fingers worthy of crisp frothy light khaki colored head comprised of mostly large chunky bubbles...  Excellent retention...  The color is a chameleon light mix of light gold and dark copper that changes based upon the lighting...  A moderate bit of exceedingly small bubbled carbonation rises sluggishly throughout...  The nose is kind of hard to place...  A mix of toasted malt and overly ripened fruits...  Some light caramel notes as well...  Toffee...  Some light brown sugar...  Perhaps just the faintest hint of rye...  Quite tasty...  Stays true to the aroma...  There may be the addition of some faint semi sweet chocolate...  No standouts, just great harmony amongst the various flavors...  Goes down easily sip after sip...  Uber quaffable...  I can't quite place my finger on it as there is nothing earth shattering about this beer, it's just really solid and highly enjoyable in every facet...  All the components work well together to yield something that is much more than the sum of its parts...  A terrific job by Sierra Nevada and Oskar Blues...  This would be  staple on my rotation if readily available and year round...  Hands down the best of the Beer Camp Across America collection that I've tried..."

"O: complex flavors; interesting;"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good collab effort where the base beer is still recognizable and what's added to make it different works."
""
"O:  I would rate this one #5 of the 12 box series.  Pretty decent.  Rye always perks things up."
""
""
""

""

"Love my Ryes and Reds and this one was right up there with some of the better ryes I've had. Excellent job."
""
""
"D:  A very crushable lager.  Not my favorite of the pack but this is very nicely balanced and has some great Rye malt flavor in unison with some nice hop action.  Another lovely CANtribution to the BeerCamp Collab pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  An interesting cross-over style; sure, it has some bock elements but there is a lot more to this beer; those looking for a traditional bock will likely be disappointed but I rather enjoyed it"
""
"Overall a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall OK but the combination of all the various flavors on the finish really come together for a bleh flavor, almost BBQ sauce like but not quite tehre, the sweet syrupy notes with biscuit toffee, fruity flavors from rye and hops, mild bitterness, and earthy hop notes bring this together for the bleh. Otherwise not a bad beer, but the bock aspect gets overpowered, and the rye is not that great either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is dry at first with toasted grainy flavor with slihgtly fruity yeast with mild pine flavor from the hops and slight caramel sweetness supporting the bitterness well. There is a slight earthiness of rye with almost molasses like accent and dark syrup roundness with woody flavor and light citrus accent coming through toward the finish wiht semi-dry element with nice hop bitterness lingering as it is fairly clean in the finish. Overall this is a very good bock with nice balance and depth of flavor -very drinkable for the strength"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of light spicy rye notes with some citrus and earthy hoppy notes also noticeable. Taste is dominated by light dry spicy rye notes with some citrus and earthy hops that are easily noticeable with a medium bitter finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Another easy to drink beer from this series."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very crisp and a bit dry. Easy to drink and full of flavor."
""
"Taste is both smooth and malty, with a citrus and tropical fruit hops followthrough. I get both a sharp rye malt bill and plenty of hops. Lovely, tasty, and very balanced!"
""
""
"Smell is heavy malt, caramel, brown sugar, lots of rye, floral hops, hay and straw.  The flavor is a little dough, rye, and malt, caramel, mixed with the brightness of citrus hops and a grapefruit finish.  Overall, this is pretty good, another favorite of the Beer Camp collabs."
""
""
""
"Taste is a home run. As a huge fan of bocks and rye brews, this is a dream brew for me. the flavor is full and rich, syrupy without being overbearing.  Grapes, rye, grain, candied sugar, toasted malt...caramel. Really nice. With only 3 beers left in the set to try, this is definitely one of the highlights for me."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass with a big white head.  See through copper color with small amount of bubbles.  Sweet malty hoppy smell.  Hoppy sweet taste with a good toast malt backbone and slight amount of rye spice.  Pretty smooth creamy beer but could use a little more carbonation.  Overall this is fantastic and the only thing I think it needs it a little more carbonation"
""
"Overall: Very hoppy for a bock which cuts some of the desired malt character I look for.  Even for a Maibock this one pushes it too far.  I think I would like the balance better if this was an ale and not a lager.  Finish is fairly astringent.  Interesting but not amazing.  The rye really is highlighted though."
""
""
"Nose of piney hops with warming, bit muddled cold, rye is evident.  Taste is lightly sweet with coarse caramel notes and some spice.  Feel is neutral though a bit sweet and seems a bit unispired though that doesn't surprise me given my experience with Oskar Blues.  Coarse feel and finish, drinkable yet bock doesn't come to mind as much as amber lager does, and that diminishes with warming.  Update: finish is sweet and malty with just too much caramel and not enough of clean Bock sense.  In fact not bock like at all...Just too syrupy overall..."

"Overall, not the best beer IMO.  Seems it is having a bit of an identity crisis.  Not quite sure what they were going for but this is a miss."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From the Beer Camp 12 pack. Excellent creamy head and lace. Nice fruity hops, with a medium bitter finish. Lots of malt and spicy rye flavors. They should make this stuff regularly. I would buy it."
""
""
""
"O.  Very, Very good Rye bock."

"Goes down pretty smooth considering the ABV.  Not a horrible drinking experience.  I just got no idea what they were going for."
"Some slightly fruity notes that remind me of fruity pebbles. getting some rye in the finish, but that is about it. a little bit of booze towards the finish as well. not getting a ton of bock-like cleanness that I desire. drinkable, but definitely not my favorite from this variety pack."
""
""
"Overall:  Very cool, unique beer I thoroughly enjoyed drinking and contemplating."
""
"Smells of spicy rye and citrusy hops. Great interplay between the hops and rye malt. Taste is more of the same, but with a nice twist in the finish. Begins with a bready sweet malt flavor that gives way to the spicy rye and citrus hops. The finish has a nice and surprising tropical tooth fruity type finish. Really surprised me on the first taste. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. Well done brew. One of my favorite from the Beer Camp 12 pack."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with crisp and lively carbonation. Not bad but quite mineral filled and bitter for a bock."
""
""
"Superb looking beer has a durable bone-colored, creamy head that leaves the glass well coated.  Lovely orange-amber body with excellet clarity. Flavor is a rather hoppy rye bock, perhaps as much like an APA as a bock.  Excellent smooth feel with lively carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber body capped by an off-white head. Rye, grain, toffee and citrus aromas. Rich rye malty flavors, pepper & fruity finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Billed as a Rye Bock this screams out Pale Ale in appearance and scent. What's interesting is that this is quite fruity to taste despite no evidence in aroma.  Rye malt and tea leaf mix with lemon, lime, tangerines, floral perfume, honeysuckle and apricot to form a beer that is unconventional and off beat. I like it, despite it being unlike any Bock I've ever had or for that matter any rye."

"O: I'm really enjoying the rye in this one, as it gives a different perspective on bocks. It's another solid part of the 12-pack"
""
"A well done rye beer. Solid malt backbone with just enough hop highlights to stay balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent beer, a touch sweeter than I'd prefer; flavorful but not bold"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pleasant, but a bit forgettable."
""
"A tasty beer, not necesarily a classic bock beer but it is still refreshing, unusual and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O - Lots of things going on with this beer but it never hit a point of balance for me. Tasted good not great. Liked the smell better. Nothing wrong with it; just didn't wow me."
""
""
""
""
"I'm all for a tasty bock and this fits the bill."
""
""
""
"An ok bock. Could have played up the rye a bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The rye spiciness and fruity/herbal hops add an interesting twist on a traditionally malty style - somewhat a hybrid but definitely a successful one. Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Worth grabbing if you get the chance."
""
""
""
"Overall – A big and sweet rye and wheat beer. I should restate that this is rather sweet, but yet, it is still rather enjoyable and quite drinkable. An interesting tropical fruit flavored rye bock beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall not a very interesting beer IMO, rye needs to be balanced better, too heavy handed."

"Poured a gorgeous clear amber color with a nice bit of bubbles and a wonderful, fluffy, two finger off-white head. A very nice looking beer. Scents of rye toast, tangy sweet orange flesh, marmalade, apricot jelly, sweet malt and a bit of white wheat bread. A very nice, sweet, malty and bright fruity aroma profile. It is enticing and showcases the ingredients nicely. Flavor begins with a nice bit of spicy rye toast, mingling with marmalade, tangy wheat and a lightly bitter orange peel flavor. This moves into a middle with a more moderate level of bitterness with flavors of orange peel, more overt toasty rye, a bit of alcohol and hint of grapefruit peel and floral hops. Finish is lightly sweet but balanced with a light level of bitterness with notes of toasted rye, orange peel, a bit of wheat bread and tangy wheat malt and a bit of floral hops. Aftertaste is toasted spicy rye, bitter orange peel and a hint of white wheat bread. A good flavor profile that is quite complex in its overall makeup yet stays bright and refreshing. Very nicely done. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth, easy drinking feel. Very nice and quite refreshing in body despite the beer's ABV. Overall this is a nice beer that took some good ingredients and made a wonderful end product. It's malty and rich, yet also bright, fruity and refreshing. The aroma is also superb and the mouthfeel enhances the overall impression. Very well done."

"The body is nicely medium, although not as smooth as most Bocks. Drinkability was very good, the beer went easily enough. Overall, a pleasant enough brew, if it were on tap, I'd have a pint or two."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: its ok. its got some sweet fruit combined with the caramel. i like the cracker flavor in here. its well rounded, enjoyable - but, nothing amazing"
""
""
"Pours a really wonderful looking deep transluscent amber, with an inviting soft white head that gently sticks to the edge of your glass. Smell is a bit underwhelming for me; it's not bad in any way but it is really muted. I love to sniff so smell is a must for me. What is there is mostly mild hops and faint rye. Taste is pretty solid, good all around but again, fairly benign. I think Sierra Nevada and the collaborators were't really trying to ruffle any feathers with these beers or break any new ground, as everything so far seems to be pretty mild. Nutty, earthy, some citrusy hops and I get the very faint notes of anise or fennel. Some pleasant rye and caroway aftertaste. Moderate body with lively carbonation. Overall, decent, but like usual I wish the rye flavor was a little more robust."
"The taste is malty and sweet for the most part with a hit of rye flavor and a bit of spice. Fair earthy hop flavor and bitterness but not taking away from the brew. Medium bodied, well carbonated ale. Overall, nice rye and sweetness. Made me want a good whiskey."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall, I was really pleased with this, especially considering that it hasn't gotten as much buzz as some of the other beers in the box. I like rye beers, so perhaps this one speaks to me more than to most people. I was impressed with how detectible the rye was in this beer--sometimes it can be just a fleeting afterthought that allows the brewer to put that sexy ""RYE"" on the label. Not so in this case. I'd gladly buy another round of this one if it were available for regular purchase."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is more what I had in mind from the Cigar City collaboration. Super crushable with a vibrant, exotic and tropical hop profile. Perfect summer quencher. Style guidelines really don't apply here, but who cares? The ends justify the means. This one needs to be more than a one-time deal. Easily in my top three favorites from this mix pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Tastes like a strong ale without a real style There is a big malt and big hop presence but not really balanced or complementing one another. Not a bad beer just not sure what they were going for."
""
""
"Overall - a great offering for my first experience with the Beer Camp"
""

"I am enthusiastic about this particular brewing variation, and I hope others will do some experimentation along these lines. I'm not so crazy about this particular example, but I think there are possibilities here. From the 12 oz can included in the Beer Camp 2014 boxed set."

"o: This beer sounded SO good! Plenty to like but the bitterness left in the wake of the faded hops was distracting."
""
"The beer looks nice and smells like cotton candy. Sweet profile, in a very malty kind of way. Too much so, for my tastes. Minimal rye influence on this. Barely an accent. Smooth feel. Easy enough to drink, I suppose. This is not really a style that I appreciate, so perhaps that is why I am not overly impressed by it."
""
""
"O- I don't have a lot of experience with this style but this beer certainly makes me want to dedicate another spot in my fridge to more Bock!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I absolutely love Rye and how it works with beer. CANfusion totally delivers on taste. its smooth and creamy with wonderful flavors of citrus, spice, tangy notes of orange and a slight pepper finish. I really love the different aspects of this beer and how they combine together."
"Overall, a solid rye beer, but not much of a bock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad...not my favorite style, but quite drinkable. Nice hop presence cuts the malt enough to really balance this off nicely. Worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The hops inject a lot of fruity flavors into this bock, making for an interesting change of pace for an otherwise normally malty style."

"O: crisp and lean, but also warm and well-rounded; easy to drink, mild bitterness, malt-forward, but with enough hoppiness to create an inviting brew."
""
"Great Job guys! This one was the best (so far) of the bunch, in my opinion."
""

"O: Great beer in a nice can."

"O - A very easy drinking beer. Nothing mindlbowng, but enjoyable none the less."

"12 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 6/3/2014. Pours crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange peel, caramel, toast, spicy rye, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/grassy hops and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange peel, caramel, toast, spicy rye, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange peel, caramel, toast, spicy rye, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of bright citrus/grassy hops and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice hoppy bock style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/grassy hops and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Very good. By far the best I’ve had from a can labeled “Oskar Blues,” I’ve surprised by the nuance and depth of this one. If they had more like this, I’d be a big fan of Oskar."
""
"O- Not my thing, I guess the name ""Canfusion"" is a suitable name to describe how this beer came across my palate."
""
""
"Pours amber/honey with thick foamy head. Head retention and lacing are excellent. Aroma of sweet, darker malts. Fruity apple aroma. Slight bock aroma, but more hoppy. Malty taste up front, followed by a moderate hop bitterness with bitter apple aftertaste at the end. You can appreciate the rye on the back end. Not really what I expect from a bock. Pleasantly surprised."

"I'll make this short and sweet as I'm just cracking open the 12 pack of this collaboration series. While I had high expectations for this, especially due to it's high price, I am not pleased that the bottle on dates are as old as May of this year and this is just hitting some markets. Who was the genius that thought this would be a good marketing idea? This really could be an excellent series and I am a huge fan of Sierra Nevada, but seriously you couldn't do a better job of getting relatively fresh beers out the door instead of what appears to be just another attempt to cash in on the popularity of the craft brew industry. I'm not saying the beers are horrible and the reason I bought this 12 pack was that some of breweries don't distribute in Texas, but I don't encourage or recommend anyone buy this series at it's inflated price. Definitely a fail as far as I'm concerned."

"Clear amber pour with a frothy off-white one-finger head. Aroma has a strong floral and fruit smell. Flavor is somewhat peppery upfront balanced by citrusy hops. Has a very nice malt presence as the beer warms with raisin, plum, bread and caramel flavors. Finish is slightly sweet."

"Pours out an orange-y amber with hardly any head. Interesting smell. Caramel malts, booze, and a good bit of rye spiciness. Flavor leans more toward malted barley caramel-like flavors more typical of a bock. Rye is more apparent on the back end, lending it a spiciness and dryness. Carbonation is smooth, and the body is moderate to full. Interesting take on a bock. The rye works here."

"O-Not exactly to my tune. It's actually a bit boring. Surprising coming from the two brewers."
""
""
"Overall - Pretty nice beer. Hard to compare it to anything else since this is the first of the style ive had. I feel theres something missing that could make this world class. It tastes like a few good things from a few styles mixed into one beer. Maybe a little more bitter hops to tame down a little bit of sweetness? Still glad I got to try."
""
"12oz. can served in a shaker pint. Pours a dull copper with a voluminous, 1.5 inch, sizzling, cream-colored head. Nose is somewhat unassuming - a trace of fruity and notes of rye. Taste consistent with nose with addition of some citrus and an earthy/herbal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a slight oiliness and a prickly carbonation that leaves a residual burn at the back of the throat. Not bad, but the flavors and aromas are a bit too unpronounced while the carbonation is a bit too assertive."

"It's not earth shattering, but it is a real well constructed brew. Probably my favorite in the series."

"I don't know if this experiment really worked out well. It's not a bad beer; just slightly confusing (CANfusing?). I don't think I'd order it if it came in a sixer; but neither do I think I'd turn it down if offered at a party."

"Overall (3.75): A very good beer! It’s a bock, though classical bock characteristics are not the emphasis or strong suit, necessarily, of this beer. Not surprisingly, it’s the rye and this Ella hop varietal that are emphasized here, and it’s quite clear. Still, it’s pulled off with enough finesse that you don’t forget what the beer is, and you can focus on whichever side(s) of it you please. Personally, I’m pleased that it’s so drinkable, looks great, and legitimately pulls off a fusion of disparate style and ingredients."
""
"Overall: Good beer, I am not a fan of the sweetness. Aroma is nice. I could see this being really good if it attenuated just a bit more."
"Part of the Beer Camp complication. A collaboration between Oskar Blues and Sierra Nevada. Pours out the can a delightful dark copper with more than enough thick white foam. Large bock flavors come through on the nose and then a hint of the dry, earthy rye kicks in. This guy tastes a lot like the nose, the bock coming through but just not enough of the rye for me. I'm a big rye fan and when I see rye, I expect some serious rye flavors, I'm talking Cain and Ebel rye flavor, Red Rye IPA flavors!! However, it's a well made beer, excellent malt backbone, great mouthfeel, super smooth. Overall a well made beer and very drinkable for 7+ % abv but just not enough rye coming through to make me excited."

"maybe my least favorite beer of beer camp here, a rye bock, but it seems samey and sloppy a little bit to me. clear amber copper color, with a decently long lasting white head, not problems with the appearance of this one. the nose is maybe over hopped, not citrusy like the label says, but just bitter, and at the expense of the rye, which can barley be smelled at all. there is also a weird lager yeast character unbecoming to the beer, maybe fermented too warm? tough to say from the smell alone. the taste lack much hop flavor, just the bitterness, same as the nose, and the rye part of it seems underdone. i keep looking for more of it with each sip and i am getting nowhere. maybe a little spice to the finish, but its not distinctly rye malt, and seems a little out of place in a bock style. maybe its just a style that doesnt appeal much to me, but even if this beer is well made, its just not all that enjoyable. i drank it down no problem, but would rather have almost any other beer in the box before this one again, just largely unremarkable on the whole."

"Its medium-light body makes quick work of malt sweetness and a creamy body and prefers a spicy-bitter finish of leaf, citrus peel and herb. But in the end, the rye character is lacking; dwarfed by a non-describptive sweetness that renders the beer as highly neutral tasting."
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a light, orange-caramel coloring with a filmy, clingy, off-white head. Nose of resinous hops, subtle caramel notes, hints of pine, and grainy spices. Flavors are smooth caramel forward, with a kick of grapefruit and pine hops. Smooth in mouth, with a tangy sweet and subtly hopped aftertaste. Smooth, slightly dry finish. Was hoping for more rye character in this one."

"12oz can. Pours a translucent brownish amber color with over an inch of thick head. Good amount of lacing. Malty aroma with lots of bread, spice, and citrus. The taste is spicy and peppery rye followed by some nice citrus bitterness. Floral at times with some caramel and a big malt presence. Finishes with more of the rye and spices. Lots of carbonation with a slightly dry mouthfeel. Fairly noticeable alcohol presence. This beer has lots of the rye flavor but with a decent amount of bitterness to it. Overall, a nice surprise."
""
""
""

""
""
"Pours a brilliant copper with a thick frothy head that disappears halfway through consumption, but it's easily revived with a swirl of the glass. Very nice combination of flavors going on here. The nose is amazing, loads of caramel. The malt presence is mild, but there. The hops are similarly present, but not overwhelming. Very well balanced beer."
""
"I'm about halfway through the BeerCamp case, and this is the first beer that made me sit up and go ""Whoa, Boss!"" This beer has a lot going for it ... I'd readily buy this again if Sierra/Oskar made it a regular distribution beer. The other beers in the case have been consistently pretty good. This one is a good bit better than that!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Interesting concept. I like the malt character, and the hops play well against it. Rye doesn't dominate, but adds a nice spiciness at the finish."
""
"On a final note, I'm thrilled with this sampler pack and am so glad that I picked it up. I'm looking forward to many more collaborations from these brewers in the future."
""
""
""

"There's a understated caramel character with a peppery rye spice and a touch of piney hops. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and the second can grew on me even more than the first. This might be the sleeper hit of the case!"

"O: This was one of my favorites from Beer Camp. When I got the box, was hoping for original takes on styles, and this one certainly qualifies. Why don't we have more rye bocks out there? Seems like it's a winning combination worth exploring further."

"In all it is a well balanced beer that I wish I could grab in a 12pk. That was just understated because this was awesome! Best of the beer camp bunch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aftertaste is of a mild rye beer, bitter and hoppy, but it is tempered by the bock beer flavor. The burp, though is quite a treat! Overall it is a very good, unique brew."
""
"Solid. Maybe I should have had it a little colder, but it just not as clean as I'd want and expect the best bocks to be and the rye was under represented in my mind. Still worth a taste and a good start to this 12er. I stuck 1/2 the glass in the freezer for a bit and it did seem to clean up some. I'm not changing my scores but it was a little better."

"The beer pours a decent amount of bubbly white head that dissipates rather quickly but still leaves a film on the top of the beer. The beer itself is a clear light brown that appears almost orange, which is unlike any bock I've had before. The smell is sweet as a traditional bock but with strong rye notes that almost cover the smell. The smell also seems to have a sweet orange smell as well. The hop smell appears to be floral. The taste is a bit different than the smell. The taste tends to have all of the same notes but in different degrees. In the taste, the rye notes are much stronger as are the sweet orange notes, the sweetness normally associated with bocks is really down in comparison. The floral and orange hop notes are still present. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but on the thicker side despite the biting carbonation. The feel is smooth but fluffy at the same time. Overall, a decent attempt at a hybrid bock and while it does succeed to an extent, the bock part of the beer seems to suffer quite a bit. However, I would still recommend trying at least one."

""
""
"O: Enjoyable, like liquid bread."
""
""
"O: A pretty solid beer, overall. It's an interesting take on the style and, while not terribly complex, is enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a unique and tasty lager that pulls in some elements from wide ranging styles. But this really isn't a Bock."
""
""
""
"A solid take on the base style with a distinct American twist. Very much in line with the pedigree of the breweries involved. A good start to the 12-pack."
""
""
"O) I have reached the halfway point in the Beer Camp pack, and have yet to be disappointed. Another tasty brew here...."
""
"Pours a clear dark honey orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, rye, earth, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with earth, rye, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid balance of rye and citrus forward hops that is slightly better in the smell to me."
""
""
"Huge creamy head over a golden beer. Persistent with sheets of lace. Very attractive. Smells of citrus, earth, spice. Taste is creamy caramel, citrus, and earth, toffee, a distinct zing of rye spiciness, very lightly sweet. Medium body is mildly carbonated. Clean finish. Very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body: Very good mouthfeel - it's strong enough (7.2%) that the alcohol is present without being terribly hot. Very easy to drink."
"Not bad, not great. In the meh category. I wouldn't want to drink this again."
""
""
"This pours out a dark copper amber with a substantial inch-thick head--it falls a little but leaves great lacing behind. Aroma has a lot of grassy, flowery hop scent, and some identifiable rye pepperiness. Great malt flavor, complex with notes of bread crusts along with spicy rye. Bitterness is moderate, in the maibock range. Finish is rather dry for the the general bock style but perfectly good for this hybrid. This a fine, fine beer, possibly the best in the collection so far for me."

"12oz can fresh pour. thick amber with some orange and red hints. head is not gone in 30 seconds. smells of pecan, spice, candied sugar, rye, and grain. Taste is quite sweet, plum wine flavor, with hints of spice and hops. This beer has floral hop tones, and a fairly boozy bock style. fruit character here with the hop profile. The rye is barely on the nose and palate, and rounds out the booze and light body. Mouthfeel is light, with a touch of spice and hops, on the back of the mouth. Pair with pretzels, smoked trout, smoked sausages, and horseradish."

"This rye bock was a really nice beer. The appearance was very nice with a hazy dark yellow hue and a nice fizzy head. The smell had great amounts of rye and malt to make a fresh bread smell with some citrus hidden underneath. The taste was fantastic with those bread flavors being front and center to make a full flavored beer that still had subtlety to the bear. Sweetness in the beginning and finishing with mellow Earthy tones through out. Would highly recommend."
""

"O- Out of the two bocks in the pack, this is clearly the better. Nothing super impressive but it's flavorful and goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer works it way through a series of flavor experiments that begin with the rye grain and malts, become vaguely peppery and spicy, and end moderately bitter with a dry finish. Well balanced and easy to drink."
""
""
"Clean maltiness with plenty of rye. Strange...but okay."
""
""
""

""
""
"O - I wasn't thrilled with this one. It wasn't bad, but I'm fine with just the one. Even if it was available on its own, I wouldn't come back to it again."
""
""
"Overall - Delicious beer. Not sure it really fits as a bock style-wise, but American craft is gonna do its own thing. Frankly, drinks closer to your average modern Pale than anything. The other can in the SN mix pack, and frankly both were pretty close in flavor, with the rye being the big difference."

"12 ounce can, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a mug, the beer pours a mostly clear copper/orange color with about an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is very light, the brew smells like rye, toffee, and some fruit (berries, light citrus). It tastes like bready malt, apples, spicy rye, candied oranges and also a weird slightly metallic bitter flavor that isn't exactly pleasing. Unfortunately the taste only gets worse the longer I drink it. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has moderate carbonation. It seems to me that something is definitely off with this brew. Problem is I'm not going to buy another case just to see if this was a bad can or not, but if I come across a single somewhere I'll try it again."

"Overall 4.0: Great brew. I am not that familiar with ""rye bocks," but this one was excellent. The addition of tropical hops was a stroke of genius. Hoping that the brewers of Oskar Blues and Sierra Nevada can get together and put this one out on a regular basis."
""
""
""
"Poured into a becker a deep copper color with a sticky full one finger head atop that slowly settled into a frothy mass.some spicy rye and light caramel notes in the nose,faint leafy hops.A nice flavor profile with the spiciness from the rye mixed with almost a whiskey-like note,not overly sweet and a decent amount of leafy hop drying in the finish.This is a solid bock and the rye plays a real role,nice job here."

"Overall, this is a tasty bock with the rye adding some spicy notes to cut the sweet malts."

"45 IBU"
"I give this beer credit for its uniqueness. I give SN and OB credit for the same. I wouldn't have wanted a 12-pack with a bunch of boring, uninspired beers I can find anywhere. For that I am very grateful. But I also feel this could have been a bit better executed. Good but not as great as many SN beers often are."
