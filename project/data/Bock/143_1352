Smells of a  balance of malts and grain with a hint of hops and alcohol. Taste mostly to the sweet malts side tending afterward to a slightly bitter bite of hops. Mouthfeel is mostly smooth, clean and refreshing, with medium crispness and carbonation. Overall a drinkable brew for an everyday beer but nothing special.","Capt_Pete","Mar 21, 2015"

Taste is slightly more robust being of toasty dark malts, caramel, biscuit, roasted nuts, earthy & floral hops that provide a slightly lopsided balance. Peppery spice & more caramel in the finish. Roast & a little bitterness in the dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is low side of medium body with moderate carbonation, smooth with a slight prickle, juicy & wet with a dry aftertaste.

However, the taste is not so flavorful. It's a pretty watery and light tasting beer with a slightly creamy finish towards the end of the drink. Not a terrible beer and certainly not the worst I've ever had. I would not rule this one out forever, however, will not actively seek it out.","Gajo74","Dec 02, 2014"

This would make a pretty respectable amber lager or Vienna lager, but lacks the oomph and appeal of a classic bock beer. It's roasted grain and nutty flavors are a plus and makes the beer enjoyable enough for what it offers.","beergoot","Oct 21, 2014"

The smell is really good as well. The smell is not too strong or too weak. This beer is a good beer for just sitting back and relaxing around the house. It is also a good beer for out at a bar with friends, or at dinner. I would recomend it to anyone who likes dark beer, or to someone who likes to try new beers. It is one of my favorite beers and I know that I will have this beer again with no problem. So I would recommend that anyone who likes dark beer shpuld go out and have a Shiner Bock. I do not believe that you could go wrong with this beer.","jaredtp","May 28, 2014"

Malty finish with some light nuttiness. Very light mouthfeel for the style. Thin. This is a decent easy drinking Bock but it is certainly not going to replace 'Gansett Bock as my go-to in that category. Overall, alright.","PicoPapa","May 05, 2014"

It seems the amount of dimethyl (cooked cabbage) ranges from mild to a lot. Get a good one and you have a nice german amber lager. It is always a beautiful clear amber. There's never too much happening in the nose. The flavor is toast, caramel, dimethyl. No hop presence here. The mouthfeel is rather thin but but still has some smooth creaminess and is not overly carbonated. A great session beer that beats mass market cheap stuff in every way.","thehooksman","Mar 22, 2014"

It's very disappointing considering it sports the ""bock"" name, but I guess it could hold its own against some American dark lagers. It's definitely light years ahead of most of the BMC offerings. It's not something I'd drink for the pleasure of its consumption, but I wouldn't object to mindlessly pounding down a few pints on Gameday with some friends.","ThePaintedGrey","Feb 16, 2014"

The flavor is more dark macro than bock honestly. Light sweet maltiness with a heavy overtone of caramel and faint earthy hop bitterness. Little to no hop flavor. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Easy enough to drink and really nothing flawed here. It's a bit sweet and could use some melanoids.

I bought a 6 of it on a business trip to east Texas where I don't actually think craft/micro beer exists (best stuff I've seen is Sam and Goose Island) and figured I'd give a locally brewed Texas beer a try.

4.57,44.6,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,"Now, I have to level set for the rest of the 49 states that get Shiner weeks/months after it was made. I've toured the shiner brewery and can certainly attest to the affects of harsh storing and shipping condition on beer. I have had the flat, bitter, watery shiner bock that has been reviewed and I have also tasted the sweet ""Texas tea"" that is shiner bock, hours/days after the factory brewed it. Do not blame the brewery or the beer for the failings of time and mishandling of man. Firstly, shiner bock is no where near ""hoppy"" it is a sweet (as far as beers go) blend of yeast, malt, and hops. We sure do make bread with it down here. The deep caramel color is a clear indicator of taste. It is not intended to be be an overbearing weigh you down, alcoholic bock. It is refined for drinkability and sweet sipping (again think iced tea). It's certainly not a heavy headed brew that and does not pretend to be an exotic concoction of ingredients that blend together to make a disappointing off-putting flavor (Sam Adams Boston lager comes to mind). Take the traditional German respect for bier and an American sensibility for drinkability and crave for refreshing flavors and you have Shiner Bock. I can use apply all the adjectives and similes for the look but taste is he only thing that matters. I'd happily drink a shiner instead of a snobby craft beer placed on a pedestal that tastes like bathroom soap. If you notice the score I didn't say it was perfect due to the varying environments (consistency) I've tasted it in but it is good when it's good.","RoyTX","Jul 12, 2013"

Nothing out of the ordinary here but a very light bodied bock, watery to me. Maybe a dark lager to some. Nothing worth seeking out unless you just have to try it.","Lagerquestrian","Feb 01, 2013"

Poor Head retention. The aroma consists of some malted grain and not much else- No hops any other scent to speak of. Medium in body, this bock features some toasted grain flavor, just a slight hint of sweet caramel- Not much to get excited about here- i guess i would prefer this to say AB's Amber Bock.

It's the grainy malted carbonation. It's got its own zing that isn't bitter or citrusy, just a good medium-bodied lager with modest alcohol content.

Appearance: mellow brown with a thinning head--not much to look at at first glance.... Aroma: light and malty, with low hops and an easy-drinking introduction... Palate: smooth, medium-bodied--clearly a presence, a bock headbutt.... Taste: the malitness is like a ramped-up, amped down version of our beloved Yuengling Lager--a reverential comparison from a Northeastern Pennsylvanian... Overall: an odd review, paradoxical in its ""what you see/smell is NOT what you get!"" variety--and that’s quite alright--when a bock is NOT judged by its cover, or as a bock! When it’s limited by the state of Texas in its alcohol content--clearly a win for us all...","dacrza1","Nov 18, 2011"

Not much more than that. The taste was pretty well as expected, very light in flavor, but followed the nose with no hops to mention. The beer was light in the mouth, carbonation seemed to be right and drinkability was on par with other beers of a similar nature that is to say below average.

Although it is kind of dark in color, it is not a heavy beer and it’s very easy to drink. The flavor is sweet, toasted and nutty with some hop flavor as well. It’s really not bad, more than I expected, but it’s nothing special. It lacks the flavor that real bocks bring to the table and has nothing that makes it stand out, but it tastes pretty good and is light enough to be drinkable, so I can’t complain.","kflorence","Jul 22, 2011"

The mouthfeel is pretty light with some decent carbonation. The taste is okay, you get mostly some maltiness, no bitterness to speak of. Overall this beer is better than the 3 big alternatives, but I've long since grown tired of it but its all I can find with my meals so I still order it (while hoping to find someplace which at least has Guinness or Sam Adams on tap). It does have a pretty big following here in Texas, its the super popular ""craft"" beer, I've read somewhere its the best selling beer in Texas....I almost have to be careful not to let people I know see this review, they might feel betrayed.","DavidST","Jul 05, 2011"

Nicely malty and nutty in the aroma with some toasted grain and some light earthy hop aromas on the finish. The taste has some more of that toasted grain, a fair bit of sweetness, and some cereal grains. There is a bit of grainy slickness and slight sourness on the finish, but the nicely toasty notes are still there. Probably suffers more in the mouthfeel than taste from these defects.

As a bock it may not be very impressive, but style aside, this beer is delicious and enjoyable to drink. At 4.4% ABV it's pretty dang sessionable.

Initially, I felt this restraint was due to too high of a carbonation but as the beer slowly warmed up toward room temperature, I noticed that the cold carbonated flood mellowed out and progressively allowed for a better sense of a mild dark malt sweetness and light caramel backbone.

It's a bit too pale and flavor-lacking. It seems closer to a dunkel style than a bock. It's kind of malty/sugary sweet with not very much hop bitterness at all.

There's maybe a little more bitterness and malt flavor than Budweiser, but it's not incredibly complex or anything. Still, it has a nice, creamy mouthfeel and very good drinkability.

I find shiner's bock to be very similar in flavor, about the same in price and more consistent than yuengling. Alot of times yuengling will taste too flat and watered down or too carbonated. Sometimes you get it really sweet which is awesome but it's very rare. If you know what i'm talking about than relate to flavor to a more carbonated yuengling. I find shinerbock a bit more prickley unless yuengling is over carbonated. Overall i think the texans are beating us in a Shiner bock vs. Yuengling lager battle.","emericanchaos","Aug 14, 2005"

I've always been a fan, and even though many knowledgable beer drinkers will argue that there is nothing terribly exciting about Shiner (and they would be right), it's still a huge success for a number of reasons. It's a highly drinkable, worthy alternative to the American macro brews that rule the market. It has a nice color, and is an excellent thirst-quencher to accompany a saturday cookout. But as far as bocks go, Shiner is one of the least complex versions out there. It's not fancy, but it's not trying to be. It's just trying to be a dependable beer. Here in the mid-Atlantic (where you can now find Shiner at various locales), it's akin to Yuengling. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.","Atlas1","Aug 04, 2005"

Body is medium and a bit carbonated. Like many American Bock beers, it is grainy and sweetly sticky to the toung without the supporting malt character or the warming finish.

That seems like what this is. I'd guess they're using a product called ""porterine", but there are others available. Or it could have had something to do with the way that beers of a certain strength are categorized in Texas. Either way, it's nothing new and there's nothing to be ashamed of.

It was a nice change from the Bud and Coors light, Corona, Miller products, etc! Not a bad brew, pours to a copper color with a white bubbly head that fades pretty quickly. The aroma is of slight roasted malt and caramel but they seem to be difficult to pick up. Not a bad smelling brew compared to the macros that where available but not very robust! The taste is similar to the aromas, not much depth but enough going on to make it an enjoyable experience. Was able to handle the hot sticky weather with this brew so it fit the bill. Over all I would get this brew if it was available in NY State once in a while.","Stimack","May 09, 2004"

3.33,5.4,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"This one was much better than my recollection of past samplings. This Texan pours a crystal clear, amber, copper body with a one finger, ivory head. The head doesn't last very long, and some minimal patch lacing is left on the pint glass. Aroma has some caramel or toffee notes, and a restrained German(Hallertau?) lager style hoppiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and features medium carbonation. Taste immediately reveals a lighter body than the mouthfeel. Caramel sweetness is dominant in the flavor profile, but is evenly balanced by the Germanic hops in the background. This is a tasty brew for an American regional, and far above average in that context. Finish is clean and leaves no aftertaste. A very pleasant, drinkability factor, but it's not really a bock or a dunkel lager. To be honest, I'm at a loss on how to caterorize this one, but it's certainly a better tasting brew than I was expecting.","merlin48","Apr 17, 2004"

The smell is clean and slightly grainy with a hint of bittersweet hops. The taste is similarly clean, but simple, save for a curious series of sweet floral notes at the finish. Otherwise, it's a well balanced if slightly bland brew. Mouthfeel is thin but the drinkability is great and versatile. I can see this being very refreshing and can vouch for its perfect fit with a hearty meal. Decent, average stuff that I might snag again in a pinch.","MobBarley","Mar 29, 2004"

Boy I am glad I ordered then what a great beer to drink from a yard not to full bodied or flavored just enough of everything to be enjoyed in that style of drinking beer. Now here I am back home and sitting here noting the visual aspects of this beer it pours amber ruby with an off white cream colored head about two fingers worth and quickly dwindles down to a thin collar of lace only to leave scattered lacing with each sip. Aromatics on this beer are well a little faint with a slight caramel malt tone but no real hop aroma to be found. Taste is creamy buttered caramel malts with faint hop bitterness in the background to balance out the sweetness and touches of dark roasts add to the experience. Mediocre at best with a thin body artificial carbonation, not much of anything special going on.
