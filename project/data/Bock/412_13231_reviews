"On the dry, hoppy side of bocks, and I'm not complaining. Sweetness is restrained in favor of nutty, toasty, salty malts. Soft fizz, super clean finish and at this strength the ABV is still somehow not overplayed. Yum!"

"Sweeter taste than for a normal German beer with some bock feeling at the end. Not bad, try it when you see it."
"There's alot going on here but it ends up being a cacophony of many flavours which just doesn't bring much harmony or joy."
"Drinkable, but the sour fruit finish might annoy some and the body is a little too light to be considered a standard. Good beer."
"Dr: Very drinkable, especially for the ABV. Well priced in Germany. A great beer all around."
"Nicely balanced Bock here. Doesn't make me want to go out and grab a case, but it's tasty and drinkable."
"Edit: I guess this isn't from the Kulmbacher brewery. Although from Kumlbach, and billed as 'the popular beer from Kulmbach' it is disassociated."
"D: A very good bock. Well done, with a nice mix of sweetness, fruity flavors, and appropriate hop presence. Right on for the style, and easily drinkable."
"Aftertaste: Toasted malts and fresh hops that."
"0.5 liter bottle, dated (best by date?) 26 Jan 10. Pours a completely clear, orange-red color with a fluffy, off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel and pale malts, smoke, wood, grain, and yeast. Flavor is caramel and light roasted malts, sweet, dark fruits, and spicy. Mouthfeel is medium, dry, metallic, a touch of alcohol, and hint of bitterness remains. Good beer, nice complexity."
"D: The best Bock style i have taken, before it was ""noche buena"""
"The drinkability is very good, I like the brew. Prosit, MK"
"I was very dissapointed with this beer to be honest, obviuosly a supermarket/nightshop sort of beer in my opinion, not a well crafted beer at all."
"Overall, this beer is bordering on Doppelbock character, more so than a typical bock beer. The body is maybe in millimeter from being full enough to be a Doppelbock and a little hoppier, but I think it would be splitting hairs."
"I couldn't polish off more than one half liter of this, but it's quite good."
"M&D: even better than Paulaner Salvator, this doublebock shows an even-deeper input of toasted malts that is in turn balanced by a lovely sour fruity edge. The carbonation comes nearly perfect, as soothing as refreshing. All in all, this malty brew is utterly enjoyable and even quaffable by the German Bock standard!"
"This beer is best for special, introspective evenings. And a damned good price too."
"this is decent drinking, and should please bock fans."
"Overall this is a fantastic brew that would pair wonderfully with a hearty meal or a cigar and a fireplace."
"Huge creamy head fades slowly leaving a few specs of lace. Deep amber, almost brown, colored beer. Rich, sweet aroma is a mix of dark roasted malt, raisins, plums, and a pinch of alcohol. Moderately full body is full of fine carbonation. It's packed full of malty sweetness. Flavors of caramel, raisins, and vanilla up front with a touch of alcohol in the finish. Full flavored, tasty as hell, and highly drinkable. It's damn good."
"D-This beer had 2 months before expiration date, perhaps a slightly stale flavouring, im sure a fresh tap glass would be a bit more lively but as a typical bock beer, this is very good, not too syrupy, and with alchohol well disguised, its easy to drink too much of this ;)"
"Taste is green malty, but still strong on the malt presence. On top of the malt base there is a mild caramel taste. The vegetable taste is in the taste, but I get used to this after some sips and I do not taste it anymore. The yeast gives some anise notes. Body was medium, not overly sweet."
"The beer had good clarity and a deep copper color, with a massively poofed head, served in an enormous 1L mug. The smell was sweet and malty, it reminded me of the wort aroma you can smell in breweries, nice and inviting. The taste was mostly malt, I didn't get much of a bitter after-taste as I normally see from the bocks available to me in the US (mostly from US breweries). It was fantastic, possibly my favorite bock beer to date."
"more than one bottle of this per session."
"¡Salud!"
"500 ml swingtop bottle, now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet, bestillingsutvalget). ABV is 6.9%. Orange to amber colour, large off-white head with an orange hue. Moderate aroma of malts, some fruity hops and bakery, notes of alcohol. Flavour is fairly malty and bready, some caramel sweetness, alcohol is evident but not too much. Some hoppy bitteness and slightly burnt notes in the finish. OKish, but not my favourite bock."
"One of my favorite styles in german beer; its accentuated hops aroma and low in malt, its dark color and its bottle, made perfect with a snacks, serving in mug and enjoyed at 7 o´clock, smell and taste is good, mouthfeel, up on the average, drinkability too, very recommendable."

"Not a great bock but not awful, limited in flavour"
"BB 26-01-06. Nice and lasting head leaving laces, brown and clear beer. Nose is sweet, malt but not fresh, cardboard, no hoparome noticeable. Taste is sweet, roasted irish coffee and litle bitterness. One whereby you keep asking yourself what you mis. Mis freshness and taste overal, laks caracter so no highlight alltogether. Postives: easy drinkable, oily mouthfeel, clean."
"Nice clear dark copper color under a thin tan head that faded pretty quickly and left only minimal lace. The nose is full of sweet caramel and barley. The mouth is a bit prickly, and heavy with sweetness. The taste starts sweet - caramel and grapes or prunes. Alcohol is present, and there's a good amount of malt lurking here, too. What I don't notice is hops. The sweetness just keeps going on and on, never yielding to a bitter finish. The aftertaste is fruity sweet. This is a nice ""starkbier," but not really much like the average Bock. This probably should be characterized as a Doppelbock, although the label does not do so."
