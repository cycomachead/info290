The nose comprises honey-laden rye bread, a light hint of maple syrup, and a vague sense of sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, though now that bread is also slathered in Country Crock (nope, no real butter here, folks), and there's a general feeling of mild greens mixed in here and there. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly fluid feel. Overall, an okay bock at best, one that just doesn't do it for me at all.","TMoney2591","Feb 10, 2013"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the alcohol was well hidden but the flavors were so bland that they couldn't hold my attention and I wouldn't want to drink another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the only aspect of this beer that was decent and it was fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was way too bland for the style and it wasn't very memorable at all. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's just not a good example of the style and I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone. All in all i was pretty let down with this beer, it didn't really have any redeeming quality's. This was another average at best beer from Breckenridge, I don't think I will be taking too many more chances on this brewery, I have yet to be impressed by any of their beers, you guys need to step your game up.","StoutHunter","Feb 08, 2013"

Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity and loads of carbonation in evidence. Nose had a dense caramel sweetness which was to be expected. I say that as a self-avowed hophead. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste, while malty and sweet, was not cloying, which is something I have encountered in this style. Finish was actually tending towards dry, suggesting that they really allowed the yeast to do its job, hence the ABV. I like Breckenridge, I liked this beer although it would not be the first thing that I would reach for, so I would suggest giving it a try.","woodychandler","Jul 17, 2012"

I'm struggling to adequately review this beer because my taste buds are struggling find some flavor.

Fits the style of a Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation. Tastes of yeast cleanliness up front, then sweet malt, and some hops are noticeable - a little watery.

I really, almost desperately wanted to love. The look and aromas were nice, but everything else was strictly average. Perhaps I need to taste this side-by-side with others of its kind, as I'm becoming increasingly convinced that the bock is an under-appreciated and largely misunderstood style. I like it more than most bocks, but I'd still have a hard time recommending it for any reason other than sheer curiosity.","PirateUlf73","Apr 19, 2009"

This is a decent tasting bock. Big body. Close to full. Chewy mouthfeel. Thick malty taste. Raisins, figs and dates are fairly pronounced in the flavor profile. Almost a bread pudding feel to it. Solid effort.","Bighuge","Mar 27, 2009"
3.75,9.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours medium amber with contrasting white head. Nose is on the "sweet" side with honey and bready malt. On the palate the malt is noticeable right away, but this is a lighter bock than most and the lighter bodied malt component fades into the honeyed finish. Alcohol is noticed on the finish also. Clean and refreshing. Good for those who like a lighter bock. I'd recommend this as a gateway beer to German style bocks.","yemenmocha","Mar 26, 2009"

This is certainly an enjoyable bock.","atsprings","Feb 26, 2009"

Overall flavour is, imho, a real mess...too earthy, too sweet, not too drinkable:^( I'm doubting whether I can finish the bottle.

It poured a very nice clear copper color, and while it did not have much head it looked good and it also had a nice aroma, however, it had one of the strangest tastes I have had in a beer. First, the mouthfeel was almost oily and it seemed to leave a film in my mouth. My friends thought I was crazy, but it tasted like liquid fried chicken. It was not a very pleasant taste, thank goodness this taste was the first taste when the beer hit my mouth and dissipated quickly. The beer did not have a strong after taste. Don't think I would drink this again.","plrooney","Feb 09, 2009"

Nose is mostly of yeast and malts with a hint of nuttiness to it. This is a decent tasting bock with a relatively big body to it. Taste is of caramel and sweet malts. Hops are very very light in the finish - I really had to look for them. The beer finishes clean and crisp, a little on the dry side.
