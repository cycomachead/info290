"not a fan of bock beers"
""
"Not bad bit not sure if I would get it again"
""
""
"Overall:  This is a pretty good beer, and very unique too.  It has nice malt and sweetness flavors blended well with some very interesting sauerbraten-like vinegary notes.  I’ve never had a beer like it, and I’d certainly have it again."
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours light brown with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head.  Aroma is of sweet caramel malt, grassy hops and some cherries.  Body is medium and slightly crisp.  Taste is of caramel malt, herbal hops and some dark fruit, well balanced.  Finish is long, semi-dry. Exceeded my expectations."

"From what I can remember from having this beer it was ok, it was not my favorite beer. But the taste was not all that bad. For a cheaper beer I would say that this is a decent beer. For myself I liked it but I like bock beer. This was not my favorite back beer but it was a decent beer."

"Thank You Yuengling Brewery"
""
"A so-so bock. It lacks eye-appeal with its weak head. The taste is decent enough yet ultimately underwhelming with a lack of depth and complexity for the style."
" Overall a modest 3.25 is given to this seasonal bock brew from Yuengling. This is certainly a sipper. I would buy this brew again to compliment a heartier meal."
""
"Overall, this is a decent bock, however it does not taste as good as it smells. A little more flavor would be nice but this is not bad as long as you can find it cheap."
""
""
"If there was a light bock out there that hit at simplicity and easy drinking this is it."
""
""
""
"I hope that the goat is right. My pour got me a finger of fizzy, light-tan head that quickly dropped out of existence. Color was a cola-brown (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a sugary malty sweetness and I was reminded why I may not have reviewed this previously. Mouthfeel was kind of thin and watery and the taste was actually not as sweet I had girded myself to expect. Instead, it had a slightly grassy hoppiness that helped to offset the malt. Finish was semi-sweet, but kind of bland for the style. I would be willing to try it again if they CAN it, but as long as it is bottle-only, it will remain a real one-and-done for me."

"I gave the Bock of the last two years a medium to low rating, majorily due to the fact that Yuengling has given way to the pressure to release their beer all too soon. In years gone by, the Bock wasn't released until March and ran through June, normal Bock release time. Typically a Bock is created at the end of winter and cellared until the first thaw, this gives it the distinct flavors, and causes it to mature through age. The Bock of old would release in the spring and the taste would evolve throughout the relaese. When Yuengling releases the Bock it is not ready for consumation, and it will have a very strong taste, both hoppy and roasted in taste. In my experience, the beer will maturate over a period of months, each month mellowing in flavor and revealing more complexities of the original mash tun. Although I don't agree with what Dick is doing with the release date of his Bock, I have put a few 6-packs on the shelf for, say, April and May, they will definately have a different taste by then."

"I love the idea of throwback bocks, and I understand that this beer has been around for a little while, but this was the first time I'd seen it in a local store. It's a very clear, chestnut colored brew, moderately low in carbonation, with a thin, whitish head. The smell is of an adjunct lager, mixed with some pleasant lightly toasted malt (identity crisis?). The taste is sweet, with some malt backbone...some macro corn-like flavors as well...more front-line bitterness than expected too. Medium in body, more than expected. This is not a great beer, but it isn't bad either. Like I said, I am a fan of throwback brews."
""
""
"Heavy mouthfeel, leaves a bitter aftertaste, yet easily drinkable. Just the right amount of carbonation, that aspect gets a win for me. Mid-brown color leaves a thin head almost no tracing. I get an earthy taste from this, some hints of wood as well. This beer definitely strong arms the pallet, cleanse before trying anything else, it sure will muddle it. I'll stick to the rules and not say which Bocks I had that were better, many were, but for the price, this one is acceptable."

"O: Flat, simple, thin, disappointing."
""
""
"To call this a bock is like calling a pilsner an IPA, only backwards. It is the worst example of a bock I have ever tasted. It is twice as bitter and half as malty. I am thankful I only wasted money on a 6-pack. Someone should really educate them on the bock style. Yuengling makes a good lager. But as far as a bock it would not even be suitable for marinade."

"In Closing I would just like to add,I think this beer gets a bit too much Negative press from people Comparing it to other,More Traditional Bocks,a lot of them costing @ least twice as much,I can pick up Yuengling Bock up all day long for around $6.50 a 6er,that is a VERY sweet price point for a good,smooth drinking beer of any type,let alone a Bock,and Personally ..I just enjoy this beer a lot & do not think it deserves the amount of hate it gets,but thats just my opinion man,so hate it if you want to,but me? I am gonna drink the hell out of it! hehe,cheers!"

"o. A drinkable bock, not enough distinctive taste to get especially excited about, but a good solid pleasing beer with nothing to dislike about it. Have had two and the second was consistent with the first."
"This was my first Bock experience and is was a good one I must say I do like and what I understand they just started brewing again after a long hiatus. Reddish color and very hoppy and Carmel taste. It is now I guess a seasonal brew for them and lets hope they continue brew for all to taste.."
""
"I am very satisfied with this attempt by yuengling. It gets a little old when you grew up around yuengling lager and constantly hear everyone boast about it. They have a nice niche. Note - this is a lager. I praise yuengling for marketing this attempt. That said, is it a world class bock? Hell no. Did I enjoy it? Hell yes. For the price and taste I would gladly buy this every time over regular yuengling lager. That is if they keep making it. Cheers to yueng for trying something different (or at least a little different.) And of course cheers to you, mateys!"

"Overall impression: A very approachable beer. Provides much more flavor than the typical industrial/commercial offerings. It will appeal to the masses but probably won't do much for any extreme beer enthusiasts. The product is nicely done and for the price point, I'll be bock."
"Would be good with sushi i'm thinking and burgers and Mexican fare . (your mileage may vary on food pairings, of course....)"
""
""
""
""
"Rather boilerplate--but solid--example of the style. Pours a limp and nearly headless brown with an aroma of grass and sugar dusted caramel. Tastes sweet and crisp, with mild and zippy nodes of fruit, biscuits, and sugar against a pleasantly fleeting backend of grass and mild hops."
""
""
"Eh, I'll be honest; I could easily have a few of these. Nothing too good. Just a malty Yuengling."
""
""
"O: Good bock, especially when I am in the mood for a slightly hoppy flavor. My only wish is that it would have a more substantial fell in the mouth."
""
""
""
""
"notes: this is horrible beer. mean looking, wretched smelling and awful tasting. I couldn't finish it and am now stuck with 5 more bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There are two predominant characteristics of beer flavor: hops and malt. Some palates prefer one of these, I prefer a balance of the two as is found in the beers from Germany. This bock is an example of a typical American style of bock where the hops predominate and the malt sweetness is in the background. FIne if you prefer this style, a tragedy if you do not. I prefer a more balanced brew."
""
""
""
""
"Decided to try this, kind of been on a bock/double bock kick lately...felt it was smoother than conventional yuengling lager, with a more refined taste. Decent reddish-umber colour, smelled faint notes of caramel. Left little to no head (came from tap and what little head was there quickly dissipated), taste was conventional bock, without being too dry. All told, a pleasing beer, but not one i would go out of my way for."
""
"The appearance is a darker then amber, brown, with a light head. grainy aroma. A bit of hop presents, but this is malt centered, with a sweet and caramel taste. More carbination then expected. The price and the ease of drinking make it worth a try. I will take my bock exploration elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this one is worth the price of admission, which isn't actually saying much since it's very cheap. First of their seasonals that I felt was noticeably better than the lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A brisk pour into a German dimple mug kicks up a brief rocky head of light tan foam that settled with large soap-like bubbles that collapses into a 1/4"" collar. Nice dark tea color with healthy carbonation, sweet bready malts and a lingering subtle roastiness, very light hop aroma. Nice dark bread & bittersweet flavor...more bitter from the dark malts rather than hops, a fruity note remains after taking a mouth filling sip. Decent but thin mouthfeel and prickly carbonation. Finishes up roasty-malty. Nice showing from Yuengling but some more malt backbone would elevate this to a truly high quality Bock. Good session brew nonetheless."

"O: Overall it can hardly compare to an Salvator or other notable bock. Seems to be a tweener and more of an introductory to the yuengling crowd or macro world to the world of bocks. Low alcohol, lack of fruity nature with a macro-infused flavor that lacks depth, substance and seems to trail off and thin out at knockout. Drinkability is low, enjoyment is low and grows tiresome by end of a single serving lacking enthusiasm for another. A c- to c rating is about right here, didn’t offend, yet didn’t offer reason to keep drinking."
"3.45/5.00"

"12 ounce bottle, picked it up for $1.19 as a single. Served in a mug, the brew pours a reddish/amber color with about a 1/4 inch off-white head that went away quickly. Not much lacing. Aroma is sweet and malty, the brew smells like bready malt/grain and caramel. Not much to it, but it's a nice aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some apples and nuts. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has moderate carbonation and it's easy enough to drink. I think it's a decent enough brew, it's worth a try."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Deep red-amber in color with a thin light tan head that dissipated fast, the aroma was faintly sweet and maybe a little malty. The beer had more hop flavor than I expected as well as more hang. The bottom line was that at $4.99/six at Total Wine this is a good beer at a cheap price."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice reddish black color with a small white head that dissipates fairly quickly but leaves a tiny bit of lacing. Smells of darkly roasted malts with a hint of coffee but not strong. Tastes of dark roasted malt with a little bit of chocolate, but otherwise not many other tones jump out. This medium bodied beer goes down smooth and has a good level of carbonation. Overall, an average beer."
""
""
"I'd have to favor the porter flat out. As for bock, I'll stick with ze Germans. It's not bad for PA, though."
"Drinkability is good, tasty bock, full flavor but light and balanced enough to enjoy on a brisk spring day working the yard, or in my case, after."
""
""
""
""
"Decent for domestic bock. I'd have this again."
""
""
""
"I like it better than the Lager from Yuengling, but not quite as good as the Chesterfield,....but close. Nice surprise beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty easy drinking, but still lingers in flavor pretty close to lager except for some mild caramel malt tones. I'll take this over lager but would like to see a version with a hop presence to chesterfield"
""
"Well, guess this is going to be interesting. Pour is deep amber, but still translucent. Tight white head with small bubbles. The smell is candied and burnt sugar with touches of caramel. It starts out nice and light. Cereal grains dominate at the beginning, but it finishes overly sticky sweet with burnt sugars really dominating, to a sickening thing. It was like eating brown sugar near the end."
""
"Decent for the price, but probably not something I'd seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-very tasty and very easy to drink. obviously it has more of an adjunct taste to it than other good bocks, but its definitely a fun beer to drink. i could order this by the pitcher."
""
""
""
"Viking's Verdict: Yuengling's bock doesn't offer enough for me to keep coming back to. Everything - taste, smell, is pretty much mediocre, and it's real saving grace will be it's lower price."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this might not be the perfect example of a bock but it has good flavor and is quite refreshing. One of the better values out there."
""
"Taste-Watered-down sweet malt,faintly metallic finish. Taste did not match the looks or smell of this beer. Many better bock beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a bad Bock by any means."
""
"Taste wise, it feels and tastes like a Yuengling. It has that dry, light feel with a not so sweet ""bock"" taste that I am accustomed to in European bocks. It tastes much more like their Black & Tan. It lacked the real roastiness of the finer bocks, and lacked some spicing. I'd say with time this one will sort itself out."
""
""
""
"This has good balance and is drinkable and enjoyable, but ultimately it doesn't have as much flavor or complexity as some other bocks out there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: similar to their lager. sweet. very malty. very drinkable."
""
"For BOTTLE: reviewer DonMonkey1 was spot on in his review."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is easy to enjoy. Although thirst quenching, it has nice and assertive character."
""
"Review from notes. So there I am in the store with a 12 of Genesee Bock beer under my arm, looking for something else at the top of the food chain when I see Yuengling's Bock beer in a sixer, what, in Ohio before their porter? I took a flier on it, give Genny's lil goat a run for the $$$, Pepsi challenge style fight between the two. Poured a dark amber with little head into dimpled mug. Smells of malt and hops. Slightly bitter taste from the hops in the front that is quickly evened and sweetened up by the maltiness and then finishes rather cleanly with good mix of hop, malt and carbonation. Much like Genny a good bock that's reasonably priced, though this has a bit of hop presence to it. Much like their Black & Tan, this too seems like a bit of a mix of their lager with it's mild malt and the slight hop bite of their Lord Chesterfield Ale. Overall, very good for a decent price as far as bock goes."
"I am not sure if I am drinking a bad bock or a bad Yuengling lager. Not good. The goat...this is it. Outside of the inventive labeling there is nothing good going on here. I am actually very surprised they rolled this out as the first seasonal in Ohio. I would not want to buy another seasonal if I did not have a general respect for Yuengling as is. I will chalk this one up as a bad taste in an otherwise good brand. Sadly...a direct competitor to MGD."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – For the price, Yuengling comes though again. While not the best bock you will have, they make a pretty decent brew at a good price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. No idea where or when I acquired this gem. Pours a clear, medium colored copper color with a thick fluffy light tan head. Vegetable mixed with caramel nose. Medium mouthfeel. The vegetable I smell and taste is tomato. I sorta has a stewed tomato taste...weird. The aroma and taste are not good but the look is awesome, great lacing and head retention just too bad the rest of this didn’t come together."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, tastes pretty similar to Yuengling's other offerings. Smooth and refreshing. In my honest opinion it tastes identical to Black and Tan, maybe with a few little differences. It is definetely a refreshing beer and could possibly work as a session drinker. If I wasn't born and raised a PA Coal Crack I would probably not even review yuengling, but since I grew up with these guys I have no other choice than to let me pride show."

"Taste is malty and nutty, sim at to the smell. Finishes slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is good and well balanced. Overall, a decent brew. Nothing outstanding but it's solid."
"Poured into my pilsner glass resulting in a good two finger head of dense foam and wonderful clinging lace. Some of the best lace I have seen in a long time. The color is a 29 in the SRM beer color chart. Smell is that of roasted barley, burnt corn husks, peat moss, rich coca, and dark brewed coffee. The initial taste is slightly sweet with a lingering of honey. Rich roasted barley follows and the finish is a tinge of hops. Mouthfeel is grand and full, lots of creamy coating and fullness. Overall it is a beer I would buy again, and drink while watching a good movie."
"A medium to light bodied beer, very drinkable, but rather plain."
"Session beers don't get much more obvious than this. There's a mild roasted presence to this with just a hint of alcohol in the taste but like the flagship beer in this brewer's lineup, this is mediocre at best. Only seek this out if you're desperate for a Bock and it's not the sign of the goat on your astrological calender."
"This is like a malt liquor."
"This is yet another Yuengling offering I wouldn't seek out again but wouldn't decline of offered."
"An easy drinking bock that's well balanced."
"Overall - The one Yuengling I will never again try unless convinced other wise"
"Reddish brown beer with a bubbly tan head. Earthy aroma with some burnt, grassy notes. Nice citrus hop flavor on the tip of the tongue followed by roasted coffee and sweet breadiness. Aftertaste of sweet caramel. Feels a little watery, but overall a pleasant drink."
"Drinkability - Mild carbonation, a touch gritty in the mouth, very mild."
"Clean tasting bock with grainy sweet flavors of of bread and toast, and an appropriate amount of hop bitterness. Not much hops beyond bittering. A little thin in body and weak in alcohol for the style, but nice clean flavors of rich grains make this an easy drinking beer."
"Pours a slightly muddy dark brown color with a tiny head that diffuses quickly. Aroma is standard, some sweeter dark malts is really all that's here. Doesn't smell bad though. And it doesn't taste bad either. This is just a pretty simple bock that tastes pretty good. It's a touch watery at the start, but comes through with a roasty kick at the end. Reminds me of an amped-up version of their lager in taste profile, actually. Nothing mindblowing, but perfectly serviceable and cheap. The mouthfeel is decently carbonated and has a nice dryness to it, and the drinkability is quite good. Overall a pretty good offering from Yuengling that's quite cheap ... if this were easier to find during the distribution period I would have bought a lot of it, but I only just found it at Total Wine."
"O: very simple Bock nothing to weird or out of the ordinary."
"Overall: Highly disappointing. I don't expect world class beer from Yuengling, but I expect something decent, especially considering I like the porter and lager. Didn't expect something that is reminicent of old wet cardboard! Love the packaging, but I'm wondering if this might have gone bad in the short amount of time it has been on the shelves? Wish I could have had a single bottle instead of a whole six pack. Might have to try cooking with it or something."
"This beer pours out of 12 oz bottle a brown red color like Coca Cola with a pure white head which disappears rapidly. Carbonation is minimal like a Bock should be, so far it looks like a Bock. Smells include Munich malt sweetness and an earthy overtone, not bad. Tastes like sweet and roasted Munich malts, some corn adjunct, and earthy hops so they used a Tettnanger or Liberty style hops good job except the corn overtone! Drinkability is high, and this is goes down easy. For all accounts and purposes this is the best in what i would call American Style Bock. It hearkens back to a German beer with an American twist. This is a good interpretation!"
"Overall I have to say pass on this beer. I'm glad I only bought a single of it. Taste is bland/harsh and completely uneventful. While some boring beers are at least have a place in this world (macro lager on a hot summer day), this boring beer leaves your mouth somewhat annoyed."
"O - This is a very decent offering. It seems better on-tap than I recall it being in the bottle."
"overall: kind of what i expected from this brewery, i respect it for its rich history, but not something i would buy. reminds me in many ways of gennesee bock beer"
"Taste is lacking a bit. Some caramel malts come through, not a hint of hops, amd just the slightest hint of booze in the finish. The taste itself isn't actually so bad, but combined with an unpleasant smell and a weak, but too-highly carbonated mouthfeel, the taste and beer take a hit. Not a terrible beer, but I probably wouldn't be drinking it again anytime soon. Not sitting very well with me."
"This is probably my favorite Yuengling release. I'm glad they brought it back from retirement. The first time I had this beer was at the Outback Steakhouse and they had advertisements for it on the tables and it shocked me to see that Yuengling was taking part in a seasonal release. I ordered one right away. It came with a nice tan head capping off a smooth looking brown body. The aroma of malts were the strong point of this brew. It's not the best Bock out there but I just thought it was awesome that they put this out to compete with all the other seasonals out there."
"Haven't had a Dunkler Bock before, and few other Bock styles, but I'm quite enjoying this one."
"O: Very nice bock. Smooth, not overpowering and just enjoyable to drink."
"Notes: For me it just misses the mark and my overall feeling is that it's a very drinkable but average at best Bock."
"First of all, Love the label on this beer! It pours a clear reddish brown color with small ring of white foam that lingers. Aroma is rather faint. Toasty caramel malts. Faint hop presence. Flavor is is a little malty. Not too sweet as some other bocks are and a bit watery. There is a little hops bitterness in the ever-so quick finish. Actually kinda resembles their Traditional Lager. Thin but slightly creamy and soft mouthfeel. Still, watery."
"Overall it's a little bit above average (think mass-produced golden lagers), but it's far from a bock. The 5.1% abv excludes that right off the bat with traditional bocks starting at 6.3%. The lack of malt flavor then completely shuts it down. Otherwise they're at least on the right track."
"I like this brew and for the money it will dance."
"A refreshing beer, but, almost a light bock. The qualities are there. However, to subtle to be a great beer. That being said, not a bad sixer for a kickback night."
"O: The beer is easy to drink, yet it lacks the fuller body of other beers in the style."
"Despite the underwhelming nose/palate combo, the mouthfeel is finely balanced and provides a crispy finish. While Yuengling Bock can never compete with the Munich heavyweights, it is still nice to see the Yuenglings brew one nonetheless."
"I remember the dark sweet Easter drink from""childhood", those teens when Pops explained the goat among other things, you're not JFK and this is not bock. I was told that bock was done to clean out the 'STUFF"" that accumulated in the brewery."
"Still, I'll take your porter 10 times out of 10 over this one."
"Poured from a bottle (no date) into pint glass. Pours a chestnut brown body with orange highlights on the edges and a smaller off white slightly creamy head. Aroma of orange juice, grains, slight chocolate and dust. Medium to fuller bodied that really fizzes up in your mouth with stronger carbonation. Flavor is much better then the aroma, although still not great, with notes of brown bread, chocolate, oranges, and slight sour notes. Weak on flavor, aroma and most importantly alcohol. Was nice to taste the beer celebrating Yuengling's 180th anniversary. Cheers!"
"Not a bad poor, decent head retention and a foam head. Scents of burnt coffee and caramel. A bit musty, however. Also pours an oft-reddish brown color. Nice deep copper. Tastes good. A bit over-carbonated and quite light. Very crisp and smooth finish, not much bitterness, and very dry. I would never refuse one of these."
"I love Yuengling, probably more than I should but I was glad when I heard they were bringing the Bock back. I had it, last year or the year before and I enjoyed it. My palate has radically changed since then with my discovery of all types of beer. Sadly, I rate this Yuengling Brew nothing more than average."
"This is a decent beer for putting down when working in the garage, but seemed underwhelming to me. It also tastes more like an amber ale than a bock. Would not seek out again."
"SIDE NOTE: I've heard whispers that Yuengling Bock is merely another Black & Tan style of beer; this time a mixture of Yuengling Traditional Lager with Yuengling Porter or the Black & Tan. In my opinion, Yuengling would do better to create an authentic Bock. Still, if you're a Yuengling fan (and I'm one), not a bad seasonal change-up from the year-rounds."
"D: I like this a bit more than the Amber because of the stronger flavor. Black and Tan overtakes this though and Lord Chets, isn't as expensive and seems a better choice. Hey, I'm a Y! homer."
"All in all this beer is worth a try. I also just found out it is a spring beer so that's pretty cool i guess."
"Great retro art-deco label with a goat dinking from a goblet. Amber brown with a very thin head that quickly dissipated. Has that traditional pretzely malt bock smell. Taste is pronounced pretzel malt/bread crust w/ just enough hop to bitter. Finishes dry but not astringent. Mouthfeel's a bit watery for the style. Also a bit creamy which was pretty good. Not bad at all for a $7.00/6pk beer."
"Drinkability was good at first then the characteristic of the beer went down hill as it warmed. This is an average bock at best and not one of Yuengling's finest."
"D - a good adventure, but I can't help feel something is off. label says ""Tastes Good", which I can't argue with, but toning it down a little might help things out. this is a lager, after all. other bocks I've had aren't quite as bossy"
"Overall: Good beer overall. I like Yuengling Traditional Lager from time to time, but this is a better beer from the same brewer. This could become a go-to cheap beer for me. It's not world class by any means, but it's worth trying if only because it's cheap."
"D- Fairly drinkable. I'd choose it over other brews from Pottsville, PA. Definitely beats the porter and the amber lager."
"The six I bought was enough."
"D - Very easy to drink with a very reasonable ABV. Is it a fantastic bock? No...but I certainly won't have any trouble finishing the six pack."
"D: Sure, it's drinkable, but there are so many better examples of bocks out there."
"I tried, but could not get excited about this one."
"Got session?"
"I ran across this interesting find in my go to beer store here in MD. Being born and raised in PA I was astonished to find a Yuengling brew that I had yet to sample. This was the start and the end of my happiness with regard to this beer. It pours slightly darker then there traditional lager. There is little to no overpowering aroma upon initial investigation. I took my first sip and was immediately surprised; however, in an unpleasant way. WHERE IS THE TASTE? I was expecting something akin to a doppelbock, but what I got was something much less. I feel that in the world of bargain beer, Yuengling has shown through and produced a fairly good lager. Entering this tasting with that in mind was a poor idea. I feel that this was a half hearted attempt at capturing the ever growing craft beer market. Yuengling family, please stick to what you are good at and not wonder off the beaten path. I am unfortunately not looking around anymore to find new concepts from this brewery."
"Not a terrible beer for the price, but I'm not overly impressed."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D- Very easy to drink bock. Light for this syle so it goes down fast."
"Pours a nice moderate brown color with a bit of a tan head. The nose brings a good deal of caramel as well as a bit of toffee and light hops. The taste is confined to caramel and bread, bit is still nice. Medium body with good carbonation. Pretty tasty and a great value."
"not for me but it is worth a try."
"D - This is a pretty good beer overall I wasn't expecting to be blown away but I was definitely pleased with this beer this is one that I could drink all night worth trying sometime"
"A basic bock but that is not neccesarily a bad thing. Brown color with a large head that had very good retention. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Good caramel aroma but there is some metallic coming in as well. Caramel flavor upfront, followed by copper pennys. A little toasted. The body is just too thin. No substance and by far the weakest element of this beer. A decent beer that I believe comes in a very attractive price point. Not the best bock by far, but worth a try."
"This was an ok bock, I though it was a bit too thin and the citrus was a little out of balance. It seemed like it was like a Lager with double the malts and double the citrus."
"Overall, this is a solid offering from America's Oldest Brewery. Although I've found their product a bit lacking in quality over the past 10 years (due to expansion), this is a solid bock...not what I was expecting."
"D: Very good! This is an interesting beer and, to my mind, one of the best beers made by Yuengling brewery. Recommended."
"Best beer Yuengling makes"
"D- A lackluster bock beer from the oldest brewery in America. I have only had one of these so I'll update if needed. Thanks Justin once again cause I really wanted to try this beer out!"
"D: Very good - could have a few of them without a problem"
"D - Meh. No thanks. There are so many great bocks out there, this one is not worth repeating."
"Drank alright, would take this over say a shiner bock, but still nothing to get worked up about. Drink ice cold for better drinkability IMO"
"D: Very drinkable, nice mix of the flavors and not too high abv makes it pretty session-able as well."
"The smell was very earthy and clean. No skunk or bitterness. Tasted great. Again very clean to the palate with no real aftertaste and a little watery but very tasty. This beer was not an ""In your face"" beer. Very laid back and different. I am not a fan of Yuengling Black and Tan and can barely drink a Yuengling Traditional. Its a different change in pace for a college kid throwing back miller lite and keystones all the time. I am a mainstream macro kinda guy.. and this was a delicious beer. The mouth feel was again not in your face and the drink ability was fair.. maybe a little heavy. I think that 1 or 2 of these would be good with a nice dinner or calm night. Its a good beer to cherish and drink for taste. I will definitely be seeing this beer again in my future and I will recommend it to those who want to break out of the Macro League. Its definitely different but a good different."
"If you can get by the mediocre taste, it drinks fine and has a nice lighter mid body."
"Good beer! I liked it very much. I am going to pick up some more next time I go to the store. It's just a nice change, a little darker a little richer, kind of like a stronger Yuengling Porter. If you are in the mood for it, it will taste even better!"
"Good to see Yuengling brewing some different stuff..."
"I'm not going to go into details, but I was quite surprised when I had this beer. It's unbeatable for the price. I got it at Andy Gavin's in Scranton, PA. $1.50 for a pint, or $6.00 for a pitcher. Unbeatable price and it tastes surprisingly good!!"
"Continuing the bock mini-kick, the Celebrator glass (after a nice rinse) welcomes the characteristic amber brown of the Yuengling Bock. The sweet, caramel- and toffee-loaded nose also reaches par. Things go downhill once the tongue insists on getting involved. Now, call me crazy, but I expected something akin to the nose (and every other bock ever brewed). Unfortunately, what hit me was some strange combination of leather and flat cola. This isn't to say that the brew was flat; indeed, it was not overly effervescent, but carried enough bubbliness to get by. Rather, it had the same flavor that a flat cola would have following about an hour in the car during some sunny July afternoon. Am I a fan? Nope. The rest of the brew worked out fine: a nice, smooth feel with a fairly dry, but still somewhat pleasant finish. If only that unsatisfactory taste hadn't been there..."
"Overall a nice, inexpensive lager. It's not watery, but it's also not a big malt or hop bomb. Almost a session beer, but just a bit too strong."
"Drinkability: I'm liking this beer as a possibility for having again and for entertaining friends who think they don't like beer. I'm looking forward to next year and having this again."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Nothing special perhaps, but certainly worth a yearly visit."
"Drinkability: Meh, not bad. Flavors are alright, doesn't sit heavy and the ABV is certainly more than manageable, but overall, it's a pretty average-at-best offering."
"Not bad, tastes alot like a bigger version of Yuengling Lager. Not really what I would consider a great beer, but it is a nice alternative to BMC products"
"Not bad at all -- I can tell it's in the same family as Yuengling Lager & I like that, but it has its own character. Very drinkable, good for sessions."
"This ""small"" bock is really nicely priced,I think a good value.Poured a rich amber with a nice creamy-like one finger head that settled into a creamy mass.Mainly caramel in the nose,slight roast as well.Flavors are caramel accented with some roasted nut notes,a sweetish bready malt flavor comes in as well.Not bad,its modest but decent in my mind."
"MD- I have been wanting to try this for a while and was looking forward to it coming out this year. Turns out it is okay but really nothing special. It's a good beer for the price, and it really is an easy drinker."
"A nice beer from yuengling."
"Yuengling, America's oldest brewery with an old world style, bock,. Let's give it a whirl. Popping the bottle top reveals a fresh malty smell with a hint of black licorice. Poured into a pint glass the brew has a dark root beer color with a big multi-sized bubble head. Taste is starts out slightly metallic, then has a bitter maltiness that continues metallic and hints of black licorice come through. The beer has good body and the carbonation is good. The flavor is spot on for a bock. The metallic taste drops the flavor rating a bit. All in all a bargain beer for the price."
"D - Personally I'm a fan of Yuengling's flagship lager, but I don't feel that they did as a good a job with the bock. Nice to see them branching out, but I think they missed the mark on this beer."
"Ran across this at the local beer shop and had never seen it before. Pours a nice dark red color with 1 finger of head that fades with chunky lacing. The aroma has some pronounced toasted notes with some buttery undertones and a slightly sour smell in the background. Could also be described as slightly dishrag-like. The taste starts out a little underwhelming and then builds in some toasted malt flavor before become more roasted and drying on the finish, which is slightly lingering. Just a tiny hint of some piney hops toward the end and a decent, medium body. A decent bock."
"This poured a clear dark mahogany with light tan head. It smelled like bready yeast and roasted barley, with some lemon and copper hops and caramel malt. It tasted like lemon and copper hops with bready yeast and dirty barley and light caramel malt. It was watery with lots of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was an unimpressive beer with too much hops and not enough malt. The flavor wasn't very clean, and the body was too bubbly and thin. This wasn't a very good example of the style, and isn't recommended. (Although it honestly wasn't offensive to drink, so I could easily finish my bottle. It was just boring and wasn't what I look for in a bock.)"
"D. A good brew nothing outstanding here, but a decent brew nonetheless ."
"BUT... MAYBE THINGS HAVE CHANGED ."
"Drinkability overall is solid for what it is, a throwback ""bock"" beer from Yuengling is a welcome addition to their bottled lineup. I had it on tap last season when they first re released it. A beer that I will definitely enjoy again in the future, it's more interesting than most other macros out there trying to brew something different."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a 1/2"" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry pilsner and crystal malt scent along with a slightly metallic aroma. The taste is decent as well. It has a bone dry pilsner malt taste with a slight roasted/caramel character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is your basic bock beer. It's easy drinking with non-offensive."
"Good beer from yuengling though not amazing."
"Drinkability: its light and somewhat easy to drink, although I have to say I expected something with more flavor, I understand why Yuengling wanted to maintain their recognizable taste, but I think they could have made a much better bock than what I have sitting before me."
"drinkability: not good, wouldnt try again but certaintly not the worst beer in the world."
"The label is really cool, just wish they had used some better quality adhesive!"
"Yuengling Bock is a very clear and sparkling copper lager with a bubbly khaki head that leaves solid sheets of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a touch sweet and pretzely. Smells kind of like malt extract. It smells like brewing beer and baking pretzels. It's medium light bodied and pretty lively. The finish is a little gritty, but pretty clean. It has a malty, pretzely flavor. There's a nice toastiness to it. There's a touch of caramel and maybe even chocolate. A soft slightly herbal bitterness zips it up. This beer was a pleasant surprise."
"Overall Impression: Yuengling is America's oldest brewery and they have been around 180 years, making them almost as old as Herr Rick (He is immortal ya know!) So I have a lot of respect for the brewery itself, it just is a weak beer for the style. Just not for me. But someone who is on a tight budget may consider this beer before moving up the ladder to ""actual"" Doublebocks!"
"Overall, a style well-represented by Yuengling. A bit lighter than other Bocks I've had, but a good try nonetheless."
"-Bye"
"This beer surprised me for some reason. I'm not tradtionally a big fan of bocks, but I think this one will make me seek more out in the future. Just another solid beer from Yuengling."
"Pours a crystal clear brown color with loose tan head that settles into a sparse cap. The aroma has some standard grainy sweetness, perhaps a touch of caramel and metallic notes. Not sure if I am digging the aroma too much. The taste is quite neutral, leaning on the grainy sweetness. Not much, if any, flavor from the darker malts. As with the aroma there is a metallic twang towards the end. Perhaps some tea like flavors. The feel is light with fizzy carbonation; finishes with what seems to be a grassy hop bitterness, though not strong. A very average bock at best. It looks the part but lacks the depth of flavors. The body and overall feel seems off."
"Medium body that barely stands up to the bock name"
"As a history teacher I appreciate Yuengling's status as the oldest brewery. As a Philadelphian, I've drank more than my share of their Lager. I applaud Yeungling any chance I get. They're the best thing going in Pottsville."
" Actually, I saw the Bock at another store so I bought 2 sixers. One for me and another for sharing. If these seasonals are still sitting on the shelves then I should continue to buy them, fo rfear that the store will not re-order."
"Pours a very nice shimmering brown with some decent head and lacing. Nice crisp malt scent, fairly thick with a hint of lager skunk. Excellent taste, very deep for a bock, with nice dark malt flavors, a nice sweetness, and a hint of caramel. Goes down extremely good. A great bock, and the best for its cost."
"* Extra points on both appearance and drinkability for the label featuring a goat drinking beer from a goblet, with the tagline ""Tastes Good""... that really turns me on."
"I only bought a single and didn't check the price of a sixer, but I could easily see this replacing the Lager as my go-to cheap beer."
"It was very easy to drink and could easily session this one. I was quite impressed with this brew and would love to drink it again"
"I guess this is better than the lager or premium, but it's not a beer I would care to drink any more of. One bottle is plenty."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: Very high drinkability: medium malt background and a light crisp finish paired with a low abv makes this a great session beer."
"Maybe my taste buds just were overpowered by the many other dark beers I'd tried in the past. Straight up, I was pleasantly surprised that I really enjoyed this beer from start to finish. I wouldn't try to predict how those committed dark beer aficionados may or may not appreciate Yuengling's Bock, but from the standpoint of a now casual/seasonal dark drinker, this one may fit the bill for drinkers who were previously turned off by darker beers. The major challenge for me now, someone please correct me if I'm wrong, is that it's limited release is only for a few more weeks, then it won't be available again until next January."
"This is a little hoppier than most bocks, but I certainly wouldn't say it was a hoppy beer. An interesting roasted flavor makes it worth trying, but it's not exactly outstanding by any means."
"This is a mediocre bock at best, and I would actually classify it as a disappointment. Yuengling makes quality beer at a great pricepoint, and I buy Lager and Black and Tan with some regularity, but this one comes up a bit short. There are much better bocks out there even at this pricepoint - Stegmaier for example is quite a bit better."
"I will not buy again."
"Overall expecting a bit more. Too bad."
"A sweet caramel, malt, and toffee aroma and flavor carries with it a bit of toast or light roast. Smooth malty mouthfeel is a pleasant welcome. American hops give some citrus (grapefruit, pine, and grass) give the beer a pro-bitter balance, pale ale flavor. Both type and intensity is not common for Bocks, neither is the roast. But the beer is flavorful and bold with good textures and an overall favorable beer drinking experience. Maybe an Amber Ale is a better descriptor."
"I wanted more malt, but then, I always want more malt. This one is solid, and a great change of pace from the usual rotation of Yuengling brews. I hope they start doing more seasonal brews."
"Taste - Perhaps more strongly hopped than most bocks, which traditionally are not strongly hopped. Pleasantly light malt flavor that is closest to maple and slightly cocoa. Taste lingers in mouth."
"Pours a filtered clear dark amber with a slightly off white head that leave some lacing. Aromas are typical of a lager: apple along with some dark fruit character from the caramel malts. The taste is bready up front with a slight herbal hop balance but dies a bit in the finish. The mouthfeel is not what I expect from a bock, but it is still decent for what it is. All in all nothing is surprising about this beer, but it is still a solid brew."
"VERY glad to see this one back after so many years!"
"Overall, this is a good offering from yuengling. Definitely better than their traditional lager this is not the best beer ive ever had but it is definitely enjoyable and easy to drink"
"D: Even though it is heavy bodied. I have no problem drinking a few of these."
"D: I'm fairly impressed by this offering from Yuengling. I was a little concerned this would just be a darker version of their traditional lager, but this has a little character."
"Yuengling Bock pours a dark clear brown with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There's a malty aroma that's fairly nice. THe flavor is malty at first, then some hops and grain flavors come to the surface. A decent beer, but really nothing special."
"A good easy drinking brew, nothing to write home about though."
"This is a highly drinkable brew that is very easy going."
"An easy-drinking bock with a nice character and relatively mild abv for style."
"Pours a dark translucent mahogany with a decent beige head. What I got was not thick, but that is probably an artifact of preparing the pint. Aroma is malty and slightly spicy, not too strong. Flavor is rich, malty and yeasty with woody and toffee hints. Fizzy and lively texture leaves a nice tingle behind."
"D: Heavier that I expected."
"d: I'm absolutely stunned by how good this is. I'm definitely getting more of this."
"I've only had this brew once, I'm not sure how much it cost. If it's the same price as Traditional Lager I would pick up a case. Not the most impressive dark lager but not bad. Decent for a macro brew."
"Drinkability- I will have to try this again but I have to say as of now I found this particular bottle to be pretty much down right bad, didnt taste like anything i would have expected for the style of a bock, just missed the mark on all points and I usually find yuengling stuff to be a nice deal, hmm give another try but not good"
"D - goes down nice and easy."
"I had this last spring on draft at the brewery and they said they were going to bottle it this year I am very glad they did. Love the 1940's Label with the Goat drinking beer and saying tastes Good! I recomend if you can get some to give it a try they have done a great job making this one. I have stocked up with 3 cases!"
"dark amber in appearance with lacing that goes away quickly. a bit tart with a nice bite at the end. a very drinkable beer. little sad i didn't try this beer last year since alot of people say last years batch was better"
"Love the awsome artwork for the lable!"
"CHEERS!!"
"Drinkability: maintains the traditional appeal that you would expect from Yuengling, yet is also an enhanced, more developed taste."
"Good job Yuengling, and look forward to future endeavors."
"Yuengling has stepped up and bottled this seasonal beer and I am impressed with the quality for price of the Bock beer. I payed 7.00 in PA for a six pack of really good beer. I have had better bocks but not for a little over a dollar a bottle."
"Drinkability: Apparently, it's been nearly forty long years since ole Yuengling produced a bock. I found it to be not only easily drinkable and reasonably sessionable, but a decent bargain at six bucks a six-er."
"Taste is first of some hop bitterness followed mellow sweetness, and some slightly astringent fizzyness. Slightly too bitter for style, but highly drinkable nonetheless."
"if ANYTHING, i'd be glad to drink this in place of the lager. year round."
"Taste is malt. There is a little hop bite on the end, but it's not that big. If you've had a Yuengling Lager, it's like that but a little more intense malt and a little more hops."
"A fine beer for sure, the best from this brewer I've had."
"Nice coppery sort of color. Decent head that fades all to quickly. Bready aroma-somewhat nutty as well. Slight coppery/metalic tinge to it. Ok malty flavor-again a metallic presence detracts from the over all flavor. Mild caramel like flavor. Ok mouthfeel-lacks the malt body of a decent bock. Ok overall-nothing really stands out for me. Give me a regular Yuengling lager over this."
"Dr. Yes, I like this stuff. Not as good as their Porter or B&T, but good. The goat is a nice touch, too."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells is rather mild, some malts. Taste is malty, a touch of chocoalte, a slight bitterness at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth. Overall this is a pretty good brew."
"MF&D - A little on the thin side (Watery) and lacking in any real body. Went down easy enough. Not the best, but not bad for the $6.99 price tag."
"D: I could easly drink alot of these and not relise it and now this year you can get it in cases so i will for sure be buying alot of this if its still around in april im going to take a bunch on my fishing trip."
"This is more Shiner Bock than Anchor Bock overall. You could kick back with this, but you won't get a kick of flavor with this beer."
"D: A very low alcohol bock, I'd be happy sipping on this on a breezy spring day. Next time, I'll get it locally rather than drive to Ithaca."
"Drinkability: Pretty average overall. Everything's a bit too mild and tone-down on overall flavor. Maybe a hoppier, thicker Yuengling in a way. I was a bit disappointed overall, as I was excited to try this and was let down a bit."
"Drinkability: nicely quaffable but more than a few of these may wear thin on you. Worth trying since this seems to a be a one off beer."
"Got this at a block party, on tap into a plastic cup. This so far has been my favorite offering by Yeungling. As in their other beers it's far from perfect but it's adeep dark brew, not much going on in the smell, but some malt, same with the taste had an odd bite to it, nothing really off or unpleasant. I like darker beers, even on a hot day and this hit the spot though. Average, not to style IMO but plenty drinkable."
"I actually like the idea of Yuengling doing a seasonal selection. It's much overdue. I think this one was a bit off kilter but I think there is a good chance that improvements could be made with this one. I also like the/my idea of a possible ""Festbier"" from the folks at Yuengling. I believe they could capitalize on that one during the Fall season with their signature lager yeast."
"Drinkability: this beer is decent. nothing unique about it, just a standard, everyday bock."
"D - It's nice to try something new from Yuengling...I'm glad they came out with this Bock...nothing special but it was pretty tasty"
"There's a desperate need of alcohol here, as it tastes a good bit like Goya Malta, or some other similar travesty. No phenols, no doughy feel, very noticeable corners cut. A very piss poor attempt. :|"
"d: very drinkable, great session bock"
"Had on tap at the Gin Mill in Ellicottville NY on 4-15"
"On tap at Coopers in Scranton at the front bar. Presented in a shaker ""pint"" glass, this bock appears a clear, rich deep chestnut color with about half an inch of creamy light tan foam. Smells and tastes of sweet caramelized malt, biscuits, and a hint of molasses and an even smaller hint of brown sugar. This beer is all about the malt. Medium in both body and carbonation. It's nice to try something new from Yuengling. I'm sure I'll be seeing plenty of this around, and that's a good thing. Especially at a place with limited choices."
"Overall- A bit light on the flavors but well balanced and definitely sessionable. I would say this is better than their lager!"
"D-Hey, a ""new"" beer from Yuengling! While this one wont blow you away it certainly has enough flavour and smoothness to make it worthy of a pint or two, The price point is right to make it even more interesting...a decent beer for the price."
"D - Decent enough bock and a good, inexpensive session beer with enough flavor to warrant more than one in a single sitting. It's nice to see something other than Lager on tap at the local establishments."
"Very high drinkability. This is a ""good beer for the masses."" It'll be hard to NOT like it. Crowd-pleaser."
"D- 5.10% is low but I would only go for two before moving on. Either way it's a nice to have a alternative to the regular yuengling when your at a average run of the mill bar. There is a place for this but could use some more ABV for the style and a bigger body."
"Overall a very tasty and well made bock. Bravo. I look forward to many more of these."
"D. Yuengling dials in a winner here. Excellent brew, and better than the rest of the Yuengling line, which is not too shabby. Would buy cases of this."
"Frankly I'm not surprised, but this turned out to be a very bland beer. It was clean both in that there were clearly no flaws, but that the flavor profile is similar to that of water. There is a pleasant kiss of spicy hops in the aftertaste, but consider that's all my tongue could pick up, the hops are really the only taste. The beer reminds me a bit of bland ""spring ales"" or a watery copper ale."
"This is a very good session beer. Unlike the Lager this is unlike any of the Yuengling's I've had in the past.You can easily have a six pack."
"Mouthfeel was medium body with only a little more presence than Yuengling's lager offering. Drinkability is good, a few of these would go down easy, not sure that I'd stick with this one however."
"I was able to give this brew a try last evening while at Mahars. Had a darker amber color to it with some reddish highlights, good sized head that had nice long retention and lacing. The aromas where good, they highlighted a nice roasted and caramel scent. The flavor brought this beer up a notch as I felt that the malts where better here than even the profile from the nose. Also a nice hop flavor presence is there, muted in the background but plays nicely. Overall this is a very good brew, I would have to say by far the best that I have had from Yuengling and hope that this will not just be a one and done style from them."
"Had a draft at Max's Tuesday the 3rd. This was not an impressive beer. Not much of a nose and the flavor was fair with little finish. It does go down pretty easy, though. It's hard to believe that it's a blend of two decent beers, the Chesterfield and the Porter, according to Don Russell. It would seem like more Chet than Porter; maybe 2 to 1. I have the feeling that this will go better with the regular Lager crowd."
"M + D: Moderate carbonation over a medium body... it's got a little bit of 'delayed weightiness' towards the finish. All in all, a pretyh tasty and easy going beer. I'm quite pleased with this, and have to give kudos to Yuengling. Worth checking out."
"Just missed salesman who dropped off sample at local club. did'nt have a chance to quiz him on the details. Bottle was a quart size growler looking vessel.Had pint sample. Taste and appearance very nice just as good or better than Shiners or others of this style. Like to explore further samplings."
"A recommended try on a new style from an established brewer; America's oldest. Chalk this one up along with Yuengling's other under-rated styles: Black & Tan and Porter."
