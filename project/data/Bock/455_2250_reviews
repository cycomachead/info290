"o: a nice dark lager packed with tasty dark malt flavours"

"A good entry in the bock category."
"I do dare say, It's been some time since I've had one and  need to get more in stock for winter !!!!!"

"Enjoy"

"Overall, a nice beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
""
""
"A good balanced malty bock beer, bit on the sweet side and not a lot of complexity, but works as a fairly tasty session beer, would have again, but not something I found all that interesting. Warms nicely."

""
"Overall - A tasty bock, I'm glad I tried, however it was a slight letdown after viewing the beer before trying it. Still another good entry from one of Ontario's best and most prolific craft brewers."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I've only had one other offering from Creemore Springs (their Kellerbier) which I enjoyed as well. They brew proof that lagers aren't just for BMC drinkers. Would I drink it again? Sure, but I'd be more interested in trying their other offerings."

"O - One of my go to beers. I enjoy the bitterness it leaves you with. A great beer for after a long day of school and studying."
""

"O: This is a great Bock. I look forward to this time of year every year to be able to have a few of these."

"O - A great example of the style, loads of flavour, easy drinking and at 6% a nice ale for a cloudy autumn day... Or in my case a rainy spring afternoon. I would toss back a 6-er of this no problem."
"O- Creemore puts out a quality brew, this one is by far my favorite."
"Overall, this is a decent brew, though I don't know if I'd actively seek it out in the future."
"O - a tasty full bodied bock, well rounded and smooth enough to be sessionable, well done"
"M: As a lager this one has to has a medium body at the most be refreshing and actually it is, the problem is that there is not sweetness present as expected in a Buck or in a beer with high alcohol and the bitterness should be low and it is present in the end."

"Reddish brown in colour with crystal clarity. Pours with a poorly retained cap of thick beige head that doesn't lace. Mild aroma has notes of baking bread, caramel, brown sugar, and raisins. Tastes sweet and malty up front with notes of toasted bread, honey, and raisins. A mild nutty character shows up midway through, along with some tangy plum. Finishes with sweet caramel and a light bitterness that shows some linger. Medium-bodied with low carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. It's kind of deceptive, the way this has a much fuller flavour than the aroma suggests. That's not a complaint though. It's more of a pleasant surprise. Lacks a little in richness."
""
""
"Overall. Nothing complex here, just a nice malty beer that goes back easy. If I had another, it'd be gone too."
"O: A so-so offering from the Molson-owned Granville Island Brewing of the East."
""
""
"Taste and Mouthfeel - Light bodied, but a bit slick, and very strongly carbonated. Flavours of plum, lightly roasted malt, bread, and subtle bitterness."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
""
"pretty well suited for this cold ass ""fall"" afternoon -15 feels like Winter too me but I do live in Calgary, I might get board of a 6 pack but the 2 pint sized cans in the Creemore Winter mixer looking pretty good with some other offerings to mix things up"
"Final Grade: 3.82, a B+."
"D: A good, to-style Bock that isn't very complex, but still plenty tasty and drinkable."
"Overall another decent brew from creemore, like the kellerbier this is not my stle yet I found it very drinkable"
"Brownish ruby copper colour, 1.5 fingers of tan head, good amount of lace. Smell is malty and nutty, good portion of that creemore yeastiness, caramel and toffee notes. Taste is similar to the nose nutty with a big malty profile, light alcohol, mildly bitter, really pleasant finish of caramel and toffee, lightly sweet finish. Med carbonation, lightly creamy, medium body. Quite nice overall, I enjoy this quite a bit even though its probably not the best stylistically."
"Although bock is not my favourite style, I view this as a decent example of it i.e. similar to many pints enjoyed in Germany. Very glad Molson's continues to let Creemore brew without interference..."
"Overall: I started out not really liking it but warmed up to it. Still, i wasn't really impressed with it per se."
"Another good offering from Creemore."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, its good, easy drinking, but seemed to be a little on the flat side."
"Very drinkable-if I could change one thing, I wish it was a wee bit heavier."
"I like this smooth dark lager, and would definitely have another. Not the best bock I've had, but not the worst either."
"Libation: I must admit this seems to have a undertone of Creemore's best offering, their Premium Lager. This is a nice, flavorful Bock with some interesting aspects. Drinkable? Yes. Memorable? No."
"Pours a rusty red, with a few fingers of thick and creamy eggshell head. Leaves some lace and retains its head well. Nose has some earthy hops, light grain, and a general sense of the malt sweetness. Nothing exciting here, and the taste proves this. Some of the hops upfront, light toffee and caramel notes, and some graininess. Alcohol isn't disguised, and that a disappointment at relatively low ABV. However, its got a decent creamy mouthfeel. Not a ton of flavour going for this one, simple and straightforward. Medium drinkability."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are passable but far from noteworthy."
"This beer also has some nice warming qualities, making it a great seasonal choice. Another quality product from a great brewery and frankly one I'd enjoy year-round if it were available."
"Drink - I'm not sure if I just got the end of a keg or something, but the beer wasn't nearly as good as it is from a can. Still an above average beer though; I'm rarely disappointed with Creemore products."
"D - This is a nice cold weather lager. A nice malty brew. I could have a few on a cold evening like tonight. Nothing really screams 'don't drink me' with this one. I've had the UrBock from Creemore a few times before and it's always been a decent brew."
"D- Easy to drink, but has a bit too much grassy flavor for me. If I had the option, I'd go with Creemore's Lager, or Kellerbier first. All of these are good options, though, and I consider Creemore Springs to be one of the better breweries in Ontario for having products that are consistently above what else is available here."
"Pours a dark amber colour with a decent creamy off-white head. Aroma is of dark and caramel malt, grassiness, with a metallic hint. Taste is again bready caramel malt, light grassiness from the hops, leading to a lightly bitter finish with just the faintest tingle of alcohol warmth. Fairly light-bodied with pleasant carbonation. This is a nice easy drinker for the cooler months."
"Pours an amber brown colour with off white head. Some lacing down the glass. Smells of toasted malt, caramel and grassy hops. Flavour has a punch of bitterness that I didn't expect, with lots of sweetness. Medium bodied carbonation. I like all of creemore's offerings."
"This beer is alright but seems to have a certain macro quality to it. Maybe I'm just imagining things but I feel it tastes like it would have been better made in smaller batches or with less filtration or something. I'm no brewer, I can't say what the culprit is. It's kind of riding just above average on all counts. In any case, it's a fairly drinkable bock, although not one I'll be buying again. Thanks for the sample, Eric!"
"Caramel and bread, dark fruits, touch of grassy hops in there, light drying finish, thin sweetness behind in there, pretty light body though it makes a really easy drinking beer. Pleasant carbonation. Nothing wowing here but a pleasant change-up from Ontario's premier lager brewers, a nice light, easy-drinking beer with a bit of pleasant malt. Not hefty, just drinkable. Going to go great with my steak this pleasant spring evening."
"A pretty decent and flavourful bock, from a consistently impressive brewery."
"Glad I picked this one up; I've been passing it by at the LCBO for too long. It's not my favorite Creemore brew, as it could have been a bit more hearty, but it's quite tasty and is going down well."
"This is a great brew and I'm glad Creemore have kept it up though I reiterate my lamentation on its lack of availability come spring."
"D: This is my firdt bock and I'm not that impressed with it thus far. It was nothing unique or defining for me. Hope to have better ones in the future. Nothing off putting - it's good to see some drinkable canadian crafts in the LCBO."
"The carbonation seemed light. Our server mentioned this was her favorite red beer, so I am left wondering if it was perhaps served too cold (it was quite cold) or if she just doesn't have the same beer tastes as I do."
"D: Balanced enough that it drinks quite easily."
"First taste is a rush of malts. Very creamy carbonation. Subsides into a balanced caramel malty bitterness. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Low carbonation is great in this beer. I've quite enjoyed this beer. Malt malt malt. OH, and caramel"
"Worth a try."
"Overall, a decent offering from Creemore, but not their best. If the body was a little heavier and flavours not as watered down, this would be hands down my favourite Creemore brew."
"Had this on tap at the WINKING JUDGE in Hamilton, Ontario. Pours an amber/rouge body with minimal head present. A little watery, but the taste was still great. Malty sweetness was what I was getting. Overall a well balanced beer which I imagine would be really nice after a hard days work."
"Final Thoughts - This beer was a bit of disappointment, mainly because of how good the Creemore Lager is. It's still pretty good, but it's not sitting very well, which is really a shame. Worth a try for sure, but I wouldn't buy a six pack of it."
"Pours a nice, deep copper. Some nice, dripping lace going on. Smell is sweet raisiny malt. Some initial bitterness at the front of the tongue is backed by slightly pruney malt. There's definitely alcohol in this. It's nicely warming. I'd like to see more malt in this though. A lot more. And just...more flavor. It seems to be missing something and it lacks depth. It has a clean mouthfeel, a little thin and almost watery. Yeah. It's drinkable, it's not horrible, but I'm a little underwhelmed. I'll happily finish the six pack I bought but this is definitely not a repeater. Too bad. I love Creemore's lager and I like their Pilsner so I expected more from this."
"There's still half a glass left in front of me and I'm not at all anxious to finish it. I didn't notice too much of a difference when Creemore was bought out by Molson's but I will say this: the once decent UrBock is now nothing more than another macro kitsch imposture peddled as a small scale take on a rich, distinct style. Whether that's a change in my tastes or a change in the production I can't say. What I do know: I won't be revisiting."
"A Christmas present from a Canadian uncle - one of the few nice offerings I've had from the Great White North. Pours a brown color with red highlights, a small head that leaves no lacing. Nose is mild maltiness, and the taste expands on it a little with some caramel and toffee, and some spicy molasses. Body's fine, appropriate to the style. Overall, not bad, but certainly not good by any means."
"Tastes of fruits, a bit of caramel malt and a whimper of alcohol. Well I am happy I was able to try it."
"Not sure how fresh this is but this is by far the best of Creemore's brews."
"I had this first in 2006 and it was amazing in every aspect, had it again in 2007 and it failed to please my senses. Nice dark red colour, nice head that disappears too fast, great malty, spicy raisin flavour and the smell I don't really remember but it was good. I would buy this one again. This beer is even better on tap."
"Definitely a drinkable beer. The scent and taste are not strong, but the lingering aftertaste is quite pleasant. Overall a pretty good brew."
"12oz bottle purchased from LCBO. Pours a clear, dark copper with a big head due to a poor pour, but the head goes away pretty quickly. Little lacing. Reasonable malty aroma. Flavour is malt - and that's about it. Finishes a bit thin. I've not much of a bock fan, and this one doesn't get me any closer to changing my mind."
"Sampled at The Cest What? Fall Festival of Beers. Nice dark russet body with an effusive white head. Caramel malt in the nose and the flavour, with a fair bit of fruitiness and grain. Surprisingly thick consistency, with a creamy aftertaste. Quite a pleasant brew from Creemore."
"First impression of the flavour is an almost overwhelming soapy note that I'm sure is just a lot of herbal hops, but comes off unpleasant. There's a slight metallic sharpness as well. It does get better though as the beer warms a little. Bready at first with some dark fruity flavours, a bit medicinal, like cough syrup in its delivery. A bit of pepper to give it some zip. Finish is earthy, potently herbal, hursky and crackery. Mouthfeel is medium-thick in body with a zippy carbonation. Drier than I expected it would be. Overall not a brutal effort, but the lack of balance in the actual flavour is a little offputting. Lots of individual elements, not enough harmony."
"Pours the colour of cherry cola, with very little foam. Smell is a bit sharp. Grain, dark and sour fruit(yet not citrus), and cut grass. Very good taste. Malty and sweet, with a bit of plum and cherry. Relatively thick, full mouthfeel. I like it, and will be buying it again. Not complex, but a good beer."
"This is still drinkable and clean but this year has a character that seems to lack a defined Bock identity...thinner than one expects in a dark bock....more like a dunkel-schwarzbier hybrid...I still bought a case"
"I like dark beers and was excited to hear that Creemore Springs makes a bock (the fact that it's a seasonal is kinda cool too). Pours a dark ruby body. There's minimal head, but the colour makes it look thirst-quenching. Some grainy, brownish lacing sticks to the glass. Smells of bready malt, red wine, prunes, and alcohol. Taste has a bold malt character with an initial alcoholic bite. The mouthfeel is pretty much what this beer is all about. Starts off with a moderately carbonated bite and goes down smooth. The aftertaste fades away quickly. This beer is nothing special but it's still drinkable. The higher alcohol content is reasonably well-hidden by a malty taste and crisp mouthfeel. Decent brew."
"Creemore Springs' urBock is a respectable brew that fails to amaze, but also doesnt dissapoint. Taste is interesting enough to appeal to a beer advocate, and even if it's nothing superbly special, it's also something I'll look forward to around the Christmas season. Worth a try, I say - but only after you've tried Creemore's excellent lager first."
"Mouthfeel is nice and full. Very mild aftertaste with no off notes. Quite drinkable, and I'm not sure which of Creemore's two main offerings I like better (although I think I'd still lean toward the other one)."
"This poured a nice dark red almost brown with a very small head that didn't last very long. Smell is good, fresh barley malt. This stuff tastes great, a caramel body with a mildly bitter finish, it's carbonation is pretty strong but not overbearing as to make it hard to swallow This stuff is dangerously easy to drink. Apparently this won't be around long, so i hope to enjoy this until the end of the season comes along."
"D: VERY drinkable. This one can be trouble!"
"This is one incredible bock. Its not overly sweet like I find so many others of the style. It has great balance and an incredibly nuanced malt character. This beer is a must try, especially if you arent big on bocks."
"Pours a mahogany red/brown, large off-white head forms, goes away rather quickly but leaves some nice lacing. Smells sweet, grassy, earthy, some citrus notes are present. Tastes pretty rich and malty, some sweetness, some floral hoppiness to the end and a smooth finish. Mouthfeel is medium full, very smooth, this one has been sitting around for a while to mellow, it gains a nice roasty/hoppy character. Decent brew for Ontario."
"Mostly clear, medium brown colour with deep coppery red highlights topped by a thin, light tan head. Rich malty aroma with some caramel sweetness that reminds me of some British ales. Some graininess and a light floral hop smell. Creamy, malty flavour that's balanced towards sweetness. Little bitterness or hop flavour with the graininess coming through here as well. Medium/full body with moderate carbonation composed of very fine bubbles that meld well with the body. There's also a bit of stickiness that remains on the palate. Not a bad beer at all... I just hope Molson/Coors decides to keep this one."
"Taste: Relatively light carbonation and taste, roasty caramel and maybe a bit buttery, mouthfeel is superior to most lagers at first, but dies off quickly."
"A very darm amber beer, who goes into the color of the wine, with no head, only a little head. Smells of caramel and malt nothing else. The taste is very smooth, maltish, flavors of roasted coffee(espresso) caramel and alcohol. A taste of chocolate is also perceivable at much, pretty sweet of a seasonal."
"Overall, this is a nice beer that will help take a bit of the chill off of the winter months."
"Now, 2004: my first thought, pulling the bottle out of the sixpack, was actually surprise at how light it was. Which makes rereading my prior review a little amusing (to me). Red-Gold honey, a limited head. It's quite crisp, with hop bite battling the bocky malt sweetness all the way through. It's rather refreshing when you put it up against all the heavy bocks around this time of year."
"Quite a tasty bock, but bocks are just not my favourite."
"Thanks to Northyorksammy!"
"This is a looker of a beer, a seductive clear chestnut hue with a quick splash of beige head. Spiced fruit on the nose, burnt malt that comes across sweet as well, with a trace of alcohol. The flavour occurs in layers: dried fruit and spice at first with a full-bodied mouthfeel, which then drops to a bold roasted malt presence in the middle, and then melds into a grassy hop finish which is more oily on the palate, blended with a sweet caramel accent. The flavours and textures take you around the block a few times, and it's a pleasant trip each time. Complex enough to keep me interested, but not something I could drink on a regular basis. Good thing it's a seasonal."
"(2005 version on tap) smooth, creamy, dry. A variation of the creemore cream."
"Tap - Copper brew with a small head. Malty aroma with a medium body. Taste is very creamy which I approved with small traced of burnt malt. Not the best of bock but still a great beer that should be made available all year long. The Creemore brewery is starting to impress me with two great german inspired brew (lager and bock)."
"Solid, unsensational beer, good with a meal. Suitable for introducing neophytes to something a little different."
"Drinkability: Above average. Nothing in this beer to remember it by, but not a burden on the palate. Having read the description of the style, I guess I expected more of a hop influence (being the hop-head that I am)."
"I guess what I am trying to say here is that this brew has all the qualities of a fine product, but needs to be critiqued by a more knowledgeable person than I......"
"The look, smell and taste of this beer left me looking for something more. It lacked a distinct flavour. A signature of its own. Maybe my opinion is skewed in part because of my love for Creemore Springs Lager. One sip of the lager, whether you're in Canada or half way across the world, and YOU KNOW it's Creemore Lager. That is the distinct impression left by that beer. But the urBock......i don't know. i was underwhelmed. This is NOT a bad beer. It is however quite ordinary."
"The beer pours a somewhat murky brown; the head is modest in size, the lace fair and clings in sheets to the glass. Nose is malt, caramel, somewhat sweet as in ripe fruit. Start is lightly malt sweet, the top is middling, the finish is piddlingly acidic, and puny in the hops arena, dry aftertaste. Not a bad drinking beer, just a little ""Wimpy"" on the hops, but then I'm a ""Hop Head""."
