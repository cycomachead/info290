3.67,-3.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a 1" head which dissipated quickly. Clear burnt umber brown in color. Smell and taste both are mildly chocolate malt, and it's followed up by a pleasant long acidic zing. Really a pretty nice Bock. What was most notable of all was the massive amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottle (must have been at least 1/4" solid thick sediment and it came out during the pour as big globs). It didn't bother me, I've just never seen so much in a bottle.","MoreThanWine","May 08, 2011"

2.97,-21.6,3.5,4,2.5,3,2.5,"D: The watery sourness drives down the drinkability of Jopen Bokbier. The bottle conditioning is generally a good thing, but the huge clumps of yeast actually detract from the experience (see hefeweizen or Cooper's Sparkling Ale for a better yeast-in-the-glass example).","speter","Mar 23, 2010"
4.54,19.8,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Jopen Bokbier is medium-bodied with medium-high carbonation for the style. Alcohol is totally masked by the heavy caramel flavor. This beer has more flavor than most doppelbocks I've had, and I would drink this regularly if I could. This has easily become my favorite bock in one beer's time.","dpasotti","Feb 22, 2010"
4.2,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D: An extraordinairy bockbeer. Has some Oatmeal Stout character in it. Very drinkable.","PapaEugene","Oct 21, 2009"
4.02,6.1,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: as mentioned by other reviewers as well, this is not a typical German Bockbeer (more ale like..). But man, is this good or what!!","rvdoorn","Oct 02, 2009"
3.74,-1.3,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Not a prime example of bock bier, but still a good beer period.","jophish17","Aug 06, 2008"
4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a very dark ruby with white chunks of sediment floating around. I guess I poured a bit too much. Nose is kind of musty with a malt tone to it and just a very slight touch of wood. Robust but mild aged dark fruit skins there as well. Flavor is a nice hearty malt with a touch of dark sugar. A little bit of wood. Feel is nice. High carbonation hitting the tongue. Thick liquid feel for sure. Overall this is an unusual bock. At least in comparison to the more traditional styles. I like it, as it is well made. It just isn't your typical example of the style.","RblWthACoz","Dec 30, 2007"
3.8,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured from a 30cl bottle ($3.00 in Detroit) into a pint glass. The appearance is murky brown, tons of large yeastie floaters, 3-finger foam which loses 2 fingers after about a minute. The aroma is bocky, sweet and malty but with a bit of a sour acidic edge to it (almost metallic). The taste is very good, with all the flavors promised from the aroma. Nicely drinkable, but not really worth the price when you can get better versions imported from Germany for cheaper prices.","TurdFurgison","Sep 10, 2007"

2.72,-28.2,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"A dark, murky color with a head that pours tall but falls fast. Aromas of dried fruit and sweet plums. First taste was a little astringent, but warmed quickly in the mouth and left nice dried cherry and peach aspects. Overall finish was kind of nutty and kind of resinous. Was a decent bok style, but a little dry in the finish.","GooberMcNutly","Jan 15, 2007"
3.12,-17.7,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Not the best of beers of Jopen, and for sure not a typical Dutch Bockbeer, but a good beer nevertheless.","Absumaster","Dec 29, 2006"

4.7,24,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"The cap poped off with a mighty blow and the head poured so big and thick that it doesn't want to go away at all. The head looks like sparkling snow in winter. The color is reddish to light brown. There's also some yeast floating around in there. The smell is powerful and woody, but sour sweet with fruitiness. The taste is nice with roasted malts. It tastes great with some sour fruit that's sweet at the same time. Mouthfeel is smooth and not harsh for all the carbonation seen earlier. I like this beer a lot and would definetly have more. Good stuff Holland!","Erdinger2003","Aug 31, 2006"
3.67,-3.2,3,3.5,4,4.5,3,"D: a toss up on this one. this beer is a lot of work to get a decent pour and finish without a spork. ill probably pass in the future but an enjoyable and educating experience.","kaimcm","May 10, 2006"

4.22,11.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This is a finely-crafted beer. I may have to reassess my earlier lack of enthusiasm for the style since the last two bocks that I've had have been good to very good. I have no trouble recommending Jopen Bokbier to lovers of the style, as well as to those who may still be on the fence.","BuckeyeNation","Apr 10, 2006"
3.55,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Very sweet malt aroma holds dates, fig, raisin and dark bread. Cloudy brown with a huge three finger thick, lasting, tan head. Sweet syrupy malt fore tastes of crusty dark rye bread, raisin, date, brown sugar, caramel and peppery spices. Mouthfeel is substantial, but a bit syrupy.","Jredner","Apr 10, 2006"
4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D; very nice brew, but more a Dubbel style beer.","Redteketed","Mar 17, 2006"
3.94,4,3,4,4,4,4,"Dude, there's like, chunks in my beer. Don't know if I should rate it a five or a one, but this is definitely interesting. Literally large, floating, totally unappatizing chunks of yeast (hopefully) swirl around in this beer. Other than that, it's a hazy reddish brown color with a small, bubbly white head with nice retention. Smell is really lively and all over the place. Big fruity malts and almost a Belgian-inspired spiceyness. Taste is much the same. Banana bread, apples and oranges, backed by a sweet maltiness. Cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and also a slight hoppy spicyness. Really interesting. Almost a tangy finish. Thought this would be a little slicker in texture due to the appearance but it's actually pretty light and jumpy on the palate. This is a crazy beer altogether, one I'll definitely be interested to try again.","twelvsies","Mar 12, 2006"
3.23,-14.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"On the light side of medium-bodied. A good beer but it gets a bit harsh as it warms up.","PorterLambic","Mar 06, 2006"
4.01,5.8,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"well this is the most unique "bock" i've ever had. quite an experience and for the most part a good one. i could do with a little less yeast though it was kind of nasty. not too big of a deal though, this beer is good where it counts.","kmo1030","Feb 27, 2006"
3.2,-15.6,4,4,3,3,2.5,"Took quite a while to finish this one as its palate barely precedes its body.","tavernjef","Nov 16, 2005"
4.4,16.1,4,4,5,4,4,"WOW!!! A fantastic toffee flavor with some hazelnut and vanilla. A very smooth graceful mouthfeel. Quite a good brew. A random happening that I shall not soon forget","guinnessman","May 10, 2005"
2.68,-29.3,4,3.5,2.5,2,2,"Dark crimson tone. Big hefty light tan head. Retention is very good. I worried about overcarbonation from the looks. Aroma is sweet and malty. Bready. But pretty subdued. My fears come to fruition when I taste this gaseous concoction of a beer. That's one of my biggest pet peaves...a gaseous mouthfeel. The flavors are not that great either. Stale bread. Must. Some malts. And some spiciness, like a little cinamon type of flavor. All in all though, this isn't enjoyable.","Bighuge","May 06, 2005"
4.24,11.9,4,5,4,4,4,"Flopping around on bursts of bubbles, the sediment in this one looked like miniature mushrooms. I wasn't enthused, but I got past it. Very spicy -- allspice or sumac or cinnamon or all of the above? Prunes, bananas, dates, and 3-day-old sugared strawberries round out a very sweet and fruity aroma. Fruit jelly, impressions of chocolate, pumpernickel bread, and...wait for it...candied apples. Pretty sweet most of the way through, this somehow manages to clean up nicely. A strange little thing but very worth your time. Smelling this is like Christmas for your nose.","marburg","May 05, 2005"
3.7,-2.4,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Not like any other bock I have tasted. Not really like anything else. Enjoyable, but confusing. Perhaps four grains are too many.","horndecker","Apr 06, 2005"
2.82,-25.6,3,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Bottle at Spuyten Duyvil 3/19/05. No dating that I can see on the bottle, but there is also a big ol white sticker stuck on the back that covers any info there. Woodsy chestnut and dark, with a lot of carbonation rising -tons of it! Totally unclear and cloudy, with a thick and creamy head that has a ton of carb rising up to it, and a lot of little pockets showing through... Very inconsistant looking said my barcrawl buddy, Geoff. Heavy spicey malts, does that make sense? Bit of molasses and karo. Heavy carbonation, champagne-like. Bit of dark malts, candi sugar flavor at the end of the sip. Not sure if this was past its prime or not, but seemed a bit off.","shapudding","Mar 20, 2005"
4.14,9.2,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This hazy brown beer has a huge foam cream colored head, so big that i would think the bottle had been shaken or something. Chunks of fishfood floating around as well. Sweet caramel candy malt for a scent. Caramel malt up front, bitter hop backbone well blended. Some hints of alcohol. Flecks of yeastie clove. Maybe some apple This brew almost has some belgian characteristics to it, not bad.","Tballz420","Nov 07, 2004"
3.38,-10.8,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Poured a hazy brown(chunks and floaties everywhere) with a huge blooming head that leaves large amounts of lace,aroma of apple cider and some brown sugar but pretty light.Taste was lighter than expected as well some nuttiness and raisin but seemed to faid quickly and quite abruptly,would get a higher rating in my book if the nice flavors upfront stayed and were expounded.Well not something I would seek out again it wasnt a bad offering none the less.","oberon","Oct 21, 2004"
4.62,21.9,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"I am impressed. Think the flavors of a grand dubbel or trappist "8" only with more of an unrelenting and certain impregnation of natural CO-2 and more fresh and boiled hops - things which contribute drinkability.","putnam","Aug 08, 2004"
3.67,-3.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Worth the $2.99 per single bottle I plunked down? Not a chance.","feloniousmonk","Aug 01, 2004"
3.73,-1.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability & Notes: Not a typical bockbier  flavorful which I give the credit for, just dont compare this one to any German counterparts.","Jason","Jun 16, 2004"
4.07,7.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"SOme brown sugar, some chocolate, and againthe apples come through. This beer is very easy to drink with no hint of the 6.5%. Quite a tasty brew, not outstanding but well worth a shot!","sulldaddy","Jun 15, 2004"
4.12,8.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a three-finger off-white,thick head that stays , leaving tons of lace; pour this one slowly. Cloudy amber color with a lot of chunky bits.

3.75,-1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Dissonant, but not unapproachable.","cokes","Dec 12, 2003"
3.2,-15.6,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"This beer pours with an explosion of foam and an extreme yeast aroma. Head is thick, soft, and very long-lived. Ruddy, earthen brown color, with bits of yeast floating throughout. Spicy, but delicate taste...flavors of melon, and malt. It's not like any bock I've ever had, but it's very tasty. The beer has a soft, full mouthfeel and a mellow, yeasty character. It's a fun beer and worth a try, but not outstanding.","Suds","Dec 05, 2003"
3.31,-12.7,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Oops! Be careful of the pour. This one gets a bit excited. It pours a muddy coffee color with a big...and I do mean BIG head. The initial aroma is...how should I phrase this? Farty? Behind the fart, there's a yeasty and earthy malty aroma, followed by hints of hops and faint alcohol. The body is slightly grainy with flavors of rye and wheat. Sweet caramel and a bit of milk chocolate become more noticeable as the glass warms. A hint of alcohol is felt in the back of the throat as you exhale. Clove, peppery spices and a light lemony bitterness remain equal to the sweet maltiness throughout. All in all, as different a sort of beer style as Limberg is to cheese.","BeerResearcher","Dec 03, 2003"
4.03,6.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A very good looking beer that has a lovely bronze body, tan head, and superior lacing. The nose is all about the malt base, but it does also give faint hints of fruit and spice. The flavor is malty sweetness with caramel pumping in as the chill subsides and releases it. A faint trace of spice and perhaps some apple notes intercede as well. Quite a nice, but filling beer.","AtLagerHeads","Sep 19, 2003"
4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This bottle-conditioned beer pours a hazy brown with some caramel highlights beneath a huge, rocky head of dense, off-white foam. The head retention is excellent and it maintains a solid 1/4" cap throughout the entire glass. Additionally, it leaves some very nice wide streaks and webs of lace. The nose reveals a touch of sugary caramel, some light fruitiness, and some spicy hops. It's zesty in the mouth with a very fine, effervescent carbonation and light/medium body. (I wonder if this bottle isn't a bit old; and it's fermented out a bit more than it normally should be). The flavor is malty with a caramelized-sugar edge, some delicate fruitiness, some herbal and spicy hops; and it's well-balanced with a firm bitterness. It finishes dry with some lingering candyish, caramel and chocolate malt peppered with leafy and spicy hop flavors. Quite unique, and similar to a cross between a German bokbier and a Belgian dubbel.","NeroFiddled","Aug 07, 2003"
