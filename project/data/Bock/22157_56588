4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle, this most excellent bock from Rivertown pours a beautiful amber with a thick off white soapy foam and clinging lacing.  Nose of browned toast, raisin, light herbal hops, and sweet caramel malts.  Flavors follow the nose with rich caramel and fresh bread like notes, mixed with a pleasant nutty characteristic and mild herbal hop in the background.  One of the better bocks I have had this year.  SOLID.","Brutaltruth","Nov 04, 2014"

3.56,1.1,4,3,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy reddish copper color with a small dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, green apple, raisin, plum, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with solid complexity and decent balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. A bit too estery with green apple on the nose. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, raisin, fig, plum, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, raisin, fig, plum, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this a nice Bock style. Good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. If the nose wasnâ€™t overly estery this definitely would have scored a bit higher. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 25, 2014"

3.14,-10.8,3,3.25,3.25,2.75,3,"While not bad, this beer needs a heftier mouthfeel, more carbonation, and a little more hop presence to stave off the presence of the sweetness.

It had a nice dark amber color, slightly ruby. Didn't pour it aggressively, but it still had a nice foamy head, Ok lacing. Will buy again! Good job Rivertown!","BigPauly","Feb 25, 2013"

A real treat to run into, we can really appreciate the deft hand(s) it took to create this malt bomb.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 16, 2013"

3,-14.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a clear gold/amber color with a small white head. Not what I expected this one to look like. Aroma of toasted malt and dark fruit, maybe molasses. Flavor of sweet malts, grains, grassy? Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a grainy mouthfeel. Not the best bock. Rivertown is starting to show up in my area, so I hope some of their other offerings are better than this one.","beergod1","Apr 28, 2012"
3.11,-11.6,2,3.5,3,3.5,3,"A rather disappointing offering from a local brewery. Not bad, just nothing to write home about. I won't buy this again. It cannot even sit on the same shelf as a classic like HB Maibock.","deadonhisfeet","Apr 22, 2012"

4,13.6,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"O- I like this bock because of its different taste, seems lighter that traditional bocks. Says it has a 7.2% ABV but there is no alchol taste. The fruit taste doesn't appear until the beer is 1/2 gone. I think I'll have another!","edfish","Feb 03, 2012"

3.65,3.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a caramel-amber color with a thin, mocha head. The nose is malty sweet of darker notes with figs and dates, caramel and molasses. The taste follows suit and starts out very sweet, transitions to bitter just to balance and then there is a lingering of toasty, bready malt on the finish. Mouthfeel is lighter in body than I would normally expect but the carbonation is almost perfect. Overall, a drinkable beer, not bad but not memorable either.","gmfessen","Dec 29, 2010"
3.38,-4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a pint glass, this beer is a hazy mahogany with a half inch of white that lasts a couple minutes then falls back into the beer. The smell is a bit of malt but I'm mostly getting a dimethyl sulfide (corny) smell which I know can be a problem with lagers. The taste also has a bit of that DMS taste and is a little fruity as it warms. The malt and hints of banana comes out after a while. The mouthfeel was a little stinging on the back of my tongue and didn't really beg for another drink. It doesn't look like I had much nice to say about this beer but it wasn't that bad. Bock isn't one of my favorite styles to start with but this isn't a bad beer, just kind of uninteresting.","ltjska04","Mar 27, 2010"
2.73,-22.4,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a medium body with good carbonation. The beer was a little sweet for my taste. Not bad but I think I will pass on more of this Bock.","nlmartin","Mar 19, 2010"
