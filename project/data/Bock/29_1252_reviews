"A decent bock. A higher IBU, say like a 30 or 40 would've made it much more satisfying."

"friend ordered for me at the Anna Maria oyster bar, not sure if from tap or bottle. Nice color, absolutely no foam, no lacing etc. smell is pleasant enough, malty but slightly vinegar like. malty slightly fruity flavor, no hop flavors discernable at all, lightly watered down, very little carbonation. overall is an option for sure when out places that don't offer better selections, definantly drinkable, especially over some of the other ab junk."

"Not very good. Would only drink if there was nothing else"
""
"Had this brew as private labeled Ug's Chug in the Florida Keys. Decent brew, but not a real reflection of a Bock"
"No ""Beer Snob"" review here. Bottom line is.....you will love it. Winter time beer of choice for me. Stick to your ribs taste. Similar to a Marzen so you can drink like it's Oktoberfest all year long."

"This one was a sacrificial lamb left in my beer fridge after mopping the floor with one of my friends at the poker table. Seeing as how Michelob was a gateway beer for me, (ala Killians, Heineken, etc) I had to give it a go again for nothing other than nostalgia. The bottle pours in to a fluted glass with a sudsy vanilla head atop a translucent walnut brown lager. The head settles quickly in to a thin layer of foam with an appealing collar. It has an appetizing appearance, I'll give it that. The nose is fairly subdued, with a malty smell and fruity undertones. A bit of copper-like aroma as well. It's a slightly more sophisticated fragrance than Bud. Typical AB flavor profile with a beefed up malt presence and a bit of toffee sweetness. Slight fruitiness through the middle with no discernible hop character and only a hint of any balancing bitterness. Some lingering corn flavor and only the faintest suggestion of toasted malts in the finish. This is billed as 100% malt, but the aroma/flavor certainly lead one to believe that there are some adjuncts in the mix. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, with a light, slick body. Gulpable, crisp and refreshing. An easy quaff that's pretty clean. Is it a bock? No. It's a pig with lipstick. However, just because I can pull out the common threads from lesser beers like Bud, doesn't mean that it's a bad beer. I rather enjoyed it. It's a dark American lager . Basic, but better than most beer enthusiasts would have you believe. Now, bring back that signature Michelob bottle!"
"I didn't expect much out of this, and it met those expectations."

"cheap taste, cheap price beer"
"Good malty beer with a little roast, chocolate & caramel."
""
""
""
"Overall: nice, easy drinking beer that should pair well with many foods."
""
"Expensive at the bowling, nothing special"
""
"The Best thing that comes out of the Michelob Family."

""

"Overall: not quite as bad a beer as I had been led to believe, but really it was just a bit boring. Perhaps it was intended as a half-way between standard low-taste lagers and a German style Bock? Whatever the case, it is not a great compromise."

"Michelob AmberBock brewed by Anheuser-Busch with an ABV of 5.2%  This brew pours a nice brown color with a nice white head. The smell is rich with grains and malts. There also some sweetness in the smell. The taste is bold with flavor.  There is a lot going on in this brew. Nice taste of grains and malts. There is nothing over powering in this brew. Michelob AmberBock has a nice balance to it.  The mouthfeel is nice and clean.  This is a real refreshing brew,Anheuser-Busch did a nice job with this one. Overall I'm giving this brew a  4.5 out of 5. I would buy this brew again."

"Dark amber color with decent head and retention. Malt forward with the taste and smell and a slightly rich feel with little carbonation.  An okay beer."
"resemblance to that."
"Looks good in the glass - like an amber. But almost no taste, bitterness or hop character. Not sure what makes it a ""bock.""  For the same price you can get far superior Full Sail ESB or Amber, or many other decent offerings. Pass."
""
""
""
""
"Took a chance on it since the store I stopped at didn't have shiner bock. Good tasting beer smells of floral and caramel notes. Not as good as shiner but a lot smoother and easier to drink than some bocks. Can taste the caramel and corn tastes. No skunk to it. Goes down easy around a fire. Found myself drinking the whole case"

"O - nothing special, but it's not bad. I'd get it if I was in a pinch, but there are better options out there."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep brown in color with some ruby highlights. A very thin beige head was seen with actually no lacing to speak of. The aroma is very light and of roasted malts with some chocolate. The taste is more stronger than the aroma which is a good thing was it is very smooth to drink. Perfect carbonation and goes down easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste is noted."
""
""

"O-a nice dark lager wouldnt buy again but only because I would rather try other beers but still enjoyable"
""
"It pours reddish-brown, overwhelming that dissipates rapidly, some lacings, and decent carbonation. it has sweet malty taste, little aroma, with hints of roasted grains. There is no bite or edge, goes done easy , and is not filling. Above average come pared to the lesser Anheuser products."

"Cheap grains. Quite sweet. Fair amount of flavor, but no depth. Hops seem to barely be there, if at all. There's not much to say about Michelob AmberBock other than the fact that it's a nice option for the price it is. It's about the same price as a Bud Light, but actually has a bit of flavor."
"I made this profile just to review how awful this beer is. Basically take a watered-down light beer and throw in some food coloring and this is what you'd get. Head immediately goes away (unlike the thick head in the photo on the case), and description on the bottle is so far off reality I think they probably plagiarized it from some actual beer. Truly a beer for men who want to look like men, but wish they were drinking a Zima instead."
"O-Solid beer with nice taste that gives you more."
""
"Overall: I enjoy it, not as anything special, but when I want a cheap non flavorful beer, I would pick this anyday over pretty much anything else ab mass produces."
""
""
""

""
""

"I bought this beer to use as a reference color for my homebrews and while it is certainly drinkable, there is just no compelling reason to consume it regularly, especially considering that it is hardly a bargain."

"i am a novice drinker even though i am in my 60's and never really cared for beer. this one drinks nicely and was enjoyable to drink. my little brother has much more experience with beer (and drinking in general) and i am going to ask him to taste this one. is that enough letters now???"

"As an early ""boomer," I was a sucker for PBR-Bock (seasonal - can). Michelob, Amberbock is better quality at the right price... Excellent beer relative to my tastes. I like a darker tasting, heavier beer but not more than one traditional Guinness."

"this was the only beer I had at the big bud brewery in st Louis that wasn't vastly improved by being on tap fresh at the source. the pour was nice enough, clear copper in color, a little rusty, with over an inch of bubbles on top. the nose was sweet caramel malts, extract though, and a little thin. no hops at all on which to comment. the taste is the same, extract and thin in that sort of messed up home brewing kit manner, that I just cant get over. its a lot better than the ultra amber, but that isn't saying a whole lot. its got the same malt profile, which in this type of bock, needs to be a whole lot better. also the lager yeast here seems off, if it is in fact lagered. the finish is a contaminated sort of bitterness, and it sits funny in the belly, just not a great beer all up. got a sappy feel to it despite its upbeat carbonation, I may never drink this again, and I am more than okay with that."

"Color is a darker amber, the taste was actually pretty good. Not really a bock beer imo, but a good dark lager would be a more appropriate type. Has a sweet, malty taste with a clean, refreshing finish. This would even be a good summer beer as it has that clean, lighter taste for a ""bock"" beer. I would even buy a case of this...not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Nothing offensive here, this is just a mass produced, standard dark lager that quenches the thirst during hockey and pizza. Can't complain."

"I gotta say I really like this beer. Its appearance is very dark, with a thick frothy head. I poured it into a glass with a rounded bottom, per the instructions, and the head retained for the length of my drinking. Really nice malty taste. I could have a ton of these. I've always enjoyed Michelob Light as one of my favorite Macros, as its a good balance of taste and drinkability, but I've never really experimented with the offerings of the Michelob brand. Mich Lager is like a beefed up Budweiser, but not so amazing that it needs to be tried. The RYE-P.A. was a tasty but short lived experiment, and michelob ultra is no good at all. But the Amber Bock was something I've passed by for years without trying and I'm glad i gave it a shot. The hallertau hops are a great smelling variant and the caramel malts are loud and proud here. You may be surprised how tasty this is. Its a beer that I feel I could grow tired of if its all I ever had, but then again that can be said with just about anything. You really ought to give this a try as I feel this is something that could be discontinued with lousy sales and I really would miss it."
""
"Overall - Hardly what most would consider to be a good bock. It may not even be considered average by many. In the very least, it's inoffensive. Needless to say, my childhood curiosity has been snuffed, though not sated. I imagine this is the first and last time I will ever drink this beer."

"Look. Michelob stinks. You know it. I know it. The American people know it. In fact, their Ultra could be the worst beer made in America today. However, this Dark Lager Amber Bock isn't half bad. My expectations were very low for this, but I was encouraged with the darker pour. No smell of any note is present. As for taste, it is clean and fresh. There is a slight splash of vanilla or caramel in the taste, and the after taste is refreshing. Will I ever spend the $5.99 for a six-pack on this again? Only if I am broke. But for the price, it's not bad. Still, if I want cheap beer, I'll take Pabst Blue Ribbon or Grain Belt Premium."
""
""
"O: Meh! Tasty enough to not complain about it much but still having that mass produced feel to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, It pretty much tasted like a dark adjunct lager. I could have it with friends or to wash food down but I doubt i'd have it in any other situation."
""
""

"Flavor is malty and sweet, even watery, but smooth. I get a hint of roastiness in the malts, as well as some touches of dried fruit. This one's subtle, and most definitely lacking in complexity, but, nonetheless, a decent choice as opposed to the usual adjunct lager swill."
"I've had it both in a bottle, and on tap. It pores like other bock styles, nice dark/rich color and moderate size head. The aroma had a maltiness to it, with almost a chocolate hint. The finish is a heavier, filling taste while still keeping you wanting more. It's my favorite winter time, by the bon fire beer. It gives you all the fill you want without being completely bitter and so heavy that you feel like you need to take out a knife to cut through it."
""
""
""
"O - Nothing spectacular but not poor tasting. A little bland"
""
"It seems as if Amber Bock has been weakened over time. This bottle poured a weak brownness and missed the blackness of old. The scent was of sweet malts but sort of metallic on the nose. The taste was weak, no burning overtones, or malt backbone to speak of. I remember this was a rather tasteful beer at one time, one I was embarrassed to say I liked, but I believe that Michelob has changed the recipe to keep costs down and Amber Bock has suffered because of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet barley malt up front, caramel, toasted, slight roasted nut. Hop bitterness is very mild. Crisp finish. Body is light, crisp, a little dry, very smooth, well carbonated."
""
"thats all I have to say about this one"
""
""
""
"Overall: I've been going to this one for a while as the only dark available on tap in a few pubs I've frequented. Reasons being: far more flavor than you would get from the macro straw-colored beers available, and less expensive than a truly nice beer. She's my go-to middle of the road dark. Quite a cheap date, Michelob Amber Bock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I end up drinking this dark beer more than I would like because it is usually available everywhere and is sometime the only dark around. The appearance and smell are average the taste has nothing that offends . A little watery. But still better than a lighter lager in my opinion"

"This particular beer had a malty scent underneath a hearty head that stuck around for quite a while. I tasted a distant flavor of caramel, but it was mostly bitter from the hops. Overall, it looks great in the glass but was lacking from a watery taste that was mostly bitter."

"Overall, this beer is what I would have if I only had a choice from domestic brews."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a lot lighter in body compared to other beers in the style, making it easier to drink for people that are used to drinking American Adjunct Lagers and Light Lagers."
""
""
"O- the color of this beer is very deceiving. You expect it to have a nice malty character, that is not the case. Another example of a watered down Michelob product from AB."
""
""
""
""
"Unlike prev. Review, I cant find even the slightest resembelance to Guinness Extra Stout, or anything else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this beer a lot. Good with food, but not so much a session beer, though it could be done. For the price it can't be beat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The overall score reflects the quick disappearance of what good flavor and taste exists with this beer. Definitely a cut above more mundane beers from Budweiser or Miller, but otherwise unexceptional."
"This tastes like the typical US fare--it's Michelob. It could easily be Bud, Miller, etc. but a slightly deeper lager (because it's a Bock)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer gets a 5/5 because the price is right, you are getting an American Bock Beer which can be served at anytime during the year with various foods. It was so good I asked for a second pour. With a lemon it gives a citrus aspect to the overall taste."

"O: well, I've had it before and wanted to accurately give a fair review. From what I've learned of bocks, this is not exactly what a bock is supposed to be. Maybe not bad for a cheaper beer, but nothing I think I need again at least not immediately."

"Okay, it poured with a massive two-plus fingers of light-tan head, but the retention was lousy, making like a cheap magic trick and disappearing before my very eyes. Gee, I had no idea that ""mahogany"" = deep-amber with NE-quality clarity. Very edifying. Equally edifying was the nose, which imparted caramel, but also a huskiness that was not required. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was too sweet for this kid. I like when lagers are given a chance to really age and dry out, but to each his/her own. It finished with a semi-dryness, but not enough to be compelling. I bought it as a single from my neighbor who had some in the singles case recently, and just like a good hippie, I will try anything once. This was a once and done for me, however."

"Decent head qith no lacing to follow. Small hints, and i mean small of caramel. Not much going on in the smell. Decent amount of carbonation which makes this beer refreshing and not really a lip smacker. Caramel and a touch of biscuit quickly hit the palate before disappearing completelt. Very thin bodied. Imo it is a poor job by michelob for a bock.. but i will always have a place in my heart for this beer since it introduced me to a slight different style of beer during my bud light days."

"Single finger head on a slightly hazy brown with amber hues body. Decent amount of lacing. Sweet caramel malt and light Gipson the aroma. More sweet caramel malt in the flavor with no hops to speak of. The malt aftertaste is perfect. High carbonation makes this one seem refreshing. Medium body. Overall nof a bad offering. One of the better beers when choices are slim."

"O - I cant lie, I have drank a good bit of this back in my youth. But I wanted to review it 100% objectively. Now that I have, I could be nice and say how Amber Bock is sometimes the best choice at restaurants or how it's a gateway from Coors/Bud/Miller to ""better"" beers. But I wont. Truth be told, it's weak flavored, watery, mislabled, and just...not very good. I would never pay to drink this by choice."

"overall/ for a company like michelob its a decent beer.for only 10 bucks a twelve pack. its a bit over decent.would i buy it again? probally not. better to throw 7 more bucks and get some sierra nevada"
"The newer label calls it ""Amberbock," like it's some cool new thing. Described as ""American bock-style lager," which is probably closer to the truth than an actual bock."
"Overall: An okay beer. Perhaps a bit sub-par, but it is one of the better attempts of a macrobrewery to produce craft beer. Not bad, and certainly very drinkable."
"overall = I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, but while it wasn't bad, but I probably won't drink it again, because it wasn't very interesting."
"Overall: Definitely a highly-sessionable brew that goes very well with food. Ironically, I used to think of this one as a heavier beer, but now comes across as being a bit on the watery side. Nonetheless, this one's always good in a pinch, and is one of my favorite A-B offerings."
"Overall, I've got a soft spot for this beer. It was the first beer I remember actually enjoying all those years ago. It hasn't held up too well since my beer tastes have matured. Not a bad beer though. It's not something that I can really relax with anymore, but something to reminisce over."
"Lesson learned - stick to keeping it in the bottle. If it's less than $7 a pitcher - wonderful! Otherwise, I wouldn't pay more than $10 a 12'er."
"O: Meh, not as bad as I assumed it would be. Under the right circumstances (i.e. no other craft options, paired with food, etc.) I could drink this again."
"The last time I've had this stuff was from the very bottom of a keg at a bar back home in Wheeling. That glass was proof that they use some sort of artificial flavoring or coloring here. That glass tasted like pure caramel flavored soda syrup. As if it had all settled to the bottom of the keg over the month or so it took them to sell it all. It was horrible. This stuff is a safer bet in the bottle, but a much, much worse value. Don't buy it, its mocking the craft beer world. Its fitting that the rest of the BA community finds it suitable for a C though."
"Totally undrinkable psuedo bock. I would rather just drink a Bud light. I highly discourage the drinking of this beer."
"O: Saving these for guests"
"Two things I love equally, saving money and drinking good beer. For the price, I really like this beer. I love amber beers, and this as a great roasty type flavor that makes me feel like I am drinking something more special than most American beers. I like it."
"Overall Drinkability - Meh. I remember it being better. One of the beers that started to show me that there exists things other than American Adjunct Lagers. Guess I really grew out of it though because while it's not bad, it's pretty disappointing."
"O: a very easygoing darker bock."
"My favorite Michelob brew. The smell is fairly average for an Amber Bock. The caramel taste is subtle but still noticeable and it goes down easily. Dark beers typically fill me up quickly but this felt a little lighter then most Bock beers that I have consumed. I enjoyed this and will most likely purchase again in the future."
"Tried this at a Mexican restaurant awhile back because all of their other beers were pale lagers, and I’m not a fan of pale lagers. Poured dark, smelled of burnt malts and caramel. Tasted thick, malty with slight caramel and hop presence. Nothing special, but better than drinking pale lagers."
"O: Sort of a weak example of a bock. Although if I had to choose between this and a busch beer this would win hands down."
""
"O - Not much of a bock. If you are looking for a good bock, look elsewhere."
"This is probably the only Michelob brew I'd willingly buy. But even with saying that it'd be a long shot. The beer pours out as a really deep amber, it's pretty much brown. The head is tan and fades within a couple minutes. The smell is slightly sweet with a good amount of malt coming through. The taste is dry and sweet. It's roasted and has a very light wooden flavor to it. The mouthfeel is smooth and almost medium bodied. The beer is approachable and drinkable for sure. But it's still a Michelob."
"I was in a hurry, so I chilled it hard in the freezer. My first beer was too cold. It seemed to improve as it warmed, so I knocked the overall up from a 2.5."
"Served on draft into a mug. This Bock beer poured a very clear dark reddish brown color. It produced a thin white head that had poor head retention. There was a very small amount of thin lacing left behind. The aroma was a soft malty smell, maybe a sight amount of toasted malt. The bock tasted sweet and there was not much of a toasted malt flavor that you would expect from a bock beer. There is a very slight hint of hop bitterness. I would classify this as having a light to medium body. This beer is a nothing more then a gateway beer- if used for that purpose fine, but its good for not much else. This does not hold a candle to Shiner Bock."
"Pours a medium dark color with a less than average head of foam for a tap beer and it also diminished quickly. About the only scent I could gather was a little bit of a malt scent. Had a fairly mild taste of malts with about an average texture to it. A decent beer for Anheuser-Busch, but doesn't stand a chance against a craft brewery's bock."
"Marked it up just a notch in mouthfeel because it is so easy to drink, being nearly flavorless and all. Will not seek this out again."
"Overall it is a decent beer. I would not rate it extremely high but it is much better than I thought it would be."
"This beer is more lacking in flavour than many water beers I've had. It's a terrible bock. It tastes mostly like carbonation. I didn't know that could be such an over-powering flavour. The only other flavour present is a bit of a starchiness. At least it's not overly-sweet but god damn, there's really nothing in this. Shiner is several times better than this as is any other bock."
"This has always been my go-to draft beer at McCoy Stadium, and I'll probably still choose it over Bud, Coors Light, etc. In that setting it's very drinkable, but as I take a closer look, there just isn't much to it. It doesn't taste bad, it's just blah."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable. Could definitely be a ""session beer"" if that's the kind of thing you're into."
"O- This beer was average or a little above it. There isn't much to it but the malty flavors take hold and at times make you want to drink it a little fast. The ABV is low enough that you can enjoy this beer a little more than a pint or two."
"Pours a clear, ruby amber color with a large white head. Scent is a bit grainy with hints of caramel malt and nuttiness. Taste is blah... Not much goin on. Very subtle malt flavors with just a hint of chocolate and maybe some dark fruit. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Drinkability is fairly high, as I would prefer this one over most macros."
"Of the many attempts by the big three to take a shot at micro/import style brews, this is the best I've had yet. Easy to drink, decent taste, not fantastic but lacking the usual drawbacks of macro beers. I wouldn't seek it out but it gets the job done."
"D - This beer is not bad at all and it's kinda what I was expecting. Doesn't quite remind me of a bock but it does have an okay malt profile that keeps you wanting more as you quaff down this highly drinkable brew. I think for the price I'd definitely buy this one again, and I'd have this brew any day over the classic Bud. Cheers!"
"This ""bock"" is very plain and offers little flavor. There's nothing offensive about it but the fact that the main flavor is yeast is somewhat off-putting. A slugger for sure, go for St. Pauli Girl Dark over this though.."
"I was really surprised, took a few sips to get used to but otherwise its a pretty good beer. Not too dark as I would expect and only had a few so I don't know what the next morning effects would be. There really wasnt an after taste either."
"D- This is a pretty drinkable beer, depending on your expectations. This is not a double bock. It's barely a single bock. But if you're looking for something earthier than your basic lawnmower beer, but that won't put off your bud light drinking buddies, this is a pretty good option. I would drink this again, although I wouldn't seek it out. For the money, yes, this is a good beer."
"Drinkability- Can finish a Michelob in anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes. Easiest beers to drink. Smooth and refreshing. Love to promote these but many friends aren't huge fans of Michelob."
"It tastes kind of like weak tea. Seems kind of flat and light to me. Doesn't compare favorably to Shiner Bock, but its drinkable. I bought 6 for $6.76 at Wal-mart, twist off cap. Michelob has long been one of the beers I like, and their old style lager is one of the best you can buy for the money, but this beer just seems ill-conceived for them or something."
"Pours a pretty amber color with a thick yellowish white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of malts and a little yeast bread. Tastes very malty with a little bread and maybe too much sweet caramel. Strange oily mouthfeel adds nothing to the experience with a thinnish carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"All-in-all this is a surprisingly good macro. I like it quite a bit. Not the best bock you'll find I'm sure, but pretty good. Nice and dark for a bock compared to what I've had but I like it. Might want to give it a try because you might be pleasantly surprised."
"the taste is very matly and semi bitter with low carbonation average mouthfeel and very drinkable. overall really tasty and i think ill start keeping a few around."
"Dave"
"Drinkability: Not something I'll search out in the future. I'm glad I got this free from a friend. If I'd bought a sixer of this I'd have to toss it or give it to some homeless guy."
"body is on the thinner side, lower carbonation, but smooth."
"D: Better than almost all regularly available macros. I could easily drink if it were my only option (which it can be in places like WI, etc.) but no craft in this one by far."
"It is a light body feel to it that is sticky on the lips and clings to the tip of the tongue. Overall, this has some bock character, but more the idea of it than the real malty deal. If you focus on the Amber side of the name (it does come first) than things look better."
"D- Very easy to drink and slightly more complex than most macro brews."
"Pours out into a dark amber color with no head, no retention, no lacing and lots of carbonation. I did a gentle pour, so I now know this beers needs an agressive pour to get a head on it. The smell is hardly noticeable, but did get a hint of malts, a nutty smell, and a little caramel. The taste is at first some caramel, nuts, a little citrus and it has a sweet taste to it and the after taste becomes a little dry. It is a light body feel to it that is sticky on the lips and clings to the tip of the tongue. This is one of the most drinkable beers I have had in awhile. While it is not the best beer, it also is not the worst, but a decent one to drink once in awhile."
"Too much like a dark Bud with some extra malt."
"Bottle. Pours a clear dark reddish hued brown color with minimal had. The smell is very clean or I should say absent with slight notes of roast and sweet malt. Medium mouthfeel with slight carbonation. Sweet malty start with some roast malt notes. Not a while lot going on. Pass on next time."
"I want to rag on this, but it is the best offering from AB and is not bad at all. Nice job guys!"
"I haven't tried Anheuser-Bush product in 12 - 13 years, but had to drink this one in my friend's house. The beer reminded me of a fruit soda with alcohol. Also, it is very annoying when they put a name on the beer that has nothing to do with an actual beer style"
"D: Some bock character, but more the idea of it than the real malty deal. Focus on the Amber side of the name (it does come first) and things look better. And from the perspective of what you get for what you pay - this beer is super fly."
"Drinkability: I recently reviewed a Shiner Bock and this brew is reminescent of the Shine, but a step down. Sessionable but why bother?"
"Notes: This beer does not have any robust, strong, or malty characteristics to it. They should just call it bud amber. They pretty much just added some coloring."
"Living in TX i'm partial to Shiner Bock for this style, but tried this tonight - and it's not bad. A bit more of a kick (5.2% ABV compared to 4.4%), not sure if it's darker since I had it in a bottle. Overall not a bad choice and probably the best Michelob product I have drunk."
"Another nice bit o' Quizzo beer. It pours a clear tawny amber topped by nearly a finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises light caramel, orange zest, and light maple syrup. The taste holds notes of caramel, brown sugar, orange zest, and some light ginger. The body is a light-ass medium, with a light carbonation and a kinda watery feel. Overall, a decent brew, nothing to write home about, but an easily drinkable choice for Quizzo."
"D: Rather. The carbonation helps keep things slightly interesting in a rather lack-luster flavor."
"The lack of flavors, body and overall complexity make me unwilling to drink much more. I really tried to review this with an open mind and I feel I did. Its just not good. Definitely not a bock and hardly worth the water it took to make it."
"This beer poured an amber color, surprise! There was a decent white foam head on top. The smell was generally malty in nature but rather weak on the nose. The taste was a very ho-hum flavor of basically malt and perhaps some orange zest for flavor, still not bad. The feel is rather sticky when held in the mouth, but other than that it turned out on the watery side for me. If your choices are limited you could do so much worse than this beer. Of all the regular BMC products I've had this one is one of the better beers."
"Drinkability: It sits fairly heavy on the drinker, maybe a little too much for its style and rather tame flavor profile. Not bad for what it is, though. I could drink a few of these with no problem, but it gets to be somewhat burdensome."
"A good venture for someone looking for a darker beer that isn't craft. Certainly has the Michelob characteristic. Anyone drinking a mass produced beer must remember that it is produced for the mass consumer. This won't win any prizes, but it isn't the bottom of the barrel either."
"Pours a mild brown, almost chocolatey color. Decent sized foamy head that disappears quickly. Smells of roasted flavors, hints of chocolate, and slightly malt. Nice complexity in the taste. A good starter beer for the light beer drinker that wants to go a little darker. Fairly watery in your mouth, but still easy to put a few back for a darker beer. Overall, it's one of the beers I continually return turn because of price and quality of the brew."
"D-well...the more you drink, the worse it gets. the taste begins as weak but somehow the alcohol note comes out strongly, and I know, I know the abv shouldn't be high enough to say that."
"Price could be nicer for a pretty simple beer. It gives you a little bit of everything though, and this beer has saved me sometimes. You know how it is, when this is the best option."
"As far as the drinkability goes, I'd take this over just about any other Anheuser-Busch product. It's got good malt flavor without pushing the envelope but it's not so light that you feel like you're drinking cheap beer. It finishes clean and at a hardly noticeable 5.2% abv, it's quite sessionable. It's a generally safe pick."
"A nice brew for the price, goes down easy. Tastes are mild."
"Pours a moderately dark amber color with an off white head. Smells of amber malt and quite a bit of bread. Taste brings forward a bit more dough and some bready flavors. Slight caramel. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. Drinks fairly well and isn't bad in any way, but nothing really stands out."

"For a premium beer from one of the largest breweries; I thought there would be more. I do like the color and the two finger brownish head of rich, thick foam, but the head vanished quickly and left nothing but a little lacing, with little hold. The color is that of a reddish brown rating a 28 on the SRM Beer Color Chart. I wish the smell and flavor measured up to the appearance...not. Smells like roasted wheat and corn, with a touch of malt sweetness. Taste has some hint of hops, but mostly corn, clover, sweet malt, and wheat, and not very well balanced. I like the creamy feeling in my mouth, second to the best part of the beer. It sort of grows on me as I drink a little more, and it warms just a little. Still a bit over talked for what I tasted. I guess I would have it, if others wanted it, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way to get it."
"D- Easy as all get out to drink. If it's BMC only on tap and they mention this, I opt for it... not much darker in Florida. Not great for a bock but an easy beer to drink and it's certainly something I can turn people towards getting them ready for beer with actual flavor!"
"O: Pretty poor execution overall, but it appeals to the not-quite-craft crowd and is a step up from adjunct lager. Much better off the tap."
"T- Carmel malts and sweet. A little watery also."
"D= I tried it with my burger, my potato chips, my salad, my beef-barley soup, it was horrible with any of them. I left the stein more than half-full when I finished."
"D: Meant only to be swallowed, never savored"
"A bit sweet overall, without the corresponding hop bitterness to make this a repeat indulgence."
"easily drinkable though nothing special. certainly one of the better cheap beers out there and one of my go to budget beers ($6/sixer)."
"Overall: Promising start, disappointing finish, a decent beer overall."
"D- easy drinker so smooth, michelobs have a smoothness to them that I like. Drink er all day if available. Good for parties"
"Drinkability - I could drink this beer non-stop all day for a week, which is extremely rare of any beer I drink, alcohol content is low enough, yet the taste is pleasant and balanced for me to keep drinking over and over again."
"Drinkability - I feel like after 5 or 6 the sweetness will be a little sickening. Given the choice I'd rather just drink regular Michelob Original Lager all night."
"Drinks easily and did the trick for the entire night of the wedding. I drank these all night so it's sessionable. When in a pinch, this worked well, but obviously there are many better bock choices out there. Still, an above average beer."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink; but that is because of its blandness. Certainly not as flavorful and full bodied as would be expected from a bock. If it's all I have . . ."
"cheers!"
"D: I found it quite easy to throw back a few of these with little thought. It's definitely a better choice than most of AB's other offerings, but they shouldn't be calling it a bock by any means. It gets marks off for its unapologetic blandness while trying to imitate a style that should be much more flavorful. I'm glad that AB does offer these types of products that might introduce new styles of beer to their huge consumer base."
"D: Not a terrible beer, but not really a very good Bock."
"D- When people discuss Michelob and similar products, they view it one of two ways. Either it's good (for an AB beer) or it's not so good (for a bock). Perhaps we should recognize that this situation places it as a potential for a good intro beer."
"Pours a dark brownish amber with a thin tan head on top. No retention; no lace. Smells of grains, some light caramel, and nuts. The mouth is thin. Carbonation level is low-moderate. Too slick for my liking. Par for the brewer. The flavor is decent, but it's a little on the weaker side. Some faint caramel, toasted grains, and a sweet finish. All-in-all, not too bad considering the source. I'd have it again, but it's nothing to scream for, for sure."
"D: Not a bad little beer from the Bud people.... Just it a shot, it might lead you to some better things."
"Although I thought the body a little thin for a Bock I was pleasantly suprised how drinkable the beer was (hence having it more than once during our stay). I also think because of the brewers, some on this site automatically downgrade their scores?"
"Pours a three-finger cream head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces lace. Nice crystal clear deep amber color. Light bodied and light-medium carbonation. Nose is light malt. Flavor is light sweet caramel and malt but lacks depth, needs more malt and hops. Better as a lawn mower beer. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"D: This isn't really a bad beer by any sense, but it's not a great one either. Probably gets a bad rap for being an AB product (make your own judgment there), but something that's passable."
"The beer pours a deep amber with a head that does not last long. The smell is of caramel & roasted grain. The taste is initially sweet and finishes dry. It has a medium feel but sort of bland. I would consider this an entry level bock, drinkable but not my first choice."
"Medium bodied with a smooth caramel fullness."
"Drinkability: Certainly goes down easily as there's just not much going on. Amber Bock is a bock in name alone. I could call my cup of Rooibos Chai from Teavana a bock but that just doesn't make it true."
"Medium body, slightly on the thin side, but that only adds to the drinkability. Not the best bock I've had, but certainly the best from AB. Has enough flavor to keep itself interesting and legitimately be labeled a bock. In fact, politics aside, I'd grab this over Shiner anytime."
"D - A pretty standard bock, yet drinkable. Not my first choice of bocks, pretty middle of the road -a bit on the thin side."
"For me this is nothing to write home about. It's a bock for sure but it is missing the POW! I want some more bread and a more complex caramel character."
"Not much else to say, it's bland, but compared to an Adjunct Lager it's a tad superior."
"D= I tried it with my burger, my potato chips, my salad, my beef-barley soup, it was horrible with any of them. I left the stein more than half-full when I finished."
"D: This is a beer that I will drink over and over again"
"D-I drank a pitcher, so I can honestly say I was imprressed especially for a Macro beer."
"The label is this beer's only high point."
"Not bad, Michelob!"
"Pleasantly surprised with this beer I will definitely buy more of these and wouldn't hesitate to by a draft when there wasn't anything with flavor on-tap."
"It's drinkable and it's better than any macro light out there that I can think of. For regular macros, it's pretty standard."
"Notes: This was something that I thought was a good beer when I first started. Seems like a good stepping stone beer."
"RJT"
"On tap at local bar. After the pour the beer appeared pretty watery with a dark amber color. Nothing to exciting in the smell, some green fruityness and sugar. Taste was nothing really special some cereals, grains and sweetness. Not much of a bock not real malt backbone. Mouthfeel was once again watery at best. Did not order another one."
"D: Would make a good session beer if the style/taste suits you."
"Overall, this is a decent brew. Definitely not my first pick but does the trick when in a tight spot. I like the balance of the caramel malts and hops. Also I like the notable hops in the finish. I believe this gets bad reviews because of its family tree."
"Taste is similar, being mostly toasted barley, some mineral and hints of earth/soil and grass with a faint hint of spiciness. It becomes more bland over time. Feel is decent, not quite watery but not much better."
"This beer is highly drinkable and actually has flavor. It's only Anheuser product that I put support behind. This brew is definitely worth a try."
"Overall: One of my favorite macros to drink, so if this was listed as an American Adjunct Lager I would give it an 'A'. It is listed as a Bock however, and thus it falls short in such a complex and loved category."
"Not a good smell, not a good flavor, and not a very drinkable beer. I thought this one was a big disappointment."
"One of A&B's better brews as far as I'm concerned. Bock is a strong word to describe this beer as it is watered down in terms of sight, smell, taste and texture that one usually associates with bock. With all this said I enjoyed this much more than the American Adjunct Lager usually released by the big name breweries. This is a great back-up beer to sip if you are at a bar with limited selection."
"Beer is medium bodied and has a relatively clean finish with only the slightest of aftertastes. The beer overall is good and decent. Mouthfeel is ok. There is a slight sweetness / malt character at the front but its pretty minor. There is close to no bitterness and almost a nutty flavor to the whole thing. Drinkability is fine. Nothing too special about this beer. Just a baseline bock."
"D. Not over filling, quite tasty overall. I could easily make this a session beer for a night. Favorite Michelob product."
"Overall - Thinking Shock top was a fairly decent beer, I decided to give another Michelob beer a shot. Unfortunately, this isn't what I'd call a bock at all, and it was pretty disappointing overall. This beer advertises itself as a rich, full flavored beer, but it is anything but. Steer clear of this one."
"Taste: Very sweet with little to no bitterness to balance it. The sweetness is more of a chocolate then toasted and is not bad but lacks anything else."
"Poured a clear dark reddish mahogony brown with a quickly dissapearing head. Some thin lacing. Smell has some nice sweet cherry or apple notes on top of some dark roasted unsweetend chocolate. I pick up pretty much the same thing in the taste. Some nice burnt toasty flavor, minimal hops, dry coffee, bitter chocolate. Not bad. I'm sure this is by no means a great bock, but It's pretty flavorful beer. Good choice to have on hand for company so they stay away from your good stuff."
"This beer was OK. It lost its carbonation and lacing too quickly for my taste, but the flavour was good. It could be a bit darker, noticable when poured into my judging glass."
"Drinkability: Nothing exciting (and not a real Bock), but certainly drinkable and better than many BMC products."
"M/D - Pretty drinkable bock, one of the better brews from Michelob. I would purchase this brew again. A sweet tasting brew, bitter at the end but not too strong. I brew I can drink more than one of in a sitting"
"Overall, didn't like this one much. Was much more impressed with the dunkelweiss. Would avoid this unless there wasn't a better option."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is weak, certainly caters to the bmc crowd, but this makes it quite drinkable"
"Drinkability: Really easy another aspect of the beer quality."
"Head doesn't stick around. The beer has a nice amber hue. Tastes better than a 'regular' Michelob, quite nutty and refreshing. The mouthfeel has a bit of bite to it. Not too thin for the style. The drinkability is good. Not an amazing beer but decent."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some malts, not much going on here. Taste is very good, malts, nutty, chocolate, very flavorfull. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this makes for a quality beer."
"Very drinkable, I've got to say this is one of my favorite beers when fresh but I've had some where you could tell it was either old of funky."
"I've had this a session beer many times, usually drinking it from the bottle but for the purposes of rating it I'll pour it in a glass. Sweet malts are predominate on the nose; a faint chemical aroma detracts from it. There's nothing particularly striking about this beer but it tastes better than your average macro-brew and has a soft nuttiness and lightly sweet taste that I find enjoyable and finishes with a light minerally dryness that I find enjoyable."
"D - Why? There is almost nothing to this beer. Not worth the time. Just bland and uninspired."
"I felt slightly ripped off paying a buck fifty for this. Truly awful attempt at beer. I am generally not one to straight-up trash a beer, but this might be among the worst I've ever tried."
"Drinkability: Easy drinkability, a good beer but not anything that is going to blow you away with complexity. Nonetheless a descent lager that I would not mind drinking again."
"I would serve this beer to friends that I like. It's definitely a beer that I would purchase again."
"Pours a clear amber/brown, with a thin tan head. Smell is slightly of sulfur, and has a grassy component. Taste is extremely light, a tiny hint of caramel sweetness up front. The middle is slightly salty. You can taste the alcohol in this beer. Finishes completely watery. Mouthfeel is watery, medium carbonation levels. Drinkabiltiy is alright, the light flavor ensures that one can drink several of these. Though it is a very un-flavorful compared to other bocks. For the price there are much better options."
"Cheers!"
"Its mouth feel reminds me of seltzer..."
"The pour was descent with a slight head. The taste, in my opinion, is wonderful and is always welcoming. The smell is fairly weak but not bad. Definitely worth a buy if your not looking to break the budget."
"The Amber Bock had no smell, no flavor, no head retention (I think the server did a bad job serving the beer). The color as looked right although hard to tell through the plastic cup. All in all, I was totally disappointed with the beer and would have been better off with another soda instead of what A-B calls ""Amber Bock""."
"The fact that this beer has a C blows my mind. Whether judging it as personal taste or based on it's claims of being a bock it's a complete failure. There's basically no taste whatsoever. No aroma really, not even sniffed from the bottle. I understand the whole attempt by macros to capitalize on the craft scene, butif you're going to attempt to make a bock you may want there to be some trace of maltiness to the beer. Sure, the flavor isn't offensive (other than intellectually, that is), it doesn't taste like, say.. rotting milk. But ""not rotting milk-like"" should not be the standard by which we judge ""average"". If it lacks flavor, then it's bad. To further highlight it's shortcomings, my girlfriend was drinking a red stripe (yes these were the two most-decent offerings at this venue) and I discovered that it is, in fact, MORE malty and bock-like than Michelob's offering. Terrible."
"stay in the major leagues. the mino leagues are where the most interesting batters and pitchers are (pun intended)"
"Overall not terrible for the evil empire. At least they make all malt beers now."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, if you're in the mood for this type of beer it's worth drinking for a while but overall it's just another mediocre beer."
"Drinkability: It started off pretty good, but about halfway through it really lost something. It was not god-awful, but it is not something I could drink on a regular basis."
"this brew pours up a clear brown color with a thin white head. great lacing. the nose is crisp hops and clean malts, subtle dark fruits, a hint of caramel. the taste is very clean. bitter hops, faint malts. light bodied, medium carbo. This a good poolside beer."
"Back before I was a craft beer drinker, this was my favorite. I had one for the first time in at least 5 years lat night and man, was I disappointed. With the dark color I was hopeful especially as I recalled how much I liked it. But a weak aroma and weak taste reminded me that this was another macrobrew. Sure, its got more flavor than a macro lager, but not much. Slightly sweet, light bodied with a bit of a almond flavor."
"despite all the low scores, its definately a very easy drinking beer for what it is, which isnt a bock. more like a light amber lager, ha, i just made up a new style. would never buy this again, but if it was given to me, it wouldnt go to waste. dont buy this."
"Drinkability - I will certainly finish this 6 pack. It was not so disappointing that I can't finish 6 bottles. Michelob needs to work on the head of this beer, it just doesn't look like good beer at all. One plus is the price, quite cheap."
"D 4.0 - I dig this stuff. I used to drink it a lot before I was into craft brews, and it's still good like I remember. I rarely drink it out of a bottle, it's usually a draft selection during Florida ""winter""."
"Bock or not, this is completely quaffable, and, barring the horrible farts you're bound to experience as the day wears one, will definitely serve in a pinch. One of Anheuser-Busch's better products, but does that really count for anything?"
"D: Drinks easily, but seems like a heavier adjunct light beer after a while."
"D: This takes me back to Yorkside in New Haven, CT. If you wanted something to drink that wasn't horrible, it was either this or Sam Adams. This was a little cheaper than SA, so this was the choice more than a few times. Middle of the road, but easily drinkable and somewhat true to the style."
"I like a lot of Michelob's offerings but this one... no dice. I think the combination of me not liking Bock's to begin with and a mass produced version of one just did not mesh well. Pours a dark brown color, not much in terms of smell. Very watery mouthfeel to it and no body once soever. Taste is all malts, and not very tasty ones at that. I guess I just don't understand this style and can't fathom how anyone can find this to taste 'good'. Was able to finish the glass but not very enjoyable... I'll pass on this in the future."
"Overall: Standard mouthfeel as well as drinkability. I suppose it's one of Michelob."
"Drinkability- Overall, being that I'm not a huge bock or michelob fan, I was surprised to find this a fairly drinkable, brew."
"Footnote: I experienced some intestinal distress later in the evening. I was farting into the middle of the next day. This did not make me happy."
"My son loves this beer, he can have it. It's very dark and it tasted ok when it first went down but shortly there after I did not like the taste at all. I am not saying it's a bad beer, but not one that I like. Never say never, but I doubt I'd ever buy it again."
"This beer is a fucking bock? With a meager 5.2%, this beer does not deserve to be called a bock. Spend your money elsewhere. The Michelob line once again proves its incapacity to produce tasty beers."
"I've had a few of these over the years, but now that I'm thinking seriously about the brew, I realize that it would be easy to drink many of these because it's weak, but it's like a bottle of bad aftertaste."
"Overall, I felt this was a truly dissappointing beer from a brewer I hoped was trying to make affordable craft beer. My honest advice is to skip this, even if its cheap."
"Drinkability: Average. Just OK."
"I didn't pick this up to hate it. I had some hope that perhaps the Michelob series had SOME promise. So far they have been terrible."
"I mean, what did I expect? It's totally and absolutely average. But certainly nothing special. Or particularly worthwhile."
"Final Thoughts - I can't complain on this one when all is said and done. I paid $1 for a pint so my views might be slightly skewed on this one. In the end, this macrobrew provides us with a darker brew that can be surpisingly affordable depending on where you find it."
"Compared to a real German Bock, it's an almost an insult. But compared to most of AB's other fine products, its a worthwhile beer, especially if you're a poor college student like myself. Not as good as some, but better than most everything else in its price range."
"D: Very drinkable for its price range and the fact that it's a mass-marketed domestic attempt at a classic German Bock."
"Even worse, we were there for two hours and right after I ordered my second, I noticed the bar had Sierra Nevada in bottles. The second tasted even worse as a result."
"D- Not a bad attempt from an American macro but still falls a bit short of some of the others."
"nice head when poured in to glass.. buetyful color.. and great taste.. the after taste was a nice sweet after taste"
"Decent head with slightly sweet aroma. Decent hint of malts with sweet taste IMO. Drinkable but just too sweet for me. Not a beer I'd drink a six of - maybe two or three as I did this night. Not a premium beer to me. Rather have a Killians"
"D: Very drinkable but not a good representation of the style."
"Conclusion. If you like a darker beer, but want one that is smooth and easy to drink, this will work, but its not too impressive."
"Pretty decent atmosphere. Flavor has nice balance and a little complexity. Light feel, good drinkability. Good quaff."
"D- Actually I think that this is very drinkable. I haven't had much experience with bocks up to this point but I like the sweet malty flavor and feel that this could be a good starter beer for those experimenting with darker brews. I'd enjoy several of these in a row no problem!"
"Easy-drinking and a good beer to reach for when nothing else is available or you're looking to be cheap, as this one is widely available and much better than piss-water. Still, it lacks in every area and falls far short of the stylistic guidelines; it would probably fare better if it were construed as an American amber or red, as it doesn't even reach the malt level of a Dunkel, much less that of a Bockbier."
"D- way too sweet, poorly balanced. do they use any hops at all? that being said, I guess I'd take this over a bud..."
"This is a decent beer, nothing really special about it, a bit above average for a macro, although i would take a shiner bock over this anyday. Mouthfeel was thin and watery. wasnt terrible, just nothing here stood out. Good effort though! This is for sure one of the better micros out there that I have tried."
"If macros were the only thing around, I would still look for Michelob Pale Ale over this. At least that doesn't taste almost like a regular Michelob."
"This beer has one of the best after tastes in my opinion. Rather smooth and easy to drink. Has a nice hint of caramel. A very sweet taste to it. It says its a dark lager but isn't as dark as expected. Overall very good. Tops on my list. Would definitely recommend to anyone that hasnt given it a try."
"drinkability: The ber that started it all for me. Althoght not a micor, it got me off plain beers. A decent session beer and good transfer beer. Still an avergae beer and a much better choice than the regular old macro lagers"
"Caramel malt up front with some x-mas spice and mild bitter hop in the back. Thin, but typical lageresque carbonation and mouthfeel. I find I like this better if I think of it as an amber lager with x-mas spice rather than a traditional bock."
"Mostly light bodied, with medium carbonation. Probably a little light for the style. I know people who, well, this beer is about as ""micro"" as they've tried...and they all swear this stuff is really great. I think its noticably better than regular Michelob but they really shouldn't be able to call this a Bock...its not a good representation of the style at all. Still I should give AB at least some credit for trying to branch off with the Michelob brand and try other styles."
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber color with a smallish head that settled into a light ring. Not much in the aroma, grainy sweet with a touch of caramel malt. Very sweet taste; caramel malt with a sort of artifical grape like sweetness to give it a resemblance to a bock. As with all AB products, it has a grainy character to it. The brew has a moderate body with crisp and fizzy carbonation to make it easily drinkable; finishes sweet and slightly astringent. A flavorful AB product for sure and somewhat sessionable, though the sweetness may get to me after a while. Falls short for a bock but I did pick up some bock characteristics."
"Poured a light/med tan color with a quickly disappearing head. Slight hint of malt in the aroma with little else to report. While not overendowed with outstanding flavor, it was a clean easy to drink beer. Not my first choice, but not a bad beer to keep around for the friends who wont try anything but a macro. I can drink it and they will."
"Better then bud light and the other lagers, but still not a good beer to ever drink this again."
"T: Kind of week as expected though. Taste is sweet with the slightest bitterness at the end. The taste is OK enough for a session beer when no other good option on tap is available. It's lite enough to refreshing, but not really anything else to say about it."
"Conclusion: Not...a...bock...my biggest problem I think with this beer is that it'd be an average beer at best, but Mich. touts this as a ""rich, full-bodied"" etc etc etc bock beer...which it is deft. not."
"This beer pours a clear amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. It looks thin for a bock. The aroma is faint bready malt with slight hints of caramel. It smells very faint for a bock. The taste is like the aroma...slightly bready, slightly caramely. It tastes too light for a bock. The mouthfeel is light bodied with too much carbonation for the style. It is way to thin and watery for a bock. Overall, this beer is not a bock. It is an amber lager, and it is not even a good amber lager. I will not drink this again."
"Mouthfeel is medium light, with a lot of carbonation. Easy to drink. Got this as part of a ""micro brew"" sample case... Don't think I would buy this on it's own."
"Overall - not a fan of most Michelob products but this is the best of their lineup."
"FRom the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 08310 BL60. The pour is kind of an opaque brownish-red with a short-lived beige head. I think there are some malts in the aroma and some vague hint of caramel. It is watered down and goes down quickly. Better than some Mich products but not as good as others."
"Some aroma of roasted caramel and light floral hops. Quite sweet malty taste, caramel. The hops are barely noticeable, not reaaly enough to balance the sweetness. Mouthfeel is thin, but not overly watery. After a couple the sweetness really starts to stick on the tongue. Average dark lager, not really a bock."
"Overall a simple beer to drink but there is much better. A budget minded beer."
"Pours a clear inviting amber color. Decent head with poor retention and little lacing. Smells of a clean lager and very slight malt. Fits the lager style. A very light malt flavor along with the majority clean of a lager. Better than Bud Light and other light lagers from Anhueser, but still not a good beer overall."
"Pours a nice clear medium dark with a semi-white head that doesn't last,Aroma is faint roasted malts and hop spiciness. Taste is well balanced but unassertive, mostly caramel malt , along with slight hop bitterness,more hops would make this better,not bad for AB I would drink again."
"This was a gateway to craft beers for me. Now that I go back to it, the watery character really destroys the beer for me. It's not a terrible taste. Very malty, roasted flavor. But too watery. For an Aheuser Busch beer it isn't all that bad. Worth a try, but I probably won't go back to it."
" All in all, I didn't like it. Just not for me I guess."
"D - If I hadn't had to drive, I could've downed these all night. Though the bottled version is medicore at best, Amber Bock on tap would be quite the candidate for sessioning."
"Pours a clear dark brown color body, with a creamy whitish cream-colored head, that is big and lasting. Lots of fizziness. A malty aroma, but hard to smell much. Clean tasting, a watery palate. Some maltiness, a little dusty, and some light fruitiness like white grape or pear. Not a fan I used to like this in college, but now my palate has evolved, and I have better choices."
"Overall I probably won't be wasting money on this one again."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, pours deep clear amber color with a off white head that fades pretty quickly. Smells faintly of caramel and malt, taste is smooth and slightly malty with just a little hops, taste is real faint for such a dark beer. For a beer coming form AB this one really isn't too bad. I usually only drink these when it's the best thing available at some of the bars my friends drag me to."
"Drinkability: Light and easy to drink, even if you don't particularly want to. A marginal improvement over the big lagers, the high point of this beer is its wide availability and its role as a stepping stone for those who need to be disillusioned from their preconceptions regarding ""dark"" beer."
"D- Definitely drinkable. Not too much flavor, not too high on the alcohol. That being said, there are plenty of things I'd take over this."
"WHEN THE ONLY OTHER DRAFT BEER AT THE LEGION IS EITHER A WHEAT OR A LITE BEER THIS ONE TAKES THE ""BLUE RIBBON"" BY DEFAULT. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BEERS THAT SOUNDS BETTER THAN IT TASTES. I LOVE BOCK BEERS, AND THERE ARE A LOT TO CHOOSE FROM, BUT THIS WOULD NOT BE MY FAVORITE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT ALL THE OTHERS ARE ""BLECH BEERS"" AT OUR LOCAL LEGION."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, sure. There's not much goin' on here, alcohol's a non-factor, and it's not bad. Would I want to drink it? Another story entirely."
"D: Since the complexity is nothing to write home about, this is one of those beers that go down easy without any thought needed. It has more flavor than most of the big American beers so drink up and enjoy it for what it is."
"I give begruding respect to macros who at least try their hand at craft beer. As it stands, this isn't bad. The appearance is the nicest part, a nice chestnut brown with an amber hue. Thin white head, doesn't stick around. The aroma is grainy malts. The flavor is caramel malts, with a slight fruitiness, more so when it warms up. Medium mouthfeel. The finish has a nice hop presence. This is not a bad beer at all. Not remarkable, but I might serve it at a bbq with a lot of guests."
"Drinkability is good for when you don't want to be challenged."
"Pours a light bending murky brown color with a small tan head. Very sweet malts in the nose as well as a creaminess in the aroma. The sweetness of the malts carry over onto the palate, no bitterness mixed with its sweetened over ripe fruit notes makes this cloying at times, especially once it warms, yea you have to drink this while its cold. I have a lot of experience with the Amber Bock unfortunately its the only beer with some sort of ""chew"" available during the games. I dont recommend drinking this unless you have too, I couldn't imagine it from a bottle..."
"Nice drinkable beer from AB. I know it's been around a long time and I have had it a lot on draft, but I like the bottle better."
"Very very clear dark amber color with a thin head. High carbonation. Slight nutmeg smell. Sweet matly taste with a very very mild nutty/hoppy finish. Almost no flavor at all in the beer. Drinks like Michelob was hired to make Sam Adams Ultra Light. Very drinkable cause there is nothing dissapoint."
"Pretty watered down offering from Anheuser-Busch."
"Not a great beer by any means but the one I end up drinking when the bar has only Bud products. It's a last resort but I find it somewhat drinkable."
"This is something to drink when you go to the bar and there really is nothing else."
"T + M + D: A soft malty sweetness and the slightest hint of hop. Body is fairly crisp, with a little snap of carbonation. Overall, it's certainly easy to drink, but there's really not much going on to make it interesting."
"Out of a bottle this beer was dark garnet color with a foamy, sand-colored head. The head was three fingers huge, displayed nice retention and pretty good lacing. The aroma was soft and rather generic, dry grains mixed with macro lager malt. The flavors were better pronounced but sadly not in a good way. The taste was a muddled combination of corn and barley with some decent caramel malt and a little toasted malt in the middle followed by a bitter macro finish. As the beer warmed it really did get worse because the flavors began to taste more and more Michelob-like. The mouthfeel was slightly below average being a little watery but the carbonation was smooth. Drinkable? Yes. But for your buck one can do much better."
"Certainly not the best Bock out there, but it's enjoyable nevertheless. This beer is good to have on hand to be part of a ""ween your friends off of swill"" program."
"D: Meh, nothing special here, if there was nothing else more appealing I'd drink it. But not something I'd reach for everyday. I'll stick to using it for cooking my brats."
"MF&D - This does not even come close to being a bock, but putting that aside, its pretty much what I had expected from AB. I wasn't expecting too much when I grabbed a 6er from Walmart for $6. Watery and without any real flavor, but drinkable. I wouldn't buy it again, but for $6 its no big loss."
"This really is not a bad beer, especially for a large commercial brewer. It is an attractive reddish brown color, and holds a nice though thin head. The best feature in its appearance is the lovely reticulated lacing that it leaves down the glass through the entire volume. The nose is slightly malty, but not very strong. On the palate, this is a mild beer with a grainy malt, slightly toasted flavor. Very soft finish, but a sparkling effervescence from the carbonation coupled with the thin mouthfeel make this refreshing. Overall, quite drinkable."
"D- Quite quaffable but nothing exciting"
"It's also common to see the AB lineup of Bud, Bud Light, Amber Bock, and Ultra on tap... so this gets the nod of those four."
"Drinkability: Only for free in an airport lounge."
"Decent dark reddish/brown color and a fluffy white head. The smell isn't bad it's just not very prominent. Usually Bocks emit distinct odors and I pick up none of those odors. There's a light sweet metallic smell and that's about it. It tastes sweet also. Lightly roasted sweet malt and not overpowering at all. If anything, it's a bit weak on flavor. Again, not bad, just not strong. There's a minimal touch of hop bitterness. Clean aftertaste. Light for a bock.Very easy drinking beer but it seems more like a dark lager or dunkel than a bock."
"A substandard bock by any means. It just lacks substance all around. Though, this is something I use to drink a lot of back in college. It was a light beer that looked like a dark beer. It is better than most macro lagers though, and comparable to Shiner Bock."
"bottle taken from the old man's fridge"
"Not rich in flavor, but a decent stab at the style from a macro brewery..."
"Taste is OK. Malty, with a little waft of sweet, little bite of bitter. Easy. Drinkable. Not objectionable, but not remarkable in any way; an acceptable drinker when the alternative is something far worse!"
"Not a bad beer for a macro, and It quenched my bock thirst."
"Pale chestnut in color. Not a lot of carbonation to talk about. Somewhat nutty and caramel like aroma. Very clean and crisp flavor-not a lot of flavor to speak of. Smooth, nutty malt tasting. Very low bitterness, even less then a BUD if you ask me. Rather thin body wise. I find this very drinkable though far from being a bock. Call it amber but dont call it bock. I could drink a lot of this if need be, thoug knowing me and my tastes I would probably reach for a BUD."
"Poured a clear, dark brown with a thin white head. Not much to the nose, slight malt. Taste was malty and sweet, some cereal grains. Texture was thin and light. Average beer, nothing bad or great about it. Would rather drink something with a little more flavor or less sweet."
"Dark brown-amber color that pours a small head. For the money this really is quite solid. This and Yuengling have been my go to 'cheap' beers lately. Not bad on draft either. Roasted malt flavor with some sweet bitterness in there. Some sweet fruits (cherry?). A tad thin in the mouthfeel and not a ton of flavor. Only slightly more expensive than your standard old Bud, Michelob or Miller but really quite a bit better than those. Great deal!"
"Poured a clear caramel hued amber, tight foamy pale tan head.Nose is roasted, sugary,and sordove toxic.Taste was malty, syrpy, sugary with some caramel. I have no real complaints about the mouthfeel, crisp from the carbonation, smooth medium body, not quite light bodied, but more medium. This is a great bowling alley beer."
"Amber color, I suppose...not surprised. Has little to no head. The aroma leaves you very dissapointed. Basically just malt. The taste is bubbly and just a bit malty but nothing more and there is no complexity. There is nothing interesting to me about this beer. I leave it at that."
"Drinkability- this stuff goes down really easy."
"Overall: average, wouldn't seek it out, but would drink one again if you're buying."
"Tthis is a decent enough beer. The color is nice but the head is much like a macro lager, it dissipates quickly. The carbonation is too soda like making the mouthfeel wrong for the style. The smell is malt, light and I can't detect much hops. Taste is malt, I get no adjunct. For a macro it is rich, probably a great beer for macro drinkers looking to taste better beers. Weak for a Bock, great for a macro product. I did enjoy this beer and I like it better than another readily available Bock."
"Easy to drink. This was a pretty refreshing brew I could drink a few of."
"Really very good on tap. A refreshing ""dark"" choice from AB."
"Another one of my go to beers if the bar has a poor selection. I had this at a pub tonight simply for this reason. I've enjoyed this brew throughout the years on many occasions and I still thinks it's a solid example of a decent style. Aroma is faint but some creamy malt can be detected. Pours a nice dark amber with a decent tan head. Feels a bit creamy and smooth on the palate. Flavor is usually solid light yet decently malty. Nothing special here just a pretty decent make for this style of beer. Always been better on tap than out of the bottle, good bar beer."
"As described before this is a pretty good 'stepping stone' if all your used to us American macros and want to broaden your horizon. I think this may have been where I started; this is a pretty full body taste with a hazelnut kind of flavor. Give one a try but this really isn't something I would buy frequently as once you get used to a good Stout, this becomes kinda bland, but still not bad if its around."
"It's appearance is a very dark Lager. It's head goes away pretty quickly. It is very easy to drink and smooth. Taste, very nutty with a hint of caramel. I tried for the first time at a Dodger game, it was this or Bud Light. I tried it again by bottle, it's not that bad, probably my favorite Domestic beer."
"This beer is like the little brother of the bock style. It's almost there, but not quite."
"The drinkability is only above-average because of the lack of punch to it. The beer is overall tasteless and nothing exciting to it at all. Not recommended."
"D- I would drink this at the bar if it was the only thing offered. Another gateway beer for some people."
"A good intro to craft, I think."
"This is a good macro...out of all the other selections at the bar, I usually go with Amberbock because it is the same price as all the others. It is a little darker (but not fuller) and in my opinion tastes better than any other Busch product and is easier to drink"
"Very little body for a dark beer, but the malts do show up in the mouthfeel. Local Kroger sells it for $6.49 a six pack(geez $25.96/case). At that price the price value just isn't there (at least for me)."
"Not as bad as I thought it would be, and an OK macro. But for Bock, this is pretty plain, not a big shock. Decent drinker, not one to come running back in a hurry for."
"Pretty easy to drink brew. I had a couple with my barbecue brisket and they went down easily."
"pours a crystal clear brown with a white head that quickly fades to a small amount of lace. not a bad amount of malty aroma, kind of a nice surprise from the people at anheuser-bush. the extra effort seems to have tapered off there though, the taste lacks the malty backgound that I would have liked, and has a sharpness that I don't think compliments this particular lager. The mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side, with more than ample carbonation... step away from the rice, seriously dude."
"AB must be doing its research on what it's customers like, but this one falls short. It makes me want a double bock. I don't think I'll buy more soon."
"drinkability: I suppose it's drinkable but I tend to personally prefer more flavor. I only find the toastiness slightly offensive."
"Notes: I have to say that I will probably buy this beer again under the right circumstances. I was cheap ($5.99 a 6) it wasn't offensive and for a party or a cookout it would work. It also stuck me as being a possible gateway beer. Overall, a reasonable attempt by one of the BIG THREE and I have to say I'm looking forward to some other attempts from Michelob."
"Overall, I am not impressed with this offering by AB and I most likely would not order it again and certainly would not purchase it."
"This is definately one of the better beers from Anheuser Bush. The appearance has some character with an amber color and a weak white head. The nose had a lone malt component. The taste was of mild malts and slightly sweet. Light body and big carbonation bubbles. Not bad."
"D: Not bad at all, didn't expect a lot from AB, but this is pretty good, would have again."
"This beer is an afront to Amber Bocks. It pours translucent brown with a small but noticeable head. But it is all down hill from there. It has a slight aroma of dark malt that carries through to the foretaste. But after that the beer has nothing. It crosses the tongue and changes to mere water. Worse, there is an ever so slight funky bitterness on the finish - not a skunked, bad bottle bitterness. This is clearly intentional. But it is bad. The mouthfeel is watery and sad. Whatever meager virtues that regular Michelob may have seem to have completely escaped the brewers on this misbegotten effort."
"Brownish amber colored beer with no real distinguishing aroma.Taste is a light toasty caramel with a warm finish.This is probably a beer that both macro and micro drinkers can agree on.I would recommend to try and for myself I would buy again.Slightly better than average!!"
"Drinkability negatively impacted by the timid flavor, lack of complexity and thick foam."
"Won't look for this one, but I wouldn't refuse it either."
"I remembered this beer being one of my favorites prior to my full introduction into the craft beer world, so I actually came into this ready to evaluate this as I would any beer, and with at least decent expectations. Poured into a Michelob pilsner glass, it looks pretty good. About the color you would expect from a bock, with a pretty decent head. I go to smell it...practically nothing. Even with my nose almost in the beer, I only get faint whiffs of what I can only describe as a macro ""beery"" smell. I take a sip...nothing. How can a bock be so flavorless??? I only get VERY faint hints of toasted malt grain with a VERY slight touch of simple bitterness. That is it. The only reason this isn't rated lower for smell and taste is because it isn't offensive on either, just...well not there. The box said something about how the Brewmasters believe that I will never get such a flavorful beer that is so easy to drink. Bullshit. Mouthfeel...not bad, just overcarbonated, but the amount of body is on par with the style. Goes down easy, but not overly drinkable because of the extremely bland taste. This will be my last encounter with this beer."
"D: Ok drinkability overall. Taste could have been a little bit better and the mouthfeel could have been a little thicker. Did pretty well to fill you up like a bock, however. Overall, decent, but nothing too impressive."
"D: really, I didn't even finish the one I was served, what good is happy hour with crappy beer."
"Since I like Michelob, I also like this one. However I grade according to style, and while this is a good drinkable lager, it's not a great bock."
"On tap at East Providence Lanes, Newport Ave, RI"
"Drinkability: It is average at best."
"This is a pretty faithful, if average, interpretation of the style. It poured with a medium sized head and a translucent black body. The taste had some of that rich malt character that you expect in the style, but it wasn't there in spades. Overall, not bad at all, and a good bet of the money is short. I'd pick it up over Shiner Bock."
"Don;t waste your time."
"This beer is no bock, nut more of just an amber colored lager from AB. More marketing ploys, but no backing it up int he flavor or authenticity departments. It's passable, but not by much."
"D: Not really an enjoyable beer to drink, does not look or smell or taste all that great, the mouthfeel is sorta fake feeling but at least it gives some life to this otherwise dull beer, even if that bubbliness goes against the style guidelines just a bit. Would not recomend, I'd direct someone to a Shiner or a Huber or a Bergoff before I told someone to grab this beer, no matter how cheap it is."
"D - This really is a pretty good mass produced beer from A-B. Not a great bock, but drinkable when the situation arises."
"Drinkability: better than BMC. I would prefer these at a cookout as a quencher."
"The good ol' two for one at Chili's...came to the table with zero head and dark reddish brown color. Zero lacing. Sweet aroma. Taste was decent - sweet maltiness with dry hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was actually a little flat in the carbonation department but not bad...medium body I would say. Drinkability is good because you can drink quite a few and it really isn't terrible. Usually one of the few beers of color at a lot of chain restaurant bars so isn't a bad fall back in a pinch."
"This beer poured a reddish-tinted brown with a fluffy three-finger head. The scent was subtle and mostly malt with a bit of toastiness. The taste is predominately sweet toasted malts with some of the caramel or toffee tastes that characterize the style. The mouthfeel was a little thin without an overbearing amount of carbonation. Not a bad effort for a macrobrew, I wouldn't be surprised if there's more of this beer in my future."
"without a doubt this is the best beer that AB has to offer. pours a dark brown with a .5"" head that disspates rather quickly. The nose is a chalky sweetbread with a alchohol metallic note. Taste is malty, caramel...sweet with a dash of hops finishing dry. Quite flavorful actually... this isn't mastercraft by any means but considering the source not bad at all. VERY IMPORTANT to get a fresh bottle with this one....mine was born about 3 weeks ago and it tastes great. A nice come home from work taster at a moderate price. only negatives...a little metallic in the finish and mouthfeel is subpar....but taste for a macro at 5.99 is not bad at all. the only AB beer you'll EVER find in MY fridge."
"D- good here though cuz it's like drinkin soda."
"Mouthfeel was very thin..a bit of work needed here."
"I love getting these at bars that do cheap drafts, because out the usual suspects (Bud, BL, Coors Light and Miller Lite) this is the only macro that isn't complete garbage. Has a nice, thick, brownish body so the eyes are fooled. Because in reality there is very little malt or hops to even consider this a quality beer, yet alone a bock. It is extremely watery and plain, but the smoothness makes it easy to kill your glass. I like having one of these with a meal because it is like having a soda with your meal but you can still feel manly knowing you had a beer with your burger."
"i wouldn't mind seeing the manufacturing process of this."
"If this is your only choice besides BMC...go for it."
"I saw this beer advertised via a neon sign, now I must admit it caught my eye, so I figured I must give it a try. It as I voted was merely average it was not good not bad just decent. It diod produce a nice head and had a nice deep golden color about it, it had a smooth mouthfeel and barely any after taste but all in all was just ok..."
"Not a bad offering from a brewery that creates one of the most disgusting beers of our time (Michelob Li**t). But the Amber Bock is one of those beers that, given little choice in a smalltown supermarket, you wouldn't exactly disgrace yourself by trying."
"This is my ""macro session beer of choice"" if macro is my only option."
"Pours a deep amber/brown color with a slightly tan/off white head. It has an aroma of nicely roasted malt and some hops. The taste delivered just that. Nice roasted malts blended very well with the hops. Not what I was expecting from michelob. I was pleasantly surprised. The mouthfeel was good and it was a very drinkable beer with a good amount of flavor."
"Every now and then I get this... fellow beer enthusiasts will stumble seeing me drink 'anything' from AB. It's an easy beer to buy by the case, and give out to fellow beer snobs who admit never trying it. This usually results in surprised or grudging praise for the beer."
"I remember when I was not of legal drinking age thinking that this stuff was great because it had a bit more of a whallop than most beers. I've had it a couple more times now that my palate is a bit more refined, and found it very tame. It really paired nicely with the fajitas I had, and it was highly drinkable."
"Poured a clean clear amber brownish color. Decent head that dissipated quickly. Slight lacing in the glass. Smells of grass with a slight caramel malt tone. Not the best smelling brew but still had some distinct malt tones. Seeing I am in St. Louis I guess I should give it a shot. There is also a grassy scent mixed in there. Taste is smooth with a light malt flavor up front. Some sweet caramel tones mixed with a dough like flavor. Very light bodied. Not my favorite but had an easy drinkability. Certainly has a malted profile. No real hop notes in there at least not on my tongue. Maybe a trace in the finish. This brew is certainly not on my list as a great beer but it is decent I guess. I would not go out of my way to drink it thats for sure. I never really steer towards the big three but had to give it a shot."
"Overall: Better than any other of Michelob's lager offerings. Nonetheless, a little on the light side, but not too bad."
"Overall, a great choice if you need something tasty."
"I am going to say that this one is a beer I can get behind as far as Michelob is concerned. I do enjoy this one. It is by far the beer I order when I am at Henry Hudsons Pubs in OKC. Of all the beers they make this one stands out as the most memerobal beer around. By the way sorry for the spelling mistakes."
"A deep amber color is noted once poured into a glass. The smell is about average and definately suited to the fall season. While the taste is rich with hints of caramel, a nice touch. The first time that I had this beer was at a college in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. I was at a friends house and he was raving about AmberBock, and it is a good beer overall."
"Drinkable. Amongst the macrobrews, clearly one of my faves."
"D = Nothing wrong with this beer, could easily drink several of them. That said, there are many more interesting and flavorful beers so I do not think I will seek this out again."
"Amber Bock is more like an American Amber Lager than a Bock  too plain for me. Make sure you drink this brew when cold, as taste went downhill as it warmed."
"It's basically Budweiser but with roasted malts. This is more an American Amber Lager than a Bock."
"D - Its one of the better AB offerings I'll drink it the bar only has macros on tap its not bad"
"Me like...and me will buy again when circumstances insist apon it...Though it's not a bock...it was a gateway beer for me...led to drinking of authentic bock..."
"Pours a dark amber color with a one-finger head.Aroma is nice and malty with some smokiness and the simple lines of a standard bock. Taste is somewhat watery though and it's obviously a Michelob thing. Somewhat sweet as well with caramel aftertaste. Still quite drinkable but other than that, not much to rave about."
"Drinkability is pretty good and nothing really offends. I have to give A-B credit for at least trying! If I have to have an American macro in the future, then this will be the one. If they'd just kick the flavor up a notch or two this could be pretty good. As is, it doesn't really compare with a true bock."
"I drink this because the selection at my golf course is limited and this is the best they have on tap. As such I have consumed many pitchers of Amber Bock. It pours a light carmel color with modest foam. The aroma is low average for beer in general but better than Budweiser or worse yet Lite. There is some taste, more then its rice-brew cousin. And though it is certainly no great beer, I would have to call it quite drinkable because I keep drinking it."
"D - Low for me, one was enough. I think I was expecting something more beer like, this had a wine sort of feel to it in my opinion. Far too sweet with a sour finish, not what I like in my beer. I wouldn't recommend this to a brew lover, but to someone who doesn't like ""beer"" tastes, this could be perfect."
"D: It was smooth and easy to drink (low ABV, moderate corbonation and diluted sweetness). However, other than the sweet stickiness it had little to make it interesting."
"Finshes sweet, and just right. My favorite AB offering, behind Brewmasters Private Reserve. If nobody knew this was an AB product, I guarantee it would be a higher rated beer. But, alas, it is infected with the macro stigma."
"Pours out a light, caramel color, very easy to see through, but it has a fairly decent head. It has a nice smell for a normal beer, but a bit week for a bock; a little malty, nothing great, but nothing bad, either. Tastes all right, but again, nothing like a real bock, and nothing truly outstanding. Goes down very easily, though, with perhaps just a bit too much carbonation. If you want to move someone from macros to micros, though, this would be a nice beer to start slowly with."
"Pours very small laced head does not last long, but that's what you would expect from a macro. Smell of caramel malt, toasted malt charachter, but not strong. It has that typical refreshing taste that you get from an American Macro, more like I'm getting my 12oz of water intake with my beer. It does have a malty taste, but not a whole lot of flavor. For the price (since it's a macro) it ain't that bad, kinda an answer to Killians in a way. This is not a Bock for sure. It is an insult to real Bocks. But it is a drinkable beer(lager)"
"This beer is not bad for a break from some of the light BMC beers. Appearance is brown and transparent. Head is there, but minimal. Smell is OK with some hints of caramel and burnt wood. Taste is OK with some of the smells carrying over in to the taste. Mouthfeel is light and watery, but with a touch of malt. Drinkable beer on a good tailgating weekend."
"Drinkability- Hmmm, much better than expected, but still barely a bock. Drinkable for sure though when given a lack of choice."
"mouthfeel is weak as well, watery, but thats what's to be expected of this beer, it tastes good acutally, just real weak, its the perfect fishing/golfing , or anything that requires you to drink straight out of the bottle beer. it's not great, but its drinkable as hell. I generally keep a sixer of this around for outdoor activities."
"Decent effort from Anheuser-Busch, much better than the better-selling Bud or Bud Light. Dark and malty, but still a bit bland. Better choice than their stable of cheap pale lagers. Still it is lacking in aroma and the flavor is weak. Mouthfeel is decent. Drinkability is pretty high because there is really nothing offensive with this beer."
"Michelob Amber Bock is probably a bit more Amber than Bock. A nice classy looking bottle and decent beer for being domestic. Slightly better than average. Goes down better alone than with food."
"Drinkability - Not too bad."
"Again, grab a microbrew instead"
"First time I tried this beer. BOD Jul 23 07. Poured in a pint glass. Rich amber color with an off white head that disappears quickly. Smooth taste that has a little bitterness but, carmel and malt aftertaste. Finishes cleaner than other brews in this class that I have tried. Very good macro brew for the price. Made in my hometown."
"Easy drinking and more flavorfull than other Bud products, decent bridge to good beers."
"Overall I'd say this beer has more going for it than against it"
"It pours out a nice semi-dark amber color with a really tempting head thats thick and fluffy and has a good sweet aroma to it. It gradually dissipates into a thin layer and the body has some good carbonation to it and theres some mild lacing; it hits your tongue with a smooth feeling thats bitter and semi-sweet and has a caramel aftertaste that compliments the bitterness in it. After it warms up the bitterness tends to wane and you can really taste the caramel and malts."
"Have no complaints about this beer. $16 for a 20-variety pack is well worth it. Nice dark taste but not too overpowering. When I don't want to spend ten bucks for a nice 6-pack and I don't want to drink filtered straw-water, I know I'll be happy with this medium priced and good tasting Michelob."
"For someone who wants a malty lawnmower beer, this is it."
":)"
"Not sure what the target is for this one. If you want a rich, malty lager, this isn't it. And yet it doesn't quite cut it as a lawnmower beer, either. More flavor than a standard mega-lager, but not by much."
"Kind of thin and watery. This will be ok in a pinch, but not really that great. Not much ""bock"" to it."
"-Shoehornteeth."
"Overall, not a horrible beer, just a bad example of a great style, imho. Not really one i get unless the resturaunt only carries the bud line."
"I had high hopes for this one. Found it in a ""make your own 6 pack"" aisle and thought I'd try it. I'd tasted it before, but wanted to give it a fighting chance at a review. Deep red/brown color in the glass, no head to speak of (perhaps a little foam at the edges). Surprisingly little carbonation. Smell was almost all malt--dark, carmely malt but with a strange ""artificial"" sweetness to it. Taste was the same. Roasted to burnt on the tongue with a weird, metallic aftertaste. Not altogether bad--and something I'd order when only macros are available--but just not anything like the craft-brewed or imported dark German bocks. Again, quite drinkable, just not worth the higher cost."
"This is way more drinkable than the other Anheiser Busch offerings at most events. But there a lot more beers that I'd rather drink a lot of, if you know what I mean."
"The bottle states this is a dark lager and it is an ok beer for what it tries to be. This might be the best AB beer unless you prefer the Brewmasters Reserve. The color, smell and taste are all good but I do consider it a dark lager as opposed to a bock, I can't really complain about anything concerning this beer. I think this is a very good session beer and should not be dismissed just because it is from one of the big boys."
"Poured into a plastic cup, it's dark in appearance with a nice creamy looking head. a little bit of cooked veggies in the smell, but is then smuthered by the sweetish malts and some caramel. It had a decent flavor, better than the rice-laden one of recent past, but is still lacking somethng. It was rather thin-feeling, not what you want from something labled as a bock. Not bad overall, a faux-bock created for the masses."
""
"Poured a deep russet brown, with no head anda very minimal lace, decent carbonation was evident. Smell was grainey with a slighlty off fruit aroma in the back anda hint at some bitterness. The taste intresting,albeit not very comple x at all. Sort of a glammed up amber. Lots of malt with a slight bittering hops presence and a hint at maybe something fruity in the back? If its there it is very faint. Overall I cannot say it is horrible as I have had much much worse beer. But the PBR I have after it was better if that give you any idea. Its worth a try and I am sure we have all tried it, so it is what it is."
"This brew seems like it's trying really hard to be a bock, but just not quite there. Reminds me of the local favorite, Shiner Bock. Just another beer that fills that void between piss and craft beer."
"I bought this beer at a local store. I like dark beers and thought I would give this one a try. When I first took a taste, it didnt taste like typical dark beers. It was rather sweet. It didnt really have much of a flavor other than that. It had a good head that disapeared rather fast and it also tasted a little sweet. Even the head wasnt as creamy as Ive had in the past. The carbonation was not excessive. The second one grew on me a little bit. It tasted better than the first one. Perhaps this beer with regular drinking would grow on me. If the price was right, I would consider buying this beer again. Infact, down the road I know I will buy this beer again."
"Drinkability- This isn't the first time I bought this beer and i'm sure that it won't be the last. It is extremely drinkable for the price. One or two with some grilled meat makes for a good time. Drinking six plus of these is easy as well. Makes for a decent bass."
"M&D: There is a lot of carbonation here and the drinkability is reduce to casual, but the beer is smooth on the tounge."
"Not outstanding, but palatable. Actually for an American macrobrew it's better than average. Appearance is typical but nice. Aroma is weak but beery, malty, assuring one that it is indeed beer. Flavor is malty with no bitterness. It goes down smoothly and pleasantly, making it a good choice for a party or with dinner."
"this beer is probably my favorite out of AB. I do not hate AB like many ppl seem to, but i aslo do not think their beers are what i would choose to drink. That said they provide a cheap and affordable bridge into the beer world, my first beer ever was a bud select the night i turned 21. none of this factors into my review however, and the one thing that AB does well, is their beer is always drinkable, may not taste the best or have alot of depth, but its always easy going down, and this beer is no different"
"pours out of the bottle a very deep amber colour, with an inch high head supported by fine carbonation. light grain aroma, some sugary notes. malty flavours...some caramel notes and brown sugar overtures. there is some discernible hopping, which makes for a slightly welcome bitter finish. straight forward and pleasant if not a bit underwhelming. medium bodied and a mouthfeel that leans more toward the pale lager side rather than any bock comparisons. the label does say ""dark lager", and that might be a more apt description for this brew. although it probably is a half step beyond the dark lager category. anyway...it's highly drinkable and tasty for an A-B product. worth visiting every now and again, especially on tap if no other better offering is available."
"A mediocre beer, but, the first time I had it, it was (to my surprise) better than I had anticipated. Definitely not a bock by any stretch of the imagination, though it is one of the better macro beers I've had. Easy conversion beer for the Bud fans? More than likely, it's just a way us beer geeks can survive at a bar with a crummy selection..."
"overall this is a decent beer, much cheaper than most of the style but....lives up to AB's ""strict"" quality. In finish you get what you pay for"
"Pours a perfectly clear, dark amber with coffee-brown highlights and a slightly off-white head that fades to a ring. Attractive. On the nose, not much to tell there's a slight, yeasty fruitiness, but it's kind of below perception threshold, so it's difficult to pin down what the fruits are. A touch of graininess as well, but it's a pretty mild (or, bland) nose. The taste is pretty mild overall. It starts off with some metallic notes and then some nice, roasty Munich malts at the mid-palate. The finish veers back toward metals. These flavors are of medium quality; nothing offensive, nothing revelatory. Mouthfeel is light for the style, with good balancing carbonation. Overall, this is a solid beer. It shouldn't win any awards, but it is a decent beer that would be an excellent fallback if stranded in an all-AB world."
"D- pretty drinkable. I would drink definately drink it again. a major plus is you can find it much cheaper than most bock beers."
"12oz brown bottle (all-malt version). Clear copper-brown body with a half an inch of off-white head. Smells a bit on the weak side, but c aramel malt dominates. Tastes roasty and caramelly too, sweet. Medium in body. Very drinkable. Not sure I'd call with one a bock still, but aside from being slightly weak, I have no problem with this beer,and I can deffinitely see drinking this one again when I'm a little strapped for cash, or maybe even when I'm not. Good stuff."
"¡Salud!"
"Amber brown. Virtually zero head. No lace either. Clear. Smell is of iodine. Foul smelling. Taste is brakish. Like a macro with some malt powder in it. A malted macro. Body is thin. Highly carbonated. I wanted to give this one a shot but it just plain sucks. Nothing bocklike about this."
"Appearance is a light amber copper (penny like), with a moderate to thin tannish off white head that holds up while drinking. Very clear and is moderately carbonated, very bubbly. A light malt aroma is present. Some lacing on the sides of the glass. Taste is a very mild hop taste with no bitterness or dryness in the aftertaste. Goes down very smooth and feels somtwhat moderate to light in the mouthfeel. An average beer that could be consumed,especially on hot summer nights."
"Very drinkable, not filling, can have a few of these in a sitting."
"Drinkability is awful! thats right same as its rated , you can drink 4 and start falling asleep, they seem to put SMG in this as well. Id rather have a bud!"
"A pretty drinkable beer, and almost definitely the best A-B beer on the market. But there is almost always a better choice than this one."
"Cheers2Beers"
"This one is a decent drinker. Crisply carbonated and smooth on the palette, but with much better flavor than the typical BMC junk (yes, I am aware that this is an A-B product) you will usually find on draft at the same places this is served. I'd never actively seek this beer, but when the only alternatives are Bud, Coors Light, and Corona I will gladly take it."
"DA: Just thought I would give it a shot, and it only cost me $1.05 for the bottle."
"Had one with a pizza...not much selection at this establishment...probably should have ordered the PBR instead."
"Presented in a 12 oz bottle, born on date 21DEC06. Pours into a frosty mug a dark red color with lively carbonation fueling a 1-finger brownish head that fades quickly leaving a spotty cap. Fairly average here. Nose of sweet malt and a slight iron metallic scent. Tastes of corn adjuncts and not much else, no real malt character all all. A tiny bit bitter upon the finish. Mouth is quite bubbly yet smooth, watery and a somewhat thin. Drinkabilty is pretty ho-hum; this is basically a red-colored macro. Really theres nothing to it. Avoid."
"This might be good for the ""cheap beer connoisseur"" who wants to fork out an extra dollar for something ""darker"" on a special occasion. Otherwise, understand that this is pretty much a typical A-B product and nothing worth buying. I can't even see this as being a good transition beer for someone wanting to get into craft beer. This is a beer for people who are already in the Budweiser fan club. If you're not, get something else, this is not worth your time or money."
"Drank easy enough, just not a bock. Still, would take this over a shiner or BMC any day"
"Large chalice ordered at Lone Star. Murky brown/amber. Decent lacing. Not great, but WAY better than I was expecting. Lagers are my least favorite (I know the lable says 'Bock' but c'mon) but this was tolerable. Faint aroma. Roasted malts no real hop addition."
"While I'm not overly impressed with this AB offering, I think it is a step away from fizzy yellow flavorless light beers, and that is a step in the right direction."
"I've had worse. Much worse. Drinkable as far as a macro goes. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it. However, it is usually the most flavorful offering at the bars in my area."
"Note: Why is this beer classified under the Bock style? Just because it says bock doesn't make it so. Not much here, but just enough to dislike."
"Overall, this is a modest example of the bock style. It lacks some complexity and it's a bit thinner than most bock's I've had. However, for being widely available (and from a macro) it's not that bad of a beer."
"Off tap this yields a decent dark amber, but loses it's head very quickly. It tends to give off a bit of a sour scent, with little there at all. The taste is rather bland and lacking in anything. It goes does watery and lifeless. It's drinkable more so after a few better choices if you are seeking something more than swill, but less that quality."
"D - Not a bad beer, but nowhere near good....and definitely not very bockish."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Got this one on tap, beer was amber brown with a white foamy head. The smell was sweet, of amber and caramel malts. The taste is initially of the nose with a slightly hoppy finish. The beer has a light, creamy mouthfeel. Overall this is a pretty drinkable beer, light and not offensive...not impressive either though."
"Overall a decent and drinkable brew. Sessionble and perhaps a good gateway beer."
"A decent brew. I got this pint on draft at Prime Time Sports Grill. It was a dark brown color with about 2 fingers of head. The retention was fast and there was little lace but the lace that was there was sticky. The smell was malty. The taste and mouthfeel were both well blended. Good brew. Don't drink and review."
"The taste is surprisingly good. Very uncomplicated and, again, nothing offensive. This is actually a rather refreshing brew and one I don't mind having with dinner. This is a very drinkable session beverage and I'd take it over many imported amber/dark lagers."
"Not all that great but if the alternative is Michelob Ultra Lite, what can you do?"
"Would I buy this again? Probably not. The taste isn't too bad, but I prefer some hop bite in my beer, along with some carbonation."
"Michelob Amber Bock pours a dark brown with a small white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is very little aroma, maybe a slight amount of malt. Mostly tasteless as well, some malt and that's it. Tastes watery, not very bock like. No off flavors, but not much flavor period."
"Taste is very sweet and thin bodied. My beer may be a bit warm so it doesnt really taste very good. As I recall, this beer cold isnt much better. As far as a popular Bock, Shiner is probably a little better but not by much. Has more flavor and body than the other AB offerings. Drinkable due to fairly low abv."
"12 oz., ""born-on"" 8/21/06, and pours a dark amber with medium carbonation and a finger of tan head that leaves light lacing. The aroma is pretty nondescript with mild grains or toasted malts and adjuncts. Very, very light. The only flavors I can detect are light toasted/caramel malts on top of a light, tingly body that leaves short finish. Overall, unmemorable - essentially tastes like Michelob but with traces of darker malts. And I don't think one can make a real bock with adjuncts."
"This beer poured a dark amber color with a thick head that did no last long. The smell was sweet and malty. The taste was mild and malty. The mouthfeel is not thin, but not quite full bodied. The carbonation is noticeable. This would be a very drinkable beer that is smooth and easy to kick back, just not particularly interesting."
"The taste was watered down and lacked any character. Just another mass produced beer that they are trying to market to the beer enthusiasts. I will try this over most other mass produced beers, but will pass it by if there are any other true micros around."
"Leave this one in the box."
"Reddish copper body with almost no head. The aroma is faintly sweet and malty. Taste is on par with the smell, there just isn't alot there. Starts with a light sweetness and finished up with a slight bitterness. Feel is a little thin and watery. I believe I could drink a lot of these but why would I want to unless nothing else is available? Overall not a bad beer, it's better than most macros, but it's nothing special."
"I have a soft spot for the Amber Bock. Probably the best macro beer you can find on tap south of the Mason-Dixon line. Pours with a light head and a dark, transparent copper color, almost like a Oktoberfest. Missing most of the depth of flavor, but they did bring along some of the malty sweetness."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good."
"Had on tap at the golf club on a hot day. Not a bad beer for a BMC macro. Nice dark color with lingering off-white head, and some lacing. Aroma was mild, but had some malty roasted nut undertones. This had an okay taste, and smooth finish. All and all, not a bad beer for the price."
"Michelob Amber Bock was a dark amber color and very clear. The off-white head was quick to dissapear, leaving no lacing. The aroma was mainly malt. The taste was lightly malty as well. The mouthfeel was light with medium carbonation. It's an easy drinking, fairly tasteless beer."
"Drinkable as city tap water from an old pipe."
"If one is branching out to explore ""new"" beers I wouldn't recommend this one. It' s misleading because it isn't a real amber bock. But enjoyable non the less."
"Not much of a bock, more a light lager with dark features."
"I was relegated to drinking this at a football tailgate where the beer was provided by others. It was this or Bud light which unfortunately I actually tried again. This looks like a decent beer with very little nose other than some slight maltiness. The taste was o.k. and ambrosia compared to stump water bud light. It had as expected no mouthfeel as pracically no macros do. The drinkability is pretty good if you don't mind the aftertaste which is a little bitter and not in a good hoppy way."
"So this beer isn't great, but it's better than drinking miller lite, bud light, or coors light all night."
"D: Easily approachable, I find it a little syrupy."
"Poured into a pilsner, had a dark reddish colour with visible carbination and a practically non existant head (it was a quick pour and all i got was a slight ring) lacing was also minimal. The smell wasnt stong at all, but i was picking up sweet malts. The taste was sweet and enjoyable, with caramel being the most obvious flavour for me. I didnt really taste any hops at all though and i think i would have enjoyed just a little hop bitterness in the finish as i find the overall taste a little one dimensional. The mouthfeel in my opinion is the weakest characteristic. Like many said its light bodied and quite watery and in my opinion detracts from the taste a little.To its credit though, as the beer warmed the mouthfeel got creamier and a little more enjoyable. Overall though, even though the beer is a little plain and light, i did enjoy it and would drink a few if there was none of my favourites around"
"The first mistake Michelob made was to call this a bock, it really doesn't seem to fit into that style. However, I think a lot of folks will immediately dislike this beer just because it has the name Michelob on it. Despite all that, it's really not a bad beer for what it is. Pours a dark reddish amber color with a thin head that fades quickly. Aroma of soft malt, caramel. Fairly lively carbonation with a thin body, but for this particular beer, the carbonation fits nicely. A little on the sweeter side, but not cloyingly so. Very little hops presence to offset the sweet maltiness. An easy drinking beer and refreshing on a hot day without being too heavy."
"This beer is farmost one of my most favored domestic beers in the United States. Since I am not a fan of light beers, this is a nice dark beer. It is not to dark, where it is hard to drink. The beer is very easy to drink and has a great taste. If I were to walk into a beer distributor 9 times out of 10 I would walk out with this beer. I recommend this beer to everyone, it is truely a great beer."
"Overall, not a bad AB product. Easy to drink and not too bad in the taste department. I wouldn't turn one down, and would even buy a case if I had to go to a picnic or something."
"Overall the scent is good, but I will never have this one again."
"This one needs some tweaking. The theme here is it is overly sweet and too thin. If these two things were fixed this would be a passable stab at the style. As it stands now, it's not."
"Quite sweet but the body ruins this beer. It is way too thin to fit the bock profile. This reminds me of Michelob's entry into the dark beer world. No real flaws but no umph either."
"I was in a dimly lit room, so I couldn't really tell the color. Dark brown was all I could see, couldn't pick up on the subleties. It had a quickly desolving head but left a decent lace. At first drink it had a very sweet taste, which lasted all the way through. Smooth beer overall. I ate it with a New York Strip, which complemented it nicely. I'd get this again."
"There are too many other beers of about the same price that are much better. It's not horrible, but not anything near notable either."
"overall, this beer should not have the word Bock anywhere near it, it is a weak, watery, boring brew. i guess its better than Budweiser though, not much to say about this one, unimpressive."
"This is a dark lager more than anything. Similiar to Heineken Dark. A decent offering from Anheuser-Busch."
"Had this at a crap-tastic bar out of town, best beer in the joint. Into a pint glass, actually a fantastic pour, a thick and creamy head that lasted a good 5 minutes, slightly dark amber in color, and pretty good lacing. Served a little too cold, waited for it to warm to smell faint, mildly roasted malt. Crisp yet smooth and creamy mouth lead to a pretty weak but pleasant malt and hop bitter with a non-existant aftertaste. Like all other AB products it seems, meant to be drank, then forgotten. That said, this was one of my college go-to beers, cheap enough yet had enough taste."
"The color was an amber/red with a quickly dissipating head. The smell had a light malt aroma and was fairly mild. The taste was pretty good with a medium/light and crisp body and mild hops that wasn't too overpowering. The mouthfeel was average and crisp with medium/high carbonation. I felt that this was a pretty drinkable beer with a decent amount of body to keep me satisfied as well as a crisp refreshing taste. Good all-around beer."
"very clear medium dark brown with a half-finger head that is a creamy light tan. a lightly toasty malt that lends a touch of earthiness to the nose. i taste the toasty malt and a quite spicy hop. mouthfeel is just a tad more substantial than your average macro cheap beer. overall i think this is a decent brew and a little unfairly discriminated against because of its close relation to macro-poop."
"Looks like soda, except the head stayed up for a few seconds longer. Still, it was a brownish amber with big bubbles, no lacing, and little retention. Smelled like...wort! What the hell? Is this a non-alcoholic? Also a vague toasted graininess in the nose. The flavor was strange as well - plasticized caramel flavoring trying to meld with a decent barley component. Sweet, again my mind cannot shake the whole soda idea. Is this Malta Goya or what? Thin and, well, yech...."
"At a shit bar and what is there to drink. Hmm. A pitcher of Mick Amber Bock should do me well. To play pool and celebrate a little this beer isn't half bad. Amber, well not quite the color is a few SRM too dark, but who's counting in held a head for a while and laced the pitcher I was drinking from. Smelled of bland lager clean beer with a hint of roast and a distinct sweetness. The taste was underwhelming not really malty more like the memory of a good beer and the hops were pretty much non-exsistant. The mouthfeel was some what there but mostly not and the aftertaste is not really a desired thing. I had a pitcher and it was better than most light nasty on tap, but I think it is still close to avoid even though my rating might be higher."
"Dark clear ruby red beat sugar flavor and no head even though carbonation was OK. I could not finish this beet sugar water...could be because I had left Pizza Port and all their good brews and went to a crappy bar that had only this. If I could give a negative score on flavor I would. I feel bad about such a bad review but this beer is terrible. I may try it again in the bottle and then re rate"
"PH"
"Clear reddish amber color with a thin lace for a head. The aroma is weak. Just a hint of toasted grains. Taste is average at best. Toasted grains and a touch of sweetness. A little bit of hop can be tasted. Has an odd sweet finish. Light body makes it drinkable. This beer is ok, but it is no bock."
"I have this on-tap at a local Italian place pretty regularly, hold up fairly decently even though it's a macro. Pretty much average all the way down the line, decent enough, but nothing to seek out."
"D- Not a bad beer when the choice is Bud, Bud Lite, and similar beers. Its a bit sweet but I can handle that. It needs a deeper and richer taste to be a really good beer."
"Nice dark amber body, but with a minimal head that barely holds together. Decently malty aroma, but not a great deal of depth, with a very slight backnote of hops. Taste is clean and crisp, a pretty weak flavor for a bock, but pleasant nevertheless. Mouthfeel is pretty thin for the style. Nicely drinkable. This is clearly a bock beer for macro lovers. Easy to drink, and not much else except a bit of malt."
"For micro/craft drinkers: try if your curious, if not, this might not be your thing."
"When poured, it showed a color so dark brown, that it could be discribed as black, with nice tan foam. The smell of roasted malts and mild hops filled the nose. The taste was of a mild nature. The roasted malts and hops were very pleasant, with a hint of fruitiness. Not a bitter or sour taste or after taste."
"The alcohol really dries out the finish on this one, especially when combined with the hollow taste profile. The result is a beer that can be poured down your throat (or drain) quite easily, but perhaps not all that pleasantly (at least for the throat option)."
"A good beer to have around that is pretty good for a Macro American product that your buddies will drink too. I rated it average because it is better than most stuff you can get from AB but is not as good as some other bock beers out there."
"This beer I had once before and I was like ""not too bad nothing i'm after though.' I tried it now a year later and I must say after a few sips it tasted like crap to me. It smells kinda sour and bitter not too good really. The taste is awful. It's sorta malty then just dark brown sludgy tasting. I did not like this. I was shocked because I thought it was supposed to be so darn good. The mouthfeel was sludgy I thought. The drinkability was low because it was just not an appealing beer at all tastewise and then the carbonation was so much I was burping up for about 10 minutes."
"Cheers!"
"Taste, none. This beer had so little taste to it, I might as well of saved some money and had an Ultra. Not impressed."
"Poured dark brown . Smells of slight , dark malt . Taste is pretty good , malty and fairly rich , yet fairly simple. Finish is kinda sweet. Overall a tasty and very drinkable beer from Anheuser-busch. Iv'e been to the theme park in Florida -Busch Gardens _ You can get a couple free Amber Bocks if you want. They taste alot better at the park on tap. Fresh and malty!"
"Overall, it can be drinkable due to the lack of carbonation and anything that gives it character. Certainly not a good beer in the style. Again, this is exactly like flat coca cola."
"Shakey's pizza has some sort of deal with AB that allows them to call this beer Shakey's ale or something like that. Its actually Michelob Amber."
"Pours a copper color, some carbonation, small head, some lacing throughout the drink. The scent is kinda sweet, fruity, and slightly malty. The taste is malty, but a little bit watery, the aftertaste is a little bitter. Light-medium body. Drinkable, but I would not buy again."
"Mildly astringent with a malty aftertaste that dies fast. Lightly carbonated with a medium light body. While it is much better than most A-B product (save Celebrate), this beer is not even up to mid-pack standards. Sadly, it is more show than go. A Bock it ain't. Drink it you like your pale, yellow, fizzy lagers and want to try something you think is very different."
"This is a drinkable beer, especially at $1 a glass, but its nothing special."
"Pours a dark brown with a decent head and some lacing. Smell is of a typical macro lager, but with some roasted grain and maybe a hint of some coffee. There is maybe a little bit of coffee in the taste, hard to sense any hops even though the label suggests a perfect balance of hops, saying that this taste existed in this beer is just being nice, it just tasted so off, I expected a lot more from this. Mouthfeel was overcarbonated and on the thin side. Drinkability was awful to me, I thought at the very least this would be drinkable, but I just do not care for this, it is almost a task to finish."
"Nice rich dark amber color (duh) with a light white head that dissipates quickly. The beer aroma is rather dull, there is a bare hint of toasted barley and also a kind of metallic aroma (like a galvanized steel bucket). The flavor is a little bolder than bland but not overwhelming - its a step up from the regular Michelob but far from a craft brew. The hops are barely noticable and the overall impression strikes me as dry, very light, refreshing but with a tad more malt character than the usual macro swill. This is FAR from a real bock - but this compares rather favorably and maybe even a touch better than the Yuengling Traditional Lager that I had last night, which is regarded as an example of an American Amber/Red lager. I think if this were in that ""style category"" it would fare better."
"I was very happy with this beer. It had a nice dark amber color to it and it held onto a decent head throughout drinking it. The smell has is malty with a bit of a toasty note. It has a nice flavor to it that follows up the aroma nicely with more toastiness and a slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel was good only slightly too watery for my tastes. Overall, great for a macro, worth trying."
"The rice twinge comes through, but you can taste the bittering hops! It's a sweet malt based beer though. Nice level of toastiness with some mild fruitness as well. Overall, it's not that much different from a normal macro lager. Slightly watery mouthfeel for a bock. Decent try, but not quite there."
"Tarnished copper color, crystal clear, with an off-white head that rises up and settles out quickly like a soda pour. Aroma of malt and brown sugar and a bit of molasses. Watery and slick mouthfeel leads to a flavor of bready malt and understated caramel. Finishes with a carbonation tingle leading to a tannic metallic lingering taste."
"Unremarkable...unmemorable....not at all a bock, for my tastes. Not bad...just nothing there."
"D- Not a bad stepping stone beer, quite plain but quite drinkable at the same time. This beer is to AB as Killians Red is to Coors. Misleading with the whole bock thing ... I'd love to see an all-malt 6.5% abv+ version from AB."
"i needed a change of pace fom the miller products id been guzzling all nite at the eagles club so i decided what the hell this was not what i was thinking it should have been but it was cold and wet it looked good in the glass that was bout itit smelled stale evidentily its not a fast mover at the old timers bar it taste like water almost a little bit of week beer all i know is i could not drink this all nite i will stick to the miller products"
"Poured out a dark amber brew with a one finger head that disappears after a minute.Very little carbonation.Smels of nothing much slight malt smell. Taste is pale,,not terrible at all but just low in flavor.Sweet malt seems to shine thru mostly very little hop balance.Its apparent that this brew was made for the slightly adventurus macro drinker and paled down as to not offend. Really not a terrible brew at all,,truthfully id have a few if its the only option id have instead of regular macros.mouthfeel nothing major,what did u expect."
"Overall I was not impressed with this beer at all. I think there are better examples of this style out there."
"A dreadfully medicore beer. Better than Bud Light, but that ain't saying much. Now where's my Sam Smith?"
"This is the single worst of the Michelob ""craft beer"" sampler pack. I've seen it in six packs. I don't know why they choose to make such a substandard beer available in sixers when several of the others are much better (the marzen and the pale ale, for example)."
"The beer pours a translucent brown with a decent head that refuses to hold. The beer smells slightly skunked but does smell nicely of some mild hops. It tastes fairly decent amount of hops but the claim of roasted hops are almost indescernable. The carbonation feels artificial but it is fairly smooth and not too watery. The hop level is its only saving grace. It tastes more like an American Macro Lager than a bock. It almosts seems as if the darkness is there to trick you."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't necessarily refuse this, and it's better than a light beer, but for the style it doesn't even remotely do it justice and is a very sub-par example. However, I'm not having trouble drinking this, as nothing is extremely unpleasant, just pretty much all mediocre / average."
"At first glance it looks jet black, but when you get a better look at it, it's actually a dark amber color with a thin head of white foam. The only thing I could smell was some malts. The taste was that of some sweet malts. The mouthfeel was a bit light and watery to me and for a bock. It's good but not that good. What can you expect from a product made by A-B. This is a beer that would make an excellent choice, if the only thing around is macros."
"Pours dark amber, clear and highly carbonated. The two finger head of an off-white color has thin consistency and soon vanishes completely. Some dark toasted notes in the nose, with faint hops. A mild, but pleasent roasted flavor is sweet and smooth, and the hop flavor only appears in the aftertaste. The light body and clean finish create a high drinkability; but a lack of character makes this a weak interpretation of the style."
"Just not that drinkable - a fakely sweetned guinness or something...can't wait to see what AB's upcoming ""craft beers"" will be like."
"A little sweet, caramelly and light on hops but a decent blend and probably a good introduction to other styles for the mass market lager drinker. ."
"I've already reviewed this beer from the bottle, the experience was almost identical from the tap with the main difference being that from the tap the sweetness of the malt/syrup is stronger. Goes down a bit smother with a cleaner finish. Overall, feelings are the same."
"Michelob's Amber Bock pours to a deep brown color with a prodigious head formation and a sweet malty nose. The palate is very light but has a touch of sweet malt and a hint of chocolate. The finish is slightly on the sweet side, no hops are discernible. The chewy, caramelly notes I want in a bock just are not here. It was never intended to be a German style bock anyway, rather it is patterned on Texas-style bocks like Shiner. In that, the beer succeeds."
"Pours a clear, reddish brown with no head. Some grainy and caramel aroma. Light bodied, crisp, clean. Some graininess and very sweet. Not very bock like, but would make a decent American macro lager. Not much hop character or bitterness. Finishes dry, no after taste. Better than the average american macro."
"A typical bastardization of a good beer by an American Macrobrewery. This bock looks overly carbonated, offwhite foam that hangs around a short while, and laces only if your glass is really dirty. Aromas are almost nil. Slight (and I do mean slight) evidence of toasted malt, bread, and toffee. No real malt aromas. Tastes disapointing even compared to the aroma. No real malt backbone, hop flavor or bittering, or spiciness or complexity. Faint flavors of toastyness, roastyness. A bit or earthyness and astingency is the only characters that add to the beer. Mouthfeel is sticky without being sweet and over carbonation masks any present flavors. Aftertaste is sticky and void. Not a good bock. It doesn't have enough character to call it a bad beer."
"Too thin for a bock. Beef up the malt a bit and add a small amount of body and it might not be too bad."
"Tasted: 06/18/05"
"This beer pours with the right color for a Bock; a very lovely dark amber color. However, unlike the norm for Bocks, the head is very small and disappears about as fast as the foam on a cola. It smells kind of caramel and grainy, nothing too special. As for taste, its quite watery, at least if you're going to call it a Bock. It is, however, better than pretty much any other macro beer, but thats really not saying a whole lot. As for the mouthfeel.. well, it tastes much like water, and really feels a lot like water too... It is pretty drinkable, but thats in comparison to other macros, and noting the fact that it really doesn't taste like too much of anything."
"Also, this is not a bock. There should be some designation for an American Bock with Shiner being the classic example. I'm not sure if its true, but I read somewhere that Shiner bock is called a bock because of an old liquor law in Texas requiring beers of certain alcholic strength to be labeled ""bock", similar to Malt Liquor is other states."
"While it is without a doubt richer than many macros, it is still very mediocre (if that, even). As a craft beer lover, I'm unimpressed, as a bock lover, I'm very dissapointed. Not recommended."
"This was a beer I tried before the concept of using a glass occured to me. Anyway, I found this to be a highly drinkable, enjoyable and readily available dark(er) than usual, beer. After being weaned on the usual ""drink to get buzzed"" beers, I found this one to be several levels above those in terms of drinkablility and taste. Although not (quite) in the same league as, say, Guinness, this is very much worth trying before you just pick up the same grocery store type beer you usually settle for."
"Drinkability: Sure its drinkable. It has just a little more character than your average macro, so thats a plus. I actually had this as one of the beers at my wedding, to satisfy the needs of the macro lovers. I think the color scared them a little, but in the end most people liked it. I think it was a baby-step in the right direction as far as helping their appreciation of beer mature and grow. So I like this beer for that reason. But they call this a bock beer? Thats just wrong."
"It is better than bud I guess. Something i drink when the monetary situation has seen better days. It pours a nice amber color with a small head. Nothing special but the hint of caramel is nice. Moderately watery mouthfeel but not too bad. Fairly drinkable too."
"I must add this comment a week later. After drinking some other watery macro's then drinking this beer the Taste was more noticeable. I also had this before a pizza at Pizza Hut. The second one tasted better while eating my pizza."
"Poured a relativly clear dark amber color with a bit of white head that soon vanished. It had a fairly sweet smell, with some hops detected. The taste was clean and showed some dark malt character. The mouthfeel is rather thin, and a bit too carbonated. But, for some reason, I can drink these all night long. Not too bad for such a crappy brewery."
"Poured a deep copper color with large white head that quickly vanished. I sure hope the taste is better than the smell. The first taste is of over sweetness and it doesn't get any better. Did some one forget to put any hops in this. Mouthfeel is poor. Why drink it??"
"Overall, not bad for an AB product, but this is certainly not a Bock. It might make a reasonable transition beer for friends that refuse to drink micros."
"Carbonation is at a good level, but the taste is grainy and just too sweet. Hops are hard to pick up here as well. Overall, a very light, low taste beer dominated by sweetness. Not too good."
"Paid $.99 a draft at a steak house tonight and in the past I have never minded Amber Bock. The same was true this time around. No good qualities for its appearance or smell, but nothing horrible. could not rate the drinkability at higher since, even at a dollar, I had no issue only grabbing one at dinner. will still beat BMC any day, but definitely not my choice over Yeungling or Sam Adams for standard restaurant fare."
"This beer poured out to a dark red / amber brown colour, with medium carbonation and a short lived white foamy head. Goes down smooth, yet a bit heavy. Flavors of rice and a touch of hops are present, as well as a bitterness that sits on the light side. Finish was a bit on the sweet side, but not over powering. Not a bad attempt by AB to get a grasp on the higher end of macro brews. Most appealing was the colour, and smoothness of this brew. Worth a try, but nothing to write home about."
"When I first poured this one, I thought it looked pretty tasty. Nice dark brown color to the brew, but once it ""hits your lips"" it loses its luster. How they can get away with calling this a bock beer is beyond me. Nice try AB, but I will not be partaking in this brew again anytime soon."
"Tasting: This beer is slightly heavier on the tongue. There is some carbonation and malt sweetness, but there is virtually no hop bitterness. It's difficult to characterize exactly what this tastes like. I'd say it has hints of an Irish Red Ale, but it is not as smooth or pleasant on the taste buds. While it is far from a bad beer, it is not great either. If I'm in the mood to go cheap, I'll drop a couple bucks on the drafts. It certainly beats some of this bar's other offerings..."
"$2 a pint makes them pretty drinkable for the evening session. Overall, nuttin to brag about, but not gonna run it down either."
"The beer has a nice colour to it, but otherwise the appearance is suspiciously flat. It is crystal clear, with very little head, and no lace to speak of. Smell is a slighly sweet malt and yeasty smell, with hints of dry wheat fields. The smell is very underpowering though. The taste is very little, if any. There is an overpowering metallic taste, which is heightened by the tons of sharp carbonation on the tongue. There are hints of malts and yeast, with almost no hops at all, but overall I had a hard time tasting much of anything. It's a small step up from macro swill, but I would not buy this if it was up to me."
"I think the beer is much better on-tap than in bottle. For a macro this is closer to having taste than most american marcos. Therefore I can attempt to write a review on it. It pours with nice head and nice lace (remember I had it on-tap with decent CO2 pressure compared to bottle). It doesn't have a typical Bock smell. It looks like a bock (color), but tastes a little watered down for that style. The hops are really masked. I can't seem to wonder how much adjuncts are included. I guess the general public never had a good Bock before. This is watery compared to the real thing. However, it is cheap in price compared to the real thing. There is a real sweet aftertaste that points to adjuncts. I wish they would have added more hops- German hops. But that would be too much to ask AB...."
"I remember liking this when I was younger and we thought we were really drinking bad ass beer, cause man this beer was dark. AB sure had us fooled. This is why they will probably never brew top notch beer. They can make it look good, but beyond that it is just plain weak."
"Overall Impression: Im starting to get the impression this whole line of 6 different Michelobs is like What would Michelob look like in a hat? What about a pair of mittens? Its what Michelob would taste like if it was a bock, or if it was a pale ale. Its still Michelob. Thats not a bad thing, but you really shouldnt try to be what youre not. This is not a bock."
"Pours a dark amber with a small off-white head that fades quickly and leaves no lace. Mild smell of sweet malts. Taste is quite sweet with very little evidence of hops. Slightly sour aftertaste. Thin, watery mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Very easy to drink. Another Michelob specialty beer that is probably a good choice when faced with a sea of macros, but that's probably the only time you'd want to choose it."
"Bock? No way. A better choice than regular Michelob? Yes."
"For what it's worth, this IS one of the better beers A-B makes; if this is your only non-""straw yellow"" option, take it. Also, if you live/travel in sparsely populated areas, Amber Bock may be the best beer available. Otherwise, skip it."
"wolf in a sheeps clothing this beer is. a wonderful color that is brought about by caramel food coloring. after the first sip, the whole experience goes downhill. i dont know how they can try to trick people into thinking that they are really drinking a bock beer. they should be ashamed"
"Overall, I can tolerate this beer. I won't quite call it above average but it isn't poor either. A baby step up from the 'typical' macro like Bud. Won't call it an authentic bock either but as it says on the right side here, styles are highly subjective. Don't be afraid to try one if it's the best one there."
"taste was of an American lager, slight sweetness, and malt, but fairly vague, and undistinguished, some hop balance, and subtle toffee flavor, better on tap! nice session brew, better than most lawnmower beers, not bad!"
"from the bottle.poured a amber with a light tan head. aroma sweet malts, corn barley, wheat sourness. flavor, malts, wheat , corn, hops, malts, none of them good, I guess if you didd not know any better you would think this is a good beer. the only thing I liked about this beer was the color."
"The only AB product I will drink. Average at best. Pours a dark amber color with little head retention. Much more malty than other AB products. The hops come through but this beer needs more than imported hops to save it. A decent, but unremarkable beer."
"Reflection: This is the best beer AB makes but the only time I buy it is when I'm out and have no other options."
"Not a great beer. Won't try it again."
"Nothing special, but a great alternative to Bud/Bud Light when limited in selection. Actually has some flavor, nice and smooth. Overall nothing wrong with it, but obviously not what I'd want to be drinking regularly. If there's nothing better to be had though, give it a chance."
"Lighter chestnut brown with a clearish amber glow, very little head or foam of any kind was present while served, nor was there any lacing. Aroma is light but pleasantly soft, crisp, and clean with a mix of cocoa, hazelnut and sweet red malts. Taste is more of the same, quick and light, not withstanding much staying power here. Whisps of hazelnut, quiply lightened roasty sweet malts just graze the surface of the buds. Its no beast in flavors but whats there serves as an average play of clean and crisp malt. Drinkable for sure; wets the whistle just fine but the body is thin with a slight sticky slick malt returning in the finish. Overall not a bad session beer to slip down while at a pub of lesser choices."
"It looks nice and dark. It has a bit more flavor, but the AB flavor overpowers it and its like drinking Bud with some food coloring."
"Not a bad offering from the folks at AB. Appearance is a dark amber color with short, off-white head. Smell is mildly sweet with just a touch of hops aroma. Taste is nicely balanced, maybe a little middle-of-the-road, but still very enjoyable. Malts are definently more prevalent than hops, however for some reason the other night I really noticed the Tettnang hop taste. Tonight, this seems much more malty. This is a nice session brew, one of the few from the big 3 that I feel I get my money's worth with."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a Born On Date of 13SEP04. It pours with an amber to brown color that is clear all the way through. In the glass it looks heavily carbonated, much like soda, and it proves to be true. The heavy carbonation in the mouth takes away from the tasting experience. The beer has an uneven head that settles to a lacy look. When I say uneven I mean large and small bubbles mixed together. Even after the head thinned there were some larger bubbles sitting on the surface surounded by small bubbles. The aroma is slightly malty with a sweet smell. The beer is watery in the mouth with some flavors of alcohol up front, a bit of dark maltiness and virtually no contribution of hops to the flavor."
"Overall: I'm a definite fan of this beer now, and I will definitely buy it again. The best macro beer thus far I've had, and one of the few I actually recommend."
"Beautiful deep brown color that appears almost red when held up to the light, has a thin white head that doesn't leave much lace. Sweet malty aroma, with underlying hints of toast, aroma reminds me of a sweet molasses. Flavor is all malt, caramelly sweet, with some yeast. There doesn't seem to be a enough body to carry that sweetness. This is a good transition beer for somebody looking to make the jump to better beer, for me its okay (I won't have to have a s*$t lite), I just wish a macro wasn't my 50th beer rated."
"The taste is much the same as the smell almost not there, taste very watery with some sweetness, Corn maybe? Not real good and only a slight bitterness to balance it. The mouthfeel is about the same as a glass of tapwater. The carbonation vanishes and there is nothing left but wettness. It is slightly more drinkable than some other Macro offerings, but still not good. I would swear that this beer has changed recipes since its release, at least it didn't always seem to be this bad. Like almost all Macro products, try like hell to skip it if you can."
"The beer after its removal from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a crystalline black walnut color with a smallish head that off white in color and frothy in texture, as it evaporates almost immediately the lace forms a microscopically thin film to almost coat the glass. Nose is malt, clean and fresh to the senses, start is lightly sweet and thinly malted with the top cadaverous. Finish is prickly in its acidity with the hops negligible, dry aftertaste."
"Amazing, it isn't bitter, looks great, smells perfect, & tastes even better. As smooth a beer as I've ever had. This was my first bock and I'll be heading to the store tonight to find some others, because this is one of the greatest brews I've ever seen."
"It's always fun to write a review like this due to the odd combination of criticism and praise that I am handing to the Anheiser Busch Nazis that have dessimated the American Beer tradition (but man, can they be trusted to employ in great numbers). The appearance is the quality of the beer. Reminded me of a Scotch ale, like McEwans but lighter in color. The taste is decieving at first. If you close your eyes to controll the influence of the appearance you'll discover that it doesn't deviate much from the other ""swill"" offered by A.B. Sure the malt adds a charm, but where is the scent, the rustic and hearty mouthfeel that I expected a beer that looked like this? An enthusiastic part of me wanted to give this one a higher rating but I have to be objective. By the way, a good question for A.B.: Why is it that Texas is offered ""Amber Ale"" as opposed to the ""Amber Lager"" sold in the other 49 states as stated on the label? This merely further undermines the dubious moniker ""Bock"" ascribed to this specimen. Still, this is the best offering from the American Macrobrew crucible, certainly the prettiest."
"The carbonation of this beer was ideal and if the beer tasted better would make this quite an easy beer to drink."
"It poured a nice healthy translucent brown with a fingers worth of off-white head. It's aroma was alcohol with a hint of malt. It had a lot of blandness in there from the rice, with just enough malt to raise the flavor a notch above typical A/B offerings. It was a medium bodied beer with a slightly oilieness to it. I'm sure that I wouldn't choose this over a Coors or a Yeungling, but given skunked Boddington, Bud, or Bud Light it worked."
"Poured a deep amber with a decent head, but it didn't last long. A bit of lace, but not much. Aroma is barely noticeable, some hints of malt with vanilla but very little. Taste is below average for what I expect a bock to be. Its alright for an everyday bock, but dont use it to impress any BA's. It does have some standard bock tastes, but not a ton, I guess I would consider it a ""lite bock"". Ithink AB has made a nice attempt to get into the micro movement and they might start to draw some away from their standard swill, but it's nothing to write home about - as bocks go anyway."
"Given the ""Bock"" moniker, I find this beer a yawn in every respect-- I'm in a good mood and I'll declare this beer a wimpy Bock, otherwise I could be mistaken and call it Michelob... If I had to chose between the dowel like aftertaste of Bud, or Mich Amber Bock, I'd take the Bock. But if there was a line up of ""real"" Bocks for the choosing.. this sleeping dog lies-- on the shelf."
"Hmm, I had to edit my review after having this a second time. I must have been skewed by a previous terrible beer the first time around. This amber bock is rather tasteless. It was a little refreshing, but if you're looking for a beer to drink, not an empty excuse for one, don't choose this."
"friends told me to try this beer and i did and i liked it. Pretty even thick and balanced taste, not overpowering, but not at all watered down. i'm sure this would be good on tap, i'll let you know when i get a chance to try it. but you should try one and suprise yourself, maybe michelob should break off anheiser, they actually know a little about a descent beer."
"Brew was actually a nice, brownish-amber color. AB MUST have used artificial coloring to get it there, because nothing in the smell, taste or any other part of the beer mirrored the appealing color. Smell was nearly non-existent, as was taste. Was I even drinking a beer? Mouthfeel was rather reminiscent of sweet tap water, which did make it easier to drink, at least. I suppose this is a step up for someone graduating from a light beer. Ordering it on tap while I was in St. Louis was an act of desperation and optimism. Caveat Emperor."
"The mouthfeel is very thin. Drinability is not great, I may take this over a regular Bud, but this beer is pretty weak. Definitely not a Huber Bock!"
"Drinkability - not an offensive beer, but better classified as a dunkel. My glass was empty before I was done penning the review, so if nothing else it's a no-look swiller."
"Easily the best thing A&B has ever done. As its name suggests, it poured a dark reddish brown about like tea with a sandy - beige head. Smell was just about like all the other macro-brew monsters, except it had a tiny bit of malt down in there as well. The taste, too, while extremely similar to abominations such as Bud, still clung to an inkling of intrigue with its slight caramel-like maltiness. Although this characteristic is noticeable only at the finish, it's present never the less, as is a wee bit of sweetness. There is also a ""salty-breadiness"" I was unable to place my finger on, but good none the less. The mouthfeel was slightly creamy, but had a bit more carbonation than I typically like. Overall however, not a bad choice. Hands down, easily what I'd pick if I HAD to choose a macro."
"I finally had this beer after its been out for a while. Before saying anything about my the beer, I obviously realize that alot of people are upset b/c this really isn't a bock. I like bocks myself and have to admit that this doesn't really live up to its name. I was very surprised by the actual appearance of this brew. The pitchers came to us and the color was very very dark and despite the fact that it is marketed a bock, I have heard so many bad things about this beer that it surprised me right off the bat. Although there was no real distinguishable smell to it, the taste of this beer wasn't bad at all. It gave a very smooth, sweet, and creamy flavor which I kinda liked, I'll admit it. I had about 3 of these in a sitting and to say the least, I will pick this over most macros anyday. Not a bad beer and I think more people should give it a try."
"Not a bad choice if you're stuck drinking domestic macrobrew."
"There was a time for me when this was one of the better choices when at a restaraunt. I found myself in that position last weekend, and it was between this on-tap or Heinekin in a bottle. I should have had iced-tea. This is an adjunct filled, overly syrupy tasting beer. Thin, weak, and totally uneventful. I had the Heinekin second, and that sucked just as much! Oh, how far I've come (at least I had good beer when I got home!)."
"I know what I like. This, my friends, I don't like. I don't think a bock should be super-filtered. It takes away from every aspect of the beer. I don't like to look into my beer and see everything on the other side of the bottle as clear as day. The taste was week in the malt department and nonexistant in the hop department. Rice was detected. This is not how a Bock should be. A-B should be ashamed."
"Though it's not really a bock over all, it is a decent brew, especially if your in a place with little selection. It can be found on tap at a lot of places and is better than a lot of other mass produced beer."
"As for the taste, it's quite thin, with some sweet malt flavors. An odd metallic aftertaste appeared every once in awhile. Goes down easy, but not much to it. A mass-produced ""dark"" beer, not a real bock in any sort of the word. My notes ended with ""Hmph," which seems rather appropriate."
"All and all a very drinkable beer. Also I should note that I live in a dry county and the closest place to buy beer has a very poor selection. Hell, poor may not define it, Heiniken is exotic in Jellico, TN. I think Amber-Bock will become my new daily swill."
"--Joey"
"I suppose it's good and different for a macro lager, but I was disappointed. This is no bock. The body does not match the color. I started drinking it thinking this would be something new, and when I finished, forgot I started. I will not be revisiting this beer any time soon."
"Was at the father in laws and this is his beer of choice, so this is what I had. Poured a dark cola type with little to no head, more of a fizzle. Left little lacing on the glass as you drank. Smell was of malt with a hop ending. Taste is of flat coke. Not what you want to have in a beer, granted I'm not a dark lager taste but even so, much better out there. Mouthfeel is light and dull, no pizazz. Drinkable if you are forced, but not quenching or filling. Like a big blockbuster that goes nowhere. Much better out there."
"This beer poured a dark brown/amber color with a small head that left quickly. That was a little odd considering it was on tap. The smell seems to be caramel and grains. Taste brings me a definite budweiser taste with a slightly darker grain. Rice is very noticeable. This for sure is no bock! Body is quite weak and can't help sustain any pertinent flavors. Finish is forgetful. Not the worst beer made but not quite average either."
"Replace the rice with twice the amount of Munich malt and maybe they'd have something here."
"It was a little bland with no hops infused flavors. A little sweet malt with a frothy head and a brown color. Not alot of taste tahts for sure. I bought a six pack of these for $3.50 at a Coast Guard Package Store and I was plesantly surprised at the price not the beer."
"One of the best offerings from A-B. If I could only choose one beer from A-B, this would be the one."
"Michelob Amber Bock reminds me of Killian's Irish Red. Not so much because of the smell, taste, etc. (though they do look similar), but because they're both so-called specialty macros that aren't very tasty, but are drinkable if nothing else is available. Pass."
"Pours into a Michelob glass(that came with the sampler box) a clear, copperish red/brown with a 6 second offwhite head. Lacing was patchy, but better than most Michs. As with most AB products, I can't really detect an aroma of anything, good or bad. Mouthfeel is carbonation, and that's it. Taste is light bodied, some grain apparent. A hint of caramel, and enough vague hop bitterness to balance it into one of those drinkable macros that lack any redeeming qualities, other than being something you would drink a few of, to quench your thirst. Much like drinking colored, carbonated, water, with enough alcohol to relax your bones, but not your soul, after a long day at work."
"Nice dark red brownish body with a small white fizzy looking head. Smell was a disappointment. Not too good. Lot of adjuncts. Slightly on the skunky side too. I did drink it at about 130 days after the brew date. Of course the born on label says best b4 110 days but cm'on, 110 days? I've bought produce that lasts longer than that. Not a real bock. Weak on taste and a thin and overcarbonated mouthfeel."
"This stuff was a brown/reddish colour with a small white fluffy head. The aromas were of adjuncts, malts, and slight, slight, hops. The taste followed suit...where are the hops? The mouthfeel was a bit thin and the drinkability was nothing to write home about."
"Light-medium feel, ""soapy", average drinkability. Not a bock by any means, but not horrible."
"This beer suprised me as I expected it to be much worse, it is a good drinking beer for someone on a budget. I would not go as far to put 'Bock' on the label however."
"This was a OK beer in terms of drinkablility of you like A-B products, but I've never liked that ""Bud"" taste. I don't think I'd get it again."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a lacey white head. The aroma is of lager malts with the addition of some caramel malts to add color and sweet flavor. The taste is not so good. It is weak, watery, and full of skunky flavor. The aroma is a real tease. It has a low/medium bodied with too much carbonation. This is one and done for me. This beer is way too over-hyped."
"This beer pours no head whatsover. Just sits there looking very dark, but still translucent. Tastes ok, almost like a bona fide dopplebock. Except for the aftertaste, which exposes this beer for what it really is, a mass produced attempt at craft beer. The aftertaste is full of metallic or watered-down flavors. It was worth a shot, but like most of the beers in this sampler, I can't recommend buying it."
"Amber Bock is a very dark (nearly black) brew with an off-white head that doesn't last. it's aroma and pallate are very simple. it smells a little like fresh wheat, and it's taste is only slightly more appealing. the brew starts shockingly smooth with almost no distinct flavor as it meets the tongue. a small mouthful usually begins with the taste of blackened toast. the beer's body is full with a heavy cereal note. other flavors include caramel and possibly a slight black pepper. finish is dry with a paste/cough syrup aftertaste. overall this beer will appeal to those who like a beer that goes down easy, and are willing to sacrifice flavor complexity to get it."
"Macro time. Medium brown/amber with a nice off-white head. Smell is, uh-oh, looks are deceiving! Not much to smell. SOME toasted malts, but with a sweet adjuncty edge. Tastes like it smells. Toasted bread maltiness, but not enough to cover the cereal grain taste."
"Poured a dark copper-brown with a white head that disappeared pretty quickly. Lace stuck around for a bit longer, but it too eventually succumbed. The smell has a bit of caramel malt to it, and just a slight hint of hop spiciness. The taste has the same slight hint of caramel malts and some noble hop flavors that are never consistent in their effect - sometimes at the beginning, sometimes in the middle, never at the end. The mouthfeel isn't fantastic, and feels a bit thin, but this brew is certainly passable for a night out at the pizza joint."
"wow, this is the beer of memories. $2 for 24 oz. at the Sports Cafe in state college. let's see, there is the lace that evreeyone likes. has a nice white head, w/ some amber color. I like the mouth feel ,but this is not a ""bock's bock", but it is still enjoyable Is there rice, yes. Is it still drinkab le, yes. It has the amble hues, it has the taste to keep going. Is it great - NO. Is it something that you can go all night on if you have too?YES"
"But it might have gone better had the bottle I had at Bennigan's not been served in their usual frosty glasses. How a place with over 20 beer taps care so little about beer stumps me. For the $5 they charged, I could have a fine imperial at any brewpub."
"Dark Amber color. Small head. Aroma is malty, sweet and honeyish. A light bodied “Bock”. Malts are fairly mild, slightly nutty and sweet. Hops are virtually non-existent. No real beer like qualities, tastes more like an under-carbonated coke. Not much flavor. Kind of watery. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is sweet."
"Pours an amber brown tone with a short lived head and a scattered light lacing, just seems so artificial and unatural in appearance....engineered if you will. Aroma is sweet with lightly toasted malts and a touch of caramel in there, undetectable hops for me at least. Unoffensive in taste, not bad decent amount of sweetness not adjunct ridden but still containing corn and rice, and not a bad hop profile light hop bitterness but overall doesn't do the trick. Overall a drinkable A-B brew just light and fizzy texture this is the most tolerable beer made by A-B, I just wish that fans of it would realize it's not the best."
"This is a very refreshing brew. I had it on tap tonight at the Toledo Mud Hens game. It is a good alternative to the Bud Light and Michelob Light they serve there. It has a nice sweet malty flavor to it. Even as it warms is tastes fairly good. I enjoy this beer a lot. Definitely Michelobs top beer. Very good on tap. Not much different than the bottle."
"Comments  No, its not a bock. But, its drinkable."
"Well it is amber, in fact it is approaching a brown. Thin head that quickly disappears. Fairly low in carbonation. Smells lightly malty sweet. A fairly good body on this beer, which I was expecting to be about as thin as an American Standard lager, though it by no means come close to the type of body that a bock should have. Lightly sweet beer, with just a bit of bitterness to balance the caramel. Very clean tasting all around, not much good or bad flavors going on. Just not very exciting."
"Great price. Although this is a mass-production beer, it actually has some intersting properties and it is fairly tasty. Pours a dark amber color with a small white head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little nutty and malty, but not strong. The taste is very smooth and the malts are detectable in the flavor - surprisingly. This is one of the best Michelob products I know of."
"Which went in badly, and left an aftertaste not unlike medical waste products. I don't hesitate to label this one of my all time most hated beers. Avoid it like the plague."
"I have no idea was I was expecting. On one hand I thought an amber bock beer would be a great combination but then again it is Michelob. So why not... what a disappointment. At first as the the beer poured into my pint glass I tought this is rather odd. The beer poured to a almost black body with a tannish head almost like a stout. It did have good color but after that it went down hill. Not much flavor at all. There were few hints of malt and hops but nothing to stand out. I thought the mouthfeel was extremely thin for this style of beer."
"This was my only choice other than Bud/Bud Light/Mic Ultra at a minor league game tonight. It poured a medium tan color and formed a foam light tan head that left no lace of course to speak of. The aroma very lightly of malt. The flavor was of malt and a sweetness I couldn't place. Much lighter than a bock should be and shared none of the traits you usually find in a bock beer."
"This seems like standard A-B fare to me with a bit of additional coloration. The taste is standard Bud with a little more body and perhaps a somewhat greater sense of quality in the aroma and appearance. I just can't escape that standard taste in every A-B product I sample. BTB, barely."
"I chose a pseudo-craft beer as my 100th review. One of our duties as reviewers is to warn the unsuspecting, so here goes. I sampled this horrible brew at The Tiki Bar, an outdoor grill on the beach on Marco Island. Michelob was test-marketing Amber Bock in several states and it was my misfortune for having vacationed in Florida at this time. It was a sunny and balmy afternoon. Bikini clad beauties were bouncing around, showing off what they had developed over the winter (quite a distraction from my relaxed reading and quite the chore of appearing disinterested with my girlfriend's harsh glare beating down upon the back of my neck). The smell of grilled shrimp and burgers wafted over me, exciting my remaining senses. I wandered over to the Tiki and noticed, with curious interest, Michelob Amber Bock on tap. Hmmm! How bad could it be? Well, despite my most excellent surroundings and laissez-faire attitude, the answer, to be kind is disgusting! Flat dark tan in color and rapidly vanishing off-white head. Sweet sugary malt and soaked corncob aroma. The pasty-mealy malt is difficult to swallow. This bland, sweet tasting, lightly hopped beer is in keeping with the A-B tradition of marketing over quality brewing techniques. Again A-B had the opportunity to enter the craft brew market by brewing a really fine bock beer. They chose instead, the road of mass-produced-type swill and major advertising campaigns. Argh! In case youre still interested, the rest of my vacation went very well despite A-Bs attempt to ruin it."
"Pours with a nice amber color. Off to a good start for a A-B product. A bit of a head was present then faded to nothing. The aroma is a bit on the sweet side. There is a present of roasted malts. Taste was a bit on the malt side. Nothing overpowering. The mouthfeel was extremely thin and there was hardly any taste. Not to bad but nothing to rave about"
"Nice looking label and packaging. Pours weak with little head. Taste is a little malty, a little like chocolate. You do get a hint of the touted ""imported hops"". Distinct grainy, chemical aftertaste. Finish burns going down. Overall, not a very smooth brew for an amber/bock."
"Not a bad beer to have when your choice is limited. Just try to avoid those situations whenever possible..."
"Not that bad for an A-B product."
"There was a time I probably would have given this a higher rating, but I have since been introduced to better beers. Still this beer is excellent for transitioning a typical american drinker to better beers."
"I used to drink this quite often, now I wouldn't bother, it's neither a bock or an amber more like a dark regular lager and a very pedestrian one at that."
"This is one of my fav's when it comes to mass produced beers from North America. The apperance was my favorite part of it. The color was a black color towards the top of the glass and then got lighter color as it descended. There was no head, but laced the top with a light film. The taste starts out a little bitter, but smooths out quickly. There was also some hints of fruits in it. Not a bad brew overall."
"Tried this on tap at Red Lobster. It was a bad decision. I should have known. It was a very clear brown color, with very little head. There wasn't much aroma maybe some toasted malts with a little sweetness. The taste seemed watered down, could've been the glass but I doubt it. It seemed to taste a lot like bud only sweeter. The mouthfeel was extremely thin and there was hardly any taste. That's what I get for going with AB. Still I would choose it over bud when it's my only other choice."
"It pours a clear, brown body with a dull orange cast and ruby highlights. The short but creamy off-white head drops readily but keeps a creamy collar and whispy surface covering. It laces nicely as you drink, but all that sticks to the glass is some spotty lace. Still, the appearance is quite enjoyable. The nose expresses a mildly sweet and lightly toasty malt with some mild floral and spicy hops deep in the background. The body is light/medium with a very fine carbonation that gently caresses the tongue. The flavor is delicately balanced between a lightly sweet, gently toasty malt and a restrained bitterness. It finishes clean and dry with a light touch of residual toasted maltiness. Very nicely done! Exceptionally clean, well-balanced, and quite drinkable with enough character to keep it interesting for those who've moved beyond American lagers. Well worth trying."
"Pours a light brown color with caramel highlights that is crystal clear. Off-white head has large bubbles and fades quickly. The aroma is malt and caramel, showing a touch of sweetness. Caramel is very prevalent on the taste, with a touch of malt and hops for balance. Minimal sweetness, but very smooth. This is the best macro offering I've had. Nothing exceptional in the flavor, but definitely not offensive by any means. The mouthfeel is rather thin, especially for something termed a bock beer. Carbonation is a touch agressive, leading to a harsh mouthfeel as well. Drinkability is good year round. A solid beer for $16/case here in PA."
"This offering is a great example of a beer brewed not to offend anyone, but giving the appearance that it is a micro hand-crafted beer. It pours an amber brown with a foamy white head that sticks around only for a bit. At first the aroma actually has malty notes typical of a lesser mai-bock, along with some hop spiciness thrown in. The taste, however, is bland and watered down with the ""green apple"" Bud flavor very noticeable. The mouthfeel is also too weak for the style. I am not sure what the target consumer is for this beer, but it clearly is ""too dark"" for the Bud Light crowd and too bland for anyone that appreciates micros...."
"I sample Michelob Amber Bock from a 12 oz amber bottle. It poured to give an ""amber"" beer with some white foam. The color looked a little odd to me: it was not a true amber color, but was slightly brown. There was an aroma of sweetness and malt, but it did not smell like a bock. The taste was thin, but was sweet with very little hops. The mouthfeel was of carbonation, and the beer seemed thin. The drinkability is OK for this type, but again, this is not really a bock beer."
"I hope people don't take this beer to be any different than another macro big beer. Not a good amber beer, not a good bock. Good macro session beer at best."
"This beats most of the regular lagers out there but would rate as one of the worst bock beers although I'm not sure if it is a real bock...A good introductory dark beer for macro drinkers...."
"A total re-review of what was once considered a decent beverage. A medium red in color, strong skunky masky odor of corn and veggies. The initial taste is of watered down malts, with just a touch of faint hops left in the background. Easy going down, but overall a bad taste."
"Personal notes: Better than average pick when there are no micros. I noted that they use rice, which probably lightened the body of this, unfortunately. No corn, thank goodness. I would buy this if I was looking for a reasonably priced macro (for whatever reason)."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"This is an average beer nothing to complexes nothing to simple. This beer has a firm smallish head which sticks around for a while, that has some malt character to it. the aroma is nothing to be impressed with. It also has a nice body a little thin but what do you expect from AB. Good color nice amber hue could be a little darker. Nice smooth taste not very heavy on the malt flavor light hops, a little creamy and a little Smokey. Nice bold aftertaste a little dry but refreshing. A good showing from AB but a little hard to find, and if you have to hunt it down it's not worth it!"
"Fight the good fight Shiner!"
"This brew is not amber, has gone well beyond that...I did like this dark lager even though this type of brew is basically foreign to me. After I got by the appearance, the taste I found to be very mellow and well balanced...I thank BA for perking my interest to trying all these new brews."
"Murky brown color. A little deeper than clear. Thin, off-white to tan head. Some beer like malt smells matched with toasted corn. Taste is midly maltly, although hard to distinguish which are used. Thin feeling and somewhat watery finish.Semi-sweet finish, lingers but doesn't disrupt the taste buds. I drank it fast anticipating a hard to handle slick funky AB finish. But it was not that bad. Actually I found it better than I had anticipated. Is neither an amber or a bock though, just a catchy name for a dark lager. I'm not sure that it's not artificially colored too. Still better than ordering some things on tap in Florida."
"Certainly not a German bock, but a pretty exotic brew from AB. I held off for a long time to try this, and finally broke down and broke a sixer for one. It was worth my effort. How about yours?"
"Pours to a medium-brown colow with an off-white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is one of light malt; no hop aroma was detected. The taste is light roast malt, with a slight hop flavor. The mouthfeel is light-bodied, smooth, and carbonic. Overall this beer is light in every aspect, which makes it easy to drink. It however is sad that they try to market it as a Bock. Should not be associated with a Bock. It would be very misleading to a novice beer drinker looking to try a real Bock beer."
"Pours a clear dark caramel color with absolutely no head (?). The smell contains maybe a hint of light malt with a skunk being dominant. Fortunately doesn't taste as bad as it smells. Quite bland with faint notes of earthy grain and lightly hopped (almost none) and plenty of carb bite. Very plain for such a fancy label. Very light bodied and finishes very crisp and clean. Fairly drinkable if you don't smell first. AB is so scared they are going to put flavor in something. When I get through this fancy variety pack of bland beer...no more AB for me! Cheers!"
"the last of my sampler pack was pretty unimpressive. the body is lacking it is thin and short on flavor. there are some malts hanging around, but not too much to it. something to make a macro drinker feel fancy."
"As far as this being a mass produced beer it wasn't a bad attempt.  Atleast they are trying.  The color was really the only thing good about this beer. Dark, ruby, molassas in color.  The head and lace were almost non-existent.  The smell was slightly floral and malty.   But really non-existent.  The flavor had a malt, slight caramel,molassas, floral, carbonation taste to it.  I asked a buddy to try a sip and he is a Coor;s man and said that it wasn't bad for Michelob.  I agree, not bad for Michelob."
"Medium amber, weak head and lace. Lighter than I think it should be. Slightly syruppy sweet and spritzy. Husky corn like finish. Totally lacking in body.  Obviously mean to give lawnmower beer drinkers the impression they are drinkingn something sophisticated.  Goes down smooth."
"However, it is easily AB's best attempt."
"My verdict? A good AB product. I find it amusing that this is supposed to be a specialty brew, and the label explicity says that it is brewed with rice.  Try making an all malt brew next time, AB."
"My first Michelob, I expected more I think. It pours dark brown with a good fluffy high-carbon tan head. A bit week on lace. I found the body of the beer week as well.Its a drinkable beer for its very smooth, sweet malty taste over little hop.After-feel of mouth is dry but waterlike in finish."
"As others have said, it is an above average beer and should be tried before discounting it because it is made by AB.  Dark amber in color with moderate carbonation and head.  Slightly alcohol aroma which I deducted points for, but the flavor had a tinge of malt which I enjoyed.  It could use more though for the bock name.  Can usually be found fairly cheap which makes it all the more drinkable."
"Somewhat thinner than it could be, but this is a very drinkable beer.  My friends like to criticize on this beer, but I think its a decent, well made brew.  A touch more maltiness would help, but I've found it solidly enjoyable"
"Nothing all that special, but I believe this to be an above average beer. I had it on draught, which is probably why I think that. Nice dark color with little head. Some bitterness in the flavor...but I was just appreciative that there was flavor."
"Unbelievably white-bread. It is difficult to even find anything to comment on. I am not an expert on Bocks but hopefully this is not the norm. Too plain for anyone but regular Michelob drinkers who feel like they are taking a risk."
"I have to admit, I was impressed with this one.  Even though it comes from Anheiser Busch, this is well balanced, with a little malty feel to it.  A nice aroma and a do-able head that laces towards the bottom of the glass.  Prost!"
"Nice and dark, tan head that. Slightly roasted on the nose with some fruit. Thinner then I expected. Not ovelry carbonated (which is refreshing). One of the better beers out of A-B."
"What's this? An AB product that actually has some taste? I'll be damned. Dark amber/brown, lots of bubbles, dissipating white head. Not much aroma at all. Taste is not unpleasant, with a sweet, malty, caramel flavor. A bit too much carbonation, leads to bloating. Overall, however, not as bad as you might otherwise expect from these guys."
"It's easy to drink but not worth the premium price. It has that classic Anheuser-Busch blandness and mediocrity, attributable to the neutral ""house yeast"" they use, no doubt. Nothing strips the soul from malted barley as completely as A-B house lager yeast and a tight series of filters. There is such a small hint of roasted malt character, that if you are not concentrating, you may miss. So if you are eating spicy food, engaged in stimulating conversation or otherwise distracted, you will miss the shadow of the character remaining in this beer and you might as well be drinking regular Michelob."
"Clear dark brown color.  Big-bubbled ""adjunct"" head, foams down in short order.  Sharp, acidic odor, much like most lighter colored macro lagers.  Just the slightest hint of roasted malt flavor (touch of anise and sweetness), but very soon, attenuated by a crisp but non-descript hop and adjunct flavor.  Very little body or mouthfeel.  Aftertaste is nuetral rather than smacking of bitter-crisp carbonated water flavor.  Nothing to recommend it but the color.  At about a buck or so less a sixer than a standard micro, not even a good value."
"Light brown in color, typically clear from the lagering, filtering, fining... whatever.  The head settles very quickly into a thin and unappetizing layer.  The aroma is very mild-- a slight caramel sweetness becomes present only as the beer warms. Bland but clean in flavor. An unexpected light Munich malt toasted flavor becomes noticeable after the prickly, overly effervsecent mouthfeel subsides. Corn sweetness is thankfully minimal.  There is no hop flavor whatsoever, but hop bitterness is definitely above the norm for an American macrobrew.  Finishes very dry and neutral.  (This is about as much a Bock as Shiner Bock is) Well, there aren't any flaws in this brew-- it's weak but super clean all around in profile, and I'll take it over any other American Dark Lager anyday. There's actually more than caramal coloring added to this one. Won't ever order it again, however."
"Not to shabby for A-B. A bock though...I don't think so. Pours a nice clear amber color. Very refreshing brew, easy to drink, with a nice clean taste. Not bad at all...I would say the best from A-B that I have had so far."
"Any so called premium that sports a label trumpeting the fact they use rice in the beer should be taken behind the shed and shot. It looks like a rich dark beer, but its an illusion.  Its a pale imitation of a dark beer with that grainy Bud aftertaste.  Pass on it."
"A chemical type tastes that just did'nt seem right began making themselves known and that was the end of my Amber bock days."
"I like this beer. Its a bit thin, but it has a nice, somewhat sweet, malty taste to it. More of a dark lager than a bock. I know its customary to pile on the big brewers, but in this case, I think A-B has done a nice job. This may very well be A-B's best offering."
"I had the same impression that the other guys had that this is definitely not an all malt beer.  Not a beer to taste by itself, needs pretzels,  popcorn, salted cashews or something."
"Had this stuff in Tampa (go figure). Started out a session with it at an outdoor downtown happy hour festival. It was the lesser of the evil swill. Tasted like runnings from overboiled mixed vegetables. It served its purpose I suppose. Other than that this is typical of what AB thinks a ""specialty"" brew is."
"Ugh..  Crystal clear dark brown amber.  Has a standard 'dirty' alchoholic scent, like Rice Crispies or Cherios.  Reminds me a lot of regular Michalob or Coors.  A slight roasted malt flavor.  Clean finish.  No character, absolutely no complexity.  Made with the finest Barley, Hops, Water, Yeast, and Rice!  Wow, I've got rice grandeur in my beer!"
"It kind of looks like a beer and it kind of smells like a beer, but it tastes like Michelob with caramel coloring added.  I guess that is what makes it go down so smooth <sarcasm>"
"I had this at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay...Slightly bitter and as the name implies amber in color...Not bad for A-B...certainly better than the king of beers or anything else I've tried from them...nice to know that A-B is trying to improve its products but much more is needed"
"No discernable hops, other than a vague bitterness.  Finish was a raw, grain character.  Primary flavoring agent seemed to be alcohol.  Run Will Robinson, Run!"
