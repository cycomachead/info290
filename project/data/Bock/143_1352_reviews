"The lightest Bock I ever had...but I enjoyed it"
""
"A suitable bock, nothing special"
""
""
"The way beer should be. You guys can keep your overrated fancy beers, just keep ""The Bock"" flowing for me.  Shiner Bock is basically Texas personified into a beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good Beer. If you haven't tried it yet then do so.."
""
"This is a really tasty beer."
""
"Great beer, the best to me."
""

"12oz. bottle poured in a pint glass. A rather light Bock beer with a dark amber translucent body and small-medium head. Smells of a  balance of malts and grain with a hint of hops and alcohol. Taste mostly to the sweet malts side tending afterward to a slightly bitter bite of hops. Mouthfeel is mostly smooth, clean and refreshing, with medium crispness and carbonation. Overall a drinkable brew for an everyday beer but nothing special."
""
"Shiner has always been one of my favorites."
""
"Decent beer. Better than your bud lights and keystone. But nothing great"
"This is not a bock. It's more of a flavored water. It reminds me of a waterd down abbey.  No flavors stick out and what flavor there is, is stale and weak.  If you like something like this then enjoy. If you're a bock fan, skip this"
""
""
"12 oz. bottle drank as part of a BJCP tasting group (Category 5: Bock) on 01/14/2015, poured into a snifter glass and drank over 15-30 minutes"
""
""
""
""
"Really nice chocolate flavor.not ooverpowering. Very good beer."
""
""
""
"Excellent BBQ beer with a great feel. Don't think I would drink it any other time, though."
""
""
""
"Nice !!! Good all around bock."
"VERY understated. Almost watery. It would be exceptional with sushi or spicy food, to clear the palate. I don't prefer it for sipping on its own."
"Mediocre beer. Pouring it into a glass and letting it sit for a little bit improves on the flavor and smell but not by enough to where I'd call it good stuff. Spend your money elsewhere."
""
"This one didn't do it for me. Flat flavor. Slight sour taste. Stale finish. A little pepper on there tongue"
""
""
""
"Auburn pour with thin white head. Not much aroma. Semi sweet malt body. Lite mouthfeel.  Overall, a lite easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On a hot Texas nothing is finer than a cold Shiner......"
""
"Texas Yuengling.. But not as good.. Very bland and flat.. Just a slighty flavorful Amber lager."
"Fairly middle of the road, no off flavors, not too watery, but nothing spectacular either."
""
""
""
"While I prefer heavier ales, if I'm going to have a bock, this is the one."
""
"Not bad. Not great.. Very light and watery I do like most beer from shiner"
"I generally have liked the Shiner beers, they are all decent for each style. Bock is no different. I liked it but I am not the best critic of of this style. I can see how some rate this really low and some like it a lot. Flavors are good but not strong. It's worth a try and you will probably get more if you like this style."
"Tastes like it should and pretty solid at that."
""
""
"horrible is the first word that comes to mind."
"2/7 - (Home) Bottle. I liked the taste and feel of this beer. Liked the hops and this beer had some kick, and was pleasant."
"dark gold-brown color, crystal clear with a decent head that disappates quickly. Minimal lacing. Aroma is full of bread and malt. Flavor is malt forward, obviously, with very light hop, as this style should. Mouthfeel is good, cool with great balanced carbonation.."
"Ok overall, but nothing exciting"
""
""
"12 oz. bottle from Cost Plus. Clear dark brown color with a head that thins out quick. Mild malt aroma. Taste is of sweet, bready malt up front with a crisp lager taste in the middle leaving a lingering sweetness after its gone. Not much in the way of hop bitterness or explosive flavor, but it’s not supposed to. I found this to be an excellent, drinkable basic lager beer. Love the 4.4% ABV."
""
""
"Very average beer at best"
""
"Overall:  This beer is not world class, excellent, or even great, it’s just a damn solid, damn good beer, and I love it!  It’s one of my favorite session beers, and a bottle or two are always in my fridge."
"some toasted grain, and a little caramel and toffee on the nose, then the taste follows.  nothing too exciting or subtle, but it drinks okay, and in the midst of a winter move, it's refreshing and tasty enough."
"A good solid beer. Nothing fancy but I try to keep a few stocked up in the beer fridge"
""
""
"This beer will fool you. It has a nice looking amber color. From a distance, very appealing. Just no flavor."
""
"One of my favorites. Good solid non-macro beer."
""
"Pours light brown with large-bubbled head which disappears completely.  Aroma is malty, bready and pleasant. No bad flavors; more malt, caramel and bread. Very light, not complex, but really not bad. I could drink this all night and not complain."
"O - decent bock, but nothing great. It's not as good as some proclaim; maybe not as bad as some might say. I haven't had this in at least 4 years & I'd be fine waiting that long again."
""
""
"You can't be from Austin and not allow for Shiner."
"Pours a clear brown producing 1+ finger of foamy, khaki, short-lived head that leaves only little streaks & motes of lace. Aroma is weak & thin being toasted & biscuit malt with caramel &  hints of roasted nuts, toffee, floral hops & very faint vanilla. Taste is slightly more robust being of toasty dark malts, caramel, biscuit, roasted nuts, earthy & floral hops that provide a slightly lopsided balance. Peppery spice & more caramel in the finish. Roast & a little bitterness in the dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is low side of medium body with moderate carbonation, smooth with a slight prickle, juicy & wet with a dry aftertaste. The most redeeming quality of this brew is its drinkability. What it lacks in aroma and flavor it somewhat makes up for by going down easy."
"Overall - reminded me of Miller High Life minus the heavy carbonation honestly. I'd rather have an Old Milwaukee,  PBR, etc."
"Pours a deep clear brown (thinking mahogany) but with almost no head by the time I get it at the table. Not even a hint. The aroma is barely there, with nothing distinct. The taste is a little better, with a caramel malt flavor. But it's not very robust. The body does has have a decent weight and feel to it but it lacks carbonation. Not sure what all the raves for this beer in Texas are about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks good, pours fair, smells fair and tastes watered down with little to no carbonation.  Not something I would seek out."
"A great example of what a BOCK is supposed to look and taste like. It is a dark Amber color. The smell is full and the taste is outstanding just the right amount of caramel left to linger.*****"
""
"Hits you like a ton of bliss"
"V - Medium value, it's certainly not the cheapest beer, but it's not ridiculous either, right in the middle."
""
"Beer has very little character. Little caramel in the after taste,  but Not altogether pleasing."
"Shiner Bock has been and likely will remain my favorite beer for most activities. It's strong yet slightly sweet an very drinkable nature make it the perfect companion for most outdoor activities, but it feels most at home paired with tailgating and a good ribeye. The Spoetzl Brewery's most famous offering is the best example of an American-style bock; it doesn't have the strength of its German counterparts but is a very easy beer to drink and enjoy throughout the day. Overall, it's hard to knock Shiner Bock."
""
"Can't believe that this cold be a flagship beer for a sizable brewer.  This stinks.  Typically I will fight through a bad beer to give it s chance but it never improved.  Drain pour."
""
"Very good. One of my go to beers."
"O – Shiner Bock was (I believe) the first beer I had that wasn’t mass-produced American lager, so it holds a special place in my heart.  It is very basic, but not at all a bad beer.  It’s been “dumbed down” a bit from a traditional bock, and is a bit thin, but still a solid brew."

""
""
""
""
"Don't understand the hype around this beer. Yuengling blows Shiner out of the water as far as overhyped beers go."
""
"Tasted cheap and not delicious :)"
"Not sure why the folks in Texas like this so much..."
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice, simple, approachable beer. It hasn't got much in the way of hop bitterness or explosive flavor, but it's crisp and enjoyable. I paired it with latkes and matzah ball soup on the first night of Hanukkah. Nothing wrong with it at all."
"Solid beer on the less expensive side of things. The Yuengling for people in Pennsylvania who are too cool to drink Yuengling."

"The best thing I can say about this one is that it has a nice malt aroma with a hint of caramel. The color is not bad either; a solid dark brown. However, the taste is not so flavorful. It's a pretty watery and light tasting beer with a slightly creamy finish towards the end of the drink. Not a terrible beer and certainly not the worst I've ever had. I would not rule this one out forever, however, will not actively seek it out."

"Overall, a good beer for the price.  I paid $8 for the six pack and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.  I will not hesitate to pick this up again."
"Overall: Well, it's a very tepid bock, with very little to make it shine, no pun intended.  I was underwhelmed.  I won't be getting it again.  Sorry, Texas.  This one just doesn't cut it."

""
""
"Shiner is a Texas standard, not the best and not the worst.  It is nice that it is in the northeast now so I can have a part of home when I want."
""
""
"A very sessionable beer, mild flavor and aroma.   Body is very attractive with the sun shining through but the lack of lacing is detrimental."
""
""
""
""
"Overall; As stated earlier, not much excitement drinking this beer. One of, if not THE, most mediocre bock beer I've ever had. Bland, light bodied and boring. You won't be missing much by passing on this beer, trust me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is probably the worst beer I've ever had from the liquor store. It's a lot like drinking brown water with a little bit of alcohol in it. There's no taste whatsoever. I will never buy beer from Shiner again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"not craft beer in any way shape or form"
""
"A decent enough beer though it comes across rather weak in all areas for a bock beer. It's especially odd to have such a relatively low ABV for a bock styled beer. This would make a pretty respectable amber lager or Vienna lager, but lacks the oomph and appeal of a classic bock beer. It's roasted grain and nutty flavors are a plus and makes the beer enjoyable enough for what it offers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark copper with not much of a head to speak of, and predictably no lacing left along the glass.  Smell is malty, sweet, and slightly grainy/astringent.  Taste is also malty.  Nothing to write home about, but it does have a toasted lager feel to it.  A step up from a traditional, basic american lager, but I can't see myself reaching for more than two of these in a session -- just not much noteworthy about it."
""
""
"it's a slightly above average. It's pretty watery, but it's got a tad more flavor than an American lager."

"I like it. Won't win any awards but it's good as is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite mass produced Bock beers. Smooth taste without being too bitter. If you like Bock beers and you can't find your micro brew of choice, this one will do just fine."

"Mouthfeel: Very crisp light/medium to medium bodied beer with a medium high carbonation level. The finish is very sweet and mouthwatering leaving me wanting more."
""
"Not a bad bock, like an old friend it's always there. At least in Texas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Far from the robustness of a true bock. More of an amber lager; light and drinkable with a bit of malt character."
""
""
""
"A nice bock, I think there a better bocks  out the for the money."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good beer.  A lager with more character than most, but still very smooth and drinkable.  Not cheap but not expensive either.  Middle of the road in terms of price and quality.  An easy drinking beer, with some character, that is better than many others."
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer a lot. It has a darkish red-brown color to it, but it drinks very smooth and lighter than it looks. Not much aftertaste. Good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Middle of the road bock.  Easy drinking and light.  But too light and easy drinking for me."

"I had this beer while I lived in Texas.  A local favourite.  Not a whole lot going on here.  This may have been considered a tasty beer pre-microbrew era, but nowadays it is only slightly more interesting than the big name lagers.  Good if you wanna consume en masse at a party."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If I found a relatively cheap case of Shiner Bock I would not be opposed to drinking a plethora of them in one sitting (hence the drinkability). But for the beer nerds and connoisseurs out there I would not seek out this beer over some of the other options. Worth trying, but nothing spectacular."
""
""
"Great beer"
""
"The taste tends to bring out the malty sweet notes more than anything with only the slightest bitter finish. It tastes like something from the 1960's."

"Overall: Judging this beer as a bock will give it very low scores, but this beer is a great lager for warm days, tailgates, and hanging with friends. Its easy drinking and quite enjoyable. If this is priced the same as macro beers than this is great, but I really don't like Shiner trying to market itself for more than what it really is. I always pass it up if its more than $8-9/six pack or more than $13/12pack."

"Overall (3.5) - Yeah, I'd buy it again. It's not bad. I always pour my beer into glasses now anyways, and this one tastes much better poured. A decent beer - although not really an appropriate representation of a traditional Bock. Still good, a great lager to have. Try it!"
""
""
"O: Quite a bit darker and more hefty than I thought. The hops and the carbonation really have to fight to keep it from becoming cloying and syrupy. A decent beer at best. At its price point I don't think it will compete well here in MA. Interesting decision to enter such a saturated market, especially riding right on the coattails of Yuengling."

"Texans cannot brew beer yuck, yet they act like Shiner is gods gift to the earth. The beer is obviously dyed. Shiner beer doesn't stack up to even your most common domestic beer. Save yourself the trouble don't buy shiner, unless you like beer that tastes like syrup mixed with stale bud light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: the love for this beer in texas explains a lot about the state, get into an argument with a texan and they'll tell you how much better than bud it is, like that's an achievement that nobody else has reached and can't be topped. But hey, maybe in texas being slightly better than the worst macro swill american lager is something to be proud of."
""
""
""
"O: I know people talk down on beers like this, but it's a pretty good mellow brew. It's got way more flavor and body than your run of the mill macrobrew. It's like a microbrew version of a light beer. It's got a great finish and is a great refreshing beer."

"If you live in Texas, you know Shiner. You know that there are worse things to find in a fridge at a party or any type of gathering. If you want something solid, Shiner Bock will not disappoint. It may not be the most spectacular beer on the planet, or even something you should drive to Texas specifically to find. But if you walk into a party, and the fridge/cooler is stocked with Miller, Bud, Coors, and Shiner, reach for the Shiner every single time and you will not be upset about your choice."
""
""
"This is the beer featured in country songs. Smoothest amber bock beer you can get under $10 a sixxer. Poors a good amber color with a nice foamy head. Mouthfeel is great and smells of hops and grains. Tastes like Texas. You show up at a party drinking this stuff and your guaranteed to get laid. This stuff is great. Shiner premium is also good to try. Anything shiner is good minus the farmhouse ale. Don't drink that crap. Shiner is guaranteed to make you a badass, get you laid, and put hair on your chest."
""
"Aroma of caramel,malt. Pours amber brown body with quickly dissapating white head. Head reduced to thin non lacing film. Taste is rather bland and bready. Leaves an odd, alkaline aftertaste, but not unpleasant.really, nothing like I expected."

"This beer is a dark beer. But it is not too dark it go`s down smooth. It has a some what heavy taste but not too heavy. If you like dark beer this is a good beer to buy. The smell is really good as well. The smell is not too strong or too weak. This beer is a good beer for just sitting back and relaxing around the house. It is also a good beer for out at a bar with friends, or at dinner. I would recomend it to anyone who likes dark beer, or to someone who likes to try new beers. It is one of my favorite beers and I know that I will have this beer again with no problem. So I would recommend that anyone who likes dark beer shpuld go out and have a Shiner Bock. I do not believe that you could go wrong with this beer."
""
""
"Pours a dark amber in color with about a 1/2-finger off white head that leaves some spotty lacing as well. The aroma is a faint sweetness with malt. Carbonation is a bit under average. Taste is of a light sweet caramel malts unlike many other bocks. Goes down pretty easy with no harsh or bitter aftertaste. Actually wasn't that bad and would have one again."

"Welcome to CT. On tap at 2 Bros. Pours a translucent reddish copper color with a half inch of head. Zero lacing. The aroma is malty and bready with some light caramel notes. Maybe a hint of citrus. The taste is more of the bready malts with some caramel and light orange peel. Malty finish with some light nuttiness. Very light mouthfeel for the style. Thin. This is a decent easy drinking Bock but it is certainly not going to replace 'Gansett Bock as my go-to in that category. Overall, alright."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Sadly, this is a not a Bock. This is a dark colored, watered down pilsner. It is missing the medium range ABV, the girth in terms of body, and more profound malt characteristics. Down the drain...."
""
""
""
"Shiner products just became available in my area, though I had tried some in Wyoming a year or two ago. While this beer has little in common with any German or microbrewed bock that I've tried, it may harken back to American ""bocks"" that came out seasonally way back in the day- quite a bit darker and a little sweeter than the average pale brew, with perhaps a tiny bit more alcohol."
""
"Not what I was expecting. After years of being a southern thing along with Fat Tire, Shiner Bock has finally come up to CT. There was a lot of hype surrounding this beer and when I tried it, it was hard not to be let down. It was thin for a bock, with the smell of the wheat and a little grapefruit on the nose. The taste was similarly thin although very refreshing. I thought it was a pretty good beer but altogether forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Altogether this is a nice beer which tastes good and is easy to drink. It isn't all that particularly special, but it's a hell of a lot nicer than what you'd expect from most large American breweries. Definitely something worth having on hand for just about any situation."
""
""

"As a Texan I have a special affinity for Shiner and the Spoetzl brewery. Shiner Bock is what turned me onto dark beers and it has always been one of my favorites. So good and popular that Anheuser-Busch had to copy it with their Ziegen Bock. It is in my opinion the Beer of Texas."
""
""
""
""
"Final notes: It could do with some better carbonation. After a decent pour, it went flat in only a few minutes, no bubbles even from an etched glass. It's sweetness and low hops might make it a good braising beer; I'll have to give it a go."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have developed a taste for Texas beers and the Spoetzl brewery does make some outstanding beers. It pours clean with a dark amber color, with white laces that lead up to a fluffy head that dissipates pretty fast. it has a malt taste, blended with hops, and has traces of metal, corn, sweet, and wheat tastes. It is smooth with malt after taste and is somewhat filling. For a better consumption drink it cool not cold...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice brown with pillowy head that quickly recedes. Minimal aroma so not much to talk about there. I think this beer is often served too cold and that obscures its taste and texture ... I definitely let some of the chill off from pulling it out of the display case at the package store and drink it cool, but not cold. This beer has a nice malty flavor with a hint of hoppiness. I would love it to be a bit thicker and maltier though. The mouth feel is very nice ... smooth and satiny. Again, serve it too cold and the taste and mouth feel attributes disappear."

"This excellent beer has a deep amber, almost copper, color and has a thin, white head. The smell is not overwhelming, in fact is very subtle. The taste is absolutely sublime. Not overpowering, not too hoppy, not bitter. It is perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky. This has been my all-time favorite beer for quite some time. It's very hard to beat this beer."

"Shiner Bock has been a favorite for a long time. But I admit it can be a mix bag. Some batches appear to be better than others. It seems the amount of dimethyl (cooked cabbage) ranges from mild to a lot. Get a good one and you have a nice german amber lager. It is always a beautiful clear amber. There's never too much happening in the nose. The flavor is toast, caramel, dimethyl. No hop presence here. The mouthfeel is rather thin but but still has some smooth creaminess and is not overly carbonated. A great session beer that beats mass market cheap stuff in every way."

"Short review for a beer that doesn't require a long one. It's a beer that... just... it is what it is. Affordable, decent, nothing-at-all-special beer. Sweet, quite thin, a good amount of carbonation, not very interest piquing. Probably wouldn't buy it again."

"Overall, had this on tap at a steakhouse... it was served in a frosted mug from a draft and I was actually blown away by how good it was. Picked up a sixer and the beer is refreshing but just ok. That said I believe this beer is best served very cold. For my next one, I have it in the snowbank and I'm gonna drink it right before it freezes."
""
""
""
"O: Despite scoring weakly in most categories, Shiner Bock IS, in fact, an okay brew. It's very disappointing considering it sports the ""bock"" name, but I guess it could hold its own against some American dark lagers. It's definitely light years ahead of most of the BMC offerings. It's not something I'd drink for the pleasure of its consumption, but I wouldn't object to mindlessly pounding down a few pints on Gameday with some friends."

""
""
"Pours a deep copper color with a huge fluffy off white head that persists forever. Aromas of light sweet pilsner malt, caramel and a hint of sulfur. Light earthy hop aroma. The flavor is more dark macro than bock honestly. Light sweet maltiness with a heavy overtone of caramel and faint earthy hop bitterness. Little to no hop flavor. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet slick mouthfeel. Easy enough to drink and really nothing flawed here. It's a bit sweet and could use some melanoids. Well at least this helped to get me thinking beyond cookie cutter macros all those years ago."

"I can see as a session beer on a hot day you could clear off a couple of sixers of these and still manage your 8X tablees. But nothing to the beer really. Doesn't taste terrible, just...bland."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Just average (maybe slightly below). Worth a try if you don't have any expectations (I didn't). Will not repurchase."
""
""
""
"Had straight from bottle so just giving a mid level appearance here. Easy drinking beer with plenty of flavor for a cheap price. Dark malts, some sweet molasses, and a slight adjunct lager aftertaste. Easy drinking and a good alternative to the macros at a BBQ. Certainly worth drinking with plenty of dark malt flavor to feed the taste buds. Not bad."

""
""
""

"O - There is nothing offensive about this beer, but it's not all that great either. As uninspired as it is, it's super drinkable, even as it warms. This was definitely one of the ""gateway"" beers for me. Growing up in Texas, I thought Shiner was the end-all, be-all for beer. Maybe it's gotten worse, or maybe my taste buds have matured. Either way, it's not something I would seek out anymore. Still, it holds a special place in my heart and is definitely a step or two above the macros."

"Poured from a bottle into a 12 oz plastic cup. Lovely light brown color. No head at all, just some attractive lacing. Little aroma at all. Flavor is disappointing, one-dimensional. Little bitterness, no detectable hops flavor. Mouth feel is thin. Overall a timid and uninteresting brew. I won't be trying it again. I've never sampled anything by the Spoetzl Nrewery before. I hope this is not their best!"
""
"I appreciate that Spoetzl is the oldest in brewery in Texas and that Shiner Bock is its longest-standing brand, but I don't understand the appeal - nor how the brewery became one of the top ten largest craft beer producers in America on the back of such a bland flagship recipe."

I suppose it's a good beer to give to a friend or relative who is looking into craft beers but is not ready for something like Stone, Laguanitas, or Sam Adams. For what it is, it's an okay beer."

"It goes down so smooth and easy and is a good session beer at a fair price."
"The initial smell made me immediately think back to college and had me worried at first. Taste wise it was no where near as bad as that first sniff made me think it'd be. Reminds me a lot of a few Steam beers that I've had. Its nowhere near the best beer in the world, but its a lot better than drinking anything red white and blue. I could definitely session these. I bought a 6 of it on a business trip to east Texas where I don't actually think craft/micro beer exists (best stuff I've seen is Sam and Goose Island) and figured I'd give a locally brewed Texas beer a try. I'm pleased with it overall and would definitely buy it again."

"I've got a couple good buddies who feel like I do. So you beer snobs can have your beer that no one can find, spell or stomach, I'll take a Shiner Bock and I'm not even from Texas."

"O: Not my favorite shiner, but drinkable and refreshing, better than a lot of other common beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Now, I have to level set for the rest of the 49 states that get Shiner weeks/months after it was made. I've toured the shiner brewery and can certainly attest to the affects of harsh storing and shipping condition on beer. I have had the flat, bitter, watery shiner bock that has been reviewed and I have also tasted the sweet ""Texas tea"" that is shiner bock, hours/days after the factory brewed it. Do not blame the brewery or the beer for the failings of time and mishandling of man. Firstly, shiner bock is no where near ""hoppy"" it is a sweet (as far as beers go) blend of yeast, malt, and hops. We sure do make bread with it down here. The deep caramel color is a clear indicator of taste. It is not intended to be be an overbearing weigh you down, alcoholic bock. It is refined for drinkability and sweet sipping (again think iced tea). It's certainly not a heavy headed brew that and does not pretend to be an exotic concoction of ingredients that blend together to make a disappointing off-putting flavor (Sam Adams Boston lager comes to mind). Take the traditional German respect for bier and an American sensibility for drinkability and crave for refreshing flavors and you have Shiner Bock. I can use apply all the adjectives and similes for the look but taste is he only thing that matters. I'd happily drink a shiner instead of a snobby craft beer placed on a pedestal that tastes like bathroom soap. If you notice the score I didn't say it was perfect due to the varying environments (consistency) I've tasted it in but it is good when it's good."
"Why is this rating an outlier"
""
"Shiner Bock pours a blackish color with a small lacing head. There aroma malts and garbage. The taste is similar to eat a pile of cat litter, rather pitiful. Watery and weak flavors (prb a good thing). Overall nearly a drain pour, weak and horrible flavors, but at least it pours nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Drinks pretty easy, tastes better in a bottle cold versus a pint glass. Would not seek out in the store, but would drink it over a standard light beer at a social gathering absent other options"
""
"Overall - Although it lacks in aroma and has a mediocre appearance, the taste of the brew makes up for it. It is smooth with a slight hint of bitterness at the end of the drink. Not the best beer, but great upgrade from your standard brews."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Eh, I'd put it on par with Yuengling. The problem here, though, is that it's a craft beer that tastes like a macro, which is never good. Additional points taken off for giving me a bit of a headache."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good summer beer that is simple and refreshing. A good candidate for a session beer if you don't want to overload your palate with anything intense. A good beer for non-craft drinkers at a party or event to broaden people's horizons."
"I'm not sure how I feel about seeing you here in the big city... I'm sure glad to see you... but I'm not sure I really want to bring you to any parties.... Maybe we can hang out the next time we're both back in TX?"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a deep red with a small white head that disappears very quickly. Smells of caramelized malt with not much else. Tastes of fruit and some malt, but still watery. Beer is definitely sessionable, but is light for a bock. Overall an average beer."

"O - Not a standout bock though also not deserving of the brutal reviews it here. Take it for what it is, a step up from the macors and something other than a pale ale."
""
"Overall, this may be the most overrated beer ever. Everyone in beer circles has heard of Shiner Bock and I guess if you've only had Bud Light your whole life, this would be a welcome change, but it's not a very good beer. I needed Doritos to finish the bottle because I couldn't drink it straight."
""
""
"Sweet malt up front, bready, a little toasted and caramel notes. Hop bitterness is minimal. Crisp and clean finish. Body is light, clean, crisp, refreshing, semi dry, sharp carbonation."
""
"O: A better than average session beer, especially for picnics and backyard BBQs, but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, in surprised at how poor this is. I remembered it 10 years ago as being a decent beer. It goes down fast, and there's not a whole lot to hang onto. Will never buy it again."
""
"as American made bocks go, which by and large isn't saying much, this one isn't really all that bad, and its a whole lot better than some of the other shiner brews. its got a sweetness to it that's only mild, and the darker malts give it some reasonable depth of both smell and taste. its got a roasted character that teams up well with the molasses like sweetness. the yeast is a little out of place her I think, not sure what they used, but its off. furthermore, you cant have a darker bock under 5% abv, it just doesn't do the style justice and it doesn't work for me. that being said though, there are no offensive flavors here, and this beer is actually pretty drinkable. in a bar where miller and coors products are my only option except this, I will go back to it again and again. plenty of room fro improvement, and its a far cry from the german traditional, but in the right context this can be very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just not even close style wise. Big disappointment. When I drink a bock I want sweet malt. This just tastes cheap"
""
""
""
""
" It didn't pour with a lot of head retention, but the overall color and clarity were good. It has very little aroma, mostly of crystal malt with little to no hop aroma. The flavor is the best part. Rich caramel flavor with a clean, crisp lagered finish. Very easy to drink. The mouthfeel was average for this type of beer. I would definately drink one of these again if I had my choice over having to drink Coors or Bud light. Definately a better choice."

"This is not the finest or best Bock beer around in my travels. I think Shiners goal here is to produce a sessionable bock beer, which in my opinion is. I have had many of these over the years and come back on occasions. I could easily drink a six pack of these, decent with BBQ meats and beef. Nothing out of the ordinary here but a very light bodied bock, watery to me. Maybe a dark lager to some. Nothing worth seeking out unless you just have to try it."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Off-white head, good retention on a clear, deep copper body. Suddsy lacing. Aroma includes a caramel sweetness and maybe a touch of raisin and molasses. Taste is dominated by caramel malt, maybe a touch of vanilla and again raisins. Very, very easy beer to drink, over and over."

"Deep copper, white head has little retention and some lacing. Tastes and smell are of sweet bread and caramel, some grains.

Not bad, fairly straightforward and simple, drinkable."

"When there is only Bud and Miller around, this is a much better option. Smooth and easy to drink. Doesn't sit to heavy. No bitterness to be found. Just a good beer. Not great and certainly doesn't carry the cool factor now that there are so many Craft breweries out there, but I'm always satisfied after drinking it."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not that good for a bock. It's rather weak and suspiciously adjunct like. As a dark lager this would fare well. I wouldn't seek this out at the price it goes for."

"I used to have this occasionally in Missouri, it is not too common up here in Minnesota. A decent lawnmower beer if you want something different tasting than a pale lager. Not too strong, so you can have a few of them in a sitting. Nothing too special here."

"Shiner Bock is a great going-out beer. In a pool-hall with the buds, or a strip club....whatever the setting. It's a great beer to grill with, both to marinade and to drink while you cook. Shiner is the beer of Texas, and not without good reason. Grab a 6er and try it out next time you throw a grill on, and see what I mean."

"Body is medium at best, maybe a bit light for the style, carbonation is medium and somewhat crisp. Drinks clean and easy, so there’s that, and I can see how this might be appealing in the Texas heat. But it falls short of satisfying my malty cravings when I reach for a bock and isn’t something I’d reach for again if faced with any of the superior bottles on the shelf."

"overall nothing to write home about here; a bit of a boring, one-dimensional brew. on the other hand it's completely inoffensive - would put in in the ""something i wouldn't turn down if handed to me for free but won't seek out/pay for"" class."

"O: While I've had a number of these over the years, I hadn't had one in at least 5 years and my expectations were not high. So, i was pleasantly surprised to find an above average beer that's highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: Clean drinking, for those who want to keep things light on a hot summer day. Mindless downer, wont wow, but perhaps a gateway beer for your bmc buddies. Minimal hop presence shouldnt offend. A bock, more like a pale lager or blonde."

"boring color of a burnt yellow with a 1 finger off white head and lacing. tad on the taste side of caramel and real malty. was ice cold for all of about 30 seconds. terrible mouth feel and flow. bad after taste. slow to no carbonation depletion. very bad all around."

"I thought this was a nice presentation of the style. It was flavorful, well balanced and very drinkable."
"The appearance of this is dark, caramel brown with no head whatsoever and what appears like tons of carbonation. The aroma is slightly funky, slightly sweet, slightly caramel, and slightly nothing. The flavor is weak and not very bock like. The flavor is, well, weak for a bock. It isn't a bad flavor, it just isn't much of a bock. It mimics the smell and appearance. The MF is higher carbed than I would like, and i think of the style, and thin and watery. Overall, this is a beer. A bock, I am sure that it is, but not a great one."

"I know this doesn't have a very good rating but I'm not sure why? Its actually one of the best macro style brews I ever had. Its has some malty flavor and maybe even a munich style lager flavor. I just wish the abv was a bit higher, but other than that its probably a nice safety brew in a pinch."

"O - Shiner Bock seems to me like a decent session beer (though I still think Full Sail's Session series is a far better choice), but I would leave the compliments at that. I suppose the only reason I'm so harsh on Shiner is that I remembered this beer tasting good once, and now I'm left with this sort of Bock-adjunct hybrid that makes my tongue shrivel. I hope this is just a bad batch and that the next time I try this beer it performs a little better. 2.0"

"This was difficult because I used to drink Shiner all the time years ago when I lived in Corpus Christi because it was the only beer with some flavor to it. It's a caramel colored American lager with a little less carbonation and a touch of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O- Not quite the best beer the Shiner puts out, still better than most other readily available beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Nothing offensive about this beer, but nothing too interesting either. To call this a 'safe beer' seems an appropriate term."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a medium dark brown with no foam. Light malty smell - kind of a sweeter caramel smell. Light sweet malt taste - a little bland and with no carbonation. Mild and uneventful. Some cola flavor in there. Just enough bubbles to let you know its not the wort. But just Ok at best."
""
""
"Very watery mouthfeel, with too low of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is fine, I guess. It's got a fine body to it. The beer has a sweet mouthfeel but the hop character clashes with it. Overall, this beer is a pretty pathetic bock. It's not tasty at all. I feel like Padma Lakshmi when she was tentatively drinking Shiner Bock on season 9 of Top Chef. I feel you, Padma. I feel you."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is an easy to drink beer that I enjoy quite a bit. Nothing earth shattering by any means but it's something that makes me smile and I find myself drinking it more than any other brew."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An easy drinking everyday version of a bock. In all actuality, not very good, but simple and very easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink but nothing exceptional. Pairs well with Texas style BBQ. Quite sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours brown with an off-white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma or roasted malts is present, but it is not a strong aroma. The malt flavor is pretty mild and the taste is clean and crisp. The hops flavor is pretty mild. Like the Blonde, it does not leave much lacing behind. It is still an average beer, but I remember knocking back quite a few of these years ago."

"Overall, this a mild average bock, could use some more caramel flavor, but the bitterness was ok"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not a bad session beer."
""
""
""
"O. Pretty light bodied, little aroma, and little flavor. Overall average beer at best. Definitely want more flavor than shiner bock delivers."
""
"Poured this Bock from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Bock poured a reddish brown color, produced a very thin off white head and it disappeared instantly. Poor Head retention. The aroma consists of some malted grain and not much else- No hops any other scent to speak of. Medium in body, this bock features some toasted grain flavor, just a slight hint of sweet caramel- Not much to get excited about here- i guess i would prefer this to say AB's Amber Bock. Not a bad brew to try once. Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A joke, not worth a drink, i seen this beer all the time, just grabbed one bottle to try, thought it was a classic, just a poorly made cheap bock. Not worth the time to drink."
""
"Overall, it's good to wash food down. Doesn't leave any terrible tastes in your mouth. Probably would be worth the money if it were a bit cheaper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Im a bit let down. I have only been drinking good beer for about 6 months so I am not familiar with everything and I saw this while buying a mix and match 6 pack and saw it was a bock. Other bocks have really been awesome experiences. This one is just not. But other than that its not a bad beer at all and is pretty pleasing to the palate. Give it a try and compare it to other bocks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Listen, I think Shiner Bock is an American classic. It tastes just like itself and is very easy on the palate. But it's distinctive despite the easiness. Now it may not look or smell like anything special. It's certainly not a textbook ""bock."" What it is is a hell of a good session beer. Hop flavor isn't what distinguishes this. It's the grainy malted carbonation. It's got its own zing that isn't bitter or citrusy, just a good medium-bodied lager with modest alcohol content. I'm more than likely going to have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'd rather buy Yuengling or Red Oak Amber Lager to achieve this taste. I would not purchase it again."
""
""
""
"O- No hate to the brewers or to the fans, but I advise fans of quality brews to stay far away from this... beer?"
""
""
""
"(Seriously, I've had this one on tap before and it tasted and smelled much better than the bottled version.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is best described as a malty american adjunct that disappoints especially on the palate, with the feel not far behind. I really hope that this is not anyone's introduction to the bock style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Look, I'll drink a Shiner Bock if I'm at a restaurant and it's that or a BMC, but there's just not a lot going on here. Too bad Texas restaurants often carry this in lieu of a Sam Adams Boston Lager."
""
"OVERALL GRADE: C-/D+"
""
"O-Not too bad of a beer. I don't think it deserves its poor rating. Certainly much better than any BMC and easily findable. Are there better beers out there? Hell yes but it is a decent beer and priced reasonably."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I haven't had one of these in a long time and I always remembered it being better than this. Not sure if this is one I will seek out again as there are better beers available for a similar price."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I can detect no off flavors or smells so this is crafted rather well but not as tasty as class offerings of the style. Not as bad to drain pour though so I can finish the other 3 rather easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer isn't bad, but it's not great either. I like the color of the beer, but it's virtually headless."
"O= Average in every sense of the word, a forgettable beer but it's widely available in areas In my state that traditionally only sell BMC"
""
""
""
"D - It's certainly drinkable, but I'd pass on this boring beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"a thin tan head settles quickly on top of a reddish brown body leaving no lacing. smell and taste are both very caramel forward, not much else. once again shiner produces a thin watery over carbonated beer. overall not excited as some with this beer. goes down quick and smooth, just doesnt offer much for flavor other than being a malt bomb. once again i would like to see some hops to cut thru the sweetness of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sadly there was no wow factor that made me want this beer, it was just far too week for my tastes. If you want something rather cheap, go for it. Otherwise, I wouldn't really recommend this to suit your needs."

"I don’t think of Shiner Bock as a bock—in the technical, beer-style sense. It’s lighter in color, lighter in flavor, and lightered bodied than a Salvator or any other beer faithful to the style. But that doesn’t mean it’s bad. Or good. Point is, Shiner Bock is one of those beers that I have a love/hate relationship with. Sometimes it hits the spot—and I’ll take a Shiner over BMC anytime—but sometimes I just plain don’t care for it. So there."

"Could quaff this, but would rather, you know, drink something good?"

""
""
""

"Overall: There is nothing great about this beer, but there is nothing bad either, its pretty good. It is the beer that Texas kids drink when they want to act like they are having a less mainstream style beer without actually having to put up with anything to strong. Hey, thats their choice, and I would be lying if I wasn't thankful that people bring beers like this instead of just bud light to parties."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Extremely bland, and extremely pointless. It's barely above the watery nothingness of an American adjunct lager. Bock?? Yeah, just fuck the hell off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end this beer wasn't a shitty beer at all and i'm not saying it was, i'm just not into this style. Give it a try for yourself i know that Shiner is a respectable lable and they put out more then a few great beers."
""
"The color is a light brown color, kinda like iced tea. The foamy head dissipates quickly although refreshing though. Nose is very mild, mostly malt. Has a slight grain smell and little else. Its a nice beer for taking to the lake or camping. Will drink again though."
"I supposed you could have quite a few of these f you liked them, because the ABV is low and the density is pretty close to water. I don’t hate this beer, but don’t really enjoy it much."

"Situation: a typical Thursday garding and laughing (at TV)... Glassware: Celebrator doppelbock.... Appearance: mellow brown with a thinning head--not much to look at at first glance.... Aroma: light and malty, with low hops and an easy-drinking introduction... Palate: smooth, medium-bodied--clearly a presence, a bock headbutt.... Taste: the malitness is like a ramped-up, amped down version of our beloved Yuengling Lager--a reverential comparison from a Northeastern Pennsylvanian... Overall: an odd review, paradoxical in its ""what you see/smell is NOT what you get!"" variety--and that’s quite alright--when a bock is NOT judged by its cover, or as a bock! When it’s limited by the state of Texas in its alcohol content--clearly a win for us all..."
""
""
""
"This beer is incredibly wet and watery for a bock. It has practically no flavor and just feels completely flat. Easy drinking yes, but pretty darn boring, someone hand me a Sam Adams winter lager at least."
""
""
"D: a light bodied beer with some good crystal malt flavors. pretty easy to find Texas-made brew in my neck of the woods. average overall."
""
""
"O: Underwhelmed by this one. There are far better Bocks out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If I was in a shitty bar somewhere and didn't like their beer selection, it is possible they might still have this and it may still be cheap on the wallet so I would go with that over the other major domestics. I'd rather have a Celebrator (I know, not a regular bock...) but these were on sale at $11 for a 12 pack. I'd consider that a fair price for this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability - I've had this beer before and it was much more flavorful. Must be a flat keg, bad lines, or maybe a false memory. Not sure why it's so watery compared to my memory."
"Overall- Have had better bocks. Not bad, but nothing special."
"Overall: I use to drink this all the time when I started to get into craft beers. I usually get this beer for a party because it doesnt offend anybody and is very cheap (12 pack for 11 dollars). I dont really care much for it now, but it is what it is."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark amber with a small, short lived, off-white head and slight carbonation. Aroma is of bready malt, caramel and some grassy hops. Light, slightly crisp body. Not much flavors are going on the palate: some bready malt and light hops. Drinkable but forgettable brew."
"Overall, Shiner Bock is a basic but enjoyable dark larger that quenches the thirst without making you think too much. Pretty decent for what it is; I would quaff this at a party no problem."
"Poured vigorously into a pint glass, got a 1 inch head that almost instantly dissipated. The color is brown, but very clear. I detected a faint slight sweet smell, but mixed with metallic odor was not so appealing. The taste was very light, metallic with a slightly nutty sweetness, but very bland, not matching the color. The mouthfeel is slight carbonation, no real impressiveness there. I find this overall to be not terrible compared to other macro lagers, but not great. I am somewhat disappointed."
"Overall Impression- Since living in Texas, I haven't enjoyed a Shiner Bock in quite some time! I have to say, there is some actually character to this one! Some of the categories don't fit the ""bock"" style but I have to say, this one is one hell of a brew! Very malty and has a nice honey/caramel aroma and taste throughout. Will be enjoying again!"
"O: I guess this beer could be refreshing, but you have a lot better options out there. Worth trying because it's a classic but don't buy more than one!"
"So-so sessionable brew. Not as good as Yeungling but better than the macros. Wouldn't turn this down, but wouldn't go looking for it either."
"O: I'm sure if I were in a crappy Texas bar and this were my only choice outside of the usual bland yellow lagers, I would take it. That, however, is not a compliment to this beer. Has nothing remotely in common with a real bock. I think I'll avoid this one from this point forward."
"Would not buy it again."
"O - Not a beer I would consider among the best, but I like it and definitely appreciate its ubiquity in Texas."
"O: Finished the bottle...and I could probably do it again but there are many beers I'd drink first. Not overly pleasant to any of the senses."
"O: Overall would definitely drink this one again, nice balance."
"I bought this beer in Washington, D.C. because I was in a terrible beer store and this was the only thing on the shelf that I hadn't already tried. Maybe I should have stuck with something else. It's not terrible, but it's a stretch to call it a bock."
"I prefer Shiner in a can over a bottle and from the tap. But, all are good. Overall, a great beer. This is my daily beer, great flavor and not overpowering."
"o: finally get to try this.. its not bad for what it is.. makes for a good session brew."
"Although this beer is marketed as a bock, it is closer in style to a Vienna lager. Relatively low in alcohol and taste (the opposite of a proper bock), this beer is nevertheless refreshing with a meal and a definite step up from the usual big-name American beers. In Texas, it is almost as widely available as Budweiser, making it a good go-to beer in situations where no true microbrews are available."
"Side note, Shiner's labels are pretty entertaining and informative. I especially liked the ram on the cap of this one."
"I was very disappointed with this beer. It almost had no flavor. I thought it looked great when the bartender brought me over a tasting glass but was very surprised to taste almost nothing. A lot of carbonation and very light and almost no taste notes that my taste buds could pick up."
"Honestly, this was a sink pour after drinking about a quarter of it."
"I think this is a good example of an American bock beer brewed in Texas. My Shiner poured a dark amber color with an average sized head that dissipated a little too rapidly for me. It has a robust malty flavor with a slight hint of hops and good carbonation. This is a great all-purpose bock beer that goes good with bar-b-ques and other meaty dishes."
"I don't get the following on this beer. I must be a bit of an elitist I guess."
"This is a great Bock, especially for one that's offered year round. This is a great all-purpose beer to keep on hand."
"I had this beer on tap at the Tower of Americas Bar in San Antonio. It was a dark beer with a light taste and mild flavor. It didn't have a lot of bite. I live in New York and our community beer store has a lot of imported beers from around the world, but this one I can't find in the city."
"O-obviously not a world class beer, but when stuck in a beer wasteland of BMC products, this is a treat. its very crisp and something that can be easily consumed in large amounts."
"D – Easy drinker, smooth tasting lighter bodied brew. Glad I had tried the brew but wouldn’t seek it out again"
"D - Poor flavor profile and thin mouthfeel make one more than enough."
"If this beer weren't over carbonated and had just a slightly more robust flavor profile, it would be a really decent beer. As it stands it's just OK."
"O - hadn't had a Shiner in years, and I'm thinking I'll take another break. Still this has so often been an oasis of a tap handle at a dive bar, just as it wad tonight. Goes down well while kicking back and viewing hipster antics and listening to bad local music"
"D: Meh.... pass"
"Pours a medium brown color, with very little head. Almost no carbonation and just about zero lacing. The smell is very one dimensional to me. Wheat, a tiny bit of malt, and an odd copper smell. Very thin nose on this beer. The taste is about the same. Very thin, uninteresting, and not worth finishing. This one's a drainpour for me. Mouthfeel is somewhat dry and definitely on the thin side, with a copper aftertaste. Overall, I would not recommend this beer.. You can do a lot better for the style."
"O - I'd like to think that I got an old bottle but I'm not too sure."
"If I am looking to drink a bock, I will pass on this."
"In Texas, it is a ""Good"" Beer and can be had inexpensively almost anywhere. Outside of Texas, I would say to avoid it. Many of the people here know this, it is a shame that they give that other beer the same name."
"D/O- With such a low abv and its easy drinkingness, its no wonder why this is so popular. I found it very quaffable."
"The beer appeared to be clear, slightly darker amber than expected with a finger of white, foamy head that faded in a matter of seconds. No lacing to mention, but some noticeable carbonation floating to the top of the glass. The aroma was overall pretty weak. It gave off a very light bread aroma that was slightly sweet. Not much more than that. The taste was pretty well as expected, very light in flavor, but followed the nose with no hops to mention. The beer was light in the mouth, carbonation seemed to be right and drinkability was on par with other beers of a similar nature that is to say below average. Overall, while better than the likes of some light beers, this is not a beer that I will have often and more than likely will pick something else if I see it on tap."
"It was on sale at the grocery store and I hadn’t tried it yet, so I decided to give it a go. Poured the first one, not much head at all, smell was hoppy and metallic with some toasty notes in there as well. Although it is kind of dark in color, it is not a heavy beer and it’s very easy to drink. The flavor is sweet, toasted and nutty with some hop flavor as well. It’s really not bad, more than I expected, but it’s nothing special. It lacks the flavor that real bocks bring to the table and has nothing that makes it stand out, but it tastes pretty good and is light enough to be drinkable, so I can’t complain."
"Overall, this is a pretty unimpressive beer. It's not undrinkable, but it doesn't impress. The flavor profile is very lacking. The beer comes across as watery and not very complex."
"Pours a clear orange color with a small 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. No lacing whatsoever. Smell is of bready malt only. Pretty one dimensional overall. Taste is just like the smell with only a biscuit-like malt flavor coming through. This beer has a very high level of carbonation with a crisp and effervescent mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with a one dimensional smell and taste."
"Brownish/ruby colored liquid. Very thin off white head. No lacing. Lots of carbonation. Smell was grainy. Faint fruity smell. Taste was bland. Malty, but not enough punch. Thin mouthfeel. Very disappointed by this beer given it's popularity. Easy drinking beer that is not terrible overall, but just lacks flavor and individuality."
"Overall this was less than impressive and rather disappointing. My money can be better spent elsewhere."
"It is a nice beer, but not any better than the much cheaper Yuengling."
"This is on tap just about everywhere in the Texas panhandle, since this is the easiest slightly darker / non American Adjunct beer to find here, I drink it quite a bit. Its a brownish / amber / copper color, very clear with a whitish head which goes away quickly. The smell is faint, a slight sweetness / maltiness very little to no hops. The mouthfeel is pretty light with some decent carbonation. The taste is okay, you get mostly some maltiness, no bitterness to speak of. Overall this beer is better than the 3 big alternatives, but I've long since grown tired of it but its all I can find with my meals so I still order it (while hoping to find someplace which at least has Guinness or Sam Adams on tap). It does have a pretty big following here in Texas, its the super popular ""craft"" beer, I've read somewhere its the best selling beer in Texas....I almost have to be careful not to let people I know see this review, they might feel betrayed."
"Pours a clear auburn color with little to no head. A little yeasty malt on the nose along with some light carmel, or maybe even molasses as I get a touch of smokey edge. This is not a bad beer, but when you treat it as a bock, it doesn't really hold up. As compared to a more serious bock beer? Not so good. As compared to other American amber lagers from widely available brewers? Not bad at all."
"This overall has the qualities of a macro beer, but it's definitely better than BMC.  I'd probably give the tap version a try if I ever find myself in TX.  "
"Overall glad I stole this tick because it's not worth paying for, even as a $2 single."
"Feels good on the tongue, with an almost clean finish. A lot of drink ability for a bock I'd say, and I didn't mind its muted features."
"Poured a clear, copper-brown with a thin, white head. Pale malts in the nose, caramel sweetness. Basic, but nice. Lightly toasted malts in the taste, with notes of toffee and caramel. Not much as far as hops goes, so it's overall sweet, but lacking a good balance. Medium-light mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable, though nothing extraordinary. Just a good ""night out"" beer."
"This beer was omnipresent during my years in Texas and I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for it, even if it doesn't stack up so well when held up for review."
"drinkablilty - this beer is very easy to drink but its not really complex or enjoyable enough for me to seek out, my second time trying out of bottle was really not much better then tap, id avoid"
"I had this beer at Cousin's BBQ at the Dallas Airport. It was served in a plastic pint cup. The beer was Medium brown in color with a sweet aroma. The beer was smooth, dry, a little bitter and metallic taste. No after taste at all. Best Texas beer I have had."
"I have to say that this is better than I remember. I could be hallucinating, but it seems to have gained some body and depth of flavor since I last tried it. Who knows- it's been a awhile. In any case, the pour isn't much- very dark maber, almost chestnut with a head that promises much but fades quickly. Nicely malty and nutty in the aroma with some toasted grain and some light earthy hop aromas on the finish. The taste has some more of that toasted grain, a fair bit of sweetness, and some cereal grains. There is a bit of grainy slickness and slight sourness on the finish, but the nicely toasty notes are still there. Probably suffers more in the mouthfeel than taste from these defects. I could drink this ocassionally."
"Overall: great cheap beer for cooling off in the Texas heat."
"Overall-One more beer to try out of the Spoetzl brewery ""Shiner"" six pack. Thank goodness, these beers suck."
"Really didn't find this beer appealing at all. It was plain to the point of almost being undrinkable. Simple beers can be (very) good but to be honest I think I'd rather drink a bud light."
"I will not buy this again."
"O- It is not gonna win any awards, but in Texas it is hot. This is a good beer on a hot day. Goes down easy."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Not much of a head on initial pour, and what there was dissipated extremely quickly leaving only the faintest traces of foam. Appearance is medium deep orange-copper. Aroma is very underwhelming, with only the faintest hint of hops, and no malt notes to be found at all. taste is very similar; not much at all to be found, and overall, quite watery. Mouthfeel is a bit of an improvement, with a bit of body and some nice, tight carbonation present. Overall, while not an offensive product, this beer left quite a bit to be desired."
"O: Kinda reminds me of an extremely watered down Sam Winter. I would not try again, but is a session beer."
"Overall: Pretty much how I remember it. Decent, especially when I was in Texas and it was this or BMC, but not something I would go out of my way for. Also very overpriced here in NJ, I would put it on par with Yuengling, but its price is more in line with Sierra Nevada."
"D: Drinkable maybe on a hot summer day, but with so many craft choices here, not going with this novelty again"
"Shiner Bock-maybe it's just a Texas thing but I could kick it back all day. Nice and light, easy to drink, admittedly out of line for a bock but we love it. Perfectly hopped for enjoying in the hot Texas sun and with a nice touch of sweetness on the finish. Great with a generous wedge of lemon. We love it and the whole world would to if they could get their hands on it."
"D - Perfectly fine for an easy to obtain convenience store beer."
"Not too impressed with this American depiction of a thoroughly classic European style. Light-bodied; thin, lacking strong aroma nor noticeable flavor. Easy on the palate but nothing to write home about. Not particularly recommended. Pours a light-brown hue with minimal foam and carbonation. Not a very well-rounded beer to say the least."
"It barely has any scent, but what it has is OK. It also is well crafted - it does not have any offensive taste, which means you could drink a few and not get sick. I am usually looking for a little more, though. This isn't even as good as Genny bock."
"D: For a bock, the flavors are rather weak, its a good introductory beer for people that only drink BMC, especially at its price, but it tastes more like a light lager than a bock."
"Part of the Shiner mixed 12 pack, really liked all of them so far. I've actually heard of this beer before, and it's one of my least favorite styles but I'll try anything. Pours a reddish/orange color, not much going on in the aroma department. Very little carbonation, almost seems like it's flat. Mouthfeel is a bit rough, for a low ABV beer has a bit of an alcohol taste and not very appealing. I drink the two bottles in the box, but would never purchase this on its own. Not the worst beer I've had, but definitely not a good one by any means."
"Bottom line: Is it horrible? not at all. It has some metallic notes that remind me of canned macro. It is for sure refreshing and if I had it in cans in my area this would be a great fishing beer for when I am on the Illinois river on my dads boat."
"O: Pretty average in my opinion. I had this a couple years ago with bbq in Austin, and I liked it then. This time when actually thinking about what I was drinking I was a little more unimpressed. Will probably have again in the future somewhere in Texas, but I won't actively seek it out."
"I can easily rap off dozens of beers that are worse than this. I'd drink quite a few of these with no issues. I guess I like it (wondering if my slender Euro pint was making this easy on me)."
"Poured a darker copper color with just a small amount of beige head on it. Smell was pretty weak, some caramel malt but not a lot going on here. Taste was decent but again, was a little on the weak side. Some spice along with the malt, but there could have been more here I think. Light bodied beer that went down pretty easy. This wasn't a bad beer at all, but I think it could have been a little better. That being said, it went down smooth and tasted pretty good overall."
"D- A bock to go for in a crunch and priced approprietly for what you get. I would drink a few in a party setting, although I think I might of enjoyed this a bit more from a can."
"Overall a very average bock, nothing to write home about."
"Clear copper chestnut colored with a low beige head that settles quickly. Low aroma of toasty malt and biscuit. Flavors of toasty malt, matched with moderate bitterness, some corny notes, faint caramel. Thin mouthfeel, a bit tingly. Could be more complex."
"A+++ BEER!!!!"
"D: Very weak bock beer. Move along there is nothing to see or taste here. Wish this was a greater attempt at a fine style."
"Not worth the price."
"It really is not worth the price it usually is charged for by retailers."
"Poured from a bottle into a Weisse vase, the beer is a slightly hazy nutty/auburn-brown color with a thick, white head that settles into a quarter inch layer of foam. Smells were very muddled, but I got hints of nutty and caramel malty aromas. Round, malty flavors on a crisp, light body. The flavors are a bit underwhelming, and I could pick out hazelnut and caramel. High carbonation makes the beer sharp on the tongue, and the flavors are a bit bland for the body and style. There is a light, malty aftertaste that vanishes quickly. The finish is crisp. This is a mediocre beer."
"A friend in college told me this was his favorite beer. I think it's time to introduce him to the good stuff."
"D i gave a four cause low alcohol makes this a good session beer."
"D: Because of the smoothness, it is very easy to drink. It would be no problem to go through a six pack. Overall, it is an average beer."
"Being from TX, I can drink a Shiner (back to back) at a restaurant where all they serve is the usual nasty lager fare. But I wouldn't pick up a 6-pack at my grocery store."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. I've had my share of this beer and it's easy to go through a six pack. That's probably because of how light it is."
"I preferred it a little more on tap than in the bottle (no surprise there). I'm surprised the average score is as low as it is. Seems like a decent beer to me."
"D- An easy to drink beer and easy to session, but it just is a sub-par beer for me."
"D: I've had this on tap a few years ago and it was better but still not great."
"D: This is very macro-esque. And to think that Texans SWEAR by this garbage."
"It pours a dark amber with a one finger off white head. There's not too much to the nose, perhaps just light carmel malt. The flavor consists of slightly sweet carmel and it's slightly bready. On tap, it drinks just fine. It's between light and medium in body and also features good carbonation. I find this to be very drinkable and I'm not even a fan of the style."
"I have a soft spot for this beer probably because it's the first micro I ever actually liked, probably because I had not matured my palate yet. It has a wonderful color when compared to the usual Bud & Coors type mass produced brews. It's quite drinkable. And many times I've made a run to a convenience store & this was the best beer there. I was happy to see it on the shelf. Its only real drawback is it's much too lite for my stout riddled taste buds. It is an all-around good alternative to Bud, Bud Light or any other cheap swill."
"This Beer is alright. its the beer that got me into local beers. Shiner Bock is an average beer. A beer i would drink before anything AnBus but if theyre is pretty much any other craft brew on tap i would take it over this. It has a relatively low alcohol percentage so its real easy to get down and its could easily be a session beer. All in all its okay. i wish they put more effort into their beers."
"Notes: Another Shiner beer that I was underwhelmed by. This one is just too heavy on sweet caramel and copper metallic flavors. Nothing that I would seek out or really want to drink. I wouldn't turn one down, but I wouldn't buy one again."
"Pours a dark amber with a modest beige head and some great lacing. Aroma is incredibly sweet with whiffs of toffee and caramel. Taste is a little watery and similar to Yuengling albeit a bit heavier- very much like artificial maple syrup. Long, sweet aftertaste. Not offensive, smooth and drinkable. But this is not a bock."
"Overall - Somewhat bland in taste yet refreshing and crisp none-the-less. Nothing noteworthy yet it would be a nice beer for me to add as a summer slammer to complement the couple of adjunks that I prefer."
"I personally like the taste of the beer. Its color is good which fits its taste. I did notice after a while that it has been pulled from tap that it acquires a lack of a better word, a buttery taste that really dosn't go good with anything. I do like this beer and I'm not bashing it. The Buttery taste in my opinion did not take effect until thirty or so minutes after pour. I do keep some in my fridge. I have Shiner before to make burgers with, which turned out great. Good beer for Beer lovers."
"I can't say this was a favorite. Poured dark brownish with a white head. Smell was wheaty, as was the taste with a sort of watery finish. Can't remember much of the smell except it being wheaty, nothing great about it. Taste was like watered down wheat toast. Had a sort of thin mouth feel. Not a very fun beer and hardly worth going out of your way to get, though the light alcohol and lack of a strong taste might make it good for session drinking."
"This is a pretty easy drink. For me this was a slight step above say the normal BMC line up. No problem finishing this and I wouldn't refuse one if I was handed one but I don't plan on buying this one again."
"When I pay a premium price for beer, I expect to obtain a premium beer. Shiner Bock is a serious disappiontment, because it sits beside the likes of Sierra Nevada and Sam Adams. I should have bought one of those."
"I think this bock is just on the edge of the worthy ones but stays out of the league, don't think I'll go back to it."
"I used to love Shiner, but after exploring more beers this is becoming less of a favorite. I can now taste the bad water quality that they use. When I went to the brewery the creek that ran beside the place was dried up. I guess that south texas heat just does not help with beer making."
"The mouthfeel is very crisp and carbonated and fairly pleasant, and the drinkability is just about average. There's really nothing special in this beer. It's just a step up from BMC swill. I'd drink one if offered, but I doubt I'll be purchasing this again. Glad I only got a single. As far as mainstream, easily available bocks go, Leinie's 1888 blows this out of the water."
"Got this in a trade with depechemode1983, thanks man! Pours a semi- transparent ruddy brown color (maybe better described as maple syrup color) with a 1in off-white head. Smells of bready malt and slightly of alcohol. A friend told me they use rice in this beer, I think I can smell it a bit. Taste is of sweet malts with a touch of wheat hops. The finish has a little bit of malt and makes you want another sip. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation. I know many others don't like this beer, but I really enjoyed it for what it is. As a bock it may not be very impressive, but style aside, this beer is delicious and enjoyable to drink. At 4.4% ABV it's pretty dang sessionable. I think it would be best enjoyed in the end of summer and during fall. It has a lot more taste and color tha. Your average APA or lawnmower beer, but it's still not so overwhelming that isn't refreshing."
"A little less than one finger of very light brown head. Lace was a little lacking on cling. Color was a rich medium dark amber, with good micro bubble action. Smell was average, nothing really stood out, aromas of roasted wheat, malt, and a little pine. Taste was well balanced with traces of wheat, corn, malt, and just a touch of hops. Refreshing, with good flavor, but nothing special. Not a bad price for a beer that tastes better than any of the big three in this type."
"Not a great beer, but here in Texas it's the same price as Coors Light at a bar, which makes it great value for the money when you're out."
"More than a macro but not much more."
"Perhaps the best of the three I've had so far, which isn't saying a lot. Still, I could see drinking this again."
"If you're into a beer with a earthy flavor, this beer is for you. you can certainly drink a lot of these as the abv is under 5%, but would you really want to?"
"Overall this beer is definitely better in Texas on tap then in Kansas out of a bottle. It is a wonderful session-able beer."
"Average lager at best, but at $8.50 a sixer around here one can do much better."
" The flavor is moderately creamy from the malt and carbonation that is high in the mix. The slight sweet essence of the cornpops is there with slight tinge of very gentle woody qualities -not sure if it is malt or hop derived with a slight light brown sugar element. the finish is semi-dry with slight slick effect on the palate. The 'bock' is ok for me, I kind of enjoyed it with some deep fried appetizers and the steak it was paired with was perfect which made me feel the beer was drinkable in the setting. I could take it or leave it personally, but if no other options are available it is ok."
"Drinkability is solid. If nothing was available, this would do. It's an easy drink, despite not being a super special one."
"Was much better on tap."
"D - This bock has all the classic flavors, but it is somewhat lacking in intensity of flavor. The aroma is quite nice with lots of complex, sugary notes that are exactly what I would expect from a traditional bock. The flavor has all of the same flavors, but they seem just a bit dull and perhaps not as dark as they should be. Some flavor and intensity would almost have to be sacrificed considering the low alcohol content, but all things considered this beer works quite well."
"D: See above."
"Pours an amber-brown body with an initially light head dwindling to faint lacing. Smells of slightly metallic husk but not too strongly. Tastes of toasted grain, tiny pinch of hops with a relatively sweet and dry finish. Cannot pick up any strong traces in particular. In this bock style, this beer could use a bit of ""beefing"" up in terms of flavor, however, this is a light, refreshing beer nonetheless."
"On a business trip to Memphis, I grabbed a bottle of this popular beer. It poured a deep golden color, with manifest carbonation, over a finger of white head, and average retention. The nose was somewhat unspectacular; malty, with only slight notes of apple and caramel. The taste was a little more pronounced, with malty fruit notes, and a sweet finish. Very thin and highly carbonated, the feel made it easy enough to session, though I would have appreciated a little more intensity in the flavor profile."
"D- For a beer at is a little light and water it is not too hard to put down. I got this in a beer a beer exchange and did enjoy it, but I would not buy it for myself."
"D- Easy enough to drink, just bland and boring."
"Drinkability - This brew is not as good as I remember. Haven't had it for a couple of years. Mostly average to slightly below average in my opinion. It is fairly drinkable. I don't know... I just don't have much to say about it. Kind of ""blah""."
"Drinkability: Unassuming. Look here if you want a bit more complexity than mass marketed brews."
"Pours a clear brown with almost soda like off-white head. No lacing at all. Lots of carbonation visible in the pint glass. Smells metallic. Hints of bread in the middle. There are also faint malts in the background. Taste is somewhat bitter. This beer reminds me of green olives. Im also getting a little sweetness from the malts, although not nearly as much as i would like. Mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated. Very crisp. Although not a very good example of the style its ok. There flavors are not horrible offensive and it has a low ABV. More drinkable than a lot of other mass produced beers."
"Not my favorite Texas beer but readily available and has good drinkability more than most other non-light beers anyway. Even using a koozie it can get warm quickly, which is a bit of a drag when you live in a hot climate. I'd recommend trying it though."
"Overall, this wasn't a favorite bock of mine. Mouthfeel is way off. I like German bocks much better. Not really for me. A bit too simple."
"Pours an amberish copper color with a thick white head that goes away very quickly and leaves only a little tiny bit of lacing. Smells of some roasted malt and not much else. Tastes much the same like a little sweetness from the malts and a little hop bitterness to round it out. Mouthfeel is a little watery and drinkability is okay. Not a very strong rendition of style here. Too much lack of flavor."
"If you drink for flavor, aroma, and overall experience, move on elsewhere. If you are just looking for something cheap that most BMC drinkers will not object at, this one is not a bad choice."
"Drinkable, if not a little bland. There are certainly better bocks out there, but if one wants a very quaffable, inoffensive session brew, this will work."
"The taste is a bit oxidized with a bit of cardboard. Some toast in there with caramel, plus a light earth feel. It tastes like I imagine wet leaves would. Wow. The nose was decent enough but this taste is really not very good at all. There's an off-bitterness in the feel as well. Thin and gross. The appearance and nose weren't too shabby, but it just goes way, way downhill after that."
"There are many, many more beers that I'd choose over this one."
"Bock? Really? I would not consider this a bock, but perhaps a dark lager. The appearance is too clear and light to be a bock and there is no head retention. The smell is weak and tends toward malty toast and molasses. It's doesn't taste sweet enough to be a bock despite the malty bread notes and it is certainly too watery to be a bock. The upside is that it is certainly easy to drink. This is more reminiscent of Negro Modelo than of any bock I've ever had. Don't let the goat on the label fool you, this is about as far away from a German bock as you can get."
"Overall, it's yate."
"Side note, when I was growing up I had a Shiner Bock tshirt that said ""Brewed with an Attitude."" It was pretty sweet, I wish I still had it."
"Overall, I was surprised with how thin and flat the flavors seemed compared to my memory of sitting in the outdoor patio of a bar in Columbia, SC, mingling with friends the night before a buddy's wedding, and clearing out the bar's stock of Shiner Bock. It is certainly better than a common adjunct lager, but it just doesn't measure up against other options in the style."
"Overall i thought this was a pretty mediocre beer, I expect something a little more bolder and less watered down from a bock. Won't be picking this up again."
"drinkablity goes down pretty well"
"And in Texas, it's usually $1 a draft. Can't beat it."
"Beautiful dark amber with a small white head. Too bad the head was extremely short-lived. Smells is nutty and toasty. The taste is very light. There are hints of hazelnut and toasted malt, as well as a hop tang. Unfortunately, I also taste some graininess which isn't necessarily bad, but it's definitely a taste I associate with ""cheap."" Highly quaffable and refreshing, but I certainly wasn't blown away."
"Very drinkable beer - these go down easy"
"I've had tastier bocks before, but this one is an easy drinker and not hard to down at all."
"Notes: I drank more than a few of these the last time I was down in Texas. This is an easy drinking beer in the summer heat and it pairs very well with Texas BBQ."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. About one finger of head and 0 lacing. While the look of the beer was what I expected, the initial smell was fairly absent. Overall not impressed by the taste, seems watered down and fairly boring. fair amount of carbonation, which I usually enjoy, but it just does not fair well with the taste of this beer. Might go good with a spicy meal, but otherwise you wont find me buying this anytime soon. Maybe I need to try it on tap, as I can say I always enjoy beer more that way. There are much better choices out there."
"This pours a nice amber red. The white foam that has long been discarded. The smell is fairly vacant. What does come through is the corn syrupy rice-like aroma of an AAL not a Bock. The hops are soured if that is what I'm smelling. The taste is a caramel malt that fades away to taste like steel. The skunky ""steel"" taste tastes just like the movie starring Shaq. The malts are slightly burned and not really that pleasant. The mouthfeel is not bad it's well carbonated for it's medium body. I could see some people drinking this but not really me. I don't like this and I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends."
"The beer pours a nice brown amber body that cascades into gold highlights. Nice, creamy, light-brown head slowly recedes. The smell is big on chocolate notes and some bitter hops that are more dark chocolate than coffee. Airy like carbonation. Not much else. The taste is light and inoffensive. Slightly chocolate-sweet finish. I like the mouthfeel. Not too light and creamy, but not overloaded with carbonation. A beer I could probably drink all day if I had more."
"Still, not a lot going on with this brew. I've had it before in bottle, and I remember finding it awfully plain for a bock. To me, it's just like a heartier golden beer. A little in the hops category, a little in the malts. Soft on the palate. Not bad."
"D: Unexciting. I have had many better bock beers. This tastes like an assembly line macro-brewed bock."
"The beer pours a clear medium brown color with a white head. The aroma is grain with some toffee malt and grassy hops. The flavor is toffee and crass. I also get a little bit of something that resembles dark fruit, but it is subtle. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A Texas classic, but nothing too impressive. It certainly doesn't stack up to the some of the other craft beers from Texas."
"Very drinkable, love the color nice amber to it. Great malt taste you can really learn to enjoy this beer. Only problem to me is there really isn't alot of kick in it, but taste deffinetly compensates. One of my favorite beers. A Texas Classic beer that never disapoints. If you haven't tried it you really got to get your hands on one. Two thumbs up!"
"Not the first time having this beer, and I very much enjoy drinking it. Mostly because it's completely associated in my mind with Texas. Yes, it's not an excellent bock, but it feels old-fashioned trademark of a certain place. Next time I'm in Texas I'll drink it again."
"I'm à bit disapointed , i expected à litle bit more of this beer"
"Overall: Shiner Bock seems like a decent gateway beer to this style. Nothing great here, but there is some nice flavor and a great appearance."
"Matt"
"Beer is medium bodied and kind of malty. There is some minimal sweetness and there is a clean finish to the beer. Its not a great masterpiece but there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Its drinkable, it has a flavor and there is no nasty aftertaste. There are far worse beers that deserve to be on the bottom of the barrel list."
"Golden brown, auburn highlights, an enticing blend of earth tones, though head should grow more than 1/4 inch. The aroma is somewhat lacking, no negative qualities, but not enough positives to stand out among the kings. The malty flavor begs for an accompaniment of smoked almonds or similar cracked nuts; it sits well enough to satisfy, if not serve as a beckon call for another. All in all, this is a very loyal beer, both to the mind which filters the myriad of qualifiers, and to the heart, which loves that which it knows. Not a legend, but the bell cow of the ""Little Brewery"" will not disappoint."
"Overall a nicely solid bock here and certainly better then what I was expecting going into it."
"Shiner Bock pours into a pint glass a clear deep red amber color under a thin head and carries a mild nose of light sugar malt with a hint of candied cherry and caramel. Drunk immediately from the fridge, it opens up with an overshadowing carbonated feel and continues that way throughout, delivering little more than a held back caramel malt sweet undertone. Initially, I felt this restraint was due to too high of a carbonation but as the beer slowly warmed up toward room temperature, I noticed that the cold carbonated flood mellowed out and progressively allowed for a better sense of a mild dark malt sweetness and light caramel backbone. Eureka... All in all, this is an easy drinking, refreshing brew that gets the job done when it comes to beating the heat during the dog days of summer in its native land of Texas--nothing more, nothing less..."
"D: Being on the lighter side this does bump up the drinkability. A brew I would not seek out, but not turn away."
"This is a refreshing boch that's especially good in warm weather."
"Drinkability: An okay lager that is certainly not a bock."
"M/D: The body feels a bit light for the style and the carbonation is light. This beer is not very drinkable."
"M: Very light body with a short ending that lets feel a little bitterness of hops."
"Pours an amber colour with some head. Not a huge smell, sweet caramel. I think I'm missing the hops here, but I can't really notice any. I get sweet malt. There are no off flavours though either, so I don't want to say this tastes bad, it just is lacking. Carbonation and drinkability are fine though."
"It is easy to see how some who have higher expectations of a true bock would object to this stuff, but I reviewed it as a beer in general since I'm no authority about what a bock should be like."
"D- Considering it doesn't taste bad, drinkability is higher. Nothing to taste, so there's nothing to disgust you about this beer. In reality, I could drink this as a thirst quencher."
"Light in body making it easy to drink"
"Amber to brown in color. The small head falls into the beer with record speed. Faint initial smell reminds me of cooked celery and cabbage. Taste is very mild but non--offensive. Slight bready malt and not much else. Mouthfeel is fluid without much presence on the tongue and seems flat. For such a mild beer, I found it rather toilsome to drink. Probably best to just slug these out of the bottle. Overall, not impressed."
"More of a lager than a bock. Light alcohol presence and moderate body would make you well able to have plenty of these if you wanted to. Better than a BMC lager but not what I wanted."
"At most gatherings this beer is a usual suspect, they sell it in cans which is nice going to a river or lake since glass is not allowed at most places. Pairs well with heavy meals like barbeque, Tex-Mex, and in my opinion EVERYTHING"
"D: Quaffable, but nothing really interesting. Better than the BMCs of the world, but not by much."
"D - After taking a look and a whiff, I thought this beer may be underrated, unfortunately upon first sip this beer begins to fall apart... Seems to stray greatly from style guidelines and doesn't do so in a groundbreaking or memorable way... A struggle to finish one and something I would likely avoid in the future... Just a tad better then the traditional BMC offerings..."
"Pours a nice mahogany color, clean and clear, with a little bit of foam on top. Aromas of caramel, toasted malt and maybe some molasses? Easy drinking, nicely carbonated, with some caramel flavor, a little malt and maybe, way back, some hops. Nothing all that exciting, but drinkable and fairly enjoyable."
"Drinkability is relatively high. Although the flavor profile lacks dimension, it's not all bad and with low ABV it is quite sessionable. I would have no problems leaving this in the can and having an all day barbeque."
"overall NOT really what I can call a craft beer."
"D: It isn't difficult to drink this beer but the flavors taste a lot better while it is still cold."
"Pretty drinkable, can put down a sixer with no problems."
"Notes: I didn't find anything too spectacular about this beer. It was just okay and didn't seem to bring anything unique to the table. Overall it was an average bock and I don't think I would buy this one again."
"5. Goes down easy, very sessionable beer."
"Thin bodied with a slightly dry earthy hop presence that lingers throughout over a slightly toasty caramel malt backbone. Hints of toffee, caramel and a slight nuttiness but all of these characterisitcs are faint. It's a bit drier than I prefer and not very well balanced. Easy to drink but not something I would buy again."
"Poured quickly into a pint glass and got about 2 fingers of head which disappeared quickly. Color was a light, golden brown. Smells a little malty with a some nuts. Taste is malty, slightly nutty with a bitter finish, not much flavor. Mouthfeel is very thin with not much carbonation. You could drink a lot of these, as there isn't much to it, but I'd still take this over a Michelob Amber Bock."
"a bit pricey for the quality.... but drinkability is very high."
"Overall, not a bad beer just not a very flavorful Bock. If you are looking for something a little different from the big 3 give it a try, but if you are looking for a real Bock look elsewhere."
"D- this can do in a pinch. i dont think this one is brewed with beer advocates in mind. for being the most well known bock, it doesnt fit the style definition very well."
"Beer pours a clear deep amber color with a light head that fades quickly. The smell is of toasted grain and a bit sweet. The taste begins sort of sweet but finishes clean. It has a light feel with not much body but goes down smooth & easy. Good beer to drink for most any occasion. The alcohol content makes it a good session beer."
"Drinkability: Tasty. Not overly complex but certainly sessionable--especially on a warmer day. Could easily put back a six."
"Bought in Mt Vernon Washington for $1.99 a bomber. Worth the the money for what it is: a easy drinking lager that has more caramel notes than a BMC lager. Drank it ice cold and enjoyed the basic plain drinkability of this beer. Food friendly and a decent finish this beer is not some craft take on a bock but rather a regional beer that sits slightly above the BMC beers"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a touch of nuts. Taste is malty, bready, some caramel notes, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and decent beer."
"The taste is smooth however. Watery, some wet malt flavor. There is nothing special about this beer. Im sure it would be perfect for a baseball game in really hot weather, and so would many other things..."
"D - Drinks fine. A half step up from BMC, but just a half. Definitely had better."
"Kind of bleh in the mouth, oil-slick and rather stale."
"Very drinkable and very repeatable during a session of cards or talking."
"still, a very drinkable everyday brew. just not balanced. beats the hell out of the macros for sure. but my old go to brews like yuengling beat it up good."
"D - OK i guess. A notch above a typical macro."
"D - you could easily drink this all night, but with the low alcohol and very mild taste... I do not think that you would really want to."
"Won't drink it again, wish I hadn't drank it kind of a beer. Sorry."
"Refreshing brew with no bad flavors. I could drink several of these. This would make a good ""session beer."""
"nothing special in the least."
"Pours a very clear brown with a miniscule white bubbly head that leaves no real amount of lacing behind. The nose is caramel with a hint of molasses. The taste generally follows, though the caramel is weaker and the molasses has a good amount of water thrown in, making for a pretty bland bock-like taste. The body is quite light, with a low bit of carbonation (though a slight fizzy feel on the tongue) and a watery feel, making a decently drinkable brew, but the desire to do so really doesn't come through very much. Average at best."
"D - taste of a darker beer, but lightness allows for excellent drinkability.."
"This has a rich amber color and a bold taste. It can be poured very aggressively. I was lucky enough to go to the home of Spoetzl Brewery, San Antonio, with the Spartan Marching Band for the Alamo Bowl this last year and I got to have some there. It's always better in the city it was brewed in."
"Low abv for style, and inoffensive, but a rather thin, fizzy brew."
"At 4.4%, you may as well just be drinking coors light, because that's cheaper."
"Overall, not a terrible beer. If faced with a choice between Shiner or a BMC, I'd take the Shiner. I won't go out of my way to chase down Shiner Bock, but I will drink one from time to time, if only in the name of nostalgia."
"While it won't blow your socks off, Shiner Bock does get respect for being a viable option all those years before the craft movement took hold of the American brew scene. I will leave it at that."
"This is the usual on-tap dark beer at restaurants and bars around here. So I'm sure Ill end up having this again."
"RJT"
"pours a dark amber with a nice tan head. the head doesnt stick around for long tho, and leaves almost no lacing down the glass. Smells and tastes of all malt, with no noticeable hops. bearable, but very forgettable. has a ton of carbonation like a macro, buthas a heavier mouthfeel, a bit syrupy. that would be really nice if it was paried with a good flavor, but it's just not there."
"D: Doesn't go down that easily, and leaves an odd aftertaste. I would op for others of this style in the future."
"Overall, this beer is in about the same price range as the big three which makes it a good value. Its not something I would seek out or even drink often, but if you are in a pinch its a nice fall back."
"Will probably get this again some other time."
"d: i love this beer as an american macro classic; the labeling is so oldschool and classic; and i know that for a lot of peple in the southwest, were it not for this beer and michelob amber they would not even know that there were styles other than pilseners; as a bock it is only soso, but as a mainstream american beer/gateway beer for the unenlightened i give it a super high rating"
"D- Very drinkable at a price of a simple beer that is very macro-like."
"Easy to drink, not much going on. A step above macro lager."
"Mouthfeel is consistent throughout, doesn't fade or change, kinda drinkable, although the cost increase lately is getting prohibitive."
"Good for a hot day to refresh yourself. Don't let the ""bock"" fool you though. There is nothing strong about this beer. Barely stronger than a lager. Just more flavor."
"I definately think freshness makes a difference here. I have had at a restraunt like Love and War in Texas, where you know they empty at least keg of Shiner every day. And the drinkablity is killer. Then go to Applebees or something and the taste is different."
"Poured a deep, clear amber with good carbonation and small dirty white head. Nose is dry, weak, grains and thats about it. Taste is grain, hardly any booze, some citrus and maybe caramel. Body and mouthfeel is pretty thin. Not a bock I would go to again."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Dark amber color with no head. Carmel, sugar, grain, corn, astringent tastes. A small amount of caramel and sugar tastes, some maple syrup. Slick mouth feel, like syrup on pancakes but not quite as sweet. Drinkable nature is okay."
"D: Fairly easy todrink. Would be more so without the sweetness."
"Overall - an OK beer, nothing special. If I want a sessionable bock, I'll go with SA Winter Lager."
"Drinkabilty- It pairs well with a variety of situations and food. Its been my go to for many occasions when I need to bring a six pack to share."
"Drinkability: With the odd sweet/sour flavors and low ABV, this isn't really what I would consider a true Bock style beer at all. I know Bock's and like Bock's, and you Shiner are no Bock beer. More like a weak and watery American Amber or Nut Brown than a Bock. Not going to seek this one out again."
"(Bottle into a dimpled mug) Poured a dark amber with one finger white head that dissipated very quickly. The nose was of a nutty caramel/molasses sweetness with a tiny hint of the yeast. Nothing too obtrusive, however. Lively carbonation in the mouth, and the drink itself was very smooth. The slight sweetness of the malts came forward as expected, but surprisingly there was very little bite at the end, which I have encountered in other examples of this style. A nice average offering and very drinkable -- I would think a nice hoagie would work nice here."
"I love Shiner Bock. It's great on draft or straight from the bottle. It has a very dark color, which is surprising because it doesn't taste like a dark beer at all. It isn't very heavy and doesn't have a very strong taste. An ice cold mug of Shiner Bock can be very refreshing."
"Overall, an ok macroish ""bock"" Really more like an all malt lager with some food coloring, but certainly a step up from drinking macro junk. Good for what it is."
"This is a very drinkable beer. What it lacks in mouth feel, it makes up in taste. Far from complex, but far from swill."
"Mouth is watery, but bold. This is a beer that I can, and will, drink all day. After trying so many new and interesting beers, the novelty from Shiner has worn off. Still a good beer and I will continue to drink it, but I know I'll keep trying others."
"Buy again? Maybe with others, but not for myself."
"had it on tap and it was substantially worse. do avoid that."
"i have had shiner bock in a glass, on tap, and a can. it is all great."
"D: Too watery to be bock style, the good thing was that i taked me away the horrible taste of the spinachs i was eating, acceptable beer, i have tasted worst beers from Texas."
"Notes: decent bock but not enough alcohol and the adjunct flavor is disappointing. still a decent beer to go for if you want a dark, flavorful lager"
"D- Very easy to drink, this has been available in my area for years so it was my go to at bars when they didnt have anything else."
"Notes: This beer holds a soft spot in my heart. Having played in bar bands for several years where i live its very hard to find a beer that isnt one of the typical american light beers. As a young man this is the beer that would sit well in my gut and not make me feel like i was full of light-watery, stale foam. Darker, richer and far more flavor than the average bar beer around here. Thank you for countless nights of beer induced loud live music shiner bock."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, this isn't a bad beer, nothing I would seek out, but don't mind putting a couple away."
"D - not a bad swill. could sit down for a session of these."
"Very nice brew...nice color, no nasty aftertaste. When you consider the price of this Texas brew with a comp from Europe it's a great value for bock drinkers. Impossible to find in the Western NY area I'm from, so I bring it back from beer stores in Erie, PA. I've never had a complainy when I serve this bock."
"Conclusion: It's better than Michelob Amber Bock, which is the only other bock I see non-craft people imbibing regularly. Maybe that's a bit harsh, to compare those two beers because this is significantly better than the AB. This is drinkable, and would be a great beer to introduce your macro-buddies to craft beer, but other than that, I probably wouldn't pick it up; overall, not up to the hype."
"Obviously, nothing like an actual Bock, but more like an American dark lager. Not bad, especially when compared to the major light lagers, but certainly not spectacular."
"I had this in Oklahoma at the airport. The dudes at the bar raved about it. So, I picked up a mixed sixer and sat down to review. The golden appearance and medium, quickly dissipating head was not so bad for a semi-mainstream brew. I love the sweet malt taste of this for some reason, perhaps a bit too much. Mouthfeel was medium and ShinerBock was easily drinkable. Nice."
"Overall a non offensive beer I could drink all day if that's my only option. I hope my friends in Texas have found a new drink for my next visit."
"Not a bad beer. I think this beer is definitely under-rated. The head isn't anything special; however, it does have a nice color. This beer is great for sessions. In some places you can find it in cans. It tastes good and it's easy to drink. I consider it one of my favorites."
"The taste is light nothing special. It has a pretty heavy mouthfeel but there is a weird after taste that makes it hard to drink more than a couple."
"D- I had to knock the drinkability down half a point for the sweetness this beer has. That would be the only thing stopping me from drinking a lot of this. A lower ABV makes this a good session beer but the sweetness limits it's session like qualties for me at least."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty good beer. I don't think it's a true bock and it certainly doesn't taste like one. That said, it's still a great beer and one I'm sure I'll turn to again."
"D- A very drinkable session style beer, lower on the ABV by about 2 points than is normal for a bock style beer. My girlfriend loves this one, so we often have part of a sixer in the house. I definitely see this beer as a macro style beer, and doesn't really fit into the Bock Style, but still a decent offering, and pays homage to the tradition of an old school Texas brewery."
"Drink a very easy drinking beer. Not bad at all. Not great but I wouldn't pass one up. Nothing I'd buy again."
"If they called this Shiner amber lager, I'd score it better. This isn't bad beer, but calling it a bock is definately misleading. Its attractive, light brown, and drinkable. But apparently the malt flavor, backbone of a bock, had one too many at the bar and forgot to get on the bus. This is just too flavorless for a bock."
"D - excellent session beer. not to heavy on flavor or body, but enough to put 'em down like a champ."
"Overall very average andd the fact that this runs 30% more than the ""average economy"" brew means that is unlikely I'll be buying this."
"This poured a clear mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like sour yeast and burnt barley with some lemon and copper hops and a bit of caramel and bread crust. It tasted like roasted barley and copper hops with some lemon and crust and sour yeast. It was thin and very carbonated, with a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was fairly clean with a moderately enjoyable taste, but was generally not an appetizing beer. The body was poor, although it was bland enough to still be reasonably easy to drink. Better than some macros, but not as good as most craft beers. Not recommended."
"Drinkability: Good, refreshing, pleasant to drink, but not particularly interesting."
"D - Average. It's light, but the beer is slightly sub-par overall."
"It's drinkable enough - low ABV and mild taste. But you'll get bored of it quickly."
"Drinkability: pretty drinkable in my book, but the relatively light and monotonous flavor hold it back a little."
"D - Besides the muted nose and watered downess...this beer is pretty drinkable...it's not too heavy and the caramel flavors are nice...now it wouldn't be my go-to-beer...but I could have two or three of these"
"I put 3 of these away the other night in the course of cooking a meal. They don't exactly stick with you, not memorable but easy and enjoyable enough to drink."
"Reddish brown, a little bit of head which dissipated quickly, no lacing. Was not much there in the smell department, couldn't pick up anything noticeable. Just a tiny bit of malt in the taste, no hops, nothing spectacular but, nothing off tasting. Low carbonation, a little fizzy but it is easy to drink, however with not much taste I probably would not drink too many. I am glad I did not have to buy it."
"I'd seen signs and bottles and packs of this all around since moving to Arkansas. I am very disappointed. The beer just doesn't have any redeeming qualities and seems to be a lacking, slightly sweet commercial lager."
"I miss having this on tap back in the early 90's in Austin. We used to go to the Hole in the Wall and get it. Then to the Black Cat for PBR in a can and catch a show at Emo's. Sadly, this is not the beer I remember it being back then. It is thin and flavorless, a disappointment. I have been putting this review off for years, hoping that Spoetzl would return to the Shiner of yore, but alas."
"Clear bodied amber beer. Looks like a lighter version than most. Plenty of white fizzy head. Looks to be well carbonated. Aromas are slight bit of malt and not much else. The whole metallic thing is present along with a slight amount of caramel malt in there. Flavor fades to not much of anything. Light bodied and not a whole lot in the mouthfeel department either."
"D: Very drinkable, not much on the flavors or heaviness so drinking a few of these would be no problem."
"D: I try to support Texas breweries and Spoetzl but the Bock is probably my least favorite of their main offerings."
"This beer deserves the rating it gets. It is nothing special, and honestly an awful representation of the style."
"On-tap at Penguin Ed's in Fayetteville, AR. Man, I was expecting something resembling a bock, but the closest this gets is maybe Michelob Amber Bock. There's a distinct, corny adjunct tang in the background with only light caramel roll malts. It wasn't bad for washing down my pulled pork and potato salad, but I won't waste my time or liver on this brew again. Not terribly offensive, I guess, but not worth trying either."
"overall, drinkable beer, not great not bad. would go out of my way to get it."
"They have this beer virtually everywhere here in Houston, so if nothing else, it's better than the typical domestic swill (Bud, Bud LT)"
"You could easily session this beer. Unfortunately, I'll be constantly searching for something with more flavor."
"D: Pretty disappointing experience, I had a feeling it was going to be bad when I saw no head (it wasn't just the bar either as I got a Sweetwater with a perfect head). A pretty poor testemant to Shiner, my second bad brew from them after their Hefeweizen. Try at your own risk."
"Drinkability: It's not bad. But it's not something I'm jacked about getting again."
"From a bottle pours a fairly dark amber colour with a small white head that dissapated to a thin ring fairly quickly. Smells slightly sweet mostly of caramel and malt. Taste is on the light side almost watered down, but crisp and refreshing. This beer would be good on a hot summer day but nothing I would go out of my way to drink."
"Drinkability - this beer in my opinion goes well with a meal or a snack, and maybe by itself on a hot day (although I think Shiner Kolsch, now discontinued, was king in that category) but I think alone it can't stand. It's very weak for a bock, but it's still a good beer. I like Shiner's line-up and the first time I had this long ago it was quickly one of my favorites. Now with time either my taste buds have changed and I'm moving onto new flavors or the brew has changed a tad. I'm thinking the former. Still, well worth having from time to time with a good meal where you don't want the beer drowning out the flavors of the food."
"Pours a dark amber, crystal clear, a little bit of a coarse head that hangs around for a short while. Nothing overly impressive in the aroma or taste, a little sweet, a slight corn-flavor, a little toasty with some floral hops. Thin body, but overall pretty refreshing and very easy drinking on a day that topped out well over 100 degrees..."
"Beach/Shore: Yes, but not my first choice. I was underwhelmed by the total sum of this beer."
"i imagine if i wanted to drink dark beer on a sweltering day this would be the compromise."
"If you like a good bock, stay away from this one."
"Pours an amber like color with a slightly off color head. The smell is of malt and some hops at the back end but the smell is faint. The taste is of sweet malt and some slightly bitter earthy hops on the back end. Very smooth taste but not very complex. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and slightly dry. Overall it is a solid beer but not spectacular you could drink a good amount but it would get old after a while."
"drinkability- very drinkable, had many times before with few problems. its not the best, but its shiner. it'll do. would like to try on tap closer to its home in texas."
"The key now is to try one again now that I'm home...maybe I got a bad batch the first time around?"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Poured a deep copper body with a thin white head that faded quickly. Aroma of caramel, metallic copper and toffee. Medium bodied with a biscuity light malt flavor and sweet aftertaste that finished clean. Good drinkability, this is nothing to seek out, but a great alternative if you find it at a bar stocked with macros."
"Taste: Little bit of caramel, little bit of floral hops. Fairly clean and refreshing. Kind of a dry finish to it."
"You won't find ""complex flavorings from exotic malts and yeasts"" with this beer. Don't expect them."
"lightish body. enough carbonation present. this is a decent beer. i may try again."
"Drinkability: While nothing is really making this beer stand out, it's not as if it's a terrible tasting drink and the body isn't heavy, so I do feel that I could drink sevefal of these if necessary or if it was all that was being offered."
"Much better appearance than I expected, but it is a bock. Nice amber hue. Smell of melt, sugar, bit of hops, spices. Pretty standard malty bock with a slight hoppiness. Nice example for being more ""main-stream"" in my opinion. Very drinkable and feels good in the mouth."
"= could be a decent beer if it weren't for the metallic taste"
"Overall, an easy drinker but not bad."
"D: Very easy to drink, since it's kind of a watered down bock."
"Notes - Good ol' Shiner Bock was my introduction to the beer world, and for that I owe it some props. Tastes just like I remember it, too. It's not nearly strong enough to really be a bock, more like an amber lager. It's mainly for people who aren't beer geeks, but who want something better than BMC, for a cheap price."
"D: Sweet and watery sums it up; drinkable in large quantities, yes. Would I want to? Probably not."
"So I drank one of these where there wasnt much choice. Medium yellow, moderate head. Smells of corn and macro. tastes of sweet corn macro. Basically like Bud. As it warms up, it gets somewhat worse. Carbonation was fine. Just not much flavor. Light enough to drink, but I'd prefer something more complex."
"Closest thing I have had to an adjunct Bock. Nothing Spectacular, but would accept if offered."
"Poured a pretty coppery color with a fairly large head that disippated quickly. Not much lacing. Really pretty color though. There was virtually no scent at all. What there was was grain and malt. The taste was about like the smell... grain and malt, and fairly weak. A rather watery mouthfeel. Not much complexity. Drinkable though. It's a nice one if you're really thirsty and just want something to quench your thirst. Honestly, it's not something I'd go out of my way to get, but it certainly beats the macros. Also, you really can't beat the price for something that's better than the macros, yet easy on the budget, and a low alcohol besides. I picked up a six pack for $5.99."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep honey brown color with a slight red tinge. The head is almost non-existent barring a thin rim of carbonation and bubbles rising to the top. The smell is not overwhelming but is of sweet grainy malt, slightly buttery and bready. The flavor is similar, rather one dimensional sweetness that doesn't really ever go anywhere. The mouthfeel is definitely on the light side for a bock beer. The carbonation is thin and burns the mouth. Drinkability of this is decent, goes down like water and for the price is better than most BMC beers. The low ABV for the style also makes it more drinkable (but less desirable in my opinion)."
"Pours a clear brown with practically no head. Just a thin line of bubbles on top of the beer. Smells like honey roasted malts with a little bit of earthy hop. A sweet toasted malt flavor with a little bit of earthy hop. Pretty good. However, there is a slight tang to it. Mouthfeel is ok, carbonation adds a little spice to the beer. Drinkability is ok."
"D - Probably the best part of this beer is it's drinkability. Since it isn't a typical bock, its certainly easy to drink but it's really just a watered down bock with adjuncts."
"This particular review was conducted with a Shiner Bock that was brewed during the 100th Anniversery of the Spoetzl Brewery. For the most part, it's quite good. However, it seems fairly light for a dark lager in terms of both color and mouthfeel. It's definately on the sweeter side (as would be expected for the style), but I'm not sure how I feel about the overall presentation. From my previous experiences, it is definately far better on-tap. Try a few of these if you're out for a night on the town."
"Drinkability was high as this was a pleasant beer albeit a little weak. It did not fade like a lot of weaker lagers. Overall an okay beer, not one I would repeat unless I had too but it is alroght. In florida it is a lot higher than a lot of states."
"Pours a dark red-brown with practically no foam at all. It looks flat, although it's not. Not much smell to speak of. Flavor's great though - lots and lots of malt, a little bit of hop kick, not much carbonation but a flavor that sticks with you for a while. This one threads the needle for me between a light American lager and a darker, more intense brew. It's not spectacular, but I feel like it would be hard to find an occasion or food pairing for which this would be a bad beer."
"I'm just glad this was a left over from a party and i never paid for this so called Bock. I suggest sending this back to Texas."
"D= Nothing to write home about, but not one I had to choke down either. It's good in a pinch though!"
"D: I can say one thing, I drank this beer fast. It goes down quite easy, the problem, you forget you actually drank it."
"D: This was really an average beer. Nothing really stands out other than the lack of flavor. A good choice for a light beer drinker who wants to have a ""pretend"" dark beer. If I was in the same situation I was before and everything else was a light, mass produced lager, I would pick this again. Otherwise, I will go with something else."
"Had in a bottle with barbeque. Mild toasty malt flavor quickly washed away with some hops. Dry finish. Nothing really stands out, but nothing offends either. Really good for having with barbeque or to drink multiple pitchers of. Bars in Texas tend to sell this pretty cheap, so thats always good."
"D - This is the beer that I get when I'm at a non beer bar its better tasting than your macros but not as good as the local craft beers its the beer to drink when you don't want a fizzy yellow beer"
"This is a beer that is worse than the score. The sum of the components ought to be subtraction. I'll say it again. Bud Dark. Calling this a bock is a crime."
"Head retention turns out to be excellent as is the lacing."
"Has a little bit of a butterscotch taste similar to Newcastle Brown Ale. It's pretty good beer it is easy to polish off a 12pack without even trying. Goes down good. Very satisfying beer taste. It's affordable, too, at least here in Texas, you can buy 12 for 10.99 at your local grocery store."
"great because you can slowly enjoy the first few and continue to pound them all night"
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, some pale malt, and maybe some slight sweet malt. Wow, the aroma is decidedly lacking. I guess it fits the style of a Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast cleanliness up front, then some pale malt comes through, the slightest hop is noticeable only very quickly, and the finish is a hint of earthy malt. Overall, this brew is a little watery. I remember this brew being much better than this, oh well. This is not really worth a try. On the plus side it does get better as you go along."
"It poured redish in color and did not have a memorable smell, it was a bit carmaly in taste and decent beer, I used to drink it exclusevly but overall this one is a pretty good go to beer, never dissapointed in it, would love to drink this one a little more as far as a good go to beer. pretty easy going beer, not will always go with this one."
"I'd seen a fair bit of criticism leveled at this beer, so being the skeptic that I am, I went in and really tried to like this beer. However, I just couldn't bring myself to do so. It's not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, it's just a lot shallower than I like my bocks to be. May be good for someone looking to get away from inferior beers, but I won't be purchasing this for myself again."
"Not like any other bock I've had, it's like a poor macro version of a bock. I don't know what all of the hype is about."
"mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated to the point that it makes me feel gassy. I could drink a few at a BBq but just to have one for the hell of it, no way."
"overall I was a little bummed on this one, had heard a lot about Shiner in Texas but was let down"
"D- Not bad, but there are better bocks out there."
"give this beer more depth, body, and overall bock character and it's on its way to a good bock."
"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass. Deep copper color with a large but rapidly diminishing off-white head. Aroma is adjuncts, bready malts, and metal. Flavor is bready and semisweet. No hops, no complexity. Very simplistic , but tasty enough. Medium-thin body with nice carbonation. Tastes more like a Munich lager than a bock. Definitely not robust enough to claim the bock style. Very easy to drink."
"D- A step up from BMC but disappointing after trying the Anchor bock."
"Pours a brown-red colored body, pretty clearish looking, with nearly no head, off-white in color. Has a nutty, maybe fruity, or grainy? aroma. Effervescent. Has a pretty weak taste. Some nuttiness, with a watery palate. Not much flavor here."
"Overall, a fair beer that is just a tad better than a BMC. When I moved to Texas 16 years ago, I feel in love with this beer. This was the beer that got me beyond BMC's and eventually on to even better beers. I have definitely moved past this one over the years though. Also, I swear (and several forum posts claim it as well) that it tastes different than it did a decade ago. Shiner says it's the same but it doesn't taste the same. I also find the quality to be wildly erratic. Don't recommend unless you are just now leaving the BMC's. For me, I have the rare one for nostalgia."
"This one is pretty average."
"In a world of blind men, a one-eyed man is king. In a bar with only American adjunct lagers and light lagers, this beer is king. Fortunately Maggie's had GI Honkers Ale and 312, Guinness, Magic Hat No. 9, and a few other craft brews, so a single pint of Shiner Bock for the record was enough for the night, and I enjoyed far more worthy quaffs from then on."
"Really comes down to a warm weather brew. Not a lot to speak of in the flavour department, but could be refreshing in the Texan heat."
"Drinkability: If it wasn't almost 90 degrees out there and I'm doing yard work, I would not drink it, but lets face it, it is better than H2O."
"This beer is a victim of circumstance. Having had numerous bocks before reviewing Shiner, it simply doesn't compare in smell, drinkability or most importantly, taste. It's not a bad beer, slighty bland for a bock. However, it does smell decent as some sweet malty scents do escape upon pouring. Taste, as I said is a bit bland, some richness comes through but not much. Chalk it up as ""you get what you pay for""."
"Shiner was my ""gateway"" beer into this BA world. But since I've widened my variety in beer in the last year, it's caused me to think very little of this beer. I seriously don't know how I ever liked this."
"D: This is not recommended. The only purpose a beer like this serves is to be that baby step for people who think that anything that comes in a bottle is fancy, high-end stuff. Very over-hyped for such a mediocre beer."
"This is an OK beer when you're at a bar with few choices, but almost everywhere has Sam Adams or Blue Moon & those are both much better choices than this."
"A pitiful excuse for a Bock. I suppose it might be a good one for the BMC crowd as it has pretty much no flavor but is ghastly dark in color..."
"Poured into 12oz glass. Poured a clear deep amber color with about an inch of slightly off-white head that left no lacing. Basic semi-sweet malt aroma. A fundamentally solid flavor with no outstanding characteristics, light on the tongue with a slight tang on the finish. Typical light body. Very good drinkability, but most Bocks do. An average example of the style, try one if you see it, or if you're stuck someplace with fizzy yellow beers and this, you will be happy with Shiner Bock."
"Overall, not bad. Had it on tap as the guest-brew at the Brewerie in Erie, PA. An easy ""crowd pleaser."" Good with a meal, or to session. Very well rounded. But nothing too intense in either direction good or bad. Average brew. I'd take another one if offered for sure."
"Clear, dark amber with a fizzy white head that quickly settles into a thin collar. Light toasted grain with an herbal kind of quality in the nose. Tastes mild and well balanced between light biscuit malt and hop bitterness. Light seltzery mouthfeel. Squeaky clean and easy drinking, decent session beer."
"This beer pours a perfectly clear medium golden brown, with a few fingers of off white head, that falls away very quickly, leaving no lacing. The smell is malt - grainy, spicy, a bit of rye. The taste is very light - a bready, biscuity malt, and a slight floral essence. The carbonation is prickly at first, but mellows out, making this fairly smooth. The body is quite thin, the taste inoffensive, kind of bland, but I could see having a few rounds of this, given no better options."
"D - I think the only way I would drink this beer again is if it were free and there were no other beer available. Reminds me of cheap yellow beer masquerading as dark beer."
"There is very little to taste here, maybe a few hints of toasty malts and a bit of graininess. Mouthfeel is very thin and watery. It's ok, but far from Spoetzl's best offering, unfortunately is it the most widely distributed. It does go down easy and preferable over a BMC, but it is hard to rate this very high as a bock."
"But at least it goes down easy. I guess that's something."
"Bottom line, it is a good Beer, but not a great Beer."
"This is an easy to drink dark beer. It's a good introduction to dark beer for novices. Good, malty taste and lightly hopped. Better for my money than Michelob Amber Bock for this style (American Bock Beer). Slightly sweet taste but not cloying. Good lighter American Style Bock Beer. Mouthfeel decent. Overall, a B minus here. A gateway to better things. Very good session beer. I like it but it's too expensive in East Tennessee ($7 a six pack)."
"On my old list just of what I tried, I have this marked as ""good."" I don't know what I was thinking."
"Not much punch so I am sure I could have a few,"
" I might buy it again if I want to introduce someone to the quirkiness of ""Death Proof"" on dvd, or I might try it on tap if I'm ever again in Texas, and I wouldn't turn down a freebie. Otherwise, I'm unlikely to visit this brew again."
"D - i will never ever drink this again."
"drinkability: very very easy and smooth. A decent session beer and goos transfer beer. But overall averga efor beer adovcates. not much better than amberbock"
"In sum, I'm never gonna buy it at the liquor store when there are better options, but it's a great quality brew and in Texas it's somewhat of a savior when your out for pizza."
"I picked this up at the local HI-LO on the westside in hopes that it might remind me of warm spring days. After shoveling 10 inches of snow and ice off my driveway I can say this Bock did not let me down. It is malty, very drinkable and refreshing. Is it a heavy-hitter all time great? Not really. It is a bit watery with no head retention. Please please groundhog, dont see your shadow. Spring cannot get here soon enough."
"Atmosphere leaves a little to be desired, but flavor and feel are okay making for good drinkability. Decent quaff."
"Not much more to add that 500+ people haven't said before...Poured a medium and clear amber color with a larger sized off white head. Aromas of some earthiness, roasted caramel, and nuts. Tastes of the same but thinner and somewhat watery. Body was thin and watery as well."
"D: Being from Texas this was a staple for me, like others, for many years. I hold this beer close to my heart so for that reason it will always be a winner. From a straight beer perspective there is nothing particularly special about this. I still think it is a pretty solid delivery and I was glad to see it has made it as far up as WA state (kudos to Spoetzl Brewery). Great for a long session."
"I love bocks so I was excited to try Shiners. The beer poured a very clear brown with accents of redish orange. Very weak head for a bock with very active carbonation. The smell was dissapointing as it didnt smell like much at all. Some faint aromas of oat, malt, and some sweetness. The taste was better than the smell and apearance. The taste was malty and with some sweetness of molasses or caramel. The mouthfeel was crisp but at the expense of much carbonation. Shiner Bock is easy to drink because it is watered down compared to other bocks. All in all I would probably pass on this if I saw it again."
"cant say much more than that. not any obvious flaws that i can pick up, but nothing coming right out and saying ""drink me again""."
"Drinkability: A plain, dull lager, but when you throw in that metallic mouthful of nickels and pennies, you've totally lost me."
"This is always a crowd pleaser. Not the best beer you can find on the shelves, but has a good appeal to the general public. Always a safe bet."
"overall pleasant."
"D = An easy drinking beer, but might become cloying after a couple. Still better than a lot of offerings, so really depends on what else is available."
"Pours clear brown colour with off-white head which dissapeared almost immediately. Smell - not too much here, malty with some medicine-like notes. Taste - malts mostly with some toasted sugar perhaps. Watery, very light, nice level of carbonation. It's drinkable as it very light, but really, it's net that good of a beer. It's not awful, but with so many options over there.."
"D: It's always in my fridge. A decent session beer."
"D-If anything, it was drinkable, just like mineral water is drinkable."
"...I'm let down by my own analysis. I guess I really never gave this beer a good going over...:("
"Miller Lite with food coloring. Clear tan. Tan, fizzy small head. Corny aroma, some hints of malt, and metal. Shiner and their metal. I wonder what the taste has in store for me. Corn, corn syrup, brown sugar, and metal. How is this a bock beer? I remember a friend from Texas touting this ""great"" beer. I should have remembered he loved Lone Star, too."
"D: This runs at a relatively premium price but offers little in the way of complexity. I'd probably downgrade to a cheaper beer if I just wanted something to drink or upgrade to a better one if I wanted something to enjoy. Not a very good balance."
"D- Something you can drink regularly and frequently over the course of a night."
"NOTE: i should also add that shiner offers other brews that are much better than this...in other words don't totally throw out the brewery itself."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but also not that great."
"First off, this isn't a true bock. I don't know if it's a requirement to be from Texas to like this beer, but I just can't see why everybody gets so into it. Average aroma. Decent pour, not very much head, not very much lace. Taste is malty, a little bit sweet, but is killed by being too watery. Very light bodied. Overall not a terrible beer, but in the battle of fake bocks, Michelob's Amber Bock is actually more enjoyable. I have no desire to ever try this again."
"Slainte."
"2.5 D: If this cost as much as a cheap macro, I'd buy it to get drunk off of. This definitely isn't a dinner beer or a relaxation beer."
"Pours a thin-looking, medium brown with hardly any head and appears pretty lowly-carbonated. Smells of a solid malt. The taste is a solid malt but nothing special, perhaps a little weak compared to other bocks I've had. It's got a nice little matly aftertaste as well that lingers a bit. I don't mean to knock it too bad--it's a solid brew for a macro. It's got some body and it's got some flavor and isn't too sour. It's nothing special but it's not horrible."
"Shiner Bock is one piss-poor excuse for a craft bock. Amber Bock trumps this any day of the week despite being wholly average. No wonder I can't sell this shit."
"D- Shiner Bock isn't terrible but at the same time isn't something I would purchase again."
"But in no way is this ""good"""
"Beer has a good body , lighter than most other bocks but still enjoyable"
"Nothing special about this beer really. Sort of a golden amber color, a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no trace of lacing whatsoever. Smell is somewhat malty and grainy. Taste is nearly the same. Very thin mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable though just because it seems so light. Not a recommendation."
"Mouthfeel is thin, and there is an initial tang that isn't very recognizable. Definitely a do not buy."
"This was my first ""real"" beer, I would recommend it as a ""gateway"" beer for beginners to ""real"" beer, if nothing else."
"This one is growing on me."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a light chesnut color with a thin white head. There is not much that I can smell, just a hint of malt. The taste and mouthfeel is too thin. The up front flavor is slightly sweet, perhaps a hint of raisin, but it fades quickly. All this being said, it is an easy drinking beer. If you are in search of this style, Shiner is not a great example."
"Drinkability is good, it's not an exciting, but highly swillable bock. Which isn't something I'm particularly looking for, but I'm sure it has it's place. Oh yeah, Texas."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a nice amber color, but with very little head. Smell of a bock(sort of) with a hint of adjunct. This is a smooth brew and does go down pretty good, but if you're looking for an original bock taste, you will be a little dissapointed. I have had many different varieties of bocks and was excited to see a cheap one, but it was kind of obvious why it is cheap. Michelob Amberbock is actually a better bock and has a little more alcohol I believe(since a bock should have at least 5%) Not a bad brew, but not something that I would tell you to go out and get now, because you are missing something."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but also not that great. Expecting more from this style, and this tastes no different than a Vienna Lager. Would have again if offered and nothing else available."
"D: On the whole, a very uninteresting beer. It doesn't dare to be anything but mediocre."
"drinkability - Easy drinking, nothing special, decent beer."
"M/D - A little thin on the feel. Goes down crisp and clean though. Very drinkable."
"Overall, an American lager, but a smart pick."
" ~ For a Bock this brew has very subtle characteristics all around. However, this beer will make for a nice session brew because,even though it is a Bock, it doesn't overwhelm."
"Considering where I was, this was easily the best choice going on. A decent beer to drink in the sweltering heat, but I'd rather reach for other bocks or beers."
"Probably better on tap."
"Texas strikes again! This classic was a clear amber color out of the bottle but the white head was shorter lived than Billy Blanks career (who?). No lacing either. The aroma was very clean, almost to the point of being non-existent! Grains and dry husk. The flavors were thankfully better defined. Some malt and malted sweetness along with hints of astringent hops that nip at the palate a little. Nothing bold but very crisp and quite refreshing. Very light body with a fizzy carbonation much like beer flavored seltzer water. Good summer beer and sessionable even if not inspired."
"Overall: tried it."
"Old-school BLOC Bock, deep in the heart of Texas. The idea is backwards, but has spirit. This is a decent beer. worth the effort. Buy it and you won't be disappointed in the flavor, just don't expect anything too fantastic. Its $8-10 per 6-pack I recall. Not worth it. The Shiner black is better."
"The beer poured from the bottle a deep amber color with wispy foam above it. The aroma is caramel and molasses, it makes me think sweetness lies ahead. Fairly carbonated on the palate. The flavor isn't overly sweet, but rather like strange askew caramel topping over a slightly buttery biscuit. This beer could use some work in the flavor department and also a bit of balance would be desirable. I am glad I didn't buy a six pack."
"D'ability - smooth, but bland dark lager. Drinkable, but there are better options."
"Comes out of the tap a clear, appetizing mahogany, not much head. Aroma is malty with a fruity undertone - apple or pear. Flavor is mainly malty with a hint of fruit and touches of sweetness, hops, and nutty taste. Texture is smooth and fizzy like cola."
"Super-thin and watery, crisp, dry, and lame. An easy drinker, as it is virtually devoid of body or flavor that might otherwise taste like something and annoy the drinker."
"D: Not my favorite. OK as a session brew, but not something I'd pick over other offerings."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very mild kick, decent representation of style, this isn't a bad beer and is a decent alternative to your fizzy yellow beers. However, this beer doesn't have enough to it that will make me choose it over too many other craft beers."
"Drinkability - It's too bad I've discovered good beer, unfortunatley this is not one of them. BUT, if I was a rebel flag waving tattooed biker guy, I'd down a case of these and still not have a buzz. try again, Shiner."
"Poured to a nice head that disappated very fast. Not what I expected. Beer was more brownish than gold in color. No lacing at all. Smelled slightly sweet and thats about it. Had a very mild smell. Maybe a hint of caramel. Tasted a little on the sweet side. With a slightly bitter aftertaste. No flavors hung around. Felt very thin in the mouth almost watery. I thought the carbonation was a little excessive. I wanted to try the Spoetzl Brewery products and did. My first impression wasnt very good."
"While this Bock obviously underwhelms it isn't all that bad. I wonder if the brewers used even a single decoction mash. Traidtionally Bocks get thier color, malt profile, and flavor from a triple decoction mash and a very long boil. Shiner's Bock is typical what many brewers today brew. It isn't bad as far as beer goes, but for purists it has a ways to go."
"Cool label. Shiner Bock pours a brilliant translucent red/brown color, a very vocal white soda-like head forms and dissapears very quickly, lots of carbonation bubbles are stuck to the inside of the glass. Kind of boring. The nose gives notes of semi-sweet toasted malts and a subtle apple/cherry fruit aroma, also some caramel and chocolate as it warms. The Shiner Bock is very light in flavor initially, malts, nuts, chocolate and booze at first that basically show up and disappear as fast as its head did. There is a slight hop bite just before the finish But the aftertaste is slow, long and lingering of funky fruity malt and burnt chocolatey grain, not too great. Its light enough to drink easily."
"Lots of hype here about this beer finally making it to Michigan. Not sure what the big deal is? Pours a very bock-like light brown, not too dark. Trying to coax some aroma out of this by swirling around in the glass but not getting much. Basic malt/yeast beer smell. Lack of complex aromas indicates a basic beer with no exceptional ingredients or brewing processes happening. Flavor is sweet, light malts, light caramel, slightly more complex fruit flavor in the finish: sweet dark raisin with a twist of sour cherry. Wishing the beer was more crisp and clean as it would redeem it a bit, but I'm just not getting it. A beer this thin should be more refreshing."
"As the guy who recommended this was from Texas I thought he'd be recommending me a big , strong beer - not exactly. Poured a brownish-amber that left a large head and good lacings. A faint smell of hops on the nose left little to the smell. A medium-bodied brew that has some toasted/roasted malts and a sweetness that is a little syrupy like caramel. Goes down smooth with some biting hops, but for a bock it is not nearly strong enough to hang around with the big boys."
"I have never had a shiner before but I guess I might have expected a little more out of the bock than I was given. Everything about it was O.K. But thats about it. I mean I could definitley drink this again but if given an option I probably would not."
"This beer is lighter than most bocks I've had. Seems a bit thin and has little head. The odor reminds me of when I tried to make a bock style beer with a Mr. Beer kit... It didn't quite come out right. There's an overly sweet almost cidery smell. It certainly tastes better than my Mr. Beer attempt but by bock standards it falls quite short. It's a bit too pale and flavor-lacking. It seems closer to a dunkel style than a bock. It's kind of malty/sugary sweet with not very much hop bitterness at all. It's thin and not at all what I was expecting. Not bad beer, just not a good bock."
"Bottom line: Not a great beer, but a bargain. Widely available in Texas. Better alternative to macro-brews."
"Pours a dark maple syrup color with a puney little kakhi head that left no lacing as it rapidly vanished.This smells faintly of sweet honey wheat bread,lacking in much aromas at all.Some lightly toasted malts are mostly what I detect in this overall boaring brew,with not a bit of hops noticed.Slightly sweet,faint caramel and brown sugar.The body is light and fairly smoothe,carbonation is acceptable.Better than the last Shiner(Blonde),but it wont keep me coming back."
"D- The lighter style made it an easier drinker, but I was expecting a more full-flavored bock so there wasn't a whole lot made me want to drink more than one at a time."
"D - A staple beer in Texas which most people enjoy but I actually go for the Miller Lite now instead of Shiner if those are my choices."
"D- This is a very nice and simple beer that is better than run-of-the-mill. Would make a great session beer."
"So no, up here in the midwest, I probably won't have this again. But if I'm visiting Houston and the only other taps are Miller Lite and some Bud, hell yes, I'll take a couple pints of Shiner."
"I used to drink a lot of this stuff when I was in my infancy of getting into better beer, thinking it was one of the sweetest, heaviest things I'd had next to Guinness. I don't know much about bock beers, but this is little more than an American macro with an added toasted component."
"mouthfeel is crisply carbonated, balanced bitterness with sweet malts"
"D: Pour me another"
"Pours a good amber with traces of golden brown. A thin, fizzy head rises up and falls with steady carbonation. Smell is somewhat muted and of light grains and sweet caramel malt. Very light. Taste is pretty good and clean. Mild bitterness with flavors of caramel and a doughy biscuity bread. Good light mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and pretty refreshing. Smooth and easy enough to drink, just not much going on here. Not sure why I bought a single of this but I didn't hate it at all, so more power to it."
"Yeah, you could probably drink a few of these easily, but for $7.50 a six, why would you want to. There are plenty of actual bocks to be had for the price. On the bottle it says: ""Shiner Bock combines it's old-world, Bavarian heritage with the ingenuity of American Handcraft brewing.."" Which by that they mean ""We took a traditional celebratory German brew and turned into something that tastes like Bud."""
"D. Fairly smooth and goes down pretty easy. Maybe thats just because it was the first beer of the night.."
"i dont care if this beer isn't the best beer ever, its a classic in my land and this used to be my ""expensive classy"" beer back in the day before my ""real"" beer awakening."
"M + D: A little thin, but a reasonable dryness to finish, which is alright. It's certainly a sessionable drink, but probably not for my taste. I would certainly go elsewhere for a refreshing brew, even to use as ""lawnmower beer"""
"Pours a clear amber color with a head that dissipates rapidly. Decently carbonated. Very little aroma - some slight sweetness but not much going on. Tasted like it had a lot of adjunct grains - corn or rice - very bland. Light-bodied and not much of a malt backbone to it. Drinkability is okay but expected for something this bland."
"D: Since it tastes like a glass of water you can knock it down easily."
"D: We finished the keg, so I would say it is drinkable. It is nice change from any dominant macro that is for sure. Good attempt from a German brewery in Texas, but I prefer their Hefe."
"This is certainly not the greatest beer in the world, nor the greatest Bock. Hell, it might not even be a Bock. But still, I have a very warm place in my heart for Shiner Bock. It rescues me time and time again out in here the outback of American beer culture."
"What a great session beer. Pours with a dark mahogany color that belies its easy drinkability. The smell is a subtle maltiness with slight hops bitters. The taste is light, with malty sweetness perfectly balanced by the bitterness and carbonation. I could drink this one all night."
"D: This does not drink like a bock style beer. Seems to be more of a Brown ale. With a little tweaking would probably make a very good brown ale."
"Appearance was that of a glass of iced tea sans ice. Or maybe brown dishwater. No head whatsoever. Aroma? Very faint smell of grains. Flavor was weak malt and water, not necessarily in that order. Carbonation was stronger than expected, which seemed to give some semblance of body to an otherwise thin and lifeless brew, and I'll give it an extra half a point for drinkability simply because I actually had two...although I'm still not sure why I ordered the second one."
"Mouthfeel is light and thin. Just not very interesting. So far, I have yet to have a really good beer from Texas."
"D - Not half bad. Gentle and unassuming. Very quenching."
"This is a nice offering from Shiner."
"D: Easy to drink, maybe a step up from a macro-lager. Was hoping for more from a bock, but, the 2nd & 3rd went down great with BBQ ribs."
"I have revisited this in OCt.2012 and found it, if anything, even more unimpressive than before. I have tried some new Shiner beers and revisited ones from before in the recent weeks and, as before, find that Shiner/Spoetzl produces some good beer but that, ironically, this ""flagship"" beer of theirs is possibly their worst beer. I have downgraded the taste score from 2 to 1.5 - it is simply almost utterly tasteless with only a very fleeting hint of flavour that vanishes abruptly to dry nothingness. It does not taste bad; it simply has almost no character at all. I compare this to their Hefeweizen, which is great, and their Kosmos Reserve lager, which is really good."
"Drinkability is good, but wouldn't really want to drink a lot of these."
"This beer is extremely mediocre, although I feel like that's probably pretty well known on this site. You're probably all coming around here, reviewing it for the same reason I am - you stumbled on it. Amber color with a weak head and no lacing. Nose is mild, mostly malt and grain. Taste is likewise, maybe some other adjuncts in there as well. Feel is too thin, but not terrible. Overall, I had it not expecting much, and got what I expected."
"D- could take a whole case of these back with me. easy go to favorite from shiner (so far)"
"Mouthfeel is only average. There isn't much carbonation and its tastes kind of watered down and slightly synthetic. This blah-ness makes it a less drinkable beer in my book. I am initially intrigued by it only to be disappointed by the whole package."
"It pours a nice dark copper color and I will admit the keg taste better than the bottle. I am reviewing the draft because it has close to the same nose , but there is some spicyness to it from the keg. Somewhat of a bite. Its really good. For being ""a darker beer"" it goes done really well on a hot day."
"D- Easy to drink too many and still feel great"
"D - OK to drink, nothing really stood out other than the carbonation, not my bag"
"Compared to other macrobrews on tap in Texas, Shiner Bock takes the cake. (Of course, in the summer it's time for Shiner Hefeweizen.) Compared to other bocks, however, it lacks the depth to make the top tier."
"Pours a very clear, weak brown/copper color with almost no head and no lacing. There is really no scent, beyond an extremely slight maltiness. Taste is also weak, with a bit of maltiness, but that's about it. It does go down fairly smooth, but that's it's best attribute. It has almost no bock attributes at all."
"This ""bock"" is nothing like the real thing. Sort of like a PBR with caramel coloring. Actually gives bock a bad name."
"Quite unimpressive across the board, not offensive but not very beer like. I would definitely drink this vs. BMC and think it would make a great kegger beer, but decidedly weak within the style."
"This is one of my favorites,dark in color small nice head. Very nice sort of fruity hop smell. Taste is very Refreshing to me and calls for more then one! Nice smooth feel in your mouth no after taste. Easy to drink and enjoy it, a very mild favorful Bock with out any harshness. And at a nice price too."
"Drinkablity: Good flavor in such a light bodied brew."
"D: Easy enough to drink, but many better beers are around, and this is far from a bock. I think I actually prefer Michelob Amber Bock to this."
"D- I had high expectations from this beer, since I didn't know anything about it or it's brewery, but I was sadly dissapointed by a beer that doesn't taste much better from your typical macro."
"If I closed my eyes, I'd swear I was drinking a macro with a dash of dark malt. Too light to be considered a real bock and just enough weird flavor to steer you away if tasteless refreshment is on your mind; it's a lose-lose proposition."
"D - Does down easy, just wish there was more flavor."
"On reflection I think you get what you pay for and $ 1.99 was an OK price, although they have the balls to charge premium price for this stuff in a lot of bars."
"d - it's an easy beer to drink that is refreshing. It's nothing special flavor-wise that I would go out of my way to drink. I find I enjoy certain foods with lighter beers, and this fits the bill better than most of the big guys."
"It is a good beer. I enjoy the flavor and the smell greatly. I am a bit disappointed with the appearance. I will have to revisit this beverage in the future to ensure that I did not just have a bad bottle."
"I had this both on tap and in the bottle. It's pretty ubiquitous in Texas. The beer has zero, and I mean zero, head with no lacing. It looks tawny brown, sticky, and slightly watery. The smell was dextrin malt, cloying, not that enticing. The taste was quite metallic, malty, there is a not all that pleasant caramel taste perhaps a little diacetyl. The beer has little carbonation and is light bodied. I wouldn't have another."
"Overall, it's not bad tasting (much more flavor than I expected), but overbalanced on the sweet side. It's better than the macros."
"D: Goes down like water... wait was this water?"
"This is just such a light diet coke-like beverage. Very little appreciable taste or aroma make it a purely thirst-quenching, drunk-getting kinda beer. Yeah, I'd choose the lovable Shiner over some of the other big name lagers, but AB's ZiegenBock is a better choice (albeit not my top choice :-)."
"I would have another. It isn't offensive. I don't yearn for another, but if it is there, and I want a beer, and I don't mind wasting my carb/calorie intake on just anything this will be ok."
"The beer arrived with a very thin white head that disappeared very quickly. There really wasn't much of a smell to speak of. The taste had little real flavor, with a touch of malt and a whisper of hops in the background. It had a soft drink like carbonation and mouthfeel, but it was reasonably drinkable. I probably wouldn't get it again."
"I have had this on tap before and it is better out of the bottle. This beer though is fairly inconsistent. Every brew is very different."
"D - incredibly disappointing bock - this is a very faint and pale comparison to it's European roots - it's 'drinkable' but barely - very bland in nature"
"appearance is amber but kinda bland. Smell, not a whole lot a little caramel. taste not as watery as a macro but not a whole lot there. The drinkability is its high point, i it goes down easy on a warm texas day. I'd rather save a few bucks and have a budweiser on any occasion though, but i dont have a problem drinking an occasional shiner or two."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a glass. One finger head disappeared rather quickly. Dark amber color with the faint sweet smell of malt. Overall taste was about average to me, no overpowering taste, a little bit of a bite to the finish. Quite honestly, i was expecting a little bit more to it. I think this is one of those beers which as a local beer is a little different and kind of a novelty which goes national. Its really more of a ""mass market"" type beer than a craft brew. If I'm Texas I am checking this place out and drinking some local brew but I wouldnt seek it out at my local beer distributor."
"Smells of malt, caramel mostly with perhaps a tiny hint of hops. Pours a dark brown, clearish color with a bit of head. Carbonated well, with a fairly subdued taste at first, then a sweet, smooth malt finish. Fairly light bodied overall, easy to drink."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours an amber/brown color with about a half inch tan head. Head retention is low, lacing is OK. It smells like toasted malt and caramel. The aroma is light, but nice. Taste is similar to the aroma, although there's also a grainy taste too. As with the aroma, the taste is sweet and on the light side, but it's not bad at all. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with average carbonation and a dry finish. Drinkability is decent, I could drink this as a session beer if there wasn't anything better available. Overall it's an OK beer. It's not great, but certainly not awful either."
"not very bitter, can be a session beer on a warm day, not a hot day, a big difference in central texas."
"D - Definitely easy drinking and decent on its own. While not a big fan, easy to see why it is mass produced now."
"I dont think that I would really buy this one again as there are plenty of other great beers out there to try. Not exactly my favorite style of beer."
"I just didn't enjoy this one. There are some who will probably really like this beer. I'm just not one of them"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Boulevard Pint glass. Poured a ruby amber with a decent head that disappeared quickly and left no lacing. Aroma is sweet, toffee and caramel. Taste is sweet to start with a grainy finish. Mouthfeel is very thin with a active carbonation. A very easily sessionable beer."
"Clear amber orange with a modest head and minimal lacing. Aroma is very light kind of a toasty grain with a faint hop aroma. Taste is about like Michelob Amber Bock; not great and not bad. It is worth drinking in establishments that have great food but limited beer selections. Although around here those kinds of places also have something from Great Lakes and everything from GL is better than this."
"Pours a very dark ruby with good head with lots of lacing on the way down. Nose is yeasty with a slight sweet tone. Flavor is bordering on wooden with a metallic aftertaste and a slight bitter tone. Feel is pretty good, just slightly above average - no doubt due to the fact it is off the tap. This is worse than I remember it being on bottles (though the bottle did get a lower score) and wouldn't have gone for it if there were better choices in the crappy airport bar I was in."
"Overall, a great tailgate beer, and certainly better than the xxLight usually available. Shiner Amber Lager would be a better name for this beer, but then they wouldn't be able to put the billy goat on the label..."
"D: Not a good bock. It is drinkable but why do it."
"This is something to appeal to the BMC crowd in Texas, and very popular in its home state. I think the people at Spoetzl dumbed this down intentionally. They can make some good beers, see Shiner 96, 97, 98 for proof."
"Pours a dark brown with a small, off white head. Smells faintly of grain. Taste is rather sweet, with a bit of toasty grain flavor. Slight presence of hops to balance. Average mouthfeel, with slightly high carbonation levels. A pretty drinkable beer, appeals to the masses, but with a bit more flavor than an average BMC. Still, seems to share that same sickly sweet flavor that many of the macro lagers have, I don't know if this is from adjuncts, or something else."
"D - I bought it because it was on sale for $2 less than Sam Adams. I wish I had bought the Sam. Enough said!"
"D- This beer has a soft clean flavor but the favor it does have is not that good. I had a tough time finishing this beer as it was just not tasty and I didn't care for the nougat flavor it did have."
"D- This is a real nice beer, especially when you can get it on tap. Goes good with all types of BBQ nice and refreshing with good flavor."
"I had this on tap at the DFW airport between flights. I'd had it previously from bottles about 3 years ago, and wasn't really impressed. Now after trying it again I'm still not altogether impressed. It was a dark brown color with almost no head, and the aroma wasn't as malty-rich as the bocks I prefer. The smell definitely had a malt component, no hops in the smell, but it wasn't sweet and thick in the scent. The flavor was the same, kind of a bland beer with a hint of the bock style to it. I suspect that the brewery wanted to make a beer that was mostly still macro in character, with just a hint of the category of beer they were emulating. It's possible that this beer would then sell well, as it wouldn't be too offensive to the vast majority of typical beer consumers. It's just a guess on my part, but in any case I feel this is the definition of a gateway beer, not interesting enough to keep me occupied with it."
"D- Is a drinkable brew because of the low ABV. Decent beer, but nothing to write home about."
"Not a lot of smell, but the smell is malty. Taste is malty, with a vague sweetness to it. Flavor doesn't really go anywhere, but the flavor that is there is pleasant. Malty aftertaste dissipates quickly. Mouthfeel smooth. Not very complex, but has a pleasant taste, and very drinkable."
"This is my getting my connection in texas beer. Whenever i am in george bush(houston) or dallas fort worth i always make a point to find some brisket and suck down a few of these before i get on my next flight. The beer isnt complex but it is very drinkable and will always taste like texas to me."
"MF/D- Smooth and very easy to polish off."
"The beer pours a dark gold with an off white head. The aroma is of sweet malt. It has a sweet malt taste with very little hops. The feel is medium and wet. I find this to be a very drinkable session beer, and a fine low cost alternative. I had never had one, and wound up at Dover downs and it was the only non-macro available. I was so impressed I bought some when I got home."
"Good mouthfeel and a drinkablity that goes well with BBQ or Mexican. Not my favorite beer but I still find it appealing."
"this beer is pretty average. i'd pick it over an american macro, but only if there was nothing better"
"D - It's certainly drinkable and a better candidate to reach for over most any macro on the other hand if Boston Lager is on tap I'd take that over this"
"I like dark lagers and this one is pretty good. Good color with a quickly dissipating head. Good carbonation. Nice aroma and that malty taste that I love. Not a true bock in the German style but, a very drinkable American one. Not a bad beer to have on hand."
"D: Just meh. I'll finish it, but I won't buy it again."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is where Shiner Bock shines. I was raised on this beer, and even though I am from Texas and a little biased, Spoetzl's flagship beer is an affordable bock to have around the house. It is very inviting, perfect for a pick-me-up in the spring. I have had better bocks and beers before, but when I need a comfort drink to make me think of home, Easter pot lucks, and bluebonnets, I return to the yellow ram."
"Upon the first sip of this beer, there is a slight hoppy taste, with a light feel in the mouth. The taste blends in good and leaves you wanting more as you drink it. A great beer for drinking straight from the bottle. Has a nice even pour into a glass though. Definatly a great beer for going to resturaunts with little selection and great for sitting at home and just enjoying beer."
"Overall a decently complex macro offering and extremely easy to drink. Could be a bit more robust however."
"Solid effort from the folks in Shiner, Texas. Poured dark reddish-brown and maintained its head. Very drinkable with the correct amount of carbonation. Very smooth and high on the drinkability scale. Kind of thin on the mouthfeel for a true bock, but I guess this is a Texas bock not a German bock."
"D - I have no real problem with the beer, but I'd really like more out of it... This is kind of a Macro-Bock, so it's widely appealing with nothing that would offend anyone, but I wouldn't go out of my way to search it out. Would choose it over most ""lite"" macros though."
"This one screws up the girlfirend meter, she and I both like it."
"This beer is not a world class bock or probably not even a bock. It is a cheap easy to find beer with flavor. Great beer for golf."
""
"Appearance is dark amber with a crisp head that hangs just for a bit. Aroma is lightly malted and the same would go for the taste along with a mild sweetness. mouthfeel is light with good carbonation to help it go down. Got this one on sale, tried it, but I don't think I'd reach for this one again."
"Under a hot Texas sun, I can respect this brew's ability to quench a fierce thirst. It is refreshing, light, and easy to drink, however lacking the richness of my favorite bocks. Disappointing head disappears soon after pouring. As a bock lover, this is not a buy for me unless it is on special and I know I will be having guests who may appreciate the variety. Quite frankly, I am continuously finding it to be a boring beer - failing to boast any truly impressive feature, save for the hype."
"Dark carmel color with a faint aroma of shower water. The head died almost immediately after pouring. The taste is tart at the front and then fades nicely to a sweet charcoal. It is a bit lively on the tongue but the carbonation washes away into a more watery refreshment. A touch of what I have always liked to describe as cardboard flavor here and a hint of what might suggest this came from a can rather than a tap at DFW airport. But with some caramel highlights it's really not so bad. A refreshing drink that will go down pretty easy, but a little disappointing given its popularity in the Texas area."
"T: its a little too light in taste and mouthfeel too watery the taste has some of the malt and caramel character that you would expect however that said like the aroma it wasnt so powerful. its a good solid beer, not great but def a cut above avg"
"It had been perhaps 10 years since I last had this beer...which was a few years before I knew anything about beer. And while it was once a trade-up for me, it is no more. This bock is more like a mainstream lager than any other bock I've tasted. Aroma of this beer was of corn rather than malt, and its appearance was a pleasing clear red-brown with a minimal amount of head. Flavor was pretty lack-luster...not as corn-y as the aroma, but still not very malty for a bock. Mouthfeel was unremarkable, but I have a hard time imagining drinking more than 2-3 of these...not because they were flavored extremely strongly or because it is high in alcohol, but just because drinking it kind of made me want something else."
"The is a decent beer. Nothing jazzy here, but it's good for around the backyard barbecue, when you're not as concerned with complexity."
"I tried this at a restaurant in Arizona just out of curiosity. The smell was not to strong. The taste was smooth and had no bitterness to it which was surprising considering the color.You could probably drink this beer all day when working in the yard or something if you like a dark beer that isnt too strong."
"For all its deficiencies, this is a drinkable brew and is the most widely available non-swill in Texas. When I visit the in-laws in East TX this is what I retreat to. It reminds me of a Southern Leinie's and strikes me as something I'd have drunk as a stepping-stone brew if I'd grown up in, let's say, Ft. Worth. Or on second thought, let's not say that."
"Notes: This beer has an almost cult-like following here in Texas, though I'm not really sure why. It's not a bad beer, but it's certainly not a great one either. If you're ever in Texas, I'd recommend trying it just so you can see what all the hype's about. I guess my biggest beef with it is the label. It's not a bock beer by any standard. I'd call it a Vienna lager."
"Pours a crisp amber with a decent head that quickly diminished to a ring. The aroma was dominated by caramel malts, but not much else, overall rather weak. The beer was very malts, but overall rather on the bland/off side. The beer is very light and crisp but somewhat overly carbonated. I find it somewhat hard to believe that this is advertised as microbrew. It really has a big brewery feel and would likely only be truly enjoyed by fans of that beer. Give me a Spaten Bock over this stuff any day."
"Try it if you get the chance, and then move on to something else."
"I liked the light taste of this beer without it tasting like your avareage lager. It was smooth and refreshing while not being too sweet. Another beer that I wish that I could get here in Buffalo. It is a nice beer to have in the Fridge to offer friends that aren't adventurous when it comes to trying new beers."
"Was this a good beer that was dumbed down. I hope so (actually hope not)."
"On special at a Tex-Mex place in Austin. The beer is dark brown with some amber overtones. There's not much in the way of smell, but what's there is the smell of dark malts, maybe some wheat. The flavor is slight, nowhere near as pronounced as that of bocks in Germany. I've described this to friends as ""an American macro lager with food coloring in it."" There's maybe a little more bitterness and malt flavor than Budweiser, but it's not incredibly complex or anything. Still, it has a nice, creamy mouthfeel and very good drinkability. It lacks the offensive aftertaste of the Shiner Hefeweizen. This would be an inexpensive bock I would keep in my fridge for spring consumption."
"again, one of the first beers i ever tryed in the good ole united states, and living in texas at the time..it's basically everywhere..and when you find a good establishment with good turnover , it really can be good...""This beautiful brown brew with its sweet smell and delicious taste that is slighty bitter but sweet with a brilliant after taste that rivals other American beers of the same style!"""
"I had no problem downing 4 or 5 Shiners over the course of 2 hours at the bar last saturday. It's a good beer to drink with friends while thowing darts, shooting pool, or what have you. Almost everyone I've introduced it to has enjoyed it."
"Surprised to find out I enjoyed this beer more in a bottle than on tap. Had trouble finishing the one I had with dinner. Appearence was dark amber with one finger of head which disappeared to quickly, almost no smell and flavor was not as good as the bottle I had the prior evening."
"Poured into a pint glass, the bock appears somewhat lighter than others I've tried but still has a decent, medium-brown hue. The head is a little on the thin side, however the stout I've been drinking lately might have skewed my view. The aroma is probably the beer's best feature - warm and fruity with just a hint of spice. Flavor wise the beer comes up a little short; it has many of the subtle fruity characteristics of a bock, but it seems a little on the thin side. Overall, not a bad beer, and at the very reasonable price I'm sure I'll buy it again."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium bodied in the mouth with a bit of wateriness, and in my opinion there is just a bit too much carbonation. Not tough beer to drink, but I think that there have to be much better ones out there that do a better job of summing up the style. We'll see how the rest of the sixer fares."
"Drinkability is average. I'm not much on the style, or the taste. If you like a bock this is probably an OK choice."
"From Safeway in Eureka, CA on sale at $6.29 a six-pack. This poured an amber to brown color with light tan head and almost no lacing. Nose was sweet malts. Mouthfeel average. Flavor very bland and finish non-descript. While this may be the best thing to come out of Texas it is not very impressive. This one is dead average for its type."
"Overall impression: A lightly malty, slightly grainy, well balanced beer. No off flavors and seems like a fresh sample. Not sure this is truly a ""bock"" other than the fact that it's probably a lager yeast strain. Tastes like a macro lager with some carmel flavoring. Still, it's highly sessionable and pretty good once the DMS clears out. Worth a try I suppose."
" I can't imagine anybody not liking this beer, as it has more to offer than any BMC product would. That being said, this would be a decent session beer for this time of the year, when the heavier stouts and winter brews start to give way to hefe's and belgian ales. This is a good transitional beer for that time period or something to enjoy for a relaxed night out, but not suited for much else."
"This is the beer that I first experienced after becoming of legal age. Before that, it was always my dads Bud Light. Therefore, this review may be a little biased. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep copper, forming a nice fluffy 1 inch head, leaving medium rings of lace on the glass. The aroma appears to be mostly of malt, maybe a little grain, and a slight bit of hops. The taste is light malts, and a hint of hops, with a light caramle aftertaste. Not a heavy beer, but still no shortness of flavor. Medium mouthfeel. Good carbonation, and a smooth finish. This is easily a beer to session. Whether sitting at home, or in a tube on the river, this is a great beer wherever you go."
"Pours a light brown/amber with a 1"" head with little lacing. Aroma is fairly clean with malts and a light caramel. It has a decent taste with a mediocre mouthfeel. The flavor is clean with hints of the caramel/toffee taste while it stings slightly in the mouth -- too thin and carbonated."
"Paid 6.69 for a 6-pack. Mahogany/cherry wood color, dark orange brown with hints of cherry red. Nice color. Not much head or lacing to speak of. Smell is light malt, honey, dust, some cherry fruit. No hops. Taste is weak. Watery, low malt presence, some metal, almost refined sugar taste. Slight fruitiness. That said, it finishes very clean and could be quite refreshing in summer. Mouthfeel is very fizzy with heavy open bubbles. Drinkability is higher due to the ease of drinking this beer."
"I was really let down by this beer. It is nowhere as good as Penn St. Nick bock. I know that is a really good beer to live up to, but it really fell short. It was better than Michelob Bock, though."
"D- i had a hard time drinking this, if you can make it through the initial sweet rush, then you get a glance at some decent flavor. not my thing, but recommend for macro drinkers who fear darker beer."
"Cheers!"
"This beer was totally non-impressive. Poured very thin, to a pale amber color, with little head or lacing. I could not detect any aroma, and the taste, whatever was there, was not evident due to the watery texture and stale finish. Id heard this was a good beer...obviously I was listening to the wrong people."
"I'll drink it again...I live in Texas...and let's face it, it's just an average beer...it won't kill you."
"I'm not one to knock on cans (I really like Warbird and Dale's Pale Ale), but out of the can, Shiner Bock is raunchy. Better in the bottle or on tap. I'd like to chalk this up to having had a really old can."
"Overall: A good drinking beer, especially if you enjoy moderately malty brew."
"Ordered on tap. Looked ok a deep mahogony in the club. Not much going on in the way of smell. Mouthfeel was carbonated like soda to me and the bitter tastes and sweet tastes were not blended, adjunct taste. I love Bocks and Dubblebocks, great quaffing beers for me and remind me of my tour in Germany, this one I just couldn't finish. This brewerys offering just aren't to my taste though it seems to be a solid seller."
"This beer is worshiped by many in TX. I have to say, it's not bad when compared to Coors Light, Bud Light, etc. Plenty of color and flavor compared to those usual macro suspects. As an aspiring craft-ish brew, it leaves a lot to be desired. I did enjoy this one, though. Thanks to cburian for ""importing"" this one so I could sample and review it."
"Came without much of a head, but the color was nice, dark brown (like rich chocolate milk) and just a bit of carbonation. I was surprised that there wasn't much smell to speak of, though the malt did come through in the nose a bit. A bit thin in the mouth, the flavor was surprisingly rich. Lightly roasted malt (a bit less ""roast"" flavor than I expected, given the color) and a delicate balance of hops to refresh. I enjoyed it. I was driving and that's all I could do; but others in our party had second glasses. It's easily a beer you could enjoy all night."
"Poured burnt orange in color with a minimal laced head. What was there was gone very quickly. Smells of malt and grapes. Tatses pretty much like nothing at first. No sweetness no malt. Then a slight bitterness tries to reach out to grab your tongue, but I think it moved done my throat too fast, leaving something trying to come but not quite reaching its goal. Very fizzy and overly carbonated. Very drinkable as its almost like drinking down a bottle of water."
"Drinkable,but boring,reminds me of a macro. Got a keg for 1/2 price,now I know why."
"Overall drinkability was good. This beer is easily drinkable even though there is no particular outstanding component."
"Drinkability-- if we'd stayed, I would have been on to something else, I couldn't drink a lot of this in-session."
"Red autumn color, decent head with nice lacing. Smell came off fruity, but i liked that. I can't explain the taster over than there was a hint of citrus and was a good well rounded beer. Medium carbonation, great for everyday drinking. My kind of beer!"
"Can drink easily if poured in a glass for a while, but it gets boring."
"When I visited my daughter and son-in-law in Houston recently, I wanted to try one of the local brews. This is what they told me to order. It was a dark amber color with no head to it. It had a nondescript malty aroma, and a nondescript , vaguely sweet taste. Actually OK for mouthfeel, and drinkable in the sense that it went down easily. Not one of my favorite beers; hope other offerings from the brewery are better."
"This beer poured a clear dark color with a thin head that dissipated quickly. The smell is a bit malty with a light hop scent. The taste is mild and malty with a hop finish. The mouthfeel is thin and carbonated. The drinkablity of this one is highease to kick back with a few."
"Pours a light brown, topped by an off-white head. Aroma has some hints of caramel and hops, fairly clean with a bit of a mineral note as well. Flavor has some light malt notes, a bit of caramel, and a rather clean finish. Mouthfeel is solid and supports the flavor well. Mouthfeel actually greatly enhances the flavor. I must actually say that I enjoyed this beer more than I expected to. Don't overlook this beer just because it's well known or it's ""not a bock"". For a good, solid everyday performer, I'd love to have this one available around the house."
"Not on the short list, but it'll do in a pinch."
"No particular strong flavors, just basic caramel malts and a touch of bitter in the finish. Mouthfeel is refreshing but doesn't stand up very well in the mouth. A bit of a gritty, cloying aftertaste. Goes down smooth and easy but just doesn't inspire. I could see it again on occasion, but if I didn't, my life would still be worth living.."
"Pours a light amber with a minimal head. Smells of bread and grains with hops as a background. The taste is heavy of bread and lingers into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is well balanced with the carbonation but lacks in complexity. If you enjoy the taste of one you could have more, a more tasty beer would be more drinkable."
"D - It is drinkable. I'd rather drink this than a typical macro, but it is a weak example of the style. I am not going to have this again. Well, honestly, this is the first Bock I have ever had, but I am comparing it to what I imagine a half doppelbock half water mixture would taste. It begs the question, why bock, when you can doppel?"
"D-not my favorite beer, but still pretty easy to drink."
"Not the best offering I have had lately but at the airport in Dallas I had to try a local Texas beer. Poured a dark amber brown color. Light frothy tanish white head. Disapated rather quickly. No lacing of the glass. Smells light and malty some type of yeasty dough smell. Mild hints of caramel, brown sugary, light toasted corn nut smell-maybe a hint of baked beans? Rather smooth but also quite watery. Not alot of body in this beer. It is drinkable and rather light for a darker beer. It had a nice mild caramel malt flavor that is followed by a light hop finish. Not a lot of hops present in this brew. It is alright but I think I would pass on it next time. Fat Tire was on tap too so I went with that next. It makes for a tough competion."
"this should be the national beer of texas.living here in texas this is one of my main fridge beers.this is a beer that wont gag you if it gets warm.has a nice head with moderate lacing.cost a little more than the macro brews but its worth it.so when yall come to visit try a shiner bock you wont be sorry. oh and ask about the rams head on the bottle."
"Ok, but not great."
"This is a beer I always try to drink at least a couple of when visiting the Lone Star state. I haven't gotten down there in a while so I had one in lieu of major macros at a local Italian place. A: The appearance seemed promising with nice med brown color and light carbonation with a thin head. S: Not much to speak of really, a little carmelized malt with a tiny bit of smokiness maybe. T: Mild and a little disappointing with some malt body and little hop balance. Carmel and a slight undertone of hickory smoke. M: Pretty thin for a beer that claims to be a bock. This is pretty drinkable stuff, if as in my case, you find yourself somewhere that only offers BMC products. I'm not sure why but I have in the past drunk 3 or even sometimes fewer Shiner Bocks and woken up with a hangover. There is some additive or ingredient contained therein that does not agree with my system, so session this stuff with a degree of caution."
"D - Nothing outstanding about it, but it is very drinkable. I could easily put down a few of these in a sitting."
"12 oz. with no freshness date. It's a clear, deep copper hue with very active carbonation and a 2"" khaki head that leaves light lacing. Light caramel and molasses malts in the aroma with some macro/adjunct qualities. The flavor is the same with very light green/spicy hops on top of a light body that has lively carbonation and leaves a short finish. Easy to drink but not very flavorful. Tastes like a macro version of a bock."
"D - As far as bocks go, it's not my favorite but it goes down well."
"Nothing really stands out about this ""bock"" but I have to admit, I could knock quite a few of these back with great ease. I found absolutely nothing offensive whatsoever...yeah, its thin and not all that exciting, but its still a decent dark lager of sorts."
"Shiner bock was deep copper in color with a 3/4 inch head that disappeared almost immediately. sweet malt aroma and flavor. Light to medium bodied, seems light for the slyle. It's not something that I would buy again, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"Not a great example of the style, but a solid beer none the less. One of the closest brewerys near my home, and one I have visited often. Recommended."
"Tiny hint of malts present, barely any hop qualities."
"recommendable 88%."
"Very sippable. Although the flavors could be more pronounced, they balance nicely with the carbonation to make for an enjoyable brew. I can see why so many people are die-hard fans of this beer."
"Drinkability is good...I drank a sixer of this at dinner. I like it, but I don't think it's a good example of the bock style. And I like supporting the underdog...it's an order of magnitude better than anything BMC produces, and AB has created a product line specifically to steal this guy's market share. So I buy when I see it."
"I remember thinking this was the bomb in college before my palate found itself and tasted ""good' beer from places like Sierra and Stone. It is a crappy Bock (why do they call it that when it really isn't) but is an alright substitute for Macros if there is nothing else around."
"First off, I chose this beer from the draft line-up at Silver Jack Mining restaurant in Montrose,CO. Due to the restaurants poor selection of draft beer (domestic dominated with the usual New Belgium bs) I ordered a Shiner Bock because it was the only beer available that I hadn't tried. It arrived at my table poured to the top of the glass with no head at all, not a good start. The first sip was a mixture of under carbonated beer / dirty draft lines. That was my entire experienced as I kindly asked our waiter for a glass of water to clean my pallet. Not recommended."
"This is not a great beer by an stretch. In fact, I would place it only slightly above a Budweiser or something. The smell not great, and the taste is only slightly more complex than any standard issue 24 pack at the gas station. I wouldn't recomend this beer and I won't be buying it again. its a little hoppy, but mainly the taste is bland boriing, and not at all unique."
"Overall. its one of those you just have old memories of, certainly one that we all drank some in the past. Bad example of a bock, but i say it is quite drinkable and great at bbq's."
"Shiner Bock pours a dark copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I really can't smell much of anything. The flavor is less than exciting as well. A little malt, a little nut like flavor. Maybe worth a try. I wont be buying it again though."
"The pour is a dark copper-red with a white head that makes a brief appearance. The nose has caramel malts, lager yeast, and earthly/fruity hops. Those flavors combine with roasted malts and nuts in its bland taste. The mouthfeel is okay, but it bit too sticky. Feh."
"This is only on par with Amber Bock. There's no reason to seek it out, although it would be ok in a pinch if BMC were the only alternatives."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability: This beer makes me frown and shake my head. It's not awful, just really off in a lot of ways. I wouldn't mind trying a fresher bottle or a glass on tap."
"I'm not sure how they get away with calling this a bock, as the flavor here is so bland! It feels too light for a bock as well. Maybe it could work as a dark lager. Might be best have it with food, so that you don't notice the complete lack of flavor. Overall, it's a fairly average beer."
"I lot of people hate on this beer and as a bock it is a fraud, however as a beer it sometimes fills the void. Out of the bottle or on tap the beer is pretty much the same. Nice amber color with a white head that doesn't lace but has some staying power. This smells of mostly clean lager yeast with a hinting of malts and hops but nothing too much. The flavor is crisp amber lager beer with maybe a bend to the sweeter ock style. This beer could just use more to push it into the next step-up. Overall an easy drinker, but it holds back to gain mass appeal. Beer is buisnesss."
"This is an alright beer, but not really worth the $6.99/6-pack price tag, IMO. Give me some Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for $1 more."
"Shiner gets kicked alot here on the advocate and I guess I understand that. Compared to the great micros and European imports it's just - well, it is what it is. But there's something about their Bock and their Kolsch (which is not reviewed here). They are just plain drinkable. And the more you drink them the more you appreciate them. Day in and day out Shiner is a good choice."
"20+ years drinking this beer. Appearance is amber with little to no head out of the bottle -- from tap the head is a bit better and longer retention. Very drinkable, not as heavy as you would think a bock-style beer, which makes it a good 'session' beer."
"Tried this from a friend who procured a bottle for me, poured into a pint glass. No real head to speak of, with a smell comparable to that of bud or another mass-produced brew. Taste was a little better with some sweet malt shining through, though nothiung striking. mouthfeel was very light as was taste,which was unexpected due to darkened color. allright beer for cookouts or when its hot out im guessing"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The beer is well carbonated. This is a very easy to drink beer. This may work itself into my beer rotation. Is this a good bock? I seriously doubt that it is a good bock. This is not a bad beer in my book."
"Very refreshing on a hot day."
"This beer was one of my standards while I was living in Texas. It was carried just about everywhere and tasted great. Dark brown with a nice tan head. Tasted a bit like new castle (don't yell at me) but they both have a bit of a nutty taste. easy to drink, perfect carbonation. if you haven't tried it I would defiantly recommend picking some up. no doubt it wont be the best thing you ever had. but like I said, its a good regular and its not too expensive."
"Pours a deep reddish brown without much of a head. Scents of toasted caramel and fruit on the nose. I had this beer several years ago and recall enjoying it at the time. However, I found this to be on the thin side, although it was smooth, this could be due to the watered down effect the beer provided. Not offensive, but not enough to make you want another. Thanks to jhammerly for the bottle."
"The amber color is OK, not much of a scent, and a bitter-sweet flavor that is basically a strong Coors. A really strong Coors."
"Drinkable, but nuthin special."
"Had this on tap at a Nick's Sports Pub. They have a large selection, and I'm trying to get through everything. First off, I love bock's. I gave this a try. I was not happy. It felt watery and tasted kind of flat, which I guess is how it is supposed to taste since I had it on tap. I don't think I'd get this ever again. It was slightly sweet, but overall very boring. Also, the smell was weird. I don't know else how to describe it....but it wasn't pleasant."
"Shiner Bock pours a nice copper color with a head that dissipates really quickly. Leaves some lacing on the glass. Didn't notice anything exceptional in the smell. Not a particularly memorable taste, but not unpleasant either. Overall malt background, a little bitterness, a real slight astringent taste. Other than lack of head, the only other thing that disappoints is the mouthfeel. Really thin. Drinkability is good (I had three of them and they went down fine, just enough taste to hold your interest for a session). If I had a choice between Yeungling, Sam Adams Boston lager or Shiner Bock, the Shiner Bock would lose. As an alternative to BMC...no problem."
"Notes: Thanks to my friend for bringing the bottle back from Austin, TX. Great to finally get the chance to give it a try. Could see myself bringing pitchers and pitchers of this in a bar as tumbleweed rolls by on a dusty Texas street."
"Edit: I had this beer, my friend bought some and owes me so I had one. Holy crap, I can not taste anything but malts. Where are the hops? Adjunts come out a little too."
"-Oelergud"
"Had a chance to sample a bottle on a recent trip south of the border. One of the beer options available at the Famous Tootsie's in Nashville. Clear copper brown color, small top of off white foam that doesn't last. Smell is some caramel with a bit of molasses, malty nose but really have to look for it. Taste is a caramel malt with a toffee or molasses. Pretty thin taste, hint of flavor but kind of lacking. The more you drink, the more bland it seems, leaves you wanting more flavor and taste. Mouthfeel is diluted and watered down, pretty thin for a bock. A little darker, but not much to it. A easy to drink, step up from a macro."
"This beer was not like any other bock I've tasted, and was not what I was expecting. I hope it wasn't the meal interfering with my pallette, but this brew really seemed like it was in an entirely different family altogether; and not a good one at that: American (macro) Lager/Pilsener. The color was lighter than I expected, a reddish amber, and a little pale. The bitterness seemed way out of balance, a biting sort of front end to the experience, and a rather watery, thin mouthfeel followed. It definitely fell short of my expectations."
"Appears dark, dark, amber, small carbs and little head that left nothing on top. This beer has no real smell. It had a slight grainy scent, other than that, nothing to appetize. It the mouth, it was average for foam but seemed to have a wierd sour taste not from hops, it didn't seem like this was turning bad either, just unwelcome. It seemed like a darker lager taste, but there really wasn't anything else to speak off. It was a little bitter, but hops were not noticeable and there was a note of must from the water. Date on the bottle was 02 03 06, so either it's old, or it's young and it tastes no good. I wouldn't reccomend this."
"Had on tap at the Fox and Hound in Beavercreek. My main problem with this one is it was just bland. Not bland as in bad, but bland as in nothing distinguishing about it. Draft when served was a clear reddish brown with a faint veil of foam. Aroma was clean. Tastewise...sorry just bland. Low malt, low hops, nothing to distinguish, same at the start as at the finish. An interesting experience."
"I'd pick this over several other macros, but there are too many better brews to make it a regular."
"Is it possible for a beer to be the epitome of a style, but so boring that it's just dead-on average? That's Shiner Bock -- I drink these every so often, but never buy a six-pack and will generally pick another beer over it. Might be a bridge for a macro-lover, but that's about it."
"Shiner Bock. I've just found a replacement for Yuengling lager. This is some good stuff to slurp down, one after the other, after a long day of work or while mowing the lawn on a hot summer day."
"I feel this is an average beer worth picking up from the grocery store every once in a while to make an evening out of it."
"All of that said, this is a beer that you could knock back pretty quickly. Not good enough to savor, not bad enough that it's undrinkable."
"D - Drinkable. The taste is not too bad, not sure if I will buy again, but I might use it in my chili recipe."
"Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, either. Its best quality is that it looks like it will taste good. Better for tailgating, etc. than when you want a tasty beer to stand on its own merits."
"After my experiment today...I will definitely be drinking the Shiner over the Ziegenbock at Hooters. If I want a ""real"" beer, I am going elsewhere."
"Bottles are good but properly served pints are awesome! Catch one at the Dallas airport and you won't be sorry."
"Compared to typical microbrews, it's a bit on the weak side. You can definitely tell it is not all barley/wheat, but for what it is, Shiner Bock is mighty good. Definitely head and shoulders above most of the beers you can find local bars."
"I need to get a German bock, cause I cant believe this is what a bock should be: a clear cola brown, with a big, fuzzy tan head. Almost no malt smell, followed by a thin, earthy taste  but just not much there, very weak and uninspiring. Fizzy beverage, and very light bodied. Not rich at all, way too hoppy _ WHERE are the robust malts??"
"12 ounce bottle. Shiner Bock pours out a dark copper color with a rocky head. Husky grain aroma. Sweet caramel flavor with husk coming in at the middle. Not at all complex, but the malt flavor is pleasant. The finish is bland. A one dimensional beer, but I imagine this is drinkable in large quantities. Mouthfeel is light to medium. This won't hold up to the better German bocks, but for a Texas beer, this isn't bad."
"Admittedly it's far from true to style, but if you look past that, the taste isn't bad."
"Being a ""discerning beer drinker"" myself, I find little in Shiner Bock that either disgusts me or impresses me. It has slightly more body and appreciably more flavor than your major American Lagers, but as a true Bock or a craft brew it falls way short. For these reasons I give it mostly average scores (not to be compared to what I would consider an ""average"" craft brew but rather to qualities that I would say are basically neutral), but I do not share the view of some other reviewers who find the beer to be utterly undrinkable. In fact the only thing that I find makes drinking this beer in any large quantity difficult is boredom."
"An above-average regional lager, really. It's not a bock by German standards, but it is a bock by early 20th century American standards, and it kinda tugs at a Texan's heartstrings. In college in Austin in the 80s, pitchers of Shiner were as cheap as Budweiser, and so much better, back before we discovered microbrews. It's still good for a nostalgic taste trip when nothing better is available."
"The label is nicely designed and provides interesting information about the ""little brewery"" and it's history. Unfortunately that's the best part of this brew. It pours into a pint glass with a bit below average carbonation and a clear brown color with just a tinge of red to it. Head dissipates quickly. Aroma is full of DMS and slight malty grains. Flavor is weak and barely more than a Swiller Lite with a hint of dark malt/chocolate to it. Poor representation of the Bock style, and just short of awful. Choked down the rest of the pint. I bought a 6 pack... guess i'll have to pass off a couple bottles on those who might want to try ""one of those dark beers."" Even a Mich Amber Bock tries harder than this. That's not saying much."
"Pours a clear amber that is more on the brown side. Offwhite head of a larger size with big bubbles and a little carbonation settles down to lace the top of the beer. Malty in aroma with no trace of alcohol, pretty clean. Grainy in taste with some toasted malt sweetness and very faint hints of caramel. A rather dry and clean finish. Overall not a bad brew at all, but it leaves me wanting more as for as flavour goes. Nothing great, but definately better than the macros, and the same price as well (at least here in Texas)."
"A one-trick pony. This wouldn't be a bad beer if there was more ""beer"" in the bottle. Average across the board. But hey, if it goes for $8.99/12 and impresses your friends that you're into ""microbrews", more power to ya."
"Served in a pint glass, this a dark amber brown with a thin white head, little retention, no lacing. Smell is really light, a sweet grainy malt, a little corny. Taste is a slightly roasted malt, pretty light, slightly caramel, and a tiny trace of hops. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, and carbonation is on the high side. Pretty bland, but drinkable enough, there's worse beers out there."
"I would suggest that you try this and make a judgment for yourself. I think it is nothing special but I do have one every now and then. Nothing appalling, just nothing fantastic; if you like this, try Shiner Light."
"Drinkability - I couldn't make it past one of these tonight. Hard to down, and not easy to enjoy."
"It is best served on the warmer side and paired with schnitzel and sauerkraut."
"Friends from Tennessee brought up a case of this with them, and boy did we plow through some bottles! It pours a dark slightly-reddish copper with a small, off-white, foamy head that quickly diminishes to a tenacious film. Very little lacing. The smell is mild, bready malt, caramel, light citrus and grape. The taste is mild too, with solid malts up front but turning a little weak in the middle. The finish is short, crisp and slightly woodsy. It has a medium-light body, dry texture, and soft carbonation. Theres something about this beer that makes it so ridiculously drinkable. Highly sessionable and it seems to get better the more you drink. The beer is nothing special, but Id definitely pick this beer up as an everyday beer if I could get it up here. However I have to lower my rating a bit since its quite weak for the style. I expect more from a bock."
"A thumbs up on this beer. This beer is pretty dark but not too filling. It has a good full bodied taste. This beer is way better when its fresh, if this is on sale, ill buy it again definetly, definetly a good beer. Sometimes it can be a bit pricy though. I had it in the bottles, I never even seen cans for this. Taste was pretty good for a dark beer."
"Drinkability: I can't bear the aftertaste. I had one and was through."
"An average beer at best."
"There is not much to say about this beer. It's pour is unimpressive the head is on finger at best and does not stick with a glass at all. There is little to no aroma, good or bad at best a faint malt smell that gives little or no clue to the beers make or flavor. The taste is suprisingly full and easy. Moutfeel is watery but robust enough. Overall this is my beer of choice to tailgate or drink in quantity. I can buy it for little $$ and drink one after another untill taste is not an issue. I buy it on a regular basis and enjoy it."
"The flavor is a bit weak for the style, but what's there is reasonably good. The smell is malt with a hint of some spice. The taste is also mostly malt, with a definite caramel presence. Alcohol and hops are minimal. Due the relative weakness of this beer, mouthfeel is easily the low point, although that helps lead to easy drinkability."
"Light bodied. Bock? More like Bock Lite, but still better than the average Texas beer and a bit more taste and character than the average mass market brew. Good chaser for Tex-Mex."
"this bock is a gelding in comparison to the real deal."
"Drinkability: ok, could drink these rather easily.... but I would not want it on a real hot day."
"This must have been a really fresh bottle. New label with a little history lesson on it. Pours a beautiful dark amber with a thin off white head that lingers for a short while before disappearing. Sweet malty aroma you would expect from a bock.Taste is much smoother than the dark color would lead you to believe, smooth, sweet and malty with just a hnt of herbal hops. Good session beer."
"Pours a clear amber. Good looking color. Thin off-white head disappears immediately. Faint malty aroma, corn husky. Faint floral aroma. Sweet m,alt, slightly toasty but very faint. Feels prickly on the tongue. Light body, almost watered down. Easy to drink, but not flavorful. Certainly not a good bock. Maybe a fair alternative to a macro."
"Pours a dark copper brown, pretty clear. A very fizzy two finger head falls quickly with poor lacing. Strong buttery malt scent, no hop presence to speak of. Aroma sets you up for a let down with the bland, dry taste. While true to style in low hop presence, the malt flavor is weak and simple. Mild malt with a hint of nut and spice. It's light body and low carbonation make it drinkable and smooth, but boring. A German style lager made in Texas; what can you expect?"
"Slàinte!"
"A mild malt aroma is noticable, no apparent hoppy smell. Light carmel color in appearance. Large creamy head, which quickly dissapated while drinking. Persistent small bubbles, moderate carbonation. Very malty in flavor. Mouthfeel is what i would consider somewhat of a smooth bite at the back of the mouth but goes down with no bitterness. This is what i would consider a good, but not great bock beer. Will drink again, occaisionally."
"that was the last of the passing grades. smelled some metallic and uninspired bitterness, with a crippled malt presence. Tasted some dark fruits/prunes. Not much to counter that. Taste was faint. mouthfeel was ok. slid nicely down the neck without irritation. Its not garbage by any stretch because it is fairly nuetral and inoffensive. its a snooozer ZZZ zzzz zzzz."
"If you've ever had yuengling's traditional lager, this is a great substitute for it. I find shiner's bock to be very similar in flavor, about the same in price and more consistent than yuengling. Alot of times yuengling will taste too flat and watered down or too carbonated. Sometimes you get it really sweet which is awesome but it's very rare. If you know what i'm talking about than relate to flavor to a more carbonated yuengling. I find shinerbock a bit more prickley unless yuengling is over carbonated. Overall i think the texans are beating us in a Shiner bock vs. Yuengling lager battle."
"Good drinkability, I have put down several of these on many ocassions. Obviously not a bock, this beer shares more characteristics with an amber ale or an Oktoberfest. Still a decent beer and it is easy to see why it is so popular. It lands somewhere between a macro and a micro and is a good cross-over for many."
"I loved the color of this beer, brown to molasses, but wanted more body more taste more nose. Having said that, still better than most of your choices in the lone star state. The brewrey should try to gradually bump up the body & nose, subvert from within!"
"Growing up in Texas, I know Texans are proud of their beer. And Shiner is no exception. I've always been a fan, and even though many knowledgable beer drinkers will argue that there is nothing terribly exciting about Shiner (and they would be right), it's still a huge success for a number of reasons. It's a highly drinkable, worthy alternative to the American macro brews that rule the market. It has a nice color, and is an excellent thirst-quencher to accompany a saturday cookout. But as far as bocks go, Shiner is one of the least complex versions out there. It's not fancy, but it's not trying to be. It's just trying to be a dependable beer. Here in the mid-Atlantic (where you can now find Shiner at various locales), it's akin to Yuengling. And that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"There was nothing remarkable about this. I'll pass on future ones if other options are available."
"A weaker attempt of a traditional beer. Still plesant tasting though. It looks brown and moderately carbonated. Slightly tan head pours a 1/2"" head that wants to stay. No lacing detected. Smells mildly malty, nutty, bready, and yeasty. Tastes smoothly malty, caramelly, roasted, toasty, and a bit chocolatey. Flavors similar to a porter, but not nearly as bold. Body is medium and a bit carbonated. Like many American Bock beers, it is grainy and sweetly sticky to the toung without the supporting malt character or the warming finish. Likewise the finish is sticky and a bit grainy. Yeast character remains. Aftertaste is slightly nutty and clean. A safe, easily drinkable beer, but not one to brag about either."
"Pours a transparent dark brown with no real head to speak of. Smells like....umm, beer? Kind of metallic. Tastes like....watery beer? A hint of caramel malt to let you know it's supposed to be dark, but other than that entirely bland. Mouthfeel is probably about the thinnest I've ever experienced in a beer, even the carbonation was limp. Slightly higher drinkability rating only because it goes down like water. So...apparently I drank a beer last night....I guess."
"Mouthfeel is moderate and this is a nice, simple, drinkable brew."
"Thanks for sharing Kev! 12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep copper color with two fingers of head that die off quickly. There is almost no lacing. The smell has a decent caramel malt base. It's fairly sweet, and there's a faint hint of biscuit malt. The taste is sweet and malty. Lots of caramel, kinda toasty as well. The finish has the slightest bit of hops. The mouthfeel could be a little bit thicker. The drinkability is great. A decent American take at a bock."
"Pours a deep amber color with a very slight covering over top. It seems to want to stay around more than others. The nose is roasty, slightly grainy and a touch of brown sugar sweetness. Not too bad here. The flavor is fairly grainey and slightly toasty with a faint sweetness. Almost a little drying on the finish as well. the feel is a solid moderate, even light thick, with a moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty nice brew. Good session brew. I can easily have a few of these in a night."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Now, onto the ""bock"" categorization that everyone mentions. It was common during the late 50's, 60's and 70's for breweries to simply add coloring to their regular beers (or slightly higher gravity brews) and release them in the spring as bocks. That seems like what this is. I'd guess they're using a product called ""porterine", but there are others available. Or it could have had something to do with the way that beers of a certain strength are categorized in Texas. Either way, it's nothing new and there's nothing to be ashamed of. It's a decent, enjoyable beer.... forget that it's not really a bock and have another one!"
"If you intend to go to Austin at anytime you will be forced to consume this beer. I appreciated the fact that there wasn't a budweiser to be found in the club we were in. Yet Shiner Bock was ubiquitous. I hadn't even asked for a beer when it was handed to me. ""Don't mind if I do."" I wasn't expecting a real bock beer so I wasn't let down. Yet it was nicely balanced with a caramel malt sweetening it slightly withough any cloying. The smell was of sweet malt with a grainy note and a hint of some hops. It was gone in a few gulps and I was on to the next one. The second one I poured in a ""Cincinnati"" they had sitting there next to the water jug and the clarity was fine but the color was certainly off for a bock as I suspected and the head was nice and sticky."
"Deep amber color with a thin lace for a head. Carbonation sizzles a bit when the beer is first poured. The smell is clean with a hint of toasted grains and faint hops. The taste is not very big either. Medium bodied with toasted grain dominating the flavor. A fair amount of carbonation and a small amount of hops come through. Light toasted grain aftertaste. Nothing complex here. Just an easy drinking beer that is better than your mainstream dark lager."
"Pours medium amber, very slightly hazy. Nose does not consist of much, slight malts and alcohol. Good carbonation, not much head, slight lacing. Taste is a bit light, but not too light. Does not taste like a light beer, necessarily. Malts come out at the end to round out the feel and flavor. I think if the malts weren't there then it would be a failure. This beer was enjoyable and easy to drink. If you are looking for an option that is not your standard pisswater but still want to drink several beers without them being heavy, this is a good option."
"I personally thought that this was a great overall beer. It poured an amber/copper color. Had a very rich, full flavored smooth taste to it. Absolutely no excessive bitterness at all. This is definitely one of the better beers to come out of the state of Texas."
"pours a one finger plus head. it is a medium brown that is very clear. i smell malt, an earthy note, and grassy. malt and bitter is well-balanced. the style should be a little heavier to the malt but i like it balanced. finishes clean and spicy. fair, very drinkable beer but nothing remarkable."
"poured a moderate copper color with slight head that quickly fell to a slight ring. Smell was almost totally absent, but at least not unpleasant. Taste was refeshing, but I could not find anyting to get excited about. Mouthfeel is not unpleasant with a slight hint of malt. An easy drinking beer."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a 1/4"" brown head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry yet fruity scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with lager yeast. The taste is decent. It has a smooth, roasted flavor that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with a dry lager yeast finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a pretty good brew. I see the overall average is low, but I think it's tastey and quite enjoyable."
"A poor introduction to the Bock style but not nearly as awful as I remember. More of an American Dark Lager but I can't believe this beer has won awards..."
"Had my first bottle last week after my brother brought some home from his Texas trip and a visit to the brewery. This is a light brown colored beer with a pleasant smell out of the bottle. Taste, I agree, is light for a bock which I expect to have some mouthfeel chewability to it. It is probably the reason that there is a reputation this beer has as a college brew...it's not going to slow you down any chewing on it. I have to say I like it and will easily drink a few again. I understand that the distribution of Shiner is pretty extensive so you may find it at a decent brew depot."
"Amber - brown in color with an airy off-white head. Unpleasant aroma of sour fruit, malt and wet cardboard. Mouthfeel is thin. In addition, Shiner Bock is thin in flavor for a bock beer. Has this been watered-down for mass appeal? Taste was grainy. It lacks the caramel and raisin flavors of a good bock. Slight sourness toward the back. Finish is dry. If you want to introduced something to newbie beer drinkers and not scare them away, this might be a good starting point."
"Dungeree tells me that this one is a favorite among Texas college students, and I believe him. Comes in a standard 12oz bottle with twist cap. No obvious best by date. Pours a orange amber color. Head is almost non-existent. Does not taste like other bocks I have sampled. Light and hoppy with subtle malt. Nothing to complain about, (except head retention) but nothing interesting either."
"i have had worse bocks sure. but calling this beer a bock is truly a misnomer. its not a great beer regardless, but its a shocker in this category. a waste of quality drinking space when there were plenty of better beers on offer i could have had."
"Now I am very sad. I long for the days when 2 12ers of Shiner was the highlight in my life. Decent score based on mostly memories, as I try to erase this sad moment from my brain. I"
"The body is light and thirst quenching with ample fizz. A good beer for ballgames, brats, and budgets.."
"Pours a nice, tall medium thick head. Took a good minute or more to dissipate. Still a nice 1/8 inch head remained. Showed a medium brown color. Smelled of roasted malts, a slight mustiness, and a hint of a rustic feel. Tasted sweet and lots of roasted malts. Finished very bready. Wet at the beginning with a little bit of dryness at the end. Thin mouthfeel allows for more drinkability. It's easy to knock back a few of these. Shiner Bock won't win any awards, but it is definitely worth trying not only for its flavor but for its place in Texas culture."
" From Baum La Vernia, Tx south of China Grove. I picked up a six of these (Rick got six pack of Busch ""tallboys"") Decent drinkability. Better than ZiegenBock"
"If this beer were a mountain, a tree covered jut of rock and dirt, arcing skyward in defiance of gravity and the forces of nature, admired and adored by all humans and animals, then this would only be an average mountain. Maybe 6000-8000 ft. Not one of the towering 14,000 foot mountains, the massive 20,0000 footers or the infamous 29,000 foot Everest. It was a decent beer, plenty drinkable and for sure tasty. However, it was nothing to shout about."
"I figured I would review this beer, as it has been a staple of my family and friends for as long as I can remember. For me, it is the best beer to swill from the bottle after a hard day's work out in the country. It has a refreshingly evident malt flavor, and even a bit of hops comes through in the finish. While this can still be classified as mass-produced beer, for the price here in Texas you can't go wrong with stocking a cooler full of Shiner for an outing to the country."
"The aroma is light malt and is appropriate for the style, nothing special. The taste is similar to the aroma although some hop shows up on the swallow. Decent body, good carbonation, doesn't have the winey alcohol flavors of most bocks. My sample was just starting to skunk (ordered at Prego in Rice Village, Houston)"
"This was purely an all around average beer. Pours a medium copper color with a medium sized fizzy tan head. Aroma is malty then slightly acidic and then malty again. Roasted grains hold the base of this beer but no other flavors really come out. Slight caramel/toffee sweetness with a mild malt flavoring in the middle. Finish brings a very light dosage of hops and a nice little bit of acidity. Aftertaste is weak though. This beer is average all the way through."
"Drinkability: Certainly a step up from the macros and not unpleasant but there are much more flavorful and representative bocks out there"
"Not bad, not good, simply average. Doesn't really have the body or maltiness for a true bock."
"This seems to be Shiner's most well-known beer, but not their best, in my opinion."
"Very drinkable and not a bad beer, but not a great beer either."
"Drinkability: A nice little quaffer, that I have purchased more than once. It was hard to keep in stock at the liquor store I used to work at. Transplanted Texans would buy by the case and t was not uncommon to sell 3 or 4 cases a week. A nice beer from Texas, definitely better than most macros, and different than your typical macro. I would recommend at least trying."
"The first time I tried this was the weekend of my wedding back in July 2003. A friend brought two cases up from Texas to St. Louis and just raved about how great this tastes. Maybe I had too high expectations from that memory, but it was average at best. No head rentention, very cola colored, no lacing. Rather flat tasting with just a bit of hops to note."
"This is a brown brew with some red undertones. Poured a nice head leaving a bit of lacing as I enjoy this brew. Nose is of bread and sweet malts. Taste is pretty much the same with little hop impact. Mouthfeel is somewhat full and lively. Overall drinkability is good. I have always enjoyed this beer and would recommend it."
"12 ouncer sampled, no indication of freshness to be found. Poured a medium al mond brown, larger bubbles rising to the top at a seady pace. Malty nose, nutty bready brew. Medium bodied, got alot of maple syrup notes. Prickly carbonation not appreciated. Sharp dry finish. Not the best version of the style, never was crazy about this stuff."
"hmmm, i kinda expected more. pours an amber color with a nice 1"" head. the head dissipates quickly and leaves very little lacing. smells mostly of malt, hops, corn maybe. the taste is mainly the bitterness of hops with some malt. it seems to be kinda over carbonated which explains the low mouthfeel rating. too many harsh bubbles. i would drink it again but there are MANY others that i would rather have."
"I finally saw the Texas ""classic"" when I was out shopping in Western Maryland, and decided it was worth giving it a try, even knowing that it's not highly regarded. Well, it's certainly not great, but it beats a macro any day, and though I wouldn't seek it out again, I won't pour it down the drain either."
"I paid six dollars for this. It's not something I will pay money for again. However I would drink one for free."
"UPDATE: 10-26-2004 Found the ABV -- it's 4.4%. Thought this one was pretty ""lite"" for a bock."
"On draught at Pappadeaux in the Houston airport. Glad to finally find this classic Texan beer. Copper-colored with a thin off-white head. Toasted grain and malt in the nose. Medium-bodied with a flavor somewhere between a Bock and an Adjunct Lager. Malt, stale hops and caramel are what the beer offers. The finish is smooth and does not contain much flavor other than some sweet malt. I cant really call this beer a disappointment because it met my expectations. It does not do the Bock style justice though."
"Nothing really great here, but nothing terrible. This is not a bad beer, but it's a quite expensive mediocre one."
"Ok here in minnesota this is hard to come by only like one chain of stores can get it. i desided to try it after my friend talked it up to be the best stuff ever. but i was not impressed it had about the same color as miller altho a little darker and near the same smell and taste. so for my $12 a 6pack i will drink miller"
"Notes: Just too thin and watery with not enough taste to be a really good bock. Not bad though."
"The taste is thin with a bit of malt and diacetyl flavors. Some bread and honey notes as well. Overall though it is not a comples flavor. It is the same beginning to end. In the mouth it is too thin with no significant malt profile. As for its drinkabaility I could see people drinking it everyday if nothing better is around. But it's a weak and uneventful beer no matter if it's in the bottle or on tap."
"A nice bronze color with an off white head leaving occasional lacing. Interesting aroma of caramel malt, peppery yeast, and then a grapevine/raison like scent. Clean malty taste, not hoppy or bitter, and then a wine like finish. Good mouthfeel. A nice beer that I'd order again."
"I love Shiner Bock!"
"I'm not going to turn up my nose if you throw a free one my way, but if I had to pay I'd just as soon leave it for the Texans."
"The main problem here is an odd metallic flavor on the finish, but even if that weren't a problem, it lacks some of the thickness and depth that you can find in other bocks. Even so, it's quite drinkable."
"tastes like brown budweiser. not too good."
"It smells sort of sweet and 'roasty' . Taste is also on the sweet side, but not overly so. Very easy to drink. Its best to pour into a pint glass or get it on tap at the pub. Haven't been to the Spoetzl Brewery yet, but can't wait to have a fresh one there."
"A nice amber colored brew, with a slightly sweet smell, highly carbonated body, and minimal frothy head. On tap, this is a much better beer than in its bottled form, a much fresher tasting brew, with hightened characteristics. I had the brew directly at the Spoetzel brewery a few years ago and enjoyed it imensly, I've yet to have that experience again with this beer."
"Drinking this to compare to the Shiner Bock I had on-tap earlier this week. Appearance is a nice dark copper color, slightly ruby when it hits the light. Smell isn't very strong, slightly sweet smelling, with hint of alcohol smell. Taste is quite nice, not spectacular, but malty enough to enjoy. This is an easily drinkable beer that I could see becoming one of my standard fridge stock. Versus tap the bottle has less of a full mouthfeel and is slightly less malty in flavor. I like it on tap a little better, but the differences are tiny."
"One of my favorite all time brews, but I've had plenty of beers since then that have expanded my horizons. It'll still be an old standby, but with so many new beers to try, there's plenty of other things to drink."
"This went down easy because it makes no demands on the palate whatsoever. It's not a bad session beer, but that's already an overcrowded field, so there's really no need to seek this out, unless you're hankering for a taste of the Lone Star State."
"The neck label actually states that Shiner Bock is 'rich', 'smooth' and 'bold'. 0 for 3 I'd say. Three strikes and you're out."
"Drinkability - my favorite Texas beer when it comes to session picks. Goes down easily, more than a lawnmower beer but not too heavy to enjoy in this Texas heat."
"Thanks to Assurbanipaul for the sample."
"Pours amber-brown with a small off-white head. Malty aroma. Taste is initially sweet malt that gives way to a more toasted malt flavor. Corn adjunct flavors are also apparent. Just enough hops to add a little welcome bitterness to the middle. Thin mouthfeel. Slightly astringent finish. Considerably better than a macro, but not what I'd consider an outstanding beer. Still, it does have it's charm, and is a good example of a style (American Bock) that was once much more popular than it is now."
"Brew pours a golden yellow, very crisp and clear. Very little head. Slightly sweet taste and smell. Little to no hop note present at all. Definately a malt-domminant brew! Nice mouthfeel; an emminently quafable brew. An excellent brew for a summers BBQ, or casual events where you need to bring a beer that won't be wasted on the masses, yet still shows you ""get"" beer."
"I had not tasted a Shiner Bock for a couple of years prior to this review... but fate brought us together in time for this writing. It pours out a nice, deep reddish-amber color. A moderate head quickly formed, and just as quickly disappeared. Not much lacing to talk about either. Smell is a difficult topic for me (not a good sniffer), but it was not particularly strong. Taste is so-so. Nothing bad, but nothing wow. Malty, but I prefer a much maltier flavor. Some carbonation (perhaps a little too much). Not much hop character. Pretty simple, straight forward medium-colored beer. It gets some points on the drinkability scale for being simple (and a little thin) ...but elsewhere it really doesn't stand out from the macro-brewed crowd."
"First off I've yet to find a bock that really made me say wow, that being said this is just another average bock at best. Pours a light brown with hints of red, a slight white head will arise and fall, nothing spectacular. The smell is very malty, otherwise not much detected, the taste is a little to sweet, not many hops detected, caramel malts are in the forefront, very light bodied and not very refreshingly crisp and smooth, dryness. Wouldn't go back to this again anytime soon."
"Had numerous experiences with this brew during the week of April 25 - May 1st on a cruise out of Houston TX. It was a nice change from the Bud and Coors light, Corona, Miller products, etc! Not a bad brew, pours to a copper color with a white bubbly head that fades pretty quickly. The aroma is of slight roasted malt and caramel but they seem to be difficult to pick up. Not a bad smelling brew compared to the macros that where available but not very robust! The taste is similar to the aromas, not much depth but enough going on to make it an enjoyable experience. Was able to handle the hot sticky weather with this brew so it fit the bill. Over all I would get this brew if it was available in NY State once in a while."
"Nice coppery color with medium head. Good carbonation and the lace stayed around. Smell was fresh and malty. Taste was very drinkable. Malty and a hop presence. A little dry mouth feel. This is a very drinkable beer that is becoming more available here in Iowa."
"This one was much better than my recollection of past samplings. This Texan pours a crystal clear, amber, copper body with a one finger, ivory head. The head doesn't last very long, and some minimal patch lacing is left on the pint glass. Aroma has some caramel or toffee notes, and a restrained German(Hallertau?) lager style hoppiness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and features medium carbonation. Taste immediately reveals a lighter body than the mouthfeel. Caramel sweetness is dominant in the flavor profile, but is evenly balanced by the Germanic hops in the background. This is a tasty brew for an American regional, and far above average in that context. Finish is clean and leaves no aftertaste. A very pleasant, drinkability factor, but it's not really a bock or a dunkel lager. To be honest, I'm at a loss on how to caterorize this one, but it's certainly a better tasting brew than I was expecting."
"I've been eying this one for weeks and just picked up a single. Pours a nice deep brown with a small head and good wavy lacing down the glass. The smell is clean and slightly grainy with a hint of bittersweet hops. The taste is similarly clean, but simple, save for a curious series of sweet floral notes at the finish. Otherwise, it's a well balanced if slightly bland brew. Mouthfeel is thin but the drinkability is great and versatile. I can see this being very refreshing and can vouch for its perfect fit with a hearty meal. Decent, average stuff that I might snag again in a pinch."
"This beer is a dark brown colored beer, clear bodied, with a nice foamy white head on top. Fair amount of lacing. The scent is malted lagered water. The taste is more like some of the dunkels ive had than any bock. Its main features are caramel malts, but they are not as upfront or strong as they should be. Not a bad beer, but not worth a repeat purchase."
"Drinkability is good, this stuff was great when drank with BBQ in San Antonio, Texas."
"Although it does not match my memories from several years and owners ago it is drinkable."
"This bottled beer poured a clear medium caramel brown with a short beige head that disappeared quickly. Low carbonation. The aroma was malty sweet and grainy with hint of honey or molasses. The taste was weak and a tad too sweet and could use more hops for a better balance with the malt sweetness. The body was medium to thin. Overall this is an average beer that is easy to drink."
"Its drinkable..its a just above average American lager..I dare say if I lived in deepest Texas this would be a great beer considering."
"Its a decent beer though, and would be a great summer sipper."
"Tastes just like it smells. A little tang at the end, but nothing disrupting. It's just so smooth....it just fills your mouth up so nicely, you could really drink this all night with no problem. This is one solid built beer, very drinkable, but nothing extraordinary."
"I had to ask the bartender if he really poured me a Bock."
"Not a beer I'd ever feel like drinking again, but I'd slug it in a pinch. Considering it's popularity in it's home state, I'm rather relieved that certain Texans are choosing this instead of Lone Star."
"Drinkability: I think I'd rather not repeat this experience ever again. Not the worst beer I've ever had, but certainly among them."
"J"
"Was a regular brown lager in appearance. This beer was as average as it comes. Smooth flavor, but lacking anything special or different. It was better than a macrobrew, but i still wasn't impressed. It's good if you are stuck with that, or AB or Miller products."
"Well this is a standard I drank alot while living in North Carolina because the people I hung out with thought this was a ""special beer"".Pours a amber/brown with a light off white colored head.The aroma is grainy and lightly sweet and a little earthy.Taste is watery in my opinion with some resdual caramel sweetness but not much,not much of a bock for sure."
"This is a pretty bland beer. There are some good tastes lurking, but they're too shy to show themselves confidently. It's kind of like an amber NA with a little more bite and flavor."
"Big thank you to AKSmokedPorter for bringing this Texas legend up to Ohio for me!"
"A nice deep amber to copper color, the head modest and a light tan color, nice sheet of lace to slide down the glass. Crisp malt dominated nose, sweet and fair to middling malt profile with a lean in feel top. Finish is vivacious in its acidity, hops are unimpassioned in their bite, dry aftertaste, a Great Beer, no, but a decent and drinkable beer that is benign and will accompany most food nicely."
"Pours with a deep cream-colored head that recedes over medium dark brown liquid tinged with a touch of redness. Sweet maltiness dominates the nose with a hint of lightly roasted malt. The taste is a light-bodied mix of nicely roasty malt, light nonetheless mixed with a dash of dryness and very very light bitterness...otherwise it's sweet malt all the way. Finishes sweet as well. Very tasty and quite drinkable, a nice Bock all around."
"Shiner Bock was for many years my favorite. Its hard to find now that I live in Virginia so I don't drink it much now. After consuming several hundred gallons of this beer I can tell you this: Don't bother drinking it unless you can get it on draft. Its no good out of the bottle. The carbonation, mouthfeel, flavor, etc. is all wrong. The only way to drink it is on tap. Period. Its a very smooth very drinkable beer on tap."
"Drinkability  This Shiner was indeed a black eye."
"Deep copper brown color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is grainy, malty and sweet. A lightly hopped, medium malted bock. Nice light tasty malty bock. Rich flavor, smooth maltyness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is malty, not bitter."
"Well, I finally got around to reviewing it because I finally got some. My father-in-law gave me what he had left of a 12pack that he bought the other day. Not to say he doesn't like it, he just doesn't drink enough to keep the whole thing to himself. This is one of my old favorites and it was quite a trip to go back and try it after all the others I've now had. Really much different than I remember, but all around still good and refreshing. Goes great with popcorn and football. Still like it, just not the same as before."
"Try this one with a couple of friends, some good Tex-Mex, and a football game. I'm bettin' you'll like it."
"Lance Armstrong's favorite beer. Had this one at the Brickskellar in Washington DC. Amber in color, off-white head. Some faint aromas, malt and some roastiness. Not much in the way of smells here. Taste is smooth, malty and with a nice roasted/smoky flavor, not like a smoked beer, but very roasted. Hops are unable to bust through the smoke. Not bad, probably good with TexMex, it's not a true Bock though. Maybe I should carry this stuff in my water bottles during bike races...maybe not."
"Shiner in the bottle helped the appearance for me by providing a much better pour. It pours a dark amber with a good off-white head though it does fade to a thin film quickly.The aroma is malty as with the taste. The mouth is left alittle tart and dry. The body I thought was alittle thin for a darker brew. An ""ok"" brew for something Texas born and off the beat-n-path, for an ohio guy like myself. Had to try it!!"
"Flavor: Shiner Bock has very little taste. It's not a bock. It's a notch above the megaswills, but that's about it."
"Head sticks around a little longer than the bottled version. Body is clear medium orange-brown. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted light bread, caramel), with a light fruity smell. Flavor is a lightly sweet, acidic, bitter combo. Finish is nice. Light to medium body, watery texture, with lively carbonation."
"Well, the first time I tangled with Shiner was back in Costa Mesa last summer and we had a pretty hot waitress from Texas. I asked what I should order a yard of because I wanted to experience drinking out a vessel that stood three feet tall. Boy I am glad I ordered then what a great beer to drink from a yard not to full bodied or flavored just enough of everything to be enjoyed in that style of drinking beer. Now here I am back home and sitting here noting the visual aspects of this beer it pours amber ruby with an off white cream colored head about two fingers worth and quickly dwindles down to a thin collar of lace only to leave scattered lacing with each sip. Aromatics on this beer are well a little faint with a slight caramel malt tone but no real hop aroma to be found. Taste is creamy buttered caramel malts with faint hop bitterness in the background to balance out the sweetness and touches of dark roasts add to the experience. Mediocre at best with a thin body artificial carbonation, not much of anything special going on. Drinkability is good due to the fact that I can consume alot of this even a yard glass of this, however it's not a quality brew that I would buy religiously."
"Clearish coppery brown with small top of ivory colored foam that doesn't last, lace in minimal spotty fashion. Smell is mostly caramel with a bit of molasses, soft & plain malty nose thats fair but not moderate. Taste is a thinnish caramel malt with a toffee or molasses hinting in some bigger sips, but it really lacks a good flavor punch. Its just enough to take notice but not enough to enjoy really, kinda bland for a bock. Feel is a diluted mess thats a bit watered down and thin for a bock as well. Not much to it. Pass-a-bal!"
"Reddish and auburn color. Medium head. Has a very light and crisp taste. An excellent overall flavor. Just a hint of hops. Leaves a ver pleasing aftertaste. Excellent drinkable beer. Its overall light and easy to drink. But has the body that tells you this is a beer with care and meant to be enjoyed. A very good session beer."
"Carbonation stands out and makes the beer refreshing. Not the heavy feel one might expect. A nice brew to relax with on a summer evening"
"Not a fan, at all."
"Pours a dark-golden color with moderate carbonation and a thin, fizzy head. Slightly hoppy aroma, but nothing even close to the malty, doughy smell that a true bock would have. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Decent hop finish, but nothing outstanding. I'll steer clear of this one in the future."
"Pretty bad. It pours reddish-brown, with next to no head, no lace and no collar. It smells like caramel, and sits heavy-sweet in the mouth. The taste is caramel and sugar. I couldn't find any hops. Saying it tastes like Coke would be doing Coke a disservice."
"Quite thin on the palate with the malt nowhere near as dominating as the nose would indicate. Unfortunately, there is nothing to take the malt's place. The finish is short and watery."
"Shiner is not the Godly nectar folks 'round these parts swear it is. However, it is quite a refreshing beer, good for a hot day and a dry mouth."
"Thanks for introducing me to a Texas Style bock Senior Shit."
"Ordinarily I'm a fan of Bock beers. It's one of the few lager styles that I can tolerate. This stuff, however, ought to be called bock lite or something like that because there's not much to it. Dark amber in color with a thin head. Slighly malty in the nose and even less so in taste. Very, very bland. This was the best available choice in the U.S. Airways terminal at Bush International. I should have had a bottle of water."
"Beer was passable with the fresh oysters I was eating, but not good enough to order a second."
"I'll start by saying that I think the keg of this stuff was about 994 years old. It was a cloudy brown color, and the smell that spewed forth from this stuff was atrocious. Like a malty skunk. The taste was even worse. At first it seemed like it might have a rather pleasant maltiness to it. Then the overpowering bitterness took over, and I cringed, as did everyone else drinking it. People were actually flocking to the Coors Light. Wow. That's saying something right there. Again, it was probably skunked and I would like to try it fresh. Thank God it was free."
"Although I rate this beer below some of my favorites, it has a place at my summer barbecues, while I tend to the pit. It's also the one I serve to guests who ask for MGD or Miller Lite."
"It's like they stop the brewing process too soon or something, just not delivering everything that the appearance promises. In Texas this beer is on tap everywhere, and I've grown used to it over the years. I just wish it was 20% better than it really is, since it looks 100% tasty but only delivers ~ 80% of the taste I expect. What's really weird, is every time I drink it, I'm a little disappointed, every time. You'd think I'd be used to it by now. A TV actress of a beer, it always looks good but there's just not all that much there."
"It looked and poured a medium dark brown with little to no head. The smell was of malts and hops, nothing outstanding. The taste of this bock had a no nothing flavor, blah and boring. I can't understand why some people rave about this beer! They should keep all the six packs in Texas!"
"Pass."
"Oh Well - Another one bites the dust. : - ("
"When poured, the color was dark amber with a quick dissolving light tan head. I wasnt able to identify a distinct odor while drinking. It had a very quick spicy snap to it with a slight sweet taste on the sides of my mouth and leaving a dry after taste. The beer actually had a slight flatness to it, didnt seem to have a lot of carbonation. It is a nice change to the mainstream beers you advertised on TV during the football games and not pass one up if offered."
"Pours a clear brownish amber color with a creamy white head and a light aroma of sweet malt. It has a crisp flavor with notes of caramel and goes down so easy its a little scary. As others have mentioned, one of the best features of this brew is that no matter how small the bar in Texas you find yourself in, they are almost guaranteed to carry it."
"I would not recommend it or drink it again, in all likelihood."
"Was it worth the bottle of traditional Gueuze? - Hell No !!!!"
"This beer is a staple in my diet. It's got a nice dark brown slighty red color. It pours so easily without ever get to thick of a head. The foam is nice, it fades quickly and leaves almost no lace. The smell isn't one of my favorites (don't get me wrong, I like the smell but mostly because it is one of my favorite beers). It has an excellent mouthfeel with with the caramel flavors and all. It's drinkability truely exceptional whether you slowly drink it down or are just chugging away at a party. In my opinion, defeniently one of the best beers ever brewed."
"body. I hope they can get it up to my area in the future."
"Pours a dark tea color with excellent clarity with an off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly.  Pretty pleasing to the eye.  The smell is that of slight caramel tones, but not much else and definitely not real obvious.  Has an extremely crisp taste with hop/carbo bite on the nose and a very mild (too mild) finish.  I believe maybe there's decent stuff in here, but they are ""riding the fence"" on flavor maybe to get people to convert from an even lesser complex brew like you know...the biggies.  The mouthfeel is clean and and light bodied.  Not too bad, and a good stand-by beer.  And best of all, it's in Tejas (from German roots).  Prosit!"
"This is not número uno (number one) on my runway."
"Dark amber brownish color, with a slight tan head. Head settled and left quickly. Smell was very much malty sweetness, and some sourness to it. Lots of sweet malt taste, lacked any real hop balance. Was a bit more watery and thin than I remembered. Mostly an average beer, I remember this being much better. Needs a little hops for balance, and less watery feel and I think they might have something worthwhile......."
"This is an average beer. It pours a dark amber color and has a very slight malty smell. Its not really a bock style more of an amber ale. This beer isnt really bad, but its just not as great as some people think. But in a pinch its a good beer, around here its on tap at most any resteraunt or bar. Its a nice beer for taking to the lake or camping, but there are many beers i would pick over this one for daily drinking."
"This is slightly worse than Michelob Amber Bock. It is OK if nothing else besides regular Bud/Miller/Coors beers are available. At least it has some darker malts in it to give it a little sweetness. But...it is ruined by a cheaper, adjuncty, watered down overall flavor and inferior hops compared to Amber Bock, as if they put enough hops in these pseudo-bocks in the first place. The stores are too damn proud of this product--let's drop the price down a little, OK? It would be nice to have a darker beer that tastes cheap to actually BE cheap!"
"Pours a nice dark amber/light brown with a small tan head that runs away very quickly.  The smell is of slight malt and adjuncts.  Taste is fairly bland with some light malt sweetness.  Adjunct taste is also present.  Very fizzy on the tongue and down the throat.  This brew is somewhat drinkable mainly because of its lack of flavor.  It seems to be a trend among the Shiner line to be bland and tasteless.  It tastes like someone took a pretty good tasting beer and poured a bunch of water in it.  I won't buy it again."
"The dense sticky head tops a crystal clear bronze hued brew.  There's good lace left-- the number of sips taken to finish the beer is countable.  (I love that)  Unfortunately, this beer falls short after that. Just a hint of graininess and grassy Saaz hop in aroma, but there's not much else there.  The VERY mild toasted malt flavors dominate and the weak hop bitterness leave the beer a tad sweet.  It's got a bit more body than the norm for style, but the overall lack of flavor make this a run of the mill American dark lager.  Finishes w/ a hint of bready malt notes and residual sweetness.  Wow-- this is the best bock I've ever had! : )"
"A typical American macro lager with color. Spoetzl Brewery should be fined for the gross misrepresentation of this brew (Bock, right?) I let it warm up to try and find a redeeming quality, but it just got worse. I ask you, what is the point? If you want a pretty beer buy Shiner Bock. If you want flavor buy something else."
"It looks pretty nice, but the experience goes downhill from there.  I drank it on draught over three nights at three different bars and received a beer with no head and little carbonation.  The flavor was bland and uninspired.  It felt like it was sticking to the inside of my mouth after I finished my first pint.  I gave it more than a fair shake based on numerous recommendations by Texans, but it's nothing special."
"Deep red amber in color with a decent off-white head.  Aroma is mostly of alcohol and a little maltiness, in general, a bit weak.  The taste was less than I expected, certainly seemed watery for a bock, a little malt and some faint hop notes.  Better than the worst of the major beers, but that is not saying much.  Much better bock-style beers are readily had."
"The color is kind of cool, like a well-brewed glass of iced tea. Being a southerner, I can appreciate that. A foamy head dissipates quickly. Nothing spectacular in smell or tast. It's like most of the macros, but a hell of a lot better."
"It must have been partly cloudy when the Beer gods were shining down on this beer..For a bock it is very light in body..almost watery...BUT it does have a good taste to it (although the taste is faint)...definitely on the malty side...maybe more of a vienna style...I get ZERO hopping on this....The BA review (which I usually try not to read before doing my as to not influence my opinion) mentioned caramel and I definitely agree with that...the malt taste is not heavy but there...seems easy on the mouth and would be pretty easy drinking overall...Just not as much body as I expect in a bock...copper in color...big frothy head that dissipates into nearly nothing in moments..."
"Last time I was visiting a buddy in College Station I picked up a six of these (he favored twelve packs of Busch ""tallboys"")...medium brown color, sticky head.  Very butterscotchy and the other malt tastes are vaguely syrupy, though not heavy-bodied at all...Too sweet for me but decent drinkability."
"Notes: Not a bad brew but it leaves the taste buds short on flavour for what a bock should be, for an American Dark Lager it hold up well and is a step above the big guys."
"Raw and unrefined, with an abrasive alcohol presence."
"Notes: Not impressed at all. Purchased and consumed on Northwest Airlines (Detroit to Boston)."
