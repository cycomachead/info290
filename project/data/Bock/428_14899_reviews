"What a fantastic special beer.  Light bock flavors, sweet cream, and hints of licorice abound in a German way.  Got to add this to the Christmas beer wishlist on a regular basis from now on."

"Pours a nice copper color with an off white head. The smell is semi-sweet with a lot of great malt and bread scents coming through with some light citrus. The taste was nice with a thick amount of malt in the beginning which trails off into light orange peel for a pleasant finish. I really enjoyed this one and will likely have it again."
""
"Not that it's not good, it's just...you know...like candy canes...great when you have one & not so bad when you don't. In the not so bad, but bad enough for once a year family member category. Make sense?"
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden body with average retention and almost no lacing. Kind of boring. Aroma is brown bread and flavor expands on that with spices that grow in intensity as it warms. Smooth and chewy, it's decent enough; just needs to work on its appearance."
""
""
""

"Nice flavor. Slight hop bite, maltiness, cracker like, bready, quite refreshing. The mouthfeel is great. Not too thin and not too chewy. A decent beer. Got this on sale at Total Wine for $1.99- Totally worth it!"
""
""
""
"Just not very pleasant to drink. Artificial sweet malts and paper tastes, doesn't really resemble a bock. Especially after enjoying Weissenohe Monk's Christkindl recently this seems like a disgrace to the style, and kinda to beer in general."

"overall, an exceptional brew! not an entirely complex beer, but for the style this is something i'd endeavor to find out of the tap in a nice, dark, warm ambience."
""
""
""
"Pours a very clear pale, nearly amber in color. Aroma is clean and nutty, some hint of barley grist. Flavor is clean like a pilsner and turns thicker with some smoke and umami. Coppery aftertaste with some fruity, nectary hops. Feel is more watery than anything with medium carbonation, but tending towards flat. Finish is somewhat sweet, but mostly balanced. This is nothing special. I'm not one for bocks, but this doesn't taste like a bock or a pilsner. Not bad, but not good either."
"O: As a Christmas beer I feel lack of spice was really a downer. A good beer that is easy drinking and enjoyable but not a Christmas miracle. A solid offering none the less."
""
"It pours a beautiful golden color with a white head that fades fast. It smells of fresh baked bread and yeast. The taste starts malty, yeasty, and sweet and then delicately fades into a mildly bitter hop finish. The malt and yeast never really give up their grasp on your tongue though. In fact, the malt and yeast can be tasted long after the hops have faded from the palate. The carbonation is a bit on the heavy side, but the thick/creamy mouthfeel counteracts it beautifully. This beer was a new experience for me. I usually target hop forward beers that are intensely bitter, but this one was a bit different. Thoroughly enjoyable, but completely out of my normal beer style."
""
"A nice enough beer."
"Overall a tasty winter bock. Light and enjoyable."
""
"I will put thisup for review again perhaps it's a misrepresentation."
"OVERALL: A no frills, solid bock that will warm you on a cold night."
"Poured into a large brandy snifter. Pours clear caramel brown with a white head that doesn't stick around for very long. There is a moderate amount of visible bubbles rising in the beer. The aroma is sweet like caramel with some chocolate and bread. The hops are a little grassy and mildly spicy on the nose. The flavor is biscuit like with sweet caramel. The hops are grassy and spicy, providing some nice flavor and some back end bitterness. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
"Overall, the best thing about this brew was the flashes of sweetness through the flavoring. Otherwise they really missed the stylistic mark here. Off the bat the coloring was far too light, while the nose gave an overly sweet, crazily adjuncty grain bill. There was little depth or roast to support it. The flavor ran into the same problems, with nothing robust enough to drive the beer home."
"16.9oz. bottle: This one pours a darker, clear caramel color. There was a very small tan head that didn’t linger long or leave any lacing. The aroma is OK. Caramel malts, hints of biscuit, subtle fruits, some earthy hops and maybe a hint of spices. The taste is OK. Some caramel malt sweetness with a hint of spices. Mild earthy hops. Maybe a hint of breadiness. Decent enough, but I’m glad it was on sale. Don’t think it was worth the original $5.99/bottle."

"Overall quite a hoppy bock that has some Christmas spicing. Might not get it again but it was worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"A somewhat cloudy golden color with a white head. Intense aroma of cider, apple juice, and cardboard. There is a touch of spice to it and a strong sweetness. The flavor is no better. Lots of cardboard and paper with a green apple flavor, a touch of cider, and sugar. Not really even much in the way of malt flavor to be found here. Thin and watery to boot."
""
"O: Typically Bocks are much too sweet for my tastes, but you can tell that this one is crafted very well and the touch of hop doesn't make is so one dimensional. Good beer."
""
""
"I wanted to like this one more, but it seems a bit on the heavy side of things. I would expect a bit more smoothness for a lager/bock. Decent, probably okay for the style, but not something to get real excited about."
"Interesting blend, but a bit thicker than most."
""
"Pours a clear golden orange with a 1 inch puffy bone colored head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random dots of lace slowly drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some grape like fruity aromas. There is also a slight metallic aroma on this one. Taste is very much the same even down to the metallic flavor. There is a medium astringent bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I was expecting something much different."
"A nice traditional german bock. Definitely tastes like an amped up version of a munich lager"
""
""
"Overall – a very good brew. Interesting to taste and think about, and a pleasure to drink."
"Nice medium mouth feel and carbination makes this a very easy drinker. For me, this is spot on as far as style description goes and would be an easy brew to have in the fridge on a regular basis. An A- bock in my book."
""
"I could see making this a Christmas tradition. Well rounded and flavorful."
"Overall, a strong and hardy Christmas lager. Perfect for a holiday afternoon relaxing by the fire. This bock is simple yet excellent. A prime example of German brewing excellence and why sometimes less is more."
"Strong aroma has malty, caramel, molasses, yeast and cloves notes, very appealing. It pours a nice clear amber with a typical ivory head. Flavor has fruity, malty and earth notes as well as a hint of cloves. Texture is smooth, average-bodied and just a bit slimy, with minimum fizz. Merry whatever-you-celebrate-this-time-of-year!"
"Mahr's Christmas Bock is very drinkable, and I was surprised by the low ABV. However, it isn't a terribly complex or interesting beer. Though a pleasant beer to accompany a meal, it isn't really worth seeking out."
""
"Taste begins with a nice malty flavor along with noble hops. This quickly fades, though into a bitter cough syrup flavor. The bitterness continues and becomes quite harsh. I'm not sure if it's the age of this beer or just the way it is but it is not one of my favorites."
""
"Highly drinkable brew. Tasty, with enough complexity to be a fine beverage for the winter months."
"Overall not bad, most of the Mahr's beers are phenomenal, this is good but not at usual standards for them IMO. But still decent and drinkable."
"Label says ""Bottled on: 701U"". Well... that's useful. It might be a little old. The beer poured with hardly any carbonation, and only the smallest bit of foam. The aroma is decent, dominated by a nice toasted-breadcrust malt, rich and sweet. Flavor , though is disappointing. It's malty, but it's harsh and sweet, without any normal munich subtleness. Bitterness is restrained, yeast character neutral... just not a very interesting beer."
"This beer poured out as a golden orange color with a pretty good head on it. The lacing was decent but not great. The smell of the see doesn't really shout Christmas at me. The aromas do have some fruity grains on the nose though. The taste has bready and lightly fruity flavors going on throughout. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall not really a holiday beer in my opinion but still nice to try."
"An alright bock, would try it again if I knew I was getting a fresh sample"
"This is a good, tasty bock beer. Nice example of the style with a little winter twist mixed in."
"O- I've changed my mind a bit on this brew and now find it to be very refreshing, almost beautiful lager, but it lacks a Christmas Feel."
"The aroma consists of a touch of caramel, some nutty Munich malty sweetness. There is a classic German lager yeast character to both the nose and on the palate. In the flavor, a touch of toasted malt combines with the nutty malts from the aroma. This is really a solid example of a bock, and since this had about a year on it at the time of consumption, perhaps this could hold up well and continue to improve. This is just awesome. I'd pick up a lot more of this, as it is perfectly textured and a very good representation of the style. Bamberger hits the mark on this one."
"If ever in Bamberg, check out the Mahr's ""gasthaus"" - built in 1670 - There is no better place to drink a Mahr's."
"D: Fantastic. I find everything about this beer spot-on and could far too easily drink it by the liter, morning, noon, or night."
"Good enough to enjoy just this one."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Clear medium orange color with a average to large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, white to off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, toasted, straw, caramel, sweet, apple, toffee, sugar. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily to creamy, carbonation is soft to lively, finish feel is light metalic. Does not fit the winter/christmas brew concept, but good beer overall."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, malty, sugar filled, and gently spiced."
"D: This beer is rather drinkable for the style because it isn't that filling."
"I'll always have a soft spot for this beer, which I first tried after it was gifted to me on Christmas Eve, and which spurred my journey into craft beer and, in that sense, may be the greatest gift I've ever received. If you have any beer drinkers on your shopping list who you'd like to see get into better beer, give them the gift of a German bock."
"Not really a lot to this beer. :("
"Not a bad beer, but it doesn't seem to style. Many people have already said it, but it doesn't hurt to reiterate-there's nothing christmas-y about this one. Its quite pale, not spiced, and frankly seems more like a helles bock or maibock than a christmas beer. Still, quite drinkable. I tried not to dock it too hard for being so out of place, but if I were to judge this as a Christmas beer, it would be in the ""C" range at the highest."
"Overall: A nice German holiday beer. Unlike many Christmas seasonal releases, this beer is not heavy or extremely complex. It has some nice sweet malt with a spine of hops. Is an enjoyable beer, but if you are looking for the typical heavy seasonal, this beer is not for you."
"D: I expected a so-called Christmas bock to be a bit darker, but the flavours are excellent especially for a lighter bock, a style I'm not not the biggest fan of. For my tastes a springtime brew, but in CA let's go Yuletide."
"In general I don't think I'm as much of a fan of the pale bocks, but this is still a great example of the style for those that do."
"This German special shows a clear yellow gold color with a decent spotty white cover and excellent lacing. The aroma says clean fruit and wheat, white grapes. Pleasant. The flavor is similar with mellow wheat and sweet grape. It's nicely blended in a solid medium bodied brew that is very drinkable. The feel is smooth and easy with fair carbonation to keep it lively. This is hard to describe but is plenty enjoyable, oddly mild for the style yet not wimpy. A very solid bock though I'm not sure I get the Christmas connection. Nice label though!"
"Creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation make this very drinkable - delicious! I don't know what makes it a Christmas Bock though...."
"Pours a yellowish straw coloured body with a white head that was gone in seconds. Aroma was hoppy ,lemony, grassy, and of grains and pale malts.. Taste was bitter-sweet, wheat, and slight caramel. Nice bitter bite here but I am not sure this is what I expected."
"Poured into a pilsner style glass. Poured a clear golden yellow with a big fluffy head that hung around for a while until going into a thick film that laced pretty good. Aroma wise I only got a slight sour wiff. Very malty and sweet with only the tiny hint of hops. Was suprised by this beer was expecting a darker brew but more maibock in style. Very mellow and easy drinking."
"D: Different, but a decent drinker."
"Pours medium-dark brown with an off-white head. The aroma is malt with some spices. Smell is reminiscent of the spices you find in an apple pie. The flavor is lacking. What is there is sweet malt with some cherry and spices. Medium body and carbonation."
"Overall, a decent beer, though for the life of me I can't tell you what's ""Christmas"" about this beer."
"Drinkability would be OK if this were a better tasting brew."
"Fuller bodied and much more complex and flavorful than expected based on it's appearance. A good amount of bready yeast contributes to the fullness of the body. There is also a light crisp fruit presence, mostly of apple, pear and subtle citrus. Lots of dry crisp wintery spice notes, especially hints of peppery zest, cinnamon and Christmas pastries. Sweet with a nice balance of subtle malt and spice with a dry finish."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this one. Worth giving this one a try."
"This is very easy to understand, easy to appreciate beer from Mahrs. Sure, it's nothing extraordinairy, but it's very easy to enjoy and appreciate."
"Not so great bock. This beer is just too sweet. It tastes a bit like a simple unhopped beer in an unpleasant, malt extract way. The beer is a hazy amber-brown with a rocky white that dissipates quickly. The aroma is mostly caramel and malt. The flavor is sweet with a bad finish. The mouthfeel is too thin and a bit sticky. I won't be buying this again."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable, flavors aren't overly complex and just a nicely spiced christmas bock that gets the palate in the mood of winter!"
"This on has held up well, good thing it was kept cold from last year."
"A pretty good Bock. The nose is a little off, though overall a good beer. Something worth trying."
"Overall, this is an okay beer."
"On tap at the Dirty Truth in Northampton, MA. Poured into a Mahrs seidel."
"Pours a clear, dark amber-brown with a sizable light-tan head. The foam sits around for a while, eventually receding to a film with a nice amount of lacing. Smells faint at first, but after letting it warm quite a bit, I get slightly sweet caramel malt and plenty of fruit (black cherry?)--easily the most I've encountered in a lager. Toasted dark malts give it a nice roasty flavor; quite hoppy as well. More fruit here as well. Very nice and quite flavorful. Mouthfeel is also good: thick on the palate with perfect light carbonation. I could drink this all day. An excellent lager--subtle, yet full of flavor."
"This beer poured an attractive copper color with decent head that stuck around a little while. Aroma was of sweet maltiness and maybe some yeast. Flavor is the same with the additon of some dark fruits. Mouthfeel is correct for the style. Lacing was minimal. This is a decent beer."
"The taste is quite good. Lots of roasted malts, huge caramel bouquet, brown sugar and honey notes come through in the mid section. The beer has a sweet, yet strong, ABV presence throughout. There is a definite dextrin sweetness from the malts, but a slightly biting spiciness as well, and perhaps that is what the Xmas in the label is all about. Otherwise, this tastes a whole lot like most other bocks you find. The caramel malts, the ABV presence, the slightly bittering aftertaste coupled with the spicy bite, pretty much define this bock. The carbonation is moderate. The beer isn't syrupy, but the aftertaste does have a touch of the throaty ABV burn. The beer is largely representative of the style."
"EDIT: Had a fresher bottle in early 2012 and enjoyed it quite a bit. It isn't amazing, but a nice easy drinking malt-forward beer."
"M&D--I may be off with the mouthfeel, but I expected something a bit fuller, bit more creamy. This is a bit too biting, acidic next to the spice. Drinkability is great as with most lagers (just as a side note: my bottle reads 6.0% ABV rather than 6.5. Dunno if it changes every year or what.)"
"I think this is one of the better bocks I've ever had."
"I loved the bottle. It has a very grainy and yeasty smell with some fruit. It had the perfect amount of beige head and lace both was frothy and thick. This beer has a copper body with a brass hue. The taste is grainy it is slightly beany in the aftertaste. It is a very metallic beer. The mouthfeel is slick with a bit of carbonation bite."
"EDIT - As this beer warmed it did lose some of it's metallic taste but it did still linger a touch on the back end."
"6/3/6/3/12/3.0"
"the drinkability is good dispite the sweetness being a touch overboard. this isn't the first beer i'd grab when i wanted a bock, but it's a good beer none the less, and makes a good holiday offering."
"Edit: this isn't a drainpour.. but the metallic component is still there... not good."
"Pours orangeish brown(looks like quality sun tea) with a small cap of tan foam that leaves no lacing. The nose smells of toasted bread crust and cinnamon,maybe just a hint of caramelized fruits. This tastes of over ripened bananas and a good amount of spice. A bit tart in places,with ginger bread flavors and a touch of alcohol. A metallic finish is my only gripe,it's smooth all the way till the finish and then it takes a sharp turn,like a guitar where only five strings are in tune. Still a good beer and a interesting Christmas Bock."
"Solid bock, nothing too unique, but a nice change of pace since I've been feasting on IPAs lately. Malty smoothness with a nice aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine, but strenghtens in the 5-10 seconds after the beer passes through the mouth. Improves as it warms. I'm drinking it in a nice ceramic Paulaner stein, and believe it adds to my experience. If you enjoy Bocks, you'll enjoy this beer."
"Palate offers a mixed dessert spice variety, with hard to pin down flavors. Low carbonation and light bodied. Finish & aftertaste is also very tea like."
"Decent bock, certainly not great though."
"Wonderfully low carbonation lets the rich maltiness seep into every nook and cranny of the mouth. It's really the hops that clean the palate for the next sip, and boy, I can't wait to take the next one. Perilously drinkable. I promise myself that I'll buy a keg of it next year."
"All in all, an OK bock and beer. Yet as far as Christmas bock goes, this hardly qualifies. I won't find myself beating a path to the store to grab this."
"This is a great choice for someone to warm up in colder weather with something on the sweet & malty side, perhaps even as an after-dinner brew to balance out heavier foods consumed in wintertime."
"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades slowly to a ring leaving some lace. Clear, deep mahogany color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Almost malty nose. Flavor is almost sweet malty with spices, some honey. $5.45 for a 500ml bottle from John's Marketplace Portland, OR."
"D: Good flavor and drinkability."
"Mahr's has an excellent example of a restrained, drinkable spiced Bock here. I really dug it and you will too."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquor, Tucson AZ"
"Poured the 16.9 oz bottle vigorously into tall glass leaving behind a small amount of brown sediment. White lacing stayed all the way until the end. Beer is a deep ruddy red and translucent blood crimson when held against a light background, sort of like name brand cranberry cocktail. Dark, warm bread aromas with a bit of spice (spicy hops or real spice, I cannot decipher). Moderate hop bitterness present at all times which balances this medium bodied and mildly astringent bock. A little smokey too. Interesting. I was not expecting this level of bitterness, but it could be from a well balanced spice addition. As of late I've been drinking Atwater's Winter Bock which is actually quite similar in regards to IBUs and SRM."
"On tap at the Dive in Worcester,MA. I expect a Christmas Bock to have a stonger spicy presence, and this ale is a little disappointed. Some spice notes, but not enough to make me consider is a Christmas(or any other holiday)Bock. The Harpoon Winter Warmer is spicier. Mahrs has some spice, some good taste, pours a deep amber, a good aroma, but nothing special."
"1038"
"D: The overall rating for this one is spot on. Decent and average. Easy to drink, but nothing special."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Age has mellowed the alcohol, but that's all I can really tell. Not sure if i'll pick this up again, it was pretty overpriced around $5-6."
"The beer depart the 500ml bottle a deep golden amber color with a capacious creamy off white head, as it slowly erodes, the residual lace provides a tight sheet upon the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, chased by caramel and a herbal tone, citrus like in its crispness, start has a rich malt sweetness, touches of hops and spices, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish has an enticing hop spicy bite, the acidity meaningful, aftertaste droughty, long lasting, a nice beer that went down smooth, glad I bought a few to sample as it worthy of a sample."
"This one has interesting qualities - I'm guessing better around Christmas time, as that is the theme - I love these cryptic dates - Bottled on 5053 - DUH! Anyway, it didn't thrill me, I'll try it again in the winter and update review if appropriate."
"Opinion: Well, I am obviously trying this beer after its prime. I would certainly like to try it again when it is in better shape so that I can make an honest opinion. This beer has some evident age, and this style is so light flavored as it is...it can't take any flaws. I think that this beer is worth giving another shot to...so it is definitely ""worth a try"" even in the state that I am drinking it in."
"I get two solid fingers of bubbley off-white head to form on top of this rich deep brown body. Leaves a bit of lace as bubbles fade. Nose is of raw wheat, clay like earhty tones, and a slight bit of honey infused malt. Vibrant and alive as it hits the tongue. Slightly sour with honey like sweetness. A hint of earthy malt and bitter wheat twords the end of the palate. Leaves a slightly malty, light wheat bitter feel on the mouth. Smooth and subtle, but not very christmas like for such a seasonal brew."
"Poured out an iced tea color with a chunky off white head, lots of lacing. The nose has lots of alcohol, some raisin, yeast, and good malt characteristics. The taste is mostly alcohol and prune, sticky sweet. There's also some other fruityness going on, like fake cherry. The mouthfeel is mild, lightly carbonated, and finishes a bit cloying. Moderately drinkable."
"a solid beer, it does what it is supposed to, nothing quirky, just straight up german brewing, pick a wurst and grab a stein... would play well off some spicy potato soup."
"Cheers!"
"D: OK beer. Seems sort of akward compared to most ultra refined German brews."
"Drinkability is good overall but the long spice finish wears on the palate after a bottle. Quite a tasty holiday brew."
"Drinkability: An interesting , kinda complex , and tasty "" christmas bock""/maibock. Worth a try."
"pours out a hazy amber colour with a snow white head. lacing evident on the glass. rich malty sweet aroma. spicy aroma of toffee, chocolate, figs, cherries, caramel apples....oh yummy! taste is of apple pie, figs, pale malts, an oaken earthiness, alcohol spice and plenty of hops. the tastiest maibock/helles bock i've ever tasted! damn tasty stuff. the body of this bock is rock solid and the mouthfeel is lagerish, but has silky spots as it goes down. x-mas pudding in a bottle...a splendid work of art for a bock beer. it sends shivers up and down my spine it's so good. drinkability is wonderful...it's so flavourful for a x-mas themed bock style beer. i'd drink this until i couldn't see straight."
"Poured a slightly cloudy/murky looking orange-yellow color with a medium level of carbonation. A thin white forms and lingers during the entire session leaving behind a touch of lacing. Aroams of grains, honey, ripe fruit, and toasted bread; heavy on the honey and bread. The taste is sweet, dominated by malt and fruit tones. Relatively mellow with a crisp center that seems to lead into the final bitter finish. Slightly chewy with a creamy texture. Easy to sip and quite flavorful. Certainly not my favorite Maibock/Helles Bock, but overall a good example of the style with some interesting spice and fruit undertones."
"Pours a deep orange color topped by a half-inch of creamy white head that leaves a good bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma of rich, sweet, fruity malt, with notes of caramel apple and muscadine grapes. Palate is more rich fruity sweetness, with some more subdued caramel malt notes taking over mid-palate. Finish is again sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Body is a little thin for a strong bock. A little too sweet to drink in large quantities, but still a nice treat around the holidays."
"I really like the full rich malt quality of this beer, and it would be perfect for sipping by the fire on a cold winters night. Nothing overly fancy, just a fantastic bock."
"Malty and very lightly spiced. No head on this in my very clean glass, very light lacing and quick fall. Aroma was more of Christmas spices with notes of cloves and cinnamon. Spice aspect absent in flavor with a heavy malt note and minor molasses thickness. Good for someone who wants a Christmas beer, but not one that hits you over the head with spices."
"I wouldn't turn one of these down....I also wouldn't go out searching for this either...."
"Pours very pale for a bock Yellow orange with a thin head of medium tan bubbles. Aroma is of light colored dry fruit. Dried peaches. First sip brings out the smoke flavor that I was expecting from a beer from Bamberger. Hints of smoke up front, yielding to fruit for a moment, then a long nice balance of smoke and fruit in the aftertaste. Not quite what I was expecting from a Christmas Bock, but good none the less. Be sure to note this is a Helles Bock, not a dopplebock."
"This bock poured a cloudy, light brown color with creamy, tan foam that settled and clung to the glass, leaving light lace. The smell was malty with some grain and a hint of sweetness. (The aroma was reminiscent of the Mahr's U.) The taste was somewhat bready malt with a light hop spiciness. The mild initial hoppiness built to a nice hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with medium body and low carbonation. The aftertaste was a very nice malt flavor. This was a nice, easy drinking Bock, with the alcohol well hidden."
"Overall: The Fifth of Six Mahrs Brau beers that each cost me $3.99 at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. This one was impressive and I finished the half-litre bottle with an immediate wanting another one feel. Recommended."
"A good, but not a great, beer from Mahrs. I'd buy another helles before I bought this one again."
"Drinkability is quite good. I enjoyed this 1/2 liter well and could really go for another one or two. Too bad I can't get this beer in Michigan."
"D: Drinkable over an evening, definately worth having again. (4)"
"Taste: The beer has a great light caramel flavor. The hops complement the malt very well in this beer and the bitterness enters the pallet almost as an after thought. Im not really even sure this beer is a Maibock it doesnt taste like it was made with lager yeast and there also has to be some wheat in this beer as well very a typical."
"Not a great seasonal, but you get what you pay for. Cost me $1 at my local beer store."
"Taste- Pretty sweet brew. Sweet as in brown sugar and plums. With a good dousing of Maui sweet bread throughout."
"This is a light, clear caramel colored beer with a thin off-white head. The aroma is simple caramel malt. The beer has a very sweet, sugary, caramel taste with nothing to balance it out. I'm not very into this. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. No problem finishing this but I don't want more."
"Pours a cloudy orange with an nice sized, off white head from a 25 ounce brown bottle (incidentally, I like the label). Very malty aroma. I actually get more hop taste than I expected from this beer, it does have a strong malt character though. I think its pretty good, not as malty as I expect from a bock but quite good. Definitely worth trying."
"I found it damn easy to drink. I think I enjoyed this on-tap at the Huber-Haus last December but I cant remember! How freaking lame is that! Maybe it wasnt that good no, I think I just have drunk too much beer at the Huber-Haus in-between! I do know I purchased this bottle to-go from the Huber. I will remember to drink more next year I will not forget how tasty it is. Recommended."
"Drinkability - this beer goes down smooth and easy and is a fine session beer for the cooler temps."
"This seasonal produced a wonderful head; one that was firm, cloudy, largely beaded and well sustained. The color of the brew itself was caramel-golden and abundantly clear. The nose was very sweet with hints of molasses and fig. I would say the mouthfeel was fairly thick, borderline syrupy but not quite. There is definitely a juicy malt and fresh biscuity overall feel to the beer. Clearly, plummy and sweet tobacco characteristics stands out at first and then slowly transforms in to some type of marmelade toast flavor (?). The malt dominance keep everything creamy and smooth throughout. The finish remains sweet with carameled fruit and also leaves a bit of a gritty dryness. Very average IMO."
"Pours a clear liquidhoney colored with an initially large white head. The head quickly settles and all but disappears. Theres a pleasing malt aroma. The aroma could be a little more intense, but its appropriate and makes for a nice centerpiece for the brew. Very little roasted characteralmost no hop presence. Its not cloying, but is notably sweet and bready. Medium body and very satisfying. I really enjoyed this one."
"Cheers to Mahr's!"
"Color is a watery, tea-colored brown, with very little head or carbonation. Very pleasant malty aroma. Taste is a fairly thin malty experience, with a decent amount of bitterness provided by the hops. The bitterness seems to make up the majority of the aftertaste. One of my first experiences with the maibock style; not bad, but I'll take a doppelbock over this any day."
"Drinkability: Although I am hard-pressed to think of this as a Christmas beer, the Germans are not known for that genre so that may explain it; nonetheless, I really enjoyed this beer and view it among the best Maibocks I have tasted"
"The flavor is not so much honey as clover and pollen. Very spring-like. As if I am walking through some cow field up in Vermont. The malts are sweet and lend just a tad of sourness. Kind of a sourdought bread thing going on. Hop are very mild and are mostly come across as grassy. Mouthfeel is a tad bit more than medium body but with a just slightly dry finish. Nice sipping beer but more than one of these might be difficult because I found all the sweet and doughy malts a bit puckerish to really enjoy too many of these in one sitting."
"I'm definately into this beer at the moment. It's the perfect oxymoron of subtlety and complexity. Pours a very clear and crisp orange color, with a nice bubbly and long lasting head. Vibrant and translucent. Smells of pale malts, spicy grains and yeast, dusty hops, and a touch of honey. That honey taste comes up to the front in the taste, but remains subtle. Wow, that sweetness is really dead on. A nice light, bready maltiness, and an interesting balance of spices and herbal and slightly spicy hops. Low bitterness, but a nice warming kick of alcohol compliments the quiet hop profile. The sweet and spicy combination of this beer reminds me of a Belgian tripel, yet this beer has the crisp clean bite of a top fermented lager. Yes that might sound like a stretch, but I'm sure there must be some common ingredients, not that I'm claiming to know what they are. Maybe it's the bottle conditioning... So clean. Really interesting. So refreshing and drinkable, yet suitably wintery. This is pretty much what I'll be drinking til the snow starts to melt..."
"You have to love the Germans. While everyone else is putting out holiday ales that are either spiced or hopped to the heavens, the Deutschland takes this time of year to put out a malt bomb. Why not? Its what they do best. Dark amber color, very clear with a light, fluffy white head. The nose is all malt with a rich caramel/toffee aroma. The taste is very sweet and malty. Loads of caramel and toffee, a hint of dates, and just a touch of hop bitterness. It really doesnt come across as citrus, it just accents the malt. Rich, thick mouth feel, and a high drinkability."
"I thought this was a good beer. Had a nice spicey/fruity smell, with a spicey/fruity taste. You could taste a little alcohol in it, but that was ok. It didn't ruin the taste one bit. The head was a big frothy one, with a little sticky residue around the glass. All in all a good bock beer. I'd think it'd be a good intro beer."
"It's medium bodied but the carbonation is a bit lacking, making the mouthfeel a bit too sticky for my liking. Drinkability is not great. I won't be purchasing any more of these. Mahr's usually makes such fantastic beer!"
"500 ml bottle. Mahr's Christmas Bock pours out a hazy light brown color with a big head. Sweet nutty aroma with some spices. The flavor is very metallic, which detracts somewhat from the tasty toasted malt. Caramel and cookie dough flavors come out as the beer warms. Hoppier than most German bocks. This beer is very flavorful and malty at first and finishes with a nice bitterness. A tasty winter treat."
"Hazy tawny liquid. Intensely fruity aromas of caramel glazed dried fruits and gumdrops exist within a frame of brown dough, butter and slate. A transparent, winey mouthful of vanilla and charred banana flavor. Roasted wheat crusts. Unctuous and boozy. Black bitter backbone. Silky textures. Profound inner balance and logic. Utter clarity combined with grave depth. Drink at 60 deg. F if you want sweet beer dreams."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creaminess and a steady flow of bubbles. Apart from the label, this beer doesn't seem to have any of the normal Christmas brew bells and whistles. It's just a tasty bock brew that goes down easy. Quite a steal at $1.49 for the bottle..I wouldn't mind having this again sometime."
"Hazy golden colour with a bright white head, quite dense. Settled in a few minutes leaving moderate lacing stuck to the glass. Very sweet, malty aroma, light fruitiness and hops. Flavour is sweet and malty, but with more pear fruit, slight spice, and bitterness shows up mostly in the finish. Medium body and carbonation, smooth, slightly creamy texture. Pretty tasty, and quite drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice bisquity scent with pale and light caramel malts. It's sweet with a toasted aroma. The taste is excellent. It has a rich, smooth malty flavor goes down easy and finishes sweet and a bit dry in the aftertaste. It has a honey taste to it as well. This is a very flavorful beer. The mouthfeel is good also. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good beer. I love the toastey feel and the sweet malt base. It's a good drinker and a fine sessions beer."
"I liked this surprisingly hoppy beer with a base of bock flavour. Very drinkable, and can hold its own against the many hoppy American brews. I smelled the grapefruit, and tasted some grapefruit and spice, which the sweetness and carmel in the finish. A good one for the LCBO."
"This is only the second Maibock I've ever drank, so I really didn't know what to expect. What I found was a light, refreshing beer that I don't think I'm ever going to buy again but I don't regret having purchased in the first place."
"Very enjoyable. Hope to find it again stateside."
"I love this beer and could drink it all night. It would be a good session beer if not for the alcohol content being what it is - then again - why not?"
"Pours a pale copper color with amber hues and a light head. There are some light honey tones present in the nose along with a heavy dosage of malty goodness that gives off some caramel and toffee hints. There is also a slight floral and spicy aroma to this brew but it is very minimal. Initial flavors are overly sweet, with strong dark fruit tones along with a fair mix of caramels and toffees. Following there are notes of sweet molasses and an almost wheat like presence to this brew. The body is fairly light which takes away a bit from the full feel of the beer, but the carbonation is smooth and easy on the pallate which goes along nicely with its sweet finish. Overall a decent german beer but when I think of a Christmas bock I need more than what things brings to the table."
"I'm not very familiar with the Helles Bock style, but this one is a tasty sipper. Very Germanic in character, and a beer that I wouldn't mind keeping around any time of the year."
"Poured a hazy, yellow honey like color and left a slight head in the glass. Not what I was expecting in a ""Christmas"" bock but I was not disappointed. Pleasant, almost creamy, taste with a hint of fruit (apple?) in the background. Didn't find the spiceness or zest that some other reviewers have noted. Smooth mouthfeel with just the right of amount of carbonation for this style. Went down almost too easily. Had to sample another 500ml to ensure that my observations were accurate. A good brew that I'll be on the lookout for during the next holiday season."
"Pours a clear golden/light copper color and a large, beige head. Malty and bready, with a generous addition of hops and a light, yeasty fruitiness. Starts malty and sweet, a touch of nuttiness, then the palate gets hit with astringency from the hops, not too badly, though. The overall feel of the beer is that it is rather mild and nondescript, but easily consumed. Carbonation is a little weak. I'm not really sure what makes this a Christmas beer other that the label artwork, but it's not bad."
"As the beer warms, the scent has some more caramel notes, though the dryness of the taste continues. Overall, an interesting, and tasty winter speciality."
"Pours an amber body, decent head, but little retention. Sweet, floral aroma, malty and spicey. Great tasting beer. Sweet, caramel, pears, nutty. Clean, crisp and easy drinking. Good balance. Mouthfeel is light, and definitely drinkable. I really liked this hellesbock. Recommended."
"Pours a darker golden color with a nice white head, little light for a bock? Aroma is not bad lots of sweet malt with some spicey hop presence. Taste is sweet malt, some molasses with a nutty presence in the mixture finishes with lightly spicey hops that impart a light bitterness. Drinkable beer but overall nothing to get excited about. Mouthfeel is little thin for a bock."
"A bright clean orange beer. Has a good white head, but it doesn't last. A light sweet grainy aroma with a hint of citrus in the background. There is a malty sweetness at the start of the flavor followed by a dry bitterness at the back of your throat. I was originaly taken back by the light color of this ""bock"" . But it does have more flavor than I excpected."
"Drinkability: well, i consider this a disappointment considering it's a seasonal brew. there was much to be desired here. average Bock at very best."
"It was a pleasant beer that went down smoothly. Are you sure this is a bock?"
"To be honest, I was quite disappointed with this beer. It simply lacks. Actually, it was more like a pale lager than anything else. Pours a pale gold colour. Not yellow, gold. Very minimal head. Perhaps a milimetre thick, give or take a few micrometres. Doesn't really lace. It looks more like strips of thread occasionally shows up on the glass. Smells kinda weak. Malt profile mostly. Sweet. Bit of hops, kinda herbal. Taste is again, light. Mild malt sweetness, but of an herbal aftertaste. Overall, bland. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. And the highlight of the beer. But overall, a disappointment. It's lacking in character. Perhaps it should be served colder? But then again, cold beers usually have more flavour than warm. And perhaps the biggest puzzle of all is, exactly how is this related to christmas? Their are no flavours that says ""christmas"" to me."
"Bottle: Poured a light yellow hazy color beer with a nice foamy/bubbly white head. Somewhat paler then expected for a bock or even a Christmas bock in that case. Aroma is comprised of some malt but generally lack of character. Taste is refreshing but again lighter in taste then expected; I can taste some malt but this almost resemble more like a premium lager then a bock. Wow, what a disappointing experience from a usually fine brewery"
"Had this brew on tap the other night at Mahars. Brew was poured to a golden color with a small white head that broke down extremely quickly and left hardly any lacing. The aromas from this brew are highlighted by a sweet scent from the malt, bread and a slight spiciness. It is a relatively nice smelling brew, nothing extreme about it. The taste is very nice, solid malt flavor that is enhanced by spiciness and a bit of a hop at the end. The malt definitely dominated this brew. Over all the different flavors come together very nice, over all I think this is a solid beer. It is extremely smooth and one that I could enjoy for a session."
"This ones on the deeper-golden end of the specturm, with a nice, good-sized cream colored head. Pretty good lacing as well. Sweet bready malt scent. Light bready malts, main taste is fruity flavors. Some light floral hop influence as well. Lighter medium bodied. Good tasting beer but leaves some room for improvement. I like it though."
"This beer is very fresh tasting. Its also light and crisp for a bock, even a helles bock. I recommend it."
"The beer itself was refreshing and left me wishing that I had picked up another few bottles. I will certainly buy again! My only negative comment would be that I was expecting something a little more heavy. When I think of bocks, I think of something that leaves you feeling full and satisfied - but I could easily have had another."
"1/2 liter Euro-crown top. 6.5% AVB export. Pour shows a slightly hazy gold colored beer (certainly the lightest bock Ive ever had outside of FAX or Holsten bright bocks)..frothy 1 finger cap that lasts...pleasant odor..sweet mingles with musty-bready banana-fruit-spice smells. Taste is malty sweet, spicy, butter-almond impression ( no its not diacetyl...its a true butter-almond taste from the alcohol/malts) as the alcohol/hops/yeast tastes mingle on the palate...very malty oily mouthfeel..long sweet bready finish. A very substantial bright strong beer...malty sweet and musty with butter-almond tones...not what you would expect from a helles bock."
"Drinkability was good, but it was not as smooth a beer as expected."
"Not too crazy about this one. I'd like to like it more, but it just ain't happening. Lies too flat on the palate, has no pizzaz. Aftertaste isn't too tasty, either."
"I'm not sure what makes Mahr's Christmas Bock a Christmas bock, but it doesn't put me in the holiday spirit. Neither does it put me in the mood to have it again. A decent purchase, but it'll be my last."
"16.9 ounce bottle. No freshness dating."
"Pours a deep copper color with a light head that is gone pretty fast,aroma is lightly spicey and fruity with a pizza dough quality pretty appetizing.Taste is on the sweet side with a big maltiness to it seems almost spiced I notice a slight hop presence in the finish as well.A little thin but incredibly drinkable with alot of nice flavors.I would buy again."
"Sampled 12/13/03"
"Color is a clear light caramel brown/dark honeyish yellow, a thin puffy off-white head dissipates quickly to leave a thin skim and collar. No lacing really sticks, just a few small blobs appear but drip back into the collar. Smell is fairly sweet with a favorable breadish quality and dullish fruity maltiness, a bit nutty with some very soft floral notes too. Taste is more of the same with a nice hold upfront of soild carbonation that lends some soft, well rounded sweetish malts touching on fruityness and caramel, kinda toasty/nutty, a definate sweet breadiness dominates but doesn't last and is a bit light on the palate. Feel is just under medium with a thinning but dulled nutty drying finish along with leaving floral/grassy notes. A gentle, easy going drinker, subdued a bit but moderate enough for amiable enjoyment."
"Fine bubbled greyish-white head that didn't last long, and left only a ring around the glass. The beer was crystal clear and light golden brown in color. The aroma was faint, malty sweetness and a little doughy banana. The taste was mildly malty, leaning a little towards the sweet side, then a carbonated bitterness creaps up and bites the tongue. A fairly clean beer, especially in the aftertaste. Not a bad beer, just not much to it."
"This one poured with a light cream head over clear dark bronze liquid. A typical ""nothing to see here"" soft malty nose aroma. The taste was a deep satisfying maltiness mingling with bitter, metallic hoppy tones. Quite good...better than the nose would lead you to expect! Finishes up delicious and drinkable, sweet at first, then drys out superbly in the end. Very good and reccomended!"
"It can be compared to (distantly) Young's Winter Warmer."
"Clear light amber appearance. A medium sized bubbly beige head recedes to a thin film quickly. Some crisp floral hop tones accentuate some soft pale malt tones. Herbalness and earthiness also come across on the nose. The mouthfeel is quite light on the CO2. A little too light I think. Body is medium-full. The flavors are munich malts mixed with leafy hops. A little bit of a nutty flavor as well. Bitterness is evident on the aftertaste and seems to be hop derived as well as grainy. Pretty average."
"Clear light amber-copper color with a decent off-white head that doesn't last with some lacing, sweet fruity and flowery aroma. Sweet and malty roasted caramel flavors , medium body with a sticky mouthfeel, finishes with some sweetness, very average at best."
