The taste starts malty, yeasty, and sweet and then delicately fades into a mildly bitter hop finish. The malt and yeast never really give up their grasp on your tongue though. In fact, the malt and yeast can be tasted long after the hops have faded from the palate. The carbonation is a bit on the heavy side, but the thick/creamy mouthfeel counteracts it beautifully. This beer was a new experience for me. I usually target hop forward beers that are intensely bitter, but this one was a bit different.

Smells faint at first, but after letting it warm quite a bit, I get slightly sweet caramel malt and plenty of fruit (black cherry?)--easily the most I've encountered in a lager. Toasted dark malts give it a nice roasty flavor; quite hoppy as well. More fruit here as well. Very nice and quite flavorful. Mouthfeel is also good: thick on the palate with perfect light carbonation. I could drink this all day. An excellent lager--subtle, yet full of flavor.","philipquarles","Jan 09, 2009"

The beer has a sweet, yet strong, ABV presence throughout. There is a definite dextrin sweetness from the malts, but a slightly biting spiciness as well, and perhaps that is what the Xmas in the label is all about. Otherwise, this tastes a whole lot like most other bocks you find. The caramel malts, the ABV presence, the slightly bittering aftertaste coupled with the spicy bite, pretty much define this bock. The carbonation is moderate. The beer isn't syrupy, but the aftertaste does have a touch of the throaty ABV burn. The beer is largely representative of the style.","albern","Jan 06, 2009"

There is definitely a juicy malt and fresh biscuity overall feel to the beer. Clearly, plummy and sweet tobacco characteristics stands out at first and then slowly transforms in to some type of marmelade toast flavor (?).

4.2,14.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice bisquity scent with pale and light caramel malts. It's sweet with a toasted aroma. The taste is excellent. It has a rich, smooth malty flavor goes down easy and finishes sweet and a bit dry in the aftertaste. It has a honey taste to it as well. This is a very flavorful beer. The mouthfeel is good also. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good beer. I love the toastey feel and the sweet malt base. It's a good drinker and a fine sessions beer.","WesWes","Feb 17, 2005"

I smelled the grapefruit, and tasted some grapefruit and spice, which the sweetness and carmel in the finish. A good one for the LCBO.","Sammy","Beers"

3.45,-6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a pale copper color with amber hues and a light head. There are some light honey tones present in the nose along with a heavy dosage of malty goodness that gives off some caramel and toffee hints. There is also a slight floral and spicy aroma to this brew but it is very minimal. Initial flavors are overly sweet, with strong dark fruit tones along with a fair mix of caramels and toffees. Following there are notes of sweet molasses and an almost wheat like presence to this brew. The body is fairly light which takes away a bit from the full feel of the beer, but the carbonation is smooth and easy on the pallate which goes along nicely with its sweet finish. Overall a decent german beer but when I think of a Christmas bock I need more than what things brings to the table.","bigbeerdrinka","Dec 29, 2004"
3.92,6.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I'm not very familiar with the Helles Bock style, but this one is a tasty sipper. Very Germanic in character, and a beer that I wouldn't mind keeping around any time of the year.","merlin48","Dec 29, 2004"
3.27,-10.9,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured a hazy, yellow honey like color and left a slight head in the glass. Not what I was expecting in a "Christmas" bock but I was not disappointed. Pleasant, almost creamy, taste with a hint of fruit (apple?) in the background. Didn't find the spiceness or zest that some other reviewers have noted. Smooth mouthfeel with just the right of amount of carbonation for this style. Went down almost too easily. Had to sample another 500ml to ensure that my observations were accurate. A good brew that I'll be on the lookout for during the next holiday season.","WTexas","Dec 26, 2004"
3.57,-2.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear golden/light copper color and a large, beige head. Malty and bready, with a generous addition of hops and a light, yeasty fruitiness. Starts malty and sweet, a touch of nuttiness, then the palate gets hit with astringency from the hops, not too badly, though. The overall feel of the beer is that it is rather mild and nondescript, but easily consumed. Carbonation is a little weak. I'm not really sure what makes this a Christmas beer other that the label artwork, but it's not bad.","crookedhalo","Dec 25, 2004"

3.03,-17.4,3,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"A bright clean orange beer. Has a good white head, but it doesn't last. A light sweet grainy aroma with a hint of citrus in the background. There is a malty sweetness at the start of the flavor followed by a dry bitterness at the back of your throat. I was originaly taken back by the light color of this "bock" . But it does have more flavor than I excpected.","ybnorml","Dec 12, 2004"

2.6,-29.2,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,"To be honest, I was quite disappointed with this beer. It simply lacks. Actually, it was more like a pale lager than anything else. Pours a pale gold colour. Not yellow, gold. Very minimal head. Perhaps a milimetre thick, give or take a few micrometres. Doesn't really lace. It looks more like strips of thread occasionally shows up on the glass. Smells kinda weak. Malt profile mostly. Sweet. Bit of hops, kinda herbal. Taste is again, light. Mild malt sweetness, but of an herbal aftertaste. Overall, bland. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. And the highlight of the beer. But overall, a disappointment. It's lacking in character. Perhaps it should be served colder? But then again, cold beers usually have more flavour than warm. And perhaps the biggest puzzle of all is, exactly how is this related to christmas? Their are no flavours that says "christmas" to me.","slitherySOB","Dec 07, 2004"
2.8,-23.7,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Bottle: Poured a light yellow hazy color beer with a nice foamy/bubbly white head. Somewhat paler then expected for a bock or even a Christmas bock in that case. Aroma is comprised of some malt but generally lack of character. Taste is refreshing but again lighter in taste then expected; I can taste some malt but this almost resemble more like a premium lager then a bock. Wow, what a disappointing experience from a usually fine brewery","Phyl21ca","Dec 06, 2004"
3.82,4.1,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Had this brew on tap the other night at Mahars. Brew was poured to a golden color with a small white head that broke down extremely quickly and left hardly any lacing. The aromas from this brew are highlighted by a sweet scent from the malt, bread and a slight spiciness. It is a relatively nice smelling brew, nothing extreme about it. The taste is very nice, solid malt flavor that is enhanced by spiciness and a bit of a hop at the end. The malt definitely dominated this brew. Over all the different flavors come together very nice, over all I think this is a solid beer. It is extremely smooth and one that I could enjoy for a session.","Stimack","Dec 05, 2004"

I like it though.","Tballz420","Nov 27, 2004"

Taste is malty sweet, spicy, butter-almond impression ( no its not diacetyl...its a true butter-almond taste from the alcohol/malts) as the alcohol/hops/yeast tastes mingle on the palate...very malty oily mouthfeel..long sweet bready finish.

No lacing really sticks, just a few small blobs appear but drip back into the collar. Smell is fairly sweet with a favorable breadish quality and dullish fruity maltiness, a bit nutty with some very soft floral notes too. Taste is more of the same with a nice hold upfront of soild carbonation that lends some soft, well rounded sweetish malts touching on fruityness and caramel, kinda toasty/nutty, a definate sweet breadiness dominates but doesn't last and is a bit light on the palate. Feel is just under medium with a thinning but dulled nutty drying finish along with leaving floral/grassy notes.
