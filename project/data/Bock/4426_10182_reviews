"always love maple beers, buy every one i see, but i always wish for more maple, and this one certainly didnt take me to the promised land, although i liked the beer a lot. its a dopplebock type base beer, its german origins evident in both the malt and the yeast, which i think makes maple a real interesting choice, as these flavors are not often paired together, especially in a beer. nice and dark and rich looking, lathery off white head with fine retention and a thick dark mahogany color. nose is sweet, but bock comes before maple, i suspect the base beer is rather authentic and i like that. the maple is an accent flavor and aroma, but its there, and its real. i think it was probably used to spike the abv, and there is less residual maple than i would look for personally, but the beer is well balanced and the maple goes nicely with the german malts, which have some sweetness of their own to contribute. i like this a lot, its filling for sure, not something i need a whole lot of, but as always with maple beers, give me more maple!!!"
"chocolaty and toasty. Somewhat porterlike in feel and body. Nice yeast taste and more maple is noted in the nose than the taste, though present in both. The hops are not too powerful, but give a nice balance to the breadiness. This was good. Light/medium body."
"Odd, complex beer. Glad they chose not to over do the maple. Like it more as I drank, would drink again.  Gf gave it earthy tree notes which I agree"

"Medium bodied feel and well carbonated. Overall, this is a pretty good bock, I like the maple influence and hints of toffee."

"A nice darker bock with a touch of maple. A well-made lager! Pairs well with smoked ham!"
"I don't mind this one, but it's clearly outside my bag. Not in my wheelhouse, as some are fond of saying (I'm not.). No ABV given, but I'd put it around 5.5%, maybe. This has to have it's fans out there, but as for me, I think one is good enough."

"Overall- An ok beer, can taste the maple but it doesn't mix very well with the rest of the beer. Sweet maple are tart fruit."

"Maple Bock pours a black color with a small white creamy head. There is a smokey sweet like aroma. The taste has a nice burnt malty taste, with just hints of a sweet maple. Good full flavor, nice dry bitterness at the end. Overall a very nice bock, full flavors, nice blend of syrup."

"Overall not to sweat with balance malty and Maple tones"
""
"This is a nice enough beer, but it strikes me as more of an interesting novelty type of production than anything overtly noteworthy. The maple syrup provides a sweet and pleasant tone that defines things, but also limits everything as a whole to the maple syrup and what it provides."

"16 ounce bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown with some reddish tints. There's also about a half inch light tan head that stays around for a while. There's also a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like maple, caramel, molasses and some sweet malt. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's also a slight bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and smooth with moderate carbonation. This is the second Hinterland beer I've tried, and I've liked them both. I'll definitely try more of their other beers! $9.99 a 4-pack."

"Comes in a 16 oz bottle."
"The body is strong without being too heavy for the style. It leans that way, but it stops just short. It's pretty smooth with a bit of creaminess in the texture after just a very slight crispness up in front."
""
""
"I found this to be quite pleasant."
"Overall - I was very disappointed by this beer. The flavor was more burnt than anything else, which is a let down for me because I was really looking forward to having this as it was sitting in my fridge."
""
""
"O- A bit of a mixed bag. I wont be buying another four pack of this particular beer but will try some of the other offerings from this brewery."
"Overall, it is nice bock with a dash of maple."
""
"Overall- This maple bock is one of the more robust bocks I have had with out being very sweet. Maple is in the beer, but you have to really search it out. It could be so much bigger in this beer. The malt is fine, but I think a sweeter palate would have helped immensely."
"3.0 D: Not bad, but I'm not impressed and I'm a bit disappointed given the very low maple contribution."
"Overall I wouldn't consider this a maple beer or even a bock since I got mostly roast I consider it mainly a porter. Wouldn't buy again."

"Pours a strikingly dark hazy mahogany with a half finger of tan foam that sticks to the side of the glass leaving fits of lace and rings. Smells distinctly and deliciously of maple with a complimentary underpinning of biscuit malt. Very nice. The maple element isn't nearly as apparent in the taste. There is a slight maple vein in waht is mostly a biscuit, bready, slightly caramel malt base. Slightly sweet but finishes mostly clean but somewhat acidic. Medium body, low carbonation. Good drinking beer, wish it had more maple."
"Overall, not a bad beer. I'd call it borderline better than average/good. With this style, there is such a range of interpretations, it's hard to know what you're getting into. I think an extra hop flavor charge and maybe some low degree crystal malts may help balance this a little bit, paired with a lower ferment temp, or maybe changing yeast up."
"O - Very nice beer. The maple can be hit and miss. I'd like more maple in a Maple Bock, but beggars can't be choosers."
""
""
"O-probably not something I would ever turn down if offered but just not enough maple flavor for me to warrant buying again"

"Hinterland Maple Bock pours a finger of tan foam over an inky brown fluid. Carbonation is very subdued and the head collapses into a sticky disk pretty quickly. The nose suggests a myriad of dark flavors- molasses and bitter chocolate predominate, with notes of raisin. The flavor is big, bold, and straightforward- sweet dark malts, with touches of diacetyl, grain, and dark chocolate, finishing with bitter notes of espresso and herbs. Mouthfeel is full is round, drying a bit, though the maple syrup that I feel contributed to the drying did impart a very mild impression of syrup in the aftertaste. Good solid brew."

"0 - pretty decent beer... perfect w/ pancakes, eggs, and bacon!"
"O- liked this beer but nothing outstanding. Not sure if I would by again, but would drink again."
"It looked good in my snifter, a slick black brew with minimal head which disipated fast, but, I'd just poured it after walking in from a January night dog walk. Was my nose too stuffed up to appreciate the bouquet? In fact it wasn't. There are faint hints of a roasty stout, but that's it, faint hints. There is a light lingering hop after taste, but let me emphasize 'light'. After a while this opened up to some more flavors but beyond that there was not much to taste from this Maple Bock, not even the maple! This was a let down from Hinterland, but not all was lost with a steal of a purchase at $3 for a single pint bottle from Armanetti's on Lincoln."

"Overall: Again, another spot on brew by Hinterland. I've heard they might offer this in a barrel aged and I can't wait to check that out."
"Overall, this beer is killer. I paired this with a pork butt that I braised in this beer, and together it was awesome. Recommend."
""
"Yum!"

"Overall: nice, drinkable beer. Jeez, I just now looked at the ABV. This could be a troublesome beer."

"Maple wasn’t too apparent for me in the flavor, although its effects were noticeable in the mouthfeel. I’m wondering if this was a sweeter beer when released in the spring (early summer?). It was also hopped a bit more heavily than I’ve previously experienced in the style. Still, all things considered, a tasty option."
"Got a bottle from my buddy. This beer pours great into a pint glass. Looks and smells amazing. This beer will pour with a thick and creamy head. It looks beautiful. I was expecting more of a maple syrup taste since it is in the name but they definitely don't overdo it. The mouthfeel is just how it looks - thick and creamy. This is hands-down the best bock I have ever drank. The maple taste is there but it is not overdone and is in the background. If you see this beer at your local liquor store, it is a must-buy if you like bocks."
"Very nice winter beer. Love the rich maltiness of this combined with the sweet maple and bock flavors."
"Overall: My first Hinterland beer. It is a good beer and I really enjoyed it, but it was not what I expected at all. I wanted the maple to become more of a star player in this beer and it was not at all sweet like I thought it would be. Not really a bock to me either. Regardless, of those minor details this beer is still damn good!"
"O- This is truly a great bock. There are only two negative things I could say which are both fairly minor. First, the carbonation is a bit much, but this can also be fixed by a slightly harder pour to drive off the excess CO2. Second, it wasn't as ""maplely"" as I would of thought, then again that can also be attributed to brewing skill depending on the brewers intention. Intentions aside I really enjoyed this beer and I look forward to cellaring some to see how they develop."
"Robust flavor, bittersweet with some chocolate malt, woody toastiness, finishing dry with no residual sweetness at all. Similar to real maple, it's not a sweet taste or cloying either. Lingering traces of hearty malt flavors. Medium bodied, but easily drinkable. The dryness is a nice characteristic, more pleasant that ultra-sweet bocks."
"I'm not sure the term ""maple"" helps the perception in this case, as it surely influenced my expectations. Regardless, this is a very good Wisconsin bock."
"O-Don't expect a lot of maple....don't expect a lot of basic bock characteristics...DO expect a nice tasty beer. A bit different but enjoyable and drinkable."
"Again, some age does this beer some good. The first bottles I cracked were nowhere near as amazing as this one. A knockout bock from Hinterland...I've never had anything else like it."
"D - A tad sweet at times but a very solid bock."
"It enters the mouth porty, dense, and full, then deflates as it travels towards the throat. Carbonation is stunted, then seems to die altogether. With a better feel representation, this could be a home run of a bock- it's a solid stand-up double as it- just don't come here expecting a bottle of maple syrup."
"D: I love bocks and this one does not disappoint. I wanted more maple but I'm not complaining. Very tasty."
"D: Not bad overall, an interesting beer."
"D- I was excited to hear about this beer but upon tasting it, I was a little let down that the maple flavor wasn't stronger. Still a good offering but if you are looking for more maple, look elsewhere."
"Drinkabilty- I think this is a relatively good beer. I was kinda expecting a little more upfront maple but am rather glad they were conservative with it so it didn't overpower the beer itself. I could definitely sit and drink a couple of these."
"Picked up a single over in Wiscoland since I'd never seen it before. Tasty, but I can't believe how thin the beer felt. It had a good head but the carbonation didn't come through in the feel. Interesting."
"D. Hinterland has nailed this beer. It is flavorful and easy to drink. I usually look past Bocks - this has changed my opinion of them. Worth seeking out."
"D: I was very hesitant about getting this (i love beer and maple syrup, but together?) This beer just works so well. The alcohol warmth and flavor will quench your soul with WI goodness. This is a sipper and should NOT be missed."
"A nice beer, but I would have liked the maple syrup to stand out more. Drinks easily and is worth a try."
"D - While I knew not to expect actual maple syrup in the aroma and flavor, I continued to desire it, but that didn't keep me from enjoying this new Hinterland brew. It never gets over-the-top or too unbalanced in any way but I'd be hard-pressed to jump right into a second pint of it without something lighter to swig."
"drinkability: good"
"500 ml bottle from dirtylou, paired with a ""kitchen sink"""
"Drinkability: Very drinkable although a better flavor profile would bump this category score up to 5.0"
"This was a deep, clear, ruby-red liquid with a decent medium-brown head above it. It had an absolutely super nose of maple syrup. The mouthfeel was medium, but slightly hot on the tongue, with a great malty sweetness. The finish evidenced a mild smokiness, imparted by owner Bill Xxxxx's homemade (!) maple syrup. Phew! Bartender, another, please."
