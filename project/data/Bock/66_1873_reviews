"Overll - A pretty decent beer this one has strong boozy flavour that does detract from the other elements slightly and a cloying finish. Having said that there is a good malt profile and if given this beer again I would not turn it down!"

"Overall quite a treat for a discounted 2 dollar purchase. In fact I think I like it more than the winter bock since the ABV is more session able."

"Beer is medium-bodied with low levels of carbonation, leading this to have a smooth, though slightly stagnant mouthfeel. Some more carbonation would not be problematic, and this beer's weight could certainly handle it. Closes quite dry, with surprisingly little stickiness across the palate."

"O: This is beer is a good representation of the style and is also quite easy to drink compared to other bocks."
"O: This beer is a malt forward beer with a little sweetness but an overall good balance."
"Pours a murky dark orange with a 1 inch foamy tan head that settles to a thin film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and some slight soy sauce notes. Taste is of toasted malt and some burnt caramel and toffee flavors. There is a slight alcohol kick with each sip. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a better taste than smell in my opinion."

"Initially this brew comes across as a tad unruly with alcohol the dominant presence, both in aroma and taste. By the second, third and forth gulp the hops begin to assert themselves and take center stage. The amber/orange color stands alone in the beer world. I had to keep looking at it and holding it to different lights and upgrading my initial appearance rating. The taste is extremely complex, that too required a raise in points. The ample malt body never achieves a platform of its own. It instead plays a wonderful supporting role to the competing stars. The off white heads performance is marvelous, though brief. Einbecker, by the way, is the inventor of the bock style. Because I was unsure of my ability to accurately rate this unusual style beer with one bottle, I found it necessary drink a second."
"330 ml. bottle. Beatiful amber reddish colour, no dark at all, light head that fades quickly, no lace. Smell: Am I the one who fin the typical Burton Ale sulphur here? That alongside chocolate, dark fruit and molasses. Medium body, really good palate, taste of caramel, chocolate, roasted, fruits, prunes... Really good one."
"D: This is one of the better bock beers that I've had in my time, and I'd rather have this than some other choices on the market today."
"Had this on tap at the Bavarian Lodge. The menu states that Einbecker originated the Bock style but I think others have done this better (anyone remember Leinie's Bock from the 80s?) The beer seemed bright for the style and had some harshness - there was little of the caramel overtone that you have in most Bocks. This beer scored better than average only because I like Bocks..."
"A thoroughly mediocre beer that is certainly drinkable, but not particularly memorable. It certainly does not justify it’s price. Glad I tried it, but I doubt I will do so again."
"Overall - A classic of the style - need to try it fresh over in Germany some time. Never quite sure how fresh it is in the green bottles thousands of miles from the brewery."
"Einbecker Ur-Bock Dunkel is stereotypically German in that it's been meticulously brewed according to a conventional, long-established recipe and accustomed level of quality and is efficiently engineered for a culturally prescribed and expected degree of easy drinkability. And there's nothing wrong with that - in fact, that's exactly the reason I bought it."
"O: not sure about this one; some things I really like, while others I really don't; the smell and mouthfeel are not great, but the taste and appearance appeal to me"
"D: very easy drinking"
"Pours a clear red mahogany with about a finger of head fading soon after. No aroma to speak of, which is a bit disappointing. Fairly complex flavor though, with a good mix of fruit, perhaps apple and plum, decent caramel, and a touch of spice. Somewhat chewy in the mouth, though not necessarily full bodied, and slightly bitter and wet on the finish. An enjoyable brew, with the flavor making up for some of its less refined qualities."
"It is balanced to my surprise. Still, the hops sting the palate with its bitterness (could the green bottle have influenced this?). Light on the caramel and raisin with a lot of oily bitterness stinging and lingering on. Decent enough to drink, but in summary a let down."
"Pours amber/dark brown color with medium head. Aroma is sweet malts with a hint of floral. Taste is citrus hops on the front end balanced by a nice bready malt sweetness that lasts into a strong aftertaste. The beer is light- to medium-bodied with a pleasant, fine texture. Very good beer from a classic brewery."
"Could use some complexity and lushness, but not bad."
"Overall a rich and flavorful beer that has a little throat burn that sneaks up on you"
"This is a very drinkable bock. True to its style, I would say. I would classify this as a reliable go-to pick for a heartier lager."
"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a lasting white head. Nice aroma of piny hops and caramel malt. Full, slightly crisp body, light carbonation. Large amount of floral hops on the palate perfectly balanced by caramel malt, some hints of citrus fruit as well. Long balanced finish becomes dry in the end. UR BOCK indeed."
"I forgot what I paid per bottle-- anyway it's a beer that would be in the ""every-day"" catagory. A nice change of style to reach for.."
"drinkability; Pretty easy to drink at the right temperature(very important as the alcohol can get annoying if it's too warm). The alcohol may sneak up on one but so long as no driving is involved, I see no reason not to drink in quantity, this is one of the few I buy by the case and offer to my friends to get to know the style."
"Very drinkable. it's refreshing and clean bittersweet like a good dark beer should be."
"This is a good beer. It is slightly thicker (maltier) than most beer, but it is not overbearing."
"D: Green glass issues aside, this is a smooth, easy drinking toasty (and tasty) bock."
"Not a chugger. Bitterness makes this a true sipper, and the in your face alcohol makes this a one and done for the night. Very good for the style. Well made beer."
"D: Having the maibock and this back to back, for me the maibock is the the superior brew, it's more balanced the hops come out more, but I can see the malt-head liking this more, it's pushing on that dopplebock door. A beer that really needs some food to go with it."
"Drinkability - Good beer in general. Somewhat of a good example of a bock in general. Perhaps a little too filling to come back to too often in one night, but certainly complex enough to be entertaining once a night."
"The aftertaste is especially good."
"A historic lager - and while the descendents of traditional bock are superior in many ways, this is still well worth sampling - an excellent unobtrusive beer, perfect with a variety of German foods."
"D - easy to drink."
"Poured a clear brown body with minimal head that dies quickly. A sharp piney hop smell with a good bready/nutty malt smell as well. A lighter bock, almost medium-bodied, with a dry, roasted malt taste with some biscuitiness as well as some sharp hops for minor balance. Semi-sweet caramel and sugar malts come out on backend for a sticky sensation and a somewhat sweet finish. A decent bock but I prefer them stronger."
"Nothing too complex here, but a solid offering stylistically nonetheless. Perhaps a little commercialized for the modern German beer-drinker's palate, it doesn't display the complexity that some more traditional examples do, despite its bearing the namesake of Bock itself."
"Taste is excellent, very fruity with sweetness, firm toastiness, great interplay of all the traits and with good complexity. It has spicey-peppery and raisiny bitterness, finish has burnt raisins and spicey bite. It is wonderful, balanced, complex, and not overly sweet. Feel is a bit frothy, very firm."
"A solid bock from Einbecker."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a solid beer with flavor and substance to drink for a while."
"Pours light brown with thin white head. Nose is very light and weak, with a little brown bread toastyness. Palate is malty sweet, but somewhat thin bodied and thin in flavors, and the alcohol makes an appearance even when cold. Drinkability is still there since this is a very light, thirst quenching Bock."
"Altogether a good beer, just a little to herbal in the flavor for my taste."
"drinkability takes a slight knock just for the fact its so sweet almost annoyingly so"
"D. Not bad, but this has to be better at the source. Will try again in hopes of a fresher bottle."
"This is a fairly drinkable bock, but the appearance is a little off."
"A nice beer, but nothing special. Very light, but a little too skunky to be too drinkable maybe just because its an import."
"Again I am unimpressed with this brewery. All their beers smell the same and the taste only differs slightly. They're not bad really, but there are certainly some better examples of the styles available. Especially considering the expensive price."
"D: A very balanced and drinkable beer, Having never had a Bock before, I am not sure how true to style it is, but It would pair great with a peice of rustic bread smeared with warm honey, or perhaps something spicy. A pint would be the proper serving size, it does not wear me out. The hot alcohol is surprising, but would be welcome on a cold night, even on a warm spring afternoon it wasn't unpleasent."
"D: good bottle that houses a pretty darn solid Bock beer, try it if you get the chance. This one hit me very well"
"I bought an 11.2 ounce bottle. A green bottle. I hate when I get jipped that .8 of an ounce. It forms a very nice and thick foamy off-white head when poured into my pint glass. Sticks to the glass as it empties. It has a sort of sweet bready malty aroma. Has some bitterness and a sour element in the flavor. Yet semi-sweet and malty as well. Nice texture and carbonation and not too heavy. There's a sour-like and somewhat unpleasant aftertaste. It's a good beer but there are better bocks out there."
"D- Pretty straight forward, not very complex. Goes down nicely though."
"A great example of the old, original style -- from the old, original brewery!"
"It was ok. not overly impressed. not worth the extra money of buying this import."
"Overall, this is a quite drinkable beer. I don't know how often I'll seek it out, but I will certainly enjoy it if it's available."
"this is a very drinkable bock"
"A great beer, one of my favourites."
"(rated Apr 10, 2007)"
"D - Good stuff! Definitely one of the best of a style that I normally find boring and mundane. This is top notch beer!"
"Bottle at Winking Lizard. This beer is a clear reddish-brown color with a medium light beige head that dissipates steadily. Spotty lacing. The aroma is mildly sweet malt and caramel with a touch of hops. Light, smooth body with a sweet malty character. Notes of bread and hops are present in the taste. The finish is moderately sweet with a toasted malt aftertaste. Average and fairly one-dimensional overall."
"Pours a clear amber with a thin tan head with little to no lacing. Carmelized malt, earthy and grainy aromas. Biscuity malt, chocolate malt up front, very sweet with a lemon hop finish. Medium body and carbonation, mouth coating beer with a lingering sweetness. Clean, smooth easy drinking beer. Not the best of the style but worth a try."
"A very nice brew with good drinkability. If it was less expensive, I'd be all over it."
"This beer poured an attractive copper color which surprised me as I anticipated a darker beer. It had a decent lasting head and left some lacing. Aroma was of sweet roasted malt, dark fruits, and honey. Flavor was similar, but I found it a bit too sweet for my tastes. Still a good beer, but the sweetness would keep me from having more than 1 or 2. Mouthfeel was good."
"4.0 D: I could drink these all night, but might be a little too hoppy for some. Smooth with good flavor."
"Nice bock."
"One of the better and more complex Bocks I have tried."
"D: easy drinking and very enjoyable. well worthy of a try."
"This one seems to be on the lighter side of a bock, almost like a dark Marzen."
"Had a bottle at the Moan and Dove. The beer had a tan colored brown appearance with some creamy lacing. Aromas were really appetizing; a generally milky and roasty aroma. This was a very sweet bock with a great balance of milky cream flavoring with yeasty, malt aspects. Not to repeat myself, but yes this was a wonderfully creamy drink, but what was nice was it was light. Overall, a great bock."
"D - Good, would purchase again, but missed on account of close taste to a marzen and color."
"I had severals glasses of this beer during the festival, as it was one of my favorites. Just an absolute joy to drink and a reminder that not everything has to have a ton of hops to be delicious. An excellent beer."
"This is a nice example of a bock. Although it's a Dunkel, it's not too dark."
"The taste is quite full bodied, a bit syrupy, and loaded with caramel malts and some toasted grains. There is a bit of spiciness to the beer, and a bit of an alcoholy throatiness in the finish that I'm not as pleased with. The caramel malts pretty much dominate along with the butterscotch and alcohol in the finish. That's what I'm getting from this beer. There may be a bit of nuttiness towards the finish, maybe a slight bit of peatiness too. The alcohol in the finish and beyond is just a bit much for a 6.5% ABV bock."
"Try this tasty classic with a hearty meal."
"Decent, thick mouthfeel is a plus, but overall, this is just too sweet to be very drinkable."
"D: Enjoyable enough but a bit harsh in the flavor and mouthfeel. Not especially smooth or easy to drink."
"D: An enjoyable beer. Maybe not extraordinarily special for a bock, but it is the original and it is very worthwhile."
"12oz green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a dark amber clear body with virtually no head. Smells mostly of caramel malts and herbal spicy hops. Tastes very sweet with caramel malts dominating with a fair bit of herbal continental hops. Flavors are fairly subtle, but apparent and very well-balanced. Finishes rather clean. On the lighter side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Tasty and extremely drinkable. Definitely picking this one up again!"
"11.2 oz green bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a clear copper with about two fingers of fine bubbled, slightly off white head. Rich, malty aroma with some fresh noble hop aroma. Medium bodied, with a solid malt complexity, some caramel. There was some hop bitterness in the finish. Slight, green bottle skunking. Very drinkable."
"Overall - This was a great bock beer that can be complimented with dessert or enjoyed alone. If only this was a double bock, then I would definitely give it an A. Will buy UR bock dunkel again!"
"D: An average drink, not bad but nothing that would make you seek it out or recommend."
"Not bad... Worth a shot..."
"Has a pronounced carbonated mouthfeel but it was not objectionable. Smooth overall. This was not hard to drink on a colder winter night. I may try this again, it was good enough to warrant a second tasting, IMO."
"D - I wish I had a case of this."
"An excellent bock... definitely underrated."
"Overall, a very solid beer and I'll buy & drink this again if I'm able to find some again."
"Pours a slightly clouded amber with a ruby tint and a light tan head. Nose is cereal and malty with a slight sweet edge. Flavor is sweet and tangy with an almost roasted, old fruit quality to it. Feel is thick and almost syrup like on the tongue. I think it is very drinkable. Might be too sweet or pungent for some, but for me it is just fine."
"I just wish Einbecker would ditch the green bottles."
"I think I like this one more than the mai-ur-bock. It's a little cleaner on the palate and not as biting. With dunkel in the name, it could probably stand to be a little bit darker. Seems like it could make for a nice session brew."
"This beer has a red-amber color. The clarity is clear. It has a malty aroma with a lingering caramel scent. The flavor is malty with caramel notes and a light smoke finish. It has a body that is between medium and full. The head was moderate, but dissipated. This is a nice, drinkable, sweet, but not cloy beer."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and drinkable. Could have downed a few more pretty easily."
"Overall, a solid bock beer. Enjoyable and easy to drink, it has a bit more bitterness than expected - a welcome surprise. I am suddenly reminded how much I enjoy a good bock. Try it if you have the opportunity."
"drinkability is rather good for the style, without overpowering any one of the flavor departments, but creating a good mix that finishes smoothly."
"Highly recommended"
"I'm a huge doppelbock fan, but I've had markedly less experience with the original bock style. This poured a ruby shade of brown that was a little lighter than a doppel bock. The initial taste was malty, but finished with a hint of hops. There was also a slight trace of metal floating in the background; I may have grabbed a bottle that was past its prime. Overall, the flavor was decent, but a bit weak. The malty flavor was a little weak, the hops flavor a little limp. I'll try this again, but it's not at the top of my list."
"I found this to be a pretty robust bock actually. I certainly wouldn't mind having another bottle."
" A tasty , clean , and fun beer to drink . I'll buy again"
"A fine beer. Among the better bocks that you'll find. This is a tough style since it's not over the top in many any way."
"I find this beer to be very drinkable. As a stout/porter drinker this time of year, this brew is rich, tasty, smooth, and satisfying. It would go well with beef stew or other winter meals."
"Drinks allright, but just a so-so bock. Good to try for a tip of the hat to the home of bockbier, supposedly. This brewery's product never impressed me in germany either"
"Had this wonderful Dunkel at Hop Devil in NYC a few months ago. Tonight, it pours from a 11.2 oz bottle (I'll never understand why such a small bottle). My 22 oz Tucher Weizen glass is perfect for observation of the carmel color and high clarity. It's a bubbly, spirited carbonation but not overly so. No evidence of yeast, which I suppose makes sense. Aroma is so light...corn (!) comes through with whispers of carmel. Nothing outstanding in that regard. The head is typically thin and lace hugs the glass but survives but for a brief few moments before disappearing into the glass. The taste is another story. Raisens, dried apricots, prevail. A hearty mouthfeel that screams dunkel. A highly drinkable beer, which, if partying is your state of mind, will be most enjoyable given its 6.5% abv. Enjoy."
"Pours light brown with medium tan head. Very sweet flavor. Medium mouthfeel with a sweet honey-like finish. Smells nutty with some nice doughy elements and metallic soapy splashes. However, the toffee and sweet malts stand out in the smell. Pretty good beer to quaff down."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"Taste was dominated by the hops, resinous and weedy. A slight caramel touch and sweet. The bitterness activates my mucus (?). This beer is very drinkable and after 1/3 of the glass I get some alcoholic whiffs that make the beer taste heavier than it really is. A pretty clean yeast has been used, the beer has little yeast character, bottom fermented? Probably!"
"Bold bock."
"The beer was very dark in color and tasted very well. I drank the beer warm and I think it was a good beer. I would try this beer again if it was presented to me. It had a very nice sweet taste for a german dunkel, which I am not a huge fan of."
"Pours a medium orange-brown color with big, thick off-white head. Nose is nice ... sweet malt and molasses. Teasing hop notes as well. Smells rich. Palate is very malty, with sweet molasses and caramel. Offset by a nice biscuity, slightly dry hop accompaniment. Mouthfeel is nice and medium-bodied. Finishes dry for it's sweetness in the mouth. Light carbonation. I like this one pretty well, not the best of the bocks, but good none the less. Worth a shot, especially if you're into the bock style."
"(11.2 oz. / .33L short squat green bottle embossed with Einbecker (x2) around neck and wrapped with gold foil with ""Ur-bock Dunkel"" printed in black (x3))"
"Poured a cloudy apricot color with sparse white head that quickly became a thin ring. Smell is a summer fruit and malt. Taste is malty and fruity, but a too strong bitterness shows itself at the ending. A very poorly balanced beer with the strong bitterness not being very pleasant."
"This is probably my first simple bock; pours an amber color with nice clarity and a beautiful beige head that retains well. The aroma is striking and (seemingly) authentic with notes molasses, hay, herbs, toasted bread and some slight floral hops. The flavor is also intensely malty with notes of toasted bread, molasses, herbs, mineraly hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel is full and creamy, and drinkability is limited by alcohol and the mineraly bitterness. A descent bock, but the alcohol and bitterness limit the enjoyability of this beer."
"Prost! MK"
" Overall, it was drinkable. Not as tasty as their Mai-Bock, but respectable."
"Drinkability: Although the bitterness has some disagreeable medicinal qualities, this is a pretty good Bock"
"Poured a a two finger head with some decent retention. Some faint lacing was able to penetrate that deep caramel copper haze when held to the light. The smell was pilsnery, crystal malts very prevalent in the aroma as well as taste. But mixed with the malts was a little earthy fruit aroma. The flavor starts with some lightly sweetened malts mixing with some spicy fruits. The finish is all crystal malt. palate was a little dry, but not bad. A good bock, but I was glad I found a single bottle on sale instead of a sixer."
"For me its a bit too sweet, but I have to say its pretty smooth and seems well brewed. What it lacks in balance it makes up for later. How? Malts are outstanding, whether a beer is balanced or not doesn't matter to me as long as the dominant theme is tasty and well put together. Recomended"
"A great Bock. Poured out to a medium orange color with a vigorus level of carbonation that produced and nice 1 inch head of foam. Minor notes of lacing. Aromas of herbs and malts are strong, as are noteable elements of caramel and hay. Taste is very good; flavors of malt, grain, molassas and dry herbs mingle across the palate. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, and very easily drank. This is a winner. Recommended drinking when it comes to German Beers."
"I dug it, but this isn't a beer for everybody."
"The taste is spicy malt flavor with some medium dryness and mild alcohol. Their is a nice hop bitterness balanced in with the malt in the aftertaste that leads into an alcohol warmth. Not average, but, not great. Worth a try."
"At least it wasn't skunked thanks to its green bottle. Tastes dirty."
"Opinion: Considering that this beer is here in the US is a good thing, but the time and environment are not kind to a beer that is a bit delicate like this one. A DoppelBock is more forgiving, but a Traditional Bock/Helles Bock/Pilsner/Koelsch/Alt, etc should really be tried in Germany to experience what it is really supposed to taste like. We get to the point to where we expect the oxidation notes from a homebrew example in a contest, but this is actually not to style. The homebrew is closer to the real thing as you would find in the country of origin, but all of the commercial examples we try skew our opinions."
"An above average bock but nothing special. The flavors are indicative of the style but nothing beyond that. I wouldn't mind having another one, but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice."
"Impression: a fine urbock. not a sipper, but not a guzzler. satisfying but not terribly refreshing or heavy."
"Bitter aftertaste, long. Hop and light liquorice. Good balance."
"The color is dark copper with a slight tint of redness. Head is nice-sized and off-white. The aroma is of lightly fragrant dark caramel malts. Not too complex. The taste begins with a strong rounded caramel malt presence which becomes more moderate towards the middle of the sip. Hops provide a gentle bitterness and a touch of herbal flavors. Herbal flavors become more apparent as the beer warms up. The finish is the sweetest part of a sip, it's almost sugary. Very good stuff here, I like both bocks I've tried from Einbecker. Too bad this sells at $10.99+ a sixer in Baton Rouge."
"Craggy plumes of full-throttled bubbling with an amazing lace and stick. Light mahogany hue with an absolute clarity and almost preternaturally quiet. Homebrew bock snout with some gentle burn and a resiny sweetness. Caramel, butterscotch velvet on mouth with some chunky malt that sticks everywhere; a kind of kinky smoke hit falls down later, and almost a calcium hit. Really quite fine ale."
"Chestnut and clear. Eggshell colored froth shot down quickly leaving only a dusting and tons of lacing. No aroma really, just some maltiness floating up... just very clean. Great feel, smooth and silky, the carbonation is barely noticeable but there. It just glides around your mouth. Medium bodied. Roasted malt and caramelly sweetness. Nice dark toastyness, leaves a lot of flavor on your tongue. Good flavor and feel, very drinkable."
"Best before 02-09-05 and poors in without to much head witch is lasting though an leaves laces at glas. Nice ambrebrown beercolor and clear mak presentation ok! Nose is seet, malty, papery/cartboard and old vegetables so from fresh. Some esters and a caramelmalt hide the off taste so all together avarage. Taste is strong, sweet, oxidised and then going into a moderate bitterness. Had the feeling that I sampled a mondaymorning off-brew cause can't recal it always was this uninteresting and dull."
"330 mL green bottle with no notch on the part of the label that indicates freshness. This is my first bock beer if you discount Amber Bock. I could tell I was going to like this beer just from the scent released when opening. Pours a copper/red with an off-white 1 finger head that never goes completely away but doesn't leave much lacing. Smells are predominantly sweet consisting of caramel, molasses, grapes and other dark fruits, along with a hint of alcohol. More flavor than expected. Lots of malts make it rich and chewy, contributing more fruit along with a bit of coffee and toasted flavors. The hops are crisp but they are more apparent in the bitterness they leave. The beer has a bit of a warming sensation and the mouthfeel is very smooth for a lager, only becoming smoother as it warms. I wish I had more of these."
"Nice field grass aroma, and harvested grains. Hoppy and sweet. Ooh, it gives me a hop-bitter zinger, that's surprising. Goodness, there's some yummy-gummy, tuti-fruti? The alcohol sucks in my cheeks. I like that mouthfeel. Pretty awesome, with a little numbness, fuzzy. I liked the schwarzbier better. This is a mouth-full though -- bitter and pinewood smoke, full mouth sweetness, alcohol dryness. Very nice. Bring on a phat stein and a plate of bierrocks with dark, horseradish mustard."
"The beer seemed to miss on it's ""pre-drink"" character, but the taste more than made up for that. All and all a beer that I'd like to have again."
"Nice clear amber with a creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Stale bread and chocolate aromas, Sweet toast, caramel and nutty flavors, medium to full body with a full and soft mouthfeel, finishes with a lingering sweetness. Gets a little better as it warms, not bad."
"Received in the beer of the month club and was excited most of all to try this one out. The newsletter suggested to try with pasta and tomato sauce. I enjoyed the combination fully--also a nice balance of caramel and chocolate. Appeared with a nice head and lacing. Surprised to see this shipped to North Carolina although our Pop the Cap laws haven't passed yet."
"Pours a transparent copper with medium white head which leaves a layer of foam and somewhat clingy lacing. Sweet, soapy caramel and roasted malt aroma (not particularly appetizing for me due to the overwhelming sweet soapiness). Sweet caramel initial flavor which builds into coarse cereals & toasted malts and finishes with slightly drying hops and somewhat metallic after-taste. Chewy and creamy body with strong carbonation."
"I could drink a good handfull of these, but they might get a little cloying after a few."
"This poured a light caramel color, nice fairly thick head that retained well throughout, smell was of Molasses and raisins, taste follows, nice hop balance, but a tilt toward the malts, mouthfeel was nice and full, creamy and a bit chewy on the end, fairly good carbonation as well. drinkability is very good, very nice beer, and a bit different than others I've had in this vain, recommended!"
"Some caramel malts in the nose. Taste is nothing special. Not as malty sweet as my favorite dopplebocks...in fact, there isnt much sweetness. Just a little in the beginning which quickly gives way to bitterness. There's actually more bitterness than I would expect from a bock (though this is my 1st single bock). I'm not good at identifying hops, but I think they are a little ""grassy"" in here (and I dont mean that in a good way). Finish is on the dry side and the bitterness lingers for a bit. Definitely not a malt-bomb. Overall very average. Not nearly as good as the fancy package would indicate. If you like bocks, try a single 1st and see if you like this...I wish I had."
"Drinkability  This was a fun drinker but it felt way over-the-top and out of character for the style."
"The appearance is clear and mahogany, with a massive steady head. Aroma is slightly skunky, which I personally enjoy - although I suspect this might be fairly old. Nonetheless, some caramel maltiness is in there and is enough to satisfy any malt lover. Taste is clean, yet malty. Nice toasted malt flavor, along with a toasted sesame flavor. Slightly sweet to compliment the roasted notes. Slight bitterness in the finish helps balance this out a bit.Drinkability if off the charts. I could pound this all night, and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.Excellent!!"
"This ""ur-bock dunkel"" is copper colored, and a tad hazy. The head didn't stick around as long as I'd expected, although when it was there it was fairly pleasant, an off-white little cap of snow over a deep, copper base. The aroma has a hints of bready, biscuity malt with a little toastiness to boot, and also a touch of skunkiness - generally, if I get a bad bottle I assume its a fluke but I don't consider skunkiness to be a fluke if the brew is in green bottle, which this one is. (a pet peeve). The flavor is possibly the saving grace, with an initial caramel sweetness followed by a robust, hearty cereal and grainy maltiness that dissolves into a little hoppy flavor and a full, balancing hoppy bitterness. However, the beer feels a little less full-bodied than I'd expect for the style. Finally, as far as drinkability goes - I'd have more, although I haven't had a lot of bocks and I expect there are others that are better. I'll keep searching though, so for now I give it a good drinkability."
"Pours with a three-finger white head that leaves a ton of lace. Clear deep amber color. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Strong malty nose. Starts sweet finishes with a slight hoppy bite, a good bock even with the green bottle. $2.10 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"This bock poured deep amber. Less golden than I usually expect a bock to come out of the bottle. It had a light ½ inch head, with just a trace of a lace as I sipped the beer. A stream, of champagne bubbles continuously tries to renew the head as it sits here in front of me. It smelled very malty, with deep candy overtones. The smell has a character of a dopplebock. Not as much hop on the nose. A sipAhh caramel up front, and finally the hops assert themselves mid drink, and the finish is a nice roasted malt flavor. A good execution of the bock style. It has a medium mouth feel and is very drinkable. Many bocks can overload the alcohol, and make them to much to drink as a session beer. This has a nice malty goodness that eases the alcohol punch."
"I generally prefer a more malty sweetness in bock beers than this."
"This is a solid Bock beer. Really wunderbar!"
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a light effervescence all over the tongue. A decently drinkable beer, it would be so much more so if the alcohol presence (only 6.5%) were more subdued. As it warmed it became somewhat more prevalent."
"I like this better than my numbers reflect, but it needs a little more of everything to be truly noteworthy."
"The beer after its departure from the green 11.2 ounce bottle sets in my Einbecker Bock glass a burnished copper color with a large tan head, which is semi-creamy in texture, the lace forms a thick curtain to drape the glass. Nose is sweet malt, caramel, and fresh, crisp, clean, you get the picture and or scent dont you? Start is quite sweet, nice malt profile, top is moderate in feel with the finish benign in its acidity, the hops a plentiful and spicy, quite dry and lingering aftertaste, a drinkable brew tis true."
"Strongly bitter at first with hops dominating the flavor. Malts sneak into the picture midsip only to be replaced again by a bitter finish that is unappealing."
"This is a nice, well-made bock beer. The green bottles thankfully had no bearing on the aroma or flavor of the brew. I would say that there are similarities to a doppelbock, this brew is lighter in body and flavor. It isn't exceptional, but this one ranks as ""pretty good"" in my book."
"I saw this one in the liquor store and figured I'd give it a try. I kind of thought it would be a lot better than it was although I will say this, its a pretty interesting beer. I expected this to be darker than it was. It poured a dark reddish, almost brown color. The smell was very coffee-ish. I thought that the taste was a bit of a combination of chocolate and coffee but there was something else in there that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The mouthfeel was quite nice, it was smooth and creamy. This beer is good but not as good as I had anticipated. It came in 6 pack with small roundish bottles with goldish paper and I really thought this one would be world class. Worth a try though if you find it."
" I have mixed feelings about this one. It's unlike any bock I've ever had, and the Euroskunk element that is here and there, is not something I care for. I suppose, overall, it has substantial complexities that make it worth trying again. I would have preferred a more substantial malt character that would have more successfully dominated the Euroskunk hops."
"The flavor profile leads with caramel malt sweetness and ends with a dry hop finish. Hops are prominent in the profile at all points. The beer carries its alcohol very well. A very nice big meal beer, and a great winter warmer session beer. Dont be turned off by the sulfur nose. Let it off-gas for a minute or two, and forgive it."
"Clear in body, color is a light amber with a slight copperish tone, a quick puffy off-white head appears swiftly and crumbles away nearly just as fast leaving a thin collar always present and very minimal spots of lace. Aroma is slightly sweet of malts with a burnt-like toffee, notes of wet old grass; crisp and light on the nose overall. Taste is has a quick little start thats thinnishly silky where then, just past midway some slightly twinged grassy and earth toned hops and burntish malts begin to mingle for a bit then the hops fade off leaving some burntish toffee across the palate as it finishes with a soft dryness and subdued crispness. Feel has a bit of texture in the carbonation leaving behind some twingy burnt malt burps with a passable medium fullness throughout. Its a bit slow moving at first but kinda grows on ya as you go. This seems to be something that would go well around a bonfire to me, why, I couldn't say, it just does. Something simple, yet with a bit of interest and a nice warming of 6.5% would make it a good fire side drink."
"Mouthfeel is nice and alive and alcohol back end is warming and pleasing. Earthy and grassy notes make drinakability a little lower but overall not a bad beer."
"Clear amber hue, coppery highlights, it is a very lovely color, the off-white head reached a half finger in size, and it quickly faded to a soapy residue. No lace was produced. The nose is unimpressive, sweet maltiness, strong influences of grassiness, sulfur, oddly Euro-lager in nature. Frankly, the bouquet repulses me. The palate is malty sweet, hints of caramel, grassy in the middle, which I didnt care for, the finish is pleasantly hoppy-bitter, a saving grace IMO. Im not trilled by the huskiness or the slight nuttiness in the taste. The aftertaste is long with tacky sweetness and faint hops bitterness. I dont know what to make of this beer, it is dissimilar to any Bock Ive had. The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate, a nice accomplishment, but it does warm the belly. Medium in body, a touch light, the carbonation is very modest and the mouthfeel is slightly slick. More malt would work nicely, oh well. I paid $3.00 for a 11.2 ounce green bottle in Omaha, honestly this would not be worth drinking if it was free. The nose ruins any favorable impression of this beer; I do like the hoppiness of the palate but little else. Not my cup of Bock, maybe it will work for you but I cant recommend it."
"Poured in a nice Einbecker Dunkel glass .. dark coffee bean color with a good head. Lacing present throughout the glass. Not much nose to speak of, but the falvors were deep, dark and full bodied. Sweet rich icey cool malt flavors with little hop flavors. Mild hop flavors on the back end, but clearly malts rule this beer. There was good body to this beer as it crossed the tounge and coated my mouth with flavors of plums, figs and tobacco. The nose opened up a little as the galss warmed, but always it was the rich sweet malts that dominated. A nice representation of the bock style."
"Worth trying...one is enough for me but others might like the flavors a little more than me..."
"Light cream colored head was foamy in apperance and left a little bit of lace. The beer is dark amber in color and fairly clear. Sweet malty aroma. There's not much going on with the flavors. A very mild sweet alcoholic maltiness is followed up by a bitter metalic aftertaste. The flavor is not as sweet as the aroma suggests, but then again there really isn't that much to the flavor."
"This ur-bock poured a clear, coppery red color with good white foam that settled. The smell was a sweet, floral and vinous aroma with a touch of biscuit. Interesting. The taste was mildly sweet and floral, almost flowery. There was a vinous flavor (dark grape skins), as well as malt, oak, and a hint of caramel. The hops came out in the finish. There was a slightly detectable alcohol taste. The mouthfeel was smooth and fruity with medium body and carbonation. It was somewhat warming with a dry finish. This was a nice and very interesting beer, unlike any other bock I have every tasted."
"This pours clear golden brown. It has a light body along with a lousy flavor. The alcohol is far too apparent. This is a Loser. Save your money. Please avoid this beer"
"This brew pours a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles that lasted a fair amout of time and a semi-opaque brown body. It has a nice mild malty aroma. Its flavor is a bit fizzy for a Dunkel and mild with hints of malt and lacking any real distinctive flavor."
"This brew pours the color of a tarnished penny with a slight layer of film-like head. Very muddy, thick, wet malt aroma with subtle hints of chocolate -- non-descript as far as many beers are concerned but fairly potent, I think, as a lot of bocks go. Medium-bodied and offers the mouth a slight tingly feeling. Light acidic -- like the lemon filling in a pastry -- pushes into a malty flavor dominated by a sloppy, wet mouthfeel -- pumpernickel and light caramel notes. Pretty drinkable for a beefy brew."
"Solid dunkel bock with a mahogany color and roasted qualities.. Alcohol is prevalent at the final sip of the glass as the head is creamy and the mouthfeel velvety.. this dunkel is wel known and well made a bit skunky at first.. must be those green bottle.. but it does subside after a few minutes."
"11.2 oz bottle. Slight skunkiness upon opening, but quickly disappeared. Pours a deep copper, with not much head. Thin lacing on the glass. Heavy malt aroma. Taste of sweet malts and a hint of caramel. Low carbonation, and a sticky/sweet mouthfeel almost like a barleywine. A good kick back and relax sipping beer"
"pours out a deep copper colour with a foamy head the dies down to a sticky thin layer of lace. a rather nondescript aroma of sweet malts. a pretty sweet and stiff malt profile doesn't give up a lot in the flavour department...typical bock hardiness with soft german malt and hop notes. as it warms a bit the malt profile comes through a bit with dunkel notes of toastiness...hints of cocoa and caramel complimented by ghostly dark fruits. definite hoppiness for a bock...and an alcohol kick to round things out. at first i thought this a rather boring brew...but as it warmed the complexity shines through. it finishes rather dry...maybe showing it's age. a nice smooth mouthfeel lets all this german goodness go down quite easily. this bottle was a little old, explaining the relaxed flavour profile, dryness and smoothness and drinkability. a rather nice german bock."
"Note: this comes in a dark green bottle and there was the slightest hint of skunk on the open, none in the pour."
"Translucent copper with a frothy white head... settles to about 1/4 inch. Sweet carmel malt aroma with a touch of herbal hops. Flavor was very much on the sweet side with carmel being the dominant flavor... almost cloying... with only slightly herbal notes offer a little balance. Syrupy and thick, with medium carbonation. The sweetness and thickness lower the drinkability."
"Better than the Urbock hell. Low head. Pleasant malty / toffee aroma. Slightly nutty flavour. Strong alcohol presence, fairly well balanced with the malts and hops. A decent bock, but not as good as the Norwegian ones (esp. Aass)."
"Quite a herbal nose, mixed in with a bit of a dark malt character ( bit of chocolate, bit of roastiness). Quite a sticky malt start, syruppy texure and a bitter herbal flavour, not as good as the Urbock Hell i think, i think the paler malts worked better."
"Pours with a beautiful just off-white rocky head, topping light brown/amber liquid. Nose is of sweet malt, natch. Very appetizing too I might add. Taste is superb, lightly sweet malt followed by an almost dominating hop bitterness. Hops win out in the finish, with the maltiness of the grain creating an interesting interplay on the palate. This is one of the classics here, boys! The not-so-heaviness makes this beer very easy to drink plenty of. The original Bockbier, try it if you see it. Well worth the $8 I paid for a sixer. Tastes all the much better out of the ""official"" Einbecker Ur-Bock glass, to boot!"
