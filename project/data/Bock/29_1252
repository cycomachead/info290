Nice color, absolutely no foam, no lacing etc. smell is pleasant enough, malty but slightly vinegar like. malty slightly fruity flavor, no hop flavors discernable at all, lightly watered down, very little carbonation. overall is an option for sure when out places that don't offer better selections, definantly drinkable, especially over some of the other ab junk.","The-Beav","Mar 03, 2015"

3.31,15.3,4,3,3.25,3.5,3.5,"This one was a sacrificial lamb left in my beer fridge after mopping the floor with one of my friends at the poker table. Seeing as how Michelob was a gateway beer for me, (ala Killians, Heineken, etc) I had to give it a go again for nothing other than nostalgia. The bottle pours in to a fluted glass with a sudsy vanilla head atop a translucent walnut brown lager. The head settles quickly in to a thin layer of foam with an appealing collar. It has an appetizing appearance, I'll give it that. The nose is fairly subdued, with a malty smell and fruity undertones. A bit of copper-like aroma as well. It's a slightly more sophisticated fragrance than Bud. Typical AB flavor profile with a beefed up malt presence and a bit of toffee sweetness. Slight fruitiness through the middle with no discernible hop character and only a hint of any balancing bitterness. Some lingering corn flavor and only the faintest suggestion of toasted malts in the finish. This is billed as 100% malt, but the aroma/flavor certainly lead one to believe that there are some adjuncts in the mix. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, with a light, slick body. Gulpable, crisp and refreshing. An easy quaff that's pretty clean. Is it a bock? No. It's a pig with lipstick. However, just because I can pull out the common threads from lesser beers like Bud, doesn't mean that it's a bad beer. I rather enjoyed it. It's a dark American lager . Basic, but better than most beer enthusiasts would have you believe. Now, bring back that signature Michelob bottle!","JohnnyI","Feb 09, 2015"

3.79,32.1,4.25,3.25,4,3.5,4,"I gotta say I really like this beer. Its appearance is very dark, with a thick frothy head. I poured it into a glass with a rounded bottom, per the instructions, and the head retained for the length of my drinking. Really nice malty taste. I could have a ton of these. I've always enjoyed Michelob Light as one of my favorite Macros, as its a good balance of taste and drinkability, but I've never really experimented with the offerings of the Michelob brand. Mich Lager is like a beefed up Budweiser, but not so amazing that it needs to be tried. The RYE-P.A. was a tasty but short lived experiment, and michelob ultra is no good at all. But the Amber Bock was something I've passed by for years without trying and I'm glad i gave it a shot. The hallertau hops are a great smelling variant and the caramel malts are loud and proud here. You may be surprised how tasty this is. Its a beer that I feel I could grow tired of if its all I ever had, but then again that can be said with just about anything. You really ought to give this a try as I feel this is something that could be discontinued with lousy sales and I really would miss it.","bullwinkle88","Mar 27, 2013"

However, this Dark Lager Amber Bock isn't half bad. My expectations were very low for this, but I was encouraged with the darker pour. No smell of any note is present. As for taste, it is clean and fresh. There is a slight splash of vanilla or caramel in the taste, and the after taste is refreshing. Will I ever spend the $5.99 for a six-pack on this again? Only if I am broke. But for the price, it's not bad. Still, if I want cheap beer, I'll take Pabst Blue Ribbon or Grain Belt Premium.","Ilafan","Feb 24, 2013"

Gee, I had no idea that ""mahogany"" = deep-amber with NE-quality clarity. Very edifying. Equally edifying was the nose, which imparted caramel, but also a huskiness that was not required. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was too sweet for this kid. I like when lagers are given a chance to really age and dry out, but to each his/her own. It finished with a semi-dryness, but not enough to be compelling. I bought it as a single from my neighbor who had some in the singles case recently, and just like a good hippie, I will try anything once. This was a once and done for me, however.","woodychandler","Mar 31, 2012"

Decent amount of carbonation which makes this beer refreshing and not really a lip smacker. Caramel and a touch of biscuit quickly hit the palate before disappearing completelt. Very thin bodied. Imo it is a poor job by michelob for a bock.. but i will always have a place in my heart for this beer since it introduced me to a slight different style of beer during my bud light days.","intensify","Jan 27, 2012"

The head is tan and fades within a couple minutes. The smell is slightly sweet with a good amount of malt coming through. The taste is dry and sweet. It's roasted and has a very light wooden flavor to it. The mouthfeel is smooth and almost medium bodied. The beer is approachable and drinkable for sure.

There was a very small amount of thin lacing left behind. The aroma was a soft malty smell, maybe a sight amount of toasted malt. The bock tasted sweet and there was not much of a toasted malt flavor that you would expect from a bock beer. There is a very slight hint of hop bitterness. I would classify this as having a light to medium body. This beer is a nothing more then a gateway beer- if used for that purpose fine, but its good for not much else. This does not hold a candle to Shiner Bock.","GossageBrewery","Apr 26, 2011"

The color is that of a reddish brown rating a 28 on the SRM Beer Color Chart. I wish the smell and flavor measured up to the appearance...not. Smells like roasted wheat and corn, with a touch of malt sweetness. Taste has some hint of hops, but mostly corn, clover, sweet malt, and wheat, and not very well balanced. I like the creamy feeling in my mouth, second to the best part of the beer. It sort of grows on me as I drink a little more, and it warms just a little. Still a bit over talked for what I tasted.

The taste was a muddled combination of corn and barley with some decent caramel malt and a little toasted malt in the middle followed by a bitter macro finish.

An enthusiastic part of me wanted to give this one a higher rating but I have to be objective. By the way, a good question for A.B.: Why is it that Texas is offered ""Amber Ale"" as opposed to the ""Amber Lager"" sold in the other 49 states as stated on the label?

Although there was no real distinguishable smell to it, the taste of this beer wasn't bad at all. It gave a very smooth, sweet, and creamy flavor which I kinda liked, I'll admit it.

Bikini clad beauties were bouncing around, showing off what they had developed over the winter (quite a distraction from my relaxed reading and quite the chore of appearing disinterested with my girlfriend's harsh glare beating down upon the back of my neck). The smell of grilled shrimp and burgers wafted over me, exciting my remaining senses. I wandered over to the Tiki and noticed, with curious interest, Michelob Amber Bock on tap. Hmmm! How bad could it be? Well, despite my most excellent surroundings and laissez-faire attitude, the answer, to be kind is disgusting! Flat dark tan in color and rapidly vanishing off-white head. Sweet sugary malt and soaked corncob aroma. The pasty-mealy malt is difficult to swallow. This bland, sweet tasting, lightly hopped beer is in keeping with the A-B tradition of marketing over quality brewing techniques. Again A-B had the opportunity to enter the craft brew market by brewing a really fine bock beer. They chose instead, the road of mass-produced-type swill and major advertising campaigns. Argh!

2.55,-11.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"the last of my sampler pack was pretty unimpressive. the body is lacking it is thin and short on flavor. there are some malts hanging around, but not too much to it. something to make a macro drinker feel fancy.","ElGuapo","Nov 13, 2002"
2.46,-14.3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"As far as this being a mass produced beer it wasn't a bad attempt.  Atleast they are trying.  The color was really the only thing good about this beer. Dark, ruby, molassas in color.  The head and lace were almost non-existent.  The smell was slightly floral and malty.   But really non-existent.  The flavor had a malt, slight caramel,molassas, floral, carbonation taste to it.  I asked a buddy to try a sip and he is a Coor;s man and said that it wasn't bad for Michelob.  I agree, not bad for Michelob.","Jarod","Nov 11, 2002"
2.72,-5.2,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Medium amber, weak head and lace. Lighter than I think it should be. Slightly syruppy sweet and spritzy. Husky corn like finish. Totally lacking in body.  Obviously mean to give lawnmower beer drinkers the impression they are drinkingn something sophisticated.  Goes down smooth.","psugrad98","Nov 08, 2002"

3.04,5.9,4,2.5,3,3,3.5,"My verdict? A good AB product. I find it amusing that this is supposed to be a specialty brew, and the label explicity says that it is brewed with rice.  Try making an all malt brew next time, AB.","Beastdog75","Sep 16, 2002"
3.1,8,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"My first Michelob, I expected more I think. It pours dark brown with a good fluffy high-carbon tan head. A bit week on lace. I found the body of the beer week as well.Its a drinkable beer for its very smooth, sweet malty taste over little hop.After-feel of mouth is dry but waterlike in finish.","chilidog","Aug 30, 2002"
3.18,10.8,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"As others have said, it is an above average beer and should be tried before discounting it because it is made by AB.  Dark amber in color with moderate carbonation and head.  Slightly alcohol aroma which I deducted points for, but the flavor had a tinge of malt which I enjoyed.  It could use more though for the bock name.  Can usually be found fairly cheap which makes it all the more drinkable.","ryanocerus","Aug 07, 2002"
3.55,23.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Somewhat thinner than it could be, but this is a very drinkable beer.  My friends like to criticize on this beer, but I think its a decent, well made brew.  A touch more maltiness would help, but I've found it solidly enjoyable","Suds","Aug 03, 2002"
3.47,20.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nothing all that special, but I believe this to be an above average beer. I had it on draught, which is probably why I think that. Nice dark color with little head. Some bitterness in the flavor...but I was just appreciative that there was flavor.","IrishRedRock","Jul 21, 2002"
1.95,-32.1,2,2,2,1.5,2,"Unbelievably white-bread. It is difficult to even find anything to comment on. I am not an expert on Bocks but hopefully this is not the norm. Too plain for anyone but regular Michelob drinkers who feel like they are taking a risk.","Dogbrick","Jul 16, 2002"
3.5,22,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I have to admit, I was impressed with this one.  Even though it comes from Anheiser Busch, this is well balanced, with a little malty feel to it.  A nice aroma and a do-able head that laces towards the bottom of the glass.  Prost!","goindownsouth","Jul 09, 2002"
2.8,-2.4,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Nice and dark, tan head that. Slightly roasted on the nose with some fruit. Thinner then I expected. Not ovelry carbonated (which is refreshing). One of the better beers out of A-B.","packetknife","May 29, 2002"
2.51,-12.5,3,2,3,2.5,2,"What's this? An AB product that actually has some taste? I'll be damned. Dark amber/brown, lots of bubbles, dissipating white head. Not much aroma at all. Taste is not unpleasant, with a sweet, malty, caramel flavor. A bit too much carbonation, leads to bloating. Overall, however, not as bad as you might otherwise expect from these guys.","mophie","May 29, 2002"
2.83,-1.4,2.5,2,3,2,4,"It's easy to drink but not worth the premium price. It has that classic Anheuser-Busch blandness and mediocrity, attributable to the neutral ""house yeast"" they use, no doubt. Nothing strips the soul from malted barley as completely as A-B house lager yeast and a tight series of filters. There is such a small hint of roasted malt character, that if you are not concentrating, you may miss. So if you are eating spicy food, engaged in stimulating conversation or otherwise distracted, you will miss the shadow of the character remaining in this beer and you might as well be drinking regular Michelob.","EagleTalon","May 13, 2002"
2.66,-7.3,4,3,2.5,2,2.5,"Clear dark brown color.  Big-bubbled ""adjunct"" head, foams down in short order.  Sharp, acidic odor, much like most lighter colored macro lagers.  Just the slightest hint of roasted malt flavor (touch of anise and sweetness), but very soon, attenuated by a crisp but non-descript hop and adjunct flavor.  Very little body or mouthfeel.  Aftertaste is nuetral rather than smacking of bitter-crisp carbonated water flavor.  Nothing to recommend it but the color.  At about a buck or so less a sixer than a standard micro, not even a good value.","ADR","May 06, 2002"
3.1,8,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Light brown in color, typically clear from the lagering, filtering, fining... whatever.  The head settles very quickly into a thin and unappetizing layer.  The aroma is very mild-- a slight caramel sweetness becomes present only as the beer warms. Bland but clean in flavor. An unexpected light Munich malt toasted flavor becomes noticeable after the prickly, overly effervsecent mouthfeel subsides. Corn sweetness is thankfully minimal.  There is no hop flavor whatsoever, but hop bitterness is definitely above the norm for an American macrobrew.  Finishes very dry and neutral.  (This is about as much a Bock as Shiner Bock is) Well, there aren't any flaws in this brew-- it's weak but super clean all around in profile, and I'll take it over any other American Dark Lager anyday. There's actually more than caramal coloring added to this one. Won't ever order it again, however.","marc77","Apr 25, 2002"
3.33,16,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Not to shabby for A-B. A bock though...I don't think so. Pours a nice clear amber color. Very refreshing brew, easy to drink, with a nice clean taste. Not bad at all...I would say the best from A-B that I have had so far.","WilliamPhilaPa","Apr 14, 2002"
2.08,-27.5,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,"Any so called premium that sports a label trumpeting the fact they use rice in the beer should be taken behind the shed and shot. It looks like a rich dark beer, but its an illusion.  Its a pale imitation of a dark beer with that grainy Bud aftertaste.  Pass on it.","jackndan","Mar 26, 2002"

3.1,8,3,3,3,3,3.5,"I like this beer. Its a bit thin, but it has a nice, somewhat sweet, malty taste to it. More of a dark lager than a bock. I know its customary to pile on the big brewers, but in this case, I think A-B has done a nice job. This may very well be A-B's best offering.","proc","Mar 18, 2002"
2.28,-20.6,3,2.5,2,2,2.5,"I had the same impression that the other guys had that this is definitely not an all malt beer.  Not a beer to taste by itself, needs pretzels,  popcorn, salted cashews or something.","John1985","Jan 14, 2002"
2,-30.3,2,2,2,2,2,"Had this stuff in Tampa (go figure). Started out a session with it at an outdoor downtown happy hour festival. It was the lesser of the evil swill. Tasted like runnings from overboiled mixed vegetables. It served its purpose I suppose. Other than that this is typical of what AB thinks a ""specialty"" brew is.","John","Jan 10, 2002"
2.3,-19.9,2,2,2,3,3,"Ugh..  Crystal clear dark brown amber.  Has a standard 'dirty' alchoholic scent, like Rice Crispies or Cherios.  Reminds me a lot of regular Michalob or Coors.  A slight roasted malt flavor.  Clean finish.  No character, absolutely no complexity.  Made with the finest Barley, Hops, Water, Yeast, and Rice!  Wow, I've got rice grandeur in my beer!","Jordan","Dec 05, 2001"
1.5,-47.7,2,2,1,1,2,"It kind of looks like a beer and it kind of smells like a beer, but it tastes like Michelob with caramel coloring added.  I guess that is what makes it go down so smooth <sarcasm>","geckointhebox","Oct 29, 2001"
