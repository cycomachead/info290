"Deep red in color. Malty aroma with a hint of cherry. I’m tasting some fruits in this brew too. Mild chocolate flavor. Its OK."

"O - New Glarus' Dan Carey is a brewing genius, especially when it comes to German style beer, which is no surprise considering his time spent across the pond. Uff-da is a pretty simple bock overall but it's lack of defect and flourishing bready and nutty malt profile make it damn delicious. This beer is one of the best examples of the style you can lay lips on."

"Overall: A very solid take on a Bock. Good dark toasty malt notes with a decent hop backing."
""

"O - Solid brew, as expected from NG."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A run of the mill Bock. The malt could have been more complex but a decent beer."
"Mouthfeel is good. Moderate carbonation and medium body leave this smooth soft and fluffy."
""
""
""
"This is a wonderful bock that I would consider closer to a doppelbock than a bock. A malty delight!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Bocks are tasting more delicious every time I try one. I enjoyed every sip down to the bottom of the glass."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with medium-low levels of carbonation, resulting in a slightly foamy (1/4) and smooth (3/4) mouthfeel that feels right for the beer and the style in general. Closes dryly, with moderate to heavy stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
""
""

""
""
"Uff-da pours a dark brownish color, with a small lacing head. There is a sweet bold caramel and doughy aroma. The taste has a nice rich maltyness, with hints of carmal, with a sour dough finish. Good full body, good flavors. Overall a rich and flaverfull bock."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a really decent bock. The sweetness is not over the top like other bock's can be. This one does not disappoint!"
"Recommendation - Pass"
"Overall: a very easy drinking bock that has some great levels of complexity and depth. The sweetness is kept in balance well with the earthy tones."
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"O. This is a really good bock that I didn't appreciate and drink enough off when it was part of NG's regular line up. Glad they're bringing this back on a seasonal basis. Well made lager that is worth seeking out."
"Holy hell...this is amazing. I'm not usually a big fan of bocks, but this is a bullseye. The blend of toasted and sweet malt, with so much biscuit delicious, and floral hops fluttering in the background....wow."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice bock. Malty but not cloying, rich but drinkable."
""
""
""
"This pours a clear, medium brown color with a foamy, beige head. The aroma is filled with toasted malts. The taste is filled with grains, yeast, and malts making it very well-balanced. There are hints of oak and caramel as well. This is a nice re-release of brew that I never had the chance to try and it did not disappoint."

"O - This one might have been better when it was fresh...just a one man show here now...the roast is still strong with minimal sweetness and some chocolate notes lingering"
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It had a a small fizzy white head that disappeared really quickly. The smell is of roasted malts and some chocolate hints. The taste is the same as the smell, roasted malt and very deep rich chocolate to the taste. The mouth feel is really good and overall is a good bock."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours chocolately dark brown with inch of white/tan foam. Slow settling. Hearty malt smell. All malt taste - mixture of chocolate, cola, vanilla, even root beer. Fades out, very smooth. Nothing bitter about it. Little cloying in the finish, but chewy to get there. Nice classic bock, loads of malt. Beer."

"I didn't have high hopes, but definitely glad I finally got around to trying this tasty beer. Although it may not be season appropriate beer style, I think it goes nicely with the cool weather. Good beer across the board."

"O- Very rich caramel and dark fruit flavors. A great staple bock, but I again feel this beer just isn't the same as the old. Maybe it's just me. Still a solid beer that will always have a special place in my heart."
"D - not uberly complex, but I could drink this all night. The abv is a bit high on it to be a session beer, but I could definitely take down a six pick on a brisk fall night."
"Bottle from Reilly's in Madison. Way too sweet. Above average mouthfeel, drinkable as dessert at the end of a big meal, but not something I was able to finish or would seek out again. Maybe that's why the label recommends drinking cold if you don't enjoy the sweetness. A little colour, yes mahogoney, and a little head."
"O: This is a good offer from New Glarus. A solid, straight forward bock."
"Overall a good bock. Not my favorite style or New Glarus offering."
"I'll tell you that NG is doing great, great things with their beers and even more so with their specialty beers. This and the IIPA Thumbprint are total favorites of mine and I wish I could get them on a regular basis. Excellent work NG."
"Overall a pretty solid beer. I don't have a lot of experience with bocks but this is a good one."
"Overall, this beer isnt one of New Glarus's highlights in my opinion. An average bock."
"D/O- I've done a side by side comparison of this batch and the newest (2011) batch and preferred this one...a lot more flavorful at the expense of a not-so-pretty appearance. In conclusion, aging Uff-Da for 3 years is a worthwhile experiment. Thanks for the try/tick TATURBO."
"Mouthfeel is on the fuller side but its not chewy or tough to drink a full glass. This has always been one of my favorite Bocks and I'm happy to see it back in rotation."
"O- this isn't too hot. It's just kind of there"
"Another winner from New Glarus."
"""Uff da"" was a common expression in my grandparents household and consequently, the beer had long been on my ""to try"" list. New Glarus rarely disappoints, but really enjoyed this one."
"O: This is a great brew, with a very well rounded balance. Good from start to finish, but lacks with the aroma, even when warmed. Smooth and drinkable with solid flavors that well represent the style."
"Maybe I've been drinking too many doppelbocks of late, but this one seemed a bit on the weak side for a bock. This isnt really a knock, just an observation."
"Taste & Mouthfeel: Very smooth, subtle hoppiness. Extremely enjoyable brew, even went well with a small piece of chocolate (I had to try it) and is on the list of beers I would buy again."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. I don't have a lot of experience with bock-style beers in general, so I really didn't know what to expect. Poured a dark brown with nary a head to speak of. Smell is on the malty, caramel side of things. The taste is real sweet. Hints of cherries, vanilla, and even a little toffee. Did I mention this was sweet? Overall, this was a very pleasant surprise. I'd definitely like to try this particular beer again so I could have more time getting familiar with the subtle nuances present. Definitely recommend this."
"O: This beer is excellent. It's a really solid rendition of the style, it's not pricey, and it's fresher than most Germans available for purchase. Definitely trumps other American bocks I've had. I don't know how this isn't an A beer."
"Dark coppery brown, reddish highlights, feeble skim of tan foam that settles quickly, with splotchy areas on the surface. Texture is smooth and the foam is slightly sticky on the lips. Sweet and malty aroma, toasted grains and an indistinct nuttiness. Flavors are similar, malt heavy with some maple sweetness, bitter tobacco, and nutty richness. Toasty grain, minor dried fruit notes, dates, caramel. Body is medium, and it feels somewhat full. Allow to warm as the label advises, and it opens up a bit more. Best served cool and not cold."
"O-I picked up some New Glarus beers when I was in Milwaukee a few weeks ago, I wasn't impressed with the Unplugged one that I got but this one is great, I can't wait to try some others"
"Overall, a good bock that I enjoyed even on this blistering summer day. Recommend. I don't often go for bocks these days but this one would be the exception. Not avail here in TX - good in goody shipment from ummagum. If avail near me, I'd get the occasional single. [O;O]"
"O) A pleasant brew. A nice malt bomb. I'd definitely have another."
"Overall - Very rich and flavorful. Somewhat unusual choice for a summer seasonal, but typically well done."
"This is a decently nicely executed doppelbock/dukler bock, but it is nowhere near some German examples."
"Overall: Extremely drinkable, closed my eyes and I was in Munich on the first sip."
"Has tons of bready, earthy, roasty malt character in each sip without leaning too heavy on the roastiness. Semi-sweetness is entirely coming across as from the malts. There are also some heavy dark fruit esters present in the nose, complementing the denseness of this brew quite nicely. And also the ABV is well hidden, I can't find the hotness of the alcohol anywhere. A solid hearty brew all around."
"O -- Now I recall why I don't like NG calling this a bock, it has too much roasted malt going on to fit the character expected. It's definitely a good, well-crafted and delicious beer -- I just wish there was more bready, toasted malt character -- say, as in the Two Women lager!"
"Cheers!"
"Thick, thick mouthfeel, with no apparent carbonation left in the liquid."
"Thanks to TATURBO for this one in a trade! This beer poured out as a dark brown color with some red highlights. The head disappeared within a few seconds, not much lacing really. The smell of the beer has a lot of sweet malts and a light earthy aroma. The taste of the beer gives off a bit of a dark fruity flavor with a little brown sugar and prune flavors. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Overall it wasn't too bad of a beer. But not the best Bock I've had."
"O- At this point, I expect tastefully bold beers from New Glarus every time, and this one hasn't let me down. A testament to the potential for complexity and intrigue in lager beers, Uff-da continues my recent streak of experiencing inspired beers from Wisconsin."
"O/D- I really like this one. A lot. Easy to drink but oh so satisfying. This one was picked up straight from the brewery, almost as good as it gets."
"O) Another solid offering from NG. One might wish to heed the advice on the label and let this warm up a little, as it does bring out flavor and showcase complexity."
"O- tasted more like a dubbel to me..one is all i would drink too sweet"
"Thanks to friend schmittymack for sharing this one with me at our mini (and unintentional) New Glarus fest 2 weeks back. Poured a reddish color with less than a quarter inch of light brown foam on top. Aromas of chocolate, caramel and sweet malt. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of chcolate, caramel and sweet malt."
"In the mouth, much the same. At a cooler temp, it's a delicious bock, with a chocolatey tinge and a nice grainy, malty kick. Once warmed up, the grains give out a rich buttery mouthfeel, dark chocolate and coffee. Really outstanding. A filling beer...why they released it in Spring/Summer is beyond me, but i'll take it."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Like I said it would make for a very good winter warmer, and it pairs well with pretty much whatever you throw at it. Check it out if you can."
"OVerall - Not that impressive, honestly. Lacking balancing hop bitterness, the malt character leans to hard toward the dark fruit spectrum, and the mouthfeel lacks crispness."
"Drinkability: A very good winter beer — which I am drinking in the very late spring."
"Latest bottling of this one, shared with friends and my girlfriend last night. Poured a ruby red, nearly brown color with a small head that didn't hang around very long. Picked up roasted malt and fruit in the nose. Taste is where this one comes through in my opinion: caramel, toasted malt, some fruitiness, and just a touch of cocoa. This is the first time in about three years or better I've had this ""fresh"" and I wasn't disappointed. One of Mr. Carrey's better efforts: I could quaff a few of these."
"I rather enjoyed this New Glarus effort, as this was quite flavorful and complex for a Bock beer, while also retaining a pretty good drinkability for the size. This would definitely be a good one to chew on during those cooler months."
"D - A decent beer. I was expecting more flavor/aroma for 7+%."
"Uff-Da is a good, easy-drinking beer with a lot of kick! Seems a little bit big for the standard bock style and could be seen as dangerously-drinkable, but altogether I consider it a perfect seasonal sipper."
"Overall a nice easy beer to drink, maybe just a little too sweet for my taste. The over 7 abv can sneek up on you as this goes down so quick."
"DELICIOUS OFFERING, GIVE IT A WHIRL!"
"Overall very pleasant with just a little more bitterness and maybe a little too little sweetness. Good richness."
"O: A delicious beer. A doppelbock in training. Very nice job again by New Glarus! This will be a standard in my fridge while available."
"Overall, this is the first time I've had this beer and I love it. I think it's very good for the style. Extremely smooth and drinkable. Could be a bit thicker/more malty but still very good."
"Pours a moderate brown color. Light head and a small amount of lacing. The nose brings some nice caramel characteristics plus some light fruit, hints of chocolate, and a bit of bread. The taste is similar but a bit subdued with some light caramel and toffee plus some doughy bread. Good feel with nice carbonation. A bit plain, but drinks fairly well in the end."
"Pours a black color with a little ruby hue, thin tan head and a little lacing. Smells of burnt sugar, roasted malts, and a little chocolate. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and burnt brown sugar. Mouthfeel is average and a thin body with slight carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"overall - very tasty beer. I'm new to bocks, but this is a great introduction. It reminds me a lot of some of the scotch ales i've had."
"BA states retired - too bad, I enjoyed it and always like supporting locals."
"It is a huge shame that this is retired. This is probably the most enjoyable bock I have ever drank."
"Taste, sweet, strong, malty, even a dash of zest from maybe a little more hop presence than I was expecting. Mouthfeel hangs around, doesn't grow, or contract, somewhat drinkable for a bock."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, a bit of warmth going down. Very clean malty character, I dig this one a lot. Can;t remember where I got this, but thanks to whomever!"
"D-I really like this beer, but feel that it's not holding up consistently with age. I had a couple a week ago and they were much better than this one I'm reviewing. However, the alcohol is hidden very well in this beer, and I hope they put it Uff-Da back into their 2010 beer schedule."
"Pours a very dark brown, a deep beautiful dark brown, with a nice 2cm head, but the bubbles are loose and falls down, leaving only a little bit of lacing. The beer is fairly clear, if you can see through the darkness. The smell is incredibly sweet and nutty, like toffee, raisins, thick heavy caramellized syrup - reminds me a bit more of like an english barleywine, or a more cleanly fermented dark belgian. I wish it was maybe a bit less on the toffee, almost buttery taste, a bit cleaner, with some real graininess - I expected more graininess, a little bit of toastiness, but I'd say that the sweetness is ok. I don't know if the grains are right in this, or maybe by experience with bocks has just been a bit confused. The taste is good. Very bready, and quite grainy, very sticky, some of the nice qualities of a bock, but still too raisiny and toffee-y for a bock, it's like a delicious blend of belgian, german, and british, to be honest, but it says right there on the bottle ""Uff-Da"" (which I recently learned from someone is Norwegian, so out goes the German implications there - thanks weatyweiss) with a neck label that says ""Bock", should be fully german, and I don't know if it is. Maybe if some of the caramel malt was replaced with chocolate malt (and maybe some pale malt to balance out the color) this would be a bit better, though honestly I don't dislike it. The body is good, nice and thick, very sticky, with a nice light carbonation, nothing sharp, very good there. This is definitely a slow drinkier. If I step back and drink this, without knowing what style it's supposed to be, I woudl actually like it. It's like a cold-fermented belgian style to me (just think of it without quite the same yeast profile). The ABV is a little high, but I expected it. I'm going to give this a kind of higher drinkability (and some higher things because it's pretty good, it's just that it doesn't seem exactly right for a bock)."
"Slightly watered down medium body with some silky chocolate malt notes and some roasted coffee notes. Sweet caramel flavor with hints of toffee, coffee bean, bitter dark chocolate, burnt toast and slight hazelnut. Hops are very subtle but there is a nice bitterness in the finish from the dark chocolate. ABV is well masked."
"Poured into a pint glass the beer is dark brown red color. A decent amount of beige head dissipates rather quickly leaving no lace at all. The aroma is sweet malt with hints of chocolate, dried fruits and fresh baked pretzles. The flavor is sweet right out of the gate. I taste raisins and dates. some light chocolate and a heavy alcohol esther. It slowly fades to a bready maltiness. That goes bone dry on the tongue. Medium to light body. It seems a tad thin to me. Plenty of carbonation. Overall a decent beer from New Glarus. I'm not sure I would rush out for a sixer but, a worthy beer for sure."
"Drinkability isn't bad, but it isn't great either. I don't crave another, and I don't really think this is one that would stand up to the increased scrutiny of repeated consecutive drinking."
"Nice, easy drinking beer by another great WI brewery."
"Dark brown pour with 3 finger head that leaves some lacing behind. Smell is light biscuity malts with some caramel sweetness mixed in. Taste is rye bread with faint grassy hop notes. Body is medium to full for the style. This was a nice little beer. Not memorable, but worth drinking if the opportunity presents itself."
"Note: This beer does change fairly remarkably as it warms; maltier aromas and flavors emerge the closer to cellar temperature it gets, but it still just doesn't quite shine"
"overall a nicely done bock...im not sure how old this bottle is or of its the age that has deteriorated this bottle....one i would have liked to tried this one fresh.."
"Not bad overall, but not as great as I'd hoped. Probably wouldn't have another right away, or seek it out."
"D-It is very drinkable I see that it is retired on this website, but I picked some up at the brewery on 8/8/09...so maybe they're going to year round this beer. Update I purchased a case at Woodman's in Kenosha on 8/17/09."
"Taste is more caramel malts and some toffee. Good amount of carbonation in the mouthfeel and very drinkable. More dark roasted malts in the finish. Leaving a very roasty flavor in the mouth. Very nice bock."
"(D)- What an interesting bock! Rich like a stout with the sweetness characterized by its style. Very special since it is no longer made, but I am glad I grabbed the last one off the shelf!"
"Very smooth mouth feel with some bubbles but not high carbonation. This beer is quite drinkable; too bad it is retured."
"I didn't realize this was retired when I opened it. I should have had some little ceremony for my first time opening a beer that is no longer available. At any rate, it's drinking pretty nice for a bock right now. I feel kinda bad because I'm just not a big fan of the style or, at least, I haven't found a bock to love yet. Uff-da pours a dark amber brown that shows a ruby shade in the light. The aroma is fairly rich with caramel malt, and while there isn't a ton else going on, it's still quite pleasant. The flavor is a tad sweet around the edges, but there's enough spiciness to keep it from being cloying. It's a malty treat, but I don't have the sweet tooth to want a second glass."
"Overall I liked this beer and I don't believe it deserves the harsh scores I saw before mine. An ""A" it is not, but it is also not a ""C" beer. I'm not sure how the authorities could be this far off."
"Pours dark ruby, appearing almost black when held away from the light. After the initial splash of the pour settles, the head rapidly dissipates to small whisps of bubbles that cling to each other mostly at the edge of the glass, with a few brave bubble strands venturing inland. The smell is mostly a moderate one-note: toffee. The taste follows suit: you get a clean, pleasant taste of toffee with a slight roasted coffee flavor underneath (there is no actual coffee in the beer). There's a slight acidity to the finish that doesn't quite belong, but it's not too distracting. Nothing terribly complex or challenging here, but not all beers have to be. This is a good bock: nothing more, nothing less."
"Drinkability: Well...I'm not a fan. It just doesn't taste like much of...anything, and certainly not a beer. I'm not really sure what New Glarus was going for here...but I just didn't get it. Probably won't have again."
"Pours a dark brown with an amber color along the bottom and edges of the glass. One and one-fourth inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, slight aclohol, slight caramel, and yeast cleanliness. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt up front, brown sugar, slight roasted malt, some yeast cleanliness, and slight hop in the background."
"D- Drinkable, but not all night"
"D= I'm not liking this bock as much as some others I've had. New glarus is a pretty nice brewery but I just feel like they have a very average year round collection. This is no exception. Not a great bock and barely even a good one."
"D: Decent. I would drink one more, but I wouldn't buy a six pack."
"This is very much a beer to let warm a bit first before you drink it, and the label actually suggests this. What at first seemed a bland beer did improve with warming. While not a standout beer, not a bad one either."
"Overall: Really good drinkability, really nice fruity flavors but not too sweet. Roasted malt helps balance out the sweet flavors to give a well balanced bock!"
"Trying another NG beer here thanks to some great extras from brian23456. Seems like I've had 3-4 beers from this brewery now and they all tend to be traditionally non-American style brews. Interesting. This bock pours a very dark red, ruby highlights and not much head. Pretty color. Nose is malt heavy, fruity, with notes of cherry. Nice roasty flavor, nutty and lots of fruity notes, mainly cherry, malty. Excellent full body on the palate. Nice complexity and a really flavorful brew. A unique take on the style."
"Extremely dark brown color and approaching black. The label described it as mahogany and it could be. The label also boasts being brewed in the reinheitsgebot tradition. There is a light foam head that is thicker around the edges. As I let it sit and made my initial notes the head actually ""creamed up"" where most beers the head will dissipate. There is a sweet and smooth malt attack. Faint traces of coffee are present in the finish. Very creamy mouthfeel. The finish leaves one with something of a warming sensation in the throat and belly. Very understated chocolate notes are striking the outside edges of my tongue. There is some chocolate in the aftertaste. The longer I let this beer sit the more pronounced the flavors became. I had to attend to a crying child, so that left some time. It is pretty sweet and malty compared to what I normally prefer, but I really enjoyed this."
"Medium body, very smooth and rich. Light carbonation. I find this very drinkable, and the 7.3% ABV is not noticeable at all. If this were available in my area, I would be getting this all the time."
"Pours dark brown with ruby tones in colour with light tan one finger head. Smell - roasted malts and dark chocolate. Very nice aroma. Taste - roast malts once again, some chocolate and caramel, bitternes coming from alcohol. Interesting and complex taste. Mouthfeel - rich, pretty smooth. Alcohol is slightly noticable, so drinkability is not as high as it could have been. Overall - very interesting solid brew."
"D: This one is easy to drink. I am not a huge lager drinker but this beer reminds me that I need to explore German lagers more than I have in the past. Very enjoyable. New Glarus tends to deliver, so not surprises there. A quality brew."
"One finger tan head on aggressive pour, black body. Not much head retention on this one. Very light smells, malts, just slightly on the nose. Nice and slightly sweet on the tongue, more as it warms. Almost perfect mouthfeel for a bock, I really like this one. Its a good, relatively light style, tasty enough, good mouthfeel and drinkability. Thanks to Taturbo for the NG's!"
"D - This is simply a fantastic and flavorful bock from New Glarus. Very nicely done and certainly on par with their excellent fruit beers."
"D: Its pretty good which is why I find the short duration of flavor to be upsetting."
"New Glarus makes killer beer. Uff-da is no exception. It's not complex and it really doesn't need to be. It is a very nice Bock that's all-around well done. For the style, it'd be tough to do much better. I'm not crazy in love with the style, but did enjoy this one quite a bit. Easily recommended."
"I feel bad knocking this down, but it's not quite roasty enough or silky enough for a good porter or stout, and not as refined as I'd like in a bock, with a focus more towards dark malts as opposed to the breadier, toastier, maltier ones I associate with a bock. This is a GOOD BEER, and I'm not a stickler for style, but not what I was looking for here, and a bit deceiving."
"D- It's a pretty good bock. You could enjoy more than one in a setting."
"Definitely something I would drink a lot of if it were available in FLA."
"Overall: Well carbonated with a medium body. Drinkability is fine on it, although I didn't like the taste I could drink a few."
"Drinkability is good but some of the alcohol seems to seep in and inhibit this."
"Drinkability- Very easy to drink--not all that special or unique, but fairly sessionble."
"Drinkability: Nothing wrong with this one, but - though I haven't had too many bocks before, and though this is one of the better ones - it's still only a little better than average in my book. I actually typed ""bock"" the first time I typed ""book"" back there, hm. Anyway. Definitely not my favorite from New Glarus, which was (and still is) fast becoming one of my favorite breweries along with Founders, Tyranena, and Bell's. Forget California - the midwest is where it's AT."
"Slick and creamy mouthfeel, heavy but not too. Very smooth, very drinkable, with dinner or afterwords, your choice. Can't think of a Bock I like better, thanks New Glarus."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. This beer is so smooth, it really goes down exceptionally well. The flavors are complex and yet not overpowering, lending to the drinkability. A really good beer, I'm sad to see it go."
"Overall, I would drink a few of these bad boys, but I may have missed the boat here. At least I had the chance to review it. A fine beer, and I just now looked at the ABV, and alcohol is hidden really well, for being in the 7% range. Not a trace."
"D= Incredibly drinkable! This is an outstanding beer and easily my favorite bock-style beer."
"Overall I was thoroughly impressed as I usually am by everything from New Glarus, this one though was sublime and a wonderful beer for xmas."
"D - For as thick and as dark as this beer is it drinks very smoothly. Not to mention the 7.3% ABV is completely hidden. This is a great brew for the winter and those who appreciate dark beer."
"A delicious bock. Poured into a small-ish mug this is almost a light brown-red in color with an ample rocky head. Nutty, caramel malt nose. Tasty caramel malt and toffee flavor are balanced by a neutral hop bitterness, but more importantly a slight hint of roasted coffee. Soft mouthfeel, fairly full body. The finish is just a bit dry which enhances drinkability. On a damp, cold evening without any dinner I could drink more of these than I should. Mmm...bock."
"M/D - Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable. Definitely something that I could have multiple of."
"Bottle poured into pint glass, nice overall appearance with good lacing and medium head. Warm nutty aroma, with similar taste. Mouthfeel is a great flavor a first,however it leaves a bit of a dry feeling in your mouth afterward. All in all a good porter that's defialty worth a try."
"Drinkability- Not what I was expecting but it is very good. Surprisingly sweet and fruity with a fairly nice chocolaty aspect. The style police seem to be all over this one for the strong chocolate notes but I think it's great. Totally recommended!"
"It would be a shame if you have not tried this beir when you are a fan of bock style biers!"
"Uff....Da dis is good."
"Bottle: Poured a deep burgundy color bock with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of loads of caramel malt with a nice mix of toffee and molasses. Taste is also quite rich with some nice touch of caramel and a sweet finish including notes of toffee and molasses. I thought this was still easily drinkable while maintaining quite a malt bill along the way. I very much enjoyed this one and wouldn't mind having regular access to this."
"This is one of those Bocks that kinda borders on a Dopplebock. There isn't much complexity, but it's just straight forward good and damn drinkable to boot."
"D: This is an excellent drinking bock."
"D- certainly not my favorite new glarus, but one im glad to try for sure. one, maybe two, is plenty for an evening. this one isnt something id look for often if it was available in my area."
"Overall a quite tasty brew. Nice elegant flavor and a sweet but not too sweet taste."
"Good beer, but not the best I've had from NG. I'd probably go w/ this one in the winter months as a warmer type beer."
"Wow is probably one of the best words to describe this beer. It is absolutely amazing and well exceeded my expectations. I really recommend this beer to anyone, so if you go to Wisconsin, do yourself a favor and buy a sixer or more!"
"Drinkability is great on this beer. You will not be disappointed by this bock."
"D - hell yeah, this is a delightful bock beer."
"The flavor is rich and malty also, with a light mouthfeel. Complexity from good balance of bitterness from roasted malt and an understated sweetness. Very drinkable session beer (although alcohol pretty high to drink too many!)."
"It is a bit more robust than the other Bocks that I have had recently. The more traditional and not watered down characteristics make it very enjoyable. The foaminess sort of filled my stomach. I couldn't drink this all night but I could probably have two of these back to back and enjoy them."
"D: very drinkable brew as with nearly every New Glarus offering. I enjoy the style and enjoyed this take on it. Highly recommended."
"D: Very. Wonderful tasting brew that leaves you wanting more. No matter the style New Glarus does it right. Style after style Dan and the boys create world class brews. To that I tip my hat. New Glarus takes another one of my less than favorite styles and knocks it out of the park. I could drink these any day."
"Picked this up in a recent trade but cannot remember the source; thanks, unknown BA"
"D-7.3% ABV, really? I never would have guessed! This is nice stuff. I really like the smoothness and the rich toffee flavour. A well done malt bomb."
"I rated this beer a few months ago and I think my palette has improved a little. Not to mention knowledge. This is a very solid single bock. Great depth of flavor and finish. I think for the price, there is little better to be had. I get more coffee notes this time along with a deeper caramelized sugar flavor. Slight oakiness and dustiness. I think there is a yeast thing going on here I can't fully explain. There are heavier and more complex bocks out there, but this one is a very consistent solid offering."
"This is a very good drinkable bock from NG. I just wish I could get stuff from these guys without having to go to Wisconsin."
"D= very drinkable in lesser quantities but probably both too bold for too many, plus the ABV at 7.3% might catch up."
"While I wouldn't call this anything special, I'd be happy to return to it on a cold winter's day."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights with a minimal head a light lacing. Smells is roasted malts with some hints of dark fruit. Taste is very similar. Lots of candied dark fruits, rum-soaked raisins, a little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and cream with a full body, light carbpantion, and would be the perfect beer to drink of a cold winter's day rather than on the 4th of July, but it was delicious nonetheless."
"M:/D: Finishes with a sweetness of molasses, and chocolate. ABV at 7.8% is well hidden, but, really borders on a doppelbock instead of a bock. Easy to drink, if fact, almost too easy with the high ABV. I can sit and hang into a couple of these with no problem."
"Pours deep brown with reddish tint around the edged and a medium lived beige head. Smell is rich maltiness, metal, dark fruit and soy sauce. Taste is big on soy sauce right off the bat. Some figgy flavors, but mostly just getting that unpleasant soy flavor unfortunately and with some tart mollasses or maple. Just not for me."
"This is great, no doubt about it. The only real fault is that it becomes a little too sweet as it warms and maybe a hint more hops would've kept that in check. Still, this is one of the best lagers brewed in the US. Terrific!"
"Pours a dark, dark brown with hints of ruby around the edges. The head was minimal but did leave a good bit of lacing throughout. Smell was interesting with hints of fresh coffee up front on top of roasted caramel malts. Taste matched the smell but with a little less coffee and a little more toasted quality with caramel malts and a hint of smoke and chocolate on top of some molasses in the background. Mouthfeel is fairly light on this and the finish was crisp but slightly bitter. This brew definitely improved as it warmed up and is a very drinkable bock."
"Pours a almost black in color with a good head that goes away to almost nothing very quickley. Smell of roasted malt and chocolate with a slight undertone of cherries?? Mouth-feel is good with a nice finish. Taste is of a roasted coffee flavor with a chocolate undertone. I liked this beer and if you like this style of beer Uff-Da is worth a try."
"D- Not bad at all. Easy to drink."
"Smells sweet, with cherries, a little chocolate and a bit of toasted malt. Tastes similar, and, like the bottle says, ""the warmer Bock is, the sweeter it gets."" However, though the label assures me that I ""can expect...deep chocolate and coffee undertones," I detect little; a porter or stout Uff-da is not. With just a hint of bitterness at the end, this is definitely an unbalanced beer, but does have a tasty toasted malt flavor."
"Bottom line: This is quite the tasty Bock. The only ""bad"" thing I can really say about it is that I couldn't drink more than 1 at a sitting.(see my comment about it being filling)"
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slight yeasty, banannas, wheat, and caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, slight yeasty, nice touch of banannas/wheat/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a joy to drink in my book, very tasty, smooth, and delicious. Recommended."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. I can't believe that this is 7.30% ABV. This could be a dangerous brew, I can see how easy it would be to polish off 4 or 5 in a sitting, and not feel them until you stand up. I haven't had many bocks yet, but this has been my favorite thus far. Very tasty."
"Once again, lovely simple bottle art from New Glarus. Pours a deep dark mahogany brown with a proper fluffy two finger head atop. Smells nutty, with plenty of caramel. That's about it that I'm picking up. Taste is heavy on the malts, with caramel and toasted bread upfront, backed up with coating grape juice, finishing with a tad of smoke and faint chocolate. Hops are just right for the style, appropriately a background note. A touch of cola creeps in, which is kind of antithetical to the apparently light carbonation. Mouthfeel's a little creamy and could use a bit more effervescence. Overall, a fairly solid bock in spite of the lingering cola flavor. Thanks robbyc1 for this one."
"drinkability is good. this is a manageable bock, with a notable portion of roasted malt and a solid profile. a bit more body and this one would be great. cheers!"
"D- i like it, its a good standby beer"
"Just when you thought that the Bock style was fading into mediocrity, out comes this full flavors, bold, younger brother to the beloved Dopplebock. A lot of the same characteristics shine in this beer that I am accustomed to seeing in a Dopple: a firm, hearty malt bill, with rich breadiness, savory caramelization, and an unwaivering mouthfeel. Lower on esters than Dopples, but strong on the barley malt flavors. Mild alcohols make it easy on the head and the stomach. Finishes with a rich, rounded, attenuated malt flavor. No astringency or graininess to be found. Certainly among the best of the bocks. Thanks Nathan."
"D: Moderate abv and strong flavor profile, there isn't much more that I need."
"Continuing through the sampler, Uff-da is another good beer from New Glarus. A nice mix of malty flavors, good for sipping on a cool spring evening."
"A very tasty and aromatic beer, and if you can get past or prefer the super-low carbonation level."
"D-I won't buy it again for awhile, but I had a good time."
"Pours a deep, clear, mahogany color with fiery edges. A tan head slips quickly but leaves nice lacing. The aroma brings dark, but not heavy, fruits cherries and prunes. Toffee and roasted chocolate malts balance out a very nice bock nose. The taste is dark fruits and tea lightly creamed, roasted chocolate and light coffee bitterness. Medium-full and creamy mouthfeel. This is a very nice bock; it's tasty but not too heavy, and the alcohol is dastardly deceptive. New Glarus has another winner in this one."
"Poured from 12oz bottle my friend chris brought back from his trip to Madison( along with several others). Poured into delirium Tremens snifter a dark mahogany color with a kakia colored thick head. Smells a sweet malt mixed with chocolate and dark fruit. Taste is chocolate and hints of coffee. Mouthfeel is smooth and feels lighter than the color would suggest. This is a easy drinking bock with the alcohol not present for being 7.3% but the flavors are well balanced making it a dangerous session bock."
"This is the 5-6th time I've had this one, and I maintain, bocks normally aren't my thing, but Uff-da is pretty good for my understanding of the style.. Probably better than most Stateside bocks I've enjoyed."
"Very drinkable, I enjoyed this."
"Pours a deep amber/ mohogany color with a tan head. In the aroma, sweet cocoa and coffee. In the taste, a sweet roasty lager malt. A small bitter mouthfeel and a dry to sweet roasty lager aftertaste. Light in the body, yet decently big. Nice roastiness, yet lager notes."
"This brew has a deep brown coffee color with almost no head. The smell is of caramel and coffee with mild floral undertones. My first sip was lighter than I expected and I did not get as strong of a roasted malt flavor as I have come to know with bocks. This was more complex with less over the top taste. There was almost a floral after taste that was noticed in the smell of the beer. After a few more drinks the complexity came through with the more traditional caramel and chocolate flavors carrying weight, but in softer tones. This is a great beer to be enjoyed slowly and not just swallowed bottle for bottle. Real Nice!"
"D: Not a bad offering at all, a bit better than the Sam offering in my opinion and a solid offering from the brewers at New Glarus."
"Don't miss this one, it's good!"
"This is a very good beer for being from the bottom of the barrel. But with the levity out of the way this does present a quite acceptable brewing and drinking effort. I think this is getting better as it warms."
"this beer is rich with a thick malty backbone, deep malty and a little thick, the raisin is very faint, smooth clean slightly herbal after taste."
"In the mouth... It's got a strong raisin background flavor going on... In the nose... Maybe you smell a bit more caramel than you get in the mouth, but it's rich and sweet and malty to be sure. Good stuff."
"I usually enjoy New Glarus products very much, but this was a let down. I am hopping that it was a less then stellar batch."
"The mouthfeel could be a little heavier, as I feel this is just a tad on the thin side. Aftertaste is sweet, with some drying qualities. Another solid brew from New Glarus. Thanks again, Ed."
"Pours a deep, dark, brown color with a one finger head. Activity dies down quit quickly. The smell is of chocolat and roasted malt that changes to caramel when it warms. It has a bit of a bittersweet chocolat/toffee taste with slightly roasted maltiness. Very nice set of balanced flavors. It is medium body and is not very well carbonated. Seems to be a pattern with New Glarus. A good beer on a cool evening. My favorite of New Glarus beers I have sampled."
"D - This is a very good bock. My fifth New Glarus product and I've loved them all."
"Gift from my brother who visted Door County... First of all, I just love the straight up Norwegian-ness of this bottle. I come from a long line of 'Wegians and my Grandma always used to spout out the ""uff-da's""! Dark brown, ""burnt sienna"" color with a slippery tan head; not much lacing at all... Lightly roasted caramelly malt with hints of chocolate and toffee. No hop profile in the nose to speak of... Tastes wonderful; malty goodness spreads throughout the mouth and lingers until the slightest hint of herby, Noble hop character helps to balance and release the palate. I would never have guessed at the abv over 7% Very good example of the style and enjoyable to sip on a brisk night."
" ~ This is a good Bock. I tried my first Uff-Da about a year ago and have enjoyed each one ever since."
"D- Drinkability is igh with this brew if you like thicker beers. This one is thick enough that you would expect bitterness, but its incredibl sweet and only gets sweeter as it warms. My only qualm is that it is so sweet that after a couple I get out-sugered and its not so pleasant. Still, very nice."
"the border) are truely blessed. Makes a great beer float as well!"
"D: Great for its weight."
"drinkability is good. really nice served around 48F as the bottle suggests, but even better as it warms. well balanced and quite enjoyable. only real flaw was the carbonation, but even that subsided a bit as i let it sit and swirled it a little."
"overall i really enjoyed this, very drinkable"
"Low carbonation, nice creaminess, and while I may not want to drink more than a couple of these, one serving of this was just not enough. Well done."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a low to medium carbonation."
"D - A good bock that is enjoyable to drink to say the least."
"Pours an extremely dark brown with little bits of light coming through. Light tan head of two fingers takes a while to die down to a thin lacing. Pretty good stickiness on this one. Light caramel malt notes in the nose blended with some brown sugar. Very light and crisp smells, not overpowering, but still very noticable. Starts off with a very roasted nut flavor which is followed by taste much like caramel corn, yummy. Finishes with a nice wheat bread flavor, very unique tastes on the tongue for this brew. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Very easy to put this one down, probably one of the best bocks i've had to date. Amazing representation of this style. I really enjoy the beers New Glarus puts out, can't wait to try even more."
"A nice bock, no complaints."
"This was one of the few New Glarus offerings I had yet to try, and they rarely disappoint. Looks a dark red, smells a bit of roasted malts. The flavor follows the smell, a lot of roasted malt, more than I expected in a bock, and yet stays pretty light. Had no idea it was 7+ abv until I read so on this site, quite a surprise, it's hidden very well. Very drinkable, very tasty, nice work again New Glarus."
"Like a good bock, Uff-da showcases the wide flavor potential of malts; its most surprising attribute is that it does it in an a highly quaffable way. This is a solid bock worth searching out if you're in Wisconsin."
"Taste follows nose closely. Again not rich, but detectable. Carbonation livens things up a bit, but I'm glad to see it subtle. I""m not a bock fan, yet this one I can drink without making faces."
"Drinks very easy for the abv, but just needs a little more guts"
"Thanks to my bro mnwags for the hookup."
"Interesting brew."
"Really enjoyed this one. One of the better Bocks I've tried."
"This bock pours nearly black, with ruby highlights when held to the light. A thin off-white head formed, diminished to a lasting skim with nice lacing. The beer is a little cloudy, definitely some yeast chunks suspended in the brew. A very inviting nose to this beer, there is a moderate-high chocolate aroma, a low roasted character, and also some caramel sweetness. As expected no hop aroma. The taste of the beer has an initial moderate sweetness, more bittersweet, caramel and raisin-like. The taste quickly turns to moderate chocolate flavor with some low roasted tones. The hop bitterness is medium-low, but provides a nice balance, no hop flavor. The finish is nice as well, leaves a little chocolate on the tongue long after the swallow. The carbonation is moderate, mouthfeel is very creamy, and the beer exhibits a very full body. Overall this beer was impressive, it might be my favorite New Glarus, although favorite beer so often depends on the mood. The appearance, aroma, and taste were all top notch, as was the creamy mouthfeel. The only knock is I couldnt drink a bunch of these, very full bodied and rather filling, but then again a bock like this should be enjoyed slowly!"
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Adnams Tulip pint glass. Appears a translucent dark brown color with about a finger of light tan foam that leaves minimal lacing on the inside of the glass. Smell is similar to a cocoa dusted cherry followed by sweet malt and alcohol. Tastes of semi-sweet chocolate, mild coffee, and molasses. A notch above medium in both body and carbonation. Smooth drinking with a finish that is both sweet and slightly sour. Recommended."
"Mouth feel was smooth and fairly creamy."
"T&M: Good, complex and smooth with deep chocolate and coffee undertones."
"D- This beer has a very nice complexity and although in my description it sounds very sweet it is really a very subtle sweetness. There is no pot caramel flavor that seems to dominate most bad bock and this one really caught me by surprise."
"This tends to be a beer style I rather enjoy, it's not tops in the class but it is certainly drinkable. There weren't any off putting flavors or undertones and I really enjoyed the the nice roasted malt flavor. The carbonation is not an issue with this beer and seemed fitting to the style.The flavor improved nicely as it warmed."
"Received in a mixed sixpack trade from power-trader extraordinaire, nflmvp -- many thanks for the opportunity. Poured into a Stange glass, New Glarus's stab at a Bock is a deep, dusky russett color with a modest but dense tan head which leaves substantial bands of lacing after each draught. Mellow aromas of plum juice, dark dried cherries, and brown sugar along with some earthy and spicy hops. A cherry and caramel sweetness is the most recognizable aspect of this malty brew. Some vague whisperings of leafy and spicy hops come through, but are rather less than noticeable. Thick, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel, but never sticky or cloying. Miniscule alcohol bite at the finish, which is off-dry and more or less clean. I'm not exactly an afficionado of the style, but this seems about right for a Bock. I don't normally seek these beers out, but if I were in Wisconsin on a cold evening, I just might reach for an Uff-Da. Fair enough?"
"The last bottle from a six-pack I bought from the source in Oct '06. Poured into my New Glarus pint glass a dark brown, almost black espresso color with a thick head that disappears after a few minutes. Swirling will bring back a thin, cappuccino looking head, with minumal lace. The smell is of dark roasted barley, coffee with noticable alcohol. The taste reveals that there were definitely dark roasted barley used in the making of this brew. The brewery actually has barley at different stages of roasting available to taste during the tour they offer. I remember tasting the darker barley from this tour when I take a sip of this beer. The alcohol is noticable, at least to my palate, with some malt and hops to balance it all out. The mouthfeel is creamy, with moderate carbonation. This could be a short session beer for me, as I continue drinking it, the alcohol takes effect and makes me wish for another. I would probably buy another six the next time I'm in Wisconsin."
"Pours a deep clay and cola color. A little cloudy, but you can seem some cool lager carbonation. soft whipped egg whites head with meager retention. The aroma is still dark fruity mlats with some added coffee and a pronounced roast as well. The taste maintains that intrigueing roasted coffee mixed with plums and other dark fruits. An intertesting take on a traditional German lager. Pretty easy to drink, but would be a little hard to have more than one in a day."
"D - This beer tastes fantastic, and feels good going down."
"Drinkability: I have had several of these in the past and thankfully have a few more left. Why, oh, why can't New Glarus distribute outside of Wisconsin? Damn the three tier system."
"Uff-Da is a wonderful version of a style that I sometimes find difficult to enjoy. As is so often the case, making a hoppy style more hoppy and making a malty style more malty (as New Glarus has done here) is the key to a successful beer. This one might be well-known for its name, but it deserves to be well-known for its quality and its deliciousness."
"Dark maple syrup brown body with a small, light khaki head. Meaty, maple syrup aroma with notes of butter rum and dark fruit. Taste is similar. Sweet malts, cookie dough, and a constant vegetal flavor. Finish is slightly tangy bitter. Not bad, but not overly complex. Medium body with gentle carbonation and a silky feel."
"Bock? This beer may be good, but its definitely pushing the boundaries of the bock definition. Pours almost black with a reasonably dense, slightly rocky tan head. Smells of chocolate and a hint of orange peel. Like one of those candies you get at Christmas. Tastes of chocolate, overroasted coffee beans, and finishes like you've just eaten a spoonful of cocoa powder. Mouthfeel is suprisingly thin for a beer with so much flavor. Doesn't satisfy the way many of its breatheren do. Drinkability is limited by that dry finish that makes you want a drink of something liquid as a chaser. An interesting brew, maybe worth a taste but not anything I will lament not being imported into my (admitedly Draconian/Machiavellian) state."
"Something's a little different about this bock. Made with an ale yeast maybe? It's tasty, it just seems to be missing a lager yeast character. Tastes like a nice big brown. Lots of chocolate malt, but I found the aroma and taste a little muted. Not a bad beer, give it a try."
"I have sampled this beer exclusively as pourn from a 12 oz bottle. It exhibits a rich mahogany color with a decent head which leaves a bit of lacing along the edges. The deep color of this beer belies its equally deep flavor. The beer is extraordinarily rich and a bit malty. Its flavor is only enhanced by its complex, almost burnt smell. As indicated on its wrapper, this beer truly is best enjoyed a bit warm (around 50 degrees or so), as this only makes it sweeter and more mellow. If this beer does have a flaw, it is in its mouthfeel. For such a rich smelling and tasting beer, it seems a bit light on the tongue. On the other hand, this 'lightness' does contribute to it being a very drinkable brew."
" As is common to the style the taste leaned toward the sweet side. Hops were there in the background. This was nicely done and a pleasant change of pace. I seem to have forgotten how much I enjoy the Bock styles. New Glarus, thank you for this wonderful reminder."
"Originally reviewed on November 10, 2005. 12 Oz Bottle. A crystal clear ruddy brown pour, with ruby fringes and an opulent thin coarse tea-stained head. Aroma of caramel, light toast, a touch of kringle, some walnuts and a dash of worcestshire. Rich toasted malty goodness, heavy doses of warm roasted nuts, hazlenuts and macadamias. A freshly baked portugese loaf fresh from the wood-fired oven. Rolling oats and wheat tones, with a lucious wave of brown sugar and a hint of molasses. Tart euro hops dry this brew a bit. Finish is sweet and clinging, with aftertones of frangelico and kahlua. Not burgeoning, not dazzling; a solid middle player. On par for the style for sure."
"D - a tasty drink in many ways. Bock? not sure of that classification based on what I'm used to. Throw that out and I'm drinking a couple and enjoying!"
"This beer pours a semi-opaque dark brown color. The head is one inch in height and recedes quickly into this lacing. The aroma is of sweet roasted malt and very straight forward. The taste is like the aroma. It isn't bad but lacks any sort of complexity. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation and a silky smoothness. Overall, I can tell that this beer is made well, but it lacks the depth I like to see in a beer,"
"Drinkability is decent for ABV. It's a bit too foamy and simple to be very exciting. I don't find this combination of flavors as something I'd seek out."
"A pretty enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: despite the variance from the style, I liked it. It went down well, and I'm glad I have a few more."
"Very dunkel-colored. This beer had no head. Dark coloring, slight raosted chocolate makes me think more of a brown ale than a dunkel. Not much of a smell going. The munich malts become more evident as it warms up. It's tasty and drinkable. Great name."
"I think it is becoming obvious that i need to move eastward."
"I have read other reviews of this beer and none of them describe my experience so maybe I got a glass from a bad barrel or something."
"All-in-all it's a solid beer. Somewhat light for a bock, but the maltiness is good while you have it. I suspect that if this weren't so light, it would cross from a bock into a pretty solid porter. It needs more of a nose though, and needs to assert itself more. The label calls itself ""big"" but it's really sort of just ""medium sized."""
"Opinion: This is a pretty tasty beer. I wouldn't really classify it as a bock as it has too much chocolate and the malt character is a bit off. Don't get me wrong, this isn't as out of the Bock style as Shiner and the likes are here in Texas, but it is still pretty far from what you would expect in Bavaria. Regardless this is a tasty beer with plenty of flavor to soak up and the balance doesn't make it annoying in any way. I would drink this beer again."
"Slainte!"
"What a full-flavored, fruity bock! It's very good. Pitch black, no head to speak of, smels fruity and roasted. The taste is dark, dried fruit--raisin, prune, date, fig along with a roasted grain and chocolate malt. Very nice, full mouthfeel. I like this a lot. I'd love to kick these back on a cool fall evening."
"This is a very drinkable and tasty brew. Not the richest or most decadent bock I've had, or the most refined. But this is a tasty and well balanced treat. This would make a great session brew in the upcoming cooler weather, or also be good crossover fare for someone interested in exploring what can be done with dark malts. Ill be enjoying this beer again sometime."
"Thanks to Bashiba for sharing this brew."
"D- Easy for a bock, I will probably have another not something I would hunt down but if I ran across it I would defenatly grab a 6pack."
"Into a pint glass, pours a dark ruby, not much head, not much lacing, not much going on. Aroma is decent for a bock, chocolate and earthy, almost smells a little like dirt, some caramel maltiness underneath. Mouth is decent. Taste is nicely malty, slightly fruity, nutty, and overall a pretty decent bock, though not my favorite bock ever, i'd have it again, and probably will."
"Packs a lot of complexity into an incredibly smooth flavor. Kudos to New Glarus."
"Pours dark brown to black with ruby red hues, a cgood size creamy tan head. Aroma is nice with some rich smoky tobacco, some bourbony alcohol, roasted malts and a little chocolatey malt. Taste is kind of like a cola and coffe mix with some sweet sugary malts mixing with a roasted malt finish. A little milky tang in the finish from the roastiness. Alcohol was only evident in the aroma, but is hidden in the taste. No real bitterness to speak of, quite sweet and roasty. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body, creamy with a little spice in the finish."
"A sipper, but could easily enjoy a few of these on a winter evening...either way, I am real happy with this one."
"The biggest thing this beer lacks is the malty aroma of a bock; it starts the whole drinking experience on a down note. Color is an exellent, dark caramel. Hops are almost complete missing from flavor, even more subdued than what it should be. It has a nice, creamy mouthfeel which also makes it very drinkable. For a bock with a 7.3% ABV, it drinks almost like a session beer. Better than Leinie's Big Butt, but not by much."
"For a 7.3% abv this one is pretty drinkable."
"Props to badbeer for the bottle."
"Good beer. Some would find it too rich but I've been permanently damaged by imperial stouts so its ok with me. The Brussels Lace held strong from beginning to end. The glass is toast, I'll need another for my next beer. I've been sitting here for a few minutes and all I can taste is raisins. Enjoyable beer for sure."
"Solid bock baby. Made for session drinking, perfect for savoring. Another reason why New Glarus kicks so much tail."
"D: This is a nice bock - nothing special, but it is easy and pleasing to drink."
"I was lucky enough to get a six pack or maybe it was a four pack of this wonderful beer from my wife's cousin in Wisconsin. I poured the beer into my trustly Duvel tulip glass. What a great deep brown color this bock poured with a nice tan head that disapated rather quickly. The aroma is is of toasted malts, a bit of sweetness. The taste is a nice bouquet of chocolate and toasted malt. What an enjoyable taste and with a medium body, this is a very drinkable beer. Another winner from New Glarus."
"Dangerously drinkable for 7.30% ABV. I think this beer is the high end of the ""Bock"" Category and is really close to a nice dopplebock."
"Aroma holds brown sugar, raisin, bread pudding, pumpernickel and spice. Deep garnet color. Pinky thin tan head that is both creamy and bubbly. Mmmm nice fore...lots of dark roasty pumpernickel/raisin notes. Sweet malt, brown sugar molasses notes toward the back. The flavor is a bit watery and tinny at first, but I personally started too cold..it goes away as it warms. Chocolate notes pop out as it warms. Aftertaste is damn tasty like dark fruit sweetened pumpernickel. Damn fine brew."
"However ""big"" this bock is, it can pack punch. Great offering from New Glarus."
"from the bottle as soon as I popped the cap got a big wiff of sweetness like brown sugar and a strong alcohol. poured mahogany with a light tan head that left some lacing. aroma the sweetness and alcohol went away out came a sour cherry smell, than chocolate, malts, and spices. flavor a lot better than tha aroma, creamy chocolate dark fruits, molasses, with a nice touch of coffee and a slight bitterness in the finish. that flavor brought the rating up on this beergood beer"
"Pours a nice finger width head with a fairly strong lacing. Smells fairly sweet with a strong coffee flavor and smell of fresh barley like you would smell if you were in the New Glarus Brewery. A very dark beer with a slight dark amber color when held up to the light. Taste is like coffee with a mouthfeel that is fizzy and smooth. It's a slightly sweet beer such as you would expect from a bock bier."
"Beer pours a very deep brown, almost black with a slowly dissipating head with good lacing. The aromas of this beer are of coffee, chocolate, and a hint of caramel. Upfront taste is of caramel, chocolate, and toffee, finishing with a coffee taste. Beer is medium bodied. One or two of these and this beer is very drinkable, but after that it becomes a bit cloying. Still a nice beer to enjoy, tastes better as it warms a bit."
"12 ounce bottle. New Glarus Uff-da Bock pours out a dark brown color with a dense head. The aroma is vanilla, nuts, and whiffs of alcohol. The flavor is malty and nutty, with a little bit of fruitiness. Some chocolate flavor too. Tastes good at first, but the finish is very metallic and tastes a little like blood. Medium mouthfeel. Drinkability is not especially good. One of these is plenty for me. New Glarus makes several very good beers and several mediocre beers. This is one of the latter."
"Very nice. This one could get you into trouble."
"solid unheralded new glarus brew"
"Light on the tongue, could use a bit more body. Finish with a slightly sour aftertaste but still very drinkable."
"Cellaring Update: I cellared a couple of Uff-das for 6 months, 1 year, and 18 months. They cellared well and in fact I would say that I enjoyed them most after 18 months. The Uff-da had better developed dark fruit flavors and a richer body. I'm upping the score a touch."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, even a little silky and there is a solid chocolate-carmel flavor with sweetness that lingers. Drinkability was good, but again this one won't knock your socks off like other offerings to appease the ""winter"" gods (their label verbage). Worth a try if you can find it (only sold in Wisconsin). Nice, but not memorable."
"Beer 3 of a six pack purchased at the brewery."
"Purchased 12 ounce bottle at Flanagan's in Appleton, WI. Deep brown/reddish color, mahogany. Small and tight off white head that exudes creaminess. Caramel nose, no hop detected. Sweet malty caramel flavor, still no hop to help balance it, I know it is a bock. Complex and buttery in the mouthfeel with a caramel and toasted flavor. May have gained some sweetness with age but still a nice beer."
"The beer has nice low levels of carbonation. The mouth is a wee bit thin. Easy enough drinker. Would be better if they could dial down the alcohol taste a bit. Still an enjoyable beer from the folks in New Glarus."
"this beer has a rich, mahogany color as suggested on the label. such a deep, vivid color with some bubbles and a thin ring of tan bubbles.. looks very appetizing. smells malty.. hints of brown sugar and maple sweat from the scent, some caramel as well. tasting this beer is a wicked smooth experience.. especially for one that exceeds 7%. slightly roasty but mostly smooth and buttery sweet like vanilla frosting. nutty with a slight tang from a light hopping.. sorry, but i just don't get chocolate out of this. maybe a bit of leather, some cedar even.. nothing too bitter at all as the malt sweetness is dominant. man is this a drinkable beer.. cool as all hell and quaffable. wish i had more of this one. one of the best new glarus beers ive had so far."
"An attractive reddish-maple color, very little head, but pretty good lacing. Smells sweet, with cherries, a little chocolate and a bit of toasted malt. Tastes similar, and, like the bottle says, ""the warmer Bock is, the sweeter it gets."" However, though the label assures me that I ""can expect...deep chocolate and coffee undertones," I detect little; a porter or stout Uff-da is not. With just a hint of bitterness at the end, this is definitely an unbalanced beer, but does have a tasty toasted malt flavor. Nice thick mouthfeel. Pretty easy-drinkin'."
"Bottle provided by Orbitalr0x, thanks for the opportunity. Pours a half finger tan head of tiny bubbles over a crystal clear dark caramel-rust liquid. Smells caramel and sour citrus grainy. Toffee and chocolate with searching. Taste is dominated by a sour malty. Not quite cherry-like and not really pleasing. Under the sour is caramel and rounded chalky munich malt flavor. The aftertaste is a rich sweet toffee and cocoa/chocolate. Md-light body with a smooth feel. Moderately carbonated, but the carb sting on my tongue augments the sour."
"Drinkability is pretty low on this one. I can finish it, but definitly won't be searching this one out again."
"Wow! What an interesting and superbly drinkable beer! It's not what I'd think of as a bock, and its cherry character is somewhat different (as in it's confusing withing the style... but still interesting and somewhat complex), and I like it! It's almost like a toned-down doppelbock that turned into a caramelish-toasty-nutty-cherry liquid candy bar! Impressive!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and has a good body to it. Rich and velvety...it coats the mouth. Overall this is a nice bock that I wouldn't mind having again."
"Afterthoughts: The Uff-da bock is just another example of how great New Glarus really is. If you happen to find this beer on tap do yourself a favor and order it immediately because the flavors multiply ten-fold."
"Clear bubbly cola color with a very small tan layer of head, probably due to the higher ABV. Smell is very sweet with creamy caramel and roasted malts. Taste is very large and somewhat different. Woody and sweet tones are present, alcohol is percepatable. Comes off as slightly harsh at first, but is a good beer once you get into it. Mouthfeel is pretty watery for the style. A pretty good Bock."
"No dating. Chestnut, cloudy, no head really -just a teensy creamy khaki dusting and ring of small bubbles. Not much aroma at all, really cant get anything. Bit of malt maybe, just amazingly clean scented. Mouthfeel is strange, it feels very light, yet full at the same time. Very dry, you do not taste much, just malty. Reminds me of a brown. The whole thing is just so clean, it is not really there. Good drinkability, could down a bunch in a sitting since it is not heavy, but I would probably head towards a bit more intensity of flavor."
"This beer is a dark brown color with splashes of crimson. Thin dark beige head and a thin wall of lacing. The aroma is roasty and malty along with some caramel. Medium-bodied and smooth with a pleasant blend of flavors such as roasted malt, nuts, caramel and dark cherry. The finish is long and sweet with chocolate and a slight hoppiness. Enjoyable Bock from New Glarus."
"The appearance is a deep reddish brown and very clear. There is a small, creamy, tan head when poured vigorously. It makes for a very attractive beer. The smell is all malt. Very rich. A mixture of brown sugar and dark semi-sweet chocolate. Tastes like burnt caramel, whole grain bread, with a dark chocolate bitterness in the finish. Very little hops to balance the malt, but that isn't missing. A good, substantial mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"This beer pours a very beautiful brown color with brilliant ruby accents. An active carbonation keeps a very small head sitting over top of the beer. The nose is sweet and nutty, lacking a big lager character. I think I may like this one. I get a flavor consisting of caramel and slightly roasted malt, a bit nutty. Not a bad flavor at all. The feel is right at moderate, not too thick or too thin. As far as a bock beer goes, this is not a bad choice at all. New Glarus has been a very dependable selection so far."
"It's just a drinkable brew. It's an excellent winter beer, and being from wisconsin, I like to have this beer with some bread, and yes, (insert laugh), some cheese as well."
"This bock poured a nice reddish brown out of the bottle and was a beautiful ruby color in the light. Decent whitish head without too much lacing. The initial aroma I get is a cidery ester, but it went away quickly replaced by a chocolatey malt aroma. The flavor is excellent, clean malty flavor starting with chocolate and coffee and moving to a distinct nuttiness as it warms up, reminding me of pistachios. Nice body and the carbonation seems to linger even as the beer warms up. You can't even really notice the alcohol with this, I would have guessed around 6%. This is a great example of the style."
"Started off interesting, but turned out to be a disappointment."
"This poured with a huge head that quickly subsided. It settled into a really deep brown color that the brewers describe on the label as ""mahogany."" Fair enough and I'm not going to argue that point. It had a very malty nose with an underlying hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel was okay, but a light alcohol bite presented itself at the finish."
"I stumbled upon this small brewery in New Glarus WI while my wife and I were on one of our weekend camping trips. I picked up a 6 pack of there assorted brews that afternoon before heading back to the campsite. The fat squirrel was the first one I tried. Its red mahogany color looks like a cross between a red and a brown ale. It poured with almost no head though. It teneded to smell of fruit and chocalate but does not have a fruity taste. Overall it is a good beer that I will purchase more of when I am in Wisconsin. This small brewery brews good beers."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the reddish brown brew. Head was somewhat fleeting, and lacing was okay. Aroma is light, but obviously malt is the dominant force here. Taste is storngly of caramel malts, with a slight fruity sweetness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are reasonably good, but a bit strong for a regular bock, and as such, it's sessionability is somewhat lower."
"An OOoo-Raaah Uff-Da (whatever the f*k that means) to BigHuge for the chance to sample this strangely nice but weird brew!"
"a big thanks to to zap for parting with some of his precious bock beer...uff-da...thanks buddy!"
"A nice, easy-going, quite agreeable little bock. I could down a few without complaint, ya sure, you betcha..."
"The nice deep brown color, the sweet nose, and the sugary first sip reminds me of a cola. I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing in the case of this brew. It is a fantastic taste-quencher on a nice hot spring day like today. The head was a light caramel color, but imediately disappeared. As I got towards the middle of the beer, I noticed that it was lacking a little of the beer taste, but nonetheless, a wonderful creation from New Glarus. As far as the abv goes, at 7.3%, this is one beer that could get away from you without ever seeing it coming."
"Thanks to CRJM for this one."
"(3-31-02)Reddish brown in color..creamy head that retains itself in a very small way throughout. This is a great one on the nose..chocolate and caramel aroma...Taste mimicks the aroma. Perhaps this beers top characteristic is its mouthfeel. It just feels like a good bock should feel like going down...It seems as more and more breweries add ""bocks"" to their lineup, more and more are tasting very watered down..Not this one. This a regular bock with character. For a regular ol bock this one doesn't have many peers in my opinion."
"Drinkability is solid but relative blandness (that's kind of harsh, it's a solid beer !) doesn't make me want to seek another."
"Despite my critcisms this is an easy drinking brew. I could have a few and be real happy. I'd really like to get my hands on some more beers by New Glarus."
"A really nice bock, its a shame more brewers don't try the style. Clear garnet with a fair head that rapidly dissipates, no surprise due to the good ABV. Taste is caramel sweetness and chocolate, with a balancing hop bite. Mouthfeel is spot on without encroaching into Doppel territory."
"661"
"""Uff-da"" indeed! This is the first big bock that was worthy of the name. There's a slightly hazy beer-bottle-brown body under a transient ochre head. Funny, I can't taste anything that says coffee, but instead a fruity alelike nose and tastes of raisins, rum and maple syrup. Also a warming alcohol presence and a slighty winey finish. Maybe the difference is that my bottle had been cellared a few years, but this tastes more like a microbrewed porter or a young barleywine. So try holding on to this for a while, and see if it doesn't do the same for you!"
"Clear dark reddish brown with a marginal 1/8 inch head that's off white in shade. Laces in rings. Aroma is lighlty malty, slighlty papery and not straying from caramel. Nice mouthfeel, full with moderate carbonation, the beer's best feature. The flavor is subdued though, light brown sugar and little else other than a slight peach brandy mid mouth. Hops are average but balance the malts well. This is easy drinking, doesn't seem 7% ABV and well crafted, but like many ordinary Bocks, the mouthfeel takes the day over flavor."
"Not ponderous...emminently drinkable."
"Pours with a light tan, three-finger head that goes quickly and leaves some lace. Clear amber color, starts malty, finishes smooth and malty. Nose is sweet and malty. good carbonation. Light to medium bodied. You don't notice the high ABV. This is a very good bock."
"Finish is pretty crisp. Not a bad brew, but it's nothing to get too excited about. Washed down my pizza pretty well last night."
"This poured out wonderfully with a growing tall head of very tight frothyness of light tannish color sitting atop a glowing deep mahagony, rubyish copper highlighted gem of a bottom. Head did fade pretty fast though to a skim always present and a fairly thick ring. Smell is faint malts and light roastyness, no tang or sweetness to be found, will that carry over to the taste? Yep, kinda, its a whole lotta empty malts that renders some roastyness and seems to be quite solid and smooth but no other characteristics can be found. Hops are there in very small amount lending a bit of a grab with some roasted grains and thank goodness for that, other wise I might fall asleep drinkin this bock. Has no real finishing qualities either. Kinda bland and one dimensional. Feel is medium bodied smoothness with a small pickup near the middle. Its a decent drinkable tastin bock, a bit lack luster but do-able over many others of this style."
"Clear ruby in color with a tan head. The aroma is malty, bready, and somewhat grainy with a touch of roastiness. The flavor is toasty and malty. This is a medium bodied brew that is pretty smooth and easy drinking. Not as full as I hoped, but still a decent offering."
"Cheers"
"F."
"Brown color, thin white head,sweet and fruity aroma , very malty with a strange tasting sweetness, not bad for an American bock, not great for a bock either, I am aging a bottle for awhile to see if it gets better."
"The bottle says deep mahogany color, and they are not kidding.  Very, very little head that dissipates into a thin foam skim.  Deep, earthy aroma.  Lots of carbonation for a dark bock beer.  Rich malt flavor, with a pleasant burnt malt aftertaste.  Decent, drinkable bock beer.  I think this Wisconsin dark beer would go great with some very sharp cheddar cheese."
"I had to adjust my ratings because they were way too low. This beer is one of the best bocks around. Regal mahogany. Crystal clear. Rich, decadent malt tones. Very smooth and flavorful. Medium-full body and very easy to drink. Great session bock. More detailed notes to follow soon."
"(p.s.  Wish they didn't call it Uff-Da.  Being a non-native (well I have lived here since I was a little one) Wisconsinite, I try to shake the sterotypical Norweigan stuff...a step backwards in that regard.  The ever-present cat calls of ""Uff-Da...Ya, hey, der!"" seem to accompany this beer.  Makes me cringe"
"I first had this beer about 8 or so years ago, it was truly one of the best beers I had ever had.  The recipe or quality of ingredients has changed since then, because the last few years it has not been the same.  Nonetheless, this is still a good beer.  Aroma is malty with a slight roasted character.  Color is brown with a ""mahogany hue"" along with good clarity.  Head is medium and thins farily quickly.  The high level of carbonation is quite noticeable.  A  smooth malt drink with a pleasant malt aftertaste.  Has some stout-like qualities in the flavor with the malt richness, but not excessive."
