"No doubt the best beer produced in Mexico (with Negra Modelo being second with a bit of distance between the two). Wish it was available all year round but then it wouldn't be this special. A must try during the holidays!"
""
"I am NOT saying it's the best beer I ever had, simply that they pack a lot of fullness and flavor in a beautifully wrapped little bottle, and in a perfect balance for me. Merry Christmas!"
"Bottle poured into a pint glass from a local brewery in Cabo San Lucas. I recall drinking this beer before my craft days, thinking that it was some sort of dark god. How times have changed. This reddish brown concoction may stand out a bit in a landscape of yellow fizzy beach brews but is an average bock at best, below average truth be told. Does show some light tan head but with a curiously fizzy thin body and an aroma that is strangely alcohol-forward, boozy and medicinal rather than richly sweet and fruity, although I do get a whiff of cherry cough syrup. The flavor is devoid of clear roasted or chocolate elements. There are some cherry, sultana raisin, and peach notes poking out here and there along with a brown sugar backbone that somehow manages to underperform compared to a brew like Negra Modelo. I am having to pay too much attention to taste the fruit notes and I'm simply not getting the big dark molasses flavor others are claiming. Like a Mexican Shiner Bock. Finish is on the grainy and medicinal side. Its not awful but I think I'll refrain from buying a 12-pack next time."

"Taste is nice, sweet toffee, caremlised bread, hint of wine up front, drier toasty finish, light leafy-woody finish. It has a bit of a basic, mass-produced quality but it is very good, full-bodied in character and very enjoyable."

"The mouthfeel is quite spritzy and tastes like club soda. Dark amber color in the glass. The typical wet cardboard smell. From the bottle into a plastic cup at the neighborhood street celebration. At least I still have my memories."

"D- An ex left me this beer. It was better than I expected. Don't fear drinking this, but don't seek it out."
"I was very impressed with this beer, mostly because the store by my house sells it for $3.99 a six-pack."
""
"Not the best bock out there, but not bad for south of a south of the border bock."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavors of medium sweet malts, minerals, citrus, water. More malt than light Mexican beer have, certainly, but light compared to Christmas - Holiday beers, or as it says ""Estilo Bock."" All in all, compared to the big beers I drink I would call this a session brew with slight caramel malt body."
""
"Overall a pretty decent bock. A nice surprise."
"One last note --- this beer is brewed in one of my favorite cities, Monterrey, NL, Mexico."
"O - Mild, inoffensive, and unimpressive. Definitely not a good representation of the style. Adjunct/dextrin tastes spoil what may have had some potential."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent Bock beer, nothing special but relatively well made."
""
""
""
"This is an ok beer, but the overly sugary aftertaste detracts for me. Makes me think adjunct."

"Cheers!"

"A reasonably drinkable, flavorful bock beer. Nothing out of the ordinary but worth a try."
"Overall: I hate to make promises but this one is at minimum satisfying. Not great not bad, but compliments any meal regardless of style. Drink up fellas (and ladies), Salud!"

"O - This is one of the least offensive beers that I have had out of Mexico. It drinks easy and the taste is okay. I'd put it with Negro Modelo."
""
""
""
"overall this isn't bad, but nothing really stands out as being special. therefor it falls a bit short of being worth seeking out. glad i got my bottles for free."
""

"Pours out clear dark brown with red hues when held to the light. Head is nice, thick, and with decent retention. Not too much lacing on this one. The nose is grainy with a mix of citrus and floral hops and solid malt backbone. Extremely light on flavor. A little bit of grains and a little bit of metal. Hops are almost nonexistent and the malts have vanished. Mouth feel is watery at best with hints of carbonation. This beer went downhill fast. Never will I buy this again."
""
"O - This is a nice bock. Seems different than most German bocks and less sweet than American ones."
""
""
""
""

"The flavor is more of a disappointment, it shows is Mexicaness. It has a it of metal, herbal notes form the hops, some muddled sweetness, and overall not that great."
"D - very drinkable, nothing complex, but inoffensive and about what you would expect from a mexican industrial bock."
"Little head on this one and no real lacing on a light amber with slight golden hues hazy body. Aroma is mild. Subtlety spicy and earthy. Flavor is more of the same with brown sugar and caramel malt intermixed.this one is Little flat to me with light carbonation and light body. Overall very drinkable and exactly what you would expect from a bock made on Mexico and actually not a terrible beer though."
"12 ounce bottle poured into Efes tulip. 2011 vintage. Pour seems quite still. Zero lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel crossed with overripe banana. Mouthfeel is thin and taste is not offensive but really nothing exciting. Reminds me of a stale Yuengling more than a bock. Like a flat amber instead of a bock. Easy to drink, just not enjoyable."
"O - It's definitely a middle of the road, easy drinker. There is absolutely nothing about it that stands out as overly bad or good."
"O: Drinkable when icy cold, but really not a very good beer. It doesn't seem much different than Dos Equis Amber."
""
""

"O: sadly this is revered as one of the best coming from mexico. so be it."
""
"O: Decent, just barely good."
""
""

"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle with a pry-off crown, and a foil-wrapped neck, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
""
""
""
"T: slightly sweet malts, grainy with a lightly toasted taste. Medium carbonation with large bubbles. Honestly, not all that bad."
"D - Serve cold with lots of spicy Mex food!"
"Overall: Yet another bad beer that the mass populous love"
""
"I can't really say I'm a fan of this beer. It's not bad, but not something I plan on drinking again."
"Its a decent thickness with low carbonation, goes down smooth. Easily a sessioanble beer even though its 6% abv."
"O: Unfortunately the nose is the only thing with German influence in this one. Don't get me wrong, being born and raised in SD, I have a major weakness for Mexi-Beer and this one really just is a good Mexi-Beer, and not much more. Right up there, and maybe even nicer, than Victoria (another Mexican classic). I could drink these all night and with an ABV of 5.9% I might actually catch a buzz which isn't easy to do with most Mexi-Beers."
"Seems solid in everything other than smell and taste. I don't know what to make of that. The pour was awesome, but that certain metallic taste and smell seemed to keep it from being a great beer."

"Here's a sleeper from a Mexican brewing giant. It's a step up from Dos Equis Amber, but Noche Buena is only around during the winter season."
"For whatever reason, this is the first I've heard tell of this stuff, found it in a holiday variety 24-pack along with both types of Dos Equis. It is light bodied for the style, which is what you'd expect from a Mexican dark. It's very close to rival Negra Modelo; this is a little richer and roastier, the Negra Modelo a little lighter and finishes a bit cleaner. If you like Mexi-darks, you'll like this just fine. It, or an equivalent dark from this brewer, ought to be available year-round, I'm somewhat surprised they don't really have anything to counter the Modelo unless it's Christmas season. While we're at it, this brewer really needs to get the Bohemia in 12-packs. A very drinkable and pleasant Mexi-dark."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, 2011 edition. This pours a brownish color with a short lived white head. The smells are light, some malts, caramel and toffee. The feel is medium to light. Taste is similar to smell light toffee malts, a little bitterness and carbonation at the end."
""
"Overall, I wanted to rate this beer higher, but there's just not that ""outstanding"" thing in it I'm looking for, other than good memories of times spent in Mexico. So consider this a sentimental favourite. I do like the taste, and if I could find it here in six or twelve packs, I'd drink it a lot. Unfortunately I could only find single bottles."
""
"Thin and watery, though there's a vague amount of flavor here. Flaked oats, nutty malts, though unfortunately there's a metallic twang to the finish. Nothing sweet here that would suggest a bock, though there are some vague caramel flavors. Dry, papery aftertaste, clean finish. Simple and easy drinking. Nothing groundbreaking. Worth a try, though Indio is a far better beer from this brewery."
""
"Nose is clean though a bit thin. Touch of ruddy caramel, perhaps a bit of carob and a hint of roast. No real hop aroma but that's just as well given the light malt delivery. Taste is smooth and light, finishing with a lingering yet thin caramel. Roast appears briefly after the swallow along with a bit of spice. Overall certainly lighter in body than I anticipated but quite drinkable and with enough complexity to keep things interesting. Light caramel sweetness and spiciness on the finish with some hops emerging with warming."
""
"I found myself just waiting for this beerish drink to be over."
""
"Best thing I can say is that it worked fine as part of a marinade for chicken thighs..."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, appears brown-tinted amber with a light single finger of loose head that falls down to a loose rim of foamy scum in about two minutes, body is lighter and carbonation is quite lively on the tongue. Aroma has this grassy herbal feel that also contains hints of cinnamon and spice spread over the top of a lightly toasted caramel malt. Taste comes across as a lot of the things promised in the nose, but not quite as strong as I would have anticipated from the nose, with the main flavor emphasis up front on the spice even coming across as understated before the tongue delves into the malt bill. Compared to other Christmas beers I have had it is rather underspiced but compared to other Mexican beers it is amazing. Pretty good overall, just wish it were amplified somewhat and had more head to it."
"Finishing my night with this beer. How appropriate, no? It pours a clear sunrise garnet topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, light cocoa powder, graham crackers, and biscuits. The taste holds notes of caramel, light mandarin orange syrup, honey-dripped biscuits, and very light chocolate powder. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a mostly smooth feel, and a fairly dry finish. Overall, not a spectacular brew by any stretch, but a very drinkable, generally enjoyable one. Not bad."
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip. Pours a dark amber, with a nice one inch white head, that settles slower than expected. Some solid lacing. Smell is grass, lemon, sweet malts, and maybe a hint of pine. Taste is all of that, with a little breadyness and good balance. Body is thin for me, but on the heavy side for a Mexican beer. Nice amount of carbonation and very easy drinking. This is a nice tasting beer."
""
"This poured out as a typical looking reddish brown color with a thin cream colored head on top. The head fades and doesn't leave too much on the glass. The smell of the beer had some dark malt aromas with a light element of spice in there. The taste was pretty decent actually. I enjoyed the beers hint of holiday flavor it had. The mouthfeel was drinkable and well carbonated. Overall this brew wasn't too bad."
""
"Nice little floral hop kick with a fair amount of toasty-caramel malt. I dont think there is any spice additions, but the interaction of the herbal hop and toasted malt gives it almost a nutmeg/cinnamon character that fits well with the beer. I am glad to see a Mexican brewery delve into the seasonal beer market. Body is fairly light and it drinks really easy. I am contemplating picking up another 12-pack of this before Christmas rolls around, especially at less than 15 bucks...Im fairly impressed!"
"A little better than the original, and it comes in 12-packs which is kind of nice. Look for it at your local bodega."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, slightly creamy and smooth on the tongue. A pretty boring bock flavorwise, although it looked and felt pretty nice."
"Drinkability is great for a bock. I am not normally a fan of bocks as they seem boring to me. However, judging this on style it is much better than most other bocks I've had."
"O: An above average bock and easily my favorite Mexican beer to date (haven't yet tried Bohemia). Definitely worth it if you're a wholesale club member and you can get the Dos Equis holiday sampler on the cheap."
"The aroma is rather light for a bock, it's malty with a hint of brown sugar. The taste thankfully has more to it, bits of caramel and cinnamon and brown sugar. The body is light for a bock but it's smooth enough. I'd have it again and is probably the best Mexican beer I've had."
"Flavor is clearly caramel-rich and backed by toasted cereal grains. Nothing too exciting, but it is impressively Bock-like for a Mexican beer. Body is medium-thin and crisp. Big bubbles of carbonation, but still a very drinkable beer. Worth a try if you can find it."
"I look forward to drinking this when in Mexico during the Holidays. Maybe that is the aura that surrounds this beer. The fact that it is the Christmas beer."
"Into a pint glass, this presents a very clear and deep reddish amber color under a thin but nicely sustained head. The aroma is a mild but noticeable sweet roasted malt nose with a light note of hops. There's a nice sweet roasted malt dominated and robust body here carried along by a pleasant medium carbonation into a caramel noted crisp malt finish. All in all, a no frills but solid bock. Gracias a la Cerveceria por una cerveza con cojones..."
"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth, fairly dry sweetness of this beer, making me quite glad that my initial expectations (throw-away off-style from Mexican lager factory) didn't get in the way of my willingness to try something new."
"I could maybe swallow this better with some Ritz crackers & some of those ugly gift basket cheese spreads I've been gifted over the holidays. But then I wouldn't have any ammo left to pass off to unwanted guests."
"I too am a sucker for mexican beers so i was at cotco and picked this one up. It comes in a 24 pack along with dos equis lager regular. It was exceptional .. I think i am a fan of cuauhtemocs dark beers they brew because this is the 3rd best beer ive had from here. Dark but smoooth !!!"
"Not bad, and certainly better than Negra Modelo, I wish this beer was as ubiquitous as that when I went out to Mexican restaurants. While nothing to get overly excited about, this is a nicely enjoyable brew that I would be happy to be drinking as I am cooking food up in the kitchen, which is exactly what I happen to be doing at the moment."
"Overall, pretty good stuff and a nice little surprise."
"I liked it, it didn't take me ""off to old Mexico", but on a cold night here in western Minnesota it will fill the void nicely"
"First created in 1920, this is an outstanding example of Christmas bock... if only you are fortunate enough to find it."
"PS: This may seem like a strange beer to pick for my 1,900th review, but I was down in Mexico City having celebrated the bicentennial and was working out the week at a car wash owned by a friend, actually there more to learn from his cooking techniques as they serve food at the car wash and he is an amazing chef. We cooked the night away and I kept my mouth from getting dry by drinking Noche Buenas and I have to say they made for quite the refreshing evening."
"D- Very easy to drink beer...I thought it was light enough to enjoy with a spicier dish, and there isn't a lack of chili pepper in Mexico! It has enough flavor to have on its own and I find that this is a very similar beer to Negra Modelo....very decent!"
"Taste, not much for hops or carbonation, but was a smooth malt beer to make up for it, wouldn't call it a malt bomb by any means, but it is a nice alternative to really heavy winter ales. Caramel carries this beer. Wish it was a little more price friendly, but there is no denying it is up there with Negra Modelo in terms of quality."
"After taste: grain, caramel and a little bit coffee note."
"Look: Very dark copper color, creamy foamy head with a finger thick, good lacing; Smell: Floral hops and pumpkin; Taste: Smoked malt, floral hops, molasses ad pumpkin, the flavor pumpkin predominant by far; Mouthfeel: Crisp and clean, high bitterness, high carbonation, robust body; Drinkability: My favorite beer for Christmas."
"The taste is light overall, not what you would think. Mouthfeel is ok, drinkability is ok."
"It's not a big deal, but it's very damn enjoyable, and considering it comes from a macro (with macro pricing)...it's actually good. For less than $10usd a 12-box.... there's no room for complaints."
"This annual Mexican holiday brew is always a favorite. It is generally available November or December, but even then it is a little hard to find. Lightly spiced bock...though I would move it more towards a Vienna lager style. Worth smuggling a case north of the border ...sorry compadres de cerveza... you can't keep it all! Of course you can legally bring a couple up anyway!"
"On the scale of beer in general this beer ranks pretty low, but it's not that far from my expectations."
"3 for summer drinking)"
"Pours a clear maroon color with a medium sized beige head. Smell is toasty caramel like malt. Taste is nutty and toasty flavored malt with a hint of bitterness. Medium bodied and pretty decent actually for what I expected. Flavor ist still on the thin side, but not bad."
"Not life-changing, but I'd certainly not turn it down. A solid amber brew, if not a true bock."
"And no need to worry, any bartender in Mexico knows better than to put a damn lime in a beer!"
"I sampled the 2006 edition from a bottle. I have some question to the style, I'm wondering if this is more of a Vienna Lager than a bock. It reminded me of Dos Equis Amber or Negra Modelo. Poured into a pint glass, seemed a light brown. Carmel malts seemed to be the whole flavor, I didn't notice any hop flavors. Medium bodied. Overall I liked this one, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Very well presented bottle, great seasonal appeal, although it's a shame that the cap underneath the foil is blank. Looks like carbonated iced tea in the glass, very pretty. Appealing appearance and aroma. Aroma is mostly malt, a hint of hops tucked away in the back. A touch of sweetness, resolving to a mild hops finish. Maybe a little too much carbonation... I feel like some flavors might be being hidden by the bubbles. Not a whole lot of depth in the flavor department, but nothing to complain about either. Crisp finish, very drinkable. Probably the best Mexican macro out there."
"Not a bad beer and probably one of the better ones from Mexico. But not a particularly exciting beer either."
"¡Salud!"
"the only seasonal beer of the macro´s;a dark lager beer full bodied, smell roasted and caramel malts, well ballanced, for this its color, low in fermentation, good off course with holiday mexican food (tamales, stuffed turkey) enjoy direct from the bottle or in a goblet; this beer is the most beautiful creations of its brewery, it creates nostalgia all the year until is obtained it at the end of autumn; 100% recommended."
"Perhaps you have been a little unjust with this beer. IT is really a good beer, seassonal, and I understand it maybe because it is a little tiring. BUt once a year it is nice. The foam is a little, but the hops are really present, the aroma and the flavor say so."
"This dunkel lager poured a clear, iced-tea brown color with tan, creamy foam that settled. The smell was malty with a hint of biscuit. The taste was malty with some biscuit and a very light sweetness overall. There was a touch of caramel with a light hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and low carbonation feel. This was a decent lager. Thanks to Borrachito for this one."
"Dark brown color. Small white foamy head. Aroma is malty, caramel and toast. A medium bodied Vienna. Malts are nutty and very slightly sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. A crisp and clean beer. It may be a bit watery, but its certainly a nice Mexican beer. It would be a good beer for a warm summer day, to bad its a Christmas Beer. I do like this beer though. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, but rounded. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This beer really isn't much to get excited about. It's basically a boring, not-quite-average dark lager."
"As it sets in the glass a transpicuous mahogany color with a substantial light tan head that is semi-creamy in texture with a fine veil of lace to obscure the glass. Sweet malt nose with light hints of caramel, clean and crisp with the front sweet and lightly malted, top is thin in its feel. Finish has a moderate carbonation and the hops apropos to the style with the aftertaste being dry, drinkable, but a bit thin waisted for me. A new beer for me from Mexico, just when I think I've had them all, received this one at the ""Strong Ale Fest Beer Swap""."
