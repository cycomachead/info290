"O- an exceptional Bock with lots to offer the refined pallette."

"Overall I rate this one as exceptional.  The flavors attack the palate and leave you satisfied.  I highly recommend this one."

"Not as deep or complex as other bocks. A little too sweet, a little too thin. Alc high enough for a winter beer. Carbonation is light but not bad for the style. Overall drinkable but not one to seek out. Bocks are one of my favorites so my expectations were high. This is the first Atwater I've tried."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is well-balanced between foaminess (3/5) and smoothness (2/5). Closes quite dry, with moderate stickiness on the palate and lips."

"This is Exhibit ""A" with regard to what I have been saying about Atwater's beers - they are hit or miss with little in between. Chalk this up as a hit!"
"Pouring a copper color from the bottle, the aroma was faint and would be best described as dirty malts. The initial taste starts promising but ends up as a weird mix of honey and raisin. These two characteristics are part of a winter beer, yet it lacks the syrupy malts and spices. In the aftertaste, one might note the flat mouthfeel with the dirty malt aftertaste. I really like the bock style, but this one literally has almost nothing positive."

"O - While its not the worst, its a far cry from a good winter beer, and a bock. But it does present some interesting qualities that make it ok for trying at least once."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 11/2012. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, raisin, apple, molasses, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, herbal, earth, and light spicy alcohol. Pretty nice and pleasant aromas with solid balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, raisin, apple, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, light nuttiness, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, light nuttiness, pepper, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Pretty nice flavor balance and robustness, with solid complexity; with slight cloying spiciness on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty good doppelbock. Solid flavor balance and complexity; and quite smooth to sip on. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
"Atwater is sometimes overlooked as a brewery, but their Winter Bock is an excellent beer. It pours dark with a very small head. There are hints of chocolate and a little bit of nuttiness in the taste & the smell. It's a malty brew without much in the way of hops. Its alcohol content is a little higher than one might expect at 7.5 ABV, but it doesn't have that hot, alcohol feel that might be expected. Overall, it's a really solid beer that I plan to have on hand as long as there's snow on the ground."
"Overall: High ABV always brings this rating down a little bit for me as it causes me to pay extra close attention to my consumption. I could certainly get this again and enjoy it, but it's nothing that really blew me away."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, a bit bready. Taste is good. Malts, bready, a touch of nuts, just a bit of alcohol is present. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an excellent example of this style."

"The label is different from what's on this site. It has a blue label now. Transparent, amber colored with a small amount of head. Nice bubbles coming up. Smells malty, bready and caramel-like. Tastes sweet, not a lot of hop quality to it. Bready and malty on the taste. Finishes crisp without much after taste. Mouthfeel is moderate, easy drinking and well carbonated. I wish more American craft brewers would brew bocks. This style is seriously under represented in the US. I feel that this is a great example of one too. Only comes out in the winter and since its so easy drinking and flavorful, I'll seek it out every year."

"This one when poured resembles a brown ale from top to bottom with a thin head and lacing that falls like a bad tent. Amber color is nice to appreciate. Smell lacks, well, smell. Something nutty and hay was about it. Taste takes in more facets than the smell, but more doesn't mean better. Front end is pleasant with a banana bread thing happening, but it doesn't stick around long enough to get an counter the pungent nature of an earthy and slightly sour bitterness, which lingers on the tongue after this thin and slightly oily beverage. Overall, its kind of all over the place and not incredibly pleasant."

"Poured from a bottle into a pokal, the beer is a slightly hazed, ruby-amber coloring with a thin, low profile, frothy biege head. Aromas are roasted malty sweetness, with a slight hops presence, and an overall toffee essence. The beer has strong roasted malt flavors, as previewed with the aromas, with a slight coffee profile. Nutty highlights throughout, as well. The aftertaste is light, with some of the bitterness from the coffee flavors and the slight hops presence shining through a bit more. Light, slick cling along the glass while you drink. The finish is light and nondescript, with a slight kick of sharp bitter at the very end. Average brew for the style."

"I am surprised by the reviews here, I found this to be a solid brew; tastes good, looks good and has a real drinkability for a higher alcohol brew. My first from Atwater, good brew."
"Color was a dark brown with a very light head considering the color. Flavor has a combination of alcohol, dark malt but overall light mouthfeel. Overall, a pleasant beer but not one I'll have again."
"Pours a pretty dark crimson color with a bit of a mahogany tint. Very slight tan head with a bit of retention and quite a bit of spotty lacing. The nose brings forward a bit of dark, slightly-tart cherry. Dark fruits are present throughout. Taste improves a good deal on the nose. There are some dry dark fruits plus some molasses. Cherry notes are there as well. Slightly woody, actually. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a severely-dry finish, all things considered. Drinkability is alright. Nothing really wrong with this, but the finish is quite odd and I didn't particularly care for the nose."
"D I would have another of these on a nice cold evening."
"Overall this was an average bock, there was nothing that made it stick out from all the other bocks and the metallic taste was off putting. I don't think I will revisit this beer anytime soon."
"I'm not a big fan of bocks in general, but this is one of the better ones I've had. A solid beer, but not something I'm gonna go buy again. If you like bocks, try this."
"Hmm.. Interesting brew, the first Bock I've really like and also the first Atwater Brew I found worth repeating."
"Overall: I did not find it as offensive as others but rather run of the mill. I would have another if no other better choices."
"2.0 D: This isn't very good. Taste is a weird combination of stuff I don't really want. Smell is strangely funky. I'll pass on this next time."
"The smell is of black cherries, bananas, sugar, molasses, and caramel, while the taste is a brown sugary syrupy taste with a hint of cherries and caramel that is rather weak. The after taste is a rather sour citrus fruit that spoiled. The mouth feel is very sticky and doesn't give any pleasure to the mouth at all. It would be a drinkable drink if it wasn't such a terrible beer. I know that Atwater Winter Bock is on my avoid this beer at all costs list."
"I usually avoid this style, especially the serious attempts like this one, but this one I will avoid more. I don't remember anything positive about Atwater, but I will try some of their others to see if I should be prejudiced against the brewery (I'll give them a chance)."
"My hope that Winter Bock would be the first Atwater Block beer to earn an above average taste score was almost realized on this sunny Spring morning. Looks like Voodoovator is their last chance to impress. Barring any new releases, of course."
"Drinkability: A below average bock that loses its charm as it warms. The alcohol is high and I really had no desire to finish it after getting half way through. Will pass on in the future. The taste just did not come together for me."
"Generally, I have been disappointed by all the Atwater products that I have sampled, which is a shame since I live in Michigan, I would dearly love for them to have a winner."
"Light brown colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is candied dark fruit.Taste is the same dark fruit,sugar cane and caramel malt.Smooth and drinkable with no evidence of the higher alcohol content.I can see myself buying this again and would recommend to my buddies."
"The beer was drinkable but nothing I'd really consider buying again if I didn't have to. Had a little bit higher expectations for it, but I can see that it has the possibility in being a good beer."
"D- For the ABV and style, this is rather pleasant. The fruitiness and sweetness work well together. Definitely worth a try."
"I had their Vanilla Java Porter and it was pretty good but with the name ""winter bock"" I guess it achieved a sort of sour bitter cherry wheat beer."
"Pours dark with a reddish tone. The aroma is good and makes you want to take a drink. Unfortunately once you take a drink your taste buds are assaulted by a barrage of sour cherry. At first you think that it could have been a mistake but so you cleanse your palette and attempt another drink only to be met again with the lingering taste of sour cherries. Carbonation is average to slightly higher than average."
"d- a little on the heavy side; overwhelming at first. enjoyed best a little warmer than fridge temp"
"The feel is creamy and fizzy. Good enough. Not a good beer, sorry to say. I could finish about half and then I had to dump the rest down the drain. Too bad really."
"Got this one a little late. Even before I poured the beer it was starting to foam out of the bottle. When I poured it out came a nice dark head and kept quite nicely. Nice dark ruby color to it. It smelled a little skunky and slightly smoked. It tasted quite like it smelled. You couled tast a little licorice it it also. Its mouthfeel was a smooth but almost hard water taste to it, kind of gave it a drier aftertaste with a sweet smoked malt taste. Overall it seems like an alright bock."
"D: ok, a casual downer, good for one or two before becoming mundane. Wouldn't rush out for a sixpack, much better examples out their but worth a try as a single."
"Pours a hazy, dark burnt amber color and a clearer, lighter amber along the edges of the glass. 5/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, roasted malt, raisin, slight alcohol, and a slight tart fruit aroma. Fits the style of a Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Initial tartness is almost overpowering and masks the other initial flavors so much that it appears to be quite watery. Lets hope that it improves with more tastes. Tartness and then a dryness dominate; with a slight hop and roasted malt flavor coming through the strongest. Becomes a little more smooth as you progress, but still too dry and tart for my tastes in a Bock."
"D- It's a pretty easy drinker. It says ""HIgh Gravity Lager"" on the label, and the alcohol is very well hidden. A nice lager for the cooler months. It's somehow missing a ""wow"" factor that would make me want to search it out."
"This is pretty much a lame excuse for a Bock. The only thing good about it is the appearance."
"Overall- Sweet yet bland. Boring, I'll pass on this next time."
"An ok beer, but not quite the Bock I prefer. This will do when food or company is the focus and you want a decent beer."
"D: Flavorful but the awkward taste is tough to get past, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style. I wasn't very hopeful but gave the beer a fighting chance. I poured it and the look and smell made me think it might be pretty good. However it all went downhill from there once I tasted it."
"Maple syrup cola. Clean and clear. Solid finger of dirty khaki brown head. Sugary cookie and maple syrup malts on the nose along with cooked vegetable twang, and a woody sourness. Taste is dominated by sour infection and mineral water bitterness. Blech. Drainpour. I don't know why I gave Atwater another chance with their bottles, but never again."
"Drinkability: I'm afraid this one is a drain pour"
"Not much on the aroma, just some light notes of spicy malts. Quaff has that spice note too, but with it comes a funky sour wood taste. Not the best winter beer, don't this I'll be after this one in the future."
"Drinkability: nice drinkability but the alcohol will catch up to you after a few of these. Worth a try."
"A dark amber pour with a solid white head. The head actually did not stick around too long for me. Smells of some malt but more of some red fruits and apple. Quite carbonated and lively with medium body to it. Tastes upfront similar to the nose, but there is a bit of sourness as others have noticed. I was worried at first, but this did not seem to linger. Not as sweet as it could have been, some smokey tones present through the finish. Descent drinkability to this. All in all, not bad."
"Drinkabilty? Not great because of the out of place sour notes but I still didn't have a problem finishing the bottle. A little tweaking and I think this would be a fine brew."
"Very drinkability, excellent flavor,if not too complex, but, why should it be...just a nice, right-on bock. Good stuff."
"Overall a so-so bock from my home state. The mouthfeel was very nice, but the flavor suffered from the sourness. I do hope this bottle was infected because the kegged Bloktoberfest I enjoyed at my Oktoberfest last fall was amazing!"
"An odd brew with sourness and astringency that detract too much. This brewery is 0-3 for me. Getting rid of this underlying sourness that isn't quite right here would help - I noticed it in the other two as well (esp. the Voodoovator). This doesn't work for me, but I was almost able to finish it, because the malt has some potential, but can't compete with detractors."
"Recommended..."
"Dark amber with a nice light tan head, minimal lace. Smells pretty malty and sweet, bubbblegum and caramel. Tastes much like the smell, fairly light for a bock I think but pleasant and malty with some detectable cinnamon spice. Fairly thin mouthfeel and easy drinking for a beer that states ""high gravity lager"" on the label like a lot of cheap malt liquors do. I don't know the ABV but I think the alcohol is well hidden. Tasty, if not spectacular."
"This is a nice looking beer. Dark amber with a thick 2 finger head that dissipates with lots of lacing. Not a strong smell, somewhat malty and clean. The taste started strong but then felt watered down. It did taste malty, not overly sweet at all. Clean, low carbonation, good drinkability. Just a little more mild in taste and smell than I would expect."
"Maybe I got a bad bottle but this is only one of maybe three beers that I have actually tipped down the sink after a few mouthfuls. Very disappointing."
"D: Pretty decent bock, good for cold nights."
"Notes from 12/8/07"
"I could only hope that the reason they are selling these off this cheap is to get rid of the product, but is that really doing this brewery any good?! I certainly would not purchase again."
"D - I could and would. And I will."
"Atwater Winter Bock pitches two fingers of white froth atop an amber body, decently lacing the pint glass. Chocolate and caramel confront the nose, along with bready malt, but the nose is too subtle. The taste is fuller and bolder, with the chocolate and bready malt emerging more prominently. Smooth with modest hints of hop bitterness, Atwater Winter Bock is a solid if unspectacular version of Bock. Easy on the palate if lacking in complexity and boldness, a fine find at the sterling Sun Singer."
"drinkability: ok"
"I could drink more of these but not in one setting. This could be enjoyed very easily as recommended on a cold night. Friends would probably make it even better."
"M&D: Mouthfeel was decent but the finish was just a tad watery. Drinkability is better than average but I was expecting a little more malt for a bock. Overall it's an enjoyable brew - Recommended."
"I like the bock & doppelbock styles. This is a pleasurable drinking beer with a pleasnt taste."
"The bottom line: Atwater delivers what they promise, this beer is definitely a winter style bock...thick, a bit boozy, and definitely a beer that tastes better when the snow is falling."
