"Not like most bocks I've had but you can definitely taste the chocolate taste."

"Overall: A nice Bock, probably note what most Texans expect from a Bock given their Shiner experiences, but this seems close to what the rest of the world thinks of as a Bock. There is a bit of candy note that goes off and pulls down the total scores for me, but enjoyable and worth a try."

"Revolver Bock by Revolver Brewing has a strong mahogany color and a dense head. The smells nutty and somewhat like chocolate, which while pleasant isn't similar to the style. The taste is a rich toasted toffee like taste that feels very strongly towards he malt with little to no taste coming from hops. Every gulp and sip is rich and full bodied with nice amounts of carbonation. Overall Revolver Bock is a pleasant American Ale with decent drinkability even if it isn't very inline with what a bock is meant to be."

"On tap at the Common Table. The beer pours a reddish-brown color with a tan head. The aroma has a good bit of cocoa in it, as well as some light spicing. The flavor is similar. I get some chocolate and dry cocoa, as well as some spice and a hint of earth. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
