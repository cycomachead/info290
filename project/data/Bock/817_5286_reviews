"It is thick and malty in the flavor, and again, just pure bock-styled malt as the flavor. It actually isn't too sweet though, but it is a one-trick-pony."
"D - A little too and too sweet to quaff, but no problem plowing through an 11.2 oz bottle."
"smells like it's going to be heavy but it isn't. Very drinkable and light mouthfeel. fruity aftertaste. very refreshing. I would definitely have this one again."
"Really drinkable!"
"Taste: Caramel malt, very slight skunk. Mild bitterness. Prickly carbonation."
"Drinkability is decent. The sweet malts are a bit too assertive. Still, it's a pretty good beer."
"Surprised, but not disappointed with this easy drinking 7% brew."
"On a side note my great grandfather came to this country from Salzburg so I was excited when I found out where this one was from. I'm sure he would approve."
"in all i d like to drink this again soon"
"Oh yeah!!!! mmm, excellent bock beer. Poured with a big, foamy, frothy off white head and a little lace. Lovely medium amber color, but lighter than most bocks I see. Aroma is very beery, malty, and hoppy. Right away in tasting I get malt sweetness that's immediately tempered with plenty of hops for great balance. The mouthfeel goes with it in great carbonation and body. Definite alcohol warming. Could be a session beer but for the strength. Real easy to have at least another though."
"Poured a light brown/dark copper under 2 centimeter head that settled to thin layer throughout the drink. Strong malt, earthy grain on the nose and more throughout the taste. Malt was the highlight of this beer for me, sweetness, some light carmel in there with a watered finish with taste of farm/earth/grain though not a detractor. Quite drinkable."
"Conclusion: Simple, this is a bit overly sweet, and there's not much going on...it's ok, but only ok."
"Light amber color proper amount of head, moderate retention and lacing. Pleasant aroma of biscuits, sweeter malt, raisins(?). Flavor is balanced. Slightly sweet, Autumn like flavors, controlled. Easy to drink several...no booziness. Light carbonation but full on tongue. Can't think of a more drinkable Bock in Europe."

"Pours a clear amber-tinted gold under a one finger white head that is short-lived, generating neither lace nor trace. Lots of bready grain in the nose, with a hint of fruit. Very prickly and quite light in the mouth. The first taste impression is watery where the malt should be, then a touch of grain emerges with a more persistent grape impresion. Then the alcohol and/or hops kick in, very dry, espresso bitter, climaxing in an achingly raw tone before diminishing to an echo in the aftertaste. The bitter is too metallic, however, to be truly enjoyable. Mediocre experience at best."
"Fairly light and easy to drink in warmer months, would like to try this fresh."
"A little too light on all fronts to be a serious Dopplebock contender. Perhapse a Maibock or Oktoberfest at best. Even at that, there is a harsh astringency (strained grain) flavor that persists. The beer takes on ripe fruit flavors--very ale-ish. Although not perfect, there is a nice maltiness with this beer with bready, caramelly aromas. The alcohols are largely hidden until the finish. Grainy in the end, but not bad beer."
"Vintage 2004. Pours a dull orange with hazed clarity. Creamy three finger head, excellent retention and weak spotty lacing. Apple juice in the nose, with heavy pale malt aromas. Attentuated pale malt upfront, cheap booze flavor- and suitable noble hop bitterness. Dry aftertaste with some fruity ester present, but fairly benign. Medium-full body and lightly carbonated; the apple taste becomes more harsh towards the finish and a slight alcohol warmth develops. This deviates from your typical toasted/caramel doppelbock flavor, but achieves a good balance. However, the estery character would probably be too strong if this were a fresh bottle."
"Average body."
" The numbers I gave this one are based on it being a bock. I enjoyed this one. It is medium-light bodied, carbonation is moderate. Finishes crisp and clean. I found it to be quite drinkable."
"This is an interesting brew and enjoyable to drink. I'd like to think of it as a Helles-Bock as it's not really either, and quite distinct from a strong Eurolager, and those who confuse this for a dopplebock should know better:) Enjoyable and something I wish I would have tried fresh when I was in Salzburg."
"Original Stieglbock is a strange beast. My original impression still stands (bock plus neutered ESL). If that doesn't sound very good, believe me, it isn't. Is a lack of offensiveness reason enough to recommend a beer? Not to me it isn't. Move along, there's nothing here that deserves a second look."
"Mouthfeel- More like a pilsner with more refreshing, lawnmower beer qualities. Tastes like summer. I mus admit, incorporates the alcohol content well into the palate for such a pilsnery dopplebock."
"A damn tasty bock that is somewhere near the line that separates dry bock from malty Pilsner. I suggest you don't quibble about the exact classification and just enjoy this. I prefer to think of it as a sweetish Pilsner myself."
"Poured a bright copper/amber. Nominal head. Quite sweet, with caramel and a touch of sorghum in the malt. A bit of hops brings up the rear to round-out. Malt-centric, but a bit on the lighter side. Surprised to see that it is 7%, as the alcohol was not evident in the slightest. I probably would have liked this to be a bit beefier, but all in all this is not bad - I'd consider it for an introduction to the style."
"I don't know that I'd call this a doppelbock, if so, a very light one. Pours amber/orange. Nice carbonation that sticks around. Slightly sweet, quite malty aroma. The taste is surprising given the appearance, but it does have some doppelbock characteristics. Very malty and sweet, and even a slight hint of chocolate in the finish. Alcohol is well hidden, but ever present nonetheless. A pretty decent beer, but I was expecting something more robust."
"D - Well, I was expecting a heavy beer, and didn't get it. But I liked it and it was a good beerl."
"Pours a hazy bright amber-copper color with a nice foamy lasting off white head that leaves lots of lacing in my glass. Has a sweet fruity and bready aroma. Sweet and malty fruity and caramel flavors, medium body with a slick and smooth mouthfeel, finishes sweet, alcohol well hidden."
"Drinkability: Overall, a pretty decent brew. Nice and quaffable. I think I prefer the doppelbocks, though."
"The Rathskeller Wine & Beer Fest:A small sized head with fine sized bubbles.The body was clear with very little carbonation observed.The hue was pale yellow and the nose was somewhat earthy along with a hint of malt.The flavor was hoppy along with an aftertaste and the mouthfeel was tingly on my tongue and medium bodied.There was virtually no lacing with this beer.For a Bock beer, the hue was wrong."
"Brilliantly clear light golden hue. Thick, solid, persistent head recedes slowly into a thin, dense layer that leaves loosely ordered, muddled lace. The aroma is comprised of leafy, herbaceous hops, and softly rounded toffee along with stately notes of caramelized, brittle like melanoidins. Snap of bready, lightly toasty Vienna malt initially in flavor in ensued by surprisingly assertive, lingering hop bitterness which lends a transient dryness. Sweetness reemerges mid palate along with mild, roasted almond like nuttiness and melanoidin derived, non diacetyl buttery malt. Subdued green, herbal hop undertone adds contrast. Lightly bodied, and concomitantly crisp, yet soft on the palate much like a Dortmunder. Becomes mildly honeyish late once hop bitterness diminishes, but retains an elegant dryness. Finishes mostly dry, with fleeting hints of burnt caramel and trace papery notes of oxidation. Stieglbock is an elegantly balanced, flavorful hellesbock that epitomizes the style. Potentially world class if found fresh. Delicious, superbly hopped and agreeably crisp."
