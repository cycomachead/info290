Mild aroma has notes of baking bread, caramel, brown sugar, and raisins. Tastes sweet and malty up front with notes of toasted bread, honey, and raisins. A mild nutty character shows up midway through, along with some tangy plum. Finishes with sweet caramel and a light bitterness that shows some linger. Medium-bodied with low carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. It's kind of deceptive, the way this has a much fuller flavour than the aroma suggests. That's not a complaint though.

Nose has some earthy hops, light grain, and a general sense of the malt sweetness. Nothing exciting here, and the taste proves this. Some of the hops upfront, light toffee and caramel notes, and some graininess. Alcohol isn't disguised, and that a disappointment at relatively low ABV. However, its got a decent creamy mouthfeel. Not a ton of flavour going for this one, simple and straightforward. Medium drinkability.","liamt07","Dec 21, 2010"

There's definitely alcohol in this. It's nicely warming. I'd like to see more malt in this though. A lot more. And just...more flavor. It seems to be missing something and it lacks depth. It has a clean mouthfeel, a little thin and almost watery. Yeah. It's drinkable, it's not horrible, but I'm a little underwhelmed.

There's a slight metallic sharpness as well. It does get better though as the beer warms a little. Bready at first with some dark fruity flavours, a bit medicinal, like cough syrup in its delivery. A bit of pepper to give it some zip. Finish is earthy, potently herbal, hursky and crackery. Mouthfeel is medium-thick in body with a zippy carbonation. Drier than I expected it would be. Overall not a brutal effort, but the lack of balance in the actual flavour is a little offputting. Lots of individual elements, not enough harmony.","trevorwideman","Nov 01, 2006"

There's minimal head, but the colour makes it look thirst-quenching. Some grainy, brownish lacing sticks to the glass. Smells of bready malt, red wine, prunes, and alcohol. Taste has a bold malt character with an initial alcoholic bite. The mouthfeel is pretty much what this beer is all about. Starts off with a moderately carbonated bite and goes down smooth. The aftertaste fades away quickly. This beer is nothing special but it's still drinkable. The higher alcohol content is reasonably well-hidden by a malty taste and crisp mouthfeel. Decent brew.","cratez","Mar 29, 2006"

4.17,14.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This poured a nice dark red almost brown with a very small head that didn't last very long. Smell is good, fresh barley malt. This stuff tastes great, a caramel body with a mildly bitter finish, it's carbonation is pretty strong but not overbearing as to make it hard to swallow This stuff is dangerously easy to drink. Apparently this won't be around long, so i hope to enjoy this until the end of the season comes along.","funkengruven","Oct 10, 2005"

4.4,20.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This is one incredible bock. Its not overly sweet like I find so many others of the style. It has great balance and an incredibly nuanced malt character. This beer is a must try, especially if you arent big on bocks.","CAMRAhardliner","Beers"
3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a mahogany red/brown, large off-white head forms, goes away rather quickly but leaves some nice lacing. Smells sweet, grassy, earthy, some citrus notes are present. Tastes pretty rich and malty, some sweetness, some floral hoppiness to the end and a smooth finish. Mouthfeel is medium full, very smooth, this one has been sitting around for a while to mellow, it gains a nice roasty/hoppy character. Decent brew for Ontario.","Viggo","0"
3.42,-6.3,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Mostly clear, medium brown colour with deep coppery red highlights topped by a thin, light tan head. Rich malty aroma with some caramel sweetness that reminds me of some British ales. Some graininess and a light floral hop smell. Creamy, malty flavour that's balanced towards sweetness. Little bitterness or hop flavour with the graininess coming through here as well. Medium/full body with moderate carbonation composed of very fine bubbles that meld well with the body. There's also a bit of stickiness that remains on the palate. Not a bad beer at all... I just hope Molson/Coors decides to keep this one.","DrJay","Feb 26, 2005"
3.3,-9.6,4,4,3,3,3,"Taste: Relatively light carbonation and taste, roasty caramel and maybe a bit buttery, mouthfeel is superior to most lagers at first, but dies off quickly.","Goldorak","Dec 04, 2004"
3.76,3,4,3,4,4,4,"A very darm amber beer, who goes into the color of the wine, with no head, only a little head. Smells of caramel and malt nothing else. The taste is very smooth, maltish, flavors of roasted coffee(espresso) caramel and alcohol. A taste of chocolate is also perceivable at much, pretty sweet of a seasonal.","3Vandoo","Nov 29, 2004"

3.91,7.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Now, 2004: my first thought, pulling the bottle out of the sixpack, was actually surprise at how light it was. Which makes rereading my prior review a little amusing (to me). Red-Gold honey, a limited head. It's quite crisp, with hop bite battling the bocky malt sweetness all the way through. It's rather refreshing when you put it up against all the heavy bocks around this time of year.","the42ndtourist","Jun 18, 2004"

3.53,-3.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a looker of a beer, a seductive clear chestnut hue with a quick splash of beige head. Spiced fruit on the nose, burnt malt that comes across sweet as well, with a trace of alcohol. The flavour occurs in layers: dried fruit and spice at first with a full-bodied mouthfeel, which then drops to a bold roasted malt presence in the middle, and then melds into a grassy hop finish which is more oily on the palate, blended with a sweet caramel accent. The flavours and textures take you around the block a few times, and it's a pleasant trip each time. Complex enough to keep me interested, but not something I could drink on a regular basis. Good thing it's a seasonal.","IronDjinn","Jan 04, 2004"

3.2,-12.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Tap - Copper brew with a small head. Malty aroma with a medium body. Taste is very creamy which I approved with small traced of burnt malt. Not the best of bock but still a great beer that should be made available all year long. The Creemore brewery is starting to impress me with two great german inspired brew (lager and bock).","Phyl21ca","Jan 31, 2003"

3.3,-9.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Drinkability: Above average. Nothing in this beer to remember it by, but not a burden on the palate. Having read the description of the style, I guess I expected more of a hop influence (being the hop-head that I am).","OldFrothingSlosh","Dec 02, 2002"

3.38,-7.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The look, smell and taste of this beer left me looking for something more. It lacked a distinct flavour. A signature of its own. Maybe my opinion is skewed in part because of my love for Creemore Springs Lager. One sip of the lager, whether you're in Canada or half way across the world, and YOU KNOW it's Creemore Lager. That is the distinct impression left by that beer. But the urBock......i don't know. i was underwhelmed. This is NOT a bad beer. It is however quite ordinary.","Popsinc","Beers"
3.45,-5.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The beer pours a somewhat murky brown; the head is modest in size, the lace fair and clings in sheets to the glass. Nose is malt, caramel, somewhat sweet as in ripe fruit. Start is lightly malt sweet, the top is middling, the finish is piddlingly acidic, and puny in the hops arena, dry aftertaste. Not a bad drinking beer, just a little ""Wimpy"" on the hops, but then I'm a ""Hop Head"".","Gusler","0"
