"this is the best beer from Genesee"
""
"Genesee Bock brewed by Genesee Brewing Co. / Dundee Brewing Co. This brew has an ABV of 5.20% The bock pours out a nice light brown color , with a nice off white head. This brew smells, sweet, with grains and malts. You also pick up some hops at the end. The taste is bold with flavor. There is some sweetness .malts, and grains. Genesee Bock has a nice smoothness to it. There is a lot going on in this brew, but there is nothing overpower about it.  The mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is nothing bad about the mouthfeel of this brew. I like how smooth this brew goes down. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.50 out 5. Genesee Brewing Co. / Dundee Brewing Co. did a nice job with this one.  I would buy this brew again."

"Love this beer mainly for the can but the beer itself is pretty good too. So much better than all other Genny beers."

"Pours a wonderful copper brown. Has hues of amber and gold and has a creamy persistent head of off white foam.  Nose is malty.  Soft round bready malt with a touch of sweetness.  No hops scent except for the idea of grass.  There's corn on this nose as it's part of the malt character but it does not smell like corny sweetness. It has a light scent to the nose.  The taste is excellent.  Clean, a touch sweet with a bit of caramel.  Has no hop flavors.  Really excellent and no bitterness form hops either.  They are a part of the mouthfeel though as they dry on the palate lightly in the crisp finish.  The corn does lighten the flavor while it is not excessively sweet.  In the finish it's crisp, just dry and lingers softly and sweetly. Not cloying, nodiacetyl which is often just a slickness without a heavy buttery taste,  and has no alcohol on the palate.  The only criticism I have is that I think the corn keeps it from being as malty rich as it might have been without it .  But it is very well done and adds lightness to the flavor and drinkability.  The  mouthfeel is thinner side of medium."

"12oz can into a pint glass. Very cool can design btw. Pours a crystal clear darkish brown with a half finger off-white head. Poor head retention and lacing but I really wasn’t expecting a whole to out of this beer. Aroma has burnt caramel, toffee, and some molasses. Perhaps a touch of corn as well. More caramel on the taste along with molasses and a quick whiff of alcohol. Light corn with a little grassy hop character. Slightly sticky with very little bitterness and a bit of a thin mouthfeel. Overall, while this is far from a great beer or a good example of the style, it is very refreshing and quite tasty considering the price. A beer I like to pick up every spring."

"O - A decent bock beer that hits all the right marks. They only bring it out in January and it's worth stocking up a 12 pack or two if you like this style."

"O-I didn't expect much because its genesee but it is a smidgen better than what I expected."

"The taste is sweet and malty upfront with a slight moderate hop bitterness at the end. While not as strong ABV as some I have had I happen to like this one and find it to be very drinkable."
""
"O - Overall, this isn't a bad beer. Most people equate Genesee with crap beer, and yes, a lot of their beers are cheap swill. However, this brew isn't. It's on the light side for a bock, but has good flavor and very drinkable. This is certainly a sessionable beer, and any bock or strong lager fans should try it if you can get your hands on it."
""
"Poured out as a brownish color with a cream colored head. The lacing and retention were minimal. The smell of the beer is malty, some earthy hops and yesterday on the nose also. The taste of the beer is malty, toasted and had a good amount of caramel. The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and gently carbonated. Overall this a decent bock."
""
"O-Very pleasant. Worth drinking. Good way to welcome in the Spring, and it is my Super Bowl beer of choice. Most people wouldn't expect this caliber of beer when the see the Genesee name on it. It is not the best beer or bock in the world by a long shot, but I challenge you to do any better for the money."
""
""
""
""
"This was actually a solid offering from Genesee. I honestly would say it has a bit more character than Shiner Bock. You can't beat this beer for the price."
""
""
"Awesome beer for the price. Good flavor and drinkability. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
"O- This beer is really easy drink, and I've certainly had worse. Light on the wallet at $7.50 for a 12 pack. You get a great bang for your buck with this beer and it may turn in to my go-to session beer from now on. Much better than the piss-water."
""

""
""
"This is a classic seasonal in Western NY. It's nothing super special, but still pretty tasty anyway."
""
""
""
""
"notes: appearance is nice, aroma is good. Taste is a disappointment."
"It's very easy to drink with a fresh taste. It tastes even better as tonight blizzard rages on. There is no bad aftertaste. It's clean and you can drink it with anything or by itself. I find that all of the genny beers have their own taste which is a good thing. I like a cheap beer that is pleasant to drink at any time."

"O: I've enjoyed it for many years, it's a genuinely good Bock, and for the price it's simply outstanding. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a high flavor-to-cost ratio."
""
"Cheers!"
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
""
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it was light, easy drinking, and pretty flavorful. It was a decent beer of the style as well. I thought it was pretty good overall, I'd choose it over other similarly priced, lighter beer."
""
""
""

""
""
"O - A beer lover's alternative to Shiner Bock. Not quite as poundable but plenty refreshing and flavorful. Stands up well to calamari; I'd also happily pair with a lightly battered fish and chips or wings. Well done, Genny!"
"This is surprisingly good for Genny. I've been drinking Genny all my life coming from northern PA and this is the first one I've truly enjoyed. It has flavor and a high level of drinkability. It's definitely worth a try."

"Overall / Drinkability: For the price ($8.52 after tax for a 12 pack) a very good deal for a beer with some good character to it, just not really good character. Quite drinkable, but not very noteworthy either. I've had better Bock beers, but this one is reasonably good for the price."
""
""
"The beer poured a light brown with orange highlights and a smalle head that left a little bit of lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet malt with the tiniest bit of hops. The taste is a big sweet bready malt hit. The mouthfeel is a little watery with surprisingly little carbonation. This is a great beer for the price. It's a little one-note, but that note is played surprisingly well."
"Probably the best price performer I have ever had. $13.07 for a case of 24 cans. Just wish it was available for a longer period in PA. Limited supply this year supposedly because they have decided to keg a large portion of the seasons supply. I bought every case that my local distributor had ( all 4). He mentioned some people aren't going to be happy with me! Very consistent from year to year. Decent mouth feel, very malty, not much hop presence. But for what it is, it's worth very penny. Those who like Yuengling lager wil enjoy his. May be bit sweet for some. If you can find it, buy it. Great session beer."
"Overall impression: This beer is an enjoyable but average bock style beer that has one big thing going for it, cost. It cost about 7 bucks for the 12er. This is probably a beer that will go into the rotation simply for this reason."
""
""
""
""
"Maybe Bock beers are just not for me."
""
""
"overall - pretty good beer, one of the best offerings I've had from Genesee, at the price point, definetly worth checking out"
""
"I was really impressed with this beer. It was $8.99 for a 12-pack. I could drink a lot of this. It's not the best bock out there, but for a simple and flavorful beer that you could drink a lot of, the price is right for this one."
"Overall this as by far the finest offering from the Genesee brewing company, and one that I wish I could get all the time. It would easily replace my regular swill of choice and be a staple in my fridge with the grandma appearance of the green goated can."
""
""
"O: The easiest of drinkers. Smooth overall beer and for $8 a 12 pack it's really one of the best buys on the market."
"O: Fear the goat! A local treasure that is an early sign of spring. Being that it is still January in western NY, they may have jumped the gun on this one. But bless them for trying."
""
"Overall its a nice beer. No complaints. Decent enough malt profile, easy drinking and c'mon that is one pretty sweet can that its coming out of!"

"It has a great feel in your mouth and is very refreshing. This Bock is really surpprising and really good. I give it an overal of 4. give this one a try when you can, you will like it at a nice price of $15.00 for a case of cans."
"Reviewed from notes. Enjoyed many times now formally reviewed for the first time. Poured from 12oz can into dimpled glass mug. Pours a rich but bubbly mahogany color with a nice half inch thick head. Taste of malt is good and present throughout but never heavy thanks to the carbonation before finishing crisp and clean. This is a good bock for the price and a style I wish I could get year round especially this one as the price for a 12 is great and good as a session. Probably my favorite from Genesee next to the more common Genesee Cream Ale. Solid bock beer for the price and surprisingly not watery...the can artwork is also great, once referred to as ""grandma beer"" by a Bud Light drinking party goer who saw me drinking the ""funny"" cans"
"O- This beer has a clean light flavor but there are nice hints of bock beer. The big fizz and sulfur grow a bit to strong as the beer opens."
"O - REALLY enjoyed this beer. Interesting enough that it's worth your while, and the fact that you can get it at 67 cents a can really makes this a worthy investment. A truly great value beer. Also, the robust, portly character of the can with an almost comedic decoration adds to the fun that this beer proffers."
"Overall: This beer was a huge surprise when I first tried it a couple month's ago. It was the price and not the dreadful packaging that turned my head and made me pick up a twelve pack--$9:98---please. It's been my go-to beer ever since. Great stuff."
"Taste is mostly near-bunt malt without much sweetness in tow. Dry, even finish without much, if any, hop character. One of the better brews I have had from the Genesee/Dundee lineup. Compared to Shiner Bock this one is not as crisp and clean, but it has a more pronounced malt flavor and body. Not too shabby of a brewski here, Id drink it again."
"O- Overall this is a decent enough brew and a great buy for the price (12pk $7.99)."
"Taste-Watery malt, faint toasted malt sweetness. More character and flavor than BMC brews. Very easy drinking and sessionable. Not unpleasant and a step up from your run-of-the-mill BMC."
"The aroma was your classic malty bock. Nice sweet caramel and nutty aromas mixed in with a good earthy tone. The flavor followed through very closely with a nice bitter malty flavor and a good amount of sweetness in it as well. Carbonation that is more then decent never let it go flat and kept you entertained throughout the session. Easily a sessionable beer, as I could have thrown down more then one"
"Overall: Milder and gentler than most, but gains a boosted drinkability from the lower level of alcohol and the crisper-than-most level of carbonation. And it's cheap. If I'm paying only $2.75 at a restaurant, a six'er of the stuff in stores should be pretty reasonable."
"I try not to judge beers based only on the price but this one gets high marks for being an unbelievable value. I was drawn in by the cute retro packaging and the price, however I was extremely surprised when I first tried this. It's the first year I've seen it available in my area and I've turned on a LOT of my friends to this brew. I've probably bought five or six 12 packs of this since I found it in February. I'm already mourning the end of ""Goat Season""."
"Overall a quality seasonal macro offering; along with Shiner one of the original American bock beers. At $6.99/12-pack this is a great bargain and good go-to spring offering."
"Really awesome camping beer!!"
"overall- for the price of 8$ a 12 pack quite great! I pick this as my favorite canned beer, like I said for the price and if you are even thinking of liking a Gennee brew this is good!"
"D: session beer. 'Nuff said."
"this is a historical favorite of mine, drank this before I knew what quality craft beers were"
"D - A pretty average bock, reasonably priced and probably the best beer made by Genesee I've ever had, but if you're a bock fan, there are better choices."
"Looks great pouring a deep copper color with quick to fade head. Smells of malt and faint hops---nothing overwhelming. Taste is great! Malt dominates with nice bitter hoppiness. Goes down easy and would be a great beer with food. Tremendous value!! Hats off to Genny!!"
"With all due respect to Genesee, this beer almost seems better than it has any right to be. It is ridiculously cheap, yet it is legitimately good. The price to quality ratio for this beer makes me genuinely giddy. When it finally reaches Rhode Island this year, I am going to buy cases. I desire more of this sweet biscuit corn soda!"
"This isn't the most balanced bock out there or the most flavorful, but it's not one to pass up either."
"Not an impressive finish, but a fine and easily-sessioned beer (and a great value). And the can design is retro-hip!"
"At one time this was considered the best bock beer in America. A beer I look forward to every spring."
"D-high, low abv makes this a great session candidate..."
"D- Nice drinkability, easy to drink and very cheap, with the exception of the carbonation being way too high for my liking this beer is pretty good."
"very easy to drink, exspecially for $10 a 12 pack. the only time i would buy this again would be for something cheap to play drinking games with or go to a party."
"D - very drinkable; unassuming and undemanding; makes me wish it were April"
"Overall - I think we have a winner here. This is a nice session beer at lower than BMC prices. Consider it a macro beer that actually has some subtle complexity and is brewed to a style other than American Pilsner. I'm going to buy this again for sure."
"Worth waiting for. Unfortunately, Genesee keeps the Bock season way too short."
"Drinks easy, starting improving once near ale serving temp, a nice American regional take on the style, would happily kill a sixer of this during a game or BBQ. Flavor really picked up once warm"
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and caramel. Taste is rather mild, some malts, a hint of caramel, not a whole lot of flavor. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a decent beer."
"D: I found this to be quite enjoyable. I understand the pricing on this is very agreeable as well. Good show!"
"(D) again (and for the last time) this is a $6/12 pack beer? a great beer for the money (or a good beer in general), and spot on for the rather forgotten style of 20th century AMERICAN bock beers. i plan to stockpile next JANUARY on this once-a-year and unusually affordable treat. a near-perfect session beer."
"D: Surpassed my expectations as a modest ABV bock with good lager qualities and a slightly sweet and smoky malty profile. Love the artwork on the can, like the contents a little bit less. Serviceable though."
"The smell of this beer is a faint amount of malt and thats about it. Its a rather dark color, with a thick foamy head in my goblet. the taste is of faint maltyness in the front and all the way through with no backbone to this beer. it is very drinkable, and for the price, 6.49 for a 12 pack, its a good beer to have after uve already had some real good beer and want just one more the tastes arent amazing, but for the price, they know what kind of beer it is. if you can get ur hands of a 12 pack id advise because it will last you a long time and you wont regret it."
"D - well what can i say - not my cup of tea but this has a lot of character. awesome looking can, too."
"Picked up a 24pk from Bell Beverage for $10. Wow. 12oz can poured into a mug. Pours a darker amber with 1/2"" tan foamy head that doesn't stick around. Aroma isn't all that impressive, just some general malt sweetness. In the taste I get some subtle chocolate/molasses character and some metallic flavor which is odd. Very soft carbonation and quite easy to drink. Overall a great value for such a modestly-priced brew."
"I heard that there's a lot of love for Genny Bock, so I picked up a single. The beer I'm reviewing right now came from a case that I picked up for a $15.50. Love that it comes in cans, love the look of the cans, and love the look in the glass. This being a lower level beer, I would not be against sipping it from the can if I'm enjoying it outside or sneaking it onto a golf course. I have found my spring value beer, and I'm pretty happy about it."
"This is a beer that's not going to blow any serious BA away, but Genny products are the beers I grew up on, and I'm glad for the chance to revisit it."
"I remember having this beer in the early '90's (not sure if it was the same recipe, although), I recall the brown colored can. Coming back from retirment, this beer is a welcome sight. Inexpensive and very tasty. Love the retro packaging. It's a clear copper color with a relatively thick white head. The aroma is malty, although a bit more toasted malt than I recall....crust on highly-toasted bread. The taste is malty and flavorful. It's a little drier than I'd like, although this makes it a very drinkable brew. Not terribly complex, but very enjoyable. Nice beer for the expense!"
"I loved this stuff. I'll definitely seek it out again."
"Drinkability: Going into reviewing this beer, not knowing anything about this beer and paying only $6.29, I am really pleased with this beer. Anyway the drinkability is surprisingly smooth, but not creamy like I like in my bocks. Still if you're in Northern Wisconsin pick some up cheap!"
"Now...if they would only bring back ""12 Horse Ale"""
"Genesee bock really impressed me for what it is. It is clean and extremely easy to drink, just like a bock should be. Also, any bock in a kick ass can that costs 6.99 a 12 pack is good in my book. As far as cheap beer goes, this is the BEST value I've seen in a long time. Maybe ever."
"If you are on a budget, you could do a lot worse than this. Heck we are planning to go back to an all inclusive resort this year in Cancun, and I wish the DosXX dark (cerveza obscura) they serve was as good as this."
"d- the drinkability is ok, since this is my first bock beer i'm not used to the flavor, and i can't say it's my favorite, i don't think i would drink this again."
"Overall this lacked flavor and I would not want to drink this beer again when there are better beers in the same style category."
"Overall a nice solid spring bock, very tasty; light and crisp, I will be getting several 12 pks to have for warmer weather...a good balanced beer, easy drinking! I like this one a lot."
"In the end I was very impressed by this offering. I got two 12 packs for about $13. You can bet I am going to be buying and drinking more of this."
"I have to say, I am overall extremely pleasantly surprised. Beers at this price for this amount usually tend to signify half-assed brewing, but this is a solid work. I'd like to try this on tap sometime, but I don't know if I'd buy in the store again."
"My pour produced a finger of ecru head with low retention, quickly becoming wisps. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity and lots of CO2 bubbles gently rising to the surface. Nose was really malty sweet accompanied by a light tang. Mouthfeel was medium with an unpleasant astringency, like gargling with hydrogen peroxide, in the mouth. Oof. Finish was slightly sweeter, but I just could not get past that initial taste. I have a 12-pack, so I CAN revisit this one, but for now, I am sure I will be one of the low scores."
"D-not the most amazing bock but for 8 bucks a 12 pack i think its amazing and is definately a go to due to its solid taste and low abv????"
"Drink ability: Very high due to the fact that it's not overly filling for a darker brew. This is a good beer to drink when you want a more bold flavor yet require refreshment."
"I have to admit that I'm biased towards this beer. I know it's not the best bock by a long shot, but at $0.50/can, you can't beat the price. Add in the mystic of limited availability and great drinkability and you have one of my go-to cheap beers"
"I realize now that I must take the remaining 11 cans out of the Fridge. It is how it was years ago, all malt. Pretty can design though."
"it."
"Had this directly from the can, so I'll rate the appearance based on the can's looks. I really enjoy the design. Smelled of malts and a touch of cooked corn. Who cares, it's good old Genesee, it's their signature. However, I found the taste to be pretty bland. Nothing off-putting, just really light and bland. I wish they could up it a touch, oh well. Smooth and Genny-like. Could do a few no problem. A good beer to have a casual burger cookout with."
"Love seeing the goat arriving on store shelves. I believe this beer is in limited run, so I grab it when I can."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer is crisp and clean all the way around. The body of the beer is a bit light for my taste. In all honesty this is a good beer. This would see more appearances in my home if it wasnt a seasonal."
"D: It's actually not bad. A pretty good session beer."
"I don't like beers that are too carbonated or too hoppy. This beer did not disappoint."
"D: For the price of $6 a 12 pack they should make this year round. A good beer priced excellently. I have never had anything this good that I paid less for save homebrew. They really need to make this year round."
"As I said before this is an entirely decent beer. It's not a standout by any means, but especially given the price it's an outstanding value. For the rock bottom price it's hard to beat it. I'll gladly store a few 12ers of these in the basement to serve as cheap session brews when I'm just looking to knock back a few."
"Mahogany colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is fruity-citrus.Taste is light fruits with a steely caramel at the end.A pretty decent beer that probably would go well on those hot summer days.I should try it again sometime in July or August!!"
"Best cans ever"
"after tasting this genny product its a shame this is a limited release."
"For about 50 cents a can, this stuff is an absolute steal. World class beer? Not really. But it's leaps and bounds better than anything I've ever tasted in its price range, which means when I need to think about how much I've got in my wallet while shopping for beer, this is sure to come to mind time and time again."
"It's no masterpiece, but at $5.99-6.99 per 12 pack, its worth it. I'll probably have an open 12 in my fridge throughout its availability."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. A nice beer if you want to break the routine of macros, but better bocks are out there."
"Cheers, Rochester!"
"The beer pours a nice dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pilsner and crystal malt scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has a crisp lager feel with just enough caramel sweetness to add some complexity. It's not overly complex, but it goes down smooth and finishes dry with a balanced bitterness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good bock. Like I said, it's not the most complex and interesting beer on the market, but it's smooth and easy drinking."
"(rated Mar 11, 2008)"
"Easy-drinking enough in a ""no frills"" sort of way. Cheap - only about seven bucks for a 12-pack. Not bad, but nothing special."
"D- rating this among world class bock in terms of flavor, content, etc. would be unfair, but in the world of large scale production brewing (pre- budweiser american ale era) i think that genny outdid themselves. this is a very plain and simple beer without any fancies or nuances, but it also lacks bullshit, and it is difficult to find anything wrong with it, keeping in mind that it came from the king of cheap beer. having crisp refreshing supreme drinkability any time of year doesn't hurt either."
"Nick: C (2.9)"
"Not a bad beer at all! This beer surprised me a little. I knew it was probably going to be grainy, but what got me was that it was a good grainy taste. I wouldn't mind having another one of these real soon."
"very drinkable, because it's incredibly smooth just shocked by all of the grapy flavor."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus fizzy off-white head, not much sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty and lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with lots of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew."
"Drinkability - not a true bock in terms of strength, but it has some bock character in the taste. Not the worst spring beer, I'd have a few more."
"D: Overall this is a highly drinkable beer, and I might reach for it year-round if it were available. When I'm looking for something that I don't need to think about too much but I still want taste, this would be a perfect choice. Probably a step above Yeungling Lager on the macro-lager taste scale. Not too complex, but still enough backbone for those of us who like to actually taste our beer. The cans alone make this a worthy brew to try at least once. I commend High Falls for bringing it back, and hope it sells for them."
"Final Note: I have a soft spot in my heart for Genesee, as for as long as I've been able to consume alcoholic beverages legally (30 years) Genny has always been there for me. I'm a big fan of the Cream Ale and now I'm also a fan of ""The Goat""."
"P.S. I love the regional brewers like High Falls, Matt, Lion and IC. I hope they are around forever. America is about choice! Anyone can brew a great beer for $30 a case, it takes skill to brew a nice beer for $12 a case."
"For some odd reason, this beer is serving as my reentry into reviewing beer. It has been sometime...8 months to be exact...that I have reviewed a beer. I picked up this beer a few weeks ago and really enjoyed the effort from High Falls. The beer pours a reddish brown with a bubbly, white head. There is lots of lacing on the glass. The smell is rather metallic. The mouthfeel is wet and sweet. The beer tastes like a beefed-up version of Yuengling. Drinkability is good. Worth a try for $11 a case."
"This a nice, mild springtime/summer beer that is an economical thirst quencher. I bought a second 12-pack but probably won't buy another until next year."
"Well, I am just about done with the 12 pack I picked up a few weeks ago and decided that I should review one before they are finished. Was very happy to see this brew, I can remember selling it when I worked at a Grand Union about 17 years ago. Well anyway, this brew poured to a deep amber color with shat I would call brown highlights. The head has a light tan color, quite small and breaks down quickly, minimal lacing. The aroma has caramel malts come through, slight grain presence. The taste is fair with caramel,slight hop presence and a slight metallic flavors. Has a slight dry finish to it. Overall, I would pick this up a few ties during the spring if Genesee continues to make it. Worth the $6.49 a 12 pack. Not the greatest brew but one that has some character and it is somewhat local."
"I snagged this while in New York, the retro packaging sucked me in. It looks good from the pour, a nice orange brown with a thick head that lingers momentarily. Much darker than any macro beer I've ever had. The aroma is sweet and grainy with not too much else besides a hint of dry toastiness. The flavor is a bit better, with just a bit of malty sweetness, and hints of caramel. The graininess I associate with most macros is still there but it's muted a bit. I think that if compared to craft beers of the style this one come up short, but if you compare it to other macros it is breath of fresh air."
"Was happy to pick this one up- a great alternative to the Key Light monopoly on Beirut and a fun beer to show off to your friends for a more than reasonable price. I've bought 2 12 packs of this so far for myself and will keep buying it as my ""cheap beer of choice."""
"Sweet can. I love the old school can as well as the $6.45 price tag for a 12 pack. This brew poured wonderful reddish amber, with an off white head. The head is frothy and leaves good lacing on the glass. The aroma is of light malts and straw, adjusted with corn or rice. Also there is just a hint of caramel. The taste is sweet and malty, bready and pretzel like. Hops are almost a nonfactor. The palate is medium bodied creamy and smooth. Finish is short and sweet. Overall not outstanding but a good beer at a great price."
"D = I could definitely drink 6 or so of these in one sitting. not bad."
"The can alone is easily worth half the price of admission here, very similar to the original from the 70's that I remember fondly. This latest version is a dark iced tea brown with a big fluffy off white head and decent lace. It has a sharp wheat and mild caramel aroma. This is followed by a big caramel and dry herbal hop taste. A little rough around the edges but I don't find this to be bad at all as bock's go. Well carbonated and very drinkable. Nice job for a blue collar, low priced bock in a fun can. Party on Genee!"
"I'm grad that I was given a can of this beer to try because that way I don't feel ripped off. This is definaty one local brew that I can not support. It has that typical Genesee River smell and taste that I expected. I'm not quite sure how they consider this a bock beer."
"D: Good, and I will buy it again while it's available. This is a change as I've come to appreciate the upped flavor right from the can. I'm not the biggest fan of bock beers and only Celebrator has really showed me what a bock could/should be. Worth a try for the price."
"Not really craft beer, but not macro-slop either. A bargain at 6.99 per 12."
"I could pound half this 12 pack in a short amount of time. It is drinkable and refreshing. Not a masterpiece but for $6.99 you can't go wrong!"
