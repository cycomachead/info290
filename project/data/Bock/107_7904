3.51,-11.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer looks like a damn good bock, it's got a beautiful deep amber color with a beige head on the surface. The smell leaves much to the imagination as it doesn't follow the color in quality. The aroma consists mainly of woodsy notes and light malt tones. The overall nose isn't very strong. The flavor has a very woodsy taste. It tastes identical to a homebrew that my friends and I made, that was a failed attempt at a regular stout. We did use Ringwood ale and I am certain this is responsible for the similarities in flavor. The mouthfeel is a tad on the acrid side due to the woodsy taste. There should be chocolate in the flavor of this beer (Schokolade = german for chocolate), but I sure as heck don't taste it. This still is pretty easy to drink, though as I thought my stout was a failure, I think the same of this beer. It's pretty good but nothing special in the slightest.","Vdubb86","Feb 15, 2011"

4.19,5.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Tastes very similar to the aroma, with a hefty dose of bittersweet toffee and butterscotch candy. Hops add notes of grass and peppery spice.

4.03,1.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a lovely clear ruby brown, with a nice finger of ecru head that doesn't really lace much at all. The smell is heavy on the syrup, molasses, and chocolate, with some slight plum and fig hints poking through the haze as well. The taste is of darker malts and more of a cocoa than a chocolate flavore. A fine combination of chocolatiness and bockiness! The body is a light medium and runs velvety smooth over the tongue, allowing this brew to be drunk and enjoyed for many an hour.","TMoney2591","Feb 19, 2010"

The nose is subtly roasty and darkly chocolate-ish. The flavor, however, is fuller. It's gently bready, but with a caramelish side, and there actually is some ""schokolade"" to this beauty. It's not rich or full, but it does lean towards maltiness, and as it warms it tends to express a fuller character. There's some nuttiness, and the bitterness is reminiscent of walnut skins.

3.48,-12.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"taste begins fruity, cherries and dates, then gets a little bitter and gritty, roasty,nutty, and it ends about there. Mouthfeel is medium, finish is brief and still chocolatey. A bit fizzy, and a bit more bland. Sorry, to say, ....it's not bad at all, just lacking what we'd really like from a bock. Flavor just leaves a lot to be desired. could be a lot tastier, more rich, full, maltiness is in order.","feloniousmonk","Jan 17, 2005"
3.31,-16.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Taste: Okay, this is a bock. Dang, I've never had that caramelly bock mixed with chocolate before. That's kinda interesting. In the end, the chocolate dominates. After the chocolate, I get some rebounds of chocolate, but nothing new to really captivate my interest. Medium bodied (bordering on medium-thick) with some sharp carbonation on the tongue piercing home. Boy, I wish there was more to this beer. It's got the sweet to carry things along, but all I get is chocolate and a distant caramel. One dimensional, which could make for a good session beer, but it's just too sweet for that. I'd love to support the home team, but I just can't do it.","mentor","Dec 15, 2004"
3.33,-15.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Taste is soapy-sweet, rummy malt. Light roasted flavors mingle, paving the way for some spicy hops that gradually come in, resulting in a meaty-homebrew bitterness that lasts long into the finish. Medium-bodied, not cloying or too thick. Not bad, but this doesnÂ’t do a lot for me.","alexgash","Nov 06, 2004"
3.6,-9.1,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the trade. This Bock pours a dark brown color with a medium light tan head. Thin and spidery lacing. The aroma is lightly malty with chocolate undertones. Medium-bodied and very sweet with chocolate malt, caramel and nut flavors. Some smoke can be detected at times too. The finish is lightly sweet and not very interesting or flavorful but luckily it doesnÂ’t detract too much from the experience. All in all a fair Bock.","Dogbrick","Aug 09, 2004"

3.87,-2.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Backwash: Another beer that makes me wonder why Iowans would ever buy a macro beer. Millstream beers remind me a bit of Ithaca BrewingÂ’s offerings (except for the bigger Ithaca beers). They are generally well done, but lack some flavor and body concentration. All-around, a fine effort.","Dantes","Jun 15, 2004"
3.75,-5.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Smooth malt driven joy. Nice mix of chocolate & coffee with a slight plum flavour that keeps me on my toes. Finishes with a slight metallic twang, & no significant hop flavours. Medium / full bodied, weak carbonation. Very easy drinking.","xgrigorix","May 20, 2004"
3.37,-14.9,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Because I live in a state that has only one brewery, I'd like to be able to say that I enjoy the hell out of their beer. 'Drink local' and all that. Schokolade Bock doesn't do much for me though. I'd like to think that it's a couple of fixes away from being good so I'll keep trying it year after year and hope that some changes are made. For now though, I think I'll stick with a few of Millstream's other offerings.","BuckeyeNation","May 05, 2004"
3.72,-6.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer as it extravasates the bottle is a deep limpid sanguineous color with the head Bunyanesque in size, spumescent in texture and a beauteous light tan color, the lace forms a silky skirt to surround the glass. Nose is sweet chocolate, caramel, slightly earthy, crisp and clean to the senses. Start is a bit tart with a sweet malt background; the top is fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a delightful acidity, the hops personable in their spicy presence, somewhat vinous aftertaste that is also quite dry, an interesting beer and I was given this beer quite some time ago by BelgiumBum, and I thank him for a chance to sample this most unique beer.","Gusler","Mar 14, 2004"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very dark brown with a head that goes away quickly. Leaving a thin rim of lace around the glass. Aroma is a nice mellow malt and chocolate. Taste is very nice. Nice dark chocolate and malt bitterness. The bitterness is finely balanced with malt. The mouthfeel and finish are a little dry. That is fine. This is an excellent bock.","daledeee","Mar 14, 2004"

3.08,-22.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Overall, a decent bock I wouldn't mind trying again to see if this was just a bad bottle or not. However, given this beer's scarcity, that's not likely. Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this difficult to obtain Iowa beer!","PhantomVodoo","Jan 12, 2004"
3.48,-12.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Reddish brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and sweet.A medium bodied bock. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. There is a residual sourness/tartness that sort of dominates everything else in this beer. The finish is surprisingly dry. The dryness and the unexpected sourness (is it supposed to be there? Or is the beer infected?) make this an interesting and very different bock beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and a little sour.","beerguy101","Jan 01, 2004"
3.72,-6.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer is a almost-black colored brew, with dark brown tones showing through the light. Small brown head that takes off quick. The aroma is of roasted chocolate. The first thing that hits my tounge in this brew is a strong nug taste. Im not a big nut fan so i cant tell you what kind, but thats about half the taste. The other tastes are hints of chocolate, but for me this is dominated by nuts. That said, i think its a fairly tasty beer. Like the other offerings from Millstream, i think its uniqueness is enough of a reason for you to try this, besides that its not half bad either.","Tballz420","Dec 11, 2003"
3.82,-3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Hazy ruddy chestnut hue. Persistent, stiff, beige head leaves tattered lace. Stately, lightly buttery medium toffee along with hints of nutty carob upfront in aroma. Herbal hop tinge surfaces and fades quickly as the brew breathes. Simple and well rounded aromawise. Bready basemalt sweetness initially in flavor tightens into a more descript toasty dark Munich and soft caramel combination. Ashen hints of oily, lightly caramelized bland pecan persist as an undertone. Notes of dried cocoa emerge along with trace grainy sourness as it warms, but the latter is well understated and unobtrusive. Well calculated gentle hop presence partially offsets residual sweetness and leaves a floral kiss. A touch too lean in body, but with respectable dextrinous viscosity in mouthfeel. Finishes with an abrupt snap of rich, date like sweetness, but otherwise cleanly dry. A well brewed and balanced bock, that only falls a notch short in malt complexity and body. A fine example of a broad, yet underbrewed style. A nice change from the brewpub Maibock or Doppel. Highly drinkable and soft on the palate.","marc77","Dec 07, 2003"
3.55,-10.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a one-fingered white head that goes quickly and leaves no lace. Deep amber color. Moderate carbonation. Starts with a good mix of malt and hops, finishes on the dry and slightly hoppy side. Described as dark and chewy, its dark but only medium bodied. The ABV is 5.7%.","jdhilt","Nov 19, 2003"
