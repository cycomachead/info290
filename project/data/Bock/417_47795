The only thing that stops me from all 5s might be the bitter-dry character in the aftertaste. This keeps the beer from being as clean as it might be, and a better lager -- but if you're looking for a good example of the Traditional Bock style, this beer won't disappoint.","steveh","Feb 26, 2012"

Hops only serve to provide balance, which is good. This is definitely good. Not great, but good. Head to head against New Glarus bock, this would not compare.

3.88,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"August Schell Bock pours a big tan head over a deep amber/coffee colored brew. Active carbonation- lots of little bubbles. Nose is clean- toasty malts, pretzel maybe, and lager yeast. The flavor is very much like I remember their '08 Snowstorm was/is like- dark toasty malts and an herbal hop off the back. Maybe dialed back a bit- not so much rye as I remember, hop a tad more aggressive. Mouthfeel is light and clean, finishing dry dry dry. Nice. This is about as fast as Schell's moved one of their Snowstorms into regular year-round production- as of this writing (February '09), both Snowstorm and the new Bock are both in the shops. The only downside is the new Bock replaces their Caramel Bock, which I was quite fond of. But by all means, take the opportunity to compare 'em for yourself- there's some good solid stuff here!","shadow1961","Feb 14, 2009"

3.83,0.8,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Pours amber brown with an off white head that dissipates fast. Aroma is sweet and malty as expected from a d bock. Caramel with a light undertone of hops. Some roast in the aroma as well. Medium body with light carbonation. Hops come through in the finish with a slight bitterness which offsets the sweet malt profile nicely. Very drinkable, sessionable at that. I enjoy the nice hop bite on the finish. Good.","mbrasi","Feb 08, 2009"
3.92,3.2,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D-Nice drinkability. As a new addition to the Schell's line-up, I think this will be a success. It's got some nice bock characteristics, and it really left me wanting another one.","CHSLBrew","Feb 08, 2009"

4.4,15.8,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"The beer pours a clear deep ruby color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a quarter inch cap of foam. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is of caramel, toasty malt, and hints of spicy noble hops. The taste is full of malt. Lots of toasty roasted malt, caramel, and what seems like the most hops I've ever tasted in a bock. Don't get me wrong this is by no means a hoppy beer, but the hops are definitely detectable which is odd in a bock. It works here though, and really gives the beer a character all of its own. The mouthfeel is so smooth it makes me wonder if oats are involved. Carbonation is quite low. Overall, this is one fine bock that I'm sure will become a seasonal regularity for me, and it sure knocks the pants of Caramel Bock. It is great to see the continued improvement in Schell's beers that has been happening over the past couple years.","KarlHungus","Beers"
