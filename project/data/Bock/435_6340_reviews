"Not as good as it used to be"
"Has a caramel-like start, but the roast malts combine at the finish to almost give a tobacco flavor. Bought on recommendation because it was 9.99 for 12. Won't buy again."
"Overall: not so good"

"Overall, I didn't expect much and I wasn't wrong. My first drain pour."

"A rather plain and sketchy bock - the edginess just isn't there - and the slight off-flavours are thusly accentuated. Not altogether undrinkable, just wholly unremarkable for the style, once again."

"Pours with a cola color, 1 finger of head. Has a mild toasty, not burnt, aroma. A caramel flavor with some chocolate notes. It has a very smooth and bitter sweet finish. Probably one of the more drinkable bocks I have ever had. I have tried to find it again but must have been a one-off for my local store. A shame..."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a cola color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts, a hint of chocolate. Taste is the same, malty, chocolate, slightly sweet, not what I expected. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer, which considering the brewer, is saying a lot."
"The Crack revealed some brown foam that was eager to escape its metallic CANfines and I decided to unleash the beast. The aggro Glug got a fine cascading action going and I was CANtent to sit back and watch the show. This was actually starting to look like it might be drinkable! I had close to three fingers of dense, deep-tan head with great retention. Color was a deep-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Did somebody make a mistake and make an actual beer at that swill factory? Nose was rich with caramel and chocolate malts and although I am not into sweet beers, there was no way that I was going to dun them for it. Mouthfeel was medium-to full and the taste was milk chocolaty, very tasty, almost like a chocolate milkshake. Finish was likewise quite sweet, reducing its drinkability for me, but a minor point. This disappoints me in the same way that the beers that come out of the Sandlot at Coors Field disappoint me - if you are capable of making something decent, then why do you waste your time brewing rubbish? Color this one Worth a Try."

"A flavourful bock, could improve with some balance and more complexity as its fairly straightforward. Pretty tasty though, not sure I would recommend it highly."

"Poured out as a decent looking brown color with a light cream colored head on top. The head settles and leaves some light lacing on the glass. So far so good. The smell of the beer has a lager-like aroma mixed with some caramel malt aromas. The taste of the beer is decent but nothing exciting. The caramel notes in the flavor are dominated by the lager yeast spiciness. The mouthfeel was a little on the thin side on this beer. Overall this beer needs more malt, it needs to be sweeter and needs a stronger bitterness in the finish. There isn't enough body to this beer either, it's too watery for a bock style."

"Pours extremely dark brown to black, it is opaque and turns ruby when held to the light. There is a small off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly but leaves some light lacing down the glass. The aroma is sweet but tangy. There is a good bit of malt vinegar in the aroma and some dark roasted malt, with very light coffee and cocoa. The aroma actually reminds me quite a bit of some Scottish ales. The taste is a just-right sweetness, coffee, dark chocolate and very dark, dried fruit. This is a really nice beer."
"This beer pours a very deep amber color, with a slightly off white head. The aroma is fruity, which is unique for a bock beer. The taste is very fruity as well, with a slight caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium light, and I would consider this a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: A good well-balanced example of a Bock beer. very drinkable and I could easily session this beer when I'm in the mood for Bock's. A nice find in Wisconsin."
"D - Damn good beer! I thought that this was a lower-quality local thing, but I've very pleasantly surprised! I found a 12-pack of this for a song at a local joint, and I'm totally going back for more... can't pass up deals like these. Good beer at a good price is harder and harder to come by these days."
"It's better when it's a bit warmer, caramel malts come out. Fairly drinkable beer, was better than I expected."
"Fairly drinkable, but not overly interesting, and far from the style."
"Yack! I've had this lots over the years, but this time it got a major problem with butterscotch. I'll try to get around it, but it ain't easy. Served with a medium sized, off-white head and some lace. Color is a nice, not quite clear brown with dark red highlights. Aroma smacks me down wth that butterscotch - ugh. But, somewhere in there is some malt and a little chocolate, good malt. Flavor is BUTTERSCOTCH - BLAAAHH. Can't finish it. Draft lines are clean here too. No more, pleeeeze"
"I began to buy this beer years ago because of it's cheap price and also because I enjoy bock beers. Upon my first taste I was hooked. It became a regular beer of mine. I couldn't believe something this tasty could be so inexpensive. I felt I had stummbled upon something that the rest of the world didn't know about. While everyone else around me was gulping down Bud and Miller products, I was savoring this caramel colored, sweet brew made about 75 miles away from my town and I seemed to be the only one who knew about it. Then I began telling others about and they soon became converts. One day I asked one of these converts if they were still drinkling Huber Bock. He replied that he stopped buying it because it tore up his stomach. It wasn't long after that that I too began running to the bathroom after just drinking a few sips from one bottle. Then, one weekend I must of drank about 12 bottles and became deathly ill. I even began pissing blood.I had never gotten so sick off of beer before and I tried returning the remaining bottles to the store where I purchased them. I told the manager what had happened and he said I was the first person that he knew of that had tried to return beer. In conclusion, I would say to you that if you decide to drink Huber Bock, make sure there is a bathroom nearby with several rolls of t.p."
"This beer is a unique bock, but it fits all true bock standards. It has so many freaking flavors that it seems like a different beer as it warms, not just subtle variations. I taste: vanilla, toast, copper, all spice, caramel, smoke...I donno, there are a lot of flavor. The body is lighter as many bocks...very drinkable."
" The thing is, when I tasted it, it actually was pretty good! It had a very rich malty flavor, and very low hops which is what I like about this style. Also, since it was a little on the weaker side for a boch I thought it was a very drinkable beer. All in all, it's not bad for a mass produced boch beer, especially if your looking for a break from the super hoppy IPA's you've been drinking. It's definitely worth giving a try if you like this style- and can't to wait until the truly great Bochs get released. If you can give it a little bit of a ""gimmie"" for being mass produced, you'll enjoy it."
"Minhas Craft Brewery is responsible for some of the worst beer in America. Huber Bock, while not great, is actually one of their better efforts. Buy a single if you're curious."
"Poured into a pint glass this beer has a copper, slightly red transparent color with a slight cream colored head. This beer has a caramel nose with some slight malt after taste. The finish is a little on the syrupy side with an off bitter note to finish. Moderate carbonation helps balance the flavor. Not a big fan of bocks, but this is a decent beer."
"D: I don't know why people think this beer is merely worthy, it is solidly balanced and a good tasting easy drinker. An overall good beer."
"Not bad, but not great."
"A delicious display of malts with a proper counter balance of hops. A very good brew available throughout the year."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Pretty full bodied in the mouth, with a finish that leaves some roasty flavors in the mouth. Also warms a bit or presents warm flavors as it goes down. Perhaps a bit too high in carbonation for my tastes, tone it down just a bit perhaps. This is a brew I'd not be opposed to drinking again, though I would really like to try some others first. Not bad for the price, and of the other bocks I've had so far, Shiner and Berghoff, this is certainly better."
"drinkability is this brews strong poitn. mellow and creamy, a few of these would not be a problem. cheers!"
"This would be a great summer hot weather drinker outside on the deck - straight from the bottle, too."
"overall, this is a nice malt rich bock beer"
"D - This is a nice bock. One of the better offerings from the Huber/Minhas company."
"Mouthfeel was good; and I must say that this beer surprised me in a pleasant way."
"Medium-firm pour into a logoed (Gosser) .3 L Sahm mug produces plenty of frothy tan head, evidently moderate carbonation. Nice lacing, seems to fit the style. Color is a brilliant/clear red-burgundy. Nose is malty sweet and phenolic, with notes of honey and plum. Not truly one dimensional, a little more hop presence in here colud work wonders for it! Bittersweet on first sip, with the fruity and honey notes from the nose playing their cameo parts, along with some fresh apple notes working their way into the nasal passage. Smooth, easy-drinking and malt-driven, although a touch thin for the style. Roasty but not-quite-smokey malts, with a touch of oilyness, a nice bitterness, and a touch of brisk, cleansing carbonation on the tongue. Lighter body than I'd like for the style, but not lacking in flavor or style-specific characteristics. Some alcohol is present toward the end of the palate but rather than interfere it compliments the taste and drinkability. A longtime personal favorite of mine, and a very flavorful and drinkable beer at its retail price - per style it is by far a better value than many offerings from craftbreweries, microbreweries, and brewpubs. Normally the price of a brew doesn't affect my opinion of it, but with this one I've always been impressed that such a great-tasting bock could be so value-driven: woe betide the new owners should they ever get rid of this brew!"
"Pours like a decent porter with good lacing, nice white head when served warmer. Smell is of dark malts, clean but a little medicine like. Taste is crisp, being hoppy for a dark beer. Strong taste of roasted malt, but with a smooth finish. Overall, this drinks like a beer of a much higher price. Bold, yet refreshing. This sells for $6.99 a case in Minnesota."
"Average beer. The aroma and looks are nice, but it fails to life up where it counts the most, taste. Would be a nice beer to eat with a stronger flavored blue cheese. Try it if you want to see what a great beer is when watered down."
"Much better than many, many bocks from brew pubs and hoity-toity craft breweries."
"Drinkability: Not the worst beer I have had, maybe average vs. a style That I don't really care for."
"Thanks to jpm30 for this extra."
"Another failed attempt to make a great German Bock by a sub-par American brewer. The experience is more akin to an Irish Red with less cleanliness or crispness. The colors are a fine brown with less viscocity than expected and a non-withstanding head retention. Aromas are lightly malty per style with a twinge of fermentation sourness and graininess. The flavors are Irish Red in nature and lacking the deep, complex, tostedness, barley malt flavors. The alcohols add nothing to the beer. The texture is weak and tacky to the mouth. Finishes a watery sweet. It's not a badly brewed beer, but it's not true to style because of money-saving efforts by the brewer."
"They just got this in at my regular drinking establishment and they were kind enough to buy me one. While I am always pleased with new options this wasn't that exciting especially since it followed an optimator. While offering more malt and body than the hubers I've had before it fell somewhat short of what I consider a standard bock to be- almost as if someone cut a bock with a pilsenser. It was to expected though, and I would consider giving it a try again considering the price."
"Easy enoughto drink. Light bodied, a little thinner than I would like but still a decent bock."
"Less than average for style, but easily a satisfying session beer."
"Probably by far the best of the cheap bocks, but not anywhere near great. It pours a dark, but transparent color that resembles a flat cola with it's minimal carbonation and no head. It definitely smells malty, but not of sweet malts like most bocks, but of a dark roasted malt. The flavor is malty, but it has a bit too much hopping for a bock. That and it's thin, watery body make it a odd beer that I did not much care for at all, but it is cheap and will do in a pinch if Milwaukee's beast is the only other alternative."
"Pours dark caramel with a slowly dissapating tan head. The smell is all malt and so is the taste. It is a very straight forward bock, with caramel malt dominating and not muchh hops to speak of. It isn't a spectucular beer but I have a lot of respect for this long running regional."
"Picked up in another mixed six pack. Fairly simplistic beer. Pours a deep dark brown with a minimal off white head that vanishes in no time. Smell is very faint, almost non existent. What does pop up is some sweet malts. Taste is very... Well, I never thought that i'd describe a taste this way, but it is very watery. (btw the mouthfeel matches). There is a little bit of roasted sweetness to this though. I've had better in my days and I highly doubt that this will warrant a future pickup from me."
"Let's not beat around the bush here, you aren't buying Huber Bock instead of a bottle of Maudite. Huber Bock isn't a historic beer, but it wins its weightclass every time. When placed up against similarly priced beers, Huber Bock has the extra flavor and bite to push it over the edge. Not the best beer in the world, just one of the best cheap ass twelve pack beers around."
"I'm very impressed with the overall experience of this beer. Given the fact that I only paid $6.99 for a 12 pack, I almost feel like I'm stealing. This is a good beer for any budget!"
"Dark brown hue, thin and quickly diminishing head, a decent aroma of malts and some chocolate. Up front, rather thin, some caramel and roasted malty taste, yet they seem to diminish throughout. Some bready and toasty notes, yet they never develop. Finishes on the papery and rustic side. Very little flavoring or character, overall, just average."
"One of those beers where you don't really expect much, and a ""hey, not bad"" reaction is a surpirse. Poured a magnificent, rich mahogany color. Not a lot of aroma, and the flavor was rather muted, with some very faint roasted malt flavors. A fair bit of apple was present throughout the beer. I would have like the beer to have been more assertive in the roasted malt flavors, but it was quite pleasant."
"Maybe a tich sweeter than the Berghoff Bock but for all I know it's the same beer with different labels."
"Deep, clear, garnet. Slight beige head. In less than a minute, it becomes a slight beige collar that sticks around. Lacing is adequate. Aroma is good. Sweet, malty, fruitcakey and bready. This beer almost feels a little too carbonated in the mouth. Body is about medium. Taste is decent. A little yeasty. A little bready. A little sugary caramel goodness. Just a titch of molasses. All in all, a pretty average bock."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine to large light brown bubbles that left a fair lacing. It had an opaque black brown body that was more like a stout than a bock. Its medium strength malt and roasted caramel arroma was very nice indeed. Its palate was very smooth and it gad a plesant malt fore and after taste."
"This Bock poured a medium head with medium sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The lacing was good and the hue was brown. It had a moderately malty aroma to it and a fairly smooth flavor as well. The palate was light in body and the texture seemed to be a bit on the watery side."
"Clear reddish brown color with a refuge head of medium-sized bubbles. Incomplete and thin ring laces. Reserved aroma, barest sense of a burned diacetyl, almost like movie popcorn. Rather thin impression, tea-like, a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar on the tongue with a drawn-out and similar aftertaste. A little papery oxidation. Not particularly good, the rest of the case goes to the next party I go to. I'm not sure how this differs from the Berghoff Bock the company puts out at greater cost."
"At $12 a case, how can you complain? This is actually a good beer. Dark red-brown with a madium body. Poor head retention, but who cares at $0.50 a brew! Nice malty flavor, a hint of hops, and you can drink it all night. I got hooked at college (was even cheaper then), and now I grab a few cases everytime I'm in Milwaukee. Beats the heck out of any other beer in its price range."
