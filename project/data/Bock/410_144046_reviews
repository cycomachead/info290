"O- most people gave it such a low score but I actually find this to be a good chocolate bock.  I mean its not exceptional but definitely above average.  this would be good with some cake!!"

"Overall: With the exception of the artificial note in the chocolate, I would say that this is a great dessert beer - and even with it in, I'd still say that it can easily work as a super chocolatey and sweet dessert beer. I'll make a note to myself, ""this will compliment, rather than contrast, most sweet desserts"". And on that note, it's great. As a beer to drink, however, I feel it fails miserably. It's one-sided, it's overtly sweet, and it has an artificial character that distracts."
"Way to sweet for my taste..took about 5 sips before dumping it out....God awful"

"Had this beer twice, once on tap and could not drink it. Thought I would try it again in a bottle that was given to me, drank about a quarter of it and again had to dump it. Way to much chocolate for my taste. So much artificial flavor it's ridiculous."
"If you are looking to replace chocolate milk...drink this. A lot of artificial flavors."
"Overall this is not a complex beer but it is very sweet and chocolate lovers will appreciate it. Try it just to find out what it is like to drink liquid chocolate."
"Great if you are looking for something sweet."
"Tastes like imitation chocolate extract.  Sadly I bought a bottle before I tasted it on tap.  I never give beers back to the bartender but he got this one back.  Terrible."
"delivers on the chocolate. kind of thick though. i'd drink it again."
"O - an enjoyable beer, for one. Gets crazy cloying sweet.  Put in a lot more malt, throw it on nitro and it would be dynamite."

"Sweet mess of a beer. Way too sweet. I am only assuming used cheap flavorings and too much of them. Only could handle half a beer before pouring it out."

"This is not a typical bock by any means but it does offer a rich, chocolaty aroma and flavor which I enjoyed. It was definitely a dessert beer, an I don't think I would drink more than one at a time. Overall, it was a nice drinking experience."
"Tastes like a super sweet milk chocolate hershey's kiss, not my thing."

"This beer is terrible I would buy brooklyn black chocolate stour. I bought this because the guy in the store told me it was better than brooklyn not even close.This has a fake chocolate taste that is disgusting"
"This is very chocolatey and if you like that, then this will be very good to you.  Very tasty dessert beverage."

"Poured a dark caramel color with a hazelnut head. Aroma is overwhelmingly sweet with artificial chocolate notes. Taste is overly sweet and artificial, like Tootsie Roll or chocolate-flavored licorice. Mouthfeel is slick and syrupy. This ""beer"" (bottle says malt beverage) was so bad, I poured it out."

"This is from PITTSBURGH BREWING. It is damn good beer. NOT Penn Brewery.  Please pay attention to the BS you are posting."

"Overall if there was a good base bock underneath the artificial chocolate flavoring I might be able to hang with this...I'm not a fan!"

"Pretty Good, I little heavy and artificial on the flavoring . not on Par with Young's or even Brooklyn , but an ok sipping beer"
"Had a generous sample of this from my wife's pint at our local pourhouse. Very chocolatey, quite sweet. Both agreed that it would be an excellent 'dessert' beer, as in with some actual dessert consumption. I wouldn't drink a whole pint... not my cup, etc. However, it is what they said it is, and that is okay in my book!"
"Overall much better than their pumpkin ale they make which was pretty much pure candied cinnamon no pumpkin. This beer to me reminds me of a blend of Young's Chocolate stout and the body of Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock. Don't drink it if you don't like sweet beers."
"Thanks to HopFace for the opportunity to try this one.  12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint.  Pours a deep mahogany hue with a translucent clarity and a loose, 1/8th inch, tan-colored head that quickly disperses towards the edges.  Big dark chocolate notes on the nose followed by a hint of dark fruit.  Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a distinct, cloyingly sweet artificial sweetener character that really asserts itself and lingers between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation.  Overall, not a good beer - cloyingly sweet and not in a good way.  I may not be able to finish this one."
"The original review gets reduced a bit because i was rating it as a Stout not a Bock as it should have been."
