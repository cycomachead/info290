"Overall: Suprising beer but not necessarily true to style. Lighter feel and much sweeter than other bocks I've had in the past. Not by any means a bad beer and I will have it again. Just not what I expected from a bock."

"Dreaming - If they weren't constrained to the German Purity Laws. I wonder what a smoked version of this or a barrel aged version of this would yield."

"Overall: A spicy, sweet and clean bock with a light feel."

"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a dark red brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, earth, spice, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, cream, nutty, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty average brew. This one really seemed quite bland if I am honest. All of the right notes were there, but they seemed to just mix together rather than work in unison to enhance each other. Really disappointed in this one. I suggest you try it at least once, but I would stop at that if it were me."

"Overall, this is a pretty good beer that I would recommend others to try. It has more flavor than the traditional Red Oak."

"This is a fairly simple, one-dimensional beer. It is a nice twist on your usual bock, but there's very little to get excited about beyond that. It was good to try once, but I probably won't have it again."

"I picked this one because compared to Red Oak's other offerings, I thought it had the biggest taste/flavor."
"O - Great beer by a smal local brewer that is really doing it right it seems."
"Pours a moderate to deep brown color with a tan head. The nose brings some good roast characteristics as well as a bit of chocolate and coffee. The taste is quite roasty, especially for the style, but I think it works out here. Good body with solid dryness. Drinks fairly well. I'd never heard of them before but this was a decent brew."
"The beer pours a deep brown/near black color, minimal carbonation, and a small light brown head with very little retention (as I have seen as characteristic of most beers of its style) but overall a great appearance. Smells of deep dark chocolate, roasted malts, minimal alcohol notes, robust hops, and a dash of coffee. Taste of roasted malts with sweet chocolaty depth of a chocolate milk shake with some coffee undertones. Taste balanced with a touch of hop bitterness to offset the heavy sweetness. Mouthfeel is very thick (above the consistency of most beer) and very very smooth. With a normal ABV for its style it is going to be very strong for the modest beer drinker but perfect for those that believe in a good robust flavored beer."
"First of all, I can hardly believe that this is a bock beer. The tap was simply identified as Battlefield and I did not realize it was another local Red Oak offering. I thought for sure that this was a stout. Never had a bock that was this creamy and sweet. None-the-less, this is a thick dark brown color brew, poured at the Greensboro National golf course clubhouse, with a velvetty thick light brown/tan head and gobs of lacing. The aroma is chocolate milshake with a hint of sweet coffee and hop bitterness. The flavor is a little more coffee but not terribly bitter, more like coffee ice cream, smooth, somewhat aqueous, lightly carbonated. Very easy drinking, just enough tartness to make this sweet brew quite satisfying. Well done.definitely opens the window a bit where bock beers are concerned."
"Battlefield Bock is my first brew from Red Oak, and I'm looking forward to trying more. The beer in hand is medium in body with fine carbonation and a very easy drinker. Nice brew."
"Reminds of a Shwartz beer a little. I liked it better 2 years ago, something in the recipe has changed. Oh, here's the problem, the Battlefield Black turned into Battlefield Bock. Black pour, whitish head. Very smooth and drinkable. Dark chocolate, malt/molasses all very subtle, nothing jumps out. Could preobably drink quite a few of these. When I was in Germany, most of the beers were pretty tame, so all and all, this is not bad and representative of what I had there."
"I like this beer. Red Oak puts out some quality beers in my mind, and this one is quite the example."
"Not bad. I liked the flavors at work here for a Bock beer but I wish that the taste and body had given up a little more. Overall, this still drank pretty good and complimented our meal well."
"It is a drinkable beer that can be improved upon."
"Nice to see someone added this I had it a few weeks back at Backstreets here in Greensboro.Came to the table a deep dark brown with a thinner tan colore head atop,mainly chocolate malt aromas in the nose a bit of breadiness as well not much hop trace.Flavors also lean heavily in the chocolate category with some doughy notes and a light shot of spicey hop in the finish.Its pretty thin for the style in my mind the flavors are decent but all in all its pretty average."
