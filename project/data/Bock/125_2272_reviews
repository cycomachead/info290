"3.54/5: Viva la lager!"

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Appearence had all the right character. Solid, creamy head, a rich deep brown color & the lacing was moderate. The taste wasa nice shade of toasted malty goodness. The hops are used for balance not for reputation. All in a nice choice if you're so lucky."

"fantastic brew. becoming a fan of penn brewery."

"Rich and smoky, big flavor!  I get a lot of coffee and chocolate flavor.  Overall a very enjoyable beer."
""
""
"Creamy, roasty, with sweet toffee and hints of milk chocolate accompanying.  Full mouthfeel and spot on carbo guarantee this will not stay in your glass for long.  I bought this after a weekend of hop burnout, and what a great purchase it turned out to be...."

"Dark Lager, Mildly transparent.  Fizzy head that dissipates quickly leaving some light lacing down the glass.  Big toasted malty sweetness up front with with some spicy notes and minimal bitterness on the back end.  Really festive"

"Bottle from trade, and my first from Penn. pours dark brownish red, somewhat opaque, with some red shin fun through and an off white to khaki and creamy head. Aroma screams lager with sweet brown sugar, lager yeast, a little dirty, some dark fruit. Flavor is chocolate covered prunes with some brown sugar sweetness. A bit on the watery side in flavor but easy drinking with light plus mouthfeel and medium low carbonation. Acceptable brew and worth trying."
""
""
"M: The initial mouthfeel was bitter but smooth."
""
""
"O: I would buy a sixer of this without question - probably drink the whole thing in one night.... pretty damn good German-style brew, lusciously-moreish, fulfilling .... glad I finally came across a bottle - and it was in Philly, you'd think I would've crossed paths with one before, huh?"
"Overall, a very good bock style beer, great mouthfeel and clean flavors create a very drinkable beer."
"A nice malty Bock that stays traditional to the style. Easy drinking and smooth."

"Reminds me of Russian black bread. Great example of bock style from an American perspective. I like everything from Penn and this is no different. The consistency is the most enjoyable aspect of the winter beers. Wish that there were more of these in the variety case."
"A personal favorite for holiday ales. I drink over a dozen a year, I feel. Always available in my area, and standardly good. Especially, at my local dive bar."
""
"Pours a dark brown with a nice head and lingering lacing. Slight nose of dark malt sweetness. Light medium body and well carbonated. The balanced flavor of dark / roast malt is pleasant and only hints at sweetness. Smooth crisp finish aided by the carbonation. The roast malt is most evident on the finish and leaves a nice residual flavor."
""
""
"O-a solid bock with good flavor and easy drinkability"
""
"Notes: Penn Brewery has made this beer better in the past, and I have positively reviewed it. Maybe I had a bad batch."

"O: Certainly a good beer, but tame for style (versus European versions): a bock leaning towards an amber"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An enjoyable bock beer. Satisfying taste and mouthfeel. Easy to drink. Not too sweet or cloying."
"An interesting bock, decent flavor, and some ""Christmas"" spice to it compared to other bocks. I've had the stronger version of this beer as well and I prefer that, but this is pretty good too and I'd seek it out again."
""
""
"O: A really nice bock which is a great alternative to spiced winter warmers which I hate. Penn knocks another German lager style for at least a triple if not a homer."
""
"Having just had the Ayinger Celebrator a few days ago, it's pretty hard not to be a bit critical of this beer. While it has decent flavors, the beer is otherwise light, simple and fairly one dimensional. Not sure this is one I need to try again any time soon."
""
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ A pretty nice holiday brew. Not overly spiced and when combined with its roast and good level of carbonation and thickness made for a good easily holiday drinker."

"Overall, fairly one note. More malt complexity would really improve the experience. Somewhat weak."
"This isn't totally bad; I'll finish the bottle, but it's easily on the lesser side of average. It's merely forgettable."
""
""
"This is a fitting seasonal offering that I look forward to every time Christmas rolls around."
""
"Dark brown in color with reddish hues and good clarity. Poured with a very light brown, creamy foam that reduced to a soapy cap that left creamy sheets of lacing on the glass. Great aroma! Lightly roasted malt, chocolate malt and nutty aromas with a hint of coffee at the end. Creamy, light, delicate feel. Surprisingly light bodied. Roasted malt and toffee flavors up front, smooth chocolate thru the middle. Light ripe fruit flavors, a hint of burnt malt and a bit of bitter hoppiness at the finish. Lots of different flavors and aromas going on. This was much better than I expected it to be."

"Get by the smell and you have a near perfect example of an American styled Bock."
""
""
"Overall- I could never drink a whole 6 pack of this stuff, but one or two on a cold night does a body good."
""
"Overall: An ok holiday offering. I could certainly drink a six but for the price, I think I may pass. None of the flavors are overpowering and I think this beer could use a bit more ummph."
"O-doesn't quite stand up to the test of time. its actually a great bock, but it seems to taste more and more syrupy as i drink this. i'll admit that i've ordered this several times though. its definitely not a bad beer when options are limited."
"O: Overall I do enjoy this annually with friends and family, it has become tradition in this home for this holiday beer to be around. Thanks to the crew at the Penn Brewery for the great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: a very solid offering from a nice Pennsylvania brewery. Will go back to this one anytime again. Prost!"

"Quality Bock"

"Overall a very solid Bock, it doesn't reinvent the wheel but it rolls just fine, definitely hits the spot during the Holidays."
""
"D: a solid bock sampling from penn. very enjoyable brew with clean aromas/flavors. glad i picked this one up in my make-shift holiday/winter mix-six."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A winter classic. Very pleasant and easy to drink for a stronger bock."
""
""

"Overall - A solid bock beer here. Good blend of roasted malt and sugary fruitness."
"Enjoy this one in front of the fireplace and forget the rest of the night."
"Very tasty and enjoyable.I will drink this all nigh, but will have to watch the ABV does not sneak up on me. This beer gives me something to look foward to every Christmas season. A built in X-Mas gift for anyone looking to purchase something for me this holiday season. This is a must try for everybody. You need to try this Seasonal Christmas Superstar from Penn Brewery."

"O - Really enjoyed this older beer. Glad I got to try it from jlindros at his place. Aged very well considering the ABV."
"Overall pretty good, great aged soft malts, nice dark fruits, complex, aged well. Really hits the spot when looking for a good doppelbock style."
"Beer is medium in body and really smooth. Mildly malty but not overly sweet. Easy drinking, great mouthfeel. A really wonderful bock, truly so."
"Pours a clear tawny-brown color with an average, creamy tan head with good spotty lacing as it moves down the glass. The nose carries through some heavy malt character. Brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, molasses, toast, and a hint of a nutty character come through. The flavor hits hard on the brown sugar and molasses plus some bread. Light hop presence in the background. Flavor is moderately sweet and has an average length through the finish. Lit bitterness. Smooth and creamy medium body with light carbonation. Really a fantastic version of the style. Thanks again, Vince!"
"O: Very nice Bock, really easy to drink. Nice representation of the style."
"The nose is rich, bready and fruity. Rather like fruitcake with raisins, brown sugar, toffee and vanilla. I'm guessing there's some Munich malt here, it's got that intoxicatingly complex signature of this malt with a darker, more caramelized character. No hops are detected. The palate opens with a blend of burnt sugar, a little vanilla and a moderate fruitiness. Despite this, it doesn't really _taste_ too sweet, and my guess would be that the burnt sugar bitterness has something to do with it. The bready character I picked out on the nose isn't really noticeable on the palate, though there is plenty of malt complexity - brown sugar, burnt sugar, caramel, a little toffee and a little butterscotch too. Drying on the finish with some toffee and burnt sugar bitterness, this beer has a medium body and is rather excessively carbonated for my liking. Still, this is a great bock, though in many ways, it's closer to a dopplebock."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some very nice flavors to it and it doesn't hurt that it's one of my favorite styles. A pretty solid beer and was a great choice to drink while watching some football this afternoon."
"d. easy to drink. im not sure what my ""average"" 3 is... but its closer to ""not impressed"" territory. its not something i would pay for and be excited about. but, regardless, cheers!"
"EDIT: As I was rinsing out the bottle, I noticed a crescent of white residue on the bottom. I don't know if this had something to do with it not being up to snuff, but if it did, I'd hold the brewer accountable for that."
"Cola brown with a light beige head. Decent retention and lacing on the sides. Very clear but still opaque. Smell has notes of toffee and sweet roasted malts. Some banana tinged fruity yeast esters. A bit of plum wine. Mild earth. Taste had toffee and brown bread fused into a roasted grain coffee. Sweet fruity desserts with light spice. Coffee gets bigger toward the finish with a faint sweet alcohol flourish. A bit of sourness. Bitterness flows into tea leafiness and leaves a dry caramel graham with toasted biscuits. Feel is light and crisp with spot on carbonation. Super drinkable. This is a great winter beer but it is so good that anytime is a fine time for this brew. A real winner and something to seek out."
"This beer seems to be right on the style, which I am still acquiring a taste."
"taste was pretty good, not as 'big"" in the malt as I expected though. Hints of burnt sugar, fruts but seemed to be a bit thin on the mouthfeel"
"This is a nice seasonal bock, a very good Christmas beer."
"MD- A bit on the thin side for a bock. But everything else makes a very good bock. It goes down way to easy. It is a great thing that these guys are up and running agian."
"Overall though, I wish this was amped as I felt the malts were too muted. I was little let down on this but would have again. I definitely want to try St Niks cousin the ""Reserve"" to do a comparison."
"Color is very dark, even for a bock with a dark but not very carbonated head. Aroma is alcoholly but that's kind of what you'd expect from a bock. The flavor as well had some kick to it but also very well balanced with other flavors such as bread, raisons and yeast. The bar serves weaker beers in 16 oz glasses an stronger beers in 12 oz. Somehow, the st. nik made it into the former category. You can get drunk quickly on sixteen ounce glasses of this beer, which is very easy to drink."
"D - I liked this one over the private reserve since it has less body and more taste. Great overall beer!"
"I love this beer. It is unbelievably smooth and rich with just the right amount of tartness to keep it from being a chocolate smoothie! I love this beer so much that I find myself only having 1 or 2 at the most when I feel I am actually worthy of the reward. It is that good trust me. ""-) Makes winter here in Ohio a little more bearable!"
"I am not normaly a darker beer fan...but this is the bomb. Smooth with a roasted carmel sweetness, not too sweet, just right in my book. I dont have many other bocks to compare it with as most I've tried I didn't much care for. This brew is something special. Thanks to Tom Pastorius for bring the Penn Brewery back to greatness. This brew will make for a great holiday season! lol If you enjoy lagers that aren't pussy beers...try this, it just might surprise you."
"A tasty treat and a great switch from the plethora of winter warmers. Not that there are many German-style Bocks imported into the US; this one stands out the most with a true-to-style flair. Give this one a go."
"The beer pours a medium orangish-brown color with a white head. The aroma is toffee, grain and other malts. The flavor is lightly roasted malt, some alcohol and some lighter toffee malts. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. A clean tasting lager, but nothing really stands out."
"D: A good spice Christmas Beer."
"Worth a try..."
"My first beer from Penn Brewing. I actually bought this last christmas time, so it's been in my dark, cool closet. I'm not sure if it changed the taste any, but it was quite tasty. Had nice subtle hints of chocolate malt and slight hops. I was a little disappointed with the appearance. Not much to the head, died out pretty quickly. Can't really tell there's 7.5% in it, which could make it dangerous."
"Poured a nice dark brown color with a off white color head that gives way to decent lacing. The smell is of caramel malt, chocolate malt, and some dark fruits. The taste is of caramel and chocolate malt with a hint of some spice, it is a good taste, but it isn't as full and bodied as some other bocks. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Overall it is a very drinkable beer, the alcohol content is well hidden and the smell and appearance are very inviting."
"For Santa Claus to deliver presents to all the children of the world on Christmas Eve it is estimated that his sleigh must travel at a speed of 2,924,180 mph. That's pretty fast. But I'm not that impressed; I could probably finish off a glass of the St.Nikolaus Bock Bier at an equivalent speed. Speaking of which, this bottle did disappear awfully fast and a full case of this stuff would be a nice find under the tree... hint, hint."
"D - No, not at all."
"This flavor sticks with me for a while and isn't overpowering or biting. Very drinkable."
"D: Flavorful with a good complexity to it, goes down easily, not very filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for while if you're in the mood for the style."
"D - Could throw a few of these back, but not too many b/c of the ABV. You can't even begin to taste the high ABV, this brew is perfect."
"4.5 D"
"drinkability: good"
"Pours a clear, dark, ruby hued brown with a decent creme head. Nose is malty and leafy. Flavor brings the same. Consistent sweet tone that's not overdone. It's mostly a mix of the malts and that deep sugary tone. Feel is low on carbonation and slick and sticky on liquid. Quite easy to drink."
"Decent brew and easy drinking, but not one I'll look for again."
"D - pretty easy going down...not necessarily my favorite style, but still pretty good"
"single from Norm's, Vienna, VA"
"This holds its own not just as an exceptional domestic version of a style I hardly ever see from US breweries, but against the top German representatives in its class as well. Worth seeking out."
"D - Honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about this brew... Probably need another to reach a solid conclusion... There's a lot I like, but overall I'm not sure I'm overly impressed..."
"D - Very drinkable, and probably the best bock I'v ever had. Loads of flavor without being watery or too roasty as some bocks I've had."
"According to my notes, the biggest difference from this on tap Over the bottle are a slightly enhanced taste and look. The head sticks around much longer and while the tastes are mostly similar, the Christmas touch of honey and other spices are allowed a bit more room to show off. Mouthfeel and drinkability are still great, and smell is unfortunately still unremarkable."
"Highly drinkable for a beer of this ABV. I had many on New Years eve and never tired of them."
"drinkability - This is a real good beer, worth trying. Nice winter beer to try on a cold day. Lots of taste here."
"Although it is high in alcohol, you cannot taste it. Great beer. Clap Clap Clap."
"Pours a clear ruby brown color with a fairly small white head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is faint, I pick up some munich malt and a hint of red wine. The taste is of the bready/doughy munich malt, mineral water, and a nice lightly toasted grain. Quite a clean taste. Perhaps some red grapes in the end. The bock has a moderate body with crisp carbonation, nice malty sweetness, very easy on the palate. A highly drinkable bock, very clean and crisp, nice malt flavor. The 7.5ABV is nowhere to be found. Good brew."
"Dark mahogany color with a nice creamy head that leaves some drippy lace on the glass. Malty, bready aromas followed by some pale fruit and berries. Rich malty flavor...sweet berries, caramel, raisins. Clean and a little sticky. Medium bodied and smooth. Not bad...not the greatest bock in the world though."
"Overall a tasty and unique Christmas beer."
"I always liked the darker Bock beers than the lighter ones, and this one is a good example of the former. Recommended."
"12 oz bottle. Aroma is sweet with noticible alcohol not pleasant. Flavor is smooth with a partially clean finish. A little staleness in the finish. Malt dominates the flavor profile as expected for the style. I just think the finish can be a little better. After the undesirable aroma I was expecting an bad experience but the beer is actually quite drinkable."
"Tastes initially of sweet chocolate, but quickly finishes with a surprisingly assertive hop bitterness. The hallertau are quite noticeable and outweigh some of the more interesting and complex flavors imparted by the malts. The mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation provides a rich impact, but I would have hoped for something a bit more chewy for this style and beer. A little to strong on the hops in my eyes for the style, but its an enjoyable beer that would likely be improved when paired with some traditional German pork."
"D: Despite a slightly higher ABV, I could enjoy more than one in a sitting."
"Drinkability on this one is absolutely fantastic. I can put these back one after the other. I had no idea that this beer was 7.5 %ABV until I went to write this review. Hidden extremely well, not even a trace of alcohol."
"D- This is an awesome beer. I was able to finish two pints of it fairly quickly and i wanted more. One I will definitely be consuming more of this holiday season. Also the 7.50% is completely unnoticeable."
"D: Nice winter beer. The alcohol creeps up on you but the beer is something that I would order more of at a bar."
"Pours a very nice dark copper color, with some light coming through, with good head and some nice lacing. Nice malty scent, earthy, but not as deep and strong as I'd like. Excellent taste, very thick and smooth, a lot of malty goodness, a real earthy flavor with some nice caramel finishing. It goes down very well for a higher gravity beer. An excellent Christmas bock."
"It could just be that I was really in the mood for it, but I could drink this all winter. A nice malty step up from the Oktoberfests that got me through the past few months."
"The flavor has nicely caramelized malts which fades in sour cherries and a touch a hop backing. feels fresh and smooth in the mouth. Overall a very tasty beer I guess Ill have to look for another quality bock to try."
"D. Drinkability does very well despite the ABV. Worth checking out, I'm going to save one and revisit it later."
"D= very drinkable but modestly limited by the ABV for quantity. Also slightly heavy for quantity."
"Overall, this is one solid bock beer. Very easy to drink and very delicious!"
"Cheers!"
"A good bock, but sadly, not a great bock. A little light in my opinion."
"M/D: I got this for Christmas, its a great beer, very solid and delicious"
"Drinkability - nothing super, but an easy sixer to polish off."
"Pours a dark tea, extremely light coffee color. It is extremely clear and a nice amount of tan head soon descends into a trace along the side of the glass and surface. Aroma is pure malt: a good amount of caramel, toasted bread, pecans. No roasted malts are detected and no bitterness; along with no hops. A medium rich mouthfeel fills my mouth with even more complex malt flavors. A nice creaminess as well from the medium carbonation. I get a little bit of raisin and dark fruit flavor, coming from the malts, not esters, along with a slight floral spice from the hops and just enough bitterness to keep it balanced. Finish is extremely clean with a little sweetness but nothing cloying. Overall, my first of this style, and though I'm still a diehard hop head, a nice brew."
"D - all night, damn you!"
"Pours a murky dark amber hue with a one finger light khaki colored head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of scattered bubbles. Stickiness is thin, but there. Smell has a nutty characteristic with a bit of noble hops. Some dark fruits with a hint of faint chocolate malt and bready notes. Big metallic flavor up front followed by a sweet nutty malt. Some lager yeast and a nice toasted caramel sweetness. Light to medium body with a smooth creamy carbonation. Pretty shocked this one has a 7.5% abv. I really enjoy how this one goes down. I haven't had too many bocks, but this is definitely one of the better ones."
"Overall: Tasted good on a very cold winter's night, but really nothng spectacular."
"A very drinkable beer especially for the style, alcohol is hidden."
"D - A very smooth well crafted Bock that has such nice flavors w/ creamy textures and hides the abv well. A nice American Bock w/ a classic influence."
"Very drinkable beer. Goes down very easy. Really refreshing for a beer of this strength. Alcohol is not evident at all. A very sessionable bock beer. I wish I had another one of these because it would be very easy to down a couple of these."
"St. Nicholaus Bock Bier pours a mahogany color with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is malty. The flavor is mostly malty, but there is a bit of sourness at times and a bit of spice (most likely from the alcohol). Decent, but didn't blow me away."
"Pours a clear dark brown with slight ruby tone and a little white head. Smell is mostly dark fruits and breadiness with slight copper smell. Nice smooth taste with a bit of apple and darker fruits. Malts are there, and good lagery smooth finish. A bit thin in the mouthfeel. Nice and smooth and a fantastic session beer. Defenitely wish i could get this on tap somewhere to pound after work."
"The beer is nice and clean, but maybe thinned out a little over past year. Overall a solid beer though. I would buy it again."
"Mouth was lager. watery, not much of aftertaste with a quick wash. Taste , well, this was a brown ale more than a bock. Slightly toasted malt gave way to a slightly hoppy drink with a bitter edge, but nothing to wow me. Caramel was present. Maybe a rounded alcohol remainder. Okay drinker, but nothing I'll seek out."
"A very drinkable beer would seek after it again"
"A nice bock for the winter and it always brings about a smile for the holidays. Thanks for 20 years of brewing Penn!"
"d: Not a bad brew, but once and done for me."
"Solid and tasty brew that I would have again."
"D: very drinkable, mostly for the season obviously. Not outstanding, but it is a solid winter bock, that doesn't disappoint."
"Not much I can add to this that hasn't been said about any bock bier. A good representation of the style. Brown body with a decent head and good retention. Aroma of caramel malt and some roastiness in the taste. I didn't detect any spices that would ""qualify"" this as a Christmas beer/Winter Warmer. This was not too sweet and the ABV was hidden. I could have had another one during this sitting. A very drinkable beer."
"Thanks to MuenchnerKindl for the sample."
"I couldn't keep downing this, like most ""winter"" beers it is not designed for mass consumption, but one after Christmas dinner warms and relaxes the spirits."
"D- The alcohol wasn't noticeable, this beer is quiite drinkable."
"It holds a good head and is a nice deep amber in color. I have been feeding this beer to everyone I know. I'm sure there are more detailed reviews for this beer. All I know is that I love it and you should support this brewer!"
"Very drinkable; I must have had a dozen glasses that day, and it never got old! I enjoyed this beer a lot -- but unfortunately ran out of ice & am just trying to figure out how to cool the keg back down to have the last bit of it now :)"
"a mighty fine bock, but you should expect that of Penn Brewery. mellow hoppiness at first and a little more bitey on the finish, another great apres ski(or better yet snowboard) beer, and one of the many things i miss about pittsburgh this time of year, worth your while for certin"
"Clean, medium body, good malty flavor. Very easy to drink. I can't believe this is 7.5% ABV, as it is so well hidden. Very nice."
"Pours a clean copper/ amber color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, a roasty malt, caramel and a small chocolate note. In the taste, quite malty and some cocoa hints. A smooth, malty mouthfeel and a malty sweet cocoa aftertaste. Easy to drink, yet malty for some. A nice cocoa sweetness."
"Overall, this a very tasty beer and highly drinkable. A very nice Christmas brew."
"Quite good. Not the biggest malt fan, but this was very tasty. Just enough bitterness to contrast the overall sweet malt profile. Very drinkable, perhaps dangerously so with the ABV."
"This is a great beer from pennsyvania brewing. Pours a nice rich root beer color with a head that is about 1/2"" high. The aroma is very nice. It Gives off a sweet malt aroma with a slight roasted note. Taste is very full bodied with coffee/chocolate hints and some roasted character but not too much that it tastes burnt in any way. The hops balance everything out nicely. Balance is the key here as it has a lot going on but nothing dominates. The smoothness is incredible. Perfect mouthfeel...rich and full without being sticky or thick. This is the best bock beer I have ever enjoyed! This is a true Holiday treat."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a very dark brown color with a nice creamy light tan head with very good retention and lacing. The aroma is burnt and roasted malts, nuts and caramel. The taste is roasted malts, chocolate, hints of coffee flavors and some hops in the finish. Overall, this is one of the better bocks that I have had. This beer is very highly recommended."
"Overall: A fine example of a bock. Nice layered taste that is actually pretty enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium body and ample carbonation making it an easy to drink brew. Overall, this is a solid bock and I can appreciate it even though it's not one of my favorite styles. This is my first Penn Brewing beer and hopefully I'll have a chance to sample more in the future."
"Into a pint glass, pours a lovely, clear chestnut color with ample, fluffy off-white head with great staying power. The aroma ... well, kind of an oddity, lots of spices behind (or in front of?) a solid mass of maltiness, something like bread, an odd duck, but actually quite nice. The taste is also different, but well done. Sweet and toasty malts roll around the tongue for a bit before giving way to spices and a very mild alcohol warming, with the appearance of a fine carbonation keeping it lively, ending dry and bittering up as the mouth smooths out. Overall, its an interesting beer, and wasn't quite sure how I'd rate it. As it is, its an intelligent bock, an easy to drink beer, and one I'm very glad MuenchenerKindl sent me."
"Dark burgandy brown color, crystal clear, thinnest of heads. The smell was malty, sweet, and a little roasted-like. The flavor was richly malty but surprisingly bitter in the after-taste. Not bad, pretty good, I'll try it again this winter if it's available in OH."
"Drinkability: Yeah, I could dump back a six pack of this. Good, complex (but not too complex) palate and a light body. 7.5% ABV goes unnoticed (until the 3rd or 4th bottle, that is)."
"Thanks Joe! This stuff is worth buying a case of.Very tasty and a sipper for sure."
"Pours a clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little tan fizzy head, leaves some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is slightly roasted malts, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly bitter, with a dry finish. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad bock at that."
"cheers"
"Poured from a well-chilled 12 oz bottle. Deep brown or crimson with a bare whisper of a off-white foamy head that virtually disappeared after 10 seconds. Aroma? Not much ... a virtual whimper to the olfactory senses ... roasted barley, maybe a slight swirl of fresh pine. Thankfully, the flavor is more entertaining ... moderately robust with some dark cherry, bitter chocolate, and a bitter finish. Good. (#2724, 2/23/2007)"
"Poured beer from bottle to tumbler at 45 degrees which was too cold. Beer had a nice dark roasted color with a fine bubbly tan head. Roasted hop taste, light nutty slightly. Beer was lighter tasting than it looked. I though the beer was kinda flat tasting also but might just have been this bottle. Even though I did not give this beer a high rating, I believe I will try it again just to see."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass fridged to about 47 degrees, it pours a ruby colored body with copper tones throughout (maybe reverse that). The head is a solid surface layer of pale tan color that reduces itself to an oily surface layer with some slight cling on the edges. Bold and malty on the nose, some fruits come through to me right away (cherries) along with some chocolate aroma that basically reminds me of malty chocolate covered cherries, or of a Whitmans Cherry-filling chocolate square. Malty body on the sip followed along with some cherry flavor and chocholate that makes this seem like a nice dessert brew. Finish is slightly bitter and some hops even come through a bit. Sipping, the tip of my tongue tingles from the carbonation, but the alcohol hides in this one quite well at least until the finish and aftertaste, which sticks around a bit. Overall drinkability? Outstanding brew from Penn. I am not an overly-joyous fan of many of the offerings, but this one was great. The only thing hurting the drinkability of this one is the ""higher"" alcohol content, but who's counting??? Cheers!"
"Thanks, eclectic, for the opportunity"
"Poured a dark crimson color. Semi-opaque but still simmering in the light. A tan colored head develops but quickly dissipates and leaves some lacing and some big bubbles on the surface. Aromas of dark fruit, roasted grains, plums, and yeast. The alcohol and fruit flavors dominate. Sweet malt flavors come in a wave form; adding depth and interest to the beer. Slightly chewy and very bread-like in the finish. Enough sweetness to pair nicely with sweet dishes and still bitter enough to handle creamy sauces."
"Deep red, bordering on brown. Starts with a big, fluffy head. Aroma is alcohol and molasses. Taste is good, malty, alcohol is hidden, but there is a minerally taste to this beer. Must be the water? Carbonation is spot on for this beer. Mouthfeel is kind of thick, but that is to be expected, yet the alcohol and carbonation keep it balanced. Nice. Very drinkable. Thanks to Secret Santa and Imstillthegman for this one."
"I give this beer 4's straight down. I had this beer at a dive of a college bar was shocked they had it. I got a pitcher. Beer was a nice dark brown in appearance which a nice sweet malty smell that one would exepy from a bock. inital taste was nice sweet and balanced, also what i would expect from a well made bock. nice medium mouth feel all the way though, leading to make this beer nice and drinkable...i ended up drinking two pitchers of it and got cut off by the bartender for the night!"
"Pours a deep red to black color. Smell is fairly average. Price is good at $6.99 a sixer. Tastes like it has chestnuty brown to it with nice chocolate malts and a little hoppy backbone. More toward the sweet side and excellent winter brew that should be available year round. I recommend this one."
"Deep chestnut color. Off white, somewhat tan head. Malty, somewhat spicy aroma. Great, malty flavor. Slight hop bitterness. Has a soft, mellow spice flavor to it. Good, full body. Very, very drinkable brew. Wish I could have gotten this in years past."
"D - Dangerously drinkable, goes down easy for %7.50. Really good flavor. Im glad to see the locals stepping up with some great seasonals."
"12 oz bottle poured a dark amber color with small foam white head and nice lacing on the glass. Smell of sweet fruits, and malts make up a mouth watering scent. Taste is a nice blend of some sweet fruit malt and hop bitterness That taste like fresh cut grass smells in the finish. A medium feel in the mouth is not to heavy or light with a touch of carbonation on the tongue. This is definitely one of my favorite Penn brews and very easy to drink."
"Thanks for this one MuenchenerKindl."
"Drinkability/Notes. St Nick is different than most bocks that I've had before. Not as sweet as some bocks and has a distinctive roasted/burnt flavor and aroma that makes it interesting. The meld of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt plus the bitterness of the hallertau hops makes for a pretty well balanced, though malty beer. A cold weather sipper for sure, a beer to savor not just drink. Highly drinkable with the 7.5 % abv being hidden but noticeable on the face. Highly recommended, an interesting bock bier. Seek and enjoy."
"D: I like it. Nothing really mind blowing to me, but I could drink a couple of these and enjoy every bit of it."
"The beer poured into the glass very dark amber, with a gorgeous head that left a nice lace as it disappeared. In the smell I caught hints of roasted malt (as I expected) and a slightly fruity (hops?) odor that seemed a bit stronger than I had expected. The mouthfeel was thinner than I thought. The taste, however, was confusing. I hope that the complexity of the brew is the reason (and not a year's worth of sitting in a warehouse). It tasted not bitter, not tart, but something akin to sour. I didn't expect that. Perhaps that's what it should be (from the other reviews I've read that cite ""raisin"" or ""berry"" or ""fruit"" in the taste). Even so, no matter how good the product, I couldn't give this batch (or this bottle) a high rating. I'll amend when I find it fresh."
"Everybody need to try this Christmas jewel !!!!"
"This is my first Penn product and I am excited to try the others in the variety pack."
"Good mouthfeel, but a bit thinner than I thought it would be. Crisp, slightly dry finish. I find myself wanting to grab another one of these on this cool night. The Bigfoot I had first was a bit too much, but this seems just right."
"D: Very drinkable. The last time I had this beer, I was graduated from the Pennsylvania State University a whopping seven years ago (for anyone questioning it, the verb 'graduated' is correct in this sentence). It is as good as I remember and worth a purchase if you can find it."
"Cheers!"
"This experiment resulted in a beer that is arguably better than the fresher samples I've had."
"excellent mouthfeel, not oily, finishes with a nice dryness and crispness that leaves you wanting more. Highly sessionable, easy to drink. Just the right amount complexity in flavors and drinkability. The alcohol is balanced well in the beer."
"It might have been sprintime, but a winter beer like this would be welcome on my lips anytime. It's reasonably big, and quite malty, but it's also crisp and a joy to imbibe. The ABV is a warmer, and well integrated into the overal personality of the beer, meaning that does its part in maintaining a high quotient of drinkability. This is one brew that confirms that drinking a beer out of season should be pursued whenever possible."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head above the slightly cloudy dark amber brew. Frothy head lasts nicely, with lots of foamy lace. Aroma is creamy sweet malts, with dark fruits. Taste has a reasonable grain base, but seems to be more leaning towards the tart fruitiness than I would prefer. The tartness lingers, coupled with a somewhat chalky aftertaste. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pretty good, but I had higher hopes here."
"Merry Ho Ho to BeerBeing for this striking bock."
"Poured a cloudy reddish-brown color with an initial tannish head. Head rather quickly fell to a thin coating with only sparse lacing to be found. Smell is richly malt with a nice touch of cinnamon present. I usually do not like cinnamon, but in this beer it compliments the malt nicely.Taste is fruity, spicy, malty and supremely enjoyable.Leaves a nice full and fruity mouthfeel. This is one of the finest beers I have had in a long time. Even though i am drinking it a hot spring evening, it really hits the spor. I am sorry I only bought one of these."
"Thanks for the effort anyway, BeerBeing."
"I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever drink a bock that was more than minimally pleasant and ultimately forgettable. St. Nikolaus Bock replaces that wonder with a new one... the wonder of Christmas morning when the present that brings the greatest amount of joy comes from the least likely of places. A true holiday treasure."
"Thanks to beerbeing for this bottle."
"Dissappointing. I hope I have the opportunity to try another sample, as a solid bock can be real pleasure."
"Pours a dark brownish copper with a small, light tan, creamy, slowly diminishing head. Some nice spotty lacing. The smell dominated by malts, big and complex. The taste is also quite nicely big without being overbearing on the palate. Damn this stuff is good. A wonderful malt bomb and something I look forward every winter."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with roasted malts with a small amount of carbonation running along the tongue."
"D- This is a smooth nice lager that has good balance and nice roasted malt notes."
"An enjoyable and not overpowering Christmas beer. I'll look forward to it at Christmas' Yet To Come."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: This is perhaps Benji's favorite bock. He begs for more. Good boy."
"This was served to me at Bridgewaters Pub with a big, thick, foamy, deep-tan head. The Nose was verymalty with an almost chocolate-like sweetness. The color was a deep garnet or ruby red, so dark as to appear black until held up to the light. The mouthfeel initially struck me as too thin for a bock, and so I recommend letting it warm up some. Even then, it still came across as thin, but the flavors really came alive. The big tatse is caramel, but I also noted a fruity taste, like cherry, on the finish. Overall, it was okay, but I'd prefer something bigger and chewier for the holiday season."
"Ridiculously easy to drink."
"Overall: Another great beer from a great Brewery! Always a seasonal staple. With its great drinkability you can bring this to a nice holiday party and it will be enjoyed by all!"
"Overall this is another great seasonal beer by Penn. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a little warmth around the holidays! Cheers!"
"Drinkability: This made a nice well rounded winter beer that I could drink one after the another. I would do that, but I only have 5 bottles left. A must try for you Bock lovers! Keep up the good work Penn Brewing Company!"
"from the bottle. poured a dark brown, with a tan head. aroma, caramel, malt, some chocolate, hints of molasses. flavor dark fruits, cherries, raisins, brown sugar.this was a very enjoyable beer to drink, nice full mouthfeel, and after taste stayed around just long enough."
"This is a good representation of the style. Rich and complex with a sound malt base. I would buy a case of this."
"I sampled a 12 ounce bottle, that came with freshness dating notched onto the label. (month only unfortunatly) Pours dark honey brown, with a rich malty nose. Tan head, leaving some sticky lacing. Medium carbonation and also medium bodied. Sweet malty brew, notes of vanilla, cookies, caramel, toffee and bananas, Almond nut liquer in the back ground. Nice, smooth winter sipper."
"A 2 finger head resulted from a pouring of this ruby brown beer. Some carbonation rose to the top and contributed to the head which lasted throughout my sampling of this beer. The smell contained the scent of dark chocolate. At first this beer tasted sweet and then became bitter, and contained flavors of roasted malt and hints of coffee. The mouthfeel was good, but a little light. A good beer which I look forward to having again."
"A great brew. I'm still a bit baffled on the style and presentation: Bock, Doppelbock or ? Santa?"
"Creamy texture that is smooth on the initial taste and the finish. Tasted heavily of malt. I hihgly recommend it."
"Drinkability and Overall: I'd have to say this is my favorite of the Penn brews that I've had. Balanced yet complex, unique yet tasty. I think I'm going to pick up a case of this. This is one of the better Christmas beers I've had this year. Highly recommended - try it."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep ruby red color with two fingers of off-white head. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty, with candied plums, caramel apples, and ginger spice (no not the exiled spice girl). A hint of alcohol detected in the nose. The taste is also malty, not as sweet or as robust as the smell. Cherries and grapes linger a bit. Still some hops and alcohol present on the finish. The mouthfeel is thick, coating the tongue well, yet smooth. The drinkability is fairly good as well. A nice representation of the style."
"It may have been the night, but I wasn't as super impressed by this winter beer as everyone else seems to be. Appearance is a nice dark brown, ruby glowing sort of beer. I couldn't really get much happening in the nose area - may have been environmental. Taste was satisfying. Its a smooth and spicy beer with some tastes of over ripened fruit, and a strong saltiness to it. Once I started my second one, I liked it a bit better. To this beer's credit, it at least was properly spiced, which I can not say for this year's Samuel Adams winter brew."
"Thank you beergeek279."
"Very nice bock, and thanks to fellow felonious, Phil!"
"Pours with a decent finger-deep, off-white head of uniform, dense foam. Nice amount of carbonation; bubbles in streamers are rather separated but there are a lot of streamers. When held away from light, this is a very, very dark brown beer with rosewood highlights; when held to light it positively glows a shimmering translucent garnet... Aroma is of buttery Hallertau hops, a very buttery sensation throughout the nose itself; along with biscuits and bread there is a hint of raisiny sweetness. Flavor is very good, starting with a mellow caramel maltiness; this builds up to a plateau of warm spiciness, with suggestions of clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg that never goes over the top but remains extremely savory (never exceeding the bounds of drinkability); finally subsiding into a very delicate suggestion of hops at the back of the palate; this is balanced very well indeed. Mouthfeel includes a plucky carbonation but is a bit watery in the middle of the body, where I would prefer more assertion. This one is another winner from Penn when it comes to sheer drinkability, an outright chugger. If you find this beer... drink it!"
"Available on tap at Elwoods in Rural Ridge, Pa. 724-265-1181"
"Pours a deep brown with some nice reddish highlights showing thru with no head to speak of,arom is on the lighter side of almost buttery notes and some sweetness.A real chewy tasting brew with some caramel sweetness and some earthy unsweetened chocolate flavor that hits and lingers thru the finish,very appetizing.A nice full flavored beer to drink before bed."
"Prosit!"
"2003 bottling...dark reddish hued brown color, very attractive. Head is lightly yellow and rises to 1/2 an inch. Lacing is fine and intricate. Aroma is spicy and hoppy, granular pine-like hops combined with an overal cinnamon tone. Nice body for a Bock, fully medium with fruitcake maltiness, all the way down to walnut, holiday spices, and a sassy prickliness. Finishes strongly with moderate and pleasant aftertaste. This is a more recent brew than my days in Pittsburgh, but its very nice. I wish Schell would do this kind of Lager for the holidays, rather than straying into English-style Ale territory so much. Thanks to an old Pittsburgh bud, P. D. for the bottle."
"Probably the finest offering from Penn Brewery, and sadly only a holiday offering. A delicious beer, with a nice sweetness, and something I'll be having plenty of (considering I just got half a case)."
"Dense dark brown body with red highlights when held up against the light. Pale colored and medium sized head with decent carbonation. Little to no lace left on the glass. Sweet aroma and dominant malt taste with a hint of sourness. No hop bitterness whatsoever. A nice enhancement to the flavor is achieved with a small helping of spices appropriate for the season. Smooth velvety mouthfeel. Very yummy indeed. Thanks Weissenheimer for putting this one in the package. This is my first taste of a bock, and IÂ’ll be back for more. IÂ’ll also try to sample more of the offerings of this brewery when I get around to Pittsburgh."
"Pours a nice chocolate brown color with a thinner, soapy tan head. Good lacing. Has that nice funky bock yeast smell as well as some bready dark malt notes and a fair distinction of German hops. Rather rich and smooth, the malt profile of this beer is very nice; earthy and caramelly. I love bocks and this brewery's beers seem a little underappreciated, but they are pretty much right on target with their German replications."
"I'm somewhat taken aback by the first sip because it's spicier than the bottled version. The flavor carries a well-balance blend of molasses, caramel, hops, and spices. None of those elements truly wins out over any of the others and this makes it quite drinkable. It's more challenging than the Harpoon Winter Warmer but, as I make my way through the pint, I find myself welcoming the challenge more and more. I described the bottled version of this beer as ""a wimpy version of Rogue Santa's Private Reserve," but this seems like its own animal. The spices and hops are more unified here than in the Santa's, and once I get used to the hops it feels smoother. Overall I'd characterize the taste as brown; molasses, caramel, and a tiny bit of nuttiness pair up with the distinct hoppy character in a way that grows on me and leaves me wanting to try this again."
"Nice to see this on draught, as I'd never seen it before in any form. Chestnut colored body with no head, though this could have been due to a not-so-great- pour. Ah well. Slightly spicy aroma, bread, and alcohol in the nose as well. Flavor begins on the sweet side, but not a thick sweetness...more like a brown sugar kind of sweet. Big malt profile in the middle, a toasty, lightly bitter maltiness. Finishes slightly dry with a good smack of alcohol. An interesting winter seasonal. Nice to see a brewery doing something that not everyone else does for their winter seasonal."
"Appearance: This local favorite christmas brew pours a perfect toasted crimson brown hue with a nice silky smooth tan nice sized head, leaving behind specks of lacing. Aroma: Spieces, toasted nuts, with a great Hallertau hop aroma going down, malty and rich smelling definitely a warming bock bier. Taste: Carmel malt sweetness with toasted nuts and a nice bitterness from the hops tames the barrage of sweet malt and festive spices. Mouthfeel: Medium to light in body mild carbonation just a bit spritzy. Drinkability: Classic by all means when referring to a local christmas bock beer, in the Burgh."
"Prost!"
"A rough pour delivers a slightly hazy mahogany body with a reddish-orange cast and a tall, foamy, light-tan head. It drops quite a bit at first, but maintains a pretty solid quarter inch of creamy foam that looks almost like a milkshake and leaves some nice spotty lace. The nose is lightly spicy from alcohol, and possibly hops, but it doesn't seem that any actual spice has been added. A dark, sugary caramel malt rounds out the aroma. Its medium body teams with a very fine and moderate carbonation to leave it creamy, smooth, and very drinkable. The flavor starts with a gently sweet, toasty and caramelized maltiness up-front; followed by a touch of light spiciness before finishing with some subdued bitterness and drying alcohol. It's quite a refined winter seasonal, and certainly not a hit-you-over-the-head beer. It's uncommon deeply-caramelized and almost-burnt-sugar maltiness combined with its subtle spiciness keeps it interesting - but never really satiates. In fact, it's far from overwhelming the palate and leaves you wanting more! A welcome winter specialty that can be enjoyed with a meal or on its own."
"First time I've tried this, and it's well up into my top 10 holiday brews."
"ABV: 8.4% per the book ""Best American Beers""."
"Had on tap at D's..A friend who works there told me that Penn only bottles this one weekend a year, which is a shame because this is one hell of a beer. Pour a slightly tan head on top of a dark body. Slightly spicy and malty-sweety. Gives a nice warm feeling and has a noticeable alcohol taste. Not overly spicy like anchor's our special but yet has a that slightly spiced taste you'd expect from a christmas beer. Finishes smoothly leaving the drinker asking for another."
"Smooth, flavorful take on the bock style. Pours a dark gold with an off white head. Nose is of sweet malts and a whiff of alcohol. Deep, full bodied taste with plenty of caramel and toasted grain. Background of German hops and a warming alcohol kick keep this sweet brew on track. Really drinkable brew for the holidays. As others have said not spicy, but strong and malty for the cold weather."
"This dark brown beer pours with a thin, tan head that is very creamy and leaves a nice lice on the glass. The aroma is primarily malt, with a touch of spiciness. The taste is strong on roasted flavors, with a touch of sweetness and nuttiness. Nice hop bittering on the finish cleans the palate. This beer is creamy on the tongue, with just a touch of alcohol. This beer finishes rather clean, and is very appetizing. It would be easy to knock back a few of these in short order. Another great brew from an oft overlooked brewery."
