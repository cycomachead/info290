"Bock pours a dark amber color with a big lacing head.  There is a grainy aroma filled with adjuncts.  The taste is sweet, malty, with a hint of sourness.  Decent body, a little watery flavor.  Overall its a very okay beer, very plain, and a bit too sweet."

"Overall : sign me up for more, this Bock rocks!"

"Overall:  Excellent.  I think this is Schell's best offering (except for the sadly departed Emerald Rye).   There aren't a lot of quality American bocks that I have access to, but this will do nicely.  I look forward to it every year as much as I look forward to just about any other beer."
"Not too strong, but sort-of an all day sipper."

"drinking bock.    This was definitely much better than I was expecting."

"Pours a deep amber in color with a good finger of a off-white head that settles back down to just along the sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of sweet malts and caramel for the most part. The taste has even more going on with the sweet & caramel malts coming together nicely with a hint of spice. Goes down very easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Perfect carbonation. A great brew!"

"This is pretty nice, it's very toasted-malt-forward, and I like that. Slight hop spice, and not too sweet. And, of course, it has that velvety smooth German lager mouthfeel."

"A decent tasting Bock, maybe just a tad on the wettish lighter feel, but definitely worth drinking."

"Notes: Very nice bock that grew on me as I sipped it. The flavors balance each other out quite nicely. It is easy to drink and is very nice and enjoyable while being simple and easy to drink leisurely. Worth a shot."
"O: Not a bad bock at all. Could really get into this come autumn. Cheers Aaron!"

"O=A nice example of a bock, except sweeter than most."
""
""
""
""
""
"A superior example of the style, well crafted, flavorful and balanced."
""
"Overall a very solid beer, good for the season. I think I'll have another."
"Summation: A decent MN variant of bock style beer. Not anything over the top, but yet satisfactory for it's price and purpose. Perfect for when you have that bock craving. Comes in 12 packs during the spring."
"O: A nice mellow bock, that almost feels like a nut brown."
""
""
""
"O -- Schell pretty much nails the style with this beer. No roastiness or overly-bitter hopping, just rich Munich and/or Vienna malts. The only thing that stops me from all 5s might be the bitter-dry character in the aftertaste. This keeps the beer from being as clean as it might be, and a better lager -- but if you're looking for a good example of the Traditional Bock style, this beer won't disappoint."
"M. Smooth medium bodied with a hint of oiliness, but carbonated just well enough to counter balance it. Still, it could have used a slightly higher level of carbonation to lighten it up a bit."
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied with slightly below medium-level carbonation. Resultant mouthfeel is clean and somewhat crisp, generally smooth flowing. The lower carbonation actually fits this beer, as it is something to roll around on the palate and not drink quickly."

"O: This is such a nice American version of the German style; true to style and so malty and warming and tasty--bring on spring"
""

"The aroma was your classic malty bock. Nice sweet caramel and nutty aromas mixed in with a good earthy tone. The flavor followed through very closely with a nice bitter malty flavor and a good amount of sweetness in it as well. Carbonation that is more then decent never let it go flat and kept you entertained throughout the session"
""
""
"Overall: One thing Schell has going for itself is the ability to master the mouthfeel. The level of carbonation couldn't get any better, it perfectly reveals the flavor of the beer and allows for a great glass anytime."
"O- A pretty good American made bock. Enjoyable and worth trying."
"O - Really liked it. I usually pass over Schell but I threw this one in a mixer. Glad I did!"
"Sk√ÖL!"
"nice white head, decent earthy hop smell, watery but smooth malt profile, nice carbonation hides the alcohol well. tangy yet sweet brings a complexity that isn't in the standard bock solid beer overall great for the price. enjoy"
"Overall: A pretty decent bock."
"Mouthfeel os well balanced. Could benefit from an even lower ABV to make this good beer truly sessionable."
"IHad this at bockfeast in New Ulm.Pours amber brown with an off white head that dissipates fast. Aroma is sweet and malty as expected from a d bock. Caramel with a light undertone of hops. Some roast in the aroma as well. Medium body with light carbonation. Hops come through in the finish with a slight bitterness which offsets the sweet malt profile nicely. Very drinkable, sessionable at that. I enjoy the nice hop bite on the finish. Good."
"Goes down easy, but I find this one to be relatively blah. It's a bit too one dimensional and lacks the malt complexity to keep me interested. It's also not tasty enough to be an easy-drinking, sessionable bock. Not bad, but falls flat in my opinion."
"D: A fine bock. This is one of my favorite styles and this beer is a reason why. Definitely not the best bock I've had, but definitely one of the better ones. I will look forward to this every year."
"D: Classic bock. For the style, I would consider a 5 but my vote here is only 4 just because this beer is a little un-nuanced/basic. Nice beer, though."
"I can't recall ever liking Schell's Bock this much. Next up, let's see some magic done on the Doppelbock."
"D- worth it. If enjoyed, it cannot be drunk fast and with vigor."
""
"Notes: Don't think I would buy this one again. Nothing terribly great and I didnt think they did a great job on this one."
"Try this bock if you haven't already, and then thank Herman the German for New Ulm and the great Schell Brewery"
"M/D - Medium bodied, sweet caramel taste with a slight citrus aftertaste. A really great tasting bock, a really good mix of sweetness and malts, another must try from Schell's. I recommend you try this brew if you can still find it"
"Good beer from a good old american-german brewery."
"Drinkability: Low. A few sips of this stuff, and I feel full and my mouth feels saturated with unwanted sweet."
"D - Easy drinking. ABV is potent, but manageable. Moderately filling due to its carbonation. Flavors are light, not overwhelming. Seems sessionable."
"Drinkability: Fantastic Bock that even rivals many Doppelbocks in terms of its malty punch. One of the very few German-style Bocks around with its pure barley malts (no wheat, adjuncts or spices) and its original gravity of 16+."
"Nice bock. Pleasantly surprised."
"D - This is a pretty nice bock. Yet another good German-style brew from August Schell."
"The aroma has nice caramel and toffee tones, some toasty and faint hoppy notes too. Taste is similarly centered on sweet malt, caramel, toffee, some toastiness, some hops. The body is medium full, good carbonation, and it dries up toward the end. In all, an enjoyable enough beer to drink, doesn't quite stand up to the great ones, but is quite drinkable nonetheless."
"Conclusion: Simple, tasty, awesome bock...better than the Caramel Bock it replaced for sure"
"Drinks easy, a pretty nice bock, hides the ABV fairly well"
"This is a pretty good beer other than the flat appearance. Good flavor profile with plenty going on."
"God damn Schell's is awesome. I need this brewery to start distributing here ASAP. So far the only American brewery that I feel can consistently make every German style up to German standards. Try this for sure."
"Overall: Good drinkability, good roasted flavors, the smell is much sweeter than the flavor. Nice representation of the style!!"
"Very easy to drink, very sessionable."
"Thanks again to Br3wmeister for a chance to enjoy this Minnesota brew!"
"This bock has a rich caramel color with a nice fluffy tan head. Has a toasty and nutty character to the aroma. It is full of caramel and grains. It has a slight floral hop finish. Smooth and clean feel to it and it really goes down good. I am impressed by this beer."
"This is a very nice beer from a local brewer. I would have again."
"pours out a clear dark mahoghany colour with a thin and sticky light tan head. wisps of lace. sweet malty aroma, a hint of fruitcake and molassees. taste is all malty goodness, not sweet at all...some burnt sugar and rum notes with a ghostly ripe red fruitiness. it has some bittering for balance so the hopping never interferes with the straight laced malts. no alcohol detected. tastes solid and malty like a good bock should. the body is balanced and full for the style with a crisp and semi creamy mouthfeel. drinkability is outstanding because it has a refreshing quality with a degree of flavourfulness that balances nicely. solid beer and recommended to try if you get the chance."
"Drinkability - very drinkable. I recommend this highly."
"Looks the part. Perfectly clear rich mahogany tone sets the pace. Thin beige head leaves moderate amounts of lace as I drink. Decent aroma of some caramel malty goodness with a little molasses sprinkled into the nose. Flavor base is solid. Fairly rich with the malt. Pretty clean. Malty without being sweet. Hops only serve to provide balance, which is good. This is definitely good. Not great, but good. Head to head against New Glarus bock, this would not compare. But hey, that beer is out of their rotation now so this one will definitely do if I'm craving bock."
"Overall, this is a great beer. I am not the biggest bock fan, but this one has heavily impressed me. Very easy to drink, a lot of flavor, and just a great overall value. I highly recommend."
"D-One of the best new beers (if not the best) to hit the shelves from a Minnesota brewer this year. Definitely not the same as this years snowstorm. That was awesome too but had a much different overall flavor. This is as true of a bock as I've had in awhile...so many breweries label any dark lager a bock when it isn't...this is a true bock and dare I say a Minnesota classic....best regional bock I have had....New Glarus is close but this takes top prize...I'm pumped about this new beer."
"D= pretty decent. Ill prolly drink a lot of these this spring for the price and the smooth regular taste."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with nice caramel notes. The taste is sweet, malty, nice caramel touch. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew."
"Drinkability is high. Great flavors on this bock and definitely easy to consume. I'd be willing to keep this around in 6 packs."
"Pours a dark amber color with a large tan head that has excellant retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Strong caramel malt aroma with hints of dark fruit and maybe nuts. Starts off with a sweet flavor of caramel but there is a nice hop bitterness to balance the flavor. Has a nice dry finish. I think this is even better than Snowstorm '08. Medium body but it seems to be a touch overcarbonated. This is a nice bock and a big improvement over the old Caramel Bock. One of the best bocks out there today."
"August Schell Bock pours a big tan head over a deep amber/coffee colored brew. Active carbonation- lots of little bubbles. Nose is clean- toasty malts, pretzel maybe, and lager yeast. The flavor is very much like I remember their '08 Snowstorm was/is like- dark toasty malts and an herbal hop off the back. Maybe dialed back a bit- not so much rye as I remember, hop a tad more aggressive. Mouthfeel is light and clean, finishing dry dry dry. Nice. This is about as fast as Schell's moved one of their Snowstorms into regular year-round production- as of this writing (February '09), both Snowstorm and the new Bock are both in the shops. The only downside is the new Bock replaces their Caramel Bock, which I was quite fond of. But by all means, take the opportunity to compare 'em for yourself- there's some good solid stuff here!"
"D: Big time. I can empty a few of these! One of the most solid BOCKS I have had. Nice. Man, I wish I had another snowstorm 2008 to do a side by side."
"This is a great bock with great complexity but still extremely drinkable. I really enjoyed this one."
"Pours amber brown with an off white head that dissipates fast. Aroma is sweet and malty as expected from a d bock. Caramel with a light undertone of hops. Some roast in the aroma as well. Medium body with light carbonation. Hops come through in the finish with a slight bitterness which offsets the sweet malt profile nicely. Very drinkable, sessionable at that. I enjoy the nice hop bite on the finish. Good."
"D-Nice drinkability. As a new addition to the Schell's line-up, I think this will be a success. It's got some nice bock characteristics, and it really left me wanting another one."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall- This is a pretty good bock, I am glad I picked it up."
"Drinkability is excellent. I will be buying this one again."
"I really missed this beer, glad they brought it back. For how long, I'm not sure, so I guess I'll stock up."
"The beer pours a clear deep ruby color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a quarter inch cap of foam. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is of caramel, toasty malt, and hints of spicy noble hops. The taste is full of malt. Lots of toasty roasted malt, caramel, and what seems like the most hops I've ever tasted in a bock. Don't get me wrong this is by no means a hoppy beer, but the hops are definitely detectable which is odd in a bock. It works here though, and really gives the beer a character all of its own. The mouthfeel is so smooth it makes me wonder if oats are involved. Carbonation is quite low. Overall, this is one fine bock that I'm sure will become a seasonal regularity for me, and it sure knocks the pants of Caramel Bock. It is great to see the continued improvement in Schell's beers that has been happening over the past couple years."
"Bravo to the brewers and brewery for two exceptional, very well done, malty complex lagers."
