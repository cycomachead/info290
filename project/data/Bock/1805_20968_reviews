"o: A good bock, drinkable and seems pretty true to the style. Unclear what its age might have done for or against it, my guess would be not much,."

"The taste tends to favor the nutty side more than the malty side with a slightly bitter finish."

"The beer is full of nutty vanilla and toffee aromas. It pours a deep cloudy amber color, with minimal head that dissipates quickly. Medium sweetness up front and a lightly bitter finish. It has medium body a thin feel and soft carbonation. It is kind of weird to be drinking a Vermont Christmas beer in Hawaii during February but it paired well with some sharp Vermont Cheddar and definitely hit the spot."

"O: Nothing unusual given the style, nice fragrance and flavors, smooth as well, but I'm not blown away"
"Overall meh, nice dark brown toasty malts and reddish copper malts, lots of sweeteners that aren't too bad, caramel, molasses, toffee, brown sugar, etc... light earthy bitterness... but overall just seems a bit lackluster, not enough carbonation, a bit too sweet, etc."
"O: A bit of a letdown from the awesome nose. Thinner than I'd expect from a bock, and not as flavorful as I would have liked."
"A dark, dark mohogany colored brew with a fair tan head that almost instantly disappears completely with no lacing. The nose picks up light licorice malt with roasted coffee beans. Very definite and likeable. The flavor brings an extra spruce hop edge over more coffee bitterness. It’s medium bodied with a slight chalkiness over an otherwise aqueous brew with very fine carbonation. This was frankly a shocker because of the holiday label and such an un-holiday brew. It’s a very solid bock but I have to say this was a poor choice of label."
"Overall I think Rock Art should chill on the claims they make about their beers. They hype them up SO much on the bottles and then dont really deliver with the actual product (ie: this beer was ot rich or creamy). Ive had 3 or 4 of their beers now, all totally different styles and I feel this way about each of them. Not an awful beer in general but definitely not what I was lead to believe itd be."
"O - not a bad beer, but nothing more than average on most aspects. this is definitely a once a year drink only."
"Thanks to DrewShal9 for this one!"
""
"Overall, not a terrible brew. About or slightly above average for a Bock. I would take it or leave it with this beer. I won't be seeking this again but if this was all they had, I wouldn't mind drinking it."

"When I think ""Mountain Holidays in Vermont," my gut reaction is ""there is too much f---ing snow for me to drive up to Vermont!"" Despite this association, I liked this beer. Rock Art definitely brews better beers, though. It's worth a try."
"I thought I once had an earlier vintage of this (as opposed to this 2010 bottle) which was pretty good...this was a rare total letdown from Rock Art. While it didn't ruin Christmas in July, I wouldn't want another bottle like this one...will certainly this coming year's vintage, though. Imbibed 7/13/11 in my Pike pint glass."
"Overall, this is a very easy drinking beer. It's incredibly creamy and smooth and fits the style well."
"O: ""Crowd pleaser"" as described at the brewery. Thoroughly enjoyable and I could/would drink the shit out of this in any season."
"This is a really tasty bock with a lot going on. More complex than most bocks but probably sacrifices a bit of drinkability."
"For me, the bitterness from the dark roasted grains is just too much. It was worth a try, but I think I will just pass on it next time."
"D: Eh. The hop is a bit too strong and stand-offish for my taste, it doesn't mesh with the body at all."
"D- This is drinkable alright but I think they need to accentuate either the maltiness or the spiciness of this beer. As it stands neither are strong enough, it needs some dominance."
"2010 Vintage"
"Pours cream, three-finger head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Hazy brown/amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose - hints of spice and malt, flavor is same - spicy malts. 2010 release, $5.50 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Light tan with a pretty sizable white head. Some nuttiness on the aroma, but also doughy. Taste moves towards vanilla as well. Medium to light body with a balanced, tending towards sweet but balanced finish. As the bottle suggests, try this with a nice (VT) cheese."
"Aromas are malty, slight cocoa and roastiness, with a bunch of toffees/caramels and some lighter dark fruits (cherry and fig mainly). The taste follows suit with a lovely molasses and toffee from the malts, some brown sugar notes. Some earthy bitterness in the finish as well from the hops. Interesting and pleasant throughout. Some lighter vanilla and dark fruits emerge as it warms but not in any substantial manner. Fairly light tasting to be honest; mouthfeel should be a bit thicker for this style in my opinion, but considering I think this is only around 6 ABV it makes sense. A decent offering but not one I will be revisting anytime soon just because it is quite average overall."
"D- Moderate. Enjoyable, but nothing stand-out. Would prob. skip this for something else given the price."
"Not that drinkable. Nice label, though."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a hazy mahogany with a big fluffy head with pretty good lacing. Big biscut malty aroma. Super mild malty flavor with a slight bitter after taste. Very disappointed by the lack of flavor in this brew. Maybe the name of it just raised my expectations on this one. Left a tingle in my tongue."
"D - I don't know the ABV, but it goes down easy enough, and the flavors aren't palate killers in general."
"Pours a nice brownish color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger creamy/foamy off-white head, with some small islands and sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, roasty, with some toffee/caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, roasty, bitter, toffee/caramel notes. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty brew."
"D) A nice Bock. Pour me another!"
"Rock Art is an unassuming brewery that continues to gain a reputation for their quality craft brews. Unfortunately, their size ensures a limited distribution area - thus depriving many beer lovers of a chance to enjoy these fine beers. Rock Art is definitely worth a stop."
"Drinkability: rather easy to quaff but a bit too crisp for me. Nice flavors overall."
"Very interesting taste, something here is different. Not sure if it's spruce or something, but there's a bit of a holiday spice to it. I can't get it on the nose but honestly this is about the perfect holiday beer! Easy to drink, tasty and the subtle holiday hint!"
"This is an odd brew. Doesn't quite ""sit right"" yet has a certain ""drinkability"" to it. Mixed feelings here."
"This is a very nice Christmas eve beer. A lovely caramel with a thick off white head. Very nice retention and great wads of lace stuck to the glass. Smell is light sweet malt with a big earthy hops. A touch of smoke and light breadiness. Taste follows suit with a lovely molasses and toffee in the malt. Alcohol peeks out here and thee but is very well integrated and delicious. Dry and malty finish. Somewhat chewy with an effervescence that flow into a light creaminess. Quite drinkable and I wish I had another for the night and Christmas dinner too. Thanks to The Rowan for a Vermont gem."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer overall, but there are other beers in the style and other Christmas seasonal beers that I would pick first."
"1198"
"I haven't seen this around before, so i decided to give it a try. Hazy reddish brown color, cream colored one finger head. lots of foamy lacing. looks good! Smells like sweet bisquity malts with a hint of bitter hops. rich, bready, malty taste. spicy hops, mild bitterness. very fruity aftertaste. very smooth, creamy mouthfeel, low carbonation. not bad overall, that smooth silky mouthfeel is great. something about that sweet, fruity, bitter aftertaste doesn't do anything for me. I'll try it again next year."
"A very balanced, drinkable brew. Quite enjoyable on a cold winter night."
"Out of a foil-capped, 22oz bottle this beer was a very cloudy, deep garnet color. The head was two fingers and off-white that became a think skim that left sticky lacing. The aroma was deeply malty, caramel, chocolate and roasted with hints of coffee. The flavors were great for the Bock style, almost like a Porter, again the complex malt with coffee notes and some bittering hops that added balance. The body was medium, the mouthfeel good and the carbonation perfect for the style."
"D: Pretty drinkable once the giant head settles."
"D: Pretty good; I enjoyed this big bottle. I would drink this again."
"If you like rich, creamy bock, you will love this style. Taste and appearance is wonderful. It follows the Rock Art Extreme Series of high quality beers. Try one, if it's still around!"
"Cheers!"
"Notes: A solid brew. You get what it says: Creamy Bock Lager. A bit creamy on the texture, a bit lager on the finish, and a perfect ""session"" winter/holiday ale. I appreciate that it's not a spiced winter release. Cheers to Matt and René!"
"A very bland Bock, which is quite disappointing given such rich, spicy, and complex aromatics. A good style to attempt from Rock Art. I would suggest changing the recipe to boost the abv and making this one of their big beer additions. Hopefully the boost in alcohol would draw out some of the rich and aged, fruity esters."
"Lots of maltiness but not overwhelming, very well made seasonal offering."
"Fairly drinkable, but it misses the mark I think a bit for a Christmas/holiday brew. Not as warming as I think it seems to advertise."
"bomber from ppoitras in No BS 3"
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with a rocky off white head that leaves a bit of lacing. Aroma is all malt. I pick up a bready caramely sweet aroma. The taste follows the smell. Mouthfeel certainly is creamy and smooth. Body seemed a bit thin to me. Not a bad brew. I don't think I would seek it out again, but definitely drinkable."
"This was a decent Bock beer but the tartness of the fruits (that bordered on astringent at times) really threw me for a loop. If you can get past that though, this is a fairly flavorfull and drinkable choice."
"Pours a cloudy rust color with floaties and 1 inch of frothy cream colored head, good retention and lacing. Smells of caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon, citrus, and biscuits. Tastes of sweet caramel and brown sugar with notes of holiday spices and a finish of citrus and dark fruits like cherries. Medium in body and very smooth and creamy. Sweet with a tart finish. An ok holiday brew with great creaminess, but not really my thing, I don't think I'll seek this out again."
"EXCELLENT."
"Now overall, I do not know if it was the year or so of aging put on by this one, or it was just that good out of the gate, but this was fantastic. It was rich and smooth with an incredible Drinkability that was outstanding and this really was a fantastic brew all around. Needless to say, I do not think very many of these were around, and probably very little still are, but if you have one, go for it, its damn good right now."
"Drinkability: It's hard to get through the bomber, but a glass is nice. Should be warmed some before drinking and consumed on a cold night after a near-death experience while snowshoeing."
"Drinkability: Simple, straightforward, and, well, that's that."
" Not taking anything away from this beer it did seem like Rock Art`s attempt at an Anchor Christmas Ale.No complaints here.Great beer on a chilly winter night."
"All in all the beer seemed to take a little time to develop on the palate. Once the flavors seems to warm on your tounge they came through, but nothing to wow the taste buds. Enjoyable, but not memorable."
"drinkable?: sure, bit lacking and bitter."
"Drinkability: It is enjoyable, and well cast as a holiday specialty. I wouldn't have guessed it was a lager/Bock, and I have a sense that it might not be 100% true to style, but not a great set of comparison data. I found it to be a good complement to meatballs in slightly spicy red sauce (of course after initial tasting notes were taken), and I think it would also be nice with a beef roast in brown gravy."
"Fairly drinkable, but probably wouldn't want more than one. Above average beer, but nothing earth-shaking."
"Pours a dark murky mahagony with a full one fingered khaki colored head that slowly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Stickiness is pretty limited but visible with some decent lacing. Smell is of chocolate malts with hints of coffee and caramel. Nutty goodness in the nose as well as some woody scents. Lots of nutty flavors with this one. Almonds, chestnut, and walnut flavors with a nice chocolate malt background. Sweet from start to finish from the malt with some smoked flavor goodness. Mouthfeel is where this one falls a bit short. Not as ""rich and creamy"" as I was hoping. Medium bodied with an excessive amount of carbonation. Definitely one of the better bocks I've had, glad I was able to share it with my pops. Merry Christmas!"
"The appearance of this beer is enhanced by the surprising creaminess of the head which is dense, tan and fluffy. The liquid of this lager is a dark, brownish amber. Aroma is similar to an Octoberfest with lots of toasted malt. Some dried fruit and very slight alcohol round out the smells. Taste is smooth and creamy with not as much toast as the smell but still there. Taste is more on the sweet side to start with late but mild hop bitterness. Very smooth liquid with the added creaminess of the head make this easy to imbibe and a real pleasure as it's a departure from everything else in my fridge."
"I genuinely like this version of a Bock beer. It is not in the extreme category at all, but there is still a complexity that is thoroughly enjoyable."
"Overall, a very solid and enjoyable holiday beer. None of that typical winter warmer crap. Rock Art has always hit the nail on the head with this brew."
"Bock beer, light bodied per norm. Great drinking brew that sips like a dream on this colder November evening. No alcohol to be perceived, Id say around 6%"
"This is a pretty good, interesting brew overall. It's not necessarily what you'd expect out of a holiday beer but I can also see this one being quite enjoyable by the fire on a cool snowy New England night. Certainly worth a try and recommended."
"Overall a very tasty and enjoyable bock. I certainly hope they bring this one back for 2007."
"Finishes fairly dry, with some faintly lingering residuals. Alcohol is without a trace, and the beer is very drinkable albeit a bit on the thin side."
"D - An excellent choice for a chilly winter night, that's for sure! The combination of toasty malts and belly-warming alcohol make this one a tasty Holiday (or after) treat."
"No hint of alcohol is present at any stage of this beer. The flavor is sweet malt with toffee and caramel and a bit of chocolate too. A very easy drinker, while not overly complex, it is tasty."
"Something I'd buy again to test out, and for a cold night it's drinkable, but not something I'd pass up other stuff to get again."
"I'm liking this. My first beer from these guys. Love to try some more."
"A very solid brew. Its appearance is a dark chocolate with a very nice creamy head. Smell is rich in roasted malts and chocolate notes. Taste is slightly smoky with a great malt backbone...reminds me a tad of a milk stout. Hops are there but in a very nice balance. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy, yet with a smoot hcharacteristic. Very easy on the drinkability scale. While abv isn't listed I assume it is up there, as I can feel the alcohol kicking in. A very good offering worth a try."
"This offering from Rock Art pours a murky dark brown leaving a thick creamy tan head. The aroma is nutty and sweet creamy milky aroma, ripe fruit, plums, raisins, with a bit of milk chocolate. The taste starts a bit tart, underipned fruit in the taste, creamy milky mouthfeel, nuts, brisk carbonation lovely feel on the palate. I'm actually really enjoying this beer it has a load of flavors that really mesh well together and leave you wanting more of this bock. A great offering from Rock Art one that I will buy a couple more bottles of"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" dark tan head over the slightly cloudy burgundy brown brew. Head lasts well, with lots of lasting sticky lacing. Aroma is richly malty, with a light fruitiness. Taste is chocolate malt sweetness upfront, a tinge of fruit in the middle, and a slightly hoppy close. Seems to missing something here, but what's there is very nice. Mouthfeel is creamy, although perhaps a bit too bubbly, and drinkability is good. I could see revisiting this one, for sure."
"Overall it's pretty good, but I didn't particularly care for it. Don't get me wrong, it's a good, solid beer, but somehow not my style. Great packaging, though. Classy and understated, it jumps out from the phalanx of overtly loud beer labels screaming out at you. Maybe this would have benefitted from some unreasonably extended lagering, but like Goodbyeohio said, it feels ""green"". I wonder if some extra lagering time would have made the yeast drop out even further. Then again, I don't brew and I'm just a beer drinker with an opinion. We also have a perfectionist brewer with a big soft spot for lager making beers in my home state, so that doesn't help either. A big high-five to Rock Art for attempting a technically challenging and under-appreciated style of beer. They could have jammed my jaws full of hops and booze, or open-fermented behind the brewery next to the dumpster, called it a wild ale, and made an easy A. Different, difficult, traditional, and much appreciated on this holiday season."
"At first glance, this beer seems to be an offering similar to the other rock art beers; tasty but not mouth watering. The beer pours a deep red to black, leaving a head that disapates rather quickly. The smell is nice, but isnt anything to rave about. The smell and appearance of this beer is very misleading, for once this touches the tongue it is beautiful. As the lable reads, it is a rich and creamy brew. As for a 'bock lager' .... i cant say it lives up to such standards. It is, however a very enjoyable winter brew. Nice balance of malty and hoppy, the aftertaste leaves you feeling jolly. I would catch this beer if u can... my bottle is numbered 3169 of 3,800."
"It is a very nice deep garnet color in the glass, with a rather small head. Smells very malty, much like the Spaten Optimator I had the day before but with some light spiciness in the background, reminiscent of bread pudding.. Tastes very malty, that good Munich malt flavor that grabs onto your tongue and won't let go. It still finishes with a hint of astringency, which keeps it out of the 4.5 - 5 range, but definitely a pleasure to drink. For the first time, I'll buy more than one bottle this year."
"Pours a dark rich mahogony with a foamy almost Guiness like head. The smell is very ""bisquity"" with some christmas spices,nutmeg and cinnamon. The scent is sweet,but not overly so like most Holiday beers. The taste is sweet and crisp with bread yeast, roasted malt, and holiday spices. Not bad,like the smell more subdued than other holiday beers. The m/f is light,lighter than I expected, with all the flavors mixing well. A pretty damn good beer. One that will make you wish Christmas came more than once a year."
"highly recommended. can't speak for the 05."
"Bomber bottle that has been in the back of my fridge for a few months, seemed like a good night to give it a try. Pours very dark ruby amber, with a quickly departing tan head, leaves no film and no lacing. Nose of coca-cola. Thick bodied and low carbonation, the dominant flavors are dark caramel, some vanilla and more sweet cola notes. Finishes without hop notes. Just more sweetness. Low complexity and interest. There are better holiday brews out there. I'll pass this one by next time."
"Got to share this one with family after Christmas dinner. My cousin rounded up this bottle from a ski trip to Vermont. Lucky us. This beer pours a nice brown color with a thick white head that lasted for a bit. The smell was nice and sweet yet nutty, very pleasant for an after dinner drink. The taste of the beer is equally nutty and a bit sweet, nice alcohol balance. The aftertaste is also quiet nutty but pleasant. I really enjoyed this bock and would like to have more of this if available in PA. I have had about 4 or 5 other Rock Art brews lately and I think this was the best of the lot. Really enjoyed it."
"Served deep redbrown with a slight light tan head. Brew is very smooth. Mouthfeel reaches towards perfection. Better on tap than in a bottle? Me thinks maybe. Tastes great and is well balanced. One of the better bocks I've had lately. I'm glad that Rock Art is brewing lagers now."
"Small whitish head induced by a rough pour. Body is dark brown with caramel highlights. Aroma is soft and somewhat nutty with no hop aromas detected. Mouthfeel is slick as it slips down the throat with ease, but does not offer much flavor upfront. Aftertaste is all walnut with slight fruity alcohol notes. Alcohol is noticeable but melds with the sweet malt very nicely. Leaves your mouth dry like walnut skins. I wonder if they brewed this with walnuts? A decent, drinkable bock, but missing some hop aroma and flavor."
