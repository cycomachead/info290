"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle, this most excellent bock from Rivertown pours a beautiful amber with a thick off white soapy foam and clinging lacing.  Nose of browned toast, raisin, light herbal hops, and sweet caramel malts.  Flavors follow the nose with rich caramel and fresh bread like notes, mixed with a pleasant nutty characteristic and mild herbal hop in the background.  One of the better bocks I have had this year.  SOLID."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy reddish copper color with a small dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, green apple, raisin, plum, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with solid complexity and decent balance of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. A bit too estery with green apple on the nose. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, raisin, fig, plum, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light chocolate, raisin, fig, plum, herbal, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this a nice Bock style. Good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. If the nose wasnâ€™t overly estery this definitely would have scored a bit higher. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall / Drinkability: Hmm....just okay I think. Maybe it would be better with food. By itself nothing special and I've had better bocks. Tasty enough, but everything together leaves something to be desired."
"The metallic character really kills this. Good toasted malt backbone, though."

"O - It has been a while since I have had a bock. This is a decent beer. It has pretty good flavor."

"While not bad, this beer needs a heftier mouthfeel, more carbonation, and a little more hop presence to stave off the presence of the sweetness. Overall, this is a solid take on the bock style, and one of the better American interpretations of the style."

"First time I had anything from RT. Drank 5 in a row, was very tasty! Usually never drink that many. Full flavored bock, not overly sweet, well balanced. It had a nice dark amber color, slightly ruby. Didn't pour it aggressively, but it still had a nice foamy head, Ok lacing. Will buy again! Good job Rivertown!"

"Very much a bock in our glasses and not for much longer; even for its size, it presents itself as a very drinkable beer. The warmth does catch up after a while. A real treat to run into, we can really appreciate the deft hand(s) it took to create this malt bomb."

"Though the feel never recovers, I think Rivertown actually has a decent beer of a traditional style to tweak and improve upon. Tinker with the taste and nail down the feel and they'll have a pretty decent bock."

"Pours a clear gold/amber color with a small white head. Not what I expected this one to look like. Aroma of toasted malt and dark fruit, maybe molasses. Flavor of sweet malts, grains, grassy? Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a grainy mouthfeel. Not the best bock. Rivertown is starting to show up in my area, so I hope some of their other offerings are better than this one."
"A rather disappointing offering from a local brewery. Not bad, just nothing to write home about. I won't buy this again. It cannot even sit on the same shelf as a classic like HB Maibock."
"Decent beer. It satisfied, nice for springtime, but isn't something to go crazy about."

"O- I like this bock because of its different taste, seems lighter that traditional bocks. Says it has a 7.2% ABV but there is no alchol taste. The fruit taste doesn't appear until the beer is 1/2 gone. I think I'll have another!"
"Overall: Not a fan of this one. A bit too sweet and I didn't like the finish."
"Drinkability - not my favorite bock, but it drinks okay."
"O- Overall a decent beer but probably not picking it up regularly."
"O: Haven't had a good beer yet from Rivertown. This one is a good offering which is exciting. Glad to have a case of it."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a caramel-amber color with a thin, mocha head. The nose is malty sweet of darker notes with figs and dates, caramel and molasses. The taste follows suit and starts out very sweet, transitions to bitter just to balance and then there is a lingering of toasty, bready malt on the finish. Mouthfeel is lighter in body than I would normally expect but the carbonation is almost perfect. Overall, a drinkable beer, not bad but not memorable either."
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer is a hazy mahogany with a half inch of white that lasts a couple minutes then falls back into the beer. The smell is a bit of malt but I'm mostly getting a dimethyl sulfide (corny) smell which I know can be a problem with lagers. The taste also has a bit of that DMS taste and is a little fruity as it warms. The malt and hints of banana comes out after a while. The mouthfeel was a little stinging on the back of my tongue and didn't really beg for another drink. It doesn't look like I had much nice to say about this beer but it wasn't that bad. Bock isn't one of my favorite styles to start with but this isn't a bad beer, just kind of uninteresting."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a medium body with good carbonation. The beer was a little sweet for my taste. Not bad but I think I will pass on more of this Bock."
"D: Very drinkable. Nice, clean and satisfying."
"Drinkability: Solid enough - the major aspects are pretty much what I would expect, and at $1.70 for a bottle, I feel the pricing is very reasonable for such a solid, yet largely unheard of (as of now), beer; the ABV doesn't feel that big either (although I have no idea what it is), and I feel that I could get through 2-3 with little problem."
