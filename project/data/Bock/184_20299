All in all, having had an ale version of bockbier this good, I wonder if I should pay the Netherlands a visit anytime soon(er)…!

The smell of the beer has a good amount of malts on the nose and even a touch of spice and yeast. The taste of the beer gives off a nice subtle caramel sweetness upfront that fades into a dry toasted flavor. There seems like there could be some autumnal spices in this as well but they're very faint. The mouthfeel is smooth and has a good amount of body too. Overall I really enjoyed this brew, I still enjoy their Quad the most but this is probably the next best thing La Trappe puts out.","Knapp85","Aug 30, 2011"
4.23,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"It certainly retained its carbonation nicely! I had about a finger of light-tan head that quickly fizzed its way out of existence. Color was a cola-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with a caramel malty sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a definite caramel taste on the tongue, almost a burnt caramel aspect. Finish was very sweet with the caramel flavor simply lingering well after the swallow. Wow! Bock at 0500 - I must not be working this summer. I would recommend this as more of a dessert beer than a wake-up beer.","woodychandler","Jul 19, 2011"
4.18,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall, it's an interesting Belgian-style take on this German style. It definitely varies from traditional bocks that I remember with much more rich flavors. A solid 4.0 from me overall.","theboozecruise","Jul 07, 2011"

4.12,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: Don't expect a traditional Bock Beer here. In fact, I think that the idea behind it was producing a Bock keeping the characteristics of a Trappist. I like it and really recommend it","eduardolinhalis","Jun 01, 2011"

The nose is malty and sweet, with light aromas of spice and dried herbs. Chocolate, caramel and raisin notes make more of a showing once the head dissipates. A sharp little kick of fruity yeast, immediately followed by the drying Hallertauer hops. An average example of the style, in no way a standout.","DaveHS","May 23, 2010"

4.12,2.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark russet with a dense tan head. The smell is sulfured molasses, swamp moss, fallen leaves, strong tea. The taste is heavy on the molasses, with caramel malts, something like blood sausage, and a graphite minerality in the finish the comes back around to the molasses. It's thick though not too viscous, heavy without being cloying. It's like no other bock beer I've had, and altogether excellent: I could have had another bottle.

The lack of malt in the finish really hurt this beer in my opinion. All that said, this beer really has a pretty good flavor and I will certainly drink the whole bottle...so it doesn't suck.

4.7,16.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"This 25.4 oz/750 mL bottle was my second experience with Koninghoeven's offerings, and I was impressed with this Bock. The pour into a Hennepin (Ommegang) tulip glass produced a good, persistent, tan head with moderate stickiness. (The recently-acquired tulip glass really helped concentrate the odor - I highly recommend them!) The brown color, with strong red highlights, advertised a substantial beer experience. The odor was vaguely fruity, malty (surprise!), with bread toast overlays. The fruit character was hard to pin down; it was not estery or banana-like. The taste did not disappoint. Breadcrust malty flavors dominated, but a general, balanced fruitiness rounded out the primary flavor. As the beer warmed in the second half of the bottle, the fruit character hinted at apples and pears. the aftertaste had a tinge of roasted barley with coffee overtones, but it was neither dominant nor persistent. A tinge of hops and a hint of alcoholic heat helped keep this from being cloyingly sweet. The sticky, full mouthfeel was very pleasant. This beer is like a sip of autumn harvest. I enjoyed this Trappist selection very much and expect to purchase again in the future.","neobassman","Sep 07, 2009"

Pours a clear chestnut brown color with a huge khaki colored head that dissipated into a puffy cap and left nice lacing on the side of my dimple mug. The aroma is of dark toasted malt, with hints of red wine, and roasted meat. The red wine flavors dominate up front, with a touch of metal following, a solid toasted grain and bready malt backbone supports the sweetness. The feel is of a nice full body with active carbonation, chewy, finishes sweet. I do like the maltier bocks and this fits the bill. Good balance between the sweet and malt.","Gmann","Nov 21, 2008"

La Trappe Tripple and Quadrupel are always high in my list of preference and I respect this brewery very much, so my expectations were very high but I got a little dissapointed. This is a very good beer indeed, but I was expecting something really exceptional. It has a very strong taste for a bock - a little too strong for me. But then, it is not a typical bock. There is a hint of Quadrupel in it, but perhaps it's just my idea. It has a well-balanced smell and a beautiful rich dark-brown kinda-red color. I would drink this beer as a delicacy, but not in large ammounts.","dbek","Oct 02, 2008"

4.06,1,5,4,4,4,4,"I had this as the Koningshoeven Bock, which came in a different wrapper than the La Trappe, but I'm assuming it is all the same. The beer pours the thickest, frothiest, well retained head that I've seen on just about any beer. This is the thickest, chewiest, full bodied bock you're likely to find. The taste was strong brown sugar, molasses, caramel malts. There are plenty of roasted malts and brown malts to accompany the sweet molasses and sugars found in this beer. The beer is complex, made with a number of different malts and hops combinations listed on the label, and the taste is just robust. There is a bit of a throaty aftertaste and the ABV isn't hidden all that well, but there are plenty of warming notes that do make it interesting. The beer is complex, thick, husky, and a very memorable bock style beer. Worth looking for. L'Chaim.","albern","May 11, 2008"
