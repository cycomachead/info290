"Pandoras Bock  pours hazy reddish chestnut under a thin off white foam cap. The nose and palate are nutty toasted malt, bread and a hint of caramel or kettle sugars. There are no big hop aromas or flavors but it finishes with an assertive hop bitterness."

"Overall - Mouthfeel and appearance need work, but the taste is pretty solid. Not a world beater by any means, but a decent beer that is worth trying once."

"O: This beer is easy to drink but seems doesn't seem as malty and thicker on the palate compared to other bocks. On the other hand, it's easy to drink and hides its alcohol very well."

"Not bad. Not much of a comparison to German versions -- can't win that race. But a very decent brew. Nice to find a reasonably-priced domestic version of the style."

"For a beer that's said to be over 7% ABV, this brew went down real smooth. Not one of the more robust Bock's out there, but defiantly held true to my expectations of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Malt forward brew with light complexity. Not offensive, aside from the light body and dark fruit character."
""
""
"Yeah, it's a pun, but at least it's not a hop pun... This stuff pours a clear midnight amber topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises honey-laden rye bread, a light hint of maple syrup, and a vague sense of sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, though now that bread is also slathered in Country Crock (nope, no real butter here, folks), and there's a general feeling of mild greens mixed in here and there. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly fluid feel. Overall, an okay bock at best, one that just doesn't do it for me at all."

"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was an average at best example of the style, it was pretty bland in most aspects and it didn't have any of those good bock flavors that I was hoping for. This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth and the alcohol was well hidden but the flavors were so bland that they couldn't hold my attention and I wouldn't want to drink another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the only aspect of this beer that was decent and it was fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was way too bland for the style and it wasn't very memorable at all. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's just not a good example of the style and I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone. All in all i was pretty let down with this beer, it didn't really have any redeeming quality's. This was another average at best beer from Breckenridge, I don't think I will be taking too many more chances on this brewery, I have yet to be impressed by any of their beers, you guys need to step your game up."

"O- generally, i enjoy breckenridge. but, this is a complete miss."

"Pours a hazy copper, with a thin tan head. Good retention, and a nice lace. Aroma is of toasty, fruity malts and sugar. Body is medium, and quite carbonated. Taste is of brown sugar and spice. Hints of hops in the finish. Not awful, but way to sugary sweet for my taste."
"Overall a quaffable bock. Not much to write home about however."
"O- this one wasn't horrible, but not something I would buy again. I was however surprised that it was 7.5% as it was very easy to drink."

"O: Overall an average experience, nothing is gonna jump out at you visually, aromatically, or taste wise. The beer sweetens up as it goes with some toasty caramel. Drinkable, but with middle of the road excitment factor. Single serving recommedation at first."
""
""
"O- Not a bad bock, one of the very good ones i have had...maybe a top 12."
""
""
"Pop went the cap and no ill came out of the bottle. Instead, I got a finger-and-a-half of rocky, tawny head with good retention on this humid summer's day. Color was a deep orangish-amber with NE-quality clarity and loads of carbonation in evidence. Nose had a dense caramel sweetness which was to be expected. I say that as a self-avowed hophead. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste, while malty and sweet, was not cloying, which is something I have encountered in this style. Finish was actually tending towards dry, suggesting that they really allowed the yeast to do its job, hence the ABV. I like Breckenridge, I liked this beer although it would not be the first thing that I would reach for, so I would suggest giving it a try."

"Overall - It's a good if not average Bock beer. Try it out, but that's all I can say"

"Never was impressed with Breckenridge, but this beer works for what it is. 3.5"
"Overall a very solid offering, and worth a revisit next season."
"This was a bit stronger than other Bocks that I've had too but I didn't count that as a negative. One bottle of this wouldn't be enough to knock anyone out but it will probably end up being underwhelming in the end. It was too toasty for me but like the other Breckenridge Beers that I've had, it stands up just fine on its own, ever if nothing in particular stands out about it."
"It is very drinkable, but does not fit the style in my book."
"This drinks very well. Seems to be a bit light on the malt bill for the style, but I still really like the beer overall and wouldn't have much of a problem going through a couple in a row."
""
""
""
""
"O- Quite good for the ABV. Can be sessionable even if it's not meant to be."
"Drinkability: It's decent a little better than the Victory I had earlier tonight."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another good beer from Breck, solid malt flavors with great drinkability."
""
"O: Wasn't quite what I expected given the scents but not a bad beer overall. I'm not a huge Bock drinker but i'd love to see it on tap to retry (I can't determine the freshness of the bottle) as it appears my review differs a bit on flavor from some of the others i've seen."
""
"O- Overall, not a huge fan of this one. It is not horrible, but is just a little on the bland side."
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
"O: Nothing about this beer stood out to me. It was just above average in every way."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, caramel. Taste is the same, malts, bready, caramel, a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a highly drinkable and good quality beer."

"O: I am a sap for the name (marketing does work). I haven't been blown away by any Brecken Ridge I have consumed (though I am nowhere close to having all of them as of yet). This beer is the same: pleasant, drinkable, but not astounding. It is a smooth bock with decent malt and some hops. There is a burnt edge to the fruit. I don't feel any desire to buy it again, to wait until the spring season with anticipation for it, or to horde it like other beers I enjoy."
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish copper with a minimal white head. Mild, boring aroma of bready malt, slightly sweet, maybe some caramel. Very sweet, malt forward, some grain. Trace hop bitterness in the finish. Creamy body with high carbonation. A subpar bock."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a ruddy brown with a think white skein of foam. I'm a sucker for a pretty blonde in a red dress..nice label! Smell was faintly of caramel and biscuits. Taste was light and smooth, malt, bread, biscuit, subtle sweetness. Medium to light body and a creamy-smooth mouthfeel that hold together well. Overall it's enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Personally, bock never really impresses me and this is a typical bock experience. It is sweet and the flavors are muted. It is okay."
""
""
"This is a balanced Brew that is enjoyed as if it isn't a 7.5% beer. It tastes much smoother, and is balanced well for a Bock of that percentage."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a reddish brown color with a smaller short lived off white head. The smells are of caramel and toffee. The feel is medium. Taste is pretty good, caramel and toffee, slight hop bite nice amount of sweetness."
""
"First sip is clean, malty, with a sweet finish and low bitterness. The off aromas that I detected are not present in the flavor at all. Drinks very nice. Just a straightforward, drinkable bock, alcohol is nicely disguised."
"O – The flavor that is here isn’t bad, but ultimately this is a completely drab and forgettable American Bock. I’d go so far as to call it “balanced” which is good. I would also call it “meek”, which is not. Come on, Breckenridge, you can do better than this."
""
"Breckenridge Pandora’s Bock: Smooth and malty, very similar to Breckenridge’s Avalanche Ale, but a bit better. The body is a dark cherry wood in color, very clear, and has a fair amount of carbonation. The head is off-white, fades as your glass empties, but laces well. There is a nice aroma to the Pandora, mostly malt but some hop notes come through. Very smooth to drink, lots of malt, and a touch of hops to the finish. There is a little bitter/metallic taste to the aftertaste. A decent beer by Breckenridge."
""
""
"Overall, this beer will always have a place on my shelf. I find it enjoyable to drink, and the nostalgia in me will always have an appreciation for it."
"O: This is an okay beer, but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Really malty and delicious. If the AVB was lower, this would be a great session beer."
"nice new one from breck. pours an enticing deep copper color with a one inch white head that quietly fades out. smells malty and complex, english a little but wit a more pronounced hop vibe and some german maltiness too. taste is similar, sweet a little like toffee. a quantifiable heaviness from all the malt in the mouthfeel keeps it from being a great session beer, too heavy for me to have many, sits in the gut. at 7.5% its nice to sip a few on a chilly night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured out as a deep amber color, mostly brown in some lighting. The head was fizzy and tan in color. It didn't leave much retention or lacing. The smell of the beer is malty and fairly sweet on the nose. The taste of the beer has a decent caramel flavor mixed with some toasted malts giving the beer a decent bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty typical I think, medium bodied and carbonated. Overall this Bock isn't too bad. I would probably drink it again."
""
"This is my first of this style so I don't know how it compares to other bocks. It is a kind of one not with the sweet malt aroma and taste. Decent enough, but nothing spectacular. Will have to have more of this style to compare."
"Drinkable enough, but not outstanding."
" The bock taste of caramel in the soft malt note up front w/ slight pepper and mild toaste w/ hint of woody malt flavor. There is mild roasted elements w/ subtle buttered toffee-like sweet oily finish. an overall good/better than average Traditional Bock. It is a decent lager with some nice malt flavor w/ higher than average abv for the style."
"D: Rich and robust without being complex. A very well done and pleasant drinking bock. Not over the top, and hides its relatively big abv well."
"A good rendition of the style, great to see another brewer take on this underrated style."
"On that continuum, this is half way between Genny and German. That makes it work. It's interesting and complex. The malts come through loud and clear. There is a crispness and drinkability. I could have ... two. Recommended if you are looking for a mild, easy to drink bock."
"D: a good, but not great bock."
"It's rare to see an American-made traditional bock, especially bottled, so I was excited to give this a try. Unfortunately the character was disappointing and flat. It tasted more like an imperial version of Yuengling. There was a clean, smooth caramel malt, with a hint of licorice and a relatively thin body. Not a bad beer, but too simple."
"Poured this beer from a bottle into a sniffer. Appearance is a rich amber color with a brown tint to it. The head is nice but fades quickly. The smell is malty but there is really not much there. The crisp""ness"" of the beer is the first thing i noticed about the taste. As opposed to other reviews, i didnt get much of an alcohol note in the flavor. To me, it starts with brown sugar and maple then moves on to a biscuit finish. Mouthfeel is smooth but pretty average. Drinkability is also average in my opinion"
"This is your run of the mill bock. It is not exceptional, but it is not bad at all. It pours a reddish brown, with a hint of smoked wood and fruits. The beer is quite frothy and full of head, but is ok. This beer is decent. The aroma is fairly average, but overall this beer is pretty decent"
"Overall, I thought this beer was ok. They did manage to get a pretty high alcohol content without making it very bitter. Pretty enjoyable, but after one of these I would move without looking back."
"Decent bock, and quite drinkable."
"The mouthfeel really plays up the oily astringency and the ramen is all but prevalent. It's a terribly awful beer that's impossible to finish. NEVER, never before have I not finished a beer that I've ordered at the Saucer, this was the first I never finished. I couldn't tolerate it. This beer is awful and not worth your money. Do not drink this beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability - a little quirky in the aftertaste, but overall not a bad brew. Decent taste and not too filling, the quirky tastes make it a bit perplexing for me, which I like."
"D - goes down smooth and easy."
"Pours a clear amber. Not much of a head. Flavors of malt, caramel and light brown sugar. This is a lighter bodied bock beer, alcohol is not noticable. I would of thought this would rate higher, This is a very easy to drink beer. I could put a few of these away at a summer picnic."
"This drank smoothly with a modest level of carbonation that seemed just right. Even at 7,5%, I could see drinking several pints of this in a sitting. A very well crafted seasonal offering from Breckenridge."
"D: The average flavor profiles for a bock make this a very drinkable, however, it won't blow you away. I could have more than one of these and be quite happy, then again, I could try something else as well."
"I like the fact that this is a lower carbonation beer. For me it makes it easier to drink with food."
"D- A beer that may not be very interesting but it drinks decently well for the alcohol content."
"Pours a nice light brown with copper tinges, and with the slightest bit of head that fades rapidly. Nice crisp scent, very malty and slightly deep with a very nice lager aroma. Decent taste, a nice semi-deep flavor with decent dark grain tones and a sweet finish. Goes down incredibly smooth for such a high ABV brew."
"D - Meh ever since the vanilla porter it's been ok. This is a mix and match BTW :P"
"Pours a bronze color with a nice cearmy head that quickly dicipates. smells sweet and malty, lacing on the glass but not heavy and quickly disappears. Not a strong hop flavor. You can taste some sweetness, mild carbination. Overall not really a strong flvorful beer. Drinkable but kind of bland."
"I've never had a beer so similar to Coca-Cola. It looks like many bocks, but has very little flavor and aroma. Coke is just as thin and only a bit sweeter. The hops are almost indetectable and I'm really curious how this dark color exists without much maltiness in the beer. I'm struggling to adequately review this beer because my taste buds are struggling find some flavor. It's very smooth for 7.5% abv, perhaps that's caused by all the sugars instead of the herbal, hoppy aroma and breadiness from the malt I desired. However, this is the only bock I might consider a panty dropper."
"D - Good stuff. Not really a session brew, but great for desert!"
"Overall I am unimpressed with this beer. I have found a general lack of liking to Breckenridge's products (3 of the 4 I have tried I would never buy again)."
"Cheers!"
"wow, worlds above the last bock I reviewed a few short days ago."
"D - The dryness is actually becoming quite distracting to me, Otherwise it's a well-balanced, malty bock."
"D: This was OK to me, but nothing more. The metallic flavors in the middle really detracted from the overall experience."
"Breckenridge is normally a good brewery, but like all breweries some beers are a hit and some are a miss. I feel this was a miss. I felt it was too much like an american macro lager"
"Pours a medium amber, deep yet lear copper color. The head is almost one finger thick, but quickly dissipates. The aroma is a rich toasted malt. Giving off scents of toasted bread, caramel, and some light molasses. The taste is a nice sweet, bread. The palate is soft and syrupy. Just a great malt bill with maybe only a dash of earthy hops to offset the malts a little. This is an awesome bock and higly reccomend it."
"Pours deep and clear amber color laced with a thin white head. The aroma is very light and vague with subtle malty scents. The flavor is somewhat sweet and tart with a full grainy flavor. The light body and high carbonation make this brew flow fast and the finish fades quickly with a lingering sweet and tart flavor. This beer is a strange example of a bock style and drinks much like an American lager."
"Overall, easy-drinking, nothing especially jumps out at you flavorwise,alcholol is pretty well disguised for 7.5ABV."
"D- Great session beer. Simple and hearty."
"Overall: A good session beer, perfect for the end of winter. Don't go looking for anything beyond what you find in the nose, but it's all in check so no complaints."
"Was looking forward to a nice beer. Appearance is dark copper and opaque. Residual hops noted in bottom of glass. Sourness and somewhat vinous aroma as it warmed. Malty nose is there as it warms and toasty/breadiness apparent. Very tart and astringent taste that leads one to believe it is a soured bock. Perhaps I received a very old bottle. Light in body for the style and overall was not drinking experience I was hoping for."
"It's pretty drinkable for a 7.5% abv. The alcohol is not much of a player."
"Cloudy orange/brown color with a very thin white head. Bready, biscuity smell that was pretty offputting given the dirty socks smell that went along with it. This beer had an incredibly sour, infected taste that lead to an immediate drain pout. Definitely will not be buying this one again."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a red-orange color with a small fizzy off-white head. Aroma is sweet, caramel malts, molasses, and fruits. Flavor is caramel malts, fruits, and citrus hops. Mouthfeel is somewhat dry, bitter, medium bodied. Decent and drinkable beer, but not a bock."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. The bock appears a clear reddish amber color with about a finger of tan foam. Nose and flavor are of buttered toasted bread, caramel malt, black cherry flavoring, some toffee, a hint of chocolate. A few notches under medium bodied, a tad thin, with average carbonation. Not one of their better beers."
"A hazy amber color pour with a thick two fingers of foamy head , medium carbonation , spotty lacing . Aroma of sweet caramel malt , honey , and bready yeast . Flavos is sweet and malty , light toffee , light rasins with a nice amount of hops , lightly bitter , full body creamy mouthfeel . Sweet malty finish . Very drinkable . A nice brew ."
"This beer has a really spicy scent to it - you can pick up a bit of hop in the aroma, but this is not a bitter beer (only 16 IBUs). The medium body of the beer has a complexity to it, that is so complex I can't adequately describe without my head blowing up. Pandora is a bit of an intense lady anyway - her Bock is too - 7.5% ABV. Sneaky Pandora."
"Hit with a medium to light bitterness that fades quickly into citrus flavors, like oranges and lemons. The aftertaste to me also has a tea taste to it. I had a few of these last night before reviewing and as it warmed then, all it reminded me of was tea beer...or sometime like that. Not bad, a better bock showing than Shiner, but a little too sweet for me."
"Drink ability is above average. It's semi session able, but it just has that weird sour after taste that gets to me."
"Poured a medium and hazy copper color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of caramel, toastiness, some grains, and a little earthy. Tastes of toasted grains, caramel, tart grape skins, and citrus. This one seemed to be all over the place."
"I honestly expect more stability from Breckenridge. I was totally expecting to write that I may have gotten a bad or aging bottle but from others' reviews, I am convinced that this is just the way the beer is made."
"A bit of a disappointment, it could perhaps use a bit more lagering time as it seems like it still might be a bit green. This seems like it has a good start to the malt complexity that it would need to be great, but it is just not integrated enough to really work here."
"Pleasantly suprised by this lager. Pours a woody amber with a silky tan head. Nose has bready malts, dark fruits and spicy yeast. Taste follows suit, but lacks the same complexities. Powered by malt, but kept in balance by the powerfull yeast strain. Nothing outstanding, but rather a simple well rounded bock. Body was over carbonation. Became watery as the pop texture subsided. A nice session brew."
"Brec brews are usually fence-sitter's for me. Their 471's, their oatmeal stout, even the agave wheat, are nice, original beers. I think this one stands with that crowd in breaking through the mediocre and attempting to break into excellence. Great flavor, but lacking in all other characteristics (besides drinkability)."
"D: Pretty good, malts are tasty and not overly sweet. Easy to drink, smooth."
"Amber colored beer with a slowly fading head,Aroma is fruity.Taste has lots different fruits,caramel and some toasted malts.This goes down pretty smooth,a lot thinner than I expected.Overall it was an enjoyable beer.I would recommend and purchase again."
"The foam was light wheat in color, non lacey and dissapated quickly. The color was amber/mahogany with an orange highlight. The smell was an aromatic fruity wheat, a little bitter and a toasted wood undertone. The taste had a fruity wheat start with a hops balance and bitter. Mouthfeel - medium-bodied and smooth. Drinkability - it was ok, except for the bitter wheat was way too dominate."
"12oz bottle split two ways. Dark reddish brown, slight head, smells beery. the first taste was actually akin to vomit but it quickly subsided into a more malty, lagerish flavor. Not sure what was going on there. Easy to drink but kind of thin, I'd prefer something German any day of the week."
"D - First off, I love the name... Solid bock offering... It really is a solid brew... Sessionable and repeatable..."
"M/D - light carbonation and decent mouthfeel, its just too sweet for me. I enjoyed the taste, but by the end, I had had enough"
"It's a heavy beer, so I don't know how many you could drink in an evening, but it would be nice to have a case handy."
"Pours a hazy, dark auburn color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of yeast strongly, then sweet malt, and slight hops. Fits the style of a Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation. Tastes of yeast cleanliness up front, then sweet malt, and some hops are noticeable - a little watery. Overall, nothing great, but a decently blended Bock that is reasonably drinkable."
"D - Very good Bock in my opinion. The armoa was a little restrained, but overall this had a nice complex flavor with plenty of sweet, malty goodness without becoming cloying."
"Drinkability - drank a little over half, then let my drain have the rest."
"Slightly disappointed with Pandora here. This is a beer that for some reason (name, label art, the fact that it was a bock, who knows?) I really, almost desperately wanted to love. The look and aromas were nice, but everything else was strictly average. Perhaps I need to taste this side-by-side with others of its kind, as I'm becoming increasingly convinced that the bock is an under-appreciated and largely misunderstood style. I like it more than most bocks, but I'd still have a hard time recommending it for any reason other than sheer curiosity."
"A pleasant Bock, I'm not sure it's going to cause any trouble just because I opened it, but you never know! She's unpredictable that Pandora."
"This sticks on my taste buds for a bit but is not especially strong. Good brew."
"This is a nice example of an average and refreshing bock with no frills."
"Taste is candied Jolly Ranger apple/cherry. Sweet. Syrupy a bit. Semi-clean towards the end. The old sock characteristic i usually get from this style is very weak here, which is good. For the style I guess it's ok. I'm not a fan."
"Nice clear burgandy color with a fiery glow to it. A very slight beige head barely skims the surface of the beer. Malty aroma, but not too thick. A little raisiny too. This is a decent tasting bock. Big body. Close to full. Chewy mouthfeel. Thick malty taste. Raisins, figs and dates are fairly pronounced in the flavor profile. Almost a bread pudding feel to it. Solid effort."
"Pours medium amber with contrasting white head. Nose is on the ""sweet"" side with honey and bready malt. On the palate the malt is noticeable right away, but this is a lighter bock than most and the lighter bodied malt component fades into the honeyed finish. Alcohol is noticed on the finish also. Clean and refreshing. Good for those who like a lighter bock. I'd recommend this as a gateway beer to German style bocks."
"D: Very drinkable for the style. Smooth and goes down easy."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability both decent."
"Really surprised at Breckenridge to put something like this out."
"An easy drinking bock from Breckenridge."
"Good drinkable brew."
"D: A drinkable but uninspired bock. Allow to warm for better flavor and aroma but they have better offerings."
"Overall, nothing to spectacular, but it seemed to fit my mood for drinking it tonight. Something that I would never say no to."
"D: as said above, goes down very smooth. a nice session beer."
"Wow was I disappointed with this brew. This is the first from Breckenridge that I have not liked. I tried to pull something from it but couldn't come up with a thing. No real distinct aroma or flavor just bland & boring. Reminded me of a BMC in disguise. I tried it along with two friends & none of us could get anything from it. Will not buy this one again."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer, being a warm late-winter day, I was glad to see a Bock I haven't tried, served a dark amber almost brown with a decent cream head. The aroma was some slight sweet malts. The taste was the crisp malt bite I expect in a bock with a nice touch of burnt caramel. The beer is crisp, smooth and refreshing making it a great Spring beer. This is certainly an enjoyable bock."
"The taste is of sweet malty notes up front followed by big earthy tones and *some* tartness, not as big as in the nose, thankfully, but it's there and it's distracting. Overall flavour is, imho, a real mess...too earthy, too sweet, not too drinkable:^( I'm doubting whether I can finish the bottle. Too bad because it's really a great looking beer in the glass ie good head retention and lacing. No more for me, please."
"Thought this was one of the better ones available at the brewery."
"it's not a bad drink, but not rely all that super, either. i made a commitment some years ago to be harsher in my criticism. could i drink a sixer of this? yes. but then again, i love beer"
"D: I love bocks. Won't buy again. Fail as a bock. It's not a bock. Not sure what it is, but, its horrible as hell."
"This was an interesting beer. It poured a very nice clear copper color, and while it did not have much head it looked good and it also had a nice aroma, however, it had one of the strangest tastes I have had in a beer. First, the mouthfeel was almost oily and it seemed to leave a film in my mouth. My friends thought I was crazy, but it tasted like liquid fried chicken. It was not a very pleasant taste, thank goodness this taste was the first taste when the beer hit my mouth and dissipated quickly. The beer did not have a strong after taste. Don't think I would drink this again."
"The beer was served in a pint glass. Beer pours a nice clear copper color. A very slight beige head barely skims the surface of the beer. No head retention or lacing to it. Nose is mostly of yeast and malts with a hint of nuttiness to it. This is a decent tasting bock with a relatively big body to it. Taste is of caramel and sweet malts. Hops are very very light in the finish - I really had to look for them. The beer finishes clean and crisp, a little on the dry side. Overall, it's not an overly impressive bock, but it's a drinkable bock that you could sit with for an evening."
"Drinkability: Not so good. Breckenridge opened a beer that contained true evils to be unleashed upon all mankind -- ills, toils and even sickness -- and finally hope. Yes, hope. Hope that my next beer will be far, far better."
"Eric"
"A good beer but despite being decent all around, it's not something I would seek out again."
"Finish Slightly acidic, the beer is okay not great but okay."
"Tastes of caramel malt followed by a cidery fruitiness and then an odd vegetal flavor in the finish. The vegetal flavor lingers in the aftertaste. Medium bodied and just plain weird tasting. These flavors don't mesh well. Tough to get through this one. Pass."
"D - No thanks. It's not the hardest thing to choke down, but it is rather offensive. Very disappointing (and gross) after the rather exquisite Vanilla Porter."
"D - This was an easy drinking bock. I enjoyed it and I really like the name."
"d: Seems like a run of the mill bock. Caramel flavor is nice, but this beer is just too sweet."
"Appears a pale copper hue with fine white head decent retention going on lacing is fine and scattered with each sip. Aromatics bread yeast and caramel notes with mild herbal hops. Flavor sweet bread and caramel grains barely noticeable hop flow but so in the middle. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with an even smooth texture. Drinkability is okay but again nothing special."
"I bought this bottle at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"12oz. brown bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a clear dark gold with a thin off white head. Nice maltiness in the aroma with a hint of noble hops. That's about as good as it got. Flabby, caramel malt flavor, medium body. Some noble hop bitterness in the finish. Fairly drinkable. No defects, just another weak American attempt at a bock."
"drinkability - One of the better bocks I have drank in my young age."
"Overall, I really like Pandora's Bock, I would just like a little more body. I think it's worth buying and enjoying. It's a rather cerebral beer, if that makes any sense."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable - this is a nice offering from a brewery that has often put out some mediocre beers."
"Hey, this is a pretty good brew. Beautiful reddish-orange color, little to no head. Lovely, bready, malty taste, a little bit o' hops in there too. There's really something to be said for these Einbeck-style bocks... I love a good doppel as well, but this is such a highly drinkable alternative."
"Drinks alright, dryness kind of walks on some of the positives of this beer. This kicks the crap out of many pretend bocks (shiners, schell, abita & a few others), but there a better out there. Not sure what previous reviewers were drinking, but it has been a few years since this was reviewed so maybe changes were made???"
"A pretty average bock! Hazy orange in color with nearly zero head. Aromas favor toffee and sweet cream-some caramel and buttery notes as well. A bit sticky and gooey in the mouth, and at the same time rather dilute. Sticky raisiny sweetness provides a cloying note, and a not so pleasant fruity twang. Long cloying candied finish. Fun to try as long as you don't buy! Thanks for the freebie most gracious distributer. I've a great rep-really!!"
"This was not a bad brew, but there wasn't complexity to it. Rather one-dimensional and bland. I have had this one before and thought that there was a spiciness to it that I enjoyed. I must have been mistaken (or drunk at the time. That's been known to happen)."
"Pours a nice crisp, clear amber...excellent nose...sweet maltiness all the way...big bready notes...almost like coffee cake...toffee...caramel...really nice aroma...Very low carbonation creates a very smooth easy drinking moutfeel...almost a bit too flat though....not much for hops in this one...a good malty bock...on the taste I get mainly the coffee cake like bready notes...pretty unique and I like the flavor...not an all-time great but an enjoyable bock none-the-less...On the long, long finish a flash of bittering hops appears and then fades away..My biggest knock is the overflat mouthfeel...and the sweetness is almost cloying at times for a regular bock"
"dark copper color, no head and little carbonation.  dull caramel malt aroma and a touch of citrusy hops.  decent body and some malt back bone.  nice roasted caramel malt taste.  very smooth and drinkable.  if this had a bit more carbonation and aroma, it would be a very good beer.  within it's style, just slightly above average."
