"Color is an amber brown color. The taste is malty with a little nutty taste. There is a very weak smell and the mouthfeel is very weak. This beer is like most other saranac beers, if it were a pitcher it would be todd wellmeyer. It's a solid but it will not overwhelm you. If you do not like a malty roasty bock this would be for you."
"An interesting bock with enough flavor to satisfy my tastebuds."
"D  Overall its a pretty average brew, the mouthfeel dropped a couple of points on this one, as did the ethereal taste. Still, a much better beer than most Saranac offerings, and most other offerings youll find on the rack with it at your local grocery store."
"this beer has a nice golden hue with a nice sticky white head that has a nice lacing that sticks around. there is not a huge aroma from this beer but no unplesant aromas either. the flavor is very nice, not too hoppy and and has a nice almost smokey malt flavor. smoke may not be the right term but it has that feel. the body is medium and smooth very drinkable and enjoyable. This is a very solid very enjoyable beer to consume."
"out of a winter 12 pack. pours a medium amber with a two finger light tan head that held for a while then faded to just covering the beer with some thin spotty lace. fruity floral aromas with a big bready malt taste with a touch caramel and a slightly salty tasting finish. light mouthfeel with good carbonation. good session beer"
"overall this is an enjoyable beer not something i would seek out bet nice"
"One of the better beers in the winter sampler 12 pack but still not a particularly notable one. I wouldn't search this one out."
"Drinkability - Not a bad beer, worth a try I would say."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium amber with a one finger head, OK longevity and decent lace. Good caramel malt smells mixed with just enough hop aroma, although perhaps a bit much for a bock. Nice rich caramel malt flavors but a bit too much hop flavor/bitterness at the end - at least for a bock anyway. Good flavor though, better than the Black Diamond Bock IMO. A decent offering."
"Medium reddish-amber with a medium-sized, off-white, frothy, slowly-diminishing head. Some tiny particles floating around in it and the case wasnt old or mishandled, all other beers in the 12 Beers case were fine. Smell is of mild malt and very light fruit. Taste is mostly bready malt, with caramel and some hops showing up on the finish but mostly just to impart some bitterness. It has a medium-full body, dry texture and low carbonation. Overall, its not bad, just nothing special."
"F.X. Matt has delivered a beautiful beer in their Saranac Bock. From it's glowing orange-chestnut body and creamy tan head, to it's lingering finish, it's a winner! It offers a very nice appearance of slightly hazy deep amber and chestnut, with a crimson-orange cast and glowing orange and gold highlights. Good head retention. Good lacing. The beautifully malty aroma expresses a bit of toastiness and dark caramel as well as some floral, leafy, and spicy hops. In the mouth it's smooth with a lightly dextrinous body; and just enough very-fine-bubbled carbonation to give a gentle zest to the tongue. The flavor is well-balanced, and malty but not sweet. It's grainy, toffeeish, and caramelish; balanced by a firm bitterness, spicy and floral hops, and an underlying acidity. It finishes dry and floral with a spicy hop and alcohol accent. It's not the biggest, or the most malty, or even the most drinkable... but it is really well done and accessible with a decent amount of character. Worth trying!"
"It sort of reminds me of the Smuttynose Old Brown Dog ale. Now I wish my sampler didn't contain just one Bock!"
"I could probably drink these for a night if my choices were slim."

"Sure, you could drink the hell out of this, you might even like it, but there's no reason to settle for such an average beer."
"Beer is amber in color with a fair sized off-white head that has some retention and left a good amount of lacing. The aroma is mostly malt; caramel seems to come out the most but also a biscuit like property. The taste is mostly of malts, caramel again along with a roasted flavor that seems to go pretty well together and finishes with the lightest of hops as it is there a sec and gone the next. Over all this is a middle of the road brew, not something to write home about but not a bad offering, it is easy to drink."
"Drinkability--Not bad, I'd have another."
"A Bock that is too thin and lacking in flavor and mouthfeel for my taste. Not a terrible lager, but not 'well crafted' stylistically."
"A watered down bock with some flavor, but lacking in overall presence. Copper pour releases some bready malt aromas- not much different on tasting only with a slight bitter finish rounding out the profile. Not much here, but it is drinkable. Like most of saranac's offerings, it is a good intro to the style for those scared of better tasting brews."
"The beer pours an amber color with an offwite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a smooth, malty scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is decent. It has a dry, yet malty flavor that boasts of a mild crystal malt and not much else. It goes down easy and finishes with some residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent brew, but nothing too impressive."
"D: Drinkable, but I don't think this would be at the top of my list when ordering a brew. Nothing that blows me away--how come Saranac seems to be a pedestrian brewery?"
"Poured a copper color with a small tan head, dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. No real distinct aroma, slight malt not much hop detected. Slightly sweet malt taste, mild bitterness, again nothing distinct. This lager goes down easy, has a light body, moderately carbonated, crisp."
"Ovarall a decent bock. This one would go great with a pork roast dinner. A decent offering in the 12 beers of Christmas pack. Worth a try if you can pick up the mixed case."
"Pours a very clear bronze with copper highlights. Dense two finger head, off-white in color and holds a cap well, leaving spotty lace. Crystal and lots of pale malt in the nose, with a light noble hop aroma. Toasty Munich and Vienna maltiness upfront, followed by caramel and slight dextrinous taste. Hop profile is perhaps more assertive than appropriate, but the bitterness in the aftertaste really balances out this malty beer along with plenty of floral Hallertau and spicy Saaz flavor. The medium-full body and light carbonation exaggerate the rich malt character creating a heavier mouthfeel and lingering sweetness without cloying. Finishes residual with an evenly matched german hop acidity, allowing a good drinkability."
"Got this in the Saranac 12 Beers of Winter Sampler. So far this is the best of the bunch. I once tasted Wagners Sled Dog Dopplebock and really disliked the strong flavor and wasnt sure how I was going to like this bock beer when I saw the dark color. I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted it. It had a creamy mouthfeel, rich malty flavor and smooth finish.This was an excellent tasting lager and was much better tasting than Saranacs Adirondack Lager. I would like to see Saranac add this one to their regular lineup as well."
"Dark lager is the description and yes is a spring bock or doppelbock. It is closer to a doppelbock in color and a spring hybrid bock in flavor. Smooth chocolate overtones, malty nose, full body with very little IBU or hop bitterness. An adventurous enjoyable beer from Saranac."
"The drinkability was about average but i would have a few if i felt the need."
"This brew pours a very light brown color thats accented with a reddish hue. Its very clear, with a nice, albeit thin, white head. The aroma is of lightly toasted malt. The beer presents a significant sweet malt smell, but its richness and depth could be a little more intense. The beer is modestly sweet with a clean fresh bread crust flavor. The finish has a slight herbal bitterness. Appropriately, theres not much hop flavor in the beer. Medium body and fairly medium carbonation. This is a clean and drinkable bock. Although its respectable, there are a lot of better bocks out there."
"Cheers!"
"A fairly average Bock."
"Overall- The metallic aftertaste brings it down a bit but otherwise not bad!"
"Appears an amber hue with an off white toffee toned head hue leaves ample lacing all around my glass. Aroma has a nice warming biscuit malt with sweet caramel and evident herbal hops with a touch of metallic character. Flavor has a mild roasty caramel malt with more herbal hop flavors and light alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with even smooth carbonation I'm diggin their take on the bock not a bad brew. Drinkability is quality with six percent abv it has some flavor with some nice drinkability going on."
"Juicy caramel and toasted malts dominate the sip. Syrupy and sweet with a malty backbone. Smooth and a little creamy with a mini hop presence."
"pours maple syrup caramel brown. no head at all. you can definitly smell some kind of caramel sweetness. the taste is kind of as expected. very smooth, definitly some caramel notes. lacks a little in the mouthfeel, slightly flat tasting. but overall really good. of the three beers i've tried out of the sampler so far ( black forest, beligian ale, and bock) i would definitly rank this one second. the black forest is awesome. all in all decent, would like to maybe get a sixer of this."
"A nice middle of the road beer. Easy to drink."
"M&D - kind of flat, nice flavor and blend, but not completely satisfying, but not bad by any stretch of the imagination"
"D: Very drinkable with a moderate abv, this is a real star from the Winter case."
"Its nice to see a few new things coming from Matt even if they are not great,poured a medium broze color with a thinner quick to fade head.Muted aromas mainly caramel malt with a light toastiness,pretty thin mouthfeel for even a ""smaller"" bock like this not quite watery but not where you would want it to be either,somewhat sweet up front flavor wise definent caramel malt flavors a decent peppery hop profile comes thru late.A decent but subtle stab at a bock here its drinkable but lacks alot of character in my mind."
"D: Not bad. I'm usually not big on bocks, but I could do this again."
"Pours a clear amber/orange color with a thick, creamy head of tan bubbles. Light, sweet aroma. Noble hops come out more as it warms. First thing noticed upon sipping was a rather thin body. Flavors were on the light side as well. Biscuits and honey; grainy. Light bitterness in the aftertaste. Boring bock. Nothing offensive, but not up to the standards of others in this category."
"A new-found variety to me. Not that I hadn't seen them before, but only recently have I bought (and enjoyed) traditional Bock beers. Most of the others from Germany. I'd tried another rather popular ""Bock"" style (from a US brewery) and found it drinkable, but nothing to write home (or write BA) about. So this was a pleasant surprise to try a version from one of my favorite breweries. Incredibly rich color and head retention, with a nice malty flavor and richness, augmented by subtle carbonation. Just enough hops (even a bit more than expected) to balance the flavor while not detracting from the malt. My sample bottle came from my 12 Beers of Winter variety pack, but I'd buy this by the 6-er or the case if I could."
"12 ouncer that came in the latest Saranac sampler. No freshness dating on any of 'em. Pours pretty tame almond amber, so much for being a ""dark"" lager. Dark tan, larger bubble head, that leaves a smidge of lacing. Malty nose as was expected, smooth malty brew, notes of bread, yeast, maple. Drinkable , serviceable little brew. Nothing special, pretty typical, middle of the road Saranac offering"
"Overall a very solid bock. Very drinkable and sessionable. A very nice offering from Saranac."
"Poured 12oz bottle into a glass mug. Nice, dark lager. Deep amber color, with almost a tannish head. The smell of the malt immediately rises to the top of the glass after the pour with the malt hitting your lips as soon as you taste it. German style beer, with almost a dubbel taste. Nice, thick mouthfeel. Saranac's description of a ""rich full-bodied"" beer is right on the nose. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: another decent but not overwhelming beer from Saranac. A bit more maltiness in the flavor would bring it up a notch. Since it is milder this is an easy to drink bock."
"A solid beer. I poured from a 12 ounze bottle into a pint glass, and was suprised at how much less head i got from this than any others from Saranac. The smell was sweet yet not sweet. I know that doesn't make sense, but that's the best I can describe it. The taste was a good bitter taste, but not awful strong. It went down very smooth. Don't drink and review."
"A pretty decent beer considering Saranac's low price. Looks a touch light for a bock but still managed a pretty amber color with off-white head. I'm never quite sure how to describe bock flavor, but I know it when I taste it or smell it. The sweet, caramel and licorish-like malts are there, although not terrible rich. There's also a bit of a spicey, hot hops element to this brew. It seems Saranac has been uping their hops in a couple brews lately - awesome. Overall, not a bad beer for a the price. Tasty and very drinkable but no award winner."
"D: I'm sampling this from their Winter 12-pack, and I'm not sure if that's the only way to purchase it (I believe it is). This was honestly better than I expected. It's still milder than German Bocks, but it's not bad. I'd enjoy this again."
"Taste is caramel and toasty malt with a light bittering and some nutty tones in the finish. Some dextrin chewyness. Not bad as a medium-bodied lager, but it doesn't stand out."
