"The Belgian yeastiness is just what the traditional German bock style needs. On tap at The Public House in La Jolla, Calif."
""
""
"I really enjoyed this block beer and put it up there with Ayinger Celebrator, though it goes in a different direction."
"The fusion of styles is truly imaginative, classy and clever. The richer malt character complements the Belgian complexity in seamless fashion. It doesn't hurt that the brewing execution is also stellar."

"Overall: not a typical bock at all. The roasted malts are very different from most, and the cherry taste is very unusual. But, I really like this. Very interesting and balanced. La Trappe is the only trappist brewery who makes such a huge variety of beers. I think most of them are mediocre, and while is this not a perfect bock at all it's very interesting and really good in it's own way."

"M&D: the carbonation level comes almost perfect, not too lively, but ever so soothing and fine to caress the palate gently; the body is full even for the 7.0%abv. strength, never cloying, although the sugary content does leave a somewhat slick feel on the palate at the end of each sip. All in all, having had an ale version of bockbier this good, I wonder if I should pay the Netherlands a visit anytime soon(er)…! This ale is delicious, intriguingly balanced, and more-ish, as long as one can handle the alcohol and sugary content well, at one’s good pace."

"O: Very sweet, complex and nice. If your pleasure is hops and not malts - avoid! If not - this fantastic!"

"The amber-brown La Trappe is transparent, with a lightly-tanned neck, very well retained (perfect to style). The bready aroma displays very well the malty character of the beer, showing also caramel tones and alcohol content (perfect, again). The taste brings a well-carbonated, medium-body beer, with hops well harmonized with the malty body, the latter slightly sweet (once again, perfect to style). The end is somewhat long, bringing, again, the whole malt/caramel story. What an excellent beer!"
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, dark fruits, and brown sugar. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Too much carbonation."
""

"Overall an interesting beer with ups and downs. Nevertheless, certainly not to forget when talking about Dutch bockbier. A country that is full of the style around the dark times of the year."
""
"Overall: It's a peculiar concoction -- a trappist bock -- but I don't think it brings anything sublime to the table. It's tasty though, not a bad representative of a strongish bock."
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer. Still, I prefer the classic Belgian dark ales over bocks."
""
"The malts rule the taste as well, malty molasses giving the beer a rich, smooth feel and flavour. Most likely the best Bock I had while on the trip. Another bar was having a Bock Fest and had around 8 on tap, so I managed to try a few, as you do!"
"As I wrote before, this is the best bock beer I've tasted this far. I will surely get some more to drink during the cold days of autumn plus another couple to keep in my cellar."
""
"O - A great beer from La Trappe that is a take on a classic German style."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with mid-level carbonation that's a bit prickly on the tongue at first, but quickly levels off to create a crisp and well-flowing mouthfeel. Carbonation could be toned down just a bit and this would not suffer. Just a hint of ethanol in the nostrils and back of throat when closing out a sip. Finish is dry, with some stickiness left around the edges of the mouth due to residual sugars."
""
"Overall: A very enjoyable beer, if it wasn't for the price I'd happily have 3 or 4 in a sitting. I served mine straight from the fridge, which I wouldn't do next time. And there probably will be a next time - good, tasty beer, flavoursome but not overly complex. Would personally prefer this brewery's ales."
"Overall: I liked it but could have been better."
""
""
"Without doubt a nice bockbeer, and face it: the only trappist bock in the world."
""
""
"Drinkability: Very interesting beer; more than any other bockbier I’ve drunk. Perhaps a bit too sweet for some."
""
"This is a great beer for sessions. It is easily drank and has a good amount of flavor. The brew isn't too complex, however."
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear burgundy color ale with large off-white foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light residual sugar with some caramelized malt. Taste is a good mix between some caramelized malt with light toffee notes with some residual sugar. Boyd is about average but has a nice creamy texture with good carbonation. Easy drinking with nice level of complexity for style."

"A spectacular bock, lively and a joy to drink. La Trappe is doing it right."
"Very well made."
"This brew poured out with a nice deep amber brown color with a light tan colored head on it. The smell of the beer has a good amount of malts on the nose and even a touch of spice and yeast. The taste of the beer gives off a nice subtle caramel sweetness upfront that fades into a dry toasted flavor. There seems like there could be some autumnal spices in this as well but they're very faint. The mouthfeel is smooth and has a good amount of body too. Overall I really enjoyed this brew, I still enjoy their Quad the most but this is probably the next best thing La Trappe puts out."
"It certainly retained its carbonation nicely! I had about a finger of light-tan head that quickly fizzed its way out of existence. Color was a cola-brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich with a caramel malty sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a definite caramel taste on the tongue, almost a burnt caramel aspect. Finish was very sweet with the caramel flavor simply lingering well after the swallow. Wow! Bock at 0500 - I must not be working this summer. I would recommend this as more of a dessert beer than a wake-up beer."
"Overall, it's an interesting Belgian-style take on this German style. It definitely varies from traditional bocks that I remember with much more rich flavors. A solid 4.0 from me overall."
"T: sweet notes at the beggining, some toast malts are noticed at this moment, after that you get the warmer sensation comming from the alcohol, the caramel notes appear after this making a good mix of flavour, a clean falvour, no bitternes at all, the end is not long on toast flavour but is persistent, chewy end"
"O: Don't expect a traditional Bock Beer here. In fact, I think that the idea behind it was producing a Bock keeping the characteristics of a Trappist. I like it and really recommend it"
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, good but heavier representation of style, it’s a solid beer but not one of the first beers in the style that I would pick."
"O/D - Too yeasty IMO. I would never think of a Bock being that yeasty. Not enough fruity malt character giving it richness. Not bad, but falls short where it doesn't need to."
"O: Very nice, simple beer. I would enjoy another bottle or two of this in the cellar."
"It is a decent bockbier, and certainly interesting considering the brewery and location."
"M/D: A great bock .. or is it? The bottle label claims this beer is top fermented, so it seems almost unfair to compare to traditional bocks. Either way, this is a great beer that offers malt complexity that is well-balanced with hops."
"Exceptionally well made beer. Complex, smooth, and balanced. A sipper to savor and share. ... I've had this one a few times. Sometimes it has struck me, as this sample did, as really special. But I can also recall being underwhelmed. Not this time."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the strength of flavoring. It can be easy for a bock to come across as a dulled down little brother of a doppelbock, but here we find that all of that richness is preserved. There were heavy malts, with generously distributed sweet and roasty flavors, allowing this brew to compete as exemplary for the category."
"Drinkability: a solidly drinkable brew. I'm glad I found this one at my local bottle shop; a good, authentic bock like this is a treat."
"Tried it with a stake dinner, and it washed down amazingly. Tastes like a Leffe Brown, a bit heavy so you won't want to drink it for drinking (Like in a bar), you want it with dinner. Don't overdo it cause it fills you up, Just like a good Bock should."
"Wow. Never had this beer before. Never seen it. I think it will disappear magically or something, like a dream into the night. Because this is one of the greatest beers I have ever had. Evar."
"For the rest i can say the smell is good and warm, dito for the taste. A very well balanced bockbeer."
"Pours a deep copper/ brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty, rich, and fruity. In the taste, rich, nutty, and fruit hints. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry fruit like aftertaste. Nice flavor and aroma, hides the alcohol quite well."
"D - Very dark and heavy to drink. The taste is fairly distinctive being the only trappist beer of this kind but the bitter nature might not be to everyone's liking."
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a tan head. The aroma is brown sugar, yeast and caramel. The flavor is dark fruit (the main fruit I get is raisins) as well as brown sugar, caramel malt, alcohol and yeast. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad, but not too similar to a bock. It tastes much more Belgian than German."
"Pours a reddish brown color, with a huge foamy head. Leaves beautiful Belgian lace after a few minutes. The nose is malty and sweet, with light aromas of spice and dried herbs. Chocolate, caramel and raisin notes make more of a showing once the head dissipates. A sharp little kick of fruity yeast, immediately followed by the drying Hallertauer hops. An average example of the style, in no way a standout."
"Flavor is very nice! Not the best bock out there...but super solid and overall a great beer. Medium body, high carbonation, crisp, very low booze. Caramel notes, tons of fruit, and very malty...mixed with the Belgian yeasts...this is a very good beer! Thanks Damon again for bringing it over!"
"Nice beer."
"D: The beer is definitely filling but is relatively easy to drink because the alcohol is well masked."
"D - Wow. This is one fantastic beer. To date, this Bock is as close to perfection as I've come. Delicious!"
"Pours a dark russet with a dense tan head. The smell is sulfured molasses, swamp moss, fallen leaves, strong tea. The taste is heavy on the molasses, with caramel malts, something like blood sausage, and a graphite minerality in the finish the comes back around to the molasses. It's thick though not too viscous, heavy without being cloying. It's like no other bock beer I've had, and altogether excellent: I could have had another bottle. Seek this one out."
"Opinion: Well, I had pretty high expectations for this beer. It is good, but falls short of what I would consider ""outstanding"". The lack of malt in the finish really hurt this beer in my opinion. All that said, this beer really has a pretty good flavor and I will certainly drink the whole bottle...so it doesn't suck. It just reminds me on an amped up Tilburg more than a beer to stand up to Korbinian...or even Erdinger Ur-Bock if you want to stand it against a non-doppelbock."
"Drinkability is very good. I could have enjoyed another one. A nice beer for a cool evening."
"Notes: Also brewed with rey and wheat, after the example of the Jopen Bokbier, but a little sweeter than Jopen Bokbier."
"Overall: One of the best bock beers out there, maybe even THE best. Perfectly balanced bitterness and sweetness. But lets be honest, what else can be expected from a bock beer brewed by an authentic trappist..."
"D: WOW, this is a great bokbeer. This is so much better than their dubbel. Will surely stock some of these."
"I'd recommend this. A bockbeer within the trappist tradition, has a lot of interesting notes, is worth a try."
"This 25.4 oz/750 mL bottle was my second experience with Koninghoeven's offerings, and I was impressed with this Bock. The pour into a Hennepin (Ommegang) tulip glass produced a good, persistent, tan head with moderate stickiness. (The recently-acquired tulip glass really helped concentrate the odor - I highly recommend them!) The brown color, with strong red highlights, advertised a substantial beer experience. The odor was vaguely fruity, malty (surprise!), with bread toast overlays. The fruit character was hard to pin down; it was not estery or banana-like. The taste did not disappoint. Breadcrust malty flavors dominated, but a general, balanced fruitiness rounded out the primary flavor. As the beer warmed in the second half of the bottle, the fruit character hinted at apples and pears. the aftertaste had a tinge of roasted barley with coffee overtones, but it was neither dominant nor persistent. A tinge of hops and a hint of alcoholic heat helped keep this from being cloyingly sweet. The sticky, full mouthfeel was very pleasant. This beer is like a sip of autumn harvest. I enjoyed this Trappist selection very much and expect to purchase again in the future."
"Drink: My kind of beer, dark with lots of flavor. It's definitely something to enjoy slowly, with a meal or on its own. I'd have it again and no doubt will."
"Very easy drinking. The setting was nice and added to the experience."
"More malty chocolate on the palate along mild roasty coffee. Grassy hop bitterness is fairly assertive for the style. As in the nose, plenty of spice and even some anise. Above average drinkability and interesting flavor profile. Everything I look for in the style. Another great Trappist beer."
"M/D-This just floats off the tongue and begs to be sipped faster. I was very impressed with this one and was glad I got it. I would drink a keg of this if I could a good beer get one if you can."
"Drinkability: Quite nice to sip and easy to finish more than one at a sitting even though its 7% abv."
"I always love being blown away by beer of a style that isn't among my favorites. The label reads 'Taste the Silence'. That's a pretty good tagline. It doesn't apply, however, because Koningshoeven Bock makes beautiful music from the very first mouthful. Loud, yet refined. Just like I like 'em."
"A 750ml bottle, corked and caged, served in a pilsener glass. It was a medium brown color with a little bit of red. A voluminous tan head that looked like whipped cream. Caramel malt and dark fruit aroma. Caramel and raisin taste. Good malt background. A good beer for the price."
"Notes: Yet another in a long line of successful Trappist beers. Koningshoeven is certainly one of my favorite breweries in the world."
"Pours a three-finger cream/beige head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Deep red/mahogany color. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Malty, fruity nose. Flavor is malty, rich fruit, some caramel. No bitter aftertaste. Decent bock. $11.00 for a 750ml bottle from a Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME. La Trappe is not on the label anymore."
"CHEERS"
"Am I tasting the silence? I might actually be!"
"An exciting balance between a Trappist ale and the Bock style, more or less in the same line as for example the La Chouffe Bock."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a clear chestnut brown color with a huge khaki colored head that dissipated into a puffy cap and left nice lacing on the side of my dimple mug. The aroma is of dark toasted malt, with hints of red wine, and roasted meat. The red wine flavors dominate up front, with a touch of metal following, a solid toasted grain and bready malt backbone supports the sweetness. The feel is of a nice full body with active carbonation, chewy, finishes sweet. I do like the maltier bocks and this fits the bill. Good balance between the sweet and malt."
"Not a bad beer at all, but I'm not sure I'll be a regular quaffer of it. As it warms the booziness seems a little too much. It's hitting the spot well as I watch Obama's thankyou speech."
"I like it; I was skeptical, but I like it. Nice take on a German style that adds the requisite Trappist yeast (full head, creamy body), and more than enough hops to bring some balance to an occasionally malt-starring show."
"I was very surprised to see La Trappe launching a bock beer. I got it right away and tried it the same evening. La Trappe Tripple and Quadrupel are always high in my list of preference and I respect this brewery very much, so my expectations were very high but I got a little dissapointed. This is a very good beer indeed, but I was expecting something really exceptional. It has a very strong taste for a bock - a little too strong for me. But then, it is not a typical bock. There is a hint of Quadrupel in it, but perhaps it's just my idea. It has a well-balanced smell and a beautiful rich dark-brown kinda-red color. I would drink this beer as a delicacy, but not in large ammounts."
"taste of tin, watery, malt, some cocoa, touch of caramel, some spice."
"A good beer,it is just that I expected so much more from the Monks."
"Not remotely a bad beer, but expectations are higher for Trappist ales (or whatever this is). If you're going after Trappist in general or Koningshoeven in particular, then stick to the more traditional ale styles. And if you really want a great bock, then the Germans (or even Gordon Biersch) can hook you up more cheaply and satisfyingly."
"A decent brew, but well under the usual high quality of Koningshoeven. I will keep my Koningshoeven buys with the more traditional trappist styles."
"A very pleasant drink even if it is a tad bit too sweet. Gonna try this one again for sure! Recommended!"
"I had this as the Koningshoeven Bock, which came in a different wrapper than the La Trappe, but I'm assuming it is all the same. The beer pours the thickest, frothiest, well retained head that I've seen on just about any beer. This is the thickest, chewiest, full bodied bock you're likely to find. The taste was strong brown sugar, molasses, caramel malts. There are plenty of roasted malts and brown malts to accompany the sweet molasses and sugars found in this beer. The beer is complex, made with a number of different malts and hops combinations listed on the label, and the taste is just robust. There is a bit of a throaty aftertaste and the ABV isn't hidden all that well, but there are plenty of warming notes that do make it interesting. The beer is complex, thick, husky, and a very memorable bock style beer. Worth looking for. L'Chaim."
"Not really in my price range, but it went down like it was on someone else's tab. :)"
"D: Quite drinkable."
"Tapped at Abbot On the Hill. A great haul for them. Pours an active dark brown with white crown. Bold malt, and yeast aroma, including chocolate malt. Carbonation, natural, does not quit. In your face taste,a bit rochfort/cocacola caramel like, some nutmeg. Overall not too complex, good drinkability."
"Pours a very dark brown with a massive head, several inches of fluffy stuff, very nice lacing, a lovely beer. The aroma has nice caramel and roasted feeling, some fruits, with a definite lager nose with a Belgian 'feel' to it. More spices from yeast in the taste and again a nice sweetness. The mouth is a bit carbonated for an otherwise slick, smooth feel, but good body keeps it real. Pretty decent, but I probably paid too much for it. One and done, I'll be keeping to the beers they're known for."
"pretty drinkable for me because i like hops, but it's probably over the top for bock purists."
"Poured with a nice head and some lace. Very ahcoholic aroma. decent dark wood color. Not as sweet as I would expect in a bock. Give 'em credit for distinction though. Full mouth filling body. Slightly unpleasant bitter finish. Not one of my favorites. Some odd stuff going on here. Can't recommend it. The score I give is me trying to be objective; subjectively would a been much worse."
"More ""bock"" flavors and aromas show up as it warms.. but the Belgian notes are still there... I really like this beer no matter ""what"" style it is."
"drinkability is great. this is an excellent bock with a few things to call its own (namely the subtle roasted character and the semi-dry finish). altogether, wow! what a bock, i say, what a bock! this is one that will be frequented by this beeradvocate. cheers!"
"Cheers and beers dude!"
"One of the better bockbiers from Holland."
"Without doubt a nice bockbeer, and face it: the only trappist bock in the world."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"will seek this out again for sure. right up there with the trappist belgians by koningshoeven."
