Taste is comparable to the aroma, with a malty sweetness matched by just enough hops to lend balance. The amalgam precipitates a slight, cherry-like tartness near the back end that's the closest thing to complexity this brew has to offer. The mouthfeel is light, perky, and drinkable--probably the best thing this beer has going for it. This ultimately comes off as a safe and nondescript bock, which is less than desirable for a style I already find to be pretty underwhelming.","MaximalC","Mar 14, 2013"

Fresh-cut hay, ripe apple orchard and fresh-baked dark bread fills the nose. Lagered smoothness unleashes a re- freshing crispness in the medium body. Sweet, toasted, bready maltiness is the tune this brew is singing, a broad reach from caramel to toasted pie crust to biscuits. Modest hopping stretches far enough to balance and leaves some oily herbal flavor in the drying, malty end.

This is one of those few beers where the taste and the mouthfeel are so tightly knit that you can't really review them separately. Dark fruits and dark bready malt float on top of dry, fluffy, airy carbonation; superbly drinkable; hints of bread crust, a dash of cocoa powder, and a faintly earthy figgy note. The hops only show up in person for a flash on the fading finish, leafy and floral, preferring to spend the rest of the time providing that fantastic, dry, ultra clean, light sensation that counterbalances the malt body. Really unique. The flavor profile really is subdued, and I'd rate it lower if it wasn't so well done and didn't feel so, well, right. Top to bottom, a beautiful beer.

The flavor is mostly caramel with some faint hints of dark fruit. The flavor is just not very interesting or complex. The body feels bigger that it is and is nicely carbonated.

4.23,11.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"This new seasonal from New Glarus is a must try for New Glarus fans. It pours a dark brown color and has that familar bock smell to it. This beer starts out with a semi strong bock taste but finishes very nicely with little after taste. Pretty smooth and nice flavor, definetly a good taste for the price.","Lemke10","Oct 20, 2010"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Moderately low carbonation, the mouthfeel is medium bodied and nice and smooth overall. Back 40 Bock is easy to drink, with very clean malt flavors and not it's not too strong making it a nice sessionable beer for fall. Much as I suspected: not as good as Uff-Da but far tastier than Cabin Fever.","Soneast","Oct 16, 2010"
