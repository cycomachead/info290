"Bit of a letdown.  Its trying to be a Bock style of beer, IMHO despite what the label says. I believe the caramel flavor is fake, or ""enhanced.""The flavor dissipates across the palate nicely. Sweetness is adequate,  low end of carbonation scale, and initial mouthful is pleasing and fruity. Just not rich enough in body and not satisfying enough. Note:  I lived in Germany for about 10 years and have sampled many beers in this genre...so without trying to sound like a snob, I speak with some perspective."

"Fluffy sticky eggshell coloured head, nice trailing on the glass as it recedes, gorgeous deep amber/light reddish color, gentle carbonation, clear as a bell. Sweet malty nose, lots of breadiness and a light whiff of caramel with a subtle hop flower backing. Bittersweet with great balance of the two. Perfectly balanced with the hops, neither dominates..makes for a smooth easy drinking Lager. Finishes long and strong, this is a great example of the style and worth looking for."

"First time I've tried a beer from Holsten. Not much going on in this beer, but it wasn't too bad."

"O - A tasty bock and a pleasant surprise from this brewery. Te flavors fit the style, but there's a few tweaks needed to make to push this into the next category for points."

"Again, not a bad brew from Holsten and worth a try."

"O/D - A touch sweet and unstructured with some off bits, but alot better than expected. Some nice complexity hanging around with some rich malt character. Not bad."

"It's okay, better than the Maibock, but certainly not among the best bocks I've encountered. But if getting sloshed Oktoberfest-style is your aim, you could do worse!"
"UPDATE: Dammmnnn. Be sure to drink this beer cold! My last two mouthfuls warmed up while I was writing the review, and now it tastes like STRONGLY fermented athlete's foot."
"For a cheap bock or high ABV single can that's easy to find even in liquor-board-controlled areas of Canada, this isn't too bad, but I'd never specifically look for it. Doubt I'll get it again."
"Drink - The beer had some promise when I first poured it into my glass. The appearance is actually pretty good. But the taste is just dreadful.. it's almost undrinkable. Life is too short to spend time drinking beers like this one."
"""Holsten Festbock"" stands as one of my favorites in the local liquor store. It has a nice dark color, an excellent creamy head and a very smooth taste. I am surprised at the low price of this brand. Overall it feels like a beer that you would be served in a nice pub to accompany your meal. I have chosen on almost every occasion to drink this brand."
"Pours a dark reddish-orange, with a finger of brown head that fizzles like cola to nothing. No head retained, no lace. Nose of dark bread, mild dark fruits, touch of roast, sweet malts. Taste follows, more dark bread again with the sweet malts. Light, dry and dark fruits float around as well, relatively indiscriminate. Some alcohol in the finish, but a fairly reasonable mouthfeel overall. Good drinkability for the alcohol content, and often a decent choice at the LCBO in lieu of some of the other subpar offerings always found there."
"EDIT: Consumed on 11/17/10, can poured into a beer mug. Bottom on can dated 05/2011 and found the sweet malt well balanced. As with everything, the time and place affect your perceptions :). OTOH I found the carbonation to be too low, affecting mouthfeel negatively."
"Pours a nice dark red brown with a decent head thats gone very quick and weak lacing. Good Carbonation and nice caramelized taste to it with some grains and a slightly roasted taste. This beer goes down very well for a strong beer and at only 7 percent ABV its drinkability is pretty good. aftertaste is pleasant and the overall experience is pretty good too :)"
"Medium body and carbonation. A little sweet for a big session, but better than the maibock in that regard. A 500ml can of 7% is not to be taken lightly. Another one of my fave winter brews though."
"Overall great beer. Saw the thread on beer brats and decided to make my own. Half this can is in the pan as we speak."
"D - at 7% ABV the alcohol is noticeable but not unpleasant, the flavours are strong but the do balance somehow, a decent offering"
"for cheap high test this is pretty good, I seem too remember not liking the Maibock as much as this but I'll have to go back and check my review"
"Deep copper red with a large and fast dissipating tan head. No lace. Weak caramel malt, bread, and raisin aroma. Sweet toffee flavour with a little bit of raisin and a mild bitterness to the finish. There's a slight antiseptic character as it warms that I find unpleasant. Almost medium bodied with low carbonation. Syrupy but slightly thin mouthfeel. Mediocre. Finished it, probably wont buy it again, definately wont recommend it."
"I haven't had too much like this, so perhaps I'd get more out of it if I were used to the style, but I wasn't particularly impressed with this beer."
"Drinkability? Naaah. I'd go for one at a time. A wierd beer that has it's pros and cons; I respect it, but I really wonder if I would ever buy one again?"
"This is my third and last ever beer from Holsten. I'd rather drink from a toilet."
"Holsten Festbock is certainly nothing to celebrate. The only people rejoicing here will be those who enjoy high octane, moderately tasteless beers that provide a quick, relatively cheap means of getting alcohol to the brain. It would seem to me, given its entire lack of distinguishing or redeeming qualities, that that's exactly the kind of people for whom this beer was brewed. Unless you're part of that crowd I'd recommend a pass on the festivities."
"Overall Drinkability: The moutfeel supports chugging, the taste grows on one, and I would probably drink it slowly if I was in for an interesting time. I wouldn't seek this out, but I wouldn't refuse it if offered."
"i would get it again."
"Refreshing enough, and pretty tame on the booziness quotient for the style, which is a good thing in my estimation. Simple, sure, but at 3 bucks or so a can (which around here is a dealio, yo), you get your basic style and money's worth, for certain."
"D- I think with the higher alc/vol, this would be a great beer to enjoy over a long timeframe, but it would definitely have it's consequences. It's not a great beer, but rather a decent one. I will probably buy this again when out with friends sometime."
"The taste further confused me, and I don't want to say that this beer is complex, it's not really. Sweet sugary malt reminded me of splenda or some artificial sweetener. Blueberries, raspberries, some dark fruits and chocolate were subtle. Alcohol."
"Kind of an odd taste. Starts with a nice dark chocolatey taste, very rich, a bit of berries. Something not quite right about it, though. Kind of a metallic twang. Cough syrup, maybe? Leaves behind a toasty, chocolatey taste. It's good overall, but there's just something odd in there. Surprised I can't taste the extra alcohol, maybe that's why the winos like it. Heavy mouthfeel, but ultimately smooth. Pretty drinkable, but I bet these things would sneak up on you pretty quickly."
"Cheers"
"Got thiis 500ml can at the nearby Supermercado Carrefour here in Recoleta, Buenos Aires last week and trying it now. Poured with a big tan head that quickly faded to a hint of head and barely any lace. Dark mahogany color. Aroma is dark sweet malt and dark ripe fruits. Flavor is very similar. Shallow. Bit watery in spite of the heavy sweet malt.They're definitely not brewing this for flavor or aesthetics. Might be fun to add a vinegar culture to it since it's an all malt product. Finish is.... not worth coming back to."
"Worth a try. Definitely an after supper sipping beer given it's high booze content."
"Drinkeability - sticky sweet finish and off-putting flavour really limit this brew's potential."
"Final Thoughts - All in all, this beer would be a welcome alternative to a stout. It really needs a bit more carbonation and maybe a touch less richness but all in all I'd grab another if it was cheap or on tap. Definitely an excellent nursing beer, whose high alcohol I personally feel only improves it's resume."
"My pour got me a finger of light-tan head with decent retention. The color was a deep, dark, cola-colored brown with little light penetration. The nose had a caramel/licorice scent. The mouthfeel was medium with a lot of anise and chocolate on the tongue. The finish had a sweetish/chocolate-smoky quality. Yum!"
"Pours a dark reddish brown, thin tan head dissipates quickly but leaves a bit of lacing. Smells of sweet roasted malt, dark fruit, with a little bit of alcohol. Taste is similar, with malt up front, followed by a slight hoppy sour taste. Medium carbonation, smooth body. The alcohol is well hidden, so the high ABV can sneak up on you. Goes down nicely, so I had to remind myself of the percentage before I cracked open my second of the night."
"I tried this beer on January 3, 2008 after purchasing from a Toronto LCBO outlet. The beer poured a translucent dark brown colour with a thin tan coloured head. The aroma was malty with some sweet and spicy tones. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with high carbonation. The flavour was dry, malty, a bit spicy, and a little hoppy finish."
"Good carbonation, easy on the mouth. Nice and drinkable despite the ABV. Not a bad beer - better than the Maibock."
"Not bad, I guess."
"D:	I was pleasantly surprised by this beer since the last thing from Holsten I tried was their Maibock (I was not as impressed with that one). I could definitely down a few of these and I look forward to my next one."
"This one I'd actually drink again, although I'd probably purchase it solely for a food pairing since it's not a common style here."
"Brown pour with an off white/light tan head. some lacing on the side of the glass. Some sweet malt in the aroma. A very straightforward combination of sweet malt flavors and a little bit of hops. Not complex, kind of like a dumbed down Spaten Optimator. I am not sure if I would call this an altbier. It seems to belong more in one of the bock/doppelbock/dunkel categories because of its malty profile. Not bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to look for this beer again."
"D- not a bad beer, its drinkable, i wouldnt pass it up if offered to me but i would not buy it again."
"Roasted barley vied for attention with a metallic twang, though the metallic taste subsided as the beer warmed a bit and black licorice and a subtle port flavour came through. Overall, the taste was a little muted, but pleasant. The carbonation and mouthfeel were middle of the road, which neither hurt nor helped."
"Not bad at all, I'm not sure about it falling into the altbier style, it seems to be a bit hard to classify."
"This beer is somewhat odd, but I did enjoy it though."
"I like a decent dark beer, but I don't understand this one scored as high as it did. Just macro brown stuff. No thanks."
"Santé"
"This stuff tastes pretty good. The flavors comes to me in the following order: sweet, malty-hoppy, alcohol, a very slight dark fruit flavor, and then sweetness at the very back of the tongue. Barely-present sulfurous taste. (edit: new can i'm drinking now has no hint of sulfur) The beer is probably a 6/10 on the heaviness. Despite the moderately high alcohol, I feel this would make a stellar session beer, if you are any good with timing."
"D: I would have another, if you are buying. In the meantime, there are many other beers to try before returning to this one."
"It won't be long before I drink this beer again."
"Overall, this beer has it's flaws, in terms of strong beer I find it better then Maibock. Would recommend."
"Clear and very dark with ruby highlights. The short beige head produces a bit of lace and settles quickly to a thin cap. Malty, toffee aroma with plenty of sweetness and a hint of licorice. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Sweet and malty with mild bitterness that lingers in the finish. There's quite a bit of licorice here as well. Off-dry finish with slight warming. Not a bad beer at all. The licorice character was a little unexpected, but quite nice."
"This dark brew poured with a finger thick head, smell is rather metallic, not the most appetizing but there are worse smells. Taste is smooth, slight bitterness with a malt undertone. Mouthfeel is unoffensive and the smoothness makes it pretty good to drink. The high ABV is well masked, but this can be dangerous. Overall this isn't a bad beer at all."
"Pours a very dark brown with nice ruby highlights and a one finger dark tan head that dissipates fairly slowly and leaves little lacing. Smells unremarkable, some hoppiness overlying a malty background. Taste, however, is a whole different ballgame. Chocolate and licorice dominate, with burnt malts and caramel coming through as well before a bitter finish with more chocolate and some hops. Mouthfeel is thick and rewarding, but a bit syrupy, and drinkability is very nice. Surprisingly good, given the very reasonable price."
"D - Very drinkable. Overall, quite good, although the lackluster smells detract from the experience."
"A beer readily available in many liquor stores here, and another one I somewhat overlooked far too many times because it was in the ""import 500ml can"" area in liquor stores. Again, though, this is a great brew. Poured a mollasses brown from the green 500ml can, with a little head that only remained as a ring around the edges. Sheets of lacing that move quickly. The aroma, for me, is the best part of bocks. Ahh...malty sweetness. Some cola, mollasses, caramel, some wood smells, a little chocolate, and some prunes. Dusty, thick malts is the aroma, and I love it. Lactose, subtle cream, licorice, and red wine. I absolutely adore the aroma. The taste is a little thin, maybe a little too watery, but still flavourful. Dark malts, cola and rootbeer, with some licorice in the finish. Not overly complex, but sweet and fortifying: a great winter sipper. There is a taste of tree sap or wet wood too--somewhat hard to describe. The mouthfeel is quite light, with medium carbonation. An absence of any strong alcohol flavours and a soft mouthfeel rate this high for drinkability. Give me these all winter night. Nothing overly exciting here, but this is still a tasty beer in its category."
"Pours a dark, almost opaque colour with a slight reddish tinge. Looks almost like Dr. Pepper. Nice fizzy head, but it subsides to a slight lace very quickly. Smell is almost non-existent, just a very slight maltiness. Taste is really quite pleasant, lightly hopped, nearly no bitterness to speak of. Roasted malts are quite prevalent, like a mild stout, still though, not much in the way of complexity. Perhaps some mild cherry/plum flavours, but in the background. Nice bite on the tongue, alcohol is well hidden, slides down real easy. This is really a very drinkable beer, although a bit sweeter than I usually like."
"Black in color, dark red in the light. Nice tan head fades too quickly. Smells skunky like a Rolling Rock or something. Hay, horse blanket, barnyard smells too. Very light bodied with a clean finish. Taste is peaty and sweetish. Surprisingly drinkable. And at 7%, enough to be dangerous. Very graceful alcohol."
"Overall-is this a true altbier? More like a dark double bock. And not a bad one either. Definitely worth a try."
"This has become my winter beer. It is full bodied & full flavoured. It is a very malty beverage, with just enough bitterness to remove any cloying sweetness. It is a little darker, and not as sweet as a Salvator."
"It's an interesting beer. Not mind-blowing, but interesting."
"Pours an almost black color with some dark rum glints. The head is tan and rocky, leaving decent lacing. The aroma is toasted bread, raisins, plums and hop bitterness. The taste is a nice toasty malitiness with plums and anise notes. Theres also a nicely perceptable hoppiness. the ABV of this beer definitely makes itself visible, it tastes stronger than other beers of this ABV. The mouthfeel is thick and well carbonated. This is quite a good beer though definitely too strong, rich and crisp to be an Alt, Id say this is a bock lager."
"Can: Poured a dark brown beer with a nice above average head with good retention. Aroma is a mix of malt and mild sweetness. Taste was quite nice with some smooth malt and a subtle sweet finish with a good banana taste at the ends. Alcohol is well hidden which is always nice. The thin body and the subtle watery aftertaste was bit of a letdown but overall, I think this was a nice offering from a macro brewers  a bit underrated I feel"
"Canned...poured a dark clear chestnut red...smallish tan head, aromas of spices and sweet malts. Smooth mothfeel...nice mellow malt body...sweet(but not cloying) uncomplicated taste and a cleanish finish with a sweet doughy after taste...not a bad simple bock from a German mega brewer...fairly satisfying."
"This is a good example of a mass produced German lager that does not suck. The beer is dark and sufficiently malty to make me glad I didn't buy a Heineken dark. This beer will never be a favourite but for the price of $2 a can it is not too shabby. I could have done with more balance and deeper flavour but I go to Ayinger or Paulaner for their fest beers for the best quality."
"An enjoyable beer, but so middle-of-the-road average it hurts. I won't recommend it to anyone, but I won't turn down an offer either. A sidenote: in the Ruhrgebiet area of Germany altbier was usually suggested as served with cola. First thing I thought of when I poured this."
"Thx"
"A very dark brown, smooth, strong ale. A pleasant and inviting light brown head. Wonderful high quality candy smell (does that make sense?) that is very friendly (I hate candy!) and tasty. A little thin in the mouth but very comfortable and down she goes. Its hard to peg: nothing fancy but it went well with my lunch! I'd drink this again but, ya know, its almost too smooth. Got to go so I can finish this beer."
"From a 500ml can with the freshness date stamped on the bottom. What a dark ale, a deep mahogany, decent beige head that fades to a ring with minor lacing. Smells of faint roasted hops and a fair amount of licorice. I like that, I've brewed a couple of licorice ales in my time, but have never come across a commercial equivalent. The flavour is malty and boozy, a bit of licorice, somewhat watery for the abv, but goes down easy. An average strong beer, nothing that really wows me, but drinkable nonetheless. A few of these could go down easily and lead to trouble."
"An average bock beer that is decent but not one of my favorites."
"I don't really taste the 7% alcohol which is good however I probably need to partake more in this style of beer to develop a taste and appreciation for it."
"I'm a fan of the bock concept with the Doppelbocks (Aventinus and Celebrator) clearly leading the ways in my book, but with the price of those at 2-4 times higher, Holsten's is a nice alternative when you've already got the important money wrapped up in the ""premium"" brews."
"This beer was a major surprize in a positive way. The appearance when poured left a lot to be desired. The appearance seemed heavy and syrupy. But it was not...the body was full with a glass clinging light foam. The taste is well balanced with an almost almond flavour. Mouthfeel as well was above average."
"An impressive brew.  not sure if I got the right style.   It's a strong dark german ale.  Not too heavy or thick, with a strong nutty taste  The alcohol content, though high, was well masked and I was actually quite surprised when I noticed it on the can.  The drinkability I had to downgrade because of the morning after, to rub that in I had 24 hour train ride.  I quite liked the taste however, and if the circumstances of my first experience were better, I would be  sure to make this a regular of mine."
