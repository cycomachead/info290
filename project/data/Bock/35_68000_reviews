"O: I'm not really sure about this one, but it does not strike me as being bad in any way. I suppose this is kind of a mediocre offering overall."
""
"It sort of tastes like cherry coke, but worse.  Not interested in having this again."

""
"3.36/5.00"
"Overall:  This is a very nice beer, though with the strong flavors of cherry, dark chocolate and caramel, it is much more suited to be a desert beer and/or paired with desert as opposed to a sit down and have a beer/session beer.  I do like the strong flavors of cherry and chocolate."
"V - Low, as far as I know, is only available in the winter seasonal sampler pack."

"(O)- The smell is glorious. Too bad the rest of the beer is not up to par."

"Taste- Starts with strong cherry with chocolate background, then chocolate dominates the middle and finishing with a long, odd chocolate cherry roasty finish. Overall a decent brew but nothing like the Sammy Chocolate Bock made with Scharffen Berger chocolate in 750 ml bottles. This reminds us of cheap cherry-chocolate candy by Russel Stover."

"12 ounce bottle, enjoy before March 2014. It's a bit dated, so we'll see how it is. Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown with some ruby red tints. There's also an inch light tan head that stays around for a while. There's a small amount of lacing. The brew mostly smells like cherries, along with some chocolate, cola and plums. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some molasses and a slight medicinal flavor. Also, the chocolate is more noticeable in the flavor of this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy with low/moderate carbonation. I thought it was a good enough brew, definitely worth a try if you've never had it before."

"Beautiful in a glass. deep rich color, the cherry taste seems powerful at first and then the chocolate takes over. This may be a bit too much as a dinner beer, but better as a dessert beer. Or just as dessert. Rich and full bodied. Good with red meats, particularly grilled."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a fan of this beer and had a hard time drinking it. It tasted like a flat cherry coke with cough syrup. Cherry flavor was too strong."
""
""
""
"This beer looks like any good stout when poured into a glass, with an almost entirely opaque brown-black color and a modest tan head. Even with the word ""cherry"" in the name, the aroma is surprising and intriguing with how much it reminds me of a freshly opened jar of maraschino cherries. The gimmicky cherry addition doesn't work with the flavor profile, though, with the sweet/sour of the cherries conflicting with the roasted malts and bitter cocoa. The texture is surprisingly light, but the sugary sweetness still makes it a bit syrupy. Overall, the addition of cherries to this recipe is strangely alluring, but the gimmick wears off quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Sam Adams missed the mark with this one. I really liked the chocolate bock last year but adding the cherry just messed it up. Too sweet and artificial tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I was a few sips in and really didn't even want to finish it."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a mug. Pours black with a one finger slightly off white head. Smells of cherry syrup, much like cough syrup. Tastes of some dark roasted malt and coffee but with a syrupy cherry aftertaste, quite artificial. Beer is light bodied good carbonation. Overall an ok beer."
""
""
"Overall/Comments: CCB is a solid offering that I would classify as a dessert beer because of the extremely sweet nature of this beer. In my opinion if this beer have had more of a sour cherry flavor it would have been a very good offering however it is overly sweet for me as is. Consumed 12/17/2013. Classified as a Bock @ 5.8% ABV."
""
"Overall: A good beer for the chocolate cherry lover but a little too much cherry and sweetness for me."
""
"O: Not the worst beer, but definitely synthetic and sugary. Tastes as described, and pretty much as expected, but I did not enjoy this one."
""
"O:Phenomenal beer, I was so blown away by the flavor of this beer, if you don't like chocolate cake with cherries in it, don't bother, but if that sounds good to you or you're familiar with the black forest cherry torte (search that recipe and you won't regret it) and are a fan you definitely need to check this out. I sat in a chair just beside myself wondering where I had been and how I could get an unlimited supply of this beer. Goes down easy and tastes like candy (not really) Mr. Koch won't you send me a barrel?"
"The taste is crisp and clean and very refreshing. The fruit is nicely subdued. This overall is a great special ""holiday"" beer. I hope we see it again next year."

"much better than their other fruit beers"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Drain pour, its really bad, sams is usually good but I often hate their synthetic flavored fruit beers. Stay away unless you enjoyed cranberry lambic."
""
"Tastes exactly like a tootsie pop. You will never be able to drink this beer again without thinking about the previous sentence. Regardless, interesting and complex flavor. I think it's a polarizing beer, which makes it a bold move by Sam Adams. There's no middle ground, either you like it or you hate it. I, thankfully, enjoyed it. Definitely something I would only drink in the winter though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I guess this is a polarizing beer, some people love it. I downright hated it. I took several sips from it and couldn't get past that. It came with the Winter seasonal mixed pack and to be honest I was skeptical to begin with because I don't really like cherries and this one is loaded with that sour cherry taste. If you like chocolate covered cherries that are sour then you might like this. Its was the worst of both worlds to me. It was a bad dark beer mixed with a bad cherry Lambic or something like that. I just felt this was one of the worst beers I have ever tasted. But, to each his/her own, someone may love that about it. I am not enamored by this one. I do like most of this breweries beers that I have tried. They are not overly wonderful, but this one was just nasty."
"Overall: I wasn't expecting much from this beer, but I had it for dessert one night and was pleasantly surprised. It's a nice beer to have when you want something sweet. I wouldn't really have more than one in a sitting, but it is a nice change of pace."
"I had this beer for the first time over the weekend at a friend's vacation house. I'm one to try new things, and I'm definitely glad I tried this. It literally did taste like chocolate cherry cake- it was amazing. It had a great smell, the packaging was bright and eye-catching, the taste was amazing- the cherry was definitely noticeable, but not overpowering (I don't like cherry much to begin with) and the chocolate was certainly present as well, but not overly sweet. Would definitely drink this again!"

"Serving type: Ommegang Game of Thrones Chalice"
"Feel: medium body with medium-light carbonation."
"Split a bottle of this and was pleasantly surprised. Dark brown color, almost black. Aroma was cherry and chocolate. Flavor was very much like a cherry cola, uncanny really. I liked the flavor of this but not sure if I would want a whole bottle let alone a six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this. It's a bit like a cherry cola, not only in looks. However, it really is delicious. It's simple enough: both smell and taste are chocolate and cherry. I would definitely get this again."
""
"A three-finger tan head graces the top of this dark ruby brew. A waft of maraschino cherries and milk chocolate bursts from the bottle upon opening, and is even more apparent once poured. My initial excitement is quickly dampened, however. The feel of the beer in the mouth is a bit thin. The same can be said of the taste. Cherry syrup and chocolate mousse dominate the pallet but are watered down. Much like the disappointing false promises of light pudding or diet soda, the brew lacks something and does not completely immerse me in an illusion of cherry, chocolatey goodness. I will grant you something, though, Samuel Adams: there is cherry and there is chocolate. Add a little texture, a fuller body, and call me back."
""
"Overall this is a tasty and fun beer to drink; if it weren't quite so candy-like I'd probably drink it up, but after a couple of these things it gets a bit overwhelming. I really like what they were doing with this beer, though, and would love to have more of them in the future."
""
"Deep dark maroon color with moderate head and what appears to be moderate carbonation. You can really smell the chocolate cherry aroma. Really smooth. The cherry and chocolate flavors blend perfectly. I drank most of this before I realized what happened. Flavor is dead on and so is drinkability. Finishes as great as it starts. However, we didn't discern any maltiness, just a balanced chocolate and cherry flavor."
"Good on a cold winters night and after a big dinner."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I would not hesitate to buy this if they came out with a 6 pack."
""
""
""
"A combination of two Sam Adams lesser beers resulting in another lesser beer. A bit artificial tasting and too sweet."
"I am not going to go in to an in depth review with this one. I was not impressed. There was basically a large undertone (yes, that is an oxymoron) of artificial cherry in this one. The syrupy cherry extract was all that was noticed in this one. There were some stout/porter underpinnings, but the cherry drove the bus. Not a fan of this one or any of the Cherry iterations from Sam Adams."
""
""
"O: Overall thought the original chocolate bock was fairly decent with a rich chocolate base, this seemed like a decent beer combined with the cherry wheat to come up with a compromise of the two in terms of drinkability and enjoyment. Think this is at best a C+ beer, decent but wouldnt go as far to claim its good other then a supplement to a variety package for a first try."
""
""
"Overall a tasty and different one from SA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, what can I say, I guess I am partial to the vegetable/fruit types of beers because this Sam Adams blew me away. The last offering from the company wasn't so good, but this one might very well be the best I have had from Sam Adams. The only down points were it's head , no staying power or lacing, and I tasted a bit more cherry than the chocolaty malts promised - but oh boy, was it goooodddd...."
""
"O) Pretty good brew. The cherry aroma can be a bit much but the appearance and mouthfeel make up for it."
"Poured a deep, dark brown with little light coming through and a thin ring of off-white head. It looks quite nice. Scent dominated by maraschino cherry aromas with hints of chocolate. Very sweet, cherry chocolate indeed, but very one note. Taste follows the aroma. A lot of sweet chocolate upfront, moving into more maraschino cherry flavors. A bit of a creamy flavor in the background throughout. Finish is sweet with more cherry flavors and some chocolate. Aftertaste is mostly sweet chocolate. A very sweet flavor profile, very much a dessert beer, but not a very complex one. Its a good combination of flavors if you like chocolate and cherries. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with high carbonation that cuts down the smoothness of the body quite a bit. Still quite easy to drink and with a nice feel, though maybe a bit too soda-like. Overall this is a decent dessert beer, quite sweet, but there is nothing wrong with it at all. It could do with being a bit more beer-like instead of chocolate covered cherry-like, but overall its not bad. Its smooth, drinkable and pleasant enough. My only large complaint is that the carbonation is a bit too high and it could do with more bock in this bock beer."
""
""
""
"I certainly hope that SA either goes back to the basic Chocolate Bock for the 2014 version or pulls out the old recipe for another attempt at the Chocolate Cherry Bock."
""
"O - While the original SA chocolate bock is better, the addition of cherries this year resulted in a sweet bock that is pretty good as its own thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I certainly wouldn't buy a 6 pack full of the stuff, but it's pleasant enough. I like it much better than the Cherry Wheat."
"O: This is a nice variation on their Chocolate Bock, though I do prefer the original. Damn close to cloying, but it works nicely as light dessert beer."
""
""
""
"Very dark brown with only a hint of red around the edges a thin khaki head doesn't last long but laces nicely. Rather interesting aroma for this one, the normal dark malts and clean yeast of a bock are present but so too is a very distinct cherry aroma along with sweet chocolate. I know chocolate is often used to describe stouts and the like but that is always a bittersweet dark chocolate type aroma, this time I get sweet milk chocolate without any bitter characteristic at all. Well there is absolutely no mistaking the cherry in this one. There is even more cherry in here than in the cherry wheat also produced by BBC. It never becomes cloying however because it is balanced by enough bitter malt and a touch of malt sweetness as well, while the cherry wheat doesn't have this balance. Overall it is fairly crisp with low to moderate levels of carbonation and a surprisingly clean finish. Overall this is a pretty nice spin on the bock style a great beer for a cold winters night."

"O - The label says Chocolate Cherry and that's what you get. This is a fun seasonal beer that I probably wouldn't buy any other way than in the Beers of Winter assortment."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is a subdued version of the aroma with a touch of caramel and lightly roasted chocolate emerging with warming which actually helps to balance the dessert like sweetness otherwise present. Decent feel, lightly bready in texture. An interesting take on the style and rather pleasant, though I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting given its profile and sweetness coupled with a lack of malt depth/complexity."
""

"Had this poured out of the bottle into a porter glass. A bit sweet, but one of the better offerings I've had from Sam in a long time. Deep chocolate brown color and heavy body with a very smooth mouthfeel. Sweet cocoa and cherry aroma, with a flavor to match. Try it with desserts."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was already a big fan of the regular chocolate bock, and I enjoyed this one as well, the cherry was a nice compliment to the chocolate. Another good one from SA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's got chocolate and cherry, just not in a convincing natural way. Pretty easy drinking but just an okay beer."
""
"O- It's a Cherry Chocolate Bock and taste so. I personally like cherry and chocolate flavors so I enjoy this beer."
""
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, cherry cola, and chocolate covered cherry aromas. Taste is much the same with roasted malt and cherry cola flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with an interesting cherry cola presence in both the aroma and flavor."
""
""
"Overall its pretty much their cherry wheat mixed with their chocolate bock. Not the best cherry flavor but the chocolate bock notes are solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark brown with faint garnet highlights at the edges and a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of cherry overwhelm my olfactory system. Tart sweet medicinal cough drop conjuring cherry aromas. Everything I hate about Sam Adams cherry wheat unfortunately made it into this beer. Light chocolate and burnt sugars deep underneath, I think. The flavor is sweet medicinal cherry with bits of Hershey's syrup drizzled on top. Hints of dark sugary flavors are there but little else. Medium body with a sweet sticky syrupy mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. I choked down the last of this bottle, but on the bright side my cough cleared up. Now to pawn the remaining bottle off on some unsuspecting Christmas guest."

"The feel is interesting. It's thick for a Bock, but it feels like soda at times. Crispness is a little fluffy at the front, but it's pretty smooth as it goes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, an okay beer, definitely not my favorite from the Winter Sampler."
"Actually not as bad as I was expecting it to be, the beer did leave quite a weird aftertaste that I thought at first were the chocolate malts... not so sure as it got very medicinal in spots and felt artificial... it wasn't horrible as others would have you believe but it certainly isn't a bock and not an excellent fruit beer for that matter either... they could have done something really nice with this had more time been taken but... it is what it is... okay beer but one that I probably wont revisit... I will give the other bottle away to someone..."
""
""
""
""
"O: Too sweet to session, but overall a beer that I believe does what SA wanted it to do."
""
""
""

"This is a perfect beer for the Christmas season. I am usually a bit skeptical with some of the additives put in beer, but this one is a winner. The bottle was part of a 12 pack holiday sampler bought for 14.99 and, so far, a very good value. Send more of these chocolate cherry beers please!"
"Now I am rating this beer for what the brewer intended....not necessarily that I think this beer is overly amazing. The beer poured a deep almost opaque dark amber with ecru head that is not leaving much of a lace. The scent carries cherries and chocolate. The taste is very similar to the scent and is very sweet...almost like a cherry coke. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall its decent....too sweet for me to session."
"the highlight of the winter box this year, and an excellent brew overall. if this was made by three floyds or cigar city, people would rave about it, which pisses me off, but i love this beer. rich mocha color on the pour with a slowly rising tan head with alright retention. smells like tart dried cherries and cherry juice with rich dark chocolate and lager yeast, well put together and appropriately proportioned on the fruit. the flavor is outstanding, with the fruit coming on fast but not sweet, and an earthy cocoa coming in to give it a dessert vibe. its layered and unique, and the cherry is just right in intensity. the finish is quick, this is a lager after all, and it cuts the dense body and dark malt mouth coating with a crispness that makes this beer awfully drinkable. a total winner from sam adams here, i wish i could get this around the calendar."
""
"O: If this were anything but a holiday beer, it really wouldn't work. Pretty much a mix of their chocolate bock and cherry wheat, it's definitely on the sweet side with nothing to balance. One at a time is the only way to drink this, as it's a dessert in a glass. Glad it only comes in the mix pack because as a sixer, it would last a bit longer than the Christmas season"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - if this wasn't so sweet I think I'd like it more. I know it was meant to be sweet, but it was too sweet for me"
""
""
""
"Overall not saying its disappointing but it could use more more complexity. It was a decent beer strictly for novelty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Made it halfway through, dumped, and gave bottle 2 away."
"Overall I thought this beer was just barely decent and It really isn't recognizable as a bock, but I think it's a pretty average example of a fruit infused dark beer. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, rich, a little filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one is enough for me, I have no urge to drink another one in a row, i think that artificial cherry taste would really wear on me. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and the mouthfeel, they were both nice and the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the cherry aspect, it was just too artificial for me and I would have have liked it to taste more natural and a little tart. I wouldn't buy this beer on it's own, it's just not for me and I would only recommend it to people who like that same cherry aspect that's in their Cherry Wheat. All in all I wasn't too impressed with this beer, I liked the original Chocolate Bock much more and I don't think the cherry helped this beer out. This was my least favorite beer in this years winter seasonal variety pack. I wasn't a big fan of this years winter variety pack, I thought last years was much better. Better luck next guys, Chocolate Bock was fine just the way it was."

"I just finally tried this beer a month ago, it shot right to the top 10 on my list! I truly love the cherry and chocolate combination. They have hit it right on the head w/ the pairing, neither taste overwhelming the other. My only mark against it would be the slightly flat taste of the bock, I would prefer it to provide a bit headier pour (may not be possible?!?) Otherwise excellent work Sam Adams!"
""
""
""
""
"Looked like a very thick, dark beer when I initially poured it, but was slightly red when held up to the light. Smells like cherries and chocolate obviously. Fairly tart, but smooth. I'm not a fan of cherries, so I wouldn't buy this beer again, but I didn't hate it."
""
""
"This is a pretty simple beer without a lot of complexity, but is just as advertised. I found the chocolate and cherries to be nicely balanced, which made for a decent beer. This won't make any top beers list, but was a nice addition to this year's holiday pack."
""
""
"Some folks may find that a good thing. I'll pass, thank you."

"O: Overall a very solid beer, Thanks Jim and crew! Sadly they were the first everyone drank from the case will definitly drink this one again, and sad as it is I did not miss the chocolate bock this year, it was way better with the cherry."
"Overall: I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I'm definitely a sucker for cherries, and this beer did that right for me. Drinkability is really high. What you'll get here is chocolate and cherries. Not a whole much else, and I'm fine with that for this beer. My favorite beer from Sam Adams that I've had so far."
"Nicely done but I am not sure if I could drink more than one in a sitting."
"Overall, a decent offering from Sam Adams. I like the addition of cherry in this one to add a bit of tartness and sweetness. Enjoyable."
""
""
"O - Better than the old chocolate bock for sure. I like it a lot, just doesn't deserve high scores when it's being reviewed as a beer. But I love Dr. Pepper and this tastes like a beer version so I'm a fan."
""
"The taste lacks complexity, but it might be nice to sip on a cold night in front of a fire."
"O-pretty tasty, definitely not traditional but a nice change of pace."
""
""
""
"I tried not to be biased when trying this beer as the original chocolate bock was my absolute favorite. The color was consistent with the original, the smell pretty close with a hint of cherry. I am not a fan of Sam's Cherry Wheat, so I assumed I would be disappointed with this beer. But, in truth, I actually enjoyed it. Not as good as the original, and I would have liked a bit more chocolate flavor, but it was easily my favorite of the variety pack and it lessened the emotional blow I took when discovering I would be without my beloved Chocolate bock for at least another year(possible forever). The best way to describe the taste of this beer is to be simple: it tasted like a cherry tootsie pop. I will definetly get at least one more winter variety pack before the season is over because of this beer."
""
""
""
"Not subtle in its approach, but I'll bet this would work just fine with a chocolate dessert on a cold winters night"
"Poured one and a half bottles into a 1/2 liter stein a deep dark chocolate color with a reddish brown hue,a lighter tan colored head atop,downhill from there.Aromas of maraschino cherries dominate the nose,just artificial and overly sweet.Flavors are cloying and so artificial tasting that it's hard to come up with anything other than sweet as far as a profile goes.It tastes like cherry syrup with a little bit of chocolate.I think Boston Beer Company is a great, and Jim Koch is great, but this beer to me is a slap in the face to craft beer drinkers."
"The Verdict: Not bad. The flavor is a bit artificial, but it’s not terrible. Kind of like brewing a Brach’s chocolate covered cherry into a beer. Sure, there are better brands of cordials out there, but for the price and availability it will do in a pinch."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer at all, good bock characteristics, and great flavor, but there's still some things missing here and there. The taste is great, but its lacking something, some more personality maybe. That being said, it's a fine after dinner beverage, and the cherry chocolate thing it's got going on is pretty solid. Another satisfactory showing from Sam Adams."
"Recommendations? Why yes, I do have some. Dump in some lactose, sweeten up the chocolate and tone down the cherry tartness a bit. I'd like to see Southern Tier give a cherry cordial beer a whirl."
"Pours very dark. You can barely see through it. Up to a light the color is a dark red black. Head is almost nonexistent. Faint chocolate smell and much stronger artificial cherry smell. Initial chocolate taste and finishes with a cherry kick. Very slight sweetness but there's something at the finish that I can't put my finger on. Very artifically cherryish. Somewhat overwhelming but subtle. Dark roasted feel that ends slightly bitter but not much body. Was a bit disappointed in this one. Was expecting stronger chocolate taste. The cherry part is ok without being too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light carbonation and light body. This one is desert in a glass. Good one for a holiday season evening."
""
""
"O-Sam Adams should just stop making things with cherries."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) This beer is a good fit for the holiday pack. For the most part, I enjoyed it. It's hard not to be impressed at how well the brewer brought out the chocolate and cherry. At the same time, it was a bit much."
"Definatly a sweet desert beer, for me the flavors are just a bit too artificial."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the third different beer I've had with cherry in it, and none if them were favorable. This is like a Tootsie Roll cola, and I will try to learn to avoid cherry beers from now on."
""
"O: I really enjoyed this, fairly favorable and sessionable ( even though theres only 2 per sampler pack)"
"Certainly a unique beer. I see it's potential, but as I stated above, the cherry was just a bit much in the taste for my preferences."
""
""
""
""
"I can only guess that the reason this beer is getting decent scores is that there are a lot of people who can drink a large quantity of soda in a single sitting. The color is nice, it looks like a proper bock, but that's about it. The mouthfeel is thin, the aroma is overly sweetened cherries, the taste is like cherry coke gone off. Poured it down the drain after giving it a couple of tries. Very disappointed as I usually love the offerings from Boston Beer."
""
""
"Overall- I had high hopes for this beer and I was really looking forward to trying this, but it fell short of my expectations. It was decent but Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock is way better."
""
""
""
"12 OZ bottle from a variety pack. Pours dark brown with foamy, long lasting, beige head and nice lacing. Aroma is of cherries; chocolate toasted malt, cacao and hint of spices. Body full and smooth. Taste is of cherries, toasted malt, cacao and hint of hops. Finish is long and sweet. Good desert brew."
"O: To be honest I was a little nervous when I heard that they added cherry to the bock because I remembered the cherry wheat that, to put it in kind words, was like drinking cough syrup. This however, was very well balanced and the cherries complimented the roasted notes very well. I never felt like it was too sweet or that there was cough syrup in it. I am pleasantly surprised at how well this beer turned out to be and am glad that the Boston Beer Company went for the risk to change up the annual bock."

"Overall: A good beer but not a great one. I find this to b the best of the new offerings in the winter pack and I hope they bring this back. That said it is like a mixture of their cherry wheat and chocolate bock, but does not work as well as either of those beers, which I adore. I think O'Fallon has a tastier version of a cherry chocolate bock, but this one is still fairly good."

"Overall - the chocolate is a bit covered up by the cherries, but overall a good beer."

"A good effort, but this would've tasted better as just a chocolate bock, or with real cherries."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Really strong frothy head, and some persistent lacing. The cherry in the nose pretty much overpowers anything else. Malty, accentuated with cherry; but it's more bitter than sweet. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
""

"This is a very nice, tasty winter brew. I'm going to see how it tastes and feels as it warms, but I'm guessing that, like a porter, it will only improve the experience. Definitely worth buying a few for the winter months."
"Like many other Samuel Adams special offerings, the beer's base taste is overly simplified and its unique flavor additions seem disjointed and artificial. It simply lacks the true malt core to pull the beer together. Instead, grain and mineral commands."

"Overall - Not too bad, just a bit too cherry for me. I was hoping for a more chocolate tasting beer, but overall this isn't a bad sipper every once and a while. Well I have 3 more, they will go in time."

"Overall - A nice winter dessert beer. Maybe something to save for a digestif after Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. The sweetness can get a bit cloying, but as a sipper after meal, it's a nice treat."

"Would have preferred the regular Chocolate Bock in the holiday pack this year, also would have preferred that they have kept the holiday porter as part of it too but that's another story."

"Surprised by the rating this is getting. Total drain pour for me, taste is very artificial cherry. Like cough syrup and the bad taste lingers. Not picking up chocolate at all, to over powered by the bad cherry flavor. Very disappointed in this one, was the one I was wanting to try most from the variety pack"
""
""
""
"Overall – While a bit too sweet and dessert like for a regular going to, an occasional encounter is in line as it makes for a good drinking alternative to a sweet dessert."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a dark mahogany with a one inch light tan head, that leaves behind excellent lace. Smell is more cherry than chocolate, with vanilla blended in with the others. Taste is chocolate to start, then the cherry and vanilla comes in at the finish. Body is medium, nice amount of carbonation, not dry, and very drinkable. This is a nice beer and a bit different. Don't drink it to cold, the flavors really blend well as it warms."
""
"Low C+"
""
"While the aroma tends to favor the cherry, the taste tends to favor the chocolate but both flavors are there. Mild bitterness if that is the correct term. But it has a slight lingering quality at the end. Very nice."
"O - Overall SAs Chocolate Cherry Bock gives me the impression of melted candy. I'm sure others would like it, and it's along the lines of what I expected, but it's not for me."
"D - Kind of a one note beer to me, and one that you need to be in the mood for. Fortunately, I enjoy Cordials from time to time during the winter and could easily find two times to be in the mood to drink this. Not something I'd want a six pack of but I like it as something different in the Winter 12 pack."
""
"This is a nice beer. It's exactly what you would expect from a cherry-chocolate bock. It's not something I'd want to drink a ton of, but one bottle in a sitting is enjoyable. I like it though and is a fitting beer for the holidays."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a very small tan head. Some spotty lacing was seen. Perfect carbonation actually. The aroma of a chocolate covered cherry hits you right in the nose at first. Very nice of course. The taste of cocoa powder and slightly artificial cherry taste, like a Hall's cough drop. Still wasn't bad at all."
""
""
"Not nearly as good as Chocolate Bock. I guess I miss that one this year after having this one. It's still a holiday bock, and it just barely works. For a bock, it's got character. I'll give it that."
""
"O - Not bad by any means, but slightly disappointing. I found myself wishing this was a chocolate cherry stout. I think if it was a stout instead of a bock, allowing the chocolate flavors to be more natural, this could be a hit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting brew, kind of tip toes the line of being a beer, as it tastes and feels like a soda. I actually like it though. Not something Id go to often, but definitely worth a try."
""
"An excellent replacement to the original chocolate bock it is the sole reason why i wait to drink this one last in the winter variety pack. Nice dark brown color average head and all around smoothness. Addictive to drink all day long especially winter. So soothing it is unreal"
""
""
"O: Tastes like one of those cheap chocolate covered cherry cordials. It was interesting. I'd drink it again. It's good in small doses."
""
""
"O: I'm not a huge fan of cherries. I have always hated cherry cordial candy but I admit this bock is not bad. I really was sure I would not like this but my mind has been changed. This isn't something I would seek out but I'm pleasantly pleased with this brew. On the negative side I feel that cherry presence really overpowers the other flavors. Cheers!"

"Pours out a dark brown/ruby body. Smell: maraschino cherry juice, almond extract, and chocolate flavoring. Tastes like a cherry Coke with chocolate flavoring. Lots of maraschino cherry syrup. Mouthfeel is flabby yet sticky. Needs more carbonation. I preferred the Chocolate Bock. I'm getting no bock characteristics between the cherry and chocolate."

"OV- I really get what Sam Adams is doing here. I enjoyed this beer alot and I thought they accomplished what they were shooting for. I could drink it all holiday season."
""
""
""

"Smell of cherries and malt hit my nose instantly as it has a dark color with slight head. The first taste reveals dark chocolate and cherries with a hint of other malts. Tastes like those Lindle chocolate covered cherry candies. It has a medium body with slight carbonation. This beer was delicious and would make a great desert drink. Might be great if made into a float with vanilla or cherry ice cream. Would love to buy this again."
""
""
"Overall: I would attempt to avoid this."
"Overall the quality falls right in line with the Boston Beer variety packs, you know what you are getting. A beer worth a try if you like sweet or cherry beers for sure, but doesn't have enough redeeming qualities to earn its own six pack from the BBC."

"Winter 12 pack 2013 special release, dark mahogany bottle with a light khaki tan head forming fine intricate lacing. Aroma has cola dark roasted caramel malts and toffee with hints of cherry tartness on the nose. Flavor sweet cherry cola from the front to the back this beer is like cherry wheat mixed with the chocolate bock, chocolate covered cherry bock. Mouthfeeel is a bit cloying with sweetness it weighs heavy between sips, complex but super sweet with those natural flavors added, a lager brewed with cherries with cocoa nibs added. Overall I'm seeing what they are trying to produce on a large scale, chocolate covered cherry beer."
"An OK beer but honestly I would have preferred they had left the Holiday Porter in the Holiday pack for this year."

"Appearance is dark brown with some red highlights at the edges. Not much head retention to speak of. Smell starts with heavy dose of mariscino cherry complete with the sugary syrup it is packages with. Milk chocolate comes through next with moderate malty sweetness . Taste leans towards the sweet side and the flavors come in the same order as the nose. The chocolate is more pronounced and features more of a dark chocolate flavor than the nose. The bock base adds a considerable amount of sweetness and works well with the flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with mild carbonation. Overall, this is a nice dessert beer that is well rounde and drinks smoothly. Not a bad brew."

"Served icy at Matthew's 1600 in Catonsville, MD. Wonderful to have a draught option of a beer previously unbeknownst to me. After the obligatory warming period, with frigid phalanges to boot, I gazed. Dark, dark, dark, ah, but what's that I see at the bottom of the glass? Gorgeous deep red peeks through the storm. Upon lowering my nose towards it, I'm hit with a tidal wave of cherry. Subtly would have been appreciated. My tongue confirms what my nose suspects. CHERRY. Creamy swishing makes for a mildly above average mouthfeel. Aftertaste is lingerful. About 2/3 thru the glass, the chocolate became more prominent. Sammy Adams, you've out-cherried yrself again."
"Served in the Sam Adams glass this beer has a weak tan head that dissipates quickly. Brown with garnet highlights and clear. Aromas of cherry and chocolate for sure. A bit of a cola aroma. Taste is chocolate cherry cola-weird. Weak on grainy malts or hops this beer is high on carbonation and weak in body given the ABV. A fairly easy beer to drink-recommended for someone looking for a beery cherry cola. A sweet dessert beer."

"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and syrupy. Unless you're a sours fan, I'd avoid this."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color. Aroma of sweet cherries, chocolate, toffee and alcohol. In the taste, more cherry, with some sweet bock character, but all too sweet. Artificial cherry flavor, lots of malt sweetness and sugars behind it. Cloying. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and syrupy. Overall, this would be a good choice for fans of sweet beers, but not one of the better offerings from Boston Beer Co."
""
""
"The beer pours a beautiful dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet chocolate and crystal malt scent along with a faint cherry aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a quaffable chocolate and cherry flavor; delicious, yet not overly done. It's incredibly easy drinking even at 7%. It goes down quick with a sweet, almost milk stout character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good dessert style beer. It doesn't wimp out on chocolate flavor. The cherry taste is mild at best, but goes a long way in rounding out the taste."

"I wasn't a fan of the Chocolate Bock or now this Chocolate Cherry Bock. Apparently, they just aren't for me. That being said, the ice cream Churchill's Pub & Grille made using this ice cream was fantastic."

"M/O: This beer was on tap at RFD in DC. Very complex and balanced beer. Good for the winter time and very good with desserts."

"Chocolate Cherry Bock pours a black color, with a small whitish head. There was a nice sweet smell, mostly from the chocolate. The taste was rather sweet, alot of chocolate and cherry, but it blended very well, with just a bit of a smokey malty undertone. Very easy to drink, and it had a nice strong flavor. Overall a very nice desert type beer. I wasn't impressed with Sam Adams chocolate bock, but this one with cherries is like a candy bar, and i was very impressed."
""
""
"I loved this beer. I originally had the look a 4.5, but dropped it down after some consideration. I’m a bit of a Sam Adams homer but this may have been the best I tried."
""
"O- Not a bad beer just a bit to one sided for my liking."
""
""
""
""
"Another surprise Sam Adams tap-only offering at LM. I guess I should stop being so surprised, right? Anyway, it pours a dark, ruby-tinted black-brown topped by a half-finger of dirty ashen foam. The nose explodes with black cherry, with a light bit of roasted malts behind the din. It's pleasant, indeed, but seems a bit one-sided. The taste holds notes of somewhat-artificial-seeming black cherry, chocolate powder, light roasted malts, toasted caramel, and a hint of toasted coconut. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a nice beer, but the cherry seems to have diluted the usually very nice Chocolate Bock. I'd have another if given the chance, but I wouldn't be as eager to do so as I was this time."
"I usually find chocolate bocks to be disappointing, but this was one of the better ones I've had."
""
"Speaking of subtlety, there is none in this beer. It is chocolatey like Hershey syrup and cherry-flavored like cherry coke. In other words, it tasted like it was loaded with sugars and artificial flavoring - no love. The 'Bock' part of the beer is just an afterthought. I can't review this like any other bock because the additives totally wreck it."
""
"To artificial to be enjoyable. Not something I would recommend. Sam Adams does some very nice beers, but their fruits beers are not among them."
"Overall impression: A well done Fruit beer. It has elements of chocolate and cherry while still retaining good base beer characteristics. That's hard to do and this was well done."
"This is a fun beer. There's a lot going on and the flavors change and intensify as the beer warms. It's rich and dessert-like, it's sweet, it's smooth, it's good. It's definitely worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a smooth and easy drinking beer even with the cherry. Man it goes down very easy"
""
""
"O: Better than expected, went perfectly with the cherry chocolate cake it was paired with."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, a bit filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a flavorful stout-like lager to drink for a while."
"O - This has pretty good drinkability. I could easily have a few glass of this throughout the night. Overall, I think this is a quite nice and interesting beer. I think it is definitely worth a try. The cherry character is really nice in this and it mixes well with the chocolate flavors. I would drink this one again."
"O: Great beer; possibly one of the best beers I have ever had from SA; definitely in the top 3. Perfectly executed balance of flavors. High carbonation gives a creamy sensation, along with the malt content. This is really like drinking an alcoholic cherry cordial."
""

"I had this one at the West Point Market in Akron. Pours a nice light colored head but it fades away quickly. It has a nice red hue to it as well. You can smell the chocolate right off the bat. The first taste highlights the cherry flavor but falls into one of the best chocolate flavors i've seen in a beer. The alcohol is not subtle at all but works with the cherries to really bring out a great flavor. It's not overly sweet either. I'm not always that big of a fan of Sam Adams stuff but this one is great. I'm gonna have to pick this one up again on my next trip out to the market."
"The beer, sadly, does not live up to the overwhelming cherry aroma. In fact, all I taste is cherry with just a lingering of chocolate on the back of the tongue. What happened to the beer?"

"Pours a very dark amber-brown color with a fingers width of khaki colored head. Smells very subtle but of a traditional bock.. Maybe some malt and chocolate. Tastes is well balanced with cherrys and dark chocolate. Subtle hints of yeast. Delicious, Slighty drying dark chocolate and cherry end. I actually like this a lot.. I'm surprised at how well balanced it is. I thought the cherry in this would be like the Sam, Cherry Wheat where it's just a little too overbearing but nope, pleasantly suprised."
"This beer was poured out and served with dessert last night at the Spinnerstown Hotel. The beer came to us and looked nice and dark in color, almost like a porter or stout. The head had almost completely vanished by the time I got my glass. The smell of this beer was pretty nice, it had a very sweet smelling cherry aroma filling my nose along with just a bit of malts in the background. The taste is sweet with loads of cherry the dark chocolate kind of shows up late in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was decent, it was well carbonated and was drinkable. Overall I feel that this beer is basically a blend of the Cherry Wheat and the Chocolate back that is released in the winter. There really isn't too much special about it other than it goes well with a sweet dessert. To be honest that beer could have been dessert and it would have done the job just fine. This is the beer I was anticipating the most from the beer dinner and it turned out to probably be my least favorite."
"I have to admit, this beer is really outstanding. I'm not saying the Boston Beer Company is bad by any means but even this for them is top notch. I've had their Chocolate Bock before and did enjoy it, but the addition of cherry just gives this beer a completely different complexity that is just downright delicious."
"O - Not your typical bock beer but it was never supposed to be. If you like sweet, fruity, beers you will like this one but if that isn't your thing you might want to avoid this one."
"i poured this beer into a snifter glass, it has a very dark brown, almost black body with not a lot of head that lays down to a thin brown lace around the edge of the glass. The smell is sweet of maraschino cherries with nice chocolate notes coming through too. The taste is so nice and balanced of cherry and chocolate, with the roasted malt on back of the tongue. Great mouth feel and overall a exceptional beer."
"O - This was a nice experiment from Sam Adams...the flavors are that of the name so you will not be disappointed...good for dessert (you won't want more than one) especially with a slice Devil's Food Cake"
"Narrative: Tyler wiped his brow profusely, “come on Tyler, hold it together, this deal is almost sealed, hold it together,” he reassured himself. He looked nervously over at the produce crates and fidgeted with his apron. “Well Tyler, I must say, you are by far the most reasonable cherry wholesaler we have encounter, vastly lower than all other offers, we are inclined to buy from you year-round.” Tyler swallowed hard and looked at the crates labeled “Cherrys” and began to fidget nervously. “Yeah we, we always try and you know, get the cherries, only cherries that, well you know…” The manager of Cost U Cheap Foods looked askance at Tyler and moved towards the crates. “Tyler, these, you know these are juniper berries right? These aren’t even cherries, where did you get these? Is this a joke?” Tyler shot up out of his seat, once again, the jig was up, somehow every produce manager that he encountered knew exactly what a cherry looked like and apparently this was wholly dissimilar to juniper berries. “YOU DIDN’T EVEN GIVE THEM A TRY!” He cried out and spiked his apron on the ground in frustration before bolting out of the room."
"O - I think that this a top notch quality beer. It is beautifully balanced and has all the right flovors. While it may not be exact to bock style, the credit is deserved for overall beer. I would love to get my hands on a keg of this!"
"I could drink this regularly but the sweetness makes this a bit of a novelty. I find it to be a perfect dessert beer and wish it was available around the holidays."
"Sampled at the Cleveland Beer Fest. Pours a hazy brown/black with a thin beige head. Smells like a Chocolate Covered cherry, Taste is big cherry & chocolate, and a lot of sweetness. Light to Medium bodied, Does not have that Bock Malt but, Nice and sweet, light caramel Malt. For the Style....Not bad."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and would get it again. After one pint I doubt I could have another one, it got a bit heavy towards the end. This also reminded me of a cherry soda, this drank very easily. Certainly a different beer and glad I tried it. This is a lager I could get into."
"This beer is a joke, but it's a pleasant laugh down memory lane. Nice to try one time, but I can't really see any reason to ever try this again."
"O - This was a real treat - like drinking dessert! I'd definitely order this over and over again, but probably not more than a pint at one sitting (unless I was feeling like a fatty and wanted an extra slice of liquid cake)."
"O: This was one of the best beers I had at the festival and I had more than a few samples. I almost expected the cherry flavor to be too much but it was definitely balanced by the chocolate and roasty flavors as well. If they bottled this I would definitely buy it."
"o - Overall a very nice, interesting bock. I enjoyed the nose a lot as it reminded me of black cherry soda, and thought the chocolate and cherries worked well together. Would certainly have it again, though not sure if I would want more than one glass in a single night."
"O- This beer was a pleasant surprise overall. I thought the ABV was hidden well overall while drinking this beer. Sam Adams needs to bottle this one. The flavors really were blended well together and this one shows what can happen when Sam Adams takes the time to actually brew."
" The taste is good as it has a pretty strong cherry and chocolate taste which lives up to the name, however it causes the bock base to get a little lost in the flavor. I get a light malt in the middle after some of the cherry zing and chocolate pizzazz wheres off slightly. This bock finishes fruity and semi-sweet with gentle bitterness. Overall an ok bock, it would probably appeal to those who like sweet and fruity beers more than the craft fan, but it is not your average bock and you know that going in."
