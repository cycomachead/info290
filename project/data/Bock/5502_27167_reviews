"Decent beer but no more than that, Sweet taste and nice lacing in the glass. They call this one a bock but its not...."

"Food match: More suited to German than Polish cuisine, but then again I'm not overly familiar with Polish food (apart from delicious pierogi) so I could be wrong. The flavours I would pursue to match this would be banquet hall fare (pig + spit + this beer = good) you get the picture."

"Decent beer for the price, but not one I would drink regularly (or ever, when better options are readily available for even less money). Nice bottle, cute label. Beer? Meh."

"A very good interpretation of a traditional bock - towards a doppelbock. Strong, yet drinkable. A great brew, especially if you want a sweet brew."
""
"O: This beer isn't that bad of a representation of the style. I enjoyed the creaminess in the mouthfeel."

"Overall a real tasty bock, one of the best single bocks I have had. Would recommend to anyone into malt forward brews."
""
"Overall, very solid bock beer, a very strong caramel/toffee presence, but good bitter balance."
"Overall: this is a pretty tasty and refreshing brew. I would have it again."
"O: Pretty decent."
"O: A light and sweet bock, fragrant and smooth, but nothing out of the ordinary"

"Amazing tropical smell... pear juice blended with dates and apple juice. Very sweet flavour, chocolate apple juice with raisins. I wasn't expecting much from this beer at 4 bucks a bottle, what a nice surprise."
"O - There are better bock beers out there. Leave it on the shelf."
"O: A surprisingly nice Bock, from Poland. Usually Bocks are only this nice if they come from Germany."
"O/D - I could have about two before it got old. A good beer and much better than expected. Easy to drink and tasty just not much depth but a good sesher."
"Pours a dark reddish amber color with a dense 3/4"" tan head. Smell is very potent and really jumped out at me. It smells strongly of raisins and maple syrup. The taste seemed pretty complex to me, at different moments I got flavors of raisin, caramel and barley. Toward the end of the sip there is an odd bitterness that I cannot describe, but it didn't really sit well with me. The thickness of this beer is close to doppel territory, carbonation in this beer is pretty light. Overall, this beer was fun and different, but didn't really impress me that much. I am still in search of a Bock I can really call my favorite."
"Picked up a half liter at EuroMarket in Queens. It's a rich, bready bock that reminds me more of a doppel, but there's a very unpleasant astringent bitterness in the background that really throws this off. Otherwise there's a tasty mix of crust, marmalade, sweet biscuits and caramel. What a shame."
"D: Too metallic. It's like they brew in a copper stave."
"Mouthfeel is confusingly thin, slightly dry. Too one-sided on the sweetness for me to really think it's all that drinkable."
"this is not a lager of longievity... in that it has a rich fullness in the intial few sips but quickly depreciates as you sip. the look is nice. great amber clear with a dough head. nose of stale apples and toastiness and a bit of smoke. but the smoke tastes as if it was burnt is that malt volume quality. the feel is astringent when i would expect something rather smooth. its got a bitter finish that has a mild acidic leather smoke which brings forth the mineral like qualities. but still on standard of european quality."
"Not a bad beer, super drinkable for the abv."
"D - Slightly bitter-sweet owing to the mix of burnt flavours and the sweeter fruity stuff. This definitely has some characteristics of a bock but for me the taste is somewhere between those typical darker flavours of that style and those of a bi√®re de garde. Nice change either way and interesting to drink."
"Not bad, nor extraordinary... pretty middle-of-the-road bock that's worth checking out if you happen across it, but nothing worth going out of the way to find. I've given better ratings to worse beers, the numbers fall a little short here somehow."
"Cheers"
"Maybe if you were all in the same place at the same time and discussed this beer you could make it something to be proud of. Thanks Matt, my first Polish beer."
"D: An ok beer, but only in small quantities."
"This Polish deliciously is very good. Nice smell, fruity, caramel. The head dissipates fast, but is steady. Good taste, sweet malt characteristic backed by the essence of Caramel, subtle notes of chocolate bitterness. For a Bock beer, this beer is sort of Rogue having so much sweet characteristics, and even though most Bocks go well with meat, this beer pairs well with Polish Pastries, which might explain the sweetness. This is by far one of the best Polish beers I have, up there with Zywiec, Warka Strong, Tyskie, and Okocim."
"Not a bad bock. Second time I've had it, but probably won't pick it up again."
"D - The disgusting smell and cloying sweetness make this one pretty undrinkable. I'm about a quarter of the way through and probably will drain pour it before it is half finished. Thankfully I only paid 75 cents for this."
"Quite good! Glad I found it."
"A really drinkable bock with great favour and very nice mouthfeel."
"The appearance is nice for a bock, ruby red and auburn at the edges. A billowing head soon subsides into a patchy surface skim that resembles floating bread crumbs. Maple syrup and malty brown sugar aroma. Raisin and whole grain bread flavors, molasses sweetness almost medicinal. Fairly full bodied, maybe a touch too syrupy, not exactly quaffable, but good in small sips as it warms. Pleasant bready aftertaste. Some dried fruit maybe. Not bad, but it didn't really hold my interest."
"An average beer but very drinkable."
"taste is of wheat, brown sugar, roasted malt, some caramel, ends on the dry side."
"Overall, this is one amazing bock and easy to drink. I am starting to grow on the style and this one tops many if not all that I have had. If you happen to visit Poland, this beer is worth a try."
"Drinkable, yes, though given other choices, I'd keep moving along."
"Mouthfeel is more on the light side and the beer is surprisingly drinkable. Overall, I am very satisfied with this one, it feels more flavourful and refreshing than some German Bocks I have tried recently."
"Goes down very easy. A real pleasant surprise. I don't know how well this fits in style definitions, but I liked this beer a lot, and would definitely buy it again."
"Drinkability: Would make a great session beer for a bock lover. One of my better non-Baltic-Porter finds while out drinking in Poland."
"Drinkability: If you like a sweet beer, this one is for you; me, not so much"
"Overall: nothing that original, and not a good example of a bock, but since my expectations were low, I was not disappointed - this is a perfectly drinkable beer."
"500 ml brown silk print bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. ABV is 6.5%. Also available in Norway at Vinmonopolet. Beautiful copper colour, large tan head. Malty sweetish aroma, notes of caramel and bakery. Malty sweet flavour, loads of caramel, sweeter than I appreciate. Very moderate hops in the finish."
"The carbonation is average-mild; the bubbles are small. The liquid is smooth."
"Grabbed a couple bottles of these while I was in Poland. It poured a nice dark amber color and had good notes of malt and some caramel. The head was an attractive tan ribbon that while small, had great retention. Taste was smooth, and evenly malted. Not as much malt as I expected from the appearance, but it was very pleasant to drink. High drinkability makes this a great all around bock."
"A great appearence, decent head. Semi - transparent in a deep, ruby amber shade. Wicked looking bottle, with silk screened graphic and inticing write up. A solid, matly aroma. Taste doesn't indicate alcohol. Strong amber and crystal malt. This is like a DoppleBock meets Amber Ale (which, I think was the brewer's intentions, so good). It certainly works! Lots of caramel malt to round out the edges. No bad aftertaste. Tasty, light bodied. Great drinking bock, would certainly serve as a good 'cross-over' beer. This is almost as nice as its dopplebock counterpart of a similar name. Somewhat limited, but well achieved and well rounded. Quite good !"
"a little disappointing after the nice aroma. too highly carbonated in my opinion; it takes away from what should be a very smooth character. also, it isn't really all that malty. it's certainly not bad, but i think i would have rather brought home a zywiec porter or something more enjoyable (though worth a try if you're over there)"
