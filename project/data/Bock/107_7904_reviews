"Overall : every time I take a sip of this, my eyes gently pop out of my head, I blink slowly twice, and I smile. It's that good. You owe it to yourself to try this Bock. It's amazing."

"As good as best gets as far as I'm concerned."

"The wonderful malty flavors of a traditional bock come through in this beer. The nose gives those slight chocolate undertones which come though when you have a couple sips. I love it with a dark chocolate candy bar to inhance the chocolate flavors."

"Pours a very dark brown with a smaller tan head. Good amount of lacing was seen with each sip. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of coffee, toffee with a hint of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is even better! All the above flavors come through and blend together nicely. Goes down smooth and easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste. Very pleasant for sure!"
""
"Overall: Probably my favorite beer from Millstream, I had it several years ago but did not review. I'm not usually a bock guy, but this isn't a typical bock. It's more like a porter or brown ale with good roasted malt flavors."

"Overall, a pretty good bock, but it has a bit too much of a roast for me. It is also a bit sweet."

"O - darker beer with good flavor, but not overpowering. Would buy again"

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer worth drinking for a long time if youâ€™re in the mood for the style."

"O: Not what I was expecting at all. This beer has made my day, too bad it is my last one as I gave some away and drank a few when I had drank a few too many so I didn't realize its sheer awesomeness. An amazing amount of flavours and nuance for a smaller beer."
"Beer is medium bodied with ample carbonation to make this foam up on the palate, creating a smooth and pillowy mouthfeel. Seems about right for a bock. Closes out with a dry finish."
"O- A very delicious beer that has a good mouthfeel. Far and away the best beer I've had from Millstream."
"This is a pretty good beer. I'd be proud of it if I made it. But it's not amazing and doubt it will be memorable."
"O: I am liking this a lot. Great flavors and hits the spot on a cold day. Millstream really knows how to do the German styles, and this is no exception. Worth seeking out."
""
""
"It reminds me more of a porter or stout than a bock. This really needs to be sweetened up."
""
"M - This beer has a medium body with an excellent level of carbonation. Very balanced beer with a somewhat sticky and sugary residual feel. Great winter beer."
"Verdict: decent and flavorful, it's unique and worth trying if it's priced well."
"M: Too flat, while the beer isn't fresh, the bottle should hold carbonation better than this. Nothing else is wrong with it."
"D - This is an easy drinking brew...dare I say sessionable? My first foray into the world of Millstream, and I wasn't disappointed in the least. Certainly worth a try."
"This beer looks like a damn good bock, it's got a beautiful deep amber color with a beige head on the surface. The smell leaves much to the imagination as it doesn't follow the color in quality. The aroma consists mainly of woodsy notes and light malt tones. The overall nose isn't very strong. The flavor has a very woodsy taste. It tastes identical to a homebrew that my friends and I made, that was a failed attempt at a regular stout. We did use Ringwood ale and I am certain this is responsible for the similarities in flavor. The mouthfeel is a tad on the acrid side due to the woodsy taste. There should be chocolate in the flavor of this beer (Schokolade = german for chocolate), but I sure as heck don't taste it. This still is pretty easy to drink, though as I thought my stout was a failure, I think the same of this beer. It's pretty good but nothing special in the slightest."
" ~ This is solid bock. I'm very impressed with the overall drinkability and am glad I nabbed a sixer."
"Thanks Bry."
"This beer pours very dark brown and is translucent only around the edges. It has a quarter-inch of very light brown head. The aroma is dark cocoa and coffee. The taste is deep, rich, dark, roasted coffee and chocolate. The taste is big, but the beer drinks light and is much more dry than sweet. This beer is a delight."
"D: An interesting bock. I felt the chocolate malt flavors overwhelmed the lovely traditional bock flavors. It was a solid beer, but not what I expected when looking for a bock. I would drink it again, but prefer a traditional bock with traditional flavors."
"D- This beer was very good. The ABV makes this a all night drinker. A nice surprise from this brewery. I would look out for this one if you can."
"Notes: Enjoyable beer. Plenty of cocoa and baker's chocolate as well as nuttiness. Neither overly sweet nor bitter, rather a nice balance. Enjoyable Chocolate lager, although it is not amazing. Nice winter brew worth a try."
"Tastes very similar to the aroma, with a hefty dose of bittersweet toffee and butterscotch candy. Hops add notes of grass and peppery spice. Schokolade sits well on the tongue--medium body with a creamy, well-carbonated body and a lasting semi-bitter finish. An impressive Bock, and easily one of the better American-brewed versions of the style I've encountered. Give this one a try."
"Beer is medium body, pretty good for a single bock. Some roast in the back, ever so slight and sweetness up front. Nice mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"The beer pours a dark reddish-brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is a mix of chocolate and dark fruit (cherries). The flavor is chocolate, caramel and toffee. There is also a little bit of dark fruit and possibly some coffee mixed in to the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"This is a good example of bock that isn't overwhelming, flavorful, and a good session bock."
"Overall, a well-rounded beer that is sort of like the bock version of Southern Tier's Choklat. Nothing too memorable and wish it had a little more to it, but then again everyone needs a good 6-pack beer."
"Pours a lovely clear ruby brown, with a nice finger of ecru head that doesn't really lace much at all. The smell is heavy on the syrup, molasses, and chocolate, with some slight plum and fig hints poking through the haze as well. The taste is of darker malts and more of a cocoa than a chocolate flavore. A fine combination of chocolatiness and bockiness! The body is a light medium and runs velvety smooth over the tongue, allowing this brew to be drunk and enjoyed for many an hour."
"Overall I found this to be a very nice take on the style and one of the more drinkable bocks that I've had the pleasure of enjoying."
"Drinkability: Another great brew from Millstream. Schokolade Bock melds the best qualities of stout, brown ale, and amber ale, and makes for a very enjoyable drink."
"Still a decent beer, not my favortie from Millstream. Best of luck in your findings. Cheers."
"D - Extremely easy to drink, the light feel with the great flavor make the experience nearly effortless. It took me two bottles just to finish this review."
"I definitely felt the desire to move on to something else after finishing this beer."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer as it had some interesting aromas and look, but for a ""chocolate"" bock I really didn't get much chocolate character. The final few sips there was a strong hint of chocolate but throughout it wasn't noticeable. Still, a fun beer to drink"
"Overall, a rather damn good call. It's not a big beer, but the subtleties are nuts."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and sharp due to a high amount of carbonation. It's a little biting. Great chocolate flavors mixed with a warm breadiness. Lots of sweet maltiness in this one. This is a very pleasant beer. Nothing harsh about this at all. Very high drinkability. I could have a few of these for sure."
"D--Easy drinking for sure, definitely sessionable but there is nothing at all that stands out with this beer. I'm going to go out to Millstream one of these days and hopefully sample this fresh from the tap and hope it is a little better. But this one didn't impress me at all, nor did it turn me away."
"Interesting concept that leaves an incredibly cocoa-y flavor in the mouth but I'll pass on another."
"A very good brew which I could drink many of!"
"Solid choice overall in the bock category."
"Thanks, BuckeyeNation, for the opportunity"
"Taste starts out quite dry and chalky with cocoa, strong fizzy carbonation is a bit of a distraction, but once that is over it becomes creamier with some nice roasted malt and more cocoa, slight bitterness from the chocolate. Pretty interesting bock."
"Smooth full mouthfeel despite somewhat aggressive carbonation. Impressively simple."
"Pours a transluscent dark brownish maroon color with a medium fizzy tan head. Smell is dusty cocoa, with chocolate malt. Taste is similar with a slightly thin body and dusty cocoa/choclate flavor. Pretty drinkable with medium carbonation and not bad at all. Friendly, easy drinking, but simple beer."
"It has a lot of flavor to take in, which stays mostly towards the back of the tongue. The dark color and thickness are surprisingly pleasant. The aroma is slightly chocolately. I would say it's a good dessert beer."
"D: This is a real bock...full of flavor and a pleasure to drink. Its light body, low ABV and pleasant flavor make it a great candidate for a session brew."
"D- pretty sweet reminds me of the black diamond bock from saranac which i was also a fan of."
"I grabbed this at the sterling Sun Singer. It pours a dark ruby red with a quickly dissipating finger of tan froth that leaves no trace of its existence. The nose improves as the beer warms, emitting chocolate, caramel and coffee malts. The carry through into the taste very well. Better carbonation would assist Schokolade Bock, for this flattens rather quickly. Yet on the whole, this is pretty good bock, flavorful and smooth. Not top of the line, but worth grabbing and enjoying."
"D - This is a pretty good bock. Great appearance and a good taste."
"Drinkability: An excellent bock that I was quite surprised to encounter. This was brought back from Iowa by a friend and I had left it in my fridge for a couple of months. I will get more if I can find it!"
"Dark amber brown color with a quickly dissipating head; no head retention and no lacing. Smell is pretty nice; some caramel, dark fruit, and some cocoa powder. Taste is fairly sweet with a chocolate-y finish; maybe some caramel in there, too. High side of medium carbonation with heavier than medium body. I could probably see myself having a few of these in an evening. Pretty good beer."
"Finish was a nice, long, sweet and warming. I enjoyed this even in the dead of summer, though I can see how it would be more enjoyable next to a fire as a true winter warmer. Just a little too sweet to have more than one."
"Dry finishing, I could go for a sixer in the fall whilst sitting my arse on the deck watching the leaves fall."
"D: I really wanted to like this one. I'm a fan of the 'bock' and a chocolate/'schokolade' one sounded intriguing. Simply found this one too quirky on the tongue, too sticky in the mouth, too gassy in the gut. I finished, but not by much. I believe this beer was still fresh enough, but just was not the right beer for my taste."
"Mouthfeel is a tad thin for my liking...a little watery. The body is somewhat disappointing, so more than one of these probably wouldn't happen with me. If that was less watery it would really improve."
"Bottle of Iowa beer courtesy of mynie. Thanks!"
"The drinkability is very good I can see this going down well almost any time. Prosit, MK"
"A short but creamy cap of tan covers a clear reddish-chestnut body in Millstream's Schokolade Bock. The head retention is good and it leaves craggy walls of lace in its wake. The nose is subtly roasty and darkly chocolate-ish. The flavor, however, is fuller. It's gently bready, but with a caramelish side, and there actually is some ""schokolade"" to this beauty. It's not rich or full, but it does lean towards maltiness, and as it warms it tends to express a fuller character. There's some nuttiness, and the bitterness is reminiscent of walnut skins. It's clean, and it finishes dry with a quick passing notice of the bitterness, followed by some lingering dull caramel and dusty chocolate. Enjoyable!"
"Tasty and drinkable bock. I easily drank the bottle and would like another."
"An excellent drinker!! Why? The texture, weight, and carbonation step aside and allow you to really enjoy the flavor of this beer. And the flavor is very enjoyable. There is nothing here to slow you down. One of my favorites from Millstream, and one of the best bocks IÂ’ve had."
"Easily the best bock I've ever had. Try it while it's fresh."
"Dark reddish-brown color with a thin, bubbly tan head. Musty malt & nut aroma. Some fruit notes in the taste, but it's mostly a light roasted malt flavor and bitter nutty aftertaste. A bit thin & oily for my taste, but it's got pretty decent flavor and certainly an easy-drinking bock. Great with chocolate also."
"Thanks BIG Ol ZAP..."
"Impressive bock...easy drinking and tasty....worth a try for sure.."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a dark brown color with no head. The aroma is chocolate, burnt wood, and a bit of licorice. Caramel flavor, though not overly sweet. Cocoa and berry flavors come in, though they are secondary to the caramel. Finishes slightly spicy and bitter. A bit sour in the finish too. Very smooth mouthfeel, which also makes this beer quite drinkable. Give this a try if you are a fan of the bock style."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"Very smooth and drinkable. Thanks to Hopheadken for putting me on to this fine bock."
"Thick, creamy, light brown colored head. Mildly sweet malt aroma. Dark brown beer has a mahogany hue. Chocolate malt flavors up front, sweetens up in the middle before fading into the finish. Body is a bit thing. Smells pretty good, tastes pretty good, but it never quite comes through. Thanks BuckeyeNation."
"I just found a bottle of one of these in my six pack of Warsh Pail Ale, so I figured I would give it a proper review instead of my tap room sampler. Looks like a proper bock, very dark and caramel-ish with a decent tan head. The smell is a bit grainy and malty with a hint of mocha. Tastes a bit chocolatey as well as sweet and malty. Very good. Almost tasted like a brown ale to me without being out of the bock style. Mouthfeel was perfect, but for some reason I couldn't find myself drinking this in a session, even though the ABV is about within range."
"Uncomplicated, easy going, and quick-drinking, not to mention a nice little traditional spin on the bock style."
"This beer is NOT drinkable. I don't know if I can find another one and try it later."
"taste begins fruity, cherries and dates, then gets a little bitter and gritty, roasty,nutty, and it ends about there. Mouthfeel is medium, finish is brief and still chocolatey. A bit fizzy, and a bit more bland. Sorry, to say, ....it's not bad at all, just lacking what we'd really like from a bock. Flavor just leaves a lot to be desired. could be a lot tastier, more rich, full, maltiness is in order."
"Taste: Okay, this is a bock. Dang, I've never had that caramelly bock mixed with chocolate before. That's kinda interesting. In the end, the chocolate dominates. After the chocolate, I get some rebounds of chocolate, but nothing new to really captivate my interest. Medium bodied (bordering on medium-thick) with some sharp carbonation on the tongue piercing home. Boy, I wish there was more to this beer. It's got the sweet to carry things along, but all I get is chocolate and a distant caramel. One dimensional, which could make for a good session beer, but it's just too sweet for that. I'd love to support the home team, but I just can't do it."
"Taste is soapy-sweet, rummy malt. Light roasted flavors mingle, paving the way for some spicy hops that gradually come in, resulting in a meaty-homebrew bitterness that lasts long into the finish. Medium-bodied, not cloying or too thick. Not bad, but this doesnÂ’t do a lot for me."
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the trade. This Bock pours a dark brown color with a medium light tan head. Thin and spidery lacing. The aroma is lightly malty with chocolate undertones. Medium-bodied and very sweet with chocolate malt, caramel and nut flavors. Some smoke can be detected at times too. The finish is lightly sweet and not very interesting or flavorful but luckily it doesnÂ’t detract too much from the experience. All in all a fair Bock."
"Thanks to mentor for sending me a brigade of Iowa brews!"
"Backwash: Another beer that makes me wonder why Iowans would ever buy a macro beer. Millstream beers remind me a bit of Ithaca BrewingÂ’s offerings (except for the bigger Ithaca beers). They are generally well done, but lack some flavor and body concentration. All-around, a fine effort."
"Smooth malt driven joy. Nice mix of chocolate & coffee with a slight plum flavour that keeps me on my toes. Finishes with a slight metallic twang, & no significant hop flavours. Medium / full bodied, weak carbonation. Very easy drinking."
"Because I live in a state that has only one brewery, I'd like to be able to say that I enjoy the hell out of their beer. 'Drink local' and all that. Schokolade Bock doesn't do much for me though. I'd like to think that it's a couple of fixes away from being good so I'll keep trying it year after year and hope that some changes are made. For now though, I think I'll stick with a few of Millstream's other offerings."
"The beer as it extravasates the bottle is a deep limpid sanguineous color with the head Bunyanesque in size, spumescent in texture and a beauteous light tan color, the lace forms a silky skirt to surround the glass. Nose is sweet chocolate, caramel, slightly earthy, crisp and clean to the senses. Start is a bit tart with a sweet malt background; the top is fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a delightful acidity, the hops personable in their spicy presence, somewhat vinous aftertaste that is also quite dry, an interesting beer and I was given this beer quite some time ago by BelgiumBum, and I thank him for a chance to sample this most unique beer."
"Pours a very dark brown with a head that goes away quickly. Leaving a thin rim of lace around the glass. Aroma is a nice mellow malt and chocolate. Taste is very nice. Nice dark chocolate and malt bitterness. The bitterness is finely balanced with malt. The mouthfeel and finish are a little dry. That is fine. This is an excellent bock."
"Notes: Perhaps one of the best Bocks I have has to date. The taste is flawless and it is so drinkable. A prime example of the style."
"Overall, a decent bock I wouldn't mind trying again to see if this was just a bad bottle or not. However, given this beer's scarcity, that's not likely. Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this difficult to obtain Iowa beer!"
"Reddish brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and sweet.A medium bodied bock. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. There is a residual sourness/tartness that sort of dominates everything else in this beer. The finish is surprisingly dry. The dryness and the unexpected sourness (is it supposed to be there? Or is the beer infected?) make this an interesting and very different bock beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and a little sour."
"This beer is a almost-black colored brew, with dark brown tones showing through the light. Small brown head that takes off quick. The aroma is of roasted chocolate. The first thing that hits my tounge in this brew is a strong nug taste. Im not a big nut fan so i cant tell you what kind, but thats about half the taste. The other tastes are hints of chocolate, but for me this is dominated by nuts. That said, i think its a fairly tasty beer. Like the other offerings from Millstream, i think its uniqueness is enough of a reason for you to try this, besides that its not half bad either."
"Hazy ruddy chestnut hue. Persistent, stiff, beige head leaves tattered lace. Stately, lightly buttery medium toffee along with hints of nutty carob upfront in aroma. Herbal hop tinge surfaces and fades quickly as the brew breathes. Simple and well rounded aromawise. Bready basemalt sweetness initially in flavor tightens into a more descript toasty dark Munich and soft caramel combination. Ashen hints of oily, lightly caramelized bland pecan persist as an undertone. Notes of dried cocoa emerge along with trace grainy sourness as it warms, but the latter is well understated and unobtrusive. Well calculated gentle hop presence partially offsets residual sweetness and leaves a floral kiss. A touch too lean in body, but with respectable dextrinous viscosity in mouthfeel. Finishes with an abrupt snap of rich, date like sweetness, but otherwise cleanly dry. A well brewed and balanced bock, that only falls a notch short in malt complexity and body. A fine example of a broad, yet underbrewed style. A nice change from the brewpub Maibock or Doppel. Highly drinkable and soft on the palate."
"Pours a one-fingered white head that goes quickly and leaves no lace. Deep amber color. Moderate carbonation. Starts with a good mix of malt and hops, finishes on the dry and slightly hoppy side. Described as dark and chewy, its dark but only medium bodied. The ABV is 5.7%."
