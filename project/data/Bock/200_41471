The taste is a complex blend of yeast, citrus, malts, and bread that finishes with an ever so slight bitterness. Thereâ€™s a lot going on here making it very tasty and enjoyable. It drinks smooth and has great volume. Quite well made.","Lemke10","Dec 28, 2012"

3.08,-17.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Didn't think there was as much caramel in this thing as many of the reviews mention it, the body and mouthfeel seem to be much lighter than a caramel reference. Just a lot of pale malt and noble hops maybe. A little cleanliness of the overall beer lets a little warming alcohol in.","Beerandraiderfan","Dec 18, 2011"
3.08,-17.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"This poured out as a brown color, it had a good amount of clarity to it also. The head was foamy and tan in color. The lacing was decent but nothing too sticky on the glass. The smell of the beer had a good amount of malts on the nose and gave off some toasted caramel notes. The taste of the beer was sweet and had a nice lightly roasted finish to it. The mouthfeel of the beer had a medium body with a good carbonation to it. Overall this bock wasn't too bad but it wasn't one I needed to have again.","Knapp85","Dec 03, 2011"

3.36,-9.7,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Aroma was somewhat muted, not as strong as I would have thought. First impression was of a slightly cereal like graininess that was mixed in with a somewhat earthy, or grass like bite a touch of some banana like characters were noted. A touch of spice in the finish seemed to give it a little bite and helped to give it that little bit extra it needed to make it stand out. Some residual sweetness left over in the aftertaste lingered around for quite a few minutes before again being replaced by that earthy malt flavor","mikesgroove","May 13, 2011"

3.53,-5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a rich caramel scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is decent as well. It has a smooth caramel malt flavor along with a lingering maltiness and dry finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average bock. I love the malty character. It's bold without being over the top.","WesWes","Mar 20, 2011"
3.55,-4.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O- A decent bock, but nothing I would consider much above average. Something of a pedestrian effort unfortunately. That being said, I'd like to try it on tap because it seems like one of those beers that could be so much better on tap.","jsprain1","Mar 14, 2011"
3.76,1.1,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Gorgeous pour, with creamy thick head and a glorious golden to amber color. Nose is on the lighter side for me with some toasty grain and a faint hint of herbal hops. Palate offers a nice malt forward sweetness with light hops to balance, some dry bread crusty qualities are there, and finishes like a big spoonful of grapenuts cereal (in a good way). Medium bodied, drinkable, but also the alcohol is a bit too forward, even within the bock style.","yemenmocha","Dec 09, 2010"
3.12,-16.1,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Thanks to Grapeshops for the extra. Poured from 12oz bottle (no date stamp) into snifter glass. Pours a glassy, honey-colored orange. Spotty lace, minimal watery head. A pale malt with a very mild, spicy hop. Roasted malt aroma with a naughty splash of liqueur alcohol. The aroma is very light but good. A hint of roasted toffee flavor in the malt, with a conspicuous layer of alcohol. becomes more burnt, more bitter as it warms. Pale malt blooms at bit at the end. A smooth, buttery feel. A mild sting on the way down. A mild, roasted bock overall. Average bock IMO.","CuriousMonk","Nov 21, 2010"
4.12,10.8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"The body is medium verging on full, and this is pretty robust. There's a nice, thick smoothness to it as well. The feel is actually pretty lush, the malts bringing out lots of smoothness and body and the hops adding a touch of dryness that doesn't detract.","Brenden","Beers"
3.8,2.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D - Overall, a very tasty and well balanced beer. Combinations of flavors works well together and are well balanced and complex. Pretty drinkable overall.","ngeunit1","0"
4.25,14.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The color was a hazy amber with a golden hue with loads of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of roasted malts and spice, along with other components that I couldn't put my finger on was evident. But, upon the first couple of sip's, I could taste the roasted malts, with a touch of sweet caramel, semi-sweet chocolate, coriander, rye and a hint of orange peel, I think. This is a complex Bock. Nicely balanced and a pleasant surprise.","BeerManDan","May 20, 2010"
4.29,15.3,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A nice ""loaner"" from Rubby this brew is a clear copper color with a modest off-white head and good lacing. The aroma is a solid malt and deep sweet licorice and bayberry. Wow! The flavor brings toasted malt and light licorice like the aroma suggested. I get some apple fruit sweetness and maybe a hint of toasted almond. Very solid with a solid medium body and smooth, silky feel, that offers good drinkability for the style. There's caramel and molasses to be found. Drink at room temperature to fully appreciate this one. A great brew that should win over most bock fans. Not sure where so many low BA ratings are coming from on this one. I liked this bock as much as any I've ever had, though I'll admit that this is no typical bock.","Durge","May 01, 2010"

3.08,-17.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"There isn't really anything WRONG with this bock beer, but there's very little to recommend it over your good local offering (for me, Olde Mecklenburg) or a fine German import. A pity, but then again, I got it on the cheap.","kkipple","Apr 18, 2010"
3.89,4.6,3,4,4,3.5,4,"I only paid 4.99 for six of these, and at that price, I seriously like it. If I had paid more, I wouldn't be so overwhelmed, but you can't beat those numbers.","kwakwhore","Apr 18, 2010"

3.9,4.8,4,4,4,3,4,"Drinkability: Not too bad overall -- a nice spring beer with a great smell and flavor to accompany it; ultimately, the body isn't too heavy and the oily nature of it is the only real downfall that I came across with it; ABV is fairly moderate and I'd feel pretty good about getting through a couple of these in a sitting.","bamadog","Apr 08, 2010"
3.75,0.8,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Bought a six pack of this on sale for $4.99. Pours a lighter amber color with a thin off-white head. The aroma is mostly juicy malt, with some toasted bread and caramel qualities, along with green apples, coconut, and some mineraly and minty hops and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is a little less impressive than the aroma with some doughy bread notes upfront, along with some herbal and mineraly hops, ripe green apple, a little caramel and some booze. The mouthfeel is spot on for a maibock, and drinkability is good but not great due to the ABV.","silver0rlead","Mar 19, 2010"
2.46,-33.9,3,2,2.5,3,2.5,"Red Tail from this brewery was once a great beer, about 12 years ago. But, the quality has slipped and all the Mendocino beers have become lower rung ""craft beer"" offerings. This bock is sickeningly sweet, like drinking several table spoons of dark brown sugar in syrupy, carbonated water. There are some sharp flavors and a grainy mouthfeel that recall some idea of decent beer, but just barely. The richness and slight sweetness of good bock is replaced here by nothing but extreme sweetness. It's tough to get one down and affords little reward for the effort, except the 7% ABV which may be the best characteristic of this beer. Many better bocks (almost any other bock is better) are available. Leave this one on the shelf.","MNJR","Mar 12, 2010"

3.5,-5.9,3,3,3.5,4,4,"Pours a slightly clear, lil murky gold hue. No head whatsoever. Faint malty aromas. Definitely smells a like a dark lager, very pleasing. I'm definitely tasting more lager than bock. The caramel and sweet notes are there but faintly. I kind of feel like that this is similar to Anderson Valley's Crema Cerveza, which I LOVE. This is definitely a great, refreshing beer. perfect to match with some heavy, even spicy foods. I'm not quite sure it achieved what it wanted, or what I wanted, from a bock. This is definitely somethig in between a lager and bock.","100floods","Oct 19, 2009"
4.09,9.9,3,4,4.5,3.5,4,"D â€“ Very drinkable. Great beer for pairing with rich food. Also a candidate for Das Boot.","ktrillionaire","Oct 16, 2009"
3.23,-13.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"D - There is a lot of malt richness here, and the hops do a good job balancing it out and keeping the beer drinkable. Unfortunately, it is a bit rough and the alcohol shows through more that I would have expected it to. There is a cloying burnt toast character to the malt in the finish and the beer lacks the smooth and refined character that I want to see in a good lager. A nice try, but I wouldn't bother with this one again.","nickfl","Sep 16, 2009"
3.72,0,3.5,4,4,3.5,3,"Wow a 7.0% brew and a ""Bock"" no less. Never had a bock that I haven't enjoyed. Until now I see its an HG Bock. Let's give it a whirl. Upon opening the bottle smell is indeed malt. This smells like a dubbel or even a tripel. Some very dry but spicy hops linger in the background. Pours into a pint with a nice dark copper color and a thin head that is quickly gone. Taste is well, wow, sure this isn't a dubbel or a tripel? Very thick and almost syrupy. Sweet with only a hint of dry hops in the faint background. I could almost pour this on pancakes, I think. A good offering, a lager to knock off the socks. I like it for one, but for me too sweet, for more.","mooseisloose","Sep 09, 2009"

3.28,-11.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"This is a great brew if you're going for one or two, but the ABV and the heavy flavor will kill it for a session beer. I'm not a fan of fruity beers, but this one is very rich, malty and full bodied. It will stand against brown ales, stouts, and porters as a meaty ""he-man"" brew.","Trigcove","Jul 27, 2009"

4.09,9.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D-I could see enjoying a few of these from time to time....not a classic or anything like that but a nice little bock that is kind of a blend between a tradition doppelbock and regular maibock....","ZAP","Beers"

3.77,1.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a transparent amber/red color with a small white head that leaves some soapy sticking. Sweet candy apple, caramel, small whiffs of alcohol, toffee and subtle chocolate. Sweet in flavor but quickly drying on the finish, no real bitterness to note, very fruity and yeasty for the style. Medium/light mouthfeel, low carbonation, very drinkable.

3.11,-16.4,3.5,2.5,3,4,3.5,"D -- This isn't a bad drinking beer, just not what I'd expect from a German-style Lager -- very ale-like in it's character. Maybe I found this too late in the season? I can't find any dating on the bottle.","steveh","Jun 13, 2009"

3.99,7.3,3,4,4,4.5,4,"2009. 12oz served at about 55Âº. Pours a bright brown color with hues of amber when held to the light. Thin white head dissipates quickly. Aromas of sweet malts and caramel fill the nose. Mouth-feel is more syrupy than expected and actually pleasant on the palate. Tastes are of caramel and toasted grains with some faint hints of weak coffee. Finishes sweet and crisp. Very well brewed Bock!","barnzy78","May 19, 2009"
3.88,4.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Clean and easy-drinking, but hindered slightly by its somewhat lofty 7% ABV, which is not overly elevated but does serve as a hindrance to quaffing.

2.88,-22.6,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"Mendocino Bock is a very clear light amber beer with an off-white head that fades. It has a slightly boozy, slightly sweet aroma. It is medium-light bodied with a smooth, slick finish. It's a little sweet, resiny, grainy and funky. Yeah, it's a Bock.

Mildly rich. Smooth almost slick texture. Soft carbonation. Yet it all goes down easily with enjoyable lager feel and cleanliness. Above moderate feel. A bit dry for my liking.

A lot of lacing on the glass. Aroma is floral with bready malts and perhaps a touch of caramel but most of it is rather subtle. Medium-bodied, clean and refreshing. The flavor starts with some caramel malt with hops staying in the background. It finishes with a touch of bitter hops. Didn't wow with flavor but there's enough there to make it a solid beer.

Spring-like, earthy citric hops hit my nose and were mixed with caramel and some other light malts. The alochol is somewhat noticeable, giving this beer a little bit of an edge and a drying backbite. Still, I thought it was medium-bodied and a mix between smooth and sticky as it seemed to be a little syrupy. Good hop taste, definitely some lemon peel and other citric notes in the hops, along with caramal and something like cinammonesque as there was a sweet malt taste in this beer. Not the most complex bock out there but it has a little bit of everything for most drinkers and I could sit around and have a couple of these here and there.","clayrock81","Aug 06, 2008"
3.88,4.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This was an unexpected find on the shelf at Winehaus in Seaside as Spring had turned to Summer. The beer is a full bodied malty lager with a goodly addition of hops.

Food friendly and easy to drink I wish more brewers would make Maibocks in the Spring as the shoulder season is often ignored.","canucklehead","Jul 26, 2008"
3.55,-4.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Even though I'm not doing handstands and cartwheels, Mendocino Bock Beer is one of the better offerings from a brewery that is responsible for some pretty lousy beer. Bottom line: one cloven hoof (most of the way) up.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 24, 2008"
3.94,5.9,3,4,4,4,4,"12 oz bottle: Pours a light amber color, clear, with a slightly off white/tan head that lingers at the top of the glass. Aroma is nice caramel malt texture, graininess, toffee, and just a really nice robust aroma. Taste is got a nice malt characteristic, some sweetness, going through the toffee, into a really nice finish. Palate is almost sweet on the lips, nice ad malty bitter on the tongue, and the finish is this lingering malty sweetness. Overall, I thought I wouldn't like this brew, but I'm really enjoying it. Cheers!","demitriustown","Jul 04, 2008"

4.2,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a medium copper with a slight head that dropped quickly. A lot of rasin and plum in the nose. Taste is stronger than the aroma would suggest, full and rich in the mouth, with a nice bitter finish. Hoppy but no so much as to overwhelm the malt. A robust and pleasing beer. Very nice.","alexskovan","Jun 09, 2008"

Medium bodied with a solid malt base. Slight hop bitterness to balance malt sweetness. A good American bock, malt is focused and not flabby. 7% ABV that you don't usually see in an American bock.","homebrewhawk","May 25, 2008"
3.78,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The aroma is fruity apple. The taste is tart, sour apple followed by a bitter hop flavoring. The hop flavor is pretty bitter, but, not like a standard ale.

3.85,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Amber in color-a tad darker then I thought it should be. Noble hop aroma-a bit over done, it could use more malt in the nose. Decent malt flavor with an even balance of hop bitterness. Has a good malty sweetness across the board with a slight bite in the finish. Good, full body that a heavy hand of malt provides. Very close the almost ""buttery softness"" I have found over in Germany. Very good and enjoyable overall.","lackenhauser","Apr 29, 2008"
4.15,11.6,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"A very nice interpretation of a Maibock. Great looking, rocky, white head on the pour, plenty of lacing all the way down the glass. Smells of sweet Munich malts, esthery yeasts and caramel. A bit sweet is the only drawback. Very strong bock, extremely dry and crisp on the finish with few hops. I have always liked Mendocino beers and was extremely satisfied with this one.","bigdeuce","Apr 28, 2008"
3.01,-19.1,4.5,3.5,3,3,2,"Nice medium body and very smooth mouthfeel, despite the alcohol. It loses points for drinkability because of its general weirdness in my eyes but retains its taste points for maintaining such a unique combination of flavors.","wiseguy142","Apr 21, 2008"

3.97,6.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a water goblet. Nice pale amber color with a good foam head, that dissipates very quickly to leave a thin ring for the rest of the session. The smell is the sweet malt and a faint alcohol on the nose. A touch of caramel in the aroma. Taste is a sweet caramel and a little unrefined sugars. The body is full and there is a slick coating in the aftertaste. There is a crisp afterbite, must be a touch of hops. This is one that I prefer to have a few per sitting.","phishgator","Apr 08, 2008"

4.07,9.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability- Very drinkable even with a considerable amount of alcohol. This very well could be my favourite traditional bock out of America. This one will have to have a head to head with Penn's St. Nik bock for the final verdict.","blakesell","Mar 30, 2008"
