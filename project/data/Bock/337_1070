The nose has hints of brown malt, loads of caramel, rather buttery caramel/toffee with a hint of grain underneath. The taste is much of the same but sweeter, buttery caramel and toffee cascade over the tongue as a fruity malt sweetness plays in back. The grain sits faintly underneath. The body is super creamy and lush, lighter carbonation but the body is actually rather airy itself.","cpetrone84","Mar 20, 2012"

The taste is slightly sweet with some hop bitterness to balance. The roasted barley malt definitely comes through in the taste, but the flavors are certainly a bit odd. There is light carbonation and the beer has a medium body. There is a lingering aftertaste. This is an interesting and fairly easy to drink bock. I would recommend it.","acevenom","Mar 18, 2012"

3.83,6.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a muddy light brown color with a thin off-white head. Limited spotty lacing on the sides of the glass before falling into a thin collar. The nose is fairly plain with some bready malt and a touch of caramel. Bread crust there, too. The flavor brings some malt sweetness and lightly-toasted bread. Slightly doughy with some caramel and light toffee. Perhaps a bit nutty. Light bitterness in the midpalate and in the finish. Actually, perhaps a bit too much bitterness, as it cuts through the sweet caramel that makes the flavor so enjoyable. The feel is medium with good carbonation. A solid take on the style.","Thorpe429","May 02, 2011"
3.73,3.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D - A slightly above-average bock. Probably the definition if 'B' beer. Enjoyable in the moment, but not something I'd seek out again. Carbonation zest would keep me from having multiple bottles/pints.","MasterSki","Apr 19, 2011"

Seems to have lots of earth tones. Smells good but not very aromatic. You have to dig for it. Taste is of toasted grains and bread like. It has some bitter hops flavor as well. Nothing to special. Close to light bodied and high carbonation. Which makes it a little refreshing for a bock seeing is that the flavors are mellow. Drinkability is high in the sense that nothing is over powering. Although ABV would bring it down. An average beer at best. A little better than shiner bock.","depechemode1983","Feb 12, 2011"

4.18,16.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pale & pilsner malts starting things off in the flavor department--some caramel notes pull through as it warms. Grassy hops lend a healthy dose of bitterness to balance the malt; mineral-water crispness with a trace of musty, sour sulfur in the finish. Mouthfeel is where St. Arnold's Spring Bock shines, as its medium-light body is both crisp and creamily smooth at the same time. Lingering bitter note from the hops is mild enough to allow the malt to sweeten up the back of the palate. Wow...what an underrated beer. Wish I would've known sooner. Definitely a repeat for me this spring...next stop: six-pack.","wagenvolks","Jan 29, 2010"
3.94,9.4,3,4,4,4,4,"on tap at Petrol station. Clear, bright copper color, 1/2 finger of foam with a half life of about 20 seconds. The aroma is malty-sweet and a little toasted, very much bock-y. The taste is what I would call strong lager, sweet, clean, and malty. Absolutely appropriate for the style while not being anything too out of the ordinary. The bodyis medium-plus, again giving appropriate bock presence. Very good for the style, should be rated higher in my opinion.","TurdFurgison","Beers"

The flavor profile is sweet caramely malts playing off of toasty malts and a slight hop bitterness. Taste is pretty similar to the nose. A mild alcohol bite ensues in mid-palate and the finish is decently clean for a bock. It's ok, but perhaps a bit too toasty for me.

Nose has sweet ripe grape skins matched with soft but zesty phelonic spicey tones. As you take first sip you get creamy carmalized sweetness and dusty peppery feel. The spice feel is consistant and very dry throughout the palate. Leaves kind of a bitter resin like mouthfeel. Would maybe go well with a piece of rubarb pie.

3.35,-6.9,4,4,3,3.5,3,"Tastes dark toasted malt that's drying from solid ferment. A mild flat sour cuts the wet and clears the way for hop flavor. Rounded flower hops, but also a dirty and vegetal contribution. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is moderate. If the flavors were more pleasing the mouthfeel would help with the flavors. Because the flavor is a bit unfavorable, the mouthfeel holding the flavors on the tongue is a negative.","mentor","Jul 26, 2008"

3.5,-2.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a bottled on notch (Dec 06) on the front label. Had a very small head that quickly disappeared. The color was a clear amber/copper with good carbonation. The aroma was very bready with bunch of sweet malt and a hint of caramel. The mouthfeel was standard. The taste was malty with a good hint of the alcohol in it - warms you up as you drink which surprised me since only 6.4%. It's a middle of the road beer for me - not great but not bad. Don't see a place for this in my regular rotation but worth having a single or two each year. (3.5, RB, T, O)","TexIndy","Aug 14, 2006"
4.45,23.6,4.5,4.5,5,4,3.5,"Looks golden with a little red in it. Smells of lots of flavor, light but complex - almost citrusy, can't quite put my finger on it. Tastes sweet and heavy, what I smelled came back for more. Heavier on the tongue than I would have expected, given the color, but right for a bock. Carbonated just right. I probably couldn't drink as much of this in one sitting as I want - our Texas spring is like everyone else's deep summer, I imagine this would be a lot better in a cooler evening after some hard labor in the sun.","jordanmills","Apr 22, 2006"

Head fades down to a film of small bubbles pretty quick, but with ample lacing. Aroma is a bag of grain, with plenty of fruitiness. Taste is great maltiness, the tinges of fruit in the middle, with a slightly gritty close. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is very nice. Mmm, bock.","ppoitras","Apr 16, 2006"

Aromas of fresh malts, with a very pronounced vegetal character. Taste is medium bodied and very malty; dense roasted malt, grain, spiced herbs, a touch of caramel.

3.7,2.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Opinion: Well...this is a pretty drinkable beer, but it is severely lacking to be considered a Bock. There needs to be a bunch more toastiness along with some Melanoidin presence. This beer is closer to an Oktoberfest as it is a Bock in my opinion. It still lacks the malt presence for an OFest also, but that style is closer. This is a clean and well-crafted beer, but closer to the Dark Lager category than it is in the Bock category. Oh well...maybe next year it will shape up. We have had better years of this style.","SkeeterHawk","0"

3.68,2.2,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Pours with a frothy amber colored head that sits atop a orange-amber colored beer. The aroma has notes of caramel and a sweet concentrated, fruity maltiness that I associate with strong Lagers and notes of toasted malt. The taste is sweet up front with a rich malty finish that almost has a meatiness to it. I get notes of bergamot in this beer, though it seems to be a mix of the maltiness and perhaps the subtle hopping. This beer has a medium full body to it that coats the mouth with sweet malt notes. The finish has a bit of bitterness as well as an astringency that is a mix of toasted malts and a tannic like drying. Definitely interesting and tasty, though it could use a bit more oomph.","Gueuzedude","Apr 08, 2005"

3.6,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer reminds me a lot of Abita Amber which I most recently consumed about a week ago. Spring Bock's appearance is caramel amber in color with the usual slight head featured in Saint Arnold beers. The aroma is of sweet bready malts and a touch of grain. Taste is malty sweet, almost a little sugary, mainly of caramel malts. Overall, I find this to be a very drinkable, but not quite rich or complex enough.","Gagnonsux","Mar 04, 2005"

3.14,-12.8,3,4,3,3,2.5,"The copper color is good for its style. The head is lacking. As it pours, it appears to be low on carbonation (even less than its style). The smell brightens the senses and wants to make up for the lackluster carbonation. The first taste is a very good malty sweetness. As it swishes in the mouth one gets the hint of hops. After a couple of minutes, the taste becomes dominated by caramel. As it warms even more, caramel and almost a buttery taste takes over. This makes the drinkability rather disappointing considering the decline in taste is quite rapid.","dungaree","Feb 10, 2005"

4.1,13.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a carmel/red color, with a small creamy tan head. Smell is carmely and malty, with hints of brown sugar. Taste is supersweet with brown sugar and carmel flavors. Slight roasted quality and a hint of alcohol are also present in the flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, perfect carbonation that seems to sit in the background. Drinkability is good, I could down quite a few of these. A very good beer from a brewer that I have never heard of until a week ago, but I now respect each of their offerings. Thanks aain assurbanipaul for the Texas sized trade. (even though I hate the "Texas-Sized" cliche)","TastyTaste","Jul 11, 2004"
4.15,15.3,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Sampled from bottle. Pours a crystal clear chestnut brown with a thin, scattered, off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is mild roasted malts and is, for the lack of a better word, clean. Flavor is somewhat bitter for a bock (yeah!) and the roasted/toasty flavors of the caramelized european malts are truly special because the flavors are layered, and not one-dimensional: a complex malt flavor with just a hint of a spicy hop flavor addition. Medium to full-bodied and smooth as glass. A hint of alcohol presence takes a bit away from the mouthfeel, but this is easy drinking. If you are in Texas, home to both Shiner Bock and St. Arnolds, do yourself a favor and pick up the St. Arnolds Bock over the Shiner. You'll be glad you did.","Bdc","May 17, 2004"

Fruity - but, hmm, what fruit? Not a zesty citrus - something more reserved. (sip) A nice, ripe red delicious apple. A wee bit earthy. Lingering malty taste and feel.
