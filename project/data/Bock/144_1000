3.9,2.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"16 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 11/20/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, light roasted malt, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity esters with light hops; very pleasant and inviting with solid strength. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, light fruits, brown bread, light pepper, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of malt/hop flavors with light fruity esters; with a fair amount of robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with and a lightly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol i very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice bock. Good balance and robustness of malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 14, 2013"

The flavor starts out with toasted malt. Fruit and cocoa come in at the middle. A little nutty. The finish is bitter with grassy hops. This beer is not thick, but it is very flavorful. Drinkability is very high. Unlike many bocks, this beer is poundable. Great winter beer, if you're looking for something flavorful but not too heavy.","beveragecaptain","Jan 11, 2006"

4.35,14.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another great brew from one of my favorite breweries. A very well balanced and interesting beer that you can enjoy all night. The tan head is full, and recedes to a patchy film after a short while. Aroma is malty and sweet with toffee. Very well balanced with lots of malt flavor and just enough bitterness to prevent an overly sweet taste, no hop flavor. Mouthfeel is substantial enough to register but no more, dead on. I can drink these all night.","Sixpack595","Feb 10, 2005"
4.43,16.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Oh how I would love to try this on-tap someday, I'm thinking the chocolate tones would really take over and make for an almost creamed porter-like experience. Still, this bottled version is sublime! Drinkability is very easy goin' and lubricious. Goes down fast and without much effort. This is probably my new favorite from Sprecher putting the O-fest and Black Bavarian a close second. Great stuff!","tavernjef","Beers"
4.47,17.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy dark reddish brown with a small light brown head that leaves some lacing. Sweet chocolate cookie dough and dark fruit aromas, plum, dark cherry, caramel, smoky chocolate flavors that blend together so nicely. Medium to full bodied and a very smooth, velvety soft mouthfeel, nice sweet candy like finish. I just wish I had a few more bottles of this well done lager.","maxpower","0"
4.06,6.6,5,4,4,4,4,"This beer is just beautiful. A deep coppery garnet with a light brown head, I probably should have taken a photo. The aroma is initially roasted with hints of chocolate, but as it warms it changes to nutty with hints of toffee and spicey yeast. The flavor is clean and malty with a lingering yeast flavor on my tongue. This beer is excellent, a special thanks goes out to my friend who bought this for me for xmas.","redmosquito","Jan 10, 2005"

3.18,-16.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Tasted at the Goose Island April Beer Academy. Lots of carbonation in this beer, as it pours a medium-brown color with an off-tan head. The scent isn't huge - perhaps a bit of malt, but nothing more. The taste is a bit hoppy, with only a minimal amount of malt presence, especially for a bock. A bit thin and chalky for my taste, and nothing much more.","jahred","Feb 26, 2004"
3.8,-0.3,4,4,4,3,3.5,"I was a bit disappointed with the body of this beer. I was hoping for something fuller, but it was pretty light & on the thin side. Carbonation was dead on, just lively enough for my tastes. A nice winter offering, pretty straightforward in it's approach though.","cretemixer","Feb 25, 2004"
4.35,14.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Oh man, this is the shizznat! Had this on tap at Old Chicago during their ""Christmas Mini-Tour"" and have bought a few four packs of this recently...despite its mid-October born-on date and Sprecher's recommendation that you consume their beer within 120 days, this still tastes great. Those of you familiar with the style of winter seasonals will feel right at home with this beer in its dark color, heavy-but-not-a-stout taste, and unique spice flavor. This beer is a spectacular entry in the style and is the only one of two (Goose Island being the other) that I have liked enough to purchase a four-pack of...another good point about this beer is the 16 oz bottles. Try and snatch up some of this while you can so that you don't have to wait until next year, because it's cheap (at least in the midwest, Sprecher is from Wisconsin) and good. Highly recommended.","chrishickman","Oct 23, 2003"
4.21,10.5,2.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I would have given this a better appearance but I had no option other than drinking it out of the bottle so I can't give an accurate rating. As far as everything else goes, this was a fantastic winter brew! There was a nice full body of spices that balanced perfectly. I have been waiting all winter to try this local favorite and I sure am glad that I did. This is not my favorite winter beer, but the smoothness makes it drinker-friendly!","ALESwhatCURESya","Apr 27, 2003"
4.2,10.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Chestnut brown, creamy cafe au lait head. Warming goodness in the way of malt on the nose and in the mouth. Not too heavy and not too light. Just right for the Winter here in the midwest. A good dose of dark chocolate, caramel, malted, chewy candy candy chimes in throughout. A solid, fresh, and rather tasty seasonal.","moulefrite","Feb 26, 2003"
4.03,5.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Nice rich brown color with a real nice creamy tan-colored ead.Smell was swwet and almost cookie-dough like,taste was roasted and burnt tasting with some caramel sweetness.Sprecher makes some really good beers and this is just another good one,will be trying there doppell bock later today.","oberon","Jan 05, 2003"

4.15,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"A tasty winter brew....almost a cross between a dunkel and a bock..almost a tad thin to be a bock but it has some of its sweeter characteristics...Nose is sweet malt alll the way....It is a reddish amber in color...the taste is roasted grains and sweet malt....finishes with a bock like feel...body is about medium..definitely think enough to drink a few but not too thin...I like this beer but have had better bocks...It is very good though..","ZAP","Dec 15, 2002"
4.6,20.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This brew has a clear deep dark mahogony appearance. Throws out a creamy light brown head that has decent retention. It eventually does recede to a thin film, but still laces rather effectively. Malt, toffee and caramel all mix in on the nose. Toffee, toasted malt, burnt caramel and some slight hop/roasted bitterness come to play on the palate. This is not as sweet as most bocks, but to me, rather, it tastes almost like a hybrid of bock and scwarzbier. I thought this was a dopplebock, but it's not as thick and chewy as a dopple, so I was probably wrong. This beer won a gold at the 2002 World Cup in the European-Style/Muncher Dunkel category. It's a smooth beer and tasty. Body is almost full.","Bighuge","Dec 10, 2002"
3.41,-10.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Rich pour, dark copper brown with a 1/4 inch yellowish head. Really, very little aroma, some sense of sweetness. Medium-bodied with assertive malt, somewhat Dunkel-like with lots of nutty qualities. Proceeds toward a bit of a buttery diacetyl and ends gradually with little sense of distinct hopping. Becomes creamier mid mouth, with a little bit of corn husk qualities in the big aftertaste. Not a bad brew here, not as sweet as some Bocks, but I'm not a major fan. I'll take the Black Bavarian...","ADR","Nov 30, 2002"
4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear dark reddish-brown in color with a tan head. Aroma consists of burnt malt, caramel, coffee and picks up a plum or cherry scent as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Roasted malt and coffee tones dominate. Finish builds on roasted malt flavor and a subtle sweet fruit and spice flavor rounds things out. An enjoyable and rather hearty full-bodied Munich Bock. Great for having on hand to share with company during the Winter season and throughout Spring as things thaw out.","Winter","Feb 27, 2002"
