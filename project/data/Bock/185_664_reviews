"Smooth and creamy, Munich malt I believe. Unbelievable mouthfeel and taste, perfect if I could dare say. Very well done Dunkler Bock, lagered very well, for at least 3 months. Must try from Norways oldest brewery, dating back to 1834! Family owned for four generations now."

"Taste is good. A bit sweet with hints of salmiak. The mouthfeel could be better with some carbonation."

"A really good looking, pretty good tasting beer."
"Cool name though."
"An unremarkable, but enjoyable brew. Definitely better than the Juleol I had last night."
"D: Top notch. At 6.5%, will likely catch up to you before long, but I could really sit down and savor several of these in a sitting. A truly great find."
"Wish I had a fresh bottle to compare...considering the source, this one is probably 5+ years old."
"Happy Spring!"
"Pours a nice medium brown with not much head to speak of,big fruity aromas some orange peel along with some sweet caramel and nuttiness.Taste is dominated by a caramel sweetness with an underlying bread dough maltiness not overly sweet but not much if any hops to be found.Somewhat of a ""modest"" bock but not a bad brew I would drink again givin the chance."
"Very drinkable bock beer, a good example of the style."
"Sweet at first showing off its malty side which is soon followed by a smooth herbaceousness inherent to its hoppy side. A perfect blend of ingredients. Truly a remarkable beer."
"Aass Bock Beer came in a green bottle. The color was an opaque brown capped with a small head that dispersed quickly. The aroma was caramelly with some floral traces. The taste was caramelly and toasted with a hint of molasses. It was also sweet with some hop bite and a bit oily. The finish was semi-sweet, dry, and bitter. Over all it was a fairly smooth and well-balanced beer."
"Mouthfeel is a touch thin but not anything to subtract from enjoyment. Drinakability is high, can imagine a few pints of this would do some damage to the grey matter."
"Presented in a green, 12 ounce bottle. The color is dark brown with a big, puffy, off-white head. Aroma is a dominantly cereal maltiness, with a somewhat fleeting wort-like character. Very nice sweetness up front, and a nice, subtle hop finish keeps the beer from being cloying. Wonderful for sipping. Rich, intense, and marvelously drinkable."
"I had heard that this beer was going to be discontinued, but fortunately it wasn't. A quality bock, with a name that won't soon be forgotten, and hopefully I'll be able to have some more Aass!"
"Got a bottle of this at the Viking in Spokane. Was surprised at how good this beer tastes, considering its coming in a green bottle - probably the first green I've encountered that wasn't at least a little bit skunked. Anyway, it poured a very dark brown, with tinges of red when held towards light. Smell of sweet, fruity malt. Tasted likewise, with very little hop presence. This beer is nothing without its malt. Had a dark yet fruity flavor to it. It was a little ""heavy"" to drink. This is not something I would have downed in any quantity, but it was nice after my meal."
"I've been to Norway, it is a beautiful country and Aass Bock is an incredible beer. Aass (according to their website ""A real Norwegian Viking would pronounce it 'Ouse'."") is brewed in Drammen Norway and comes in a green bottle with an image of little goat drinking from a stein on the label. It pours dark reddish brown with minimal head and leaves a little lacing as it's enjoyed. The smell is of sweet malt and a little carmel. The taste is exceptional. This is beer is the number two reason why I'd like to move to Norway, beat only by the number one reason, the beautiful Norwegian women! Aass is the best bock I've ever tasted. Full bodied and smooth at the same time, it's almost too easy to drink. Sweet malt, carmel, slight fruitiness and a little hops in the finish. Damn, why did I have to be born in the land of Bud and Miller? Do yourself a favor and try Aass Bock. Mmm..."
"I received this from francisweisen today. Thanks and skoal! I sampled this beer a looooong time ago...before Michael Jackson began rating beer or dangling babies from balconies and it's just as I remembered it. Dark brown prune juice in color with a beige/tan head and slow-sliding lace. The aroma is particularly distinct with molasses, coffee, hops, and light alcohol fume. The molasses sweet malty body emits flavors of raisins and prunes and a hint of chocolate. The citrusy hops add just the right amount of bitterness for the style. Nice any season beer!"
"I could see having this beer a few times in my life not and everydayer but on occausion."
"I knew I would fail to miss a pun  Damn, and I tried so hard."
"I've only encountered 2 retailers selling this one within about a 500 miles radius of my place and after having this first time experience with it, I'll be sure to keep my eyes peeled for more of this too. Very reasonably priced ($1.98USD for a 11.2fl oz green bottle)."
"Poured a reddish brown with very little foam that dissapated quickly. The aroma was of a malty grainy smell. The taste was of a sour bitterness that really turned me off. I just don't care for this beer. The sour feeling in my mouth was the turn off!"
"Mahogony in color, the head dissipates quickly. Large bubbles of carbonation cling to the side of the glass like a soda. A malty smell is present. First sip reveals a brown sugar sweet taste with detectable bitterness. A hint of chocolate flavor is revealed too. A great brew for a winter's night."
"Deep red brown color. Medium foamy head. Coffee and chocolate aroma. Full bodied bock. Malty and hoppy. Malts are slightly sweet. Coffee and chocolate flavor. Nice balance. Full flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and slightly dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, a very slight alcohol bite in the aftertaste. Nice bock."
"Bock vs. 2xBock. This doesn't pretend to have the heavy malt of a 2x. For a regular Bock it is hard to top this one for integration, complexity and depth. Not a hammer. Class."
"The beer pours a deep clear garnet the color with the head voluminous and light tan in color, the lace a decent covering upon the glass. Nose is all malt with a sweet hint of caramel; start is inordinately sweet and the top light. Finish is delicately dry, benignly carbonated, leniently hopped, drinkable, but a little ""Weak/watery for this ""olde Strong Beer Lover""."
"Sweet and sticky, raisiny and caramelly, on the sweeter side of the scale, a bit syrupy. Beautiful red-brown colour, with nice off-white head, leaves a nice flavour in your mouth, slightly roasty and bitter."
"Altogether quite drinkable.  I'd like another soon."
"Dark brown and clear color.  Head is a decent 1/4 inch for about 30 seconds, then a yellowish trace.  Woody and chocolatey smell.  Taste is decently malty, a little too sweet, some sense of walnut, toffee, and a bit of a sweetened tea impression.  Touch of twang at the finish.  Decent flavor, enhanced by aroma but too sweet and non-complex for me...the carbonation is on the fizzy side as well."
"This Norwegian bock pours a deep amber hue with a sticky tan head that lasts nicely. The smell is rather nutty and presents a somewhat toasted malt aroma. The taste is rather similar with the nutty, malty flavors taking priority. The mouthfeel was a little thinner than I'd expected. It wasn't as creamy as I'd imagined. As far as drinkability goes, I wasn't overly disappointed that I only had one bottle of this in the fridge. That's not to say it wasn't bad, however for the price I expected more."
"Pours a frothy and sticky tan head over deep mahogany liquid. Malty nose with a tinge of sulfur and grain. Sweet and nutty malt flavor is enhanced by sulfur and balanced out with just the right amount of bittering hops. Creamy and good and worth finding, but the steep price may make it a one-time treat."
"270"
"Aass Bock Beer: Deep almost opaque brown/red color, with a sweet aroma and very sweet taste.  Long lasting aftertaste of molasses, which kind of spoiled my enjoyment of this beer."
"Pours a reddish-brown color, with a light tan, sticky head that dies pretty quick. Huge caramel malt aromaemm so inviting. On the palate, you taste the caramel malts upfront, small bit of fruitiness, and toffee, and almonds in the backgroundvery nice sweetness through out. The mouth feel is buttery smooth. Overall this brew very good. May be one of the finest brews from Norwaya must try..."
"The ABV in Norway is 6,5%. This is the best Norwegian beer you can get. Beautiful, very dark reddish brown colour, moderate carbonation. Complex aroma and flavour, hints of spices, oak and liqourice. Very well balanced. Great aftertaste."
"Deep auburn color.  Creaminess in aroma.  Spicy malt flavor, slightly nutty.  Big mouthfeel (though not too full)."
"I was not that impressed with this beer.  It had decent sweetness, but did not seem that complex to me.  When it warmed slightly, it was better, but average overall."
"Almost as good as their seasonal Jule OL.  Aass makes some of the best beers in the world and this bock is a shining example of the brewery.  Lots of complexity, smooth and delecious"
"Notes: This is a formidable Bock beer. Truly inspired and addictive to the palate. Bottle conditioned."
