"O- The soft bland nougat flavor dominates the other flavors. When it is cold it masks much of the other flavors but as it opens it just gets more odd and difficult to drink."
"another italian special. my heritage. decent, but not great. easy to drink, but not best in class. very good, though. i can finish a few of these before switching over..."
""
"This isn't bad. I liked it, but if you're going to call yourself a double anything, it ought to have more punch (flavor) to it."
""
"Overall: Not bad, especially at the bargain price of $1.99 from Trader Joe’s. It’s a decent, drinkable bottle of malt with an 8% ABV."
"Poured this Bock from a bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a hazy copper color, produced a off white head, decent retention and it left ample lacing on the glass. The aroma consists a base of sweet malted grain, with hints of white pepper and cherry. Medium in body, the foundation of this bock consists of a sweet malted grain base, some spice (white pepper) and cherry and apple juice. Overall, it was average- Odd variation of the style-"
"overall for the price, at 8%, a good deal to get your buzz going."

"Everything considered, it's an interesting beer that's surprisingly unique. The execution could be better, but its charm more than makes up for its faults."

"O: for the price, I was very satisfied with this beer. It is richer and more complex than something I would expect in the ""bargain beer"" catagory. I would drink this again."
""
"M + D: Medium bodied, rather plain. I would prefer a little more carbonation or crispness. Not a bad beer, but not one I'll be repeating anytime soon."
"This pours a ruby amber-malty color with tight foam. I found an ok malty-sweet aroma to it, with something akin to candied cherries and a light caramel aroma. The flavor comes across as sweet and smooth, with a dialed down sweetness. Thin bodied for the style, thinner than I had expected at any rate. There’s a light bitterness with some caramel-toffee hints. Pleasant enough but not one that I’d recommend for anyone with a love of dopplebocks."
""
"I'm sure he swigged some o' this whilst not fiddling, eh? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises fake (Runt-like) banana, maple syrup, light biscuit, powdered sugar, and light sweet flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strangely candied orange peel, which lends a cloying sweetness that doesn't sit well with everything else. Damn delinquents... The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, an odd bock, one that goes all over the place before landing in an unappetizing place. Even for the price, there's plenty better out there, folks."
""
"Other than being in a cool bottle and available pretty cheap from Trader Joe's this beer isn't all it claims to be. Poured a half inch off-white fine froth head with reasonable lifespan. The body is a slightly hazy burn sienna color, not dark at all like the name claims. It does smell of complex malt. But then when you drink it although you do get malt it's not nearly as malty as I'd expected, certainly not ""double dark malt"". It's still enjoyable though, and a decent value in beer."
""
"Pours a clear dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that fades to nothing. Small streaks of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and some dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that has a pretty good smell but the taste doesn't match up."
""
"This beer seems to be a better version of similar beers like Amber Bock or Shiner Bock."
"Overall: A good representation of the style. This may not turn any heads, but is totally worth it at only $2.99 for a bottle. This beer seems to be a bit more of a doppelbock to me, but it stands up just fine as a bock."
""
""
"Yup, it's a doppelbock. All the bock yeast flavors and sweet, musty malts that should be there are present. Nice medium body for an easy-drinking quality in spite of its 8% ABV. All in all, not bad, but nothing to write home about. Worth buying for the beugel bottle if you'd like to have a 500ml of those around for your own bottling operations."
""
"A so-so beer. A little off the beaten path, style wise. I was hoping would be better, but I did buy it at Trader Joe’s, after all, and it was rather cheap. For some reason I had hoped it was a Belgian dubbel, but Bocks are good, too."
"O: OK, so it's not often that I give a beer all the same number ranking across the board, but this one fit the bill: Good, but not exceptional, in every category. Tasty, although not especially complex. I'd drink it again, although there are others I like better for the same price."
"O=Not a bock nor a brown ale...more like a sour ale, I think. I think this would go well with barbecued chicken or other hearty foods. May repurchase again."
""
"Drinkability was solidly good. Overall, a decent value brew. Worth trying if you see it. Plus, you get a sweet mini-growler out of of the deal."
"The first thing that comes to mind is a double Munich Dunkel. Smooth and sweet, with some dry grains to make it a bock. Still light bodied, but full flavors of boozy raisins. Finishes very bready reminiscent of rye bread."
""
""
"Poured into a stemmed beer glass. Light caramel colored body. Decent looking head. Smell was nutty and fruity. Taste was mostly average. It was very one-note; all it featured was malt. No layers of flavor at all. Plus, the mouthfeel was very sticky sweet and a bit hot from the abv. Not extremely enjoyable to drink. But I guess you get what you pay for, as this was a fairly cheaply priced beer. Not a horrible beer to gamble on for $3.99. Cool bottle at least."
"The color when poured in pint glass was medium dark brown with a minimum amount of foam and no lace. The smell of roasted malts was very evident, along with a hint of chocolate. The taste was of the roasted malts (bitter/sweet) and a touch of chocolate and caramel. Nice long flavorful bitter/sweet aftertaste. Just remember the is a malt ale and that is exactly what it is!!!"

"Overall, this is one that deserves taking a pass. I won't be revisiting."
"F"
""
"Overall, not a great beer. Flavors are muddled and just not all that good. I had high hopes, but was disappointed. Oh, well."
"Overall I'd rate this beer as ""OK""-- there are many just ""OK"" beers out there. I think this is a fine beer to introduce a newbie to craft beers-- someone who's been weaned on American adjuncts-- maybe for guys-- your GF??? But as a bock it's lacking in body, strength and presence. This beer is not going to replace one's daily bread."
"500ml bottle from Trader Joe’s: this one pours a slightly cloudy amber color. There was a wisp of a white head that didn’t leave any lacing. Aroma is mainly caramel malt, a little grassiness, and something else I can’t quite put my finger on. Taste is OK, but not great. Caramel, a little alcohol, touch astringent. Not much sweetness. Just rates an OK, don’t know if I’ll be back for another one."
"Overall: Not an enjoyable beer but hard to pinpoint the specific flavor element that made the beer taste odd. I guess honey-caramel-grassiness is as close as I can come."
""
"O- Meh, it's drinkable at least, but without the novelty of something cheap like Simpler Times."
"Overall: I didn't dig the Apecchio and I'm not digging the DDMA."
""
"I bought this at Trader Joe's and while they sell some decent beers this is definitely not one of them. What a shame."
"O: Judging it against other Bocks, I'm afraid that it doesn't measure up. The sweet caramel flavors were OK, but I kept getting the sense of stale beer like in a frat house basement."
"Deep brown with an orange hue. Fluffy, two finger pale yellow head with nice retention. Smoky rye and wheat bread and molasses in the aroma. Rye bread, dark malts and bourbon on the first sip. Big bready, malty mouthfeel, not much else penetrates. Big oat flavors with smooth molasses and fresh malts. Really enjoyable bock, very simple."
"The palate is quite pleasing with some more of that unexpected clovey spice, and a good balance of malt and soft bitterness. I am not sure how classic a bock this is, but I like it."
""
"It's a kind of cheap and rustic brew, but then it's three dollars instead of ten, so it gives a lot of beery intrigue for the buck. Not to mention the alcohol factor. Bound to impress the ladies with the sophisticated swing top, and that little gasp as they gulp down a good dose of inhibition-releasing and, oh never mind. Visit your local Trader Joe's."

"500 ml bottle from Trader Joe’s. Pours red with a short lived white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of caramel malt, grassy hops and some funk. Malt, hops and booze unpleasantly combine on the palate. It was a drain pour beer for me. What a waste of money."
"The taste is drier than the smell. The caramel is present in the swallow. Light hop, which I think adds to the flavor. Short aftertaste. Appropriately full bodied with an above average level of carbonation."
""
"A curious and not very pleasant offering. Though it is inexpensive, I wouldn't call it worth the price unless you're collecting it for the bottle."
"O - Wouldn't buy again, not terrible but not a well executed beer."
"Overall this beer was decent but left me wanting more from it. I will try this brewer's other beers before I get this one again. If anything the bottle is cool and easily reusable for home-brew."
"Final thought - $3 and 8% abv, so, my question, why not?"
"In general, I had high hopes for these beers, given the provenance and the attractive packaging. I guess I shouldn't judge the beer by the bottling..."
""
"Initially it looked that this was going to be good, but the aftertaste killed the mood. Not a particularly fun one."
"500ml swing top bottle ( very attractive package) from TJs Salem Oregon, $3.49 Amber/orange ale with a big ole thick bubbly off white head Subdued aromas..mainlly creamy cereal,roasted peanut..not that bad really Taste is again of course malty..bready,hay..slightly toasted..some semi-dark coffee bittering at the very end. I actually liked the mouthfeel..its rich enough yet still easy..only a touch of the alcohol. I actually did like this beer but its no doppelbock..a nice strong bock/ale hybrid"
""
"I didn't remember Trader Joe's beers being such duds. (With the exception of the annual holiday ale, of course). Though cheap, there's just not much too this: mediocre taste at best... for the quantity/alcohol/price it is not horrible, but picking up something of the same style, yet better, for the same price is an easy task."
"O: This is my first go at this style since I started reviewing. While I lean more to West Coast DIPAs and Belgian styles, this is something that will be in my fridge again when the malt mood strikes. Enjoyable experiment - TY to the Trader Joe's guy that recommended trying it!"
"OK, so the beer is 60% ""Birra al doppio malto"" and 40% Red ale, presumably the same red ale that's used in the other Nero beer that just hit Trader Joes. Still not exactly sure what to classify it as."
