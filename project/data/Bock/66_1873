Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, and some slight soy sauce notes. Taste is of toasted malt and some burnt caramel and toffee flavors. There is a slight alcohol kick with each sip. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Initially this brew comes across as a tad unruly with alcohol the dominant presence, both in aroma and taste. By the second, third and forth gulp the hops begin to assert themselves and take center stage. The amber/orange color stands alone in the beer world. I had to keep looking at it and holding it to different lights and upgrading my initial appearance rating. The taste is extremely complex, that too required a raise in points. The ample malt body never achieves a platform of its own. It instead plays a wonderful supporting role to the competing stars. The off white heads performance is marvelous, though brief. Einbecker, by the way, is the inventor of the bock style. Because I was unsure of my ability to accurately rate this unusual style beer with one bottle, I found it necessary drink a second.","BeerResearcher","Sep 05, 2011"
4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"330 ml. bottle. Beatiful amber reddish colour, no dark at all, light head that fades quickly, no lace. Smell: Am I the one who fin the typical Burton Ale sulphur here? That alongside chocolate, dark fruit and molasses. Medium body, really good palate, taste of caramel, chocolate, roasted, fruits, prunes... Really good one.","janubio","Beers"

3.57,-3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Had this on tap at the Bavarian Lodge. The menu states that Einbecker originated the Bock style but I think others have done this better (anyone remember Leinie's Bock from the 80s?) The beer seemed bright for the style and had some harshness - there was little of the caramel overtone that you have in most Bocks. This beer scored better than average only because I like Bocks...","MarvinTheMarzen","May 12, 2011"

3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Einbecker Ur-Bock Dunkel is stereotypically German in that it's been meticulously brewed according to a conventional, long-established recipe and accustomed level of quality and is efficiently engineered for a culturally prescribed and expected degree of easy drinkability.

Fairly complex flavor though, with a good mix of fruit, perhaps apple and plum, decent caramel, and a touch of spice. Somewhat chewy in the mouth, though not necessarily full bodied, and slightly bitter and wet on the finish.

3.23,-12.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"It is balanced to my surprise. Still, the hops sting the palate with its bitterness (could the green bottle have influenced this?).

A lighter bock, almost medium-bodied, with a dry, roasted malt taste with some biscuitiness as well as some sharp hops for minor balance. Semi-sweet caramel and sugar malts come out on backend for a sticky sensation and a somewhat sweet finish. A decent bock but I prefer them stronger.","clayrock81","0"

Aroma is so light...corn (!) comes through with whispers of carmel. Nothing outstanding in that regard. The head is typically thin and lace hugs the glass but survives but for a brief few moments before disappearing into the glass. The taste is another story. Raisens, dried apricots, prevail. A hearty mouthfeel that screams dunkel. A highly drinkable beer, which, if partying is your state of mind, will be most enjoyable given its 6.5% abv. Enjoy.","jim102864","Nov 07, 2006"

Smells are predominantly sweet consisting of caramel, molasses, grapes and other dark fruits, along with a hint of alcohol. More flavor than expected.

The aroma has a hints of bready, biscuity malt with a little toastiness to boot, and also a touch of skunkiness - generally, if I get a bad bottle I assume its a fluke but I don't consider skunkiness to be a fluke if the brew is in green bottle, which this one is. (a pet peeve). The flavor is possibly the saving grace, with an initial caramel sweetness followed by a robust, hearty cereal and grainy maltiness that dissolves into a little hoppy flavor and a full, balancing hoppy bitterness. However, the beer feels a little less full-bodied than I'd expect for the style.

A sipAhh caramel up front, and finally the hops assert themselves mid drink, and the finish is a nice roasted malt flavor. A good execution of the bock style. It has a medium mouth feel and is very drinkable. Many bocks can overload the alcohol, and make them to much to drink as a session beer.

3.87,4.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,3,"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a light effervescence all over the tongue. A decently drinkable beer, it would be so much more so if the alcohol presence (only 6.5%) were more subdued. As it warmed it became somewhat more prevalent.","PorterLambic","Jul 02, 2004"

4.05,9.5,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The beer after its departure from the green 11.2 ounce bottle sets in my Einbecker Bock glass a burnished copper color with a large tan head, which is semi-creamy in texture, the lace forms a thick curtain to drape the glass. Nose is sweet malt, caramel, and fresh, crisp, clean, you get the picture and or scent dont you? Start is quite sweet, nice malt profile, top is moderate in feel with the finish benign in its acidity, the hops a plentiful and spicy, quite dry and lingering aftertaste, a drinkable brew tis true.","Gusler","May 12, 2004"
2.24,-39.5,4,2.5,2,2,2,"Strongly bitter at first with hops dominating the flavor. Malts sneak into the picture midsip only to be replaced again by a bitter finish that is unappealing.","cbl2","Apr 19, 2004"
3.5,-5.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a nice, well-made bock beer. The green bottles thankfully had no bearing on the aroma or flavor of the brew. I would say that there are similarities to a doppelbock, this brew is lighter in body and flavor. It isn't exceptional, but this one ranks as ""pretty good"" in my book.","Beastdog75","Mar 25, 2004"
3.18,-14.1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"I saw this one in the liquor store and figured I'd give it a try. I kind of thought it would be a lot better than it was although I will say this, its a pretty interesting beer. I expected this to be darker than it was. It poured a dark reddish, almost brown color. The smell was very coffee-ish. I thought that the taste was a bit of a combination of chocolate and coffee but there was something else in there that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The mouthfeel was quite nice, it was smooth and creamy. This beer is good but not as good as I had anticipated. It came in 6 pack with small roundish bottles with goldish paper and I really thought this one would be world class. Worth a try though if you find it.","wsouloa","Feb 22, 2004"
3.51,-5.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,4," I have mixed feelings about this one. It's unlike any bock I've ever had, and the Euroskunk element that is here and there, is not something I care for. I suppose, overall, it has substantial complexities that make it worth trying again. I would have preferred a more substantial malt character that would have more successfully dominated the Euroskunk hops.","merlin48","Feb 06, 2004"
3.68,-0.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"The flavor profile leads with caramel malt sweetness and ends with a dry hop finish. Hops are prominent in the profile at all points. The beer carries its alcohol very well. A very nice big meal beer, and a great winter warmer session beer. Dont be turned off by the sulfur nose. Let it off-gas for a minute or two, and forgive it.","sparkydoyle","Jan 31, 2004"
3.43,-7.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Clear in body, color is a light amber with a slight copperish tone, a quick puffy off-white head appears swiftly and crumbles away nearly just as fast leaving a thin collar always present and very minimal spots of lace. Aroma is slightly sweet of malts with a burnt-like toffee, notes of wet old grass; crisp and light on the nose overall. Taste is has a quick little start thats thinnishly silky where then, just past midway some slightly twinged grassy and earth toned hops and burntish malts begin to mingle for a bit then the hops fade off leaving some burntish toffee across the palate as it finishes with a soft dryness and subdued crispness. Feel has a bit of texture in the carbonation leaving behind some twingy burnt malt burps with a passable medium fullness throughout. Its a bit slow moving at first but kinda grows on ya as you go. This seems to be something that would go well around a bonfire to me, why, I couldn't say, it just does. Something simple, yet with a bit of interest and a nice warming of 6.5% would make it a good fire side drink.","tavernjef","Dec 22, 2003"
3.58,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Mouthfeel is nice and alive and alcohol back end is warming and pleasing. Earthy and grassy notes make drinakability a little lower but overall not a bad beer.","CRJMellor","Dec 22, 2003"
2.69,-27.3,3.5,2,3,3,2.5,"Clear amber hue, coppery highlights, it is a very lovely color, the off-white head reached a half finger in size, and it quickly faded to a soapy residue. No lace was produced. The nose is unimpressive, sweet maltiness, strong influences of grassiness, sulfur, oddly Euro-lager in nature. Frankly, the bouquet repulses me. The palate is malty sweet, hints of caramel, grassy in the middle, which I didnt care for, the finish is pleasantly hoppy-bitter, a saving grace IMO. Im not trilled by the huskiness or the slight nuttiness in the taste. The aftertaste is long with tacky sweetness and faint hops bitterness. I dont know what to make of this beer, it is dissimilar to any Bock Ive had. The alcohol is not noticeable on the palate, a nice accomplishment, but it does warm the belly. Medium in body, a touch light, the carbonation is very modest and the mouthfeel is slightly slick. More malt would work nicely, oh well. I paid $3.00 for a 11.2 ounce green bottle in Omaha, honestly this would not be worth drinking if it was free. The nose ruins any favorable impression of this beer; I do like the hoppiness of the palate but little else. Not my cup of Bock, maybe it will work for you but I cant recommend it.","bditty187","Nov 26, 2003"
3.73,0.8,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Poured in a nice Einbecker Dunkel glass .. dark coffee bean color with a good head. Lacing present throughout the glass. Not much nose to speak of, but the falvors were deep, dark and full bodied. Sweet rich icey cool malt flavors with little hop flavors. Mild hop flavors on the back end, but clearly malts rule this beer. There was good body to this beer as it crossed the tounge and coated my mouth with flavors of plums, figs and tobacco. The nose opened up a little as the galss warmed, but always it was the rich sweet malts that dominated. A nice representation of the bock style.","counselor","Nov 22, 2003"

There's not much going on with the flavors. A very mild sweet alcoholic maltiness is followed up by a bitter metalic aftertaste. The flavor is not as sweet as the aroma suggests, but then again there really isn't that much to the flavor.","HappyHourHero","Aug 07, 2003"
4.25,14.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This ur-bock poured a clear, coppery red color with good white foam that settled. The smell was a sweet, floral and vinous aroma with a touch of biscuit. Interesting. The taste was mildly sweet and floral, almost flowery. There was a vinous flavor (dark grape skins), as well as malt, oak, and a hint of caramel. The hops came out in the finish. There was a slightly detectable alcohol taste. The mouthfeel was smooth and fruity with medium body and carbonation. It was somewhat warming with a dry finish. This was a nice and very interesting beer, unlike any other bock I have every tasted.","UncleJimbo","Jul 20, 2003"

3.48,-5.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This brew pours a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles that lasted a fair amout of time and a semi-opaque brown body. It has a nice mild malty aroma.

3.62,-2.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This brew pours the color of a tarnished penny with a slight layer of film-like head. Very muddy, thick, wet malt aroma with subtle hints of chocolate -- non-descript as far as many beers are concerned but fairly potent, I think, as a lot of bocks go. Medium-bodied and offers the mouth a slight tingly feeling. Light acidic -- like the lemon filling in a pastry -- pushes into a malty flavor dominated by a sloppy, wet mouthfeel -- pumpernickel and light caramel notes. Pretty drinkable for a beefy brew.","marburg","Beers"
3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Solid dunkel bock with a mahogany color and roasted qualities..

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"11.2 oz bottle. Slight skunkiness upon opening, but quickly disappeared. Pours a deep copper, with not much head. Thin lacing on the glass. Heavy malt aroma.

3.83,3.5,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"pours out a deep copper colour with a foamy head the dies down to a sticky thin layer of lace. a rather nondescript aroma of sweet malts. a pretty sweet and stiff malt profile doesn't give up a lot in the flavour department...typical bock hardiness with soft german malt and hop notes. as it warms a bit the malt profile comes through a bit with dunkel notes of toastiness...hints of cocoa and caramel complimented by ghostly dark fruits. definite hoppiness for a bock...and an alcohol kick to round things out. at first i thought this a rather boring brew...but as it warmed the complexity shines through. it finishes rather dry...maybe showing it's age. a nice smooth mouthfeel lets all this german goodness go down quite easily. this bottle was a little old, explaining the relaxed flavour profile, dryness and smoothness and drinkability. a rather nice german bock.","budgood1","Nov 21, 2002"

Flavor was very much on the sweet side with carmel being the dominant flavor... almost cloying... with only slightly herbal notes offer a little balance. Syrupy and thick, with medium carbonation. The sweetness and thickness lower the drinkability.","zerk","Aug 04, 2002"

4.3,16.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours with a beautiful just off-white rocky head, topping light brown/amber liquid. Nose is of sweet malt, natch. Very appetizing too I might add. Taste is superb, lightly sweet malt followed by an almost dominating hop bitterness. Hops win out in the finish, with the maltiness of the grain creating an interesting interplay on the palate. This is one of the classics here, boys! The not-so-heaviness makes this beer very easy to drink plenty of. The original Bockbier, try it if you see it. Well worth the $8 I paid for a sixer. Tastes all the much better out of the ""official"" Einbecker Ur-Bock glass, to boot!","beerluvr","0"
