"Definitely a malt lovers brew, that I am having no trouble drinking easily. Not a complex or crazy beer, but enjoyable for what it is and little o the sweet side without being cloying. I enjoy this one."

"Trying this one out of the Winter Sampler 2012. First of all the bottle art is a ten, it made me laugh really hard for no reason. The color is a red-ish/brown. Smelling it from the bottle and then from a glass, it smells a tad bit sweet. Unfortunately that's where the fun ends. The taste at first was a little weak and a little watery. The aftertaste was decent but nothing special. Good warm mouthfeel. Not sure if I'd buy this again outside of the sampler."

"Overall an average beer that works well in the winter season. Wouldnt seek it out on its own but has its place in the winter mix pack."

"Overall pretty on par for the style but didn't really wow me. Pretty good for Saranac though."

"Saranac's best beer. Was brewed for limited time last winter to go with ski season but now since it was in such high demand it is an all year round brew from what I am told. Dark heavy beer but with great flavor and good drinkability. Even the label on the bottle is fun to look at, depicting a bear with skis, Saranac trys to encorperate bears into all thier labels it seems. Def. give this one a try, you will be happy you did."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard shaker ""pint"" glass. The lager appears a medium chestnut color with about an inch of fizzy ecru foam. Aroma and taste is dominated by fair amount of malt, caramel, bitter, earthy hops, a bit sweet. Nice satisfying body with ample carbonation. A nice malty bock at a good price."
"Drinkability: Stylistically, this is definitely a bock, and even a pretty good one at that - can't say it's the best one I've ever had though. The notes are mostly here, it's just a little dull, shallow, watery - cheap? No, that's harsh. It's good for what it is, but it's not one I'd reach for again."
"M + D: A little bit of a stickiness in the body, an assertive - but not overdone - carbonation. In the past, I've always detected an unusual 'metallic' type taste that I had just associated with being a Saranac thing. It wasn't really my thing, but this particular beer doesn't appear to have that quality. Quite a nice brew which has me interested in revisiting other beers from the brewery!"
"D - This is a very drinkable beer, and I guess I was always figuring this to be a heavier stout from the black diamond name. Never looking closely to see that it was actually a bock and not a stout. This could be a session beer, it is not heavy, and has a good flavor."
"(rated May 15, 2007)"
"I also find it humorous that they label it a 'dark lager' on the bottle. It's true, but it seems like they're trying to get macro lager drinkers to not be scared of it."
"Drinkability: This is really a great bock, and much better then I expected. It's is obvious that this beer was made to drink in the winter, but it's good enough to enjoy year round. I will definately be getting some more of this, and you should do the same."
"Drinkability: For a bock, this is very drinkable. This one goes great on a cold day, and for a 6.00 ABV, it's pretty easy to slug down. A good job to Saranac on this one, I'll defintley pick these up this winter."
"I would drink a few of these, and I reckon these are best right out of the tap."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is semi sweet caramel with some late hop bitterness. $1.33 for a 12oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"From New York State comes this hearty bock. More carbonated than some beers, it produced a good, creamy head (hee hee) when poured which it retained well. Fermented with a lager yeast yet the aroma is distinctly bock (sort of bread-like) and you can taste the malted character up front followed by a slightly sweet finish. A little bitter, probably imparted by the higher ALC content (6%). Dark copper color, medium bodied. Not as dark as most winter beers but clearly intended to be drunk during those months."
"This beer is smooth despite the evident high carbonation. Maybe a little burn from the carbonation in the end. Good mouthfeel and biggish in body. I don't see what's not to like about this beer. I could easily drink another but I""m in no hurry to finish this one."
"Very good beer."
"I got this item at Wells, Baltimore for $3.99/6pack which is a pretty decent price for anything good these days. Pours brownish - deep gold with a very generous foamy head which may be an age related characteristic. There's a very pleasant malty aroma somewhat reminiscent of spent grain. This has a real bock taste, maybe toward a dopple in its profile but lighter and very drinkable. It seemed heavier and sweeter when drunk straight from the bottle. It's pretty well balanced right through the lingering finish and the head stuck around as well. Even though the malty flavor and slightly sweet tones eased up in time, they may put this beer out of the summer beer category. It would certainly be fine on a cool evening. For the price, an excellent beer. I'd have gotten more but it was only available refrigerated."
"drinkability- very. Another nice beer from F.X. Matt. True to style, this is one of the better bock beers that I can remember having. Good job and I recommend."
"D. A good offering from Saranac, one of my favorites so far."
"Body is quite nice, above medium, chewy, and creamy. One of the few Saranac brews to live up to it's style expectations."
"D - Solid offering... The Hop context to this Bock makes it a keeper... I could enjoy a couple and that's a good thing because I just bought a case on a whim..."
"I will be the first to admit that bocks are near the bottom of my 'most favored styles' list. That said, I think I'm able to give all beer a more than fair shake when it's time to review. Black Diamond Bock is one of this brewery's finest creations and should not be missed by fans of the style."
"Saranac Black & Tan is very good too. THANKS AND GREETINGS FROM B INGHAMTON, NY !!!"
"D: Honestly one of the better beers I have had from Saranac."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear amber/copper color with an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention is very good, lacing is OK. It smells like sweet malt, caramel and bread. The aroma is on the light side, but it's still nice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some hops in the finish. Taste is stronger than the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is medium, but with above average carbonation, too much for my liking. Drinkability is average, but the high carbonation doesn't work for me. Overall I think it's a decent beer, but it could be better."
"drinkability - Nice balance, would buy again, worth a try. Easy drinking."
"D- A well rounded beer with a flavor that I'm describing poorly, but still enjoying."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: In my opinion the carbonation in this beer is just a tad too high. Too much frittering about the tongue. I also expected this brew to have a much more dense body. Its finish is dry, leaving the mouth water for more. This is a beer that goes well with early spring. I don't know if I'd come back to it, I think that I am much more of a Doppelbock guy, but I'd like to give others a shot before I do or don't come back to this. Just pretty average, good, nothing great though. Worth a try in my opinion, but I'd not go seeking this out unless you are a huge Matt Brewing fan."
"Overall impression: A balanced, enjoyable, highly drinkable spring bock. Very solid and should be brewed all the time. Recommended."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is of medium weight on the palate, with a creamy disposition. Carbonation is relatively fine and light but works very well with the brew. This is a fairly easy drinking lager with an interesting twist as a bock."
"Very drinkable. Great beer."
"Right on target and very clean. I'm diggin this beer a lot, to hell with it being a winter seasonal ... brew it year round."
"A typical Saranac offering... very good, but a bit bland in comparison to the world class breweries."
"Initial pour was a pale copper color with about 3/4 inch head. The aroma was filled with caramel and moderate alcohol presence. Initial sip was surprising, moderate cramel maltiness with a strong alcohol presence but very smooth. The finish lingered with a nice hoppy flavor balanced by the sweet malt. The alcohol subsides as the beer warmed with a decent amount of lace left in my glass. All in all a decent example of this style and a worthy beer."
"D - Drinkability is good. I could easily have several more of these. I woud recommemd this to anyone looking for a decent bock."
"A decent bock beer, easy to drink and true to style. Another good value from Saranac."
"I wanted to like this one. Gorgeous brown color in the glass, nice head retention, bright hops and toasted malt in the nose. The initial taste left something to be desired, however. The alcohol taste was just a bit overpowering. The balance was OK, but rather than quietly warm you as you drink, it was a bit ""in your face"" all the way down. (I know, I'm a lightweight.) Don't get me wrong, for the style it was worth trying. But not quite as drinkable--enjoyable--as I had hoped when I picked it up."
"The 2008 version of Black Diamond Bock has come my way and it is as fresh as can be. A rich caramel malt palate is balanced by expert use of hops. Although I read of this being one dimensional , this is certainly not so with a fresh case. Like Huber bock, Black Diamond is a very good example of American single bock beer. Poured into a large pilsener glass, I can think of nothing to complain about."
"Poured 1 1/2 bottles into a .5 liter stein,a nice pour a clear rich copper/bronze with a tight formed one finger slight off white head that settled into a creamy froth.Sweet caramel and bready malt in the nose with a hint of iron,grainy medium to full mouthfeel it coats the mouth well.Bready and grainy husk-like flavors up front with a touch of caramel sweetness but its quite dry with not alot of uniquness to it kinda bland.This has some nice things about it,its appearance and mouthfeel are good but it lacks flavor in my mind."
"D- very drinkable i only had one that i picked up at Shawan on the singles rack otherwise i would have had another one."
"Overall, a good late winter offering from Saranac. They could have made it a bit more interesting, but it is a nice change of pace in a season filled with barleywines, imperial stouts, and other strong ales."
"i had this one leftover from the superbowl ; pours a clear, med. copper color w/ a thin off-white head which dissipates quickly leaving a good bit of lacing in my pint ; not a powerful smell, some grainy malts, and a bit of alcohol, maybe a hint of raisin ; bold and dry, more malty flavor, a deep roasted nutty/caramel up front w/ some lingering floral hop notes, a bit more of the dark fruit present as well ; a rich med. body w/ decent co2, leaves a good residual ; a very drinkable brew, esp. for a 6% ABV, def. light for a bock tho...."
"Pours a very light coppery color. Slight head. Caramel and toffiesh aroma. Mild malt flavor-a lot of caramel flavor. Slightly sharp hop bitterness. Somewhat thin bodywise. An ok beer and enjoyable enough. Doesn't take a lot of chances. In line with Saranac's other offerings."
"Pours a rich amber color. 2 fingers head with mild lacing. Aromas of orange peel and cherries. Very malty with a slight hint of alcohol aftertaste. Great beer for the cold winter months. Good overall, I would recommend to people that like other bocks."
"I would have no problem putting down a six of these over the course of an evening. A good beer overall, but nothing outstanding about it, however I seem to enjoy it more and more as I slowly work through the sixer (one every couple days)."
"Good, interesting overall. Nice to see an American made standard Bock, and would love to see more."
"D - Much better than I expected; this was also the first time I had a Saranac on tap and not from the bottle."
"Saranac seems to be on the right track with this one. Now i wish they would just redo their regular pale ale."
"D: Overall flavor is decent and non offending and light enough to make for a decent session bock. Not a fan but this is one of their better attempts."
"Presumably named after a typical ski-course, this Winter selection from Saranac is an overall pleasing sample that didn't disappoint... considered a Bock, this pours a dark amber, copper color with minimal head that soon dissipates... smell is very malty, and the taste is complete with strong, rich, caramel and brown sugar flavors with a maple syrup essence... good stuff overall, and much better than I had anticipated... Copped a single 12oz bottle from Gary's in Madison for $1.25... picture of a bear with ski goggles on the logo behind a winter scene...not a bad beer at all... good representation of the style with a thick and rich malt flavor that hits home... certainly a good Winter-style brew with enough flavor and character to warrant a sample... good beer... Recommended..."
"- Drinkable? - heck yeah!, it's very reasonably priced, it's 6% abv, and it's brewed in America by a non-macro brewery."
"Pretty darn good. A little sweet and full, but that's just being nitpicky. I like the warmth frm the alcohol, that's something you don't expect from such a light-looking beer. I've got to ding it a little for actually being a little too low in ABV for BJCP standards, though. But definitely worth buying a whole sixer of."
"Has a lagery wateryness to the feel. It thickens as it warms, but still watery, though smooth. It's a decent, smooth drinking beer with a hint of roasted nutty malt. Not bad at all."
"Overall?... The best thing about this beer is its appearance. It kinda reminds me of a less interesting Saranac Black Forest. I wish it wasn't so one dimensional... but it's still a good brew."
" Overall this was more then pleasant, and was actually a pleasurable brew to enjoy. A good overall session or dinner brew, I had no issues with it at all. Now it was not anything fancy or abnormally special in any way, just a good solid offering. I would definitely not turn it down if it was offered my way again, unfortunately they really do not ever make it down here. But never the less, glad I could try it and look forward to some more seasonals from Saranac."
"Overall a nice and easy drinking bock. Like nearly all Saranac beers, toward the shallow end of the style, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Notes: Apparently this isn't moving all that well. I think I paid $3.49 for a 6-pack of it at Olivers. Well worth it at that price, and frankly, I think this may be one of my higher-rated Saranac beers. Solid."
"Pours a dark caramel amber color with w shallow light tan head that fades fairly quickly. A nice amount of lacing generated. The smell is on the timid side, but a good roasted malt. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated and there is a slight tingle from hops. The flavor is similar to the aroma; mildly roasted. A smooth bock thats a nice drinker."
""
"This offering from Saranac pours out of the bottle a caramel brown leaving a thick tan head that stays with this brew. The aroma is brown sugar, slight sour twinge, herbal grassy notes, very faint nose. The taste starts sour/tart upfront followed by a small caramel maltiness but dominated by a sour feel on the palate. The finish is weak and watery overall subpar beer nothing I will return to again."
"The beer poured a dark, clear, amber color in the pint glass with about one half inch of head, which quickly disappered. It smells of sweet malt and fruit-maybe apple or raison. Also a note of alcohol. Tastes sweet and malty, not much hop taste that I could detect, some alcohol present. Mouthfeel is medium and is fairly well carbonated. This is a tasty beer and easy to drink. I like this more than other Saranac brews I have tried. I would definately buy more, especially since I found this on sale for $14.99 for a case."
"Drinkability: The carbonation lessened the drinkability for me."
"Appears with a copper amber body and forms a large tan head leaves behind fine lace around my pint in evenly strung patterns. Aromatics have mild herbal nobleesque hops roasty caramel nut edge and sweetness nothing off here just a bit subdued overall. Flavor is upfront with malt sweetness roasted character just liquid bread right?...touch of bitterness from the herbal hop profile but they really don't stand out overall I felt the flavors were just muted and I like more expressive beer than this one has to offer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied a touch of syrup stickiness with even carbonation, no complaints in this department. Drinkability is decent I just come across other beers I'd rather invest my time in this one was just ummm okay for me."
"A nice dark amber to copper color. Not much aroma, but a bit of bread on deep inhalation. Taste is very much on style with bread and sweetish malt which persists through the finish. No real hop taste. The mouthfeel is quite nice and full, as well as smooth, given very low carbonation. You don't feel the 6% ABV, until it's too late. All in all, one of the best beers from Saranac, and at a price point which you cannot beat. Any ""malt heads"" need to sample this one. Cheers!"
"Drinkability- For its style, I would say this beer is fairly drinkable. It's not very high in ABV and tastes pretty delicious."
"Not a bad bock."
"At 6.99 a six-pack, this is the best beer going right now."
"This beer is a darker amber color, but not as dark as I expected. There was just a bit of head on the top that quickly disappeared. There is a sweet malty aroma that comes off of it, but it isn't that strong. It has a slightly sweet caramel flavor initially, but disappears quickly. There is only a hint of hop bitterness and a flavor that I can't place, but reminds me of a steam beer. It is light to medium bodied and has decent drinkability."
"(bottle- 12 oz. in crystal mug) Toasty amber, medium bitterness, medium body, slightly bitter. A pleasant beer for March and those in-between winter-spring moments... almost drinkable in larger quantities...should be included in their winter sampler next year...points for the goggled bear logo? This first review goes out to the Ryanza in State College...ratebeer and BeerAdvocate brotherhood unite!"
"M&D - damn fine brew, tasty and rich, goes down easy and smooth, one of saranacs better offerings, not complex or layered, just nice flavor and easily drinkable, well done"
"Although not as malty as one might hope, Saranac's Black Diamond Bock does deliver some tasty and toasted malt. It pours a clear deep-copper body with glowing amber highlights beneath a creamy head of off-white that holds well and leaves thin sheets of spotty lace about the glass. The malty nose offers a welcoming caramelized-sugar note along with a decent amount of toastiness, backed by some very mild hops in the background. Across the tongue it's silky with a medium-light body and very-fine bubbled, moderate carbonation. The flavor is less sweet than the nose suggests, although the almost-scorched sugar/dark caramel side is still there. The full bitterness tends to tone it down. It becomes toasty, and somewhat dry across the middle, as some of the sugary malt fades and the bitterness rises. Some floral and leafy hops flitter here and there throughout, although they make their greatest impression in the dry finish. Unfortunately, some alcohol sneeks in there as well, which is odd because it's only 6% abv. Still, it's pretty well contained, and you don't really notice it until about halfway through the glass. Overall, enjoyable and drinkable."
"Brew pored to a rusty clear brown color with a nice sized off white to tan head that had very good retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aromas seem to highlight a good deal of roasted and caramel malts that stick out nicely that give it a nice roasted and nut like smell. It is nice with its malts up front giving more of a caramel taste along with a nut like flavor. Also possibly I am picking up a fruit like taste of raisins or plums? Has a crisp and dry feel to it. Over all I enjoyed this brew, actually would like to see this in it mix packs as I feel it is a better offering than a number of them. Nice solid run of the mill brew from Saranac based on it style."
"Good drinkability could drink a few, would get bored after a while with the taste a bit lacking. Not a bad beer,not one of the better ones from Saranac."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet, caramel scen that boasts of crystal malts along with a slightly roasted and nutty aroma. It's sweet with a dry lager yeast scent. The taste is decent. It's quite dry with a roasted feel . It goes down easy and finishes with some residual sweetness. It's not as malty as it smells. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a run of the mill bock beer. It looks and smells great, but the taste lacks a bit; still a good drinker."
"The color is the nice amberish/red/brown that you would expect to see with not much foam at all. The smell is sweet and definitely carries the scent of all the malt, which I personally love. Overall taste is pretty good. It starts off much the way it smells, lots of malt and toffee flavor along with some citrus and finishes a tad on the bitter side, though its still good. Mouthfeel isn't too bad, maybe a little too much carbonation or maybe I'm just a sissy. Drinkability is pretty high...in fact I'm gonna open another one."
"A good, malty brew that was vey good with beef stew. Pours a medium amber with a small head. Smell is extremely malty and inviting. Taste follows the smell..sweet at the start, strong malt backbone. Mouthfeel is very nice...creamy and smooth. Very easy on the drinkability scale. Could quaff more than one."
"Over all, pretty drinkable and nice in the winter months. worth the $20 that I paid for it, worth it if you find it"
"Nothing extra special about this beer but a decent offering nonetheless from Saranac. I had been getting away from the as of late but I am hoping that they give me reasons to spend a few bucks on them. I spent a bit back in college and around abouts and don't mind doing it as long as they step up a bit!"
"D: A bock. It's a nice mix of the best I've had and the most affordable bocks. A great Saranac beer. Cheers!"
"This bock pours a maroon tinged amber color with a residual cap of head and malt toned nose with hints of coffee. The taste does feature malt to spare and enough hop balance to avoid being one dimensional but the texture robs the flavor of any originality or true character due to its thin, watery finish and general lack of backbone. It kind of just devolves in your mouth, leaving some nasty bitterness and not much else. Maybe it's the water, but Saranac never could deliver the mouthfeel its ambitions demanded. Oh well, worth trying, anyway but probably not much more."
"Pours a nice Amber. Thin head. Not a lot of retention,but good lacing. Smell is of carmel malts. Good,but on the weak side. Body is thin, with some carbionation. Taste is on the light side,but good. Carmel, with a hint of sweet fruit,and a bit of a hop kick. May not be all that true to the triditional style,but worth a try."
"Pours a deep red amber color with a white headskie. Bockish in flavor and body, but not quite bockin' it up all the way. The sweet bockness is a touch thin and as such is almost swallowed up by the hop balance. That said, it's still a tastey drinkable brew, just a bit off style. Was that ever a bad thing? I hope not."
"This is very pleasant beer even though it is slightly off the style by the hop. This is an easily quaffable beer--think rich pale ale. Enjoy."
"Pours a crystal clear pale copper-amber hue. Off-white soap bubble head reaches two fingers, then sinks to a sturdy cap and leaves minimal lacing. Weak nose;crystal malt and mabye some noble hops. Caramel and pale munich malt upfront, then a spicy tettnanger flavor. The bitterness is perhaps a little strong for the style, but this is more apparent because the malt character is a little thin. Semi-dry aftertaste, faint caramel notes linger somewhat. The body is light-medium, and the carbonation is medium, again a little meek for the style. Finishes with residual caramel, some tettnanger flavor, and slightly astringent tannins. It's not the best Bock on the shelf, but at least it's has a decent drinkability."
"Drinkability: a decent session beer from the Saranac folks. A bit thin for a bock, but flavorful."
"Got this one out of a bartender's choice bucket at Hi5 in Raleigh, a pleasant surprise as I almost bought a single bottle earlier today at Whole Foods. Poured a deep amber color with minimal head that was quickly diminishing. Not to much to the aroma, normal malt aroma I expect from a bock. Taste wasn't the best bock I've ever had, but still good. Not too much carbonation in this one. Drinkable, but I don't buy bocks that often, not sure why, cause I do really enjoy them."
"drinkability: somewhat limited, and not interesting enough to keep me sipping...some more malt and/or complexity would fix that."
"12oz brown botle with no freshness date. Pours a clear medium amber with a 1 finger head and OK lace. Definate malt aroma mixed with caramel and an odd smell I cant quite put my finger on - almost like a mix of alcohol and cigarettes - like the breath of someone you meet in a bar. Upon tasting is initial malts, weak for a bock, mixed with a peppery, higher than the norm hop flavor with a lingerinh hop bitterness in the aftertaste. A bit weak for a bock Not a bad beer but not one of the better bocks I have had. IMHO skip this one."
"Not bad at all."
"12 ounce bottle."
