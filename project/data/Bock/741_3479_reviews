"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy amber with a short-lived off-white head and crazy carbonation. Aroma is of fermented apple juice and hint of peppery hops. Body is medium and tangy. Taste is caramel malt and peppery hops. Finish is long and spicy. There is something wrong with this bottle."

"O: A middle of the road bock with muted flavors that might be due to this being a little old. The balance between the bitterness and the malt sweetness is nice."

"I can't believe how many years they've been making this swill and, to give Lakefront the benefit of the doubt, they still can't get the quality control figured out. Label says bottled in JAN in WK3, but they don't say what year. Purchased at Total Wine, thanks, guys."

"Overall â€“ nothing super special about this beer, at least nothing new or thought-provoking (that I can tell), but it is a very good-tasting beer overall."

"This beer poured a reddish-brown, with no to very little head. I felt the taste, at the beginning, was crisp to slightly sweet. As the beer warmed slightly, crispness faded. The smell was honey-like. This beer had a full flavor, robust yet refreshing. Seemed lighter than other bocks I have had. I could not taste or feel the alcohol warmth, although the ABV is 6.7 percent. Overall, a beer that is on the upper end of good, and one that enjoyed and will try again."
"O: Nice beer, quite good for the style. Worth visiting again when I get a chance."
"Pours a murky brown with a 1/2 inch dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some brown sugar aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, brown sugar, and some slight caramel flavors on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing that really grabs my attention and would make me want another."
"O - For the malt-lovers out there, this bock is another easy drinking, very well made lager from Lakefront that features loads of toast and caramel sweet malts with just enough balance to keep it from being cloying. Smooth and drinkable, there's a faint warming sensation of alcohol for those cooler spring evenings."
"Mahogany color with a flash-in-the-pan head and no real lacing to speak of. Smells and tastes of a toffee malt with decent nuttiness and light presences of milk chocolate. Garnish levels of fruity yeast esters (stone fruit) exists in the background as well. Creamy, smooth medium-heavy body with gentle carbonation. It is difficult to find something to criticize but I do feel that it suffers somewhat from a lack of 'toasted' character. Other than that, it is a somewhat better than average Bock."

"Delicious bock! Golden to amber color. Good clarity. Medium head. Bready nose that is quite appetizing. Palate offers a pleasant malt sweetness, light toffee, smooth body, yet very drinkable. This is a winning combination. Balanced bock for the win. Like a light Salvator."

"O: Overall malty with a good show of hops and alcohol gives this a decent finish to an other wise stutter/mis-step at the start. You eventually warm up to this."
"Not a bad bock, but has enough flaws that this would only be an option if fairly hard up for a bock"
"I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more, it's just not a reference Bock-- but a drinker's Bock."
"Overall, very good brew and true to bock style."
"Overall, a decent Bock but not one of my favorites among the ones I've tried this season. However, I'm perfectly happy to drink up the rest of the 6-pack."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a clear reddish amber with a small off-white head that quickly fades into a thin film with no lacing. A malty aroma with a vanilla scent behind it. Very malty flavor with a slight caramel finish. Easy to drink, not a bad bock."
"(D)- A solid bock that tastes good and doesnt try to be overly or ridiculously sweet, which I appreciate. I could have a couple of these no problem."
"A very drinkable bock with a nice sweet malty profile that doesn't become sticky. Alcohol well covered - just the slightest hint of warmth as it progesses...Has a nice malty taste - a ""hearty lager"" as described on the label, and one well-done. A nice ""seasonal"" to transition from the winter to the spring!"
"I wish I had an interesting way to start this review. I don't so here we go. Poured into my glass the beer is a reddish amber color. Slightly cloudy. A thick inch of beige head sits atop my glass. The aroma is caramel malt. Some sweet fruit can be found if you really stick your snooter in there. The flavor is rich and malty. Sugar toast and a cracker like breadiness seems to greet my tastebuds. There's a bitter alcohol bite that hits you when you least expect it as well. Medium to full body that's rich and lightly carbonated. A nice bock overall."
"Very drinkable, not sure of the alcohol, but it's a smooth drinking beer with no overpowering flavors."
"I was fairly impressed by this brew, I need to pick up more of this one."
"The feel is smooth and buttery, like a milky consistency. More watery at the end. Overall t's a tad too sweet; very malty. Could use a slightly bitter balance, but very drinkable."
"Pours a fair amber with a finger of off white head. Aroma is full of sweet malt, light caramel, a little earthy. The flavor is full of nuttiness, slight toffee and earthy hops. Its a medium bodied beer with a pleasant carbonation. Overall I'm not too big a fan of the aroma on this beer but the body and flavors are nice."
"D -- This beer is definitely drinkable, but the characters are far from what I'd expect in any style of Bock."
"Not a great bock, but it's fairly tasty. It's lacking overall."
"Bottle dated second week of february aggressive pour into imperial pint glass a quarter head tight and nice lacing throughout. Reddish/Copper/Amber and clear carbs rise nicely in pillars. Smell mostly roasted malts with a touch citrus/fruit. Taste malty upfront a touch hop metal finish. Not very heavy rather light on the carbs. This beer really scratched my spring beer itch. Drinkable as always provincial I favor Lakefront a little - wish I had this sixer a couple weeks ago for the first round of the tourney."
"Dark amber with one finger of white head. Good amount of lacings. Aroma is some fruitiness. Taste is bready sweet malts with just enough hop bitterness to make it interesting. Easy to drink leaves you wanting another. Decent spring offering. Much better beer than the last beer I tried from this brewer. To be fair I think it was quite old. This bottle tasted quite fresh and clean."
"Very drinkable. The appearance, smell and taste are good but the mouthfeel really makes this a beer worth savoring."
"D- It isn't bad at all, just missing some ""wow"" factor."
"Taste starts out malty, very slick and buttery like most bocks, stronger than usual bitterness kick to the sides of the mouth, not at all unpleasant but unexpected, decent caramel aspect."
"D - Not bad, it just strikes me as a humdrum bock. I'm glad to drink it, but bock really isn't my style, and I'm sure my deviation from the mean reflects this."
"D - Not bad, but I don't think I'd have more than one in an evening. Not quite my flavor."
"Pours a clear ruby hued brown with a decent creme head that doesn't really stick around. Flavor starts off nice and robust and kicks to a pretty super sweet edge. It's nice, but if only it were a bit more rounded and not so tangy, it's be much better to me. Smooth feel though. Overall a bit too much tang to make it how I'd want it to be."
"This tastes very smooth. Its not overly carbonated and has a nice sweet taste that makes it flavorful enough that each concurrent sip is appealing. I admit, I am an ale fan first and a lager fan second, but dark lagers like this are a nice change up."
"drinkability is great. this is a very manageable bock, without high alcohol or malt levels. the subtle nutty and spiced notes give it a character that is unique to the style, but still remains a solid bock. cheers!"
"The happy little goat head on the label looks at me as if to say 'how could you not like my beer?' I do like it, it's just that I'm not exactly bowled over by what I'm tasting. Since I haven't been bowled over by too many bocks, perhaps you'd be better off seeking someone else's opinion."
" ~ This was the ""Mystery Beer"" in the 8 pack. I read through the reviews of other Lakefront brews to determine which beer it actually was. I did this once I had completed my review."
"D - Poor. I don't know what it is about this brew, but it just isn't what it could be. I'm starting to hate Lakefront. I keep giving them a chance, but they never deliver."
"Big malt in the mouth, sweet and caramel flavors and plenty of currant to back it up. A little slick, full in the mouth, medium-thin body. Alcohol is evident, but not a deterrent. The sweetness gets too much for me, but it's an easy-drinking bock."
"Drinkability: Good, but not great. I think one is enough."
"On the whole I was impressed by this bock. Not as deep and full as some others, but still a nice, easy drinking brew. A good spring sessionable beer."
"I know there's a difference between ""malt"" and ""a malt"" but this reminds me of a little of each. The creaminess is inherent but the caramel is teased in with minimal carbonation and makes a warm puddle of dark liquer in the stomach. It's what I expected of the Eastside (by the same brewer) and didn't receive. Or it could just be the electricity from tonight's thunderstorm ambience which is tricking my tastebuds but I don't think so."
"Not a bad bock from Lakefront. Pours out to a dark ruby red color with a short lived head of cream colored foam. Medium low carbonation, and a few rings of lace. Aroma is very malty and wreaks of roasted earth, with some sweet grain and wood elements. Solid. Taste is quaffable; toasted bread and malt smooth over to a raw grain note that presents a creamy element of sweetness. Mouthfeel is fair, mild and slightly smooth. Drinkability is average. I've had better in the style, but this isn't bad."
"This beer came in a variety eight pack in which all the beers were dated to the first week in March. So perhaps it is not retired afterall. It pours a black color that is clear around the edges of the glass and opaque in the middle. The head is one finger in height, creamy and recedes rather slowly into a thin cap that covers the entire glass. The aroma is very nice. Chocolate, burnt malt, very sweet overall. The taste of swweet burnt malt with a bit of chocolate and a nice lingeringly sweet finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice, relaxing brew."
"Drinkability is slightly above average maybe. Has some potential but either some age or a little bit of miss in brewing this batch makes the sourness a bit off-putting."
"Clear dark brown color, alost maroon. Not a lot of head, just a thin layer on top of the beer. Good amounts of visible carbonation. Smell is nice and malty, raisins and brown sugar. Taste is rich and full, very malty, but the body is too thin for the style. Alcohol traces and some hops on the finish. Not too bad, could use a little more body, though."
"This might be the darkest bock ive had in a while. I dont mind dark beer but I feel they over did it on this one. It might have been the store's fault but I bought this beer and it was already over a year old. Having said that, the beer tasted a little funny. The head was very small but really dark for its size. Almost no lace at all, not that I expected a lot from a bock. Over all just kind of a weird placed beer. It says its for spring but its not a seasonal. Taste more like an ale then anything. I ve tried four lakefront beers now and none of them have impressed me. On the other hand none have been really horrible. In the end I say for the money you could get a good local micro for the same price as a lakefront. Go with the local brew. If lakefront is your local brew... sorry."
"Clear and attractive dark coppery brown appearance, head is yellow ochre in color, flattish but adequate. Wide slipping loop laces. Nice aroma, malty with elements of sweetened cherry and maple syrup, almost like IHOP pancakes. Medium mouthfeel, lower carbonation, shows a thick backbone for an ordinary Bock. Full flavor, a berry sense fights through the brown sugar maltiness, gives a staunch and unchanging flavor profile. Slight burnt quality mid mouth. Finishes full. There seems to be a lot of unmemorable lighter beers in the Bock category, this one stands above them. I really like the aroma here, and stack this one on the list of Lakefront's notable brews."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a short-lived light tan head. Aroma consists of caramel malt, raisin and brown sugar. Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel. The taste exhibits most of the complex flavors you'd find in a decent bock beer. It starts off with a rich caramal malt flavor. Sweet molasses flavor coats the tongue midway and lingers into the long finish. It moves into some vinous tones and that sweet caramel flavor returns in the finish. Hops dry the tongue out toward the end. Lakefront's bock seems a little lighter on the raisin flavor typically found in most bocks. But there are strong vinous tones and you can taste the alcohol flavors appears slightly toward the back. Overall, this was an enjoyable bock and something I'll need to revisit next Spring."
"Pours out a deep reddish brown - more red than typical bronze coloration. There is a minimal tan head and no discrenible lace effect. The nose is somewhat sweet and toasted. The taste is a sweetish sour flavor that is disconcerting at first but becomes quite nice on the palate as the glass is emptied. The mouthfeel is full and a bit creamy. Good drinkability overall."
"Pours a dark ruby-brown with a small white-gray head. Smells of toffee and bready malt. Some toasted notes. Taste is rich, rummy sweetness. Malt all the way. Some hop presence comes in to balance ( a little bit). Finish is lightly bitter with lingering sweetness and cooked veggies. Nice creamy mouthfeel too. Another good WI bock."
"Thanks to the BadMonk for this one!"
"One of Lakefronts better beers...if you like sweet, sticky bocks this is your beer....I enjoyed it and would buy a sixer of this each year..."
"A joy to drink, with considerable flavor."
"Clear dark amber copper color with a thin, firm, dusted brown head. Soft, supple, clean, sweet bready malt nose with touches of brown sugar and molasses. Bold taste, firm grabbing sweet bready malt base thats lightly chewy with a light drying tang that keeps a nice sweet coating in the mouth. Bits of herbalness in a very light hopping sneak through nearer the finish. Close to full body, smooth and clean with a very present sweet tang coating the palate leaving some chewy, nearly cloying effects across the entire tongue. I usually don't enjoy the regular bocks due to having accustomedized my tastes towards the more hefty doppels. This brings to mind of something that Capital might put out, perhaps a cross between the Blonde, Autumnal Fire, and Dark could produce something similar to this; that said, this is a pretty straight up hefty bock that I can finally put some trust in for the style. A fine and tasty lager bock beer by Lakefront."
"Thinner in body & lighter than I would have hoped for, but still a decent bock."
"This was a wonderful,malty, nutty tasting bock beer from one of my favorite breweries. The taste of burnt sugar and nuts was prominent and the finish was smooth and delightful. This is a WONDERFUL brew! This is apparently seasonal, but I sure wish it was available all year round"
"Crystal clear scarlet red/ amber orange appearance. The body is capped by a nice looking light brown head...creamy in nature. The lace is pretty full. Nice bready malt aroma. A little cakey and yeasty. Small hints of molasses on the nose as well. Nicely carbonated and almost a full body. For a straight bock, this has some pretty nice depth to it. Cinamon bread comes to mind when tasting this. And brown sugar. And molasses. And munich malts. Definitely munich malts here. This is a very solid Bock that could go toe to toe with some of the average Double Bocks."
"High drinkability factor here, especially on tap."
"But overall, a very nice bock, brewed once a year.  A nice treat.  Pretty big to boot....I am guessing the ABV is up there for the style."
