In the aftertaste, one might note the flat mouthfeel with the dirty malt aftertaste. I really like the bock style, but this one literally has almost nothing positive.","JohnnyHopps","Apr 16, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, raisin, apple, molasses, toast, dark bread, light nuttiness, herbal, earth, and light spicy alcohol. Pretty nice and pleasant aromas with solid balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of caramel, raisin, apple, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, light nuttiness, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, molasses, toast, toffee, dark bread, light nuttiness, pepper, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Pretty nice flavor balance and robustness, with solid complexity; with slight cloying spiciness on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a pretty good doppelbock. Solid flavor balance and complexity; and quite smooth to sip on. A pleasantly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 06, 2013"
4.45,35.3,4,4,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Atwater is sometimes overlooked as a brewery, but their Winter Bock is an excellent beer. It pours dark with a very small head. There are hints of chocolate and a little bit of nuttiness in the taste & the smell. It's a malty brew without much in the way of hops. Its alcohol content is a little higher than one might expect at 7.5 ABV, but it doesn't have that hot, alcohol feel that might be expected. Overall, it's a really solid beer that I plan to have on hand as long as there's snow on the ground.","AndyMSU","Feb 02, 2013"

Mouthfeel is moderate, easy drinking and well carbonated. I wish more American craft brewers would brew bocks. This style is seriously under represented in the US. I feel that this is a great example of one too. Only comes out in the winter and since its so easy drinking and flavorful, I'll seek it out every year.","33nickadams","Dec 26, 2012"

Front end is pleasant with a banana bread thing happening, but it doesn't stick around long enough to get an counter the pungent nature of an earthy and slightly sour bitterness, which lingers on the tongue after this thin and slightly oily beverage.

Nutty highlights throughout, as well. The aftertaste is light, with some of the bitterness from the coffee flavors and the slight hops presence shining through a bit more.

Initial tartness is almost overpowering and masks the other initial flavors so much that it appears to be quite watery. Lets hope that it improves with more tastes.

3.55,7.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Dark amber with a nice light tan head, minimal lace. Smells pretty malty and sweet, bubbblegum and caramel. Tastes much like the smell, fairly light for a bock I think but pleasant and malty with some detectable cinnamon spice. Fairly thin mouthfeel and easy drinking for a beer that states ""high gravity lager"" on the label like a lot of cheap malt liquors do. I don't know the ABV but I think the alcohol is well hidden. Tasty, if not spectacular.","biggred1","Dec 14, 2008"
3.01,-8.5,4,3,3,2.5,3,"This is a nice looking beer. Dark amber with a thick 2 finger head that dissipates with lots of lacing. Not a strong smell, somewhat malty and clean. The taste started strong but then felt watered down. It did taste malty, not overly sweet at all. Clean, low carbonation, good drinkability. Just a little more mild in taste and smell than I would expect.","sophisticated","Nov 28, 2008"

3.88,17.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Atwater Winter Bock pitches two fingers of white froth atop an amber body, decently lacing the pint glass. Chocolate and caramel confront the nose, along with bready malt, but the nose is too subtle. The taste is fuller and bolder, with the chocolate and bready malt emerging more prominently. Smooth with modest hints of hop bitterness, Atwater Winter Bock is a solid if unspectacular version of Bock. Easy on the palate if lacking in complexity and boldness, a fine find at the sterling Sun Singer.","Gehrig","Feb 27, 2008"

3.75,14,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"M&D: Mouthfeel was decent but the finish was just a tad watery. Drinkability is better than average but I was expecting a little more malt for a bock. Overall it's an enjoyable brew - Recommended.","SIRIUS2","Dec 01, 2007"

3.7,12.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"The bottom line: Atwater delivers what they promise, this beer is definitely a winter style bock...thick, a bit boozy, and definitely a beer that tastes better when the snow is falling.","CortexBomb","0"
