4.41,28.2,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Genesee Bock brewed by Genesee Brewing Co. / Dundee Brewing Co. This brew has an ABV of 5.20% The bock pours out a nice light brown color , with a nice off white head. This brew smells, sweet, with grains and malts. You also pick up some hops at the end. The taste is bold with flavor. There is some sweetness .malts, and grains. Genesee Bock has a nice smoothness to it. There is a lot going on in this brew, but there is nothing overpower about it.  The mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is nothing bad about the mouthfeel of this brew. I like how smooth this brew goes down. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.50 out 5. Genesee Brewing Co. / Dundee Brewing Co. did a nice job with this one.  I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Feb 28, 2015"

3.8,10.5,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a wonderful copper brown. Has hues of amber and gold and has a creamy persistent head of off white foam.  Nose is malty.  Soft round bready malt with a touch of sweetness.  No hops scent except for the idea of grass.  There's corn on this nose as it's part of the malt character but it does not smell like corny sweetness. It has a light scent to the nose.  The taste is excellent.  Clean, a touch sweet with a bit of caramel.  Has no hop flavors.  Really excellent and no bitterness form hops either.  They are a part of the mouthfeel though as they dry on the palate lightly in the crisp finish.  The corn does lighten the flavor while it is not excessively sweet.  In the finish it's crisp, just dry and lingers softly and sweetly. Not cloying, nodiacetyl which is often just a slickness without a heavy buttery taste,  and has no alcohol on the palate.  The only criticism I have is that I think the corn keeps it from being as malty rich as it might have been without it .  But it is very well done and adds lightness to the flavor and drinkability.  The  mouthfeel is thinner side of medium.","utopiajane","Dec 19, 2014"

Poor head retention and lacing but I really wasnâ€™t expecting a whole to out of this beer. Aroma has burnt caramel, toffee, and some molasses. Perhaps a touch of corn as well. More caramel on the taste along with molasses and a quick whiff of alcohol. Light corn with a little grassy hop character. Slightly sticky with very little bitterness and a bit of a thin mouthfeel. Overall, while this is far from a great beer or a good example of the style, it is very refreshing and quite tasty considering the price. A beer I like to pick up every spring.","rangerred","Mar 31, 2014"

4.25,23.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Reviewed from notes. Enjoyed many times now formally reviewed for the first time. Poured from 12oz can into dimpled glass mug. Pours a rich but bubbly mahogany color with a nice half inch thick head. Taste of malt is good and present throughout but never heavy thanks to the carbonation before finishing crisp and clean. This is a good bock for the price and a style I wish I could get year round especially this one as the price for a 12 is great and good as a session. Probably my favorite from Genesee next to the more common Genesee Cream Ale. Solid bock beer for the price and surprisingly not watery...the can artwork is also great, once referred to as ""grandma beer"" by a Bud Light drinking party goer who saw me drinking the ""funny"" cans","Blueribbon666","Beers"

Well anyway, this brew poured to a deep amber color with shat I would call brown highlights. The head has a light tan color, quite small and breaks down quickly, minimal lacing. The aroma has caramel malts come through, slight grain presence. The taste is fair with caramel,slight hop presence and a slight metallic flavors. Has a slight dry finish to it. Overall, I would pick this up a few ties during the spring if Genesee continues to make it. Worth the $6.49 a 12 pack. Not the greatest brew but one that has some character and it is somewhat local.","Stimack","Apr 16, 2008"
3.09,-10.2,4,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"I snagged this while in New York, the retro packaging sucked me in. It looks good from the pour, a nice orange brown with a thick head that lingers momentarily. Much darker than any macro beer I've ever had. The aroma is sweet and grainy with not too much else besides a hint of dry toastiness. The flavor is a bit better, with just a bit of malty sweetness, and hints of caramel. The graininess I associate with most macros is still there but it's muted a bit. I think that if compared to craft beers of the style this one come up short, but if you compare it to other macros it is breath of fresh air.","ericj551","Apr 14, 2008"

I've bought 2 12 packs of this so far for myself and will keep buying it as my ""cheap beer of choice.""","wiseguy142","Apr 10, 2008"
3.85,11.9,3.75,3,3.75,5,4.5,"Sweet can. I love the old school can as well as the $6.45 price tag for a 12 pack. This brew poured wonderful reddish amber, with an off white head. The head is frothy and leaves good lacing on the glass. The aroma is of light malts and straw, adjusted with corn or rice. Also there is just a hint of caramel. The taste is sweet and malty, bready and pretzel like. Hops are almost a nonfactor. The palate is medium bodied creamy and smooth. Finish is short and sweet. Overall not outstanding but a good beer at a great price.","generallee","Apr 06, 2008"

3.58,4.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"The can alone is easily worth half the price of admission here, very similar to the original from the 70's that I remember fondly. This latest version is a dark iced tea brown with a big fluffy off white head and decent lace. It has a sharp wheat and mild caramel aroma. This is followed by a big caramel and dry herbal hop taste. A little rough around the edges but I don't find this to be bad at all as bock's go. Well carbonated and very drinkable. Nice job for a blue collar, low priced bock in a fun can. Party on Genee!","Durge","Mar 15, 2008"
2.91,-15.4,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"I'm grad that I was given a can of this beer to try because that way I don't feel ripped off. This is definaty one local brew that I can not support. It has that typical Genesee River smell and taste that I expected. I'm not quite sure how they consider this a bock beer.","iceball585","Mar 14, 2008"
3.13,-9,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"D: Good, and I will buy it again while it's available. This is a change as I've come to appreciate the upped flavor right from the can. I'm not the biggest fan of bock beers and only Celebrator has really showed me what a bock could/should be. Worth a try for the price.","Ricochet","Mar 11, 2008"
