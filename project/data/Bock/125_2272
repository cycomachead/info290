3.95,0.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The nose is rich, bready and fruity. Rather like fruitcake with raisins, brown sugar, toffee and vanilla. I'm guessing there's some Munich malt here, it's got that intoxicatingly complex signature of this malt with a darker, more caramelized character. No hops are detected. The palate opens with a blend of burnt sugar, a little vanilla and a moderate fruitiness. Despite this, it doesn't really _taste_ too sweet, and my guess would be that the burnt sugar bitterness has something to do with it. The bready character I picked out on the nose isn't really noticeable on the palate, though there is plenty of malt complexity - brown sugar, burnt sugar, caramel, a little toffee and a little butterscotch too. Drying on the finish with some toffee and burnt sugar bitterness, this beer has a medium body and is rather excessively carbonated for my liking. Still, this is a great bock, though in many ways, it's closer to a dopplebock.","DefenCorps","Jan 25, 2011"

Coffee gets bigger toward the finish with a faint sweet alcohol flourish. A bit of sourness. Bitterness flows into tea leafiness and leaves a dry caramel graham with toasted biscuits.

The taste is also different, but well done. Sweet and toasty malts roll around the tongue for a bit before giving way to spices and a very mild alcohol warming, with the appearance of a fine carbonation keeping it lively, ending dry and bittering up as the mouth smooths out.

The head is a solid surface layer of pale tan color that reduces itself to an oily surface layer with some slight cling on the edges. Bold and malty on the nose, some fruits come through to me right away (cherries) along with some chocolate aroma that basically reminds me of malty chocolate covered cherries, or of a Whitmans Cherry-filling chocolate square. Malty body on the sip followed along with some cherry flavor and chocholate that makes this seem like a nice dessert brew. Finish is slightly bitter and some hops even come through a bit. Sipping, the tip of my tongue tingles from the carbonation, but the alcohol hides in this one quite well at least until the finish and aftertaste, which sticks around a bit. Overall drinkability? Outstanding brew from Penn. I am not an overly-joyous fan of many of the offerings, but this one was great.

The taste, however, was confusing. I hope that the complexity of the brew is the reason (and not a year's worth of sitting in a warehouse). It tasted not bitter, not tart, but something akin to sour. I didn't expect that. Perhaps that's what it should be (from the other reviews I've read that cite "raisin" or "berry" or "fruit" in the taste).

Nice amount of carbonation; bubbles in streamers are rather separated but there are a lot of streamers. When held away from light, this is a very, very dark brown beer with rosewood highlights; when held to light it positively glows a shimmering translucent garnet... Aroma is of buttery Hallertau hops, a very buttery sensation throughout the nose itself; along with biscuits and bread there is a hint of raisiny sweetness. Flavor is very good, starting with a mellow caramel maltiness; this builds up to a plateau of warm spiciness, with suggestions of clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg that never goes over the top but remains extremely savory (never exceeding the bounds of drinkability); finally subsiding into a very delicate suggestion of hops at the back of the palate; this is balanced very well indeed. Mouthfeel includes a plucky carbonation but is a bit watery in the middle of the body, where I would prefer more assertion.

4.13,4.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice chocolate brown color with a thinner, soapy tan head. Good lacing. Has that nice funky bock yeast smell as well as some bready dark malt notes and a fair distinction of German hops. Rather rich and smooth, the malt profile of this beer is very nice; earthy and caramelly. I love bocks and this brewery's beers seem a little underappreciated, but they are pretty much right on target with their German replications.","crookedhalo","Dec 14, 2003"
3.82,-3,3,3.5,4,4,4,"I'm somewhat taken aback by the first sip because it's spicier than the bottled version. The flavor carries a well-balance blend of molasses, caramel, hops, and spices. None of those elements truly wins out over any of the others and this makes it quite drinkable. It's more challenging than the Harpoon Winter Warmer but, as I make my way through the pint, I find myself welcoming the challenge more and more. I described the bottled version of this beer as "a wimpy version of Rogue Santa's Private Reserve," but this seems like its own animal. The spices and hops are more unified here than in the Santa's, and once I get used to the hops it feels smoother. Overall I'd characterize the taste as brown; molasses, caramel, and a tiny bit of nuttiness pair up with the distinct hoppy character in a way that grows on me and leaves me wanting to try this again.","Weissenheimer","Dec 07, 2003"
3.85,-2.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Nice to see this on draught, as I'd never seen it before in any form. Chestnut colored body with no head, though this could have been due to a not-so-great- pour. Ah well. Slightly spicy aroma, bread, and alcohol in the nose as well. Flavor begins on the sweet side, but not a thick sweetness...more like a brown sugar kind of sweet. Big malt profile in the middle, a toasty, lightly bitter maltiness. Finishes slightly dry with a good smack of alcohol. An interesting winter seasonal. Nice to see a brewery doing something that not everyone else does for their winter seasonal.","IrishRedRock","Dec 02, 2003"
4.12,4.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Appearance: This local favorite christmas brew pours a perfect toasted crimson brown hue with a nice silky smooth tan nice sized head, leaving behind specks of lacing. Aroma: Spieces, toasted nuts, with a great Hallertau hop aroma going down, malty and rich smelling definitely a warming bock bier. Taste: Carmel malt sweetness with toasted nuts and a nice bitterness from the hops tames the barrage of sweet malt and festive spices. Mouthfeel: Medium to light in body mild carbonation just a bit spritzy. Drinkability: Classic by all means when referring to a local christmas bock beer, in the Burgh.","WVbeergeek","Dec 01, 2003"

4.27,8.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A rough pour delivers a slightly hazy mahogany body with a reddish-orange cast and a tall, foamy, light-tan head. It drops quite a bit at first, but maintains a pretty solid quarter inch of creamy foam that looks almost like a milkshake and leaves some nice spotty lace. The nose is lightly spicy from alcohol, and possibly hops, but it doesn't seem that any actual spice has been added. A dark, sugary caramel malt rounds out the aroma. Its medium body teams with a very fine and moderate carbonation to leave it creamy, smooth, and very drinkable. The flavor starts with a gently sweet, toasty and caramelized maltiness up-front; followed by a touch of light spiciness before finishing with some subdued bitterness and drying alcohol. It's quite a refined winter seasonal, and certainly not a hit-you-over-the-head beer. It's uncommon deeply-caramelized and almost-burnt-sugar maltiness combined with its subtle spiciness keeps it interesting - but never really satiates. In fact, it's far from overwhelming the palate and leaves you wanting more! A welcome winter specialty that can be enjoyed with a meal or on its own.","NeroFiddled","Apr 03, 2003"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Had on tap at D's..A friend who works there told me that Penn only bottles this one weekend a year, which is a shame because this is one hell of a beer. Pour a slightly tan head on top of a dark body. Slightly spicy and malty-sweety. Gives a nice warm feeling and has a noticeable alcohol taste. Not overly spicy like anchor's our special but yet has a that slightly spiced taste you'd expect from a christmas beer. Finishes smoothly leaving the drinker asking for another.","allboutbierge","Dec 30, 2002"
4.2,6.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Smooth, flavorful take on the bock style. Pours a dark gold with an off white head. Nose is of sweet malts and a whiff of alcohol. Deep, full bodied taste with plenty of caramel and toasted grain. Background of German hops and a warming alcohol kick keep this sweet brew on track. Really drinkable brew for the holidays. As others have said not spicy, but strong and malty for the cold weather.","QXSTER1","Dec 21, 2002"
4.55,15.5,4,4,5,4.5,4.5,"This dark brown beer pours with a thin, tan head that is very creamy and leaves a nice lice on the glass. The aroma is primarily malt, with a touch of spiciness. The taste is strong on roasted flavors, with a touch of sweetness and nuttiness. Nice hop bittering on the finish cleans the palate. This beer is creamy on the tongue, with just a touch of alcohol. This beer finishes rather clean, and is very appetizing. It would be easy to knock back a few of these in short order. Another great brew from an oft overlooked brewery.","aaronh","Dec 03, 2002"
