3.13,-6.3,3.5,3,3.25,3,3,"Bottle poured into a pint glass from a local brewery in Cabo San Lucas. I recall drinking this beer before my craft days, thinking that it was some sort of dark god. How times have changed. This reddish brown concoction may stand out a bit in a landscape of yellow fizzy beach brews but is an average bock at best, below average truth be told. Does show some light tan head but with a curiously fizzy thin body and an aroma that is strangely alcohol-forward, boozy and medicinal rather than richly sweet and fruity, although I do get a whiff of cherry cough syrup. The flavor is devoid of clear roasted or chocolate elements. There are some cherry, sultana raisin, and peach notes poking out here and there along with a brown sugar backbone that somehow manages to underperform compared to a brew like Negra Modelo. I am having to pay too much attention to taste the fruit notes and I'm simply not getting the big dark molasses flavor others are claiming. Like a Mexican Shiner Bock. Finish is on the grainy and medicinal side. Its not awful but I think I'll refrain from buying a 12-pack next time.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 09, 2014"

It's very close to rival Negra Modelo; this is a little richer and roastier, the Negra Modelo a little lighter and finishes a bit cleaner. If you like Mexi-darks, you'll like this just fine. It, or an equivalent dark from this brewer, ought to be available year-round, I'm somewhat surprised they don't really have anything to counter the Modelo unless it's Christmas season.

Aroma has this grassy herbal feel that also contains hints of cinnamon and spice spread over the top of a lightly toasted caramel malt. Taste comes across as a lot of the things promised in the nose, but not quite as strong as I would have anticipated from the nose, with the main flavor emphasis up front on the spice even coming across as understated before the tongue delves into the malt bill. Compared to other Christmas beers I have had it is rather underspiced but compared to other Mexican beers it is amazing.

The smell of the beer had some dark malt aromas with a light element of spice in there. The taste was pretty decent actually. I enjoyed the beers hint of holiday flavor it had. The mouthfeel was drinkable and well carbonated. Overall this brew wasn't too bad.","Knapp85","Nov 13, 2011"

I dont think there is any spice additions, but the interaction of the herbal hop and toasted malt gives it almost a nutmeg/cinnamon character that fits well with the beer. I am glad to see a Mexican brewery delve into the seasonal beer market. Body is fairly light and it drinks really easy. I am contemplating picking up another 12-pack of this before Christmas rolls around, especially at less than 15 bucks...Im fairly impressed!","twiggamortis420","Aug 21, 2011"

3.38,1.2,3.5,3,3,4.5,4,"The aroma is rather light for a bock, it's malty with a hint of brown sugar. The taste thankfully has more to it, bits of caramel and cinnamon and brown sugar.

3.63,8.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Flavor is clearly caramel-rich and backed by toasted cereal grains. Nothing too exciting, but it is impressively Bock-like for a Mexican beer. Body is medium-thin and crisp.

3.98,19.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Into a pint glass, this presents a very clear and deep reddish amber color under a thin but nicely sustained head. The aroma is a mild but noticeable sweet roasted malt nose with a light note of hops. There's a nice sweet roasted malt dominated and robust body here carried along by a pleasant medium carbonation into a caramel noted crisp malt finish. All in all, a no frills but solid bock.

We cooked the night away and I kept my mouth from getting dry by drinking Noche Buenas and I have to say they made for quite the refreshing evening.","RoyalT","Jul 29, 2010"

Overall I liked this one, but I wouldn't seek it out.","Dizzy","Dec 20, 2005"
3.66,9.6,4,3,4,3,4,"Very well presented bottle, great seasonal appeal, although it's a shame that the cap underneath the foil is blank. Looks like carbonated iced tea in the glass, very pretty. Appealing appearance and aroma. Aroma is mostly malt, a hint of hops tucked away in the back. A touch of sweetness, resolving to a mild hops finish. Maybe a little too much carbonation... I feel like some flavors might be being hidden by the bubbles. Not a whole lot of depth in the flavor department, but nothing to complain about either. Crisp finish, very drinkable. Probably the best Mexican macro out there.","hunteraw","Nov 29, 2005"

Finish has a moderate carbonation and the hops apropos to the style with the aftertaste being dry, drinkable, but a bit thin waisted for me.
