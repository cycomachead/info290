3.63,10.7,3.75,3.75,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: With the exception of the artificial note in the chocolate, I would say that this is a great dessert beer - and even with it in, I'd still say that it can easily work as a super chocolatey and sweet dessert beer. I'll make a note to myself, ""this will compliment, rather than contrast, most sweet desserts"". And on that note, it's great. As a beer to drink, however, I feel it fails miserably. It's one-sided, it's overtly sweet, and it has an artificial character that distracts.","NeroFiddled","Feb 28, 2015"

3,-8.5,,,,,,"Had a generous sample of this from my wife's pint at our local pourhouse. Very chocolatey, quite sweet. Both agreed that it would be an excellent 'dessert' beer, as in with some actual dessert consumption. I wouldn't drink a whole pint... not my cup, etc. However, it is what they said it is, and that is okay in my book!","Mikus","Nov 01, 2014"
3.75,14.3,,,,,,"Overall much better than their pumpkin ale they make which was pretty much pure candied cinnamon no pumpkin. This beer to me reminds me of a blend of Young's Chocolate stout and the body of Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock. Don't drink it if you don't like sweet beers.","DrDemento456","Nov 01, 2014"
2.72,-17.1,3.5,2.75,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Thanks to HopFace for the opportunity to try this one.  12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint.  Pours a deep mahogany hue with a translucent clarity and a loose, 1/8th inch, tan-colored head that quickly disperses towards the edges.  Big dark chocolate notes on the nose followed by a hint of dark fruit.  Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a distinct, cloyingly sweet artificial sweetener character that really asserts itself and lingers between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation.  Overall, not a good beer - cloyingly sweet and not in a good way.  I may not be able to finish this one.","Jwale73","Beers"
