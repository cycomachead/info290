"Overall - not a bad bock, nice flavors, a little on the lighter side, very drinkable."

"Overall: Being a little snobby about my beer, I had pretty low expectations for this beer. I was pleasantly surprised with a solid easy drinking Bock. The growler is a nice size to share with some friends and enjoy a very good beer. Nothing elite but is still very enjoyable."

"Overall: Bock is not a style I drink a lot, but this was surprisingly one of the tastier versions I have had in some time. Sweet but not too sweet, smooth, and not overly complex. This one was the perfect pizza beer for me. I would get this again--and maybe a couple of glasses at that."

"This a a very drinkable bock. Damn good. Go try it for yourself."
""
"Overall: A different take on the style, and an OK beer but sweeter than I like. I would like to try it on tap but would not buy in bottles."

"O - This is a lot sweeter than most bocks that I have tried. It goes down smooth enough, but it just seems off."
""
""
"O - This just isn't a very good beer. This is what scares me about American made Bock beers."
""
""
"I got as part of a botmc, dark brown pour with a 2"" white head, slight lacing. The aroma is very sweet, bready, caramel It is on the sweeter side, some carael malts, lingering sweet finish. The body is light, good carbonation, easy drinking. A decent easy drinking brew."
"O - This is an okay bock. A little too sweet for my taste."
"B- to C+"

""
""
"Overall: not an terribly strong bock by any means, but it is malt centric. Somewhat refreshing it is a decent beer overall."

"*1084 = March 25, 2011."
"Served as part of an 8-pour beer sampler at Granite City, St. Louis Park, MN. Pour was reddish brown with a bit of head that faded quickly with not much lace. Smell was sweet malty, slightly nutty, reminiscent of New Castle Brown Ale. Taste was mildly sweet malt, a bit earthy, nutty and some grain. Light body, moderately low carbonation. Okay, not great."

"Overall, its a great sweet malty caramel beer. I enjoy this and will definitely buy it again. I bought it in a mix and match 6 pack at HyVee. Give this one a try if you like porters or stouts."
"O- It has the right flavor profile for me, but the body just isn't there. As such, it's barely passable for me."
"O: Not the worst bock I've had but certainly nowhere near the benchmark for the style either; I've had this brew on tap at the pub and much preferred it that way, perhaps it is better when a bit fresher"
""
"I did not like the GC Bock...I thought it was way to malty and grainy. The beer poured very dark red with thin white head that did not lace all that great. The smell was big on grain and sweet malt. The taste was to much malt and barley with slight sweetness. The beer had mediyum body not great carbonation. Overall not a great beer. Most is probably drank in the Two Pull variety."
"Not bad; I'd like to try this on tap."
"Finish: Earthy and caramel notes linger"
"O: horrible beer IMO. The only good thing is the appearance."
"D: Drank the entire growler in a couple of sittings, but was more of a chore rather than a motivation. I won't actively seek out again."
"Lighter body with good carbonation. Goes down easy, but be in the mood for a maltier brew."
"20 IBU's. just FYI"
"The Brother Benedicts Bock was a great beer. It is very dark, reddish brown. It has thick foamy head that lingers for a short time. The taste is very malty and rich. There is a slight hint of chocolate in the aftertaste, similar to a stout I would say. I really enjoyed this beer. I've been impressed with the beer that Granite City has to offer."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, pale malt, and slight sweet malt. Fits the style of a Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, slight hop, and slight grain. Overall, weak in body, aroma, but again a great appearance."
"On tap in Fort Wayne. 4.95 for a 20 oz. This one comes poured with about a one finger head. The head quickly fades after a sip or two. The malt is the overwhelmingly strong scent in this brew. A hint of chocolate also touches the nose. The taste is nothing exceptional either. The malts taste burned and the chocolate also is there much like the smell in just a hinted version. I get maybe a dash of hops in the taste. The mouthfeel feels light, it's almost as if it's a thin bock. I couldn't drink any more than one of these and wouldn't drink it again. Especially for the price."
"Notes: This was the first beer I've had from the ""brewpub"" chain Granite City. I'd say this at least met my expectations, which weren't enormously high. The slight deceit of calling Granite City a brewpub may irk some (I'll admit it does me), but I can't disparage this decent bock."
"D- This is a very ""everyone friendly"" beer. Nothing stands out in this one to make it a great beer. Almost reminds me of a sweeter Amber Bock. Didn't mind it but was expecting a little more."
"Dark brown with no signs of carbonation & no head at all. Aroma of roasted malts & no hops. Flavor: malt is very complex with suddle roasted notes. Slight tangyness aftertatse & no hops to speak of. Mouthfeel: This beer is lightly carbonated, balance is ok but is missing something but unsure of what & no head at all. Overall this beer reminds me of a poor bown with no presence of alcohol. I feel this beer could be good but needs more work."
"Mouthfeel is very light and even a little flat it goes down very quickly. Not horrible, but nothing worth going back for. So I guess I have a $15 growler for the shelf."
"D: Really good, mostly because of the things mentioned above."
"Very clear, light/medium brown, red highlights with light coming through. Flimsy white head fades fast, just a faint bit of lacing. SMELL is non-existent at first, as it was very cold. As it warmed, some grainy chocolate malt aroma, faint esters with a swirl. Takes alot of warming and work to find anything. TASTE follows nose. Grainy, vaguely roasty, faint hints of both sweetness and bitterness. FEEL moderate carbonation, thin body, just a touch of texture. DRINKS pretty easily due to thinness of body. The best one of the four they had. I wouldn't seek it out, but if you are there for dinner it'll do."
"D: At under 6%, this beer is a great quaffer. I'd've happily had a few more pints."
"had this on tap at the gc food and brewery. i was told it was brewed on premises there in kansas city. it was a very good crisp bock beer. dark in color light shined barely through the opaque. nice rich aroma. good taste that was crisp and fresh. excellent lacing down the glass. if you are in the area, give this place a try."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable and accompanies the food nicely."
"D - I almost never say a beer is too sweet but this one didn't seem balanced. Sweet and watery with a very slight malt."
"D- a solid bock, 2 people finished the 2 L jug in a little over an hour"
"Drinkability: Tasty yet really seems to be trying to be inoffensive. They did not take many chances with this brew."
"I was really surprised by how much I liked this beer. The transparent mahogany body was a touch thin and watery looking but the head was creamy and pretty for a minute or so before it dissolved to nothing. I took in a heavy aroma of caramel malt with just a slight touch of alcohol sweetness. The taste is surprisingly robust considering the watery appearance and to a lesser degree, mouthfeel. Well balanced with plenty of sweetness as one would expect for the style but with a nice light touch of hops. Minute carbonation plays with the tongue. Flavors of cocoa, caramel, and leafy hops are all light and nice. Very drinkable. I am really impressed with this beer, mostly because of the low expectations I had for it, but impressed none-the-less."
"A clear, very deep brown mahogany body is capped by a creamy head of off-white foam. The head dissipates shortly, but that seems to be fairly common for the style. Lacing is limited to spots and splashes left here and there. The nose is clean and expresses darkly caramelish malt with just a hint of hoppiness in the background. In the mouth it's medium bodied and somewhat creamy with a fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation. The flavor is straightforward, darkly caramelish and lightly toasty malt with a thread of leafy hops and the suggestion of alcohol, although it never really shows itself. Very nicely done! Full-flavored and perfectly balanced. Perhaps the best bock I've ever had at a brewpub!"
"Overall: Enjoyable, just a little below the IPA in the overall marking stakes but a good effort that I had little trouble with. I think it exhibited more English Brown Ale tones than the Bock moniker would have you believe though  not that that is a complaint from me I have to say."
"D - So far this is my favorite beer from Granite City, but it could be hit or miss according to the batch it came from. If you have a chance, give this one a try and I doubt you'll be disappointed."
"P.S. - this beer was served waaaay too cold, in a chilled glass."
"Had a pint over lunch at the quasi-brewpub. Brown with a bit of a white head and touch of lacing. Not bad, but it could look better. Smell and taste are heavy on the chocolate and not much else. There's a little bit of dark fruit and licorice, but its mostly chocolate. Simple taste, but the a lack of off-flavors still make it a satisfying drink."
"The so called Mai Bock as a beer was a little watered down as well. The yeast was nothing exciting and difficult to pick up the yeast. Overall I was not impressed and more confused on this beer. Maybe add more English malts and fuller body and you have a decent English Brown Ale."
"Tasted On-Tap 05/11/05 at the Cedar Rapids, IA location."
"I am listing this as a bock, because it shows none of the characteristics of a Maibock. Dark brown color, looks much more like a bock. Roasted malt in the nose, very tame and slightly chocolatey, like a bock. Taste does not have the alcohol presence, rich maltiness, or the spiciness of a maibock. Mouthfeel was carbonated ok, but not that impressive. Good drinakability, but not very unique."
"Drinkability: As stated, easy to drink, a nice beer. Pairs well with many of the foods served as it is mellow, without any strong flavor characteristics standing out."
"i tasted this beer on tap and the Cedar Rapids location. Overall this bock has a fulland complete taste. Not the best bock in the world, but a rich malty roasted flavor can be tasted along with a nice sweet yeast flavor. The dark color makes this a very attractive beer."
"*consumed at the West Des Moines location"
"Really a nice tasting bock...doesn't fit the maibock profile but whatever...I like the flavor a lot...they should call it a bock though...."
"Brother Benedict pours a dark red with a thin head that disappears quickly. A medium body, with the taste of roasted malts and somewhat light toast feel left on the palate. My personal Granite City favorite, can drink this one anytime! A rather tasty brew."
"This beer comes out with bright red color and small head.  The body is relatively light and the finish clean which compliments the bready, biscuity flavors of the brew. Pretty good."
