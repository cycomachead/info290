"Aroma is pale malts, nuttiness and hints of bread. The flavor is pale malts, bread, mild sweetness, fruit, a hint of citrus hops and a mildly spicy/a hint of heat/alcohol in the finish."

"I went with a heavy hand on my pour and although it was not really my intent, I got a pseudo-cascade all the same. Settling, I was left with a massive there-plus fingers of dense, creamy, tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep-amber, bordering on copper (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich and malty, kind of caramel, very sweet. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the taste was very much like liquid caramel! Wow. I usually disdain sweet beers, but such the style for this beer, plus it was not cloying. That is to say, there was the inherent sweetness, but it did not linger, like a more syrupy beer might. Instead, the finish evinced an alcohol heat which rendered it semi-dry as a whole. Not bad, and at the price point, worth at least a try."

"Overall, just couldn't find anything over a 3 in the rating category here, but I'll still finish the six pack."

"Baby Got Bock is a real nice name. The label is creative and inviting. It looks okay and there was nothing on the nose to indicate the assault I was about to be the subject of. I took a sip, and said, not bad.... woah, what the heck was that. I winced with a strong, strange, tart sour flavor. Surely I had been mistaken. So I took another half-ounce swallow. I was not mistaken, my throat muscles tensed up, I crinkled my nose and my head shook. I promptly took the ale glass to the powder room sink and poured it down without reservations. In conclusion, this offering from Horny Goat satisfies just as well as the others I have sampled. Sorry to say, as I really dislike being negative. But truthfulness reigns."

"The aftertaste is also quite good. Overall this exceeds expectations and if I were looking for a good bock to read this would be a recommended author!"
"Overall feels like it falls a little short of the goal. Best part is the brewery and name."
"No hint of ABV on bottle or in the sampling. A decent brew that is sweet but not cloying. Very easy to drink and enjoyable."

"Overall, this is a big improvement over last year's batch of Baby Got Bock. I live near Milwaukee and talked to the Brewmaster who said they reformulated this beer. Haven't had it on draft yet but I will definitely look for it."

"Drinkability is very nice on this beer. A normally do not like bocks very much at all. Horny Goat's offering has very strong tastes to it and a lot going on. I really like this offering and would definitely seek out this one again."
"D: Why?"

"Overall: not an overly exciting bock, but it hits the spot when you want a malty beer."
"O - This is not the best bock you'll ever have, but it's not bad. I would buy another sixer."
"Clear, darker-gold colored brew. Fair amount of rising carb bubbles, small but durable white head. Scent is mainly sweet lagered malts, just a hint of hops. Taste is alright, I'm getting some green-bottle notes from it however. Focus is on the malt, some grass, a touch of bitter hops. Pretty soft mouth, medium to full. Overall not bad, but whether its intentional or not, the green-bottle taste (and its not sold in a green bottle, but you know what im talking about) takes it down a notch."
