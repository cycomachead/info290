"Lot of reviews mention harshness and excessive alcohol, and that seems to jive with my memory of this brew. But boy, did that ever work itself out with some patience and aging! Phenomenal brew at this point."

"O-A nice Bock, very sweet at the tip of the tongue. However the alcohol is the nose is a drawback."

"O: a nice brew, no hint of the 9%. She drinks nice"

"O: All in all, this is a good beer. Very smooth drinker. I have not had too much from the style, but this is a very smooth mainstream version. Try if you like a smooth bock."
"There are a few things off about this beer which is disappointing since I'm a fan of Bocks and have enjoyed most of the other Leviathan series beers. Things started off wrong with the aroma and just couldn't impress with the taste."

"A good combination of sweet with a bitter hop kicker. Rich like a bock should be. The carbonation is low, almost flat. The alcohol presence is very subtle. The aftertaste is a pleasant blend of malted sugars and peppery hop."
"O - definitely drinkable and decent but nothing to write home about. worth a try"
"I feel the bock should be a clean, smooth, aloholic brew that exihibits malt complexity. The yeast/fermentation took away the from the clean/smooth. If brewer worked on that, it would be much improved."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, mellow fruit and candy sugar, still lager like too. In the taste, candy sugar dryness and a small fruit and lager-ish flavor all the way through. A candy sugar bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruity candy sugar in the aftertaste. Bigger and OK, but bit too much candy sugar."
"Quick buzz."
"Overall not great, has some iffy flavors, off flavors as well with phenols and esters, some herbal bitter flavors I'm not a huge fan of as well, and sticky sweet. Overall the worst of all the Leviathan beers so far, not terrible, but not good."
"Taste is pretty damn sweet, lighter than caramel, but not quite sugary either....lets go with burnt Karo syrup. Nutty, toffee maltiness is interesting, but I would not go so far as pleasant. Little bit of dry bitterness on the finish, alcohol probably more accountable than hops. There is a strange vegetal flavor I am getting that is not all that cool. I can see why this is not a doppelbock, it just doesnt have the malt backing and body for it. Im not really a big fan of this, the Leviathan series is about 50/50 for me...the half I do like I think are spectacular though, like the Triticus and Quad. One thing they always are is interesting, so I say carry on Harpoon, carry on."
"Overall, this is a good bock, and certainly evidences a great amount of care on Harpoon's part: the flavors are huge, and the result is delicious. My only concerns are that, at times, the beer can get slightly too yeasty for my tastes, and there is a hint of a vodka-like alcohol tinge at the edges."

"Pours a pretty clear copper with a big head. Nice lacing on the surface throughout. Smell initially is grassy hops. Actually a very generic beer smell. Surprising for this beer. But after taking a sip I'm getting a little more caramel smell. Taste is pretty nice- balanced with a nice sweet maltiness and herbal/grassy hoppiness. Yeah it's sweet but not so sweet as to be a negative. I think the real problem is the mouthfeel, which is pretty bad. I feel like this is very under-carbonated. Somehow it poured with a big head but half-way through it seems like there's no carbonation. Too heavy and syrupy. Overall this beer is all over the place. In summation it's okay. It has a nice flavor but the mouthfeel kills it. Honestly this beer is making me appreciate the mouthfeel category here on beeradvocate more than ever before. Very necessary, it turns out- as this beer tastes nice but the mouthfeel kills it."
"A very strong bock as they advertise. The strength of the sweetness and alcohol take away from this one for me, a spice attack as well."
"Harpoon Leviathan Über-Bock is a very clear amber lager with a thin white head that dissipates pretty quickly. It has a malty aroma with notes of bread and lemon. It's pretty full bodied and prickly on the tongue. The finish is a bit watery and it leaves the mouth a little sticky. It's sweet and malty. It gets sweeter as the taste goes on. I taste melanoids, lemon and black pepper. It's a little warming but the sweetness is more prominent than the alcohol. This is a sturdy lager with no glaring faults."
"Forms a deep amber hue in the body with a fine khaki tinted thicket of head, light tan creamy texture head floats about three fingers worth above the russet amber body. Nose at first sniff has an air of fruitiness with some fresh grains interwoven, a big show of malt. Actually reminds me of being in malt rooms at different breweries a very nice cereal nose with accented dark fruits, minimal hops showing early. Flavor is a really nice display of specialty malt sweetness, some raisin/caramelized sugars interplaying with some breadiness and a bit of ripened banana. Booze in the back end but upfront it's just a nice malt monster, that should gain some respect from other German style brewers. A definite American hybrid amped up bock that actually flies well, underlying hop burps are herbal and a bit earthy...just solid big beer that doesn't completely rape and pillage your palate. Mouthfeel is big bodied but not cloyingly so, it's a nice gentle giant with a hint of harshness from the minimal booze detected. Malt laiden on the palate but I wouldn't say this one ever reaches the realm of cloying, it's more like a slow bubbled carbonation in a big bodied beer. Overall a great malty beer that compares to Sierra Nevada's recent big bock bier, comes from a similar vein without being a knockoff, actually different to brew a bigger malt addition offering without an explosion of alpha hops...it's amazing how beer this good is now off the beaten path."
"Clear, coppery orange with a short cap of fine off-white foam. Fair head retention, a bit of sticky lacing. Malty aroma, cereal grain and some sweetness, fairly clean but with some alcohol and a hint of fruit, buttery caramel and light hops. Caramel sweetness up front followed by grainy, sugary notes and alcohol in the finish. Slightly fruity with bitterness lurking just underneath the malts. Hints of marshmallow and hops. Decent texture, full bodied with lowish carbonation, moderate alcohol warmth. Overall, it was alright. A little hotter than I would have liked, but I did enjoy some of the malt character."
"I am a little disappointed in this one from the leviathan series though. I have come to expect a lot out of these, and this one was disappointing. It is a nice beer to sip on in the spring, but it was just meh for me."
"O - I love the Leviathan Series but this one isn't doing it for me."
"don't get me wrong -- i know i sound down on this one, but with a few tweaks, this could be a very good beer."
"First, beer is super thin, big disappointment. Mildly alcoholic, bready, grainy acidity in the back, odd beer overall. Not a great example in my opinion. I won't have it again."
"Not sure what to say, other than this is one beer I won't be ordering again. Uggghhh...."
"Pours a two finger off-white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Crystal clear ruby/orange color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Fruit and malty nose, flavor is caramel, almost sweet raisin and smooth. Higher ABV is hidden. $3.45 for a 12oz bottle from Bert’s Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
"Not too bad. I've seen better examples where the alcohol is hidden better. Still worth a try."
"O - Honestly I have mixed feelings about this one, it's good, but slightly overwhelming. Definitely worth trying."
"Pours a clear copper color with an average white head with a thin collar as it goes down. The nose is heavy on bread and is actually quite grainy. No real hop character or anything else; perhaps a bit of booze. The flavor is bready and mildly sweet with quite a bit of raw grain. Average carbonation and a medium body and grainy tannic character in the finish. Not a huge fan."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, strong kick, decent representation of style although heavier than most, there are others in the style that I would pick first."
"Bottle: Poured a clear medium amber color bock with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of solid caramelized sugar with balanced sweetness level is quite enjoyable. Taste is an easily drinkable mix between some caramelized malt with balanced sweetness. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed with nice balanced with great drinkability factor and limited complexity."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet, pilsner and Munich malt scent along with a touch of yeast fruitiness. The taste is good as well. It has a smooth Munich malt flavor. It's silky smooth going down with a rich, sweet, maltiness that lingers in the finish along with a bit of alcohol warmth. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good Maibock. It's a tad syrupy which may turn people off, but the malt character is damn good."
"I would drink it again, but am not overly impressed."
"A big Maibock with intense flavors, but some imbalance. Not a bad offering, but not quite drinkable."
"A very good beer with a copper color that is deep and clear with a thin biege head. As you get ready to take a drink the aroma reminds me of the traditional German Ales. The first taste reminds me of caramel and finishing with a slight bitterness. A very good beer that went well with the Vermonter panini at the Harpoon Brewery in Windsor, VT."
"overall i'd say this is an above average offering, though not by much. fully quaffable, but definitely not my favorite from the leviathan series."
"Overall it was ok, agree it could be a little smoother and not so hot in taste, but maybe some aging would help that."
