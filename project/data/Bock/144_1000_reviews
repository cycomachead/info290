"A well-made, enjoyable, mildly warming yet easy-to-drink bock!"

"I had this right after visiting the Civil War Museum in Kenosha. So the taste of civil rights was lingering ever so slightly on my palate. They served this to us first thing upon starting the tour. It was good, but like the tour, it was short lived. If you like winter lagers, you might dig it."

"Didn't hold up in flavor as well as aroma, but still pretty complex and good melanoidin character. Would love to try one fresh."

"16 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 11/20/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, light roasted malt, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity esters with light hops; very pleasant and inviting with solid strength. Taste of caramel, pear, apple, toast, brown bread, brown sugar, light nuttiness, floral, light pepper, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, light fruits, brown bread, light pepper, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of malt/hop flavors with light fruity esters; with a fair amount of robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with and a lightly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol i very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice bock. Good balance and robustness of malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O=Not really strong or bitter enough for a bock profile, but more of a light-bodied brown ale. Flavor and body are enough for a decent session ale...I might buy again or try on tap."

"Seems sort of flat and"
"O: This is a nice easy drinking beer in the style that has a nice amount of flavors but isn’t that full-bodied. It’s a good choice if you are looking for something that is malty but not that filling."
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied with slightly below medium-level carbonation. Resultant mouthfeel is clean and generally smooth flowing, the beer foaming up just slightly on the palate. The lower carbonation actually fits this beer, as it is something to roll around on the palate and not drink quickly."
""
"Sweet thick crusted bread with a spritz of plum or prune jelly. Yeasty, malty, toasty, and lightly roasted. This beer comes together well, but with a dry finish. Easy to drink one after the other. Pitty I have to wait till Winter to buy this again."

"O) This was okay.... As far as winter brews are concerned, I will look for some other options, before I head back to this one."
""
"Bottle from Riley's in Madison. Pours a mildly thick broth. It did have some bulk to the mouthfeel, a tad sour rather than bitter, though hops shine at end. Initially tasty bock with complex malt and then drinkability elapsed as I found it far from complex. Carbonation a tad aggressive."
"Winter Brew is a highly acclaimed Munich-style Dunkel Bock that lives up to its local reputation."
"Tastes stronger than it is. They should make this into an even lower alcohol beer with so much flavor. Found this one far from home in Asheville at the great Bruisin' Ales."
"Pours a very dark amber color with a rather fast diminishing head. Has a heavy cocoa scent. Upon tasting there is a heavy taste of robust malts mixed with carmel and a coffee taste. Definetly a very heavy Bock that almost borderlines a Stout like taste. Not anything you will be able to drink fast. This beer has to be enjoyed slowly."
"I'm glad this showed up in my market to give it a try, but if I want a winter-specific beer to warm myself by, I'll pick another first."
"This beer pours a murky brown color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel, perfume, and more caramel. This is a very German aroma. The taste is full of caramel and toffee. It is flavorful, but lacks true depth. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, and cloyingly sticky. Carbonation is mild. Overall, this is a nice bock, but there are better examples out there that I would turn to before trying this beer again."
"Sprecher does an excellent job crafting German lager styles and this one is no exception."
"I have always liked this beer. Quite a good winter beer that I wish I could get my hands on more often when the season rolls around."
"D) A pretty decent brew. I could drink one or two after a meal. Not my first choice but it was a nice change of pace."
"D) A good brew. I might not always come back for a second one."
"This winter brew lacks the ""holiday spices""; something many beer aficionados will be pleased to find. No faults detected, but somewhat lacking in interest."
"D - Not bad, it tasted alright, but failed to be really impressive in any way. I wasn't disappointed, but I can't think of any reason why I would drink it again."
"Overall the smoke tone was a pleasant surprise. A very nice bock."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, spritzy, and chewy. Really good winter brew."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of caramel, alittle spice note. The taste is sweet, malty, with some caramel and a nice little touch of spice. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew."
" ~ Overall this is a good brew. One I would certainly enjoy again. Thanks for WJVII I was able to give it a sampling."
"D - I was pretty disappointed drinking this one I like most winter beers and I like bocks so I really wanted to like this beer but the dirty taste is too much for me but if you like dirty mop water give it a shot"
"Drinkability - One and I'm done. Maybe I am over spiced beers for the Christmas season, but it was a bit difficult to finish this up."
"D - This is quite a nice bock. I'm pleasantly pleased as I finish it, but not overly surprised as I've a great deal of respect for the brewery. They seem to do a fantastic job for a regional brewery while maintaining high standards."
"Dark brown/black colored beer, but translucent and fizzy. Smell is sweet.. mostly raisins to me. Taste contains some fruit, but primarily stale-ish bread with a slight twinge of hops at the finish. Not much alcohol presence with a well carbonated mouthfeel."
"Pours dark amber brown with thin tan head. Nose is a bit medicinal/cough syrupy but also hints of roasted malt and brown sugar. Taste is largely chocolate malts with mild sweetness. Low in hopping as expected, but a slight bitter aftertaste, likely fromt the roasted malts. Decent palate presence with a light fizz on the tongue. Overall enjoyable, just not one of my top Sprecher brews."
"Drinkability: Very nice bock overall, despite the hops becoming slightly distracting. Drinking it while eating (I had cheese) seems to improve the malts slightly and lower the spiciness somewhat."
"D: A good fall/winter beer. I could drink a few of these. Seasonally appropriate flavors/ABV/textures for a winter beer."
"D - A wonderful winter warmer that provides a good, smooth full body without the large alcohol presence most others carry. A very good beer, especially this fresh! I expect it to be one of my favorites this season!"
"Drinkability: decent I would definitely have another on a night where I want a light beer."
"(D)- At 5.75% abv, the 4 pks would be a welcome sight in any fridge. A better fall brew than a winter one in my opinion, but still enjoyable nonetheless. I also think this would be much better fresher, cause this kinda old considering its a winter seasonal . . . I plan on re-reviewing it when winter comes around again."
"Poured from a stubby 16 ounce bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The bock appears a hazed deep crimson brown color with about an inch of creamy light ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of medium roasted grain, toasted bready malt, caramel, slightly grassy hops, mild coffee notes, a tad nutty even. A notch or two better than medium bodied and amply carbonated. Worth a try."
"Clear, dark ruby brown color with a quickly dissipating tan head and some small streaks of lacing. Deep, rich aroma of malt, caramel, toasted aromas, etc. Chewy, medium body with light carbonation and slight hop bite in finish. Flavor is toasted malt, brown sugar, caramel. Finish has a slightly watery quality that detracts from the the initial creamy mouthfeel. Not a great bock, but enough flavor and body to be drinkable and slightly enjoyable."
"Sprecher Winter Brew poured a very dark ruby, almost appearing brown, with a small tan head. Smell was loaded with Sweet malts with hints of brown sugar. Taste was of sweet dark malt, with hints of roasted characteristics. Mouthfeel was a bit thick, but the drinkability was very nice. Overall this was another well done beer from a very good brewery. I enjoyed this beer, and will look for it again."
"D: Very flavorful and well balanced."
"The appearance is brown with a smaller head. The aroma is malty with toasted malt, coffee, paper, pine hops, and brown sugar. The taste is just like the aroma but more bitter than I was expecting. The palate is too thin. Overall it's definitely driunkable but not enjoyable."
"A medium bodied beer, with moderate carbonation. A pretty decently done bock that fits the season."
"Drinkability - a good bock, worth a try."
"Comment got 2 of these in a sample pack. Not one I'm going to seek out and buy."
"Poured a rich amber color with a light off white head leaving minimal lacing on the glass. This brew has a very sweet aroma, toffee, chocolate, and some slight orange. The taste is sweet with a mixture of the mild malts. There is a little more than a medium body. This is a solid seasonal brew, better in the coldness of a winter than the heat of summer. Very good brew from Sprecher, as usual!"
"Maybe I was just thirsty after work but I was really impressed with this Sprecher brew. I picked up a variety 8 pack from Sprecher at Santori's Liquors in Lansing IL my last time in the Chicago area to visit family and WOW, I 've heard great things from Sprecher and would have to say it's quite a good little brewery. Watch out Miller."
"While nothing astonishing, this is a very good bock that's hard to pass up."
"An OK beer. Not one to revisit."
"D-I did like this despite it's shortcomings. I wish it had a bit more full flavour and body...somewhat undertoned in taste and thin of body."
"This wasn't too bad. A little more robust taste and thicker body would have been welcomed but for what it is, it's still fairly flavorfull and drinkable."
"Bought a Sprecher Sampler and this is a close second to Black Bavarian."
"D- a solid bock"
"Drinkability is average for this style. Heavy inside but goes down well. I think this is a little thin for a bock."
"Slightly smoky caramel flavor mostly. Light hint of cocoa. Medium bodied, and easy to session. Pretty well-rounded without any detectable flaws. Not a bad choice, usually pretty cheap, it was $4 at Handlebar."
"Ultimately, too thin for me, but a decent bock. Not quite good enough for a winter ale, though. Shouldn't a bock be a spring seasonal? More malt, more hops, please!"
"cheers!"
"Would not consider this a session beer for me. Not much going on."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are fine, and it would be worth grabbing a second or third of this if it were tastier. Yet that won't happen before I get my hands on other Winter brews. This needs more...umph. I'd recommend more spiciness, a little more kick with hops, and more fruit as well to blend with the rest. Not a bad beer, mind you, just not as good as it could be, nor as I had hoped."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not all that filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it's a beer worth drinking for a while but not one that I would want to drink for an extended period of time."
"This is not an unpleasant beer, but it is too light on the malts, and it does not really ""warm up"". Very limited, and I will not buy it again."
"My high hopes for Sprecher Winter Brew haven't been realized. I'm sure they sell a lot of it up Wisconsin way, but other than a good look and an easy, unchallenging drinkability, I don't see the attraction."
"16oz. bottle poured a dark reddish/brown color with a little tan head that leaves barely any lace. Smells of roasted and caramel malts with some prune or raisin scents. This brew has a somewhat dry bitterness to it with roasted malt flavors. It has a light/medium feel with a touch of carbonation. I didn't find this one that drinkable but it probably is better fresh."
"Mahogany, deep glowing chestnut highlights. Creamy dark tan head. Slowly settles. Lacing OK. Restrained aroma. Malty, dark caramelish. Subtle fruit. Bock? Dunkel? Rich, caramelish, malty, grassy/herbal/spicy hops - spicy - some alc. ? 5.75%abv Clean. Crisp. Suggestion of fruit from dark malt. Plum. Fig?~herbal hop combo? Underlying dark chocolate edge w/ some dark almost burnt sugar. Thankfully not a spiced beer. Basic enjoyable winter ale w/ good drinkability. Malty, dark, slightly elevated alcohol... not quite in any style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" tan head over the clear brownish burgundy brew. Head fades slowly, with ample sticky lacing. Aroma is lightly of malts, with a minimal hops tinge. Taste is ample amounts of medium to dark grains, maybe a bit on the sweet side, light hops character, with a bit of aftertaste that didn't hit me the right way. Mouthfeel is almost thin, but bocks don't always need to be chewy, and the creaminess helps it out, and drinkability is reasonable, with the lack of heaviness helping here. Not everything I was hoping for, but it'll do."
"D- The flavors of this beer are a bit dull with the hops being only bitter and no depth or other flavors."
"Aroma is an alcohol laced perfumey affair with a richness that comes from concentrated malt flavors. Body is a dark mahogany and holds a two finger thick tan head that is mostly lasting. Free of the dusty house flavor/aroma some of the Sprecher beers seem to have. Fore is a a fruity blast that features stewed plums, sweet raisins and a bit of Brown Ale-like peanut skin flavor. Soft and pleasant on the tongue. Nice."
"On the whole, I was very impressed by this beer. Probably would not have thought about buying it--picked it up due to price and a whim. Though out of season now it was well worth the taste."
"Moderate to almost full mouth that gets a good amount of carbonation to clear the palate. Not my favorite style yet I like this beer and will buy it again for when I'm in the mood to step outside of my usual styles."
"Pours a lovely, clear ruby brown with a real good frothy head lasting a good 5 minutes, tan in color, with falling, foamy lacing down the glass. Relatively weak aroma, of mildly roasted malts yielding brown sugar and a twinge of toffee, and a slight hop spice to boot. Good, just need more. Taste starts slow, kind of bland idea of malts, toffee, then through the middle malts turns to brown sugar and then a slight hop bittering toward the end finishing with dark fruits, ending with that bitter. Body has a decent weight to it, smooth enough but nothing special. Overall, probably good brew from what I""m beginning to understand is an unererrated brewery. Nice."
"Final Thought: I just picked this one up a few weeks ago as a $1 special, and special it was."
"Appearance wise, this one passes the test with a deep roasted red-brown body and beautiful bubbly head that dissipates just a little too quickly. Nice balanced carbonation. Drinkablity suffers only from the aforementioned brown sugar."
"16 ounce bottle. Sprecher Winter Brew pours out a dark brown color with a ruby tint. There's just a small head on this beer. Toasted malt with a bit of fruit. The flavor starts out with toasted malt. Fruit and cocoa come in at the middle. A little nutty. The finish is bitter with grassy hops. This beer is not thick, but it is very flavorful. Drinkability is very high. Unlike many bocks, this beer is poundable. Great winter beer, if you're looking for something flavorful but not too heavy."
"Regardless, a quaffer I downed multiple pints of without batting an eye."
"good brew...i havent had enough of the style though"
"Another great brew from one of my favorite breweries. A very well balanced and interesting beer that you can enjoy all night. The tan head is full, and recedes to a patchy film after a short while. Aroma is malty and sweet with toffee. Very well balanced with lots of malt flavor and just enough bitterness to prevent an overly sweet taste, no hop flavor. Mouthfeel is substantial enough to register but no more, dead on. I can drink these all night."
"Oh how I would love to try this on-tap someday, I'm thinking the chocolate tones would really take over and make for an almost creamed porter-like experience. Still, this bottled version is sublime! Drinkability is very easy goin' and lubricious. Goes down fast and without much effort. This is probably my new favorite from Sprecher putting the O-fest and Black Bavarian a close second. Great stuff!"
"Pours a hazy dark reddish brown with a small light brown head that leaves some lacing. Sweet chocolate cookie dough and dark fruit aromas, plum, dark cherry, caramel, smoky chocolate flavors that blend together so nicely. Medium to full bodied and a very smooth, velvety soft mouthfeel, nice sweet candy like finish. I just wish I had a few more bottles of this well done lager."
"This beer is just beautiful. A deep coppery garnet with a light brown head, I probably should have taken a photo. The aroma is initially roasted with hints of chocolate, but as it warms it changes to nutty with hints of toffee and spicey yeast. The flavor is clean and malty with a lingering yeast flavor on my tongue. This beer is excellent, a special thanks goes out to my friend who bought this for me for xmas."
"Thanks go to MinnesotaHuge for this Spretzer Seasonal Winter Brew. Sehr Gut Sir!!"
"A solid beer all the way, big and roasty with plenty of juice to warm you up. Easy to enjoy, I just really liked this one."
"Drinkability is very solid on this, another great Sprecher offering."
"If you like winter brews, or more malty brews, please look this one up and try it out!"
"Tasted at the Goose Island April Beer Academy. Lots of carbonation in this beer, as it pours a medium-brown color with an off-tan head. The scent isn't huge - perhaps a bit of malt, but nothing more. The taste is a bit hoppy, with only a minimal amount of malt presence, especially for a bock. A bit thin and chalky for my taste, and nothing much more."
"I was a bit disappointed with the body of this beer. I was hoping for something fuller, but it was pretty light & on the thin side. Carbonation was dead on, just lively enough for my tastes. A nice winter offering, pretty straightforward in it's approach though."
"Oh man, this is the shizznat! Had this on tap at Old Chicago during their ""Christmas Mini-Tour"" and have bought a few four packs of this recently...despite its mid-October born-on date and Sprecher's recommendation that you consume their beer within 120 days, this still tastes great. Those of you familiar with the style of winter seasonals will feel right at home with this beer in its dark color, heavy-but-not-a-stout taste, and unique spice flavor. This beer is a spectacular entry in the style and is the only one of two (Goose Island being the other) that I have liked enough to purchase a four-pack of...another good point about this beer is the 16 oz bottles. Try and snatch up some of this while you can so that you don't have to wait until next year, because it's cheap (at least in the midwest, Sprecher is from Wisconsin) and good. Highly recommended."
"I would have given this a better appearance but I had no option other than drinking it out of the bottle so I can't give an accurate rating. As far as everything else goes, this was a fantastic winter brew! There was a nice full body of spices that balanced perfectly. I have been waiting all winter to try this local favorite and I sure am glad that I did. This is not my favorite winter beer, but the smoothness makes it drinker-friendly!"
"Chestnut brown, creamy cafe au lait head. Warming goodness in the way of malt on the nose and in the mouth. Not too heavy and not too light. Just right for the Winter here in the midwest. A good dose of dark chocolate, caramel, malted, chewy candy candy chimes in throughout. A solid, fresh, and rather tasty seasonal."
"Nice rich brown color with a real nice creamy tan-colored ead.Smell was swwet and almost cookie-dough like,taste was roasted and burnt tasting with some caramel sweetness.Sprecher makes some really good beers and this is just another good one,will be trying there doppell bock later today."
"clear, slightly watery finish."
"A tasty winter brew....almost a cross between a dunkel and a bock..almost a tad thin to be a bock but it has some of its sweeter characteristics...Nose is sweet malt alll the way....It is a reddish amber in color...the taste is roasted grains and sweet malt....finishes with a bock like feel...body is about medium..definitely think enough to drink a few but not too thin...I like this beer but have had better bocks...It is very good though.."
"This brew has a clear deep dark mahogony appearance. Throws out a creamy light brown head that has decent retention. It eventually does recede to a thin film, but still laces rather effectively. Malt, toffee and caramel all mix in on the nose. Toffee, toasted malt, burnt caramel and some slight hop/roasted bitterness come to play on the palate. This is not as sweet as most bocks, but to me, rather, it tastes almost like a hybrid of bock and scwarzbier. I thought this was a dopplebock, but it's not as thick and chewy as a dopple, so I was probably wrong. This beer won a gold at the 2002 World Cup in the European-Style/Muncher Dunkel category. It's a smooth beer and tasty. Body is almost full."
"Rich pour, dark copper brown with a 1/4 inch yellowish head. Really, very little aroma, some sense of sweetness. Medium-bodied with assertive malt, somewhat Dunkel-like with lots of nutty qualities. Proceeds toward a bit of a buttery diacetyl and ends gradually with little sense of distinct hopping. Becomes creamier mid mouth, with a little bit of corn husk qualities in the big aftertaste. Not a bad brew here, not as sweet as some Bocks, but I'm not a major fan. I'll take the Black Bavarian..."
"Pours a clear dark reddish-brown in color with a tan head. Aroma consists of burnt malt, caramel, coffee and picks up a plum or cherry scent as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Roasted malt and coffee tones dominate. Finish builds on roasted malt flavor and a subtle sweet fruit and spice flavor rounds things out. An enjoyable and rather hearty full-bodied Munich Bock. Great for having on hand to share with company during the Winter season and throughout Spring as things thaw out."
"Just a great winter brew. One of my favorite bocks (my all-time favorite until I encountered Elysian's Pandora's Bock)."
"Absolutely fantastic beer.  This is my first review, and I had to make it Sprecher Winter.  Understated dried fruit flavors, with a richness that is perfect for winter."
