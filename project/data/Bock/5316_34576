3.15,-15.8,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Taste, has that lager yeast thing going for it first and foremost, not my favorite thing about the beer, kind of a peaty red malt aftertaste in the mouthfeel comes later. Very herbal. Toffee. Tea. Crumpets. A little chewy, but at the end of the day it was a bock, and I just have some bias against them, even the great ones I'm just not down with, I think Sam Adams Chocolate Bock is wonderful (which most do not) so take my review with a grain of salt if you're a bock guy. I think this beer is good enough for people making a gateway step, the alcohol and yeast are just little detractors for me.","Beerandraiderfan","Nov 19, 2011"

3.97,6.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The glass welcomes an amber-tinted light brown capped by a quickly shy bit of off-bright foam. My nose is hit by a .357 Magnum shot of caramel, coffee, toffee (it's fun to rhyme!), oak, and pecans. I'm glad it's fun to rhyme, 'cause it's the coffee and toffee, runnin' 'round as the Offee twins, wanted dead or alive (they still ride), that come crashin' into Tasty Town. I don't know who named the place, but who the hell cares? I mean, there's only a handful o' residents, anyway. A good amount of lace comes rollin' 'cross the glass boulevard as the Offee twins proceed to ransack the town. Or, at least, that's what the sensationalist press wants us to believe: In truth, the Twins are cleanin' up the town, gettin' rid o' the nastier elements of society. Unsurprisingly, a clean, though decidedly Twin-infused finish results, the proper end to the smooth ride the townsfolk all witnessed out their windows. As they leave, the people of Tasty Town all glare at the sunset before them, hoping that the Twins return sooner rather than later. Only time will tell, folks...","TMoney2591","Apr 13, 2010"

Aroma is dark bread crust maltiness with a tinge of orangey hoppiness. Flavor is nutty and bready with a very significant hop presence. A little caramel, a little candied orange, some cocoa powder, and some roasted malt. All the flavors blend together nicely to make a very tasty (although not exactly bock-ish) beer.

3.53,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Looks good in my shaker glass, a mahogany brown with a thick, foamy head. Slight nutty malt smell from the brew. Good fresh taste of nutty malt with some grassy hops underneath. A little malt dominated but I like the balance. In my opinion, they got the levels of carbonation right, and a little heft to the mouth feel. Goes down smooth and I could drink plenty of these. In fact, I just might.","RunDWP","Feb 23, 2009"
3.32,-11.2,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"This beer pours a clear dark amber color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes within second into almost no lacing. The aroma is of molasses, and caramelized malt. It smells more like a Scotch Ale than a Bock. The taste is like the aroma. It is nice, but very one dimensional. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with way too much carbonation. Overall, this is an easily forgettable beer.","KarlHungus","Feb 12, 2009"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pretty nice beer with a lovely maltiness that is just right. Pours a dark copper with a nice head that sticks around as a cap. Smells firmly malty with toffee and some earthy hops. The taste has more of that firm malt. Nutty and toffee-like while maintaining a nice dry profile. Delicious. Soft and creamy mouthfeel and quite drinkable.

3.31,-11.5,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Bottle/Recipe number 01. Purchased six pack. Pours a deep copper color with a thick off-white head. Head settles down halfway through the beer but still a good amount of foam lacing ends up on the glass. There's some malts and fruits in the aroma and an overall fresh air kind of smell which isn't necessarily bad. First off theres a hint of a sweet fruity flavor, kind of floral with a smooth caramel maltiness following. Some brown sugar, which could be a hint of spicy hops mixed in but not much. Very clean. A mild caramel flavor lurks in the aftertaste. The label refers to this as ""easy drinking"" and they aren't kidding. It's really almost too easy drinking and smooth. Not the strongest flavor but overall I like this beer, it's quite solid. Also it's not expensive either so could be a great candidate for a session brew.","changeup45","Jul 12, 2008"
3.16,-15.5,4,3,3,4,3,"Cream-colored head quickly faded off the glass to a ring. Good retention of the ring but otherwise scant head. Constantly rising carbonation visible in the gorgeous deep garnet colored brew. Aromas are very appealing, malts, spices and hints of milk chocolate. Flavors are bold and very unlike the aromas. Notably sour like a Flemish ale, sweet with candy sugars, tart fruits, caramel malt. Long tart finish. Unusual and bock-like. Mouthfeel is buttery, full and the carbonation shows vitality. But I must admit this caught me off-guard and I would not quickly recommend it.","thekevlarkid","Jun 29, 2008"

The hops give an interesting hint of grass and citrus, it reminds me of a sauvignon blanc. Taste starts with a slight malty sweetness. Hits you in the middle of the mouth with a little bit of the citrus/grassy flavors and finishes slightly metallic. The beer has medium body and decent carbonation. The beer is easy to drink considering the 6.4% abv, but the metallic after taste lingers and is a little unpleasant. This is a decent beer with some interesting complexities, but the metallic finish/aftertaste kind of threw me off.","SeanRCole","May 18, 2008"

Retention is solid but the head is scant and thin. Aromatics arise to the nares quite nicely with caramel and nutty malt tones moderately kilned malts bring me on a nice soothingly sweet ride balanced with a roasted caramel and soft milk chocolate note as well. Fruit is evident ripened with tame alcohol edges in the finish I get a touch of tartness and herbal wet grass hop tones. Flavor is balanced between tart fruit and roasted malt a wonderful combo, caramel and mild chocolate reign supreme really finishes heavy with roasted nuts and herbal hops with the caramel really coating the palate during the whole experience. Excellent drinking bock beer a bit heavier in alcohol than the typical lager yet in the same range of drinkability. Mouthfeel is full with slightly sticky edges left over from the malt bill, carbonation settles easy with each sip yet remains crisp and clean enough with each sip to reach that smooth lagering quality that we know and love.

Smells of grass and malts with an undercurrent of caramel to make things a bit interesting. Tastes of malts and sweets with a small hop presence that keeps things focused.

3.73,-0.3,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Overall: I rather liked it. Even though the alcohol is a little high for a session beer, that's how I would classify this.","Chuggnutt","Jul 21, 2007"
3.57,-4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Orange to yellow in color, it has a thin head that doesn't last very long. For it's ABV, it drinks pretty well with a modest array of flavors from citrus zang to doughy malt. Neither is overpowering though. Pretty decent bock.","DoubleJ","Jun 18, 2007"
3.42,-8.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Originally reviewed April 26, 2007. 12 Oz Bottle. Bottling 01. A munich-roasty caramel and banana lager aroma, cold and clean. Faint almonds and lime juice. Pours a bubbly even, nicely clear amber-orange, with a silky soft creamy head of ivory. Flavor a flattened malt sugar and lightly barnyardy grain texture. Moderately sweet, thus reasonably drinkable. Somewhere in the middle of the road, clean with a very restricted hop kiss for balance. Malt character and depth reigned in and could have gone more, but then it would have been a Marzen. A nicely drinkable, mildly flavored lager.","CharlesDarwin","Jun 17, 2007"
3.65,-2.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Acquired from my secret bunny Boolshot. Thanks for sending this my way. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my standard shaker ""pint "" glass. Appears a clear amber color with barely half an inch of off-white head. No lacing to speak of. Smells of caramel malts, nuts, and raisins. Tastes of mildly sweet caramel malts, followed by a slight hop bitterness. The malts certainly dominate the hops though, as they should. Medium in both body and carbonation with a little alcohol burn on the throat in the finish. Very easy drinking. Well done.","ClockworkOrange","Apr 25, 2007"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"This Limited Edition Lager is a well-crafted beer that doesn't deserve to be 'one and done'. It looks like Full Sail feels the same since they've decided to brew it again (original recipe intact) in Winter '08.

3.59,-4,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served up with a thin bubbly and tan head, red-brown in color. The smell is mainly of sweet floral hops. The taste is pretty bland up front - followed by a small kick of hops in the aftertaste, but not much. I found it pretty refreshing. Not any taste of alcohol so it's pretty drinkable.","kdoc8","Apr 05, 2007"

3.77,0.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Not a bad beer, but nothing essential either. A competent, easy to drink but unremarkable beer, like many I've had from Full Sail. It's a nice, undemanding malty beer that is turining out to be a nice after-work beer. I'm glad I tried it, but I won't go out of my way for it again.","woemad","Mar 12, 2007"

Anything would have tasted good to me including my dogs frozen urine. But, all things considered, it was quenching and tasty, although I think it could have even passed for a lager.

2.7,-27.8,2,2,3,2,3.5,"Pours a bright transparent copper-red color and is topped with an unimpressive layer of foam. The head as full of large sudsy bubbles which sound like Rice Crispies cereal as they quickly loose shape. The result is a lace-less, headless beer for the remainder. Smell is mild with light, almost lemony hops and grain. Taste is watery with a HINT of carmel, chocolate and a light hop aftertaste. This brew is way too thin and watery for my liking.","dhilltop2000","Feb 14, 2007"
3.03,-19,3.5,3,3,3,3,"A light copper body with a head that doesn't hold up very long. Caramel is present in the aroma with a sweet scent.

3.95,5.6,3,3,4.5,4.5,4,"Mouth: Excellent flavor surprises me after the shortcomings of the aroma. Lots of brown sugar and malts concluded by a warmth rising from the swallow through the exhale. An odd mouthfeel, like that left behind a medicated lozenge. Almost an oily coat around the mouth that lingers long after swallow - somehow this is not unpleasant. Hops show through in the back w/ a nice bitterness that lingers after the beer has left the mouth. Fruit flavors - maybe plum. Extremely easy to drink - pretty high alcohol w/ no noticeable alcoholic flavors. Strong carbonation combines w/ the cough syrup feel to make a very unique mouthfeel. Very interesting beer.","clickpush","Jan 15, 2007"
