There's also a small amount of lacing. The brew smells like maple, caramel, molasses and some sweet malt. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's also a slight bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and smooth with moderate carbonation. This is the second Hinterland beer I've tried, and I've liked them both. I'll definitely try more of their other beers! $9.99 a 4-pack.","bluejacket74","Jun 30, 2012"

The nose suggests a myriad of dark flavors- molasses and bitter chocolate predominate, with notes of raisin. The flavor is big, bold, and straightforward- sweet dark malts, with touches of diacetyl, grain, and dark chocolate, finishing with bitter notes of espresso and herbs. Mouthfeel is full is round, drying a bit, though the maple syrup that I feel contributed to the drying did impart a very mild impression of syrup in the aftertaste.

There is a light lingering hop after taste, but let me emphasize 'light'. After a while this opened up to some more flavors but beyond that there was not much to taste from this Maple Bock, not even the maple!

4.48,20.8,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O- This is truly a great bock. There are only two negative things I could say which are both fairly minor. First, the carbonation is a bit much, but this can also be fixed by a slightly harder pour to drive off the excess CO2. Second, it wasn't as ""maplely"" as I would of thought, then again that can also be attributed to brewing skill depending on the brewers intention.
