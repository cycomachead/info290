review_text
"Dark brown color with nice khaki head and good lacing. Mild malt, fruity smell, but very weak on flavor. Smooth and drinkable but just not much taste, guess this is why it was retired?"
"I wish I could explain the flavors and smells and whatnot, but this one does not say anything to me other then Sam Adams Winter. Average, forgettable, but you don't feel bad for drinking it. Easy drink to start a night."

"Not sure if true to style, but perfect on taste"
"O: Not my style. I find this one too sweet, reminds me of sweet corn with syrup."

"O- a very richly flavored Bock with a nice velvety finish, a good malt profile, but it needs some hop interest, even for a low hop style i want something!"

"I have had this a few time and at least twice it was a touch skunky. It's a decent beer but it has a little too much roast and bitterness for a bock."

"M - very smooth, not much carbonation but I think it is intentional. Heavy but very enjoyable"

"I poured this beer into my tumbler expecting a killer product that I usually get from Anchor. The beer was almost black and poured a nice tan head that was indeed beautiful. The beer also had killer lacing. One sip and my wife and I instantly poured it out. It was terrible. So bad I cannot tell you what it tasted like cause I refused to take another hit. No way will I ever buy this again."

"Overall - A nice interpretation of a German Bock. Don't get me wrong, this is no Ayinger Celebrator, but the beer very drinkable. When comparing this lager to complex German Dopplebocks, however, it comes off as a bit lacking. P.S. I don't understand why The Brothers rated it so poorly."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a dark red-mahogany amber with a big two finger finger khaki head with good retention and pillowy lacing. Nice aroma of sweet caramel malt, dark fruit, a little earthy oxidation. Flavor starts with caramel, slightly toaste malt, dark fresh and dried friut, tapering off to a drier brown bread and toasty malt finish with a light hop bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Aroma and flavor are classic bock, but the flavor drops off to a lighter, starker malt and hop finish that are not as well supported by by the richer caramel malt flavor of the start. This is a discontinued variety and this bottle may have some modest age to it, which may have affected the flavor. Still a nice, but unremarkable bock; pleasant but not in competition with the traditional ones. Still glad I got to try it before it goes archival."

"O: A decently made bock, but not exciting in any way. This shouldn't be old, so I think it might be the brown malts giving the hint of cardboard. A solid option, but not one that I'll particularly miss now that it's been retired."
""
"Overall: Slightly above average and simple bock. Tasty, but nothing really jumped out at me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is just average. It didn't wow me and it didn't disappoint me, it's just average with nothing really to it."

"Dark ruby red with a brown tint colored. An quarter inch thick layer of khaki colored foam caps off the top. Brussels lacing. The smell of a bit of amber malt is faint. The mouth is creamy and very smooth,but a bit thin for my taste. I get some amber malt on the front of the palate and then some pine like hop bitterness and the sweetness of the malt on the fade."

"This is apparently the last year this classic brew will be produced. A pity. Possibly my last round, poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. A dark reddish or coppery brown brew with an outstanding milkshake-thick tan head. Aroma is sublime and includes a gorgeous noble hop spice, assertive for the style, against a caramel and boozy raisin backdrop. Yes, I detect some booze on the nose, which is interesting. Not a super thick brew but semi-chewy with an oily mouthfeel, quite crisp and smooth. Tastes of caramel and brown bread with a hint of molasses, but the malts almost take a back seat to the spicy, earthy, herbal hops, with hints of licorice, green leaf, grape, and a noble floral perfume. Maybe more hopping than is typical for a bock but it works. Finishes rather dry, with a sour malt/toffee aftertaste and a mild alcohol burn. I have a soft spot for this brew, one of the first true craft beers I tried years ago. Playing a funeral dirge as I type this. Over The Hills and Far Away by Zeppelin. RIP."

"O - an average beer, but not even close to what a bock should be"
""
"Overall, a solid take on the style, a bit sweet but the right flavors are there."
""
""
""
"Snack on some roasted, salted pistachios as you sip this one."
""
""
"Overall- Pretty much just an above average beer. I do think if the mouthfeel were a bit thicker and some of the bitterness and phenolic characteristics were smoother that this would be a much better beer. Still, worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For me this is a nice Bock. I'm not a fan of Porters and Stouts but this stops short of the, for me, overly roasted flavors of those styles. But it gives me a nice brew to enjoy in cold weather."
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer, but a bit confused for a bock. Narragansett's is much better."
"O: This beer is quite an enigma. I liked it overall. I recommend trying it and really focusing on the different smells and flavors - it's a trip."
""
"o: A highly drinkable bock, not quite as tasty as some, but very easy-going. A fine lunch or dinner beer, went nicely with our Polish kielbasa and potato salad. Also, a good session brew. Based on other reviews I have seen here, mine may have aged very well."

""
""
""
""
"Overall, a somewhat oxidized, odd interpretation of the style. I think a very fresh pour would be much better, but as I have it, this is a below average bock that needs to thicken up and get a little heavier in flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a particularly great beer and definitely the worst of the Anchor beers I have tried thus far sadly. There is a strong helping of roasted malts that could have been toned down somewhat but the fruity undertones were pleasant enough, but not enough to save the beer as a whole."
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. There are plenty of better bocks out there, but this one may satisfy you until one of those comes along."

"A bit too sweet overall with a persistent burnt fruit flavor that becomes distractingly off-putting. Not a terrible beer, but it has some issues that prevent it from being better than average."
""
"O: nothing wrong with this brew, but it's certainly unlike any other bock i've tried. in fact, it has so much old ale/stout/porter going on that i feel like i'd just as soon drink an actual stout or porter. it might even be a decent gateway beer toward the stout and porter ... either way, i'm glad i tried it but probably won't purchase any more when i finish this six-pack."
""
"Moderately heavy beer that drinks just a tad slick at times. Easy carbonation. This beer is heavy on the chocolate. Big dry chocolate powder makes up the bulk. Chalky-dry, charred toast, mild sugary sweetness fleets through, but then finishes a bit muddled. Not sure if they'e intent was a dry roasted Bock, but that's what I got. Not your typical for the style, and not one I'd revisit too often if this is the norm."
""
"There is something unpleasant about this, after the promising initial taste. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Barons Marketplace in San Diego."
""
"Overall not a Bock that is going to blow you away nor would it really offend you. If you're into the style give it a shot."
""
""
""
""
"Roasted caramel coffee with raisons and some spice...all well balanced with a slight hop character . Nice!"
"Overall. Much more chocolate than expected which was a nice shock. Well balanced and still very drinkable with a medium body. Best drank in the fall."

""
"12oz single bottle from ""Trader Joes"" Salem OR. $1.50 Dark brown beer almost mahogany with a large tightly bubbled tan head.That turns ""rocky"". Toasty,malty aromas..some dark fruitiness. a little nutty. Nice. Liquorice,treacle,bitter crab apple,cream and slightly sour in a good way. Like a dopplebock lite. Nice smooth creamy palate. Nice beer."
""
"O- A good beer, mostly a regular bock but with some roast character. Well made."
""
"O- My review is all over the map - just like the beer. It's not Anchor's best effort, mostly a one and done beer."
"Picked this up on a whim in a mixed sixer and am glad I did. Pours a dark, opaque brown with a lingering tan head. Was very carbonated when poured. Very little in the aroma. Taste is rich malty bread, like hearty toast. Not too much sweetness. Incredibly easy drinker that remains tasty from start to finish."
""
"Easy to drink Bock. Great style. DONT AGREE WITH BROS. This beer is a solid hit."
""
""
""
"75 = C"
""
""
""
"O- Rich and flavorful, quite sweet. I could take a little more balance from hops though."
""
"A really well done bock. Big, bold malty flavors with a pleasant herbal hop character to round it out."
""
"O- It held up surprisingly well over two years. This beer is most similar to Brekle's Brown, which I do prefer to this one. The smell is the nicest part of it for me. Taste is a little less interesting, but a good beer for the abv."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Starts off well enough, but that lemon sourness is a bit funky, and doesn't necessarily mesh with the strong bock character this beer presents. Still I enjoyed it well enough, and the lemon character isn't a complete deal breaker. In my index of future buys, I'd jot this down in the probably category."
""
"O: A very pleasant beer, smooth and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance was dark brown with a healthy tan head. Nice roasted malt flavor with hints of molasses and caramel. Creamy and thick with light carbonation. Great representation of the style. Sorry I only bought one."
""
""
"O: gotta say, this was better than I expected....a bit more hoppy-bitter than necessary....I would have one again, on draft...."
""
""

""
""
"Overall- what a surprise i wasn't expecting this from anchorbrewing at all. It makes me look foraward to spring it makes me look forward to my next bottle, and i must say that this is a very unique and distinctly ""San Francisco"" tasting beer. It could pair well with sea food ( clam chowder For sure ) smoked meats and i could see it going with fruit based desserts for some odd reason."
"O: Pretty bold for a bock, but I welcome it! Very drinkable, and reasonably priced. It's not going to the top of my all-time favorite list, but I'll definitely pick up a couple more the next time I'm at the store. A solid contender from a good brewery."
"This is a very good beer, slightly expensive and honestly for the price there are some better bock beers available. Do not write this beer off your list, also do not write it on your “must have” list. Good and strong contender, but not as good as the goat wants you to think."

"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I didn't expect much, but to my delight this was really a good bock. The maltiness was complex and intense. The dark fruit notes are most impressive, but meshes well with the caramel, chocolate, and faint roast. The carbonation was spot on, and the drinkability was smooth throughout. This is definitely a beer worth trying."
"not sure why THE BROS rated it as low as they did; i kind of get what he's saying, but that can be said of so many others. i like the style, and while it isnt the best in class, i think it's better than some of Anchor's others.... just wish there were a higher abv ! !"
"Pours an opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is very earthy with roasted malt, spice, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly sour flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that reminds me a lot of the Our Special Ale series, just without so much of the holiday spice flavor."

"Wow, this is a delicious bock."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass date of 2FG. This pours a dark brown with a large tan head which has good retention and leaves a lacing. The smells are of various malts, toffee and caramel. The feel is medium, high carbonination even after the massive head. The taste is good enough, you get a little bitterness from the hops and roasted malts, plenty of malts and caramel."

"Notes: Rather an interesting bock it's decently drinkable. Cheers."

"O: A well balanced bock. Would drink again. Great with cheddar."

""
"No real complaints here, just nothing to get overly excited about. A solid beer."

"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed pilsner, the beer is a dark, deep, ruby-brown coloring with a tall, foamy, thin bodied head that starts around a solid inch and settles into a lasting quarter of an inch. Decent cling left behind as the head settles, too. Aromas of old world fruit sweetness, including dates, raisins, plum, and fig, on a bready, ""thick"" presence in the backbone. Flavors of rich, sweet character all over the tongue on a slightly watery, thin body. Roasty notes along all of the dark, earthy, and sweet flavors. This one is rich. Plum and fig again are present, with a touch of molasses bringing a dark and sugary touch to the sweetness. Very powerful on the sweet senses of the palate, and the body and backbone is unable to balance it out. Darkly sweet aftertaste, with a slick, lingering, cloying finish. This one has an overbearing flavor profile that makes it tough to drink en masse."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a medium dark brown with smidges of off white foam. All malty smell, sweet caramel. Malty taste with a background hop that pokes out slightly. Very sweet. Lighter carbonation. Pretty good for a bock, but rather unremarkable amongst the other styles. Not a huge bock fan admittedly."
""
""
""
"O - this was promising out of the gate but became a little too unbalanced and unfocussed, it has some of the halmarks of a bock but for some reason it just doesn't come together enough, a rare average result from Anchor"
"OVerall don't mind it, but probably not what I look for in this style."
""
"On tap poured into a stemmed glass. The color is quite dark, like roasted chestnuts, but it still lets a good bit of light through. Head is sort of sudsy with large and tiny bubbles that dissipate quickly and leave little to no discernable lacing. I took a strong whiff of this and got almost nothing out of it at first; it was served maybe a tad cold, but even with it warming, the smells were tough to pull out of this brew. I was able to get some caramel sugar and baked bread with some orange rind hops in the mix. The taste was quite malt forward; reminded me of slightly charred bread and almost no caramel sweetness. There was a bigger than expected hop profile as well; lots of citrus with a long, dry, bitter finish that lingers and lingers. Mouthfeel was clean, dry, and a little watery. Overall, I think the hops were maybe a little too big and took out the malt backbone. Not a bad beer, but just not something I would choose often."
""
"not sure why I didn't expect much from Anchors Bock as I like pretty much everything I've had from them. worth a try for sure, yet another welcome addition to Alberta"
"It's stylistically good, while being perfectly appropriate for the surroundings. Great stuff, Anchor."
""
""
"Price Point - $1.50/12oz single"
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. One inch head of a tan color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of hops, hint of syrup, slight floral, and slight pale malt. Fits the style of a Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an low-to-average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, slight hops, and a hint of syrup. Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, feel, body, and blend. I was quite pleasantly surprised at the quality of the beer. I would recommend it as a great session beer."
"Taste follows the nose with a light and smooth bock delivery. Not very sweet for the style and with a rather ale-like delivery for the style as well. Offers a fuller feel than expected, though not as clear and concise either. Touch of chocolate and muddled caramel and cherry on the finish. Nice beer though argueably an odd bock at times."
""
"Overall if I ever need to seek out a bock I may consider getting another."
""
""
"Pours a barely transparent dark cinnamon brown with a thick and rather persistent fine-bubbled beige head. Strong, malty aroma has an overtone of wet grass and hints of caramel and cinnamon. Flavor has a malty core plus a strong grassy note and tones of wood plus hints of caramel and cinnamon. Did they use grass clippings for hops? (But seriously, folks.) Still, it is a drinkable and enjoyable beer with a strongly hoppy but not bitter finish and a good amount of body and fizz."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pilsener glass, bottled 1/18/2012. Pours crystal clear reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense tan head with fantastic retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some decent lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of light chocolate, biscuit, toasted malt, apricot, fig, raisin, caramel, molasses, and herbal hops. Nice aromas, with a good amount of balance and decent strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, biscuit, raisin, fig, prune, molasses, toasted malt, and herbal hops. Nice balance of flavors with a decent amount of robustness; and no cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a slight creamy and very smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming present at all on the finish. Overall this is a very nice and enjoyable bock. Nice toasted flavors with good balance, and very smooth to drink. A nice session beer candidate."

"Overall I liked it, but it wasn't anything to get crazy over."
""
""

"Overall- A good representation of a bock from Anchor. I enjoyed the fig and raisin flavours in this brew. Its nice to see a variation of the style. Definitely worth a go."
"Love Anchor, but not a fan of this one."
"Pretty good - not sure how this ranks among other Bocks, but it goes down nicely. The rich flavour makes it a pleasant brew to sip on of an evening. Worth sampling if you have the chance. Roll on summer!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Just lacking and a bit strange all around, one of my least favorite Anchor products."
""
"C"

""
"Come now! So many harsh reviews for such a charming little beer. When was the last time you opened a bock that had a sparkling mahogany color and a massive, everlasting, orange-tinted head? All the malt you need for the evening will be in your glass, with the hops properly stuffed into the back row with only small handful allowed to poke up their pathetic little heads, pleading for air. Back, I say! A mellow, pleasant springtime find. Stop with the complaining about what this isn't and enjoy it for what it is."
"I'm normally not a big bock fan myself--I find the characteristic sweetness to be cloying more often than not--but this bock is so well balanced and has such a delicious complexity on the back end that I can't help but laud it. Having tried a large number of Anchor offerings, I think it's close to criminal how their darker beers are so overshadowed by their more widely available flagship brews. This is a bock that embraces porter-like aspects, and as such moves right near the top of my bock list. An excellent beer regardless of style."
"A quite tasty bock beer, seasonally perfect, and just plain enjoyable, uber alles."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark brown with a medium brown lasting head, good lacing. Aroma of toasted caramel malt, yeast, dark fruity esters and light hops. Taste is sweet toasted caramel malt, yeast, some light chocolate flavors, dark fruits and lightly hopped. Palate is a medium body with light carbonation and a smooth mouth feel. Finish is sweet toasted caramel malt some notes of cacao, dark fruits, yeast ending is light hops bitterness for balance. Overall a good tasty, enjoyable and nicely balanced brew."
""
"O: Not your traditional bock, reminds me of a brown ale with lager characteristics. Not too bad, but nothing special either."
"Overall (3.5): This is a decent bock, and much darker than I’m used to. This one is kind of like a porter brewed with lager yeast, in my opinion. It’s a nice, malty brew as the weather warms, but it’s not my favorite and generally not what I’d reach for to scratch that malt-seeking itch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is good. Dark appearance, medium carbonation, nice frothy head, but not much in terms of lacing. Nose is very earth-tone-y with some sweet and bitter components. Flavor is woody, and bitter. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: OK, but nothing special."
"not my fave from Anchor B. Co. but to each their own."
"Pours an opaque dark brown with mahogany edges, foamy light tan head fades leaving foam all over the glass. Aroma of dark fruits, chocolate and rich toasty malt. Taste is also very rich malty, some milky sweetness, a bit of dark fruit, light roasty finish. Very easy to drink, Medium body, soft carbonation. However, Tastes more like a Brown Ale than a Bock. Very tasty, but just not getting the ""Bock"" feel."
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a bock. Unique, well balanced, and tasty."
""
""
"Overall this a pretty tasty and interesting beer. Doesn't taste like other bocks out there but is good in its own right."
"Not a strictly traditional bock, but where it strays is an improvement over most in my opinion."
"T: Lots of toasted malt, day old coffee, a touch of brown sugar and some light earthy hops on the finish with some more malt."
"It poured a luscious ruby-caramel color with nice foam retention. There’s a sweet caramel-cola malt aroma and a rich malty-chocolaty-caramel flavor to this brew. Real pleasing. The beer itself is well-rounded and holds up even as it warms. I could see having this for dessert as it’s substantial and filling (without being heavy or a malt bomb)."
"Overall: B+"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an understated, subtle and rich bock. Excellent offering from Anchor."
"Overall - The flavor is well balanced and it tastes very good! My only (minor) complaint about the flavor is that it is a little too malt heavy. Otherwise, it's a great seasonal beer that is worth checking out!"
""
"It is a decent bock beer but very sweet."
""
"Overall a very nice bock."
""

""
""
"O-A nice Bock, one of the best I've had. More proof that Anchor has a hard time making a poor beer."
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed the Anchor Steam, Porter as well as the Christmas Ale but this one is just not up to par with the rest of their brews. This left me with a odd, unfavorable flavor on my pallet and I will not purchase it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"It looked pretty good out of the bottle, but one whiff was enough to tell me that it wasn’t. Heavy diacetyl, fake caramel/toffee, and a weird tart bitterness on the palate was more than enough to turn me away from this one. I’ll try another on the chance that it was a bad bottle, but if not, this is a truly unfortunate beverage."
""
"O: Enjoyed this one a lot initially, though as I made my way further through it my enthusiasm dropped off a bit. Still a slightly above average beer, and recommended to try."
"im not a huge bock guy, and for me, this is as good a a bick can be. pours the most sensationalm dark cherrywood color with a goldenrod hued head all foamy and tall. sticks around too above the ruby glow. smells like a malt bomb, but appropriate for spring. flavor is bitter and mildly alcoholic, behind a nice camamel/amber malt backbone. it the bitterness hops at the end or just dank old malt, hard to tell. funky almost, old world, british, and thick. mouthfeel is excellent, full bodied but not filling, creamy, and as carbonated as it need to be. great great bock. i would buy this one again for sure. damn"
"Notes: Very satisfying. It was balanced and understated."
""
"O: Hmmm - not sure how I feel about this one. Not like other beers in this style that I've had... but had some redeeming qualities (for me, I liked the dark, hefty feel). At the price point ($7 for a six) - not a bad purchase... but probably wouldn't buy again"
""
""
"Give it a try though, you might just like it. Cheers!"
"o: Tastes like a souped up shwartzbier rather than a bock. It's good overall but as a bock, it's meh."
"o: A good bock beer. I've had many worse lagers. Anchor seems to make their lagers have more characteristics of an ale than a lager. And that is always good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting take on the style. Satisfying but I could only have one in a sitting."
""
"Overall: Could benefit from a little more character and audacity of flavor. Malt is what you see and what you get."

"Body-Especially for the alcohol content, it’s quite thick and rich. I’d almost venture into syrupy territory. I don’t particularly like this, but I was tired when I tasted it so that may have been part of it. It really is quite sweet, and I don’t think I would want it again. There are too many other dark beers I have liked more. Just not my thing, not to say it's a bad beer, though."
"O: I'm conflicted how rating this beer. While I think it was a good beer and certainly a quality beer, I just can't call this a legitimate bock. While it had some characteristics, the sweet and bitter hop tastes make this a hybrid beer and not a true bock."
"Pours a true, dark-tea brown. A decent, 1/4"" tan head stays around. Nice to look at. Smell is clean & crisp. Syrupy malts, toffee.. Taste is a blend of perfumy, green bitters, and nutty, roasted coffee. A nice semi-sweet chocolate finish gives way to bocky dryness. Feel is a bit ""thin."" A favoirte example of the style, imo - it's tasty!"
"Served from bottle into a Unibroue La Fin du Monde tulip. Poured a massively dark brown with a four finger fluffy light tan head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, and bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I was surprised at how one-note this one was on the flavor and aroma, but somehow it was able to work quite well. The bready note mixed with the dark fruit presence really worked well together. A definite must try for any Bock fan out there, and worth trying for those who are not."
"Overall: For a bock, it feels like it is just a tad bit too boozy. The extreme nature of the malts makes for a very enjoyable drink. Besides that alcohol note and the fact that it only slightly resembles a true bock, this beer is very good. Will pick it up again some day."
"To me this is a good brown ale even though this site calls it a bock. I don't pick up any bock styling. Actually with the dubbel asspect that I tatse, to me, this falls more inline with a dubbel."
"Overall, I find this a decent brew, with lively light flavors. However, it's the ""light"" part of that sentence that gives me the most pause. While the flavors are well-balanced and delicious, they are also weak in staying power, and in fact seem to fade quickly as the beer is consumed and the tongue gets used to the taste. I would have preferred a slightly more potent bock, but do still give this one credit for its good taste."
"O - This is a nice bock beer. I'm glad I finally got around to buy this."
"This is a great looking brew that drinks very well and has good flavors. It was a bit disappointing that the mouthfeel ended up being a bit thin though. No biggie, still a very good bock brew."
"Likely that I'm suffering from an old bottle here, but can only review what is in front of me. Not a good bock, and not a good beer. I likely won't finish the single bottle of it that I purchased - and I rarely dump."
"Full flavored but not all that heavy. Some old ale notes in there. Burnt sugar and earthy hops, say other reviews; I can see that. I don't like licorice, and this is far from other dunkelbocks I've tasted, but a good antidote to hop overdose."
"O - Overall, I can see how this one is a little polarising, but I think it works as quite a pleasant beer, either on its own or as a session."
"Overall this is the second time I have had this beer. First time I was less than impressed probably because I had several ""higher caliber"" beers that day. Today I am enjoying it a lot more that I am not comparing to something else, which is really important I think when ""rating beers"". This brew is not quite traditional or mind-blowing, but quite nice in its own right. Well done from a classic brewer who deserves more credit than it receives in today's ever-growing saturated market."
"O: It's alright, not really sweet enough for a bock. As a bay area native hate to bag on Anchor Steam. This is nowhere near their other offerings."
"O: An interesting twist on dark bock with a hoppy background. Definitely a different take of the style."
"Overall kinda meh, nothing really special, a bit too much on the darker malts and not enough of the wheat aspects, no heavy enough IMO, not enough hops, and that mouth sucking dry feel is just sooo icky."
"Overall: It's like a barley wine and a porter had a baby. Honestly I might've rated it better if it said it was a porter or something, but another style... I have never had a bock like this. Worst Anchor beer I have had and normally I'm a fan."
"The carbonation makes this dark beer rather refreshing."
"Overall: By far Anchor's worst."
"Poured into a wide-mouth tapered pint glass. Large fluffy/foamy head of three fingers that leaves a nice creamy lace for the entire session. Up front there is a nice aroma of earthy hops and toffee. The taste is smooth, chocolate, sweet, toffee, and a faint bitterness of fresh earthy hops. Even notes of spruce or mint seems to sneak in there. The body is medium along with carbonation. An easy drinker that goes down so smooth. I do notice that if you pick this up in the summer it loses that sparkle that makes it a top spring release. I do have to say that it seems a bit off from the style, but I still think it is an extraordinary brew when fresh."
"Not one of my favorite bocks, but I wouldn't refuse this beer after a long day on the tracks."
"M - creamy; perfect carbonation."
"Now I lean in to find out what else is going on with this one and was quite surprised as to how good this was. A rich creamy malty smell was coming off of this one from the very start. Lots of roasted malts coming through with rich nutty tones as well, really quite good I have to say. Huge notes of caramel sugar and a touch of a woody and earthy like quality as well, really a very nice profile here, and classic for the style. The taste was fantastic. Very rich and creamy. I was surprised at how full the body was on this, with a really thick smooth like feel, not the usual crispness you would find, but this was superb. Nice carbonation really allowed the flavors to pop when you tasted it. Rich notes of caramel sugar and roasted malts just dominated the heck out of this one. Really, mellow flavors that could be either a sipper or a session ale, depending on your mood."
"The mouthfeel is also a little bit thinner than I'd like, a bit of thickness would make this just a bit more robust. The drinkability is quite good, as expected. A pretty good bock from Anchor. Not the best ever, but absolutely not worth turning down."
"Overall, great presentation and a decent example of the style."
"O- i'm glad my father bought this so he can expand his world of beer. he had a sip of my KBS and thought it was too chocolaty. baby steps for him"
"Scores: Appearance 3.5/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 3.5/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4/5"
"I really enjoyed the bock, The pour was really nice, the beer was a mahogany color with a tan colored head on it that lasted for the entire duration of having it. The lacing was nice too. The smell was a little bit of an odd one. It was big on malts and some hops but also had some strange little sour aroma going on too. The taste was full of grains. malts and some really nice hops that dry your mouth out after each sip. Quite a nice brew here."
"Taste-Rich and flavorfull, touch of sweet malt and toasted barley, brown sugar, faint chocolate,and some oily hopleaf flavor throughout. Not your typical bock but very flavorfull. A very nice early Spring warmer."
"D - this was ok, not as good as other Anchor beers. I might have to give it another try to see what I think."
"Overall: A drinkable version of a great style of beer. If you are new to Bocks, this is a good place to start, but there are MUCH better bock beers out there to be had. Cheers!!"
"""I'll have one of those Anchor Bocks, please."""
"Very complex and hearty, yet very drinkable."
"Finish: A B-11 lingers"
"Had a powerful craving for a bock beer which is unfortunate because there isn't a lot to choose from outside of early spring. Not unlike a brown ale, this is a little higher in alcohol and easier to drink than many of the brown ales out today. Nicely carbonated with hints of brown sugar and a nice balance of sweet malts, a bready slightly bitter finish. This is the type of beer I imagine they would drink in Buffalo around the turn of the century. The type of thing you can have instead of lunch and then go back to working on the canal. Genessee makes a great bock that I wish was available all year round - but this will do at least until the Octoberfests come out and I can get my malt fix."
"Drinkability - I'm not real big on ""Bock"" beers, but this one is the best Bock I have had thus far. Very well balanced in all aspects. Very sessionable and worth a try."
"really a great take on a bock, worth a sample"
"Drinkability: I'm not too excited by this beer. It's not exciting enough in terms of taste to swallow this heavy brew."
"Would be a very good bock if not for that off-note. Decently thick. Not much carbonation."
"Pours a deep mahogany with a tall head that has nice retention and leaves retention in glass. The aroma first hits with some piney hops then is followed by dark roasted malts. Lots of hops in the aroma. The flavor has a moderate dark malt flavor along with a strong piney hop character. The body is very thin for the style and the drinkability is good."
"D: It is difficult to avoid comparing this beer to others in the Anchor line-up, but its closest cousin surely appears to be the holiday special ale.While that other beer succeeds by being interesting (in an off-beat way) and in tune with the festive season, this bock is found to be lacking in key sensory areas. Most impressive is its appearance, with a darkness more commonly expected from a doppelbock. The smell is entirely too one-dimensional and even predictable, without being enticing. Flavors struggle to find purchase on the palate, but do present themselves cleanly overall. In the end it is a mediocre beer unmistakably brewed by Anchor, and it does pair well with sweet and roasted foods (such as roasted sweet potatoes)."
"Further investigation on this beer at the Anchor web site says that this is brewed with 2-row barley and wheat malt -- no more. Based on the flavor characteristics, I think they're either leaving out that the 2-row is highly kilned, or the black patent malt was skipped from the info."
"Not sure where this is brew is going, while there is a lot of flavor here nothing really fits together IMO. As far as being a Bock, perhaps on a distant circle of the style ... sort of like the outer ring on a dart board where no points are given but at least it stuck somewhere and did not fall to the floor."
"D: If you love rich and malty this one is for you. Solid example of the style and another great beer from a classic brewery."
"D: One of the most interesting and drinkable bocks I've tried."
"D: This beer is quite drinkable and isn't as filling as other types of beers in the style."
"Overall, this is probably my favorite of the spring seasonals that are readily available in most areas. I would love to see this become a year-round release, but it's always nice to have it to look forward to."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer and think it is very good. I don't have much experience with the style, but it is very flavorful and smooth. My only complaint is that it tasted very similar to Anchor's Christmas ale. Maybe they use some of the same malts, but I just wanted it to be a little more unique. However, it is a great beer from a great brewery."
"Dark Brown to Black color in appearance, nice and clear as a dark color can be. It had a bountiful off-white to light tan head. The aroma is malty and toasty, hints of alcohol even though it is only 5.5%, no detectable hops. Taste is rich and toasty, carmalized sugars, but not as sweet as I expected. It is slightly dry with low carbonation. All in all a pleasure to drink. But I prefer the Doppelbocks."
"Nice dark color that approaches black with a thin consistent head that lasted all the way to the bottom of the glass. I would consider this to be one of Anchor's best offerings. The alcohol content is modest which allows you to enjoy the easy drinking nature of this bock."
"Has a light mouthfeel but not too light. Leads to a good drinkibility. Would def recommend this beer and all by Anchor."
"Hits the traditional bock notes, yet overall is a bit lacking in flavor and is a little too tart at times."
"A very enjoyable bock, especially during the winter months."
"Mouthfeel is great, with perfect carbonation and that body I was just talking about. Drinkability is awesome, don't see any end to me drinking this if I had a six pack on me right now. Love it."
"Drinkability: Incredible stuff. God, I hope Anchor's shameful corporate sellout does not ruin its ability to make awesome beer. It has not yet, and let's hope it does not."
"Pours out a very dark mahogany color with some ruby highlights. It has a nice tan head with some lacing on my glass. The smell is of sweet toasty malts, some faint chocolate and dark bready malts. This beer smells pretty spot on for a bock beer, lots of sweet bready malts. The taste is big bready and sweet, but nicely balanced by a finishing bitterness, could be from the dark roasted malts, could be some hops. I am guessing the latter from Anchor. I am somewhat familiar with their beers, taste a lot like their basic dark beer, kinda a bit like the Christmas Ale minus all the accoutrements. Anyway, not a huge bock fan, more a huge Anchor fan and this beer does not disappoint. I especially like the back end hoppyness to give a little more bitterness and balance away from the sweet malt. Anchor Bock is perhaps not the most authentic bock but a nice drinkable one nonetheless!"
"Pours a transparent brown color with a fluffy off white head. Head has decent retention and leaves a little lacing. Smell is of roasted malt, slightly sweet. Taste is roasty and malty, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium with average carbonation. Drinkability is fine, but i'd say I liked this just as much as shiner bock."
"D - quite easy; session-able"
"Pours dark brown topped by foamy off-white head. Strong scent of syrup, bitter chocolate nibs, sour grape, herbs and earth. Tastes of grape, herbs, slight syrup, dryness comes towards the finish but the sour grape with some chocolate returns in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with light carbonation and a coating mouthfeel. A delicate, drinkable brew worth checking out."
"either way. pour is dark for a bock but still sufficient head with a nice lager looking body. nose is a sweet citrus cake of persimmon and clove. palate is like that but quite dry in comparison to the holiday beer. mineral crisp on the tongue and smoked malt in nature but chalk dry. i can see that quality be a big turn off to some drinkers. lager lean feel. distinct pear clove spice."
"A good offering from Anchor. Go Anchor!"
"Drinkability: While this beer did not blow me away, I did enjoy it and will probably drink it again when I'm in the mood."
"This was the first time that I have tried a beer from Anchor and I would buy more."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with a rocky brown head. There is medium head retention and the lacing is kind of lacking. Smells sweet and toasty with earthy/caramel notes in the middle. There a small amount of hops present in the finish of the nose. All in all pretty well rounded. Taste is malty with medium sweetness. I taste mostly sweet caramel notes with a bit of coffee and then there is a hops finish to it. It is light bodied with a little bit too much carbonation. Not very drinkable. I could knock back a couple of these at most. Seems a little too bland."
"Pours a dark brown with light brown head. Nose has fresh dough quality, perhaps from an oatmeal brown bread. Palate has medium sweet caramel with modest hops to balance. Body is on the lighter side, and it is very drinkable as far as bocks go. Alcohol is subdued, or, rather on the low side compared to many bocks I've sampled. Good beer."
"could easily be a session brew"
"I like all of the anchor beers I've had and this is no exception."
"The flavor picks up nicely where the aroma left off, with darker chocolate and more caramel. As Anchor Bock warms, it picks up some dark fruit qualities amidst the maltiness. Near the finish, though, a slight mineral sourness takes hold and is hard to shake (very iron-rich & almost blood-like). Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a tightly-wound carbonation level that suits the medium body nicely. All in all, this is a flavorful, complex Bock beer that keeps me wanting the next sip. Might have to stock up on more before it goes out of season..."
"Good, slightly chewy mouthfeel, nice carbonation. Very drinkable."
"While I enjoyed this beer, I was a little disappointed; I was expecting more - probably because I have always been very pleased with Anchor's lineup. I don't anticipate revisiting this beer anytime soon - I certainly wouldn't purchase a 6pck, but I might have this at a bar if the selection was limited. Glad I tried it, but I will be moving on."
"Medium body with a bit of wateriness. Somewhat creamy up front with medium effervescence and a nice malty aftertaste with a smoky note. Overall, a good beer and would willingly drink it again. Will look for it on tap to see if it is better."
"Pours a clear dark reddish brown, with an impressive creamy tan head that lasts. Smells vaguely of dried fruit. Taste is super sweet caramelized sugar up front, some cocoa in the middle, and a earthy hop finish. Mouthfeel is decent, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is quite good. A sweet beer, but certainly not cloyingly so. Tastes a lot like a porter, IMO more so than a bock, but either way this is a very good beer."
"Anchor Bock is a real brown sugar color, almost the same appearance as root beer. The head is simple, yet a special, tan color. When it reduced to a film over the top of the beer it reminded me of the coco mix in chocolate milk that just didn't quite mix in all the way. The nose is real malty with a hint of a bitter chocolate. The bitterness jumps out right away but it's not overpowering. Some soft leather and burnt tobacco sits on the back of the tongue while a gritty malt texture sticks to the top of the mouth. This will be a great beer to start the fall season but it's still too hot in these Oklahoma Summer days at 100 + degrees to truly enjoy this beer. I will definitely revisit this one when it cools off."
"Black colored brew, amber hues shine through the entire body when held to a light. Small brown head. Rich chocolate malt scent. Chocolate malt taste, maybe just a hint of roast, with a nice light flowery hop finish. Medium bodied, fairl soft and creamy feel. Not bad."
"In terms of mouthfeel and drinkability, this Bock definitely reminded me of Anchor's Porter. I like how this brewery's offerings have a similar taste profile even across different styles. This beer is a worthy addition to their lineup, and provides a good mix between drinkability and complexity."
"Just a solid Bock, not much else to say, another well designed and executed beer from Anchor."
"Mouthfeel is good and coating, for a fairly low abv brew. Fairly creamy mid bodied. The tinge of sour hurts this a bit, if the taste would follow the nose closer this would be potentially really good. Expectations were high after a whif, but it was still a solid American example of the style. Probably a good starter bock."
"Dark brown in color, although not uniform as there was greater clarity near the bottom of the pint glass. The head was 1 1.5", tan and thick. The dominant aromas were chocolate and toffee with a whiff of the roasted malt that becomes very apparent on drinking. Bittersweet chocolate and toffee flavors, with roasted malt in the background that adds some firmness to the mouthfeel. A medium bodied beer that does not taste as sweet as it smells, making it very drinkable."
"O: The nose was nice, but the rest just didn't come through. Thin body, thin flavor. A diet bock, not something I'd seek out again."
"Overall, this is a nice, tasty, enjoyable beer. Relatively low ABV makes it close to sessionable and it would be one I wouldn't mind having multiples of on a given occasion."
"Kind of a meh beer. Looks and smells great- just wish that last part suited me a bit better"
"D - not worth it."
"Verdict: Anchor Bock is solid and to style, as you'd expect from Anchor, though just a little unexciting. In the end, it's kind of a neutered version of Anchor Christmas."
"This is not my favorite bock, and at over $10 a six pack, I can think of better selections. Considering how legendary the Anchor Brewery is, this is a bit of a disappointment."
"Nut brown in color. Herbal aromas with toasted grains, similar to a barleywine's fermented sweetness. The taste is very sour, which builds in layers with each sip. Outside of the sour, there is not much flavor except for a slight hint of malt. It is presented as a Spring Seasonal and it just doesn't work, no matter what time of year."
"D - nice easy drinking lager. another good beer from anchor."
"A weaker strength dunkeles bock that doesn't skimp on the flavor. Watery body is my only quibble."
"Very drinkable. This is surprisingly good for a German-style American brew from a brewery that doesn't get enough fanfare for its quality lineup. Will definitely revisit this one."
"Taste, interesting, not what I expected out of a usually restrained Anchor company. A lil bit of coffee, even hops. Its really got a little bit of everything. Not my thing, but something for everyone. Tastes like an alternate version of Anchor Christmas. If more bocks were made in this style, I'd drink them more often. Props for thinking outside of the box."
"Single in a mix-six pack. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark brown color. Moderate sized egg-white head. Smell was a bit chocolate and biscuit-like. Taste was very flavorful. Roasted malt and underlying notes of fruit and coffee are what I tasted. Mouthfeel was moderately thick and smooth. Very easy to drink with a mid-range abv. A nice beer from Anchor, and I'd surely pick up a six pack for another occasion."
"This poured a hazy dark mahogany with moderate tan head. It smelled like rich caramel and chocolate covered cherries, with plumb and brown sugar and a bit of hazel toffee. It tasted like cocoa powder and dried cherries, with rich caramel and brown sugar and a bit of nutty malt and bready yeast. It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a very tasty beer, and quite interesting for a bock! I loved the scent and flavor, and it had great body too. The cherry character was pretty unique for the style, which I enjoyed, but wasn't entirely correct for bock purists. I would still definitely recommend this beer, and buy it again for myself."
"D: The dry finish after a sip leaves one wanting more. A-one drinkability."
"This is quite a nice beer but it suffers from the American disease of using hops to try and appeal to the beer geek masses. As far as bocks go, I have never come across such an aromatic hop driven bock...while this makes for a decently tasting beer it makes for a basically average and untrue to form bock. Nothing even remotely German about this beer. Still, not unpleasant so thanks anyway."
"The body is about medium with a very smooth feel. Carbonation is mild but crisp. The finish is dry and calls for another sip, easy to drink as well. It's a nice unfamiliar tasting stab at a bock."
"Beer is medium in body and there's a lot of carbonation on the palate of the beer. There is a nice mellow sweetness throughout and beer finishes completely. Its not dry, its well connected. Good caramel flavors, overall a really drinkable and great mouthfeel. This is a really good beer."
"Definitely a tasty beer, but throughout, it continues to remind me of the aforementioned seasonal. That makes any chance at being a unique offering quite a stretch. Enjoyable nonetheless."
"Worth seeking out if you like spring bocks!"
"I was disappointed with this beer. The taste did not match the promising aroma. But I am not very experienced with this style. I would try it again in a year and see if my thoughts about it change."
"D- Really nice drinkable bock beer, strong enough to nourish me through the remaining winter months, but hoppy enough to have me longing for spring."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours clear burgundy with a fluffy tan head. Aroma is caramel with an earthiness (hops?) and that classic, immediately-identifiable Anchor breadiness. Flavor is very mellow with a nice bready sweetness, caramel, molasses, earth, creamy light mousse, and red fruits. Lots of notes here, body is thin but not watery enough to dilute the nice flavor profile. This has a lot more going on than other ubiquitous bocks (I'm looking at you SN Glissade and Shiner). Liked it quite a bit."
"I'm fairly pleased with this beer, but I think it strays a bit from what a ""bock"" is supposed to be. I found it to be rather hoppy for a beer of this style, and I also find it rather light despite the color and the intensity of its aroma. It's worth a try, but it may not be for everyone. I would definately get it again, but for me it pushes the boundary of the style (albiet, in a good way)."
"A nice aroma from this beer. Malty, caramel, and a dash of piney hops round it out. A solid medium body rolls this thing across. The deeply roasted, almost nutty, malt produces some caramel flavors as well. The beer is a bit wanting through the center, but finishes with light dash of hops, just enough for balance. This is an interesting beer in that it borders on the line between bock and something darker. The flavor is a bit light, but overall a pretty solid brew."
"D: Hardly the worst bock I've had, but not the best by any stretch of the imagination. A solid C, inching towards a gentleman's B."
"Overall very drinkable and a great example of a Bock! Would recommend."
"12oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a deep reddish brown with two fingers of tan head. For a minute I thought that I had the porter instead! Some caramel malt and a bit of hops in the aroma. Light to medium bodied. Fairly malty flavor with some chocolate malt. Bit of a hop bite. Not what I look for in a bock, but a very drinkable beer on a purely hedonistic lever. So I guess the lesson is don't categorize, just drink!"
"Pours a lovely ruby brown with a thick steadfast khaki head that leaves some traces of laces behind. The smell is faint, but there are nonetheless detectable notes of dark malts, wheat, brown sugar, and figs. The taste generally follows, but witb the addition of a chalky cocoa flavor that seems to dry things out a bit. The body is lightly medium, quite smooth, and lightly carbonated, making for a fairly drinkable brew. Overall, though, a decidedly average bock."
"Anchor bock did not knock my socks off. It was definitely in the taste, maybe too bitter, maybe the absence of any cocoa, not sure. However, it is certainly good enough to sample again sometime."
"D-this is well balanced and brings some good flavors. It is very smooth and quite easy to drink. The malts dominate, as they should, with a solid hop representation at the finish. Very nice job!"
"Medium bodied, very smooth and very drinkable, altogether a very nice bock."
"D: An excellent bock from Anchor. I didn't see this around last year, but I'm glad I picked up a sixer instead of a single. An easy drinker and a top-notch American bock."
"Buy Again? Yes"
"Nice dark mahogany color, creamy, low-lying head. The color is like aged port wine, very unique. Smell of malt, cocoa, with a hint of coffee. Flavor is very good, actually pretty near greatness. The coffee hints in the smell really come out in the flavor. The finish is crisp and imparts a slight tartness with a hint of sweet/sour cherry. Rich, creamy mouthfeel, very satisfying to drink. ABV is perfect for a bock, and overall these aren't too heavy to have a short session with. Excellent dark beer and one of the best bocks I've had."
"Final Thought: A real nice example of a bock beer, deserves to be set as the model beer for its style!"
"D - Awesome. A total winner. Easy drinking, very delicious, full-bodied but not overly filling, poundable..."
"Drinkability: Very nice Bock overall, with a rich malt flavor and nice hop bite. Another winner from Anchor."
"nice beer, dammit. US brewers don't seem to go for the bocks these days, preferring something they can slap ""-ator"" on the end of"
"Drinkability: I could happily drink this all night long, one of the best beers I have had from Anchor, and being a massive fan of the brewery that is saying a lot. Huge full flavours and an immensely moreish quality. 4"
"D- thirst quenching and refreshing, and once more, i think that wheat plays a major part in some of my favorite aspects of this beer. modest abv makes it ridiculously drinkable. a rare find in these parts, and just as good as anchor's other offerings."
"D: Easy to drink and a stand-up version of a bock with big time dark malt and nutty, earthy character."
"Drinkability/Notes: A great Bock. Lots of malt yet mild. Super drinkabilty for sure, i would love to drink these with friends all night long on a cool spring evening. Exactly what i would expect from Anchor Brewing- awesome beer."
"Overall: I love anchor but the rating I gave this particular bottle was a little generous because of this. I can respect trying to do a good heavy bock, but this one failed for me. This sting at the end, and a soy sauce aftertaste makes me think either its infected, gone bad, or a strange mix of ingredients."
"Overall - A pretty good example of a bock.. well worth a try.."
"D- decent, not amazing."
"drinkability - Interesting taste on this one. Only 5.5% might of been what threw me off, most of them are higher. Worth a try though."
"D: The sweetness causes me to think I couldn't sit down and drink six of these but it is worth grabbing another. Not a session beer but still very drinkable."
"Drinkability> ja."
"Maybe not a completely traditional German Bock, but damn good none the less. Maybe better. It doesn't have that dull muted quality so many German Bocks have, it's almost more Dunkel-ish, yet still retains that big Bock/bordering on Porter without the hops, sort of taste. Damn good beer."
"D-Very tasty, though a couple would be enough."
"Drinkability: I could probably sip on these all night - the flavors are pretty robust and taste great; the ABV is pretty small overall; the body is smooth and not too heavy... A fine beer."
"This one's solid but a little underwhelming given all the love it has."
"D - Sweet and filling, a beer that would fit right in as winter turns to spring. A little too sweet for my tastes, but its not a bad brew."
"Drinkability - well, I definitely enjoyed it again but this is a beer for savoring over the course of a meal. While I finished it relatively quickly, I didn't want another one right away to keep it going."
"D: Although this beer is very tasty, I couldn't drink more than a few of these because they sit rather heavy in the stomach. That said, I really have no complaints about this brew, it has exceeded my expectations. Another good one from Anchor Brewing Company. Kudos!"
"i want to try this one again"
"This is a nice beer to sit with for a bit."
"Drinkability- pretty drinkable, smooth, overall good beer, would drink it regularly( but it's seasonal lol)"
"Different than any other bock I've had, but quite good in its own right. Probably would've been better if I had gotten it a bit fresher. Another quality offering from Anchor."
"Anchor Bock pours a deep dark brown almost black body yet clear and ruby when when held up to the light. The aromas are apple, chocolate, malty and sweet. The flavors match well with some caramel and dark chocolate with a noticable hop flavor in the finish and the clean character of a lager. It has a chewy mouthfeel that is solid. Overall, a tasty tasty beer."
"Anchor Bock pours a beautiful shade of nut brown, a dark mahogany highlighted with maroon and mocha. The head is substantial and leaves good lacing. The aroma is sweet with some nuttiness, like a good, heavy pumpernickel or dark rye bread with a sprinkling of caramelized sugar. The malt is definitely the star. The beer really smells like bread; there's even a baker's yeast flavor lurking. The flavor is a bit sweet for my taste, but it's far from bad. It's an aggressively malty beer, more of a bread in a glass style beer than most American bocks. I don't recognize whatever hops were used, something European I'd guess. At any rate, the whole package fulfills my mental image of a Bock better than anything that I've previously tasted. While I'm not in love with the beer, I don't think that it could really be improved as my score might indicate. It's a tightly crafted beer that nails the style. Changing anything about it would be akin to making an entirely new beer because it tastes like they hit what they were shooting for already. Every time I have an Anchor beer, I ask myself why don't I buy from my local brewery more often. Anchor makes fine beer."
"D= great. Maybe one of the best bocks I've had to date. Quite impressive."
"I prefer Anchor's regular 'steam' beer, but this is a good one as well. Although not nearly as strong (ABV) as European bock but more so than Shiner, it goes well with most kinds of food. Worth trying if you can get it because it can be hard to find."
"Poured a murky brown w/ one-finger tan head that dies slowly and left lace patches. A strong malt smell of caramel, toffee, cocoa, roasted and bread. A sweet tasting beer that is thick and a littly syrupy as there are all kinds of malts in here. Caramel, bitter chocolate, maple syrup, molasses that combine with some roasted and/or coffee notes to give it a balanced dryness and some depth. Hops are minimal though make a slight appearance on the edges, but this is really like drinking nothing but malt. Good beer to try."
"Anchor Bock pours a dark brown with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a bit of toffee and quite a bit of hops in the aroma, more than I would have expected. More hops up front in the flavor than I would have expected, but this fades quickly into malt. Toffee and caramel flavors are dominant, but there is a touch of roast toward the very end. Overall a very tasty beer."
"Clear dark mahogany. Thin beige head. Bubbly collar. Lacing is light.I really like this nose. It's a mix of molasses, fudge, caramel, licorice and yeasty breadiness. It's like a ""dubbel/bock"" hybrid. Flavor starts with the molasses/fudge combination. Anise oil dries it out a little. This is really a uniquely flavored bock. Now I'm thinking ""Bock/dubbel/imperial stout"" hybrid. There's some dry cedar and white birch coming through lightly. Caramel and bready malts. Medium full body. If you gave this beer to me blind, I'd probably guess it to be a dubbel. It's a good beer."
"This one went down in a hurry. Probably not the truest representation, but pretty decent anyway. Worth a try."
"Great beer for a cool spring night. Too bad we're already out of those in Florida."
"M: very creamy rich feel. Not very carbonated but it works well for this beer."
"D - Great overall. Good example for the style though dark."
"medium, almost lightly syrupy body. acidic texture in the finish. lightly prickly carbonation is mild to moderate overall and gives fluffiness."
"D - very appealing great beer. Not intended for multiple P's or Q's. But incredibly good."
"D: This is a very well-balanced and drinkable bock. Not my favorite style overall, but Anchor has put together a quality brew here."
"Anchor Brewing amazes me in that they can brew such a diverse range of beers and pull off each and every style as if it were their own. How can one brewery make the definitive American pale ale, English barleywine, Baltic porter and German bock? As previously stated, this is every bit as rich and complex as a fine aged English old ale or barleywine, and certainly twice as drinkable too."
"D - I enjoyed this brew. It had some complexity yet was easily drinkable."
"D- Perfect for a session beer but I would be good after one, this one was just a little to plain for me although I enjoyed it alot. Would buy again."
"D - Its flavors are interesting and unique but wouldn't make for something I want to drink for a while even though it's good representation of a bock."
"It pours with a thick, tawny head that dissipates slowy. The color is a rich mahogany. The aroma is malt, toffee, and a little hoppy brightness. The flavor is very inviting with notes of caramel, toffee, biscuit, and hops. The mouthfeel is very pleasant, maybe even silky. It almost feels like I'm drinking a milk stout. I will definitely be picking up another 6-pack the next time I'm out. And it's refreshing, to boot."
"Pretty good Bock actually. The slight diacetyl slightly puts me off but it's solid overall especially considering there aren't that many good versions in the USA."
"pours dark brown almost back with 3 finger tan head. smells a sweet bready malts with a little fruit. taste is much like it smells with a nice bitter chocolate after taste. mouthfeel is very light and thin with a little carbonation and tingles the tongue. overall this is one of the better anchor beers butnot something i will be purchasing again."
"Pours a crystal clear dark reddish brown, very nice colour, thick tan head forms, very compact, slowly settles down to a thin layer, good ring, few lace spots stick, looks real nice. Smell is sweet, very malty, some caramel, brown sugar, raisins, very fruity, strawberries and cherries, biscuity, very nice maltiness, very rich, touch of chocolate and roast, complex stuff. Taste is similar, very sweet at first, brown sugar and caramel, cherries, very fruity, some raisins, very rich malts, lots of toast and biscuit, sweet and first but finishes dryer, real nice low ABV bock. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very drinkable stuff. I dig this one!"
"D- Overall, this is another solid beer from Anchor that is definitely worth checking out. Recommended!"
"This beer poured a dark opaque brown with a big three-finger tan head. The smell is mostly malt with some caramel and hops. The taste starts off with some toasted bready malt that gives way to some dried fruit with some coffee bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is thick with some mild carbonation. This is a tasty beer and always worth grabbing, but it sits a little heavy for having more than a couple at a time."
"As someone who normally drinks hoppy beers, it was nice to have a beer on the maltier side of the spectrum."
"Drinkability gets very good marks here. I liked this one a LOT. One of the best bocks I've had to date."
"Pouring this into my tulip and shaker glasses produced a frothy, tan head floating on a dark brown brew. Not much in the smell department, but the taste is has great roasted malt with coffee notes, and I really couldn't detect any hops. Maybe a slight grassy bitterness if a concerntrated real head. Really enjoyed the fresh and clean taste of this one. Mouth feel a little creamy. Very drinkable with all that roasted bitterness in there, but no bad after taste. Excellent session beer."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium body. The mouth feel is carbonated and creamy. The finish lingers for a few moments on the palate. This is a nice easy drinking American bock. The German bock are a bit more richer in flavor."
"Finally got to try Anchor's Bock, I had seen it around for a few springs but never had it before now. A very nice beer, more complex than I was expecting. A solid bock for an early spring day."
"Mouth is lightly carbonated and thick. A good solid bock indeed. Anchor is the shizzel."
"Stays on tongue with carbonated feel."
"A fantastic bock, probably my favorite bock from the states. There is a nice traditional malty backbone that is interweaved with the west coast hops style. I really enjoyed the interplay of these two elements and highly recommend."
"Aside from the very light diacetyl flavor in the finish this is a very nice beer."
"I want to really like this beer. Anchor has the head perfect - this thing was towering over the top of my glass, absolutely monstrous for a bock. The color is gorgeous, cola-like red-brown. The model of a dunkler bock. Taste is pretty solid, too, malty and roasty. But then there's... the aftertaste. Pine. Piney hops. This beer settles it - I do not like west-coast US hops. At all. For the same reason I don't like gin, I don't like Anchor's hops. If pine is your thing, go for it, but I had to dock this one on taste and drinkability because it just doesn't do it for me."
" I am rediscovering many of Anchor's products, many of which have become staples in my fridge once again. This may find it's way into my shopping cart more often, but first it has to pass the girlfriend test."
"It is a good beer, but not a great one."
"As with all other Anchor beers that I've had over the years, you can expect a quality and flavorful brew."
"D, this is a great bock, drink this beer please! this is awesome for the change from winter to spring ."
"D- Go ahead and put back a few of these."
"Nice mouthfeel and very easy drinking beer. Lagers are not my thing, but this is a very good american lager. A good american twist on a german style."
"Drinkability is pretty good nice spring time sit down beer"
"D - A nice spring brew light and sessionable. A definite six packer"
"Deep dark brown with a modest tan head. Good amount of tight lacings. Aroma is brown sugar caramel. Taste is bready, fruity raisen, cocoa, and earthy bitter hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and slick. Easy drinking very dark bock beer. Very much like liquid raisen bread."
"This was a flavorful, well carbonated (for the style), and well hopped up Bock Beer. It poured a nice brown with the coppery off white colored head. Some lacing, plenty of retention. The nose on the beer is caramel, toffee, some raisin, some roasted notes. The taste is quite a bit more bittering and substantial than I expected. The beer is medium bodied without being cloying or syrupy. There is a definite brown sugar and roasted grain character to the beer. It's a good bock, complex enough, interesting enough to seek out."
"Mouthfeel is good and medium bodied. It's not too heavy, which is nice because it allows the chocolate flavor at the end to finish very crisply. Fairly low alcohol too, so this is extremely drinkable. The assertive flavors stand in the way of it being a ""I could drink a gallon of this"" kind of beer but this was thoroughly enjoyable."
"Very drinkable and a nice way to start the evening. A perfect beer for early spring in New England. Definitely worth picking up again."
"Anchor Bock poured a very dark brown/ruby with a full tan head. Smell was very full of citrusy hops. The taste was of dark fruits, hints of citrus and brown sugar. Mouthfeel was good, as well as the drinkability. Overall I found this to be an interesting bock. Had more hops then other bocks I have had. A nice beer and I would buy it again, but there are other bock beers I would drink first."
"It is full-bodied without going into doppelbock territory. This is a nice dark bock!"
"Pours a ruby red color with a large white head. Rings form down the glass. Smells of some oft-chocolate and rapsberries and cherries. Taste a bit off. Seems like it is missing something. It is a medium bodied brew and strange cause it has a bit of a hollow taste. Easy to drink, very easy. I would not shy away from this again."
"There was just something about this beer that rubbed me the wrong way. Not a bad beer, but there was just something about it."
"Creamy mouthfeel. Refreshing and drinkable. This is the first beer I've had in a while that I want to go immediately back to."
"D- A very nice, sweet beer. It is pretty simple, but very enjoyable."
"D - Very tasty and not overpowering. I could definitely have another, but alas, this is my only bottle."
"D: This brew is very easy and pleasant to consume. Tons of body and flavor. One of the better bocks I've had recently."
"served out of 12 0z bottle into a pint glass. pours pretty much black with a small tan head that faded almost instantly(maybe because of the pour) to a small ring of foam around the edge of the glass. when held up to the light it appears to be a dark ruby brown color. a little bit of lacing. in the nose their are aromas of molasses, chocolate, some roasted malts, and a hint of some raisins or dates, dried fruit. the mouthfeel of this beer is just right, medium bodied, with some light carbonation, pair that with the ABV and you got an extremely drinkiable beer. in the taste their is a little bit of molasses, a little bit of chocolate making it a little sweet, but balanced very nicely by a subtle hop bitterness. i havent had too many bocks in my time, but this has got to be one of my favorite bock beers. definately worth a try."
"D - I am trying to convince my wife that we should buy a keg of this..."
"Chewy mouthfeel a nice burnt aftertaste. I really enjoyed the body and the grainbill is bold. Little bit more hops than I expected but it was a nice bock and quite drinkable."
"Quite a decent bock here. Drinkable, low in ABV and just plain flavorful. A good spring beer."
"I know I really don't ever ""crave"" standard bocks, but this one is about as standard as I can think of."
"Pours a deep, dark mahogany, almost black, with a small head that leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. Smells like chocolate malt, a little vanilla, perhaps a hint of pine. Tastes of dark roast malt, a bit nutty, some pure cocoa powder. Slightly astringent, a bit of hop bitterness aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice, just slightly syrupy. Very drinkable, nice on a cool spring day."
"Recommended."
"Deep brown with red tinting. Short brownish head, sticks haphazardly all over the glass. Smells malty and vaguely fruity, like a hint of plums and loamy soil. Some alcohol evident on the nose too. Flavor is malty, sweet and rich on the tongue. really clean tasting, and features the nice evenly roasted malt very well. Medium bodied, with an approaching-velvet feel. Drinks nicely in these early NorCal spring days"
"D: A fine example the bock style. Very enjoyable and accessable to those who are turned off by harsh flavors."
"A fair bock, and an interesting take on the style. Nice, rich, malty and creamy. I don't see myself drinking this one regularly... and I'm really not craving any more after finishing one 12oz bottle. But it's a decent brew and definitely showcases the spectrum that Anchor has to offer."
"Excellent Bock beer!"
"Pours out to a clear very deep chestnut brown, forming a tall poofy dark tan head with very good retention and nice creamy sheets of lace. The carbonation is moderate. The aroma is of sweet malt, raisins, toffee, burnt sugar, and distant molasses. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a cola like twang if sweetness and acidity. The taste begins with some up front herbaceous hops, then caramelized sugar, burnt toast, followed by tobacco, mild woodsy bitterness, and charred wood in the finish. There is this wierd cola like sheen and sweetness in the finish that I don't really care for."
"(rated 2/26/2007)"
"D - This Bock had great characteristics that really made this a very sessionable beer for me, the complex flavors, good body, and slight carbonation mixed well together, outstanding beer from Anchor"
"Dark brown with a thick tan head. Heavy aroma of molasses, toasty malt, and bread. More molasses in the taste, but accompanied by cocoa and nuttiness. The hops give it a nice balance without ruining the character of the beer. Very rich and heavy mouthfeel. Nice."
"Drinkable brew."
"Notes from 11/03/06."
"The aroma is like cola, malt, yeast, and leaves. The appearance is dark brown with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma, not complex because the diverse elements come together which for me is a good thing. The palate is smooth. Overall it's a pretty good beer."
"Drinkability: Bocks aren't my favorite beers ever, but this is a really good example of the style."
"Bottle thanks to mmm///beer. Pours a beautiful dark red color with a large brown head. There is lots of brown in the body, mixed with the redness it almost seems like purple. The aroma is great; sweet berries, chocolates, toasted malts, and some sweeter candy notes. The flavor is very complex and nice; tons of fruit upfront, sour cherries, strawberry and others. A rich chocolate and brown sugar follow, and some light coffee in the finish. Light body and a somewhat easygoing beer. Very nice."
"A pleasantly tame bock. Roasty and dry, with a slight, sweet syrup. The ale never steps out of its boundaries, balanced with spicy malt and a hint of bitter tart rasberry. A session bock, toasty medium body with a tang to keep the sweetness in check. Walks a comfortable line providing a safe and easy stronger ale."
"I still prefer Double Bocks."
"Pours a dark dark brown body, and a big foamy off-tan head, with good lacing and is somewhat lasting. Has a very fresh aroma, outdoorsy, somewhat dusty. Malty, somewhat dusty, somewhat nutty taste. Good body, somewhat light. Spring-y. More creamy, and fruity as it warms up."
"I was severely let down by Anchor Steam, as I'm a massive fan of Anchor's porter. They redeemed themselves in a big way with their bock. I can see myself picking up a six-pack of this delicious stuff in the near future."
"Mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium and provides enjoyable support to the rest of the beer. Very drinkable as Anchor shows that a lot can be accomplished without an overwhelming alcohol content."
"It's nice and drinkable."
"Pours a deep amber/ black color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet caramel and hints of honey. In the taste, dark raisons/ fruit, and a nice roasty maltiness. A small bite and medium mouthfeel, with a dry dark fruit aftertaste. Nice representation of style, nice dark fruit presence, and good."
"Chocolate root beer brown body. Finger of thick, creamy, dirty khaki head. Nose of lightly-roasted malts, plums, toffee, bread pudding, and brandy. Nice. Toasted, grainy bitterness up front. Chocolate and toffee sweetness commence. Light fruit notes (fig, plum) follow. Astringent herbal bitterness comes on strong, backed with a slight cooked vegetable flavor. Bittersweet finish with some fruit juice and brandy notes. Medium-bodied with a slightly sticky feel. Not bad, but not my favorite Anchor offering."
"D: This is a really good session bock beer."
"I have not had many bock beers but this one was a lot more substantial than the ones I have had."
"Overall - well worth it if you can find some. An excellent interpretation of the style. Would pair well with some German food."
"This brew was great. It poured a dark coffee color with a hint of red shining through at the bottom of the glass. From its last third of the pour a khaki tinted head emerged to a two finger height, it faded slowly to pleasantly nice sheeting with lattice lacing on the sides. As tantalizing as it looked the smell made me want it more. Floral hops, roasted to almost perfect sweetness filled the air in the glass. At the forefront you get a nice toasted hop with oak mellowing to sweet malts at the end. This is a full bodied drink, it's thick and creamy that goes down smooth. It definitely feels like liquid bread that's not too bitter but not too sweet, it's a great balance that has me coming back for more."
"i wish that this one was avalable all year long but i will get more in spring"
"This beer has lots of character and is much easier to drink than some other bock beers that are on the market."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: A bit thinner and more watery than I would have liked. Flavor isn't all that fleeting. However, I feel; that the tart edge to this almost tales away from, its finish. It almost seems to me that it is setting itself up for a drier finish- with the roasted grain bitterness and flavor lingering-but it then is all undone by the tart edge that comes in and takes over leaving a sourness; tartness that lingers quite a long time after you've put the glass down. Overall an okay brew, not going to be the first bock I pick up next season , but i might buy it again. Nothing really all that great, average in m opinion."
"This beer is a wonderful take on the style, and is unlike any other bock I've encountered. It's very hoppy and rich, but has this wonderfully crisp, fine, fruitiness that sets it apart. Superb drinkability"
"A good bock to pick up if you're in that type of drinking mood."
"Found a sixer of this at whole foods on wad ave for $5.99(?). Seeing how i love bocks and goats i couldn't resist. A good bock with a nice dry finish and not overwhelmingly sweet. nice color and an easy drinker. not my first choice in bocks but not my last either. good for the price"
"Mouthfeel- an earthy hop bitterness is first on the palate but gets swept away by the sweet and heavier malt flavors. I detect some licorice and toffee flavors. Standard malty bock,this is good! A slight bitterness on the finish from the darker roasted malts is there as well. This was on sale for $3.99 a sixer-super bargain and tasty!"
"The good taste and lighter mouthfeel make for a pretty darn drinkable beer. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a thick black with a thin white head, which dissipates quickly with no lacing whatsoever. The aroma is disappointing - thin and faintly cardboard-like. The flavor is much better, with good dark malt, giving it a raisin-like character, with hints of dark cherry and tobacco. Nice tobacco bite on the finish. The mouthfeel is good, though not outstanding. This is a decent dark beer, but perhaps not transcendent."
"D: While it is light bodied, the beer sits a little heavier in the stomach than I would've expected. Also, the sweetness could get a bit cloying after 3 or 4--not a session beer. Nevertheless, the flavor is balanced enough to where, for a bock, this is an excellent choice."
"A single 12 oz bottle recently purchased during my trip to the Party Source (located just across the river in KY) when I was visiting my brother in Cincinnati (and boy did we do some drinking of shit beer for old time's sake the first night I was down there!) I had never seen this particular Anchor Steam beer before so I definitely wanted to get it. Poured into my stange glass. This beer is a very dark brown color with some ruby/amber highlights. The big, fluffy tan head is about 3 1/2 fingers thick when poured, settling to a nice surface coating after about 15 minutes. Very excellent lace indeed. Sweet, strong malty aromas with chocolate, caramel and dark fruit-raisins and plums, and alcohol. Kind of surprised I could smell the alcohol this much since the beer is only 5.5% ABV. Sweet and malty with the aforementioned caramel, chocolate and dark fruits making their presence well known. A bit of a tart flavor and the taste of alcohol round it out. Has a mild hop bitter finish. Has a crisp, frothy and smooth, sort of chewy full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink indeed! One of the best bock's I have ever had. Period! This was fantastic!"
"Exactly what you want from a good bock! Extra points for the bottle design - brilliant. Smell is of chocolate with caramel and coffee overtones. Heathly head that reduces to a thin whisp. Beer is jet black. Heavy malty body, with a chewy sweetness, and hints of alcohol. Slight hint of fruit - maybe plums. Mild bitter finish which is a nice touch and reminiscent of anchor beers. Thoroughly enjoyable and a real treat."
"A dark mahogany-cherry wood color with giant tan foam and good lace. Mild burnt molasses and coffee chocolate aroma with an odd green oats character. Grassy tart charcoal flavor. Aqueous with mild carbonation. Some licorice highlights but the tartness is almost cherry-like. A somewhat unusual blend of sweetness and sour with some hop bitterness at the front. Pretty drinkable, not heavy, but I don't think I would want too much of this level of tartness. Unique and enjoyable addition to the bock options. Mellows as your taste buds adjust."
"Got a single from the Wine Specialist. Pours a nice highlighted brown color with a huge puffy head. Nose is lots of sweet malt, caramel, dried fruit. Taste is likewise, although a fair bit milder than expected. Very smooth, and lacking in some of the spicy malt that I expected. Body was a little thin. Overall, not a bad brew, but not really as exciting as I'd hoped."
"Always a favorite brewery with great consistency. They've been a round a while and know how to do things, never really going""over the top""."
"Anchor Bock pours a deep red brown with A beautiful off white head that lingers. The first thing I smell is fresh berries, just a hint. There is a dark, toasted malt aroma mixed with earthy and slightly floral hops. The malt is dominant in the flavor with hints of astringent dark malt and some dry caramel flavor. The beer is rich and malty, with just enough damp, earthy hops to balance it out."
"A very nice bock and an easy drinker. Low ABV helps drinkability."
"Drinkability: Despit having a tea aroma and having a taste of watered down malts, it wasn't such a bad Bock beer. If you can find it, I can't see why not why this wouldn't make a good choice for a session Bock beer. I know I wouldn't mind."
"Definitely a decent product but not necessarily my Bock of choice on a regular basis. Maybe that's good because it's not available in my home area anyways."
"I love this brewery and wanted to love this beer, but just couldnt get into it."
"Overall- A great looking beer that is quite easy to drink. A good Spring choice."
"Drinkability is high, in the fact that I definitely wish I had more of these on deck. The rich flavors beg it to be sipped slowly and savored, I love beers that drink much bigger then they actually are, ABV wise (in regards to depth, not heat)."
"Pours a nice dark brown/black color with a tall and thick tan colored head that laces the glass very well on the way down. The aroma is of sweet roasted malts and some caramel and dark fruits I believe. The taste is a nice sweet yet bitter roasted malt, some chocoalte, and a little caramel, not much else. It is a nice beer and I liked it though I was expecting it to be sweeter than it was. It has a nice smooth and warming mouthfeel which makes it a pretty drinkable beer."
"Easy drinking, and I love the smooth, creamy body. Could drink a couple of these in a session."
"A very well made Bock beer here by Anchor. Quite drinkable and at 5.5% makes for a few to be easily opened and quaffed."
"Overall, a well made product, but seemed more like a roasted winter warmer than a rich spring-celebration."
"good drinkability, it's got some real meat to it, but the glass empties itself quickly. a very fine bock beer."
"Anchor Bock pitches a rich mahogany into the Yankees pint glass, topped by a thin finger of tan froth that dissipates fairly quickly. Decent lacing lines the glass. The fantastic color makes the presentation. Brown sugar and faint whiffs of roasted coffee find the nose well enough. These dictate the taste as well, with hints of toffee emerging as it warms. It's not spectacular, but rather a nice, steady bock, vaguely reminiscent of a slightly smoky porter. Nicely carbonated and smooth, this is a good find. Pleasant and well-textured, definitely recommended."
"This beer is very easy to drink and will be a regular in my fridge every spring."
"I like this one quite a bit -- probably more so than the other across-the-board highly regarded Anchor offerings. Nice spring beer too, especially if we're talking about early spring when it's still cold and often dreary."
"Poured a very, very dark brown with just a slight reddish hue. There was a lot of tan foam and lace. The smell of fruit and roasted malts were very evident. The taste, thickness and flavor was much like a stout rather than a bock. The taste of tart molasses, roasted malts and a hint of fruit was pleasant. This was the darkest bock ale that I can ever remember drinking."
"M/D: Full bodied, low carbonation. Drinkability is very good on this one. Low ABV, smells good, looks good, tastes good. A damn good beer."
"M&D: Full bodied and full flavored, this has good mouthfeel about it. The carbonation is light but persistent and is very pleasant within the brew. I enjoyed this quite a bit and look forward to it as a regular season brew. Good stuff."
"Very elegant and artfully crafted. A benchmark for bock lager. Better than many bocks from Germany."
"I think the drinkability on this is rather high. Spring in Ohio is a great place for this. The beer drinks sort of like a heavier beer would, but is meant for spring. Perfect for an area where the beginning of Spring is still very prone to snow and cold weather."
"Very middle of the road for me. It is not a bad beer, it just seems very bland to me. I will pass this up next time."
"Poured a deep dark brown color with decent head that dissipated rapidly. Aroma is sweet maltiness with notes of chocolate and dark fruits. Taste has notes of dark fruit, chocolate, and roasted nuttiness. Fairly complex. Mouthfeel is pleasant and drinkability is fairly high."
"MF&D - Medium body bock. Sticky and delicious. Went down smooth and fast. A great easy drinking bock. I highly recommend this one."
"D: It went down very easily. The six-pack didn't last long."
"An atypically dark brown, almost black brew supports a quickly receding tan head, leaving streaks of skinny lacing behind. Smells of sweet bread, caramel and a bit of earthiness. Tastes of dark chocolates mixed with malts and an afterthought of subtle spice. Way more flavorful than many of the bocks I've tried. Despite it's gutsy aroma and taste it has a light-bodied mouth-feel, which makes for a sweet little tasty session brew that you shouldn't grow tired of."
"This poured a nice dark brown with hints of red. A fluffy head forms but instantly dissapates. The aroma is malty, bready and slightly alcoholic. It is malty but there is some nice bitterness from the hops. THe taste is incredible. It is very malty but the additional hop, roasted nuttiness, and most importantly the sweet fruitiness that knocks this one out of the park.The feel is between medium and full with a slight sticky feel to it. To sum it up id say its a sweet fruity bock mixed with a little nut brown. You can drink this slow and LOVE IT, or you can pound it quickly if you need to and love it!"
"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass with 3 fingers of thick, foamy, tan head which dissipates slowly leaving a good amount of lacing. Deep burnt caramel color. Aroma is subtle, but with hints of hazelnuts, vanilla and malt sweetness. Quite smooth upfront and goes down oily with a bit of a hop bite. Flavor of hazelnuts, chocolate and coffee. Medium bodied with good drinkability."
"A very sessionable bock for Anchor. Definitely one to try."
"Drinkability: Very surprising for a bock and once I realized this wasn't going in the traditional direction, I rather enjoyed the places the beer took me"
"Pours a clear but very dark brown with a tannish head. Nose is minor malts with minor coffee. Flavor is very robust. Nice thick flavor that lingers for a little bit and then disappears, leaving a coffee after taste. Just comes off nice and robust really. Very nice. Good feel. Carbonation is biting, but it's not overly prevalent. The verdict is this is a nice bock. I usually don't go directly for this style, but this is nice. Easily a session brew."
"While not spectacular, this is a pretty solid beer. Especially considering it's relatively low abv. Nice effort from Anchor."
"D_wow, very good to say the least. Very nicely rounded Bock and very apt for the style. This will be a staple of mine for the spring."
"Overall, this is a decent brew. The mouthfeel finish is a bit off for me, but otherwise its nice and malty, good flavor profile."
"Bought this kind of on a whim, but very glad I did. Delicious. Not what I would call a bock if I were picky, but well worth drinking this one."
"D: Very easy to quaff a sixer of this over the course of the evening."
"D: Quite drinkable. The extra bitterness took me back a bit, but I'd revisit this again."
"This here is the darkest bock beer I have ever seen. Darker than quite a few double bocks I might add. Dark dark mahogany color bordering on black almost. Tan creamy head. The aroma caught me off guard at first - I thought I smelled suede. It's more like a light roasty, chocolaty, nutty aroma. The flavor shows some roasted malt and faint hazelnut. It reminds me of sticking my nose in a one pound bag of cracked dark crystal malt. There is definitely some Anchor Porter character here in the nose and taste. A little fuller than medium bodied with a little extra carbonation. Finished slightly tannic from the burly darker malts that colored this otherwise lower gravity beer. Also some hop bitterness. All in all I don't know if this really tastes like a bock, but it tastes good. Call it Anchor Porter Light. Wait! Two thirds of the way into this beer and I suddenly had a revelation. It tastes like Anchor Christmas beer without the spices!"
"My first impression of this beer was not very good, but as I've had a few more it's starting to grow on me. Very nice rich ruby brown color. The head rose up nicely, but dissipated pretty fast after a moderately hard pour. It has a great hoppy start, that gives way to a rich maltyness. There is a slight chocolatyness, hints of vanilla and caramel. Overall a very tasty bock."
"I'm digging this one. I don't know if its in the top 20 or 30, but this is one six pack I'm anxious to finish."
"D - Not exactly a session brew. The bitterness and overall burnt taste makes this a one and done. Not the best bock I've had but overall pretty good."
"Good stuff... Recommended..."
"Superb!"
"Rich Chocolately deep brown, but basically black in the glass with mild light tan head. Fairly light smell but it is a roasty, malty smell with chocolately, caramel hints. Rich and carbonated body, with mild sweetness, a slight hint of bitterness and a nice bitter-sweet mild coffee like finish. A touch bland, but my bottle might be quite old. One I'd love to have fresh. Still good nonethess and not a disappointment at all."
"Pours with a substantial tannish brown head that sits atop a dark ruby body. Aromas of malt, toffee(?). Tastes sweet, malty yet with a slight dry crispness that is characteristic of lagers. Finishes sweet with a decent mouthfeel. A good seasonal offering from Anchor and a good beer to bring to a spring gathering."
"Pours a deep nearly opaque dark brown that shows slight ruby highlights when held to light, but not much. Aroma is a slight maltiness, but not much there. The taste was a nice blend of sweet malts, dried fruits and caramel. The beer is light and refreshing with a decent amount of carbonation. This one is certainly enjoyable and makes a great spring beer."
"D= Comes on strong and finishes smooth. Recommended for warmer weather than a San Francisco February dusk. Good thirst quencher, if anything."
"This is a well balanced offering and probably not very accurate to the style. I, however, like this one more than the typical bock."
"Cheers."
"D: Very drinkable per style with a good warming. perfect for the holiday season."
"Leaves a lingering sweet aftertaste. Love it, but dont leave it."
"Damn, this surprised the hell out of me. Very easy to drink and one of the best bocks I've ever had."
"I've been wanting to try this beer for quite some time, but for some reason it hasn't shown up in North Carolina until now. Pours a brilliant, opaque mahogany color with a billowy tan head that retains impeccably. The aroma doesn't disappoint, with a strong molasses and brown sugar sweetness upfront, along with some burnt bread, dark fruits. and roasted almonds. The taste begins with a molasses and caramel sweetness, along with some dark fruits and rye bread, a mineral-like hop flavor, and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly rich, with moderate carbonation and excellent drinkability. Overall an excellent bock, glad to see this one in North Carolina"
"D: A good beer, at times when I've had it before it had an annoying metallic tinge, there are times when I really like the flavour, and other times when I think it's nothing special, but overall, it's a solid piece of work."
"The aroma was hop dominated for me. The taste was smooth and malt up front with a hop flavor on the back end. There was wasn't much mouth feel on this one. Not a bad effort and is worth another shot."
"Jk"
"Nice solid drinking beer. Absolutely fits in with the quality of this brewers other beers. Unique in its flavors that separate it from the others, and mark it as distinctively Anchor."
"Drinkability: this beer was quite enjoyable. I had two in the session, and could have easily had another one. Worth picking this one up."
"Drinkability is not high for me. The sourness lowers drinkability for me."
"Feels syrupy and thick. Has a sharp little bite on the back of the tongue. Ashy and substantial. Good, but not great. Strong and sweetly roasted."
"The taste is just what I was looking for tonight. Tons of complex malt character, but without going overboard with the palate assault. This is an excellent 'small' beer for those who've been worn out and need a break from the speedways and old ruffians of the winter-beer world. One of my favorite offerings from Anchor. I'll gladly grab a sixer of this anytime I come across it."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of deep brown, with nice tan a head - nose of sweet malt, coco, and some dark fruit  taste of cappuccino, and malt simple but good- body is medium, dry and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of cappuccino, and dark milk chocolate"
"According to the cryptic dating scheme, this was bottled on 12/14/06, so it's about 1 year old at drinking. It has a dark brown body with a touch of tan head. The smell is sweet and malty and almost has a scotch aroma to it. Nice malty flavor with no detectable hop bitterness. The flavor just doesn't have the intensity I would like it to, and that could possibly be attributed to the age of the beer. The body is fairly light for the color, probably around light medium body. Not a bad beer, but malt driven beers aren't my cup of tea."
"I am not very familiar with the bock style but understand that Anchor makes pretty classic beer of every style. This is no exception."
"What a delicious brew. There is a bitter coffee taste up front, followed up by a sweet chocolate and caramel flavor. A slight fruitiness is in there as well. Hops are present, but reserved. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, and well-carbonated. Another spot-on performance by Anchor. Recommended highly."
"d: interesting beer given the porter-like qualities and tartness, just not one i'll be looking for again"
"I don't know about this one. On one hand there are nice blackberry and licorice flavors. On the other hand it reminds me of Sharpie Magnum markers - you know, those really big ones in the silver metal casing. Other people around me seemed to like it, so maybe this is just me. Otherwise it had a nice, mild aroma and smooth body."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not that filling for the style, decent kick, good representation of style and certainly more flavorful than most other Bocks. This is a style that Ive found to be pretty mediocre from the beers that Ive had in it so far. However, this beer has restored my faith that there can be some good beers in it. Its well-worth drinking for a while and even though it may not be my first choice on a given evening, its definitely one of the best Bocks that Ive had."
"A dark brown color with hints of red along the sides of the glass. A two finger thick head forms, and is beige in color. The head gradually fades away. The sweet fragrance of malt strikes out at first scent, then it is followed by hints of chocolate and touches sweet spices. The malt and the chocolate hit the palate with strong flavor, a gradual spiciness grows and it finishes with a soft taste of bitterness. A very rich mouthfeel, I was expecting something a little more lighter, not that there is anything wrong with that, it slides it way across the palate for a very clean finish. This is really the first bock beer, that I have ever sat back and really enjoyed and appreciated. This was very drinkable and very smooth, hopefully there more like this beer."
"Recommended. A nice bock, despite the fact that the roasted character probably isn't completely true to the style."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a large head. Caramel, malt and chocolate dominate the aroma. The taste is sweet and also reminiscent of caramel and chocolate. The beer is full and slightly chewy. Overall, the deep malt flavors and full body of the beer compliment each other well, making this a delicious treat."
"Ultimately this is a good experience, but it's not the best bock ever. Just a little uneven and unconvincing in spots. I'm not dying for another but I'm glad to have tried it."
"Pours a very nice deep brown, almost black. Decent head that fades to some good lacing and a nice layer of white bubbles across the whole surface of the beer. Smells slightly sweet some deep coffee malts. Taste is very deep with some nice warming alcohol flavors along with some coffee and toasted malt flavors. Slight lingering alcohol aftertaste, with a sticky, dry finish. Mouthfeel is slightly acidic but crisp yet deep. Drinkability isn't the best, because of the alcohol quality and heavy nature of the beer. Overall a solid brew. More akin to a sweet Porter than anything else, in my opinion, but good nonetheless. Its not exactly a staple, but I'd pick it up again in a few months."
"Could not drink many of these at all"
"This beer pour a neary opaque blackish-brown color. The head is one inch in height, light tan in color, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of nuts, cream, chocolate, and caramel with a hint of nutmeg. The taste is of creamier than the aroma with a nice mildly spicy finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonatnion, and a velvety texture. Overall, I would certainly drink this agian."
"Drinkability: Despite the poor taste and the awkward mouthfeel, it was actually pretty easy to down. I wouldn't want it again, but there are other bocks that just don't sit as well flowing down the palate."
"Pours a dark brown with some amber hues and a small tan head. Strong sweet aroma with some brown sugar, molasses, cocoa, dark,cnadied fruit and a touch of licorice. More dark, chocolate and bready malts, sweet caramelized sugar in the taste. A slightly, bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium with a dry finish. This beer is good but the sweetness and dryness bring down drinkability slightly. Good beer from Anchor, but what else would you expect."
"Another fine beer. I still don't think this brewery makes a bad beer."
"Drinkability- Hmmm.. Not so much. I can drink this, but I don't see a session happening right away. And I was looking forward to it too with that cute goat on the label."
"I tried this beer on August 21, 2007 at the 'Beer Bistro' in Toronto. The beer poured dark brown into a tulip glass with a thin brownish head. The aroma was malty with hints of nuts and caramel. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, with sharp carbonation. The flavour was malty with hints of chocolate and caramel."
"Very pleasant."
"Although I wouldn't consider it a bock, it is still a really smooth beer. I would compare it to an English Porter, though. If it was called an English Porter it would have earned somewhere around a 4.2 - 4.3."
"If the label had said ""Anchor Stout," or ""Anchor Porter"" I would have called this a perfect beer. But it's labeled as a bock. Shouldn't that mean more malty sweetness? I'm very confused by this beer. I like it, but it confuses me."
"The texture starts luxurious then thins significantly. Quite symbolic of this beer, which starts as a rock-solid A-grade bock, and ends up as a B, at best."
"D- This beer is good, but I would love to try it ontap. I felt like I was missing something. The hops were in the backround, but I did not feel like did this beer justice. I will look for it when it comes around again."
"A bit on the restrained side, but well executed. A little sweeter than average for the style, but not overdone. Brown sugar and a hint of toffee head up the malt profile, with some nondescript bittering following suit to balance out. Finish is clean, with the malt sweetness fading into slightly lingering bitterness. Sharp carbonation. A nice example of the style."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom brown glass bottle, with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Drinkability is good pretty solid bock tasty even though aroma is slightly muted."
"This is yet another nice brew from Anchor. Nice flavour that's got balance and a bit of a kick to it without being over the top. Definitely worth your time and money. Try it."
"The body is medium with a fairly sharp carbonation No alcohol flavor. Easy to put down a few, even when the weather is warm."
"A decent drinker. Not as much sweetness coming from the malt as i expected. I can feel the 5.5% ABV on the way down, which is kind of surprising also. I good beer to give a try."
"Good call but not great."
"M/D: great beer, almost pumped up the score some more butdecided to be a little conservative. the mouthfeel is a strong medium with some delicious creamy goodness. a beer i must revisit."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color bock with a rather large off-white foamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of rich and sweet malt is domination and quite pleasant if maybe a bit strong for the style. Taste is also dominated by rich and sweeter then expected malt. Body is full with some adequate carbonation. Interesting take on the style but a bit too sweet for the style IMHO."
"Notes: Nice job, Anchor, as usual. A pretty standard palette of flavors executed expertly by a great brewery. A great prototypical example of a bock, but don't expect anything exciting."
"D - it's drinkable, but not a session beer, for me, anyway."
"Not really a bock, a bit too little alcohol and maybe a bit too bitter according to style. But who cares, really? Still a nice beer and very drinkable."
"A bit overcarbonated, which mutes the flavor somewhat. Still, there is plenty of solid sweet malt and some prune or fig hints for fruitiness. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth in spite of the excess bubbles. I like this beer but if they allowed the flavor to avoid carbonation strangulation it would be divine."
"A pleasant way to start off the Invite, and a pleasant score for Anchor Bock. What will be next in the Unorganized Invitational? Find out..."
"Eh, I've had better. The taste is its main downfall. It needs more malt flavor and a little more sweetness. It's not bad, but I probably won't get it again. You can do better for the price."
"overall impression is lacking, but dig abit deeper and it shows sum promise...pours a dark ruby brown...low head..some promising lacing...smell is actually quite fine...taste is damn muddled, no balance..aftertaste for a bock is frightening...needs more taste, more sweetness, maybe even more hops..but it REALLY needs more alcohol too... a good beer but overall abit disappointing!"
"Poured into a glass mug, chilled, it pours a dark, malty brown color with two fingers of tan, spongy head that seems to cling to the glass nicely. Decent sustainance. Aroma is mostly of brown, sweet malt. I get the sense of a little chocolate malt there along with some slight grass hoppiness that hits my nose as well. Sipping reveals a boasting malty flavor of some slight bakers' chocolate along with some grassy notes from the hops. Some slight vanilla detected on the initial sip along with a nice smooth body. Very easy drinking. Carbonation is nicely balanced, and this makes an awesome session brew. thanks sulldaddy!"
"Having read quite a bit about this beer, it had been on my 'must try' list for quite a while. It was one of the few beers that held up the the anticipation. It's a nice deep brown color, almost light-coffee, with a thick tan head. Beautiful lace. The aroma is one of the aspects of the beer that is the most appealing. It's full of malt scents. Barley and caramel. One of the first impressions is of high quality malted milk balls. There's a bit of chocolate, and a little grain. It's got a little roasted character, with no fruit of malt in the aroma. Great! The flavor is complex, sweet, and satisfying. Full and satisfying. I truly enjoyed this beer, and would certainly seek it out again."
"Overall it's quite good, nice and big for the style. Not the easiest sipper but a good beer for the style."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Let it flatten out a bit tho."
"Paid $1.59 for a bottle. Nice looking bottle - goat eating a hop plant. Same Anchor bowling-pin shaped bottle too. Pours dark black walnut stained color. Big tan head on top that doesn't go away. Smell is strong malt, roastiness, slight hop presence. Taste is smooth, easy on the palate with a lot of flavor. Some roasted malt, a bit of burnt coffee, a lot of sweetness. Maybe a touch watery. There is a slightly drying characteristic to this beer in the mouthfeel. Carbonation is right on the money, balances nicely with a decent FG, though I think this could've been a bit higher."
"D - Very drinkable...this would be a great session beer with a full flavor and smooth mouthfeel. Another great offering from Anchor."
"Overall, I am not one to sit down with a bunch of bocks, but this one is pretty nice. I think it has some very nice characteristics that gives it a distinct flavor that i wouldnt mind having again...when wanting a semi-mild bock."
"Drinkability: An above average, readily available American bock. A good introduction to the style."
"Good body and appropriate carbonation. This was certainly not what I expected. Very enjoyable, however could use a bit more sweetness for me."
"Serve some of this at a backyard BBQ"
"bock light ? easy drinking and a decent beer but just an OK bock."
"This brew poured to a brown color that has mahogany highlights. Had a nice sized tan head that had good retention and left a fair amount of lacing. The nose highlights caramel, burnt sugar, molasses, and dark fruit. I would imagine that I am missing a bunch, but what I am picking up is very enticing. The taste highlights, while are similar to the aroma just come out more and add so much to the experience. The caramel, molasses, brown/burnt sugar flavors come out intermingling in a fantastic brew. At the tail end a hop flavor is there giving a slight but perfect amount of bitterness while a chocolate flavor seems to come and go quickly. I was actually not expecting all of these flavors to come out, this brew really impresses me and I cant believe that this is my first exposure to it. The feel is quite dry, an excellent brew all around."
"Appearance is a clear dark ruby with an extremely generous dark khaki colored head which remains well throughout. Lacing is very sticky around entire glass from start to finish. Smell is a bit weak but has hints of chocolate, toffee, and toasted nuts. Taste is a clean malt overtone with a very fine hop finish. More of a toasted flavor than anticipated, but enjoyable. Mouthfeel is so smooth but has a bit of a tingle to it. Carbonation seems to be there quite a bit throughout, but doesn't distract from this amazing bock. If you're a fan of Bocks, Anchor does an amazing job of representing this style of beer."
"This beer is the color of gumbo roux (in the jar) and has no real head. It has a great nose of figs, prunes, plumbs, and pound cake. The taste is thin and cidery, with a little roastiness and a nice herbal hop bitter in the backend. Medwiehgt mouthfeel fluffs up with crabonation."
"D: I could definitely drink several of these. Really good overall Bock"
"D: A rich flavor dominates this brew and due to this quality, I could only drink this in moderation. One is good and two would be the limit. Nice complex flavor. Another fine effort by Anchor."
"Really deep hued mahogany, that looks near black, and not unlike their porter considering this is a bock...cloud like tight bubbled two fingered head from a rather gentle pour - nice. Aroma is an American twist in hops on a German style base...the hops are piney and citric but sweet malts are detectable, inviting and very 'anchor.' Taste is on par stylistically and again a distinctly anchor beer, which I'd say is not unlikely due to the yeast. It's delicious, but the alcohol is detectable, very rose like. Wheat is present but not overwhelming, and the hops are light but just enough for me while not at all bordering on a sugar bomb. Mouthfeel is full! Smooth carbonation again characteristic of anchor. Overall nothing to swoon over despite the high scores, unless you really love this style, in which case, this is an outstanding must-have version."
"D - This is a very fine example of the Bock style. It's got everything right where it needs to be, without any extra bravado that might spoil the balance. Excellently drinkable, and a staple for any fan of the style."
"Drinkability: Not an everyday purchase for me due to cost, but it was on sale so I picked up a couple of different Anchor products. I definitely enjoyed the six I have had, and would look for it again next spring."
" It's hard to believe that this beer is 5.50% ABV, as it seems like a winter warmer at times. I can feel the alcohol, but it doesn't detract from the taste of the mouthfeel. There isn't any espresso or cocoa here, so this goes down a lot easier than any stout or porter would. This is another great offering from one of my favorite breweries, and a shame that this is the only solidly crafted Bock that I've ever had. No matter - the ones that I have remaining in my fridge are a more than adequate way to make up for the lack of this style, and to welcome in the new season!"
"Very nice American bock. Tasty, complex and fulfilling. You can't ask for too much more in a good beer. This goes down very easy and at only 5.5% alcohol you can enjoy a few of these, which IMO makes a great session beer. Great Spring offering."
"12oz stubby brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a dark brown with a big head, OK longevity and good lace. Rich malt aromas mixed with a fair amount of roasted malts and a hint of hops. Big and rich and malty with a decent amount of roasted malts leaving a nice roasted bitterness in the aftertaste. A very good beer but IMHO too much roasted malts. Slightly above average for the style - mainly due to the roasted falvor but a very good beer none the less."
"Pours a dark, reddish coffee color with molasses highlights at the edges. Small head that fades to a collar. Rich aroma of creamy coffee, sweet malts and savory spice... very smooth, sumptuous and inviting. Great aroma. On the palate, the nose is reprised, albeit with the addition of a touch of brown fruit and a slight, highly complementary alcohol burn. Very smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation -- that is, enough to tickle the tongue a bit and keep things fresh, but not enough to fill the mouth and create the sensation of greater weight/volume. Overall, this is a wonderful bock. It's not over the top -- just moderate weight, ABV, and hefty-but-nuanced flavors."
"Pours a clear ruby-brown with a thick, foamy tan head leaving thick leaves of lace as it drinks down. The smell is wonderful with dark bread and orange peel dominating. Taste is roasted malt reminiscent of dark bread followed by a mild orange sweetness and finished with a bittersweet (almost chocolate) flavor. Very nicely flavored. This is a very drinkable spring brew and one that I will continue to look out for."
"Very good beer although a bit against the grain for a bock. Poured with a huge, thick, foamy, frothy, tan head and lots of lace. Opaque brownish black color. Very mild aroma. Not too sweet; quite roasty, a little dark, ripe fruit and a bit of an edge from the acid of carbonation. Mouth filling body. Easy finish. Perhaps a bit much for a session beer."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice dry roasted scent that boasts of crystal malts and lager yeast. It has a light malt sweetness along with some fruity yeast esters. The taste is good. It has a smooth malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and toastey. This is a solid brew that is true to style. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer with good malt character."
"When I first had this beer I was unimpressed. It was colder than it should have been, lacked head retention (probably a dirty glass), and without releasing some of it's carbonation, 'twas a bit gassy and harsh on the tongue. The caramel flavor was reduced, or perhaps I should say concentrated, as its full breadth of character was masked by the cold. Once warmed a bit it's wonderful. It's not quite traditional, but quite nice in its own right. Well done and worth trying!"
"Bottom line: This is a very good example of the style. I recommend it!"
"Flavor has some characteristic Anchor elements to it: almost sharp cleanliness, solid malt profile and a subtle but well balanced hop bite. The brew has an almost bitter tinge that I find rather enjoyable. This one is every bit as drinkable as their other offerings. Nice and quenching. Quite sessionable. Glad I tried it."
"This beer exhibits much of what I like about Anchor's beers. They are always very flavorful and extremely clean. A lot to brag about, and very drinkable. Looks very clear with a tan, loosely knit head retention. A strong toasty malt character shows boldly in the nose and flavors. Hop aromas shadow the malts closely and nearly compete with the grains. Simple, without a lot of muddled flavors; roasted coffee and chocolate with a whisp of a finish. Hop flavor takes on grassy and pine notes and ride well into the finish. The body is lighter than the flavors would make you think, but again, this leads to good drikability. The hops kick the beer out of syle a bit, but then that would not be the Anchor Steam way; but adds to the crispness of the brew. The grains, however, do take on chalky and astringent proportions late, but does little to interfere with the favorable qualities of the beer."
"Not bad. Not overly impressive, but certainly pleasant. I don't think it's tremendously faithful to style, but it's got a sort of hoppy-schwarzbier appeal."
"Opinion: Well, this is a pretty good beer, but I wouldn't put it in the German Bock category. It is pretty light and would lean more toward an American Bock or maybe a Dunkel. If you put it next to Shiner, this is a pretty good beer, but if you put it next to an Einbecker Ur-Bock...it falls way short. I would drink it again, but I would not seek it out."
"I should note that the wheat malt was very noticeable in this beer. I think if they cut back on it a bit, it would be a much more enjoyable brew, but still a decent option if you see it around."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The aggressive carbonation that lashes the tongue right at the outset is quickly subdued, replaced with a creamy and mouth-filling experience that really lets this beer open up. By the time this bottle is near complete, it's a dream. Lush and beautifully full. For this quirky style, it's quite hoppy in the finish... yet retrained in strength enough to have more than one and not be set back by its sweetness. An interesting American example of a Bock."
"Overall impression: Interesting .. a bit different than I would expect from a bock, but still a drinkable and interesting example."
"Full, creamy mouthfeel emphasizes the positive attributes of the beer allowing it to spread across the palate evenly. An above-average, satisfying bock. I'd have another but wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"D - Overall very plesant and quite drinkable for a richly flavored beer."
"From Safeway in Eureka, CA this one set me back $8.99 so I was hoping for something worth the price. Poured a very rich and dark red to brown with a nice fat tan head that faded fairly quickly and left good lacing in the glass. Nose of malts, caramel, chocolate, and fruits. Mouthfeel is fairly rich and creamy, and flavors are bitter malts, caramel, and hops. Finish slightly bitter. This is a well balanced brew. Worth the price."
"D- The bitterness at the finish balances the dry malt flavors nicely with a good complexity that really comes through when it warms and a very light sweetness in the background that adds depth. One of the better bocks I have tried."
"On tap at Cole's tonight,came to the table a deep ruddy brown with a thinner but tight almond colored head.Roasted aromas like that of roasted nuts and caramel malt,flavors are on the drier side quite earthy and roasted the healthy dose of hops provide a drier earthy almost spicey feel to the beer an underlying molasses-like sweetness comes thru but the dry earthy tones prevail.A different sort of bock in my mind one with an American hopped up twist with its drier earthy character but quite nice."
"It is a little different for the style but something I quite enjoyed and will do so in the future."
"A bland Bock stylistically. The rich and creamy malt flavors seem to fade rather quickly leaving the airy wheat taste that does nothing for this Anchor offering."
"Good session brew with the 5.5%, but a tad expensive at $9.25 a sixer  for us Midwesterners."
"Pours a clear dark brown mahogany color with a bit of ruby highlights and a very thick meringue-like head that rises an inch above the rim of the glass with no spillage. A very lovely looking beer. Nose is chocolaty malt, buttery pecan, and toasted walnuts along with a touch of brown sugar. Malt dominates the taste with a semi-sweet dark chocolate flavor. The nuttiness that was in the aroma is much more subdued in the taste, but there are additional fruity notes of fig, dates, and prunes. A drying bitterness comes across in the finish to cleanse the palate before the next sip. Highly enjoyableI will be buying more very soon."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Not bad. From the website: Bock has come to mean a beer darker and stronger than the brewery's regular brew. Agreed. However, I wouldnt say this is an improvement on their Porter, which is truly top notch. Im glad to have tried it, but Anchor should make a meatier brew for their Bock."
"Thick 2 fingers of creamy tan head. Reddish brown color. Smells bready and sweet malty. Nice big malt flavor, sweet caramel and a bit toasty. Nice hop bitterness and earthy hop flavor to balance the malt. Medium bodied with med-high carbonation. This beer is very tasty and very drinkable. I could drink this all night."
"Overall, I could see drinking a six of this in one night. Alot better than other bocks available in this area, and a great addition to Anchors offerings."
"Another solid brew from the amazing Anchor brewery. I first had this last year at the brewery tour, and this year's version tastes just as good as I remember."
"Cheers!"
"Recommended!"
"D - Not bad, but nothing I'd go out of my way to purchase again. This beer brings to mind a story attributed to Charles Kuralt about the stength of coffee as one travels west in the U.S. Seems the pioneers reused their coffee grounds as they headed westward. Therefore, the strength of the coffee even today seems to dissipate as one travels west through the country. My point being that it appears the bock style here has tranformed accordingly en route westward to San Francisco, taking on some of the west coast philosophies in lieu of the typical German bock profile."
"M&D - smooth and sweet with well balanced bitterness, an easy down bock and a good example of the style. Anchor upholds their steeped tradition of world class beers, well done Anchor."
"I don't know what to think about this beer. It seems too dark to be a bock, seems more like a dopplebock or something. It's still a delicious beer, no matter what category you put it in."
"Looks more like a stout than a bock. But still maintains. Very deep brown, red hue. Can't see any bubbles, but has a good ring of foam after the pour. Very light and asymetrical lacing. Good, dark looking bock. The aroma makes me think of a true German bock, but with some stronger hop influence. Toatlly awesome and different. I smell malty blankets of yeast and barn yard with a bunch of intermingling bitterness and roasted malts. Great balance. The taste is just as unique. Very malty and roasty, but not high in the fruity malts that I'm used to in most bocks. A little dry roasted mlats with a few hints of dried prunes and apricots. But then some medium bitterness mixes with the fruits and the mlats. Very different. This is an awesome session beer. I wish I didn't have to go to Indy to get this stuff."
"Drinks alright, just too many non conventional bock flavors in this critter, almost makes think of their holiday ale. If you're not too anal about taste profiles this ain't a bad beer, but I expected a lot more from anchor"
"Pours out a rich looking purplish ruby colored dark brown with a khaki head that clings to the glass. Nose is toasty and of caramelized malts with a healthy amount of herbal hops. Starts off with caramel and a sort of thin malt body which leads into a middle of herbal hops and their bitterness. Finishes a bit too roasty for me and kind of lactic. Dry. Mouthfeel is kind of thin for me. Solid drinkability despite its flaws. I would drink this again, but when faced with the price of a 6 of Anchor beer, I'll stick to Liberty, Steam, or Old Foghorn."
"Solid, but nothing wowing."
"Despite all the strong flavours, this one was surprisingly drinkable."
"Pours a very dark clear ruby/mahogony with a huge tan foamy head. The head looks ""Guiness"" like with great lacing. The smell is light with dark fruit aromas and coffee. The taste is very stout like with coffee,some chocolate,dark fruit, and bitter hops. The m/f is light with all flavors mixing well makes this a pretty decent beer from a great brewery."
"Pours a deep orange-brown color, topped by a small light tan head that quickly dissipates to a thin coating. Aroma of very sweet, lightly roasted malt and some mildly fruity hops. Palate is sweet dark malt up front, calling up notes of dark fruit and a touch of brown sugar. An off flavor of mild diacetyl peeks through now and again, but is not overwhelming. Finish is sweet and bready. Body is a little thin, like a decent bock should be. Not my favorite bock or my favorite Anchor offering, but a decent effort."
"Beer poured very dark with ruby undertones. The head is brown and very sturdy. Nose is primarily sweet malts and perhaps a hint of dark fruit. Taste is very malty, somewhat sweet, with some hints of that dark fruit; finish is with a very dry but light hop. Mouthfeel is smooth and mellow, the beer goes down nice and easy. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a well crafted brew that has a degree of complexity that is very interesting."
"Pretty drinkable, though I'm not sure the flavors suit me well enough to have more than one at a time."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, thin along the palate, and astringent."
"Drinkability: Won't be the last time this one goes down, for sure. A winner from a pioneer of the microbrew phenomenon we are thankfully privy to."
"Not a half-bad boch here. The flavors start out somewhat dissapointing in the beginning of a taste, but toward the middle and finish they come through nicely. A light and refreshing mouthfeel helps this beer as well. Recommended."
"Mouth is lightly carbonated and thick. A nice interpretation of the style indeed."
"Taste: Plenty of malt body and well dosed carbonation, it does have a bit of a vegetal taste to it, but I didn't really see it as such a bad thing. Kind of like bitter rhubarb, and the malt sweetness tames the harshness of it. But it's the finish that I didn't like, as it was ashy, something I don't like at all, at least not at this level."
"Pours a five finger tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Opaque black/brown color. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Molasses nose. Starts with a roasted chocolate/burnt oak flavor, finish is dry bitter chocolate. Really this is a bock with balls. $1.55 for a 12oz bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"D - Drinkable. This is a pretty tasty bock from Anchor, recommend for sure."
"This is really worth a try. Seems like a versatile food beer, too. I bet it would be great with something involving bacon and mushrooms."
"Taste was roasted and dry, nothing like the sweet smell, just dry. The dark malts give the beer a good maltbitter, and there is a good hopbitter in there too. The special malts really add to the taste, giving ot complexity and body, which is medium. In my opinion this is a true bockbeer, according to the guidelines."
"Overall, I think this is a very good rendition of this style, give it a try if you get the chance."
"Pours very dark, nearly opaque black/brown. Medium head of hearty brown bubbles. Aroma is of caramelized malt. Taste follows suit. Medium body, on the light side for the style. Nice roasted grain quality to cut the sweetness. Roasted quality comes out even more in the after taste. A bit dry for a bock. Well made and well balanced bock. Easy to drink and looks great in the glass."
"Even at the end of this review, I am still unsure where Bocks fit into the whole scheme of things. I try to put brews into a roy-g-biv spectrum of the rainbow in my mind, where styles overlap in shades and blend into the next: but for the life of me I still cant place bocks. My best guess would be somewhere between porters and abbot ales. The closest thing I have had to this is Stepan Razin Porter (which makes me believe Stepan Razin isnt really a porter, which I have always felt, maybe its just labeled as such for the US market?) I am setting my sights on figuring this style out, it won't be long before I try it again . . ."
"Pretty drinkable for a Bock- the dryness avoids any lingering sticky feel and makes this quite sessionable."
"I haven't had a great deal of bock experience, but I recognize quality beer when I taste it. Anchor Bock is a truly wonderful effort from a brewery that specializes in brewing 'gold standards' and is one of my new favorites of the style."
"Drinkability is very high every thing here leads you to want another. MK"
"On tap at Anchor Brewing during a recent tour. Great overall taste on this one, great beer! Its a newer beer for them, and they have hit the nail on the head with this one. Not as heavy or sweet as their barleywine, but just as enjoyable to drink. Recommended to anyone wanting a slightly thicker, more complex darker beer."
"I am not necessarily a big fan of the bock style in general, but this is quite tasty- I like it!"
"Anchor's dark beers have been appearing on my table at Christmas dinner for some years now. This one pours with thick, creamy foam, brownish in color. The color of the beer is reddish, dark brown. Smelling sweet, with hints of fruits and coffee. The taste is bitter with roasted hops and bubble-gum. It almost has a powder-like mouthfeel. It definately measures up to Anchor quality, although the tastes could be a bit more pronounced."
"This is a decent bock... wouldn't be a first choice, but highly drinkable."
"The look was kind of blah, but beginning at the aroma, it redeemed itself nicely, carrying a flavor that seems dependable and lip-smacking good. I had one, but had I not had kids in tow, I would gladly have had another, and it would have been every bit as good as the first. This is the kind of beer that makes bock season a joy...it's basic but fairly complex, and goes down smooth and mellow. That's a fine Springtime scenario."
"Never did see this on the east coast, nor had I really known about it, so I had to grab a bottle of this upon finding it in CA. Crimson brown with a well held tan head. Spicy nose hints at plums and licorice. Flavor is really toasty with very nice complexity; subtle coffee, plums, an enormous chewy malt profile and a fair smattering of hops on the palate make this one interesting brew. Kind of reminds me of their OSA without the pine/spruce element, but still has a flavor profile all its own. Extremely drinkable at 5.5% as well. I'd be happy drinking stein after giant stein of this one."
"D- i see this as a nice to try every season it comes around. I dont plan on stocking it in my fridge. Awesome play on the bock style."
"Poured a very deep brown color with impressive reddish notes. Smell is loaded with malt infused with a nice dark fruitiness (raisins, figs, dates, prunes). taste is fruity sweet with the prune and dates really showing through. Finish is initially very sweet but a pleasant hoppy bitterness begins to assert itself. A very nice creamy mouthfeel is the perfect ending for this beer. Great drinkability. Really a winner."
"Upon the beers disemboguing the 12-ounce stubby bottle a deep chocolate brown with a massive creamy dark tan head that ever so slowly erodes leaving a thick blanket of lace upon the glass. Nose has a molasses like sweetness, big malt aroma, hints of hops and a bit of chocolate to this old schnozzle, start is somewhat sweet with a good grain presence, the top moderate in feel. Finish is lightly acidic, the hops pleasant in the spiciness, very dry aftertaste, a throwback to the old Bocks like Pabst."
"Pours a rich, dark mahogany color with a frothy and sticky 2"" head. Aroma is roasted malts, with chocolate and toasted bread notes. Taste is sweet maltiness up front, with a mild alcohol kick mid-sip, and an ever so slight hop bitterness. This beer finishes VERY indeed, nothing lingering afterwards....very nice! Not a huge fan of this style, but this is one beer that will have me trying a few others."
"Very drinkable."
"Put it all together and you got yourself one swell Bock. Delicious enough to sip, but not too strong that you HAVE to sip."
"Drinkability: Pair this with figs (or Fig Newtons). It really brings out the chocolate and rum flavors beautifully."
"Dark coffee color, with red hues as you can see through it in the light, revealing nice clarity. The slim head doesn't last long at all, and leaves a very faint ring in its wake. Aroma of tangy brown malt, sweet with licorice, nut, and brown sugar notes. Flavor is of clean, nutty sweet malt, slightly tangy in the finish. There is a slight roasted character present and perhaps a hint of cherries. Mouthfeel is decent, medium thick, adequate carbonation. This is fairly mild, with solid, clean flavors for a darker beer, making it an excellent choice for a session ale. Another fine offering from Anchor..."
"Clear, deep chestnut with ruby highlights. The light brown head left behind some clumpy lacing. Rich, malty sweet aroma with caramel and a bit of chocolate character, also mild alcohol and a hint of hops. There's a hint of roast that adds to these qualities in the flavour, along with a bit of toffee and apple core. Light lingering bitterness and malt. The body was a little lighter than expected, but certainly not approaching thin. Fairly dry with low carbonation. One that I'd definitely give another try. Thanks HogTownHarry!"
"If you don't like Chocolate under no circumstances try this beer you will hate it. This is classed as a bock but it is much like a thicker and heartier version of Anchors Christmas beer. To me this is really a Milk Stout and a damn good one too. I won't quibble about the adherence to style, which this doesn't really do. This is simply a damn tasty beer."
"Mahogony colour with mocha head, lots of lace. Molasses and chocolate malt aroma. Creamy and tongue tingle. Molasses and roast coffee aftertaste with coffee oil slickness. Bittersweet. Medium-full mouthfeel. It all works together, and would have again."
"Would buy again and could session this beer."
"Warm and comforting in the mouth, easily drinkable, tenaciously tasty...I like it, I like it...Good roast for a bock. I'd like to have this again, and again...very smooth, and luscious on the palate, an expertly brewed bock."
"Drinkability: This is definately my favorite offering from Anchor. Full of flavor with a nice texture. It's sweet and mostly to style. Very tasty though it is a bit low in ABV for a bock. No matter, this is a tasty beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with a slight creaminess and good carbonation. Fills the mouth nicely and satisfies the beer craving without incident. This is a bock I'd look for more often if it was available. Hopefully Anchor will put this out again with wider distribution. Another feather in the cap of one of the original microbrewers! Thanks to irishsnake for the opportunity!"
"Overall: I had heard and read of this only 6 or so months ago, but it seems that it does not travel far from its home turf up in the wilds of the West Coast Bay Area, either that or it is a limited offering. I actually snagged this flasche at Bottle Barn, Santa Rosa for just $2.59 - pretty good value and a nice brew, despite warnings from one of my highly respected fellow BAs, I quite enjoyed this!"
"Pours a dark coke colour, with a creamy tan head. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and body is light. Very nice bock. Sweet, caramel, coffee, roasted flavours. A good amount of firm hoppy bitterness. Very drinkable. Overall a great beer to quaff. Just the right amount of alcohol. Wonderful bock imo."
"Warm and comforting in the mouth, easily drinkable, tenaciously tasty...I like it, I like it...Good roast for a bock. I'd like to have this again, and again...very smooth, and luscious on the palate, an expertly brewed bock."
"Drinkability: May have been better fresh. No off flavors or alcohol noted. Nice but there are better examples out there. Probably wouldn't consider re-visiting."
"I was quite fond of this one, and it is so rare too! I found it at BevMo in Berkeley when I visisted, and am happy to have picked it up."
"Like Wetcoaster I was surprise to see this offered at my local Whole Foods Market, didnt know Anchor made a Bock. My only previous experience with the style was the in my opinion, vastly overrated Celebrator, still I decided to try it. Deep copper color was topped by a tan head that displayed excellent retention. Lacing was in nice sheets, lots of it. Aroma was sweet malt and a bit of burnt or roasted notes. Smooth taste profile, malty, subtle hopping and a slight roasted tone. Medium thick mouthfeel, and a very drinkable dark beer. Not bad and I think I'll have it again."
"Good first effort, but it needs some tweaking before Celebrator needs to worry."
"Bottle provided by wezil, ala BIF20. Thanks for the opportunity! Freshness date is 5YM and consumed in July 2005. Pours a half finger walnut brown head over a very dark brown liquid. The edges are cloudy dark ruby red when head to a bright light. Smells richly of sweet caramel and toffee. Some chocolate and a gentle hint of alcohol. Tastes chocolatey with a rough grassy hop edge. I do get some citrusy hop character, but can't identify the type specifically. Hop bitter is quite strong and the aftertaste is rough grassy. Not what I was expecting from a bock...I anticipated a caramally sweet beer. Caramel is only found with searching and actually comes across as toffee. As the beer has warmed I get some roast flavor during the draw and before the swallow that I think contributes to what I was perceiving as hop bitter. To style, I'd place this as a sweet stout. Medium mouthfeel (and slightly creamy) and moderately carbonated."
"Poured a bit too aggressively into a standard beer mug -- the head is Godzilla-like, ruddy tan in color with excellent retention. The body is rich brownish crimson with maroon highlights when held to the light. Smell: Molasses, orange zest, green apple peel, sourdough -- full and complexly layered. Taste: Citrus zest bitterness upfront, followed by a sprinkle cocoa quickly eclipsed by a stronger hop presence (crusty, delicious); a nice grain profile unfolds, thick; some grape and apple sweetness dances in the background. Aftertaste is a well paced stretch of bitterness over top the still lingering puddles of bright sweetness. Mouthfeel: Perfectly round, a little chewy, middling carbonation. Pretty damn good."
"It pours an incredibly dark ruby brown; so dark it appears black when not held to the light. A 3 finger lighttan head sits atop, falling to a finger over top. The nose is pretty nice. I get a blast of piney and spicey hop over a chunky malt backbone of roasted nutty notes. The flavor is a let down. I get an initial bitter when I first sip. It moves to a light roasted to slightly burnt character, but overall, the flavor is light. The feel is light as well. I would like to see a bit more body here. Its not a hard to drink brew, but the lack of flavor just misses for me. Just okay on this one."
"Pours a dark color with a tall head that has decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma first hits me with some pine hops then is followed by some dark malts. Lots of hops in the aroma. The flavor has a moderate dark malt flavor along with a strong pine hop character. The body is very thin for the style and the drinkability is good."
"The smell is nice, bringing dark malts and a rich chocolate smell. The taste is good and solid with plenty of flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit too thin, while the drinkability is good."
"Fruity aromatic notes of raisins and figs waft from my glass as I pour this beer. Pours a deep, dark, amber color that shows ruby notes when held up to the light. As well as the fruitiness I get notes of chocolate, a hint of lightly spicy hops, toasted malt. This is really quite interesting in the nose, it is richly malty. The taste is ever so lightly sweet, it is richly malty compared to the sweetness, which is quite nice. The beer has notes of chocolate, toasted malt, and dark caramel. This beer finishes quite dry, with a lightly astringent note of toasted malt that tends to linger a bit. This note makes you thirsty and ready for another sip. This beer has a fairly light body to it, at least for a bock, it does have a decent amount of mouthcoating maltiness to it though. There is a bit of spiciness to this beer that I would attribute to hops, other than this the beer is pretty low on the hopping scale; there is just enough to make sure the malt is not cloying. This is really quite nice, and is almost a quaffing bock, by which I mean a 22oz bottle is just about the right amount."
"Thanks to irishsnake for the trade samples!!! Pours a deep,mahogany color. Good head-some lacing. Nice aroma. Some malt aroma-definate hop presence in there. Slightly spicy. Flavor lacks the mellow sweetness I would expect in a bock. Definate hop bitterness-finish is somewhat dry. Mouthfeel is ok though a bit thin for a bock. Overall an enjoyable brew. Theres a few things that hold this beer back from really saying ""bock"". A respectable attempt from Anchor however. I have another bottle to sample and may edit or re-review."
"815"
"Had on-tap at Toronado."
"Mouthfeel begins thinner than expected, but matures into an appreciative lightness that lends to drinkability. It will be a true shame if this 700 case offering fails to earn a place in the rotation following OSA."
"John"
"Drinkability- Well, I'm just touching the surface of bocks and enjoying them more each time. This is one of the better ones I have had (which is very few) and one that matches the style better than most. Give it a try."
