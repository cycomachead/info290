3.83,6.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a reddish-brown, with no to very little head. I felt the taste, at the beginning, was crisp to slightly sweet. As the beer warmed slightly, crispness faded. The smell was honey-like. This beer had a full flavor, robust yet refreshing. Seemed lighter than other bocks I have had. I could not taste or feel the alcohol warmth, although the ABV is 6.7 percent. Overall, a beer that is on the upper end of good, and one that enjoyed and will try again.","vw72","Jun 14, 2012"

Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some brown sugar aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, brown sugar, and some slight caramel flavors on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing that really grabs my attention and would make me want another.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 12, 2012"
4.05,12.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O - For the malt-lovers out there, this bock is another easy drinking, very well made lager from Lakefront that features loads of toast and caramel sweet malts with just enough balance to keep it from being cloying. Smooth and drinkable, there's a faint warming sensation of alcohol for those cooler spring evenings.","BeerFMAndy","May 29, 2012"
3.52,-2.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Mahogany color with a flash-in-the-pan head and no real lacing to speak of. Smells and tastes of a toffee malt with decent nuttiness and light presences of milk chocolate. Garnish levels of fruity yeast esters (stone fruit) exists in the background as well. Creamy, smooth medium-heavy body with gentle carbonation. It is difficult to find something to criticize but I do feel that it suffers somewhat from a lack of 'toasted' character. Other than that, it is a somewhat better than average Bock.","WastingFreetime","May 04, 2012"

A thick inch of beige head sits atop my glass. The aroma is caramel malt. Some sweet fruit can be found if you really stick your snooter in there. The flavor is rich and malty. Sugar toast and a cracker like breadiness seems to greet my tastebuds. There's a bitter alcohol bite that hits you when you least expect it as well. Medium to full body that's rich and lightly carbonated. A nice bock overall.","beerwolf77","Jun 05, 2009"

Reddish/Copper/Amber and clear carbs rise nicely in pillars. Smell mostly roasted malts with a touch citrus/fruit. Taste malty upfront a touch hop metal finish. Not very heavy rather light on the carbs. This beer really scratched my spring beer itch. Drinkable as always provincial I favor Lakefront a little - wish I had this sixer a couple weeks ago for the first round of the tourney.","tjkurz","Mar 13, 2009"

It's nice, but if only it were a bit more rounded and not so tangy, it's be much better to me. Smooth feel though.

4.2,16.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I know there's a difference between ""malt"" and ""a malt"" but this reminds me of a little of each. The creaminess is inherent but the caramel is teased in with minimal carbonation and makes a warm puddle of dark liquer in the stomach. It's what I expected of the Eastside (by the same brewer) and didn't receive. Or it could just be the electricity from tonight's thunderstorm ambience which is tricking my tastebuds but I don't think so.","thelagerheads","Apr 07, 2006"
3.52,-2.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Not a bad bock from Lakefront. Pours out to a dark ruby red color with a short lived head of cream colored foam. Medium low carbonation, and a few rings of lace. Aroma is very malty and wreaks of roasted earth, with some sweet grain and wood elements. Solid. Taste is quaffable; toasted bread and malt smooth over to a raw grain note that presents a creamy element of sweetness. Mouthfeel is fair, mild and slightly smooth. Drinkability is average. I've had better in the style, but this isn't bad.","Frozensoul327","May 14, 2005"
4.1,13.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer came in a variety eight pack in which all the beers were dated to the first week in March. So perhaps it is not retired afterall. It pours a black color that is clear around the edges of the glass and opaque in the middle. The head is one finger in height, creamy and recedes rather slowly into a thin cap that covers the entire glass. The aroma is very nice. Chocolate, burnt malt, very sweet overall. The taste of swweet burnt malt with a bit of chocolate and a nice lingeringly sweet finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice, relaxing brew.","KarlHungus","May 11, 2005"

3.35,-7.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,"Clear dark brown color, alost maroon. Not a lot of head, just a thin layer on top of the beer. Good amounts of visible carbonation. Smell is nice and malty, raisins and brown sugar. Taste is rich and full, very malty, but the body is too thin for the style. Alcohol traces and some hops on the finish. Not too bad, could use a little more body, though.","TastyTaste","0"
2.46,-31.9,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"This might be the darkest bock ive had in a while. I dont mind dark beer but I feel they over did it on this one. It might have been the store's fault but I bought this beer and it was already over a year old. Having said that, the beer tasted a little funny. The head was very small but really dark for its size. Almost no lace at all, not that I expected a lot from a bock. Over all just kind of a weird placed beer. It says its for spring but its not a seasonal. Taste more like an ale then anything. I ve tried four lakefront beers now and none of them have impressed me. On the other hand none have been really horrible. In the end I say for the money you could get a good local micro for the same price as a lakefront. Go with the local brew. If lakefront is your local brew... sorry.","RoBotGod","Nov 28, 2004"
4.15,15,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Clear and attractive dark coppery brown appearance, head is yellow ochre in color, flattish but adequate. Wide slipping loop laces. Nice aroma, malty with elements of sweetened cherry and maple syrup, almost like IHOP pancakes. Medium mouthfeel, lower carbonation, shows a thick backbone for an ordinary Bock. Full flavor, a berry sense fights through the brown sugar maltiness, gives a staunch and unchanging flavor profile. Slight burnt quality mid mouth. Finishes full. There seems to be a lot of unmemorable lighter beers in the Bock category, this one stands above them. I really like the aroma here, and stack this one on the list of Lakefront's notable brews.","ADR","Oct 04, 2004"
3.85,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark reddish brown with a short-lived light tan head. Aroma consists of caramel malt, raisin and brown sugar. Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel. The taste exhibits most of the complex flavors you'd find in a decent bock beer. It starts off with a rich caramal malt flavor. Sweet molasses flavor coats the tongue midway and lingers into the long finish. It moves into some vinous tones and that sweet caramel flavor returns in the finish. Hops dry the tongue out toward the end. Lakefront's bock seems a little lighter on the raisin flavor typically found in most bocks. But there are strong vinous tones and you can taste the alcohol flavors appears slightly toward the back. Overall, this was an enjoyable bock and something I'll need to revisit next Spring.","Winter","Sep 21, 2004"
3.65,1.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours out a deep reddish brown - more red than typical bronze coloration. There is a minimal tan head and no discrenible lace effect. The nose is somewhat sweet and toasted. The taste is a sweetish sour flavor that is disconcerting at first but becomes quite nice on the palate as the glass is emptied. The mouthfeel is full and a bit creamy. Good drinkability overall.","AtLagerHeads","Jun 26, 2004"
3.85,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark ruby-brown with a small white-gray head. Smells of toffee and bready malt. Some toasted notes. Taste is rich, rummy sweetness. Malt all the way.

4.35,20.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear dark amber copper color with a thin, firm, dusted brown head. Soft, supple, clean, sweet bready malt nose with touches of brown sugar and molasses. Bold taste, firm grabbing sweet bready malt base thats lightly chewy with a light drying tang that keeps a nice sweet coating in the mouth. Bits of herbalness in a very light hopping sneak through nearer the finish. Close to full body, smooth and clean with a very present sweet tang coating the palate leaving some chewy, nearly cloying effects across the entire tongue. I usually don't enjoy the regular bocks due to having accustomedized my tastes towards the more hefty doppels. This brings to mind of something that Capital might put out, perhaps a cross between the Blonde, Autumnal Fire, and Dark could produce something similar to this; that said, this is a pretty straight up hefty bock that I can finally put some trust in for the style. A fine and tasty lager bock beer by Lakefront.","tavernjef","Apr 08, 2004"

Cinamon bread comes to mind when tasting this. And brown sugar. And molasses. And munich malts. Definitely munich malts here.
