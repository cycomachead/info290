Fits the style of a Bock. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, slight hop, and slight grain.

3.03,-9.6,3.5,3,3,3,3,"On tap in Fort Wayne. 4.95 for a 20 oz. This one comes poured with about a one finger head. The head quickly fades after a sip or two. The malt is the overwhelmingly strong scent in this brew. A hint of chocolate also touches the nose. The taste is nothing exceptional either. The malts taste burned and the chocolate also is there much like the smell in just a hinted version. I get maybe a dash of hops in the taste. The mouthfeel feels light, it's almost as if it's a thin bock. I couldn't drink any more than one of these and wouldn't drink it again. Especially for the price.","tykees88","Dec 28, 2009"

SMELL is non-existent at first, as it was very cold. As it warmed, some grainy chocolate malt aroma, faint esters with a swirl. Takes alot of warming and work to find anything. TASTE follows nose. Grainy, vaguely roasty, faint hints of both sweetness and bitterness. FEEL moderate carbonation, thin body, just a touch of texture. DRINKS pretty easily due to thinness of body.

The transparent mahogany body was a touch thin and watery looking but the head was creamy and pretty for a minute or so before it dissolved to nothing. I took in a heavy aroma of caramel malt with just a slight touch of alcohol sweetness. The taste is surprisingly robust considering the watery appearance and to a lesser degree, mouthfeel. Well balanced with plenty of sweetness as one would expect for the style but with a nice light touch of hops. Minute carbonation plays with the tongue. Flavors of cocoa, caramel, and leafy hops are all light and nice. Very drinkable. I am really impressed with this beer, mostly because of the low expectations I had for it, but impressed none-the-less.","DaPeculierDane","Beers"
4.27,27.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A clear, very deep brown mahogany body is capped by a creamy head of off-white foam. The head dissipates shortly, but that seems to be fairly common for the style. Lacing is limited to spots and splashes left here and there. The nose is clean and expresses darkly caramelish malt with just a hint of hoppiness in the background. In the mouth it's medium bodied and somewhat creamy with a fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation. The flavor is straightforward, darkly caramelish and lightly toasty malt with a thread of leafy hops and the suggestion of alcohol, although it never really shows itself. Very nicely done! Full-flavored and perfectly balanced. Perhaps the best bock I've ever had at a brewpub!","NeroFiddled","0"
3.45,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall: Enjoyable, just a little below the IPA in the overall marking stakes but a good effort that I had little trouble with.
