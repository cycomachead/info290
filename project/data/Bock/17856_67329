3.53,9,3.75,3.75,3.5,3,3.5,"I went with a heavy hand on my pour and although it was not really my intent, I got a pseudo-cascade all the same. Settling, I was left with a massive there-plus fingers of dense, creamy, tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep-amber, bordering on copper (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich and malty, kind of caramel, very sweet. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the taste was very much like liquid caramel! Wow. I usually disdain sweet beers, but such the style for this beer, plus it was not cloying. That is to say, there was the inherent sweetness, but it did not linger, like a more syrupy beer might. Instead, the finish evinced an alcohol heat which rendered it semi-dry as a whole. Not bad, and at the price point, worth at least a try.","woodychandler","Beers"

2,-38.3,3,3,1.25,3,1.5,"Baby Got Bock is a real nice name. The label is creative and inviting. It looks okay and there was nothing on the nose to indicate the assault I was about to be the subject of. I took a sip, and said, not bad.... woah, what the heck was that. I winced with a strong, strange, tart sour flavor. Surely I had been mistaken. So I took another half-ounce swallow. I was not mistaken, my throat muscles tensed up, I crinkled my nose and my head shook. I promptly took the ale glass to the powder room sink and poured it down without reservations. In conclusion, this offering from Horny Goat satisfies just as well as the others I have sampled. Sorry to say, as I really dislike being negative. But truthfulness reigns.","Sipchue","Nov 18, 2013"

3.35,3.4,4,4,3,3.5,3,"Clear, darker-gold colored brew. Fair amount of rising carb bubbles, small but durable white head. Scent is mainly sweet lagered malts, just a hint of hops. Taste is alright, I'm getting some green-bottle notes from it however. Focus is on the malt, some grass, a touch of bitter hops. Pretty soft mouth, medium to full. Overall not bad, but whether its intentional or not, the green-bottle taste (and its not sold in a green bottle, but you know what im talking about) takes it down a notch.","Tballz420","0"
