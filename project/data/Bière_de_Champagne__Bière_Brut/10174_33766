2.99,-12.3,4,2.5,3,3.5,3,"D - Could use more spritz and dryness for the style, but good if you take it as a malt liquor. Still, it's overpriced at $11.99 relative to some superior offerings that are available for a tenth of the price.","MasterSki","Nov 10, 2012"
3.15,-7.6,3,3,3.5,2.5,3,"O: Very strange example of the style as there is so little carbonation (which is not what I have observed with others in the style or would have expected). Not super easy to drink due the sweetness - definitely not sessionable for me. Alcohol is pretty well hidden.","dbrauneis","Jun 11, 2012"
3.27,-4.1,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,"O: This is a very unusual bière de champagne that doesn’t seem to be very carbonated. It’s not that difficult to drink because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste.","metter98","Jun 09, 2012"

2.28,-33.1,3,2.5,2,3,2,"Well. This is a singularly underwhelming beer. The bottle says brewed in Belgium v. the Polish version listed here. Poured with an ok white head and a bit of lace. Straw yellow color. With the full head picked up a pleasant fleeting aroma. Gone now; friends didn't pick it up. Flavor is basically sweet. And that's it. Body and carbonation is ok. Finsih is uh, yeah. Forgettable beer.","drpimento","Sep 30, 2009"
3.05,-10.6,3,3,3,3.5,3,"The bottle I purchased listed Palm Breweries in Steenhuffel, Belgium as the brewer and not Cobra. There is the sweet lager yeast aroma of bread and typical european maltiness. The color is pale golden. The mouthfeel has more body than I expected for a lager and is about medium in feel. The taste is of malt and carbonation, you can see the bubbles in the glass like champagne. The finsh is a little syrupy and you can feel the carbonation as the beer goes down. It does do a great job of hiding the 8% abv.","strengthdoc","Jun 25, 2009"
3.58,5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Courtesy of njdhopgrower and edbeer. 750ml bottle served in a champagne flute. Poured a hazy, golden yellow with a one inch bright white head that quickly recedes - no lacing on this one. Nose was grassy, lemony and a little biscuity at the finish - very mild and muted. Taste was very light fruit, some yeast, candi sugar and cereal grains revealed towards the back. Mouthfeeel was light-bodied with champagne-like effervescence; a little prickly - finishes dry and clean. Interesting brew - well-hidden abv. I enjoyed the opportunity to try this one, but not a go to beer. A great alternative to champagne however.","Jwale73","May 31, 2009"
2.88,-15.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Hazed gold, initial burst of foam in the soap suds sense. The flaccid, weak head sticks around for a few minutes, then disappears. Sweet grains and corn in the nose. More of the same in the flavor. Dusty bubblegum and pilsner malt, with a prickly dose of sugar. Moderate to excessive C02. Fizzy lager to the Nth degree, with a strong hit of old pear fruit roll-up. Basically a bottom-barrel Duvel knockoff with an antacid in the mix...this is weak sauce.","emerge077","Apr 12, 2009"
3.4,-0.3,4,4,3,4,3,"Well it's definitely a drinkable beer but I wonder if it's worth all the methode champagnoise effort. If this were just any belgian pils or belgian golden, not bad. But for all the hoopla, it disappoints. JMO.","czechsaaz","Feb 03, 2009"

3.13,-8.2,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"What this beer lacks in complexities and all-around unique ﬂavor, it makes up for with originality, though that originality might be more in the marketing and packaging than the actual beer. KP being brewed at the same brewery as Rodenbach does not change the fact that this beer tastes like a malt liquor. Sure, a little bit more reﬁned and clean, but packaging alone won't put more glam into a beer. Here's a little for our homies [pours some on the rug]. How about a barrel-aged Champagne Lager without the corn and rice? Now that would have been interesting, if not glamorous. We'll give 'em a ""+" for creativity.","BeerAdvocate","Jul 23, 2008"

2.16,-36.7,3,2,2,3,2,"This ""double fermented lager"" obviously has nothing Belgian going on...at all. It's definately no Biere de Champagne, but even as a strong lager of sorts, there isn't much to like. Cheap beer dressed up as fancy beer. I'm glad we only got the small bottle at a discounted price. The mere fact that it's really called ""King Cobra"" frightens me a little bit.","wedge","Jun 03, 2008"
3.53,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability was good, but the alcohol had a solvent feel in my belly, coupled with excessive carbonation, keeping me in check. But it was fairly light and airy, and went down very easily. However, the fact that it's so cheap is surely a plus, a sorostitute special for sure...the fact that I'm many years removed from college and happily married means I really have no reason to ever buy this again! Still, it would easily impress your average hipster that sticks to macro lagers. Do yourself a favor though and serve like you would any other BSPA, too cold and it looses flavor and is mainly fusels and sugar. My scores were all based on the cellar temp serving. In spite of the lower price, I dock them points for the BS marketing...a sugary BSPA in my book. FWIW, this bottle really went to my head more then it should have for an 8% 750ml...good or bad, I'll leave that to the reader to decide!","ccrida","Apr 18, 2008"
3.89,14.1,3,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Filed under Biere de Champagne, but the bottle constantly states thats its a champagne lager, lager. After tasting this beer, my mind is not really describing this beer in any Biere Brut sense. The beer looks like a medium bright sunshine. Clear with only one coulumn of bubbles rising to a headless top. The aroma is a sweet grass with a light spice note. The palate is a little thick with pilsner like malt. When you add that dash of yeast sediment, the fruity charateristics of malt is better defined. Notesof brown sugar and lemon jump out at the finish of the yeasty part of the beer. Very easy to drink for such a high strength abv. Rereshing even for 8%.","scruffwhor","Apr 15, 2008"

3.25,-4.7,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Found at PDQ Market in Rockland, this or some beer from India. Pours a green/yellow highly fuzzy appearence. Smells sharply like cheap champagne. Taste, well the same, a bit tolerable and drinkable, but doesn't really hint much of beer at all. Very highly carbonated mouthfeel. Overall, an intersting style and maybe there are saome better examples, but this is not one of them. I'll stick to the usual suspects.","Manosbeeroffate","Jan 30, 2008"
3.1,-9.1,3,3,3,4,3,"Like many other recent reviewers, I got a super great deal of $3 a bottle on this from Green's in Atlanta so decided to give it a try. I've already had Deus, so this wasn't my first foray into the style. While this beer had some of the champagne characteristics of the style, the overwhelming impression is of an Euro lager- albeit a much more sparkly one. Poured a bit darker than others of the style, more medium gold than champagne color. Good head, constant stream of bubbles. In fact the head was a little too good- I'd prefer it to fade a bit more but have the streaming bubbles keep up. Smellis mostly tangy lager yeast and prickly carbonation. Maybe a touch of apple as well. Taste is similar- lots of lager yeast and then medium bitterness and slight bit of apples, also a bit watery. Mouthfeel is spot on, maybe a bit heavier and not quite as ethereal as some others, but good. If you haven't tried the style and want to see what its all about, save your money for the Deus or the Malhuer Brut. If those bottle prices are too daunting and you find yourself in Atlanta, have the Deus by the glass at the Brick Store instead. This isn't even close.","Georgiabeer","Dec 31, 2007"
3.76,10.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"My first foray into this style of beer with me being partial to the hop it wasnt a style I had to have but its nice to try something new.Poured into a pilsner a light to medium lemon yellow with a large blooming white head alot of tiny bubbles quite spritzey looking and quite nice to look at.Lighter aromas very pilsner-like with notes of iron honey malt and a hint of grass.At first the mouthfeel is a little sharp maybe from the carbonation but it does smooth out and with the alcohol being so well hidden it glides down.Flavors border on pale bock and pilsner its quite sweet like a pale bock up front with big honey and carmael tones finishing a little drier and lemony.Not bad and honestly outside of a bit of a swwet sting you would never know it was 8.3% alc. it goes down easily Iam gonna try some ""higher end"" beers of this style to see how good this can really be,this one wasnt to bad.","oberon","Dec 27, 2007"
3.58,5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D - nice; I'm a hophead, but this is enjoyable and my gf likes it. Got the bottle for $3, so I'm not complaining. Bought a second one as well, so I'll definitely be having another. For $3 this is an excellent buy!","ruckzuck","Dec 08, 2007"
3.97,16.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer was available at an incredibly low overstock price of $3 a 750 ml. bottle at Green's, so I could not resist. Poured into a Champagne flute, the beer looked a bit darker gold than the real thing, and the carbonation was far less forceful. There wasn't much of a head to speak of. The aroma was sweet and yeasty with a little black pepper and anise thrown in for good measure. The taste was sweet and tart. There wasn't much bitterness, but the palette was quite dry after each sip. Not packed with flavor, but definitely resembled Champagne quite a bit in taste. The mouthfeel was medium full and aided by a carbon dioxide tingle. Not a bad beer at all as it serves its intended purpose as an aperitif quite well. The whole experience was made even more pleasurable as I consider the hefty discount I received.","rajendra82","Dec 01, 2007"

4.01,17.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"An interesting ale and decidedly on the light end of the Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut classification. To me this is much closer to an Imperial Lager or even the milder lighter flavored bock beers. One thing is for sure this is an easy to drink beer and a bit deceiving in its strength. This would be an excellent beer to use at a wedding as a Champagne substitute that a Budweiser lover could comprehend.","Zorro","Aug 21, 2007"
3.37,-1.2,2.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Fizzes out of bottle, pours a five+ finger white head that vanishes quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Crystal clear light amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grassy nose. Flavor is sweetish, earthy and grass, drying finish. Higher ABV is hidden. Champagne lager is misleading - not fizzy and not like a lager. Pricey at $6.99 for a 375ml corked bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME.","jdhilt","Aug 20, 2007"
3.68,7.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,5,"Corked and caged 750mL bottle. Poured into a Franziskaner hefeweiss glass at approximately 61F. This poured a crystal clear golden straw colour like a pilsner with an enormous white head that faded away in about 2 minutes. Smell was a cross between something like Beck's and a Riesling. I don't really like the smell of beer like Beck's and so forth, but I really didn't know what to expect and I have never had another Bière de Champagne with which to compare this one. Taste was very mildly sweet up front with some definite white wine qualities, but turns pleasantly (lightly) bitter toward the finish. Mouthfeel was very smooth and nearly bereft of any CO2 ""sting"". Also, as mentioned in other reviews, this drinks way below the 8,0%abv displayed on the label. You could get in trouble with this quickly if you aren't careful! Not my favourite beer or beer style, but certainly interesting and I am very glad I tried it.","SilentSabre","Jul 15, 2007"
3.89,14.1,4.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Tastes like a smooth pilsner. Light on the malt, clean, refreshing and very easy to drink. Not as ""tingly"" as expected, not as carbonated either. Still, there is a slight Rielsing hint to this one. A good beer. I had a 750ml bottle, but have seen them in splits. The latter is probably more appropriate serving.","Mebuzzard","Jul 05, 2007"
3.67,7.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Rather enjoyable as a champagne alternative, and while not as flavorful as DeuS or Malheur this doesn't impact your wallet to the same extent.","cbl2","May 31, 2007"
3.1,-9.1,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a light golden straw color, no noticeable aroma beyond faint grains. Flavor is crisp and clean with a little corn sweetness, finishes dry. Not much body or carbonation. Wow. Get a load of this one. Not sure how they legally got away with ""Champagne Lager"" on the bottle without France stepping in. Aside from bottle-conditioned carbonation, and the light, sharp flavor, this beer has nothing to do with Champagne - was it bottled in Champagne? Was it aged in pupitres there? Were the bottles riddled and had they undergone degorgement? Was the beer a blend of thirty to sixty different beers of varying ages and vintages? No, no, no, no, and no. The bottle itself describes how they went to great lengths to make the beer as smooth and inoffensive as possible, then tries to overplay its hand by saying how distinctive it is. And after all the English all over the bottle did you catch the ingredients listed in German? what's up with that? Sorry, I can read a little German, and I caught the corn and rice in there. I'm sure Coors could send some beer over to Rodenbach for double fermenting and a corked Champagne bottle with similar results. In my area the bottle retails for $11.99. That hurts. Hmm, a 750 ml of Westmalle Tripel is setting right next to it on the shelf for the same price! What to choose...?","dedrinker","Apr 13, 2007"
