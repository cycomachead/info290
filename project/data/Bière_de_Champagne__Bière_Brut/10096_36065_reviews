"Pours a murky orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is malt, caramel, toffee, and yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and yeast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"Classy beer, reminded me of Belgian strong ales. I would have liked less sweet (I also found DeuS overly sweet as it warmed up). Sincerely, it is not much behind DeuS, and luckily (or evolution) this one was even more rounded up. Nevertheless, this is not my preferred style, I couldn’t help to compared them to apple ciders, which I am not fond of (and sometimes I liked to be polemic). But this is perfect for desserts (a bit expensive for this reason in my opinion, unless you dig sugar highs). Suggestion, drink it close to expiration date, it worked well for me."

"Only my second Biere de Champange, but this is by far the better of the two."
"O: Great drinkability. One of the best Brazilian beers I've ever had"

"This bottle did not pop. Temperature just below room temperature. Lager yeast, a hoppy lager with significant yeast. Big lace on yellow head. Carbonation right there.Bit of an acidic finish. Interesting but unexceptional.Courtesy of Ralph who shared."
"D: A miss for me but I need to explore this style more. The fruity esters and the smokiness were interesting but totally off style. I enjoyed the beer but I am glad we split the bottle. A good beer for sure but for the price...."
"M/D: This beer was very similar to a champagne, but there was a lot going on. Tons of carbonation, this beer changed a lot through the drink. One of the more interesting beers I have had in a long time."
"Overall, could be worse, but was pretty off. Watch out for this one."
"D-a little rough on the palate with the huge carbonation and extremely grainy feel. the flavors are interesting, not bad but they don't seem to mesh that well together."
"Unique, complex. Sweet and dry. Fruity and spicy. Notes of honey and smokey peat. Peaty, earthiness is slightly reminiscent of mushrooms (in a good way, if you can say that for a premium beer!). Warming alcohol. Sparkly, bubbly carbonation."
"I finally decided to crack this baby in rememberance of a good mate,it pours a nice deep orange,amber hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves a creamy two finger head with average lacing here and there,the aroma is definately a cross of champagne and beer with some sweet malty undertones and to be honest i like this aroma its definately a first for me,it has a nice weighty mouthfeel compared to the usual light mouthfeel of a fine champagne and this really keeps me interested as obviously a nice champagne would not have a full mouthfeel so i really feel the beer takes over in this brew and it is a sensational blend of sweet and bitter and i could drink it all night if it wasnt so expensive,if you see this brew and have never tried it you should definately give it a go cheers."
"This beer pours into a wine glass with a dark amber color and a very white, very fast head. This beer is highly carbonated and the cork blew off like a champagne bottle, hard and all the way across the room. The smell is similar to wine but not too overpoweringly sour. The taste is dry and fairly easy to drink. Obviously with the high carbonation, the beer sort of bubbles across the tongue, then finishes with an easy and sweet aftertaste. Somewhat similar in flavor to a lambic but without the extreme sour aspect that many have. Absolutely a different beer and one worth trying but not sure that I would be getting this one on a regular basis as it's more like champagne then beer and runs about $25 a bottle. Check it out if you get a chance."
"(*Note: The processes of remuage and dégorgement are suppose to remove yeast from the bottle so it is more likely that what I'm observing are actually coagulated proteins.)"
"This is a rare style, I believe there are only three of these around the world that are available. I found this to be quite a treat and would heartily recommend you try it, or one of the other champagne style beers, just for the experience. I see this as going over very well in mixed company, either before or after dinner, and quite a conversation piece. After all, what is life all about?"
"Edit... Holy crap... 11.5%... I would certainly not pegged it that high."
"This beer poured a clear, light amber-golden color with slightly off-white foam that persisted a while but settled and coated the glass as the beer was consumed. The smell was lightly sweet with a touch of grain and corn and a hint of alcohol. The taste was sweet and malty with some alcohol. There were flavors of grain and a hint of corn (DMS?), and very mild hops in the finish. The mouthfeel was crisp and airy with medium-light body and strong carbonation. Overall lightly sweet. This was OK but not exciting, though it did grown on me after a little while."
"Cork date on this one is 2006. Tried to fly out of the bottle after I popped the cork (as gently as I could), and poured a clear amber with a 1/2"" head of streaming bubbles. Very much like a hearty champagne in appearance. The aroma is very clean, almost like a lager, with a touch of caramel, some oak, apples, and raw sugar. Flavors are more aggressive, heavy carbonation up front, with candied pears, honey, some alcohol presence, and a light, pleasant tartness, with a dry finish. Profile is similar to a beefier version of Duvel, and either would make a fine substitute for a young champagne."
"D - intruiging, best split with friends"
"Lovely pop when I launched the cork off of my balcony. A slow, yet consant plume of foam slowly makes its way out of the bottle after the corked i popped. After about five minutes, the foam backs off. The pour into our champagne glasses showcases the brisk white head that almost overflows the glass. Greeted with an almost a peachy amber with highlights of gold and straw mingling with the beautiful bubbling. The aroma has a soft pilsner like quality. With much more attenton focused on very light fruits, and just a balancing note of hops. The first sip blesses the palate with dry, malty fruits, a little yeast, some honey, and herbal grassy hops finish the ansemble. The palate has a great carbonation that develops all the flavors of this beer nicley. But a lasting snd bitter aftertaste makes the palat of this beer a little less than what it could of been. Great sipping beer."
"We'll be having more of this through the years to remind us of this day, and I won't be disappointed when we do... but I wish this had some more characteristics of a brut champagne... more dryness and a lighter body, specifically."
"As other reviewers have noted, Lust isn't a bad beer, but it doesn't justify the $25 price tag, either. Your call."
"Drinkability - this would be proper to have at any elegant celebration, a cool entry for a beer tasting. Don't know how it would age, the abv would certainly preserve it a while. I'd love to have this again and will keep an eye out for it."
"Drinkability- I actually had to ramp this one up. Alcohol is not warming and quickly calls for more without causing too much intoxication. This is one special beer right here."
"Pours a clear amber with a lot of little floaties moving around in there. Big head falls fast...just as champagne would. Nose is kind of sappy hop like. Flavor is tart and tangy. Seems a bit rough on the edge. Minor yeast tone. Strong sugar tone, but not in a way that I feel like it blends at all. It seems to stick out like a sore thumb. The carbonation at first seemed so biting that it was almost enough for me to just quit drinking the whole thing. It calms down a good bit, but then the liquid feels a bit too syrupy. Overall this is a so-so brew. In comparison to the two others of the style I have had before, Deus still reigns supreme. This doesn't really come close at all and takes it's place next to Krait. A waste of money (and way too much of it, IMO). Try the Deus instead."
"As the beer warms up from its initial 50°F (10°C) it picks up some subtle touches of woodiness or even plasticized (though not in a bad way) leather character in the finish. The malt character picks up a bit and the sweetness gets a bit more tempered as the beer warms too. A lot of this tempering manifests itself in the form of a salty, peat-like smokiness that is just barely perceptible at times, but definitely present (though I am not implying that any peat malt was used, though you never know). This could definitely be a bit drier and a bit spicier / funky; this would evoke the champagne-like character quite a bit more. Still it is quite tasty and certainly a beer worth trying. While this does have a touch of warming alcohol character, it manages to hide the 11.5% alcohol quite well. This is definitely best enjoyed on the warmer side of things, the suggested serving temperatures would definitely have ruined this beer for me. In the end this is quite enjoyable, but it really could be so much more complex and interesting."
"Drinkability: not a easy-to-drink beer, with it's 11,5% ABV, maybe one bottle (750ml) it's ok. But sure I'll drink another, some day."
"I really don't know how to describe this. It was certainly good, and I would definitely drink it again, but I am at a real loss to compare to anything in that its truly a unique entity. I do feel confident that if you enjoy Asti Spumante you would definitely like this for the sweetness. I can honestly say the best Biere de Champagne I've ever tasted! If you like a dry, sweet beer with a nice kick of carbonation (or have a significant other that does not like beer), or simply enjoy a change of scenery and like trying new beer styles check this out."
