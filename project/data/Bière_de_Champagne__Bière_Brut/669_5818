In brief, today we both received our first residency interview invitations at the same place, thus allowing us to stay together throughout the remainder of our training.  Highly exciting stuff.  The most surprising thing about this beer was its feel.  It is shockingly heavy on the feel, but gives you a wonderful drying cleanliness before each sip is gone.  As far as the taste goes, for something labeled “Brut”, the driest possible form of champagne, this is a brightly and cloyingly sweet drink.  The residual sugars are high, along with that big booziness, suggesting a big, big grain bill during the brewing process.  For this first foray into the style we are pleased, but not wooed.  This was a nice introduction, but I believe we would prefer something a bit tamer, dryer, and more refined stylistically.","TheBrewo","Sep 30, 2014"

Aroma is spicy yeast malt and a hint of skunk hop. It is a green bottle and I kept it out of the light so maybe it got a little light struck at the store. Flavor is like aroma minus the skunk and much sweeter. In fact the sweetness dominates. Body is decent and good carbonation. Finish is a little more bittersweet than sweet.

Lots of lacing and retention in the foam, with large beads leaving my glass almost looking like a bubble bath with hills of foam and clusters of bubbles strewn across the side of the glass. The aroma has spicy esters that mingle with alcohol causing a bit of tingle in the nose. A bit vinous ala champagne plus maybe clove and apple skins. The flavor at first has pears or cider, fruity yet tart, big spicy yeast notes and alcohol on the midpalate then a very dry and bready finish. The Belgian yeast lends most of the flavor to this beer, so tart and spicy fruits are the name of the game. Body is moderate with lots of creamy carbonation, the bubbles bleed out fairly quickly, I like it better as the bubbles calm down, though it seems to almost go flat. This is fairly tasty once my palate acclimatizes to the tart yeast character and I can appreciate the spice and fruit subtleties.","vacax","Apr 11, 2010"

They treated the presentation with the same care as that of a fine wine so I was a little less put off than my original concern of the high price tag. Poured into snifters in small amounts the beer was a turbulent dark brown with a white fine head that left some good lacing as we enjoyed. The aroma of this was so complex that it seemed to change as the beer went down. Started with dark fruit of raisins and prunes and ended with a long malt flavor that had a great full mouthfeel. The natural carbonation was light and complimented the style well. I will look around for more Malheur beers for sure but certainly to enjoy at home considering the price.

3,-25.9,3,3,3,3,3,"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep golden ale with a small bubbly head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of light sweet malt notes with some weird ester or maybe it's the yeast but something is surely different. Taste is sweeter and lighter then expected with some sweet malt and light yeasty bready finish. Body was full with some low filtration and some great carbonation. Alcohol is not apparent which is quite surprising considering the 11% contained in this beer. I am glad I tried this but considering the price tag it is unlikely I will try this again.","Phyl21ca","Feb 21, 2008"
4.28,5.7,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall, a very nice beer. Good for "special" occasions. Champagne-like. Very drinkable and has an undetectable abv [which is dangerous]. Very versatile with food. Highly recommend this one.","atigerlife","Jan 21, 2008"
4.48,10.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"I could drink this all night long if it was $5 a bottle, but it is not. Didn't really notice the alcohol at all in this one. The price puts it out of the range of a beer that i would have the pleasure of drinking regularly, but it was very nice to try it. Get a bottle and celebrate with some friends.","wheelinshirt","Jan 01, 2008"
4.73,16.8,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Pours a clouded straw with a big white head. Lots of lacing on the way down. Flavor is very champagne like and smooth. But there is also that level of Belgian ale that is oh-so-obvious. Lots of sugar. Good bit of what seems like hops. Feel has a lot of carbonation to it and it feels pretty soft on the mouth. Definitely drinkable, but more so a sipper. I have been keen on finding another good biere de champagne after trying Deus, and this is the first one that has made it worth the money. I kind of feel like this is Duvel on speed. That consistent and steady ride that doesn't really take you anywhere mind blowing, but it's still pretty damn good.","RblWthACoz","Dec 31, 2007"
4.03,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: A refined, elegant drink not sullied one single bit by the fact that is was served alongside pork rinds.","ChainGangGuy","Nov 25, 2007"
4.6,13.6,5,5,4.5,5,4,"Truly a beer that needs to be drunk in quantity to really enjoy; I would have written this off as a really good beer, but not great, if I had not had multiple glasses of this brew. I really can't ask any more of either the appearance (especially if I had poured it out all at once) or the palate of this beer; it really is just spot on for this brew.","Gueuzedude","Oct 19, 2007"
4.06,0.2,3.5,5,4,3.5,3.5,"Awesome champagne-like mouthfeel with sweet and slightly bitter finish. This is good stuff, great aroma, but definately a special occasion bottle- mostly due to the extreme price.","BeerZack","Jul 30, 2007"
3.58,-11.6,3,2.5,4,4,4,"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Pizza Port Belgian Beer Fest. Pour from a 750mL.Aroma finds itself as touching in slightly sickly malt and coarse cigarette ash. Cloudy deep yellow pour, with white rim. Flavor a rich, tawny creamed malt carrying the nicely belgian yeast notes, with high rich phenols but none of the harshness of chemical notes. Gently percolating in attenuated beauty. Aroma suffers but flavor and body are crisply done.","CharlesDarwin","Jul 21, 2007"
3.17,-21.7,2.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Pale straw color with a thin head. Sweet maly aroma that was oddly close to a macro lager smell. Light, sweet, sugary malt flavor not unlike plain sugar cookies. Very fine, sharp carbonation. Medium/light body with a sweet, almost adjunct like finish. Cost me $45 for a 750ml at a bar. I was in a good mood - just got a raise at work, otherwise this is totally not worth it.","dedrinker","Apr 30, 2007"
3.79,-6.4,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Notes: Pretty good. I will have to venture into this style now that this has opened my mind. My biggest turn off was the grainy, wheat frontside. Biggest upside was its amazing depth and out of the box type brewing.","DogFood11","Feb 02, 2007"
3.65,-9.9,4,4,3.5,4.5,3,"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Much like a fine champagne, the crisp mouthfeel becomes more gentle after the initial swell. All of the flavors distribute nicely to various parts of the tongue, presenting a balanced show of hops, spice, and gigantic malty sugars. Again, my only real problem with this beer is the strength... as an aperitif, it wore me out a bit early this evening.","yelterdow","Dec 25, 2006"
4.53,11.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"BB 15-04-06. Perfect presentation with a good and lasting head, clear pale golden beer and bubbles that just keep on pearling up. Very good nose also giving lots of hops and malts and overal very enjoyable. As is taste being dry and bitter with slight maltnote. Yes this is a wonderfull brew to celebrate a good occasion with. Lovely beer that has unbelievable amount of CO2 and makes mouthfeel as a real champagne. Easy drinkable and highly enjoyable.","paterlodie","Aug 27, 2005"

4.31,6.4,5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Golden body with a huge spectacular carbonation level. Enormous white head keeps climbing the glass sides instead of going down and this lasts for a good 2 minutes. Aroma is desert-dry, very floral and yeasty. It does smell spritzy. Wild fruitiness (apples, pears, orange, apricot). Superb soft mouthfeel, bubbly, smooth with every bubble tickling the tongue. As soon as it enters the mouth, the barnyardy and hay compenents get transported everywhere in the mouth. The dry bitterness hits immediatly and develops in a complex manner during the long finish. It didnt seem all that complex in mouth though. No alcohol gets felt ever, but this is warming all the way through. A masterpiece of the brewing art. Cheers Martin.","Rastacouere","Jul 10, 2004"
4.5,11.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I was most fortunate to purchase a few bottles of this while in Brussels for about 10 Euros, and I think that is a steal after trying my first. It is a hazy golden color and a big fluffy, white head. The aroma is part fruity and part delicate, earthy hops. I think it is very complex. Some of the tastes I noticed were peach, apricot and vanilla. It finishes with a spicy hop finish. The beer is light and refreshing despite a hefty ABV. I had no trouble finishing the whole 750 mL bottle in by myself as I did not want to share my new found treasure.","ark57","Mar 11, 2004"

4.5,11.1,5,5,4.5,4,4,"Head very creamy and compact, cream, milk, strawberry in the flavour, even citrus fruits (lime, orange, bergamotto?). Peach. The colour is orange, full and intense. Taste: licorice, wood (tobacco?), pepper (more than in the smell). The bitter is strong in the aftertaste, very persistent. After 10-15 minutes in the smell appears hints of sour black cherry and strawberry, and pepper, more strong. This beer is very complex, but it is very well balanced, even with the alcool, not very low. Aftertaste bitter of hop, very pleasant. The taste, and mostly the flavour changes a lot at the rise of the temperature, growing again the complexity of this very interesting beer. Then rise again spices... A beer absolutely to taste! (even if it is a little expensive... how you can do if the drinkability is high?)","stcules","May 28, 2003"
3.5,-13.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nothing really champagne like at all as others suggest. Still very big and powerful. Heavy mouthfeel, with some detergent flavour with some peppery alcohol, like many tripels. In fact this reminded me of a blend between Westmalle Tripel, Chimay White and Orval. Complex and rich, yet i don't really think they pulled this one off as well as they could have, still a nice one though.","rastaman","Jan 06, 2003"

4.28,5.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a golden orange with a thick amount of bubbly, champagne-like head. Tart, fruit aromas are most dominate with a hint of sweetness. A very nice belgian brew with some candi sugar like sweetness, citrusy tanginess and a good mouth filling sweetness. Was expecting less than I got and was pleasantly surprised. A very intriguiging beer that is worth checking out at least once. Not something to make a session beer out of.","jreitman","Nov 30, 2002"
4.22,4.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The beer pours a slightly foggy orange color, the head is mountainous, frothy, long lasting and fine sheets of lace cover the glass. Nose malt, fruit sweet, to me the aroma of over ripe plums, tart, not bad mind you, just something unexpected. Front is malt sweet, the top is middling, and the finish is potently acidic, beneficently hopped, with a Sweet and Sour long lasting aftertaste, quite complex. Also the large ABV, gives a nice "tummy" warming feeling, a very interesting beer. Normally something that I don't think would be high on my list, but I do have a few bottles aging away, so let's see what I think next year and the year after.","Gusler","Nov 13, 2002"
