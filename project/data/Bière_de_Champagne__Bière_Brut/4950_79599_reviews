"Large format bottle decanted into a flute over the course of several pourings. This effervescent sparkly brew is a light lemon yellow color with a frothy persistent white head. Aroma prominently features doughy pilsener or pale malt, apple and pear-like esters along with a little Belgian yeasty funk, hard fruit candy, and faintly fragrant and earthy hay-like hops. Smells like a hybrid continental lager/Belgian or French ale, quite unique, although the aroma was subdued overall. Palate was also quite distinctive and surprising, a solid backbone of doughy sweet malts propping up a strong gooseberry hop flavor that gathered steam over the course of the session and some mellow yeast-derived phenols. There is quite a pronounced residual sweetness that almost veers into cidery territory, the carbonation is much lower than expected (or than the appearance suggests!), and the mouthfeel is almost chalky and thicker than expected. Finishes rather hoppy, more gooseberry jam and candied lemon. This beer does not jive particularly well with written descriptions of the style (e.g., Larson's ""Beer Select-o-pedia", 2014) although it does convey some Belgian character and is interesting on the basis of its own merits. I probably wouldn't move mountains to obtain another bomber."

"O: Pretty good, though I feel like the style is more apt for a hoppier, more orange, tropical fruit-forward taste."
"Has too much sweetness for a Brut. Pale malt sweetness with light strawberry. Gooseberry and faint banana. Finishes a little drier with leftover carbonation. Body is wet, but boring. Does not exude crispness or real drinkability."

"Pours a lightly hazy pale yellow with a small white head. In the aroma, a dry fruitiness and somewhat champagne like. In the taste, sweet to dry pears and a mellow yeasty presence. A small bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with dry pear skins and fruitiness in the aftertaste. Quite nice, fruity and dry."
"As a Belgian beer, this is somewhat okay. As a biere de champagne, it's so-so. Has a consistent sweet tone. Seems a bit too thick for the style and a bit too bready. It's okay, but it doesn't really do much for me. A good attempt at a style rarely done."

"Perhaps I've just been very lucky or even spoiled with some beautiful examples of the style in the past, this is a decent brew and perhaps I shouldn't make comparisons to classics that cost twice as much"
"Whew - this sure started off as one hell of a surprise - could an apparently crafted Biere Brut actually be anything like the bottom shelf stars of your local booze-mart? Thankfully, that initial unpleasantness burns off soon enough, leaving something drinkable enough, but with few characteristics to recommended it as a Champagne analogue - biscuity grain, and swirling tiny bubbles, to name a few. Not at all in the same league as Charlevoix's Brut or the venerable Malheur or Deus."
"O: Rather disappointing, honestly. A pretty good beer, but a far cry from DeuS or Malheur Brut. Tentatively recommended."
"D - Very drinkable. Smooth and well balanced. Very drinkable, but a touch empty."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruit, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is pretty tasty but fairly basic."

"Another interesting one from Devil's Canyon, it's cool to see that they're branching out from their regular lineup. More like a kolsch with a champagne yeast finish than a dry traditional brut, but the malt and slight citrus adds some character. Very drinkable but 1 is enough for me."
