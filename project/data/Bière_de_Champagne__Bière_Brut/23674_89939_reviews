"Overall this comes off more like large fermented cider, or cheap bubbly, than a classic brut bier."

"listed as a biere brut, i don't quite get that here, not as dry and clean as it should be to meet that style guideline, but it is plenty well carbonated. my problem here is that the green bottle has allowed this to get skunk on the nose. i only loosely get the belgian yeast through the stench, not nice. in taste i get a little better vibe, but its gone off. not sure how long these bottles have been sitting, but for 18 bucks a pop, buyer beware that unless this has been kept dark, its likely skunked as well. i can see the potential of the fresh beer though, and respect what it might have been. light white wheat malt, dry belgian yeast and effervescent bubbles. a refreshing summertime toaster, worthy of celebrations. in its current form its ruined. hard to get a fair take on this with my specimen. will revisit at some point."

"O: This beer has very good drinkability because it hides its alcohol very well. I liked how it exhibited both fruity and dry flavors."

"O: I don't know about this one. It's ok, seems different than any other beer I've had. And in some respects, doesn't seem much like beer. Not bad though."
