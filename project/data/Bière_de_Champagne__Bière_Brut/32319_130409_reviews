"Overall - Finally, a pleasant sour from Side Project.  Lots of grape, but not that intense on the sour."

"Serving type: bottle."
"Very acetic- almost impossible to swallow."
"Pours a rich golden color with a bright effervescent head that recedes quickly.  Smell is lemon, citrus, stone fruit, funk, yogurt.  Taste is essentially like a light white sparkling wine with tart yogurt intermixed.  Lots of white grape, peach, apple, pear with a creamy yogurty sourness.  Really tastes like a fruit on the bottom yogurt cup.  The mouthful is rich and creamy while the carbonation keeps it light.  Outstanding beer.  My biggest issue with Fuzzy is that the subtle sweetness of the white peaches were drowned out by the intense yogurty sourness.  Blueberry Flanders had a nice balanced refreshing tartness but the blueberry flavor was a bit disappointing.  This is a much better balance for my taste than both, a best of both worlds.  Probably my favorite SP so far.  Get it today!"

"The most underrated of the SP brews. Big white grape flavor, and the white wine barrel flavor on the end is exquisite. A joy to drink."

"Very surprised that the ABV is so darn high for what it drinks like. However, generally covered by too much tart qualities and I much preferred JK's Blanc du Bois in a side by side."
"Better than Fuzzy and much better than Fencerow in my opinion."

"Overall, this was way different than I expected. I was expecting more of a wine-like drinking experience given the name, ingredients, and style. With that being said, this is still a tremendous beer. If you are a sour fan, this offers a great, juicy sourness in addition to some great complexity from the yeast and barrel aging."

"The beer pours a dull sunset like golden yellow with no head, visible carbonation, and (with some careful pouring) no sediment. The nose has a slightly floral/vanilla grain & barrel sweetness, surprisingly limited tartness, underlying grape notes, and minimal funk/acetone. It has a mild, champagne-like grape taste upfront with grain rounding out profile and lingering alcohol and oak. The beer has a light-medium body, but is not as crushable as expected (mainly due to the alcohol content) and a slightly chewy sweetness. Carbonation is relatively low and acidity is lower than expected - the beer still finishes with that punishing dry oak slap in the palate. The beer's so limited and expensive that I'd probably avoid purchasing it again in the future (or at least my full allotment), but it's undeniably delicious."

"Verdict: A very interesting beer from Side Project. Much like Fuzzy, the nose was immaculate, capturing the perfect essence of chardonnay grapes and white wine, but the flavors are crippled by how sour the beer is and while enjoyable, difficult to handle more than a few ounces. The ABV was expertly hidden, which was a nice touch, but still, the overwhelming acidic sourness is hard to get past."
