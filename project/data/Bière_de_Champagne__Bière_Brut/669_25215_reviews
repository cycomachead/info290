"O: The beer is quite easy to drink for the style because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."

"Great aperitif."
"My wife picked this beer up for me from the local beer store. Poured from a 750 ml bottle, this brew has the typical brut appearance: light golden with a towering head. The head was far more stable than I expected, and the beer wasn't quite as clear as it could be, but it's still very attractive. (Protein haze?) The aroma is a little fruity and yeasty, with a touch of alcohol. It's not really remarkable in any way. The taste, however, is spot on. It's very fruity, semi-dry, has a touch of pale malt flavor, and a characteristic Belgian ester quality. Nice. The finish is well balanced, with a nice bitterness. Light in body, and very spritzy. The head is truly remarkable on this beer. It lasts long after draining the glass."
"White peach colored ale with a small, cramy head of white foam. Smells like an old Belgian Pale, but does have some nice elements of peach, nectarine, pineapple. Has some nice elements, but smells like a De Proef brew or an old Belgian. Flavor is heavily phenolic, spicy and very citrusy, almost sour. Lemon, tropical fruits, with hints of vanilla."
"Pours a slightly hazed yellow, big head forms, quickly settles to a thin layer, leaves some lace spots behind. Smell is sweet, some hay, veggies, honey, wheat, some citrus, spice, neat. Taste is honey, citrus, grass, light floral, sweet middle, dry spicy finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, little bit prickly. Not sure what to think of this one, but I did enjoy it. Thanks Jan!"
"This beer poured a hazy straw yellow colour with a white cap of fine foam. Fair head retention with some spotty lacing. Mellow aroma overall, with notes of straw, light alcohol, grain, and lemon. Same in the flavour, along with very light bitterness, some fruit, and spicy alcohol in the finish. The body was just on the light side and carbonation was quite high, decent texture. Nicely balanced and quite refined, surprisingly light and refreshing (considering the abv). Thanks Jan!"
"This is just another Malheur work of art."
"drinkability is good. balanced, light, and very refreshing. good stuff."
"For anyone fortunate enough to have this, consider yourself lucky. Keep this one tucked away for a special occasion (I did ;) )"
"Overall, a very drinkable beer. Quite ""classy"" for a beer. Glad I have another bottle. Definitely a ""save for special occasion"" type of beer."
"Taste is also good but IMO litle sweet. Next to that maltyness, alcohol and very clean( bottom fermented like) yeastpalate. Bitter aftertaste makes this one just a pleasure to drink. Maximum carbonisation and the full palete makes this one to something extraordinary in mouthfeel and well worth revieuwing it as my 500th."
