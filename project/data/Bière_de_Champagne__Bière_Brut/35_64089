3.96,22.6,4,4.25,3.75,4,4,"As someone who drinks a lot of wine as well as beer, this was a phenomenal experience. Pours hazy golden orange with lingering bits of carbonation sitting on top. Smell is orange rind and other citrus and bready champagne yeast. Very floral on the nose as well. the first taste is all orange and yeast, subdued and balanced flavor which I think is what gets the beer it's low rating from the majority of BAs, however this isn't a beer that's supposed to slap you in the face with hops or dark chocolate or bourbon flavor, it's supposed to showcase the yeast. This is a rich floral beer with a great mouthfeel and really nothing overwhelmingly negative to it. The price wasn't an issue for me because it was free at a friend's house for a small party. If you've ever had a grand cru champagne in your life you would appreciate this beer. If you just look past the price tag, you would appreciate this beer. If you store and open the bottle correctly, you would appreciate this beer.","msanborn","Jan 19, 2015"

Medicinal aroma mixed with some green apple and maybe some tropical fruits.  Strange, almost chemical like flavor. Alcohol is very noticeable and seems much stronger than the listed 10%. Produces an almost burning sensation on the tongue as the carbonation comes to the forefront.  Very disappointing collaboration between 2 normally strong breweries.","leroybrown10","Dec 27, 2014"

This is the first Bi√®re de Champagne that I can remember drinking and I personally really enjoyed the style. It is very sweet, but I thought the sweetness was well complemented and balanced by the champagne-type mouthfeel, which made this go down easy for me (even with the high alcohol) and made the beer stand out from others. I'm not even a huge fan of champagne, but this beer seemed to me to combine the best of both champagne (delicate mouthfeel, gentle sweetness) and beer (stabilizing malt base). Would love to drink more of this, or try more beers in this style.","AmyfaceNYC","Jun 02, 2014"

Nose was Belgian-y, like a quad, and sweet with some alchohol.  The champagne bubbles - still enough to overflow the bottle upon popping the cork - strip flavors off the tongue and cut the sweetness.  This is good as the flavors are brown sugar, rock candy and malts sweet, again similar to a quad.  Overall - glad we tried it, no off flavors from over-aging.  It was an experience, not a go-to.","WOBrewstraveler","Feb 14, 2014"

Aroma of funky yeast, pear, peaches, mango, pineapple, and a hint of spice (coriander?). Some definite honey aroma. Actually quite aromatic and fruity. Flavor has a sharp strange bite. Almost like it is sour. Very dry with lots of carbonation. Light and slick mouthfeel. The sharpness takes away from what seems to be a nice fruity Belgian/Saison brew. Did something go wrong? Not bad overall, but this could have been better. Does seem to grow on me as it goes, with fruit flavors coming out.","BMMillsy","May 02, 2013"

As someone who loves bananas and caramel, this turns out to be rather brilliant, even if it is pricey. I would recommend it as a gift and with autumn around, it's toasty enough for the current cold weather.

Very sweet and very strong initial taste of alcohol. The after taste was heavy on the fruit taste. No orange or citrus at all, but more of a sweet apple or pear taste, and mild caramel on the end. The mouthfeel was very Bubbly, and light. Over all I would give this beer a 3 out of 5. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great. I wont be getting this for our Celebration. SIDE NOTE: The people that were trying it with me said that it had a slight after taste of soy sauce. I didn't taste this but they insisted that I add it to my review to warn the masses.","zipyth3pinhead","Dec 10, 2011"

There is also a presence of grapes and citrus along with a slight grassy hop bite. Complex but not strong. The mouthfeel was very carbonated and dry.

This might be a well received style in parts of the world, and this beer might even fit that style well, but this is where I draw the line.

Reminds me a bit of Orval with the sour tart and a bit of funk on the nose, and somewhat on the taste as well on the lighter side of sour and tart and some of the lighter noble hop/citrus floral tastes. Is this very drinkable? No, not at the 10.30% ABV, but still light like champagne and pretty nice overall. Like I mentioned, I had this about 7 months ago on New Years Eve and remember it being much more offensive on the palate. Maybe that's because I was a bit inebriated at the time. Maybe 7 months of aging has done it nicely. Either way, my official rating of this beer will stand at a 3.5. Pretty lofty considering I was thinking this was going to get straight 2.5s or lower before I opened it.

The taste is easier to swallow that the smell leads you to think, but it is still medicinal, vegetable hinted, and soured. On top of that, add fizzy body and you've got infinium. Overpriced.

The taste was pleasant with a honey sweetness and layers of malt but the hops took a back seat for balancing this one out. It was the drinkability that took a slight turn for the worse. The sweet sparkling wine quality gave way to a malt liquor cooked corn taste that lost its appeal after awhile. I can see why people lost interest at this point.

Um...sorry folks, I'm not sure where that leaves you. If you're looking for a definitive answer, I'm not going to be much help. Try it yourself and see what you think.

Brownish orange color, at times suggests red or yellow, seems to change a lot given the viewing angle, consistent in the steady flow of tight bubble beads throughout. The sour, vinous aspect to the nose frames the whole while making adequate room for butterscotch, caramel sweetness and a blend of white grapefruit and blood orange citrus, more outright herbaceous than hoppy, buttered croissant flakes, strong apricot, peach and yellow apple fruit presence, at times peppery, overall truly needs what sourness it can muster or would smell way too sweetly. Full-bodied, in spite of the constant gentle churn from the carbonation tends to recline across the palate rather than move. Lots of white grape flavor, at once welcomes and pushes aside the peach, apricot, apple, banana fruit flavors. The honey, ginger, butterscotch, toffee accents weight it down further. Reduced and heavy, the sourness in the mandarin orange, lemon citrus can't bring life. Barley, lentil, and sage lend some breadth. The doughiness mostly unbaked and raw. Lingering tacky sweetness through the finish, could use added freshness and lift.

Once it finally settled down it looked good with a clean body and creamy inch of white head with sticky lace and retention. It looked good, but loses points for a bit for the ordeal. The smell is slightly bitter with a granny smith aroma. it's rounded out being kind of yeasty. As far as the taste goes I always have trouble with a unique beer like this. It's dry, yeasty and slightly bitter to finish out. I kind of detect apples on the pallet but overall this seems kind of lame. I kind of feel like this was bubbly and to over carbonated, the body is light and crisp though. Honestly I didn't love this.

Wow...was I wrong...this is nothing like the other champagne brews. Instead, the beer has a richer, more amber color. It is certainly effervescent...bubbly, and dry. But, it's also very, very malty. Lots of malt character, from the first smell through the finish. The alcohol plays tricks with the malt...giving a boozy, rum-like scent and flavor. There is a bit of fruit, and a notable crispness to the beer as well. It is moderately bitter, and there are some distant herbal hop notes. The centerpiece, however, is the malt. The malt and alcohol do become tiresome after a while....not a beer for quantity. Yeast play a key role in the beer's character as well. It mouthfeel is medium-light. This one is interesting. It's a technical curiosity...getting a bubbly-like brew from all malt...but it's also a bit one-dimensional, and that does become tiresome, effecting drinkability.","Suds","Jan 14, 2011"

I'm picking up notes of wood and citrus too, with a touch of spicy/earthy hops off the back- Saaz, maybe? Mouthfeel is light and crisp tending dry, with a subtle, fruity/herbal tea aftertaste.

Not yum here. The body is a light medium, with an active carbonation, a fizzy feel, and a very dry finish. Overall, I applaud the experimentation, but the final product does not do it for me at all.

Despite the initial shock of sour apple, it easily transformed into softer sweet, chewy, bready malts and the belgian yeast with a touch of spice swirling around golden delicious apples. The mouthfeel was very smooth, creamy and refreshing and I found it very difficult to detect the 10% alcohol in the taste - that presented itself in a nice warming sensation that built gradually. Overall, I think I've decided that this beer is more like a heavy champagne than any kind of beer, even though it nicely holds qualities from both categories. I do not think many beverages, regardless of what they are made of or where/how they are made, are worth $20+, but that is no reason for me to go and rip apart how this beer let me down, was a disappointment, or didn't live up to my expectations. If I were to go into every beer (or any experience for that matter) expecting to encounter every good rumor and all the built-up hype I had heard about it, I would be severely disappointed with a lot of things in life.

Do I really want a 20 dollar bottle of beer, that I know nothing about? I decided to take the dive. This one uncorked beautifully with a loud pop, and pours effervescently much like a bottle of champagne. I don't see how they recreated a new style of beer there are a handful of brut biers out there like Deus off the top of my head. Pours a deep honey golden hue with a large white head forming thick, as it dwindles down large bands of white lacing stick to my fluted large pilsner glass. Nose is really interesting a blend of syrupy notes and green apple cider and white grapes pretty interesting mix. Even a touch of caramel glides in here from the malt content, a light herbal/grassiness from the hops. Flavor provides bountiful sweet fruit tones with warming green apple/white grape and bready yeast notes. Dry finish tingles the back of the throat, flavor wise alcohol doesn't peak through it's more in the warming in the stomach that gives the abv away. Medium bodied slightly cloying finish between the dryness and the nutty caramel cloying kick that doesn't fit in the picture. Carbonation wasn't my issue it just wasn't an enjoyable experience, a beer that should pass as the hype dwindles down. I would rather buy both a Sam Adams 12 pack sampler and a Weihenstephan gift pack four around 27 dollars where I would get 5 16oz bottles with a wheat beer glass and a 12 pack of 12 ounce samplers instead of 20 bucks for a corked 750 ml bottle.

A lot of orange and lemon flavors along with lots of white grapes. The mouthfeel starts off nice with a crisp bite to it, but then finishes with a not so pleasant feeling that is hard to explain.

Poured in to a Sam Adams snifter, the color is clear orange, with a good amount of foamy white head. The scores of air bubbles in this beer suggest that it is high in carbonation. From the nose I pick up some soft peach and pear notes, mango, baked bread, and a hint of spice. Flavor is dry, yet sweet, with many of the same traits found in the smell, but not nearly as accentuated or clear. As another reviewer stated, it does have a hint of Boston Lager to it (a byproduct of the yeast I am assuming). I also get a minor hint of funk. Like champagne, the mouthfeel is well carbonated, scrubbing the palate well, and medium in body. The alcohol is well hidden, which is a plus given its overall strength. I am not sure where Sam Adams/Weihenstephaner got the idea that this is a new style of beer, as there are others out there (not many, but still). I don't think I would throw down another twenty for a bottle, but it is worth trying given that there are so few examples of this style around.

While being an exellent brew, it's not amazing, and would'nt really search it out again given the price on it and not being great. Again, not bad in any sense, just not worth the hype. Good to try once. Feel free to request a change of style if you think there's a better fit.","LtCracker20","Dec 03, 2010"
