"Serving type: bottle."
"Overall, this was a beer saved for and enjoyed for a celebration!!  In brief, today we both received our first residency interview invitations at the same place, thus allowing us to stay together throughout the remainder of our training.  Highly exciting stuff.  The most surprising thing about this beer was its feel.  It is shockingly heavy on the feel, but gives you a wonderful drying cleanliness before each sip is gone.  As far as the taste goes, for something labeled “Brut”, the driest possible form of champagne, this is a brightly and cloyingly sweet drink.  The residual sugars are high, along with that big booziness, suggesting a big, big grain bill during the brewing process.  For this first foray into the style we are pleased, but not wooed.  This was a nice introduction, but I believe we would prefer something a bit tamer, dryer, and more refined stylistically."

"This beer is supposed to beer a mix between a champagne wine and regular beer, but except for the yeast flavor and the bottle type, i really didn't taste the link with a 'champagne'. It is a decent blond beer, with a very strong carbonation where the yeast flavor and smell (champagne yeast) is very dominant."

"As is the style - highly carbonated, had to wait a bit for it to settle. But well worth the wait. The dry hopped flavor is really on show, bringing out a character not unlike a double IPA. Definitely recommended if you have not tried this style."

"O: Not a bad biere de champagne. It's surprisingly light with hidden alcohol, especially given 12% ABV. Not nearly as good as the Enlightenment Brut I had recently though, I doubt I'd get this one again. This one is a little drier and more like a typical champagne, I will say."

"The beer is hazy and straw yellow hued with a half inch of lasting white head. The aroma brings yeast, lemons, bready malts, grass. Smells good. Nice flavor as well. Easy drinking, especially considering the 12% abv. Bold yeast flavors with a touch of hops. Additional notes of citrus and a light, bready sweetness. The finish is dry, with warming alcohol notes. Overall, this a tasty beer. I would have it again."

"Beer is light in body, airy on the palate, sweet up front with a little bit of a dry finish to the whole thing. I like the yeast on the palate, probably the best Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut I've ever had, I might even have it again."
"o - Overall a very nice, crisp beer. I thought it was more like 7%% so was surprised to see such a high ABV. Worth checking out and woul revisit it."
"Pours a fairly-clear straw-golden color with a nice white head and some good lacing on the way down. The nose brings some pear, melon, and green grapes. Plenty of light fruit and a bit of spice. The flavor continues down the same path, with the fruit in the front. A bit of booze on the back end. Light body with high carbonation and a crisp, clean finish. Quite good."

"750 ml bottle poured into Malhuer chalice. White frothy head, medium retention. Suddsy lacing. Lots of small bubbles climbing to the surface. Straw gold in color. High clarity. Aroma sweet/malty, slight butter. There is a champagne like taste to the beer of course but less so than expected. High carbonation, pretty nice. "

"O - Overall I felt this was a good beer, just not worth the steap price tag (over $25). This would be a tough buy for me to make. Better beers to spend your money on (outside of this style)."
"My wife and I opened this to toast for the first night of Chanukah. Malheur was a great decision for the occasion."

"O - This is not as nice as the Deus because it doesn't have enough champagne like carachteristics. However its a very unusual beer and well worth a shot."
"Overall, one fantastic drink to be had and would enjoy to have again."
"Dr: Fairly easy drinking. Fair quality and rather refreshing. High price."
"O/D - No alcohol to be noticed. Nice beer for sure. I was suprised by the drinkability on this. It was quite tasty."
"Great beer."
"The CPJ"
"WS"
"D: The alcohol is well hidden from the taste because of the high amount of carbonation, which make."
"Drinkability is very good with some light malts and sweetness, lots of bubbles to clear the palate, and for being 12% drinks like half that."
"Having said that, some of the characters here seem typical of poorly aged beer. While I think that a 12% bottle should hold up pretty well, I have to be a bit more generous with my scores than I would otherwise have been."
"It's a very nice Belgian brew. Stylistically, I think it's a little faulty, especially for a beer which calls itself a Bière ""Brut"" (not even a Bière de Champagne), but it's a lovely Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Very drinkable; smooth, but accentuated with the characters it needs. A very pleasant Belgian style beer."
"Farmy pizza dough, dried lemon, and sugary Fuji apple sweet aroma. Taste is initially dry up front instead of in back. That's interesting. White cracker and mild corn meal sweetness. Sweeter as it warms. Champagne-ish aftertaste."
"Certainly a sipper, this is a beer to be reckoned with. While not a fan personally, it would be stupid to deny its greatness."
"Drinkability -- This is a very unique experience for me. Very delicate, with mellow sweetness and a touch of spice. if you can pony up the money, this is a fun diversion from more familiar styles."
"More robust in sweetness and body than most Belgian Strong Pale Ales but with the upmost carbonation of champagne, this beer begs for a celebration of some sort."
"750ml bottle. Cork comes off with a bang so impressive I actually created a thread about the experience. Vinous aroma of soft yeast, lemon, and hay. Actually captures some of the magic that the old Dulle Teve 750ml gave, with cobwebs, lemon, and a brilliant yeast strain. Here, the nuances are just a bit young, but are still interesting enough to really enjoy it. Has a stale kind of finish that could be drier and shorter, otherwise this is fantastic."
"D: Hefty at 11%, but expertly concealed. Bière de Champagne is delicious and this is my recommended brand. An experience never to be missed."
"I've never heard of this style before but I really like the beer. It's a lot like a blond ale in color but I guess a lot stronger. The alcohol is very well hidden and the flavor is quite good and unique. A little sour but generally a great pale flavor and aroma."
"Post Scriptum: Malheur Brut's ABV is 11° and not 12°"
"Nice beer. Bottle opened with a nice pop. Poured a large off white foamy frothy head that lasts and good lacing. Color is a hazy light yellow amber. Aroma is spicy yeast malt and a hint of skunk hop. It is a green bottle and I kept it out of the light so maybe it got a little light struck at the store. Flavor is like aroma minus the skunk and much sweeter. In fact the sweetness dominates. Body is decent and good carbonation. Finish is a little more bittersweet than sweet. A hint of the alcohol."
"Pours cloudy dirty gold, gobs of carbonation in the beer which manifests itself in a giant white head. Lots of lacing and retention in the foam, with large beads leaving my glass almost looking like a bubble bath with hills of foam and clusters of bubbles strewn across the side of the glass. The aroma has spicy esters that mingle with alcohol causing a bit of tingle in the nose. A bit vinous ala champagne plus maybe clove and apple skins. The flavor at first has pears or cider, fruity yet tart, big spicy yeast notes and alcohol on the midpalate then a very dry and bready finish. The Belgian yeast lends most of the flavor to this beer, so tart and spicy fruits are the name of the game. Body is moderate with lots of creamy carbonation, the bubbles bleed out fairly quickly, I like it better as the bubbles calm down, though it seems to almost go flat. This is fairly tasty once my palate acclimatizes to the tart yeast character and I can appreciate the spice and fruit subtleties."
"Happy Mardi Gras!"
"Impressed!"
"3.5/3.5/4/4/5"
"The aroma leads me to think this one is going to be yeasty maybe even slight fruity but with a dry character. The appearance is hazy golden with a large head and lots of lace. The taste is dry and slightly yeasty but no real fruit to speak of. The palate is thin. Overall it's a very drinkable beer with a large price tag. I think it's not worth the price but I think it's worth a try if you can get some."
"This was the first Malheur beer I tried and it was presented with much flair at a Dallas steakhouse. They treated the presentation with the same care as that of a fine wine so I was a little less put off than my original concern of the high price tag. Poured into snifters in small amounts the beer was a turbulent dark brown with a white fine head that left some good lacing as we enjoyed. The aroma of this was so complex that it seemed to change as the beer went down. Started with dark fruit of raisins and prunes and ended with a long malt flavor that had a great full mouthfeel. The natural carbonation was light and complimented the style well. I will look around for more Malheur beers for sure but certainly to enjoy at home considering the price. This was certainly a beer to remember for it complexity and fine flavors, it was reminiscent of champagne and was very enjoyable."
"The beer pours a striking gold color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose I get some honey and light lemon-lime, which really smells very nice. Flavors replicate the nose, except there's a decided sweet ice tea flavor that adds to my enjoyment of this beer. This beer is highly carbonated, which tends to give the moderately sweet flavor profile a certain lightness it might not have otherwise. Alcohol is very well disguised and drinkability is very, very good. Wow. This is really pretty nice. Impressive."
"A very tasty, solid, and warmly effervescent quaff, highly suitable for all your celebratory needs."
"Overall an interesting beer but not enjoyable enough to justify the price. Next time I'll stick with the much more enjoyable Dark Brut as the base beer they use in that one (Malheur 12) survives the bottle conditioning much better."
"Brought a bottle back from Belgium where it wasn't crazy expensive. In a nutshell, this beer was like a Belgian sugar cookie in a glass. There's a strong, but not too rich bready sweet cookie flavor with hints of cinnamon, sugar candy, and a hint of lime. This is very, very drinkable while being pleasantly complex. If this beer weren't $25+ I'd definitely drink more."
"Not a bad introduction to the style. If this is past the ""best by"" date, then I wonder what it's like before it. I'd like to try the dark version of this one w/ chocolate. Recommended."
"I couldn't drink this fast enough. Flavor was apple-driven, with a nice breadiness, a little spice and minor Pilz notes. I detected soft butter, nuts, a little banana and coriander. This is exceptionally well-crafted and I'm just sorry I didn't buy at least 6 bottles."
"Light-medium in body with a smooth to light crispiness in the end which equals a nice mouthfeel and definite good drinkability...I look forward to drinking this one again."
"D- Alcohol content well hidden, so one must be careful."
"Overall I was impressed and will hopefully try a few more of this style. I'm happy with paying 10 dollars for this, but the ~$25 price tag I've heard others speak of seems a bit steep."
"Drinkability: I am seriously disappointed with this beer. I have had Biere Brut before and especially like the Deus, but this being less than OK was unexpected. Normally I like sour notes and love beers with them. Didn't expect the Malheur to be a sour beer but would have welcomed it."
"It was paired with a parmesan risotto cake atop loch duart salmon in a roasted garlic cream sauce, which was made with the beer, and sauteed broccolini. Thank you Monk's Kettle New Year's Eve dinner."
"Hazey, thick looking hay but with some awesome champagne like bubbling. Great retention of the two finger head to start. Plus the light suspended sediment reminds me of a wheat beer. Though, at the same time, I may have held on to this beer a little too long. Great looking beer. Dry pilsner malt aroma plus the yeasty notes of kiwi, pineapple, and unripened peaches. Bubbley effervescant and dry palate brings out the exotic fruits well. Add to that some faint, minty hops and some granny smith apples. Very tastey, unnoticeable abv. unless you take an overzealous gulp. Great beer to toast in the NEW YEAR!!!"
"It is not Deus (barely), but it is one amazing beer. A lower price tag, and I would have this every week. Quite an experience."
"Alcohol is reasonably well-covered for abv, though it does show some. A beer-drinkers replacement for champagne. Interesting style. I do prefer this to the Deus, which I thought less complex/more yeasty. A unique beer for a special occassion."
"D: The high ABV (again, not well hidden) and tons of carbonation limit the drinkability on this one."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice cloudy golden pale yellow color, very nice carbonation, very nice two-finger plus creamy/foamy white head, with tons of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty with some yeast, spices, nice notes of grapes, pineapple. The taste is very nice, malts/yeast, spices, grapes/pineapple. Medium body, the finish is slightly dry/bitter, the alcohol is hidden very well. Very drinkable, this is a nice one. Thanks Anthony."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thick bubbly white head. Crisp fruit aroma with belgian yeast, spice and hops. Extremely quaffable considering the high ABV. Crisp fruit flavor of grape, apple and pear, champagne yeast with a nice creamy texture. Excellent!"
"Tastes wet with strong fruit and mild phenols. Mild peppery edge. Fruit is tropical, oranges, apples. Drying biscuit malt. Md-light body, yet still hangs on the tongue. Nice."
"but beware of the DAMNED GREEN BOTTLES! with such a high price point, i would advise AGAINST getting one off the shelf, and only getting it directly from the case it's delivered in."
"This is a good, if expensive, beer. Enjoy with sophisticated friends on a special occasion."
"pours with a huge stable white cloud-like head, easiest perfect appearance score ever ... lots of nice and interesting flavours ... yellow gold colour ... smells of a hefe-tripel champagne mix ... shocked to find out it is 11% ... 'here kitty kitty' ... an extremely enjoyable beer, worth $25 , i don't know, good stuff though.."
"Pours a rich maroon opaque color with a nice sized fizzy head atop. Smell is dark caramel, and raisons. Taste is the same with burnt, tart and sweet raisons and dark caramel with an incredibly fizzy, bubbly and foamy mouthfeel that I tend to not like. Champaign like mouthfeel, in fact. Certainly isn't bad, but the mouthfeel really inhibits the enjoyability for me."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, pours medium apricot, quite cloudy, under a nice looking off white head. Retention looks decent and the fades to a tiny bubble nice looking film and also plenty of intricate and sticky lace. Floral and fruity nose, with traces of yeast and lemony spice. Full flavor Belgian, the expected coriander, citrus, pepper, gin, and yeast show up in all their glory. Pleasingly dry, with tart and crisp hopping. Loads of lime, tonic, gin, pepper all follow through the center and towards the finish. Large and bold, go get some of this classy, and thoroughly enjoyable rejoice offering, Belgian lovers rejoice."
"dry, floral, yeasty aroma. Lots of citrus aromas. Superb soft mouthfeel. The dry bitterness hits immediatly and lingers far into the finish. Alcohol was very well hidden, but warming all the way through. A very unique beer."
"D: very drinkable, smooth, and pleasant on the tongue. Alcohol is pretty well hidden for 11%. Overall a very refined Belgian that drinks like a champagne."
"A tasty beer and a first of for the style for me."
"The cork was easily extracted, and as soon as it was freed, the beer started to foam upwards in the bottle. The process continued in the Duvel tulip glass, forming a big foamy head occupying half of the space. The beer itself looked cloudy, pale golden, and airy. The aroma was very yeasty and bready, and some floral smells lingered on. Tasted peppery, sweet, musty, and phenolic and semi dry. The alcohol was well hidden and I was surprised to glance up at the listing to see 11% put up there. Not as clean as I would have liked in the finish as some metallic bitterness lurked in there. Airy and creamy in the mouth. A bit too rich for my waller at the regular price, but the sale was sweet indeed."
"My first Brouwerij De Landsheer beer is a beauty. Biere Brut (Brut Reserve) is everything that I had hoped it would be and more. The price tag will probably keep me from buying it again, but I'm ecstatic that I threw caution to the wind and brought a bottle home. Tres magnifique!"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep golden ale with a small bubbly head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of light sweet malt notes with some weird ester or maybe it's the yeast but something is surely different. Taste is sweeter and lighter then expected with some sweet malt and light yeasty bready finish. Body was full with some low filtration and some great carbonation. Alcohol is not apparent which is quite surprising considering the 11% contained in this beer. I am glad I tried this but considering the price tag it is unlikely I will try this again."
"Overall, a very nice beer. Good for ""special"" occasions. Champagne-like. Very drinkable and has an undetectable abv [which is dangerous]. Very versatile with food. Highly recommend this one."
"I could drink this all night long if it was $5 a bottle, but it is not. Didn't really notice the alcohol at all in this one. The price puts it out of the range of a beer that i would have the pleasure of drinking regularly, but it was very nice to try it. Get a bottle and celebrate with some friends."
"Pours a clouded straw with a big white head. Lots of lacing on the way down. Flavor is very champagne like and smooth. But there is also that level of Belgian ale that is oh-so-obvious. Lots of sugar. Good bit of what seems like hops. Feel has a lot of carbonation to it and it feels pretty soft on the mouth. Definitely drinkable, but more so a sipper. I have been keen on finding another good biere de champagne after trying Deus, and this is the first one that has made it worth the money. I kind of feel like this is Duvel on speed. That consistent and steady ride that doesn't really take you anywhere mind blowing, but it's still pretty damn good."
"Drinkability: A refined, elegant drink not sullied one single bit by the fact that is was served alongside pork rinds."
"Truly a beer that needs to be drunk in quantity to really enjoy; I would have written this off as a really good beer, but not great, if I had not had multiple glasses of this brew. I really can't ask any more of either the appearance (especially if I had poured it out all at once) or the palate of this beer; it really is just spot on for this brew."
"Awesome champagne-like mouthfeel with sweet and slightly bitter finish. This is good stuff, great aroma, but definately a special occasion bottle- mostly due to the extreme price."
"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Pizza Port Belgian Beer Fest. Pour from a 750mL.Aroma finds itself as touching in slightly sickly malt and coarse cigarette ash. Cloudy deep yellow pour, with white rim. Flavor a rich, tawny creamed malt carrying the nicely belgian yeast notes, with high rich phenols but none of the harshness of chemical notes. Gently percolating in attenuated beauty. Aroma suffers but flavor and body are crisply done."
"Pale straw color with a thin head. Sweet maly aroma that was oddly close to a macro lager smell. Light, sweet, sugary malt flavor not unlike plain sugar cookies. Very fine, sharp carbonation. Medium/light body with a sweet, almost adjunct like finish. Cost me $45 for a 750ml at a bar. I was in a good mood - just got a raise at work, otherwise this is totally not worth it."
"Notes: Pretty good. I will have to venture into this style now that this has opened my mind. My biggest turn off was the grainy, wheat frontside. Biggest upside was its amazing depth and out of the box type brewing."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Much like a fine champagne, the crisp mouthfeel becomes more gentle after the initial swell. All of the flavors distribute nicely to various parts of the tongue, presenting a balanced show of hops, spice, and gigantic malty sugars. Again, my only real problem with this beer is the strength... as an aperitif, it wore me out a bit early this evening."
"BB 15-04-06. Perfect presentation with a good and lasting head, clear pale golden beer and bubbles that just keep on pearling up. Very good nose also giving lots of hops and malts and overal very enjoyable. As is taste being dry and bitter with slight maltnote. Yes this is a wonderfull brew to celebrate a good occasion with. Lovely beer that has unbelievable amount of CO2 and makes mouthfeel as a real champagne. Easy drinkable and highly enjoyable."
"Drinkability: This is an all around excellent beer. I really have no complaints about this beer except for it is not in my fridge at this moment. I'll have to do something about that. This is a lovely beer that I encourage everyone to try."
"I remember liking this beer; now, I'm infatuated...maybe it's just the booze talking, but I'm in a state of pure adulation."
"This beers reminds me of a Gueze. Not what I was expecting when the label said Brut Reserve."
"Golden body with a huge spectacular carbonation level. Enormous white head keeps climbing the glass sides instead of going down and this lasts for a good 2 minutes. Aroma is desert-dry, very floral and yeasty. It does smell spritzy. Wild fruitiness (apples, pears, orange, apricot). Superb soft mouthfeel, bubbly, smooth with every bubble tickling the tongue. As soon as it enters the mouth, the barnyardy and hay compenents get transported everywhere in the mouth. The dry bitterness hits immediatly and develops in a complex manner during the long finish. It didnt seem all that complex in mouth though. No alcohol gets felt ever, but this is warming all the way through. A masterpiece of the brewing art. Cheers Martin."
"I was most fortunate to purchase a few bottles of this while in Brussels for about 10 Euros, and I think that is a steal after trying my first. It is a hazy golden color and a big fluffy, white head. The aroma is part fruity and part delicate, earthy hops. I think it is very complex. Some of the tastes I noticed were peach, apricot and vanilla. It finishes with a spicy hop finish. The beer is light and refreshing despite a hefty ABV. I had no trouble finishing the whole 750 mL bottle in by myself as I did not want to share my new found treasure."
"Love it."
"(25.45 oz. corked and wire caged champagne bottle)"
"Head very creamy and compact, cream, milk, strawberry in the flavour, even citrus fruits (lime, orange, bergamotto?). Peach. The colour is orange, full and intense. Taste: licorice, wood (tobacco?), pepper (more than in the smell). The bitter is strong in the aftertaste, very persistent. After 10-15 minutes in the smell appears hints of sour black cherry and strawberry, and pepper, more strong. This beer is very complex, but it is very well balanced, even with the alcool, not very low. Aftertaste bitter of hop, very pleasant. The taste, and mostly the flavour changes a lot at the rise of the temperature, growing again the complexity of this very interesting beer. Then rise again spices... A beer absolutely to taste! (even if it is a little expensive... how you can do if the drinkability is high?)"
"Nothing really champagne like at all as others suggest. Still very big and powerful. Heavy mouthfeel, with some detergent flavour with some peppery alcohol, like many tripels. In fact this reminded me of a blend between Westmalle Tripel, Chimay White and Orval. Complex and rich, yet i don't really think they pulled this one off as well as they could have, still a nice one though."
"Drinkability & Notes: A bit champagne like but with the beer qualities there is no confusion. This is beyond Duvel and the like, not better just more complex."
"Maybe, perhaps! But it is still a damn good beer to celebrate with."
"Pours a golden orange with a thick amount of bubbly, champagne-like head. Tart, fruit aromas are most dominate with a hint of sweetness. A very nice belgian brew with some candi sugar like sweetness, citrusy tanginess and a good mouth filling sweetness. Was expecting less than I got and was pleasantly surprised. A very intriguiging beer that is worth checking out at least once. Not something to make a session beer out of."
"The beer pours a slightly foggy orange color, the head is mountainous, frothy, long lasting and fine sheets of lace cover the glass. Nose malt, fruit sweet, to me the aroma of over ripe plums, tart, not bad mind you, just something unexpected. Front is malt sweet, the top is middling, and the finish is potently acidic, beneficently hopped, with a Sweet and Sour long lasting aftertaste, quite complex. Also the large ABV, gives a nice ""tummy"" warming feeling, a very interesting beer. Normally something that I don't think would be high on my list, but I do have a few bottles aging away, so let's see what I think next year and the year after."
