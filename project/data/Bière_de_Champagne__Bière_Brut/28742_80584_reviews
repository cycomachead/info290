"O-Have been wanting to try this one for quite some time. It's very interesting but I wouldn't want to spend the money on a whole bottle."

"O: Sweeter than expected, and with a larger malt body. The yeast complexity is nice. Maybe a brut version would tickle my fancy a little more, but as it stands this ain't bad."

"Great brew. Been staring at this for a year and pulled the trigger. $17 a bottle isâ€¦creeping toward my top end, but boy is this worth it. Complex and well crafted, and drinkable at 11%. Only other one of this style I've had is Infinium by Sam Adams. SA is absolute sewage compared to this, and actually is more expensive than this. Seek this, trade for this, try this."

"O: This is one hell of a biere de champagne. If you've never had one, they are definitely very saison-ish but with champagne yeast characteristics instead of belgian yeast characteristics (very little in the way of earthiness, black pepper, etc). I hope I described that correct, just giving my impression. Amazing job of hiding the alcohol in this one, this has to be the easiest drinking 11% beer I've ever had. Flavors are well rounded, body isn't overly heavy and there is zero alcohol sting. Seriously good, easily the best of the style that I've ever had."

"It's been a long time since I tried Infinium, but I think this is way better. The execution here is excellent and drinking this is a real treat, if not a beer for everyday."

"What an amazing specimen we have here. If there was any doubt that the United States was the best place in the world to drink beer, this fine example of our product should surely help displace it."
