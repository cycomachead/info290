Aroma is nice and fruity, the brew smells like grapes, tropical fruit, green apples, sauvignon blanc wine, funk, lemon peel, pears, and some earthy aromas. It tastes like sauvignon blanc wine/grapes, funk, oak, lemon peel, yeast, hay, green apples and a bit of apricot. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high but also soft carbonation which helps makes this brew easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good beer. It's pricey at $19.99 a bottle, but I think it's definitely worth trying even at that price.","bluejacket74","Jun 27, 2012"

Nose is evidently bretty, some lemon, malt sweetness and just a pinch of the Nelson Sauvin comes through. More bretty flavour, dry wine and oak notes, malt sweetness and the Nelson Sauvin is much more pronounced. Fruity and melony, a bit funky with a bit of lemon. Really fantastic. Sweet on the palate, moderate effervescence. My first brut, and although I'm not sure if this type of flavour is characteristic of the style, I'm sold. Great complexity.","liamt07","May 05, 2012"

There is also a dry woody quality that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a very bubbly carbonation which I assume is a direct result of the Champagne yeast used in this one.

3.65,-15.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Hazy amber-orange pour with huge, meringue-like three finger head with great lacing and retention. Huge citrus nose at first that quickly give way to a sour, almost musty, vinous aroma that lets you know there's plenty of Brett in this one. The Nelson Sauvignon hops eventually poke their head out, but are pretty much overpowered by the funk of the Brett. The taste follows suit with lots of apple cider tartness and mouth puckering sourness. Hints of pear, lemon zest, apple, melon and a touch of orange emerge early, but are quickly overpowered by the funk of the Brett which dominates. The NS hops are there in a subtle way, but not enough for me. As it warms, the sourness fades a bit and gives way to some subtle sweetness and lots of white wine and oak notes with a touch of pepper. The mouthfeel reminds me a lot of champagne with a nice crisp, dry finish. Nelson Sauvignon are my favorite hops, which led me to grab this. I'm slightly disappointed as the hops are definitely not the star with this beer. And I'm not a fan of Brett in my beer. With that said, this was surprisingly drinkable and I could see why it would be a great beer for those that enjoy Brett.

The nose comprises tart orange, tart lemon, light Brett funk, a decent amount of onion, a bit of cabbage (or something of that ilk) in the very back, and a few hot spots of pine resin here or there. Then things hit the tongue: Hoofah! a blast of Brett right in the kisser (I've gotten compliments on my work in that area...yup...), giving off a lot of blanket, some mild cobweb; there's a bit of orange behind that, along with what seems like oak or cedar or some sort of soft-ish wood. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a pretty damn dry finish, a touch on the sticky side of life (AKA the move-theater-floor side).
