"Dr: Hides its 5% ABV quite well, but is ultimately too expensive for its quality and simplicity to justify a purchase. It's more a rose/champagne sparkling wannabe than a true beer."
"Overall a cracking style of beer that has some legs..."
"My second beer in this style (the other being this beers sister) and I am not impressed. The two I've had are on the weaker and cheaper side of the style, so maybe I'm being unfair?"
