4.62,11.9,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Pours very straw to pale gold with a champagne like liveliness with a thick soapy 2” foam cap that quickly dissipates. Clean fruit and floral aromas and taste with a slight hint of sweetness and some definite white wine qualities. The perception oscillates between a sparkling wine and a beer and you swing between the yeast driven fruit flavors and the light malts.  Very effervescent, medium light body. Very refreshing.","pat61","Mar 06, 2015"

4.35,5.3,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5," DeuS captures that classic persona perfectly. And while $20-$30/bottle may be expensive by beer standards, that amount gets you nowhere in the world of Champagne; a sparkling wine of comparable quality to this would run you at least four times that amount. This is an exceptional example of a rare style. And while it does make for an impressive bottle to show off in the cellar, don’t age it. It’s perfect fresh.

A light, fruity smell with faint air of cask-conditioning (I assume that's what I smelling since they are using champagne storage methods on this beer). A sharp, bitter citric fruit taste along with pears and apples. Also, real smooth in the mouth after you get used to the prickliness and it starts to sweeten up. Almost starts to get slick as it rolls down the tongue and finishes real crisp and dry with oakiness. A great beer, but I've had some Belgians pretty similiar and for $30 I would say try this on a special occasion but it doesn't warrant repeat/regular drinking at that price to me.

Looks just like a glass of champagne would. It smells like candy sugar, grapes, pears, yeast and peppery spice. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pepper, ginger, Belgian yeast, pears, grapes and bananas. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high carbonation but it's soft which makes it feel nice and creamy. Drinkability is very good considering the ABV, and the alcohol isn't very noticable at all.

I've popped the cork out of quite a few bottles of beer, but holy shit that was loud!!! I'm a bit shaken, but I think I can go on. Huge, bubbling, noisy, off-white head fades quickly to a thick film. A bit of bubble gum and candied apricot in the aroma along with a bit of white grapes. The aroma is definitely unique, and I'd say closest to a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. A bit of vanilla, some flowers, cotton candy, and I swear there is a dry white whine flavor in there too (is it mental?). It reminds me a bit of Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde, but even more potent. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy with a fairly strong alcohol burn. I like it...the flavors and aromas are strong and inviting. The alcohol is a bit much, especially when compared to traditional champagne.

Even so, pure white 3 finger head that settled down quickly, leaving zero lace. After sitting for 15-20 minutes, the head is completely gone. Appearance once the head is gone is just like a sauvignon blanc; I could take a picture of it in a wine glass and you'd never know it was beer. Tastes much better after warming up a bit. Refrigerator temperatures are definitely too cold for this beer. Flavors of apple and banana, with just a wee little hint of malt on the finish. No hops detectable...are there even any in this?

It is without a doubt the champagne of beers, very highly carbonated and makes a lovely streaming cascade of bubbles in the glass. Just by looking I could confuse it for champagne, but I'm no champagne expert. Actually, I don't even like champagne. Which make it hilarious that I love this beer! It makes a great special occasion item, just like champagne. The color of this beer in my flute is a very pale straw color, very similar to an American light larger but the similarities end there. The nose is a sweet and musky scent but light for those scents. The mouthfeel is of course very carbonated and light, almost airy. The taste is light and dry with hints of ginger, honey, crisp fruit (maybe green apples but not sour?), and is very complex. Very, very nice.

Taste - pepper up front, then the fruit comes on with a hint of licorice. Very dry finish, but it comes off as refreshing and crisp. Mouthfeel is all about the carbonation, but it has enough ale body to sustain it. Drinkability is excellent.

As my glass slowly heated up (I served it at about 4°C), the sweetness subsudes and the powerful alcoholic effluves take over to give a dry, minty aftertaste, not unlike mouthwash. Letting it warm a bit and pairing this one with a very sweet dessert was somewhat of a mistake, because it really brought the booze out, it became almost like an eau de vie, or white crème de menthe, or maybe even a kirsh, but withouth the cherry pits.

The aroma is like a tripel, a saison, and a strong pale ale mixed as one. Citrus and strong earthy tones battle for dominance. The citrus might come out on top by a hair, but my nose is the real winner. The taste is as immense as the aroma, but with the addition of a large alcohol burn in the finish. I had expected the mouthfeel to feel as carbonated as champagne, and the visible carbonation leads me to believe that it might be. However, although it does feel highly carbonated, the medium-full body of this brew makes the carbonation less detectable. Overall, this is a mighty fine brew that I am glad to have found on sale a couple months ago for $18.99 (used to be $24.99).

The aromas were all edible flowers, and spices, pretty much, not much malt or hop character at all, but it work. Tastes like 'eating flowers', as my friend said. Pretty much a spicy, flowery melange of happenings, like the sph cuvee des fleurs on crack, more carbonated, more boozy, and more flowery. Mouthfeel is spirtzy, dry, effervescent, and perfect.

4.38,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Even the bottle exudes a magnificent charm: elegant, dark and refined. Yes, it could be mistaken for a champagne bottle, but to see such a bottle with the heavenly word "beer" on it makes me bound with excitement. A loud pop and the cork is out, mushrooming and showing on the bottom the Bosteel logo. Wow, the little leaflet provided with the beer says "high level of carbonation and abundant foam," and no kidding. The bottle literally foamed over and would not stop even after pouring 2 glasses in succession. It just kept foaming over through the neck. I had it stored on its side in the fridge the whole time, possibly the reason for this. In a fluted champagne glass this could easily pass for a champagne or sparkling wine--that is, except for the head. Imagine a picture-perfect champagne, but with a bright-white head that leaves lacing. The beer is sparkling and bubbly, a frosty nectarine colour with hues of golden honey. Aspirin white head and one which stays very well in a fluted glass, leaving speckled globs of lace. I also tried it in a chalice glass, and the difference was rather of note: the chalice glass held the cold temperature better, and the champagne glass had better head but seemed to warm the beer quicker. The aroma I found a little similar to Unibroue's Edition 2004, with the same minty and oaky aromas. Deus is definitely more complex however. Behind the oakiness and the light spicy smells, almost cinnamon-like, lurks a subtle but enjoyable tartness that is common to sparkling wines. The aroma to me is also quite yeasty in a way, not in the traditional sense though. This is more like a dustiness that plays with light fruits and faint alcohol. The malt is noticeable, lightly roasted. Vanilla and fresh grass notes, strong mint, and, oddly enough, sake: I get some of the rice-like notes from this as I smell. Grape-like smells too. The taste is quite strongly minty alcoholic, more like a good brandy than sparkling wine though. I get pineapple and rum tastes up front, along with solvent phenols and a crisp dryness, and the finish is quite dry indeed, but leaving notes of buttery malt and honey. In the middle are some almost vodka-like feels, strongly tinged with alcohol. The aftertaste also possesses vertmouth or sherry tastes. Lively carbonation, but perhaps not quite as much as you would expect. The beer feels effervescent at first but actually has some thickness to it. For 11.5%, this is dangerously drinkable--refreshing and cold and incredibly unique. Another excellent bridge-over for wine drinkers, and a style I wish was more readily available.","Cwrw","Jul 30, 2005"

Theres some of hte lemon in there, but there was something that reminded me of a soapyness, but it wasn't bad. I wish I knew what it was that I was tasting. The mouthfeel was very crisp, moderately thick and very sprightly. For a big beer, the alcohol was not apparent at all, except to my head. I was glad this was split 3 ways. A huge thanks to clvand0 for sharing this gem.","kmpitz2","Sep 18, 2004"
3.75,-9.2,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Sweet and candy-like, with many passion fruit notes along with notes of black peppers, honey, melon and peach. The finish is very dry. Poorly hidden alcohol. Not all its cracked up to be. I'm glad I got this for free.","Crosling","Sep 17, 2004"
4.33,4.8,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Thick foamy head, denser than for champagne and lasting, which is good for the appearance and for the mouthfeel. A crazy level of carbonation is observable in the clear golden color body. Fruity smell of sweet peaches and a vendanges tardives aspect (should I write this review in French?). Yeasty and doughy, but aired and subtle. The taste is reminiscent of a fine white wine but sweeter and nicely fruity with very light herbal notes of hops and citric notes of grapefruit and orange peel. The mouthfeel is round and not as dry as for champagne, which I found great. Full, easy to drink thanks to the high carbonation. Nicely chewy with some interesting notes of liquorice in the end and hints of cloves and cinammon. Great mouthfeel and drinkability. A very original brew, that's definitely worth a try.","tjd25","May 30, 2004"

Starts and finishes sweet with spices very smooth. The high ABV is not really noticeable. I had to pause before buying one of these but it was for our anniversary soooo $35.00 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma. To be honest most Belgian beers are good and you can get an equally good one for $30 less.","jdhilt","Apr 30, 2004"
3.39,-17.9,5,3.5,3,4.5,3,"Bottle provided by Kimchee in our tasting with tiggmtl, martint and oakes Appearance is neat. highly carbonated pale blond with a generous white head. Aroma is mineralic, nice at first, but becoming dull and off as it warms, I dont know what to do with this. They say to drink this cold, Ill ensure to try it cold with a next bottle, but for now, something like a cleaning product develops in the warming aroma, something like the yellow of the egg too. Sweet powder sugar is added to the melting with a leafy and spicy counterparts that would actually appear well blended without the phenomenon stated above. In mouth, theres a spritzy dryness, but not as intense as a champaigns and theres definitely still lots of sweetness getting through. Lemony flavors, moderate alcohol, but still well hidden for 11.5%. Theres a slight bitterness that seems slightly off and once again, as it warms, theres a dusty plastic flavor I dont enjoy at all. Nevertheless its extremely original, flowery and initially pleasant, so I assume this bla bla about drinking it cold is to be taken seriously. Mouthfeel is fabulous though, indeed champaigny, heavily carbonated, slightly astringent. Im definitely not buying another bottle though, as good as it looks.","Rastacouere","Apr 26, 2004"

This beer is worth the $20-25 for celebrating a big occasion (birthday, anniversary, etc). It has one of the most unique flavors I've come across yet.

4.32,4.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The beer as is emigrates from the 750ml green corked bottle to my Belgian Triple glass a luminous and limpid gold color, the head Brobdingnagian in size, effervescent, and bright white in color, the lace as the head dissipates a velum like curtain to obscure the glass. The aroma of over ripe granny smith apples, earthy, sweet malt at the back, somewhat acerbic with the start sweet and nice malt presence, the finish is ferine in its acidity, the hops inconspicuous with the aftertaste desert dry, slightly vinous and quite long lasting. Id say its better than most of the blonde Belgians Ive tasted, and well worth a sample, and the 11.5 percent ABV seems well hidden accept for the light tummy warming sensation, but good as it may be, I can think of many Belgians Id rather spend $30.00 on.","Gusler","Feb 27, 2004"

The aroma is strong and sharp with an aroma that reminds me of lemonheads (not lemon since the candy doesn't really taste like lemons). It's almost like the beer has herbs added with a faint herbal nature to the aroma and flavor. It's fairly dry and the malt is pilsner-like.","aracauna","Feb 12, 2004"

Instead of a yeah or nay....we were given this glorious description of wonderous champagne style beer and it's crisp excellence...we were sold and headed back to the table with our champagne style beer in it's large bottle. This is a fun beer...that is what comes to mind. It's very light and effervescent with a zillion nice biting bubbles. It was crisp and clean and well like champagne mated with a nice pale ale. Nice little lemon and slight floral taste but not over powering. This isn't an everyday beer, but I would definitely recommend it for a classy change to New Years champagne, or special occasion.","hollicetales","Jan 09, 2004"

4.4,6.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer poured a very light golden color and formed a nice foamy white head that left circular lace as it slowly subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. The aroma is a heavy mix of citrus, spices and almost candy like elements. The flavor is of citrus and a slight butter aspect to it. This butter like texture is also apparent in the finish which is quite sprite due in part to the carbonation. Is it worth the 20 dollars I spent on it, of course not. But then many of the Dogfish are overpriced in my opinion and why should they have all the fun with experimentation. If these Belgians wanted to do a Champagne style, great for them. Now just make something in a saner price range.","Wildman","Nov 26, 2003"

4.7,13.8,5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Other: After the brewing process is complete and the beer is bottled (with yeast added to the bottle for another fermentation), this beer is then shipped to the Champagne region of France to undergo the full methode champagnoise (Sp?). The bottles are positioned neck down and allowed to remain that way for long enough for the yeast to settle at the bottom of the neck. Then the bottle is dipped in liquid nitrogen, the portion of the neck that contains the yeast plug is broken off. The bottle is then recorked and caged, then sent out to your loving arms. Above is paraphrased from Steven Beaumont's little spiel about this beer.","ManekiNeko","Jun 15, 2003"
2.66,-35.6,3,2,3,2,3,"First, we moved this brew form the fridge to the freezer to get it cold like they said on the bottle. After 1/2 hour it was removed, uncorked, with a big pop, and poured. It poured a large head of creamy fine white bubbles and a very carbonated weak straw yellow body. The head leaves a clinging vine lacing. Its aroma was a bit different and mild. Neither malt nor hop. Almost kind of skunky. My first thought of the taste was yuck! A second sip revieled a bit more character. It was very spicey with clove and licorice. After a few sips, the burps from the fizzy carbonation began to set in. I then let it warm up as I continued to finish the mug I had poured with well over a half a bottle left. At this point, I had rated it 4,3,6,2,12 a 2.7 overall. After letting it warm up, it did not get any better. Complex it is, but after the Rochefort 8, we had earlier, its really hard to live up to it. This is not a brew I would reccommend, especially for the $30 it cost me for 1 bottle.","TheDM","May 15, 2003"
2.9,-29.8,3,3,3,2,3,"First of all, in my opinion, this brew is way overpriced to say the least because I do not feel it is all that great of a brew. It poured a large white invigorating foamy head and there was not that much lacing on the sides of my glass. The aroma was a combination of being spicy, fruity and a slight clove aroma. There was carbonation observed and the body was a pale yellow. The taste of this brew was fizzy and tingly which is not much to my liking when it comes to taste. I was not impressed to say the least and the cost is way out of line in my personal opinion. Even if I really, really liked this brew, I would still say that it is way overpriced.","hotstuff","Apr 17, 2003"
4.49,8.7,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"The bottle blew like a land mine, covered the sink and one side of the fridge. Hazy bright peach from the final yeast pitch (the 4th), head flattens to less than an 1/8 of an inch after the spurting released the primary carbonation. Decent string laces. Spicy aroma, huge amounts of pumpkin pie spice and associated sweetness. A little bit of model paint phenolic whiffs, as well. Tea-like and steeped in associated flavors, clove and ginger, lots of nutmeg predominate with a black pepper bite up front. Finishes with a bitter date-like and apricot liquor cordial impression and a fully rounded aftertaste. Decided body overall. Sense of alcohol and huge amounts of reminders of the sip. Survives low temperatures very well. Very nice, complex without an obvious hop...big. Wish the bottle didn't blow (I may have jostled it too much), I missed out on about 1/4 of the volume here. Minnesota, we should all take advantage of this beer's availability, the distributor is shaky and stores like Thomas Liquors only have six (well, five) on hand.","ADR","Jan 15, 2003"
