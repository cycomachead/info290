"Drinkability – This wasn’t as good as I expected for one of the top rated Bière Bruts."

"This has aged gracefully and though I think I preferred it fresh this has it's own intriguing set of nuances that makes it special. Much like champagne picks up truffle, earth, mineral qualities as it cellars this seems to go the same route thanks to a substantial malt base and Brett yeast presence."
""
"O: 4.5 Very flavorful and easy drinking. Not particularly sour or funky, but those characteristics go well with the barrel and hops."

"O: Another awesome Belgian-style ale from Mikkeller. I cannot recommend this one highly enough."
""
"O-great balance and easy drinking, unique combination of flavors"
""
""
"Taste follows te nose. Slight white wine tartness and a little but of funk. Dry finish with a very light malt sweetness."

"The use of wild yeasts, Nelson Sauvin hops and Sauvignon Blanc barrel aging really turned this Belgian ale into a spectacularly complex and enjoyable beer. This was one of the most interesting offerings I have had in a long time, and one of the best beers ever from Mikkeller. I would recommend drinking this one as fresh as possible in order to enjoy all that hoppy goodness."

"O- Another Brett-tastic beer from Mikkel. Not as amazing as I was expecting but certainly enjoyable to the point of seeking out again."
""
""
"O: Well, it lives up to the name. If you like sauvignon blanc wine you will like this. I'm not a fan of dry white wines so this was a bit much for me. Not much to discern from the base beer as the barrel dominates here both from a wine and from a drying oak perspective."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really interesting, complex and tasty beer. It's one drawback is that at times the flavors seem to clash rather than compliment one another."
""
""
"Only unlike the grotesquely delicious and uncannily loyal dog-turkey, this is champ-ale’s good parts don’t offset one another like some kind of abomination of god. They instead accentuate one another, and the result is like one of the most intense and refreshing saisons you’ve ever drank."

"Overall- Really good beer. It may have been a mistake to get the highest rated beer in the style for my first try of said style, but I don't care. This is definitely worth a try. However, I do not think I would repurchase (maybe on a special occasion)- the 22 bucks is just too much. However, it is pretty much a world class beer."
""
""
"Overall very good and would buy it again"
"This one sounded very interesting so against my better judgment I dropped $24 on a bottle. Dumb. Appearance is dark orange with a filmy head and lacing up the sides of the wine glass (seemed appropriate). Aroma is brett, wine, grapes, alcohol, slight bit of rubber, medicine, vicks vapo rub, robitussin, Flavor is brett, wine, alcohol and sort of this abrasiveness that I can't place. This feels like a ghetto version of Russian River Temptation, nowhere near as good and just sort of harsh. This may be my last Mikkeller beer, they aren't very good and the prices are ridiculous."

"I love the wine influence, the Brettanomyces, and the tobacco notes that the ale generates. Surprisingly, the medicinal notes that ensue don't detract from the taste as much as I would have expected- the ale is quite masterful even in its flaws."

"O: I thought that the brett and white wine barrel aging make this beer interesting and a lot easier to drink compared to other beers in the style. It hides its alcohol very well."
"O: This beer is really enjoyable, the notes of brett take the biere de champagne to the next level... I really found this beer to have a great aroma and taste wonderful - I would gladly celebrate any number of special occasions with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-The vinous characteristics of this beer are really enjoyable. It is complex, nicely balanced, with well-integrated fruit, sweetness, and alcohol. Perhaps the mouthfeel and flavors are not entirely in line with other bieres de champagne, but I found this one really enjoyable. Relatively speaking, the smell is a little weak and it is a pricey brew, but I would happily pay to drink this again."

"this is one of those white whales for me, something ive been hunting for forever and finally acquired. much anticipation here. it pours an orangey hued light bronze color into my flute, with some aspects of the champagne style carbonation, rapidly rising bubbles and a hard to control white head, but its not quite as excited as I expected it to be, and it does settle rather quickly. the smell is really complex and different, funky yeast, chardonnay or some other fairly standard white wine, citrus bitterness from the hops, and a yeast strain that is unfamiliar to me. the taste is refreshingly hoppy. the nelson sauvin variety offers a lot of fruity characters, some tropical, some citrus, all delicious. its cool because while it does provide all that fruit, it retains a high degree of bitterness, a testament to the hops versatility and to mikkellers talent as a brewer. the yeast has some funk to it, and the bitterness in the finish is lemony. a lot more wine shows up from the barrel treatment that expected, and pushes the flavor more towards a 50/50 hybrid than anything else. maybe not quite as complex as the nose, but its definitely got a lot going on. wholly unique. the mouthfeel was a little lacking for me. a biere brut needs to have nuclear carbonation throughout, and this one doesn't. it starts pretty high, but it fizzles out before my glass is gone. the body is nice though, medium and smooth, punctuated by flashes of bubbles. overall this is a very interesting creation, maybe not quite as good as I wanted it to be, but its really a remarkable brew."

"Awesome job Mikkel, I could drink this all day long..."
""
"750ml bottle served in a tulip glass. Pours a hazy (with floaties), amber-orange color, big frothy off-white head, and good lacing. Aroma is pale malts, apricot, citrus and earthy hops, wood, vinuous, and barnyard. Flavor is caramel, lemon, orange, wood, spicy, brett, and vinuous. Mouthfeel is medium, dry, crisp, bitter, and a touch of an alcohol burn. Good beer, nice complexity, dangerously quaff-able."
""
""
""
""
"D - I was expecting more spritz and dryness, but as a funky Belgian Strong Pale this is pretty enjoyable. Probably not worth $23, but I'd love to try an extremely fresh bottle or draft sample to see how much the Nelson Sauvin hops contribute."
"Overall: Mikkeller knocks it out of the park. I love this brew. Makes me think of new years but at the same time has such wonderful beer aspects to it. Worth all of the $19.99 I spent on this bomber. Not something to drink all the time but something that is a must try. Nelson Sauvin hops continue to show their diversity and overall deliciousness."
""
"Bottle sampling at Bar Volo. A malt liquor with lots of fruitiness. Very Good drinkability for such high alcohol. Peachy coloured body with a little head and lace. A big bold taste, grape, apricot. full mouthfeel. Sour fruit aroma. A worthwhile big beer to try."
"This is easily the most hop forward brut champagne beer, and the funk on this just accents it nicely. This is something really special and tasty, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"This is really fantastic at the moment. The nose is unmatched. Thanks Joel!!"
"The rating made me expect more. And as this beer touts nelson sauvin hops, i was hoping for a strong nelson hop presence which i also didnt get. But perhaps the nelson sauvin hops added to the fruity flavor. Only speculating. A nice medium-sourness beer, but it's not complex enough to warrant its rating my opinion."
""
"O- I picked this up on a whim, now I'm looking for it again. This Biere shines as a flavorful, drinkable hybrid. Nice."
"D - Excellent balance. The hops and the barrel character blend very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This grew on me as I drank it. At first it's a Brett bomb, but it really comes together as an excellent beer."

"Overall, very nice. Certainly not the juggernaut that Charlevoix' s Brut is, but a nice beer and am happy to have had it."
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a bright cloudy amber color ale with a large dirty white foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of Brett notes with funky yeast and light dry vinous notes is very intriguing. Taste is also dominated by dry vinous notes with grassy notes and some funky ester with what seems like Brett notes – extremely complex and somewhat hard to do justice of the taste with my descriptions. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very complex while retaining good drinkability level. I would love to have this one again in the future."
""
"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a cloudy burnt orange color with about an inch and a half off-white head that stayed around for a while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and fruity, the brew smells like grapes, tropical fruit, green apples, sauvignon blanc wine, funk, lemon peel, pears, and some earthy aromas. It tastes like sauvignon blanc wine/grapes, funk, oak, lemon peel, yeast, hay, green apples and a bit of apricot. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high but also soft carbonation which helps makes this brew easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good beer. It's pricey at $19.99 a bottle, but I think it's definitely worth trying even at that price."
"O: Damn. This is truly amazing. Highly recommended, utterly worth the obscene price tag, and an exemplar for where the the style should be headed. Would have again. Top notch."

"Reddish brown with little clarity in the body. Voluminous white head, chunky retention and webbed lacing. Nose is evidently bretty, some lemon, malt sweetness and just a pinch of the Nelson Sauvin comes through. More bretty flavour, dry wine and oak notes, malt sweetness and the Nelson Sauvin is much more pronounced. Fruity and melony, a bit funky with a bit of lemon. Really fantastic. Sweet on the palate, moderate effervescence. My first brut, and although I'm not sure if this type of flavour is characteristic of the style, I'm sold. Great complexity."
"Flavor is definitely influenced by grapes as well as it gives a noticeable sweetness with a grape kind of sugar thing going on. There was a wild yeast used on this, right? Because I am getting something mildly wild on here. And I say mildly because it is so well mixed up with all of the other characteristics of the beer. I really wish Mikkeller would make more beers like this. If he had earlier on in his career, he'd be selling a lot more beers now."
""
""
"Well, not a bad beer from Mikkeller, as is the general trend, but this is no Brut, BA. A bang-up BSPA? Sure, why not? However, I'm quite glad that I didn't break out the stemware for this one - the standard pint glass or pick-your-Trappist branded chalice will do. This is just too brutal, in a good way, but not for the style, so drink it for that reason, and not the intended one. Me, I'll be sticking to the veritable French, grape-based stuff, when I get married next week. Glad I got this one out of the way first."
"overall, it seems to me that there were a lot fo places this beer could have gone wrong but didn't. it walks the fine line between a mess and excellence that a lot of the better examples of this type of beer do. must try for fans our sours."
""
"Pours a hazy deep orange-ish color with a tan head. In the aroma, tart grapes and a small yeast presence. In the the taste, tart yeast, tart fruit of white grape and peaches, and a note of small alcohol. A small tart bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a a small dry tart grape in the aftertaste. Like a very nice white wine, beautiful tartness!"
""
"I'd say this is more of a souped-up Belgian IPA than anything else, however it still slips through the cracks when it comes to pinning down any one type of style. The sour beer folks will get their rocks off over this one, yet what sold me was how the Nelson Sauvignon hops held their own up with the Brett, and how well the two complimented one another so well. Once is more than enough for a go around with this stuff though."
""
""
"something different and something good, a very unique beer from Mikkeller, interesting version of a barrel and if you like brett you will like this"
""
""
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a 2 inch puffy orange-white head that settles to an island of foam. Foamy chunks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of fruit (grapes, apples), white wine, and a sour/funky aroma from the Brett. Taste is funky and bitter right off the bat with some grape-like fruit flavors coming through on the finish. There is also a dry woody quality that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a very bubbly carbonation which I assume is a direct result of the Champagne yeast used in this one. Overall, this is a good beer and my first of the style but I wasn't expecting it to be so funky and bitter in taste based on the aromas."
"This beer poured a light bodied dark amber in color with a soapy cream colored head. It smells of 100% brett. It has plenty of Champagne yeast. It tastes dry and tart. Their is plenty of brett and wild yeasts. It's dry and funky. It's not overly complex either. It drinks light and fizzy, plenty of carbonation. It's ok. It's weird that this review is this short but there wasn't too much to say. It was solid but not worth the money."

"Medium bodied with a nice balance of wine barrel, funky brett and light fruit. A decent amount of musty funk from the Brett but it isn't as strong as I expected. The wine barrel flavor is very strong with some dry toasted oak and sweet vinous fruit. The dryness of the oak goes very nicely with the dry brett. There's a subtle bready yeast character that adds another dimension to the palate. Pretty sweet from the wine and faint heat toward the finish. ABV is well masked however, making this complex, well balanced beer easy to drink. One of the better Mikkeller beers I've had in a while."
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent and well-balanced."
"Overall I'm pretty stoked on this juice/poison-like beer. It's really intense and fully earns its place in the Mikkeller beerography. Would I buy it again? It's expensive."
""
"o: I bought this on a whim since there were only two left at the store and I'm thoroughly pleased. Tart yet delicate."
"jd"
""
""
"It's a great beer with complex fruity flavors and the barrel treatment complements it nicely. Pricey but worth a try"
""
"This is a wonderfully complex beer, definitely worth the try if you're feeling wild."
""
"O - An impressive offering from Mikkeller. Plenty of flavour in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"The hops in this beer are the winners, effervescent, mildly grassy vegetal hop presence with an underlying citrus sense, flavors are light and dance, finish is mildly dry. Decent beer overall. I'd have it again."
""
""
"The palate has a gentle acidity, big vinous flavors and juicy, fruity, leathery brett notes. Pineapple, white grapes, light earthines; a lot of depth here. Alcohol is well hidden. Brett lingers in the finish, which is quite earthy and leathery, slightly chalky. Really nice stuff, one of the better Mikkeller beers I've tried."
""
"Pours a clear light orange color with a good white head. Moderate amount of white lacing. Nose carries light white wine plus some funk. A bit earthy with mild funk. Light acidity comes through in the flavor. Light body with effervescent carbonation. Really quite good. Probably my favorite Mikkeller beer to date."
"The beer is a honey orange color and has a thick, fizzy white head. Lasting retention and the tulip glass is coated with lacing. The aroma brings floral and vegetable notes, reminiscent of Cantillon Mamouche. Green peppers, plants, very vegetal. Medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Hops emerge in the finish. Complex and intriguing, this is enjoyable in small quantities."
""
"Dr: Drinkable but largely unremarkable and disappointing considering the brewery and white wine usage. I expected so much more. You could quaff it, but it's certainly not sessionable. I wouldn't get it again, especially at the exuberant price it's sold at in the USA. Wouldn't pair well with food. Hides its ABV well."
"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Hazy amber-orange pour with huge, meringue-like three finger head with great lacing and retention. Huge citrus nose at first that quickly give way to a sour, almost musty, vinous aroma that lets you know there's plenty of Brett in this one. The Nelson Sauvignon hops eventually poke their head out, but are pretty much overpowered by the funk of the Brett. The taste follows suit with lots of apple cider tartness and mouth puckering sourness. Hints of pear, lemon zest, apple, melon and a touch of orange emerge early, but are quickly overpowered by the funk of the Brett which dominates. The NS hops are there in a subtle way, but not enough for me. As it warms, the sourness fades a bit and gives way to some subtle sweetness and lots of white wine and oak notes with a touch of pepper. The mouthfeel reminds me a lot of champagne with a nice crisp, dry finish. Nelson Sauvignon are my favorite hops, which led me to grab this. I'm slightly disappointed as the hops are definitely not the star with this beer. And I'm not a fan of Brett in my beer. With that said, this was surprisingly drinkable and I could see why it would be a great beer for those that enjoy Brett. Another great interpretation from Mikkeller, just not my cup of tea..."
"I'd put off drinking this for a while assuming it would be a chore to finish, but couldn't have been more wrong. It's bloody delicious, with complexity that is accommodating rather than testing."
""
"D and O: A pretty good beer. Fairly interesting, easy drinking for the 9% A.B.V. It reminds me of the Luciernaga by Jolly Pumpkin, but I'd prefer Lucie. Good beer, nothing outstanding."
""
"I was really interested to try this one, and bought it as soon as it showed up at my local store. I am glad I did, as this beer was a very nice one to try. Complex and interesting, my only complaint about this one is that it's expensive, but that is what you get from Mikkeler."

"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF 6. It pours a sunrise amber, with a mild haze (like the light mist on a hunters' morn...not that I would know...trust me...), and topped by more than plenty of cream-white foam (damn, I'm glad I didn't aggressively pour this thing!). The nose comprises tart orange, tart lemon, light Brett funk, a decent amount of onion, a bit of cabbage (or something of that ilk) in the very back, and a few hot spots of pine resin here or there. Then things hit the tongue: Hoofah! a blast of Brett right in the kisser (I've gotten compliments on my work in that area...yup...), giving off a lot of blanket, some mild cobweb; there's a bit of orange behind that, along with what seems like oak or cedar or some sort of soft-ish wood. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a pretty damn dry finish, a touch on the sticky side of life (AKA the move-theater-floor side). Overall, I applaud the effort here, but I'm just not a fan of the overt and (for the most part) unrivaled Brett aspect here. It's just too much."
""
"Wow, that's the first response. Appearance is a brownish gold with a thick foam. Smell, is sour with citrus. Mouthfeel is perfect for what you would want, viscous with a foamy finish. Taste is what gets ya. Sour, lemon peels and then the aging in the sav blanc barrels comes thru big time. Alsmost has a champagne ending. One of my top beers I have in 2011. Thanks to Matt at Brown Derby in Springfield, MO for pulling one out for me when I walked in the door!!!"
""
""
"An above average, interesting, sweet and fruity (mild) sour. This reminded me of one of Fantome's fruitier saisons."
"Overall a fine example of the style. I love the overall fruitiness and mild hop bitterness. Not to mention the well hidden 9% alcohol content. I'm happy to see this listed as a regular in the rotating line up and look forward to more in the future. Thumbs up!!"

"Overall a fun beer with a very nice flavor! The only downside is the 19.99 pricetag for a 750ml."

"Nice light body with good carbonation. This one is dangerously easy to drink. Really enjoyable."
"This is amazing, as advertised. I wish it was a little easier to track down as it would go well on a special occasion and is very drinkable."

"This is perfect."

"pours a virtually opaque glowing reddish-brown with a thick, cream colored head that holds very well and leaves tons of lace. the nose gives off wonderful aromas of big nelson sauvin (fruit, grass, citrus, melon, pineapple...) and sauvignon blanc (pear, lemon, grass pineapple, more citrus, wet rock) notes that harmonize extremely well and play with a caramelly malt backbone, some mildly vanilla-laced oak notes, and a brett presence (must, pineapple, funk) that is healthy, but not main stage. taste reveals what i am hoping for; a balanced sweet and dry blend of fruit, earth and grass. chewy medium-full body that seems light and fluffy. the brett is there, but just enough to amplify the other flavors, and it comes in on the back end like you want it to. a lot going on here, but it is all in chorus, so it is pumped up like a human microphone, and works very well. one of mikkelller's best efforts in my memory. delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this quite a bit. It's somewhere between a belgian pale and a sauvignon blanc, just as the label promises, and that's something unique and surprisingly good."
"Cheers"
"Soft brett and slight acidity in the taste. Orange/grapefruit right with white grape juice. Chardonnay barrels are in there. Some orange/kiwi/pear sweet and sourness. Bitter hop bite and brett on the finish that comes out of nowhere. Really strange mixture of flavors and sensations that work very well together. Mouthfeel is kind of odd and not as carbonated as I thought it might have been after the pour."
" Some carbonation on the palate at first, then it becomes soft and creamy, losing most it's carbonation rather quickly. A little sweet, candied malt going on. Lots of herbal, dried grass and fresh hay flavors with a developing mixture of grapefruit, berries and citrus rind. The beer has a nice white wine, tart character that carries throughout the brew as well, keeping it refreshing and thoughtful. I'm getting some lovely toasted oak and more pronounced wine flavors as the beer warms. It finishes dry and earthy in the mouth. I'd be interested to see how this one might develop over a year or two."
"Wow an amazing unique beer with only a slight flaw. It pours a slight hazy brown amber with a gorgeous thick rocky head leaving thick curtains of lacing in its wake. The nose is pure california sauv blanc with a dusting of new zealand gooseberries. Bright, juicy ruby red grapefruit, bitter orange zest, shadings of light oaky vanilla along with a lemon grass herbal edge and a hint of slate. The taste is pure grapefruit, gooseberries, a hint of barrel, almost a semillon richness to balance the sauv blanc qualities and honeysuckle - very vinous. My only issue is the beer finishes very dry with mouth drying tannins. Sadly i would love to age this beer but when the hops fade i think the oakiness will be even more pronounced. That said a truly amazing beer."
"Overall, this is really good, and worth the $12 I paid for it."
"taste is very unique. funky, earthiness, following the nose, along with all the aforementioned flavors on the nose also. a bit sweet on the finish that turns dry and bitter. There has to be brett in this. This is interesting, but not sure I can drink a lot of it."
"O-Not at all what I expected, but still, I'm very pleasantly surprised. This is a fantastic, innovative beer, and I have a feeling I'll be having a few more before they sell out."
"O: I was very impressed by this one. The wine flavors really came through and added a pleasant flavor to the beer."
"O - Pleasantly surprised by this one. Also surprised I'm the first reviewer. But, it's a rather well done wild ale that is good now and would be interesting to try with some age on it as well. Recommended."
"A wonderfully balanced beer with some interesting flavour profiles. Great fruit, funk and malt. Complex and refreshing."
"D-- Good because it is different. Gives flavors of a sour and qualities of one and then mixes in the BSPA in. In some ways it works and in other ways it does not. Like how the Brett is mixed in but at times it is a little aggressive. Starting to get his stuff in an odd way. Would buy again for the reason it is very different."
"drinkability is great. great balance. i love the winey barrel character. tasty!"
"An interesting drop, very unique - largely for its funkiness, but even more for its surprising subtlety. Could I drink this every day? Yes. Would I? Probably not. Might be good paired with food and just for a casual sip."
"A very interesting brew this one, and one I'm very pleased to have tried. Cheers to the guy at Platinum Cellars in Bellevue Hill for chucking this in to my last purchase. It's certainly a unique and exciting brew."
"Incredible balance, alcohol is perfectly integrated. Great ! Mikkeller, you are a master !"
"Full-bodied and creamy, utterly refreshing. Split 3 ways with some good pals and good food, but I could easily have polished it off myself. Great stuff, too bad it's a one off."
