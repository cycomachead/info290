4.25,0,,,,,,"So basically it boils down to the fact that this ""Champagne"" beer is filtered whereas most other Belgian ales are not. Big deal, right? Well, except that this - even more so than the regular Malheur Brut - really is a phenomenal beer, marketing garb or unique fermentation process aside. Something like this would be perfect for everyday consumption, if not for price and rarity. This limited edition dry-hopped version, however, is worth spending money on.","biegaman","Beers"
4.04,0,,,,,,"Bottle: Poured a cloudy yellow color ale with a gigantic foamy head with perfect retention and some excellent lacing. Aroma of sweet malt notes with light warming alcohol with some dry floral hops notes. Taste is also dominated by sweet alcohol notes with some warming alcohol notes and some dry alcohol notes with light herbal notes. Body is quite full with super great carbonation and light warming alcohol notes. I was expecting a bit more from the dry hopping but still quite the experience.","Phyl21ca","0"
