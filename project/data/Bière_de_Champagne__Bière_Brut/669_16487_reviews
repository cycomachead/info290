"O: I like it and I'm confused as to why maybe it's the pleasantly bubbly mouthfeel it's sweet and just pleasant really I bit absolutely no chocolate out of this but I'm not sure I had the same beer"
"From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Best Damn Beer Shop in San Diego. This should be my 100th beer style, according to BA."

"O - This beer is exquisite full stop, and is the only dark version of this style that I know of. The benchmark it sets and difficult to beat."

"The beer is chestnut brown colored with a fizzy, beige head that leaves sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet, yeasty, fruity. The flavor is pretty tasty, with prominent yeast and spice notes. Earthy with some alcoholic warmth in the finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, I enjoyed this. Good for splitting several ways at a tasting."

"Beer is light in body and a little earthy / spicy on the palate, the yeast comes through nicely as well. Ultimately I didn't like this one as much as the blonde, if I were to have one again it would be the other Bière de Champagne / Bière Brut, a nice tasting though."
"o - Overall a decent beer but the normal Brut Reserve was much better. This is a bit blander in the nose and a bit heavier for the same ABV. Probably wouldn't seek it out again and would choose the Brut Reserve over this one for sure."
"The flavor follows a similar pattern; there really isn't too much going on, but it's well made and the fruit character is nice. Light-medium body with moderate carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Pretty good."

"From 750 ml bottle into Malheur chalice-like tulip. Dark tudor brown in color. Approaching black. Off-white head. Medium retention. The head had some unique champagne like activity happening I assume related to the high carbonation causing a percolation. Aroma seems sweet. Malty. Actually is smells exactly like milk duds. Taste is sweet, also milk duddy. Not as champagne like as expected. High carbonation and tongue cleaning but lower than expected for brut. Not a brut guy but this is actually pretty freaking awesome. "
"Overall: Very good beer, only the high price ($36) is negative. Would definitely buy it again for a special occasion."
"Different take on a biere champagne and definitely worth a try."

"Apparently this bottle is two years past it prime January, First, Two Thousand and Nine. Forgot about this baby and should have chocolate on hand as this is supposed to best beer in the world to have chocolate with. Seems like a big boozy quad with out the depth of the great quadruples. Enjoyable will have to revisit this beer when I come across it again."

"Overall I think I prefer the Blonde version, but this is a neat mix and real impressive sense of flavors, smells and textures for a beer. Real nice."
"A beer you should buy and try. I am going to have this beer standard in my stock."
"The heat of the booze almost masked a light dusting of minerals within the mouth and the fleeting stickiness on the lips. The carbonation was active but not excessive. The body was pretty light and I had to admit that it did seem like a mix of champagne and beer. It was different and could take some getting used to, but I was liking this first venture into one of the newest Belgian styles."
"Dr: Pairs well with chocolate. Very drinkable. Conceals its ABV quite well. I don't know the price point as it was a gift from a friend, but I suspect it's quite expensive."
"* It is also important to note that the froth in the bottle had actually overflowed, spilled out a little in the fridge, and left a semi-hard, honeycomb like nice-sized chunk of lace around the rim while I was drinking my first glass."
"Bottle opens with a huge, resounding POP! I love the ""mushroom"" corks they use on these. Westy 12 like in appearance, thin, creamy, cobwebby head, and a darkbrown with reddish edges. I'm immediately comparing this to some great Belgian quadruppels, specifically Rochefort 10, Westy 12, maybe St. Bernardus 12. It has the kind of blueberry-like element of the Rochefort, the beautiful malt and dark fruits of all three. The feel is a touch thin. Not boozy, very lively, spritzy, deep, and elegant. Extremely underrated given the huge appeal this should have for anyone who likes the big belgian quads."
"Clear dark burgundy topped by a small quarter inch head that retains solidly. Dark fruits are dominant on the nose. Raisins, currants, anise, dark candi sugar. A bit herbal too, bringing to mind sage. Champagne like on the palate, highly carbonated with dark fruit and caramelized malt flavors. Figs, raisins, black licorice, a light herbal bite in the finish. Finishes dry, tannic, lightly roasted. Light bodied, fairly drinkable for what it is. Pretty nice stuff."
"Note: Reserve 2003"
"This beer should be an opidome of the style- it's effortless nature at such complexity is astounding. The balance is formitably malty-sweet yet complex. Simply a joy to drink."
"D - This is one of those beers to have to celebrate a bachelor party with on a yacht but protect your flat screen from lamps after your wife finds out how much you paid for the bottle but seriously its a good beer thats worth picking up for new years or something"
"An amazing unique experience, try it."
"Bottle says bbe 30 June 08. In any event, good beer. Bottle gave a good pop to the cork. Poured with a nice tan head which quickly subsided and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a hazy amber brown. Aroma is malty, yeasty, vineous. Flavor is typical dark Belgian and like aroma. Body seems a bit thin but high carbonation makes up for it. Boozy finish and fairly short."
"This brew is interesting and fun. Everyone at the party wanted to try it after seeing a strange brown liquid spew out of an unassuming ""champagne bottle"". Some of them loved it, some of them... didn't. For me - generally enjoyable, easy to drink, a bit pricey."
"This is yet another very fine beer from this impressive brewery."
"This is a wonderful rich, fruity sipper."
"Nicely carbonated with a sweet effervescent body/flavor. Estery belgian yeast provides a lot of dark fruit flavor, namely dark cherry, plum, grape and raisin. Slight roasty chcolate malt and minimal hop bitterness. ABV is very well masked. Dry finish."
"The one thing that really threw me for a loop was the ton of sediment at the bottom. I thought this was a champagne beer?"
"Pours a dak cola brown to light black hue beneath a light brown that swells to three fingers even after a soft pour into my champagne glass. Very unique, champagne-like look to this dark brew. The aroma is sweet breads, light chocolate, roasted, yeasty fruit, and a little smoke. Very complex, and pleasant aroma. The taste has some light brown and chocolate mixed with strong pumpernickle bread. Just some greay carbonation from start to finish. Great sipping beer with a sparse warmth that is a little off putting. But decptivly delicious and elegant. The great bubbles tickling the palate add to the dark Belgian Dubbel and chanpagne quality to this sipping beer."
"A very tasty tipple, that morphed quite visibly from a sparking wine-esque drink to a decent strong Belgian ale as it warmed. This went very well with some of my girl's delectable raspberry/rhubarb pie. Summer at its finest, folks."
"This 750 ml bottle of Malheur Dark Brut cost $25.99. At that price, needless to say, I'll never buy it again. Still, it wasn't a waste of money because I'm getting a great deal of enjoyment out of the experience. If you love the BSDA style (and recently won the lottery), give this one a serious look."
"This was a good beer, but it wasn't great and at this price, I think it is fair to expect greatness. Would be fun to have the funds to cellar a few for several years, but alas, I do work in the beer industry."
"Very sweet flavor with a touch of hop at the swallow. Described as the ""Perfect Match to Belgian Chocolate", which may be true. But this is a brew that should be sipped. It is very rich, but with a good level of carbonation. Strong Sherry-like flavors. This doesn't taste like a typical Belgian; there isn't the Belgian yeast flavoring I'd expect. Despite the alcohol level, this is a deceptive beer. Certainly it would be hard to drink this regularly."
"Drinkability - a tasty and quite adventurous brew, just have some towels handy. Cheers to ya', WV."
"In summary, it was a solid beer, but I was expecting more, given how hard it was to get my hands on."
"Highly drinkable for the ABV, this is one amazing beer. Would gladly buy a full case if it was not for the price. Superb."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a nice thick foamy head with great retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of sweet barley malt is very enticing. Taste is a nice balance between some sweet barley malt with notes of caramel. Full body with great carbonation and no alcohol was apparent. Very well done but unfortunately this is lacking character and I couldn't justify paying that kind of rpice for that experience more then once."
"It was paired with a chocolate fondant cake, made with the beer, with creme anglaise at the Monk's Kettle New Year's Eve dinner. The pairing was quite nice and my rating is more from my initial assessment of the beer by itself. This is a good one to drink with rich chocolate cake."
"An ""interesting"" beer. Personally, I like the other ""brut"" from this brewery more, though not by much. This one is dark-ish with grassy notes. Sourish. I don't know that it's worth the near thirty bucks spent, except for its uniqueness. Alcohol does show. But, it has a nice taste to it. The ""mixed feelings"" I have about it have to remain at that, because I think it is interesting, but to have once per price tag. If subsituting as a beer-lover's ""champagne", personally, I would go with the other ""brut"" from this brewery. There is more cocoa, that might appeal to some in this, but it is at the expense of the citric qualities that is replaced by a grassiness that just doesn't meld together as well with this one. Also, the little difference in abv shows the more with this one. Very good, but...more liked for uniqueness than actual pleasure. It does have a unique way of blending an earthiness to a chocolate-ish brew. Bottom line - nice, very nice, to ""try"" but wouldn't spend the cash in repeating."
"Post-palate there's some heft to this, even though the mouthfeel is rather light. This is definitely something good for a glass or two on occassion but a full bottle should be shared!"
"Pours a deep amber/ brown, with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty malt, licorice, and alcohol. In the taste, roasty malt, licorice, and alcohol burn and a small hop. An alcohol and small hop bite, with a light to medium mouthfeel. A dry alcohol and roasty malt aftertaste. Nice alcohol presence, quite interesting, kind of like Sambucca flavor. Quite complex and interesting."
"the brew pours up a dark brown color with a huge bubbly tan head. the nose has dark malts and crisp hops. the taste is super rich with flavor! sweet malts, sugar, dark fruits! full bodied and super smoothe. very refined beer. i would definately bathe some hot hookers in this beer!"
"This is gorgeous stuff, but needs to shared, a bottle alone to oneself is quite overwhelming, the abv% really sneaks up on you, and this is sweet chocolatey semi-vinous stuff, that gets a bit overwhelming as well after a while. A perfect way to cap off a dinner party I think."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sugary, fizzy, mineraly, with bitterness towards the end."
"first burn sp*** ... pours with a island destroying tsunami tidal wave effervescent head, stained my carpet with the huge run-off ... lots of head and nice lacing ... what a beer for such a shitty night, this beer turned the tide ... no abv even thought about ... delicious stuff!! ...fuck it, i quit!"
"Best before 30/06/2008, sampled on that date. Clear brown with a plum hue and coppery edges. A fluffy, yellowish brown head appeared after the pour and settled into a thin cap that left sticky foam coating the glass. Fruity aroma, lots of plum and earthy raisin, with bready and toasty malt notes. Mild dry cocoa and alcohol appeared as it warmed. Very sweet, fruity up front leading to bready malt towards the end. Alcohol was present throughout and lingering somewhat, but it stayed restrained and balanced. Mild chocolate and milky character throughout. Carbonation was very high, a little too high for me. Medium bodied with a decent texture and alcohol warmth. A pretty good drinker with a light chocolate flavour, suited for after dinner to complement dessert or on its own."
"Large, heavy bottle, caged and corked, best before date on the rear label. (30/06/08) Pours very dark chocolate, dark tan creamy head, that leaves medium, splattered lacing. Chocolate, licorice, toasted marshmallow on the nose. Active carbonation, produces some prickles on the tongue and palate. Bitter, dark chocolate carries the load here. Big and bold Belgian with plenty of interest and complexity. Dark grains, more chocolate, licorice, anise and drying hops in the mid section and rear. Nice stuff, dark Belgian lovers, go get some."
"D: Definitely drinkable--light and refreshing with a decently complex taste. A good beer, an interesting style, and I'm glad I tried it. It is a fairly spendy beer...there are much better beers at a quarter to half the price you'll pay for this one. That said, I recommend trying it at least once."
"Masterfully executed beer."
"D: This beer grew on me as I moved down the glass. It needs to breath before it can be fully enjoyed. It deserves to be savored and is an unlikely candidate for a long session. However, I want more and more and more."
"Picked up for a ridiculously cheap sale price of $10 at Green's, this 750 ml. Champagne style bottle was impressive even before opening. The loud pop while pulling out the cork was quite a bit like opening a Champagne, but the Burgundy colored liquid with a large foamy head looked nothing like it. It was an impressive looking beer nonetheless. I'd almost call is a cross between St. Bernardus Abt. 12 and Duvel. The smell was quite a fruit barrage, led mainly by red apples, and followed by cherry and strawberry. The taste was quite a bit like a Quadrupel but without a lot of the intense alcohol. The fruits detected by the nose were here with some raisins thrown in. Earthy and spicy hop presence was detectable. Amazingly easy to drink for such a big beer with a creamy and dry texture that just glided down with each sip. Felt quite a bit lighter in the mouth than it really was, which i think was quite an intentional effect. Much better than the Brut Reserve in my opinion, as this one tries not to imitate something else, and is a better drink as a result."
"I just loved this beer and am jealous of anyone who can take advantage of the ridiculously low price at Whole Foods, Austin."
"Pours a dark brown with an abundant frothy head that sprung up with even with an extremely careful pour. Aroma is dried fruits and burnt caramel and molasses. The taste is a very complex blend of dried fruits, caramel and some bakers cocoa. The beer is certainly heavy, but the Champagne carbonation does a nice job of smoothing things out. This one, while smooth and refreshing, is certainly a sipper that benefits from warming."
"Drinkability - Very easy to lose yourself with larger than needed gulps, the lighter flavor, and thinner mouthfeel make this strong dark Belgian a danger to anyone who dosn't know of the ABV."
"Too drinkable for the strength. An easy beer to lose track of, the bottle was gone far too fast."
"This really needs to be a bit more tame on the alcohol front to be really good, sure you could chill the hell out of the beer and that would reduce the alcohol, but you would lose so much of the fruit, malt and spice character then."
"At over $25 a bottle, it wont be frequenting my cellar or my shelf, which is too bad. This is an excellent Biere Brut. Incredibly complex nose, with sherry, vanilla, and fine wood all showing up. Oak dry taste with some coffee notes. Balanced bitterness with alcohol zest and oak."
"Drinkability: An interesting mix of flavors, but, in all honesty, I preferred the Brut Reserve."
"For the price and packaging a rather bland and uninspiring beer."
"The mouth feel is very Champaign like reminds me of a big brut rose'. In hind sight it sort of reminds me of a creamy kir royal. Great beer truly unique, intoxicating and delicious."
"D - A smooth and highly drinkable dark belgian. A nice candy sweetness is lightened by the effervescence and prevents the beer from tasting like a big ale. I appreciated the Bier Brut and will definitely try a Dark Brut again."
"Opinion: This is an interesting beer, and it really doesn't reflect its color in the taste. It doesn't have hardly any of the caramel sweetness that you would expect from such a dark beer. The assertive hopping make this beer a bit hard to classify as well. It is a nice experience, and I would recommend trying this one with like a beer club or something when a bunch of you can share the financial hit. I paid over $25 for this bottle, and am drinking it by myself. With 12% ABV, I will surely get my money's worth by the end of the bottle, but I knocked it on the drinkability strictly for the cost."
"Poured into a champagne flute. Dark reddish-brown with a medium desnsity, very active tan head. The smell is chocolate and tannins, backed by a pronounced yeast note. The taste is very intense, sweet plums and dark chocolate. The finish has notes of orange and nutmeg. Outstanding. The mouthfeel is nicely effervescent but a bit thin. The drinkability is great. There is an alcolhol warmth to the finish but this beer really masks the alcohol well. If you like Belgian brown ales and if you like good champagne, definitly try this. If you can afford it. Ouch."
"Not that bad, unless you consider the $26 price tag. Definitely not worth that. Inferior to the ordinary Brut."
"Mahogany copper color. Frothy head settled quickly. Dusty, musty aroma of burnt sugar/ raisins. Sweet dark stewed fruit flavor, hairy carbonation. light/medium body with sweet burnt sugar finish and warming alcohol presence. Better than the lighter version, but still - this emperor is also wearing no clothes."
"wonderful packaging and presentation, but I miss the point of this beer. the taste greatly underperforms the nose. I was also unimpressed with ttheir normal 'brut' beer, so maybe it is a style issue."
"Vintage Reserve 2003 on label. Poured cold from the fridge into a goblet, probably too cold as the taste livened a bit when it warmed up. A very light and airy tan head rose high in the class as the brown and tan highlights swirled. Light smell, pleasant. High carbonation evident on tongue with malty taste that strengthens with the temperature. Overall, a pleasant beer, fun to drink, and well crafted. But, like Deus, not a beer I'd travel a long ways for or get more than one bottle at the store. Fun for me since it's my first bottle from the Rare Beer Club since Minnesota has been added to the list of acceptable states."
"75 cl. bottle. Dark color with a creamy some brownish head that lingers for a good while. Aroma of chocolate, dried plums and spices. Body lighter than I expected. Taste of chocolate, champagne mouthfeel, Jerez wine, some honey. After a while it leaves a brandy feeling. Not the best of the Malheur, imo."
"Dark burgundy color. Small, compacted, light mocha colored head. Lightly aromatic, strange, funky aroma with dark, roasty tones. Hazelnut flavors abound with light chestnut flavors along with roasty and toasted tones and a touch of raisins. Well hidden alcohol and nice mouthfeel."
"Overall: One of the first brews I had at the Festival from a bottle freshly opened in front of me. Strange one this though, maybe Im the party pooper here but I didnt really care for this one at all or understand all the fanfare that surrounds it. Its a quality brew but a tad bland for a 12% brew and the chocolate aspect felt muddy. Over-rated? There I said it."
"I forgot to write down the vintage, but the bottle looked quite old as the ripped label was showing lots of signs of aging. Aroma is heavy with chocolate malts and Belgian yeasty notes. Hints of dark fruit as well. Crimson hued brown/black color with a frothy tan head. Very concentrated chocolate malt flavors in the fore followed by a hint of raisin and cherry sweetness and leading into a slightly dry and funky finish. The chocolate and dark fruit flavors linger nicely in the aftertaste."
"Not as dry (brut) as one could expect and I didnt find it worth the price (round $15 for 75 cl)"
"(25.45 oz green champagne style bottle, corked, caged, and wrapped with a gold foil top)"
"BB 15-12-2006. Good presance withyellowish head and a darkbrown/black beer. Nose is very fruity giving mostly stawberry, cherry and vanill. Next to that good maltyness and roast. Taste is sweet, hoppy, roasty, lots of alcohol, chocolate and malts altogether litle bombastic. Very carbonated makes it litle fresher but sweetness is also very present in mouthfeel. Good beer but IMO not the best of the malheurrange, this mostly cause of the IMO overdone sweetness of the brew. The bubles& alcohol rise to your head though!"
"Raisin, cocoa, dusty in the aftertaste, and again final astringency."
"Yeasty belgium, with black chocalate apearance. Some roast, sugary, bittersweet. Wood, black cherry notes,odd nuts and cocoa. Complex flavour but medium mouthfeel. For end of meal/dessert. Hugh carbonation and noticeable high alcohol. Different, worth having once."
"A beer perfect for a special occasion or celebration."
"26oz: Dark chocolate brown, superb beige head is eternally lasting, foamy, full of subtle lacing. Enormous chocolate malt aroma, predictably tart, yet somehow, they managed to find a fit between this and saison-like haystack scents. I found the balance to be remarkable for such an experiment, delicate herbal and flowery undertones together add tremendous depth. Rich bitter/tart chocolate, actually this may be tarter than it appears, yet I didnt find any annoyance in the marriage with the roastiness. No trace of alcohol in the aroma, remarkable feature by itself, but in such a complex blend, you dont get to spend much time thinking about that. Add to this a killer expanding in bubbles incredibly smooth foamy mouthfeel and you know where your 25$ went. I still think I prefer the regular Brut, but then again, I tend to prefer blonde Belgians to darker ones. I can recognize a killer recipe though and this one gave me a hard time to find places to give less than perfect scores! Astonishingly unique. A sipper that you couldnt drink too much of while being an incarnation of greatness! de Landtsheer can brew people, my rating may be a mess, but take that for granted. Cheers to my pal muzzlehatch for this."
"Cola brown brew with an active, billowing tan froth. Cherry liqueor and a certain plant-like freshness are backnotes to coccoa powder and a musty yeast quality. Some chocolate, some oak in the flavor. Lively and mildly bitter, this is a very natural-feeling beer with floral, plant, and natural sweeteners presenting themselves. This has a dry finish, and the alcohol is well-hidden. This looks like it should be an overly sweet alcohol bomb whose depth is entirely based on esters. Not the case. This a dry, complex ale that's remarkably drinkable."
"Interesting beer.. not as crisp as the regular Malheur Brut, but with a little more character."
"The dark reddish brown body is topped by an appropriate light tan head. The aroma has a good bit of fruitiness and a little spice, but the chocolate, while there, really isnt there enough to justify the American name for this beer. This one seemed a little lacking compared to beers that came before and after it at the tasting."
