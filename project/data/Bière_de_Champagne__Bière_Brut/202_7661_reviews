"very cool beer to try but $$$, I didn't buy this beer but would NEVER pay the >$36 it cost at the LBS"
"Pours very straw to pale gold with a champagne like liveliness with a thick soapy 2” foam cap that quickly dissipates. Clean fruit and floral aromas and taste with a slight hint of sweetness and some definite white wine qualities. The perception oscillates between a sparkling wine and a beer and you swing between the yeast driven fruit flavors and the light malts.  Very effervescent, medium light body. Very refreshing."

"Overall: Very nice. Keeping in line with my previous encounters with Brouwerij Bosteels' offerings, this was top notch. My first experience with this style, and so far so good."
""
""
""
"Like a hybrid dry cider and saison. Really refreshing."
""
""

"Pours a fizzy pale yellow with a white head.  The aroma is herbal and has a good amount of Belgian.  The taste is herbal and lightly tangy.  Faint hops and champagne like flavor.  Finishes clean and semi dry.  Overall, this is a nice little beer ."

"Thank you BeerAdvocate. I've learned so much in the 6 years of being on this site. I'm happy I made it to review #400. Cheers!"
"Big, billowing head on the pour. Sudsy lacing with a solid stickiness.  Light, sweet floral and tropical aroma.  Palate full of sweet fruit, pears and pineapple come to mind. Very mild leafy hop. Just a hint of yeast funk. Very well balanced. Medium body. Slick feel with a crisp finish.  First of this style I've tried and I'm glad to say it's a winner."

"good but honestly, once is enough"
"Whem it comes direct from Boostel in refrigerated containers, the aroma and flavors still fresh, and it is really great and amazing, the bubbles exploding in your nose, i really love it."

"The taste starts spicy with matching coriander and lemony citrus taste that was hinted at in the nose with slight sweet malt and yeast flavor coming through mid palate. Th taste of the yeast adds another dimension to the spice with a carbonic acid and light alcohol flavor emerging toward the finish which has a tangy sweet quality even though the carbonation gives a dry impression. Overall I was impressed and did not expect to like this nearly as much -it certainly is everything it promotes itself as -pretty interesting champagne bier with a nice amount of flavor with mild alcohol which makes it pretty easy to enjoy for 11%"

"Similar to the aroma I pick up more spicy characters in the taste. The ginger really forces itself forward beyond the biscuit malts and other spices. Lingering light fruit character at the end. If someone was to ask me 6 months from now what I thought of this beer my answer would be one word ""Ginger."" Good or bad. That's what I take away from it."

"Interesting. It's like beer champagne. This is my first beer of the style, so I don't have anything to grade it against. While I appreciate this beer, it's not something I would seek out. It would be fun to show up to a tasting with this."

"Poured beer poured clear golden yellow, with a large foamy head, that dissapated rapidly, had a decent amount of carbonation and lacings. It had grassy flavor, with strong streets of yeast, malts, and grains, punctuated by traces of sugar sweetness, fruit, and hops. It has medium edge becuase of the alcohol content, which is 11.5 ABV, goes down okay, and leaves strong aftertast. Pretty filling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Carbonation makes for a fluffy effervescence, kept in check by a strong crispness and a body that just reaches medium and feels appropriate there. It is still on the very light side of medium, of course, and has lots of smoothness. It's clean, which seems very important and difficult to achieve for this particular beer."
""

"An excellent beer and unlike any I've tried previously, proving to be a fairly easy one to drink despite the fact that it comes in at over 11% abv. Smooth and lively with a great body, whilst dry the beer went down well with a solid, crisp finish. A beer worth picking up again despite the high price."
" DeuS captures that classic persona perfectly. And while $20-$30/bottle may be expensive by beer standards, that amount gets you nowhere in the world of Champagne; a sparkling wine of comparable quality to this would run you at least four times that amount. This is an exceptional example of a rare style. And while it does make for an impressive bottle to show off in the cellar, don’t age it. It’s perfect fresh. Enjoy now with someone special."

"Overall, good, but not incredible. It doesn't have quite the complexity I'd expect from the high ABV, though possibly I had it a little too cold. I would expect something calling itself ""brut"" to handle being served a little on the cold side, though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Lots of flavours going on and a ton of complexity. Not something I'd drink a whole lot of or very often, but a very fitting beer for new years eve. Something every beer drinker should try to see how diverse brewing can be."
""
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed this beer, and Its right up there with the best in the style."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is unlike anything I've ever tried. Incredibly smooth, dangerously hidden ABV, and wildly flavourful. A welcome change from the norm and surprisingly delicious. Definitely worth a try, and I'll grab another couple bottles for the beer fridge."

"No smoke in my house, and I quit smoking a long time ago. Beer served in a tall pils glass, at refrigerator temperatures. This is how I enjoy all beers at home except lambic (and hand-pulled English ale, if the opportunity ever presents). This was the first beer of my night, and I did not drink it with food or anything else."
""
""
""
"Very transparent -- looks like a light cider. Cloves, candi sugar, a little bit of lemon, maybe orange peel? Absolutely delicious. White grapes, maybe chardonnay grapes -- this is like a bubbly chardonnay crossed with a saison. Really, really good!!!"
""
""
"This stuff has been getting really popular (I have seen it on tv) and has been selling out fast. Like I mentioned previously, I see it more and more at different places at going for what I perceive to be retarded prices. I feel like most people buy it not because of the taste but because of the perceived luxury, same as with Champagne for many. I have been asked by many people how it tastes like, I always say, cheap Champagne, if you want Champagne, buy that, if you want beer, get something else. If you want a good Champagne beer get Malheur Dark Brut which is actually really good and delicious."
"Overall – I am impressed. Recently had another champagne-style beer that didn't score well. This one is like a Caddy compared to a Fiat. I hesitated to buy this marked at $33, on sale for $27. I might have to buy another and save it for a special occasion. Reading other reports a flute is better for carbonation."
"O - Holy crap! I haven't had a beer blow my mind like this in quite a while. Like nothing else out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the most interesting beers I have had in a while. A perfect blend of saison and champagne."
"This is a pricy but unique beer that is made for celebrations.  I've popped the cork on one(or more) of these for multiple New Year's Eve celebrations.  Not something I'd drink everyday even though it is a superb beer."

"O: Very good beer. Flavors are all mellow and well integrated. No sharpness of flavor at all, it's super smooth and goes down easy, despite 11.5% ABV. Yet at the same time, it's zesty and crisp. Lots of nice fruitiness from start to finish. Quite sweet overall too, definitely not ""Brut"" as in the champagne/sparkling wine world."
""
""
""

"this is by all means an exceptional beer. sort of a cross between a tripel and a saison in terms of flavor, and really interesting with the champagne carbonation. the 2010 bottle exploded upon opening, running active white foam all down the sides. the pour is a little hard to control, looks a lot like bubbly with a rising big airy white head. the nose is sweet malt like a triple, Belgian yeasty but a little funky and farmy like a good saison. some spice notes and honey make it very thanksgivingish to me. sweetness up front and yeast in the finish, definitely honey and maybe cinnamon, very desserty, and a coffeecake sort of malt profile. some dried fruit in there too, maybe apricots. the feel is tremendous, explosive carbonation and a fairly light body for what it is. its easy to forget the alcohol is 11.5% abv, its easy drinking and gets you drunk quick, like, I had to have my girlfriend drive home because of this baby, so be careful when slamming it down and remember its stronger than it seems. a very interesting article, one id like to drink again around the holidays, ive never had anything quite like this."

"Kind of was expecting more from this. Opened a rocket gusher at a good temperature. Off-white head was so big as to be almost unmanagable, but then settled to zero and no lace. Color is a clear yellow with plenty of bubble trails. Body and carbonation are good. Aroma is mainly yeasty, with some spice and malt. Flavor is where I docked them again as the name says ""Brut", and it's definitely on the sweet side while being similar to nose but more complex. Finish is like flavor, very boozy, and leaves a slight carbonic tang tingle in the throat."

"750ml bottle. Champagne Flute glass. Enjoyed on jan´13. Pours golden in color & shows crystal clear appearance. White, small bubbled, crown is copious, lively & lasting. Citric & yeast aromas, subtle sugar & acidic hues as well as fruity notes - mango & apricot- to the nose. Crispy upfront rounded by candies, brown sugar, grape & tropical fruit hints. Bitter/acidic flavor follows. Medium body. Oily & dense texture softened by medium to high carbonatation. Dried nuts & subtle amaretto in the middle resolve in harsh mouthfeel. Citric zest & associated astringency in the backside. Sharp bitterness lingers into a dry finish. Well balanced & smart beer."

"Hazy pale blonde colour, 1.5 fingers of white head, some lace. Smell is yeasty and spicy, corriander with a bit of alcohol, quite floral and more aparent working through the glass/bottle, fruity, apple and lemon, light funk as well. Taste is quite floral up front, spice, corriander and fruit, orange and apple, yeasty and dry with a fairly sweet and fruity finish. High dry carbonation, fairly medium bodied. Very nice stuff here, very drinkable but a bit less complex than I was anticipating, still quite nice and certainly something I look forward to revisiting down the road."

"Overall, an outstanding and complex beer. It's pretty amazing how much this feels like a champagne. I'd say this is the perfect brew to have for a celebration or special event."
"D - Nicely balanced. Good complexity and nice clean finish."
"Very nice beer, I haven't tasted something similar before. Glad I chose it for new year's celebration."
""
"Interesting experience, though not sure it is a beer to taste it again. I may say some sacrilege but it felt to me as an apple cider, and gets too sweet once it warms up. Felt to me as a beer to match with desserts, but not great as a stand-alone. Well, I had the full bottle…"
""
""
""
"The beer is pale golden hued with a small white head. The aroma offers apples, yeast, peppercorns, light spice, herbal and floral notes. The flavor is lightly sweet, with a cheesy like funkiness that gracefully counteracts the sweet character. Yeast and peppercorns mesh well with floral hops and a touch of warming alcohol. Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation. An outstanding beer to sip and savor."
""
"Enjoyed this a lot more the first time I had it 5 or so years ago. Don't know if this has deteriorated, but to me the concept doesn't really work because the elements don't integrate well. That said, there's nothing actually offensive about it."
"Pours a clear light orange-yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spices, herbs, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a mild spice and herb bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors that are different from what I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My first beer from this style category. Interesting beer its got a champagne quality to it, but its still beer! I would revisit this beer in the future. Would work in place of champagne at a formal event for the dedicated beer nerd!"
"I liked Deus! The mouthfeel is exceptional. Thanks to my favorite person in the world, fdkayti, for the birthday present."

"What do you say when beer meets champagne? the effort put into this gem was not wasted on me, I loved this stuff. I needed an excuse to buy a 30$ bottle and I think my B-day was well deserving, this ones worth the price tag."
""
"O: Potent and rich flavors. The bubbles do mellow out after a long while, but this is a very active beer. I liked it, but I’m not sure I’ll be buying it due to the price."

"Overall, quite nice and very different. My first Biere de Champagne and I would say I am a fan."
""
"Nice one eventhough it is quite expensive."

"O: Great beer. Very tasty. Strong Belgian character. At the same time, very unique"
""
"I am a fan of sparkling wines and I would recommend this as a replacement in any occasion.... not that sparklers require an occasion."

""

"Pours a clean yellow color with a big white head and quite bubbly. In the aroma, citrus notes and quite champagne like. In the taste, citrus to a dryer taste, quite carbonated, and a small note of alcohol at the end. A small alcohol bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry fruit rind and small alcohol in the aftertaste. Nice fruitiness, and alcohol presence."
""
""
"O: A great beer for a kid from Boston, now living in the NYC metro area to enjoy for the superbowl with friends. The taste of the alcohol was well hidden and the carbonation cut through the sweetness."
"shared this bottle last night with some friends, date on label says 06. poured a sparkling bright golden color with four fingers of bone white head. excellent retention and some spotty lacing were noticed. has a strong alochol aroma overpowering notes of funky yeast and peppery spices, very fruity smelling as well with peach being the most noticable. tastes bigger than it smells. flavors are bolder and they all shine thru. still very sweet tasting like a champaign, yet with all the flavors it reminds me too much of a really good saison. mouthfeel is light and bubbly. lots of carbonation with a warm dry finish. overall a very tasty beer, but for $28 a bottle i'll pass next time. i think there are just as tasty beers out there for half the price."
""
"Overall: I have found another favorite Belgian beer! This is incredibly light and flavorful for such a high ABV beer, plus it's unlike anything else I've had. It's a bit on the expensive side at around 30 dollars a bottle...but that's not unlike a good wine, and I like this much better than most 30 dollar wines I've had. Outstanding!"
""
""
""
"On the whole a pleasant beer to celebrate something with, but at 34 a bottle...I would rather have a nice Asti and save the money!!!!"
""
""
""
"Light to medium bodied and carbonation is, of course, high. Extremely drinkable and is the perfect replacement for any occasion demanding ""sparkling wine"" -- this mercifully knocks many a bubbly grape to its knees."
""
"Poured a clear straw yellow with a tall white head. Reminds me of Southampton's Cuvee des Fleurs for the big floral spice aroma. There's a subtle, creamy bready taste under the sweet, gentle malts, hints of citrus, and earthy pear skin. The light effervescent body is crisp and quite pleasant to drink. It is, however, by no means a lightly flavored beer. Yes, it's on the spendy side, but it's worth it for a special occasion."
""
""
"An excellent beer that shows off the concept of a ""Champagne Beer"" really well. Delicious."
"M: very intense sensation on the mouth starting with a little astringent sensation with some dryness that transforms into bitterness ending some sweetness at the beginning also sourness that make the style very complex to drink."
"T: a little bit crisping on tongue. Perfectly well balanced a little sweetness at first then some tart and bitterness at the end. The warming. All the aromas are present on the flavour"
""
""
""
"M + D: Very sparkling, as I expected. Body is light, high on the carbonation, with a deceiving alcohol presence... it's remarkably well hidden. A lovely toasting beer, and certainly an appropriate choice for celebrating!"
""
"Goes very well with raw oysters or mussels steamed in beer."
""
"O: this style of brew I haven't had too many times but to me it was drinking preety good and was very different from the beers I'm used to drinking. I have to say that this style of beer is not really my cup of tea."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is an interesting beer. I tend to like Champagne, so I like those characteristics that this beer has of the wine. The flavor is wholly beer, however. Decent, but for me, I don't think this beer is going to extend beyond novelty."

"Never noticed the alcohol and I finished most of the bottle myself. The complexity of this beer jumped out at me, nothing subtle about many of the aromas and, to a lesser degree, the flavors. A great beer that I'm glad i had the chance to try, but the price will keep me from enjoying it again in the near future."
"Overall, I'm glad I got to try this high-end Belgian brew. Although it's not the most flavourful concoction, I can see why it's considered a model example of the style, as it mimics the bubbly stuff quite well. A neat little experiment that's worth sampling if you can find it."
"Overall this feels like a decent bottle of bubbly spiked with a slightly less aggressive bottle of Pranqster. This is one fun beer, and something different from the everyday, a blast and a winner."
"aroma is far too light, small citrus hops,light grain, and that was about it. it seems to really just not have the direction i was looking for. it was just light on the palate and super carbonation, but the flavor just did not seem to match up with my hopes. a very expensive beer"
"This beer pours a very well carbonated and sparkling straw gold in color. It's very clear and features a nice, self destructive white head. It has nice, sharp tart aromas while still offering a moderate amount of honey, perhaps pilsner malt, and a champagne esque yeast. It has a really great nose. The flavors are sweet and full of honey, pilsner malt, moderate alcohol, and that odd champagne yeast. The flavor is quite as strong as the nose but it features a pretty solid array of flavor. It drinks light and with a nice little boozy, slightly tart finish. Overall it's a very nice beer and great for the style. I would definitely drink this one again."
"We do not know what to think. May be too revolutionary. Maybe just plain wrong."
"Overall: A unique beer, but drinks more like a nice liquor."
"Dr: Conceals its high ABV pretty well, and has good flavour limited by its relative simplicity. The price is usually excessive for this beer, and its quality doesn't justify its price. It's not as special as you might think, and there are far better beers in the style."
"O: Super clean and refreshing. This will be my new celebration beer. Move over champagne you got company."
"D - The muted appearance belies what is an enjoyable beer. Once the carbonation dies down a bit it's quite interesting."
"Popped the cork with a sturdy pop and poured into a champagne glass. The head was really big and fizzy the body was yellowish gold color. The head settles and doesn't leave any lacing. The beer aromas is in the light side. It's got a minimal fruity smell with some yeast on the nose. The taste is spicy and herbal. The beer tasted better when it's cold. Once it warms up the spices and stuff start to get a little funky. The mouthfeel is very carbonated which fits the beer really well. Overall I like the beer, the idea and the amount work put into it is exceptional. The beer is a bit pricey paying about $32 a bottle. But for a special event it's worth checking out."
"O - Really very impressed, as were all of my guests who eagerly helped me polish it off. I only wish that DeuS came in pocket sized bottles so that next time I hear the disgusted splutterings of Wholefoods beer browsers bemoaning ""How can anyone justify charging $30for a bottle of beer?", I could simply pull out the sampler and suggest that they use it as an aperitif to prepare them for eating their words"
"Crazy that this is a beer. It really is a must try. I love the explanation of how it's produced. I can see why the pricetag is so high. It's not the easiest drinking beer and should be treated as champagne. I would revisit this again for a celebration such as New Year's."
"I was actually happy to find that I wasn't super duper crazy about this beer. My tastes run more in the nice Belgian trippel and strong IPA ranges, which are expensive as far as beer goes but much cheaper than something like this. Good, but not the THE BEST in flavor in my opinion. I don't regret the purchase by any means, but I won't crave it the way I crave Chimay Trippel, La Fin du Monde, or Green Flash IPA."
"D: Fantastic beer worth celebrating with. Next time skip the Champagne and get this bier de champagne instead."
"Medium mouthfeel but feels light and airy with the copious amounts of carbonation. Very enjoyable overall. A bit expensive, but worth it on a special occasion. Drinkability seems to get better with every sip."
"Had my doubts, but this beer was quite good. Complex, unique, celebratory. Perfect for New Year's and/or the cellar. What I was hoping Infinium would be like."
"D: didn't enjoy it much but I had no difficulty drinking it, I still say that you either buy Champagne or a different beer, if you must try this style, try to look for Malheur Cuvée Royale, cost is too much I got it for 12  and I felt that, that was way too much and that was on the low end of the spectrum for this beer."
"Deus is a great beer for sharing at special occasions, I would not want to drink a whole bottle of this and Im certain that I would be bored by halfway. Truthfully I was done with this a few gulps in, it just does not do anything for my palate, id rather just drink a hopped up wheat wine cause that's what this reminds me off without the hops of course."
"Note: 2009 vintage"
"D- well its not what I was expecting but all in all about as good as I was thinking it would be. I'd like to see this done to a flanders red. Tasty but not one I'd do again."
"Poured into a champagne flute. Pours a pale yellow with some visible bubbles rising up. Starts out with huge white head that dissipates to nothing pretty quickly. No lacing at all. Smells a little bit funky and sour, in a good way though. Very yeasty too in the aroma. Flavour is quite dry. Thinner mouthfeel than I expected, seems a bit under-carbonated compared to champagne. Nice to try, but I won't get this again given the price."
"D. Very drinkable. Goes down very easy for 11.5%. I think this beer is an excellent blend of the beer and wine world. I wouldn't ever mind celebrating with this beer."
"Thanks to my son who gave this as a gift. Thanks big guy. An enjoyable drink."
"A very well executed melding of adjacent, yet complementary worlds - the sweet, strong Belgian pale ale given the day spa treatment of la méthode Champenoise. I would say that the appearance and aroma retain the French influence, and the rest - Belgian all the way, mon petit chou. A big fat win for European economic and drinking cooperation, and a fine way to celebrate another splendid year with my girl dear!"
"Medium bodied with lots of tight carbonation up front that somehow isn't over the top. Pretty sweet tasting with a lot of light fruit, bread/yeast and subtle alcohol warmth. Well balanced and very quaffable with hints of sour apple, pear, banana and citrus. Excellently masked ABV with a dry finish. This beer tastes half as strong as it actually is. An interesting hybrid of champagne and Belgian golden ale."
"The cork on this DeuS bottle partially released itself with a satisfyingly sounding POP. Beer loving couples may really consider this for a wedding ""champagne"". The DeuS could probably use a tad bit more sweetness."
"Overall, it was interesting beer of very rare style, but I am not sure I could afford to drink it very often."
"D Very good drinkable beer. Much better than champagne. A pretty well crafted beer, good balance and it was hard to taste the alcohol. 4.5"
"Who needs champagne when you've got deus? Its certainly worth what it costs. I'd buy a bottle and store it for a special occassion."
"D: Can barely taste the alcohol, which makes the high abv surprising. A bit spendy but probably would put it about other similar beers like Duvel (poured it into a Duvel chalice)."
"D: Delicious. Really interesting beer. My family are more wine drinkers and they can't believe there's not fruit in the ingredients."
"This beer pours with a pale golden color. The head follows the expectations with any champignon. The aromas are heavy with with pear and other sour notes. Despite this beer being from two kinds of beverages which bring expectations of intense carbonation, this beverage is not is as intense as you would expect. The aroma brings on heavy notes of green apple. The flavor is full of those green apple notes with heavy hints of honey in the finish."
"This was amazing! It kind of reminded me of a farmhouse style ale, however with much drier finish. Both the nose and the palate was loaded with spicy, malty flavors with a touch of banana and creme brolee. In the finish you notice a dry patch in the back of your throat which I have only come across a few times in my adventers in beer. It is a bit pricey but I don't mind paying for it if the occasion suits."
"The mouthfeel is refreshing nice and prickly like fizzy old champagne - how strange..."
"Extremely clea pale straw color. Very white nice champagne hea at pour, settles to larger bubbles. Spicer aroma. Some alcohol present as well. Not as spivey as it smells. Alcohol comes through on finish. A little floralness in the overall. Very clean, good balance, I enjoy the spices not being overbearing. Vert drinkable, nice overall beer, good for an inagural all grain brewing. Not quit sure it's worth the price but still very good."
"M 3"
"This is a great beer, one that shows how beer can rise to great heights, but does it on its own terms. This has the puissance, finesse, and fruite of a good, if not very good, champagne yet it still tastes of a Belgian golden ale. A beer for a celebration; my friends and I enjoyed it during the last game of the 2010 World Series."
"Overall, this beer has significant Champagne overtones and venture into cider, peare, and timid malt character which bridges many aspects of fermented beverages. The testamony of this beer speaks wonders about the possability of what beer can be."
"Overall, a very tastey and complex brew."
"D: Can't say I can justify this beer. 30$ is way to much for this as it's not that great in my mind. Carbonation is way to high."
"Drinkability:Really unique Belgium beer. Tons of depth and complexity."
"This seems to be a champagne made with grain rather than grapes. The guide even suggests using champagne glasses. It is growing on me as I try it with friends in Belgium. Once I got my mind around this, I began to enjoy this offering. It's quite good if you don't expect anything that resembles a beer."
"Notes: Vintage 2009. Not really as champagne/sparking wine tasting as I was kind of expecting, more spiced cider like, but it did have some sparkling wine aspects as well. Overall it was a nice zesty drink."
"D= I had been meaning to try this one for a long time but never got around to it. Then my buddy Juan picked up a bottle and we gave it a try. Overall I would say I liked this a lot, and it is certainly a unique beer. The alcohol stays mostly in check, especially considering the huge ABV, making this dangerously drinkable."
"I wanted to show the gf this style, as I have had some good ones. Sadly, this wasn't the one to try to get her hooked on, so many better options out that you are free to skip this."
"D: Pricey. Very much so. But even so, it's a wonderful experience. A must for special occasions."
"Beer is surprisingly thin...lots of carbonation but I'm not fooled. There is a spiciness to it, almost a peppery note to the whole thing. Mild sweetness on the front end. Finishes quite dry. I don't know. Its not as good as I hoped. Don't think its a repeat for me unfortunately. I'd be willing to try other examples that are supposedly not as good as this one."
"Also saw bottles for sale at Premier Gourmet for $35 on May 3, 2010."
"Price = $29.99 at Joe Canals"
"Medium bodied, highly carbonated, and unique in a good way. Best to drink this cold. I like this a lot, but can't see buying it often given the price."
"D: It may be easy to drink in regards to taste and complexity, but the ABV will knock your socks off. In addition, the odd floral accents might get tiresome after a while. Good beer/champagne hybrid, but between the price and the style, it's not something to have frequently. Good for celebrating something, and/or as a conversation piece at a party."
"D: its drinkable but I do tire of the sweet taste I am glad I just had 1 glass I would not want to drink the entire bottle"
"D: Very, very drinkable. This is definitely going to be one to break out for others to try, especially as a ""conversion"" type beer."
"An all around good to very good beer, but doesn't justify the hoop-la of ""French Champagne"" or the price tag."
"Caution - have your glass ready. A single pause and the beer starts gushing!"
"Some milestones just can't be celebrated with your run-of-the-mill ""special"" beer. But what self-respecting beer-head wants to be seen hoisting up a dainty Champagne flute? As beer goes, it's hard to find a finer, more subtle, clearer, or more finessed ale, but it's certainly not a gift from above. At worst it's the best alternative to Champagne I've ever found. If you've got the cash ($22-$32 depending) and a reason to celebrate, this is a must-try. It's almost reason enough to go buy Champagne flutes. Enjoy!"
"Glad I had the other champagne beer at the same time, puts this one very firmly into second place."
"The appearance is decent with a nice full frothy head and a beautiful cascade of bubbles like you would find in any champagne. But then there was the taste. I can't even tell what this is. It dose not have either the dryness or the wet fruitiness you would find in champagnes. At the same time it barely resembles beer. It is almost flavorless and what it does have is almost like carbonated parsley. The malt profile was quite nice but not enough to save this travesty."
"Deus was a bit of an eye opener. Pop this out in a Champagne situation, and watch the non-beer drinkers as they taste it. A fantastic beer for celebration and proving what beer can be to non-beer drinkers."
"Overall, a truly special brew. A must try at least once, I suggest keeping a couple bottles around for when the mood strikes."
"I was expecting a much different journey with DeuS. In honesty, I don't drink champagne, so I really had no idea where this beer would go. It sure is interesting though, but I'd only want a little at a time. It looks like I'll be sipping on the 750 ml bottle until the new year."
"I shared this with a bunch of people, but drank the majority of it with no problem. Truely a unique beer and one best shared with loved ones on a special occasion, because this bottle could easily put the largest men on there ass before they knew what hit them."
"This is not an everyday beer by any stretch of the imagination but for special occasions it makes a good talking point and a good way to stick with beer when most people would not give it a chance."
"D: Very good. I enjoyed this with a couple of friends and they were very happy to sit around and drink some beer champagne. I really wanted to open one of my other two bottles I have just waiting for the right time to open it."
"I just don't get this beer. I usually score based on style but, given the unique nature of this beer, I have to rate on overall impression. Don't particularly like it. Certainly would not buy again given the price point."
"750 ml bottle bought by Bryan - thanks! A champagne beer, and nearly as strong at 11.5%. Straw-colored, rapidly disappearing head, so appears flat in the glass. Tastes like champagne, with a touch of hoppy bitterness. Gimmicky - especially the Dom Perignot bottle. Not worth the pricetag."
" Next time an occasion arises requiring a nice bottle of champagne...grab one of these instead."
"This was my first champagne beer and it didn't disappoint. The beers pours a golden color with a huge fluffy white head. The beer has many small bubbles like champagne and the bubbles remained during the entire time it was in the glass. The smell is of lemons and malt and the taste was similar, with some yeast in there as well. For a beer that was 11.5% ABV, the alcohol is nearly completely hidden. The beer didn't taste like champagne, but the high carbonation made it feel like champagne as you drank it. This is an expensive beer and is not an every day drinker, but for a special occasion, I don't think you can go wrong with DeuS."
"Prost!"
"Pours a nice, clear golden, with a big carbonation that sings to you from the glass. Nose is nutmeg, allspice, cloves, juniper, and a kiss of sourness. Flavor is a big, somewhat cloying spice flavor, with subtle tartness, giving way to a menthol finish. Perhaps even a Splenda-esque aftertaste. A neat beer but it doesn't work for me. Think: gin and diet tonic."
"I didn't expect much from this $8 5.5oz glass, but I was very impressed and would definitely buy this again, despite the high price."
"Mouthfeel is very much in line with a standard champagne, even though the flavor is not, it is very smooth with an almost mousse like texture."
"D: Wonderful to sip; the floral and spice-infused aroma makes you want to have more just to enjoy its uniqueness. An excellent beer."
"D - High alcohol, you feel this one right away. Hearty, but also smooth. And the alcohol is beautifully hidden. An excellent sipping beer."
"Overall, a great beer. It's not something I would purchase often, but for special occasions this is a beer lovers champagne alternative. You get the champagne experience and appeal with all the Belgian or Wild beer lovers indulgences. Plus this beer gets bonus points for creativity."
"Drinkability- Its easy to drink but to me this just was a little off, i would recommend it for the price of 30 a bottle almost, worth a look once just out of how unique this is for a beer, the taste is reminiscent of some beers but in someway you do feel it more like a champagne, a one time try for me"
"Simply one of the most complex brews I've ever tasted."
"a very interesting style of beer, doubtless. not to be considered a champagne by any means, but the beer like quality is very iffy, this is really a border-line style and a true innovation of modern brewing."
"Very nice beer, love this one. Expensive but a nice special occasion beer."
"Drinkability: Sipper. Definitely an occasion maker - this walks hand in hand with the price. Not an everyday thing - but certainly a special treat for the beer advocate."
"I poured from a 25.6 ounce bottle into champagne flutes. The bottle opened with a loud pop. The beer is a clear, golden yellow in appearance with a fizzy white head and long streams of bubbles along the sides of the glass. The smell is of a sweet white wine. The beer taste like a sparkling wine. It is a little sweet balanced by a bit of sour. The mouthfeel is of lots of carbonation, medium to light body. The beer is very interesting, but I will not buy it again. It is a bit overpriced (30 bucks a bottle), and if I want something similiar I could get a decent sparkling wine for less. That being said it is amazing this is beer. If you have friends who say they only like wine let 'em try deus."
"Very good drinkability although the high abv and the carbonation keep it from becoming a session beer. That and it's $30+ price. I would like to try this beer again but the price is a bit more than I'd like to spend for a single brew."
"From a large, heavy champagne-like bottle, this one opens with an explosive bang! (Watch out for flying corks). It pours just like a sparkling wine, except for a slightly darker golden hue and a stable foam head. The bubbles form and rise just as you'd expect, and the sensation in your mouth is just like a sparkling wine as well. This is one truly interesting and remarkable beer. Sweeter than I expected, it's malt profile becomes central as the beer warms. The aroma has a bit of malt, alcohol, and carbon dioxide (and a bit of fruit...apricot). Fresh and lively. Honey and a little sugar come out in the taste. This is a fun beer, and one that I'd try again (especially as a champagne substitute)."
"DeuS is a very interesting beer. It's my first Bière de Champagne, so I don't have any prior experience to compare it to. As a beer, it's pretty good stuff and I'd happily try other takes on the style. This particular one could use a little work in the abv department. Just a little too hot and boozy. That's the only real complaint I have. It measures up pretty well otherwise. Well, except for that small price tag problem. Frankly, it's too expensive. I've enjoyed the experience, but wouldn't pay the same price for another bottle. Just sayin'."
"Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that quickly settles to a whisp of foam. A lot of carbonation bubbles makes this an exciting looking ale. Patches of sticky lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is very subdued. I detect some sweet fruit and maybe a little funk and malt. Has an intriging taste. Slightly sweet and vinous at the start but a definate tartness in the finish. Notes of apple, pears, and cinnamon. Alcohol is barely detectable but there is a subtle warming affect. Light body with a fizzy carbonation. An effervescent beer if there ever was one. A beer for special occasions. Is it more enjoyable than a comparably priced sparkling wine? I would say it would be an excellant alternative."
"D= not too great. It was ok but the alcohol was too heavy for me."
"D - wow. I can't get over this beer. A friend had told me it was amazing, but damn, words don't prepare you. A Belgian beer-champagne, and every bit as wonderful as you'd think from that description! Can't recommend enough. Perfect for any celebratory situation that would call for champagne. Is this really 11.5% ABV? You'd have no idea. Word"
"D - This is a weird style to be able to call beer but thats what it is and its damn good pretty easy to drink with a good taste I'd rather have this than champagne"
"Great bottle presentation. The beer was opened with a nice loud pop but no rush of beer out of the bottle which is good. It poured a clear golden color with a rapid stream of bubbles running from the bottle, great carbonation. The thick white head gave way to a solid ring on the edge of the glass after several minutes. The nose was sweet, malty and spicey and the taste was sweet, a tad bitter and very full. Overall a very nice beer, sort of like a champagne."
"Served from a bottle and purchased at Duke's Ale House in Crystal Lake, IL. Appearance is bubbly with a lot of carbonation. Color is light and golden. There is a hint of sweet pear in the smell and the taste is crisp, light for the alcohol content, and has a nice tartness in the after taste. A great beer to share with friends and definately worth some furthur investigation."
"This could easily substitute for Champagne, in fact it might be fun to serve this to non-beer drinkers in place of Champagne and find out their impression of the beer."
"This review is from my recollections of last night at the Sunset Bar and Grill in Allston. Thanks to Justin for getting a bottle of this. Poured a golden straw color, with a little bit of heading. Lots of carbonation bubbles, looks a lot like champaign. Smell is sweet, almost with a sprite or ginger ale like quality. Taste was sugary sweet, with definite fruit traces, peach came to mind for me. Body was highly carbonated and refreshing. A bottle of this would be easy to put down IMO. Great beer, I was surprised it wasn't more dry. Some time soon I will get a bottle."
"Don't really like this style but I still enjoyed it."
"Judging by the previous reviews I am not the only one who decided to splurge to ring in 2009. Poured a well-carbonated, bubbly thin yellow body with a large head that quickly receeds. A light, fruity smell with faint air of cask-conditioning (I assume that's what I smelling since they are using champagne storage methods on this beer). A sharp, bitter citric fruit taste along with pears and apples. Also, real smooth in the mouth after you get used to the prickliness and it starts to sweeten up. Almost starts to get slick as it rolls down the tongue and finishes real crisp and dry with oakiness. A great beer, but I've had some Belgians pretty similiar and for $30 I would say try this on a special occasion but it doesn't warrant repeat/regular drinking at that price to me. And to be honest, if you or your girl (in my case) really just want champagne you can always buy some cheap spumante and save $20."
"This is unlike anything I have ever tasted. It is a must for any serious beer fan. It is worth the money to try. In a day and age where unexceptional beers command exorborant prices, this is one beer that lives up to the billing. And although expensive, I have drank generic champagnes at twice the price. Seek, enjoy and save for a special occasion. Have a great 2009!!!!"
"A nice beer to ring in 2009."
"D: A little too carbonated for me, though that's the style."
"750 ml bottle, 2006 vintage. Served in a flute, the beer pours a clear golden color with a huge carbonated white head. Head retention is excellent, lacing is good. Looks just like a glass of champagne would. It smells like candy sugar, grapes, pears, yeast and peppery spice. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pepper, ginger, Belgian yeast, pears, grapes and bananas. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high carbonation but it's soft which makes it feel nice and creamy. Drinkability is very good considering the ABV, and the alcohol isn't very noticable at all. It wouldn't be a problem to finish off a bottle of this. All in all it's a very good and unique beer, I would definitely buy this again (even with the $25 price tag) and drink it every once in a while. It's probably better shared with friends, but not too bad for just one person to drink, either."
"D - The body is the best feature of this beer. It is not as sour as I expected, but still quite champagne like. This is definitely a special occasion beer; not just because of the price, but also because it just isn't very drinkable."
"Overall: Although on the expensive side it was worth every penny. If you're going to be celebrating in style this is the beer to do it with."
"D: It's not my style but it was entertaining and cleaned my palate. I could see it as a good before dinner drink with cheese, fruit and veggies. To high and ABV for a session brew."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and a very interesting take on it. Quite unique. Probably not worth the price tag (at least the imported price tag here in Australia), but good once in a while."
"D - A bottle is enough, but that's 6 champagne flutes... LOL."
"thank you goes out to the mack daddy little pedro, stumac! , lets stop at jack in the box and be late!! ... spritzy is a great way to classify this beer ... lots of sweetness, honey mostly... is very delicious stuff... is foam friendly ... is a strong beer that is a fun one to drink!!"
"Drinkability is low to moderate. I highly doubt this is created for mass consumption, as that would be sickening. A great experience though, and I'd drink it again if someone gave it to me."
"Superb wine (ahem) beer...."
"I've written enough. Now I shall drink."
"pours up nice pale yellow with sparkling champaigne-like quality. big nice white head. the nose is very yeasty, notes of pears, slight sour note(?). the taste is very sweet, honey notes, very buttery, subtle dried fruit, sweet finish. nice full body. good beer"
"drinkability is good. this is essentially wine, with enough malt character to bring the brewing process onto the palate. wonderful for a celebratory toast. cheers!"
"make it for special occasions only."
"Pretty good, pretty expensive."
"Pours from a bottle into a chalice. Very pale yellow with A LOT of bubbles. Looks exactly like champagne. Smell is spicy, sweet, with some fruit scents. Taste...tastes exactly like freaking champagne. It's hard to believe this was classified as beer. I can't drink a pint glass of champagne, nor could I drink a pint of this stuff. Like champagne, it was sweet to start and finished dry. Way too much carbonation for this beer to be enjoyable. Filled the stomach with so much air, I couldn't finish this one. Definitely not my style of beer. $25 down the drain."
"Overall, I was really shocked how good this beer is. Very drinkable. Wonderful. Unique and delicious. Just amazing. Is it worth the price: Yes. Am I glad I have another one in the cellar: Yes. Would I buy another if I had the chance: Absolutely. The perfect beer for special occasions."
"The bottle is really nice looking; upscale even. I'm not really sure what to expect, but as I like most Belgian beers I'm thinking positive. I've popped the cork out of quite a few bottles of beer, but holy shit that was loud!!! I'm a bit shaken, but I think I can go on. Huge, bubbling, noisy, off-white head fades quickly to a thick film. A bit of bubble gum and candied apricot in the aroma along with a bit of white grapes. The aroma is definitely unique, and I'd say closest to a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. A bit of vanilla, some flowers, cotton candy, and I swear there is a dry white whine flavor in there too (is it mental?). It reminds me a bit of Unibroue's La Fin Du Monde, but even more potent. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy with a fairly strong alcohol burn. I like it...the flavors and aromas are strong and inviting. The alcohol is a bit much, especially when compared to traditional champagne. It was fun to try once, but it's just too expensive to drink in the future. To be fair I can't imagine any beer being worth 5 to 10 times the average."
"Very easy to drink, very tasty. Also very expensive. May thanks to fellow BA mtanji for this delicious treat on our recent visit."
"I would say it's not very drinkable due to the high alcohol content and the price, but it was a good celebratory beer, indeed."
"It foams up and subsides to a skim. The nose is slightly spicy and the taste is very spicy. It's somewhat sweet, but beguiling in its complexity. The nose has a little cork but the taste is clean and a little sweet, but only a little. The flavor acts like anise without the licorice. It is wonderful. I'm going to stop reviewing now and drink beer."
"D - For a beer of this magnitude, drinkability is good. I'd like to try this fresh, though it certainly wasn't bad aged for several years. I'm going to finish the rest of the bottle with my favorite beer pairing, smoked salmon and water crackers. Another one of those beers that really blasts through the apparent limits of what beer can be."
"Carbonation is through the roof and forces you to sip slowly. This combined with the booziness really doesn't make for high drinkability."
"Drinks pretty good, this goes down easier than champagne to me! The wife liked it too! To me this was like a saison/wit/sparkling ale/mead hybrid. a great one to try om your wine snob friends!"
"certainly one of the more interesting beers i've tried. served in a snifter from a champagne style bottle, this was clear and golden with apricot hues, champagne-like bubbles and a diminishing, lively white head and lacing. powerful and complex nose, with a funky, earthy, mustiness, light colored fruit, flowers, honey, and more. a nice bit of sweetness upfront is balanced out by just enough sour character and the lively carbonation. a vague spiciness also is present. medium-bodied and effervescent mouthfeel, complex finish. fuller, less sour mouthfeel than champagne, overall very nice mouthfeel. definitely worth a try and i'd much prefer this to sparkling wine or champagne."
"Drinkablility: If this were not so expensive, I would drink this every week. However, the intensity of the taste up front, as well as the cost makes this one a very special beer to be consumed on a very special occasion. In this case it was my birthday, as well as Super Bowl Sunday..."
"Fred Eckhardt was right: ""Alongside Deus, Champagne is boring"". A true masterpiece."
"I did not particularly care for this beer. It appears in my beer store, and I've been tempted to give it another try, but my initial impression was an overly ginger character and given the price I didn't think it was exceptional."
"750 ml bottle, got it for $28, which I thought was pricey, but apparently it's a steal compared to the $40 some other reviewers paid. Cork came off with a champagne 'pop', smoke then issuing from the bottle. Poured it into a goblet glass, really should have used a flute. Even so, pure white 3 finger head that settled down quickly, leaving zero lace. After sitting for 15-20 minutes, the head is completely gone. Appearance once the head is gone is just like a sauvignon blanc; I could take a picture of it in a wine glass and you'd never know it was beer. Tastes much better after warming up a bit. Refrigerator temperatures are definitely too cold for this beer. Flavors of apple and banana, with just a wee little hint of malt on the finish. No hops detectable...are there even any in this? A very unique and unusual beer. If you approach food pairings like you would a white wine, you'll do fine."
"A very interesting beer. It isnt so dry and not too reminiscent to champagne in my opinion. It is still very unique and quite tastey. Worth a try."
"D = I'd say this is very drinkable. High ABV, so cannot drink too much, but great for a special occasion."
"Drinkability - Here once again I find the sweetness a little to much for me. Otherwise a very approachable beer. And with the alchohol so nicely hidden It works well for what it is. At somewhere around $40 in colorado for a bottle, I'm not going to buy this one again."
"D - Quite a complex beer indeed. Obviously not something to drink on a regular basis (even if you have money) as there are better choices at less money. For special occasions though I guess it's worth a shot."
"Bottle from 2002. Pours dark gold with a small haze, and a big white head. Aroma is extremely complex with notes of white pepper, and big floral notes, especially Hawaiian white ginger, as well as cinnamon and allspice. Flavor is just as complex as the aroma, sweet, spicy and softly phenolic, with notes of clove, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. Alcohol is apparent but very softly so. This is a true gem of a beer, one of the best beers in the world, and worth seeking out, and aging."
"Slight haze in a whitish lemon yellow body. Big, fluffy, rocky, tumultuous, powder white head. Beautiful. Fresh hay, powdered sugar, lemon sorbet, barn cobwebs, tangy yeast, ambrosia-like hop aromas, and herbal-floral goodness on the nose. Taste is big and complex with spicy, sugary tropical fruits and melon, lemon-lime sorbet, hints of anise liqueur, funky hay, and floral, herbal hop bitterness. A touch of sweetness early, but finishes drier and peppery, with some warming alcohol. Medium-full body hides underneath very effervescent, bubbly carbonation that helps make this beer go down easy. A great, unique beer/style. World class."
"Not a hard beer to drink. It could go well with some sharp cheeses. It could also go well with some fish. The food pairing suggestion suggests meat as well, but I do not think it would be a good pairing."
"Champagne carbonation to this. Very bubbly and sharp on the tongue. Taste detracts a bit from the drinkability, but perhaps because this is New Years, I had higher expectations."
"Poured into a champagne flout. Poured a clear, light golden with a large, fizzy head. This is probably one of the prettiest (if you can use this descriptor for beer) beers I have ever seen. Smell is spicy and sweet. Taste is much the same. I really dont know how to describe it. Mouthfeel is just like champagne. Amazing. This is a really cool beer."
"POP! The cork is art itself. Pours a magnificent toasted corn hue with a quick two finger white layer of bubbles that die down instantly to barely a thin crust of mist above. Constant bubbles from start to finish. Smell is fresh and new with a sweet perfume aroma that sweetens the nose. A light caramel scent that leads you in what's to come. Taste was not what I had expected. Big musky banana flavors with a thick honey sweetness. Solid carbonation in the mouth with a slick texture. The alcohol is definitely there but could be worse. A beer to share for sure. Perfect beer for the occasion. Cheers to BA in 2008!"
"The Brick Store Pub sells this by the glass, and I've been wanting to try it for awhile, so that seemed like a good way to sample it without pulling the trigger on a whole bottle. I have to say that it was excellent, very champagne-like and kept very well by the BSP- which is no surprise. Pours very pale with a constant stream of bubbles, thin ring of head- looks like champagne. Aromas of apple pie,peaches, clove. Very dry in the nose. Tastes of spicy apple pie, cream, and with bitter cherry on the finish. Mouthfeel is sparkling and creamy and has a very dry finish. Absolutely delightful- not a novelty at all, a solid style and solid representation of the style."
"Pours just like champagne. A darker gold with a great balance of bubbles. Very large head. Nose is a gentle yeast with a slight sweet edge. Flavor is like a demi-sec champagne, yet its beer. Sweet, but an obvious though slight hop influence. The effect of being aged in wood is noticeably present. Strong perfume presence as well. Feel is like a good champagne. Drinkable? Personally I think when they made this, they thought: ""What would John like?"" Unbelievable. My first perfectly rated beer. If there are any ways for this to be better, I cant wait to try it out. $30 for a bottle...and damn well worth it."
"The price of this beer can skew your opinion because it seems that it should be beyond amazing. Well my feeling for this beer is that the champagne process adds an unique twist to the finish and the way it looks in the glass. It started out like a typical Belgian triple but a yeasty ginger note appeared towards the end. I really like the champagne like features and the carbonated mouthfeel. A beer for celebrating special occasions."
"I will say that this is the first beer of this style that i have tried. Pours like champagne, highly carbonated and smelling like grain. There is a very thick head, but it settles quickly. This brew hurt my mouth. it tastes very metallic with grainy finish. I am not a big fan, especially for the price, but i put a bottle away for the hell of it. I think it is overrated, I would rather spend 20 bucks on some scaldis noel."
"The mouthfeel is very fizzy and the carbonic bite makes me think that attepmting to make a champagne beer is nice but actually doing one commercially is a bad idea."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Mouthfeel is great, just as it should be. Really bubbly and light on the palate with a dry finish. This is something that I'll definitely be buying again, I like the idea of having this beer on hand for special occasions-right now I'm celebrating the fact that I am done with exams...and stress for a month or so. It is pricey, I paid $24 for this but I think that it's worth it, unless I find another of the same style I'll be buying this one again very soon."
"It's not cheap, but if you can find a place to buy it by the glass (Brick Store Pub in Decatur GA), I highly, highly recommend it."
"It's wonderful to just sit here and enjoy, but the hefty price tag in Australia probably means I won't buy it anytime soon. It is definently something I will buy once a year though."
"Review added 11-21-2007, translated from french 3-2-2008."
"Smell is kind of sweet, but a malty sweetness that reminds you that this is still beer. Also a bit of minty/medicinal smell in there too which my friends didn't like, but i didn't mind. The taste was similar, with that minty/medicinal flavor coming out again. Mouthfeel was light and dry with just enough carbonation, not overdone. I ended up drinking most of the bottle since my two friends didn't really like it, so you know it is drinkable. Price is a bit high and i didn't like it enough to probably ever buy it again, but very unique and i am glad to have tried it. Definately better than the Freixenet, and an awesome bottle for the collection."
"The taste was sweet. Very sweet. The sweetness of the beer overpowered every other taste I had hoped to experience. The mouthfeel was medium body and high carbonation. Overall drinkability was poor for me. For me the beer is way to sweet and I can get much better beers at better prices. This beer retails for nearly $20 a bottle. I can mix and awesome 6 for that price."
"Overall, a nice beer if you like them really sweet in flavor, and really dry in mouthfeel. Not to my taste, unfortunately. It would probably go quite well with sushi."
"Overall, a very tastey and complex brew. Worth a try for a special occasion for sure, but the price ($26 a bottle) is a bit much for regular consumption."
"Overall: This beer is great. It is all I have expected from the beer and the style."
"Drinkability is off the charts. If this was any less of a beer I would have rated drinkabilty very low because of the price tag, but this beer is just so damn good. It's going to be hard to tell my girlfriend that I spent this much on 1 single beer, but fuck that. This stuff is amazing."
"cool beer. strong. flavorful. bright. classybelgian"
"When I ordered this my server was blown away. Apparently they don't sell it often and it was off limits for staff tasting. So as a BA I offered to share a glass and wound up having a fun conversation with both my waiter and the bar manager responsible for bringing in this treat."
"Don't let the price tag scare you off. Buy it for that special occasion and enjoy. I know you will."
"Vintage 2002. Poured into Delirium glass. Smell fruity with hint of ginger. Very carbonated. Sweet, little spicy. Had been aged for 5 years. Although alcohol is probably around 12ish % (from aging), taste was not overpowering. Wish I could get my hands on another bottle of it, but I haven't seen it elsewhere."
"This beer poured a hazy yellow with miniscule bubbles that appeared to be the product of secondary fermentation. The beer had a lemon-lime soda aroma that was reminiscent to me of the ""Squirt"" brand. Mouthfeel was very chalky and rough in nature while flavor was lemon-y in flavor. I am not a fan."
"Overall: This one is a definite special occasion beer, and at that, I can think of several others Id have before this one, such as Samiclaus, Trap Roch 8 or 10, and even DFH 120 Minute. The only reason I sampled this beer is that it was a gift; otherwise it would still be sitting on the specialty stores shelf as a curio. Worth a try."
"Losing close to half the bottle while opening really pissed me off. Things started badly however the depth of flavour, inventivness and originality of this beer really make up for it. Big belgian character with champagne mouthfeel and brewing techniques, a very good match it seems. I can't see myself buying this very often due to its high price however its a superb beer which I'm very glad to have tried"
"Very drinkable for 11.5%.... however, I would suggest sharing this one with someone.... make an occassion of it. That said, would I buy this again? Perhaps.... but not any time soon... if it were around $15, it would be a regular purchase for me."
"A unique beer with a hefty price tag. Certainly worth it at least once."
"Overall an excellent example of the style, and I like what they were trying to achieve. But for my money, I'll take a few bottles of Tremens or Duvel..."
"Beef Notes: I thought this might be a little more champagne-like, but I'm rather satisfied with the way it is. Maybe not worth the money but a good beer to try once and definitely one to toast with."
"$25 for a bottle in Paducah. Pours into a flute a slightly hazed,yellow body with a towering mound of white foam atop. The frothy vanilla head eventually falls into an attractive meringue. Aroma is floral and grainy, somewhat exotic. Rosewater essence is prominent. Mouthfeel is light mediumbodied with spritzy carbonation. Taste is very dry. Green strawberries leads an unusual fruity aspect, blending with spice, yeast, and mint. Fruity combines with floral, finishing very dry. Quite champagne like. Very interesting, and nicely drinkable but for the price I'll pass next time."
"Bottle (2002 enjoyed in 2007): Poured a medium beige/orangey color ale with a light white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of dry cereal with some saison-like yeasty notes. Taste was quite dry with some nice malt presence and a dry yeasty finish. Carbonation was a bit too much for my liking but I guess that is part of this beer style. Even though this beer packs a bit of alcohol, I couldnt detect any alcohol notes. While this beer was quite interesting and complex, it does confirm that I am not a big fan of Champagne and even though brew with beer ingredient, I still dont dig the mouthfeel."
"edit: much different than Miller High Life."
"D- It is very unusual. It is tasty but I don't think I would pay $25 for it again unless it is a very special occasion."
"I realize I am probably not worthy, and I will review this beer with it's beerstyle in mind."
"I've had the Deus several times now, so I feel compelled to review it. It is by far one of the most enticing and complex beers that I have ever been exposed to. The last time I was lucky enough to drink it from my very own Deus flute (Thanks Mike nice gift!). It is without a doubt the champagne of beers, very highly carbonated and makes a lovely streaming cascade of bubbles in the glass. Just by looking I could confuse it for champagne, but I'm no champagne expert. Actually, I don't even like champagne. Which make it hilarious that I love this beer! It makes a great special occasion item, just like champagne. The color of this beer in my flute is a very pale straw color, very similar to an American light larger but the similarities end there. The nose is a sweet and musky scent but light for those scents. The mouthfeel is of course very carbonated and light, almost airy. The taste is light and dry with hints of ginger, honey, crisp fruit (maybe green apples but not sour?), and is very complex. Very, very nice. Expensive but well worth it if you decide to try it."
"The mouthfeel is a gentle explosion of incredibly light and airy carbonation with a medium body and effervescent, fluffy texture. Sensory overload pretty much sums up all aspects of this brew. The abv% feels(not tastes) more like 13-14%, as it gently warms the gullet. The price tag is irrelevent, this is bottled bliss here."
"Carbonation explodes in the mouth followed by a distinctly concord grape flavor. Very effervescent. More like a champagne than a beer."
"Pours VERY pale yellow, like faded straw, with lots...and lots...and lots...and lots...and lots of VERY small bubbles. Looks, well, like champagne. Extremely carbonated with a large, persistant head. It smells of bananas, peaches, and apricots. Not a whole lot to not like there. Taste - pepper up front, then the fruit comes on with a hint of licorice. Very dry finish, but it comes off as refreshing and crisp. Mouthfeel is all about the carbonation, but it has enough ale body to sustain it. Drinkability is excellent. Doesn't really have an alcohol taste or feel despite its prodigious strength, and the dry finish is refreshing. A winner for sure. Worth the price? I don't doubt the work that goes into it & that the price is justified, but definitely not a daily drinker."
"Drinkability is quite good given the strong flavor profile of this beer. Most definitely a sipping beer and a bottle would serve four perfectly. In terms of cost, I can't really say that it is worth it but this is one luxurious beer for sure. Cost aside, this will be a New Year celebration tradition for me."
"Cheers!"
"What a way to celebrate my 2nd aniversary on Beer Advocate."
"Poured out a bright pale gold color, crystal clear, with a nice creamy/foamy white head that sat there forever. The nose offered some earthy and sweet malt notes, hop bitterness, and some funky yeast. The taste had a fantastic balance of malt and hops, just leaning bitter, rounded by some spic alcohol that was present without being overbearing. the mouthfeel was barely there, low carbonation, light on the tongue, with a warm alcoholic burn at the end."
"Notes: An amazing brew and an interesting style. This beer has a lot of complexity and some really good flavors going for it. Not the most drinkable beer, by far. The price tag is a bit high for a regular, but this is well worth picking up for special occasions."
"Mouthfeel- Dry and a little tart. But the carbonation really brought an exciting element to this beers feeling it left on you."
"for being 4 years old this is still going good. could probably go another 4 years. at $26.99 a bottle i don't think i'll find out though. this also paired really good with some home made meatloaf."
"Overall an excellent experience, and if you can find it for under $30, get one or two, throw them in a cellar (or don't and drink them immediately) and let them get even better with age."
"D = Damn drinkable. This beer is so damn good it is worth the damn $40 price tag."
"Bottom line - It's decent if you are looking for a tart/sour Belgian with some champagne-like qualities. But, it's not worth $25+ a bottle."
"Fomr the moment I opened and poured this beer, it screamed vitality. The look, the smell, and the flavor come together to make it a special event. The sole setback with the flavor, for my money, is the complexity which, combined with its effervescent spirit, makes it somewhat of a challenge on the palate. Still, the joyous nature of this beer makes it a pleasure to experience. One other thing...at $25 per bottle, it is indeed special, but I'm not really sold on the price tag. That makes this a one time, or at least remarkably special time, beer."
"(25.4 oz fat yellow-ish brown champagne bottle, corked, caged, and wrapped with gold foil)"
"Taste: Prickly effervesence that skipped and frolicked all over my tongue and tickled the sides of my mouth. For a ""Brut", it was a lot more cloying than I expected. I'd be curious to know what they used as filling liquor at the ""dégorgement"" stage. As my glass slowly heated up (I served it at about 4°C), the sweetness subsudes and the powerful alcoholic effluves take over to give a dry, minty aftertaste, not unlike mouthwash. Letting it warm a bit and pairing this one with a very sweet dessert was somewhat of a mistake, because it really brought the booze out, it became almost like an eau de vie, or white crème de menthe, or maybe even a kirsh, but withouth the cherry pits. For a Beer with a Champagne twist, it was interesting and suitable for a special occasion, although it didn't really deliver what I was expecting for the price I paid."
"75 cl. bottle, 2004 vintage. The corked popped but luckily the beer was not spilled. Champagned like head of course, very nice appearance. In the nose, something slightly toasted, wood, resin, some honey, a little oily, which I think is good for this type, clove. In the mouth is dry, casked conditioned wine and it reminds me of salted toasted almonds. In the mouth, some fruit, dry, oily, and reminds me of cake. You could have this as an aperitif or wirh desserts. STrong body. Wonderful."
"An unusual beer that's quite good. However, I'd buy it a lot more often if it were priced around $10 to 12 instead of $24."
"I poured this into a snifter since the champange flute is too small for me to be drinking out of. The head is that of a champ. lots of tiny bubbles, just carbonation out of control. The aroma was alcoholic and sweet. The taste was a little citrusy, dry, and a backbone of malt. The hops were slightly presesnt with a spiciness, but the sweet alochol overpowered most of the brew. The mouthfeel is sticky sweet and not good when warmed. Not something that I try again. I had it for the experience and I'm glad for that. My friend and I didn't even finish the bottle (it's just not that good a brew for my tastebuds)."
"2002 vintage. This brew pours a cloudy pale orange color with vast streams of visible carbonation. The head is huge, billowy and bright white. The aroma is like a tripel, a saison, and a strong pale ale mixed as one. Citrus and strong earthy tones battle for dominance. The citrus might come out on top by a hair, but my nose is the real winner. The taste is as immense as the aroma, but with the addition of a large alcohol burn in the finish. I had expected the mouthfeel to feel as carbonated as champagne, and the visible carbonation leads me to believe that it might be. However, although it does feel highly carbonated, the medium-full body of this brew makes the carbonation less detectable. Overall, this is a mighty fine brew that I am glad to have found on sale a couple months ago for $18.99 (used to be $24.99). With the price so high I can't see myself buying it again until I see it on sale."
"Drinkability: The abv is high, limiting the drinkability. Outside of that, this is an exemplary beer from an unusual and unique style."
"This one really blew me away. I had been waiting a while to try it, as I didnt really want to throw down $35 for this one in the states. Luckily I found it at a Del Haize (A big Belgian supermarket) in Gent for only 8 euro or so. We had this with some wonderful orval cheese, corsendonk pate, and cantillon gueuze cooked mussels at my friends house in Antwerpen. Served chilled right from the freezer, the bottle popped with quite a force and poured out two flutes of wonderfully bubbly golden liquid, very reminiscent of champagne in presentation, method, and look. The aromas were all edible flowers, and spices, pretty much, not much malt or hop character at all, but it work. Tastes like 'eating flowers', as my friend said. Pretty much a spicy, flowery melange of happenings, like the sph cuvee des fleurs on crack, more carbonated, more boozy, and more flowery. Mouthfeel is spirtzy, dry, effervescent, and perfect. Drinkability is very good. This one is a real winner, I wish that the price point was lower in the US."
"Overall, I highly recommend it."
"The beer was bottled in 2002."
"Drinkability: Not something you can drink in any quantity; I appreciate but do not particularly enjoy the complexity; at this price I am one and done"
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"D- This beer is interesting. It has some qualities of highly carbonated malt liquor but then it has some qualities only found in some good wild beers. Definitely an original."
"This was my graduation gift to myself, knowing that I will probably never buy another bottle again. It has its own attractive qualities, but at the price and the status it has....meh. It's worth a shot at least once. Happy Happy Happy Happy."
"Pale yellow/golden/blonde sparkling colour with bubbles rising to the head. Creamy white large head with bubbly carbonation. Aroma is quite unlike any other beer I've tried; most noticeably apples, pepper and spices. Flavour is peppery, spicy (cinnamon?), candy-sweet and reminiscent of fresh sweet apples and pears. Later finishes with a yeasty banana taste and warming alcohol. Silky mouthfeel and bubbly carbonation. Rather drinkable considering the alcohol. Glad I was able to share this with a friend for his birthday."
"My overall reaction: Wow! What a fantastic and innovative brew! But is it really worth $25? Yes! Yes!"
"This beer is dangerously drinkable, and I because I was unable to convince the wife to consume as much as I had hoped, I will be suffering in the morning."
" This was worth the money. It seems best suited as a special occasion beer, or a substitute for champagne. Pairs especially well with this baby brie I'm eating right now."
"Overall, it is everything you would want in a Belgian pale ale and then some. For my money, though, it would be difficult to justify purchasing this one again instead of buying two 750 ml Tripel Karmeliets. But if you have the desire to try something different, and a spare Jackson in your pocket, give it a shotyou wont be disappointed."
"2002. Boozy and horse aroma. Little bit of head. Acidic taste well malted and intense. Smooth. $22 a bottle. Goes well with meat, but not fish was too much like white wine that I believe does not go with fish. Recommended instructions include time in the freezer."
"Now I have to say something about price point. I really enjoyed this beer, don't get me wrong, but I can't see returning to it at the price it goes for. That's not part of the numeric review itself, since that doesn't calculate in, but I don't see me ever buying it again, unless I see it much cheaper in Belgium some day."
"Even the bottle exudes a magnificent charm: elegant, dark and refined. Yes, it could be mistaken for a champagne bottle, but to see such a bottle with the heavenly word ""beer"" on it makes me bound with excitement. A loud pop and the cork is out, mushrooming and showing on the bottom the Bosteel logo. Wow, the little leaflet provided with the beer says ""high level of carbonation and abundant foam," and no kidding. The bottle literally foamed over and would not stop even after pouring 2 glasses in succession. It just kept foaming over through the neck. I had it stored on its side in the fridge the whole time, possibly the reason for this. In a fluted champagne glass this could easily pass for a champagne or sparkling wine--that is, except for the head. Imagine a picture-perfect champagne, but with a bright-white head that leaves lacing. The beer is sparkling and bubbly, a frosty nectarine colour with hues of golden honey. Aspirin white head and one which stays very well in a fluted glass, leaving speckled globs of lace. I also tried it in a chalice glass, and the difference was rather of note: the chalice glass held the cold temperature better, and the champagne glass had better head but seemed to warm the beer quicker. The aroma I found a little similar to Unibroue's Edition 2004, with the same minty and oaky aromas. Deus is definitely more complex however. Behind the oakiness and the light spicy smells, almost cinnamon-like, lurks a subtle but enjoyable tartness that is common to sparkling wines. The aroma to me is also quite yeasty in a way, not in the traditional sense though. This is more like a dustiness that plays with light fruits and faint alcohol. The malt is noticeable, lightly roasted. Vanilla and fresh grass notes, strong mint, and, oddly enough, sake: I get some of the rice-like notes from this as I smell. Grape-like smells too. The taste is quite strongly minty alcoholic, more like a good brandy than sparkling wine though. I get pineapple and rum tastes up front, along with solvent phenols and a crisp dryness, and the finish is quite dry indeed, but leaving notes of buttery malt and honey. In the middle are some almost vodka-like feels, strongly tinged with alcohol. The aftertaste also possesses vertmouth or sherry tastes. Lively carbonation, but perhaps not quite as much as you would expect. The beer feels effervescent at first but actually has some thickness to it. For 11.5%, this is dangerously drinkable--refreshing and cold and incredibly unique. Another excellent bridge-over for wine drinkers, and a style I wish was more readily available."
"It's pricey because you're paying for the beer to be shipped to France to be turned by the remueur, or riddler; aged; degorged; redosed; and corked (all of which I find to be complete nonsense in the modern world of DE filtration and carb stones...) - but it may still be worth it. Gather a few friends to try it and the price won't seems as much a factor. Appréciez la vie sans s'inquiète !"
"Opinion: This is a dangerously drinkable beer. Having the name ""Flanders"" on it made me instantly think that it may have a sour flavor, but this wasn't the case. I wouldn't say that I was disappointed about this, but it surprised me. The beer is really clean for Belgian standards, and reminds me of a spiced up Duvel as much as anything. It is a beer that is absolutely worth a try. The price was a bit steep at $27 a bottle, but when you consider that this is a 750mL of ~12%ABV beer, you can split the price and entertain a few friends with it. Nice!"
"Fantastic stuff, well worth the $20CAN I spent on it, I'm glad I held out to sample it when I was in the right mood and didn't rush it. There is nothing overpowering or aggressive about this beer whatsoever, it is subtle and refined and has it all in the right places to the proper degree in my opinion. Even the abv% isn't apparent within the taste, it is smooth and isn't very noticable until halfway through the bottle when it becomes apparent within the bloodstream. I have many personal things to celebrate this day, and I'm very happy to have had this Brut Des Flanders to enjoy it with. I'd definitely pick up more if I came across it again, even though this was one of the last bottles available."
"I would recommend this Belgium ale to someone who has tried many of this type to fully appreciate what its up against. Did I think it was worth the price? Yes. Would I try it again? Possibly, but I there are too many other beers out there and life is too short to try them all."
"Corked and caged Cuvee Prestige 2002 bottle pours a bright golden orange with a huge foamy off white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Aromas of ginger bread, lemons and spices, fruity pear spicy ginger, nutmeg, cloves and pepper flavors. Full bodied with a super carbonated tingling mouthfeel, finishes spicy, alcohol well hidden. Defiantly worth a try even at the $23.99 price tag."
"Don't know if I'd spend the money again, but it is an experience I'm glad I had."
"Music: The Smiths  The Queen is Dead."
"Exquisit enough to justify the price if you ask me, but not tasty enough for me personally to buy again. An intresting effort though in a style I should revisit!"
"Drinkability. Even considering the price I would want this again and again. So subtle and complex.. The comparison to fine champagne is on the money. I think I will get another couple bottles just to hold onto for special occasions. Would go great with anything champagne goes with and more. Would make an outstanding Apperitif. Highly recommended."
"750 ml brownish gren bottle. $24.99. Label says 2002 vintage. Most expensive beer I have drank at home to date. This is a beer to enjoy with a group. Tough to consume by yourself, but very interesting, my palate will never be the same from the flavors and the carbonation."
"I really didn't care for this beer at first, but I got to where I thought it was okay by the end of the bottle. That's all, though. Defintely nothing special, in my opinion. I'm glad that I tried it, but it is nowhere, I repeat NOWHERE near being worth the $30 that I paid for this bottle. Even for half that price, I wouldn't buy another. I appreciate the process and the labor that goes into making this beer, but end the end it's still a flower-ridden, perfumey brew with an overpowering alcohol flavor. At 11.5% abv, I'm glad that beerlovergirl helped me with this bottle, though it put her under the table (hehe)."
"A good bitterness in the aftertaste, not exceptional, but persistent. Well amalgamated with the moscato-like sweetness. Again the freshness of eucalyptus."
"2002. Served ice cold into a makeshift flute. Pours crystal clear pale straw color with a volcanous head that rises like champagne; yet more soft and pillowy, and leaves exquisite lacing. Honeysuckle blossoms and numerous other flowery, peppery, and dusty notes amongst a sweet malt background. Spring-like in its bouquet. Very lively carbonated, which is the key to its drinkability. It has a honeyed mouthfeel with prickly notes of carbonic acid. Dry, yet malty and sweet. Fruity, (apple, pear) with peppery alcohol notes. Some musty qualities about it, with hints of spelt-like huskiness. A delightful treat. Who says fizzy yellow beer is for wussies?"
"This beer has to be judged in context of its cost. The bottle set me back $35. I saved it for a special occaion (getting a job with my state's Attorney General's office). After a great dinner capped by Maudite on tap, I came home to this in my fridge. I opened it and foam came gushing out. After it settle to a drinkable level, I quaffed and wafted. The smell was much like a saison, the taste much like a earthy tripel. Nothing in particular jumped out at me. Maybe I was expecting too much, but this just didn't deliver."
"Medium to full bodied, good drinkability but it's not going to draw many repeat buys at almost $35 a bottle."
"Enjoyed as a 2oz sample at the Belgian Beer Fest 2004. Truly an excellent beer. But worth $40 a pop? Maybe... Pours a very light, yellow-clear color. Excellent head retention. Carbonation was predominant. Smell is potent, sweet, and alcoholic. My fellow BA Charthepirate finds this beer exceptionally balanced; yet I find the biting alcoholic taste to be an overall detractor to the experience. Regardless, this beer puts forth an excellent display with cinnamon flavors prominent and a floral background. Aftertaste dissipates nearly immediately. Overall, delicious, but pricey."
"Comments  My special occasion for popping this cork was review #1,300. What a treat to find a new beer-style (new to me) after so many reviews. Ive seen the bottle in the stores before but would have never thought of buying it was it not for the strong rating on BeerAdvocate. A great beer and a great site!"
"It's fine Belgium brewing meets champagne - it's too bizarre to describe but the taste will be unforgettable. The experience was well worth the hefty price tag, but not one I could afford to drink week in and week out. I'm not convinced a high price tag automatically suggests it's a premium brew, in fact, several expensive beers I've tried I'm still trying to figure out what the ""hoopla's"" all about. Deus is an exception. You'll never find a beer anywhere else this unique in texture, smell, and taste."
"Perhaps I didn't let this one chill down enough, but when I popped the cork it was geyserville for a good two minutes. It finally calmed down and I was able to get a decent pour. Very active carbonation, translucent gold colour with a foamy 2 inch thinck head that calmed down to a quarter inch. Champagne meets Belgium in the aroma; vanilla, clove, merengue, yeast, green apple, candied orage, spice. It's worth noting that if you follow serving intructions as written on the bottle and serve this chilled to 2-4° C the flavor is very crisp, floral, and clean. A plethora of flavors will come out of nowhere as this warms up. Sweet malt, honey, apricot, citrus all make an appearance along with a subtle spiciness. The feel of this is refreshing thoughout with a very fine mousse/bubble structure/carbonation. Beautiful and highly drinkable."
"A great beer, well worth the $45 paid, and a brew that could easily be drank inplace of champagne, any time, even with an abv of 11.5%."
"Got this one for a birthday present, and like all expensive brews, I wanted to make sure I had a special occasion to drink it. Then again, according to the film Sideways, when you drink it, it is a special occasion. Anyway, had to have it in a champagne flute and I was well rewarded. It poured with a huge white, fluffy head and a light golden body with constant carbonation movement. Quite entertaining really. A lovely floral and clove-like nose precedes the indulgence. The mouthfeel is peppery and malty, but is not the essence of the beer. The lifeline, in my humble opinion, is the great marriage of the floral and sugary essences. Truly wonderful. There also is a splash of orange zest that thusly adds to the complexity. The finish perks up with an alcohol presence that is the foreground of a lemony/orange and malty background. Just a world class beer."
"The body on this beer is exceptional. It just overpowers your mouth with its size."
"This beer was quite pricey, but well worth the money as it was a style that I really wanted to try. Very impressive!"
"Not an everyday drink based on flavors and the price ($24) but a highly worthwhile experience."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 750ml dark green glass champagne bottle with cork and a wire cage and foil closure. Served in champagne flutes, though I suspect that, due to the massive head volume, a Belgian goblet is a better choice."
"Golden champagne in appearance with heavy carbonation. Aroma is a blend of herbs, spice, and medicinal antiseptic. Flavor is similar, very dry not too tart yet malty in flavor. Not very much body to speak of. This is a very unique beer, not what I was expecting."
"Overall Impression: For me, this was; too expensive, too dry, too champagne like. I dont like champagne, but this smells better than any champagne Ive had. Im going to be generous on my score for this section because the beer is definitely within style, its just a style I can see myself not liking."
"This is extremely unique and very good."
"Now, this is a beer worth its premium price!!! I can see why they call this biere de champagne, because it reminds me a lot of the champagnes I've had in my life; a hint of sweetness (this one isn't quite a brut) and a nice character. However, I love the barley character instead of the grapes! Certainly, in any situation I have to serve champagne (hey, I'm not married yet!!), this would be one I would put there, since this is as good as wine champagnes that are twice as much. This is one that I certainly will have again, once my pockets deepen that is!!!!"
"Clear yellow-gold in color. Huge volumes of carbonation swirling around. Strangely, the whitish head is quite robust, lasting an eternity. Amazing lacing of the glass. Aromas tickle the nostrils. Sorta like perfume crossed with an array of citrus. Flavor is superb. It's hard to convince yourself that this is beer your are drinking. Crackly carbonation enhances the drenching of the tastebuds from the sugary sweetness up front, smoothing out to a more pronounced peppery/hop bite in the middle, and finishes with a honey-glazed orange spice zip. Dry? Hell yes. Simply an amazing creation."
"2001 bottle. Hold the foam, batman! Geez, this thing foams almost as bad as an Adam Beer from Hair of the Dog. Lots of puffy white head that sticks around. Takes forever to pour a glass. Nice golden color. The aroma is spicy and yeasty with a lot of lemon character. The flavor is very spicy and yeasty as well - as I expect most good Belgians to be. Has a crisp, lemony zing. I couldn't detect the alcohol very well until after drinking it, so it's pretty well masked. Great drinkability."
"Well, overall this beer is very different, definitely champagne like. Would I get this again? probably not at $23 a bottle, but it is worth a try."
"Served in a Deus tulip this poured a pale yellow color and makes a tall frothy white head. Aroma is of citrus fruit and fresh cut flowers. Very complex flavor with notes of alcohol, lemon, honey, and bread dough. Medium bodied, bubbly carbonation and finishes rather dry. I enjoyed it, although it was quite pricey."
"What an intriguing beer. This beer poured a nice transparent golden color with just tons of light fluffy head everywhere. We had to pour and wait multiple times. The nose was very tart, almost gueuze-like, with lots of lemony citrus in there. The taste is fairly different from the nose. Theres some of hte lemon in there, but there was something that reminded me of a soapyness, but it wasn't bad. I wish I knew what it was that I was tasting. The mouthfeel was very crisp, moderately thick and very sprightly. For a big beer, the alcohol was not apparent at all, except to my head. I was glad this was split 3 ways. A huge thanks to clvand0 for sharing this gem."
"Sweet and candy-like, with many passion fruit notes along with notes of black peppers, honey, melon and peach. The finish is very dry. Poorly hidden alcohol. Not all its cracked up to be. I'm glad I got this for free."
"Thick foamy head, denser than for champagne and lasting, which is good for the appearance and for the mouthfeel. A crazy level of carbonation is observable in the clear golden color body. Fruity smell of sweet peaches and a vendanges tardives aspect (should I write this review in French?). Yeasty and doughy, but aired and subtle. The taste is reminiscent of a fine white wine but sweeter and nicely fruity with very light herbal notes of hops and citric notes of grapefruit and orange peel. The mouthfeel is round and not as dry as for champagne, which I found great. Full, easy to drink thanks to the high carbonation. Nicely chewy with some interesting notes of liquorice in the end and hints of cloves and cinammon. Great mouthfeel and drinkability. A very original brew, that's definitely worth a try."
"I am happy that the exorbitant price equated to oneof the finest beers I have ever tried."
"Pours a five-finger+ white bubbly head leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Strong carbonation - pour slow. Medium bodied. Nose is sweet and spicey. Starts and finishes sweet with spices very smooth. The high ABV is not really noticeable. I had to pause before buying one of these but it was for our anniversary soooo $35.00 for a 750ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma. To be honest most Belgian beers are good and you can get an equally good one for $30 less."
"Bottle provided by Kimchee in our tasting with tiggmtl, martint and oakes Appearance is neat. highly carbonated pale blond with a generous white head. Aroma is mineralic, nice at first, but becoming dull and off as it warms, I dont know what to do with this. They say to drink this cold, Ill ensure to try it cold with a next bottle, but for now, something like a cleaning product develops in the warming aroma, something like the yellow of the egg too. Sweet powder sugar is added to the melting with a leafy and spicy counterparts that would actually appear well blended without the phenomenon stated above. In mouth, theres a spritzy dryness, but not as intense as a champaigns and theres definitely still lots of sweetness getting through. Lemony flavors, moderate alcohol, but still well hidden for 11.5%. Theres a slight bitterness that seems slightly off and once again, as it warms, theres a dusty plastic flavor I dont enjoy at all. Nevertheless its extremely original, flowery and initially pleasant, so I assume this bla bla about drinking it cold is to be taken seriously. Mouthfeel is fabulous though, indeed champaigny, heavily carbonated, slightly astringent. Im definitely not buying another bottle though, as good as it looks."
"I've paid more for porn movies. And this is that same sort of gratification, only for other senses."
"An A+ in my book"
"it was good, but the drinkability is bad because of the overcarbonation."
"Golden straw in color. Thick big bubbles, with a medium thick lace. Flowery nose of spring and spice and you can definatly pick up a slight saffron nose. Rich,epperfecent?, semi-sweet mouthfeel but only upfront then tapers back to light flowers on your tongue, definatly better than last years."
"Well, the question lately has been variations of ""Is this beer worth XX dollars?"" or ""How much would you pay for Deus?"". This beer is worth the $20-25 for celebrating a big occasion (birthday, anniversary, etc). It has one of the most unique flavors I've come across yet. That said, I still wouldn't want it all the time, even if I could afford it."
"The beer as is emigrates from the 750ml green corked bottle to my Belgian Triple glass a luminous and limpid gold color, the head Brobdingnagian in size, effervescent, and bright white in color, the lace as the head dissipates a velum like curtain to obscure the glass. The aroma of over ripe granny smith apples, earthy, sweet malt at the back, somewhat acerbic with the start sweet and nice malt presence, the finish is ferine in its acidity, the hops inconspicuous with the aftertaste desert dry, slightly vinous and quite long lasting. Id say its better than most of the blonde Belgians Ive tasted, and well worth a sample, and the 11.5 percent ABV seems well hidden accept for the light tummy warming sensation, but good as it may be, I can think of many Belgians Id rather spend $30.00 on."
"Duvel for $5.99 a Bottle! I LOVE Trader Joes!"
"You said yellow slow didn't you? Say it again."
"This reminded me a bit of a biere de garde I once had. It's a nice gold body with a good white head and streaming effervescence. The aroma is strong and sharp with an aroma that reminds me of lemonheads (not lemon since the candy doesn't really taste like lemons). It's almost like the beer has herbs added with a faint herbal nature to the aroma and flavor. It's fairly dry and the malt is pilsner-like."
"This is a classic Belgian ale with an identity crisis. It is a pale golden ale with a tight foamy head and flavors typical of many Belgian ales. But there also are hints of grape, apple and peach from the long bottle conditioning. Hints of plum and a little grassiness also come through."
"Well this has certainly lived up to the hype. This is a killer alternative to Champagne, and even at this price it is a steal. You can't find Champagen at this price that will compare to the complexity of this beer."
"Best brew I've had in the last year I think."
"we were sitting in the pub one night and saw this pricey buy on the list...well being curious ones we went up to the bar and asked if this beer truly was worth it's weight. Instead of a yeah or nay....we were given this glorious description of wonderous champagne style beer and it's crisp excellence...we were sold and headed back to the table with our champagne style beer in it's large bottle. This is a fun beer...that is what comes to mind. It's very light and effervescent with a zillion nice biting bubbles. It was crisp and clean and well like champagne mated with a nice pale ale. Nice little lemon and slight floral taste but not over powering. This isn't an everyday beer, but I would definitely recommend it for a classy change to New Years champagne, or special occasion."
"This beer is definitely pushing the envelope, I think. It's really unlike any other drink I've had. The alcohol is quite strong and the spicy/herby flavor is either interesting or off-putting. For me, interesting. It makes an intriguing substitute for champagne, but I'd still choose any good, ""standard"" Belgian ale over this hybrid."
"Wow. This beer looks like champagne inside and out with a golden yellow color and hundreds of small, tight, white bubbles. The nose is herbal with some faint apple and spice. The taste is unlike any beer Ive ever tasted. There is a tea/minty undertone and body deceivingly thin and drinkable. Bought at Beverage Bistro.com"
"Looking at this from a homebrewer's perspective, I'm going to clone this puppy."
"Wonderfully drinkable, Deus serves as a great apertif. With its complexity, liveliness and champagne-like appeal, this is a special beer. Worthy of the hype and a joy to savor."
"A delicate yet potent brew with a mouthfeel of very light syrup. Smooth and sharp, easy to drink. Impressions are of a fine white Belgian ale/champaign hybrid."
"This beer poured a very light golden color and formed a nice foamy white head that left circular lace as it slowly subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. The aroma is a heavy mix of citrus, spices and almost candy like elements. The flavor is of citrus and a slight butter aspect to it. This butter like texture is also apparent in the finish which is quite sprite due in part to the carbonation. Is it worth the 20 dollars I spent on it, of course not. But then many of the Dogfish are overpriced in my opinion and why should they have all the fun with experimentation. If these Belgians wanted to do a Champagne style, great for them. Now just make something in a saner price range."
"I humbly bow before the beer gods, for they have graced us with another great one here. And many thanks to Putnam for sharing some of this treasure."
"To sum up: this beer is like butter-flavored mousse that melts into a complex of earthy, honey-ripe fruit flavors."
"Other: After the brewing process is complete and the beer is bottled (with yeast added to the bottle for another fermentation), this beer is then shipped to the Champagne region of France to undergo the full methode champagnoise (Sp?). The bottles are positioned neck down and allowed to remain that way for long enough for the yeast to settle at the bottom of the neck. Then the bottle is dipped in liquid nitrogen, the portion of the neck that contains the yeast plug is broken off. The bottle is then recorked and caged, then sent out to your loving arms. Above is paraphrased from Steven Beaumont's little spiel about this beer."
"First, we moved this brew form the fridge to the freezer to get it cold like they said on the bottle. After 1/2 hour it was removed, uncorked, with a big pop, and poured. It poured a large head of creamy fine white bubbles and a very carbonated weak straw yellow body. The head leaves a clinging vine lacing. Its aroma was a bit different and mild. Neither malt nor hop. Almost kind of skunky. My first thought of the taste was yuck! A second sip revieled a bit more character. It was very spicey with clove and licorice. After a few sips, the burps from the fizzy carbonation began to set in. I then let it warm up as I continued to finish the mug I had poured with well over a half a bottle left. At this point, I had rated it 4,3,6,2,12 a 2.7 overall. After letting it warm up, it did not get any better. Complex it is, but after the Rochefort 8, we had earlier, its really hard to live up to it. This is not a brew I would reccommend, especially for the $30 it cost me for 1 bottle."
"First of all, in my opinion, this brew is way overpriced to say the least because I do not feel it is all that great of a brew. It poured a large white invigorating foamy head and there was not that much lacing on the sides of my glass. The aroma was a combination of being spicy, fruity and a slight clove aroma. There was carbonation observed and the body was a pale yellow. The taste of this brew was fizzy and tingly which is not much to my liking when it comes to taste. I was not impressed to say the least and the cost is way out of line in my personal opinion. Even if I really, really liked this brew, I would still say that it is way overpriced."
"The bottle blew like a land mine, covered the sink and one side of the fridge. Hazy bright peach from the final yeast pitch (the 4th), head flattens to less than an 1/8 of an inch after the spurting released the primary carbonation. Decent string laces. Spicy aroma, huge amounts of pumpkin pie spice and associated sweetness. A little bit of model paint phenolic whiffs, as well. Tea-like and steeped in associated flavors, clove and ginger, lots of nutmeg predominate with a black pepper bite up front. Finishes with a bitter date-like and apricot liquor cordial impression and a fully rounded aftertaste. Decided body overall. Sense of alcohol and huge amounts of reminders of the sip. Survives low temperatures very well. Very nice, complex without an obvious hop...big. Wish the bottle didn't blow (I may have jostled it too much), I missed out on about 1/4 of the volume here. Minnesota, we should all take advantage of this beer's availability, the distributor is shaky and stores like Thomas Liquors only have six (well, five) on hand."
"If ever a beer was lascivous, this is it. Time for that cold shower now."
"All in all, a beautiful, smooth, sparkling ale that I enjoyed very much, but will rarely buy again, because of the price. There's too many comparable brews at 1/3 the price."
