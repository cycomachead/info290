"Kind of like a wine cooler. Reminds me of Smirnoff Ice. A very interesting historical brew."

"This brew is a champaigne style brewed ""wine"" served as a way for the brewery to offer a wine like product without requiring a special wines sales license. The brew is very good. It is lighter than a pils and has flavor of peach and eldberry, not exactly a ""malt"" beverage like a zima, a more balanced flavor and certainly crisper. This will mix with almost anything except milk products. Served cold from the tap in a fluted glass it is a tasty complement to a light meal. The feel is light to the mouth, no bite or sting on the palette, easy to quaff and does not sit heavy once consummed."
