The ""mixed feelings"" I have about it have to remain at that, because I think it is interesting, but to have once per price tag. If subsituting as a beer-lover's ""champagne", personally, I would go with the other ""brut"" from this brewery. There is more cocoa, that might appeal to some in this, but it is at the expense of the citric qualities that is replaced by a grassiness that just doesn't meld together as well with this one. Also, the little difference in abv shows the more with this one. Very good, but...more liked for uniqueness than actual pleasure.

Alcohol was present throughout and lingering somewhat, but it stayed restrained and balanced. Mild chocolate and milky character throughout. Carbonation was very high, a little too high for me.

The loud pop while pulling out the cork was quite a bit like opening a Champagne, but the Burgundy colored liquid with a large foamy head looked nothing like it. It was an impressive looking beer nonetheless. I'd almost call is a cross between St. Bernardus Abt. 12 and Duvel. The smell was quite a fruit barrage, led mainly by red apples, and followed by cherry and strawberry. The taste was quite a bit like a Quadrupel but without a lot of the intense alcohol. The fruits detected by the nose were here with some raisins thrown in. Earthy and spicy hop presence was detectable. Amazingly easy to drink for such a big beer with a creamy and dry texture that just glided down with each sip. Felt quite a bit lighter in the mouth than it really was, which i think was quite an intentional effect. Much better than the Brut Reserve in my opinion, as this one tries not to imitate something else, and is a better drink as a result.","rajendra82","Apr 03, 2008"

Better than the lighter version, but still - this emperor is also wearing no clothes.","dedrinker","Jul 24, 2006"
3.23,-21.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"wonderful packaging and presentation, but I miss the point of this beer. the taste greatly underperforms the nose. I was also unimpressed with ttheir normal 'brut' beer, so maybe it is a style issue.","dogfooddog","Jun 24, 2006"
4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Vintage Reserve 2003 on label. Poured cold from the fridge into a goblet, probably too cold as the taste livened a bit when it warmed up. A very light and airy tan head rose high in the class as the brown and tan highlights swirled. Light smell, pleasant. High carbonation evident on tongue with malty taste that strengthens with the temperature. Overall, a pleasant beer, fun to drink, and well crafted. But, like Deus, not a beer I'd travel a long ways for or get more than one bottle at the store. Fun for me since it's my first bottle from the Rare Beer Club since Minnesota has been added to the list of acceptable states.","FightingEntropy","Apr 24, 2006"
3.88,-5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"75 cl. bottle. Dark color with a creamy some brownish head that lingers for a good while. Aroma of chocolate, dried plums and spices. Body lighter than I expected. Taste of chocolate, champagne mouthfeel, Jerez wine, some honey. After a while it leaves a brandy feeling. Not the best of the Malheur, imo.","janubio","Apr 01, 2006"
3.88,-5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Dark burgundy color. Small, compacted, light mocha colored head. Lightly aromatic, strange, funky aroma with dark, roasty tones. Hazelnut flavors abound with light chestnut flavors along with roasty and toasted tones and a touch of raisins. Well hidden alcohol and nice mouthfeel.","Crosling","Jan 18, 2006"
3.73,-9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall: One of the first brews I had at the Festival from a bottle freshly opened in front of me. Strange one this though, maybe Im the party pooper here but I didnt really care for this one at all or understand all the fanfare that surrounds it. Its a quality brew but a tad bland for a 12% brew and the chocolate aspect felt muddy. Over-rated? There I said it.","TheLongBeachBum","Dec 18, 2005"
4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"I forgot to write down the vintage, but the bottle looked quite old as the ripped label was showing lots of signs of aging. Aroma is heavy with chocolate malts and Belgian yeasty notes. Hints of dark fruit as well. Crimson hued brown/black color with a frothy tan head. Very concentrated chocolate malt flavors in the fore followed by a hint of raisin and cherry sweetness and leading into a slightly dry and funky finish. The chocolate and dark fruit flavors linger nicely in the aftertaste.","Jredner","Nov 22, 2005"

4.02,-2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"BB 15-12-2006. Good presance withyellowish head and a darkbrown/black beer. Nose is very fruity giving mostly stawberry, cherry and vanill. Next to that good maltyness and roast. Taste is sweet, hoppy, roasty, lots of alcohol, chocolate and malts altogether litle bombastic. Very carbonated makes it litle fresher but sweetness is also very present in mouthfeel. Good beer but IMO not the best of the malheurrange, this mostly cause of the IMO overdone sweetness of the brew. The bubles& alcohol rise to your head though!","paterlodie","Dec 16, 2004"

4.48,9.3,5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"26oz: Dark chocolate brown, superb beige head is eternally lasting, foamy, full of subtle lacing. Enormous chocolate malt aroma, predictably tart, yet somehow, they managed to find a fit between this and saison-like haystack scents. I found the balance to be remarkable for such an experiment, delicate herbal and flowery undertones together add tremendous depth. Rich bitter/tart chocolate, actually this may be tarter than it appears, yet I didnt find any annoyance in the marriage with the roastiness. No trace of alcohol in the aroma, remarkable feature by itself, but in such a complex blend, you dont get to spend much time thinking about that. Add to this a killer expanding in bubbles incredibly smooth foamy mouthfeel and you know where your 25$ went. I still think I prefer the regular Brut, but then again, I tend to prefer blonde Belgians to darker ones. I can recognize a killer recipe though and this one gave me a hard time to find places to give less than perfect scores! Astonishingly unique. A sipper that you couldnt drink too much of while being an incarnation of greatness! de Landtsheer can brew people, my rating may be a mess, but take that for granted. Cheers to my pal muzzlehatch for this.","Rastacouere","Jul 24, 2004"
4.63,12.9,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Cola brown brew with an active, billowing tan froth. Cherry liqueor and a certain plant-like freshness are backnotes to coccoa powder and a musty yeast quality. Some chocolate, some oak in the flavor. Lively and mildly bitter, this is a very natural-feeling beer with floral, plant, and natural sweeteners presenting themselves. This has a dry finish, and the alcohol is well-hidden. This looks like it should be an overly sweet alcohol bomb whose depth is entirely based on esters. Not the case. This a dry, complex ale that's remarkably drinkable.","marburg","Jul 12, 2004"

The aroma has a good bit of fruitiness and a little spice, but the chocolate, while there, really isnt there enough to justify the American name for this beer. This one seemed a little lacking compared to beers that came before and after it at the tasting.","aracauna","0"
