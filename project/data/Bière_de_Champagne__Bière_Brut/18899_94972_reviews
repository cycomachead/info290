"It felt like a mix of a sweet Belgian Strong Ale with a Tripel with relatively a decent amount of herbal hops (which is welcome and balanced). Although this had a very good execution (it might not be short of DeuS), it is not my preferred style and I usually prefer less sweet beers."
"Lighter orange/yellow in colour, voluminous white head with fantastic retention and lacing. Bretty and tropical fruits on the nose with some champagne qualities, has some similar notes to the Mikkeller Sauvin Brut. Bright citrus and tropical character on the palate, wood, lower than champagne carbonation and fantastically gentle carbonation. My top beer at Mondiale."
