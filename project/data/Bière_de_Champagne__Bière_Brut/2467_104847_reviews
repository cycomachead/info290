"Didn't expect this. Really nice for its dirt cheap price. Probably because it was ""expired"". Nope, no problems with that here."

"Bottle: Poured a light dirty beige color ale with a large foamy head with OK retention and some good lacing. Aroma of pongy rustic malt with light tart undertones is quite sublime. Taste is also a great mix of rustic malt with dry Brett notes with light funky yeast and some pungent notes also noticeable. Body is quite full with super great carbonation. A perfect mix of complexity and drinkability which appears to be a common thread form this brewery."
"The taste is initially good, but grows tiresome. Fruits and yeast clash a bit. I would have slotted this under the Biere de Champagne style."
"If you like the sound of Belgian-style Pale Ale and dry Prosecco then Panil Enhanced (Final) is the beer for you (and, to be sure, it's one of the only such beers in existence). Me, personally, I liked it a lot - it's nearly worth the stains it left on my kitchen wall. Considering it costs only as much as the cheapest sparkling wine - and is far more special - consider this a 'must buy'."
"O - A great twist on the traditional Belgian pale, offering up a nice tart flavour that pairs nicely, but the volcano aspect was rather disappointing. I'm wondering if the bottle would've been ok had I let it warm a bit since I've known some beers whose heavy carbonation settled as it warmed up. In any case, a worthy brew and thoroughly enjoyed what was left of the bottle."

"O: Overall I quite like it. Not a typical style but a nice use of wine yeast, though almost falls too much into being like a wine, even if I would assume there is no grapes in it."
