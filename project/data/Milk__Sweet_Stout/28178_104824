4.4,0.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Dark black with a thin, dark brown head.  Just a little bit of lacing.  Smell is complex, with a strong vanilla and oak character, and hints of chocolate and brown sugar.  Taste was semi-sweet chocolate and some hints of coffee, followed by a strong vanilla wave concluding in an oaky alcohol burn.  A little bit thin for a 13% stout, but the taste definitely lingers and coats the tongue.  This definitely lived up to its billing.  An outstanding barrel aged stout.","OneEye78","Mar 17, 2015"

Next comes some fudgy brownie notes that pair nicely with he barrel notes. The taste is much like the nose with heavy vanilla notes paired with fudge and cocoa. The barrel aging has really smoothed the base out and has intensified the chocolate notes. My only slight issue with the beer is the body doesn't hold up to the big flavors. The flavors are there no doubt, but it is just a little on the thin side. Overall, I like where things are going for pipeworks, will be excited to see what other barrel aged brews are on the horizon.","homebrew311","Apr 26, 2014"

Taste is rich and intense: bourbon-soaked raisins and dates, creamy chocolate, and lots of burnt brown sugar. But the barrel character tends to overwhelm those more subtle flavors. It's a milk stout, so mouthfeel is on the thinner side but not too thin: smooth and lightly creamy. Overall, this one suffers from the overpowering barrel character, and all the flavors of the original Jones Dog get snuffed out rather than enhanced.","blankenhoney","Apr 04, 2014"

Taste is more of the same. Very sweet and very chocolatey. Bourbon and barrel are there too, but the sweetness takes center stage. Full bodied and viscous. Very low carbonation. Creamy smooth.","Florida9","Nov 18, 2013"
