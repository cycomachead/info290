The aroma is big and enveloping; full of deep fruity smells. The beers taste is what one might expect of a sip of dessert wine, with dry, burnt-coffee notes on the back end. This is a big stout, and I imagine it would be hard to distinguish from many imperials; quite an accomplishment for a 7.5% libation. Mouthfeel lives up to the name.","Altrurian","Mar 11, 2015"

3.55,-8.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.25,"12oz bottle poured into nonic. This beer is opaque black with a quarter inch of light brown head that settles to a thin ring. Minimal lacing. The aroma is carried by roasted malts and coffee, plus creamy lactose sugar and a hint of milk chocolate. It has a subdued vanilla cream sweetness that rolls in after a strong wave of coffee, molasses, and roasted malt bitterness. Medium-light body and a thin mouthfeel that are disappointing; soft carbonation and a long roasty finish that are quite nice.","SierraFlight","Feb 19, 2015"

Taste is of chocolate that is slightly sweet, with some maltiness in the background. Reminds me of Boulder Beers' Shake, only this is it's older more intense brother. Imperial Stoutish without the coffee nor the higher alcohol. I could drink a number of these very easily.

It looked like high viscosity engine oil, 40-weight, as it did its pseudo-cascade and then formed a finger of dense, deep-brown head with excellent retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44) allowing zero light penetration. THIS is their interpretation of a Cream Stout?!? Nose was rich and chocolaty, more towards dark chocolate with a charcoal smokiness. Mouthfeel was big, full and creamy and the taste was incredibly smoky, which while appealing to me, is stylistically incorrect. Why would they make Fore and this? I left a bit in the bottle so as to be able to stir up the lees for an additional pour, but it really did not change things by much, except to intensify the smokiness, if that is possible. Finish was bitter, smoky, dry, all of which adds up to something other than a Milk/Sweet Stout.

Beautiful aroma of both dark and milk chocolate plus roasted dark and chocolate malts. The whole chocolate spectrum, with vanilla and coffee tones lightly riding on the malts. The lactose and silky sweetness in more pronounced in the flavour, which is very suitable for the style but might be challenging to enjoy more than one in a sitting. Nice coffee and hop bitterness to the finish which has a pleasing bite and stops it from becoming cloying.","hopsolutely","Oct 06, 2013"

Aromas of of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, char, coffee, cream, toffee, smoke, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with nice complexity and balance of big roasted flavors with moderate cream sweetness. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, light char, cream, toffee, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Light coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, light char, cream, toffee, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark roasted flavors with moderate cream sweetness; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice cream stout. Very well balanced with extremely robust roasted flavors and moderate sweetness; and very smooth to sip on.

Very light body for a cream stout and not nearly sweet enough, the bitterness of the roasted malts and hops drowned out the sweetness a cream stout should have.

The aroma consists mostly of coffee notes, with sweet cream, oatmeal, and a hint of chocolate. The flavor opens very sweetly of vanilla and creme, but gives way to some bitter hops, light tobacco, and bread crust. The finish has very 'charred,' ashy, and burnt characteristics to it. For the mouth feel, it's very light... the ABV is felt slightly on the way down. Pleasant, but the appearance (head) and finish could use some improvement.","Neorebel","Mar 02, 2013"

Poured pitch black with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, subtle roasted malt, and slight cream. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, cream, subtle coffee, and subtle smoke. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The aroma on this one really didn't get me excited about this one very much. However, the flavor proved to be quite nice and complex. I really like the smoke aspect I picked up on as it was definitely a first I have gotten in this style. A well done brew, but could use a few tweeks to be excellent.","thagr81us","Oct 13, 2011"

3.8,-2.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured this brew into a Cheers Dimpled mug, not really sure why but I liked the way it looked. The beer is very black in color, solid bubbling brown colored head on top. The lacing is nice on this brew. The smell of the beer has a lot of roasted burnt aromas coming off of it along with some lactose sourness on the nose. The taste of this really does have a creamy flavor upfront and in the back it dries out into a bitter burnt toast flavor. The mouthfeel is a pretty thick which I found nice. Overall it's a pretty good tasting stout.","Knapp85","Jul 12, 2011"

Enjoyed my beer but felt it was a little bit overly roasted, alcohol was well hidden.

Nice, but would be much better with a bit more of a lasting head. Very nice aroma. Roasty, chocolaty, and mildly sweet. Very smooth and The taste is a bit of a letdown after the great aroma. More of an acidic roastyness which overwhelms any chocolate that is present in the aroma. Also a bit of coffee flavor which is a nice addition. Not a ton of sweetness either, which is surprising for an 8% milk stout. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side with a good amount of carbonation. Very nice beer, a very good offering by dark horse.","Agold","Jun 30, 2011"
4.15,6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5," The flavor of Too is very pleasant it seems to combine the sweetness and caramel maltiness with some mild roasted and toast tastes. The flavor of the malt never seems to get cloying and the beer reminds me of sweetened coffee with some silky and creamy tinges that make the bitterness and alcohol levels seem very tame. I like how the mild burnt sugar taste lingers in the backrground adding complexity to the sweet and caramel taste. The beer finishes as it starts semi-dry and fresh. I feel this is a great example of the style -a pretty tasty stout in general, not overly sweet and has nice flavor overall. This is highly drinkable and I recommend trying it if you have the chance.","Slatetank","Jun 25, 2011"

It's a turn off. The flavor is strange too. There's a lot of smoke and this weird spin on lactic acid. It kind of has this burnt bacon aspect to it as well.

There is a whole lot of roastiness in this stout's flavor profile - maybe bordering on having too much of a roasted character for the style. Slightly above a medium bodied stout, average carbonation, and slightly dry which was a bit unexpected.

Taste is all coffee and with significant warming some vanilla and faint chocolate come out and dance. Coffee bordering on espresso.

3.97,2.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"VDubb thinks I'll like this one, so let's find out how right he is. It pours a straight obsidian topped by merely a few layers of brown bubbles. The nose comprises molasses, roasted malts, light coffee, cinnamon, and some blackened biscuits. The taste follows, but with a slim undertow of vanilla, though this is soon drowned out by the more sinister notes. The body is a heavy medium, with a moderate carbonation and a decently smooth feel. Overall, a very nice, roasty stout; a little light on the ""cream"" aspect, but rather tasty nonetheless. Those Dark Horse folks can make a mean stout.","TMoney2591","Jul 27, 2010"

Initially produces a finger of darkly tanned head that quickly cracks and fades to just a thin lace on top of this beer. Dark roasty aroma has some scents of coffee and chocolate blended with a bit of citrus fruitiness and then a slight note of sweetness in the backend. Taste is roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, minor citrus hops and a nice warming alcohol bite. Finishes with some dry bitter chocolate and burnt grain left lingering in the mouth. It has a medium feel and high amount of carbonation which is a little distracting. This is probably the least sweet of any milk/sweet stout I have ever had and I can honestly say that I like it.

Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit chewy and coating with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all and it's smooth. The 8% ABV isn't very noticable at all, you'd think you were drinking a beer that wasn't quite as strong as it really is. I thought this was a good overall brew.

Full bodied and rich, this one coats the mouth as it rolls over the tongue. Chewy and well carbonated, this beer is pretty smooth and drinkable. No real noticeable traces of alcohol.

Coffee, dried fruit, toast, and earth are present. Drying hops finish off this brew with floral character. Flavors develop more as the beer warms.

The beer is not really sweet, but the smoky cream flavor dominates. gradually other roasted malt notes creep through, but the dominant flavor is smoke. Could have done more to balance out the roastiness with more caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, but not as rich as some cream stouts (i.e. Bells).

3.75,-3.6,4,4,4,2.5,3.5,"Pours an incredibly dark color, this one rivals the One in darkness, perhaps its a bit darker. With a nice 2 cm thick head, with kind of loose bubbles, but it stays around and leaves little sticky bits of lacing. And exiting beer to behold I'd say - but if the head was just a little more dense it would look nicer. The smell is very intense. I mean, milk stout, this smells like milk. Just a whole lot of lactose, and a bit of lactic acid in there I think - there's a distinct acidity/tartness in the smell, but I don't think this was infected or oxidized, it's just the milk sugar. There's also a complex roastiness, combining coffee, burnt toast, chocolate (sweet milk chocolate and dark). I don't know how most people feel about the smell here, but I really find it enchanting - a little more roastiness would be nice (and maybe dial down on the lactic acid kind of smell). This has all of the things you expect from a milk stout. Just a little tartness, but really a very nice sweetness layered on top of a kind of dry coffee and toast flavor. The toasty bread I think wins out, with a nice deep burnt flavor coming through, balanced with the lactose sweetness. Then a touch of cocoa powder comes in and it finishes again very milky - almost a bit of week-old milky flavor, when it gets some edge on it. I'm liking this series, that takes it to the extreme of a certain stout ingredient, and I can imagine developing a big craving for these in the future. The mouthfeel here is still very full, I mean good body, but the carbonation, just like with the One, just stings, it's too sharp, I wish that could be dialed down. It's like swallowing syrup with little prickly bits of glass or something in it (not quite that extreme, but you get the idea). Not quite offense in the feeling, but not enticing. This one is fairly enjoyable, but extremely complex and challenging I think. I actually found myself drinking it quicker than expected. The ABV is probably a bit higher than I'd want from a more-than-one-r, but I would call myself a fan of this beer, as far as milk stouts go.","taylorhamrick","Sep 02, 2009"

Opaque, jet black, under a very bright light there are miniscule bubbles springs dotting the surface of the brew but you really have to look closely to see them. Smell of chocolate cake, stewed prunes, black forest cake. Initial taste was a bit shocking in that it was very sour to the point of producing a lemon-pucker in this reviewer. As it aired and warmed, the sourness softened somewhat and a prune tort and later a black forest cake with sour cherry taste emerged. Still, sourness persisted with a sour milk effect that was not all that pleasing. Overall, a bit too tart for my liking. The finish was relatively short. Although a most intriguing brew, I found this not to my liking and doubt that I would pick it up again; thankfully, Dark Horse has so many excellent products that it's a priviledge to support their efforts despite my not savouring this particular one.","ThatWineGuy","Jul 25, 2009"

The flavor has a very roasted malt taste up front with a slight bit of dark fruits, unsweetened chocolate and coffee laying underneath. A little hint of bitterness is there but is quickly mellowed out by a sweet cream base. It's not supercrazy in it's complexities but the flavors balance each other well.

Slight lactic sourness in the background. Flavor is nice chocolatey sweetness, creamy, light roasted flavors, almost no bitterness at all. This beer is incredibly smooth, so creamy on the the tongue, but doesn't quite reach full bodied for such a dark beer. Carbonation is light, but only adds to the silkiness.

The aroma is solid roasty malt base with a moderate pineyness and a lactic acid sharpness apparent when I take a deep sniff over top. The flavor is very nice with a solid and nicely bitter roasted malt that melds into a creamy lacto sweetness that then finishes with a nice ashy roast again.

3.25,-16.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Got this one in a trade from emerge077 and I'd like to thank him again for an excellent trade (it included a dark lord). This one pours jet black with a very dark mocha head. It was hard to determine exactly what color the head was because it disappeared very quickly. Roasted malt dominates this fairly weak aroma and is backed up a bit by some coffee. The flavor is predominated by dark chocolate but it is too bitter. There is some coffee in the background. Some astringency that is present is a bit of a turn off. This isn't my favorite of cream stouts in that it isn't very sweet. I do taste some lactose in there I believe though, so I guess the style is correct. An average beer all around.","drseamus","May 24, 2007"

3.73,-4.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a very dark black with little tan head and little retention. Aroma is cocoa, coffee, and roasted sweet malts. Taste is on the sweet side with chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits being the primary components. Very creamy mouthfeel. Not the most drinkable cream stout from Michigan, but a very solid beer.","Duster72","Apr 14, 2007"
4.37,12.3,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Now that I'm halfway through the One, Too, Tres, Fore series of Dark Horse stouts, I have to say that I'm impressed. Too is easily the equal of One and is so drinkable that I've finished the beer before finishing my review; something that doesn't happen very often. Snag this one if you have the opportunity. It's excellent beer.","BuckeyeNation","Apr 13, 2007"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,5,4,"Easily one of the darkest beers I've ever seen, Dark Horse's Cream Stout pours an opaque stream of oily black into the glass, steadily raising a frothy dark brown head that drops shortly to a wide collar and whispy surface covering. Its intensity of color, however, is not carried over into the flavor and aroma. The nose is, in fact, more fruity (with a berry-like yeastiness) than it is roasty. Only as it warms does the coffee and dark chocolate character begin to rise. The mouthfeel is certainly full though, leaving it somewhat viscous, supple, and creamy smooth across the palate with a mild, very-fine bubbled natural carbonation from bottle conditioning. In the flavor it's mainly coffee-like, with mild hints of bittersweet chocolate, but no sweetish caramel or nuttiness. And the expected, harsh and bitter, super deep roastiness like an ashtray is entirely missing... this is actually quite smooth and rounded! There's not a lot of complexity to it, but it IS rich, and it lingers in the aftertaste for minutes after it's gone. Quite nice. A great cigar beer!","NeroFiddled","Apr 07, 2007"

4.23,8.7,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"I get a kick out of the unassuming, boring, white labels Dark Horse uses. It is a great contrast to the liquid gold on the inside.","david131","Mar 12, 2007"
3.89,0,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Slight roasted malt flavor up front, quickly replaced with sweet milk chocolate and sugary dark fruits. Dries out with notes of coffee, baking chocolate, and peat. Oily mouthfeel with a full body and modest carbonation. Perhaps a little bit rougher than the other holiday stouts by DH, but still not bad at all.","alexgash","Beers"
4.07,4.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clean dark brown/black color, some carbonation, no head or lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet roasted malts, slight vanilla, and some toffee/coffee. The taste pretty much follows the nose, sweet malty, and a nice touch of toffee/coffee. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very nice Milk/Sweet Stout, glad to have a chance to check this brewery out, this is my first, but I do have another from them, and hopefully a couple of other's coming in trade.

3.92,0.8,2.5,3,4.5,4.5,4,"D - Pretty good. This is an extremely pleasant and hearty milk stout. It is more of a dessert beer, but one could session it (I suspect the abv is too high for that though). Dark Horse impresses me yet again. I should note that this might have had a really strong hop profile or a ton of bitterness - I wouldn't know since I had devil dancer a few hours ago.","mrasskicktastic","Nov 14, 2006"

3.72,-4.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This was a good beer. I picked up a few singles and will seek out a full 6 pack now. Seems to hit the spot if you want something sweet after dinner and want a beer.","headhopper","Apr 24, 2006"
4.6,18.3,4,4,5,4,5,"Take the bottle and pour it deep into the glass and when the last bubbles froth and foment at the festering fizz top shake the last drips of the bottle onto the surface of the beer. You'll see little bubbles shoot off the top and slide like electricity to the glass sides and die there. This really has nothing to do with this beer but it's something I've noticed from doing this a few times now. All right...deep hued chocolate, coffee smoke, burnt wood and a mild sweetness in the taste of the dregs at the roof of your mouth. One of the best stouts and cream stouts I've ever had.","thelagerheads","Apr 22, 2006"
3.62,-6.9,4,4.5,3.5,3,3,"Opaque black color, just as every single Dark Horse stout, but with a thin, and quickly diminishing light tan head. Espresso and chocolate aromas, with hints of vanilla, roast and brownies, quite the vibrant little blend of malt aromatics. Flavor has some oxidation, just like the aroma, but this is also a 2004 example. Body is slightly undercarbonated and it is thin, but not watery. Slightly bitter and astringent malt, but still decadent and enjoyable, with chocolate and cream flavors. Quite the treat.","Crosling","Mar 30, 2006"

4.1,5.4,4,4,4,5,4,"Damn, this is one creamy stout! They say its brewed with real milk, and by God, you can tell! Not much of a head (I guess I mean none really), just like their Oatmeal Stout. Deep deep dark in color. The mouthfeel is exquisite! I don't normally like melted milkshakes, but in this case I'll take it! Strangely enough, I had this while eating a slice of Banana Cream Pie. Now, I normally don't care much for Banana Cream Pie, but Holy Cow, did this pairing go awesome together! Really! These guys can make some stouts!","rrwiltse","Jan 25, 2006"
4.06,4.4,3,4.5,4,4,4,"Doesnt seem to have as much of the dark vinous fruit qualities present in many of the richer stouts. Instead it hones in on the interplay between the roasted malt and creamy sweetness, and nails it.","Shovelbum","Jan 07, 2006"
3.46,-11.1,2.5,4,3,3.5,4,"Massive coffee and malt aroma. Pours deep black with no real head. Rich dark bakers chocolate flavors followed by coffee.

4.25,9.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Another proof the Michigan has perhaps the best micro breweries anywhere in the country. Poured out to a flat, thick black color of day old coffee. Nearly no head or carbonation, only traces of dark reddish brown foam around the edge of the beer and touches of lace of the same. Aromas of roasted malts, wood, bourbon and a definite smoke element. Nice. Taste was very well crafted and complex. Flavors of earth, wood, coffee and dark chocolate, with spice and molassas toward the finish. Mouthfeel was nice and chewy, with a smoothness to it that is almost silk like. A good level of drinkability for being a heavy beer like it is. A Recommended brew.","Frozensoul327","Nov 10, 2005"

Pitch chocolate brown with a bit of caramel head in tight form that mainly was a thin ring and a tiny dusting just in the center. Deep, dark, and rich aroma. Thick and heavily scented of coffee, chocolate and hops. Creamy smooth feeling, it just glides along your tongue... schweet. Carbonation is just barely present in the background. Wonderful flavors, deep and dark, roasty and lovely. Black strong coffee, vanilla bean, bittersweet chocolate, hoppiness, caramel malts. Such good flavors and feeling in this. Nice one for the lovers of ports and stouts, as it has a lot to give to you.","shapudding","Dec 02, 2004"

There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell has a bit of burnt malt, chocolate, and espresso. A little light though. The taste is full of roasted malt, with some black coffee bitterness. It is rounded out by a sweet caramel and chocolate finish. Not too many hops present. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and heavy on the tongue. The drinkability is fairly good as well. Not a bad cream stout!","SheepNutz","Jul 18, 2003"
3.58,-8,4.5,4,3,4.5,3.5,"Very good bottle-conditioned mouthfeel gives some life to an otherwise slightly boring midpalate, and helps lengthen the finish. My hope is that this bottle is simply a bit past its prime. Regardless, an interesting beer and worth picking up.","Realale","Jul 11, 2003"

4.04,3.9,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"At any rate, this thick, oily, completely opaque black beer forms a thin ring of cinnamon-colored bubbles. This appears to be an imperial stout from the looks of it. The aroma is potent...lots of strong dark coffee, maple-syrup, blackstrap molasses, hints of vanilla, and a very subtle cologne note. Wow. Mildly carbonated. The mouthfeel is thick and oily, with a firm, chewy body. The taste starts out with lots of french roast coffee, gobs of black patent and roasted barley astringency (especially in the finish), a very unique whisky character, with some phenolic alcohols and potent grains becoming evident in the long, spicy bitter finish. Dunno what the ABV is, but it packs a punch. Pleasantly surprised. If you like Kzoo's Stouts, try this.","Mitchster","0"
