"Pours black with head that thins to less than a lace. Smells of sweet chocolate malts...a little mild. Kind of tastes artificially flavored with chemicals. Starts smooth then turns bitter. Not much stands out here and I wouldn't really recommend it."
""
"A true session ale here but I'm not leaning towards buying a lot more and sessioning."
"Very sweet stout, low alcohol content..didnt know what to expect from a japanese stout"
"Easily the worst Milk Stout ever."
"Serving type: bottle."

"overall this beer would have been a drain pour but at almost $5 a bottle i could not bring my self to do that"

"O: decent for a dry stout... can't endorse it for a sweet stout, though Kiuchi has some fringe approaches to their products... it certainly did hold up alright after 2 years, maybe not so surprising"

"Looks OK, smells bad, tastes – meh. Worth trying once while sharing the bottle among 4-6 people; share the pain. If someone offers you one, plead lactose intolerance."

"Sweet Stout has the black and visibly bubbly appearance of Coca-Cola, as it fizzes vigorously on the initial pour, and its head vanishes only a moment later. For the aroma, I pick up caramel and only an inkling of coffee and chocolate...Unfortunately there's what can be described as a metallic off-scent present. The taste however, is quite a bit better. It has a light, milky chocolate flavor, similar to a 'Three Musketeers' candy bar, but it comes with a slightly chalky finish. I don't really mind how it is thin, because I knew that by the ABV % and I happen to like sessionable stouts & porters. Overall though, I expected more from the Kiuchi brewery. I am going to try their Espresso Stout next, as the reviews are much more favorable. In regards to this one, reach for a Guinness instead!"

"Overall: tasty enough and quite drinkable at less than 4%. I might not put this at the top of my list, but for a dark, sessionable beer, this is pretty good (if a little on the sweet side)."

"Bottle into tulip at hitachino tasting 2013. Deep black color with a bit of tan head. Nice roasty sweet malty aroma with a hint of chocolate. Taste is roasty sweet malt...but somewhat chalky and super dry. Its just way to dry for me but flavor is trying to make an appearance just not quite there...meh"
"T/M/O. It has a very lame stout taste. There isn't much of a taste there. It is metallic and a bit burnt. Chalky and dry. It is medium bodied, if not a bit less. It just tastes low quality and the after taste really is unappealing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is decent. Dark hue, not much of a head, and no lacing though. Nose is roasted malt with a really strong sweetness. Charred malt, with very little else. Overall, this is an okay quaff."

"Overall: I was really disappointed with this brew. I didn't really have high expectations and those were definitely not close to being met. But I've enjoyed the other Kiuchi beers so I won't hold this miss against them."
""
"Overall, the Kiuchi Brewery makes other beers that are much, much better than this one. Unfortunately, none of them are stouts, if that is what you're looking for."

"Black, very little bubbles, lightly sweet."
"D- the opposite of what I expected, not at all like a milk stout. The sourness with the roasted grains is a bad combination in my opinion. I don't think I can finish this one."
"Poured into a Lucifer snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass. Thin light brown head dissipates quickly to a ring around the glass. Mild, malty aroma with roast and biscuit malt and hints of chocolate and dry grass. Light flavor of malt, slight roasted malt, light chocolate and a hint of coffee. Light bodied. Light and attenuated flavor, which is expected from this light ABV stout. A pleasant, lightly flavored stout. I've probably moved on past this light a flavor in beer, but this seems nicely made for its intent. Closer to a light porter than a stout."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours very dark brown (almost black) with a thick tan head that dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is of mild coffee with some chocolate and dark roasted malts. It smells slightly sweet. The flavor of this beer follows the nose. The coffee notes are a little more prominent with the chocolate notes receding into the background. The malt notes add to the slight roastiness of this beer. There's some slight sweetness here too. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and very drinkable. It's a bit thin for the style, coming across as more of a porter. It seems like this beer accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's a good beer that's worth trying if you don't mind the price tag."

"O - This is not on of Kiuchi's finest ales which is a shame since I'm a fan of sweet/milk stouts and many of Kiuchi's other brews."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as horrible as others feel it is, just really tough if comparing to other beers. Just misses enough in some areas, and over-compensates in others. I've had much worse."
""
"O: Meh. It's not bad, but it is not that good. I wasn't expecting a great stout from a Japanese brewery. If this is all I could buy and drink in the land of the rising sun, I would not complain though. Interesting to try at least."
"The beer pours a brown color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is heavy on the cream, with some lactose, chocolate and roasted malt mixed in. There is also a slight medicinal aroma which I am not really caring for. The flavor is more straightforward, with the basic characteristics of cream, lactose and chocolate. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"O: This beer was easy to drink but could use a fuller body and stronger flavors."
"O: A pretty decent milk stout. Good flavors to it, however there are a few of things, like lack of flavor in the finish, that hold this beer back. If you're a fan of milk stouts it's still worth a try."
""
""
"O-not bad, I would like a little more flavor and body lots of complaints about the price but I can't go to Japan for $5, but if I ever do go I will probably give this another try"
"Had it on bottle. Thick, dense light tan head, moderate in duration, tops a coal-black body...sweet milk chocolate and licorice in the nose with a bit of wet pine...body extremely smooth and milky, with a light pervading fizzy sourness, a bit like the faint underlying citrus in a cola, and a moderately sweet chalky cocoa texture overlaying it, touches of anise and cherry...relatively dry, smooth and quick finish."
"Overall this was an alright beer. It was an interesting go at something I had never tried before but I found a lack of synergy between two not so great tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I realize people do not like this beer, but i wonder if they base that on the price? It's $5 per bottle, but it isn't THAT bad. It's very drinkable, and it reminds me of a milk-chocolate bar. I like it."
""
"It's a good beer. That's about it. NOT worth $5."
"Drinkability: I like this stuff. True to style, it is not going to be sinister so I think it does its job. It is very smooth, offers a nice (though subdued) flavor experience, and is on the light side in terms of ABV. It is not, however, worth $5 a bottle."

"Thin body does little to deter one from drinking this rather quickly, nor does the low level of carbonation. There's a bit of fizziness early on that provides a bit of a tingle, but it disappears rather quickly. It doesn't take long to drain the 24oz bottle, but it's not something I'd go out of my way to try again."
"O: Not a beer that I would actively seek out again. A little more flavor and some body would do this beer some good."
"Date: 10/2/2011"
"Overall: In one word: """Drainpour""". The only thing worse than the thought of having paid $5.50 for this bottle was the thought of actually finishing the whole thing. I don't dole out Fs very often, but this is, regrettably, one of the worst beers I've ever had. It's way off the reservation style-wise, and can't possibly be what the brewer envisioned. Avoid!"
"It's not bad, but it's very, very unexciting. A stout? Questionable. It has the lightness and easy drinking of any generic beer you choose to name. Pretty boring."
"O - an enjoyable and modestly distinctive stout that is neither heavy nor sweet."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a half inch light tan head that went away quickly. Not much lacing. Aroma is milk chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and a bit of soy sauce. The brew tastes like milk chocolate, roasted malt, lactose, and some coffee. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. It's not a bad brew, but there's nothing impressive about this one either."
"O - Up front this beer lacks taste but I love the iced coffee finish."
"Very drinkable stout and is very versatile, even good in warm weather."
"I didn’t find the aroma to be very strong and got almost no head from the pour at all. I wouldn’t have a problem drinking this again, but I can think of a lot of other stouts I would rather have. Very unremarkable."
"D - Overall not a bad drink, but not great either; aftertaste grows to be a little weird well after drinking, in fact, the lactose I think hampers the full flavor character that rests in this recipe"
"not the best offering from this brewer but not as bad as I expected from the score for this one"
"There’s something very off about the aroma. It’s tart, acidic, and funky. There’s light roasted notes and some sweetness, but it’s drowned out by the former. It doesn’t look bad though. Very dark brown, with lighter tinges on the edges with a light brown head that dissipates fast and leaves nothing. The funk doesn’t really show itself much at all on the taste. Light roasted notes, a bit of milky sweetness, and possibly a hint of chocolate. The feel is creamy, but jeeze is it thin. There’s just not much substance to it. Overall, it’s a mess, and I’m glad I only paid a dollar for it on clearance."
"Tastes of sour milk, soggy French fries, paper, weeds, white chocolate, hops and albion sugar. Wanted something a bit more.... compact? I don't know but the flavors in this didn't really work all that well together. Nah, not really buy this again. Once was enough."
"Pours a 1-finger light brown head that leaves no lace, very dark almost black beer, some yeast left in bottle. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Nose is a sweet malt. Flavor is malty sweet, not dry but for a stout it seems thin. $5.20 for a 330ml bottle, from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"O: Got better as it warmed, but I won't be getting more."
"This pours out as traditional black colored brew with a thin tan head on it that faded quickly. The smell was a little funky but had some decent smokey roasted aromas going on in there. The taste of this was sweet and roasted upfront that went into a subtle nuttiness in the end. The mouthfeel was ok, could have been creamier. This was an average stout at best."
"O - the tart sour nature takes away from the milk stout qualities I was hoping for, somewhat disappointed relative to other Hitachino's I've tried"
"330ml bottle from Buffalo, pours a dark brown with a thick tightly packed head. Nose is a weird dark fruit, sweet, smoke combo. More smoke in the flavor with a slight sweetness, smoke, charred wood, slight infection-type flavor notes. Worst part is the carbonation, WAY too high, bites in the mouth even after trying to swirl it out. Could be quite flavorful for the ABV but there are some major flaws here - Haven't had a beer this bad in a while."
"O: Very strange brew. I don't think I like it."
"O - A tasty offering, but by far the weakest of the Hitachino flagship beers that I've had the pleasure of trying to date. By no means terrible, but just not up to par with the rest of their beers."
"D: Certainly sessionable at just under 4% ABV, and although there's enough flavor squeezed out of such little malt, relative to ABV, this stout is minimalist to the point of exclusion in taste. A pretty tame offering and I'd move on after one, but some may fall for the charm of this sweet, light stout."
"O: Not bad, not overwhelmingly amazing. For the price of these beers, I won't buy again. Wish i knew what this odd """spice""" is from."
"Overall, this is an odd beer. It is certainly for some people, but by no means is it for everyone. I hate to review it so low, because I actually kind of enjoyed this beer, in a masochistic way. Odd."
"O - Looked pretty good but failed to deliver on anything else."
"Carbonation is too high."
"No need to try again. More soda pop character than beer. Little to define it as stout, other than perhaps the color which is giving it the benefit of the doubt."
"At first whiff, I was expecting the worst. However, the sourness, presumably from the lactose, settles down for the most part. What's left is indeed sweet and milky, but without a whole lot else in term of actual flavour. Not worth seeking out."
"I'm not sure I'll finish this bottle, and I'm certainly not tempted to buy another, so I can't give it anything above """Awful""" in the drinkability category."
"D: can be drank but just not enjoyable. flavors are there just not as potent as they could or should be."
"Beer is way too thin, almost no flavor, the primary flavor is ashy and dirty. There is a minimal sweetness up front but I really dislike this beer."
"This is okay as a beer but not all that exciting. There's also a slightly odd note to it that I don't really like."
"D- It's to bad I got 3 more of these, I won't be drinking them."
"Would not drink again unless my throat was on fire."
"D - pass."
"This brew pours a dark as night cola hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a mocha laced two finger head that quickly dissapears to leave a layer of froth across the top,the smell is a mix of aromas of milky coffee and roasted malts,it has an average mouthfeel which should be definately thicker in my eyes and exudes tastes of dark milky coffee,roasted malts and finishes with a slight tiny tinge of bitterness but not as much as i was expecting/hoping,overall its definately an easily drinkable beer but it does have certain let downs in my eyes the first being its very low ABV and the second is its very light mouthfeel and i think if these 2 things were sorted out it could be right up there."
"The lactose just turns me off and kind of grosses me out. I've brewed with lactose and know that when used properly it can add a nice extra element to a stout, but it is simply too overwhelming in this beer, even without it I would barely recognize this as a stout for the lack of any roasted malt."
"Drinkability was missing. It was so sour that I could only take a small sip every minute or two."
"Overall, not what I expected from a sweet stout. Off-putting sweetness plagues this one from aroma to taste to finish. Glad I only got one, as I would not want another"
"When compared to memory with other breakfast/milk/sweet stouts I have had I do not think this is any worse than other labels, but at about $5 US where I buy--- well I could get similar for not as expensive"
"Price = $4.99 at Whole Foods"
"D: While this beer has its good points, mainly it's a disappointment. Kiuchi is capable of much better. Not that drinkable."
"Overall this is a confused and confusing beer. It's probably worth a try but, given the price, I would never buy it again."
"D - If it weren for thewildly inconsistant nature of this brewer I would saw they are great"
"This beer doesn't have much aroma, but what it does have is slightly sour and stout-y. The taste is similar, with dark coffee flavors and a sour aftertaste. Being mildly lactose-intolerant, I poured most of this beer out, thinking it wasn't worth the possibility of a stomache ache."
"Pours black into a pint glass with no head and no lacing. Smells really funky. Lots of sourness, that's about it for the nose. Taste is sour as well, with some dry cocoa in the finish. The cocoa is the only redeeming quality in my opinion. Body is average at best with a bit too much carbonation. Funky, yet boring stout. I have no desire to ever drink this again."
"Funky little beer with a low ABV and a slightly sour finish. Nice roasted malts and some chocolate notes with the slightly sweet finish which is true to the style. I like the sourish finish as it works with the sweetness. Interesting beer as it is a style you don't often see around"
"Drinkability: I am not a fan and will pass on in the future. The sourness is a bit too overbearing for the style. When you mix that with the background sugar sweetness, the beer does not work. Way different for the style-not bad if you want just to try a sour beer."
"Yawner. Especially for this beer style. Poured with a short but enduring tan head and good lace. Aroma is mild of malt, roastiness, caramel, and chocolate. Flavor's about the same, but with some tartness and funkyness. Body is thin and ok carbonation. Not one of my favs. Cant see it as a session."
"I have to say I actually really did enjoy this beer, it pour a very dark black in color with little to no carbonation and a slight white head. Its smelled of roasted malts and espresso, nice yet not overwhelming nose. I actually very much enjoyed the flavor to this stout. Nice sweetness and malt, a lot of roasted malts and sweet coffee and hints of chocolate. Very well balanced and not off putting in anyway. Mouthfeel was medium bodied soft and smooth. Overall drink ability on this was actually great and I liked this as a really nice session stout if money was no option. Its only at 4 percent alcohol and the flavor does not seem to suffer much from this at all. Overall this was more then I would have been expecting from a Japanese stout. This is one I would seek out again and think would go great with a good meal or to drink as something that wont get you bombed. Would be a good beer to have out when you would still have to drive later and dont want to be getting a dui with out sacrificing flavor in the process."
"It poured with a finger of deep-tan head with good retention. Nose was dank with notes of molasses, prunes, and dark chocolate. Color was a deep, dark brown with only cola highlights at the edges. Mouthfeel was medium with a slightly sour dark chocolate flavor. Finish was slightly bitter, like bittersweet chocolate and coffee. For a milk/sweet stout, this was pretty sour. Oof."
"Pours deep, opaque sable with a fairly thick, if not persistent, light tan head. Aroma is malty and yeasty as well as chocolaty and a little sweet. Flavor is more like an ale than a stout, mainly malty with a chocolaty undertone and nutty and coffee hints - tasty nonetheless. Texture is smooth and fairly tingly. Dang, I really like for a stout to taste like a stout."
"Wow, I started this review expecting to tear apart this beer. But it is very good and well worth trying. I wonder if the recipe has changed as I don't remember this beer tasting anything like this. Even if you tried this beer before, try a fresher batch of it and see if it is different than you remember. Very good and tasty stout, and this is coming from someone who almost exclusively drinks Imperial Stouts."
"Not bad but the aftertaste doesn't seem right. It's also somewhat thin as well. Worth a try regardless."
"Drinkability: I personally like milk stouts but this is a milk stout I wouldn't have again. I'd rather have a Mackeson or a Lancasters Milk stout."
"Notes - Might wear on you over the course of a night. The light carbonation could be improved but this beer still ain't bad."
"D - Interesting and worth remembering. Still, it's far enough off the beaten path to remain a specialty beer. Especially at its price. There are occasions where it'll be the perfect choice, but they are rare. Until then there are better deals if I just want a """normal""" milk stout."
"Boy this was a big disappointment. I like some of what Kiuchi does, but this beer is a one-note wonder. Pours dark ruby with an effervescent head that foreshadows the overly carbonated mouthfeel. The lactose sweetness definitely comes through, but it has amost no roasted malt backbone to provide balance. Without any roasted bitterness or coffee qualities, the lactose dominates with an unpleasant soy / metallic quality. There just isn't enough here to make this worth your while."
"Interesting beer. Weird, but interesting."
"Overall, this is an okay beer. It has the benefit of not being overly potent which helps make it tolerable to have more than one but the taste and smell make it seem like something I would only have once."
"D: High drinkability due to good ratings on the above. Low alcohol makes this almost a session beer. Slightly odd taste brings down overall drinkability."
"D= Not a terrible beer, just not a very good tasting example of the style."
"It makes something of a comeback as it progresses, but has a sour undertow that doesn't help."
"MF&D - I think I may have finally found a beer with a more unapealing consistency than guinness draught! but seriously this beer could man up, and get some body to match its midnight black color. I would certainly not want another one of these beers."
"Mouthfeel is decent, creamy and smooth - but somewhat light, especially for a stout. I personally like sour ales, funky brews - but this just missed its mark, in my opinion. It was just too much, or maybe just not what I was expecting, but either way I didn't enjoy this very much. I guess it's worth a shot as it is a pretty original and interesting brew, however."
"Ah well, you can't win 'em all. At least I can say I tried it."
"Hitachino Nest has always been a homerun hitter in my book...until this one. It does nothing for me. Watery and sour are two descriptors I don't enjoy in a milk stout."
"Not good. I'm amazed this is by the same brewery responsible for the completely wonderful Celebration ale. I'll keep trying Hitachino stuff--so far they've got one truly great beer, one so-so beer (Red Rice ale) and this thing."
"Pours dark brown/black color with a massive three finger creamed coffee head with good retention and some sticky lacing. Awfully thick on the pour, like spent motor oil. Aroma of roasted malts, some burnt caramel and hints of sweet lactic acid. Flavor is a bit watered down, and the slightest hint of sourness. Chocolate flavors permeate the brew, some nice roastiness, and a biting bitterness on the finish. Some sweet cola flavors appear as it warms. Mouthfeel seems kind of thin, considering the look upon the pour. Carbonation is light and it goes down awfully smooth. Not a bad brew, but would like a little more flavor."
"Drinkablity: Different interpretation of the style but very drinkable and intense."
"kind of a weird one and not my favorite hitachino offering, but far from bad. the lactose or something gave it a strange, but for some reason pleasing, soured milk scent and taste. a bit of smoke and tobacco in there as well, it kind of reminded me of guiness in the can with a spoiled milk funk. i know that sounds terrible, but it wasn't half bad. i'll stick to the classic, espresso, white and ginger. oh yeah, and celebration and xh. one of my favorite breweries, this one just lacks a bit."
"A strange beer. I would have it again just to compare to my first one. But overall it was a little confusing and my least favourite of the Hitachino lineup."
"As far as drinkability goes this is just slightly above average. For the price I'd rather find something with a little bit more flavor and classic stout characteristics. That said, it's worth at least one try."
"D: A tad sweet but good drinkability and unique. At only 4% abv it comes off sweet with lots of flavor but is limited in multiples."
"Overall, I think that this beer is a mess. Too much lactose. Tobacco flavor and twang. Avoid this."
"Drinks good, a nice sweet stout, a bit pricey, paid about $5.50 for 12 ounces"
"Milk chocolate is apparent on the palate but not as strong as the nose. Also tastes of some sort of roasted malt bitterness and sourness."
"D : I'll pass on this one."
"D: Easy drinker. I definitely could have more than one. Thankfully it is low in alcohol, so that won't be a problem."
"Maybe I should have listened to the reviews on this one. Well it looked ok, very dark brown with two fingers worth of light brown head, but smelled a little weird kind of like green olives. Had a watered down light feel to in the mouth and tasted a little sour with a very small amount of dark malts showing thru. Quite a strange smelling and tasting beer. I drank the entire bottle and have never poured out a beer before, but this one is closest I have come to doing such a horrible thing. I wouldn't recommend this beer and will never try it again... however, I would not dismiss this brewery because I absolutely love their white ale simply fantastic."
"Meh, interesting, but I pass. Too bitter/sour for the style. At least its something different."
"This little bad boy has been sitting in my beer cellar for about 3 years now, and I dug it out tonight. Served at cellar temp in a stemmed glass. Pours a dark black color, with a decent size head that faded quickly though. There was a cola-like fizziness to the carbonation. The taste was pretty good but not spectacular. Had some decent aspects of coffee and chocolate to it. Very thin body though, which was a negative. This is the 2nd milk stout I've had, and this one was surprisingly not as sweet as I expected. More roasted flavor than sweetness. A slightly subpar stout in comparison to others out there, but a decent introduction to a Japanese craft brewer."
"Copped a single, short, fat, stout bottle from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... wasn't expecting such a weak 3.9% ABV... The best thing about this beer is its impressive appearance, which pours a jet-black, ebony, hue with an impressive foamy and frothy head that boasted some staying power... aroma was about average... some slight chocolate and malt flavors but not too dominant or overwhelming... flavor was somewhat bland and watery, with obvious mocha and espresso flavors apparaent, but were overshadowed by a weak and unimpressive watery aftertaste... certainly my least favorite brew from Kiuchi that I've sampled thus far... Not too impressed with this one... Pass it up - Hitachino makes much better beers than this one..."
"Poured a 21oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice (2 pours). Poured a hazy, opaque black with a slight tan head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing. The aroma reminded me of a glass of chocolate milk that had been left in the sun for about an hour to long. Taste is very weak. There was a faint sweetness, no creaminess, and a strange tartness at the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and there was a strange amount of carbonation. I try no to let one beer set my impressions of a brewery, but it will be hard to get it out of my mind."
"Upon opening the bottle, dark chocolate, caramelized malty goodness, and a slight citrus aroma fill the air. As I pour it into a giant goblet the head grows and grows. There is highly active carbonation and now I smell a bit of berry. Although there is a definite creaminess the carbonation makes this beer taste lighter than it is. The head sticks to the side of the glass and last well past my drinking."
"Pour was great in color and head. Flavor was shallow, sweetness was hardly there at all, and mouthfeel was really thin. I also didn't think the somewhat tart note in the backround was appropriate. A sweet stout need not be chewy to be good, but this was too watery. It was worth a try, but I'll not be going back for more. I'm glad this wasn't the only beer I bought today."
"Feels thin and inconsistent, hops tries to give a bite at the end, but doesn't. Perhaps a sour-milk porter is a better description. Drain pour. But would like to try a fresher version."
"This brew poured thick and almost flat out of the bottle with no head to speak of. Aromas were of sweet roasted malts, some nuttiness too. Taste was on the verge of too sweet- sucralose sugars, somwhat artificial with no bitterness to balance. This is just too sweet. There is a slick oilyness to the mouthfeel, is there dairy creamer is this? well, whatever the case it is somewhat disturbing. There is an aftertaste of coconuts, and more sweetness. Not a balanced brew, i could hardly finish the small bottle."
"D - I'd drink this again if it were free."
"The first thing that hits me is fruit bouquet, then herbal hop ushers in phenols. There is a sourness I find off-putting and tobacco in the finish. Good if you don't think of it as stout. Awesome with lamb. This stuff is definately different. Mouthfeel gets points off for stinging."
"pours a dark brown with a two finger sandy colored head that faded quickly to just the beer. looked like a glass of prune juice. aromas of burnt coffee and roasted malt. taste same with a sour acidicness that gets stronger as the beer warms, a unusual tasting beer i asume from the lactose. moutfeel light and carbonation light. not a very well put together beer. not one i would recommend or buy again."
"Poured out of a big bottle into the glass a solid black body that appears rather thinnish. Head is tan and tall. Smell is a mix of chocolate, roasted malt, lactic acid, lemon juice, and some funk. The chocolate is surely present in the taste but the roastiness mellows it out. Lots of acid on the tongue with lemon juice flavors and lactic acid. I pick up some tobacco in the flavor somewhere. Finishes dry with more roasted grain and some black berry that sticks in my mind on into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is kind of light and lively. OK. This is an extremely refreshing, interesting, and delicious stout that I could see being a good summer session stout, especially since it's less than 4% abv."
"After I posted this review and got closer to finishing the beer, I noticed quite a lot of rather large particles of debris in the bottom of the pint glass."
"Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout has more in common with dark Belgians such as Vondel, Troubadour Obscura, and De Dolle Export Stout. However it's balance and drinkability fall below these examples. It's unique as others have said, but not especially palatable. Worth a try if you're comparing oddball Stouts."
"Im sampling a cellar temp bottle poured into a snifter. the beer pours a clear but dark brown and allows no light passage. A small fizzy tan head foams up for a second and leaves quickly leaving no evidence. Aroma is a little bit of chocolate and brown sugar but is dominated by a tangy funkiness. First sip reveals a silky smooth texture and very fine tingly carbonation. Flavor starts sweet with brown sugar and caramel allows some roasted malt in the middle and also a bit of lactic funkiness as well. The finish is tangy funk and I am not sure if this is normal or if the beer is just a hint past prime. the other beer flavors are enjoyable and are still easily discerned and I have heard that hitachino brews tend to be funky. This isnt really similar to most sweet stouts I have had, and Im not sure I like it but I know I dont hate it."
"I would categorize this beer as a sweet stout or a milk stout. There is not a lot of roastiness to it, but there is a pleasing sweet milk sugar (lactose) flavor to it up-front. Like a number of Hitachino beers, I got some cedar notes (like being in a humidor). I thought this beer was highly drinkable for a sweet stout, even more drinkable than a number of dry stouts (like Guinness). Color was dark, but not inky black like some other stouts. Aroma was a bit like condensed milk. I would recommend this stout if you're looking for something different the next time you're at your local sushi bar or Japanese restaurant."
"Drinkability: As I said earlier, interesting, but not sure I like it. Not much roasted barley presence and not as creamy of a mouthfeel as I look for in a milk stout. Not terrible, but probably a one time thing for me."
"Whimsical bottle. Whimsical beer? Not so much. Appropriately stouty in appearance--clear but very dark, with rusty brown tinges around the edges. Topped off with a modest cap of fine, brown head that quickly fell away to a tight ring. A more assertive nose than anticipated--even when still well chilled--highlighted by a tasty choco-coffee roastiness. Those notes carry over less to the taste, which is characterized by a lasting, creamy sweetness and complemented by an unexpectedly crisp mouthfeel. There are some funky things going on here. An interesting stout that's neither easily described nor easily dismissed."
"Somehow this beer is interesting and sort of fun to drink, at least once. Not risking much since the ABV is so low."
"Drinkability: This one was a complete bust, unfortunately. There are far better examples of this style, and I'd wager most could be had for far cheaper than this one. If you must insist on trying this one get the smaller size."
"A slightly above average stout, and a good showing from Japan makes for a one time buy in my opinion."
"Finish is sour and slightly acidic. Not something I would waste my money on again."
"I would drink this beer again, but I won't be running out to buy it again soon. But I say, if you want to try something different, go ahead and pick one up."
"I have a couple of other Hitachinos in my fridge. I have higher hopes for them."
"D- would not buy this beer again, incredibly dissapointed, can't believe this was recommended to me, I would hope their other beers are better"
"D: This might pair well with a meal, but by itself, it's not very special."
"d: a weird brew, not too bad, but a lot of the taste, I wasn't used to. I would have to say I would not buy this beer again, although I would try it again if someone offered it to me."
"Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout pours an opaque black with a thick fluffy tan head from a brown one pint, five ounce bottle. The aroma is very sweet, with roasted malt being most noticeable. The flavor is not as sweet as the smell, there is some sweetness and even some tartness too. The roasted malt is most noticeable toward the finish. This is a different take for sure on the style, I think it's kind of average to perhaps a bit above average overall. Worth a try, if only for the cool bottle (there is a screened on label with an odd looking owl on it). Not a bad beer, but not a great one either, from an interesting brewery. I've got to say all of the beers I've tried from them have been intriguing, and the White Ale is outstanding. Definitely a brewery worth checking out."
"This is a wonderfully complex and different tasting beer. With me it's like Froach's Heather Ale. Not for everyone, and not to have often, but good to try and experience and revisit after awhile."
"This was unquestionably the worst beer I had ever drunk. Worst of all, I paid $3.60 for this bottle of swill."
"I love this brewery, taunting owl and all. I think it's because they make far better beer than anyone expects comming out of Japan. This Lacto-Sweet Stout is very good for it's style, but the style is a bit whacked. There are lots of sweet malts, roasted grain, creaminess and smoothness rising out of this beer. However, the lactose sugars are very strong, making the beer overly sweet and a little oily. I often get a grape Kool-Aid flavor from milk stouts when over done. The carbonation seems to make the beer prickly and too efforvescent on the toung, distracting from the creamy, smooth texture. But, an easy drinking stout regardless."
"Notes: Ehhh for the price I'd avoid this forever."
"CRUX: Obviously this isn't the same beer others have raved about...great bottle label graphics, though..."
"Drinkability: Let me just say that I have loved every Kiuchi Brewery beer I've tried to date; that's why I picked this to be my 150th review. But I must say, I am disappointed, and I cannot quite recommend this beer."
"Mouthfeel is okay, typcial stout, but the strange, sour and somewhat astringent taste affects the drinkability. Not horrible, but what exactly is this? Sweet stout? No. Milk stout...only if you think of buttermilk as milk."
"Not that bad a beer but not that great a beer either. An interesting beer that I just really can't see drinking again."
"Its a dark, blackish-brown color with ruby highlights and a shallow, wispy head. The aroma is chocolate and lots of roasted barley. Its got a sour, slightly acidic smell also. The taste is full and sweet, with a chocolate milk character. Some coffee and grain as well. Its a little oily, and has pretty low carbonation. The sour acidity that was present in the smell really stands out in the taste. At first I wasnt sure if it was intentional, or if there was some bacterial infection. By the end of the bottle I concluded that it was supposed to be there to balance the sweetness. Lactic acid to balance the lactose? Different, thats for sure. Again, very little hops. This beer didnt do much for me. To be honest, I was pretty disappointed."
"I think there are better beers of this particular style. This is one that is worth a taste but I doubt I will try it again."
"As a milk stout this is the worst I have ever had, but as a beer I just love it. It has so many of the characteristics that I find charming and addicting in lambics, gauzes, and winter saisons. Absolutely unique and innovative."
"This beer would probably be a good session beer. It is very low in alcohol, so that definately wouldnt be a problem. Also, the flavor is not offensive or overbearing. I think this beer is pretty good. The half and half flavor took a little while to get used to, but not I kind of like it."
"D- I would call this a Japanese stout. Its flavors remind me of the taste of traditional Japanese cuisine. Very soft subtle flavors yet complex and interesting at the same time. There are nuances that are good flavors but hard to describe. Nice beer that is subtle, yet mysteriously interesting."
"Don't get it."
"Overall: The sweetness is a little too much. There are roasted flavors, but rather than providing balance the milk sugars overpower them."
"A nice warm up to the evening..."
"The flavor is an improvement--the saltiness is present, but muted. Not much in terms of roasted flavors. The body is very thin for the style. This is like a beginner's stout for those who are not ready for the big boys from Ireland."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a weird black malt scent that is a bit tart smelling. There may be some chocolate malts in here as well. The taste is good. It has a tangy crystal and black malt flavor that is sweet with lactose, creamy on the finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This was an interesting take on a sweet stout. I liked the taste although it was a bit tangy instead of retaining a true stout -like flavor."
"Very slighly burned black but not quite jet. Medium brown dense head that held. The smell was fantastic IMO with tons of coffee, milk, and brown sugar. It even faded and hit you again each sniff. Somewhat overly carbonated causing the taste to be a bit flighty. Definite milk and malt but it comes of as very artificial and not brewed. As if they had something overly malty and decided to add sugar and half-and-hald as an afterthought. Felt OK, actually quite good, but not very drinkable as inconsistent and generally weird as it is."
"I liked this beer a lot, but I think this is one of those love it or hate it beers without much middle ground. Poured with a huge amount of carbonation. Too much actually. Once that had disipated, sweet chocolaty aromas were present. Taste... lots of sweetness, chocolate, some caramel and malt. Not much hops. You can tell its a lacto stout, very candy-chocolate like. Mouthfeel was too carbonated, but not bad. A nice drinkable stout at 3.9% if you like a sweet stout. Price however is kinda prohibitive. I'd drink it again, but the cost would keep me away when there's other world class offerings out there at that price or less."
"This beer sits in my glass a dark, almost black color, it shows a rich brown, clear color when held up to the light. The head is wispy and light brown at first, but once roused shows a frothy brown head. The aroma smells lightly of coffee, with notes of sweet chocolate, and a hint of astringent roasted grain. The beer is surprisingly dry up front, with a certain acidity to it that seems to be mainly contributed by the dark malts. This beer has notes of dark chocolate, a bit of lightly acidic espresso, and even a bit of milk chocolate. This beer has a certain fullness to it as it hits my tongue but all in all it is fairly light on the palate. This beer was not at all what I was expecting from a sweet stout, really only lightly sweet, but I probably like it better because of this."
"Interesting. Not bad. A little expensive. I would drink this again . . . especially if somebody else were buying."
"Hitachino Nest Sweet Stout (Lacto) is a peculiar beer to be sure. That peculiarity, rather than making it good or interesting, makes it not so good and not that interesting. The major culprit, I believe, is the addition of the lactose. It has more than enough other faults, but losing that artificial sweetness would at least clear the decks so that the malt, hops and yeast could be appreciated on their own merits."
"The beer emerges from the 330ml brown bottle a soot black with a minimal frothy tan head that vanishes quickly leaving the lace thin and somewhat patchy. Nose has a modest roasted grain aroma, the acidity quite noticeable, caramel, some milk sweetness, with the start sweet and the grain profile light, the top is light to moderate in its feel. Finish is ferine in its acidity, the hops present but light, the aftertaste chalky and dry, a different beer for sure, cannot say it did much for me, but something different never hurts IMHO."
"overall, not a bad beer but not a great beer too. It's definetly worth trying if you get the chance, but it probably wont be on your most favorite list."
"The taste is much better. Simultaneously sweet and creamy, while strangely dry and chocolately. There's nutty, toffee aspect, and a pleasant cocoa powder finsish. It's a very easy drinking sweet stout, but whether it's worth the price for the little bottle is hard to say."
"I found this beer to be not nearly as good as the other Hitachino beers I've tried and a little disappointing."
"I've really started to enjoy the flavors in sweet and milk stouts, so I was relaly excited to see this on tap at Rich-O's. The beer poured a flat black color wtih a small head that falls to barely coat the beer. The nose was really weak, with only some light chocolate tones coming through. The flavor was not at all what I was expecting. This beer was really bland, lacking any of the creamy, sweet, marshmellowey characters I was hoping. None of the lacto character that I am familiar with came through. Boo on this beer. The feel was too thin, being a light moderate and I really did't think the drinability was all that good. I was not impressed with this offering."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Skip it. It wasn't sweet and it wasn't very interesting. It also was overpriced at $4 per bottle."
"I must have gotten a good bottle, cause this was pretty decent. Had a nice deep dark color, with a frothy tan head. The head lasted a little bit, then died out to a laceing. Smell was of lactose and roasted malts. Taste was similar, but a little more with a chocolate hint in it. I thought it was pretty good. Not as good as Mackeson's Triple Stout, but still pretty good."
"Drinkability ? nasty sourness makes this a nasty beer. Could be a bad bottle."
"Overall, pretty drinkable considering I don't care for the style that much."
"Pours a nearly opaque black with a very small amount of head. The thin tan ring of remaining head leaves a little bit of lacing as it goes. Aroma is sour with a touch of chocolaty sweetness. Flavor is much the same with the chocolte taking the fore and a very slight bit of bitterness sneaking in. Easy drinking, but the lactose flavor gets old."
"Pours a pitch black with an enormous light tan head. Some deep red/mahogany hues. Dark malt aromas and some sweet, milky tones noticable. Somewhat sour nose. Sour, metallic flavors upfront. Sour and bitter throughout. Dry, bitter finish. Light mouthfeel. Lingering, quite bitter finish. Don't like this one. Glad to try it, but won't try again. Not my style."
"This poured out with way too much head. It took quite a while to get the whole bottle in a 16oz glass. The body was black with a huge light tan head that dies fairly quickly and left some scattered lace in its wake. A bit of cream in the nose and an odd sourness, overall a weak unappealing smell. Taste is similar to soda with an off sour taste and a cream presence as well. Body was about medium with no notable qualities. Crap for drinkability considering the offness of the smell and taste. Not something I wish to try again and a huge let down considering how excellent their celebration ale is."
"pours a dark brown to near black colour with a moderate but somewhat sticky tan head. the smell is of chocolate, caramel and malt. sweet and sugary but not unbearable. the flavour is most definitely sweet and chocolate here, but it is nicely balanced and cut down upon by the malt. caramel intermingles as well. this one is very smooth and very creamy. it's a bit thin of a stout, but it's a diferent kind of stout so it's to be expected a bit. could i drink this in large quantities as a session brew? no way. is it a nice dessert brew or one to sample from time to time? most definitely. enjoyable in small doses, i'd say."
"Had this one in a 25oz bottle. Poured a dark brown color with a small head that died off pretty quickly. The aroma has caramel malts and a slight bit of chocolate and maybe even a little sourness (?) The flavor wasn't what I was expecting. Sour milk mostly and some roasted malts made up the most part. This wasn't a """bad""" beer, but I really didn't enjoy it very much."
"Drinkability is low. Too bad. I'd like to have a low alcohol beer in my regular rotation."
"Sinkability  I couldn't finish much of this bottle."
"Overall: Not as sweet as I first expected. I have enjoyed all of the other Hitachino beers that I have imbibed to date, but this is the first one that I dont really care for. Its not that it is bad, or even revolting, but it is different. Worth a try, but only once mid you."
"Drinkability: If you like this style, it would be very drinkable because it is low in alcohol and not too filling. I won't drink another one, though."
"There was a nice roasted foretaste, and slight sweetness, with some fruitiness following. Not TOO bad a beer, but far from what I had hoped from a sweet stout."
"Drinkability: I suppose I could drink several of these, just not sure I would want too."
"Not as good as it smells. An off taste at first, almost sour followed by a mellow sweetness that has coffee and sugar aspects to it. Good but for the offputting start which lowers the over all appeal of this one."
"This beer goes down easy, and the more you drink, the better it gets. It's still too sweet, though, and that limits how often you'll want it."
"pours a deep brown colour with a few ruby highlights, with a slight tan head and a a bit of lacing. the aroma is a sharp acidic sweetness, a bit solvent. hinting of sourness, coffe notes, caramel and bittersweet chocolate waft through the divide. the flavour seems a bit sour and off at first. although part of the flavour profile, the sourness takes some getting used to. lots of dark roasted malt and other sweet stout delights abound. the mouthfeel seems a bit thin for a stout, but maybe i'm distracted by all the unfamiliar flavours this lacto stout is unveiling. as for drinkability...i'm not sure i would want more than one of these per session. it's rather unique."
"It pours a nice dark black with a thin head. The aroma is mostly roasted coffe, but sort of one dimentional. The taste is sweet and creamy also like a cappuccino. There is a weird sourness in the finish. This is a unique beer to say the least. The coffee and sweet cream tastes highlighted with a slight sourness is worth another try."
"Still, I'm interested to see what they would do with an Imperial Stout, even an Oatmeal."
"Te head on this stout more of a crbonation head than a thick foamy head found on some stouts. It was a dark black color with just the slightest hint of mahogony when held up to the light. The aroma is at first a roasted malt followed by a sweet malty smell. This is a very easy going stout . In that the flavors have smoothed edges as opposed to being aggressive in nature. The roasted malt flavor comes in first and finishes with a soomth but light sweetness as in the aroma. With the low alc.% and easy flavor I think I could put away several of these at one night at the pub."
"Very interesting. Try it just to see what you think. I don't believe I'll be getting this again, though I wouldn't mind it."
" Aroma is Japanese? Sour cream is not what I was expecting from anybody's stout, but it's here and combines with coca cola, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate flavors to provide a drinkable and challenging experience. It's light bodied for a stout, and has respectable components of dark roasted malts and chocolate notes to overpower the scalded milk notes. A very interesting brew, indeed. If you enjoy chocolate on your cottage cheese, you will definitely like this stout. I'm awarding it a 5.0 for Peculiarity. Not for the squeamish."
" Smells sweet and malty with some of the roasted notes expected from a stout. On first taste I get some sweetness and alcohol, then a short burst of roasted malt. It finishes rather quickly.The mouthfeel is somewhat thin yet coating.There is a little more depth as it warms,but there doesnt seem to be much to this.Its not a bad stout but certainly not anything to shout about."
"A review of a beer containing lactose milk sugar by a lactose intolerant person may be prejudicial but here it is anyway. This beer has an opaque dark brown color and no head. The aroma was pretty much that of caramel. It has a smooth taste of sweet milky caramel with undertones of toasted malt. There are hints of chocolate as well. The hops were pretty laid back with only a little bit of bite. The mouthfeel was a little doughy with not much carbonation. I really did not care for the lactose milk sugar after taste. However, most people might find this a good dessert beer."
"ok first off this is the 24oz bottles and i was totally hyped on the bottle, it looks cool as hell. it pours dark brown, not black and with really no head to speak of. the smell is somewhat modest and contains cocoa, malt and has an odd spoiled milk smell. taste wise? ugh. talk about a let down. it honestly tastes like crap. sure theres malty chocolate notes but theyre smashed by the odd taste of rotten milk. it grossed me the f**k out. i mean im always one to finish a beer no matter how bad, but 3/4 of the way through this, down the drain it went. it was crisp but thin and not what youd expect from a stout. total bummer and expensive. not gona hit this one up again, ever."
"Drinkability: I'm sorry to say I finally poured this beer out (I do that maybe once a year, tops). I gave this tasting numerous chances, letting it warm up, etc... but for my taste, this brew is nearly offensive."
"Thin, dense, espresso crema-colored head. Sweet Stout is very, very dark brown in color and smells a bit like Kahlua, with chocolate and cafe latte notes. The taste is creamy, with strong coffee and cream flavor and a touch of dry cocoa. The influence of the lactose is easy to detect, as it makes this brew creamy, sweet, and a touch sour in the finish. Nice, full mouthfeel. This beer isn't at all oppressive, especially for a stout, and is surprisingly easy to drink. Overall, it reminds me very much of a slightly smoky Kahlua flavor. I'll have this one again."
"Had this at the New Bukowski's in Inman Sq. Served in the ceramic Hitachino Nest glass so I couldn't get a good look at the color. Head is the color of a chocolate milk shake. Smell is distinctly of caramels. Really smells of caramels as the beer warmed up. Taste: creamy and milky similar to 1% milk consistency, can taste the lactose and the sweet caramel and malt flavors, finishes by coating the back of my throat like a glass of milk would. Interesting offering, worth trying but not drinking on a regular basis."
"Although it's quite dark, it has a hint shows a hint of mahogany when held up to the light. The heady was bubbly but disappeared almost immediately without a trace of lace on the glass. The smell is light, with just detectable notes of chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is also a bit underwhelming. Nothing about it is particularly offensive; it just doesn't stand out in any way. It's undoubtedly watery for a stout. Although it's only 3.9%, it doesn't lend itself to session drinking. I'll pass on this one."
"This stout poured black as soy sauce with a creamy, tan head (typical nitrogen foam). The smell was sweet and malty but modest. The taste was sweet but also somewhat tangy (almost a hint of tartness). Tastes of malt and cocoa were evident. The mouthfeel was smooth, creamy, and clean. The body was medium, and the carbonation feel was low. There was an initial tartness on the tongue which gave way to the sweetness. This was a good stout on tap. I liked this sample better than the bottle I had sampled in the US."
"Pours a deep ruby brown almost opaque, with a moccha highly carbonated fizzy two fingered head, and from my pour is leaving no lace at all. The aroma is a sharp slightly acidic sweetness, this is my first time grappling with a milk or cream stout so here it goes. Underneath of the harsh sourness are light coffe tones and dark chocolate from the dark roasted barley malt. The flavor at first seems a bit offensive from the rush of acidity, but I think it's growing on me after my fourth sip a little. The light flavors in the background from the dark roasted malts are definitely overshadowed from the sourness in the flavor creating an unbalance that doesn't form a happy experience with me. Nice to try a stout from a Japan micro, but I will try the Hitachino Nest wit and wheat before I count them off as bad brewers. The overall mouthfeel is a bit thin for this lucious style of a stout, and I just can't get down with this beer on any level. Drinkability is low due to the fact that the sourness overbears the rest of the characteristics of the beer therefore ruining the pleasures this beer has to offer."
"Pours a dark mahogany color, topped by a rather thin, tan head. The aroma is faily modest, sweet with notes roasted malt. The taste is odd, initially presenting a slightly sweet roasted taste, immediately followed by a tinge of sourness. The dry roasted flavor comes back for the finish, and last into the aftertaste, but it is rejoined by the slight sourness. The mouthfeel is rather light, not having much more body than a typical lager. Drinkability is not great, because it's just not that enjoyable. I guess they all can't be good beers, right?"
"I found this odd since a lot of my Asian friends are lactose intolerant, which (and I may be misinformed) is common among Asian folk. But anyway, on to the beer. It's a nice looking stout, with carbonation galore and a nice head. Boy, I think I smelled a sweet cider smell initially, but then I could detect a slight roasted malt, chocolate aroma come through. Bubbles dance on the dance which is washed away with a milky consistency. A sweet, milk chocolate flavor and kinda ends with a tinge of sourness. Each sip finishes with a milky feeling. This was a hard beer to finish the entire bottle."
"Remember when the Japanese could mimic any current or new technology and then figure out a way to make it cheaper and better? Well, it didn't happen here. What the hell were they thinking? Milk sugar in a beer? Was this an attempt to bring back distant memories, or should I say mammaries, of our early childhood? This tar colored concoction is really weird! A sour off kilter chocolate taste stands out followed by a hint of camphor and pasty malt. There are hops somewhere but if I'm not mistaken, tastes like old apple juice. The smell is strange as well - a cross between chocolate and sour balls candy. The head disappeared too quickly for me ponder their existence, but I was distracted trying to contemplate what the heck I was drinking."
"I did a double take when I tasted it. It doesn't FEEL like a stout at all, but it looks like one. So it's something of a neat trick. The word """lacto""" on the bottle implies that they're going for milky feel and taste, and that's what they get. So kudos to them on that alone. Not entirely what I'd hoped for though since I generally think of stouts as a bit more robust and, well, ballsy. Easy to drink because it's so thin. Not a terrible beer, and it is certainly unique, but I wouldn't drink it a lot."
"Dark but not completely opaque. Nice chunky tan head starts off nicely but fades fairly quickly for a stout. Not very big nose, but some cream. The flavor is some roastiness and chocolate but it's dominated by the sourness. It's also fairly sweet. The flavor is way too thin for a good stout. In fact, more malt would probably balance out the sourness, after all Bell's can make great stouts despite the sourness. The body is also on the thin side."
"F"
"Pours an almost completely opaque black with minimal hazy brown highlights at the rim. A short but creamy dark tan head soon drops to a collar. It does, howwever, last throughout the glass. The nose is somewhat limited but offers a thin roastiness and a mildly tart fruitiness. The body is light with a very fine and mild carbonation (from bottle conditioning) that's silky smooth and lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is quite intriguing, and not at all what's normally expected of a sweet stout. It starts lightly fruity - turning gently tart - and warms to reveal some dark toffee and baker's chocolate followed by the promised sweetness before finishing with a lightly dry and mildly roasty finish. It's quite unique, as are all of the Hitachino Nest beers, with an interesting twist on the style. Refreshing, fairly complex and interesting, and quite enjoyable. Certainly worth trying for those who seek unusual beers!"
"This maybe the best Japanese stout I have come across. Although, it is a bit watery, it has a lovely dark chocolate aroma. It has a high acidity which I believe makes it refreshing, which is not a characteristic found in stouts. It is definitely brewed with the Japanese consumer in mind as I have not had beers from other countries with such high acidity. Other reviewers stated they noted sour taste. Acidity is often mistaken for sour taste (in drinks such as wine and sake) especially by drinkers who are sensitive to acidity. I challenge you who think this is a sour brew to reconsider you position. Cheers!"
"My bottle may have been a bit off (maybe a few too many warm closet days), but its sweet-stout heart is still strong.  Sweet, toasty and earth stout.  Cheers!"
"Aromas of chocolate skim milk and soy. Decent retention of the latte-colored head. Wispy, watery, chocolate flavors surround mild bitterness, Mexican mole (moe-lay), and water cracker notes. Not heavy."
"If it was not for the addition of lacto sugar this brew would be nearly undrinkable. This is a beer to sip with a hearty meal and perhaps too full of a brew that you would want as a session style beer. Not a bad stab at the style."
"Notes: Kiuchi Brewery produces some outstanding beers, but this is not one of them. There's nothing """sweet""" about this beer. It's horribly balanced and the use of lacto in this beer is abusive and overwhelming to the point of making it nearly undrinkable."
"It poured a very dark brown color and formed a medium bubbly tan head that receeded quickly and left some lace.  The aroma was of malt and some chocolate.  The flavor was of malt and chocolate.  The lacto may account for the sour taste and finish to the beer.  Any hopes of this beer to be enjoyable are hurt by that aspect of the beer.  A weird concept to try with a beer."
