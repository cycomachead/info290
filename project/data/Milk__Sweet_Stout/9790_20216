3.39,-11.5,4,3.75,3.25,3,3.25,"Pours from the growler with an extremely dark brown tar-like color, verging on pitch black. The spongy, mocha head falls quickly, leaving a resilient thin layer on the surface and an appetizing collar around the glass. Pronounced cocoa powder smell with nondescript fruity esters. Faint sour breads and mild smoke in the nose. Now the first sip. Surprisingly sweet milk sugars in the front, and an equally surprising tart, sour cream taste in the finish.  The aftertaste is ashy, with lingering burnt malts. The lactose imparts a distinctive table sugar sweetness and near spoiled, sour milk tang. Any semblance of cocoa is quickly overshadowed by this competing dynamic. The ABV is modest, but I detect a small amount of fusel alcohol.  Medium mouthfeel, with snappy, crisp carbonation. Perhaps too spritzy for the style. I seem to recall this having a much creamier texture and milder carbonation when I had it from a bottle. My companions arrived at the same independent conclusion. The last time I had this (late 2013) I couldn't wait to grab another one. This time, not so much. It's possible that my palate has evolved, but I'm fairly certain this has much more to do with the carbonation. Overall, this is an ideal selection for lovers of sweet beer. I can see where the surprising tartness could throw some people for a loop, but without it, this would quickly become too sugary. I'll stick with Westbrook or Left Hand, but wouldn't pass this up if offered. I just hope it's offered in a bottle instead of a growler.","JohnnyI","Jan 07, 2015"

The impressive thing to me about this was the slight sourness to the flavor like near spoiling milk.  Real genuine milkiness from a beer.  This is a real work of art.  The mouthfeel and carbonation are also prefect.  The craving to drink another and another, just doesn't quit.","snilsen13","Jan 06, 2015"

I got some Belgian yeast like flavor which seemed odd to me because I have had this beer before and didn't get this flavor. It tastes great and has a slick, yet creamy mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is great. The drinkability is high because its not too sweet and has a relatively low abv.

The taste is just straightforward deep roasted malt with just a little sweetness from the lactose. It has a decent weight to the body and a silky feel and finish.

I love a nice head on my stouts and this beer just seems to not retain a proper head well at all. I think this affects my ability to properly judge the smell but what i can smell is a bit of toffee or caramel. The taste is surprisingly crisp for a milk stout but i don.t mind that. A great aftertaste in my opinion too some surprising biter notes in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty thin. This combines with the crisp initial taste to give this milk stout a very clean and enjoyable character. Will have it again.","StHopNick","May 20, 2014"

The smell is the typical stout aroma of dark chocolate and vanilla with a bit of coffee as well. The taste is the same mix but is actually alot more drinkable and sweet than most brews of this style. It feels slightly syrupy but with noticeable carbonation and a smoothness that I didn't really expect. Overall, I'm not a massive stout fan or anything but this seems like a really drinkable and enjoyable variation.","walkinginplace","Dec 18, 2013"

Aromas of coffee roast and bitter, cream sweetness, and hints of bittersweet chocolate. Awesomely balanced nose. Flavors are roast forward, with hints of smoke and char on a milk chocolate, cream, and bitter coffee blend. Very balanced flavors, with a slightly lactic build providing more sweetness towards the end of the palate. Thin, dry body leading to a bitter and roasted aftertaste, with a bittersweet chocolate backbone. The finish is slick and smooth, with a bitter and roasted linger remaining. Very drinkable with the lower ABV and thin body, and the flavors come across robust, almost to the point of huge. I really like this beer.","GarthDanielson","Oct 10, 2013"

Some subtle chocolate and cocoa. Hops aren't evident besides bitterness except perhaps a woody or earthy undertone. Tastes roasty with lactose milk and a nice velvety feel that coats the tongue.

The lactose takes over and you get a lot of it up front. In the back end you get hints of chocolate and it is very sweet. It goes down smooth.

While I've enjoyed many bigger milk stouts better than the Duck-Rabbit I can't quite get over how well made it really is. Nearly all the milk/sweet stouts I've had have had top shelf flavors but I just couldn't finish them due to the intense sweetness, but these guys somehow have created one all the while keeping the ridiculous sweetness and rich flavors but balancing it just enough to get me through the entire 12 oz bottle.

Absolutely phenomenal example of the style.","RobertColianni","May 03, 2013"

The smell is nice. Chocolate is the predominant note. There are other things too, but my nose is not always able to discern what and all is there. Taste is very sweet up front and a little syruppy tasting. The finish is a nice mild dark chocolate and coffee. Not a game changer, but a nice offereing.","Mojo","Apr 27, 2013"

This beer had pretty good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, and had enough flavor to hold my attention, I could drink a couple of these in a row and if I had another one I would drink it. I recommend this beer to just about anyone and if your a fan of Milk Stouts, I think this is a must try and worth the effort to obtain. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma and the taste, they were right where they should be at for the style and I liked them a lot. What I liked least about this beer was the Mouthfeel, it was pretty much the only downfall of this beer and if it was a little thicker and less carbonated it would be pretty close to perfect. I would for sure buy this again but Duck-Rabbit isn't distributed in Michigan so who knows when I will have the chance to try to this beer again. I was pretty impressed with this beer and it made for a great first impression for this brewery, I am glad this beer didn't disappoint as I was really looking forward to trying it and I was happy that it lived up to my expectations. Good job Duck-Rabbit this was one awesome beer and you can bet that I will be searching out more of your brews, I see good things in the future for this brewery.

The flavor wasn't as bold or robust as some others within the style, but was still a delicious blend of chocolate and roasty character.

Not bad- and pretty much on point for the style. Taste is exactly the same as the nose. Full bodied feel for the style- smooth like silk w/ a mild hop bitterness/coffee bitterness in the background.

Lots of roasted malt and some coffee in the nose, milk chocolate makes its presence as well. Robust, rich and roasty taste, coffee, chocolate malts, and ginger root merge together nicely. Nice mild and creamy sweetness, not too overwhelming like many other milk stouts out there. Bit of tobacco as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with mild carbonation.

3.75,-2.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Duck Rabbit Milk Stout pours jet black, with just under two fingers of caramel colored foam crowning it. Retention is alright, the head cuts itself in half pretty quickly, but lingers for a long time. The ring of lacing left around the top of the glass isn't quite solid, but it's pretty full and nice looking nonetheless. The nose is very heavy on coffee and vanilla, with those two coming together to smell like coffee that's had a healthy bit of cream added to it. The flavor is again centered around coffee and vanilla, but they don't integrate and fill my palate as well as they do in the aroma. The flavor comes across as a little too dry, and there's a spot mid palate that's just begging for a little bit of chocolate that never comes. Despite the somewhat dry flavor, the body itself is nice and full. The carbonation's just a little too active for it's own good though, taking away from the malty center of the beer at times. In general I've really liked the Duck Rabbit beers I've had, and while the Milk Stout is good, the high expectations I have for their beers now weren't quite met.","axeman9182","Beers"

A small amount of wet lacing clings to the glass. Smell is of white cane sugar, roasted malt, coffee grounds, and some chocolate. Taste is similar, with some sugar in the front, the coffee and chocolate in the middle, and some roastiness (almost a char flavor) on the finish. Perhaps a touch of vanilla on the exhale as well. Not very complex, as all the flavors seem to be right up front, but still enjoyable. Mouth is very smooth, with the carbonation dancing nicely off the tongue.

Poured in to a wine glass, Duck Rabbit Milk Stout pours out a black color, with brown hues at the top of the glass, towards the head, which is about an inch thick. The nose is soft, with notes of lactose, milk chocolate, aspirin, and a small hint of coffee bean. Smooth drinking here, the body is like silk, and goes down incredibly easy. Not too thick either, making it a beer you can put two to three back of. This is a style that I rarely buy, but when I do, I am reminded of what I am missing out on.

A punch in the face of the lactic sweetness, roasted malts and chocolate. Quite a bit going on as it carries through, with hints of caramel, vanilla, coffee, cream... Finishes with a really clear, dead on flavor that is really pleasing. Best flavor and complexity of a milk stout I can recall having (assuming we don't count Surly 4). The mouthfeel is pretty creamy for a beer of this size. Overall, I am really impressed. I am always really impressed when beers under 6% can bring the flavor and this is definitely one of them.

It was well bittered with notes of dark rum, milk chocolate, iced coffee, with the perfect amount of sweetness and a full bodied creamy texture.

You definitely get the coffee flavor at first, followed by a rich caramel, and ending with a slightly bitter semi-sweet dark chocolate.

Taste is more of the same as a good mix of malts hit the tongue as roasted malts dominate but are balanced w/ dark chocolate, caramel a touch of biscuit.

Very minimal sweetness which is what I like with this style opposed to the overly lactose impregnated messes of sweetness that distracts from the other flavors. Somewhat of a mineral character throughout the flavor along with a touch of hops and a bit of yeast. Medium to light feel with a moderate amount of carb.

In the mouth it's medium-bodied with a wiry, wound-up carbonation which more or less keeps things from spreading too broadly. Dry cocoa powder, malt, caramel and coffee candy, vanilla bean, it offers a breadth of similar flavors without excess sweetness. Not roasty, at times perhaps some nuttiness.

Alcohol, malt, caramel, vanilla, and smokiness intertwined. The initial sip is a bit edgy with almost a sour note on the finish. Subsequent sips reveal more peat flavor, almost like a wee heavy. The sweetness gradually builds, but the smoke-tinged malt remains. Just enough bitterness to cleanse the palate. Mouthfeel is smooth, but not heavy.

It tastes like milk chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of coffee and also a smoky flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it seems thin for a stout but it's a bit creamy and coating and has good carbonation.

Seems very porterish, but has a super swet sugary note maybe from the addition of lactose? Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied not as heavy or full of girth as some of their other offerings. I went in reverse trying Duck Rabbit beers, I had the Baltic Porter and Barleywine first and and just now I'm trying the Milk Stout. Carbonation was soft and even pretty tame in a matter of fact.

A small 1cm head rises, then disappears very quickly. No lacing to speak of. The smell at first is pure carbonation, but then you catch a bit of sweetness, mixed in with a tiny bit of an estery smell. If you try, you can smell a bit of the roasted malts. The taste is quite like the smell. You get a mouthful of sweetness which is kept in check by esters. There's a tiny taste of chocolate malt and very little presence of roasted barley. I my opinion, the roasted barley would serve as a better balancer than the estery taste, but I've found a few of these beers to be a bit more estery than expected. But this one still tastes nice, there's even a tiny taste of dryness in the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and rich, with decent complexity and nice carbonation even without any head. It's pretty easy to drink, but not an everyday beer. A decent attempt, and it kind of reminds me of a first go at a homebrewed milk stout, with room for improvement.","taylorhamrick","Feb 16, 2009"

There is a substantial roasted grainy expresso after-texture. Full flavored, the roasted taste of coffee dominates but you can again imagine burnt milk because it has a sweetness to it.

It's pretty sweet up front. Lots of chocolate and cream. Dark chocolate comes in again. Some dark fruits also add depth. An excellent hop presence enters in the finish, making it creamy yet slightly dry at times. Quite the drinkable brew for the style.

The head was initially very big but fell really quickly. The aroma reminds me of barbecue. There is a big smokey presence in there along with dark roasted malts and some chocolate. Again, this aroma isn't quite what I expect for the style. Roast is up front and dominating in this beer. There is a bit of smoke in there and this still reminds me of barbecue a bit. The lactose sweetness that essentially defines the style is also definitely there; in fact it is a bit too sweet for me. The body is the only thing that is dead on; decently heavy but not too much.

In taste, there is even more coffee, the lactose quite nice in counterpoint, again chocolate is nice, but this coffee and lactose battling it out is kind of weird, kind of good.

Mouthfeel is a little thin and overcarbonated. Finishes with a little bitterness. Overall not a bad brew. I think top to bottom though the duck rabbit brews have been somewhat of a dissapointment.

It pours a dark brown almost black with a decent head that fades and good lacing. The nose is milky and sweet with just a touch of sour grain. The taste is equally as milky and sweet with definite chocolate notes blended well with the milkiness. The mouthfeel is milky and just a little sticky. This version is almost a dessert rather than a beer, which hurts its drinkability. I can't imagine wanting more than one of these at a time.","Georgiabeer","Jul 09, 2007"

For beers under 6% Abv, Duck Rabbit beers certainly pack a lot of flavor. Much like all Duck Rabbit beers, this was a very tasty ale.

Smell is a little fruity with licorice. Flavors of roasted malt, oak, cofee. Alcohol comes through in waves and noticeable for a fairly low ABV.

I caught notes of cocoa chocolate and a light smokiness and that was without even leaning in. In doing so, I also captured toffee and coffee. Perfect for mid-morning on a snow day! The color was a deep, dark brown with garnet highlights. The mouthfeel was medium to thick and I got a lot of the chocolate and toffee mix on the tongue, which reminded me of a Heath bar.

Poured into a nonic, this is stout is lighter in color than others of its variety, dark cola-brown with russet highlights and a modest but dense sand-colored head. Sourish black malt aromas mix with a slight essence of vanilla along with a soft cocoa scent all with a bit of mineral twang swirling through it. Some rather faint cocoa powder comes through in the taste, with a bit of vanilla yogurt sourness. Otherwise this is fairly roasty and dry, almost like a porter. In fact, I had to check the label on the bottle to make sure I was reviewing the correct Duck-Rabbit beer, as I also have a couple newly-acquired bottles of their porter. That said, this is a fine-tasting brew, that feels full in the mouth with a tiny bit of sharp carbonation bite at the finish, leaving an overall impression of dryness on the palate.

A bit of milk chocolate in the taste, but a bitter chocolate taste dominated. Finished medium dry with no hops detectable anywhere. This is certainly unbalanced to the side of malt. Good.

A heavy cream, or sweet cream, aroma is present, with burnt undertones. The one at the beginning of the week came across creamy smooth and a little heavy on the tongue, while the later one came out just as creamy smooth, but not as heavy (not as sweet as the previous one also).

3.97,3.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"While not nearly as flashy or bold as other stouts, its still a good beer, that with a little tweaking, could make for a really great milk stout.","ChainGangGuy","Oct 14, 2005"
4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Being a lover of Milk Stouts, I had to try this one. It looks creamy and opaque black with a thin light tan head that accompanied the last sip. The aromas are of black and chocolate malt and a hint of lactose to add a complex souring. The flavors are strong bittersweet without being grainy. Light chocolate and coffee flavors rise out of the barley malt showing mild astringency and lactic sweetness and sourness. Light hops show in the finish. The body is firm and quite creamy. The finish is similar but shows a little graininess and harshness, albeit light. All in all, better than most, but I have had much better.","BEERchitect","Oct 12, 2005"

A thinking man's stout, to be certain. I'd buy it again, but won't break any land speed records to do it.","beerphilosopher","Sep 24, 2005"
3.65,-4.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Body thickness could be a bit more beefed up, but the subtle impartation of hops and lactose sweetness, combined with less acridity than usual for the style, makes this a nice treat, though not really sessionable.","ism","Sep 23, 2005"

4.1,7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours at what appears to be a rich black color but after holding it up to the light, its a deep deep ruby. The smell is of roasted malts,hints of chocolate, coffee, and some kind of nut, cant quite put my finger on it. on the pour the head forms small and disappears pretty quickly. Super malty with maybe a hint of underlying hops. It tastes just like it smells the coffee taste really takes over. Over all I would say this is a very nice stout, will buy again for sure.","charlottebeerguy","Aug 15, 2005"
3.6,-6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,"Been wanting to try something from this brewery for a while. Pours a dark brown color with a slight head. No lace. Nose is slightly toasted and sweet. Flavor is full of milk and dark chocolate. Slight toffee and caramel too. Nice subtle bitter finish. Just a tad short of heavy on the toasted malts. Some heft to this beer with a very full flavor. However, the richness of this beer could be a bit exhausting after a bit.","MuddyFeet","Jul 30, 2005"

4.24,10.7,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head above the dark brownish burgundy brew. Head quickly fades to a scant layer of bubbles, and lacing is average. Aroma is sweet, creamy dark malts, almost exactly what I was looking for here. Taste is sweet dark malts, with little to no bitterness, seemingly due to the added sugar, which is as it should be. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent, with smoothness that just invites another mouthful, or two, or bottle. Check it out.","ppoitras","Beers"
3.86,0.8,3,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Black body with a small light tan head that drops quickly. No remnants of that head are left on the glass. Big roasted malt notes in the aroma. Also a bit of dark chocolate and a light sourness. Flavor starts off sweet with chocolate and roasted malts. Light creamy sourness plays well in it. Finishes on a sweet toasty note. Body is medium and pretty creamy and smooth. This has enough going for it that I could have a few in a session. Solid example of the style all around. Thanks goes to my buddy Jason for the bottles.","meathookjones","0"

3.28,-14.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Slight 1/4 inch light tan head. Semi dark brown in color with a tint of red. Aromas of roast and a creamy lactose smell, not much more. Flavors of the same, earthy and roasty. Well carbonated, somewhat average mouthfeel, and a long aftertaste of roast flavor. Nothing extravagant anywhere with this beer, but well made and drinkable in any case. A good idea to try, but I wont be buying again anytime soon.","blackie","May 02, 2005"
3.94,2.9,3,4,4,4,4,"Noticeably thin on the pour, appearance somewhat akin to Pepsi. Nice roasty, lactic aroma with notes of coffee, milk chocolate and candy sugar. Starts off with a milky sweetness, which blends nicely into the darker, roastier baking chocolate flavors. Hop bitterness is noticeable in the finish as well, keeping this pretty fairly balanced. Has a mild touch of carbonation; any more and this would be some kind of odd chocolate soda. I will say that I enjoy the flavor on this one a lot. Thicken it up a bit into ""man-stout"" levels and it's really a nice brew. A good sweeter dessert stout...a session stout, if there is such a thing.","IrishRedRock","Apr 11, 2005"

3.92,2.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"On tap at the Hickory Hops Fest on April 9, 2005. Had a couple of sampler glasses of this one, which I really enjoyed. Appearance is deep brown, essentially opaque, with a quickly vanishing beige head. Some patchy lace is left on the glass, but it's a bit difficult to judge overall appearance from the small glasses. Aroma is nice, with lots of burnt roast malt character tempered by carob and some sweet smelling lacto aromas. Mouthfeel is light bodied for a stout, but carbonation is good. Taste mirrors the aroma, with bitter dark roasted malts, a hint of nuttiness, and some sweet lactose. Hops are difficult to discern, and a more assertive hops profile would benefit this one quite a bit. Finishes with a dark roasty malt bitterness that lasts several minutes. Very well done for a sweet stout. I look forward to sampling the bottled version of this, as it's this small brewery's biggest seller.","merlin48","Jan 08, 2005"
4.24,10.7,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a deep opaque black color with an offwhite bubbly head that dissipated so quickly I almost forgot it had one. Aromas are a mix of roast and smoke like tones, along with a slight lactic note and a bit of cocoa. For taste this one was quite a surprise. After being somewhat dissapointed by the appearance of this brew there was a nice intermingling of flavors. They started of slightly sweet with a deep chocolate tone to it. Following there was a nice mix between the roasty flavors and the lactic milky bits to this brew. The finish was sweet and just had a slight hint of astringency and smoke that balanced things out quite nicely. The body to this brew was fairly light but there was a nice creaminess to it. Overall a nice tasting brew but they really need to get their problems with their head retention fixed a bit.","bigbeerdrinka","Dec 18, 2004"
2.87,-25.1,2.5,3,3,3,2.5,"I received this beer in a trade with a gentleman in North Carolina. I was very much looking forward to tasting this beer. IT pours a dark brown with yellow and red hues in it and pretty much no head. For a stout it was certainly missing the impenatrable dark color and even a decent head on top. The nose is roasty with sweet malt scents and caramel malt. The flavor is watery up front but it is followed by a burnt almond flavor in the middle along with chocolate and a floral hoppiness at the end. THe hps could have redeemed some of this beer but they are just not seductive enough in flavor or aroma to do the job. There is also a bit of a sandy/earthy character to it. Overall this beer is just not that good.","BrewMaster","Dec 03, 2004"
3.52,-8.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours deep reddish black, not as dark as some other stouts. Moderate bone head quickly fizzles into a thin ring, sparse lace. Aromas of choc malt, molasses, peat, and caramel. Flavor is chocolate and coffee, with a nice, lingering charred malt roastinesss. Thin bodied and light on the palate, too light. I like a little more meatiness in a stout. OK overall, but I won't be writing home about it.","AlexJ","Nov 13, 2004"

3.65,-4.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep, dark black that allows just the faintest bit of light to shine through. Small tan head doesn't stick around for long. Aroma of rich roasted malt, mocha, and briny, peaty smokiness. Medium body is slightly chewy. Palate is dominated by roasted malt up front, mellowing into a marginally malty sweetness typical of a milk stout. Decent and sturdy, although something is missing for this to be a great beer.","ElGordo","Beers"
