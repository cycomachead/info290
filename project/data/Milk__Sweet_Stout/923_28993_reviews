"Pours a pitch black in color with no head at all. Some very minor spotty lacing is seen but not much. The aroma is of dark roasted malts with a sweetness for the most part. More going on with the taste as there is some chocolate with some very light spice. Goes down very smooth and not harsh or bitter aftertaste at all but finished slightly dry. Medium-bodied with almost no carbonation which is actually typical for most milk Stouts. Overall, a tasty brew."
"Great beer. Smooth lots of flavor. Loved it."

"A lackluster milk stout with little visual appeal other than the body color and a somewhat strange, almost lightweight stout flavor. Drinkable and somewhat interesting, but hardly a must-have beer."

"Cheers!"

"Bottom line: A solid beer that I really enjoyed. I would buy this again and recommend to those who enjoy stouts and other malt forward beers."

"12 oz bottle pours an opaque black with quickly dissapating tan head. Aroma is smokey dark malt with coffee and chocolate. Taste is coffee, chocolate, with distant dark fruit. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth with wet finish. Overall a competent milk stout."

"I thought this one was pretty decent overall. Not my favorite of the style, but very drinkable, tasty, and I'd totally have this one again."
"O: Very nice beer. Very smooth and tasty. Perhaps slightly too sweet."
""
""
"Tasty - a decent milk stout that goes down a treat. Looks the part, with a superb aroma of roasted malt and a good flavour that possesses a delicate sweetness. The body could use improvement; thicker and more velvety is the way to go. Overall though, a nice brew that hits the spot. I'd have one again - worth sampling if you come across it."

"O - Really nice sweet stout. Usually a style I stay away from but this one was big on flavor and kept the sweetness modest. Very drinkable and not too much body. Carbonation was spot on. Great example of the style."

"Overall, Steel Toe Stout is pretty solid. While I doubt I'd actively seek it out again, I wouldn't mind giving it another shake."

"O - Overall it's a nice milk stout. I wouldn't recommend this for a first time milk stout drinker but I will have it again for sure."
""
""
""
"Overall - pretty darn decent brew. Interesting to think about, and good-tasting."
"Overall- Good beer. One of the better milk stouts that I've had."
""
""
"Pours black with a half thumbs width mocha head that quickly recedes. A rich milk chocolate aroma filled with some lactose and roast. Tastes like roasted chocolate milk with a touch of bitterness in the finish. A wonderfully creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a great milk stout. Right up there with the best of them without a doubt."

"Top milk stout."

"this is a nice session stout, sweet and light. i would have considered it a porter since it's so light - i prefer my stouts creamy at least which this had barely any of. like i said, it somehow worked with the mellowness of the flavors, however it could use a bit of work in appearance as well."
"A good beer on rainy coldish night."
""
"Appearance is deep brown, good clarity. Half-inch of tan foam that dissipates into a skein. Minimal lacing. Smell is roasty, faint milk, cola, light roast coffee. Taste is lightly sweet with mild coffee, medium chocolate, lactose. Decently smooth. Mouthfeel is medium light, mild carbonation. Fairly clean finish. Enjoyable."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a dark brown color, produced a decent creamy beige head. Average retention and lacing left on the glass. The aroma consisted of chocolate and roasted malt. Medium in body, this Milk Stout had a base of roasted malt, milk chocolate and was sweet throughout. Nice session beer, this is not my favorite Milk Stout that I have tried to date, but it is a decent example of the style. Prost!"

""

"Not bad. Steel Toe’s a solid, drinkable stout."
""
"Overall – I enjoyed this beer, good representation of the style. I would drink it again for sure, although I don’t think I will buy it again. It is certainly worth a try though, and there are plenty of folks out there who I am sure love it! Good brew overall."

"12 ounce bottle courtesy scray24 poured into a pint glass. Darkest brown with a modest tan head. Aroma is sweet, velvety chocolate coupled with an inviting fresh-baked bread character. Simple stout flavor with medium roastedness, dark chocolate, and a telltale lactose character. A little low in carbonation, which actually furthers the whole milkiness profile. Could stand a little more robustness but this is extremely drinkable in its current state. A real textbook milk stout."

"Ska Steel Toe Milk Stout: Here is a beer brewed in Durango, Colorado, which would be great place to live. I am enjoying a porter/stout cycle, and decided to try this Ska product. The body is jet black with a thin tan head that fades quickly. A great aroma comes off of this beer, with a host of notes besides roast malt. The Steel Toe goes down easily, with a big flavor of rock candy and a smoky aftertaste. This beer is sweeter and smoother than other stouts I have tried, which is what I gather one should expect from a milk stout. And the Ska Steel Toe Milk Stout delivers."

"Overall, very drinkable and enjoyable. Rich, complex, but one and done cuz its a little too sweet and cloying."
"12 ounce bottle, no bottle date notched. Pours crystal clear dark brown color with a fairly dense 1-2 finger light tan head with nice retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap that sticks around. A small bit of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, and spicy hops. Nice and standard stout aromas with nice strength. Taste of milk chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, coffee, and light spiciness. Fair amount coffee-like bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, molasses, creaminess, and spiciness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel and smooth drinking. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming after the finish. Overall a very nice and drinkable sweet stout; though it wasn’t as sweet as I was expecting. Nice balance overall though."

"Poured into a standard pint glass. The beer is a dark cola color. The head starts out dark tan and rather small, then dissipates to virtually nothing. Minimal lacing. There is an aroma of coffee and roasted malts. They don't mislabel this beer, it's definitely a sweet stout. The sweetness comes through at the beginning with the burnt malt and dry bitter chocolate taste. It finishes dry. The mouthfeel gets knocked because this beer is watery, and feels like a cola to me. Overall, I wanted to like this beer, but it just didn't add up to much. With a name like """Steel Toe""" I'd expect something a little more ... solid. I'm glad I didn't buy a sixer."
"O: Good, not great. Love the nitro. Amazing mouthfeel even though a bit light."
"Overall Drinkability - Decent example of the style. May not be the best option available, but if it's the only milk stout in your area, you won't be disappointed."
"Poured more of a dark brown than black with some ruby highlights,a thinner mocha colored head atop.Sweet lactose and caramel aromas along with dark roast and some roasted nut.Nice and smooth feel with little carbonation,sugary flavors upfront wih caramel and molasses,a nice drying roastiness in the finish.Not overly complex but its smooth and pretty flavorful."
"This stout is just what the label says, a working class milk stout. Great for the end of a hard day."
"Overall: On a positive note, the flavors and body of this beer are great. On the flip side, however, the serious lack of carbonation (not to mention any foam) is a big problem. The beer reminds me of a good homebrew that I've tasted prior to racking to the bottling bucket-- it's just not a finished product. If you can find it adequately-carbonated on draught, try it. Otherwise, I'd recommend avoiding this one."
"pours an abyssal midnight black letting absolutly no light through. a quarter inch mocha head. smells of dark roasted malts and alcohol. taste is so smooth, with a delicate mouthfeel expanding to every corner slowly and richly. this beer even has a bit of hop bitterness in the finish. not over the top sweet like some of these can be, very drinkable. fantastic!"
"Out of bottle just a bit cooler than room temp. Poured into a pint glass. Slight creamy head that disappeared to thin layer with light lacing. Color is super dark brown. Almost no light passing through. Smell is awesome. Chocolate maltiness with a starbucks coffeehouse smell. Taste is good with same choc maltiness with hint of cream and breadiness. Overall a pretty good brew. Good mellow aftertaste."
"The 2011 Bachelor Party Extravaganza's keepin' Local Option bumpin', y'all! This proof pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of oatmeal foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate powder, a touch of molasses, and a vein of vanilla. The taste brings in more of the same, though the roast is muted a bit, and the molasses has dropped out almost altogether. Still, this stuff tastes pretty nice. The body is a straight medium, with a lovely nitrogenation and a subsequently really smooth feel. Overall, a rather tasty little stout, one that surely benefits from its straightforward recipe (and the nitro-tap treatment)."
"OVERALL: At 5.4% this is a very sessionable beer and packs a ton of flavor into a beer without too much alcohol in it. It is very drinkable as well. I will be reaching for this again sometime very soon."
"Sweeter and deeper in its chocolate tones than most milk stouts, the Ska Brewing Steel Toe Milk Stout is almost a dessert substitute. The coal black black body hints at the deep, enveloping chocolate flavors insude. In the nose I find scents of freshly unwrapped premium chocolate (the kind you cringe when buying, even if it’s for a special occasion) with chocolate malt and a nice, rich dairy freshness in the nose. The flavor is oozing with even more chocolate, more sweet than bitter, and recalls slices of decadent chocolate cake had at fancy dinners in the past. The boisterous carbonation washes away the flavors in the aftertaste, leaving behind a short but very intense burst of chocolate astringency. Milk stouts are engineered with lactose sugar in mind, but the Steel Toe is a special example of just how sweet a deep, dark beer can get with a heady dose of lactose. I never find it cloying, but I also know that a drink that sweet doesn’t seem like a beer sometimes. All the same, darn good drinking, and practically begging to be paired with a nice vanilla ice cream."
"o- A fine milk stout. Well balanced and easy drinking."
"O- I've had better milk stouts but also worse. This one just didn't have a lot behind it to really make me think highly of it. It was decent and drinkable, but could have been better; especially if the tartness wouldn't have been so prominent for first half of the glass."
"O - This brew is awesome! Definitely the best Milk Stout I've ever had. Super solid, creamy, and rich; just like the nose represents. This is an awesome, well-rounded brew. A must try if you're able. Top of it's class."
"Worth trying this at a good price point."
"Should have got more than one bottle of this..."
"For me, the mouthfeel is the best quality of a milk stout, and this is no exception. The body is creamy and smooth. A very chewy texture, though goes down lighter than expected."
"Enjoy!"
"O - all night drink."
"D - Easy drinking milk stout for the working man. You could easily knock these back, but I tend to stop at one or two in a session."
"D - pretty solid stout here. Nothing flashy, fits the style and has decent drinkability. I only bought a single of this and wasn't too upset about not having another on reserve. I would definitely drink it again, though."
"D) A decent stout. I'd drink another."
"Quite drinkable, especially for the price."
"Steel Toe Working Class Stout is more American stout than milk/sweet stout. Ska knows dark beer. Ten Pin Porter! and Nefarious Ten Pin Imperial Porter as delicious as well. Worth a look."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a deep brown/black with a thin off white head. Deep chocolate malt aroma. More chocolate malt in the flavor. Medium bodied. Smooth mouthfeel. Nice sweet finish. Very drinkable. If you like sweet stout, you should check this one out. Solid."
"(Reviewed August 31, 2010.)"
"D - definitely drinkable, almost to the point of being a sessionable stout. Not too sweet, not at all dry, but there are better examples of the style."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight oatmeal, hops, hint of alcohol, and slight roasted malt. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness noticeable. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, roasted malt, hint of coffee, and a hint of dark citrus. Overall, the sweetness is present in aroma and the initial taste. That quickly abates, and what is left is reminiscent of a Baltic Porter."
"Drinkability: Overall, I give this one credit where it's due and believe that it's definitely better than most other milk stouts that I've had; makes for a nice dessert with that creamy and sweet flavor set."
"This is a medium bodied brew with moderate carbonation. Quite drinkable, there is no problem finishing the glass. However, it is a bit too forward with the lactose sweetness. More of the roasted grains would have been much more enjoyable with the lactose being a bit more faint instead of being so forward in the taste."
"Taste, enjoyable, hits the smoothness of style, while not compromising any of the chewiness and dark roast resulting in a solid, yet smooth stout. Chocolate stands tall as well. Never massive, a great sessionesque stout for the weekdays. Drank these while skiing mostly."
"D: Not a trainwreck of a beer, but comparing this to the wonderful Left Hand Milk Stout, it's playing in the minors."
"D - very quaffable and pleasantly smooth. A workingman's beer for sure."
"I don't know what took me so long to finally drink this beer. I'm definitely glad I did and it looks like I'll have to find more soon."
"D - This is a fine milk stout. Good flavor and very easy drinking."
"Overall, I liked this stout - lots of nice roast and coffee. A nice surprise. I'll have to pick up more of this."
"Drinkability: This is a solid beer, but not fantastic. I'd drink more than one."
"D: A nice drinkable beer. Nothing super special, but good overall."
"Drinkability= High. I poured this beer, then I got a phone call, took it outside and in 10 min I looked down and it was gone. Enjoyed it to the last drop."
"D- Exceptional to say the least, when I'm not experimenting with specialty porters and stouts this will be my go to every day beer."
"D: Very flavorful and balanced. Wonderful mouthfeel."
"D - Pretty decent stout although not as """creamy""" as I would have expected."
"Out of the bottle and into my glass this one was a dark, nearly opaque brown with a tan head. Decent retention but good lacing. Aromas of sweet malts and chocolate with a bit of herbal hops. The flavors were chocolate, malt and something creamy or milky. Definitely a milk stout with the sweetness. Good, but limited in depth. Decent body could be richer and heavier. Moderate carbonation could be smoother too."
"D- Though I have had this in the past and liked it maybe this wasn't such a good batch. I'm just unsure and will have to try another..."
"I could easily drink a few of these per sitting, although I prefer heavier stouts."
"The body is not good. Really for a sweet stout/milk stout, I want more of a lactic and sweeter flavor. This is more wispy and watery. Very disappointing, more of a dry coffee finish. No off flavors but lack of body."
"All in all, another nice brew from SKA."
"Edit: I got out another one and a really slopped it in the glass...got a bout a 1""" head that held for a minuite or two."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, slightly filling but find me a stout that isnt, nice kick, excellent representation of style. I normally dont get revved up about too many stouts, but this is definitely one of them. If were going to go with a beer in this style, Id certainly look toward this one as on of the first choices."
"Drinkability- This beer has all the elements to be delicious but comes up just short. Im going to assume that its a bit past its prime since it was bottled almost 3 years ago. Id really like to try a fresh bottle and bet it would be pretty damn tasty. Big thanks to jhammerly for this brew!"
"One of the few session stouts that I have tasted."
"D - Much more drinkable then simular sweet stouts"
"D: A decent stout, but it doesn't rise above it's brethren."
"Body is pitch black with a thin cafe au lait head and no lacing. Smells of coffee, chocolate, artificial cherry, and really is the typical sweet stout in the nose. Flavors are big on the chocolate and light roast coffee except there comes a fantastic drying in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin to moderate in weight and slightly slick. Carbonation is mellow. This is a solid beer, but I grew tired of it by the end. I really don't think I would like this fresh, as I assume the dryness comes from the age put on this bottle. I'd imagine a fresh example would be your typical cloyingly sweet stout."
"Drinkability: An OK milk stout but it would be a lot better without the sour notes"
"Drinkability: Tootsie Rolls and Milk Duds together in an easy drinking beer - what's not appealing about that?"
"drinkable?: yep. cause its so thin and weak"
"Drinkablility is pretty good. Yet another session worthy brew from Ska. A decent milk / sweet stout... but there are better examples out there."
"Thank you Hopdog."
"For what it's worth to you Coloradans, I think this is a better offering of a milk stout than Left Hand's that got a really high review in a certain magazine."
"12 ounce bottle."
"D- had some flavor, strong yummy scents, but was not a fun drinking experience at all. As always, i'd be willing to give this brew another try, but i'm not going to inconvience myself for it. This is my 2nd brew from Ska, and i have to say i'm very disappointed."
"A little watery on the feel, not bad. Pretty in keeping"
"Drinks too easy, very nice example of a milkstout, yum"
"The taste I lightly sweet, but quickly moves to a roasted grain tartness and it finishes with a note that is dominated by the husky grain not found in the nose. Notes of toasted, biscuit-like malt is quite prominent as well. Ample notes of chocolate help to round out the acidity and husky grain astringency. This beer is quite light on the palate, it makes for an easy quaffer and even the husky note does not linger for all that long. This is an enjoyable brew, an easy sipper that is good for a couple pints. While it is a bit out of balance, like most of the other breweries products, It is one of the better beers from them that I have had. For some reason the flavors just work here."
