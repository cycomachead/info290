A glass of chocolate milk with a strong of chocolate syrup. Some softer coffee flavors. Coffee with a lot of cream. Lactose. Body is light but the feel is creamy.

Upon sipping, a delicious smokiness surprised me because I did not detect it in the aroma. A rich chocolaty flavor with a sweet finish. Feels very light and smooth for such a dark beer.

It pours a straight black-brown topped by a finger of khaki foam.  The nose confirms the name, comprising cocoa powder, mild roasted malts, and a touch of sweet coffee for the ever-loving sake of it.  The taste brings in more of the same, the milk chocolate character shining in all its cocoa-y glory.  The body is a lithe-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel.  Overall, a rather tasty stout, one I'll likely purchase several times in the near future.  Get some.","TMoney2591","Sep 07, 2014"

Smells like a decadent candy bar, kind of reminds me of southern tier's choklat. Taste is not as flavorful and full of chocolate as the nose promises. Plenty of roast present, mild bitterness, dry finish. Mouthfeel is thin with moderate carbonation. Overall, the nose is great, the flavor isn't bad, just falls short of what I was hoping for based on the aroma.","homebrew311","Jun 29, 2014"
