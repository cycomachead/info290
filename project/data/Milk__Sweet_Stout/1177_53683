Taste is like the aroma, all I can think of is this is a like a liquefied Mounds bar, with minimal sweetness. Absolutely delicious. Each drink is as exciting as the first. An amazing beer. Carbonation is light which works well for this beer, body is silky but not at all overpowering. This is easily the best milk stout I have had. Well worth the hype.

4.42,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Big thanks goes out to caSSino for sharing this one during the One Year Anniversary of My Wreck Tasting and to MBrausen for sending it to him! Served from growler into a Crooked Stave ‘Crooked Line’ tulip. Poured pitch black with a one finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, coconut, and cream. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk, cream, coconut, subtle roasted malt, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. As stated in a few other reviews including aasher who was drinking off the same growler, think Mounds. That pretty much nails the aroma almost exactly. The flavor was very nice as well with a very nice sweetness aspect going on. Loads of coconut going on in both areas. Wish it would have been a little thicker on the mouthfeel to take it up another notch. Very well done brew that I would suggest to any craft beer veteran or n00bie alike.","thagr81us","Nov 17, 2012"

Finishes too sweet, extremely cloying, yet good carbonation. I couldn’t finish even half of my pint. This beer is far too sweet. I have a feeling a 5 ounce glass would have been a much better serving size, but even that might be a bit much even for a dessert beer.

This has much more coconut flavor than Maui CoCoNut Porter. Delicious. The mouthfeel is disappointing - really thin and light.

4.27,-3.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"O - Awesome beer. The sweet milk stout body works well with the coconut and dark roast to form an awesome beer. This is easily the best coconut beer I have ever had.","orangesol","Nov 09, 2011"

4.25,-4.3,4.5,4.5,4,5,4,"This is a medium bodied brew with an exceptionally smooth feel. It is lightly carbonated and easy drinking if sweet brews are your thing. There was seemingly no alcohol heat here, just a faint twang of alcohol flavoring. Not really roasted or grainy, this was seriously a beer version of mounds candy bars. If you enjoy that sort of chocolate candy approach to this style, this is an absolute must try. This was one of the more memorable and unique brews I have had in awhile. While it was very enjoyable, I couldn't see myself drinking very much of this before the sweetness got to me. Diabetics beware.","stakem","Nov 05, 2011"

4.62,4.1,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5," The taste is everything you expect after smelling the coconut after a quick swirl of the glass. There is a nice nutty element and toasty tinges which give a sweet vanilla backing to the coconuts almost floral flavor, very clean and has a moderate level of sweetness to achieve a nice balance. This is more about the coconut than the base stout which is a little lost in all the coconut flavor, but I enjoyed the way it came together and this is definitely a great beer, worth trying if you enjoy coconut.","Slatetank","Oct 30, 2011"

4.54,2.3,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Point blank. If you don't like coconut I suggest passing on this. If you do like it, I would say this is like a liquid Mounds Bar. Truly wonderful.","TheDudeRules","Mar 23, 2011"

4.38,-1.4,5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"This is a very good beer that is extremely smooth and silky! The lactose makes a nice heavier body and definitely adds some stickiness to your lips.

4.3,-3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"What a great beer. I finally opened my growler from Oct and it let out a nice little hiss as it opened. Pours jet black and viscous with next to zero head. I had this one on tap when it came out too and I don't remember it having much of a head at that point either. Smells of sweet coconut and a bit of roasted malt. The flavor is an explosion, yet so smooth. I think it was even better out of the growler with a couple of month on it. The coconut took a small step back and allowed the chocolatly malt and roasted flavors to take a stronger part in the flavor. People describe it as drinking a Mounds bar and it's not too far from the truth. This thing simply coats your mouth and envelops all of your senses with a roasted chocolate/coconut/vanilla smootheness. I could drink this on and on - it's sweet but not overly so. A growler might be a bit much in a day but I didn't want to waste any of this delicious treat.","plumcrazyfx","Dec 15, 2010"
4.37,-1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"The chocolate and bourbon characteristics come out really well in the flavor. Ultra smooth and tasty. Good notes of vanilla and a bit of roast as well as some light cherry and toasted coconut. Really enjoying this. Very nice feel between the bourbon and a bit of booze. Perfect carbonation level. A really nice brew that grew on me as it warmed up and as I went through a few small glasses. Well done, TH.","Thorpe429","Dec 15, 2010"

4.47,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I wasn't expecting to enjoy this beer nearly as much as I did. A very good base stout is key here as is the fact that the coconut influence isn't overpowering. A huge flavor profile in a relatively small ABV that is well worth a shot.","glid02","Nov 24, 2010"
4.47,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The palate shows a touch more complexity, though it's still dominated by sweet coconut and milk chocolate. The finish brings flavors of licorice and roasted malt that help balance the initial blast of sweetness, but it's decidedly a dessert beer. That said, it never became cloying, even after several pours.","largadeer","Beers"

I can't give it a 5 on drinkability only because I could never see drinking more than one or two of these in a sitting. I will buy it again and again if I can find it. I only wish it came in bottles rather than a whole growler.","brewdoc75","Nov 17, 2010"

3.78,-14.9,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"On-tap at Town Hall Tap. Yup, it sure does taste like a Mounds bar. The coconut character was richer with mild toasted notes over the sweet candy flavors. I don't get much milk stout here. There's a chocolate character in the background and a small but distinct taste of lactose. The body is fairly thick and frankly I had trouble finishing the 20 oz pint. It's a great dessert beer, if you like a good Mounds bar or just like coconut. I would have liked a touch more flavor that wasn't coconut-based. Still, it's easily the best coconut beer I've ever had.","tempest","Nov 09, 2010"

The aroma is coconut right off the bat and in your face followed by mild dark chocolate and vanilla. The taste is liquid Mounds Bar through and through! The coconut flavor is present the entire time but you also do get some dark chocolate, vanilla, and roast coffee notes. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Some people I talked to have said 1 is enough as it can be a little sweet but for me, this by far is the best coconut beer and I could drink it everyday, all day.","kbutler1","Oct 31, 2010"

4.97,11.9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Had this on tap at Town Hall yesterday. Pours a very dark brown color with a small off-white head that was gone quickly leaving little lacing. Aroma is deep, in your face, chocolaty-coconut goodness. Definitely sweet in the nose, plenty of sugary caramel and nuttiness. Taste is perfect for what they were going for. I asked if they had used toasted coconut, but the bartender assured me it was fresh, but there's something about this brings out a nice toasty edge to the coconut. Milk chocolate is the first thing to smack me across the tongue, and it's followed up by a nice coconut finish, roasty, nutty, sweet, but not cloyingly so. I'm even picking up something that tastes a little bit like cinnamon or nutmeg. So damn delicious. I give this a 6 out 5 for tastes. Creamy, soft mouthfeel, viscous and lightly warming. Great beer here. I had two pints of it, and that was enough for me, as the sweetness did become a bit much after awhile, but the first pint went down super easy and quick. Fantastic stuff.","KeefD","Oct 27, 2009"
4.89,10.1,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Black bodied beer with a creamy deep brown head. The head recedes to a collar in about a minute. Spotty lace is left on the glass as I drink. Aroma is incredible. Milk chocolate and very light roasted malt. Toasted coconut is very subtle on the nose. I doubt I'd pick it out if I didn't know it was in the beer. Hazelnut and mocha and coffee accent as well. Fantastic! I pick up the coconut a little more on the palate with my first sip, but it is in no way overbearing. It REALLY blends nicely with the milk stout base. The base flavor is chocolatey and roasty and sweet. The toasted coconut accents beautifully and leaves a nice lingering toasted coconut/ coconut milk flavor long after. This beer is lightly carbonated an about medium in body. Very easy drinking and VERY flavorful. A one of a kind.","Bighuge","Oct 27, 2009"
4.39,-1.1,4,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Distinct coconut meat/milk flavor, lightly toasty, backed by some chocolate milk sweetness. Ultra smooth with the consistency of chocolate milk also.
