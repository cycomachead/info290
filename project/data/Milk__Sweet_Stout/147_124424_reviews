"C"
"12 oz. bottle from Whole Foods. Pours very dark brown with a billowing head of khaki froth. Aroma of dark chocolate, ground coffee beans and roasted malt. The taste features a black coffee roasted bitterness, though a little warming helps balance things out. Hops are earthy and meld fairly seamlessly with the bitterness of the roast. The mouth feel is thin which helps, along with the lactose, to moderate the bold bitterness. Great balance. Light and tasty is a rare combination that deserves extra points. Love the low ABV."
"This one is an easy drinking sweet stout from Stone that had a good balance and went down easy enough but ultimately failed to excite, it was quite an average beer for me really and not one I'd be likely to go back to again. While it definitely wasn't a bad one from the brewery, it never really hit the heights of Young's Double Chocolate Stout or even Left Hand's Milk Stout but it was nice enough I guess."
""
"Bittersweet. Surprisingly mild coffee flavor, though that's still the dominant note. Not cloying but definite sweetness on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, though not as ""thick"" as I usually expect from a stout."

"Overall: Wasn't impressed by this one at all, seemed a little short in all areas with the exception of the appearance. Probably won't buy this one again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer, I'd prefer a bit more coffee and a bit less milk and a fuller body."
"A bit on the thin side, the smell and taste of milky coffee are why i marked it so high. Very nice"
""
""
"WAY TOO SWEET. This beer was difficult to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Completely clack, viscus, and with a thin, nearly nonexistent head, this has an almoist oily appearance.  The smell is of coffee, roasted grain, and dark chocolate.  The taste is a little sweet, with a creamy texture and a little coffe sensation. Full and luxurious.  Very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An enjoyable milk stout. All flavours are there. I was just hoping for more of the lactose sweetness to shine through. Other than that, good roasted malt and coffee bean profile."
""
"O: This one is a bit disappointing, but when I step back and look at it for what it is it makes sense. I came in expecting a richer sweeter beer, but at around 4% that's pretty tough to achieve. As a lighter body session stout with a little something extra in the flavor department it does pretty well."
""
""
""
""
"This is odd. I understand the point was to create a light, easy-drinking milk stout, but even with Stone's warning, it still feels light and underwhelming. This is worth a try, but it's not great."
""
"overall, no balance, all burned coffee, and a bit oxidized at that."
""
"Remember this is a milk stout folks....low abv. With that said this is a great take on the style and the coffee is wonderful!"
""
"A fun but not outstanding milk stout with heavy coffee roast flavor. Good breakfast beer. Noticeable milk sugar or lactose on the nose that blends well with the roasted java and translates seamlessly into the palate. Pours dark brown and has a creamy head that doesn't stick around for long."
""
"Excellent beer.  I had the honor of drinking this draught from the keg at the Columbus Winter Beer Fest.  Very impressive.  One of my favorites of the night."
"A pretty bland coffee stout, unfortunately pretty easy to forget."
""
"A bit disappointed with this beer"
"Had on tap at the Corner Slice this afternoon.Dark chocolate looks with a roasted and brown sugar nose.A fuller feel with bitter chocolate and roasted coffee bean flavors.Good but not ""top notch""."
""
"Although this beer did hit the spot for a cold winter day next to the fireplace, I was a little disappointed.  I've had other milk stouts with more pronounced creamy lactose sweetness, this one lacked.  The aroma was nothing to write home about.  I began drinking tj from the fridge and it seemed watered down, I was hoping that would subside with temperature...it didn't. Bummer."
""
""
"It's loaded with lactose but the body falls a little short. Flavor profile is solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Does have a nice Stout slam to the palate followed by a sweet lactose polishing."
""
"12 oz. poured into a snifter.   Dark brown-black with 1 finger of tan head and nice lacing.  Aroma is espresso, roasted malt, smoke, and lactose.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture.  Palate is strongly coffee and roasted malt with a lingering bitterness.  Very drinkable coffee milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I did not find it appealing at all. Big fan of other Stone offerings, but I wouldn't drink another. Much better stouts out there."
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown color with a frothy creamy off white head. Big sweet creamed coffee flavor and aroma. Nice flavored sweet stout!"
"Pours a three finger brown head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights.  Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose and flavor follows with roasted coffee, light lingering bitterness. Tastes fine even though best by 1/20/2015. $2.10 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Good milk stout although the coffee taste can be overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a low ABV beer and honestly can't taste the alcohol at all.  As a coffee milk stout, super easy to drink and could easily drink several, unlike most stouts.  A good pickup from Stone."
""
"Stone does it again. Tasty beer. I'd recommend it to any dark beer drinker."
""
"First time around i didn't like this one, but gave it a second chance and it grew on me for sure."
""
"A great smelling beer, coffee mocha, rye. Thin and watery on taste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, in my opinion, I believe Stone did exactly what they were calling for. Good job, I'd have it again."
""
"Very milky taste but delicious. would drink again."
"M: average"
""
""
"I was expecting something light with a nice sweet coffee flavor but I found this beer to be super harsh with its roast flavors. One of the view beers I've had that I didn't really want to finish the glass."
"Cheers!"
""
"Easy drink. Light carbonation. Not gummy on the finish like others of this type."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep brown but appears tar black, producing 2.5 fingers of dark mocha, moderately lasting, frothy head that leaves little lace. Nose is dark roasted malt, coffee with hints of cocoa, toffee & dark fruit. Taste is dark bitter coffee, dark malts with roast & burnt notes, dark chocolate, dark fruits, smoke & faint anise. A pleasant but delicate bitter quality develops following mid-sip, increasing through the finish & balancing with sweet in the initial aftertaste but soon becoming dominant. Aftertaste is smoky bitter chocolate & roast. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, low-moderate carbonation, creamy, smooth & somewhat chewy."
"Draft poured pint. This is a low ABV session stout that does exactly what it says on the tin (bottle/tapline etc). Dark brown to red in color, with a thin frothy head. Has a thin mouthfeel as expected. Mild coffee notes, with little of the milk sugars coming through. Easy drinking. Good for what it is."
""
"Delicious. Tastes quite a bit like Left Hand Nitro cream stout. Could use more of a coffee taste"
"D: This was a nice coffee stout, not as sweet as expected. The scent and taste weren't complex, but they were enjoyable. The body was weak, but the finish was smooth, so it was super easy to drink. Good brew, like a dark session ale (better than a session IPA for winter months)."
""
""
""
""
"Pours thick dark with a small creamy head that disappears quickly. Mild coffee and chocolate smell. Burnt chocolate and coffee taste. Mildly creamy with little carbonation. Very clean mouthfeel with some dimension to it"
""
""
""
""
"Expected big things with the pedigree of this brewery. Starts well with a dark body and decent aroma of coffee but the flavor was lifeless; watery coffee, residual cocoa. Very boring and disappointing."
""
""
""
"I was really surprised at the great smell and loved the taste of the beer."
""
"It's not that great of a stout style beer."
"Disappointing even though it didn't have a high rating to begin with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer overall but the combination of the words ""coffee"" and ""milk stout"" simply carry so much more promise... and in that sense, this is a touch disappointing. Still, I'm glad to have found out for myself."
""
""
"I was expecting good things from this beer.  The smell was that of a coffee beer.  I thought it was kind of thin or watery for a stout, it was definitely not thick.  The taste was what it claims to be coffee, although it was very subdued and not pronounced like some other coffee stouts.  I maybe expected some sweetness and maybe that it why the coffee was not in your face as with others.  It was kind of nice to have a milder coffee option out there.  The flavor was good but not earth shattering.  The bitterness on this was mild and I would drink this again but I would not seek this out.  Overall it is an enjoyable easy to drink stout."
"Pours pitch black with a small dissipating tan head, smells of coffee and vanilla, tastes of coffee vanilla roasted malts slight chocolate, thin mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Fine but the coffee is too subtle on the palate."
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable - think of it as a 'session' stout."
""
""
""
"Complex flavor and nice smell."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a damn fine stout."
"this is amazing beer a very dark coffr milk stout  the taste of coffe is not overpowering  its looks too good to be ture in a glass love read the others because mined never do just great beer"

"O - great available session stout ""for the ride home""."
"Better than I expected based on the previous reviews"
""
""
"If you’re a coffee aficionado and like your stouts on the bitter side, this isn’t half bad, though I would have liked a fuller mouthfeel.  With that said, it remains a sessionable stout on par with what I would have expected out of a six-pack from Stone."

"Not your usual Stone beer! I was expecting espresso to a certain extent, but what I got was more of a latte: it's creamy, coffee-like, cocoa-ish, milk chocolatey, and gently nutty with an edge of sweetish dark caramel that's almost like a bit of candy-ish almost-burnt sugar. There's some dark malt acidity to it, but not much, and the bitterness level is restrained to what I'd call moderate. There's just enough to balance it in combination with the soft roasty dryness. It's easily drinkable, and I guess it should be at just 4.2% abv. A tasty treat that goes down to easily and leaves you wondering where your beer went."

"Single 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. Very dark essentially pitch black brew with a thin layer of rich tan creamy bubbles on top and around the sides of the glass. Nose is chocolate and coffee in approximately equal measure, with some toffee notes as well. Interesting on the palate ... There is plenty of chocolate but also dry roasted coffee bean to cut much of the sweetness along with some distinct dark roasted barley notes, chocolate malt all the way. Silky smooth and light bodied with a notably dry roasted finish with little residual sweetness. I probably would not be able to pick this out as a clear milk stout. As everyone says its a diversion for Stone and probably a worthwhile pick-up for the English stout lover. I find myself yearning for just a touch more sweetness."

"0- Meh, not a bad coffee stout.  It is what it is, nothing more."
""

"F: This is possibly the worst part of this beer. A beer like this should be thick, creamy, and stick to the inside of your mouth. You should still taste it minute or two later. But, sadly, none of this describes said beer. It's thin, holds no real body, and leaves much to be desired. Sorry, Stone...(love you guys, however).....This one's a miss."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this was OK. I think the beer should just be called ""Stone Coffee Stout"" instead, but that's just me. I didn't find this one to be too creamy or anything like that. I keep mentioning the bitterness, but it was on the verge of being too much. I wish Stone listed the IBUs on their website. At 4.2% abv, you could have a few of these with your pals and not get wrecked. So for a low abv beer, this is an absolute winner. Coroando's Blue Ridge Coffee Stout beats this one hands down for me. Try that one if you can find it. I'll stick with Young's Double Chocolate Stout (my favorite beer) and Left Hand's Milk Stout Nitro if I'm looking to drink a beer in this style as well."

"This is an decent beer especially for those that like coffee.  The beer has surprisingly decent body for a 4% abv.....I still prefer my stouts with more body but this is good.  The taste and scent are undeniably coffee.  The beer pour a pitch black with tan head that is not lacing.  Overall it is decent."
""
"O - It's a good beer. It is not over the top as one would expect from Stone. This is more of a good everyday beer."
""
""
""

""
"LOVE Stone beers, hands down, but this was not my deal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  This is not always my style of beer.  I love stouts, but sometimes an aggressive coffee addition can be a bit of a turn off to me.  In this case, however, the sweetness balances it out very nicely, making this a very drinkable and tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pour is black with a brown sugar colored head.  Nose is coffee and roast.  Taste follows the nose, coffee and roast.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin, with a drying quality and not the smoothness one would expect of a milk stout.  Overall not a bad effort, but I've definitely had better in style and far better from Stone."
"Very dark as stout should be. Scents of roasted malts. Tastes like of roasted barley balanced with sweetness of the malts  a a slight hint of coffee. Very full body and lingers on the palette. Overall an excellent stout and very enjoyable in the cold winter months."
""

"A little bitter in the beginning but a great finish."

"If you like a coffee beer, this one will do it. An eye-opening quaff. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bine & Vine."

"O:  Sessionable.  A great brunch drink.  I would've liked a bit thicker mouthfeel, but it's still a solid milk stout."
"O- the amount of flavor packed into 4.2% was impressive, with plenty of coffee, chocolate and sweet lactose.  I'd definitely buy more of this"
"Stone Coffee Milk Stout was a very nice way to start my Sunday morning - what an easy ride! Anything brewed at Stone is done so under the watchful eye of a skilled team of people, so it's no surprise to me that this recipe found the perfect balance between coffee beans and milk sugar."

"I was expecting more."
""
""
"I found myself wanting something else with this particular stout...so I dropped some vanilla ice cream in there and that helped.  Overall not that impressive."
"O- The flavor was fine, no off flavors, it was just pretty bland.  The body was very light and lacking  Overall, this is a very underwhelming offering from Stone.  The roastiness is very low for a ""coffee"" stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Major ""mehh..."" on this one. Best part was the initial pour, which provided a stunning inch tall light chocolate colored head. Stout itself was swallowing light, which is to be expected with a stout but turned out to be shocking that it did given the thinness of this one. Smell was lightly of coffee but little else. Taste followed the same line but was thin in taste like it was Folgers coffee that was used (I am also a coffee snob....dark, French roast from like Starbucks is my START point for good coffee...). Finish was equally thin, with a decent lingering aftertaste. I typically swoon over anything with a gargoyle on it but this one was a bit of a miss."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I realize that this beer is not going for ""imperial"" type presence, and I suppose it does a pretty damn good job at delivering a lot of flavor in a small package. I just wish the taste was as nuanced as the smell: I couldn't help but feel the charred malt roastiness really shot down the complexities I found in the nose. Pretty easy to drink overall: a good beer for what it is."
""
""
"Overall, promising but ultimately disappointing. The flavor starts off delicious but soon fades into mediocrity, leaving mostly some coffee and roasted malt along with the persistent hop (and probably roasted malt) bitterness. The aroma is rather nice but expresses little more than coffee and cream. Otherwise very drinkable and fairly tasty."
"This turned out to be considerably better than my first impression. Good flavor and aroma, and the low ABV makes it really easy to drink."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom enameled twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
""
"This is a remarkably poor beer, imo. The label says it's popular at the brewery and that it's creamy. The six pack I had were all extremely thin, no head or lacing, and far from creamy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nicely done session beer that I will buy again."
""
""
"It's a pretty good milk stout, and a pretty good coffee stout, it's just not quite an excellent example of either.   However, it's certainly what I expected when I popped the bottle.  And it's Stone, so obviously it's going to be pretty good, even if it's not their best ever.  Certainly worth a try."
""
"mouthfeel is smooth and overall a good milk stout m"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  By itself it's a good stout, but this beer would be better paired with dessert.  I wish I had some cookies to go with this.  I like how the milk sugars and coffee are distinct flavors with this beer.  I wouldn't want more than one in an evening, but this is a good complimentary dessert beer that won't be a super rich beer experience, but still a very good one.  I'll have to revisit this beer again."
""
""

"The nose is filled with lactose, cream, molasses, marshmallow, dry chocolate and light espresso bean. The flavor is light but delicious. Lots of coffee, dry roast, chocolate syrup, malt and lactose creaminess. This is incredibly thin, which is detracting, especially for the style but from a flavor standpoint it's very good."

"Amazing for such a low abv"
""
""
""
"Just not feeling this beer for a few reasons. The coffee is not nearly as smooth, robust or portrayed as well as many of the great coffee brews out there nowadays. An acidity also comes into play on the palate which clashes with the heavily roast grains. While I like the idea of a low-ABV coffee stout, the body here does not fully support the flavors even with the added lactose."
""
""
""
""
"Smells of faint coffee and dark chocolate. Taste follows suit. Not overwhelming by any means but certainly a pleasant level of flavor. It tastes like chilled, medium-strength coffee after a bite of dark chocolate. Definitely nice for when you want to have stout flavor, without the accompanying heavy body and ABV. Personally I am not yet so heavily into coffee in my beer, or otherwise, but I wouldn't say I'll never have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"It may be blasphemy to say.... But to me this is the session version of old Rasputin stout. The pour is of a deep black with brown carbonation. The smell is of toasty goodness along with coffee, earthy, and a bit of black currant. Taste is not of what I would co wider a milk stout but it is a mild back end sweetness that is barely there. Good session beer for winter will buy again"
""
""
"The pour is a thin black with some dark beige foam. The nose is great: chocolate, coffee. The taste is roasted bitter, coffee. Definitely thin for my liking."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good coffee flavor that's light as expected for the style, but I wish it was sweeter and had more of a lactose presence."

"Just not a well balanced stout and proof that not everything under the sun needs to be released to the public."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown bordering black with an off-white head. The aroma is toasty and roasted with a hint of smoke.  The taste follows suit with roasted tones, faint coffee and more smoke flavor.  Lactose sugar adds to the creamy feel of the body and perhaps a faint creamy sweetness.  Hops are barely noticeable, letting the grain and coffee flavor take center stage.  It's a nice little beer, even if tame."

""
""
"Pours a black color.  1/3 inch head of a tan color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of coffee, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint hop, hint of alcohol, and a hint of lactose sweetness.  Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of sweet malt, hops, slight roasted malt, hint of lactose sweetness, and coffee.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and decent blend."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my first milk stout. I think I like it. A LOT'"
"Don't get me wrong; this is a tasty brew... if you like your beer to taste like coffee instead of, well, beer. Didn't really taste much of the milk stout part of this one. Probably a good fit if you are one of those who is always trying to figure out which beer goes with ice cream or chocolate chip cookies. Mmmmm... cookies."
""
""
""
"A decent version of the style, the nose promising a sweet, sickly affair, which was soon kiboshed by the sour and ashy characters, rendering a pleasantly drinkable experience overall.  In fact, as things wound down to the end, I found myself starting to marvel at how light it all was, despite what it still looked like.  Neat."

"Very drinkable but wish it presented a little bit more."

"Overall: Nice stout. Best if you enjoy a combination both strong coffee and malts flavors. I like it and would drink it again.  I do prefer Stone's Imperial Russian Stout though."
""
""
""
""

"Smells and tastes very similar, with strong notes/flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, and sweet malts.  Smooth to drink and refreshing for a stout.  Definitely a decent beer worth a second try."

""

"Jet black in color and impenetrable to light.  A fingernail of khaki colored head covers about half of the top.  Aroma is of lactose with just a hint of coffee.  The flavor is a nice complementary blend of moderately bitter and slightly smoky coffee and sweet lactose.  The mouth is velvety smooth and creamy."

"O: I thought this was tasty, but it's not for the faint of heart – this has some seriously roasty flavors and big black coffee. As someone who drinks his coffee black, I enjoyed this one, though I think it could use more milk in the ""milk stout""."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great beer. Style wise I cant find a flaw in it. Also for a brewery known for huge abrasive beer with giant ABV and crazy ideas , this is a great example of a simple style done with a modern variation and done expertly well. I dont read others reviews before I write my own but I'm interested to see where it lost points for its overall. If they ever exists on nitro I would buy a plane ticket to get it. Well done Stone, now that your building a facility in VA I'm looking forward to access to more of your offerings."

"OK beer but a little disappointing, way over priced at 20$ a 6er here in Alberta, this might be a hard sell beside their IPA on the same shelf for the same price"
""
""
""
"Pours deep black with a thick creamy darker tan head. The head dissipates pretty quickly, leaving some light soapy lacing. The aroma is a nice combination of the lactic sweetness, the coffee and a slight roasted malt astringency. The taste is not a punch in the mouth, as the style could be, but a subtle balancing of all the flavors in a lower ABV body. It really comes in to its own as it warms to about 50F. The body is lighter, as a milk stout should be, with a nice silky quality to it. A session-able and flavorful stout."
"Overall:  Decent flavor, but thin and watery.  This would be a good light session beer if you wanted more flavor from a light beer, but if you're used to full-bodied stouts this will not satisfy you."

"Mouthfeel is pretty good, lighter bodied than I expected.  Modestly carbonated providing a nice smooth feel, not quite ""silky"" but nice.  Flavors mesh together nicely, has a long lingering flavor despite the light feel ing the tongue.  Not overly drinkable, for a low alcohol beer, it's more of a sipper, but kudos on the big flavor for a a beer that's badly over 4% ABV.  Overall a pretty good beer, but I was expecting a little more, It tasted more what I'd expect if they did a smoked porter series brewed over coffee beans.  Also, really expensive for a low alcohol six pack.  Still a good beer though, glad I got to try it."

"Overall – If you like coffee and want something low in abv., then this is certainly your brew.  It packs tons of coffee flavor in and leaves you with a taste that is almost as though you had just taken down an iced coffee.  For the abv. I must say it is a rather decent go too, as long as you want a cup of coffee with your beer.  Overall even at only 4.2 % abv., in classic stone style, it is over the top in at least one characteristic, with this one being coffee.  I must say though, actually, that it is a rather interesting and tasty brew.."

"Overall: I really like milk stouts so I've tried Stone's coffee milk stout several times in bottles and draft, but it just misses the mark for me.  Too bitter, too much coffee, not enough sweetness.  I like the low ABV, but the beer doesn't lend itself to having more than one at a sitting."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, it had pretty much everything that I look for in a Milk Stout and the added coffee worked well with this beer since it didn't completely dominate it and it kept this beer very balanced.  This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, fairly crisp, a little creamy, not too filling and the taste did a good job of holding my attention, I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these especially around a nice fall bonfire.  What I liked the most about this beer was the balance, the coffee was a part of this beer, but it didn't take it over and I thought the appearance was very good.  What i liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything that I disliked or would change, it's good just the way it is.  I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for the style and I think it's worthy of getting a six pack.  I would recommend this to anybody who like milk stouts, it's pretty true to style, it just has a little twist from the coffee.  All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I was starting to get a little frustrated with stone since I haven't really been into there last few releases besides that quad, but this beer turned out to pretty good and it reminded me that stone can also make a tasty low abv beer.  This is one of the best beers I've had from stone recently and I this it's one of the better Milk Stouts that I've had.  Good job guys, this was a tasty beer, Keep up the good work."
""
"For the low abv, this has a ton of flavor. I am not sure people are rating this relative to the style and low abv but I thought it was decent, and not as bad as most make it seem."

"Final Thoughts: A nice offering from Stone. Are there better coffee milk stouts out there of relatively low AVB? Sure, but there's plenty of room for competition. Would I drink it again? Yeah."
"The name promises lots of flavor, what you get is a thin body so-so stout. Easy to dink at 4.2 abv but you keep waiting for the coffee to show up. It's in there but quite faint.Pours dark with a finger of brown foam that dissipates quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not worth picking up again but it was a decent beer. Not sure of the hate they tried something new and even if wasn't loaded with flavor or not as sessionable it should be at least honored as being one of the few English Milk Stouts on the market. Try it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black with a small beige head. A decent amount of lacing is seen with each sip, close to rings. The aroma is of roasted malts, black coffee with a hint of cocoa powder. Pretty much for the taste as well. Great flavor with the perfect balance of the above mentioned flavors with a light hint of smoke but just a bit, which added to this brew in my opinion. Goes down easy and is a good tasting brew. One for the best I had from this brewery so far. Medium bodied and perfect carbonation. A really good brew."
""
""
"Aroma is milky coffee and creamy. Look is deep chocolate brown and refuses to let light through. Taste is smooth and silky and yet allows the slightly charred coffee beans taste come through. Hints of chocolate and coffe throughout with a back of milk"
"Overall, despite how not-bad things sound above, both VDubb and I agree that this beer just falls very flat for us.  Due to the pedigree of the brewer, makers of the inimitable Stone RIS (or IRS...whichever), and the tasty sound of the constituent flavors, this should have been a slam dunk.  Instead, there's definitely some coffee, not much in the way of a milk stout base, really (more of a standard or even an English stout base), and a thinner-than-ever-expected body, all combining with some hefty initial interest and hope to produce a massive disappointment.  Again, I must state that this is by no means a bad beer (I drank half the sixer with no real qualms about flavor or anything like that), but it reeks of disappointment and malaise, something I've unfortunately experienced a lot of from Stone recently.  Despite not being bad, I'm not likely to ever have another of these, especially at that higher-than-most price point.  To sum things up, this stuff is okay, but somehow still finds a way to be mediocrity incarnate."

"Overall: I picked up a single and man am I happy I made that choice. This one is a pass, they need to work on this one. Stone has the ability to do much better. And they have."

"This looks better and has a more full mouthfeel than expected. However the flavor and nose are rather lacking. Bitter coffee notes with slight lactose."
""
""
""
""
"O: roadty but not overpowering"
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent milk stout that focuses on a smooth roast/coffee bitterness and displays that flavor profile with clean, simple effectiveness.  The pleasant coffee-cream overtones make this stout easy to drink, and the low ABV offers up a very sessionable brew.  Worth a try - I think this gets the job done if you're looking for an easy-drinking stout with straightforward coffee notes but without any excess sweetness.  If, however, you were expecting an over-the-top, complex stout - in the same vein as, say, a Stone's IRS - with only the ABV dialed way down, then you'll want to look elsewhere."
""
""
"O: Enjoyable, pleasantly bittersweet. Well balanced sweetness/bitterness. Still, too thick to feel truly ""sessionable", ie. throwing back a few, even with its low ABV. Though it's obviously apples to oranges, and not what Stone was going for, I'd much prefer one Founder's Breakfast to the two of these I could probably drink comfortably. The way the coffee is used is the best and most memorable part of this beer for me. It is blended and utilized well in a way that tastes even and lasting. Interesting, but not the first stout, or even milk stout, I would reach for."
"Thanks Kegatron for sharing this growler with me. Poured into a snifter, the brew appears black in color with a rich brown head that fades slowly. The aroma is quite fresh and grainy smelling with hints of oats before getting dominated by roasted aspects slightly charred and like coffee. The taste is mutually roasted with minerals. A fresh oat inclusion before charcoal and a hint of fruity alcohol/hops. This is creamy bodied and overall not bad."
"for how light of a stout this is it still maintains the roasted flavors and the hints of the lactose come through as well. the linger is what I would expect with a weaker beer where the aftereffects just vanish, but up front this beer hits the mark and that's why I scored it high, it represents itself in what it is supposed to be-a sessional coffee-milk stout and it tastes good."
""
""
"Light coffee, bit of smoked(light)/roasted malts and a decent feel/body make for an approachable yet quaffable brew with and easy going ABV.  Surprising offering from the hop mongers at Stone."

"Black thin body with a very faint head. Light malt aroma with a more pronounced coffee smell. Lots of bitter chocolate taste. Good amount of coffee flavor. Pretty good easy drinker."

"O 4 - I find this pretty refreshing and easy to drink. Good for a coffee lover. I'll buy this occasionally. I like that it has the lower ABV; not every stout has to have a huge alcohol presence. I'm not sure why some are complaining about this one."
""
"Jet black with a big tan head. Loads of fresh roasted coffee in the aroma and taste. I'm not a coffee drinker but I love it. A hint of sweetness, it's actually fairly dry and a bit thin for a sweet stout but it's tasty and refreshing. Probably a great breakfast beer."

"12oz bottle. Pours a black color with a half inch of medium brown head. No lacing. The aroma is sweet coffee with milk and sugar, chocolate and roasted malts. A hint of caramel. The taste is roasted malts, light and sweet coffee and some earth. Coffee grounds and sweet milk. Slight charcoal note towards the end. Finishes with sweet milk and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is light with very little carbonation. No alcohol presence and pretty drinkable, even with the sweetness. Overall, decent beer I might grab again."
""
""
"Just like the brothers stated. This was ok... not my favorite effort from Stone. A bit light on the texture, slightly watery. I am comparing this to stouts in general, so..."
""

"O: I definitely understand what Stone was shooting for when they made this beer, and they succeeded. I completely agree with what someone said in their review - it's nice to have a thin, somewhat refreshing stout that isn't necessarily syrupy or alcoholic. Very nice. (3.75)"
""

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/23/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark bread, cream, toast, light char, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt, coffee, and lactose notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, cream, light char, and roasted earthiness. Light amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roast, dark bread, toast, cream, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately silky/creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a very nice session milk stout! All around good complexity and robustness of roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: As a big coffee drinker and fan, as well as someone that really enjoys a strongly brewed black coffee, this beer was right up my alley. I really enjoyed it though I could see people expecting a sweeter beer since it was a milk stout with coffee. I would definitely get it again."
""
"I was eager to try this because I think coffee would go well with a milk stout. Sadly, this was not a stellar effort from Stone. It's a good beer, but there are far, far better (non-imperial) milk stouts out there that blow this one out of the water. Left Hand and Duck Rabbit spring immediately to mind."

"Had some pretty high hopes for this beer considering the style and the brewer, but it just misses the mark.  It looks great and smells very good, but the taste is flooded with a weird, nonstop bitterness that just lingers and lingers, and the feel is less like a milk stout and more like a mediocre porter. This beer would likely be great as part of a beer float with some vanilla ice cream, but on its own, it's a beer I'd probably not bother having again. Though my score is lower than the median by quite a margin, a ""good"" rating for a Stone beer on BeerAdvocate is, in my opinion, just not good enough. I was expecting more from Stone, and I know that they can do better than this."
""
""
"Very solid for the style. Why low ratings? I guess too many people don't get the concept that it's a SESSION beer."
""
"Overall - Nothing particularly outstanding, but solid all around. I don't think I'd be willing to fork over $10 for another sixer."
""
""
"O:  Wasn't a big fan, especially due to the thin body; pass on next time; but, its low ABV, so should have expected it.  Much better milk stouts out there"
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a mug, the beer pours a jet black coloring, with hazelnut highlights around the edges, and a foamy, dense, tight, light tan head that settles out into a surface coat fairly quickly.  Aromas of fresh ground coffee forward, cut nicely with the lactose for some cream and milk highlights, and a solid roast characteristic. Flavors are heavily roasted forward, with a somewhat muted coffee character balancing nicely with a semisweet milk undertone. Again, solid roast characteristics help rough up the smooth cream notes, and the bitterness from the coffee helps further the balance.  Smooth, slightly dry in mouth, with a bitter roasted aftertaste. Subtle hints of cream sweetness linger on into an otherwise dry, slow finish. The balance and precision of an otherwise ""unsexy"" style of beer is really impressive.  Low ABV keeps the drinkability up.  Good beer!"
""
"O - This is a decent Milk Stout. The low ABV makes a nice session stout for the winter months."
""
""
"O: I do appreciate the low ABV. Makes for a light dark beer which is nice, though overall other than the nose it's missing the 'milk' portion of its name"

"A very flavorful stout for 4.2%ABV.  It is thin, to be expected I guess, and lacks a bit of depth.  It is also very dry in the finish.  Definitely worth the purchase."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I like heavier stouts, but this is a good case for a more subtle, restrained approach.  I think they may have dialed the sweetness down a touch to much, because the bitter close lingers in a way that can fatigue the palate.  If I were planning a multi-bottle session, the ABV would be no barrier, but the bitterness might.  Still, a fine choice for a night when you cannot pull down the 11% monster because you need to keep your wits about you."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle from a sixer that cost me $9.99. Black color, tan head. Aroma if very mild coffee and malts. Nice flavor of chocolate, coffee, lactose, tastes good. Overall a very tasty session beer that packs a lot of flavor and very easy to down. I think I've bought three sixers already."
""
""
""
"Dark, nearly black color covered by a small, milky beige head.  Smells of intensely roasted coffee grounds and char with lactose creeping around in the background.  Flavor is also aggressively roasted (maybe even burnt) malts, some dark, fruity coffee, and creamy lactose.  Drying with some prickly carbonation that seems to give some body to an otherwise crisp, medium-light body.  It is on the lower end of the Milk Stout spectrum, so I wasn't expecting anything super bold and sweet, but I also wasn't expecting this level of roast.  Not bad overall, but I don't think it'll become a regular purchase."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid stout to drink for a while."
""
""
""
""
"real real mild on the coffee here, almost imperceptible except for in the finish. much more roast and chocolate in the smell and taste than java, but the milk sugar element is right on, even caramelized a little bit, making this beer pretty rich for its abv. i like that its low though, we need more big thick wintery beers that can be sessioned, imperials have a time and place, but this is like a tuesday in january beer for me. great grain bill on it, maybe some oats making it creamy in feel and pretty hearty. not as sweet as other milk stouts, and i guess we have to balancing act of the coffee to thank for that. i wish we had just a little more bitterness in the finish, the roast sort of dies out and gives way to the lactose prematurely by my measure. still, that this is in a readily available sixpack is awesome news for everyone."

"Poured a beige 1 1/2 fiber head. Color 8th black with a little brown at the edges. The nose is predominately coffee, but there is enough sweet milk to balance. The flavor is very roast almost smokey, and there is a slight amount of sweetness in the finish. I think this is a very nice,  underrated beer."

"D:  A pretty big miss for Stone me thinks.  This could have been a creamy and lush coffee wonder but instead it’s just a charred acerbic mess.

I'd take this over Left Hand Milk Stout any day, give this a shot."

"O: [3.25] This is a decent stout.  I'd label it a coffee stout and not a milk stout.  There is none of the sweetness I'd expect on a milk stout.  The primary notes are coffee and chocolate - but there is something in there that the closest I can describe is a marijuana smell/taste.  Not really my thing - but it is not bad.  I have coffee stouts that I prefer and I have milk stouts that I prefer.  So this is a one and done."

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter.  Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass, with just patchy brown foam, but active carbonation around the edges. Aroma of sweet toasted dark malt, lactose, light nuts and coffee. Flavor follows aroma with sweet lactose and toasted malt, light coffee, hints of chocolate and nuts. Medium bodied. A nice light milk stout with distinctive but not assertive coffee flavor. The flavor is overall good, but left me wishing for more of same, although for the ABV, is full flavored and very nicely balanced. A well made, sessionable coffee stout."

"Mouthfeel is thin and almost watery, with very mild carbonation, a lighter body and a slightly bitter grainy finish that trails off like a morning Starbucks bold coffee.

"Looks dark as coffee, with a thin mocha head. Coffee certainly dominates the aroma, though nutty malt adds complexity. Fairly roasty, with a hint of tar. Flavor is also coffee dominant, but unfortunately becomes fairly acrid and metallic mid palate. The roasty bitter finish evens it out a bit. Lactose provides a hint of sweetness. I'm not a huge coffee fan, but, if that acrid and metallic character weren't there, it'd be a good beer."

"12oz. bottle served in a tulip.  Pours one shade shy of black with a mocha-colored 1/8th inch head.  Nose expresses roasted coffee and a suggestion of lactose.  Taste consistent with nose; however, a little watered-down and there's also a smoky quality to the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a carbonation falling just short of crisp.  Decent beer at 4.2% abv, but there are better examples of the style out there."

The taste is a bit more interesting with the coffee coming into the fold. Roasted flavor offset with a smooth sweetness. Finishes somewhere in the middle with mild sweetness and roasted bitterness. Altogether enjoyable if not remarkable. Nice to see a more reserved beer from Stone and they did it well."
""
""
"O: I think Stone is on the right track here. As the market clamors for more session beers, most brewers have latched onto session IPAs, light lagers, and even some Belgian table beers. The stout category has been largely unexplored in this light. The potential is there for someone to really take hold of that niche in the market. It's a little more difficult though, as the average consumer expects a bigger boned beer out of a stout. I think they need to market this more aggressively as a session beer, and even go so far as to put 'session' on the label. It's the main selling point of the beer and it would prevent confusion among the consumers expecting something bigger. As it stands this is a nice enough drink for what it is. They do a good job of giving it just enough body and keeping the harsher aspects (astringency, etc) in check. It remains to be seen if 'session stouts'  will ever catch on, but if you're going to throw your hat in the ring then go full bore and market the shit out of it as such."

It’s a good combination of flavor and lightness, and a more bitter take on a milk stout than most (I suppose that was the goal of a coffee milk stout). While not a gamechanger for me, it’s quite tasty and definitely worth what I paid for it."
"I never would've guessed this beer was 4.2% abv. This is very bold for such a small beer. It's pretty good, but not quite great. Definitely worth giving a try."
""
" I was a little disappointed that it didn't have more of a creamy or smooth milk stout quality. I feel it drinks more like an Dry Irish Stout with coffee. Not bad at all. Just not what I was hoping for. If you want a low ABV coffee stout. This will fit the bill. It is a bit of a palate wrecker though. Feel like I had a cigar with it."

"The aftertaste is a nice lingering of the roasty tastes. It works. If it weren't totally flat, this would be rated higher. It's probably low cal!"

"[Mouthfeel: 3.5] As an American interpretation it's not as full-bodied as one might expect, but this one is clearly leaning toward its English roots.  It's still on the full side of medium, a little too short of the line, perhaps, but fairly rich.  There's a gentle bite on the tongue and it's fairly smooth, though not as much as the style can offer.  The tang translates to the feel in keeping the smoothness from being fully expressed."

"Bottle from Tipples. Excited to try this one at only 4.2% ABV. Pours darn brown to black with a one finger khaki creamy head. Big earthy roasted coffee bean aroma, sweet lactose and some light chocolateyness. Flavor is earthy and spicy coffee, some chocolate sweetness of you look for it, very light flavors but the bold coffee sits on the palate a while after. Some metallic notes. On the thinner side, though that is expected at the ABV, with high carbonation. This seems to need a bit more beef, and there seems to be room to do a at the low ABV. As is, pretty flavorful given the almost session strength. But creaminess would add a lot here. A good beer overall that seems to hit what it is going for: coffee and easy drinking."

"I'm a big fan of Stone Brewing and a stout beer snob, a ""stob"" if you will.  Stone's Imperial Russian is utterly sublime so it was with great anticipation that I tried their Coffee Milk Stout.  After the first few sips I just sat the glass down and scratched my head then went and looked at the bottle again since what just went in my mouth wasn't a milk stout, it just didn't have the quintessential traits of beers that define that category.  It was a fairly drinkable Irish stout with a very faint whiff of coffee but it most definitely was not a milk stout.  Perhaps they passed a bag of lactose over the brew kettle but I think they forgot to add any of its contents.  I think Mr. Gallagher needs to return to the U.K. and continue his training before damaging Stone's reputation any further."

"The Verdict: Not bad. I was hoping for more depth and flavor, but Ninkasi’s Beer Camp offering has set the bar rather high. Drinkable, enjoyable, but there are better renditions out there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good take on a lighter coffee/cream stout. Not as sweet as typical of the style but the roast and smoke presence is good."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's good, maybe a little above average, overall, but not exceptional."
""
"It's nice to see that Stone could do a lower intensity beer and still make it quite tasty. Good work."

"I will NEVER buy this again.  Sierra Nevada Stout has more coffee in it than this, and it doesn't even advertise it's coffee-ness"

"o.  One high quality stout that I will be revisiting often."

"Very smooth as expected of the style. It's incredibly drinkable, but lacks any major depth. Would have liked this to be more coffee driven."
""
""
""
"O: Really solid in terms of what they were shooting for.  It's refreshing to have a coffee stout that is full in flavor but is neither syrupy or super alcoholic."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, bitter cocoa powder, earth, char, coffee ground, and slight lactose aromas. Taste is much the same with bitter cocoa powder, char, burnt coffee, and slight lactose flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that seems more focused on earthy coffee qualities over the lactose used inn the brewing process."

"O- a nice mid/low alcohol brew (4.2%) for the summer when you get home from the office. Glad I took the gamble and will likely pick up another six pack."
""
""
""
"O: Nice flavors and very drinkable. This reminds me of Stone Smoker Porter with some coffee notes which is not a bad thing. Really nice to get this in a 12 oz format."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not bad, its not perfectly balanced but its very drinkable."
""
""

"Poured into a short square glass. Pours jet black with little carbonation. Thin looking. Smell is pleasant though. Its roasty but the coffee is subtle and crisp. The taste is where this looses me. Not refreshing at all and for a session beer it just doesn't make sense. It was actually quite difficult to drink because it just felt thin and really lacking in refinement. The coffee is just lacking in character and it just feels like a bitter mess. Couldn't finish the bottle. I loved the mint chocolate stout that stone did a few years back. This isn't even close."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I could drink 12 of these in a sitting. They are low abv, easy to drink and balanced well. Nuanced, bitter, sweet, roasty and just an all around good beer."

"As a coffee fiend, I was excited to try Stone's take on the style. Poured a 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint glass, and it was beautfull: dark black with a sizable mocha head. The head stayed at about a half-finger's width until it was gone and provided nice lacing. The aroma was by far the best thing about the beer. It smelled exactly like a perfectly roasted cup of coffee with subtle hints of cocoa (noticed this after the beer warmed a bit). After the aroma, though, the taste did not live up to the nose. There was a distinct charcoal taste that I felt did not mesh well with the roasted coffee and sweet lactose flavors. It did meld a bit better as it warmed, but not enough to redeem it. The mouthfeel was decent with all the trappings of a standard milk stout. Overall, not a bad beer, but not particularly good either."
""
""
""
"The aroma is what it is. Coffee and milk. Lactose, light char leads the flavor profile. With very little flavor coming through. I wanted so much more from this beer. But I didn't get big coffee flavor, or dark chocolate. It's very smooth. I just wanted an aggressive beer. Like from most Stone beer's. The worst Stone brew by far."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that fizzled away quickly. Not much lacing at all. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like roasted malt, coffee, lactose and some dark chocolate. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some burnt/charred malt noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, it's a good, enjoyable bittersweet stout. Off the top of my head I really can't think of other sessionable stouts like this one (just 4.2% ABV). I'll be buying this again! $10.99 a 6-pack."
""
""
"O-I like the idea of a easy drinking Stout. Good coffee presence. Well done by Stone; not surprised. A much better showing than their Saison which was also in six packs."
"O: Definitely a solid offering from Stone and something worth checking out. Would make for a nice breakfast beer and is infinitely sessionable. I agree with a previous review that this would benefit from nitro. Perhaps in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This makes for an excellent session stout at 4.2% ABV, you don't get any alcohol on the nose or the taste, very easy drinking, smooth, creamy mouthfeel, it's light. As a stout lover this would be one of my go to beers. For 4.2% ABV this has a lot of flavor, the smell, taste, and aroma are not overwhelming."

"Lots of coffee but very little of the smooth silky sweetness and creamy mouthfeel I have come to love from milk stouts. Mouthfeel is kinda week too. I think this is a great session beer at 4.2%, though, and I would get this again come colder weather as something to drink at a party that I really didn't have to pay attention to to enjoy."
"O: Would definitely buy again. Very sessionable without sacrificing flavor. No real drawbacks; although, as said earlier, this could use nitro in lieu of co2"
