"O - Relatively aggressive for the style, but not bad."

"D: overall a fine take on the style and tasty brew from the variety pack. i usually don't desire stouts like this until it is colder outside, hence why i waited so long to drink this. some of the coffee might have faded, but the brew is still solid."
"4.01/5.00"
""
""
""
"O: This is easily my favorite from the case and probably more along the lines of what we expected. Love it!"
""
""
""
"This is a nice stout.  I've had many beers, however, that taste exactly like this.  I think coffee stouts need a big body to stand up to the coffee flavor, and this isn't quite chewy enough for me."

"I saved this Beer Camp beer for last with hopes that it would be a proper goodbye to camp. I am happy to find that it is. I am a sucker for beers that manage to taste like dessert without tasting like they are going to cause some form of rapid-onset diabetes. Other than some issues with the mouthfeel, this is one of my favorites from the Beer Camp pack."
"Overall: very good stout"
""
"Aromas of roasted malts dominate along with some cold brewed coffee and a touch of chocolate with some warming.  Taste notes are similar and finish with a coarse spice character then a lingering roast coffee flavor.   More cold coffee notes after settling but a return to rich roasted malts with some agitation.  Overall better than I feared, that being too much on the coffee side of the equation, which is why I hesitated till now.  Actually straddles the beer/coffee line nicely, and hides its ABV like a ninja."
""
""
""
"Dark, black color with a tan head and decent lacing.  Smell is of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt, light cream sweetness, and milk chocolate.  Taste follows the nose with big coffee and roasted malt flavors, touch of creamy sweetness balances mid palate and finishes mildly bitter with dark and milk chocolate flavors.  Creamy mouthfeel with a medium body.  Overall I enjoyed this one, nice coffee flavored milk stout."
"Best beer in Beer camp"
""
"o: A tasty, easy drinking coffee stout with a well-chosen name."
"Bottle, pours black with tan head. Aroma is roasted coffee and chocolate. Taste is sweet up front with a bitter coffee finish, tasty"
""
""
"O: excellent and certainly one of the best, if not the best, of the dozen 2014 special SN Beer Camp releases."
"Overall pretty decent beer. Not worth buying the pack for it ( or really any of the beers in the collection).  I would pair it with Korean BBQ short ribs or cola braised pork chops.I give it 87/100."

"O - An awesome coffee stout, with chocolate on the side.  Well done!"
"Dark blackish/brown with a thick creamy tan head. Burnt toast, coffee and dark chocolate aromas. Dark coffee and malt stand in the front. While dark chocolate rounds out the finish. Medium  mouth feel and mild bitterness completes this beer."
"Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma and Taste is sweet cacao and dark roasted malt, a bit of sweet milk chocolate flavor. Palate is a medium body, good carbonation, a bit of a sticky mouth feel. Finish is sweet bitter dark roasted cacao, moderate milk choco with moderate roasted mocha espresso bitter notes, mildly dry ending with a good bit of alcohol kick. A good tasty full flavored latte."
"This is phenomenal.  There is a richness to the coffee and toasted malt, which is perfectly acidic.  Not too bitter; perfectly balanced.  Very well done."
""
""
""
""
"12/7...pours dark brown/black, thick 1/4 inch tan fluffy foam packed. Heavy burnt aroma and roasting too. Espresso beans. Hearty bitter coffee flavor, huge flavor. Light lactose, modest carbonation. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thin with just enough grainy body to keep it stout-like, mild carbonation and a nice bitterness that is tasty with a smoky aftertaste that is on the dry side with just the right amount of bitter zest to confirm that the Stumptown coffee beans used in this brew were some of the finest beans being ground up today. This beer completely hid the 7.6% ABV and was outstanding, I did not want it to end. If Sierra Nevada or Ninkasi want to produce this beer again then I would seek it out and buy as much as possible, it was that good. Best beer by far in the Beer Camp Across America series, this was everything I hoped for in a milk/sweet stout."

"My last Beer Camp Across America offering...  A vigorous pour yields a fingers worth of late to develop medium brown densely packed froth...  Modest retention...  The color walks a fine line between deep dark brown and flat black...  In either case a bit of light leaks in around the edges of the glass...  Still with no discernible carbonation...  A good bit of lacing clings to the sides of the glass...  The nose is dominated by dark roast gourmet coffee as it should be...  Next in line are whiffs of vanilla...  There are also some light roasted malt notes as well...  The flavors that materialize on the palate are a mirror image of the aromas described above...  There is a slight addition of black licorice on the deep finish...  Very pleasing...  On the lighter side of full bodied...  Chewy and viscous...  A light carbonated bite...  A rock star Milk Stout...  Packs a bit of a punch, but that's not necessarily a bad thing...  This would be a welcome addition to the Sierra Nevada line-up, at least in my humble opinion..."

"Coffee is well balanced within the flavor profile. Kind of thin head but mildly syrupy mouthfeel. Might be a bit boozy to drink by itself but great with a Chipotle burrito."
""
"Very ok, all these beer camp beers have tasted about the same with only minor changes from style to style. This is ok but not something I would ever brag about. Lacks taste yet smooth and easy to drink~"

"Very strong coffee flavor. Chocolate aroma. A little chalky and winey at the same time. Surprisingly bitter. Intense stuff. Sippable if you like the strong flavors. From the 12 oz bottle in the Beer Camp 12-pack."
"Dark espresso brown body topped by tan head and great lace. Roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate and sweet milk notes. Delicious."

"Pours dark brown, almost black and opaque, fluffy light brown two finger head that receded to a half inch that stayed to the end. Aroma is very nice, big coffee and chocolate notes very prominent, with some dark fruits in the background. Taste was very coffee forward, with some sweet caramel notes that reminded me of a cola. Also got some light chocolate and hazelnut notes. Mouthfeel was pretty thick and creamy, really nice. Carbonation was pretty light, true to style. Overall this was an outstanding beer, the gem of the Beer Camp pack!"

"Wonderful."

" Overall I am glad I was able to try this -a wonderful coffee stout just carries a smooth roast flavor with low bitterness in the bean all the way and very drinkable and still intense considering it is a relatively low abv milk stout. I loved trying this and would drink it year round"
""
"Overall a very nice beer."
""
""
""
"My last review from the Beer Camp mixed pack. I really enjoyed the experience and thought the choice of styles and brewers was great. Yea there were no """whales/loonz""" in the box but it was still probably the best mixed pack ever made."
""
""
""
""
""
"Arguably the best all around stout I have had.  Definitely recommend trying it if you have the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Best of the pack IMO.  This is a great beer I wish I could pick up as a 6-er, but I'll have to enjoy it now.  I wish I had opened it earlier to try and get more coffee because I just had a FBS and having a hard time picking a favorite. Fresh FBS definitely has more coffee, but I think Double Latte is thicker...oh well, they are both great so I'm a happy person!"

"Overall, this is one bold beer.  The aroma hits you like a ton of bricks, and the flavoring doesn’t disappoint.  While the feel is in keeping with the style, albeit a little light, it doesn’t do the strength of flavoring enough justice.  You get this intense, chocolatey, coffeed, malty roast akin to your big Russian imperials, for example, but this little dinky feel to carry it.  The flavoring is so present, however, that you don’t really spend that much timing worrying about it beyond a simple critique.  This is the best beer of the bunch thus far, with a fantastic representation of both beer and coffee, as was intended."
""
""
"3.48/5: Rock-solid coffee stout, it just seems a bit too mild"
""
""
"O- I was expecting a creamier feel, and the finish taste/feel was just a little off. Still a great beer and a great collaboration."
""

"Coffee stouts can be risky, sometimes bringing out the burnt and bitter notes while leaving the richness behind. This beer does no such thing. Rich, creamy notes combined with underlying maltiness make it a winner. I had mine with a steak meal and it was well paired."
""
""
""
"overall  a very tasty stout."
""
""
""
"Fresh roast coffee aromas joined with chocolate, and a touch of sweetness pour from the bottle as the glass fills with a deep dark black coffee colored brew topped with a 2” latte hued, cappuccino creamy foam cap. The foam cap blends beautifully with the beer below as you drink, softening the coffee and chocolate flavors with just the right amount of lactose added to keep it interesting.  A hint of fruit appears mid-palate and then the beverage glides to a drying, slightly espresso astringent finish with a touch of tartness and lingering coffee bitterness. This is a very creamy big bodied beer supported with a very fine soft carbonation that is as close as a beer will ever come to a double latte."

"This beer needs to be brewed again and in stores year round. Awesome stout. Chocolate and coffee notes. Seriously one of the top 5 stouts I've had. I loved it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black, appearing opaque in the glass with a  patchy, light brown head with good retention and light lacing. Nice aroma of chocolate, coffee, sweet dark toasted malt, hints of lactose. Flavor follows aroma with nicely melded dark toasted malt, lactose, chocolate, vanilla and light quality coffee. Finishes with toasty malt and a hint of grassy hops. Excellent creamy mouth feel, quite nice. I saved this favorite of the pack for the last and it is a worthy way to see the finish of a very ambitious 12 pack that I enjoyed a great deal overall. This is one of the stand outs; a well balanced and blended combination of milk stout and coffee with a  superb mouth feel on par with barrel aged oatmeal stouts. Ninkasi and Sierra Nevada did a great job on this; I enjoyed it much more than any of Ninkasi's stand alone stouts, maybe a bit more than Narwhal. Great beer and a great series to try. It's been a great trip."

"O - Decent, but has some flaws. Everything just doesn't come together well enough to make this outstanding."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Compares favorably against Founders Breakfast Stout, this is a really great offering from Sierra Nevada that I wouldn't be mad about if they decided to release a beer with a similar recipe as a year-round or even seasonal brew. Delicious roasted coffee mingles with chocolate-notes barley and milk sugar to make a highly satisfying pick me up. Very glad I decided to go after this one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely evokes the flavors of a double latte with its milky sweetness, coffee bitterness, and smooth, foamy feel. One of the highlights of the Beer Camp 12-pack for sure."
""

""

""

"It pours black w/ an off-white head. The ingredients are very apparent in the aroma. You can smell the coffee & chocolate. It tastes of roasty malt & the aforementioned coffee & chocolate. Lactose is very apparent too & helps the silky mouthfeel. Likely going to be one of my faves from the box! Great beer."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is a bit sweet, but not to the cloying level, but a nic elingering sweetness with a bitterness that snaps at the tongue."
"The aroma on this is just wonderful, with a big coffee aroma that has a sharp, almost acidic lactic contrasting note. The flavor is sharply acidic, with a mellow coffee character that combines with the chocolate and lactic souring to make for a wonderful dessert beer. I enjoyed every sip of this immensely."
""
""
"Overall:  I am going against the grain on this beer in part as it doesn't fit the profile on the label (I was expecting something with more lactose and a much fuller and creamier mouthfeel) and also because the acrid finish is slightly unpleasant"
""
""
"Taste - Definitely strong, sturdy, and COFFEE. Some chocolate/cocoa notes are most definitely there, but this is far and away a beer for coffee lovers. Serious and world-class."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is great and overall a great beer."
"huge chocolate and coffee flavor. feels like a mix between a mocha and boulder brewing's shake chocolate porter. not a big fan of coffee in my beers but this is a great exception."
""
"O-A decent beer but nothing stellar."
""
""
"Taste-Coffee and cream, smooth yet robust, with a faintly sweet finish."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25): This is an excellent beer, from start to finish. It’s not as big, rich, deep, or complex as a massive American Double/Russian Imperial Stout, but it retains a lot of the best qualities from those styles and imparts it on a (relatively) moderately-sized, extremely satisfying Milk Stout. It’s not syrupy or as sweet as some milk stouts can be. Instead, it’s a smoother, balanced take on an American-style coffee stout. It definitely benefits from being a little larger than other milk stouts, as it wraps in more coffee and chocolate flavor than others. Overall, it’s just an extremely good beer, and I wish it were a regular."

"Inky black body with a thick, mocha head. Aromas of cocoa powder, roast, coffee beans, chocolate, a hint of alcohol. Sweet, but not too, finishing with a touch of bitter chocolate and distant piney hops. Well balanced and tasty. A rare noteworthy brew from the Beer Camp twelve pack."

"The beer pours a very dark black. Opaque without any ruby red highlights at the edge. The dark tan head holds well and is very thick. Tastes is a nice interplay between roasted notes and coffee. A touch of chocolate and lingers sweetness. The mix of coffee, roast, chocolate and sweetness is balanced well. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected and want, but it isn't thin. Very good beer. And I'm surprised and the abv."

"This is coffee stout first and milk stout second; exactly what I was hoping for. The coffee was roasty and lightly bitter without any of the sourness some coffee beers have. There was a bit of lactic sweetness towards the end which worked well with the dark, chocolaty malt. This is an extremely satisfying beer, one of the best from the pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a light color black stout with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry coffee notes with some dry roasted malt is quite interesting. Taste is dominated by nice flora coffee notes which are dry but not astringent. Chocolate notes are also quite interesting. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. One of the best beer from this Beer Camp series."

"O) I've got two left from my twelve pack, and I gotta say, this has been my favorite camper thus far. Well done...."
"Roasty and nutty with an ample coffee presence, and a light lingering bitterness. Medium bodied with a slight astringency, though still creamy from the lactose. Overall one of the better beers from the series. 4/3.5/4"

"Fantasic, probably the highest quality/most complex tasting beer camp beer."

"Overall, nice coffee beer with a good balance of flavors, but not particularly complex or memorable."
""
""
""
"Poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass with about an inch of a dark khaki head that very slowly went down mad left good lacing.  Color is a very dark brown.  Smells like creamy chocolate mixed with coffee and a good toasted malt backbone.  Very smooth and has a coffee and a chocolate milk taste. Mild carbonation which is perfect for this beer.  I loved this stout and would by a 12 pack if the sold it!"

"O - Right up there with Founders Breakfast Stout and Terrapin Wake N' Bake.  A little less coffee forward though; with more emphasis on the latte side of the flavor.  Satisfying.  Easy drinkin'.  One of the best beers in the 12-pack."

""

"Very enjoyable milk stout. Bought the Beer Camp Across America for the mix. The double latte is a great start"

"no hops, over whelming the beer. again best one of the 12 pack, which was NOT worth it IMHO."

"Very tasty milk stout here! Makes the Beer Camp Across America pack one hell of a deal for the variety you get."
"I am very glad I saved this one for last. A stellar beer that is not only the shining star of Beer Camp, but is a superb beer on its own. An excellent example of why you shouldn't write off a brewery as they may surprise you with their next brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easily the best in the 12 pack this has a nice staying power that may cry for a permanent addition."
""
"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Ninkasi. Pours an opaque black with minimum tan head. Bright coffee flavor on the nose, followed by some dark fruit and the conventional bitter chocolate. Whoa, after taking a sip, I'm confused if it's a dark roast coffee or a beer. Quite an intense coffee flavor, a little dry hop at the end and some sweetness but coffee, coffee, coffee. Lighter than expected on the mouthfeel which is always nice with these big stouts. Not exactly my type of go to beer but it's advertised as a double latte, and boy did they hit it right on. Kinda crazy that the two stouts in the Beer Camp turned out to be the best beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Was expecting more coffee and sugar and less hops, but I enjoyed this one. Could have used more flavor overall though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The base beer is a decent milk stout, but the real attraction is the absolutely masterful use of the famed Stumptown coffee. A few tweaks here and there to the base recipe and you'd have a world-beating beer."

""
""
""
"O-Love this beer make some more."
""
"O: Starts out like a strong cup of espresso but then the sweetness of the lactose comes through - I personally enjoy both aspects... Very enjoyable and a nice dessert beer for the evening."
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a black color with dark brown hues and a small layer of head. Some lacing. The aroma is sweet mlik chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. A bit earthy. The taste is a milk chocolatey sweetness with some coffee notes. Roasted malts as it warms with some more sweet milk. Earthy, charcoal finish with some black coffee. Creamy mouthfeel. Slight warming alcohol flavor. A good balance of milky sweetness, chocolate and coffee flavors. Overall, possibly the best beer of the 12 pack."
"O: Lives up to the name as the coffee flavor is quite dominant. Slight milk stout sweetness within the carbonation gives a hint of milk stout flavor before being covered by the bitter coffee. This is a beer for dark coffee lovers."
""
""
""
""
"Brew pours watery black with a thin khaki head that didn't last long but left a thick ring on the surface. Nose is a nice lacto milk chocolate with nice roast. Cooling. Taste is fairly char and cooling as well...big roast followed with milk chocolate. Easy drinker a bit thin, but nice overall. Carb is fairly prickly and with the char the body is low point. Great coffee notes, as advertised. Very nice beer."
""
""
"Served in an Oversized Wine Glass"
"Poured a lovely, classic deep black with reddish brown highlights when held to light and two fingers of wonderfully fluffy tan head. A gorgeous looking beer, true to form for a good stout. Scents of milk chocolate, coffee with cream, roast malt, hints of black coffee, and a low, slight perception of grassy hops. A good, rich, milk stout aroma profile that is very appealing. Flavor begins with a rich, roasted malt and semi-sweet chocolate flavor, balanced by a cream-like sweetness and milk chocolate notes. This moves into a middle dominated by notes of strong coffee with a bit of cream and chocolate keeping it from becoming too dry. Finish is low-dry with notes of rich black coffee, roast malt and a bit of cream-like sweetness balancing the dry flavors. Aftertaste is dry with notes of rich black coffee and roast malt. A wonderful flavor profile that highlights the flavors of a milk stout and enhances them with the use of coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy with moderate-light carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink hiding its high ABV wonderfully. Overall this is a fantastic milk stout that has a rich, robust aroma and flavor and a smoothly drinkable mouthfeel. The coffee addition is detectable in both aroma and flavor and enhances the base qualities of the beer. A wonderful beer."
""
""
"Bottle from the mix pack at Tipples. Having this on IPA day after pouring two abominations of an IPA down the drain. Just not my day for hops I guess. Pours dark brown to black with a big, late forming creamy khaki head. Big coffee aroma, lactose, roasted grains, some chocolate milk notes. Big smooth flavor of earthy coffee and sweet lactose, roastiness lingering in the finish, and even a hint of vanilla here. Lasting coffee notes and very pleasant on the tongue. Silky and smooth but only medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. A very nice drinkable milk stout. I'll have more."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A big and robust smooth mocha latte flavored brew that soothes the mouth as well as the soul. This is a quite delicious sweet, lactose, and coffee flavored brew overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: this is a treat to drink. its my last of the camp, and my favorite. the coffee is the superstar in here, and its balanced so well within the beer that each sip is a delight. not as good as an FBS, but still a really really nice beer to drink. if you don't like coffee beers, stay away. if you do, dive right in"

"O- Pretty good offering, not the best in the series but it's a nice change of pace. Good stuff for sure."
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/30/2014. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, roasted malt, cream, light vanilla, light caramel, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, cream, light vanilla, light caramel, dark bread, light char, and roasted earthiness. A fair amount of roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cream, light vanilla, dark bread, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent coffee stout. All around great complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and lactose flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"OVERALL: A coffee and double cream stout is how I would characterize this one. Drinks easy and I would definitely bring a bottle of this to work every morning if I was permitted and it was more readily available."

"M: Smooth but oddly a little thin and watery for the strength."
"Overall, I can see why this one has come with a good reputation. Flavor-wise, it is one of the more assertive beers in the Beer Camp pack, and it seems any beer with coffee is sure to get a bump in enjoyment these days (not that I blame people--I love coffee beers too!). That said, I prefer my coffee in non milk/sweet stouts, because I love the drier characteristic, but to this beer's credit, it is a conceptual success, with the lactose and coffee playing to make Double Latte as close to a double latte as beer can get."

"Overall: Pretty great roasty beer that hides its alcohol well. I think it could just a bit less attenuation to add a bit more sweetness, but that is just nitpicking."
""
""
""
"O: a good stout - brings a lotta classic stout elements to bear - the espresso, the bittersweet cocoa - in a milk stout, with enough smoothness and lactose to make sure you know what you're drinking."
""
"Overall - Decent, yet missing a real punch. Too tame and mild for its own good. Nothing to revisit again with so many better other milk stouts out there."
""
""
""
"Pours black with massive tan head that sticks around quite a bit. Smells roasty with chocolate and coffee. Tastes like a chocolate milkshake with some light roasts and chocolate notes. Slightly acrid aftertaste. Bitter and roasty. Feels full. Could have this with breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Feels lush and velvet-like. Great beer. Among the best in the Beer Camp sampler."
""
""
"O- This one is exactly as advertised a nice big coffee-forward stout with a good amount of sweetness that plays well off the coffee bitterness."

""

"O- One of the better uses of coffee I have had in a stout. Very tasty"
""
""
""

"On the tongue, the coffee is sharper, and more bitter than in the nose. The body is very pleasantly smooth, with a clean dry finish. Overall, not really my bottle of beer, but if you like java beers, I'm certain you'll love it. Go grab the 12 pack."
""
""
""
"O: This beer starts off tasting like a black coffee but if you give it a chance to warm up the lactose peeks through and it starts to resemble something closer to a latte."

"I love dark beers and this had some amazing flavors. The pour was dark brown/black with a nice coffee colored head that lasts. The smell was full of espresso and dark chocolate. The taste was my favorite part with a lot of sweet flavors like chocolate and cream in the beginning with great coffee and espresso flavors finish the brew giving it a semi-sweet bitter ending. I thought it was delicious. The mouthfeel was also really good with a thick beer that coats your mouth but isn't overly syrupy. Overall this is my favorite of Beer Camp I think."

"Great rendition of a coffee beer. It lacks the acrid character of hot pressing and cheap beans. I'm not a huge coffee fan, and wish the chocolate were more pronounced. A bit bitter for me. As it warms, more chocolate flavor comes out, but the bitter aftertaste isn't me fave."
"Overall, a milk stout that is just done to near perfection the way I like it, one of the styles I am normally not a big fan of and very picky of. Fantastic brew!"

"Pours out black with ruby highlights. Moderate sized khaki-colored head. Nose if COFFEE. Nice stout backbone, but smells so strongly of coffee. Flavor is big on coffee as well. Slight tartness; big sweetness. Nice roasted malts with chocolate tones. Almost saline aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth. Soft carbonation and full mouthfeel. Awesome coffee stout."

"O- Really nice coffee flavored milk stout, nice flavors."
"Pours pitch black with finger width foamy head. Head retention is okay. There is not much in the way of lacing on the side of the glass. Sweet, roasted malt predominate the aroma with coffee and hints of milk chocolate. Roasted, malty taste up front with a coffee like bitterness, followed by a slight chocolate taste. There is a nice bitter aftertaste. Great beer, but it is like most other similar stouts. Nothing new with this one."

"Overall: I am not a huge fan of stouts, but I can certainly appreciate how well rounded, well crafted, and full of various flavors this beer is. This would be nice as a bourbon barrel aged stout - the sweetness from the bourbon would complement the sweetness from the lactose. Regardless, this is definitely a dead of winter type of beer for me!"
"O-Coffee themed beers are some of the most exciting and stimulating experiences craft beer has to offer. On that note, I enjoyed Double Latte very much. My only complaint is that I would enjoy a better balance between sweet and bitter."
""
""
"O - Good coffee stout. Aroma is the hight point here, but everything is pretty good. I certainly would drink more of this if I am able to find some."
"Overall, impressive from the first to last sip, I wish every beer in the pack felt like this…what a great beer."

"maybe the best beer in the box, i am down to my last few, and this could be the winner here. its a beautiful dark almost black brown, with a full inch of what literally looks like latte foam, milky and stained slightly from the coffee, but fully thick and structurally intact. the nose is clad pressed minimally acidic coffee first, maybe a little stale, but giving life to robust roasted barley character in the beer, i dont smell sweetness from milk sugar, rather a dark chocolate bitterness like raw chocolate. the flavor shows only minimal milk sugar too, and its all in the finish, balancing the compound bitter aspects of both the coffee and the grain bill. its dynamic and well integrated, nothing stands out but all additives can be tasted as accent flavors in a delicious base brew. alcohol strength is subtle, but keeps me drinking it slow, which allows it to warm up to room temperature, and i find it even more complex then, with the coffee standing out a little more. smooth beer, but not enough body for me. it seems to thin to support all the flavor packed into it, and the same with the booze. it needs more weight, not much, but its a few points light for me. overall though, an enormously delicious beer, makes the whole box worth it, not that it wasnt before. this is primo!"

"A solid milk stout, for real. Nice collab! #2 of the case knocked off!"

"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a brown-to-black coloring, with a light tan, filmy head. Nose of subtle milk and cream, with a bitter roasted coffee backbone. Very balanced aromas. Flavors are richly bittersweet chocolate forward, with a heavily roasted coffee backbone, and light crème highlights. Extremely balanced. Smooth and dry in mouth, with a perfect balance of rich sweetness and roasted bitterness in the aftertaste. Smooth, lingering finish. Great beer!"

"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours one shade shy of black with a tight, 1/4 inch khaki-colored head. Head eventually dissipates into a solid 1/8th inch skim with semi-concentric half bands of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses coffee, roast and a hint of lactose towards the back. Taste follows nose - a pleasant coffee milk flavor profile with a little chalkiness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp, even carbonation. Just an all around great coffee milk stout. Too bad it's a one-off. Would live to see it in cans."
""
""
""
""
"O) I generally like this style, and this does not disappoint at all. Great effort."
"The beer pours a decent creamy head that dissipates quickly but still leaves a thin tannish head on the beer. The beer leaves lots of lacing. The beer itself is a very dark brown that borders on black.Obviously, the beer is opaque because of the color. The beer smell has strong roasted notes and bitter coffee notes with a little bit of sweet dark chocolate. The coffee notes comes in two varieties: dark and roasted. The lactose also adds a slightly sweet note but gets lost in the coffee. The taste has the same notes but the coffee notes are not as strong and, as a result, the lactose is stronger but still slightly faint. The roasted coffee is also closer to the point where you get a better sense of where the coffee starts and where the malts start. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied and thick with light carbonation. Overall ,a fantastic collaboration. The beer is a lot more roasted than the average milk stout but the addition of the coffee makes it taste really indulgent. I kinda wish I could drink this for breakfast."

"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a 2 inch tan head that sticked around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like coffee, bittersweet chocolate, lactose/cream, and some nuts. I think the taste is mostly just like the aroma, but there's also some vanilla noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation. This is tied for being my favorite beer in the Beer Camp 12 pack. I'd like to see this brew brought back at some point!"

"fresh pour into tulip glass. looks inviting, no to bubbly, but lots of head here.. Looks lends to a creamy and bold full bodied beer. smell is definitely not Latte up front, as the label reads double latte, however I do get the coffee bean for sure. milk stout w/lactose. taste is smooth, no too boozy, roasted malts, red malts, carmel malts. some roastiness, and coffee is more apparent on the tongue more than the nose. Hops are present lending some buttering notes to the finish, more of german or english hops than american seems, which keeps the profile on point. I like the character of the beer, and the full body helps pull throughout the strong coffee and roasty flavor. Overall this beer would go well with a blackened piece of fish, bangers and mash, or Lamb stew, desserts will pair very well here."
"O - Overall this beer is probably the best of the bunch. I've had much much worse milk stouts."
""
"I've never had a beer from Ninkasi but I did enjoy this. Typical jet black stout pour with a semi-dirty head. The nose was not as full in terms of coffee or chocolate, but one I tasted it, I realized how incredibly smooth this was. Its like taking a nice stout, couple of pieces of good rich chocolate, one or two aromatic coffee beans start to digest all of them and then slowly have a small glass of rich creamy milk (for me it would be vanilla almond mik)..."

"Transient cafe brown head fades quickly over a murky brown black beer. Smells of fresh coffee and crushed roasted coffee beans, cream, sugar, vanilla. Very nice. Taste is creamy with a nice bite of espresso roast coffee, lactose, vanilla, very light sweetness. Body is medium and velvety. Excellent milk stout. Great coffee presence."

"But with that depth of flavor, a heartier body is expected. I would like to see what damage this beer could do at near ten-percent alcohol."

""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, brewed coffee, and lactose aromas. Taste is much the same with dark roasted malt, bittersweet cocoa, and burnt coffee flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice mixture of cocoa and coffee qualities all around."
"Overall: Easily one of the best of the beer camp 12-pack for 2014. This is coming from someone who enjoy the hops."

"Pours the darkest brown possible, almost black, capped by a tan two finger head. Above average retention with considerable lacing. Some light general roastiness, dark roasted coffee beans, hint of chocolate milkshake, and a few whiffs of vanilla. Opens with milkshake-like sweetness, joined by milk chocolate that slowly grows more bittersweet and reminiscent of dark chocolate. Roasted malt joined by dark roasted coffee, and lightly bitter espresso. Mellows to milky sweetness. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and slightly silky mouthfeel. A nice solid stout. The coffee does well to emphasize qualities of the base beer rather than overpowering it."
""

""
""
""
""
"O- Great stuff. Hits all the right notes for a coffee beer without being overly sweet."
""
"Overall 3.75: Great stout with excellent balance and flavor focus. However, this was a stout that was just a bit too much of a chimera for me: an unequal melding of parts. I thought the finish was too sweet and the smoothness seemed a bit forced and artificial. This is a delicious brew, just not one of my favorites. It is the best milk stout that I have ever tasted, but that's not much of a complement. Also, why add actual coffee? It eliminates the possibility of making your brew a session beer: who wants to be buzzed and wired at the same time? You can mimic coffee flavor with varieties of toasted grains."
""
""
""

"Overall - Delicious beer all-around. Thus far the prize of the SNBCAA 12-pack. Of course when you love stouts like I do, they'll almost always be my fave in a mixed pack."

"Overall, a nice coffee beer, I like the lactic chocolate and coffee, the finish is a bit too much harsh bitter roast."
""
"O: Personally I felt this beer was pretty damn good until I got about half way down. As the beer warmed, the lactose seemed to fade away, leaving a somewhat unexciting, (but still drinkable) bitter coffee stout."
"I felt the need to write a review, due to the fact that I disagree with the overwhelming positive reviews this beer is getting. More power to those who enjoy this, but this is the weakest milke stout I've ever had. Comparing this to, say, Mikeller's Milk Shake is like comparing night and day. This brew touts it's inclusion of lactose and coffee. The coffee is apparent when tasting, but there is little to no aroma to be had for a beer that pushes the coffee. As for the """milk", all I get is a fake tasting, milk like overtone. There are plenty of milk stouts out there that can make an authentic tasting milky flavor, but lactose or not, this is not it. The after taste is where the coffee really settles in, but it's not enough to hold together this brew. I had the Maillard's Odyssey from the same pack, which was very well done, so I was a bit more than a little disappointed when I tried this. An unfortunate brew."
