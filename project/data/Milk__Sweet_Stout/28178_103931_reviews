"I love white Russians and this certainly does not stand up to the name, but is definitely unique and very smooth."

"Not as good as I remember"

"As good as the movie!!"

"Does not taste like a white russian. Too much banana ester and cloying belgian sweetness."
""
""
""
""

"Light for a stout, but delicious. Excellent flavor of vanilla and coffee, with a creamy texture. Sweet and satisfying."
""
"Points for originality in terms of appearance, but I didn't get any cacao or vanilla.  Just a lingering sweetness."
""

""

"This reminds me of an iced vanilla latte - sweet with a cloying quality to it. This is the only white stout I have had and at first the appearance does take you aback. If you like milk stouts then this is a must try - if only for the curiosity level."

"M: Creamy and medium bodied, easy to drink."

"Yeah, Jonny-Cakes should be here for a stout flavored after his favorite mixed drink, but VDubb will do. This stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of faded khaki foam. The nose comprises mild roasted malts, cocoa powder, hazelnut liquor, light heavy cream (heh, I made a funny), and a touch of caramelized sugar. The taste brings in more of the same, that odd Disoronno flavor really confusing me. Shouldn't there be some sort of coffee flavor here? Or maybe more roast? Dammit, Pipeworks, I love you guys, but you really confuse me sometimes! The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, not a bad stout, really, but the attempt at recreating White Russian flavors just don't seem to work out for me, leading instead to some strange hazelnut marzipan-like nonsense and a nearly complete disregard for stout-ness. But that's just, like, my opinion, man..."

"T: Definitely better than the smell. Chocolate milk right away with a lot of cream, vanilla, custard and light roast coffee. A touch of burnt coffee grounds and roasted malt on the finish. A pretty difficult task to take on, but I think they did pretty well with this. Glad I got to try this."

"A white russian imperial stout? Sign me up! Poured into snifter... step one, is beer light in color? Check. Appears a moderate copper tone with nice clarity. Ring of white head forms and leaves a tiny bit of lacing. By far the lightest colored stout I've witnessed. Step two... does it smell like a stout? Check. Notes of caramel, cacao, cream, coffee, and vanilla all come through. Notes of burnt sugar linger throughout. Not getting the depth of roast that I would expect in an imperial stout, but the combo of vanilla, coffee, and cacao imply sweet stout. Alright, step 3... does it taste like a stout? Check...ish. Up front I get notes of coffee and cacao which give you the implication that you are drinking a stout. This is quickly taken over by a heavy sweetness. Cream, vanilla, and caramel dominate through the end of the palate. The finish is incredibly sweet, almost too sweet for my enjoyment. A dessert beer for sure. Step 4... does it feel like a stout? Not so much. While this is no light bodied beer, it just doesn't take on the viscosity that I love so much in big stouts. Carbonation is spot on, mild to moderate. Overall, this is a fun beer. While it's not something I would seek out for repeated tries, it was worth the experience. I dig the Big Lebowski reference and I love the ambition of Pipeworks."
"O - Overall, this was a fun beer. Guess its harder to nail this profile than I thought. All the elements are there just wish they were in different degrees. Still, not a bad beer and quite drinkable."

"O: I get it, but I don't get it. This beer is more ""weird for the sake of being weird"" than ""weird in a good way."" I don't regret having it, but won't seek it out again."
"Pipeworks Hey, Careful Man, There's A Beverage Here! ---4/5."

"Overall pretty good, all the flavors combine to a nice White Russian like flavor, although the coffee was a bit too strong but tasty, the oats and lactose made a nice creamy cream feel, coffee and cocoa nibs for the kahlua, and overall beer was a nice big flavorful drink that was enjoyable, and even the beer blended in nicely."

"A noble experiment that indeed has echoes of the infamous White Russian (which I was too poor to drink when I wanted to drink that kind of thing), but ultimately this is a scalding mess of a beer. Still, interesting, pretty good, & certainly worth sampling."

"O: Well if the bottle didn't explicitly say it, I'd say this beer doesn't know what it's trying to be. I have a hard time comprehending it as a milk stout and even harder time trying to comprehend it as anything approaching a White Russian. It's not that it's a bad beer, but I just don't feel like they've replicated, mimicked, or given tribute to the White Russian and I can say I wasn't overly impressed."

"Deep amber/burgundy color with no head at all and minimal bubbles. You can pick up the vanilla, coffee, and booze on the nose. The taste is somewhere between a boozy stout and barleywine. Very different and interesting ""blonde"" stout. It certainly hits on the flavors present in a white russian and the booze is very upfront. Nice warming winter beer. Very inventive and interesting beer that's worth a try, but not quite something I need a lot more of."

"Quite a perplexing beer to review. Nothing is conventional for the style but makes sense with what they're going for. The components are lackluster individually but a fun beer as a whole. This dude abides."

"Overall this was great. I had no idea what to expect from a white RIS. Super rich brew, but better then the dog series in my opinion. Extra kudos on creativity."
"Just another great beer by P-dubs and one people should try if you're looking for these experimental stouts."
""
"Overall: Pipeworks seems to love these additive heavy stouts and this is one of the better ones so far. Every drink seems to bring out different accents of this brew. Love the coffee and cacao aspects with everything being a great supplementary player."
"Had to get this one not only due to Pipeworks genius and creativity, but I'm a huge Big Lebowski fan. Wish I could be bowling right now with Walter, Donnie and the Dude."
