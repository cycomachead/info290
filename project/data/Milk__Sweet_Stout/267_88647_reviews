"This is a solid chocolate milk stout. It's not as exciting as I thought it would be but it was still extremely satisfying. Odell is a solid brewery and this is a solid brew. It's really smooth and not overly carbonated. Great mouthfeel, and thought its strong for a stout (8.5%) it's not overpowering. In fact, there wasn't a the alcohol bite you normally get from an 8.5% beer. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a stout that won't disappoint you."

"Pours a black color with a two finger brown sugar color head.  Aroma is roast, coffee, chocolate, and bittersweet chocolate.  Taste is chocolate, light roast, and maybe a hint of coffee at the end.  Mouthfeel is medium to medium-thick, a bit thinner than some stouts but that by no means takes away from this beer.  Overall one of the better milk stouts I've had, and the chocolate makes it all the more so."

"Very Chocolaty.  Great Milk Stout"

"Love when beer tastes exactly as advertised, tasted like drinking a Hershey bar, without being overly sweet on the tongue and wasn't to heavy, finished creamy yet also pretty carbonated, drank like a chocolate soda with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Really different and pretty delicious. big fan."

"I'm drinking this for the second time in a week! 8.5% abv  pours black with a medium brown head. Definite chocolate notes in the nose as well as roasted coffee. Tastes of milk chocolate without being sickly sweet and has coffee notes. Mouthfeel is a little thin but feels like you actually had a glass of chocolate milk. Drinks really easy for a nice abv %. This was just tapped at the Ginger Man here locally and can't wait to try it on draught! Cheers!"

"very chocolaty, a little boozy, yet somewhat poundable."
""
""
"Sweet stout with milk chocolate taste. Not as dry or bitter as other stouts. Smooth drinking for the high ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nicely put together in all areas; excels in taste and feel. Probably the best chocolate stout I have had. So many of these taste like someone dumped cocoa into a beer. The depth and richness of flavor here stands out."
"I rarely ever pour a beer out, and I love odell, but this is overwhelmingly sweet, so much so it tastes artificial. Like 2% milk mixed with nutrasweet. Really wanted to like this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you let this beer age in the refrigerator for a year, a miracle will happen! It lost all of its alcohol taste, became a little more sweeter, and the chocolate was much more intense. The consistency seemed to be thicker as well, and so much smoother. Thought I was drinking a ""Five Dollar Shake"". This was one of the best Stouts I've ever had, only second to Stranahan's aged Yeti."

"This is an excellent stout.  Dark as night, packed with milk chocolate flavor, and high enough alcohol to really get your attention.  Many stouts are bitter, but this one is not.  Available in four-packs and a bit more expensive than most similar beers, but very much worth it."
""
""
""
""

""

"Fairly light milk stout, very drinkable—even, I'd think, on a warm evening—but, best of all, the layers of chocolate shine through much clearer and cleaner than many other chocolate-premised stouts I've had. Nice sweetness, toeing the line nicely between clean and cloying—and aided in this by the very detectable presence of the chocolate notes and their attendant bitterness. Not much nose, outside of dry malty sugars and the faintest hint of lactose carried though out of the tulip's curve. Very dark, and slightly mahogany-brown when held to light, this somewhat still, light mouth-feel stout seems to fairly well achieve its ends—though I think, given the sweetness, it'd pair much better with a hunk of meat than a dessert."

"Thick and dark with a nice amber head, though it doesn't stay around very long. This is the best chocolate stout I have had to date, and my personal favorite beer as of yet. Odell does it right. My only problem with this beer is that it is a 4 pack seasonal :(..."

"BIG TIME EDIT: I just realized this beer is classified as a stout... I know that porters are stouts, and stouts are porters, but this changes things. This is a little weak for a stout. Too carbonated, too light. Still Good. Carry on."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's a pretty good beer with some nice flavors and solid execution. It's pretty smooth and easy drinking as well."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and lactose aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and lactose flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a nice balance of cocoa and lactose characteristics."
""
""
"O - This is great but a bit one dimensional. The chocolate is prominent but it's just about the only flavor I get. Wish this was more complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I know there are so many other milk stouts out there that are great but this is the best chocolate milk stout I have tasted so far. If you want the next best thing to chocolate milk with alcohol then this is the beer to give it to you. This is one of my every day beers to drink on."

"Overall a really tasty beer, but it is one the far side of sweet for the style."

"Pours out a very deep, dark brown with a very thin head the color of chocolate milk. Smells of chocolate, chocolate malt, bready malts, and a bit of Euro hops. Chocolate isn't as strong as the nose as I would have expected. This beer is SWEET. Too sweet for me. Nice chocolate flavor, but it needs some bitterness (either from roasted grain or hops) to balance it out. I get a kind of jelly fruitiness from the yeast, that I'm not fond of. Mouthfeel is moderate-full and sticky. This beer isn't bad, but it isn't my cup of tea. Does an exceptional job of hiding alcohol. Needs more balance with the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"This is a unique beer and I really enjoyed it, I wish the nose was a little more inductive of the nice taste but that's my only real criticism."
""

"Smooth and dreamy like a sickeningly sweet pop song that ends with an unexpected kick."

"Love it. I can forgive the higher ABV (for my liking) cause this is so flavorful and enjoyable to drink. A really good imperial sweet stout. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O- Excellent beer, not much out there like it. Very good, I wouldn't call it easy to drink as it's a sipping beer."
"Thanks go to Craig for the beer!"
""
"Initial pour is dark brown with minimal head. First sniff I can't detect anything then it hits you in the backend of creamy chocolate. A nice fairly sweet beer. Really tastes like milk has been used in the brewing process. Not a strong chocolate taste at all but the milk is highly detectable. Fairly strong alcohol finish. I really liked this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Would pair well with chocolate. Obviously. And hazelnuts."
""
""
""
"O - I never bothered to get a 4 pack of this beer, but I'm very glad to have tried it on tap. I think the nitro tap helped this beers mouthfeel and appearance. I bet the bottled version wouldn't drink nearly as well. Great stuff, one of my new favorite milk stouts. Up there with Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate!"

"Mmmm, have now enjoyed 3 bottles of this at various temperatures. Cold, warming, and nearly room temperature and it works at all 3 levels. A nearly silkly smooth stout (about as close to nitro as you can get w/o being nitro), and a perfect level of chocolate flavor. I can't stand chocolate stouts that are too heavy on the chocolate - it's beer not YooHoo."
"OK, well that's more like it. The first thing I notice is just how incredibly creamy and smoothe it is. It's decently carbonated, too, so to have the effervescence playing off your tongue and still have an overwhelmingly creamy experience... it's a good 'un. The flavours are as you would expect: sweet creamy chocolate dominates everything else, with the sweet being bolstered by a definite lactose... sweetness. I figured this would be dessert, and it fits that bill quite well. There's some general roastiness and a hint of the thought of considerations of coffee perhaps, though that could just be a Pavlovian response to expecting to find it in dark beers. milky, syrupy goodness through and through."

"Glossy sable black, decent head of mocha that dissipates quickly. Great looking beer. Smell is an initial flash of piney, crisp-fruit hops, like grapes. No real chocolate, but some coffee, lightly. Taste is an odd thing- initial taste is of vinous fruitiness, like grapes. Not what I'm expecting from a self-declared chocolate milk stout. Throws off the whole beer. There is some light pseudo cocoa tates, but the overall impression is of apple sweetness, herbaly hops and an odd finish. Taste is poor, i do not care for this beer."
""
""
""
""

"This is Odell's winter Milk Stout made with chocolate. Overall, the beer smells good and taste decent, but it's the flabby, wet finish that really leaves a lot to be desired. Not a bad beer by any means, I just prefer my stouts to finish a tad more dry. For being 8.5%, the beer is very easy drinking, but at the end of the day, it's just not really my style."
"Overall, this is a pretty good, and strongly sweet beer. Not quite a creamy and sweet as other chocolate stouts, but still very chocolatey in a darker way. Malt flavors and higher alcohol combine to make this the adult version of lighter and sweeter chocolate stouts."
""
"O - 4.0 - It's good, but not amazing."

"Pours very dark red-brown color with a small, instantly disappearing beige head, seems quite fizzy too leaving a nice sugary layer on the glass. Aroma has milky chocolate, some fruity dark malts and caramel. Flavor is quite chocolaty too, faint vanilla, caramel malts and lingering fruitiness on the finish. Strong carbonation, creamy, roasty, sugary and chocolaty palate. Could have been a bit heavier on the body and a bit less carbonated, still quite nice though."

"Overall, pretty nice. Not the best chocolate stout in my opinion, but definitely one of the better ones that has an actual milk chocolate taste to it and is balanced with a perfect amount of sweetness. I could sit around on a cold winters night and drink a couple no problem. It's smooth and pleasant and not pushy, definitely worth a try... and in a try I mean you might as well buy a four pack."
"Overall - I don't love the style, but this has a great chocolate flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lugene pours a black color, with very little head at all. There is a boozy chocolate like aroma. The taste is a nice chocolate flavor, wwith a strong ""milk"" or lactose sugar flavor, a lot of the alcohol comes through as well. Good full flavors, nice body, crisp carbonation. Overall its a boozier chocolaty stout."
""
""
""
"I enjoy Left hands milk stout, so I thought I would really be happy with this ""Imperial"" Milk Stout. I like the flavor profile: it is sweet, rich, and complex as hopped for and of course you can sense the alcohol at 8.5% abv. However, all other aspects of the beer fall short: the aroma isn't particularly inspiring and the carbonation is way too fizzy. Not only does this give the beer a head more reminiscent of a soda than a craft-Stout, but the mouthfeel is no longer creamy. Perhaps doing this on Nitro would correct that. For me this is a solid brew, but not quite good good enough to warrant purchasing another premium-priced 4-pack in the near future."

"This is by far my favorite milk stout. A complete pleasure to drink and I can't taste the ABV at all. All hail Odell!"
""
"D: This one surprised me (in a good way) on several levels...the ABV is 8.5% (much higher than your typical milk stout)...and it was also amazingly smooth. Not too complex, but what it does it does very well. An outstanding brew...seek it out!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Nice beer. I bought a single of this and thought it read ""chocolate mint stout""...time for reading glasses I guess. Nicely done beer. Could drink a couple or three of these in a sitting..."
"Reminiscent of Guinness in terms of appearance. As dark brown as you can go without being black. Does not let light through. Smell that roasted malt and milk chocolate. It's dessert time! Like carbonated,alcoholic chocolate milk sans milk. Viscous mouthfeel. Somewhat of an alcoholic aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Overall this was a tasty brew. Paired well with the chocolate cupcakes we had for dessert. a nice way to finish the night!"
""
""
""
"Great beer with a wonderful finish. I could drink this all day long if it wasn't for the ABV. Great story behind the name as well. One of the best chocolate stouts i have had in a long time. I've had in bottle, nitro, and draft, as well as a few firkins. I keep going back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent milk chocolate stout. Not too sweet like a lot of these are, but sweet nonetheless. Nice full smooth body lends to excellent drinkability. A little savory umami adds a layer of complexity to an otherwise pure chocolate milk stout. Nice brew."
"Consumed on 6/14/13"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I will definitely purchase/rate this again. I've had it before and remember it being SO much better, I'm not familiar with infected beers, but this could be my first. Perhaps my senses were shot after that Mycenary. I know this is a far better brew than my rating has shown, I'm saddened. We'll see."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think the longer I drink this, the more chocolate milk comes out. At first it seems like a bunch of individual parts thrown together, but in the end it made more sense."
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: Relatively strong for a milk stout, this beer hides its 8.5% abv well as it delivers the promised chocolate. While the smell is simplistic, the taste is focused on chocolate but with enough room for other features. It is texturally very strong, doing everything that a stout should."
""
"O: Exceptional beer. I could drink this any time of the year, so I am sad that it is a seasonal. If you see this and haven't had it, you should."

""

"Thanks to koufax21 for bringing this to the March Madness 2013 bottle share. Of course, a big no thanks to David Hurley, bar guy at El Dorado, for going back on the El Dorado's word of supporting our bottle share. These guys don't support craft beer, they don't support loyal customers. Grade A jerk."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, oatmeal, hint of sour, slight roasted malt, pale malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and creamy with a low carbonation level. Reminiscent of a Baltic Porter. Tastes of roasted malt, tartness, sweet malt, hint of hop, and slight oatmeal. Overall, very weak appearance, but decent aroma, good body, and good blend."
""
""
""
"This is a perfectly fine drink. No where near the best milk stout I've experienced."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I liked this beer.  It has a nice dark body that produced a nice thick brown head, which was not well retained.  A better aroma, with coffee notes.  The beer fell down a bit on the taste, as I did not enjoy the alcohol flavor that it gave off.  The beer had a good feel to it, nice and thick.  A good beer and one that I will have again."
""
"Overall an incredible enjoyable beer. It is smooth for how big it is and it is just so well rounded. I would highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
"Opaque black-brown with a thin cap of khaki foam, fits of lace. Smells of sweet and semi-sweet chocolate, cream, roasted malt. Taste is smooth and velvety with mild milk chocolate, light roast malt, lightly cream sweet with late bittering hops which provide a clean finish and crisp breaking off point for the next sip. Light alcohol presence. Reminds of Obsidian but more powerful. Tasty."
""
"O - Looks like this bottle went bad. Vinegar off-notes really ruined the beer."
""
""
""
""

"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, chewy and smooth on the tongue. A delicious, chocolate-forward stout, although I wish the nose was as impressive as the profile was."

"ODell Lugene Chocolate Milk Stout: You will pour pure magical blackness into the glass, but a fine head will form to keep the elixir in its place. The aroma is subtle. The flavor is big, bold and spot on chocolate milk. There are Imperial Russian Stouts that I like better, but if you want a chocolate milk stout, man, this is the one! I wish my fifth grade milk program served this brew. Top it off with the humorous label and ODell has a winner on its hands. Must try beer. You may get your wife into stouts with this creation, and your kids as well!"
"o - solid milk stout and one i would go to again. i was expecting more but still a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Milk chocolate and easy drinking. Solid."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Medium bodied and pretty creamy. Again though, it turns a bit hot on the end and drinkability is not high at all. Very much a one-and-done type of beer. Overall, a very flavorful milk stout that is pretty enjoyable and unique. Would probably buy again at some point if given the chance."
""
""
"I remember when Young's Double Chocolate Stout was first tasted, I thought it was the most sultry thing I had ever tasted. Though there have been more advancement in chocolate, body, alcohol, and sweetness- none has yet to capture that type of taste in elevated form ... 'til now. This should be a highly celebrated ale for such humble underpinnings. I have a feeling Lugene has a pint or two waiting for him, and not on his dime."
""
""
"Overall, this is my favorite chocolate stout. I like the sweetness, I like the bit of alcohol warmth, and its just delicious to sip on. If you like the style, I would say this a must try."
"Final Thoughts: I've been a fan of Odell Brewing Company ever since getting into craft and have been looking forward to trying a stout from them. Lugene Milk Chocolate Stout does not disappoint. If you enjoy dark creamy beers then give it a try. Would I drink it again? Yes."
"The body is sweet. To me its too sweet. Would have liked it toned down but that is part of the appeal. There is a oatmeal like texture as well. Carbonation is soft which helps the milky feel linger. Overall nice chocolate notes but could use some more stout characters."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very tasty beer. I would definitely buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this brew is fantastic, incredibly easy drinking and I could easily toss back a few of these in a single sitting. Nice to find a rich brew, higher in ABV that can be easily sessioned. I wish my in-laws were able to grab a few more bottles, but I'm definitely glad they were able to get the one. Highly recommended."
"Really enjoyed this, the ABV is well hidden. If you like chocolate, this a stellar offering. I'll take this over the uber-hyped Boulevard Chocolate ale & true to style, but wish this would've delivered a bit more on the asthetics"
""
"Serve in tap at the brewery. Appearance is dark brown with tan head and plenty of lacing. Nose is full of deep roasted malts with hints of vanilla, chocolate, and lactose sugar. The taste starts with chocolate and roast and is followed by hefty vanilla extract notes. Nice balance. Mouthfeel is light with low carbonation. Overall, nice flavors here with a light overall character for such a strong milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a solid and well balanced beer. maybe not as aggressive with the chocolate flavors as some, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."
"Tangy and surprisingly drinkable, though you really have to like chocolate a lot. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Jubilation Fine Wines in Albuquerque."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pair this with the cd Isaac Hayes Chocolate Chip. Then move on."
"Sweet stout, really pairs well with desserts or as one. The chocolate notes are spot on and deliver what is promised on the label. Slow sipper and falls right in line with the other good offerings in the Odell series."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really good sweet/milk stout. Good creamy chocolate flavor with a moderate sweetness. Really nailed the style."
""
"Overall a really great milk stout."
""
"O-I like this beer, but it is suffering from something of an identity crisis. When I think of milk stouts, I think of lower ABV, creamier style beers. This brew, however, drinks more like a chocolate-infused RIS than a sweet/milk stout. The flavors here are intense and the alcohol is vocal, and while these are not bad things, I found myself looking for a bit more subtlety and nuance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really liked it. It is the sweetest beer I have had yet, which is to a degree that is its only downfall. Very good though."
""
"8.2/10"
"This was my first milk stout and it lived up to its promise. Appearance was chocolatey dark, with very little head. Taste at first favored a roasty nature, but as I drank more the chocolate and sweetness came through. Virtually no hop aroma or flavor, which suited me. I did not match this well with dinner (salmon), but it went perfectly with dessert -- a chocolate, coconut, caramel cupcake. That was an ideal combination."
"A really nice beer. Definitely nails the chocolate milk, but has enough beer to it that I don't feel like an elementary school kid watching afternoon cartoons. Quite good, and one I'll pick up again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid all around, nice balance. Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Absolutely delicious! This is one of my favorite stouts ever."
"This is a big brew, 12oz bottle took a while to conquer though I did not complain once. Seek this one out for something completely different."
""
"This beer was sent to me by GHB. Thanks man!! This poured out as a deep black color with a nice looking brown head on top. The retention is decent but there isn't much lacing at all here. The smell of the beer is roasted and has a subtle sweetness. There is a hint of chocolate on the nose too. The taste of the beer is very good, A very nice balanced roasted creamy sweetness with a chocolaty bittersweet finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and very smooth. Overall it's a very good brew. Can't wait to have more."
"Good, but the overly pressing lactose puts me off some - overrides the rest of the otherwise quality flavors."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is a quarter inch of tan foam that recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of melted milk chocolate, with hints of roasted malt beneath. The taste is full of chocolate with some nice roasted malt and graham cracker notes rounding things out. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a silky chewy texture, and appropriately mild carbonation. Overall, this might not be a mind blowing chocolate stout, but it is a damn good one."
""
""
"I like Lugene quite a bit. I’m glad Odell put out this kind of beer. I think I prefer it over Samuel Smith’s new chocolate stout."
""
""
"Overall- This was a nice extra. Great on this cold snowy NH night."
""
"Overall this is a great beer. This is probably my second favorite beer brewed with lactose sugar behind Three Floyds Apocalypse Cow, though of course both are completely different beers. Point being when I saw the Odell type label but one that I didn't recognize I scooped one up to buy before I even knew exactly what it was, and this is for good reason. Odell really does not disappoint!"
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. I'd have more of this."
""
"Overall: I'm a big milk stout fan and this one does not disappoint. Sweet, but not too sweet, big flavors while being very drinkable. Glad I picked up a 4 pack and I might have to get another one before it's gone."
"O-delicious stout with lucious chocolate flavor and gr eat smoothness, really enjoyable after dinner"
"Overall: Do not drink this beer unless you really enjoy chocolate because this has got to be one of the ""chocolatiest"" beers that I have drank. Another really enjoyable beer from this brewery that stilll seems to remain a secret. I have no idea why either... the are always brewing fantastic everyday beers that are approachable for the craft beer newbie, but still satisfy a dercerning palate of a vertern craft beer drinker! Nice beer O'dells! This one is just as good as Moo hoo by Terrapin maybe even a little better!"
""
""
"Overall, an OK milk stout with a few off notes. Not as sweet as I thought it would be. A bit pricey at $10 per 4 pack."
""
""
""
"Medium to full bodied, with below average carbonation. Creamy. smooth, and easy to drink. I would gladly buy this again."
""
""
"The palate immediately reminds me of Southern Tier's chocolate stouts... rather artificial, creamy and sweet, some kind of metallic cocoa powder on the finish. Maybe a bit of coffee is buried in here somewhere as well. I'm glad I only grabbed a single of this one."
"O: A great beer! Its definitely a desert beer. Best milk stout I have tried yet. Let it warm up, the chocolate flavors become more defined as is warms."

"O - This is a really good. Odell has blown me away with all their new awesome beers."

"O: Tasty, if a bit sweet; hey, this is a sweet stout. Milk chocolate and lactose comes through brilliantly. Pretty nice."

"My take: A sweet and excellent beer. Not overpowering enough to make a bad day great, but the perfect compliment to other quiet joys. This beer makes me happy."
"Overall, this is solid, but nothing spectacular. Worth a try if you like the chocolate notes to come through."
"This is pretty good but not something I'd drink much of. Too high on the abv scale for me."
"Feels sweet and smooth. Carbonation is just right to get the feel of the chocolate. Nice beer"

"Pours thick and dark with a brownish head. Wow-chocolate jumps from the glass. First sip tells you this is something to be savored. Velvety mouthfeel, and full, deep, rich flavor. This beer is decadent. I don't think I could drink more than 1 (okay 3) in a sitting. The vanilla character complements the chocolate and sweet lactose flavor very well. Wish is was a bit drier, rather than sweet, but after all, it is a milk stout. Chocolate Milk for adults is the best way to describe this beer. Find it!"

"12oz bottle, i think the four pack was $11. Dark black color, tan head, standard stout appearance. Aroma is mostly dark chocolate with a tinge of stout Flavor is more chocolate, cocoa powder, alcohol. Slightly sweet. I've read lots of comparisons to chocolate milk and while this is indeed chocolate heavy I really don't agree, its just chocolate beer. Honestly, a glass of Horizon chocolate milk tastes better than this does."

"not quite what i expected, but it does taste like chocolate milk, so i guess i should have had different expectations? in any event, this is a tasty brew, if a bit odd. pours a dead sexy dark chocolate color with a tall foamy head the color, believe it or not, of nesquick chocolate milk, a few inches tall and really bubbly. i smell sweet chocolate and lactose sugars, as promised. its not sugary though like a normal milk stout, its just balanced out like a bar of semisweet chocolate of the finest quality. i would have liked to see a little more earthy dark malt character, maybe some dark german malt would have rounded this out a bit, for now its just really chocolate heavy. the feel though, itsnt heavy at all. the alcohol is invisible and the body is quite light for a big stout. plenty of carbonation also keeps it light, but id like to try this one from the bottle before i make any permanent judgements. overall a clever new odell brew, who can really do no wrong as far as im concerned."

"Overall: This is exactly as advertised - a chocolate milk stout. Quite enjoyable, but I would like a little more bite and/or dryness."

"This is wonderful. Like drinking chocolate milk beer. Odell does it again. Dessert in a bottle, much like those chocolate cream liquors (Godiva, etc.) you can buy now. Wow, am I digging this."

"D - I love the chocolate character, but it's too restrained and largely unremarkable. Pretty average."

"This brew is fantastic. It would be amazing with a drop shot of Baileys.. I would drink this every day if I could.. Highly recommended and should be tried by everyone!! Appearance and aroma are the only things lacking. A great brew with a great logo/label. Another home run Odell, keep it up"
"O - I had been dying to see this on the store shelves. I am not disappointed. It is a great stout. A little sweet for my liking, but I will enjoy the 4 pack. Another great offering from Odell."

"Pours a dark, deep brown with a nice mocha head, not much if any lacing though. A sweet, mildly rich aroma of some melted milk chocolate, lactic sugars, and just a touch of some roasted malt. Flavor is very sweet and chocolatey;starts off with the sweetness from the sugar, the chocolate builds and midtsream it is coming at you full bore like the taste of a melted milk chocolate bar sitting in your mouth, and a kiss of vanilla in as it finishes. There seems to be a hint of some roastiness there as well. The alcohol is dangerously hidden in this one. This is pretty much chocolate milk for those older than 21. A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, Odell with another winner that shines as it warms up a bit. Having tried a few of the pilot batches that lead to Lugene, this was definitely not my favorite overall variation (thpugh it is certainly up there). Chocolate Oar, with it being roastier and not as sweet, was my favorite and I'd have loved for them to have kept that type of sweet/roasty balance for this one. That said, I am certainly happy with what they did finally come up wih and its about time Odell has a nice bottled stout on the shelves. If you like sweeter milk chocolate, if you like beer, you should like this."
