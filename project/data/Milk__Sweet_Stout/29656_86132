Aroma is vanilla right off the bat, with roasted malts and chocolate. Flavor is sweet with lots of vanilla and a nice roastiness to balance out the sweetness. Mouthfeel is very creamy with medium carbonation and a medium body for a higher abv milk stout. Overall a great and unique take on the style, not too sweet, very nice.","stephenjmoore","Mar 09, 2015"

That doesn't mean they can drink 2 of them, but everyone agrees the flavor is like a chocolate bar made love to a coffee bean then their child grew up to make love to a world class stout and now we have this.  $11 for a 4-pack hurts, but it's really priced fairly.","MPLESE","Feb 09, 2015"

The smell is chocolate and citrus. The taste is a wallop of chocolate up front, then recedes into a woody, dry finish. Very nice indeed. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Overall, I really like this beer. It has a great, deep flavor without being as acidic as some beers malted this darkly can be. It hides the alcohol well and promises a great time. Besides, who can't love a beer that says right on the bottle that it pairs well with sin?","roblowther","May 15, 2014"

Syrupy roasted malt flavor, pungent peatiness, and some sweetness for balance right in the middle. Overall, this is a really good quaff.","bmwats","Jun 11, 2013"

However, there is one thing that stands out: it is excellent. I just don't know why...and it's not just the gratuitous ABV. The feel of this drink is so smooth and creamy, it's rather incredible. The taste is excellent: maybe that is a roasted, chocolate flavor; I just can't tell. The key thing is that whatever components are in this, it makes an all-around, well-mixed, overly-enjoyable brew. This is now my favorite milk stout. I will get this again...as soon as a friend from Dallas brings it to me once more.","TeamMathis","Beers"

The finish is long and dusty with the alcohol finally making its presence known. The mouthfeel is very nice, the beer is perfectly carbonated and the body is silky smooth. It is not as heavy and sweet as I thought from the aroma, but it is more than enough to compliment a 8.5% ABV. This is quite a tasty treat, I am looking forward to getting some more of this on my next trip up to the metroplex!","twiggamortis420","Jan 12, 2013"
