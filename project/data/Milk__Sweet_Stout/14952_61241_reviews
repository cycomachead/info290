"Overall- A real good find, I would drink this again."
"Had it on tap, so the initial pour looked fantastic but by the time I made the 30' walk back to the table, the head completely disappeared. Decent legs, but no real lacing to speak of. Nose carried a little bourbon but wasn't' an overwhelming aroma. Taste is where this thing wins (and I guess all that really matters, right?). Never had a more balanced BA stout, ever. Bourbon was certainly there but not overwhelming, little to no heat at all and not cloyingly sweet. Just a damn fine tasting beverage. Period. Other than being a little thin, this is a little jackpot of a beer!"

"A very enjoyable beer even if it doesn't fit it's """style""" as much as I'd like."
"Aroma of coffee, vanilla, mild bourbon & wood, malt. Taste sweet creamy coffee, malt, vanilla, faint bourbon & oak, chocolate. Nice!"

"Draft.  Pours dark black with creamy brown head. Think. Lingers. Aromas of roasted malts and good Italian coffee.  Taste good strong espresso coffee with chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla.  Something bitter buried deep.  Best taste is the strong espresso.  Heavy stout.  No carbonation. Strong espresso and malt aftertaste.  Smooth though.  Very drinkable.  Like it as much or better than Evil Twin Donut Break.  Very good imperial stout."

"Really a beer to get excited about, if you see it. I think this is an absolute homerun for the boys out of Williamsburg. Last time I got this bottle, I liked it so much I """cellared""" one for about 14 months. It was still very good when I opened it, but lost some of the vibrancy and balance that make this beer, and I didn't think the mellowed flavors were an improvement, nor worth the wait. I may still stock up, but it won't be for the long hall."

"OVERALL: It's not bad at this point, and the tartness might even be seen as somewhat pleasant, but I can't imagine this was intentional. Definitely something starting to take over here, which is unfortunate, as I'd heard good things about this beer. Something I'd like to try again sometime, but not this particular batch."

"This beer is just a superb balance of roasted malts, bourbon-barrel flavors, coffee, and bitter chocolate. It gets better and better as it goes down, with just the right amount of alcohol, a nice touch of sweetness, and while a tad thin in mouthfeel, it doesn't detract from the enjoyment at all. I have a bottle for aging, so I'll give that a try to see what it does for the sweet flavors. Outstanding."

"Bottle from trade with Ken. Thanks! Pours black with a half finger creamy mocha head. Aroma of bourbon, earthy coffee, chocolate, oak...a bit heavy on the sharp bourbon smell. Flavor is roast up front, a little sweet lactose, with a straight bourbon finish. Not much coffee to taste. There isn't much else going on here. Velvety smooth with medium carbonation, and medium bodied. Overall I am psyched I got to try this, but these lighter stouts and porters just can't stand up to the bourbon. I can't get into this one. Meh."

"The beer pours a very light and cream brown head. The beer itself is a dark chocolate black and appears a little slick on the surface. The beer smells tend to be distinct but mix very well. The smells vary from milk chocolate, bourbon, cocoa, and a bit of an alcohol note as well. The alcohol note is very minor but the bourbon smell is fairly strong compared to the other notes. However, the milk chocolate taste takes over it as it warms up. The taste is a different from the smell in that the bourbon taste is not as strong as the smell. The milk chocolate taste actually dominates the tongue instead with the bourbon complementing the taste. Other slight notes include cocoa and a bit of a dark fruit taste as well. The beer feels surprisingly smooth such that it also feels creamy and heavy bodied. Overall, a pretty good sweet stout and worth getting when it's available."
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It was decent but not as good as I was expecting. All the advertised flavors are present in equal levels but nothing really stands out to make it memorable."

"A little thin for a stout, but done to style. Loads of chocolate on the nose and in the taste. Goes down very smooth. Hints of oak and bourbon as it warms. Definitely a well done stout and one to seek out if you're a fan of coffee and chocolate. Coffee is more subdued and played well."

"This beer pours a nice, dark black with a mocha head. The smell is sweet bourbon and chocolate. The taste is similar, starting out with bitter dark chocolate, finishing with coffee undertones and a sweet bourbon finish (this is where the fact that it's a barrel aged milk stout really comes out). Solid brew."

"Doug and I were both very impressed with this one. Its a beer where the barrel treatment makes a definite contribution, but still allows the base beer and its adjuncts to stand out. This was a delicious beer with a lot of depth. Highly recommended if you enjoy milk stouts."
"After awhile, and plenty of swirling, the carbonation died down and the mouthfeel became medium heavy with a really nice finish. This also allowed for more of the sweetness in the flavor to come through, bumped the mouthfeel from 2.25 to 3.5 (since the issue was present) and the flavor up from 4 to 4.5."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really nicely balanced and tasty coffee stout with a light bourbon influence. The coffee adds a really great flavor and is elevated by the malt sweetness and the barrels. A really nice surprise and awesome value. Definitely one of my favorite bourbon barrel coffee stouts."

"The beer pours a deep black with loose lacing and a thin tan halo of head. The nose is a potent caramel sweetness upfront with a hint of vanilla, but little coffee or booze. The taste is obviously great caramel sweetness upfront, with a hint of bitter, roasty coffee, and very little bourbon. Rounded-out chocolatey, full-bodied, smooth sweetness without bitterness or booze defines this potent coffee BA milk stout. I'd love to drink this beer again, but think it lacks the bourbon and coffee I've come to expect with its world-class drinking status."

"O; This is an extremely enjoyable drinking experience. It's not an overly complex beer, and I didn't think the bourbon barrel flavor stood out that much, but the beer works as a whole. To me, that is more important than any gimmick or process used to make the beer. This one just tastes wonderful."
"I'm definitely going to get another of these -- Correction: I'm going to buy several more of these for future consumption!"

"Kmwith a nice tan head. Awesome nose. Coffee stuck out huge. With a touch a bourbon. Drank really smooth. Lots of flavour and thr perfect beer with derby pie. Huge chocolate and cofee of course. Loves this beer. Great for desserts"
""
""
"It's an amazing beer all around. Great smells, a little complexity in the taste, and drinkable."
""
""
"This is probably the best milk/coffee stout hybrid I've ever had. It's a great compliment to the flavors and style, this turned out exceptionally well and drinks like nothing. One of the easiest barrel aged stout beers to drink I've ever had. After note, I am not a milk stout fan. So that says something right there..."

""
""
""
""
" Is that a byproduct if the lactose or barrel?"
"8.6/10"

"O: For everything I wish had changed about this beer, I still think it's outstanding for a milk stout. Probably my second or third favorite I've ever had for this style. 4.5"
"Opaque black appearance which fades to a reddish mahogany around the rim. Pours with little head but nice lacing. Aromas open with vanilla, coffee and then a distinct bourbon note that contains oak and more vanilla. Initial tastes of vanilla and coffee bean, then finishing with bourbon and bitter chocolate. Mouth feel is viscous but not overly syrupy, and some nice effervescence keeps it from being too heavy. Other than the bourbon notes this does not taste overly alcoholic and is very drinkable. A great brunch beer or with (or for) dessert after dinner."
"O: I think this beer is fantastic....alewerks has really outdone themselves with this beer. The beer completely changes notes once its warmed up, which I think is for the better. The bourbon compliments the sweet vanilla and chocolate notes perfectly even though I'm not a huge bourbon fan. I cant wait to see how these other bottles age."
""
""
""
""
""
"My only issue with the beer is the mouthfeel. The base beer feels amazing, but the bourbon flavors translate into a strong upfront bite that is the only real problem with this beer."
""
"Virginia whale delivered by @blackie. Really a decadent beer - lots of fudge, layered chocolate cake, cookie dough, chocolate covered espresso, bourbon. Hazelnut, brown sugar, luminescent of an iced cappucino or something other sugar-jacked starbucks creation. This one drinks dangerously easy, but after a few servings, you'll likely need to be screened for diabetes. Would definitely drink this one again."
""
"O Could have had more coffee intensity to balance out the sweetness. A bit more chocolate depth and longer barrel aging could also have improved this brew. The hop additions were acceptable. But could have been slightly more bitter for my taste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Just freaking great...surpassed Lefthand's Milk Stout, which I never thought would happen...well worth the time and money"
""
""
""
""

"Fantastic beer. The 2012 version was drank on tap at the tasting room and had a great balance of bourbon and flavor. One of the best barrel aged stouts I have had recently. Excited to try it out of the bottle as this beer tasted so good on draft. Cheers!"
""
""
"Cafe Royale is one of those beers that is nice to have """in your backyard""" with easy access to. A very delightful stout that any stout lover should try and get a ho"
"Smooth and remarkably soft on the palate. Not too sweet with the year's worth of aging. Mellow, sweet-ish nightcap. Great as a dessert by itself. Would also be good with a cheese plate to bring out the lactose a bit more."
"Probably the best of the style I've ever had. The flavors are perfectly balanced and the bourbon is assertive yet mellow. Smells great and drinks like a dream. Wish I could get my hands on more of this."
"O - Café Royale was a total sleeper hit the first time I had it. I knew what to expect the second time around and this complex beer still surprised me with loads of nuances and depth. Masterfully blended, the barrel aging adds quite a bit to the beer. A dessert treat to be sure, this is one beer you don't want to miss."

"O: This is a beer for the candy addicts and those with a major sweet tooth. It's good, but it's way too sweet for me. I'm happy to have tried it, but I don't want to drink this again."
""
""
""
"Pours a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, with a nice little fizzy dark tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a lot of chocolate/toffee, nice little bourbon note, and a very nice touch of vanilla. The taste is sweet, malty, lots of dark stuff going on here, slight bourbon note. Medium body, pretty complex brew, really. Overall this one really surprised me, glad to have a chance to try it. Thanks Dick!"

""
""
""
"Very highly recommend this brew."
""
""
""
"Pours a jet black hue with a thin head that recedes quickly. Absolutely ZERO lacing. The smell on this is robust, but sweet. A nice combination of roasted coffee and vanilla intermingling with some nice bourbon notes. The taste is all coffee all the time. Nice and roasty, malty, with a load of sweet vanilla. The bourbon is completely absent in the taste, which is unfortunate. Fortunately the rest of the flavors pick up the slack. The mouth is a bit thin, but such is life with porters. Otherwise it's quite smooth with just a lingering bitterness from the coffee. Overall, this is solid. I'm not a fan of porters as a rule of thumb...but this is awesome."
"Bottle generously shared by a friend. Poured into a pint glass. Huge coffee and bourbon aroma. Smell also contains some yellow cake batter, coconut, and smooth rich malt. Taste is rich sweet malt tempered by coconut, bourbon and coffee. This beer is average when compared to the other coffee beers on market."
"Overall: Fantastic beer that goes down easy and has plenty of character. Glad I have another bottle of this puppy."
""
"This is an enjoyable bourbon barrel aged stout. I think I read that they age this in second-use bourbon barrels. This gives Cafe Royale the pleasant character of wood & bourbon without overpowering the many great layers of well integrated flavors."
""
""
"D - Very well done beer, big coffee notes mingle well with the bourbon. Should try harder to get this when it releases next year."
""
"Bottle to oversized tulip. Thanks to ksurkin for this one. Looks good; black with thin lacing. Smells good too; malty and bourbony. Tastes very good. I like how the bourbon flavors married with the milk stout (I had my concerns about this). Mouthfeel is good; would improve with age. Overall, a tasty brew that I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try."
"O: I had this in my fridge and I was nonplussed with my first few sips. As it warmed, though, it really opened up and wowed me. A very unique brew, that is more than just a coffee or barrel aged stout. The milky, lactic finish really makes this stand apart. It drinks much like it's namesake...I'd swear I was having an iced mocha from Starbucks with a pinch of bourbon. Here, here for a beer well done."
""
"*Edit: I liked the second bottle I had a lot more. Bourbon character came out more in the aroma and taste, overall feel was smoother, body was fuller...don't know what they did different in this batch, but it bumped the rating right up from a 4.0 to a 4.25 easily. Thanks to pdeepak for the share!"
"I knew this would focus coffee but it could have been a little more balanced out with a stronger bourbon barrel presence. Good but to me this was just more of a thinner Coffee stout without much more to it."
"Fuller body, decent carbonation, creamy and smooth on the tongue. Drinks very nicely, and the coffee and barrel flavors aren't too overboard."
""
"This poured out as a thick black looking brew with a tan colored head on top. The head fades rather quickly just leaving a foamy ring around the edges of the glass. The smell of this beer is pretty impressive. Lots of sweet caramel, vanilla and coffee notes. The taste is great. Lots of Vanilla and Chocolate notes with some sweet roasted malty caramel and coffee to bitter it out in the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and thick feeling with a light carbonation level. Overall this is a damn good brew. I'm starting to like Williamsburg AleWerks more and more."
""
"The Cafe Royale Milk Stout is fantastic. It drinks very smooth and easy. Of course it is a rather heavy beer but delicious. It drinks so easy that I anticipated it having a very low ABV and pleasently suprised to see that it is an 8% beer. Williamsburg makes solid beers and this on is right up there with their best."
"Thick, chewy, full bodied. Great carbonation. It's a delightful beer."
""
""
"Typical dark black stout. minimal head. Smell is of bourbon and roasted malts. hints of nuts in the background as well. A little chocolate. Flavor is bourbon, vanilla, chocolate. All somewhat subtle but blending together nicely. Slightly sweet. Silky and slick, but not oily. This is a nice beer. It's a nice different take to have a milk stout that is barrel aged and it works nicely."
"O - I totally agree with the Williamsburg AleWerks website when it says Cafe Royale is a """high octane version of our Coffeehouse Stout.""" The balance of aromas and flavors in this beer is very well done, allowing the coffee, chocolate, milky sweetness, bourbon, and hops to blend together almost perfectly. Having been aged in bourbon barrels, I thought the bourbon flavor/aroma would come through more than it actually does. However, this doesn't disappoint me at all as I prefer the bourbon to not steal the spotlight of the beer. Overall, I'd say this is one of the best beers I've had that's brewed right here in the state of Virginia. It may not be until next year, but when I see this beer again, I am stocking up."
"Thumbs up. An enjoyable and trade-worthy brew."
"Slightly chewy medium body with a good balance of roasted coffee, bourbon, oak and dark malt. The barrel character is well integrated into the beer without becoming a one dimensional bourbon bomb. Decent amount of sweet bourbon flavor without much heat as well as some vanilla and dry, toasted oak that meshes very well with the coffee flavor. Deep and roasted without ever approaching acrid/burnt or harsh. There's also a good amount of sweetness countering the coffee flavor. Hints of lactic sugar, dark chocolate, caramel and oatmeal. Just a touch of bitterness mid palate but overall this beer is really well balanced and easy to drink. Could use a bit more bourbon but still pretty impressive."
""
"O: Alewerks does some really nice brews, but I think this is their crowning accomplishment! For you traders: I've heard that multiples of this one trades for some brewery only releases. Cool!"
""
"O: A very enjoyable, well done beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this and would definitely have it again. Recommended."
""
""
"A great coffee/sweet stout, with VERY subtle barrel aging. One of the more interesting flavor profiles I've found for the style."
""
""
""
"3.5 D: Good, but not as impressive as the reputation. In all honesty, this is pretty much average through and through (like 3.0 average), but my love of milk stouts and barrel aging has kicked it to the upper limit of average."
""
"O: This is damn tasty and the ABV makes it dangerously drinkable. I would stock up on this one if it was available to me locally. Highly recommended."
"Overall: Just as advertised. Loads of bourbon and coffee with a lot of booziness. Awesome beer that we all enjoyed."

" thick oozing amount of coffee, sweeter aroma and just one of the fullest smells I have ever come across in my life. Lots of lactose in here as well with hints of sweet roasted coffee just stronger then anything you could possibly imagine. The flavor followed suit perfectly. sweet coco Lots of carbonation here never let go and never had a dull moment to it. you could literally drink this one all night long,"

"FIRST RATING of this one on RB! 22oz bomber, fresh from the brewery, dated 9/2/2010. pours a silky, thick black with a full, two-finger, dark beige head with hints of red around the edges leaving beautiful lacing. aroma is utterly fantastic with big, woody, bourbon notes at the outset that settle beautifully into the background of huge roasted coffee, dark chocolate cake, vanilla, and light coconut with subtle touches of dark fruit and toffee. flavor is spectacular, and i’m a homer so it’s perfect, with an absolutely flawless balance of fresh, roasted coffee, espresso, and dark chocolate mocha with a light, creamy, lacto-sweetness sliding through ahead of smooth oak, vanilla, and spicy bourbon with a long, ashy malt, bitter chocolate, and roasted coffee finish. palate is sublimely full bodied, silky smooth, and damn near milkshake-esque creamy with perfect carbonation and incredible drinkability. overall, without a doubt one of the five best bourbon barrel aged stouts i’ve ever tasted. bravo, geoff. *re-rate* aww, hell this brew is just getting better and better every time i open another bottle. perfect 5 for this VA homer!"
"Part of Thirstybird's pre-trip beer blowout. Pours two shades shy of black with no head, just a thin soapy band around the edges. Nose expresses roast, coffee, a trace of vanilla and a boozy quality. Taste reveals roasted malt, artificial sweetener, coffee grounds and some char towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light in consistency with an even carbonation from start to finish; not mild, but not quite prickly. A decent brew (didn't realize it was a milk stout), but not much of the barrel is present. Overall, I found it fairly tasty, but not something I would seek out again."
"O - Not a bad beer, fairly easy to get down, wouldn't mind it again, and I'm not a milk stout fan."
"Though I initially wrote this off as a pleasant but unremarkable sweet stout, the bourbon qualities of this beer make it more interesting. I'm not sure of this bottle's vintage, but I imagine it could benefit from a touch more aging, though I worry the coffee flavors would fade accordingly. All in all, this is a fairly easy to drink -bal aged stout that I'd be interested in trying again."
"O (D) - this is a great beer."
"Pours a beautiful brown with a nice reddish tint. A touch of light tan head. Very very pretty with a reddish tint. Smells phenomenal. Lots of coffee and a light bourbon hint on the nose. Smells sweet with lots of milk sweetness on the nose. Taste is similar. Coffe, milk, sweet sugary goodness, and bourbon but light and perfect for the base beer. This is a damn near perfect beer"
"Overall impression: incredibly easy to drink. Right on."
"Jet black pour with a solid fingers worth of mocha head. Coffee and bourbon dance across my nose. This beer is sweet and pleasantly so. Coffee and chocolate and of course some bourbon. This beer is very smooth. Everything played very well here. Enjoyable."
"A really nice one. The coffee, bourbon and creamy vanilla are all wonderfully integrated."
"Graciously sent by bobertkuekn. Thanks, Robert! Pours a solid dark black color with no head or lacing. Looks kinda lifeless, but there is some carbonation bubbles popping up along the edges. Fantastic aroma of dark and milk chocolate, lactose, roast and coffee, which is probably slightly mellowed because of the age. Wow, this thing taste amazing! Loaded with rich milk chocolate, lots of sweetness, a touch of lactose twang, molasses, caramel, and loads of coffee which are much more prevelant than what the nose suggested. Not getting a whole lot of bourbon notes, but there is a touch of vanilla toasty nuttiness in the background. Just an all-around, well rounded taste, everything mingles together perfectly. Absolutely tasty! Medium bodied, close to full, light to moderate carbonation. This is an incredibly tasty beer and wish I could many more bottles of this! Thanks again, Robert!"
"O: This one completely blew me away. I figured it would be good but not this good."
"O: Nice beer. Very easy to drink. Felt like the flavor was missing a little """omph""" though. Wouldn't go out of my way again to get it and I think their coffee stout is better. But it's definitely worth trying if you like sweet stouts."
"I was hoping to net one o' these bad boys before leaving NoVa, but the release was painfully delayed just to screw with me (or so the voices tell me...). Thankfully, awesome BAs populate BIFs. This bit o' haul pours a pure obsidian topped by a finger of light sienna foam. The nose comprises oak, whiskey, blackened pretzels, rather light roasted malts, and a layer of char. some chocolate syrup comes in if you inhale deeply enough. The taste also focuses on the whiskey-drenched oak, with some light chocolate syrup, light roasted malts, and very light molasses backing that up. Don't get me wrong: this shit is good. It's just dominated by the barrels. The body is on the heftier side of medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smoothly chewy feel. Overall, a very solid stout, though I think if the stout characteristics were enhanced to further counterbalance the barrels it would truly shine."
"edit memorial day 2012, tried this year's version and was very impressed and would rate this more at a 4.5 across the board. his the spot even on a warm sunny day!"
"overall - this is among the best coffee stouts i've ever had the pleasure to sample."
"Who can say no to a barrel aged imperial vanilla coffee milk stout? I sure can't. And I'm glad I didn't. This beer pours a black liquid into the glass, initially has a sandy froth on the top but that doesn't stay around too long. It smelled darn tasty. From the descriptor above you can assume that there was a distinct coffee and vanilla presence. There wasn't really any milk stout aroma due to the strong aroma of the roasted malts. The simplicity of roast and vanilla together, for some reason is perhaps one of the greatest smells in beerdom to me. The flavors resemble a smooth iced coffee with a distinct oak and vanilla flavor to it. This is coffee with creamer mind you. I felt for the strength of this beer, that the mouthfeel could have been a little thicker, but it wasn't bad in the slightest. My overall opinion of this beer is that if it was thickened up I would never be able to get enough of the beer. As it currently stands, it's not. That doesn't slight this beer in any way. This is a damn tasty brew and should be appreciated by more individuals."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a nice medium size dark brown foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of very nice aromatic coffee notes with some light bourbon notes and light vanilla. Taste is a very smooth mix of bourbon and aromatic coffee with well rounded roasted malt with light vanilla and bourbon finish. Body is quite full with nice creamy texture and some good carbonation. Very well brewed with great balance and easily drinkable while being quite complex at the same time."
"Okay just not a big fan of the coffee flavor and aftertaste. I just wasn't blown away with this beer. A bit sweet, even for the style."
"Pour is pitch black with little hint of any carbonation. Head is a solid 1/2 cm that disappears pretty quickly. Smell is of fresh coffee and vanilla. Pretty tame, but elegant. Vanilla and coffee blend seamlessly together with the roasted malts. Toffee and chocolate combine with the vanilla and coffee and hit your palate with a complex array of flavors that beg you to want more. Slight bitterness toward the finish. This is a sipper that goes down easy. It's not heavy, but packs a ton of flavor into the medium body. Carbonation is moderate to low."
"One of the better coffee beers i've had. there are a handfull over Cafe Royale still, but this one is worth seeking out. I'd gladly drink more of this."
"Pours a dark brown colour with thin bread head. Some mild lacing around the glass. Smells of coffee, vanilla and roasted malt. I only notice a trace of the bourbon in this, but it is there. A really smooth mouthfeel. I don't know if this is an imperial stout or not since the ABV isn't listed, but it doesn't taste boozy. I really enjoyed this."
"Radek's bottle."
"D: a great beer experience all around. ABV not listed on the bottle but this did not strike me as boozy or excessive. Still not a session beer, but a wonderfully drinkable beeer."
"2010 bottle, in the fridge about a year now. Pours a nice deep mahogany brown, light peeks through around the edges and not much head is generated. The thin tan foam quickly subsides, but the beer is definitely still alive. Aromas are of bourbon and wood. Faint coffee wafts underneath the roasted wood and mellow boozy front. Taste is rich and chewy. Good balance with sweet chocolatey malt and a tingling bourbon finish that leaves a nice coating on the tongue. The booziness is well diguised by the rich sweet malt and the finish lingers of ground coffee and a bourbon heat. Best cellarable VA beer I have found."
"bomber from some WF awhile back"
"Drinkability -- This is the second time having this beer, the first being about a month after the release. Wasn't blown away by the coffee flavor then, either. A bit sweet, even for the style, but otherwise it's pretty good. There is enough going on to keep one engaged. I distinctly remember enjoying my first experience with this beer more - bottle variation?"
"I'm getting some syrupy cherry here. But in an coffe rather than a fruit way. A bit sweet? Maybe for some, but it's nice to see coffee flavor without too much of a roasted chocolate flavor. Worth seeking out as a different take from the way others approach the style."
"Very nice mouthfeel. Not too thick with good carbonation level. Great beer from Williamsberg Alewerks."
"Somewhat light bodied and creamy with moderate-low carbonation. Unsure of the abv on this, but it's an easy drinker."
"D - An exquisite offering from the folks at Williamsburg Alewerks, a brewery that continues to impress me... The appearance and aroma are good, but the taste and mouthfeel are wordly... This is also a wonderful example of bourbon barrel aging... I highly recommend and look forward to attempting to grab some more for myself..."
"Didn't know what to expect here but not bad at all."
"D - Easy to drink, but not as good as other beers of this style like KBS. Not a ton of bourbon flavor either."
"A great bourbon beer. This needs more distribution. Another homerun from this up and coming brewery."
"This is a nice stout -- big booze, flavorful roasted malt, sweetness mixed in. I'm all over this."
"D. I shared some of this, but I could have enjoyed the whole bottle. Impressive considering the sweetness. I think it really helps that everything else is so subtle, including the ABV. Just a really nice beer here. This is a big beer that doesn't shun balance."
"Smooth, with a medium viscosity, this beer goes down smoothly without the burn of many other bourbon barrel stouts. Additionally, the ABV is reasonable. I would recommend this beer to anyone, but I would not go into it expecting a super boozy bourbon barreled beer. I also really like the fact that this is still a milk stout, and retains the coffeehouse's sweetness."
"D: Pretty enjoyable imperial stout. Nothing that really wows me about it, but good. Wish I could have picked up a bit more of the oak and whiskey, though."
"D - Very balanced, I'd love to keep drinking this."
"Blackened with a mocha head, appealing but typical of the style. Coffee and creamy sweetness are prominent on the nose. There's a ton of vanilla and brown sugar; it smells very sweet for the relatively low ABV. The coffee character isn't reminiscent of freshly roasted beans like Founders Breakfast Stout, it's more like brewed coffee; perhaps a bit stale smelling in contrast, and somewhat acidic. It's coffee forward on the tongue, but equally sweet and quite creamy. The combination of coffee and milky sweetness makes me think of one of those syrup-laden Starbucks espresso drinks. Bourbon barrel aging has contributed a ton of vanilla, though little oak or heat. It's a mellow beer, very sweet but not particularly heavy. The finish is mild, creamy, and never quite dries up. This is solid, but nothing special."
"This is a very tasty and clearly well-made beer. The bourbon is well-integrated and the flavors mesh well. I'd be happy to drink this anytime. Good job, Alewerks. Recommended."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and carbonation is on the lower end. Drinkability is good, it had some very nice coffee, bourbon and vanilla flavors to it. Everything really came together very nicely in it. I'm really looking forward to see how this develops in the future. Another very good barrel aged beer from Williamsburg that I enjoyed greatly."
"D: A bit bourbon heavy, but good."
"I wouldn't have believed it, but this is a routinely good barrel aged big coffee stout. I had no idea that this being existed in the wild. Very good beer."
"The similarity to the Eclipse continues on the palate. Initially a little sweet, more vanilla, honey and brown sugar than the caramel that the Eclipse. The similarity ends here, as the coffee dominates, rich, fruity, and quite espresso-like. Chocolate and cocoa are present as well, working quite well with the vanilla and bourbon. Not really tannic, this beer finishes a little sweet with vanilla and caramel. Unfortunately, this is just a little bit watery on the finish, but the flavors are quite excellent. Medium-light in body with moderate-low carbonation, this beer is quite excellent. Recommended."
"Highly recommended."
"Pours a rich deep dark near black with thin cap of mocha head leaving great lacing. Scent is of dark roasted espresso with faint hints of chocolate and alcohol. Taste brings aggressive dark roast espresso without much bitterness, background notes of sweet cream, chocolate and fainter notes of alcohol and oak. Full bodied, creamy and silky smooth, slightly coating, excellent level of carbonation. A fantastic tasting brew, although its not overly complex and the bourbon barrel aging doesn't add as much as in other brews, it is one of the better coffee tasting beers out there."
"Thanks to Shane (injuredreserve) for graciously sharing with me!"
"D - Probably nice with chocolate cake. I'd like about 8oz in a sitting but it's great for sharing. Although I didn't get much barrel I still enjoyed it and will seek more sometime soon."
"overall a good local seasonal that I'll pick up again."
"Lots of bitterness from the coffee and the forward sweetness from the bourbon. Eh, as far as bourbon barrel beers go its kind of mediocre. Otherwise its a decent beer."
"D: This was a very nice stout that integrated the coffee with the bourbon and oak flavors nicely. It was bold and complex with nice body and a clean taste. It was a little hot fresh, so it was better to sip. But age could help mellow this out. Reminiscent of KBS - I'd love to try them side by side, along with the WA Bourbon Barrel Porter. (The Porter may be my favorite of the group!)"
"M: A really good brew and shows that Williamsburg AleWerks can put out the big brews with the best of them. Their everyday beers need the same kind of attention to push them up a level or two but this brew and Grand Illumination Barleywine are both excellent examples of their respective styles and well worth finding and giving a try. I really enjoyed this brew -- a slight break on the price tag would be nice for a local brew, but all in all this is really a nice beer that approaches Blue Mountain's Dark Hollow for a quality imperial stout. A little more roast edge, and this would compete with KBS."
"Pour brings a near-black liquid with a thin mocha head that has some pretty good staying power. This is definitely a coffee bomb--the nose really loads in some nice, fresh coffee that is fairly dark and roasty. The taste scales the coffee down a tad bit in exchange for some dry roast and hints of chocolate. Feel is quite nice. This is somewhat thick but dry and roasty. Finishes well. I haven't had that many beers from Williamsburg at this point, although the ones I have tried have been quite good."
"Overall, a pretty solid coffee stout. The coffee is fresh and the bourbon shows enough but doesn't overpower the beer. It is pretty drinkable as well. This was a fun one to drink and I would recommend it."
"Bottle. Courtesy of Dregs78 from BA. Pours a very dark brown color with a semi-dark tan head that collars around the glass. The aroma is dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, leather, and slight bourbon notes. The booze notes that I do pick up I think can be contributed to the aging in barrels. Some lace as the head settles. Nice creamy mouthfeel. The bourbon flavor is fairly evident but not overwhelming at all. Nice blend of flavors. The dark chocolate is mor evident at the end and lingers on for a while. Slgith warming and taste of alcohol as well. Overall, a really nice beer with some pretty good balance. I really like the bourbon flavors in that they aren't too overwhelming. The mouthfeel is really nice as well."
"Great brew! Worth picking up if you see it on the shelves in VA or MD. For me, I'd be hard pressed to describe why I'd spend 2.5 times more for the beloved BCBCS when this is just as tasty and much more drinkable (as a milk stout should be). Seriously."
"Drinkability is good. A lot of flavor, not much of an alcohol blast and very smooth. I would drink this again. This is not Ten Fidy or The Abyss, but it goes down a lot easier than these beers. There are times when I want a less intense but still flavorful stout. This would do it."
"D: pretty good for dessert. If it was any warmer outside, I would not be drinking a pint. I think a touch less sweetness would go a long ways here. Still an excellent boubon barrel aged coffee stout."
"Although fleeting in feel for a stout, Cafe Royale was remarkably delicious, with more unique flavor notes than I've tasted in any beer of any kind. Each flavor stood on its own and stood out at distinct moments. It was an outstanding experience."
"d - Overall this was a good stout. I thought it smelt great; lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla, and chocolate. The only thing that brought this down for me was the taste. While I enjoyed it, I thought it was a bit too sweet. Luckily I split it with a buddy because I don't know if I could drink a full 22 oz. bottle by myself because of the sweetness. Either way I'm glad I tried it and would try it again."
"D: Kevin at Grape & Gourmet was raving about this beer, but it didn't really wow me. It's a very solid impy that occasionally comes close to approaching greatness, but it doesn't really justify the mini-hype it's been receiving. It's worth picking up if you can find a bottle, but it won't redefine your view of stouts or anything."
"Drinkability: A good beer, but not a great beer. Glad to see Williamsburg continuing to branch out in to this type of thing (I loved the bourbon barrel porter, and think that this is actually a slight though not enormous step down), and I hope they continue to do so. Let this one sit in the barrels for about twice as long, or simply add a little less extra fermentable material next time, as I'd rather have a dryer beer with more bourbon punch than a beer that sacrifices balance for the sake of covering up what to some may be a potentially desirable note (though I do agree that spirit balance is also key). Perhaps the second cut of the barrels will leech a little less whiskey/bourbon in to the mix and that leeway can be afforded more easily. Regardless, an excellent beer, and one I'd gladly try again."
"I was very excited to try this new offering, so despite the warm sunny afternoon I forge ahead with opening a bottle. From my experience with the BB Porter, I'm expecting a smooth, """sessionable""" barrel aged stout and this delivers on that. Pours a thick, sludgy milk chocolate color with a dense, thick coffee colored head that fades to a thin cap and leaves surprising amounts of wet, sticky lacing. The aroma and mouthfeel are the highlights for me. The aroma immediately brings (a slightly lesser) KBS to mind, with a strong bourbon and vanilla presence balancing chocolate, molasses, and coffee. Mouthfeel is extremely thick and viscous, syrupy on the palate with a watery finish. The flavor is dominated by an initial lactic sweetness from the base beer and finishes with a strong oaky and vanilla sweetness. Overall, very balanced, but there is much less bourbon or coffee flavor as the nose suggests. Not quite as complex or interesting as KBS, but also much easier drinking and nearly the same price for a 22 oz bottle instead of a 12. A very exciting new beer from Williamsburg Alewerks, pick some up when you see it, but probably not worth hunting down (particularly if you're looking for a strong bourbon or coffee fix)"
"You know right away what this beer aims to be, but with this style represented so well by other breweries, it falls a bit short. Still a nice beer."
