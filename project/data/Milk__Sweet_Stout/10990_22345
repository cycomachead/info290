Ok the last part is a stretch, but truthfully this is a pretty weak offering as a milk stout.  Very little sweetness, cream, cocoa, or coffee.  Very thin feel and no alcohol to boot.  Another disappointment from Lazy Magnolia.","Foxybrau","Mar 13, 2015"

Aromas of cream, chocolate, coffee, and earthy notes, all leaning towards the rich and sweet side. Flavors are bittersweet forward, with hints of smoke, all on a richly sweet backbone. Notes of sweet potato, baker's chocolate, cream, and coffee all blend together to provide a balanced palate. Light bodied, with a slightly sharp undertone throughout. The aftertaste is more on the bitter and roasted side, with a bittersweet linger into the smooth, clean finish. Interesting brew, and an easy drinker. Tasty, and very unique.","GarthDanielson","Jan 18, 2014"

The aroma is sweet, roasty, and ever so slightly earthy. The taste is pretty standard, sadly, there are not yams everywhere. They might attribute a slight bit of earthiness that could also be attributed to hops. There's a bit of stale coffee in the middle to go with some sweet and roasted malts. The mouthfeel is light and creamy, and the drinkability is solid. Overall, Jeff Stout is a pretty decent sweet stout. Not my favorite, but tasty enough. Should appeal to Guinness drinkers.","shand","Mar 11, 2013"

3.62,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served from growler into a sampler shaker. Poured a massively dark brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lactose, roasted malt, earth, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, cream, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall was a pretty decent brew. This one had a pretty good nose going on with it with a nice touch of lactose that you would expect and a nice roastiness as well. The flavor however was much more roasty than I prefer for my Milk Stouts. The sweet malt and cream aspect couldn’t shake a stick at all the earth, dark chocolate, and roastiness. Worth trying to say that you have, but I wouldn’t put it high on my list of the style.","thagr81us","Nov 15, 2012"

3.85,6.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer appears opaque black with a very thin tan head. The aroma is mostly of roasted malt and chocolate. I also did not pick up the sweet potatoes in the aroma or flavor, but they did contribute to the mouthfeel. The flavor is on the milder side of sweet with some nice malt backbone. I detected the chocolate notes. The mouthfeel is creamy for this medium bodied, moderately carbonated beer. This was enjoyable to drink and it's a solid beer from the guys at Lazy Magnolia.","acevenom","Nov 11, 2012"

The sweetness doesn't really seem out of place for the style either. I liked the candied sweet potato aspect of it. At under 5% abv I wasn't expecting a big bold stout, and I didn't get one.

3.56,-1.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Served in a tulip nonic. Pours an inky black with a creamy, two inch, tan-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch skim. Thick, textured bands of lacing are revealed during the session. Nose reveals espresso roast, lactose and peanut butter (?). There is also a suggestion of cocoa and something metallic. Taste expresses char and cocoa. The metallic quality in the nose is also present in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a light acidity. I don't see a lot of milk stouts being produced, so I'm grateful for the opportunity to try them when they present. That said, I found this one decent, but somewhat lacking in the traditional lactose sweetness I've come to associate with the style. That, as well as the metallic notes, detract from this beer.","Jwale73","Mar 19, 2012"

3.84,6.4,4.5,3,4,4.5,4,"The comments from others are spot on, for me. Clean, simple, and perhaps lacking in presence. Sometimes, when I grab a stout I do want a deeper flavor profile. On the other hand, there are times that this one would be just right. The ABV% is good enough to get that relaxed feeling.plus absolutely no hint of the taste of alcohol. The texture sets a good background for eating cuisine that already has bold flavors, such as that local nola eatery. And, my memory is that there is a nice finish to this beer. A safe and secure beer that has its place. Having said that, I do wish that they would experiment to let one note stand out, while still maintaining a good balance. Nothing provocative but something slightly more distinguished would be in order. If this is a beer in progress I sure hope that it makes its way to Kentucky in bottles or tap. I would definitely keep it in stock.","calluci","Nov 21, 2011"
3.53,-2.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A very gentle stout, even for a milk stout. Pours pitch black with a slight head. Smells very lightly roasty, a touch watery, and milky.

I think it would be a great seller for Lazy Mag and it is very accessible for noobs IMO. I won't belittle it by calling it a gateway stout, its just a great beer.
