It's a bit sweet for me and the oddly roasted quality at the finish doesn't seem to fit, though it helps to balance the beer at least.

Anyway, yes--I thought the label (which is gorgeously retro) and the name were a joke, but no, it really does taste and smell like Neapolitan. It has a chocolatey-strawberryy taste and a feel in the mouth of dairy/vanilla, and it is fun, really fun to drink. I don't think I've ever had a Milk Stout before, and I suppose I expected something stronger and heavier, but this was fine and I would certainly drink it again.","gollem","Jan 09, 2015"

Aroma fits the spirit of the beer perfectly although the stawberry is a little on the artificial side.  Tastes of a wonderful mixture of chocolate,  vanilla,  and strawberry.   Again the stawberry reminded me of freeze dried stawberry ice cream instead of fresh strawberries but i think this plays into the neapolitan theme.   Wonderful beer that lives up to its name.","daddycard","Dec 24, 2014"

Aroma is indeed as advertised, milk chocolate, vanilla, red berries, and caramel with a whiff of ash. The sweet cream and berry notes become more prominent as one sips, although the opposite is true on the palate, with the chocolate and roasted barley notes increasing in salience. This crossover effect between nose and palate added to the experience to me ... Perhaps the strawberry is overdone, although the sweet cream, vanilla, coffee, and caramel elements gave me something else on which to focus and there was a robust charred barley note poking out that prevented things from becoming too sweet. I am reminded of dehydrated astronaut ice cream rather than the stuff in the big yellow bucket. Wonderful mouthfeel, silky smooth and rich but not overly thick. Finishes with faint grassy hops and light ash. Quite tasty all told, with some childhood nostalgia thrown in for good measure.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 01, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big fresh strawberry, milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, vanilla, cream, light floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast malt, strawberry, and cream notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, strawberry, vanilla, cream, light floral, and roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, strawberry, vanilla, cream, light floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/roast malt, strawberry, and cream flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy, smooth, and slightly slick/chalky moutfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent milk stout! All around great balance and complexity of dark/roast malt, strawberry, and cream flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 20, 2014"

Mainly cocoa and dark malts in the aroma, light notes of berry-like sweetness. In the taste, again dark malts and cocoa were dominant, moderately roasty with a bitter twinge, lactose sweetness, but nothing that really came out as ""vanilla," and a artificial strawberry syrup sensation in the background. Medium body, a little wacky/novelty-ish in the flavor department, but I guess it was enjoyable enough to be drinkable. It probably would have been a fine sweet stout without the strawberry flavoring.","Rifugium","Jan 22, 2014"

The nose comprises dark chocolate powder, mild (and slightly artificial) strawberry, very light coffee, and light vanilla bean. Well, dammit, it smells like Neapolitan ice cream. Nice. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger contingent of strawberry and a light addition of roasted malts. Things aren't as close to the namesake ice cream as before, but it ain't too far therefrom, either. The body is a lithe medium, with a pleasant nitrogenation and a consequently silky-smooth feel. Overall, it's rare when a beer both delivers on a seemingly pie-in-the-sky promise and also doesn't end up tasting somehow worse than expected. This one does both, and I feel I'm better for it today.

This beer has good drinkability for what it is and I would drink another if I had one, it wend down smoothly and it also makes for a perfect dessert beer. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, this beer is pretty much exactly what it says it is and that's how an experimental beer should be, it also look and felt really good. The only thing I would change would be to add a little more strawberry flavor but it does show up a little more when it warms up so it's nothing to complain about. I will for sure buy this beer again and will be going back for some more. I highly recommend this beer if these kinds of experimental beers are your thing, it really does taste like the ice cream. I am really glad that Saugatuck decided to bottle this beer, when I had it at the beer expo I was told it was draft only so I was really surprised and happy to see this beer at the store. I did think the daft version was just a little better, the flavors seemed to pop a little more. This is my favorite beer from Saugatuck and is up there as one of my favorite experimental beers. Saugatuck really did a great job at making this taste like the ice cream while still keeping it drinkable and not to overdone, this shows that you guys have some serious talent when it comes to experimental beers and I would like to see what other crazy beers you guys can make, good job.","StoutHunter","Dec 14, 2011"
