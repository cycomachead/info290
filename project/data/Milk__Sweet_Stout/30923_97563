I eat peanut butter with a spoon straight from the jar so this is a real treat combining two of my favorite foods. I highly recommend trying this if you like peanut butter.

4.26,2.4,3.75,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"22 oz bottle. Pours a black color with a small layer of brown head. Fantastic and unique aroma. Lots of lacing. Chocolate milk, peanuts, cocoa, caramel, honey, coffee and roasted malts. The taste is somewhat reminiscent of Reese's Pieces. Peanut butter, dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and sweet lactose. Finishes with more chocolate milk and peanut butter. Not overly sweet. Lightly carbonated with a light mouthfeel. Somehow this beer works very well.

4.12,-1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Got in a trade with RaulMondesi. 22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours clear very dark brown/black color with a 2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge milk chocolate, cocoa, peanut butter, vanilla, caramel, toast, light coffee, cream, and roasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and peanut butter notes; with great strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, peanut butter, light coffee, cream, and roasted earthiness. Light roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, vanilla, peanut butter, light coffee, and cream on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and peanut butter flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Peanut butter flavor is not as big as I expected given the aromas, but still has good presence. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 5.3%. Overall this is an excellent peanut butter milk stout. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and peanut butter flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 30, 2015"

4.31,3.6,3.25,4.75,4.25,3.75,4.5,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into 16 oz snifter. A: nice dark cola-like color with about an inch of tan head that disappears rather quickly with almost no lacing afterward. S: probably the best part of the beer in my opinion, deep chocolate and toasty goodness, almost reminds me of my sister's coffee drinks, alcohol is hidden very well in this one; my only complaint is the peanut butter is almost at the back end of the smell, you kind of have to search for it. T: very good flavor on this, peanut butter flavor is kind of masked on the flavor as well, hop bitters on the front of the tongue do this beer very well and with a sweet finish, it tastes very well balanced, I could definitely drink multiple beers without getting tired of this! M: feels nice and thin, but not watery, a very nice feel, even for a stout. Overall I would say this is an exceptional stout, I would definitely buy this again, maybe multiple bottles at a time.","Mrchato","Dec 22, 2014"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, milk chocolate, and peanut butter aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder and chocolate covered peanut butter cup candy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

4.19,0.7,4,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Eventually there is a little nutty taste slipping into the sweet burnt sugar malt flavors. Quite an interesting brew-- you just need to be in the mood. Really smooth and sweet without being sugary. An undertone of bitterness keeps it from cloying, but without raising much attention to the subtle hops. One of the best flavored stouts I've had, and without a doubt the best Milk Stout. But crazy.","mactrail","Aug 19, 2013"
