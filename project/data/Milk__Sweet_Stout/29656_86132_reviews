"Surprisingly amazing!  At least five words. :-)"
"Lovely sampling from a local brewery. I strongly prefer stouts, and this is by far one of my favourites."
""
"Pours with a cola colored body and settles into the glass as very dark brown with a sticky cream-colored head. Aroma is vanilla right off the bat, with roasted malts and chocolate. Flavor is sweet with lots of vanilla and a nice roastiness to balance out the sweetness. Mouthfeel is very creamy with medium carbonation and a medium body for a higher abv milk stout. Overall a great and unique take on the style, not too sweet, very nice."
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding body.  Great aroma with a chocolate finish that is not too strong."
"Rather sweet, good bit of semi artificial vanilla, chocolate and dark fruits."
"good beer but somewhat sweet.  i do like the high abv."

"On draft in a tulip glass in Dallas at Blind Butcher.  Tartar and jalape√±o sausage. Get some."
""
""
""
"O:  Like drinking a fizzy, chocolate-covered berry."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a stout that I have failed to find anyone to dislike, even if they are the light lager types.  That doesn't mean they can drink 2 of them, but everyone agrees the flavor is like a chocolate bar made love to a coffee bean then their child grew up to make love to a world class stout and now we have this.  $11 for a 4-pack hurts, but it's really priced fairly."

"As advertised, The Temptress has some nice lactose and vanilla notes going on. I found the bitterness somewhat distracting and it was a bit thin for my tastes but that is not to say that this is bad at all."
""
"This is a really great milk stout and I'm not what you call a milk stout fan. I tried this beer on a recommendation from a friend. I had this beer for the first time at Meddlesome Moth in Dallas. Nitro is definitely the way to go with this stout."
"O: This is a great milk stout! So glad to have it readily available on the shelves in my hometown."

"Silky feel. Chocolate and caramel taste. Great beer."
"best milk stout ive ever had"
"This beer is incredible on Nitro"
""

"Dark, chocolate, smooth.  Amazing on nitro.  Nice head and mouth feel."

"She's bold. She's extra sweet. She'll fill you up and leave you with a headache in the morning."

"D/O- I really enjoyed this one. The highlight for me was the creamy mouthfeel...that's how all stouts oughta be.Thanks kojevergas!"

"This is one of the creamiest milk stouts I've ever had. It was very good, almost tasted like whoppers, or a malted milk shake."

"Rich flavor and very delicious"
""
"t/m/o - really comes alive in your mouth.  Roasted milk chocolate with a hint of burnt. Really well done.  Super tarty, big bold flavor, full bodied and chewy, but super easy to drink.  Really enjoyed this one."

"Overall, it's a good beer, but it's certainly not the best milk stout I've had. I still rank Beachwood's Udder Love and Left Hand's Nitro the two best that I've had. Still, a decent beer. Cheers!"

"Poured into an Imperial pint glass. The look is absolute black with a frothy tan head that settles into thick cream and stubborn lacing. The smell is chocolate and citrus. The taste is a wallop of chocolate up front, then recedes into a woody, dry finish. Very nice indeed. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Overall, I really like this beer. It has a great, deep flavor without being as acidic as some beers malted this darkly can be. It hides the alcohol well and promises a great time. Besides, who can't love a beer that says right on the bottle that it pairs well with sin?"

"Overall, this is a very good beer but just missing on some parts for me. The finish is a little to dry and missing some of the creaminess i was hoping for. I'd like a bottle date as well. You don't see Imperial Milk Stouts all the time and this is a good representation. I enjoyed it."
""
""
"O - This is the first imperial milk stout I've ever had, and it's inspiring me to look for more. I love how it's sweet but not overly syrupy and has enough bitter zing to finish cleanly."
""
"O: Yum. A great contrast of very sweet chocolate and vanilla and then the crisp, bitter burnt toast flavors in the finish. Great milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium mouthfeel. Medium carb."
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not one for the milk stouts, but this is very pleasant. I love the relaxing flavor and the creamy mouth feel. This beer definitely deserves its rating. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was surprised by this one. Very well done."
"Mouthfeel is oily smooth with creamy carbonation. Great with dark chocolate (coffee beans with this tasting). This is the type of imperial (milk) stout i like. Im only surprised i didnt seek it out earlier, especially given i reside in the town in which the brewery is based."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A delicious beer, though the finish is not quite there."
"O- nice beer to start the night out while visiting my Son in Texas. Thought I would try a few beers from the state while I am here"

"O: As this got to proper serving temperature this one shined much more. Big, milk chocolate with some caramel flavors and a nice aftertaste."
""
""
"O-very tasty, nice to sip and enjoy"
"This beer has some wonderfully sweet characteristics, but the booze is a little out of place and I feel like the char hits the palate too hard. It just distracts from the marshmallow-y, vanilla goodness that I do not want to go away. The lacto also makes for a really nice feel on the tongue. I would love to put some age on this beer and see what happens."
""
""
""
"Lots of milk chocolate up front. Quite sweet. Lots of cocoa which lasts through the aftertaste. Rich body, more than the Irish dry stouts. Low carbonation. This could be be chocolate porter as there are no burnt elements. Still, it's a wonderfully flavorful beer to seek out."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great example of a milk stout. It avoids the one dimensional, sweet aspect of many milk stouts, and is really something I could see myself drinking on a regular basis."
""
""
"Overall- very good beer, but I do prefer it on nitro compared to the bottle. Definitely a great cold weather beer to sit and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Summary - Super good. One of the better Texas offerings I've had. This is a fantastic milk stout. Highly recommended."

"Pours a dark black with amber edges in the light, thin mocha head that disappears quick and leaves minimal lacing as the glass goes down. Smells of mild alcohol, a little coffee and cream with a touch of caramel, very nice. Taste is of roasted malts, sugar, vanilla, and some caramel but with all that said its not overly sweet at all. Not too thick not too thin, good carb. Overall an outstanding beer, and one I'm very happy to see coming out of Texas, especially the style due to the lack of here. $9.99/4 packs make this beer quite a deal. Well done Lakewood."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not a fan of milk stouts in general but this one is by far the most enjoyable one I've had yet. Still will not go out of my way to purchase this style but I could drink The Temptress every once in a while if it were available to me."
"O - Too much roasted malts in this for my liking, but a very well balanced beer. I would love to be able to try a bourbon barrel aged or coffee version, as I think it would balance the malt bill and compliment the flavors very well."
""
""
""
""
"I wasn't sure what to expect here but the combination of Imperial and Milk Stout suggested a beer that just couldn't miss. Although this doesn't blow me away, its certainly a worthwhile offering. Try it!"
""
""
"I understand that a Milk/Sweet Stout is supposed to be sweet. But this is a bit much. It's literally more sugary than a glass of chocolate milk. There is some nice depth to the malts, and some roast, but overall this is not exactly what I'm looking for in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark black color with a light tan head. The aroma is sweet dark roasted malts, cocoa, and a touch of smoke. The taste like the aroma starts out with sweet dark roasted malts with a lingering sweet and roasty notes in the finish. The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied. Overall, this is a solid milk stout that is worth a try for anyone who enjoys the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very sold milk stout, I could easily have another."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is good. Dark hue, nice bubbly head, and very little lacing. Nose is simple and subtle combination of coffee malt, peat, and some sweet tones. Syrupy roasted malt flavor, pungent peatiness, and some sweetness for balance right in the middle. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"O - This is an extremely solid milk stout. The lactose is light and subtle which I really prefer. This does have a really nice balance between the char and the sweetness with just enough vanilla. Well played TX, well played!"
"O: A solid brew and a nice milk stout. There's a really nice silky sweet chocolate milk quality to this beer. There's a hint of sour lacto that can at time be a bit surprising on the nose but works very well with the taste."

"O - Very drinkable despite the 9.1% ABV. This is a great Milk Stout for such a new brewery. Love to see a Texas brewery making stouts!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an enjoyable imperial Milk Stout. I am enjoying sipping on this, though the tinny flavor is a bit off putting for me. Maybe just variation from bottle to bottle? Something worth a try, and I will be sure to finish the four pack without a problem."
""
"Very well done, tasty milk stout. Drinkable, no real booziness."
""
""
""

"This is an interesting one. I am having a tough time (albeit an enjoyable one) picking out the individual characteristics of the smell and taste of this brew. However, there is one thing that stands out: it is excellent. I just don't know why...and it's not just the gratuitous ABV. The feel of this drink is so smooth and creamy, it's rather incredible. The taste is excellent: maybe that is a roasted, chocolate flavor; I just can't tell. The key thing is that whatever components are in this, it makes an all-around, well-mixed, overly-enjoyable brew. This is now my favorite milk stout. I will get this again...as soon as a friend from Dallas brings it to me once more."
""
""
"Stouts not being my bag, I still can recognize the greatness in this beer. LOTS of alcohol, though, so for me, it may always be a 1- or 2-beer session at most ... something to savor from time to time, not to throw down at a BBQ."
"Entirely too sweet overall. Dial back the lactose a touch and it would be a solid milk stout, very solid."

"O: Overall a great Imperial Milk Stout. While I cant say I have had many I have had my fair share of stouts and this one is very drinkable. I would definitely pick this up if it were available in Jersey. I can see me drinking this for desert even in the warmer weather. Cheers!"
""
"Love this."

"O - Other than the disappointing lack of nose, and the slightly contrary flavors, this beer is pretty great. It could use a little balance, and I sure wish I could smell this thing, but all around it delivers some complexity, some body, and for the price it does it's job well"
""
""
""
"D/O - very drinkable. This is an outstanding offering from a young brewery. The barrel aged version of this is definitely better (seriously, beergasm), but the regular version is still excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste starts with chocolate and mild roast, followed up with a surprising amount of grassy hop. The finish is long and dusty with the alcohol finally making its presence known. The mouthfeel is very nice, the beer is perfectly carbonated and the body is silky smooth. It is not as heavy and sweet as I thought from the aroma, but it is more than enough to compliment a 8.5% ABV. This is quite a tasty treat, I am looking forward to getting some more of this on my next trip up to the metroplex!"
""
""
""

"Not the actual Temptress, but the Bourbon barrel Temptress. Had a glass at the brewery on 12/22/2012. This was a wonderful stout. Must admit that the entire tasting experience was very nice, but the Temptress, either aged in a bourbon barrel, or not, was wonderful."
""
"While this effort by the fledgling Lakewood Brewing Co. in Garland is not the best Imperial Russian Stout I have had it certainly is distinct and holds it's own against the top US brews in this style I have tried and rate highly. (North Coast Brewery, Fort Bragg, CA, etc.)"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very impressive imperial stout that brings a rich chocolate flavor with a coffee twist"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a nitro-induced tan head. The aroma is full of chocolate and coffee notes, as expected. The flavor features a lot of chocolate and some light smoke, as well as a ton of roasted malt notes. Slick mouthfeel and low carbonation."
