3.53,-4.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark brown color with an off white head.  Aroma of spices and roasted malt.  The flavor is a mix of roasted malt with a coffee like essence and a bit of ginger and cinnamon.  Clove and spices round out the aroma.  The taste is roasted with a yam like vegetable flavor but ample roast as it warms. Vanilla and cinnamon, roasted malt, slight bitterness.  Full bodied and smooth.  Pretty decent.","Stinkypuss","Mar 27, 2015"

Overall this is pretty solid for those who like ginger -relatively clean but somewhat thin in the realms of stouts. I like the way the ginger and dark malt are utilized -a pretty decent base stout that has a medium sweet quality. I would be open to having this again. I consider this a good winter warmer type ale","Slatetank","Jan 06, 2015"

4.38,18.4,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Pours black as a starless night.  World Class head, lacing and retention - especially for a 9% ABV.  As advertised, the nose is full of ginger, clove, nutmeg and cinnamon in roughly that order of composition.  Slightly above medium in body, the texture is slick with hints of creaminess.  Above average carbonation, with effervescence throughout.  The outstanding flavor profile is intense, quite complex and has a good bit of balance.  It begins with a burst of blended spice that flows into a mild bitterness.  The bitterness has roast and hop characteristics.  As the bitterness fades, the spices begin to separate against a sweet caramel background. As it warms, the caramel gains in intensity.  Clove and nutmeg dominate the end, but a light dark fruit (plum/raisin) is underneath.  The finish is quite complex as it fades - so many flavors become evident.  The 9% alcohol is masterfully hidden.  The only traces of it are that nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat.  If you want to taste the alcohol, you have to sip the massive head.  The only "fault" keeping this from a 4.5 World Class, is their decision to classify this as a stout.  There just isn't enough roast character.  Had they called it a porter, they would get a 4.5 from me.  This one is a true masterpiece of the brewer's art.","tillmac62","Nov 21, 2014"

Aroma of sweet dark malt, slightly toasty and gingerbread, as advertised. Flavor is sweet dark malt, hints of lactose, gingerbread, cinnamon and a light hop finish, which actually gives the impression of the spicier types of gingerbread with bite. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I waited to drink this because it seemed a little gimmicky, but I have to say they pulled it off. Nice sweet malt body supports the gingerbread spicing which is well done. The alcohol is well covered. Much better than I expected and a very nice winter stout.

The smell of the beer was very malty and had aromas of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. The smell wasn't particularly like gingerbread, but the taste was a little closer. The ginger was heavier in the taste, and the malt was most like brown sugar. There were also flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg in the taste, making it more complex. than the cookies. The wheat in the malt was also evident in the bock like bready flavor. The label mentions cloves, but those were not easily detectable for me under the other spices. The mouthfeel was a lot thinner than most stouts, and the finish had some lingering spice. This beer was nice winter seasonal.","rajendra82","Jan 05, 2014"

If they tone down the sugariness (is that a word?) of this brew, I can see it being one of my seasonal "must-haves". Until then, however, one bottle of Merry Maker has been more than enough to last me a lifetime.","ThePaintedGrey","Dec 31, 2013"

Undeniable sweet gingerbread aroma is immediately noticeable along with cinnamon, clove and spice. Sugar and spice aromas tend to overwhelm the roasted malt aromas, but they are there in the background. Medium bodied with a slightly thick, creamy smooth feel and light subdued carbonation at the back end. Sweet gingerbread and cinnamon flavors up front, spicy hop flavors through the middle followed by dark roasted malt flavors to the end. Finishes with a spicy hop bite followed by lingering roasted malt aftertaste. You pretty much get what the label says you’re gonna get, gingerbread and spice.

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark khaki with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, gingerbread, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, molasses, toffee, floral, and light roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of spices and dark malt notes. Taste of dark chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, gingerbread, toast, clove, dark bread, molasses, floral, and light roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, toffee, roasted malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, dark bread, toast, clove, molasses, and light roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance of roasted malt flavors with spices with good complexity; with a nice malt/spice balance; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent spiced imperial stout! Great balance of dark malt and spice flavors with good complexity; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Mar 18, 2013"

Molasses is prominent, with ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon in tow. A touch of roast hangs in the background. On the palate, syrupy molasses coats the tongue with spices quickly overwhelming the palate. Nutmeg and ginger stand out most with some cinnamon in the background. Some very mild roast comes through as this warms. Overly sweet, cloyingly so, with the molasses just pummeling the taste buds; everything is secondary. A touch of English bittering hops in the finish. Syrupy body, with some robust flavors, but this was off-putting for me. I couldn't handle the whole bottle myself. The gingerbread flavors are all there, heavy on the molasses though, so it definitely hits the style points, but this didn't quite jive with my palate.","ColForbinBC","Dec 28, 2012"

The alcohol was hidden very well, it's hard to believe this is 9%. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good and it had some gingerbread like quality's to it. What I liked the least about this beer was how unbalanced it was, if this beer had more balance it would be pretty damn good. I would buy a bottle of this if it's released next year, but I don't think I will be going back to get another bottle for this season, the price was good and I recommend this to just about anyone.

3.91,5.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours proper stouty black, with a nice big tan head on it. The bubbles are tight and creamy, but the body is pitch black and opaque, but looked relatively clear as it went into the glass. The lacing on my glass is really quite droopy and thin, leaving little dots across the glass. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and spicy with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and a touch of ginger, which really isn’t surprising seeing as how those are the spices that were used in the beer. The cinnamon is the strongest in smell as far as the spices go, but below the spices sits a strong helping of roasted malts and a touch of black coffee, which is really quite inviting. Hot alcohol is also present and accentuated with the spices, though that isn’t really a bad thing. The slurry of all of these smells helps to suggest slight dark fruit notes in the beer, as well. The beer tastes terrifically bizarre and spicy. The beer begins with roast mingling with dark raisin notes, these flavors continue (especially the roast) but the rest of the beer opens into ginger bread hints that quickly build and climax in the middle of the taste, before petering out into a stale cinnamon flavor. The aftertaste is of watered down spices, and comes far too quickly, making me wish the gingerbread flavors would stay for awhile. On the mouthfeel, the beer is creamy and smooth. The body is medium, with hints of being both lighter and thicker, and after the beer passes, the mouth is left slightly dry with pooling spittle just barely ebbing over the tongue. Overall this is a great holiday beer with a nice gimmicky flavor. I do wish the gingerbread flavor would stick around longer, but I get the feeling that would be very difficult to brew in a balanced way. A solid holiday brew from Sam Adams, and definitely worthy of a taste, or a Christmas tasting.","Maxwell","Dec 19, 2012"

4.03,8.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a very thick, dark brown coloring that borders on black, with an opaque character that is devoid of highlighting colors. A small, low profile head of dark tan rests on top, but quickly settles into a sparse, filmy coating as the beer sits for a bit. Good looking beer. Aromas of sweet gingerbread, roasted and baked dough, a spice profile rich in ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg, some banana sweetness, and a touch of booze, as well. Smells like a rich, warming brew. Flavors are round and robust in mouth, and gingerbread is in the forefront. Nutmeg and ginger quickly coat the taste buds, with an underlying boozey backbone that flows over and then whisks the palate clean. Molasses sweet in the background, with a hint of roasted coffee, as well, but both are subtle and supporting. The beer is smooth and light in mouth, but the flavor profile packs a wallop on your sense of taste. A very fulfilling and grandoise brew. The aftertaste is very mild compared to what has been experienced thus far, with a touch of ginger, buttery bread, and a hint of sugary sweet all blending together. The finish is clean and smooth, and the higher ABV helps to once again clean everything up. Very strong stout, both in flavor and substance. Very tasty, and a great wintertime imbibe. Good beer.","GarthDanielson","Dec 14, 2012"

The gingerbread flavor is spot on and has a creamy aftertaste not unlike icing. The high abv is noticeable but doesn't effect the flavor. This is a really wunique, well-balanced Christmas brew. This beer, after a while it develops an unpleasant aftertaste. Whether it's due to warming or my palate being exhausted by all the spice, I don't know, but I think this one would be better shared among a few friends.","keeganfrank","Nov 29, 2012"

The head retreats slowly, leaving a little bit atop the beer and a circular ring of lace. I detect some of those spice aromas of ginger, clove, and nutmeg. I get some of those dark roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee as well. The taste follows the nose, but I definitely do get those milk stout notes with the chocolate, mild coffee, and dark roasted malt notes. The ginger is pretty forward and I do get some of those other spices. It definitely does taste sweet, which lends itself more to sipping. That's not a bad idea with the 9% ABV. The body is medium with a smooth mouthfeel. This is a sipper. This is a very good beer. It doesn't quite measure up to some of the other beers in this series.","acevenom","Nov 27, 2012"

Not just what I've mentioned earlier, but the fact that the huge spice flavour is heavily reminiscent of a circa 2006 Old Fezziwig. I've always loved this offering, but I feel it's lost something over the years. This effort is bringing it back.

The head is dark khaki and rather thick but it will fall eventually while leaving a good deal of lace. The smell is great for a spiced winter ale. All of the spices included in the brewing process are evident in the aroma. I don't get much in the way of malt or hops in smell however, more on that to follow. Like the smell, all of the spices are noticeable in the taste but, the stout base is mediocre at best. As a result, I have to say that the balance here is lacking. While I do liked spiced ales there tends to be a very fine line between a good one and an unbalanced one and this one is slightly unbalanced. I should note that as it warms it does seem to get better. The body is moderate to just a touch light of moderate with a finish that leaves a bit of the spice but is otherwise clean.

Pours one shade shy of black with a dense, three inch, mocha-colored head that eventually dissipates into a broken skim and a tight band around the edges. Thick strands of lacing are revealed and exhibit excellent retention. Nose expresses nutmeg and allspice; however, it is quite overpowering. Taste consistent with nose - taste is just like a gingerbread cookie with a suggestion of lactose. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively, even carbonation with just a slight prickle and some residual heat attributable to the overabundance of spice. Well, this is a gingerbread cookie punch in the mouth. If that's your thing, you will really enjoy this beer; however, the overly spiced character really takes away from any possible subtleties or nuances.","Jwale73","Nov 22, 2012"

Ginger again is a dominant flavor here with some nutmeg and all spice rounding out the spice palette. There's some caramel, a hint of chocolate, a touch of lactose, and a bit of wet dog in here to make an attempt at some balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spice laden mouthfeel. I did not enjoy this beer, I rank it right up there with cherry wheat.

The taste is again heavy on spice and it does resemble a gingerbread cookie. Milk sugar also makes its presence know as there is a smooth creamy sweetness that pairs nicely with the spices. I get some roasted barley on the finish, but this is largely undermined by the spice profile. Mouthfeel is a tad prickly with a medium to heavy body. Overall, pretty nice brew from Sam Adams.

3.92,5.9,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Oh, yeah, like I could pass up a gingerbread stout... This one pours a deep black-brown, highlighted in mahogany, topped by two fingers of tan foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts and toasted gingerbread. Straightforward, but decidedly alluring. The taste generally brings in more of the same, along with some cocoa, but everything's toned down, pale in comparison to what my nostrils lapped up so willingly. This was a real downer, lemme tell ya. The body is a a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth, lightly grainy feel. Overall, a pretty tasty little stout, though one that comes across slightly muted on the tongue, a true disappointment for me. I still enjoyed it thoroughly, but I believe I could have seriously relished this stuff had things gone differently.","TMoney2591","Oct 21, 2012"
3.92,5.9,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, it smells like gingerbread, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it's mostly sweet and spicy. There's also the addition of some molasses and cloves to the taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and a bit smooth with moderate carbonation. I think it's a solid overall brew, I might have to buy another bottle. Not too bad for $7.99.","bluejacket74","Oct 20, 2012"
