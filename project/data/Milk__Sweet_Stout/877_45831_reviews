"Raisin and chocolate on the nose. Medium body. Not a lot of oatmeal as the name would imply. Pretty smooth with a coffee undertone."
"Thanks, yankeepride, for the opportunity"
"There is something off in the flavor. Slightly bitter with a watery, chalkie flavor."
""
""
""
"Oatmeal downplayed to the point where I have to ask, ""why call this an oatmeal stout?"""
"I enjoyed this beer and would have it again lite for a stout and goes down easy after a long day at work"
""
""
""
"This is a solid beer from a solid brewery."

"It's a decent stout for sure"
"As stouts go, I'm perhaps spoiled by Russian Imperial Stouts. This stout was good for the profile but overall, rather ordinary. The smell was sweet but the first taste was so unlike the smell that it was initially offputting. Taste improved as it warmed. Overall, not bad, but didn't distinguish itself from other oatmeal stouts to be very memorable."

"Pours very dark black with small foam ring. Oaty nose that is quite prominent. Dark chocolate too. Rich roasted flavor. Shovels of oats. Creamy light milk milk back. Touch of sweetness at the end that blends into a mild hop bitter. Very enjoyable, not overly lactosed like some milk stouts can be."

"I love Rover Horse since they keep making interesting beers and this is no different. A nice deep milk stout that you have to chew. I love them. The color is dark brown with little to no head. The smell is all malt with a little bit of coffee coming from underneath. The taste is dark chocolate, but you instantly get over the sweetness and find the cream and the earthy oatmeal mingling with the hops and malt. A little thin, but the flavors are so good that I thought it makes a good summer stout as well."

"DATE TASTED: February 8, 2014... GLASSWARE: Samuel Smith pint...OCCASION: the reading of A Storm of Swords begins... APPEARANCE: jet black body; unenthused thin brown head; tracings are basically sporadic bubbles... AROMA: some peat and smoke, but predominantly a strange combination: lactic, doughy malts and vanilla sugars argue with strikingly astringent turpentine chemicals--a challenge to take in... PALATE: medium-bodied, slightly dry; rather flat up front, with a beefy after breath ...TASTE: milky, yet the alcohol seems to impede a smoother flavor; some rum elements mingle with a plasticine undertone... OVERALL: This seems a forced attempt at steeping ABV at the cost of taste and experience; River Horse does Jersey proud with some offerings, but this brew is negatively aggressive--upon completing this review, I drank a second and only found the beer more troublesome to place in a positive light...."

"One of the more impressive offerings from River Horse."
""
""
""
"My pour may have been a bit heavy-handed, but I had read nothing in previous reviews to warn me of the massive head that it was capable of producing. I was faced with two fingers of dense, deep-tan head that resembled a chocolate milkshake before I backed off. This was going to be a Carly Simon beer - anticipation, it's making me wait. Once it finally dropped to a manageable level, leaving some decent lacing in its wake, I was ready. Color was a deep, dark cola-brown that allowed zero light penetration. Nose was quite chocolaty, but with a hint of smoke, more towards dark chocolate than milk chocolate. On that note, let us address their untruth in advertising - the ""milk"" is derived from their use of lactose sugar in the brewing process and the oatmeal is used to cut some of the ""burnt"" flavor that early versions took from the extremely roasted malts, not to add the flavor of cookies. Mouthfeel was big, thick and silky and the taste was more like sweet chocolate than the nose had led me to expect, so apparently their use of oatmeal worked. Finish was more towards milk chocolate and it was certainly sweet, so I have to give it to them in terms of style. I just wish that their label was more direct and less misleading."

"Good tasting milk stout; dark, no light gets through the glass of this tasty beer; lighter and a bit sweeter than other milk stouts; lower abv.... Just a good smooth stout. Good grade. I'd have another one of these any day. I will give this a better rating than left Hans's version; good head and lacing too."

"O - Very good oatmeal stout. I like the combination of coffee, malt tastes, and the sweetness. The ABV is not high, so I drank a couple glasses. I will buy this again."

"12 oz bottle from Trader’s Joe. Pours black with long lasting, creamy, beige head. Aroma is of bread crust, burnt toast, brown sugar and some raisins. Body is medium, smooth and creamy. Taste is of prunes, burnt toast, brown sugar and hint of chocolate. Finish is short and watery. Boring brew."

"Can't complain about this one, drinks solid and well made."

"Overall: Pretty solid stout. Nothing too special about this but it's good. Drinking a fresh one so I'm gonna let the rest sit for a while so the flavors can mature."

"O: Great. Not as good as Moo Hoo but it's up there. This has a slightly thicker mouthfeel and more coffee thank Moo Hoo but it's great none the less."
""
""
"This is a very dark, black-ish beer, with a tan head. The coffee-like aroma is mixed with grain, distant smoke, and a bit of dark malt smells. For taste, this beer is drier than I expected, but still robust, with a firm bitterness and some grain and highly roasted malt flavors. It has a heavy body, with a very smooth, dense, and mouth-filling feel. All in all, this is a solid brew."
"Overall one of the best beers I believe River Horse makes. If I ever order from Halftime Beverage again I will pick up a six pack. Great quality stout."
""
"Overall: A very well balanced oatmeal milk stout. I can easily see having a few in a sitting. Heck, I wish I had another one right now, but sadly I only bought a 6-pack and this was my last one. I hope I can make my way back to the local beer store to get one more six pack before this seasonal disappears until next year. River Horse clearly has a winner here. A perfectly done oatmeal milk stout brewed in NJ. What else can a beer lover ask for??"
""
"O nice milk stout thats very easy to drink. Thanks Mat."
""
""
"Poured into a nonic. Got a nice 2 finger dark tan head on a black body. Roasty malts and chocolate in the aroma. Tastes a bit like chocolate malt in beer form with a bit of tang. Nice bitter note in there, mixes nicely with the overall sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with small amount of carbonation. Really enjoy this beer, and can't wait for my next glass."
""
"O: Quite nice for an oatmeal & milk stout - a combination that I really enjoyed. Easy to drink and quite sessionable and a beer that was enjoyed by all of my guests at the Super Bowl party. Probably the best offering from this brewery that I have experienced."
"the only thing holding it back was perhaps just a little bit too sweet almost savory like a dessert beer but maybe thats what it should be used for..."
""
""
"Jet black, silky in appearence with a nice cocoa head. Aroma of cocoa and grain. Nice flavor of chocolate with a very nice sweetness. Lingering roasted flavor. Faint vanilla hints. Nice soft and somewhat silky mouthfeel. A nice beer all in-one of the better offerings I have had from River Horse."
""
"Overall: A very solid oatmeal stout. May be River Horse’s best. I could certainly sip on a six pack on a cold winter’s day."
""
""
"O - this is a great anytime beer and am hoping to see in bottles soon. was lucky enough to get a growler filled at joe canal's in woodbridge thanks to my brother."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the drinkability is excellent, pretty filling though and the roasty character might overpower the sweets after a while, another great brew from River Horse!"
""
""
""
"o: not much oatmeal detectable in this one. still prettty good for a milk stout. would recommend to others."
"O: I'm surprised I'm liking this as much as I am. There's not much going on, but there's a great balance of creamer sweetness with a coffee bitter finish. The value is great at $9 a 6 pack and it's very drinkable."
"M/O: Wow, this is one smooth beer. Medium-full bodied with mild carbonation, and a full on silk mouthfeel. When you see those lame commercials about over-priced chocolate or yogurt or whatever and they keep saying ""smooth, rich decadence"" ooolala. Well.... River Horse Oatmeal Milk Stout is like that."
"Very rich and creamy, not sure how many I could drink in succession but it is quite tasty."

"This brew was labeled as a brewer's reserve when I had it back in 2010. The beer poured out as a nice deep black color with a nice tan/brown colored head on it. The smell of the beer was roasted, even a little chocolaty. The taste of the beer had a pretty good sweetness to it. The roasted malts were nice and left a sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer was a little on the thin side to me, I wasn't too impressed there. Overall this beer was decent, I don't see why it was a ""brewer's reserve"" but if they want to say that I guess they can."
"O - Surprised how much I liked this. Would have this again, at least on tap."
"Pours a jet black, with a half-finger, chocolate colored head. The head floats for a good while on top of the beer and leaves great lacing on the sides of the glass. Wow....what a great looking beer. Smells of sweet chocolate, a small hint of coffee, and roasted malts. Tastes of dark chocolate with a mild hop profile. Very good carbonation, but the beer seems a bit thin. Overall a very good beer. Glad I had a chance to try it."
"O - My first trying it. I'm looking forward to my second time"
"The pour was decent, dark brown in color with a small, very quick head of light tan that left no lacing and hardly anything on top. This was worrisome for me at first as I was afraid it may have been a bit flat, but it was just the look that appeared a bit off. Aroma of deep roasted malts, light smoke and nice chocolate notes start to come through right away. Smooth, even and as it warm relatively unchanged. Light vanilla in here now as I take the first sip. A bit slick, I was expecting a bit fuller feel to it, but the taste still came across nicely. Smokey with nice notes of peat and burnt sugar mixing with a light chocolate and creamy lactose flavor. Nicely done. Each sip seem to get more and more smokey, which was a nice touch and the finish was just dry enough and left just enough sweetness on the tongue to leave me very pleased."
"M - Medium/light body, but not too light for the style. Sweet finish."
"D: I'd enjoy a pint or two of this."
"D: To me this is about as drinkable as they come. The flavors do not get old and the lack of carbonation makes it easy to drink. My favorite River Horse beer and one of my favorites all around."
"D: I had no problem drinking this and could have easily have a few of these in one night."
"D-very smooth and refeshing, extremely easy to drink with an inviting palate and gentle robust flavors."
"I'm not too keen on the smell. A little funk there. Otherwise a nice beer. Malty, creamy, perhaps a bit heavy on the roast. Sweet but not cloying, which helps drinkability a lot. Solid. I don't know if I will buy this again, but it certainly was not a disappointment."
"d- nice, this is a very drinkable milk stout, one of the better ones that i've had, glad to have this as a local brew for me."
"Mouthfeel: This beer is pretty light overall for me with a good deal of carbonation. Not too bad though. It's a very drinkable beer that I would love to have access to all of the time. Very good beery by River Horse."
"D: Pretty sessionable with a decent abv, great flavors, and great feel to it."
"D- this is a real solid beer, shame I've never run into it here in PA...would definitely get it again if I was in the mood"
"Over all enjoying this beer, but I could not see having one or two at a sitting. Also need to re-evaluate in the future- the smoked jerky aroma/ flavor... curious. This may be why I think it would go with a good bowl of venison/beef stew"
"For an Oatmeal Stout this isn't really that heavy. Decent amount of alcohol in it with a 6.7% ABV., but doesn't seem to be too noticeable. It's very easy to go down."
"D - This awesome beer is very easy to fall in love with and drink a few. In my opinion, the best of River Horse beers. By bottle is good but on tap is even better!"
"Overall this is a great stout, and if you have the chance you should DEFINITELY give it a try...I've also found this to be a good first stout for people who haven't tried it and a rare exception for people who usually don't care for stouts."
"D: Quite drinkable, but the lack of bottom may grate on Milk Stout connoisseurs."
"Overall the drinkability is good here, pretty filling though and the roasty character might overpower the sweets after a while, one of the best offering I have had from River Horse that's for sure. Good hybrid style brew."
"Overall, not bad, but a bit burnt of the tongue. Somewhat drinkable for what it is."
"Bottle. Batch 005. Pours a drak cola colored brown with a slightly tan 1/2 finger head. Light roast coffee and leather aromatics in the nose. Some malty sweetness present in the nose as well. Medium mouthfeel. Sort of like drinking a light roast cold press coffee with a nice sweetness from the lactose. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Not bad but nothing super stellar either."
"drinks easy and quick. nice for a brisk evening by an outside fire, or perfect for breakfast. i highly recommend this if you can get it. one of the better takes on the style."
"D: Not a huge beer, so its pretty drinkable. I could dig this beer with some smores on a cold night by the campfire."
"Beer is surprisingly light in body but overall creamy in the mouth. All the flavors are pretty subdued though. Some bitterness in the back but only mild to moderate sweetness up front. No oatmeal so I guess its just a body component but it doesn't really fill out the beer. Its pretty mild and overall drinkable. Its pretty good."
"M/D - very good tasting, very creamy with good carbonation"
"D: Very nice. Not normally one of my favorite styles, but I loved the smooth nature of this alongside the very nice balance of coffee and chocolate flavors."
"Drinkability: Smooth and reasonably well-balanced. Not a bad little milk stout, really."
"Pours a rich, deep, dark near black color, decent head but minimal retention & lacing. Smell is of dry hot chocolate mix - bitter cocoa but sweet, creamy scent. Taste is mostly semi-sweet chocolate, loses the character of the nose and resembles mostly an oatmeal stout. Body is full, dry chalky finish, minimal aftertaste. Good beer, scent showed lots of promise of balance, but the oatmeal side defeats the lactose. Would be a top notch beer if adjusted."
"Consumed: 3/14/2010 - Pi Day"
"Overall I like this one, although after finishing the whole pint you kind of lose the milk stout feel. Good, but not great. This is my first from this brewery and I will be trying more now."
"Overall, a very nice beer. I'd like to try more of their stuff."
"D: A pretty decent stout by basic stout standards. Nothing offending, but nothing eye-opening either. I do recommend this to anyone wanting to try a stout for the first time. Easy to drink, but not mind blowing."
"On tap at The Ginger Man, Starts out with moldy taste and then overtaken by big coffee. Wierd and not too drinkable. The smell was not the roast I was expecting, rather neutral instead. I should have complained to try another, but have been warned that you don't get too far at this bar regardless of your bad experience. Colour was fine, as was carbonation."
"Oats do a lot for the body. Something metallic in the middle that's not quite right, though."
"D- Not what I have come to expect from a stout. It seemed pretty light and I could drink many of these"
"Go Phillies!"
"D- I don't know if I have ever had an Oatmeal Milk stout before, but I really liked this one. I would recommend, and will seek out and other of RH's offerings."
"I seem to remember last year's being heavier on the cocoa, sweeter and denser. However this year is still a good stout that I would recommend."
"pours a great pitch color, with a nice tan head that diminishes slowly, and laces nicely. wonderfully milky/honey nose, sweet and full . The taste is everything it could be. nice roasted malts. That milky taste mixed with a great sweetness that doesn't overpower. the roasted oatmeal finishes off the taste. interesting combo, I really enjoyed it, get it if you can"
"D: not as sweet as many of the other sweet stouts I've experienced, but overall quite enjoyable."
"O - I have to pick some of this up whenever I see it again. It should be in production more often."
"A solid beer indeed!"
"D: It's not exactly a sessionable beer, nothing too enjoyable to bring you back for more. Very tasty nonetheless."
"D-Th drinkability is decent, but I'm not sold on this beer. I might give it another go sometime, but it certainly won't be a staple in my fridge."
"an over all very good oatmeal milk stout .i enjoy a good stout and i would get this again .if you can find this oatmeal stout pick it up."
"D: A beer my wife and I can agree on! Sneaks up on you."
"D: The smokiness could get overwhelming after a while but one or two of these is great"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of chocolate and cream, some oats. Taste like it smells, oats and cream, a bit sweet. Feels creamy in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a fine brew."
"D: good, enjoyable milk stout."
"Pours a five+ finger tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Opaque dark brown color. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Molasses nose. Flavor is sweet molasses and coffee. $1.83 for a 12oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"Pretty drinkable, a solid beer overall."
"Pours an opaque black color with a half finger fizzy head that disappears fairly quickly into nothing, the beer ends up looking like a cup of black coffee, no real carbonation can be seen. No lacing is left on my glass at all either. The smell here is amazing, smells like a latte almost, roasted coffee and sweets mixed with roasted malts and oatmeal, the good sweets are definitely from the oatmeal. Taste is almost the same, roasted malts and coffee, a bit of hops bitterness, a bit of sweets but then there is some weird watery taste that throws it all off but does not ruin the taste. Mouthfeel is good here too, pretty creamy but at the same time the carbonation and fizzyness throws the stout character off, sweet oat flavor is left on the tongue as a good after taste. Drinkability is good here, no bad alcohol flavors, pretty filling though and the roasty character might overpower the sweets after a while, good six pack for sure though."
"D - Pretty darned quaffable."
"Pitch black with ruby highlights. An inch of sticky brown foam. Nose is coffee and molasses, dark fruit and quite malty. Flavour is balanced sweetness and bitterness. Lots of toasted grain and some hops in the back end as well. Some big fruit and caramel shore up the middle. Smooth body and medium carbonation. Very drinkable and amply tasty."
"D - This is really not a heavy stout, but it's so ridiculously balanced. You must find this one, it blows all non KBS, CBS breakfast stouts out of the water. TRY IT!"
"D - I really like this sweet stout. It is a deliciously balanced version of the style."
"A: Dark brown to black, espresso like froth in color - 3.50, S: The lactose base and strong coffee dominate the nose, a slight syrupy sweetness which mixes nicely with the noticeable charring aroma - 4.25, T: Very nicely flavored milk stout, some burnt coffee (that's good), milk chocolate, a little dark fruitiness similar to plums - 4.25, M: As one might expect from a milk stout, this one is exceptional creamy, extra body in this beer - 4.50, D: I'm impressed, a very tasty beer that I'd happily drink again - 4.50"
"HV"
"D -Pretty Easy drinker, could have had one more of these for sure. Not too high ABV either. Not too over powering on the pallet. Like a desert! Want more!!!"
"Moderately drinkable, average beer."
"Pitch black colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is mainly light chocolate.Taste is chocolate,smoked malts and cream.Overall a little bit thin on the flavor but still a pretty good brew.I would recommend to stout drinkers and I 'm pretty sure I would purchase again."
"d: I liked this one, but I can't help but feel like something, I have no idea what, was missing."
"D - Oh yeah, very much."
"Nicely done! I've been more and more impressed with the beers from River Horse within the last year and a half or so, and this one really helps to bolster my opinion of them."
"River Horse asks us to ""break out of the ordinary"" which may be more of a 'do as I say and not as I do' kind of thing. All of their beers I've yet to try were very ordinary styles, albeit ones brewed fantastically. What I do intend to break out in the future is definitely more River Horse offerings; I hope they're all as good as this one!"
"Overall: sure man, anytime"
"Poured deep brown with a tan head. The aroma is faint - some roast, some sweet malt notes. The taste starts off sweet - definitely lactose present, then transitions to light roast and smoke, and ends sharply bitter. The body is ok, I'd expect a little more from an oatmeal stout. Overall, a decent beer."
"D: Pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of Oatmeal Stouts anymore, but this is a solid example of the style, and it's something I might pick up if I lived in the area. I don't feel compelled to seek it out though."
"Flavor delivers a well-balanced mix of toasted chocolate & coffee malts, vanilla oats, and lactose. Body is silky smooth, with a velvet consistency and a gentle carbonation level that coats the palate and allows the complexity of the malts & milk to shine. All in all, a solid, tasty Milk/Oatmeal Stout that I'd be eager to have again."
"D: only slightly above average here. Way overcarbonated, lacked a real milky and cremay nature and cant say this was particular good when compared to such staples as Youngs, or even Sam Adams and Lancasters milk stout which I found to be exceptional. Much better out there by style. This was also a little on the high side abv wise which would limit multiples."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a really nice black, chocolate, and roasted malt scent along with a hint of lactose. The taste is good. It has a sharp, roasted flavor that boasts of black and chocolate malts. It goes down easy and finishes dry with the slightest bit of sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine sweet stout. It has excellent malt complexity and isn't overly sweet; just right."
"Drinkability: Very cool brew. A very distinct toastiness with lots of harsh flavors. I really like it but would have had a hard time drinking this is mass quantities."
"Recommended, 5 stars."
"M/D - Light carbonation with a full and creamy mouthfeel. Pretty good drinkability hindered only by body of the beer. My favorite milk stout to date."
"Nice, but didn't too a whole lot for me. I can see putting back a few of these on any given night though..."
"D: Very smooth and light bodied drink. The taste doesn't back up in your mouth. I was surprised by this beer. Thank you for the extra Giglemesh."
"D - Bitter roast and strong alcohol presence don't lend this to being a highly drinkable beer. It was enjoyable, but I don't mind that this was a one time limited release."
"m/d - Easy to drink, very tasty, light enough to session."
"Pours the darkest of browns with a fluffy tan head. Excellent retention,and a nice laceing. Aroma is of roasted coffee,chocolate and oats. Body is thick and smooth with some carbonation. Taste is a milky mix of dark chocolate,oats and coffee. Nice bitter sweet chocolate finish. This beer is a meal in a bottle!Excellent."
"I only wished that I had picked up another sixer. It says that it is a limited edition offering. The brewery should definitely bring this one back again. If you see it, pick it up. I think that you will enjoy it."
"D: This beer was pretty easy to drink. At 6.7% alcohol, I could enjoy a few of these in a sitting."
"Taste. Now lately, I have been drinking the BCS from Brooklyn so I wasn't expecting much from this beer but it has a very good taste. Coffee, with a very. very slight hint of sweet chocolate. No alcohol taste at all, I cant tell if I miss that or not but this is a worthy beer."
"D: near perfect - straightforward presentation of 2 or 3 chief elements, no unpleasant notes, no hint of nearly 7% ABV."
"Dark black with a mediumish tan head and moderate lacing. The nose is all chocolate powder and a little cappucino. The taste is not complex but oh so good. It is like drinking a frozen hot chocolate with some offsetting bitterness. Very creamy mouthfeel and excessively drinkable. Impossible to tase any of the 6.7% abv. Well done River Horse! Now remake the rest of the line up."
"UPDATE: I've since tried Sierra Nevada Stout, and have to say it's very similar to the Oatmeal Milk Stout. If anyone is having a hard time finding the River Horse variant, the Sierra Nevada shouldn't be difficult to track down, and will give you a very good idea of what to expect. Think of the River Horse as a slightly thicker, slightly maltier, and less bitter version of the Sierra Nevada."
"Serving type: Kegerator"
"No detectable alcohol which is nice. Drinkability is decent, I can have more than 1. Abv isn't too high. Another solid offering from this brewery."
"D: First sample I've had of the newer River Horse beers and I'm impressed. Big, balanced flavors without the intensity of some other bigger stouts. More of a session stout if this is style is your type of beer. Body was only thing that didn't quite mesh for me as it finishes slightly soda-like. Otherwise, a great stout that I will seek out again."
"edit: as it warmed, the aroma became very milky. nice."
"Enjoyable session stout. Lets see some Jersey pride."
"Pours a very dark brown with attractive red highlights and a booming tower of a brown head. Roasty toasty goodness emanates from the nose, big burnt coffee malt notes, a lingering funk and a slight pungent bitterness. Semi-sweet, roasted chocolate malt attacks first, directly followed by a very bitter coffee bean flavor, orange peel and a floral grassyness on the finish. Smooth, oily slick and slightly creamy with a light/medium body that is just crazy drinkable. Really liking the changes im tasting, keep up the good work River Horse."
"This is the best bottled River Horse beers so far. They are making some changes over there and this Milk Stout proves it. It wasn't overly roasted and you even get a tiny taste of milk. If there is one River Horse beer you need to try, this is the one. A six pack of this won't last for very long."
"D: One of the highest I have had for the style. I would guess abv coming in about 4% so obviously well hidden and constructed. Keep em up River Horse."
"Well done Riverhorse."
"This is a very nice beer overall, and probably my favourite of anything I've sampled from River Horse. I know I've knocked their regular lineup in the past as being mediocre, but the seasonals have been breathing some life back into the brewery and the new (-ish) Brewer's Reserve Series has been doing an even better job cranking out inspired, well made brews. Skip the basics and head for the limited stuff when it comes to River Horse, and make this one your top priority. A very nice beer."
"Hmmm, after puting in my rating and then reading the others, I can't help but wonder if there was something wrong with my bottle. Especially from the flat pour to flatter body. I may have to give this one another shot."
"Recommended..."
"D - A great stout-I really enjoyed the full flavor combo of smooth malt and creamy milk stou in one bottle - Very drinkable"
"Pours a dark black with a hint of cherry color. Large 2+"" tan head. Smells of malted milk with a hint of roasted coffee beans. Taste is more of vanilla toffee or coffee than the milk. Its definitely sweet with a not malt background and a tuch of hops at the finish. Very smooth with a bit af carbonation at the back of the throat. There is not a hint of the 6.7% ABV. Definitely one of the better river horse options."
"Overall, I thought this was a really great example of the style and really enjoyable to drink. Definitely recommend."
"Drinkability: this is a great session stout despite the slightly higher alcohol contents. Now one of my favorite beers from this brewery."
"Very drinkable w/ a slight hop bite. I am excited that Riverhorse is expanding their line of beer w/ a variety of special releases. I will enjoy this beer again."
"i was looking forward to this beer for a long time after hearing about it from the people at the brewery. finally found some yesterday and was very excited. riverhorse proved again why they are one of my favorite local breweries. smooth feel with a creamy finish. exactly what i expected. this beer was easy on the mouth and had a couple of surprises. a slight taste of hops at the end was a delight combined with a warm smokey flavor. i would recommend this to anyone looking to expand their beer palate. yum :)"
"Delicious!"
"A nice stout - doesn't quite have the lactose and sweetness that others have - but, as a sweet-ish stout, it's very nice. Alcohol is reasonably, but not completely, well-covered. If it were more so (or lowered), I could easily drink plenty of this one. As it is - still very drinkable!"
"D- Easy drinking milk stout for sure. River Horse is making better beers...."
