"Well balanced aroma and flavor. Nice caramel color. Great stout to pair with salty snacks."

"Cream chocolate aroma. Black body with a good two finger tan soap bubbled head. Roasted chocolate malt taste. Crisp and bubbly feeling. Light creamy cocoa in the finish. Has a nice balance and not over powering."
"Very sweet chocolate taste. No hop presence, no bitterness, drinks like a dessert. Great transitional beer for those who dont like bitter beers."
""
""
"O: I liked this beer quite a bit. Nice and smooth, with big roasted flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Nice and rich. Goes down smoothly with plenty of flavor."

"Great tasting chocolate stout. The best!!"
"Out of the beers from their brewery, I never expected one so divine."

"Very smooth, low abv, and has great taste.."
""
"Not bad, has a darker beer after taste but smooth"
""
""
""
""
"This is a smooth Stout"
""
"    Overall, I'll rate Samuel Adams Cream Stout - Boston Beer Company (Samuel Adams) with a 4.5. This was purchased 2 months after the """for brewery fresh taste, purchase, so that might have to do with this awesome experience. I will purchase this again."

"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. Opaque dark brownish black with two fingers of creamy moderately resilient tan foam. Low key nose does tease at some malt complexity, light roast coffee and cream, a whiff of vanilla caramels. Palate is fortunately more bold, with a very """old world""" rich malt complexity that surprises. Has that characteristic milk stout creamy feel but with less sweetness than expected ... Roasted grains, a puff of ashtray, dark chocolate covered coffee beans, brown toast, molasses, and a lingering toffee-like sweetness lurking somewhere in the pit. It is rather difficult to convey where this beer falls along the stout continuum: My descriptors probably make this beer sound stronger tasting than is the case. Everything is more robust than a Guinness or comparable Irish dry but more subtle than an imperial. Lingering roasted cafe latte like malts in the semi-dry finish. The sweetness does become more salient over time as the bitter receptors chill out. I am getting more hop character than expected as well, an earthy grass-herb note from beginning to end. I have yet to see this here in Alberta, had to seek it out down south. Worth the search."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely can taste the cheapness in this beer definitely way too bitter"
"Excellent stout. Very well-balanced and creamy. No particular standout notes which is a good thing."
""
"This is my favorite beer for washing down a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  Rich and creamy mouthfeel, flavorful, roasty and sweet, smells just great and looks just so inviting with its fluffy tan head and significant lacing.  My favorite style is imperial stouts, but their ABV is often too high to wash down that kind of meal with, at least at my pace.  I find this stout nicely  fills the niche that exists in the gap between traditional stouts and imperial stouts.  While I don't drink one nearly as often as a Guinness for example, I certainly enjoy it more when I do."
""
"Well I had heard good things about this stout so I was excited to see it arrive at a local shop.  The stout has a good dark color but not as black as I would expect.  The nose left a lot to be desired.  I did not detect any complexity just roasted malts and some light cream and hops.  When I took a sip I was a little lost.  All I could taste is smokiness and bitter hops from start to finish.  I expect some smokiness from stouts but it was over the top.  Where was the cream? chocolate? vanilla? and all the other flavors that you would expect from a stout, no less a cream stout?  I let it warm even more and did not find that it improved, just the same smokiness and hops.  I don't know maybe I am missing something but I did drink the whole 6 pack before writing this review.  I would not seek this out again as there are better cream stouts out there."
"Nice flavor and aroma. More than I was expecting."
""
"Definite notes of chocolate.  A little heavy."

"I seem to be missing something with this offering from Sam. Aftertaste is like licking an ashtray. I enjoy a smokey stout, but this one seems to be overboard."
"My favorite pretzels in the world are made from a small company that burns them on purpose. They are my favorite to snack on them and are a rare treat. This beer has an after taste just like those pretzels and I love it. However the initial taste was pretty bitter at first but halfway through, it lost its bitterness and became creamy. It's a pretty good beer to sit down and drink or have with a meal."

"O – This is much closer to a dry Irish stout than a milk stout, in all respects.  I think it’s actually pretty good for an Irish stout, but that’s not really what the objective was.  With that said, a very drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor I noticed first would be a burnt coffee bean. Then the earthy notes  quickly  come into action. This stout does not  over power with  flavor and is easily  drinkable . Not sure I would call it creamy though, but is quite smooth. Will get again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While I won't say it's bad.  I do have to say that for a stout it don't have a whole lot of flavor"
""
""
""
"Overall (4.04) : It's not the best stout I've ever had but most every stout is pretty good if it's done right. This one is different in the way that it's got more of a burnt coffee profile, and I wouldn't exactly call it creamy, but it's good nonetheless. If roasted stouts and charred coffee bean are your thing, this beer will be in good company with you. Relatively low ABV at 4.9%, so it's most definitely sessionable."

"Color is very dark and does not want to let you see through it, fine by me !!, lol. Head is average and lacing is decent. Carbonation is just right on this beer. Taste is very good, with bitter chocolate and coffee up front and a hint of marshmallow and sweetness at the end. Aftertaste is good with a nice dark coffee lingering afterwards. Overall, a great beer in this category and was enjoyed!"

"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass, with a one finger fine khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet dark malt, graham crackers, mild lactose. Flavor is sweet, mildly toasted malt, crackers, hints of vanilla and milk chocolate. Finishes semi-dry with slight hop bitterness. Medium, lightly creamy body. A nice milk stout that covers all the expected flavor notes. A bit light in flavor, but what's here is good and well integrated. A good, safe milk stout."

"O - Great. One of my new favorites. Only reason I didn't give Taste a 5 was because of 1 oatmeal stout I've had that was the best stout I've ever tasted. This was good though!!!"

"Sam Adams Cream Stout pours very dark, and has a decent head and pleasing aroma. While it's a good tasting, easy drinking stout, it fails to deliver anything special in the way of mouthfeel. It's texture is a bit thin for my taste, but overall, it's a good stout if you're interested in trying out the style."

"If you ask my boy Jones, he'll tell you that I call Samuel Adams Cream Stout the """Holy Grail of Beers""". I started drinking this beer several years ago - myself and a good buddy started """dabbling""" into the darker beers over ten years ago, and stumbled (pardon the pun) onto this beer, and have been enjoying it ever since. Very dark in color, wonderful smell, very smooth drinking, with that chocolaty finish that I like...with a slight bit of a bite. I would classify this beer as my all time favorite. If you are a """stout""" beer drinker, this is a must try...I think my boy Jones just finished up the last one he had - looks like we'll be searchin' for more soon!"

"Overall pretty good actaully, surprising that it's been around this long and still a nice beer. It doesn't hit a homerun, but for an easy drinking cream stout there isn't really anything wrong with it."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 6/2014. Pours crustal clear very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of milk chocolate, caramel, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toffee, toast, biscuit, brown bread, nuttiness, cream, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and lactose notes; with great strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, nuttiness, cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, coffee, roast, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, lactose, and moderate earthy hop flavor; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish as expected of 4.9%. Overall this is an excellent cream stout! All around great robustness and complexity of dark/roasted malt and lactose flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"O: The one that introduced me to stouts a few years ago. A great gateway beer. Tasty with a brownie or chocolate chip cookie."

""

"I've heard a lot about cream stouts, and wanted to give it a try. I timidly bought this beer and am very happy with the smoothness and flavor of this beer. It pours a deep dark black, yet it doesn't have the strong heaviness that is normally associated with dark stouts."
"Overall: Pretty decent flavored stout. One of my favorite of the Sam Adams offerings."

"Nice light brown cream colored head with decent lacing on the glass. Really good body and taste. Was not expecting much. For a domestic mass produced beer this is really pretty good. Nice mellow flavor. I really liked this one. I will definitely drink the rest of the six pack."
"Pours black with a 1-finger beige head with some patterned lacing seen. The aroma is of caramel & roasted malts with a hint of chocolate and coffee. The taste is the same with a little hop finish BUT it is light and not bad. Overall, a great brew."
""
"O: Body could have been better, and I think the admixture of vanilla, anise and/or oak would have complimented this beer quite well. Recommended if you like stouts that aren't super robust."

"I really want to like Samuel Adams brews but until trying their Cream Stout, remained disappointed. I find their lager and ale to be too hoppy. The Cream Stout, however, was a game changer. It is not easily found in my area so anytime I come across a supply I buy several six-packs. It looks good, smells good, pours good, and taste good. My only negative is the head disappears too soon and there is little to no lacing."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a pretty good example of the style, it did a good job of representing the style while having some good balance and even a little bit of complexity, I enjoyed it. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, creamy, not too filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these when in the mood for this style. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and aroma they were just what I wanted in the style and the appearance was also really good. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but the carbonation could be just slightly lower. I would get a six pack of this again to keep in the fridge for when I'm in the mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style or dark beers in general. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I admit that sometimes I get caught up into the big, bold, and flavorful stouts, but it's always nice to come back to a dark beer like this is one that's tasty, smooth, and drinkable. Good job guys this is pretty close to a textbook example of the style and I'm glad to have access to it, keep up the good work."

"The smell was coffee, caramel, chocolate, and slight hops. The taste was out of this world for me. The chocolate was overall the leader of the pack once it hits the taste buds and slide back the flavors pour from chocolate to coffee to finally a faint milky caramel sweetness. Then the great part the pallet opens up for the final hint of alcohol to make this combination a favorite of mine. From cool summer nights to hot humid days i believe i would enjoy this beer no matter what."
""
""
""
""
""
"Finally found a six pack of creme stout and had to try it. When you smell it you can definitely smell the coffee. You taste that and the caramel but not the chocolate, which isn't a bad thing. The beer was close to black in my glass but tasted great. Probably should have gotten it in the fall, but overall, a good Sam Adams."
""

"Very impressed by this one. The balance is perfect - not too sweet, not too heavy, just a great example of the style."

"Poured this one into a Samuel Adams """Perfect Pint""" glass. This is one I’ve wanted to have for a good while now. The aroma is of sweetness with chocolates and coffee. The taste when it’s cold is bittersweet chocolate and subtle bits of coffee. As it warms up, roasty flavors become much more prominent. The look is pitch black with no light getting through... a creamy cinnamon head fluffs on top as well. Lacing is decent, but patchy. Mouthfeel is smooth but not too thick, making this 4.9% beer nicely drinkable. Overall, a very respectable beer."

"Very drinkable beer. I've purchased it several times. This would be a great way to introduce someone to a stout, or just beer in general. Great stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent, for what it is - i.e., a lighter-style, easy-drinking stout."
""
""
"O: Pretty impressive brew here from Sam Adams. Gunna say this is one of the better beers I've had from the Boston Beer Company."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice smooth refreshing stout. Not terribly complex but definitely enjoyable. The smoothness and the low ABV make this a good session beer. Being a big fan of stouts, I can't say it's my favorite but It definitely satisfies the craving."
""
""
""
"O - This is a very good example of the sweet stout style. Avoids the harsh tannin bitterness that is too often found. Well worth a try."
""
"If it was the only stout available I wouldn't have a problem sessioning this beer but if I had the choice I would look for a more unique stout. I would say it is my 5th choice of a cream or milk stout. It was good but just average for a milk stout and would probably be a good choice if you were introducing someone to dark beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Easily one of my favorites. For the Guinness die-hards, a great, slightly less filling choice with a higher ABV and more complete flavor. Do yourself a favor and try it."
"Even though the ABV is only 4.9%, this beer is very filling."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very well balanced, medium bodied with low carbonation."
"Soft chocolate and coffee notes that are slightly bitter give way to a creamy mouth feel with burnt malt nutty flavors. This is followed by a sharp sting from carbonation leading to bitter herbal notes keeping the mouth lively. The mouth feel is wonderful. This a delicious cream stout with a nice sweetness balanced out by bitter notes making it more savory than sweet - excellent."
""
""
"This beer pours up a deep obsidian, as black as the darkest night, as black as my ex girlfriend's evil heart. There is a one and a half finger head the color of caramel with good retention and lots of lacing. The smell is coffee and roasted nuts. Taste is very sweet and malty up front with a very dry bitter coffee and roasted nutty finish with some mild sour lemon notes. Mouthfeel is nice, full and satisfying. Pretty good offering."
"It pours a dark opaque brown almost black. Great lacing and thick head with tiny bubbles. This is the best quality of this beer. It smells boozy. The taste is definite roasted malts and then booze. It has a decent body and good carbonation. I would pass this up in the future for other stouts and at the price it was being sold for there are definitely better stouts."
""
"nose composed of milk chocolate and bit of coffee, mildly sweet, palate like bitter sweet chocolate milk, very pleasant silky medium to full body, nice carbonation, overall palate and nose are just ok but the creamy-ness of it really stands out, nice smooth stout to start out."

"This is by far one of my favorite sam adams brews. The overall feel and taste is top notch and it does leave a tasty creamy after taste. Its smooth for a dark beer and smells mostly like barley with a hint of chocolate. This is definitely one of my favorite beers from sam adams."

"O - A very solid low gravity stout. It lacks some flavor that the bigger stouts have, but this one is very palatable."
""
"Poured black with a thick tan head that produced a lot of lacing and stuck around solidly. Smelled of burnt malt, coffee, and a hint of coffee or espresso. Tasted of espresso with a little bit of unsweet chocolate. A slight hoppiness that balanced the roasted malt and kept the beer from being too sweet. Had a creamy (as the name says) mouthfeel as a milk stout should."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and rather flavorful for the style."
"Overall - Microbrewers take note, this is a fantastic stout. Smooth like Guinness, but with a far superior flavor profile. A for sure future buy."

"Deep dark brown with a tall fluffy head with decent retention and lacing. Smells and tastes of a blend of dark and milk chocolate, a dash of coffee and cream, and a hint of toffee sweetness. Medium body and carbonation levels, creamy smooth texture."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a rich beer, heavy in flavor, but not so heavy in the body or alcohol as a big Russian Impy. This beer and style fit in a nice sweet spot, very solid offering."

"O: This is a slow sipper for me as with all stouts. As to how it measures up to others in its class, its right up there at the top. One of Sam Adams finest creations, cheers!"

"Poured from a bottle into a Dead Guy Ale pint glass. Pours a deep black with a tan two finger head. Looks delicious. Leaves an odd spiderweb like lacing all throughout the glass once finished. The smell is of dark chocolate and coffee. Not a fan of dark chocolate, But whatever, smells good. The taste starts off as medium toasted malt, Met in the finish by a rich, chocolate flavor and ever so slight coffee beans. Tastes like a big ole Chips Ahoy Cookie. The mouthfeel is pretty much the same, Once swallowed it feels as though you just took a big bite out of a cookie with chunky bits of chocolate chips. It also has an extremely creamy finish and is as smooth as velvet. Would I buy it again? Yes, Oh yes"

"Pours a deep brown color with a thick, tan head. Roasted malt and residual sweetness dominate the nose. The beer tastes roasty and chocolatey, with significant sweetness. There's also a mild astringent flavor. Sort of like a poorly sanitized homebrew. Possibly a bad bottle? The beer is full bodied with fair carbonation. Overall a decent stout, other than the lingering off-flavor."

"All in all, a much more complicated beer than I'd expected for 4.9% ABV. Well done, Sam Adams!"

"O: A very nice, easy-drinking cream stout with just the right amount of sweetness. Definitely on the sessionable side and at a nice price point and availability. Probably doesn't get the attention it deserves because of the size of SA/BBC"

"I'm slowly turning into a stout fan and this one is going to help."

"Overall: Very easy to drink, and with such a bitter bite makes it even better. This beer is only something I will drink if it’s fresh. It is still one of my favorite stouts."

"O-It could be that Creme Brulee ruined all other Milk Stouts for me however it isn't that sweet, I didn't get any chocolate and it was thin."
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown with a finger length light brown head. There's an aroma of roasted malts and coffee. I can also smell some chocolate. The first sip delivers the roasted malt flavor as well as the coffee and hints of chocolate. There's a pleasing mild bitterness. The flavors linger on the palatte. This is mildly carbonated and abundant lacing is left on the glass. This beer is medium bodied and very smooth and creamy. This is a well balanced, top notch beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This one of the better stouts that I have tried. It is going to find a place on my go-to list of beers."

"O: One of my favorite Sam Adams, and Stouts in general. Very drinkable, and a great beer for desert."
""
"O: My first milk stout. I love the interplay of the creaminess with the mildly bitter coffee character. Extremely drinkable. The cappuccino of beers."
"A nice black with a off white head that eventually reduced to a small splattering across the surface. Smelled of roasted malts, some coffee and cocoa with a complimentary and balanced flavor. A nice and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, honestly, this is just one of those beers where there really isn't anything bad about it but it just doesn't really do much for me and I probably wouldn't buy again."
""
"Overall this is better than I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is full bodied. Smooth, milky & creamy. The bitterness keeps the the sweetness in check and is lasting impression on the finish. Overall pretty drinkable."

"O- Incredibly creamy milk stout that is very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not to demean Guinness in any way, but I'd buy this over it any day of the year. This is one of my new favorite, year-round beers. I'm so glad I tried this."
""
""
"O: one of my favorite stouts...has that roasted taste that you would expect from a stout but adds just enough sweetness to make it interesting"
""
""
"Poured a 1""" pale mocha head. Body is burnt umber brown but still dark as coffee. Smell is very mildly malt. Taste is actually even milder on malt than the smell, and there's really not much else going on besides malt. Body is medium leaning towards light. All in all I think this is just a mainstream cream stout and quite forgettable."

"O: Pretty much the opposite expirience of all my SA Brews. Real nice mouthfeel, A. Taste is off and smell is overwhelming. One dimensional brew. I think its just that I dont like the style, I am lactose intolerant afterall. If you like cream stouts try this."

"O-Pretty good. Definitely worth the price. Not the best of its kind by any means but definitely worth the try. I could easily see myself getting this one again."

"Overall this is a really good beer. If I didn't have Duck Rabbit milk stout available locally this would be a go-to beer for me."

"Good mouthfeel that’s just a touch sticky and creamy, medium body, carbonation on the lower end. Could have a bit more depth of flavor. Perhaps a little watery. Increased creaminess and fullness of body would really put this beer over the top. Not great, but certainly quite good."
"O: Good beer. Might actually make this my go to cream stout."

""
""
""
""

"Settles great on the tongue...easy sipper...I was expecting more cream flavor and I'm glad it is the way it is..."

"O - Good milk stout that I would recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the Dutch, pours a deep brown color, off white head with good retention. Scent of chocolate, roastiness, light bread. Taste has similar notes and leans sweet as expected. Mouth is light to medium bodied but becomes drying after a few. Over a tasty beer for this rainy dreary day."

"Mouthfeel is medium-thin. I'm not getting the sweetness normally associated with a """cream stout", although I enjoy this for what it is: a smooth, drinkable stout. Affordable and quaffable. Two things I appreciate in any beer."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. After it settles, this beer is a deep rich cookie-color of black. The head is thick and fluffy, almost chunky looking like an oatmeal stout. It dissipates to a thin spotty layer and leaves random lacing. The smell is amazing, think Oreo cookies here. The taste is just as appealing as the smell as hints of cookies, sweet cream, bitter chocolate, and roasted malt flavors play alongside each other. There is a slightly watery mouthfeel, making this beer go down way too easily. Overall this beer is delicious. I'm pondering whether or not it would be wise to session this, as it is awfully sweet and just too dessert-like. It's worth drinking again, either way. It's not top-shelf perfect, but easily worth trying if you like sweet stouts."
"In terms of milk stouts this is my second, and I much prefer the Left Hand version, though this is a much more drinkable, easy going version. It’s also not incredibly sweet, though certainly noticeable. Eating it with a piece of semi-sweet chocolate fudge definitely brought it to a whole new level."
"Overall: To round it up this is a excellent example of a stout one of my favorite beers from the SA collection I often have trouble finding this beer"
"Overall- I am bumping the score due to the improvements with warming. If you have this, leave it alone for at least fifteen minutes before you start sipping away. A great mouth feel, and nice cream stout qualities. They could still smooth this out a little more and reduce the roasted quality while bumping the creamer taste."
"NICE, WORTH HAVING!"
"O: I thought this was an average beer. It's drinkable and I think it would be a nice transitional beer for people just breaking away from the lighter stuff. But I was let down by the lack of aroma and flavor. Again, not that I picked up was bad... but they were way too subtle for my taste."
"Overall- I"""m still not adept at explaining exactly what is going on, but this was enjoyable. I could tell immediately that this had a little more substance to it than I have found in other stouts. Slightly warm October day, but this would be great on a chilly night."
"Overall: Decent American stout. Nothing special, but no harm in trying it. I would not characterize this as a sweet stout, as there is apparently no added flavor and it tastes like a regular stout."
"Highly, highly recommended."
"The smell is exceptional and the flavor is creamy but doesn't linger to bitterness. It is a fantastic craft beer and if you are looking for a great cream stout, you simply can't go wrong with this one!"
"Overall - this is the 2nd milk stout I've tried and this one is better than the 1st. This style might not be my favorite I suppose."
"D/O: Very drinkable, once you get going. Easy-drinking and smooth. Possibly keg-worthy. I enjoyed this."
"O- Very drinkable, however it is far too thin and taste is more reminiscent of a Dry Irish Stout than a cream stout. It lacks the nice feeling (creamy / thick / coating) I was expecting."
"O-great, decent priced cream stout available anywhere"
"O: This brew is the shiznit, it doesn't weigh in at much but it makes up for that with its charisma. Shout outs to Ulmer at Greenes for the hookup on this, that kid will look out for good peoples. Killed the sixer as to steady my karma and appease the brew god, Ahura-Malta."
"O: I was really impressed with this beer, Sam Adams did a good job with this one."
"O: As mentioned already, I have some mixed feelings with this beer. It started very well but then for some reason it started to lose some of its qualities found earlier on (with the exception of the smell, which kept improving as the beer went down). Nevertheless, this is a very good dessert beer."
"Overall / Drinkability: Quite tasty - a definite dessert beer. I think this would be a great substitute for a shake with a burger on its own, but I found it a great compliment to chocolate peanut butter cookies and some vanilla cremes. However....the beer I think is actually better when a bit colder than it is warm which I was not expecting. Bitterness gets more pronounced as it warms up, like coffee that has been on the burner too long. Still, a good beer and quite enjoyable."
"Bottle. Pours black with brown highlights. A small tan head. Very good lacing. Aroma was very impressive with a good roasty smell. Dark fermented fruits also come to mind. The flavor is consistent with the smell although less boozy (a good thing.) Rich malt flavor with good sour lactose notes on the finish. Body is medium and to style. Roasty. Low carbonation leaves it a little flat on the finish. Texture is a little lighter than most sweet stouts, but still very acceptable. A good sweet stout. Good job Sam Adams. This is now one of my favorite from SA."
"I should point out the freshness date was close to passing (Sept.2011) so I would think it even better when """new""""
"overall- nice beer that easy to get access to. I liked it but I am a sucker for it..."
"This is a sweeter stout--compare it, for instance, to the motor oil blackness and viscosity of Old Rasputin, and you'll see what I mean--but in my opinion that makes this a more accessible brew. Especially if you're just getting into heavier fare, this is an excellent introduction to what's possible."
"O: Very impressive cream stout! Most of the sam’s adams I have tasted are middle of the road beers – always good but never great. This one will be something I would grab for again."
"O: Really enjoyed the roasted flavors in this beer. Feel on the tongue was a little off but definitely something I would like to drink again."
"Poured almost black with a thick creamy light brown head. The nose was heavily coffee and chocolate with a little hint of some fruit, which I found unusual for a Sam Adams. the drink itself was thin compared to many stouts I've had, but it kept a little of the smoky coffee flavor along with a general sweetness throughout. overall, this was a very pleasant, tasty yet not overbearing drink, a little different from the typical strength of a Samuel Adams."
"O: Great stout in general, and an excellent milk/sweet stout. Not too sweet, perfect balance of flavors. One of the best beers I've had that is readily available at the same price as a Boston Lager."
"O - I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a to say that this is a top example of a milk or sweet stout, but not bad. I'd love to try this from the cask, as the carbonation comes on a little too strong and holds the taste back. All in all, worth the purchase though."
"M/O: The beer has a very distinct silky characteristic that makes it very drinkable. This feeling also helps to bring out the rich flavors of roasted coffee and some vanilla. Very balanced interpretation of the style."
"O: Good, widely available brew. A great sweet stout available almost everywhere."
"Overall – The beer had a very nice well balanced taste and I could actually see myself drinking a few of these in a sitting. It would also work really well as an after dinner beer. I'd buy it again and it's worth seeking out."
"The sugariness presents itself most in the mouthfeel. It feels very full and sticky. Quite sticky. So sticky in fact, that it's my least favourite thing about this beer. However, if that's what it takes to give it the full heavy body it has, it's worth it. This is the heaviest beer I've had in quite a while, possibly ever. And I like that."
"Overall - an enjoyable stout. I know aroma may not seem too important to some but it does make a significant difference, in my opinion. Anyways, if you're looking for a sweet stout this is a good place to start."
"I love a creamy stout and while this brew had a noticeable creamy mouth feel I belive a there was room for a little more. I thought the flavor was standard - nothing overpowered and nothing stood out - it was not however lacking flavor so if you wanted a normal cream stout without the coffee or chocolate or caramel yelling at you this would be the beer."
"Poured a dark brown-black with no light coming thru, nice tan head with decent retention and good lacing.Smells of roasted almost burnt malts, nutty coffee, slight hop smell as well. Taste followed smell with more of the coffee standing out. Nice bold balanced taste. Mouthfeel was not like a cream stout, a little thin and not silky or creamy as some. Overall not a bad offering from SA and worthy of try."
"This beer pours out as a deep brown color, with a brown colored head. The retention isn't all the great. The smell is highly roasted with some hops in the mix. The taste is quite strong actually, surprising. There is a really strong roasted flavor that's very bitter. I don't get a whole lot of lactos in it. The mouthfeel is a little bitey and dry. Overall the brew is decent. Not the best stout out there but different enough to be interesting."
"O: Pretty good. 3.5"
"O: All in all, this is not really anything special. Don't bother to try unless you like Sam Adams brews. Not a good example of a stout."
"Overall, this is a pretty good effort for BBC, and when $$$ is tight, I will go with this again, but when I've got the couple of extra bucks in my pocket, I'll get the upgrade."
"This beer is EXACTLY as it should be. Poured it out a bit """aggressively", so the head was larger than normal, but was tan and foamy as it would need to be. Lacing stuck to the glass very well. The smell is that of coffee, and the tastes that come through are coffee and chocolate, though that is mostly from the cream flavor. It is a very thick, very dark, slightly sweet and creamy stout. Absolutely fantastic."
"D- Sits somewhat heavy. I could put down a few for sure, but I'd definitely have to pace myself. Again, nothing but the expected standard with a beer of this category."
"O- awesome. It was love at first sight, and the feeling has not faded over the years."
"This was one of our clubs beers for April so I didn't choose it, but I am glad it was selected. It is very easy drinking and also reasonably priced."
"Definitely a good session beer. Cheers!"
"Overall: Good beer, easy drinkability, balanced flavors, nothing really overpowering. This is a good beer that really reminded me that beers don't need to be overly hopped or have an intense coffee or bourbon flavors to be pleasurable."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a tan head. In the aroma, sweet lactose and a roasty malt. In the taste, small roasty coffee, small sweet lactose, sweetness mellows at the end. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to sweet roast in the aftertaste. Nice and mellow, not overly sweet."
"A nice dark black with a very creamy head that recedes slowly and leaves beautiful lace. Smells of dark chocolate and whiffs of coffee. The taste follows. Bitter chocolate in the front and coffee in the back. A nice cream in the middle with a touch of vanilla. Some earthy tones throughout. Very simple and nice. Nice creamy body and easy, mellow to drink."
"A nice beer for this style. Not too much sweetness or chocolate (a plus for me), and has a good overall flavor. Not something I'd normally pick up in a 6-pack, but thought I'd give it a shot and I'm enjoying it."
"Well done, Sam Adams. This is by far my favorite of yours. A wonderful cream stout specimen, cheers."
"Nearly perfect black, just some light is noticeable when held to it. Thick mocha brown head, pillowy and very thick. Smell is of milk chocolate, coffee grounds, graininess, roasted barley. Taste is a good combo of initial cocoa, moving to blackened grains and finishing on a bittersweet chocolate and a English hops note. More noticeable hops, could've done with a little less. Still, dark, roasty and pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is increidble, full bodied, very smooth, less silken, more like well broken in cotton, just a little roughness for texture. Great feeling beer, one of the best stout MFs I've had in a while."
"Before you compare this to some intense 10 percent Imperial Stout keep in mind this only 4.9 percent alcohol and they are still achieving an amazing full bodied stout. This is Samuel Adams best kept secret most underrated beer they have in my opinion. This one should get more recognition!"
"Finish: Sweet malts, hints of coffee, small amount of a milk chocolate, but it all dissipates quickly"
"D) A delicious stout. I would definitely have another!"
"Poured into a Guinness tulip pint on St Patty's Day with a big, booming, thick, puffy head that slowly reduces to lacing. Very nice. The smell is nice and sweet with roasted malts and chocolate with earthy flavors mingled in. The body is moderate which helps in downing this very pleasantly drinkable well-balanced beer. I would love to find this on tap."
"Coats the palate very well. Nice and creamy. Chocolate hits first followed by a rich malty roastiness. Well rounded and very easy to drink. This stout is one of the best offerings I've had from Sam Adams in a while."
"Overall, this is a delicious stout, and drinkability is high when you consider the flavor that this one packs in at under 5% ABV. I could easily go through several of these in a night."
"The mouthfeel is fairly smooth at first, but towards the end of the sip some prickly carbonation roars it's head. It all works though, this just feels great going down. The drinkability is fairly good, this drinks much stronger than the sub-5% that is is though. A good, inexpensive, widely distributed stout."
"Review #1350. Nothing really important about that number, I just had nothing else to say as a lead-in this time. *sigh* It pours a dark ruby-brown topped by nearly a finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises lightly-roasted malts, walnuts, cocoa powder, and black pepper. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, kinda bitter dark chocolate, light vanilla, and the lightest possible smidge of Irish cream. The body is a sleek medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a pretty solid stout, nothing too amazing, but pretty tasty anyway."
"D - Overall a tasty stout but would've liked if it were a bit sweeter. Perhaps an increase in the ABV would've contributed the sweetness I was looking for. Definitely worth a try, but don't expect to be blown away."
"Poured dark brown with a large creamy light brown head that lasted throughout and had excellent lacing. The aroma was quite light of roasted dark chocolate malts, and earthy yeast with notes of coffee and caramel. It tasted very lightly sweet with a mild coffee undertone and had a hint of caramel at first then became mildly bitter with notes of chocolate and coffee at the end. Mouthfeel was medium in body and creamy in texture with a flat carbonation. Overall an OK stout that was extremely drinkable."
"Excellent beer. Nicely done. I prefer the bolder flavor and body of Imperial Stouts, but this is a nice alternative in a standard stout format."
"D - a delicious stout that has the roasty and creamy characteristics of a milk stout with a great strong blend of roasty and chocolate malt flavours, very sessionable"
"I think this beer is delicious, and at 4.9% abv, it would be easy for most beer lovers to go through a few pints. Highly recommended, perhaps a replacement for Guinness Extra Stout, it has the same great taste and creaminess with less alcohol, making it more drinkable for me."
"Overall: I confess, I'm not a fan of these lactose-free milk stouts - the sweetness and creaminess just can't be achieved any other way. That being said, this is a decent representation of the style."
"This one is lighter-bodied, but nonetheless a tasty and worthy drink."
"Cheers!!!"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - I finished this off in no time. A very easy-going and low alcoholic stout. A little dry at parts. It was very average and I don't look forward to having it again."
"This is a very nice stout, the creaminess is what makes it."
"M/D: Creamy and lively. It's creamy without reminding me of cream in my coffee. Light ABV makes it go down easy and if I were more of stout guy, I could put these away."
"Flavor wise there is a little more roastyness, but not much coffee or chocolate. It has a subtle sweetness to it that I don't really enjoy with the oats. Not exceptionally sweet or thick and creamy as the name would suggest. This beer is on the watery side for a stout, its very drinkable, but just not very creamy and viscous, really lacking in the flavor department too. I almost want to call this an oatmeal stout."
"Pours a very dark brown and leaves a fingers worth of light cream colored head. The nose is pretty impressive and bings notes of coffee, chocolate, and sweet roasty malts. The taste follows suite with a great callaboration of flavors. This Sam Adams offering has a decent coating mouthfeel but is a bit on the thin side. This stout is very drinkable because of a very low alcohol presence."
"This beer started out so promising with it's appearance but like they say don't judge a book by its cover, or in this case a beer by its pour. Sadly this did not deliver for me. This isn't very complex and the thin mouthfeel doesn't help at all. There are much better options out there."
"drinkability is great! I have made this a session beer this winter...SOOOO much better than Guiness...just very satisfying...a VERY well done stout! love it!"
"Appearance is almost pitch black, not completely though, hue of red in there. Nice two finger head, a little soapy looking though. I pick up hints of roasted and chocolate malts, along with a hint of coffee on the nose. Wow, taste is pretty damn good, it's very well balanced all the way through the drink. It's a mixture of malts and coffee with the smallest hop bite, I mean small. For sure not as creamy as a nitro beer, or an oatmeal stout, but still very creamy, surprisingly creamy. Mouthfeel is awesome and drinkability is very good, I could drink 3 or 4 of these easy."
"This is a pretty """light""" stout, but with a descent flavor and just under 5% abv, it is most drinkable without being a gut grenade."
"D- look, it's Sam so is sessionable. I just think that this is even a good gateway brew. There are so many flavors and it's completely unique. Best Sam Adams grade I will ever give out"
"Beer is medium bodied and pretty mild all around. There isn't much flavor in this one. The roastiness / bitterness from the malt should be in the back of the palate but I find it wanting. There is a minimal sweetness in this beer but overall it's like mildly flavored heavy water. Oh well."
"Highly drinkable."
"D-Easy brew to put down all night, overall a fantastic beer"
"This beer poured a black color, with a small creamy head tan that lasted throughout the beer. Had a creamy smelly, but wasnt very strong. The taste had an inital bite, and was malty. Nice amount of carbonation, and wasnt too heavy. Overall a really nice beer, would get this one again."
"Overall it didn't blow me away, but Sam Adams played it safe and created a very nice run of the mill cream stout, nothing to complain about and nothing to rave about."
"D - not as dry as a lot of stouts, thus making it more drinkable in my opinion. I was very pleased with this beer."
"D - This beer has good drinkability. It is very smooth and easy to drink. I could easily drink a lot of these. I would buy this beer again."
"The beer pours a black color with a tan head. The aroma is coffee and chocolate with some roasted malt mixed in. There is also quite a bit of sugar in the aroma, which may be from lactose which I think is in the beer. The flavor is roasted malt and chocolate and is fairly bitter, though not from the hops. I also get some coffee in the aroma. As the beer warms, I get some sugary notes in the flavor. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very good sweet stout, one of the better ones I have tried."
"D- A nice beer but the after taste and mouthfeel kinda bring it down a notch for me."
"D - Very drinkable stout, I wouldn't be able to drink just one..."
"Very drinkable, I certainly will buy it again and because I liked it so much will try more Samuel Adams beers."
"The nose promises a lot, but the taste doesn't deliver."
"Overall this is the best Sam Adams I've tasted."
"Notes: Good, quality Sam Adams brew. Will definitely purchase again in the future."
"D- This is one of my favorite crean stouts. Perfect as a dessert beer or any occasion. Great beer."
"Poured from a bottle, served in a pint glass. The stout poured with a decent head, dense like most stouts. Typical dark, opaque coloring, the beer had aromas of bitter coffee and cream. The flavor was very good, with hints of oak and coffee balanced with a base of a cream taste. The beer was very light and crisp, as far as stouts go, giving it a poor overall substance for its genre. The taste was impressive, and that helped overcome the lack of body. Very easy to drink, but falls short of other stouts."
"This cream stout is a delight. It pours a dark brown color as the scent of cocoa flows atop the light brown head delivering a firm and long lasting taste of cocoa. A good sipping beer for a cold winter night."
"Smooth mouthfeel and very easy to drink."
"D - Pretty drinkable. Decent overall. Could be better, though."
"Pours a nice caramel brown with a nice creamy tan head, Aroma of toasted caramel malt, sweet spices, with some chocolate and light vanilla. Taste is similar to taste. Palate is nice full body with moderate carbonation, nice creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Finish is sweet toasted caramel malt, some sweet spices end in a lightly bitter chocolatey vanilla aftertaste. Overall a very nice rich and tasty brew."
"D- Pretty good. The toasty/smoky aspect could get old after 3 or 4, but I didnt mind it very much"
"Samuel Adams Cream Stout--Brewmaster's Collection--2010--12 oz. Bottle. 4.90%ABV. 35 IBU's. (2.5 / 5.0) Thin pour. Foamy big thin tan lacy head. Clear dark bronze black color. Mild roasted light chocolate mild hop front. Thin cream hint mildly burnt thin roasted crusty dry Stout toffee cherry body. Dry mild hop spice filling cocoa hint end. Smooth but bland. Sampled 11/19/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $6.99 @ The Ballard Market, Ballard, Seattle on 7/3/2010."
"Pours dark brown with a thick, light brown, long lasting head, and a lot of lacing. Body is medium-full, medium carbonation. Flavor is of some caramel malt, coffee, roasted barley and dry fruit. Finish is medium, bitter-sweet from roasted barley and caramel. Nice, easy drinking stout"
"This beer pours a dark black color, with little light coming through giving it a little bit a dark amber hue. The head is tan in color. The aroma of this beer smells of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts. The taste is bitter and yet balanced. Some stouts have a lingering malt bitterness to them but this isnt bad. The mouthfeel is medium, and feels right on for a stout. I would consider this a drinkable stout."
"Overall, I can't wait to drink more of this, and it's definetly on my radar."
"Great looking and smelling beer not as exciting to taste, but EASILY drinkable."
"Great pour resulting in a two finger head of light brown. Clinging lace with good lasting power. Color is a 37 on the SRM Beer color chart. Almost black, but can be seen through in strong light. Smells like chocolate, black coffee, and Marciano cherries. Has flavors of coffee, chocolate, licorice, and sweet malt. Good sweet finish with just a little tart on the back of the tongue. Wonderful feeling in my mouth, soft palate, and the back of my throat. Good flavor, good price, not too hard to find."
"So all in all, I'm not quite impressed. I'd hoped for a silkier, sweeter beer. I ended up with a somewhat thin stout that doesn't stand out."
"D - If you like the taste, it's a very easy beer to drink. Goes down without a fight. Due to the full taste and feel of the beer, I'm not sure you could drink a whole bunch of these. It's more of a dessert. One or two of these and you'll be full and satisfied."
"Overall, certainly a serviceable sweet stout, creamy and drinkable, if a bit understated in flavor."
"D - I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I liked it, and given the low ABV%, it could make a good holiday drinker for all day celebrations."
"Pours deep brown. Almost black. Aromas of expresso and chocolate are evident. Taste is wonderful and creamy. Smooth coffee flavors with slight hints of chocolate and some cream. Very nice beer for a cool winter night. Great everyday stout. Sam Adams is a class brewery and this one is another product."
"D- tasty low abv never gets boring its always drinkable"
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best before date on bottle is Oct. of this year. Pours an opaque deep, dark brown. Not black though. Inch and a half of creamy head that slowly dissipates. Very good lacing. Cocoa and coffee with cream on the nose. Nothing overwhelming but still nicely balanced. Medium/light body and very smooth mouthfeel. Almost has the texture of a nitro stout. Carbonation is just enough for it to keep its rich texture. Very nice milk chocolate roasted malt on the palate. All this from a highly sessionable beer. Definite winner in my book even though I tend to go for the Russian Imperials. There is a lot to the name of the beer, too. Creamy in the Irish tradition but with a slightly trumped up flavor profile done American style."
"sam adams should be proud of this one. ive had several from different brew dates and theyve all been excellent."
"D - when chilled or sat to a few degrees below room temperature this is an easy brew to finish to the last drop. all the flavors are balanced and complimentary and it is made with care. good stuff"
"Drinkability is good -- I would find it hard to get tired of this pleasant brew. Very mild-mannered and unobnoxious. I felt like Goldilocks: not too much or too little bitterness, not too much or too little sweetness, but just right. So drinkable this one disappeared extremely quickly!"
"Very drinkable, and not too high ABV. This is a good example of stout that is easily available. It is right to the style. It fits in with the rest of the Samuel Adams lineup, as it might not be the best of the style, but it does not disappoint. That said, this is one of Boston Beer Company's better beers."
"Final Notes: A delicious beer to pair with dessert or as an after-dinner treat. I bet it would make a delicious vanilla ice cream float too. One of my favorite Sam Adams beers."
"Recommended, if you're desperate."
"It's not perfect, but this is a great milky stout. I highly recommend."
"by far, not the best cream stout i've ever tasted but this is drinkable. If you do a side by side with this and Leinenkugel's Creamy Dark the creamy dark will win every time, but still a good substitute if the Leiny's isn't around. Dark earthy chocolate notes. Rich creamy head with excellent lacing. Great dark rich aroma. Finish is a little on the earthy/coffee side. I would buy again."
"This fits a different category for me than most of the stouts I drink. I usually find one when I am looking for a decadent, richly flavored, and mouth watering creamy beer. Of which I can really only have one, or two. The Cream Stout though I would pick up when I want roasty refreshment and an easy drinking beer, without the crispness of a pale ale. I would also try it with roast beef, coffee cake, smoked cheeses, or spicy foods."
"D - Begs for another after the first. Relatively low ABV and fantastic balance staves off cloying... you can drink more than one - and truly enjoy responsibly!"
"Overall: Overall the beer is enjoyable. A nice taste of roasted malts stands out in this beer. Not the best cream stout I've ever had, but I would recommend this to any stout drinker to try."
"This is some of Sam Adams' best offerings. Simply has a delicious taste that completely satisfies."
"Nice sweet stout. Great dessert beer."
"Do I like it? It's been my favorite from Sam Adams ever since I discovered it @ 1 1/2 years ago. A Great Winter Beer. but I enjoy it all year around!"
"Poured from the bottle into a goblet. Very dark brown almost black with tan head of about one finger, head sticks around at about a half-finger. Smell is very chocolatey and malty. Taste is fluffy with a chocolate flavor and a minor bitterness on the end. Feel is fluffy and full with a slight dryness. Overall a great drinking beer and one I will come back to again."
"D- Super awesome drinkability. Even in the summer. It's a go to if you're jonesin for a stout."
"All in all if you like stouts with a roasted flavor this would be for you, it is easier to drink than most stouts since it isn't as thick and goes down much easier but when I look for a stout its not something i want to slug back, its a relaxing beer that takes a while to drink."
"D- Very easy drinking. It goes down smooth, and at under 5% ABV, it's easy to have a couple of them."
"I expected more from Sam Adams..."
"overall i was not impressed with this beer, but i am still a fan of Sam Adams and applaud them for their efforts. The flavor was not quite up to par with what i like but it was still a great beer."
"i poured it in to a pint glass, it had a nice dark, almost black body with a dark brown head, which dissapeared rather quickly. Nice aroma of chocolate and malts. The taste is very nice, the chocolate hits on the back of the tongue followed by a little of the hops. It has a heavy mouth feel, but a good one. If you like dark beers this is one to try. I'm not a big fan of dark beers but i like this one and will try other to get my pallet to taste it."
"My favorite of the Sam Adams beer line. Many ask how I can drink a dark beer. The chocolate and Carmel mixed with hops makes it what it is. No doubt about it, this a man's beer. Only bad thing about this beer is its cost. 8.99 for a 6 pack. Although I did find a discount for a 12 pack for 10.88, still a great beer"
"D: Not my favorite stout, but definitely a solid beer. It's very easy to drink, although not too complex or strong in flavor. I will definitely seek out more examples of this style in the future."
"Drinkability - This is a beer that I've come to time after time after a long night of work. It's a great desert beer I'll have at night instead of a cup of coffee. Not something that you can really sit back and enjoy a few of. But definitely a beer that will leave you craving for more."
"D- rich, liquid bread. A definite repeat."
"D- Absolutely one of my favorite beers. Just a well done and easy drinking stout. Sensational."
"D- drinkable, but could be so much better. If the body was just more there, I'd be able to drink this like water...unfortunately, I'll be drinking it in place of water because thats what it feels like. Sucks."
"D - Easy drinker, but not quite as easy as it should be for the ABV."
"D: Goes down easy. Although it might be a good session beer to some, I would only be good for a couple due to the constant coffee & sweetness. This brew is well worth a try."
"Overall a good stout. Kind of forgettable, but still a solid effort."
"Poured from a bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The cream stout appears a dark brown color with some dark redness about it along the edges. Fluffy tanned head appears with 2 fingers of foam that retains fairly well. Stringy amount of lace clings along the glassware. Aroma has a nice blend of dark grain seeming like chocolate, some citrus hops blended with some mineral character and some fruity yeast. Taste includes some citrus hop character along with chocolate notes from the dark grain and a bit of the mineral character plays in the back of the flavor as well. Lingering flavor of dark grains like chocolate and a hint of coffee is noted as well. Medium bodied, it has a prickly amount of carbonation. Slight bitterness is left in the mouth tasting of darkly roasted grain. Pretty easy drinking, it has been more than a year since I last had this and it seems even better than before. I would surely drink this again."
"For a good brewery that's quite popular, I feel Sam Adams makes some very fine beers. Creme stout is exceptional, and a top regular offering for this brewer. A very tasty brew indeed. Excellent value."
"Because the flavor and ABV is so light I don't see how a person could not drink three in a few hours. This is a great beer to just chill with, fishing, camping, whatever. Not huge in flavor but it makes up with mouthfeel and the drink."
"Pours with a three-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Color is opaque and black with no highlights. Medium bodied and light-medium carbonation. Nose is light malt. Flavor is roasted chocolate and just a hint of hops. Smooth. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Very drinkable, strong flavor, but not really what I was looking for in a stout. I like big heads that last forever and velvety smoothness, so I was a little let down, still a good beer, though."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts with some notes of chocolate. Tastes like it smell, malts and chocolate with a touch of bitterness. Feels rich and creamy in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Exceptional aromas of caramel, sweet cream, milk chocolate, and vanilla. Carbonation on the low side, and a fairly light mouthfeel for a stout. Malts upfront followed by more caramel and a long finish of slightly bitter chocolate and almonds. Doesn't quite live up to the smell, but still very pleasant and highly sessionable."
"12 ounce bottle, best before July 2010. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch tan head. Head retention is good, with a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is caramel malt, chocolate, and some coffee. The brew tastes just like the aroma, but with the addition of a bit of cream and vanilla. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it's smooth and creamy with decent carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, I think this is a very sessionable stout. I also think this is a good all around brew, it's one of my favorite Sam Adams beers. Definitely worth a try if you haven't had it before. I'm surprised it took so long for me to finally review this beer!"
"Overall a great beer that I didn't expect to be that good."
"D - Very good beer. This is the first milk/sweet stout I have had and I will be trying more in the future."
"Good stuff. Can't beat Sam Adam's price. It tastes very similar to much more expensive beers at about half the price. Unfortunately, it also has half the alcohol content, but you could drink these until the cows come home. Try doing that with a heavier content beer."
"D: Easy to quaff, by far one of my top stouts as I seem to have it around a lot. ages well, I can drink a 6 pack way too easy."
"Pours black with an attractive, almost creamy, tan head that settles slowly over the course of several minutes. The aromas are of milk chocolate and dark chocolate, with bitter coffee layers becoming more apparent on the palate. My favorite quality in this beer is weight and texture. It's extremely mouth filling and hefty, yet luxuriously smooth, like a silk-covered sandbag. The feel of it alone will keep me coming back. Finish is long and roasty. A very enjoyable brew."
"I picked this beer up because it had solidified its position in BA's top 100 session beers, but on the basis of this performance I really cannot understand why. It's a pleasant enough brew, but really lacks anything to put it ahead of the pack. To place it in the top 100 beers with an ABV of 5.5% of less seems ridiculous to me, especially considering the quality company it keeps there."
"Worth noting that this is the darkest beer in the Sam Adam's line-up."
"D: Quite accessible. A good starter stout, but not enough complexity for my tastes."
"Drinkability is great. Goes down nice and easy and has a pretty nice flavor to it. A good choice for a session brew. There are more complex and flavorful examples of the style but still not a bad choice. I would definitely have this again."
"D - This is a tasty enough brew that goes down very well. I would pass it up for some better executions of the style but this beer doesn't give you anything to complain about."
"Very nice super dark brown with a nice tan head. Aroma of toasty malt and sweet chocolate, very inviting. Taste doesn't fail. Nice mocha malt flavors. Very nice and creamy with a lot of flavor and texture. Maybe just a little too much carbonation, but its a minor flaw. This a stout to have when you are having more than one. Great flavors and low ABV. One of the best brews from Sam Adams!"
"Overall a great, easy drinking stout. Lots of drinkability and an excellent example of the style."
"This is one of the original stouts I came across when getting in to craft beer. Time to revisit. Samuel Adams Cream Stout pours out a very dark brown color that is only a shade oe two away from being black. Healthy finger of tan heading creeps up after a rigorous pour. Nose is of sweet milk, chocolate, and fresh grains. More of the same comes in from the taste. I may not be doing it justice, but all the complexities within this beer are kept so perfectly in check, it is a wonder how they do it. Mouthfeel is completely moderate. That compared with the low alcohol level places this beer amongst the most drinkable of stouts that I have ever come across. All I can say is wow, this beer is totally exceptional . How I went on such a long hiatus without having this beer I do not know, but having this single bottle has rekindled my interest. Cheers to the world's best example for this style."
"Overall: This is worth a shot. I really believe it's a combination of the 2 most well known Guinness styles. Some people might like this compromise better, I don't. It's still good."
"Drinkability: This is by far my favorite SA brew. It really takes the idea of a sweet stout to the extreme. I can drink these all day."
"Other notes: This guy almost seems like a sweetened, slightly watered porter. Kind of mixed feelings about it -- plenty of other stouts I prefer more, but this is not at all a bad beer. Typical of BBC, a solid entry level sweet stout."
"Drinkability - This is a really foreign style of beer for me but I can't say that I'd drink more than one of these at a time. This seems like something better suited as a food pairing than a standalone. That said the weak drinkability is not because there is anything bad about it, but more of a personal preference and unfamiliarity with the style."
"Notes: Not bad. I think this stout could be better if the flavors mellowed a bit and blended more. However, I like that most of the bitterness comes from black malt and roasted barley. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a milk stout or not. I certainly didn't taste any lactose."
"This is a helluva stout. Nice, not too big, but really one of the better brews (if not the best) from Samuel Adams. Great anytime..."
"D: I enjoy a good milk stout, but this one was not quite as sweet as I generally expect for the style. Still, some decent flavors and perhaps a good introduction to the style for people that aren't familiar with it."
"Drinkability: Cream Stout is nice and smooth. At first taste it was close to epitomizing the style for me, but it lost a lot of character as it warmed."
"SkÅL!"
"the drinkability is good. I'm giving it a 5 here... it's a good beer."
"D: ABV is around average to below average, so this one can be sessioned. Since it's not as heavy as it might seem, that also helps it's drinkability. Though, if I want a good sturdy stout, I'd probably reach for a RIS such as Rasputin. All in all, a decent interpretation, and sticks close to style."
"I like this beer, solid taste, not too chocolate, but a nice taste of it. Nice foam, sort of creamy, I could put a few of these back for sure. Not overly thick, outside of the chocolate I am having a hard time tasting much else, slight aftertaste is there but nothing major. Good after dinner beer or winter beer for sure, not sure why it is in the spring mix pack but still a good choice all the same. It gets my endorsement."
"Pours dark brown and ends up black in the glass wth brown-red edges. Capped with a thick layer of dark tan foam with high retention and a middling amount of lace evident. Aroma has raisin and a mild nutty sweetness to it and a spot of roast. Aroma is fine but restrained. The flavor has a pleasant nutty and fruity sweetness to it that is nicely tempered with a present but not burnt roastiness. Great balance between sweetness and roast, never is overly sweet or roasted. Feels smooth and soft though a touch on the lighter side though luckily with low-moderate carbonation. Very drinkable stout and avoids the problem of an overly sweet cream stout. Very nice, one of the top five Sam Adams releases."
"Light to medium bodied, soft and rounded and creamy. Mild in flavor, but makes up for it in mouthfeel and drinkability. Short, quick finish makes it very sessionable."
"D: Very easy to drink, and low abv. Good for a pitcher of this stuff for sure. Not an amazing stout, and I've had better, but its certainly quality and a pleasure to drink."
"D: A really tasty milk stout that I could stick with for a long time and be happy. Easy to drink... would make an excellent session ale."
"Good drinkability - easy drinking and flavorful. Nicely done."
"I wasn't quite sure what to think about this beer. It's very, very good, but not entirely unique. I can't penalize it for being good despite this, so I gave it a high rating. It's definately not disappointing, but I don't know what to say about it that would set it apart from others of this style. I really love the dark chocolate flavor, though. Definately try this if you haven't done so."
"Pours black with a brown translucency. Thick, billowy off-white head. Smell is outstanding - very food-like, toasty and nutty, yet light at the same time. First taste is upfront and bitter, a bit thin with a slight metallic bent. Mouthfeel is suitable though, with a pleasant cottony finish. Nuttiness shows up again at the very end. Very good."
"I poured this from a 12oz bottle into a glass. The head had decent retention. I like the full gamet of qualities in this beer. I would love to try it on tap, as I find stouts especially to be superior on tap. Mouth feel for this beer is better than most I have tried. I got this one in a Sam's variety pack and have been enjoying all of them thus far."
"Nothing special from this stout. I was expecting more but the beer is mediocre at best. If it's the only stout available I'll drink it. The head was nice and thick thick and slow to dissipate. The initial smell after the poor left me without emotion or anticipation. Not overly bitter taste like Guiness, but too thin in body. Not sweet enough finish for a cream stout. This beer left me with an empty feeling."
"OK sweet stout, some hype lead me to believe it would be better. I did enjoy the second bottle more which was served at a warmer temperature."
"D: Smooth. Could have more than one. For an average, non imperial, stout, this is good. Good beginer beer for drinkers looking to have a stout outside of guinness."
"Notes: I wasn't overly impressed by this beer, however the flavors are pretty solid. The only real complaint I have is the smell. It is not appealing at all, however, I didn't get a chance to compare it to another beer because my buddy gave me this out of his mix pack. The flavors are nice, but not super impressive. Like most Sam Adams, it is a solid, approachable, drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is too thin to be a stout. Definately wish there was more to it. Drinkability is good. Smooth balance between sweet maltiness and bitter hops."
"Poured from a bottle to an english pub glass. Poured a coffee black with a thick tight foamy tan head with nice lacing. Hints of roasted barley, chocolate, and a definate coffee note. Has a nice roasted flavor with strong hints fo coffee. Has a slight hop finish. Very well balanced. Medium bodied and very creamy mouthfeel. This is a very tasty stout."
"Drinkability: One of the better low abv Stouts. Easy drinking and flavorful - just great."
"D- Overall a decent brew that didn't live up to standards."
"When poured from the bottle this beer had lots of head, and laced the glass. An extremely dark beer, it had a very roasted taste to it. The mouthfeel was great, it was an extremely creamy beer. It had a definite chocolate/mocha taste to it and yet this wasnt overpowering. Overall a rich and delicious beer."
"Drinkability- Mr. Adams, you may be a macro, but you still make a damn fine beer. The slight sweetness and creaminess make this an incredibly drinkable stout, and at a good price."
"Off initial pour we have a nice foamy tan head. The beer is amazingly clear (which is to be expected from S.A.) for a dark beer. 1st taste and I feel like I am chewing on a nice chocolate and coffee flavored toffee. This is a pretty thick and chunky beer if I say so myself. She is pretty and quite refreshing to the palate, easy to drink, and like a good girl....I mean beer she invites you back for more. The flavor does sort-a change a tad at the end, leaving hints of alcohol fluttering around but dies out quickly. Not the most complex stout that I have had, but I would say it is a great entry beer for someone that might want to adventure over to the """dark side.""" Worth a try, just as any of the Samuel Adams are...."
"Value: I'd say this was the most impressive brew in that mixie 12 pack. For 13 bucks that thing was a steal."
"Overall, I don't think I'd pick up another one of these. The bitter and sour notes had me struggling through the end of mine, and it certainly didn't fulfill the stout craving I've been having the past few days!"
"i wont lie to you guys, i got pretty excited about this beer, when i saw it, but i was highly dissapointed, it smells kind of coffee-ish, and i kind of has a bite to it. has a great head tho, and it also has great lacing as well, i would drink this beer again but only if it was on sale, because i paid 8.99 for a 6 pack haha. i looks really good too, it is a really dark beer. and its pretty good"
"D-this is a very satisfying beer it has a good taste and great balance and could easily be enjoyed through the night"
"D: I could drink a few in a row in the winter and maybe two in a row even in the summer time."
"Beer poured a deep chocolate brown color with a HUGE tan head that took a long time to dissipate. Lots of toasted roasted flavors. Coffee, some cocoa nibs. A bit bitter but too much. Needed less carbonation for me to enjoy. I was getting too much of a coffee soda feeling. Beautiful beer but I would rather drink a different stout."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. The beer wasn't nearly as dark as I expected, I've seen some quality brown ales as dark as this this before. It's dark brown and a deep chestnut brown color when held to the light. What really saved this beer was the lacing in my opinion. It has a thick bubbly head that sticks around and provides generous lacing to it. The smell is good, it has a slight coffee aroma to it but more like a flavored coffee or a coffee with cream and/or sugar added to it, as opposed just straight brewed black coffee. Pretty well malted and believe it or not a subtle hop smell. The taste is good, sweet toasted malts with a coffee and unsweetened chocolate. Slight bitter aftertaste from both hops and coffee, tastes pretty nice overall. Mouthfeel is good, but not quite as creamy as I expected for a """cream stout.""" Still it's not bad, decent carbonation and overall it's closer to the full bodied end than anything else, at worst a heavy medium with a slight coated bite at the end from the hop. It's incredibly drinkable, went much faster than I expected."
"D - I could have a couple of these, definitely a good candidate for a float as well."
"Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Looks black at first, but holding it up to a light reveals some nice deep purple-browns. Smell is of sweet cocoa, with some caramel and nice bitter coffee. The taste follows, with some bitter coffee and rye bread with a sweet finish. Solid for the style. A little too much carbonation in the mouth, but nice and creamy. Easy going down, and not a heavy cream stout."
"D -- Very nice to cure that Stout craving. Not a dry or oatmeal by any means, but definitely a nice hit of roasted malts and a complex character."
"D - I do not like it. I cannot recommend it. It is not offensively bad, but there will almost always be a better option."
"it's not that this is extremely complex, but it hits on all pistons where it should be. solid, reliable, different enough, very drinkable and sessionable (for sure). pretty much an exceptional stout"
"D - Gulping, not a sipper."
"Poured dark brown with a great creamy head that stuck well to the glass. Smell was woody smoky, charcoal and chocolate too. Taste was light at first, little watery for my liking but finished well, very smoky with some sweet form caramel and chocolate to balance. Very drinkable stout, not bad at all just not spectacular."
"Has a little bite that leads to a dry finish and after taste."
"This is very drinkable, and Im sure people who arent huge fans of stouts would still love this. Probably would be a good stout for beginners. I read on the """Beer float""" post someone made a float out of this, and after you try this, you can imagine just how good, & delicious that would be."
"I love this brew, picked it up on a whim, and I'm so glad I did."
"Not overly complex but a very nice beer. Whats very nice is that this the 1st Sam Adams I've had in a while without a metallic taste."
"Drinkability: Low alcohol, sweet taste. I can't drink too many stouts without getting full but I put back a few of these."
"I have to say, this was a nice surprise and a beer I look forward to having again."
"D: I can only drink one or two of these beers in a sitting. It's a little sweet but keeps you coming back to it. Like other sam adams beers I've tried, it gets better as you drink it down a bit. Definitely a good beer in the morning or late at night, all year long. For some reason, I like to enjoy this one alone rather than in the company of others."
"I poured this beer from a bottle into a pint glass. It had a three finger tan head that is very foamy/frothy and was gone quickly. The beer left minimal lacing in the glass. The color of the beer is black and when held in the light is beet red. The beer smells of roasted malt, chocolate, and maple syrup. The beer tastes of smokey malt and light hops. This beer has a light body. The mouthful is lightly carbonated and foamy. This beer has a nice aroma but falls short on flavor. This is a average cream stout."
"D: this beer is highly drinkable, probably my favorite out of the standard lineup from SA"
"Poured into a pint glass; the color is a dark cola brown with ruby highlights when held up to the light. A small tan head sits atop. The smell really pulled me in...very pleasant roasted malts, milk chocolate, caramel...but not too sweet. Taste smacks of caramel, but light roasty malts make up the backbone. There's some nice soft carbonation to keep the sweetness in check. I think this is a really nicely balanced stout. Maybe it's just my mood right now, but this hits the spot."
"Dr. Easy easy. Wish there was another cold one."
"This beer was a real jekyll and hyde. Initially, it did not smell like much, had an unpleasant aftertaste, and the frothiness was too much. Over time, it started to smell, taste, and feel much better. I will give it another shot someday."
"A good beer for a snowy Winter's night when the budget requires something in the more sane range."
"Yeah, I could drink another. Piece of cake."
"Drinkability: A decent stout and one of Sam Adams' better offerings. I was disappointed to see that they took this one out of the winter mixed pack but glad to see that they still offer it in sixers. Give it a shot!"
"Drinkability: This is an outstanding stout. It's not too sweet, but also not too dry and bitter- this beer has a great balance of both. The body could be a bit thicker, but this is still great."
"Dark, creamy goodness with strong tones of coffee, chocolate, and caramel. This is the Baileys of beer. Sweetness is just right, not overpowering. Rich, semi-thick feel when it goes down. Try this one immediately after vanilla ice cream for a real treat. My favorite offering from Samuel Adams so far, and one that I return to time and time again."
"Drinkability - I would love to have another right now, except that I bought a variety pack, & would also like to try a couple of the others that I yet to try."
"Overall: I would definitely recommend this beer. This is a very solid stout. Another nice offering from the guys at Samuel Adams."
"Overall, this is one of my favorite offerings from the Boston Beer Company. A tasty stout that's a pretty solid looker as well, just needs a little improvement on the mouthfeel. Either way, it's really drinkable and I could definitely see myself drinking two or three of these in a sitting, something I don't normally do with stouts. Good showing, Mr. Koch."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Smooth and drinkable stout. Capable milk stout but far from my favourite."
"Pours a dark color with slight reddish hues and a thick frothy white head. Chocolate and creamy roasty smell, with a light roasted creamy sweetness in the taste. Mouthfeel is, again, very creamy and fairly heavy bodied, with a light carbonation. This is one stout I could drink all day. Absolutely fantastic."
"Hm, I don't think this is a particularly good effort. Didn't they include the Brown Ale previously? That would have been better. Now with this and Coastal Wheat, one-third of this pack is not something I'm thrilled to drink, pending the Noble Pils that I'll try soon. Left Hand or Bell's have done this style way way better, and the cheaper price here won't encourage me to make this a repeat buy. Disappointing."
"D - I may try and find a sixer of this in PA. A nice beer by Samuel Adams that makes up for the Winter Lager."
"While stouts are not my favorite style this appears to be one of the better ones I've had."
"This definitely made a big impression on me. Like drinking a coffee flavored chocolate bar. I'll be in heaven if I ever found a stout that I liked better than this."
"D: Like drinking a beer made with oreo cookies."
"Aroma had mixes of roasted malts, coffee, and cocoa. Poured a dark color, like black coffee, with a thick brown tinted beige head. The taste was a mix of roasted malts, sweet cream and dark cocoa. Overall like a cup of coffee with some cream added to it. Good amount of thickness, could be more thick but I'm not complaining. Not too strong for a """stout.""" Combined with a multitude of flavors, this beer is great for any occasion and could be used ot get others into beer."
"Resulting mouthfeel, gets some points, because its not as harsh after a few sips. Can't recommend this one, its the bottom of the barrel for stouts."
"The beer is a very dark brown with slivers of red at the edges of the glass. The foam was thick and coffee colored. The aroma was blessed with helpings of toffee, coffee, and a bit of cocoa. The flavor was rich with the same essences. Thick in body, but not too heavy on the tongue. It finished with a sweetness I much admired. DEFINITELY a repeat buy."
"[Drinkability]: Pretty drinkable, but I prefer heavier bodied for this style, but still it's pretty good stout."
"This stout is a pleasure. Very round, broad flavors that are gracious in a bold way."
"Good mass production stout. Easy to find and tasty."
"drinkability is great - good flavors and low abv make this stout a year round pickup"
"Pours a dark black color with a beige 2 finger head that lingers as you drink. The smell is roasty with an astringent note from the unmalted barley. There is also a slight smokiness. The taste follows the nose with roasty, Smokey and sweet flavors. The mouthfeel is slightly thin but I like the slightly more assertive carbonation relative to most stouts. The drinkability is good. Not to heavy."
"Overall, not something i'm going to be running back to, but not bad at all."
"Pours a dark black color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of cream, sweet malt, yeast, and slight roasted malt. Fits the style of a Milk / Cream Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with and an average carbonation level. Tastes of cream, roasted malt, slight sweet malt, slight yeast, and slight sugary sweetness. Overall, a decent blend and body."
"This was one of the first craft beers I tried and I remember it being much better, but it's been several years and I guess my tastes have changed. Still, it's a serviceable stout and not bad when it's part of one of the seasonal twelve packs."
"Overall, a nice one from SA."
"An interesting, creamy stout with supreme drinkability. A little thin compared to others of similar capacity such as St. Peters Cream or Lancaster Milk Stout, but really excellent consistency and a perfect session beer."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking. It goes down smooth, and at under 5% ABV, it's easy to have a couple of them. It's also a great beer to introduce people into darker beers with. Obviously it doesn't compare in flavor to a RIS, but it's not supposed to - it's a different style of beer. I haven't had a milk stout in awhile, so after drinking mostly RIS's recently, this kind of beer will taste much more mild, and almost watered down - but it's still a great, enjoyable beer. One of Sam Adams' best."
"Thanks to my buddy cdkrenz for hooking me up with this extremely tasty brew!! I owe ya bud."
"Overall Samuel Adams Cream Stout is pretty much what i expected. It's not going to knock your socks off but thats not what its intended to do. It is an easy drinking smooth stout that is extremely sessionable. I would recommend this to someone thinking of getting into stouts. This one is very drinker friendly."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Note this sample is 5 plus years old. Head disapated rapidly. Black as night, no light shines through when held up to light. OK lacing. On the sweetside tastewise. Strong hints of chocolate. This beer is very smooth and silky. Well done and has kept well too."
"Bought a 6 pack for $8.55 today"
"Very drinkable for a stout. Enjoyable throughout."
"SA Cream Stout is a dark brown in color with a respectable cream colored head. The head faded as I drank to a heavy collar. It's aroma is roasted malt. The taste is roasted coffee, though not sweet at all, more of a mild bitter taste. The mouth feel is thick, full bodied and good carbonation. Drinkability is good as taste not objectionalble and ABV is low. Not bad, but I would have expected a milk/sweet stout to be a little sweet."
"D- Not overly impressed with this brew. I think the cream taste weakens the stout, as well as being a bit watery. I like my stouts thick and strong, so I guess this just isn't the beer for me."
"I am very impressed with this offering from Sam Adams. Very flavorful and complex. A bitter-sweet treat to be savored."
"Prost!"
"Pours a jet black in the glass with a thick tan froth. Aromas of espresso, dark chocolate, charcoal, light earthiness, & roasted malts dominate the nose followed by a flavors of charcoal, cereal, coffee, unsweetened chocolate, & a subtle spicy hop finish. Great mouthfeel and nice lacing. Overall a good beer....would go great with BBQ burgers!"
"D: Very drinkable. Rich flavors, yet balanced. Wasn't sure what to think of the borwn sugar sweetness."
"D - I put this a little low because it is not as full as I would like from a stout. The beer appeals to a larger crowd that probably appreciates the medium body much better than they would if it were heavier. However, I personally like heavy stouts, especially in the colder months."
"Overall a decent beer but i was expecting a bit more.seems more like a porter than a milk stout.good beer but there are much better in this style."
"(D)- A good stout that I think is better fresh considering I remember loving this beer the first time I had it. Has a kinda fake tasting sugar sweetness, but is better than any BMC product out there."
"I say: Avoid."
"Overall, this is an excellent stout. It's only my second Milk/Sweet Stout, but if it's representative of the style, I'd like to try more."
"for a cream stout, i really like this. it's more like a thicker, creamy porter but it's very satisfying."
"Its not fantastic, but for not being a micro brewery, Sam Adams has a great assortment, and this is definitely a notch on the good side."
"D: A very nice sweet stout. Definitely one of the better that I've had."
"Very drinkable. There are better examples of this style, but it's still a solid beer with no glaring defects. Another great Sam Adams product."
"I feel like this beer is playing it safe. Whats there is great, however, things could be pushed closer to the edge to create a really really nice beer, but Sam Adams is in the business of selling to a huge market so you dont typically find them pushing the envelope."
"Very dark brown pour with a medium beige head which collapses into a very rings of lace. Nose is bitterweet chocolate and roasted malt, but not very strong. Initial sip reveals a creamy and rich mouthfeel with just a hint of hops background. Taste echos the nose, and burnt coffee taste comes in at about mid glass. Seems a bit watered down for a stout. Finish is dry and somewhat bitter."
"D: a bit rich to drink by the half dozen, but this beer is really really great nonetheless."
"Good stout, this is one of the first cream stouts I've had and I think they may just be a bit too mild for my taste."
"Drinkability is good, limited only by how much stoutiness you can tolerate. It's only around 4.7% ABV, but the fullness of it will keep you from drinking too fast. Overall, a really lovely brew that I would definitely drink again."
"Extremely smooth feel. Almost like a nitro tap pour. Very drinkable, especially for a stout."
"This brew is very drinkable, tastes smooth and is light enough (not in a bad way) to get a case and enjoy all night. The flavors really shine through."
"D: This is definitely an impressive stout coming out of Sam Adams and I wouldn't hesitate to drink it again. Surely a very welcome surprise from a beer that I honestly didn't expect much from."
"D- Not something to drink all night, but I could sip on a few of them."
"Mouth feel could be more full. This is probably the weakest point of this beer. Pretty drinkable. I am just used to the imperials now!!"
"Overall, this is a nice milk stout, nothing overwhelming, but the aroma stuck out to me, very robust. Flavor is good but becomes slightly bland towards the finish, lacing continues throughout the rest of the beer."
"It's drinkability is impaired by its particular combination of flavours which quickly wears out its welcome. However, this stout would make a fine dessert beer. A solid offering."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Full of flavor up front, but ending quite mildly."
"Notes: overall my favorite stout and probably my favorite beer from sam adams, it's definitely one that i would keep around for a while"
"Overall, this is a decent offering from Sam Adams. Good reasonable stout. Pretty drinkable. My bottle is going fast. I would have this again."
"One of my favorites from Sam Adams and I plan to keep this in my rotation."
" ~ I'm a big fan of most Sam Adams brews and this one is no exception. I'll happily tip these back while recommending my friends do the same."
"Deadly drinkability. Perfectly balanced, creamy feel, and low ABV make for...yes! a perfect session beer. If it was any cheaper around here, I'd drink it all day long."
"D- very drinkable, not overpowering in a sweet sense"
"Sipping this out of the fridge, I am looking forward to this one warming up a bit. Pours black and only a little light gets through the slimmer bottom of my SA perfect pint glass. Good head retenttion and lacing. Aroma is all malt. Bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and nutty toffee with a little smokiness. The flavor does not mirror the aroma as much as in some other beers, with tangy dark, dried fruits (raisins, prunes) coming through, finishing dry and bitter. Carbonation is right where it needs to be, body is medium, and without sweetness, I could easily drink a couple of these."
"drinkability: probably one of the best regular stouts I have ever had."
"What a great relief in the armpit of airports that is known as Atlanta International. I really enjoyed this. I remember this being to much for me when I first tried it years ago. Its amazing how much our tastes change over time. Highly recommended."
"3-3.5 personally not my favorite profile, but this is clearly a competent, sturdy brew--especially considering the abv. might be a good one to have around in case you're having a piece of cheesecake or some fried eggs and the mood strikes... cause the more i have, the more it becomes espresso (with just a touch of cream)."
"Perhaps the best stout brewed in 2009. I was blown away by this brew. I have long been a fan of the original stout Guinness Extra Stout and the ubiquitous draft Guinness stout available everywhere, but this is the absolute best Sam Adams brew I have sampled to date. The coffee notes are predominate along with carob and chocolate but there are other flavors apparent including caramel and vanilla(rare in a stout). The head is rich and creamy with a perfect balance of malt and hops. It has a nice bitterness and a complexity of flavors that rivals and actually surpasses Guiness draft. This is an eminately drinkable seasonal brew(best between November and March in the Northern Hemisphere). For Guinness purists give this one a try you may find you have a new favorite it is that good!"
"this was my first sam adams, it was pretty good, i felt like it tasted like Guinness but with more chocolate tones to it. It was enjoyable but because of the added flavors i think i find this less drinkable than a reg stout would be. Since this i have had some more guinness daught in the can and i wasn't as impressed as i had been in the past, but at the time of drinking i felt i would rather stick to guinness than drink this. perhaps i'll revisit this one day when i've had more stouts to compare with"
"Comments: I usually don't like stouts much, so I was wary when recommended this. Definitely worth a try though, even if you don't fancy bitter. It's extremely balanced, more tasteful than a Guinness, and almost dangerously drinkable."
"Drinkable, but it is a result its low ABV and some watery body in places."
"Verdict: Samuel Adams' Cream Stout, like most Samuel Adams offerings, is a solid and tasty enough rendition of it's style. It's not a world-shaker by any means, but it's a very likable brew, and I'll be looking forward to it in future Sam Adams mixed packs."
"I enjoy the Cream Stout and it's probably the Samuel Adams variety I purchase most often. That being said, it's a solid, second or third choice, as I would probably take a Young's Double Chocolate or a St. Peter's Cream Stout over SA, simply because those two examples have pair the same flavors with a much more lush, creamy mouthfeel. Nonetheless, SA Cream Stout is a delicious, cheaper, and more readily available alternative and one that I would recommend as a good introductory beer for someone looking to get into stouts."
"Overall it's an alright beer, but one of my lesser favorite Sam Adams. Just because of that awkward aftertaste."
"I must really like this one, because it keeps finding its way into my refrigerator at the end of a long day. Though good cold, the aromas really come out as it warms."
"Notes: Outstanding!!! This is a very tasty stout with a nice slick creamy texture that I really enjoyed!!!"
"D- Very session-able and easy to drink. I kind of thought it would be a little sweeter from the ice cream suggestion on the bottle. Overall though, a pretty solid brew."
"Needing only a bit more alcohol, this beer has it all."
"Drinkability: Good. Will try again. I don't know if I would have it with ice cream as they recommend. I don't think it is sweet enough."
"I think my favorite beer of the year, i can say im in love"
"Smooth, smooth suds right here folks. Deee-licious. Definitely one of my favorite SA's brews. If not my favorite."
"D- Highly drinkable for me."
"Drinkability-Flavorful, but not heavy. A great and fulfilling go-to-anytime stout."
"This one is as drinkable as they come and well worth trying."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- In a word, dreamy. The texture, in its sublime perfection, is creamy like a milkshake... unbelievable. This is a dessert beer that I would gladly have another, and then maybe one more... well done."
"One of my favorite beers from Samuel Adams."
"D - This is one of my favorite beers. It was not heavy and had a very nice taste. It very was refreshing."
"really drinkable stout, went down easy and no faulters along the way. excellent"
"Drinkability - Great beer, highly drinkable."
"The taste is similar with a little coffee and chocolate, darkly toasted bread, sweet prunes, some burnt caramel, tending a bit towards a roasty bitterness, esp. in the finish, that dominate the light sweetness. It has some black pepper and maybe molasses but it seems a bit thin in overall character and definitely feel to me."
"The taste is quite good. It doesn't have the charred or charcoaly burntness of say an imperial stout, but more a deep roasted, toffee, chocolately character that is quite good. The beer is a touch drying on the back side and does have a slighly smokey, maybe oaky taste in there as well. There are some bittering hops that keeps the beer in check and prevents it from getting too far into the chocolate milkshake realm. The hops are well blended, maybe a touch leafy, and nicely complementary to the combination of malts. The beer does have a slight butterscotch aftertaste along with some roasted chocolates. The mouthfeel is a tad oily, but the aftertaste is pretty slight. This is a full bodied beer and surprisingly mild at only 4.69 ABV, which I thought would have been higher. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Notes: A pleasant surprise and one of my favorite from Sam Adams."
"Drink ability: To sum it up, very drinkable, yet complex beer. I highly enjoyed this one and buy it often."
"Drinkability & Notes: This beer is very easy to drink, and I buy it very often. It is readily available in my area, which makes up for the lack of other stouts. Besides a botched pour, this was still a great brew, and a stout to introduce non stout drinkers too."
"D - I just love this stuff, so it gets top ranks here from me. Not heavy, delicious, low alcohol. Not complex. All winners for a highly drinkable beer."
"Overall, this is one of the best beers that Sam Adams offers, in my opinion. A great offering from often underappreciated brewery."
"I really liked this beer. The rich brown color the smooth feel, and the flavor make this beer a great after dinner drink."
"D: Really goes down easy, and I could keep drinking them if I wanted too. I love the big stouts (KBS especially) and the sweet stouts haven't always done it for me, but I like this one."
"Picked up a 12 pack sampler of Sam Adams Winter Beers on the super cheap....so sample away I will and decide if I should go purchase more."
"D - Very smooth and drinkable stout."
"Sam Adams did a great job brewing this one, as it's the only stout I have ever particularly liked. A good stout for people like me that don't like stout. Keep up the good work Sam!"
"What a great beer!"
"D - A good beer, and I'll drink it...it's just that it tastes like any number of other stouts. Not exactly the most distinctive beer out there."
"Overall I probably won't buy this beer again. I will actually probably pour this one out and drink something better. Not because it is really bad but just because I have alot of awesome beers to drink in my fridge."
"D - I would have no trouble going through a few of these throughout the course of the night."
"Out of a bottle this Milk Stout was a nearly opaque black with a full three fingers of sand-paper colored head. The retention was moderate and the lacing, in curtains, was excellent. The aroma was of cream, roasted malt, light chocolate, a touch of spice and hints of coffee. The flavors started bitter and coffee-ish, then went into toasted malt and some creamy sweetness. As it warmed up I tasted more chocolate notes and it left a little coffee-like slick on my tongue at the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation low and the body medium/full. This is not the best Milk Stout available, but it is definitely the best one widely available and it's also one of Sam Adams best offerings. Try it."
"Like most Sam Adams beers it is solid, however, not fantastic. Also like most Sam beers it is light and very drinkable. It is a very solid beer. It's not a superstar however, it is one you won't mind in your starting lineup. One of the better beers out of this specific brewmasters collection."
"D: A very nice example of a cream stout. Given how easy this is to find, anyone who likes the style should give it a try. This makes for a nice end of the night beer given the low alcohol. I will certainly buy this again. Recommended."
"Drinkability: I picked a six pack of this up to have something in the refrigerator to grab when I didn't feel like sitting down and reviewing one of the many semi-rare beer I have been collecting. I had forgotten how solid of a brewery BBC is. Might not revisit this one specifically, but I need to have a six pack of Sam Adams on hand more often."
"Pours an inky black colored body, wit ha good sized head, light brown in color. Has a very malty, and strong coffee aroma to it. Has a light bodied coffee taste. Not too bad, I like the sweet stouts and this one seems to be a good example of the style. I'd buy it again."
"daaaark brown! 3 finger head. taste of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, all to be expected. this is sweet of course, but not overly sickening sweet by any means. This is really creamy and smooth, very easy to drink! this is a good, solid, go to brew! BUT left hand has this one beat..."
"A thick black brown color with a very healthy light brown head and gobs of lacing. The aroma is sharp molasses coffee malt, definitely a bit tart. The flavor is tangy chocolate malt and bitter coffee bean. Smooth and heavy body though drinkable for the style for sure. Somewhat warming but not much alcohol evident. The coffee bitterness dominates the finish with a subtle hint of smoke. Pleasantly carbonated, very agreeable and recommended."
"An overall full bodied stout that is very smooth. I only have the 2 that came with the winter 12 pack but these are definitely worth having around and probably one of the better offerings from SA."
"This is one of my favorite Sam Adams beers and a good bargain when it's on sale."
"D 4.0 - Nice brew for a stout. Well done Sam Adams team. An accessible go to if in need of a stout."
"I almost always find Sam Adams beers to be good examples of styles, but this is the first one that I would say borders on great."
"Overall, an OK beer that continues the string of Sam Adams beers that just don't impress me. They are nice, average beers but none seem to excel in their style or stand out in any way. Mild recommend if easily gotten or borrowed from a friend. For me, one and done unless a try on tap."
"Poured into a Sam Adams pint glass.Pours black with a thick fluffy coffee colored heading. Smell of coffee and sweet molasses is immediate.Also hints of milk chocolate. Taste is very smooth and a kind of watery taste if you catch my drift.Has a dry aftertaste but still very smooth.Lacing all the way down the glass. I had this with a chocolate covered caramel and it tasted great. One of my favorite's from Sam Adams"
"Most of you have probably tried this, but if you haven't, I highly recommend it as one of Sam Adams' best offerings."
"This is an excellent """unwind""" beer or long conversations appropriate."
"overall impression and drinkability are very good. This is one of my favorite stouts, and I like a wide variety of stouts"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, a stout isn't really the type of beer that I would session with, but this would be one of the first ones I would look for if I did."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could easily enjoy a couple of these on any given day. So rich and hardy, filled with flavor, such a dessert! I loved the balance between the sweet & creamy, and the earthy & nutty. This beer is very inviting in both smell & taste. Its very very good, you must try this. Can't really say much else but don't pass this one up. Cheers!"
"This is quality, beautifully balanced stout; a smooth drinker, and drink I will."
"PS-Like the bottle says, it really does taste GREAT as a topping on plain vanilla ice cream. The combo of the stout and vanilla ice cream gives off a cappuccino-like flavor."
"Tastes like bitter chocolate, coffee and - as per its name - cream. Dark and thick, with a nice, sticky head. Smells strangely like a White Russian. Really tasty, but somehow tastes almost as if it isn't really beer. Still a really excellent stout, if perhaps too rich to make a real night of."
"Pours black with dark brown edges. Two fingers of foamy tan head has good retention and leaves some spotty lacing. Smells of coffee, sweet cream, chocolate, roasted malt, and caramel. Tastes of caramel, roasted malt, dark chocolate, sweet cream, and coffee with a touch of vanilla and some bitter hops in the finish. Medium in body, moderate to low in carbonation. Very smooth and silky with a nice sweetness that makes this stout very enjoyable and easy to drink. Sessioning wouldn't be a problem at all with its low alcohol content, good stuff."
"This is my go-to beer. It's the only craft brew that is worth a flip at my HEB. I can sit down and relax while drinking this one...anytime. It's not too heavy but has a creaminess to it. Black coloring...tan head. Lacing all the way down the glass. I even HB'd one that I could match it with. Still waiting on the conditioning. If you were to ask me which beer should be a staple in everyone's fridge...this one. The price is better than other stouts too."
"Very balanced stout and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: I would session this beer like none other. Low abv just like the style, flavors surpass many others like it, and its extremely drinkable. Its on my go to for stouts and a great alternative to SN stout and guiness for me."
"Semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malt dominate the taste, although they are not the only flavors. There is a sweetness here that reminds me of a cappuccino. There is also a slight bitterness which seems to work well with the sweetness of the beer. This beer has a creaminess that I enjoy without excessive carbonation."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a tan head that quickly fades. Moderate lacing. Smells strongly of coffee and chocolate and a little malty. Tastes like creamy chocolatey coffee with a nice malty smoothness. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy and smooth, low carbonation. A tasty brew with a nice blend of flavors and is very smooth and nice to drink."
"D: The smoothness of this brew provides slightly better than avaerage drinkability, but the stale aftertaste would prohibit me from opening a 2nd one."
"D - It was only with the help of having food that I made it through this beer. Just not going for this one."
"Very easy to drink and session."
"Overall its easy, and its not bad.. but its certainly not impressive for a stout, either."
"Mouthfeel is medium and nicely carbonated, and drinkability is great."
"I still to this day think of Genny Cream whenever I hear """Cream Stout", no matter how many excellent cream ales & stouts I've had. Power of suggestion, youth imprinting, who knows? This wonderful beer pours with a blackish body & thick coffee frappe head with good lace retention. A lovely coffee-nut malt aroma & malty chocolate-coffee porter flavor. While thin in body as a stout, this serves up a great porter to my mind, with just enough bitter hops and a slight lemon aftertaste."
"D-Excellent drinkability. I got the winter classics variety 12-pack and drank these two first. I think this is the first of this style I've rated...it was a good introduction."
"D: I could put back a few of these, great session beer for the cold weather and very comforting in the midst of a giant snow storm."
"If I had to give it a taste one description, it would be something like half and half cream mixed with coffee grinds. I get the sweetness up front, and that's nice, but it just leaves me wanting after that. Weak middle, almost watery. Coffee flavor feels watered down, harsh but thin at the same time, so it really doesn't leave with much of an impression. I guess another analogy would be like instant coffee compared to the real thing. To me, this tastes like instant coffee. The end result isn't terrible, and the overall impression leaves me with a slightly favorable taste. I just wish it didn't taper off like it does. It's nice and creamy, very smooth, enough of a hop flavor to make it balanced (even though it doesn't take that much). If it could carry it's flavor through more directly, and have it linger longer than it does, it would be better to me. Instead, it just kind of slides off the palate, and not in a good way. Certainly a sessionable and sweet stout, but probably not something I would seek out again (mine came from the winter mix)."
"D/O: Overall one of the easiest-drinking stouts I've quaffed this year. Having not been impressed with sweet/milk stouts in the past, this was easily the most surprisingly-good offering in the SA Holiday Sampler case. The session-strength ABV and perfect harmony and balance of rich flavors make this eminently drinkable. I'd keep this around all the time if it were available."
"Drinkability: this is one enjoyable cream stout with flavors that hit their mark and a creamy feeling that leaves me wanting another."
"Longneck poured into an American pint - March 2009 notched on the label. Very dark in color - just able to see through when the glass is held up to the light. Good sized, clingy tan head on top. Aroma includes mocha, whipped cream, lightly roasted coffee, snickers bar. Roasted coffee tones to start off along with some milk chocolate. Sweet toffee, caramel, and nouget in the finish, rounded out with mocha cappuccino. Creamy, full feel with smooth carbonation. The flavors in this beer are great, but the heavy feel and sweetness would get in the way of having a number of them for me. A very enjoyable brew for those who enjoy a cup of java in the morning."
"Overall - A good all-around stout that gives a full-bodied, chocolatey statement. Goes well with many occasions including an Irish dinner or a Philly steak bomber."
"I could definitely picture myself pounding a few of these in a night. Good drinkability, not much bad stuff to say about this cream stout, definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability: This beer comes in the holiday packs and I will glady drink it there. It strikes me as a tamer stout, but a decent one. I probably would not go out of my way to get a zix pack of this."
"taste is rendolent of nose. Bitter coffee, light cocoas,malt, brown sugars, light almond flavor, Hesheys chocolate comes through as the beer comes to tem[ extremely light mouthfeel/body.A corporate version of stout. Sorry for a brief review, but not tons going on here."
"Picked up a six pack for $9.00 this past weekend. Poured into a pint glass. Rich brown color. Fairly large head, with good lacing. Smells a ton like chocolate and coffee. Taste was a bit of a disappointment. Got some chocolate flavor, but the coffee seems to have disappeared. Also, it's less thicker than it looks. A bit less body as you start to drink it. I wish it tasted and drank as good as it looked and smelled. Not bad, but didn't convince me to grab another sixer in the immediate future."
"D - It's pretty sweet, but doesn't finish that way, so you could put away a few of these, no problem."
"D - Low in alcohol, but a very filling beer. Easy drinking for a stout but fills me up and doesn't leave me reaching for another."
"D- good beer and would be worth a sixer purchase and even a case but it is very filling."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with ruby highlights. Thin tan head. Smell is of brown sugar. Taste is very chocolaty, a malty beer with a hint of citrus and earth in the finish from the hops. The aftertaste is very sweet, as this type of beer should be. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nice low carbonation. Extremely drinkable, this would be a good session beer. One of Boston Beer Company's best beers IMO."
"It has a dark opaque body. The lace and head are very weak. What little bit of head I had was a deep golden tan color. It has a fresh roasted coffee aroma. The taste is a little bit metallic at first then this beer becomes chocolatier with some fruity esters. The name cream stout I thought was a misnomer because this is one of the more watery stout I have ever tried. I would imagine that would be different on tap."
"Light carbonation but mouth filling flavors make this one very drinkable. You can easily knock these down by the 6-er. Been drinking this for years, and never tire of it. I think it is such an old standby that I actually drink it less than I should. Make his one a habit. A delicious, well made beer."
"D,notes: A full bodied stout without fruitiness. Roasted and grainy."
"Full-bodied, dark chocolate, roasted. Started slightly malty with a slight bitterness in the middle and then a very little hop bitterness at the finish."
"Overall: uneventful"
"D - Very drinkable. Smooth and not overly aggressive. One of my favorites in the winter classic pack."
"Feel is light for a dark beer and is just the right pairing for a good meal."
"mouthfeel is creamy, roasty, bitter and stoutly with good carbonation - quite drinkable!"
"Serving type: Bottle in LAredo TX"
"D- I could drink many of these in one sitting"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is on the lighter side. The carbonation breaks up the body some more. The beer is velvety smooth. I could drink several of these in a session. Very easy to drink and dam tasty. A replacement for the piss poor Guiness I have been drinking."
"Woulnd't be something I'd search of I like my stouts a bit """bigger""""
"(rated Dec 1, 2007)"
"D - this is a pretty easy drinking. Goes down smoothly and is enjoyable throughout. This is a good session stout--not too powerful, but at the same time it is flavorful and enjoyable."
"Other comments: This is a pretty good stout. Not the best in the country, but a good one in a pinch!"
"D-A decent enough beer. It's one of the better from the holiday sampler pack, in my opinion. Enoyable to consume while preparing some holiday gifts."
"Drinkability- Goes down easy, very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is one to cuddle up to on a cold night. Very warming. While not too high in ABV, it is deceptively deceiving. Very nice attempt at a cream/sweet stout."
"D-This is a very drinkable stout. A good choice for the holiday 12 pack."
"S: Really good, smooth, and light on the swallow. A sweet drinking cream stout that was hearty and rich making this a very good try."
"D - enjoyable, the lighter body means I could drink several of these easily"
"D: I have some better go-to stouts, but if this were on sale, I'd pick it up again. I'm definitely in the mood to have another."
"M/D - Not a lot of carbonation which is nice to see, heavy body but not thick. Nice and smooth on the tongue. Very easy to drink and the flavors get more complex the longer you drink it and as it warms up."
"D- Although the ABV is low, this really isn't much of a cream stout. If this was labeled nut brown, I'd be thrilled. Swing and a miss, Sam Adams. Another big let down from the winter craft pack."
"This is a very pleasant experience on a cold winter night. The release date of right around Christmas is perfect for this beer."
"D - Solid milk stout, but far from best of class... A nice addition to the Samuel Adams winter pack... The low ABV is a nice plus which makes this drinkable..."
"With this beer I really like the dark smoky almost chocolate/coffee aroma. It has good head retention and nice lacing. I personally prefer a thicker more viscous mouth feel. (Yes, I like to chew my beer.) This is not a staple item for me but one to keep in mind."
"Notes: I'm a little bit disappointed with this, being an avid coffee drinker/barista. I don't know if I can willingly finish the glass. We'll see though"
"Drinkability - Simply a well-crafted stout. Rich and tasty - perfect for a cold winter's night."
"D- All in all this is a pretty drinkable beer. I usually go for something a bit heavier, but this is a good session beer. Like I said it's one of my wifes favs. and I do drink it with her from time to time. Cheers!"
"Pours deep black, thick head, thick lacing. Smells of malt, not much else. Tastes bready, malty, thick, dry. No roastiness. Unique stout. Palate is creamy, head tastes fabulous. One of the better Samuel Adams brews. Recommended."
"Pours dark brown with a creamy light tan head and some minimal lacing. Smells sweet and creamy, even a bit like fresh milk. There are some vanilla and chocolate notes as well, but the milkiness dominates. Smells dry rather than sweet. The taste is also very dry, and there is a bit of roastiness up front and a bit of ash on the finish. In between is some dry chocolate and milkiness as well as some sustained light bitter roast akin to unsweetened strong coffee with cream.The mouthfeel is dry and slightly mouthcoating. I like the lack of sweetness in this beer. It makes for quite a different interpretation of a milk stout, but one where the creamy lacticness still comes through, and the ash at the end adds some complexity. Nice."
"Carbonation is modest but its still there and I think its just right for this beer."
"A very solid beer from Sam Adams."
"D: Very drinkable, very flavorful, if only it was a bit sturdier in body."
"D: Sweet is the word of choice for this beer. Not the best, not the worst. A worthy effort."
"D: Easy to drink; goes down very smooth. In my opinion a great stout at a nice price. Wish I had more to enjoy."
"D: This is a good one from SA. Not nearly as sweet as some other cream stouts, but rather complex and well balanced. I could drink a few of these."
"Chalky and ashy feel. Kinda thin; smooth enough. A solid stout. NIcely balanced and sweet enough not to punish."
"D- These go down smooth. Nice balance of sweetness and burnt flavor. I definately could enjoy a few of these."
"For a mainstream company, this is a very good brew. Really one of the first stouts I'd tried and really got me into the category. Kudos."
"Not as full-bodied as I like from a milk stout but is smoother than smooth and makes for an easy choice. This is a solid, large-scale sweet stout and every bit the equal, if not the better, of the industry standard (Mackeson). That is somewhat ironic given that the latter is brewed out of the former's Cincinnati location. I'd still take a Bell's Double Cream or a 3F's Moloko Plus over this, but the accessibility factor makes this a welcome addition to my drinking repertoire."
"This is not the kind of beer I would want to drink all night long. The flavors are very forward and complex. My palate would call for relief after a few. However, it is perfect for the style and definitely something I will buy again."
"Quite sessionable due to the relatively low abv."
"It goes down very easily, and I consider it one of the best from Sam Adams."
"full body. good carbonation. i like this beer. another good beer that comes in the holiday pack. will drink again."
"D - I can see relaxing with a few of these on a winters night. It is not overly sweet or heavy, which allows you to have a few."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours into a very pretty beer-jet black with a mountainous head. It has a very sweet smell. There are hints of caramel, coffee and chocolate. The main flavors are chocolate and coffee, both are pleasantly sweet. The beer is very sesionable and easy to drink. Even though the beer is full bodied it has a wonderful creaminess too it. A wonderful beer that I really should have more often."
"Pours with a slight head that quickly subsides away. Beer is dark but not completely opaque, some lightning around the edges. Smell is slightly sweet and acidic. Taste is smooth, milkly almost with lots of light malty sweetness. Notes of dry and acidic tartness. Not terribly coffee like, just dark and sweet, mouthfeel is good, covers entire palate, a very nice brew."
"Tastes of roasted barley with creamy smoothness. Not as sour as most milk stouts nor as bitter as most oatmeal stouts--kind of an inbetweener. Creamy mouth but no ridiculously so (as I was hoping for). More drinkable than heavier stouts."
"It had a deep brown color with a two finger tan head. The aroma of coffee, cream, chocolate and soft and roasted malt. The taste was a bit different, the coffee taste was slightly bitter, the cream taste was slightly soured, and the chocolate came as a hint. I felt that this beer was a bit out of date. I am going to re rate and see if the results are better."
"D - A bit heavy for a session beer, but much more drinkable than a lot of milk/cream stouts on the market. This is a good stout, and the fact that it's readily available and inexpensive is a bonus."
"I really wanted to like this one, but it fell just a bit short. Nice dark brown (to black) in the glass with ruby highlights and a sizable foamy head that disappeared quickly but left a foam edge and lacing. A touch of tart hops along with a subtle smoky roasted malt in the nose; initial taste was similar, with a bit more up-front sweetness. The beer finishes with a bit of annoying alcohol taste that keeps it from being as good as I had hoped."
"Actually a pretty good cream stout and one of the better Sam Adams beers that I've tried next to the Black Lager. Worth a try if you are into milk stout."
"Very drinkable. A nice rendition of the style."
"D: This is a nice session stout. Not the best or most complex take on the style I've had, but quite good when judged on its own merits."
"Drinkability: is high i drank a boat load of these the one night ..very easy to drink"
"Drinkability - This beer has a nice flavor balance overall for my tastes. Next time I'll have to pick up a pack of just the Cream Stout. Very drinkable. So much so that I had to tell myself to slowdown and enjoy this beer. Quite tasty."
"Drinkability is good but I had to get past that strange aroma and first metallic taste to enjoy the rest of it."
"I purchased a case of this based on the reviews I read on BA, glad to say that I was NOT in the least disappointed. I Poured a bottle of this into a glass and watched a nice dark tan head form and hang on for quite a while. The smell of coffee and chocolate is predominant in the smell and the taste strongly echoes this. The burnt chocolate lingers in the finish with a light hint of hops. The creamy feel also lingers especially around the lips. Overall, a very good drinkable beverage. It was good to have the full case to enjoy."
"D - This is the first bad boy that introduced me to Stouts, and I have never looked back. This beer is very flavorable and the price makes it very drinkable"
"taste is chalky, sour malt, bitter and milk chocolate, a touch of caramel, sweetness in the back, ends dry and a little bitter."
"thanksgiving! beer pours a very dark caramel color with an off white head, smell is good caramel with a slight smokey flavor. taste is good, creamy """duh""" caramel flavor, just a really good full rich flavor. drinkability is great too, recommended"
"This poured a black, almost opaque color. Large foamy white head slight lacing. Aroma is roasted malts and chocolate. A lighter bodied stout. Taste is of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. The taste is pretty smooth. The flavors do fade quickly. A very drinkable lighter bodied and flavored stout. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish in clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"D - A heavy beer. Great for the winter holiday meals."
"D: Pretty good, and relatively low %ABV for a somewhat heavy-feeling stout."
"Drinkability - I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting. For some reason, I find this beer to taste better straight from the bottle rather than poured into a glass. I'm a big fan of stouts, and this is one of my favorites."
"A very nice beer, poured into a pint glass with a very dark brown almost black hue, creamy 1 in light tan head that left a good cover,well laced. A strong malty aroma with hints of toffee and chocolate. Nicely balanced with a slightly burnt flavoring. Very little bitterness yet the sweetness was not cloying. A little too much to make a good session beer but I think its a excellent representation of what a stout should be."
"This will definitely be one that I will buy over and over again. This is one of the most balanced beers I have had to date. SA just makes good beer."
"Got this one in the SA Winter Taster Pack, which was one of the best tasters I've had. Boston Beer Company produces consistently solid beer, and these were definitely good examples. This one poured a deep brown with a couple lighter highlights and a smallish tan head. A touch of lacing. A pretty sweet beer, although not spicy like some. Nose and tastes are both smooth and chocolaty, a bit of caramel and roasted malt as well. Works as a dessert beer, although I could probably drink this whenever over a winter. A really tasty solid brew."
"Decidedly balanced, tasty, and drinkable. Great as a dessert beer, a nice sociable brew, or an accompaniment to a meal. A great stout that is accessible and fairly easy to come by, and one that would make a great introduction to stout."
"Very black, chocolate colour with some head out of the bottle. If you hold the drink up to the light, you'll see a bit of red in the colour. The smell is chocolately, with a smoky odour to it. The taste complements the smell: chocolate taste immediately, with a bit of sour aftertaste. Feels very smooth around the mouth; leaves a coffee-like taste. I was very impressed with this cream stout. The cream stout goes really well with a regular cheese pizza. Another good drink from Jim Koch!"
"D: Nice one, Samuel Adams. One of the better offerings and something I hadn't been able to find in singles at home before, sadly. A good beer that is worth picking up again."
"A bit of a disappointment. I figure to drink better stouts this winter."
"Notes: This work of art is so drinkable such a prime example of a winter brew.Cheers"
"Overall, not one of Sam Adams best beers."
"D: This is a bit on the sweeter side to enjoy a few on its own but with some sweet or bitter food would be fine."
"pours a stout-like blackness with a tan fluffy head. Aroma of roasted malts, caramel, coffee and chocolate. Taste is malty with a smooth creamy chocolate mocha aftertaste. Not really heavy, so drinking 3-4 or 5 of these would not be a problem. Carbonation is not too strong, really good lacing as you are drinking."
"3.3/5"
"SA's Cream Stout has a nice fluffy medium body and a low abv that makes it an exceptionally quaffable brew."
"It goes down easy, but it doesn't really taste like anything. Strange for an SA brew (in my opinion anyway). I can't say I totally disliked it, but there just isn't much to really like either. Plus, there are definitely better options for the style."
"Drinkability: Very much so. Low ABV, creamy, great taste."
"This is truly a session stout."
"Drinkability: This is a stout you can always go back to and enjoy, I call this the """smart stout""" because it's not overkilled like alot of other Stouts on the market."
"D-Excellant"
"D: I could definitely see myself quaffing down a few of these at my nearest pub. A very good social beer."
"Overall - A great beer to sit down and enjoy. Nothing I'd drink casually, though. Only something I'd drink if I was in the right mindset to sit back and appreciate its complexity. Very warming. Good stuff! Cheers!"
"D: The chocolate flavors and creamy feel made me want more. This is an easy drinker."
"D - """Hello sir may I have another?""""
"This was part of the Winter sample pack,drank both while doing yard work. Pour was light black if there is such a word with a thin tan head that went down but stuck around a while. Aroma is of dark roasted malt (big suprise there). Where this beer shined was the flavor,just a simple sweet creamy dark roast,very easy to drink, and the mouthfeel was full and creamy. I deem this """pretty good stuff""""
"D - I was very happy with this stout...a definite keeper!"
"Drinkability - This would be even higher if slightly less carbonated, but the taste is fantastic."
"Part of the Winter Sampler pack. Dark brown color with a frothy tan head. Malty aroma. Taste is easy drinking; burnt malt, a little bit sweet and chocolatey with elements of coffee. Finishes very nicely, not at all harsh or bitter. This would be enjoyable year-round."
"wow my first rate on BA and it is a milk stout. i cant believe i like this beer one if my least favorite styles of all. pours a very dark chocolate brown with a quick tan head. with some soapy bubbles on theedges. the aroma is very caramelly with plenty of sweet chocolate and very littel roast. the palate is smooth and creamy as one would thinkg with a more bitter chocolate taste but still some sweetness good finish with a touch of roast."
"D- I obtained this in a winter Sam Adams sampler and it is a great cold weather beer. A little heavy to be a session beer. Would go great with some nice chocolate."
"D: One of BBC's better offerings that I wish was easier to find in 6packs."
"Overall this beer is a solid stout that's certainly worth a try."
"This was not as good as I anticipated, but it's still a decent beer from a very solid brewery."
"Poured into a pint glass. About as dark as can be without being opaque black. Huge puffy tan head that leaves some incredible lattice lace. Aromas of chocolate flavored graham crackers and coffee with creamer. Flavor is much less rich. Ashy chocolate with a little roastiness and a nutty finish. Body is thinnish, finish is short. Really a big letdown after a great appearance and a good aroma."
"Future outlook: Repeat business imminent."
"This was good! And I will drink this over and over as much as it is available!"
"I wanted to absolutely love this beer. The look was good (black with a light tan head). The smell was of roasted coffee and light chocolate. The taste was smooth and creamy coffee and deep biscuity malt. The only problem was mouthfeel. I felt like I was drinking a watered down verion of a really good oatmeal stout. I wanted so much more from this beer. On the other hand it is oh so drinkable. I mean you could easily drink 10 of these with absolutely no problem. I really wish this was about 6.5% with 10 times the body and all the same smells and flavors."
"The only knock on it at all...and its not much of a knock...is that with all this big flavor and richness, one is enough and lasts a while; its a great 'have a beer' beer, not a 'have a few' beer."
"D: this is quite a sessionable stout. low abv, nice flavor, nice balance, and just all around a well crafted beer. it's a little thinner than what i expected but for the most part an all around great stout."
"A very good offering from SA."
"dessert beer? maybe. something i'd have with a rosemary-thyme crusted pot roast with stewed potatoes and carrots? definetly."
"Overall, this was a solid stout and easily sessionable. Great job by the BBC on this one."
"The first out of the Sam Adams Winter Collection. While I've had all these beers before, this will be a current review. Dark brown, almost black color with a tan head and very nice lacing. VERY nice dark/dry chocolate aroma, backed up by hints of mocha, slightly nutty, and sugary sweetness. Taste is dryer than the nose leads you to be believe. The chocolate flavor returns, some bitter roasted malt character, and the slightest hop bitterness towards the finish. Starts off sweet and finishes dry. Very well-balanced, but not overpowering in flavor. Methinks the flavor profile is just right, and any heavier wouldn't be any more enjoyable. Creamy mouthfeel, slightest carbonation, extra smooth. Easy to put back a few of these and would be great on nitro tap. Easily my first or second favorite brew by BBC to date."
"This is a very tasty stout. Sam Adams winter beers are some of my favorites. A bit heavy which limits drinkability somewhat. A fine choice."
"Yep... this is another good one from Sam Adams. I know this may sound strange, but I thought it had an aroma that smelled A LOT like cherries. Ironically, I thought the cherry smell was better than Sam Adams cherry wheat. I got mine from a bottle and poured in to a mug. The taste has just so many levels it almost hard to describe. It's of course smooth and heavy like any good stout should be. It's certainly creamy. But on the back end, its got an almost fizzy and sweet after taste. It almost reminds me of the taste you get when you eat chocolate and then wash it down with a dr pepper. The chocolate reacts with the carbonation in the soda and explodes on the roof of your mouth. That's the best way I can describe this beer. Overall, very good beer. I don't think it's one I could drink a lot of in a sitting though."
"D= great for having with a nice steak also perfect for just sitting back and chillin with a movie :)"
"Cream Stout is a beer I've enjoyed for years. As my palate has grown and my tastes have matured I've discovered bigger, bolder stouts but I continue to enjoy this fine beer and think it is one of Sam's best."
"Medium-to-full bodied but not overly thick, this is a very smooth and creamy beer that has a sweet taste to it. Different malts come out like the coffee and chocolate, but it finishes with a clean and sturdy backbite, all the while maintaining that sweetness. This might be a little mild for some stout fans, but I thought it was perfect to session - a good, somewhat complex taste and it just constantly refreshes you as you drink it."
"The creaminess is the kind that you find in werthers origional."
"D - This is a very drinkable stout. Going to pour another right now!"
"Another one from a Sam Adams mix pack. I thought this one was better than average but nothing too outstanding. Pours a very dark color and looks very appealing. Has some good drinkability to it and a solid mouthfeel but I feel the taste/flavor is lacking a bit. I'll have to go back and try it again."
"D - My favorite Samuel Adam's product to date."
"Another well brewed beer from Samuel Adams. This chocolatey, caramel/coffee stout is well balanced in flavour and richness. I being a stout head vigorously approves of this mixture. Sweet enough for that after dinner brew. Warning: this beer should not be drank in mass quantities, it fills you up fast!"
"A very drinkable cream stout. Has very rich textures but are nicely balanced out."
"Drinkability - This is an amazingly drinkable stout, and while it's not the best sweet stout I've ever had, you have to tip your cap to the folks at Sam Adams. It's impressive that they can brew beer of such quality on such a massive scale."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: I could really knock these back. However, I have had a few milk and sweet stouts that were more drinkable."
"This is an amazingly drinkable stout, and while it's not the best sweet stout I've ever had, you have to tip your cap to the folks at Sam Adams. It's goddamn impressive that they can brew beer of such quality on such a massive scale."
"d - this has been, and continues to be, my favorite from the Sam Adams stable"
"Other thoughts - I'm really starting to believe that Sam Adams is deserving of the title of superior american Mainstream Brewery, they know how to put out a quality brew."
"After having gotten away from Sam Adams brew for a while, for no particular reason, I was served a free sample of the coffee stout on tap at the local pub, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It reminded me how good their brews are, and how much they've done for the beer world. This one pours pitch black and finishes with a dark tan head that stays intact for a bit until it quickly recedes and leaves a diminutive lacing all around the glass. Roasted malts, sweet and dark chocolate and a slight phenolic aroma rise to the nose. Taste is not as creamy as the name would have you think, but it is a bit sweet with a hint of coffee, malts and a negligible hop bitterness in the end. The beer is pretty highly carbonated and has a medium-bodied presence. No big complaints here except that it could have used a bit more substance in the thick and creamy department."
"Pours a very dark brown, nearly black in color. A nice mocha, off white head sits atop the beer. Smells very roasty and dark. Taste is creamy smooth and more of the roast. This is darker and more roasty than I was expecting. Not bad, just different than what I anticipated. There is a slight metallic flavor I'm picking up in the taste as well. Very creamy and smooth in the mouthfeel. Quality, sessionable beer from SA."
"D: Complex, sweet flavors make this stout perfect to go with a dark chocolate dessert."
"D: I could drink this all night. Good blend of sweet cream and bitter espresso. Good balance of malt and hops. Flavorful and not over-carbonated. Works for session, for beer pairing with rich desserts, or as a dessert itself."
"The beer poured black into the pint glass. Against the light a dark copper can be seen. About 1.5""" of foamy head formed. As it went down, a huge amount of nice lacing was left on the glass. Smells of roasted malt and chocolate and very sweet. Tastes strongly of smokey roasted grain with hints of chocolate and maybe some coffee. Also slightly astringent with a metallic aftertaste. I've had this beer before and don't remember the aftertaste. Medium in body and creamy. Would be hard for me to drink more than a few."
"Overall, a very well made stout. Rich & hearty, this is my favorite offering from SA. I do wish they would drop the carbonation though; it would only make this already great beer even better. Definitly one of SA's better brews in general, definitely check it out!"
"To be honest, there are few beers made under the Samuel Adams label that I can say I don't like, and this defiantly NOT one of them. Not only is it a good beer overall, but for a mass produced American beer it shines!"
"Nice drinkability, better milk stouts out there, but this is a great gateway stout"
"5/28/2004. A very dark beer that poured with medium head. Cream? I guess. Tasted a very rich chocolate, malty taste with a bitter aftertaste. The aroma was very nice with some chocolate and coffee. This wouldn't be my everyday choice for me but I liked it. I may give this one another look during the winter."
"Drinkability: One of Boston greatest beers and one perfect stout. I drink this year round and have even used as a marinade."
"Notes: I really should not be having this beer as I am lactose intolerant. This beer did not seem as milky as say a Mackeson,but it was indeed better. It was worth having as I enjoyed it very much despite the risk."
"This brew was a little lighter in color than I am used to in a stout, but had solid stout flavor. It certainly smelled delicious with a sweet malty scent to it. My complaint with some cream stouts is the diacetyl, but this one was sweet without having that buttery flavor. The aftertaste left a little to be desired."
"Used a semi-aggressive pour and got a nice light brown/tan head that was about two and a half fingers thick and was very bubbly. The body of the beer was very dark almost black, and I could only see faint hues of amber on the side of the beer when held up to the light. It has a slight coffee aroma followed by brown sugar, molasses and even some chocolate. It has some nice thick lacing as I swirl it around in the glass. Its very smooth mildly art on the side of your tongue and sweet over all, it has a medium-to-light body and leaves a slight roasted aftertaste in your mouth."
"not my favorite stout, but an easy one to drink with a tasty flavor. recommended as a beer if you like Guinness but not Russian Imperial Stouts."
"Finish is pleasing and this stout is very drinkable."
"D: Not sure how many I could have in a sitting. I don't think it could be a session beer for me, but I could enjoy 2-3 for dessert."
"love this beer, will buy it again soon."
"This was a nice surprise. Many times BBC will brew a flavorful beer which is still """safe""". This one is bold all the way, and one of the best sweet stouts I've had yet."
"Black in color with little to no head after pouring from a bottle. Hints of coffee in the nose. Clean attack with a roasted malt flavor. Smoky flavors and a relatively clean finish considering the flavors swirling around. The mouthfeel is creamy, but not as creamy as the name suggested to me. I typically enjoy any of the Sam Adams Brewmaster's collection but this one was not one of my favorites."
"Drinkability -- A sweet brew. Sweet like a dopplebock, but it doesn't bite you back like you'd hope for. But then I don't know that any milk stout does. It's great for the style, but I wouldn't want more than one, even on a cold night."
"D - Great! This is one of SA's best brews IMO."
"This beer was something I havent had before. It smelled great and tasted good. The mouthfeel was also pretty good. What I liked the most about the cream stout is the after taste. It kinda stayed with me for a little while. If offered this beer again I would definitely drink it."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Traditional appearance of opaque black body with slight translucent ruby red near head. Foamy head which dissipates rather quickly into fine lacing. The smell is quite different than many other stouts I've had in the past as it has a much sweeter smell. The taste is incredible. It's more carbonated than I usually like in a stout, but when mixed with the sweetness it seems to counterbalance one another perfectly- A peppery/carbonated delivery with a sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel carries most of the effect of the carbonation, but still feels a little meatier than most highly carbonated beers. Overall I would have to give Samuel Adams high praise for this one. While I feel as though many of their other beers hang in the shadow of higher quality import beers, their cream stout is a true force to be reckoned with."
"Oil black pour, slight tan head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice lacing around the glass. Milk chocolate aroma with a hint of espresso. Much more pronounced chocolate and bitter coffee taste, plus some roasted malt and even a hint of smoke at the end. Nice carbonation- silky smooth. Very enjoyable"
"very good, i havent had a ton of Sam's offerings but this is probably the second best, if not the best bbc offering ive had"
"Goes down very smooth could drink this all night."
"Good carbonation. Smooth. Taste of toasted chocolate, bread, hops. Hops and malt well balanced. Finished almost a maple syrup? as it warmed. Excellent brew by the guys at Sam Adams."
"This was a tasty brew here. I would definitely revisit the Cream Stout from Sam Adams. I'd love to try it on tap as well. A fine sweet stout if ever I had one."
"Other than that, a good beer. My first stout, and definitely not my last. :D"
"Definitely would drink more of this, I'm drinking this in summer and it's actually easier to drink this than you'd expect from a stout. Would happily purchase sixers and drink this straight up for a while."
"D - Easier to put back than a lot of stouts. Robust, but not overdone on the roasted/blackened malts. Excellent balance."
"I don't know if I would buy this beer again. It is my first sweet stout, so I may just not be a fan of the style."
"sweet flavor that is very mild. there is a bite to it that is also very mild. creamy, medium bodies. very drinkable."
"This is definately one of my favorite brews from Sam Adams. I wouldn't call it a sweet stout, but it is still quite good. It is a near black color with a tan head. The nose has roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and subtle hops. Chocolate covered coffee beans balance well with the dry burnt malts. A thin body also make sme see this as more of a dry stout. A good pub beer and excellent on tap."
"D-Style considered this would not be the 1st stout i reached for but it is very good and easy to drink."
"Sam Adams Cream Stout pours a deep black with an ample light brown head. The aroma is a faint roastiness as well as some caramel. The flavor is sweet upfront, with a bit of roasty astringency and a smooth creaminess. I don't know if its the power of suggestion, but the beer tastes a bit milky. There is a nice bit of chocolate in the finish. Overall this is another solid beer from Sam Adams, but nothing too exciting in my opinion."
"Overall this was a very good stout; somewhat lighter than most, but very refreshing on a warm spring day. I will definitely drink again."
"D- This is a fine beer from Sam Adams and I good drink a few of these in a setting."
"I dig this beer the most. With over 600 reviews, 'nuff said! A Salud!"
"D: This is a decent beer. A little on the sweet side. Couldn't drink too much of this at a given time. Good as an after dinner pint."
"Pours nice and black with a thick tan head. Great smells of coffee, roasted malt,and chocolate blend perfectly together. Did not have a heavy feel like I expected and was easy to drink. Tasted as it smelled with chocolate, coffee, and a bit of hopps and espresso. Overall a good beer."
"Overall, a pretty solid effort for the style. Made a good addition to my breakfast after a 17-hour workday."
"One of my top 3 beers from Sam Adams. I love this beer. Nearly everything you want in a milk stout."
"Drinkability: This is a very enjoyable cream stout. It feels a little more fun to drink than a stout. Almost how great it felt to get a quarter and get a soda from the gas station. The carbonated tingle and the distinct sweet and bitter flavors keep every sip fresh in my mind, and makes me look forward to the next."
"Best enjoyed by 6/2008 notched on the label. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a dark opaque brown with a rocky, inch and a half tan-colored head. Webs of sticking lacing with excellent adherence present during the session. Scents of chocolate and malt, followed by a less intensive lingering coffee-scent. Flavors of roasted malt, milk chocolate and a hint of cream, followed by a slightly bitter finish. Smooth mouthfeel, good consistency without being too full-bodied and a touch of carbonation. very drinkable brew. Extremely sessionable; I've already had four."
"Good beer that my bro turned me on to. Would drink again."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. For a stout it goes down exceptionally easy. It has lots of personality and is nicely complex."
"D: For a stout, this is the most drinkable I've ever had. I could have this thing anytime, any place. Stouts don't make for good session beers, but this one comes as close as any I've had."
"Overall: a nice example of the stle. It's not the best milk stout out there but it is a quality brew that is easy on the pocket."
"Drinkability - this is a good ale, and it is entirely sessionable."
"Taste is also weird: some coffee tones, chocolate notes, and more of a bubbly feel than a smooth, stout-esque consistency. Not sure how to judge this. I don't have many milk/cream stouts, and I didn't much care for this. Didn't seem much different from a porter, actually."
"Pours black with a descent layer of creamy tan head. The nose is tame but pleasant with notes of sweet barley, molasses, coffee, and faint, general fruit character. Tastes of dark roast coffee, dried dark fruits, dates, cherry and drying bitter hops imparting a little citrus towards the end. Finishes with notes of dry cocoa powder and fruity sweetness. Full mouthfeel with a nice weight and a good creamy carbonation. Nice addition to the winter sampler."
"Using a slow pour the beer develops two fingers of a nice brown sugar colored head. Beer is opaque, with excellent lacing throughout the duration of the beer. Smells of roasted malt, with a rich dark chocolate undertone. Taste was about the same, malts, a bit of bitterness at the end. Overall, a very smooth beer, creamy, but not real heavy. Carbonation is pretty light. Drinkability is excellent, I could easily drink a few of these since it's a relatively low ABV. Definite recommendation."
"Paired with a nice cheesecake or after-dinner cigar, and you'd be pretty happy. This is certainly good enough for me to consider putting on tap next fall. I'd compare it with Berkshire's Coffeehouse."
"Overall, this stout's dark appearance hides a pearl of creamy, fruity sweetness."
"Pours mostly black with a nice medium sized lasting head. Smell is roasty malt, and sweet cream. Taste is nicely medium to dark roasty malt, semi creamy milkiness and the body is nice and neither thin nor thick. Pleasant creamy roasty hazlenut like taste with soft carbonation and extremely mild bitterness that is hardly there at all. No harsh or strong burnt tastes either and it makes this a delicious and friendly beer. Thanks Greg!"
"Its a good beer overall, but nothing spectacular. If you see it, try it but dont go out of your way for it. Not a session beer as most stouts are not but I would drink more than one."
"A good choice for the winter drinking or with a chocolate dessert. A decent example of this style."
"Sam Adams Cream Stout is a fantastic tasting beer, and the Sam Adams name definitely lives up to its reputation of being one of the best domestic beers with this selection."
"Mmm, this is a tasty brew. The beer poured with a deep black body and a huge light brown head. It has lots of rich roasted malt and strident grain with hints of chocolate. It also featured a good deal of English hops that kept the beer well balanced. SA has a very good beer here. I'd get it again."
"Pretty good ale."
"There's no reason to make excuses for having this beer at the top of your list of favorites in my humble opinion."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Body is full, but I feel that it missing something, not sure what though. Perhaps its the carbonation, and even though it is low I think that it takes away from the would be otherwise velvety body. This is a beer that I'd not be opposed to buying again, I'm not sure how this is sold, but I don't think that is in sixers....don't quote me on that though. I don't buy or drink alot of Sam Adams beers, I acquired this one through a friend. I think that I'd rather explore more of this style before coming back to it though. Definitely a good beer though, don't pass this one up."
"Notes: This is one of the better """Brewmaster Collection""" brews I've had from SA. I wish it had better bar distribution as it would make a great alternative to the usual dry stout triumvirate of Guinness/Murphy's/Beamish on offer at most places."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, very creamy and smooth. It's carbonated very well and is extremely drinkable. Its tame ABV adds to its drinkability. Overall, this is a very fine beer. Perhaps Samuel Adams at its finest."
"Drinkability - Disappointing to say the least. I was looking forward to a good Sam Adams brew. If you're looking for a stout to keep in your fridge to hit up a few times a week, there are better options. St. Peter's cream, Sierra Nevada, Anchor Steam are just a few that provide a better experience in my opinion."
"Drinkability - Pretty happy with this brew overall, think I've found another solid go to for mainstream stouts. SA usually comes through pretty solid and this was no different."
"D - The coffee flavor is strong, but it's a good beer."
"D: It was a rich and creamy brew with lots of chocolate flavor, however its fine malt richness also made it a very one dimensional drink. One and done brew that is best stocked for a winter brew or as an after dinner treat."
"Overall - A very good and well balanced stout... well worth a try..."
"Easy to finish. One of my favorite stouts and probably my favorite Sam Adams product (and there are some good ones)."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A good example of the style, but not top notch. I would gladly purchase this if the fore-mentioned were not available."
"Taste: Nice roasted coffee introduction, that quickly mellows out into a thick and creamy chocolate character. Finishes with more roasted malt, and a hint of dark breads."
"This cream stout has a nice dark color and a rich foamy head which doesn't last real long. The smell and the taste are both of coffee and chocolate with a creamy taste. There is a medium mouthfeel which is good, but nothing special. I find this to be a nice drinkable beer."
"M/D: i could swallow tis beer all day, enough said"
"Smell: unsweetened chocolate, roasted malts, coffee + cream, smoked breakfast meats (canadian? bacon). Taste: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel. The medium-sweet malt is balanced by a nice earthy hop bite. Mouthfeel: light-medium bodied with a super slick/silky and creamy feel. Incredibly drinkable sweet stout."
"Pretty good, very sessionable."
"D- This, like all milk stouts I have come across has a good drinkability. The flavor is full-but not too strong, the ABV is sessionable, and the mouthfeel isn't too heavy. Overall this is a good,sessionable, milk stout."
"Moderate caramel malts with moderate citrus hops and some cinnamon in the smell. Pours dark brown with a brown head. eTaste is watery with nutty malts preseant. Tastes a hell of a lot like Guinness Draught. Quite dry for a sweet stout, but goes down well."
"There is a chocolate mocha taste to this beer which lingers long after a sip. It has a smooth silk feel to the tongue. It is is dark as night color. It is an easy beer to drink and one well worth keeping on hand for special occasions like getting off from work."
"Pours black as midnight with 1.5 finger beige head. Good head retention with some lacing. Outstanding looking beer. Roasted coffee smell with hint of chocolate. Taste is great with roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel, and touch of hops to round it out. Only drawback is what I perceive as lack of thickness and over carbonation. Mouthfeel aside this is still one of my favorite beers and ease of drinkability allows me to enjoy several in one sitting."
"Great mouthfeel, this beer is truly smooth and goes down easy. Fantastic beer, if you can get it, try it."
"D--Very drinkable. I could drink these all night and not get tired. Makes me wonder why they aren't pushing this line more than some of there other beers. Maybe one of there best styles brewed."
"From a 12 oz bottle I poured this into my Sam Adams glass where it rested a nice black with a tan head and nice lacing. Nose of roasted malts with coffee and chocolate, and some hazelnut. Rich and smooth mouthfeel. Flavor is roasted malts with some light hops. Nice finish, with some bitterness. Really nice brew."
"D- The brew was very rich tasting. There was some time and effort that went into making this."
"D - I find the cream stout to be a very good offering from Sam Adams and has always been one of my favorites from the Boston brewer. It tastes good, looks good, and goes down smooth."
"To recap: easily my favorite Sam Adams brew, and very nice on this unusually cold winter day in Georgia!"
"Color is caramel with deep ruby hints displaying a creamy cocoa milkshake head that falls quite quickly from the vigorous pour. Amazing aroma of fresh roasted coffee and dark bittersweet chocolate. Solid taste of espresso, burnt caramel, and toffee. Medium bodied with nice bitterness that surrounds the mouth but leaves little creaminess. This Cream Stout is an impressive representation of the style and a crowning brew in Sam Adams rich and very diverse portfolio: plush, satisfying, and delicious."
"The sweetness and cream parts don't exactly translate in the flavor as well as I was led to believe. Bitter chocolates and coffee beans are still present, but I was expecting something a bit richer and sweeter from this one. It's still a quality brew that's certainly worth a try though."
"I usually drink beer with food. After trying several miserable pairings with food, it's hurting the drinkability score for me. I'm hard on cream/milk stouts. It's not my favorite style, but drank alone, this beer isn't bad."
"D: Although I would prefer a regular stout over a cream version, definitely one to fall back on. A fine brew, indeed."
"D - Definitely, a nice stout for starters."
"Black colored beer with a chocolate and caramel aroma.One of the best beers I've ever seen in a pint glass with a thick foamy head with good staying power.Taste also is of chocolate and caramel and it's as smooth as hell!!I definetly will buy this again and will hide if any of my friends are over!!"
"D: Really liked this and will buy again, hopefully before next years variety pack."
"This is a very good stout, though it seemed more like a dry stout than a cream to me. It tasted a bit like a cigar, which makes me imagine it would go quite good with one."
"Not sure if milk/sweet stout is really the right category, it is really smooth, but could use a more creamy mouthfeel."
"Overall, it's a decent, readily available brew for a cold winter night, but I have a feeling that there are better stouts out there."
"Wow, this a nice Stout and one of the best beers that I've had from Sam Adams. A great taste and low ABV make this a perfect Winter sessioner."
"Go for this is you dig stouts, it's decent, and a particularly good call for cold winter nights (which this is not, and which seem to be rarer and rare lately, don't they?)."
"Don't drink and review."
"Poured out with a huge head that was wicked dark brown but surprisingly laced quickly, almost looking like a frappe at one point. Sharp aromas of malt and chocolate in general with its smell. More caramel/coffee flavors in the taste but its a bit weak and too hoppy near the finish. The moutfeel is a bit watery but it has decent carbonation. Overall, nothing too strong or out there for typical drinkers but I wish it was more spectacular."
"Notes: I love this beer! Not only my stout of choice, but maybe the beer I'd mention in the """What's your favorite Sam Adams?""" adds. And unlike most stouts, not a bad session beer on a cold winter night!"
"The mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied a pleasing aftertaste. Drinkability of this beer is very good. It is definitely worth a try."
"Poured into a a glass. The head quickly disappeared. It appeared kinda syrup like while flowing out of the bottle. The smell was semi sweet, but not too overwhelming. It taste some what of a oatmeal/chocolate stout. More of a heavy feel to it, but not too heavy that you couldn't have 2 or 3."
"The Sam Adams Cream stout pours a nice dark ebony black with a frothy brown milkshake looking head. The smell is of roasted malts and chocolate mocha. Hints of espresso. The taste is incredible, milky smooth with roasted aftertones. The best stout I've had and one to always have in my fridge. This is a perfect winter beer, fire, sweats and a nice cream stout. Excellent."
"Pours a dark ebony with plenty of red hues went put against the light. Nice light brown two finger head forms at the top of pint glass. The aroma was muted -mainly rich malts and some fruity esthers. The taste was slanted towards a choclate, caramel, sweet malt base. However, by the middle roasted malts and charred coffee beans broke through. The finish was rather sweet with some bitterness. Like I said, dry stouts are my cup of tea, but I wouldn't pass this one up if offered. One of SA's best beers."
"True to its namesake, this brew has a creamy and slightly thick consistency along with moderate carbonation for a stout. Slick and somewhat juicy in the finish. Really nice. As I said, probably my first choice from Sam Adams."
"D - A very good beer would be good with dessert or for relaxing they need to make the mix pack bigger for the holidays or I need to buy more next year"
"D = This is a very pleasant stout. I wish it had been a little thicker, but definitely worth drinking again and could certainly be used for session drinking given the ABV."
"Black with a nice pillowy light tan head. Roasty, chocolaty, with a lactose-like sweet smelling aroma. The flavor is a sweet chocolate and mild coffee mix with only a tiny bit of roastiness in there as well giving it a stout feel. Mouthfeel wasn't too thick, making this pretty easy on the palate, and not too hard to drink."
"Definitely worth a try if you're a fan of SA."
"Notes - A nicely done English-style stout. Low in alcohol but with plenty of flavor and character."
"D: Easy drinking for a stout but the sweetness kind of kills it for me. Too much of a good thing."
"D - While this is a bit sweeter than I prefer my stouts and porters, it is a fairly nice beer. I think this would make a better stand alone beer or an after dinner beer due to the flavors and sweetness."
"Pours black with a small tan head with good lacing on the sides and surface. Nose is chocolatey with dark fruit notes and an underlying sweetness. Dark roasted malt in the front with a bit of coffee flavor. Becoming sweeter with some herbal hops. Light lingering bitterness mostly from the roasted malt. Pretty balanced and tastey. Medium mouthfeel and well carbonated. Pretty drinkable. A very solid beer overall and one of my dads favorites."
"I tried this in late December. Its freezing cold outside, and this is a great stout for the season. I was expecting something smooth, light, and sweet, but what I got was a deep, rich, complex, bitter, roasted, and smoky treat that I will definitely search out in the future."
"drinkability - Very good, had this from the winter pack, but is brewed year round. Would purchase this again."
"D: This is a pretty good beer. Could stand to be a tad sweeter, but it makes for good drinking on a cold winter evening."
"Part of the Winter Seasonal Pack. Poured a 12oz bottle into a Smokestack Chalice. Poured a strikingly dark black with a 3 inch billowy head. Head subsided and left an off white film on the top of the beer all the way down. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate and a bit of coffee. Taste is a little weak. There is definitely a bit of chocolate in it but it fades to an astringent taste, almost like overly strong coffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a pretty dry finish. Well, I'm not going to buy a sixer of it but I will drink it if its in the Winter mix again next year."
"Last of the bottle of my winter mixed pack and I think I saved the best for last. Pours dark as night with nice off-white head, almost looks nitro-like with the thick, creamy head. Decent retention and good lacing. Smell has much more of a """dark""" sense to it than some other stouts, a dark coffee and some chocolate. Taste is exceptional. Roasted grains, coffee, chocolate all the flavors you expect to have in a stout and then a touch of cream (as expected by the name). Its subtle, but there is a sweetness to it. Full bodied and thick, leaves a somewhat oily feeling. Overall a terrific beer and I think the highest yet I've rated from Sammy A."
"I have to admit, I've had this brew a bunch of times over the years, and have never given it enough respect. It is a seriously dialed in Milk Stout... Now I have to think about this one.. really pretty nice."
"D: Although I'd like to have more than one of these at a time, my stomach disagrees with that thought. Still, it goes down easily enough and more would definately be an option if eating a meal."
"Poured this beer into a tasting glass. It is a very nice looking beer dark and hearty looking creamy tan head that stands 2 inches in the tasting glass and sticks around for quite a while. The nose is initially coffee and fig notes, then some faint burnt smokiness. The taste of this beer is first a hit of sweet roasted malt and sweetness then a nice subtle hoppy bite to round it out. The mouthfeel is great nice and creamy with the right amount of carbonation. As far as drinkability, I drank 2 over the course of this review, and plan on keeping going. This is truly a great beer, complex and well balanced and indulgently sweet and creamy."
"Nice dark black coffee color and thick foamy tan head. I detect a sweet carmel and coffee aroma and I think I'm picking up a smokey scent as well. Tastes like toasted sweet malty coffee/carmel with a very nice low-carbonation creamy texture. Quite easy to drink. The beer that this beer most reminds me of is Mackeson's XXX. I like this style of beer and this is a very good example."
"Mouthfeel here is not what i was looking for. Feels pretty thin for a regular, let alone a cream stout. Carbonation seems a bit high, as well. Though it has its faults, this is a decent beer. If you like darker beers, pick up the Sam adams winter mixed pack and give this one a try."
"D: This is just another solid offering from Sam Adams, I love their winter seasonals better than their summers."
"Eric"
"How exactly this is a cream stout is beyond me but it's a solid stout with all the usual offerings. Dark character, roasted malt with coffee undertones set in. Taste is full and goes down with a malty finish, nice balance of hops at the end. Slightly thin tasting for a stout which I usually find to be fuller in character. A nice beer though, solid as any stout and a great addition for the winter."
"Overall an easy drinking stout."
"Jet black body with brown tracings of a half-inch head--attractive...toasted vs. roasted--caramel, chocolate and a bit buttery...creamy indeed; lightly carbonated, medium bodied, light alcohol notes...lightly sweet and bitter balance...subtle in character...too subtle? the brew cut through my cold to present a well-balanced stout that is softly drinkable and a quality beer that is readily available. A nice inclusion to the brewerys winter sampler."
"D - Overall a good beer. If I ever saw a six pack (probably not?) I might pick one up."
"Mouthfeel could be a bit softer, as the carbonation is a little much. It's also pretty thin for a stout, but it is light in the alcohol dept after all. Still, this is a very drinkable stout that would make a solid session beer."
"This really isn't a bad stout at all. Not sure it's up there with the Sammy Smith Oatmeal as far as sweet stouts go, but this is still a quality brew."
"Drinkability: Quaffable. Well-balanced and tasty."
"Otherwise, give me a Left Hand Milk Stout over this any day."
"D: Pretty smooth for a stout, but a little acrid for my tastes"
"D: Quite drinkable. It works as a dessert, but would pass during a night of stout drinking too."
"Very drinkable, low alcohol with robust bitter characteristics and nicely balanced malt flavors. Quite tasty, and very smooth."
"The beer took a little getting used to but like all good things to come it won out in the end. Flavors lasted and sip after sip became more satisfying."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. One of Sam Adams' better offerings."
"--"
"Pours a complete black with a tan colored two finger head that slowly dies down to a thin layer. Stickiness is pretty good, some spotty lacing on the sides. Smell is a milky coffee aroma with some sweet chocolate malt. Some gooey caramel and for some reason a faint hint of alcohol. Sweet french vanilla cream flavors up front with a hint of mocha. Aftertaste is dark coffee with a splash of brown sugar. Nice solid flavor that fits the style perfectly. Mouthfeel is, well, creamy with an almost full body. Carbonation is mild at most. Pleasantly surprised by this one. Glad this is easily available in my area."
"This is a fantastic brew that I would definetly recommend and look forward to having a few more of in the future."
"D - Good, it's smooth and goes down easy."
"Drinkability: Very high. Very good beer that drinks very smoothly. I am thrilled that this beer is available in the Winter mix pack since it has been discontinued in my area. One of my first favorite beers and still holds up very well after a few years absense. Highly recommended, my favorite Sam Adams brew."
"MF/D- very creamy indeed. almost nitro creamy. powdery feel stays on the palate, medium low carbonation, this feels like a meal in itself."
"Pours out a dark, almost purplish, brown with a creamy cafe au lait head and some here-and-there lacing. Smell is roast forwarded with more subtle whiffs of chocolate and an odd sweaty sock aroma. Flavor has a cola-like sweetness with bigger chocolate than in the smell. The sock off-flavor is not as prominent in the taste. Roast comes out more towards the middle and sticks around on into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and not all that thick considering the sweetness. OK drinkability. I was interested in having this after not having drunk it in years, but I don't see myself seeking this out again any time soon."
"Wow, this is without a doubt the best beer I have ever had from Boston Brewing. This really goes to show that larger breweries can still produce outstanding products. I think other American brewers could take a note from the relatively low ABV of this brew. Big flavors can come in smaller packages. Delicious, smooth, and highly drinkable. Give me this beer again any day."
"Highly recommended! You won't taste much if you drink it cold straight from the fridge, but if you let it sit out 5-10 minutes and start on it when it's cool, it will be an absolute treat."
"Flavor holds a bitterness up front of the hops, which mellow allowing the malts and chocolate notes come through. Nearly perfectly balanced flavor."
"A very nice beer. This was part of the winter 12 pack (as an added bonus the 12er was only $9.99 at my local supermarket). The beer was a very dark brown/black with red highlights when held up to the light. A medium sized head. The aroma was swet roasted malt and coffee. A taste of espresso with a hint of chocolate. Nice and sweet, a little hop bitterness late. A very smooth, enjoyable beer."
"The roasted malts are very soft in this stout. It's a glass of velvet, really. Medium-bodied rather than thick. That's the only thing I didn't like."
"D: Extremely drinkable, easy to drink and goes down quite well with dark chocolate or a nice smoked meat."
"Yeah I'm impressed. Pours an almost black color with a nice medium head. Smells like burnt malt and caramel, but slightly. Taste is very smooth creamy sweet malt with a hint of unsweentened cocoa in the background. Overall a definite winner, this is something I hope is available all year around. This is the kind of stout Guiness should be making, damn good beer. Go get it now!!"
"Drinkability: Very nice. This is a good addition to the Sam Adams Winter Sampler. It is a smoothe drinking stout that is low in alcohol and has lots of deep flavors. A good choice for a milk stout."
"Overall- It's a beer I'd drink again, but not really seek out. I'm happy to see it in the Winter Classics 12 pack this year."
"A very nice sweet stout; not too sweet, just the right blend of chocolate, coffee and caramel malts to make for a great selection any time of year."
"The roasted coffee flavor is very strong in the taste -- too strong probably. It dominates everything else. It's a smooth drink though. Enjoyable enough to drink another. Just wish it wasn't quite so one dimensional."
"Drinkablity is high. Very tasty, but light and low ABV."
"This one pours a nice black with brown around the edges and a fairly thick tan head, the head sticks around nicely. The smell is upfront roasted black coffee and black malt, followed by chocolate malt it's slightly fruity and a bit smoky as well. The taste is dominated by coffee like flavors it is actually a bit astringent if it's too cold but as it warms a touch of sweet caramel malt comes through but again it is dominated by bitter dark malt there is a touch of spicy hop in there too but it is definitely hidden underneath, the roasted black malts do all the talking here. Mouthfeel is fairly full especially and soft especially when warm, not as soft as a nitro stout but remains a bit more prickly which I like this beer leaves a long lingering coffee flavor in the mouth. For me the drinkability is good but not great I'm not the biggest coffee fan and after one or two I could see the coffee flavor turning me off a bit but still this is a great stout one that I wish I had picked up earlier and will probably try again."
"Overall this was a good cream stout. I would be interested to do a side by side with Mackeson. They are made at the same brewery. This seemed a bit light, and might be my choice if I want a sweet stout that won't fill me up. But I would take a Mackeson, or St. Peter's if want a bit more flavor."
"I think I found a new beverage to have for breakfast, and that's Sam Adams Cream Stout. It's drinkable, not heavy, and damn tasty. Looking for a beer to turn a coffee lover onto? This would be my pick."
"Strong smell of roasted malts. Tastes like roasted malts, and coffee. Then turns to a flavor I can't quite place. Molasses or burned caramel? Quite flavorful and interesting, but it isn't quite as tasty as it smells, at least for me. First cream stout I've had though, so I have no comparison or feel for the style. Mouthfeel has the same consistency as most of the other Sam Adams beers I've had. I'd have this again."
"This beer is very rich, making it hard to drink a large amount of. However, a good drinkability for a cold winter night."
"Drinkability: If this beer didn't have an infatuation with sour roasted malts, I would have consistered this beer more drinkable. I might give this beer another chance down road. I just hope by that time they have stopped souring their roasted malts in this beer. Hooray for the appearance, but neh for everything else."
"D: very drinkable- one of my favorites. Every time I have one I wonder why it's not in my fridge more often."
"Drinkability: A pleasant beer that's very easy to drink down. For me, it's one of the top Samuel Adams beers."
"my second sampling from the '07 winter sampler ; pours a dark almost pitch reddish-black w/ a frothy tan head, and bubbles of """oil-slick""" black floating in it, dissapates too quick to enjoy this visual quality, some broken lacing as well ; not a strong smell, mostly a vinous chocolaty/burnt-toast aroma, no hop to speak of ; a thin tart roasted malt flavor, some almost smoky notes, burnt chocolate perhaps, if the flavor was stronger it would be more identifiable ; dry light bodied brew, decent co2 level ; very drinkable, tho not as good as most of this style i've tried.."
"Since this is most likely the first sweet stout many drinkers will have, it is a good introductory effort."
"Pours a near black color with a small tan head. The smell is of bitter chocolate, charcoal, and mocha. The taste is of bitter sweet chocolate, roasted coffee, a slight rust-like characteristic and some milky sweetness. The feel is surprisingly crisp which leads to a lighter feel, finishes on the bitter side. A solid stout, more on the bitter side than I expected, but good flavors."
"This is such a refreshing beer! It is very different from other stouts and it has a smoothness like no other...Highly rec'd"
"Drank a 12 oz. bottle with a March 2008 best-by date. Pours a delicious black with ruby highlights when held up to the light. Small, off-white head. Pretty good retention. Smells sweet: milky, oats, hints of coffee, toasted grains. Taste is much of the same: some dairy, coffee, dark grains. Clean, almost dark chocolatey finish. Mouthfeel is a little watery for a stout; not as smooth as I would like. Still, this is a very drinkable beer."
"Poured into a pint glass with 2 finger tan head, dark brown almost black color. Smell is toasted malts, coffee, chocolate, a little sweetness. Taste is also of toasty malts, coffee, with a little sweetness. Mouthfeel was decent, wouldnt want to drink more then a couple. Overall not my fav, but goes well with the holiday sampler."
"drinkability is good. this is a mildly bitter and dry stout, but is well crafted and complex in flavor. somewhat unique in character, this is a stout that brings out the dark brew lover in any drinker. cheers!"
"This is an excellent stout. It pours a really dark brown, almost black with a caramel head that isn't too thick, but not too thin either. It smells of rish dark roasted malts with hints of sweetness. The taste is phenomenal. It tastes like rich roasted malts with a hint of coffee, chocolate, and cream flavors. The aftertaste is just as good and it goes down really smooth, Possibly one of my favorite stouts, which makes it one of my favorite beers. Try this if you have the chance - Delicious!"
"Good all-around stout from Sam Adams Winter Classics. This pours a thick finger of nice frothy tan head over a deep brown body, and has a prominent chocolate, coffee aroma. Its flavors are good, with the chocolate mixing well with strong Sumatra coffee, all wrapped in a nice roasted taste overall. Cream Stout is easy and smooth to consume, a good steady stout and solid addition to the Winter Classics. Other stouts are bolder in taste and flavors such as coffee, but Cream Stout is easily accessible for stout lovers and newcomers alike. Not overpowering, but a good beer and, for strangers to stout, a very nice introduction. One could do much worse. Well worth a try."
"Creamy, with a profound chocolate-sweet taste with a bittersweet aftertaste, this is defintely a unique beer... Great with chocolate or anything sweet, this is a robust, sugarey, and pleasing sample of a really good stout... Despite not being a particular fan of this type of beer, I enjoyed drinking this one after already having a couple of beers, so that the bitter aftetaste was cancelled out and the sweet, roasted chocolate flavor predominated my taste buds... Had this with a butterfinger and a snickers, and really enjoyed it... Certainly worth trying if you're a fan of stouts, a good, classic Sam Adams brew..."
"Drinkability: I like it and could drink maybe 2 of these but slowly cause this beer isn't my personal taste. The taste is so complex that it's best savored."
"Don't know the style that well, but this seems to hit it well. Sweet but retains the elements of a stout, thick mouthfeel. Not too complex."
"D: A fair stout, pretty good, a nice beer to put in the mix-pack, but I probably wouldn't go out and buy a sixer of it, there are better stouts out there."
"Overall a good beer I'm glad I got to try. The freshness really comes across in the mild nutty flavors. It's a very soft and dainty stout with lots of full flavors. Nice job BBC."
"Very easy to drink. A very approachable stout."
"Had this with a couple of fresh baked cookies that were still warm, very, very good!"
"dark chocolate brown color; very opaque as well; the color of the head reminds me of the color of the foam from a root beer float and left a nice bit of lacing all the way down the bottle. can definitely smell hints of chocolate and caramel coming of it; very fragrant in a good way; mouthfeel is a bout what i would expect for a stout, it is kinda sweet at the beginning with a kick of alcoholic bitterness at the end; yet there seems to be a strange carbonation that runs over the tongue that just doesn't sit with me quite right; taste wise has hints of coffee and chocolate for sure; yet i feel that one can taste the coffee more than anything else; maybe a little bit of caramel as well; can really tell that there are some malts in here yet they don't seem to be too strong"
"Sam Adams has pleased me once again. This is a great brew, nice to drink, and very affordable."
"For the price, I rank this highly. I prefer Hitachino Lacto Stout but cannot afford to drink that daily!"
"Once of the better milk stouts out there. Impressive."
"This beer is damn good, and my local Kroger stocks it religiously, so I'm in luck."
"Sam Cream Stout pours an opaque espresso brown with a thin off-white head. Sweet malt in abundance with a warm roasting element in the mouth. Relatively thin in the mouth, this stout lacks the body and form of its more masculine competitors, but not a bad version nevertheless. Easily drinkable, decent stout character, and mass availability make for EZ relief when in need of a dark one."
"d - i could drink this all night, goes down a lot smoother than most of the stouts i enjoy"
"D - Easily drinkable. This is a light and clean stout that packs in just enough flavor to justify its color. I would almost think of this as a """nut brown stout"""."
"Pours black as night with a very think tan head lasting a long time. Full of roasted aroma as if you were drinking a pot cof dark roasted coffie. There is hints of munich malt and plenty of roasted barley and chocolate malt with not much hop aroma or flavor but enough to balance this beer out. Creamy and a full body mouthfeel lighty carbonated. Very tasty."
"Nice dark color, along with good stout head and lacing. Has an excellent scent, very deep and rich, with wonderful coffee and roasted barley aromas. It has a good flavor, nice and deep, along with a nice sweet aftertaste. Although its not the best stout on the market, its worth a try, definitely in the holiday pack and even as a six pack by itself."
"d: highly drinkable session beer. a lighter stout that goes down easy."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep dark brown, almost black, forming a thick creamy 1 inch tan head. Medium spots of lace along the glass. The aroma is fantastic mix of roasted malts and dark chocolate! The taste also does not dissapoint. Roasted malts, chocolate, light coffee, and a hint of caramel. Not too complex, but completely delicious! Thick smooth mouthfeel. Low abv. and incredible flavor makes for extremely high drinkability and an ideal session ale. Overall, I have been waiting to try this beer ever since I started into the world of craft beer, and I can safely say that I was not dissapointed. Wonderful full flavor and decent abv., I could drink this all night. A great Sam Adams Brew, and my favorite by far!!!"
"Poured into a pint glass this has a very deep brown color with a slight cherry tint in the light. There was a nice cream colored 1/2in head that lasted for a while. The smell was of roasted malts, and even some dark chocolate. There is a nice taste of coffee, but no real sweetness to this beer. The hops were absent as well leaving a coffee flavored after taste. Lightly carbonated this was a heavier beer not recommended for a night of drinking, but on a cool fall night it hit the spot nicely. I will have to say I was expecting more from this beer though."
"A solid beer. Most of SA's older examples I don't care much for, but this is right on the style."
"Final Note: I've only had a few Milk Stouts and I don't really care much for them, but of what I've had this seems pretty much 'run of the mill' for the style."
"Mouthfeel is slightly watery, appropriate amount of carbonation for this style. Overall this is a pretty good brew, but comes up short on flavor and body.I think it's worth a try and its an easily drinkable but there is lots of room for improvement."
"Wow. Pours coke black, with a tan head, creamy head. Leaves a great sheet of lace on the glass. Smells of chocolate. And a hint of coffee. Tastes the same as smell, but, no sign of bitterness. Just a great, smooth, stout. Finishes a bit sweet, but, I like that in a stout."
"Drinkability- Great beer. Enjoyed it a lot."
"Very easy to drink, which is surprising considering how much is going on in this beer. This is yet another great offering from Sam Adams. Definitely try this one."
"I hope my bottle didn't go bad or anything. I now see the 'Drink By' date is September 2007, so I'm technically in the range, but I think I'll give this another chance soon."
"D- A very sessionable stout. I could drink plenty of these in a sitting and not get sick due to the light nature of the brew."
"Overall impression: nice and drinkable - this is a quality offering with a high drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is ok, but should be fuller for a crean stout in my opinion."
"I think I lucked out on some very good brews from Sam Adams, based on such a random selection."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer looks a deep mahogany on the pour but appears black in the glass with a tan, two-finger viscous head. The smell is very malty; roasted and chocolate malts, with the chocolate being pretty pronounced. I would have to say that I don't find the taste as good as the smell, the initial taste has a bit of non-descript hops to it and the chocolate is more of an aftertaste than anything. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a light carbonation. This beer was almost gone by the time I finished the review, making it very drinkable indeed. Overall a very excellent offering by SA, my only real complaint is that the ABV could be knocked up a little. Very sessionable as a result however."
" Overall very very pleasing and a nice surprise in this offering. It was my first one of the mixed pack and kinda glad it was as this was outstanding. I wished I had it a little later as it would have made for a fine dessert offering, however where it placed was just perfect. I really look forward to having another at some point. Try this one if you can, really good example of one of my favorite styles."
"D - This was another great offering from Boston Beer. I enjoyed a couple of bottles of this today"
"Creamy and smooth in the mouth. This is a nice sweet stout, that I will be going back to this coming winter for sure."
"This was my first cream stout, I'll have to get some more Guinness Extra Stout and compare."
"Very smooth and creamy, as you would expect. Another fine brew from Sam Adams."
"Nice thick dark pour- deep dark brown with a moderate head and some sticky lacing. Extremely crisp malt aroms are present- dark chocolate, caramel, and some roasted malts. Body is full, but not too filling. taste was nice- bittersweet with just a hint of a lactose flavor, not bad at all. The finish is dry, with undertones of tabacco and cocoa powder. It was a very easy drinking beer and I was surprised at how flavorful this Sam Adams brew turned out to be."
"12oz brown bottle from RSVP in Portland. Pitch black body with just the slightest hint of ruby-red highlights with a quarter inch of tan head that dissipates quickly. Burnt coffee and chocolate malts with vanilla and lactose notes. Tastes roasty with chocolate and coffee, vanilla and lactose, with no one flavor overwhelming another. A rich full body with a fair bit of carbonation to cleanse the palate, though the roastiness sticks around for a while. An outstanding stout, and one of the best I've had in quite some time."
"M"
"The flavor hits the front of the mouth with some nice, acrid coffee notes backed by plenty of chocolate and a noticable hop note. I can't bring myself to call the taste """amazing", but it's pretty good. The moutfeel is somewhat of a low point, but it does get the job done for the style. It's a medium/light body, a tad overcarbonated, but it has a great bitter finish. All in all, this is a super aromatic, tasty, complex stout. For a sweet stout, it definately captured my attention, and I'll most likely have one again sometime soon."
"12oz fresh sample(Nov. 07 notched) that pours the darkest mahogany and almost black. The head is semi-creamy with bubbles too big to give a mousse-like extra creaminess found on say a nitro-tap stout or a bottle conditioned Russian Imperial. Still a swirl of the glass shows enough creaminess to warrant the name as I don't believe lactose is used in this recipe. Aroma of roasted chocolate malt is just superb. It's roasty and semi-sweet. Taste showcases the semi-sweet roastiness with just the right amount of balance from bittering hops. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for the style but doesn't detract. Right away my mind swims with food pairings ranging from starters such as beef stews to main courses of roasted or BBQ'd caramelized meats to desserts of chocolate or vanilla. At the moment it's best pairing is my glass and my company because it's also a great sipper."
"Taste is quite balance, nuanced, and full. This isn't the in your face Impy Stout, its a subtle buddy, roasty malts blending with a creamy lactose, like chocolate milk and coffee, there must be some hops creating this nice bittering. But the theme here is smooth, oh so smooth, creamy, silky, with the fairest of effervescence. This is a tasty stout, as easily enjoy in June as in January."
"Beautiful dark pour with nice creamy head. Roasted malt flavors are evident with hints of coffee. Very smooth and drinkable. Slightly sweet finish. Possibly a bit thin for a stout. Very good beer that I have had on numerous occasions. Reasonalbly priced and easy to find, even in beer purgatory, Mississippi."
"Poured a pitch black color with a respectable brown head that settled fairly quickly. Smells of lightly roasted coffee,steamed milk,chocolate. Tastes amazing! Chocolate, coffee, a cloying sweetness all compete for your attention. Nice and smooth mouthfeel, good body, nice creamy texture. One of the most drinkable stouts i've had in a long time. I could easily make this an everyday beer."
"D - I can probably drink 2 of these. A bit thicker, but not in a bad way. Everything tastes so good though I would probably want to drink more, but would also probably feel full."
"Aroma is very strong and smoky, with hints of coffee and chocolate. It just screams """Drink me!""" It pours a beautiful sable, nearly black and opaque, with a thick tan head. Flavor does not disappoint - it is rich and smoky with whispers of chocolate and coffee. It goes down smooth and lively and leaves a pleasant aftertaste like burnt coffee that has a touch of chocolate in it. A must for any stout and porter fanatic."
"D: For drinking it on a summer night, I was somewhat surprised. It was great. I am a big stout fan, and will probably down quite a few of these this summer and continuing on. I loved it: delicious, solid representation, and fairly inexpensive."
"This beer pours an opaque black, and has good head formation (comprised of tiny bubbles) for a Sam Adams beer. Aroma is suprisingly roasty and sweetly pleasant. Flavor has a lot of off notes...the roastiness is there, but the entire presentation is a bit off...I get some chemical-ness, some sourness, and some super-sweet maltiness. Mouthfeel is substantial and quite dry. I'm not a big fan of most Sam Adams products, but I found this one quite passable. Definitely recommended."
"D: This would be an excellent fall/winter beer, or served with something heavy (roast, beef stew, or Irish stew). I can drink this by itself, but probably wouldn't for too long. KY summers get hot, and sometimes you can't drink as many stouts/porters as I would like."
"D & Notes: For some damn reason, this brew cannot be sold in Texas, as I had to purchase it in Missouri while visting family. This beer is so good, it would nearly be worth the drive to get more (okay, I am kidding about that). Seriously though, the smootheness of this brew with the complex flavors is awesome. Best of all, nothing is overdone or meant to overwhelm you, so you could easily have a few of these and it still be very enjoyable."
"d- easy to drink for a stout, however i dont like to drink too many stouts (makes me feel full). aside from this, this is one of the best beers ive had in quite some time."
"Drinkability: Fair, I could see putting away maybe two pints of this but probably more of an occasional beer. Still a pretty nice example of style."
"The beer is poured into a pint glass at room temp. A fluffy creamy tan head of 2 cm foams up easily and fades very slowly. The color is pitch black and no light passes through. Aroma is roasted malt, molasses, and some cocoa. No real hop presence on the nose. First sip reveals a fizzy carbonation and liter than expected body with slightly thin texture. Flavor is all malt with roasted malt, some coffee bean and hints of baker's chocolate. No sweetness that I would expect from a cream stout but a decent beer. I do get some herbal hops on the finish. This is a decent stout, but dont expect the typical sweetness of a milk stout."
"Drinkability- I don't know a lot about milk stouts, but this stuff taste pretty good."
"d. I really can't see myself having more than two of these in a sitting. It's not terribly heavy, but the combination of taste and mouth feel make it something you want to sip on without being really complex and flavorful enough to justify how slow I'm drinking it. Fairly average."
"There are some really nice flavors here. Nice roasted malt presence creating some nice coffee flavor, there is also some very sweet chocolate flavor in there, caramel is present in the background, and some fruity hops help balance out this brew. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, but is a touch more thin and carbonated than I would prefer. Nice drinkability, and overall a solid beer."
"It's a good mellow stout, the astringency might be a bit much but overall it's very well rounded and a very good example of the sweet stout style."
"Best before July 2007. Dark chocolate brown, nearly black with a mammoth head of khaki foam. Soft cocoa aromas (like Malt-O-Meal) with slight vanilla and coffee notes -- smells promising! Watered-down chocolate syrup flavors comingle with a bit of malted milk ball and roasted grain coffee. Mouthfeel is sort of thin and sloppy, with nothing very interesting going on. Actually, while being thin it simultaneously seems sticky and syrupy, but in a non-substantial way. Drinkable, but nothing too special."
"Poured a dark, dark brown with a cream-colored head that quickly faded but left a light lacing across the top of the glass. A roasted malt smell, with hints of coffee and chocolate. Delicious taste: a strong roasted flavor once it hits your mouth, then a coffee aftertaste that lingers in the back of your throat, with the slightest hint of chocolate. The aftertaste is the proper mix of sweet and bitterness. Goes down creamy, and has the right touch of light carbonation. A nice wet finish leaves you wanting another sip. Very drinkable, and even though this beer fills you up, I wanted another."
"Taste is like a sweetened cappuccino. Medium mouth feel. Mild cocoa & coffee flavors. I would prefer a bit more of one of them to be present. Hops are mild and floral with just a touch of roasted flavors sticking around too. I think I'm tasting an oak flavor as I reach the bottom of the glass. The carbonation is medium & the beer has a dry finish."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. A nice, dark body with a tan head. Slow retention typical of a Sam Adams brew that reduces into a nice lacing. It smelled a very roasted smell with chocolate present that gave it a very """grungy""" feel too it. The smell reminded me a little bit of a nice porter. It tasted a toasted chocolate taste. The chocolate was not very sweet, like a milk chocolate; more like an unfilitered cocoa taste, being a little on the bitter side. A nice thick mouthfeel that was very satidfying; very smooth going down. A nice, smooth drinking beer overall. Don't look to pound these back - they are better than that. Enjoy one while you are just hanging out or looking to mellow out. Overall, a good brew."
"D = One of my favorite stouts. With its strong flavors and sweet undertones, this beer pairs nicely with dessert (dark chocolate or cheese plate)--or have it in lieu of dessert. Best sipped and savored. It'd be hard to drink more than 2 at a sitting."
"Very dark, basically black, with a tan head. Quite a bit of lacing, not quite solid sheets, with fair head retention. Malty, roasted aroma with a little burnt and bitter chocolate. Moderate bitterness, initially quite sweet, but this faded quickly leaving some fruit and chocolate character. Roasted, dry finish. Medium body and carbonation, sort of creamy. Pretty good overall. I nice mild stout."
"pours black in the glass with a medium tan two finger head that hold well and very nice lacing. rich coffee, sweet toffee aromas. taste, dark caramel, fresh brewed dark roast coffee and slightly bitter chocolate with hops coming through to balance it all nicely. smooth mouthfeel and very goog carbonation. glad its brewed year round because i could drink it year round for sure."
"A nice offering from SA. I was surprised by the full flavor of this stout. I expected something much more sweet, but was pleasantly surprised. Very balanced and creamy."
"Very drinkable nice session stout."
"D- Far more drinkable than many sweet stouts because of the thin mouthfeel. I think I'll have another."
"This is a heavy beer, limiting its drinkability, but a good after dinner drink."
"D: Very good, not too heavy or syrupy. Very good entry level stout. Sessionable for those that like stouts."
"D- Overall quite nice, would get it again. Substantial yet not too heavy."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a deep obsidian black color, with about a finger and a half of creamy thick offwhite head. Head dissapeared quickly into a bubbly blob in the center of the glass. Smelled faintly of chocolate, brown sugar, and tiny hints of vanilla. Tasted of chocolate, faintly of burnt coffee, and some charcoal notes in there as well. Mouthfeel was very thin and almost watery. Drinkability was average. Seems like a beer that could be consumed in large quantities. Not great but not bad. Could drink this again."
"D - A very well-crafter beer, I am very happy with it. I will add it to my rotation. A good """beginner's stout.""""
"Cheers!"
"D---Crafted with attention to detail and a real joy to drink. I think it is the best tasting SA offering to date."
"classic stout appearance. dark liquid and big tan creamy head. smell of chocolate and malt, taste of cofee and cocoa. light mouthfeel and smoothness like a guiness. not very carbonic so no serious bite or tingle, just smoooth in and down. signature well balanced sam adams beer."
"Notes - Decent all around. Taste is much more appealing than the smell. Either way its worth a try and a decent session beer to boot. I would be willing to give it another try, but as my first cream stout I'm more interested in exploring what else the style has to offer as I was not overwhelmed."
"Probably one of my favorite offerings from the Boston Beer Co. and I really wish more local places would carry it as it would probably have a permanent place in my fridge... A great offering that shouldn't be missed!"
" Mouthfeel is sessionable and heavy but not syrupy - well done. Drinkability - a good sipper, not one I'll stock but will reccomend to friends and enjoy if offered. I was ecpecting more of a stout, but this is good in it's own right."
"Deep brown-bordering on black in color. Nice tan head on top. Some great lacing as it goes down. Very nice, nutty and roasted aromas. Great-somewhat mellow roasted flavor. Hint of nuttiness and a slight trace of sweetness. The aroma and flavor really meld together for a singular experience. Velvety, creamy mouthfeel despite the roasted flavor. Extremely enjoyable and drinkable beer. I havnt had this in years. Damn nice to have again."
"Excellent brew from Sam Adams. I was very impressed, but maybe not surprised, that they use a different yeast strain than their usual brews. I wish this beer was as widely available as Guinness. It is dark and frothy, darker head than Guinness, but very acceptable for the style. It has a nice roasty smell, and taste that complements it as well. I think it is a perfect balance of hops and malt for the style. I cannot immediately distinguish the hops, but I can taste the bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malts. It has a decent mouthfeel, but may be better if infused with nitrogen. No alcoholic or estery flavors at all, so it is very drinkable. I highly recommend this beer for any one who doesn't like Guinness, because this is more to style for a stout and is not sour one bit (then again it is a sweet stout style, instead of regular stout!). I always am pleased with anything from Boston Brewing Company, and this just confirms it again! Cheers!"
"Drink-Ability: First time with a cream stout and I must say I really enjoyed this brew! I can not wait to try others."
"This beer pours into a pint glass looking like it smells...like fresh brewed espresso. Hints of chocolate occasionally break through the nose as well. This beer is referred to as """the cappuccino of beers""" on the Samuel Adams website, and I can't improve on that....The taste of mild coffee and dark chocolate travel throughout from start to finish. Hints of warm caramel also ribbon through this roasted malty offering. The creamy mouth feel and finish add to the drinkability and appeal of this stout. Pairs great with hearty chili (especially as an ingredient), beef stew, or steak....I have, however, consumed a few for dessert...Enjoy"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Sly Fox pint glass. Appears a nice dark, deep shade of brown with a good two fingers of thick creamy tan head. Smells of roasted coffee, mild grains, and sweet malt. Tastes of roasted malt, milk chocolate, cappuccino. Smooth and velvety with a medium body. I'm glad this is fairly easy to find as I can always count on this beer to satisfy."
"Kinda frustrating to review these S.A. brews. The flavors are good, but leave me megging for more richness, boldness, and flavor. Sure the brew is solid, and probable fit the style well. However, in this one, I wanted a heavier cream character; a bolder, richer milk chocolate, capuccino flavor; and a bit more overall weight. What I got was a cleanly brewed, well formed recipe that is not offensive, yet risks little. Though timid for my taste, I thought the brew fell dangerously close to a Dry-Stout chalkiness, and with a thin body. Fortunately, but beer steers clear of obvious lactose additions and artificial sweetness. This S.A. brew does very well; I just wanted more out of it."
"Poured into a Guinness glass from a bottle. Nice vigorous dark tan head above a pitch black liquid. Roasted malts, sweet caramel, and char. Very rich and smooth and it leaves a nice burnt taste in your mouth. The mouthfeel is creamy and bold with a little bite at the end as it warms up. Overall this is a good stout, plus Sam Adams always maintains a reasonable price: $6.99 for a 6'er."
"Pours black, thin tan head, not much retention, but decent lacing. Smell is of coffee, and chocolate, and malts. Smell was on the weak side. Body was thin, with some carbionation. and somewhat watery. Taste is like the smell, with a dry finish. More like a weak dry Irish Stout than a Milk Stout. Low abv, so drink it all night...But why??"
"Majestic black with a great coffee head, smells of chocolate, coffee, and burnt toast. Thick and chewy, coffee flavors everywhere, some nutty goodness (hazelnut?). Pretty good. Goes down smooth. I recommend trying it. A very good stout for the price, and another good product from Sam Adam's."
"An easy drinking, rounded edges stout. Maybe a bit undersweet for the style, but that's not a complaint. Nicely balanced and highly drinkable."
"This beer poured well with a nice head that, unfortunately, dissipated too quickly and the aroma of coffee and chocolate instantly made my mouth water. The flavor of this beer was redundant of the scent, but slightly dulled. While the carbonation was definitely present, it was not overbearing and it finished softly and somewhat dry."
"It might not be the best representation of the style, but it gets an E for effort, at the least. The aroma promises more than the flavor delivers, but the end result is a decently drinkable, earthy stout, though it might not provoke a host of fond memories. So it's enjoyable, just not notable. Could be worse, I'm sure."
"Drinkability: I think I could drink quite a few of these because they aren't too heavy or syrupy, but I'm not sure sweet stouts are my thing. This is basically a lighter Young's double chocolate stout, but I think I would rather take a Mackeson over either."
"D: for what is going on in this beer, it is a good drinker. However, not even close to being one of my favorites"
"Samuel Adams Cream Stout was black in color with a hint of ruby when held to a light. The tan head was thick, rocky and had good retention, leaving rings of lace in the glass. The aroma was sweet dark malt and roasty. The taste was dark malt, chocolate, and coffee. The finish was dry and quite nice. The body was medium, sort of creamy, and the carbonation was about medium. Drinkability was good. Overall this a good stout that I will definitely have again"
"d - clean finish and highly drinkable. really stands up well with others stouts like rogue shakespeare, etc. with the low ABV on this one, i can drink a few of these on a cold night."
"Is very drinkable, worth a try."
"Bottom line: A *very* tasty sample of the style that I can easily recommend."
"This is a great beer for just about any time, especially for sessioning. Highly recommended."
"Two scoops of French vanilla ice cream, in addition, would satisfy."
"D - Very drinkable. Rich and full, so probably can't drink more than one, or two at the most without feeling full, but would otherwise love to just sip on one of these all evening."
"D: I don't mind this cream stout. Actually one of the better one's I've had. Quite drinkable and smooth."
"Drinkability was good by default. (Watery beers with weak flavors are usually easy to drink.)"
"This is a drinkable beer. I think it lacks the warming characteristic found in other beers of the style. It's OK, but not great."
"Notes: Not much to critique here. Pretty straight forward with nothing offensive. Probably the best Cream Stout I've had to date. This brew is fairly meaty for such a low ABV. Amazing."
"This is an easy to drink stout with just the right amount of sweet and bitter balance, that leaves a lingering coffee aftertaste. I would try this one again."
"Drinkability is great for such a thick and creamy beer. The abv% obviously helps. This beer is just so tasty and aromatic that its hard NOT to drink. Bravo Samuel Adams. You definitely have a winner on this one. Even my girlfriend likes this beer!!!"
"I poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Nice and dark, expecting a bit more out of the head, though that might be due to the detergent on my glass. Nice and sweet caramel flavor chased by a toasted barley feel. Very nice and drinkable, solid mouthfeel. I will buy this again."
"Picked some of this stuff up the other day finally and I was very impressed. I even took a picture after I poured it, it was a beautiful sight to say the least. It poured a nice black that you could barely see through and an AMAZING head that stuck around. Smelled like caramel and roasted malts. It had a sweet creamy taste with hints of chocolate and nuts. Goes down great. This has become one of my new favorite stouts, give it a shot if you havent already."
"This beer poured a black color with a thick, persistent head that had a nice little bit of lace. The smell is bitter and has a slightly burnt odor. The taste is bitter and smooth with a coffee type overtone. The mouthfeel is thick, kind of chewy and creamy. This is a great beer that Id consider very drinkable.but it might be a little rich for several in a row."
"Drinkability: The easiest to down stout I've ever had."
"The best of Sam Adams'."
"A worthwhile beer, and one of my favorites from the Samual Adams brewery. Additionally, since it has the name appeal, this would be a good introductory beer for people interested in exploring more full-bodied, complex drinks. Recommended."
"D - Really nice representation of the style. And you can beat it at Sam Adams prices."
"An awesome brew from Sam Adams. Poured a thick black with a half-inch of head. Good lacing. Hints of chocolate and coffee with some nuts and florals too. Very sweet which is a little odd but makes it surpringly drinkable for a stout. I was a little worried about this one but I will be buying it again."
"Slightly sweet taste with a boldly bitter finish but doesn't make you queasy after three or four so drinkability is high. Unfortunately with beers this bold, it's difficult to make a session out of them and still have any real appreciation for it's character. But definitely more drinkable than most sweet stouts. Altogether highly recommended and with a pretty reasonable price tag as well. Enjoy folks! It's well worth it!!"
"."
"DA: nice with food...nice for dessert...."
"DA: Highly drinkable Sammy right here."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts: As a cream stout, this sits fairly heavily in the stomach but is still incredibly drinkable. Has the nice smooth quality of a great cream stout. A worthy member of the Sam Adams Brewmaster's Collection."
"Drinkability is great. This would be a good choice for a session stout. The smell is misleading. I was expecting and overly sweet stout but was presently surprised by the balance of flavors."
"Cheers!"
"D: This is pretty good. I'd have another, but I only bought one bottle. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Dark, rusty maroon and a great ochre head. Take your time looking at this beer because it's much better as it warms, with the sweet roasted character really coming out near the end. Tastes of coffee, chocolate and milk: a pretty simple blend, but it works. Sweetness hits first, but it's quickly balanced out by a little bitterness, ending on a mild but welcome hop note in the aftertaste. Smells a little flat and sour--nothing like the taste! But for a cream stout it's surprisingly thin... making it far more drinkable even if it doesn't really suit the style or the flavors."
" Very enjoyable. Highly drinkable."
"Deep dark brown like a walnut from the deepest, darkest woods. Huge tan head settles to an 1/8 of an inch and lasts for most of the duration. Sweet dark toffee and loads of it in the aroma, ice cream, chocolate, peanut brittle, and honey. It is a truly wonderful aroma. Carbonation is blistering. Body is medium with mild chocolate bitterness. Taste is sweet espresso, bakers chocolate, caramel, and a mild burntness. Mild lactic qualities. All the elements are here and it drinks fairly well but for reasons I just cant explain it just doesnt live up to the better milk stouts Ive had."
"The S.A. Cream Stout pours nicely into a glass, I love the dark beers and their off white heads. There is some bitterness in the head, like roasted coffee with some dark bitter chocolate. Not a lot of sweetness or hops here. The body leans more heavily towards the chocolate end of things, although there is some nice spice, and a mollasses like flavor. The hops do show up a bit, but in a supporting role only. Although I do enjoy the beer, I feel a cream style beer should have tighter carbonation and a smoother mouthfeel. This finishes fairly strong, but not overwhelming. You can put a few of these down before it becomes too much to handle."
"Back in the mid 90s this was one of my favorite Sam Adams beers, it still is and I am glad to see that it is not a ghost of its former self. Still rich and satisfying, I would be happy to spend a night sipping a few pints of this brew."
"D-This being my first stout, I thought it was nicely balanced. The fairly full body made for an interesting brew."
"Very dark pour with a light, tan head. Aroma of coffee and caramel, leading to a taste of a pleasant, nutty coffee. Sweeter and smoother than many stouts. The mouthfeel was average and typical for a stout. Although I enjoyed this beer, I could probably not drink more than a couple in a sitting."
"D- This beer has nice depth of malt and a good fragrant beer at that. It has some nice creaminess in smell, taste and mouthfeel. It is note a really big beer so it will make a pleasant session beer."
"D=Very drinkable dark beer. Smooth and finishes clean which makes you want to take another sip. Would recommend highly. Sam Adams comes through once again. Thanks, Jim!"
"I bought a six pack of the stuff. Poured one of them in a pint glass and right away could smell the chocolate and coffee. Very good smell. The head on it was like chocolate ice cream colored and stayed long enough. The color was very dark and could see the carbonation. The taste was definetly not as good as the smell but it was still quite good. It had a full mouthfeel you definetly could tell you were drinking a stout. Overall I will continue to drink this as it was a very good beer."
"D: While this isn't the strongest stout it is still good and something I can see myself getting again. A good beer to initiate someone into the wonderful world of stouts as it is very easy to drink, and dosn't pack too much flavor."
"A really enjoyable stout, with flavors that aren't too intense, which makes it very drinkable."
"Last bottle of a six pack. Pours cola black with decent sized head, which after a minute or so turns into a ring with lacing all over. Abundance of carbonation bubbles. Smells of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste is just like smell, with some hints of coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy while somehow managing to be on the light side. Nice dry, bittering (but not overly so) finish. Putting away a few of these would be no problem. Solid brew."
"Drinkability is above average but again thinness and overall muted tones make this OK, not great but definitely drinkable."
"This stout left lots of lacing down my glass and really had a nice head on the pour. One thing Sam Adam's has going for them is they're beers look really good and smell good. The head on this beer never goes anywhere. Has a full, rich mouthfeel. You'd think with all the flavor, it would have a higher ABV, but is a nice session beer. Had a nice bitterness touch which lingered a bit. That being said, this beer is fairly complex, very opaque color, with toffee, caramel and coffee ringing through on the smell and taste, for that matter. This stout is as good as any you will find."
"Pours into a pint glass black in color with a whispy lace on the top. Not much head to speak of. Smell is of coffee with a lot of creamer. Sweet but not overly so. Mild oder of smoke. Taste is very coffee like with some rich dark chocolate. Nice mildly bitter aftertaste to balance the sweetness. Taste very good. Mouthfeel is good with a nice dry finish. Medium bodied. Overall this is a very good beer that should always be in the fridge."
"A very drinkable stout. The low ABV makes this an excellent session beer. Big beer taste without the big beer alcohol."
"This beer poured a deep brown with a fair amount of head.The smell is of chocolate. The taste contains hints of oatmeal and there is a bitterness there as well. The mouthfeel is smooth. There is a lasting aftertaste that is a nice finish. I could drink this beer more often. A nice example of the style."
"Pours a dark chocoloate and coffee color, nice two finger tan cap that dissipated to a 1/4 inch cap leaving nice sticky lacings up sides. Aroma is coffee, caramel, molasses, chocolate, orange and fusal hops, and very light esters in undertones. Flavor is sticky sweet caramel, chocolate, and lots of coffee. So much coffee, I almost think there's added coffee. A little fusal hop bitterness, but is overwheled by the coffee astringency. Mouthfeel is light carbonation, medium body, and watery finish."
"Drinkability: Doesn't go down very easy because of the bitter dry quality, and the watery mouthfeel doesn't make it any easier, even though it probably should."
"overall, probably my favorite Sam Adams brew; very drinkable, and at $6.50 for a sixer, an amazing value."
"I should have gotten some more Boston Lager. This isn't really creamy at all, just a slightly above average American Stout. Is the world of dark beers limited to the Irish Dry Stout?"
"What a toss-up, this beer. On the one hand, it looks terrific, with a huge rocky head (have to watch how fast you pour it) and a pitch black stout color. It smells like a unique blend of roasted malts, which is what one expects from a sweet stout. Mouthfeel is good, with decent carbonation and smoothness. The flavor though... it starts with a sweet pale/caramel malt flavor, but is almost instantly obliterated by harsh, astringent charcoal. Every sip is like that: starts sweet, turns charred. The aftertaste is all charcoal, too. Dry is one thing, I can drink Guinness and I don't mind the sour dryness, but this charcoal astringency is too much. This was one of the first stouts I tried over a year ago, and in retrospect I can't remember why I didn't hate it then. Maybe I just didn't know any better."
"This poured a dark brown/black with a HUGE foamy tan head, which lingered for several minutes about the glass and left incredible lacing. Very impressive. The aroma was a typical stout, malty with coffee and mild chocolate hints. The taste was very smooth, with cream, sweet malts, caramel and coffee. The mouthfeel was a little more watery than I would have liked but it was still creamier than it was bitter. Relatively well-balanced. Great sipping beer."
"Samuel Adam's scores again. I was cooking eggs and sage sausage for breakfast and realized I was too lazy to make coffee (hey, it's hard work!) So I decided to open one of these that I just got yesterday and have it with breakfast. It does say """the cappuccino of beers""" afterall. The eggs and sausage were forgettable. The Cream Stout was awesome! I was impressed by the bulky, demonstrative head that stuck around and even now, as my glass is almost empty,leaves a heavy lacing and crown. Smells lovely--very appetizing, creamy smell as I would expect from a good rep. of this style. And the taste is very enjoyable--extremely smooth and mild, creamy, and sweet. Just what I was looking for. Who needs coffee? (I admit, I take mine with cream and sugar; and this sweet, creamy brew was a perfect replacement). This cream stout should be America's breakfast drink of choice."
"A well, balanced, complex cream stout, yet easy to drink. Not overly sweet. A great dessert choice, or to have on its own."
"D- i think this is the best sam adams ive had yet. this will be my go-to stout from now on. i will definitely drink this again."
"Samuel Adams Cream Stout pours a dark, not quite black color with plenty of ruby highlights to be seen with a small tan head. The smell is of roasted malt. The taste is ok, mostly roasted malt, no real coffee or chocolate notes stand out, always a dissapointment to me if drinking a stout. The mouthfeel is appropriately creamy. Seems like a good beginner stout to me, but for serious stout drinkers, I'd look elsewhere."
"Pours pitch black with mahogany highlights. The color is almost totally opaque, but becomes extra clear when held in front of a bright light. creamy biege head of one and a half fingers shows decent retention and an abundance of spotty lacing. Strong coffee aroma, with charred chocolate malt and background roasted barley. The taste is dextrinous sweet upon first sip, then some roasted notes mingle in, and then the flaovr is wonderfully balanced by a mellow coffee, chocolate malt, and barely perceivable fuggles hops. semi-dry in the aftertaste. The medium carbonation is enough to match the rich, dextrinous mouthfeel- a touch crisp, ut good texture. There is some excess residual sugar in the finish, but it's dry enough to retain a high drinkability. A great example of style with superb balance."
"D- to much of a burned flavor on this offering, I honestly expected a milk stout to be sweeter or at least less burned or bitter."
"Mouthfeel moderate, creamy, only lightly carbonated. Tastes of coffee, dark chocolate, with sweet and bitter sooo nicely balanced, leaving a dry cocoa powder on the finish. It is easy to savor or to gulp down...satisfying brew."
"Dark brown body over a good size tan head that doesn't quit (even after vigorous swirling!). The smell is a bit musky, but toasty, coffeeish malt undertones are present. A very mature taste, the malt and creamy flavors are forward and quite pleasant. There is a bit of an offness at the finish, like instant coffee. But it doesn't really hurt the overall effect."
"D: I suggest this brew to any dark beer fan. They are harder to find than the boston lager, but worth it. It took me awhile to get this beer because the first time I did try to buy it someone stole it from my shopping cart when I was not looking. I happened to have the last 6 pack in the store. But they had plenty when I went back a couple weeks later. Another good brew from Sam."
"The mouth is pretty smooth but it may be a touch over carbonated. This is one of my favorite SA beers. Im hoping it gets wide spread distribution and has some success as I would hate to see this one disappear."
"D - Very easy to drink, not a complaint about the drinkability at all."
"MF/D- The mouthfeel is moderate. Kinda thick and creamy but not too syupy at all, fairly light in weight. This is very drinkable i could do 2 or 3 of these."
"cheers..."
"The beer pours dark, really really dark. I put this beer near a light and could not see the light at all through the beer, that was one good sign to me. The head of the beer was a creamy brown and very frothy like a stout should be. No real smell at all though. distinct coffee, roasted malt flavor on the mouthful very soft milky beer, excellent flavor."
"This beer is one of my oldest beer memories. Getting one of my first mix packs and diving into a world that would soon consume my life. By far my favorite beer in the old mixpacks...2000 I suppose. It pours out a black beer with ruby edges in the light. The head is light tan with a good froth staying afloat throughout and beautiful lace clinging to the glass. It has a fruity apple peel smell with a good hint of roasted malts. The beer is a little more watery than I'd like, but it still has a delicious roasted, coffee like malt, with a nice sweetness to balance it. Just enough hops in the beer so that I notice them, but not to overpower anything. In fact the hops are more of an afterthought that they were there while drinking. Mouthfeel is unimpressive, a little to light and clean. Just not what I expect from the style. Oh the memories. And it is fine to drink, just can't live up to the amazing flavor I remember the first time I had it, in a time when my town's selection included only sam adams, saranac, mackeson's, and weihenstephaner."
"This beer goes down very easily. I really like it. Although it doesn't have all the """extreme""" characteristics of some other styles, IMHO that's what makes this beer so appealing. I could definitely drink a lot of these in a row! This is a great offering from Sam Adams."
"Boston Beer adds its 15th beer to my list- they keep coming at me with viable choices."
"D - I have had this before, albeit a very long time ago and to be honest... my opinions then weren't very good. I'm glad I gave it another shot because this is actually quite good, probably one of the better regular offerings from Sam Adams that is regularly available."
"I enjoyed having one very much but I was thinking if I was going to have another beer I would probably have something else."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Apperance is a dark, deep mahogany color with a thin, half-finger head that falls quickly to light tan lacing. Aroma is exceptionally sweet and malty, smells richly of cream and caramel, slight hints of cinnamon and nutmeg spice warm the nose, smells excellent. Taste is also sweet, however not as sweet as the aroma leads on. Taste is mainly comprised of chocolate/caramel malt flavors, starting sweet and finishing bitter with a light bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall a smooth beer, easy to drink and enjoy the incredible smell of this stout. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, moderate carbonation, feels slick and smooth on the tongue as it coats the mouth. Taste lacks some complexity, simpler than it seems it should be, still a very good beer. Would seek out again."
"Drinkability  Just a good staple stout. Easy to drink and tasty, what more do you need?"
"Drinkability - The first few sips are the best and it wears on you a bit after. Would buy again, but no more than a 6 pack."
"Very thick mouthfeel with a slightly tangy aftertaste. A very upfront, simple beer without a lot of subtle flavours, but extremely drinkable and a nice surprise for me, as most of the Sam Adams experiences I've had have been 'better than macro' but nothing fantastic."
"Verdict- It looks great, and the aroma is complex and alluring. The taste doesn't quite live up to the promise, though. It's a fine-tasting beer- sweet and roasty- but it's not exceptionally rich."
"Note - I prefer this a bit cooler as it gets too sweet as it warms."
"For a bitter beer, this has very good drinkability. I'd recommend it as a session beer if stout is your thing and the sweetness doesn't turn you off."
"This is another amazing beer from Sam Adams. The head disappears quickly after a straight-down-the-middle recommended Sam Adams pour. The beer is very dark with a slight amber coloring to an otherwise dark creamy head. The beer is strong in taste from the start with a somewhat fruity smoked coffee flavor."
"This pours a dark brownish with a large foamy tan head.The smell is a little slight,however.It does have a faint roasted coffee aroma,but not much else.The taste is your typical stout flavors,coffee,the most,a little chocolate,and some roasted malt.This is a bit lighter in flavor compared to other stouts.The m/f is very well balanced,but like I mentioned,it is a bit light or watery.The fact is though,this is a good beer from Sam's and I'll buy this again."
"Poured out a dark brew with faint red hues,one finger tan head that lingers a little bit.Has a faint licorice smell that im used to in porters not stouts,,very nice though. Taste of slight licorice but then it becomes dry with a nice coffee base. Slight hops linger in the end,,nice brew. Mouthfeel isnt too bad,,drinkability is pretty good in my book.A good stout to get non BA`s to try."
"The beer pours with a thick tan head on an opaque body. The head retains well and laces nicely. It smells richly of roasted and chocolate malts with strong hints of coffee. The beer tastes of roasted and chocolate malts with coffee and some welcome bitterness. It is nice and thick but the carbonation is a little overdone. A decent and drinkable stout."
"This beer is great to start out with. The cream flavor is very strong and blends well with the beer flavor. The first few sips are immaculate. Unfortunately it is very rich and by the time you get to the bottom of the bottle, and the beer has warmed up it's difficult to finish."
"Never the less very drinkable on a cold Winter's night. Sam Adam's comes through once again."
"Unexpectedly yummy stout. Good thing Sammy's available everywhere."
"Cheers!"
"Very enjoyable - nothing too crazy or intense."
"Pours an dark brown, with some ruby highlights. It's darned near impossible to see through. Aroma is malty and sweet. Reminds me of mashing in time at a brewery. That's what the aroma is. Taste is nice, slight twang that I chalk up to the cream stout style. Mouthfeel could use some work, a thicker beer would be nice, but this is a very drinkable beer."
"All and all a quite good stout. Just the right mix of sweet and hop and coffee to make me want more. Well worth a try."
"Very smooth and drinkable. Body is a little light for a stout with only a trace of alcohol warmth but still a very nice drink for a cold winter day."
"Drinkability - I can drink this rather easily, to me it tastes almost identical to Anchor Porter for some reason. Very good as a session beer."
"This seems to be a lot less filling than Guinness or other dry Irish stouts. If you dig the taste you could easily knock down a few of these. I was a bit disappointed in this one as I've come to expect exceptional things from the BBC. As stouts go, I prefer Guinness Extra and Mackeson's, but this isn't a bad brew, just not my cup of tea -- er, stout."
"i cannot figure out why there are haters of this brewery on this site, I love everything i have tried by BBC (have not tried the Cherry Wheat or Cranberry Lambic, the two most maligned beers by this brewery). As far as i'm concereced BBC is the best widely available brewery out there."
"This brew pours a black color. The head is huge and marvelous in color; light tan with white speckles. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is of roasted malt, and milk chocolate. The taste is like the aroma: roasted malt and chocolate. The mouthfeel is full bodied. It is a bit more carbonated than other stouts I have had, but it works well for this beer. In fact, I think it cuts through some of the thickness, and makes this more of a session stout. Overall, this is hands down Samuel Adams best year round offering, and a solid standby."
"Thoughts: I am not afraid to say that there are some SA brews that I really like. To me, there's a thin line between micro and macro. Sam's lager is one of the most consistent stable beers around. I also love the Old Fezziwig. With the Cream Stout, I will add another to the list. Macro or micro, this is a great beer."
"A winner. This is another solid beer from Sam Adams. Wish it were eaiser to find. Poured out to a Dark black color with a nice mocha cream head that ended up being little more than a blanket for the top of the beer. Lower carbonation. Nice, thick rings of lace around the glass. Aromas of cocoa, coffee and dairy were light but inviting. Taste was darn good; flavors of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, mild dark pepper and grain permeated the palate. Nice mouthfeel was full and rich. A good level of drinkability. What else can I say, Samuel Adams kicks out good beers. Period. Recommended. Special thanks to battlekow for the sample."
"Drinkability: With the low ABV this is highly slammable. I see it as more of a """go to""" beer for stout lovers. Nothing exciting but nothing offensive either."
"Pours up with a two finger head that stays with the beer. A lighter head with more of a brownish tint than some other stouts. The smell is of mocha and sweet malt. The taste is full, burnt and smoky with a nice coffee/sweet creamy finish. Creamy on the cheek and tongue from the word go, very nice on the way down...fun to drink. I will buy this one again, I really like the fact that SA can make quality beers and distribute them nationwide at affordable prices...props to SA."
"Drinkability: One of these makes a fine dessert, two would make a fine meal, any more than that and you might have problems. But that's good because stouts aren't supposed to be the sort of thing you drink by the case. Therefore, no docking of points in this category."
"."
"Drinkability is all right...this is my first cream stout and I wasnt too fond of the creaminess. But I will try another one to compare to."
"Considering what I find to be a pronounced hop finish, I'm not sure I would serve this with anything chocolate. It might cause the chocolate to appear bitter. On the other hand a good sweet, milk chocolate might help to mellow the hoppiness on the finish."
"Pours black with large brown head. I definitely taste chocolate, but not over sweet. Along with that I taste caramel, roasted coffee. Its all pleasent to the taste buds. For a stout the drinkability is amazing. I will revisit the beer again and agian."
"Overall drinkability is good but not great, largely due to the unpleasant aftertaste on this one. This was the first Milk/Sweet Stout I ever tried, and led me to try various others of the style that I liked better, but as a whole it's not nearly up to the standards of Mackeson XXX or Rogue Chocolate Stout. It's a great intro beer to anyone looking for the style, though, and I suspect that plenty of newbies who think Guinness is """too bitter""" might find themselves very happy with this."
"The mouthfeel here really complemented the flavor and added to the drinkability of the brew. There was a medium mouthfeel and perhaps a very even feel of a well carbonated commercial product. That may be the only drawback, but if I am in the mood for a stout again, I would certainly consider this. At least as good, if not better, than Guinness in my opinion."
"as the beer flowed from the bottle it created a beautiful dark, almost black pool im glass that was topped with a delightful tan head that had true staying power. Smell is an intoxicating mixture of chocolate, coffee, caramel, plums, prunes, raisins, and figs. Taste is superb, with just the right combination of roasted malt, coffee, and dark fruit. Finishes with a magnificent dryness to create a perfect ending. As you may guess, I really liked this beer."
"It's black, but not completely, with ruby highlights. Big tan head, excellent lacing. Smells like coffee with cream, and the taste is nicely balanced between bitter coffee and lactose sweetness. Mouthfeel was lacking, kinda watery, but the carbonation gave it a nice smoothness. I'm glad I was able to save a bottle of this--thanks go out to the girls for hating it."
"Pours a deep black/brown with a beautiful 2 finger creamy head that lasted the entire beer with good lacing. Aroma is woody, vanilla, and barley malts. Taste is woody roasted coffee, with vanilla and dark cherry notes and maybe a little milk chocolate. Rather sweet overall, could maybe use some more balancing hops, but I don't mind a sweet beer. Mouthfeel is rich and full-bodied, with medium carbonation. I could drink about 2 of these and the fulness would set in. I tasty cream stout here for sure, and a bargain at $5.99/sixer. Definitely worth a go."
"My first cream stout and I think that it is excellent. Keep up the great work Boston Beer Company. This is a beer that can be drank anytime of the year."
"Drinkability is not bad. This is a good slow sipping brew to enjoy with some chocolate cake, or a rich cigar. Another winner in the Sam Adams family of brews."
"Overall: I dont have a craving for stouts too often but when I do, I would consider buying this again. I was very pleased with this offering."
"Drinkability: Very good, easy drinking beer. Low alcohol content makes this one sessionable. I can usually find Sam Adams for $5.49 to $5.99 somewhere, and I will definitely have to get this one again. I recommend it. My new choice as best beer in the Sam Adams family of beers."
" Very well brewed not as complex as Kalamazoo Stout but certainly surprizing for a high volumn brewer."
"Dated Nov 05. Pours a very dark black/brown with a nice creamy head. Leaves a nice trace of lacing. Scents of chocolate, and roasted malt. I do like this better than a Guiness, but I guess Stout's are not my cup of tea. Medium body and I could drink two, but that's about it."
"Drinkability is good even with the carbonation and is much better than I remember it being last year."
"Overall: Enjoyable offering from a Brewery that can stagger off the path once in a while with over-priced and over-hyped brews as well as rather staid boring under-achievers. But I really enjoyed this one, one of their better brews me thinx - but Im no brewer and an English patriot so I guess my thoughts dont count for much here , but I know what I like and I enjoyed this one. No problems with recommending that you pick up a 6-Pack of these!"
"Serviceable stout, the gimmick is the load of cream in the head. The taste of the body was nonobjectionable, passable stout, drinkable. Drying, with some coffee grinds, burnst grounds, not much roastiness, much malt. Bit of graininess. Well carbonated."
"This Cream Stout comes from the Samuel Adams """Brewmaster's Collection""" and a lovely addition it is."
"Lactose, chocolate, and caramel up front, then it moves on to a more milk chocolate taste with the hops coming through at the same time. These flavors linger for quite some time in the finish"
"This beer pours black with very little light shining through. The head is brown. It fades slowly leaving very thick laces. It smells malty, with hints of chocolate and caramel. Also, slight hints of coffee. There is a very subtle hop aroma also. It tastes strongly of milk chocolate. It has a very slight taste of coffee also. It is not as sweet as I would expect, but it is still good. This beer is very creamy. It goes down quite smooth. It is carbonated very nicely. It leaves a coffee taste on the palate. This beer would probably make a good session beer because it is low in alcohol, and it is mild. This is not the best Cream Stout I have ever had, but it is still quite good. If you happen to see this one, you should give it a try. It is in my opinion, one of Boston Beer Company's better beers."
"Tastes wonderful, with a noticable hop bitterness. Once you get past the hops, the malt taste pokes through and reflects the smells. Medium carbonation makes this feel great in my mouth. This is one I like to keep on hand and drink a few of during the course of an evening. Not my favorite stout, but one of the better stouts to drink in session."
"The roasted notes dominate the taste. There's a hop inspired finish, but not much else. Nice milky mouthfeel. Sessionable if you're a fan of roasty beers."
"I recommend this beer, particularly to those who are interested in the Milk / Sweet Stout style. It's not the best example of it, but it's pretty damn good."
"This beer surprised me and I'm glad I have a few more in the frig. It is black in color and a nice creamy covering remained for the duration of the beer which provided some impressive lacing. The smell is what surprised me the most with lots of caramel and some milk chocalate aromas and just a hint of toast coming through all the sweet smells and did I say caramel, oh yeah. The taste is not quite what I expected, since I have been drinking lots of stouts lately, but I haven't drank any sweet stouts for a while, so it feels a little lighter in the mouth almost crisp. The English hops come through with a little bit of a leafy taste and also the caramel malts are strongly present. There is a bit of an astrigent roast taste, but not in a bad way. This may be one of the most balanced stouts I've ever had, which would make this an easy session beer. Surprised and impressed!!"
"The worst part of the beer is the appearance, and by worst I simply mean it is average. I compare the head on this to the head of some big name stouts, and it is lacking a bit. Head is lacy and clings well to the glass, but light overall for the style. Color has more red to the black than most stouts. Smell is sweet and creamy, unusual for a stout but very appetizing. Taste is very good. Slightly chocolaty, slightly fruity, very quaffable and drinkable enough to be a session beer - compared to stouts I have previously sampled is an exceptional quality. Almost a dessert beer, but sweetness is complementary to the flavor and not overwhelming. One of the Boston Beer Company's best!"
"Strong chocolate aroma - pours smooth with an average head that dissipates to a thin lacing. Bitter taste with a hint of strong coffee. More carbonation that your average stout - not the flat mouthfeel of a Guinness. Aroma and bitter coffee tast were a bit much for me. I prefer a smoother stout such as Guinness."
"Pours a very dark brown / garnet color that allows a bit of light to pass through. Topped off by a frothy head typical of Sam Adams. Very aromatic nose, lots of cream and chocolate. Milky smooth flavor with sweet chocolate balanced by roasted grain. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but overall, it is creamy and smooth. Probably my favorite Sam Adams offering."
"This is another strong offering from Sam Adams. Appears a solid dark brown color with a floaty beige head that lasts for a little while, but eventually fades. Smell is of dark fruits, a bit of chocolate dust and some coffee grounds. Taste includes those flavors and more, with a nice mellow milky creaminess thrown in there, hence the name perhaps. Fair amount of roasty malt, yet this beer has hardly any bitterness to it, with some sweet molases flavoring as well. Nice smooth mouthfeel, though maybe a little lighter than your average stout. A good one."
"Cream stouts aren't my preference, but there's nothing shabby about this beer."
"Disappointed. Expected a lot more from a milk stout. Initial take looked promising, excellent almost black pour with tan head, nice lacing. Aroma started the downhill slide, almost no maltly quality to it. The taste was the bottom of the barrel, way too hoppy, no smoothness or *cream* to the brew. Way too thin and carbonated. All in all, you can find better stouts out there."
"All in all, this is an enjoyable cream stout and it is a very drinkable beer. I will have this again."
"The aroma was mildly roasty with a whiff of graininess. The taste was better than the aroma suggested, with dry, creamy, roasty, chocolaty, and coffee flavors swirling around. This was very soft, and a little bit thin on the tongue. Smooth and easy to drink, but lacking in a lot of complexity."
"This beer has a typical stout appearance in that it is opaque. It pours a small head that stays around for a brief period of time. The smell is almost an exact replica (if smells is replicatable) of a mild coffee. I am not a big coffee drinker but I love the smell of fresh coffee and this is pretty close. If it looks like a duck, smells like a duck, it probably is a duck: this beer looks like coffee, smells like coffee, so naturally it tastes a bit llike coffee, possibly with a bit of milk or cream in it and maybe a piece of fine chocolate. An intense chocolate flavor lingers on the tongue in the finish. The mouthfeel was a bit heavy and sticky for my taste. This beer is quite drinkable and I enjoyed it."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer but not my favorite stout by any means. Worth a try but I won't be buying this myself."
"Pours a pitch black color with a large sticky tan head. Smells like coffee, bitter chocolate, and faint spicy hops. The burnt coffee malts hit the tongue first, soon followed but a dry chocolate flavor. Has kind of a salty aftertaste. The mouth feel is creamy and the drinkablility is great! What a great session beer!"
"Maybe this stout is a bit too dry for my taste. Otherwise, a fine brew."
"average."
"From the Brewmaster's 6-pack. 12 oz. bottle with purchase by Feb. '05 notched on the side. Pours into the imperial pint glass with a big 3 finger tan head that leaves nice clumps and lacing on the glass. The beer is black but not very thick - like a very dark porter. Smell is milky/creamy and sugary with chocolate, coffee, caramel, and a little bit of butterscotch. The flavors are chocolate, coffee, bitterness, dark fruits, a subtle sweetness and an overall roasted character. The body is light considering all the flavor. This pairs well with chocolate dessert."
"Got a real fresh six (notched July 2005). Pours a dark brown almost mahagany color with a tan head. Smell of chocolate and coffee malts give this brew an inviting aroma. Mouthfeel is pleasant, but a little thick. Slight bitterness from the foogles hops. Tastes of coffee and chocolate malts dominate this brew. An outstanding offering from Sam Adams."
"Uncle Hamish says: """Thais ais no wee brew lud! I'm bettin ye could run yer little grass tractor with ait.""""
"If you can find this in a six pack, dont hesitate to pick it up!"
"Good, good stuff here. Something I could mistake for a PNW stout if it didn't have such exceptional balance not only in regard to hops/malt but also in reference to the manner in which it affects the senses: equally across the board. Pours a very dark mahogany...lighter than some stouts; small and typical stout head with little lacing apparent. Smells of autumn...woodfires and harvest barley with enough hops to keep it lively. Taste is sublime: candied fruits give way to a tasty charcoal denseness that fizzles out onto the tongue with a slightly hoppy conclusion that fades ever so slowly. Mouthfeel may be a little thin for the style but the smooth, coating effect... a """creamy""" feeling if you will, is just stupendous. Great for an icy high desert night. Drinkability is wonderful, and as with most Sam Adams products this is a pleasure to quaff for all of the senses. Now I'm ready for bed."
"SA Cream Stout is black in color with a nice-sized, creamy head. Decent Brussels lace. The aroma is of roasted coffee with a touch of chocolate. I wish the aroma was more powerful. The taste is of roasted coffee flavors with sweet chocolate notes. Hops mainly come into play at the beginning of the sip, otherwise they serve as a balancing agent. The finish is when the chocolate flavors are strongest ending the beer on a sweet note. Very drinkable."
"This stout poured a very dark red-brown (almost black) with creamy, light brown foam that settled but coated the glass nicely. The smell was richly malty and hoppy with notes of licorice, chocolate, and coffee. The taste was very malty with coffee and cocoa flavors poking through and with a nice light bitterness in the finish. The malt and hops were nicely balanced. There was a hint of yeast in the flavor as well. The mouthfeel was dry and smooth with full body and good carbonation. The malty flavors lingered pleasantly on the palate. This was a surprisingly good stout. A bit more dry and lacking the hint of acidity often found in milk stouts, but a very good stout nonetheless."
"A fine meal in a glass..."
"Great brew, well balanced and generally just damn smooth."
"Smooth! No harshness from the dark grains. A slightly bitter, but enjoyable aftertaste. This beer is easy to drink...a real surprise in our stout tasting."
"A smooth drinkable stout, not the best but solid in all respects."
"Drinkablity is among the best of the beers i've had. Goes down very easy and leaves you wanting another."
"All in all, a very good and drinkable stout that gave me everything I expect in this style. I will definitely check it out again, and I think it has something to offer to dark-beer newbies and stout aficionados alike."
"Overall, it's a drinkable brew. I could definitely see myself getting to know this beer... having a few pints of it, that is."
"This stout has a slightly lighter mouthfeel than other stouts, and a bit more carbonated than others as well. All and all it had a pretty nice body to it and was enjoyable."
"Possibly my favorite BBC brew. This beer pours to a deep brown color that does not let much of any light thru. The head is a light tan color that has good resiliency and retention, which leads to great lacing through out the brew. The aromas from this brew are very pleasant, roasted malts with coffee and chocolate esters. They seem to have a nice balance and not overpowering. This is a nice tasting brew, as I said probably my favorite from BBC. The predominant flavor is of roasted malt with highlights of coffee and chocolate with hints of charcoal. You will notice the hops, it does not bite but offsets the sweetness perfectly. This is a nice brew, one that is a standby for the cooler months."
"This is a great beer. I look forward to winter because of this and Fezziwig! Sam Adams definitely has impressed me as an American beer company. I am partial to English Ales and lesser known American breweries, but Sam Adams overwhelms with this rich, black as night stout that is creamy in every sense. A wonderful beer."
"Thanks Sam Adams, for another exceptional beer."
"Pours an inky black hue (although still slightly translucent when held right up to the light) with a very small coffee-colored head. Rich nose of roasted chocolate malt, coffee, and a touch of licorice. Deep, dark taste of chocolate malt and slightly bitter hops, with an underlying brininess pervading the entire palate. Mouthfeel is nice and full, very rich and creamy. On the whole, though, it's a bit much and I had trouble finishing the bottle."
"Mouthfeel - I suppose it could be a bit thicker. It *is* a stout."
"A bit thin for a stout, otherwise this beer is great."
"Mouthfeel: There is a lot of body to this beer- especially, not to be snooty, but for the price. It has a great milky texture."
"Very, very nice stout - but not a milk stout. I like this a lot, but it's not at all sweet. The label tries to weasel out of it by saying it's """the cream of stouts""". Sorry, but I'm knocking a point off for misleading the humble beer drinker."
"Not bad, better than I expected. Somewhat thin (as expected), but nice flavor. Retained a foamy head throughout, and the last sip tasted better than the first. Has a powdery chocolate taste (much like the 8 ball I followed it with). Samuel Adams makes pretty good beers, just not as good as they claim!"
"An average stout re: drinkability. Worth a try if you like the style. IMO, without a doubt one of Sam Adam's best offerings."
"Poured a clear, dark burgundy with an off white head. The lack of opacity in this brew surprised me because stouts should never let even the slightest bit of light through. The head subsided pretty quickly and the aroma was very lacking in all that I desire from a stout. The flavor hit a little closer to home but was lacking in roasted character as well as malt complexity. Basically it tasted like a 1554 black ale from New Belgium with a touch more malt. Mouthfeel was bad as it tasted pretty thin and the carbonation was way to high. Not smooth, not creamy, this stout is not one i would ever buy again but i was glad that i only bought a single bottle."
"Beautiful dark brown color like dark chocolate. Thin head which dissipates slowly with moderate lacing. The smell was roasted malts with hints of dark chocolate. Slight sweetness to the aroma. Very good smell. Taste very slight bitter. Rather a bit light tasting considering the color, but very smooth. Definite chocolate notes. Mouthfeel was good as this beer sat well on the tongue. Well-balanced also. Overall, one I'd seek out again."
"Not quite a black as night color, there is a hint of red when held up to the outdoor light. The head was not very large but is leaving a bit of a lacing down my glass. Smell is good, hints of roasted coffee and chocolate. The taste is pretty similiar. The cream was evident at first but the hops are taking over as I drink the bottle. Mouthfeel is not too thick for a stout, a bit on the thin side. Drinkability is good as this is a nice tasty stout!"
"Drinkability/notes: An excellent and substantial cold weather beer, which exhibits a rich complexity. Perhaps not the best milk stout, but still well worth a try."
"This cream stout pours a nice dark black with some amber tones showing through the light. A small head tops off my pour and doesn't stay around long, but leaves some lace in its wake. Chocolate malt notes invade my nose as well as some coffee undertones. The smell is quite sweet and inviting, almost sugary. The first sip is also quite sweet with a nice chocolate malt flavor and a some hints of coffee and a little hops on the back of the palate. The mouthfeel is a little too thin for me..I prefer a bit more body to my stouts...but it goes down smooth all the same. This is a good drinking stout when you are not looking for something too heavy. Probably my favorite out of the Sam's brews that I've tried so far."
"Nice full beige head, good sticky foam. Opaque black in color. A complex nose: Toasted coffee with cream, and some bittersweet chocolate notes in the aroma. Smooth initial taste: creamy is the only adjective I can come up with. The carbonation is perfect: a little tingle, not fizzy. Fire roasted malt gives it a nice thick stout taste: more mellow, and better than Guinness, in my opinion. Well disguised hops round out the experience that lingers on the palate. Excellent!!"
"Drinkability  This was a nice Cream Stout that is light on the cream."
"an ok beer from sam adams. i think it is too thick. not to say i dont like a good dark beer, but this is a bit too dark for my taste. very creamy and cofeelike not horrable taste, but nothing exceptional either. not bad if nothing else to drink but i would pick up another sam adams beer before this one."
"A beautiful black beer, that has a nice rocky, tan head that leaves sheets of lace on my glass. The aroma of roasted malts and toffee are strong and inviting. The creamy texture and sweetness are well balanced with the roasted malts and hops that bite through at the very end. I may be biased, as Samuel Adams Boston Lager was my introduction into the world of good beer, so Samuel Adams brews have always been among my favorite brews. Though this beer is a bit heavy, it tastes so good, so I have no problem with it being a session beer on a night where I truly deserve a treat."
"I was very impressed with this beer. This one poured a very dark brown color with a great fluffy white head that stuck to the glass. The smell was very roasted with a roasted malt and nut scent as well as a slight hint of coffee. The taste was excelent and smoothe with a bit of toffee flavor and a underlying sweetness that was just right and not cloying at all. This a stout to use to convert people to better brews for sure."
"d"
"One of my favorite brews by Sam Adams....solid beer. I just wish I saw it on tap more often in the Boston area."
"All in all quite a drinkable beer. The light mouthfeel was somewhat surprising but it leads to a very drinkable brew that won't weigh you down. This is very reminiscent of Guinness' nitro-draught but with a much more pronounced coffee note and a wee bit more body (but all the silky smoothness of the nitro)"
"Otherwise this an excellent beer."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly, I could definately see myself putting a good number of these away."
"I'm impressed that this stout doesn't have the harshness tasted in other stouts. There is a cream-like quality to this stout. I can see why a friend spoke so highly of this stout. Too bad it only seems to be available in Florida in the mix pack. This is one of SA's better brews. Seek it out."
"Poured a very dark brown in color with some ruby tinges on the sides. Impressive dark tan-colored head persists and offers a decent amount of lacing of the glass. Aromas are excellent. Lots of coffee, toasted malt, smoke, and caramel. Flavor mirrors the aromas, but with a pinch of hop bitterness thrown in for good measure. Starts out sweet, the middle brings in a chocolate-covered toffee, and finishes with a snap of bitterness that quickly succumbs to the roasted coffee-chocolate aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good...it could be a bit bigger, but it does the job nicely. Creamy. A tasty night cap after a long post-wedding cookout."
"Poured a beautiful tar black with a nice thick tan head about 3/4 of an inch thick. Quite nice looking. The smell is very coffee and slightly dark chocolate. Very nice. The taste is absolutely excellent. I can think of nothing that needs changing. Faintly sweet coffee like taste at first that quickly turns to a bitter dark chocolate taste. A most excellent stout. Fairly easy to drink and just plain good! If you are fan of porters/stouts you really need to give it a try."
"Nice dark color and good head. Predominant smell is coffee, with some dark chocolate. Taste is mostly of coffee and bitter chocolate - personally, I'm not a huge fan and think it's a little too bitter. Good mouthfeel, pretty balanced. I've brought the drinkability score down a little because the finish is a little too harsh or bitter for me - not bitter in the good sense of an ESB, but rather too unpolished, like bad coffee. Overall, though, a fairly decent cream stout, if not one I would want to drink too often."
"nice a dark witha craggy tan head. smells malty with bitter coffee and faint dark chocolate. slightly burnt aroma. i'd like to see it be a little more pungent but it smells good. grainy and nutty with coffee and burnt bitter chocolate malts. some hoppiness to round it out. good mouthfeel, has a medium body with good carbonation. not a bad offering at all from sam adams, a bit on the lackluster side but good. a very easy stout, which certainly sometimes welcomed."
"Pours a nice dark reddish-brown into the glass, a nice tan head settles into a healthy lace. Smells incredible...chocolates, ground coffee, roasted barley, a slight fruitiness too. Taste: Silky-smooth, chocolaty, malty, and nice nice coffee tones & just enough hopping to make the presence felt. A nice gentle carbonation with a long delicious finish urges you to take another sip. Finishes brashly roasty witha java-like closing smack. Not too sweet for a """sweet stout", but just enough to make you smack your lips and say """Hell yeah!""""
"This a my first Cream/Milk Stout and I got it in the Brewmasters Collection. The color is a very dark black and the aroma has a burnt smell to it. There is a sweetness at first but is followed by a very burnt chocolate and nut flavor. Pretty light tasting for stout this heavy. Not bad!"
"This cream stout pours a moderately dark color. There was very little head formation. The smell is a mixture of both coffee and chocolate. The taste is a combination of a smooth mixture of sweety malty chocolate and coffee. A rather pleasant cream stout but nothing I would develop a craving for and rush out to the beer store to pickup."
"Very smooth and creamy mouth feel. Very distinct roasted taste with subtle hints of chocolate and coffee, medium body. Ends with a slight hop bitterness that is very welcome. As far as stouts go, I'd pick this over guinness (bottle) any day."
"This beer didn't pour as dark as most cream stouts, it was still a deep hazel that was not entirely opaque. It has a thick tan creamy head and smells of roasted malt and heavily of alcohol. The taste is relatively unimpressive, with the cream taste not being strong and the alcohol left entirely uncovered. This also doesn't feel that great in the mouth because it isn't very hearty. Still a good beer, thanks to it being a cream stout, but not great."
"Not bad, but not what I particularly look for in a stout. For a cream stout, though, right on the money."
"It's a stout I could drink for a long session and the best SA I've tried."
"Those who are quick to disregard SA on the grounds of the mass distribution of their Boston Lager need to sample this beer before they label the brewery as 'pedestrian'. I could go for one right now..."
"This is a very drinkable beer if you're into stouts (and you should be). The low ABV and easy going down makes this a good 'session' stout. While Guinness was my first stout, it led me to this one and I got stuck on it for a while. This is my first one in a while and it's still up there for me, I'll have to seek this out again."
"One hell of a beer for such a big company."
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown malts near black but the light makes it through this one my friends. Big heavily carbonated tan head nice and chunky texture to it forms little mounds leaves heavy lacing nice not bad at all. Aroma: Very nice cream texture, wow slight coffee espresso mix with soft creamy chocolate and a hint of lactic acid semi subdued hopping but nice subtle flowery mix in the background. Taste: A very very tasty balanced Cream Stout, awesome mix of dark roasted malts and with that creamy edge you just can't go wrong wow this is a winner. Sam Adams has been trying to come out as a macro in the past year pushing the light and crazy commercials and what not, but this Brewmaster's Collection is a gift to us original good beer drinkers. Mouthfeel: Creamy texture medium to full bodied but carbonation is dead on very smooth drinker here. Drinkability: Can't really be touched one of the best Cream Stouts I've tried in general great representation way too easy to sip on all day, nice brew. I am impressed great beer for any brewer good job to the folks at Boston Brewing."
"Sam Adams Cream Stout pours a deep dark brown, almost black, with a thick light tan head with staying power. Aroma is full of roasted malt, with some coffee, chocolate and sweet vanilla. Chocolate, coffee and malted milk dominate the taste with a bittersweet finish. A bit lighter than I would like on the palate, but that is a minor quibble. A smooth, nicely balanced, quite drinkable beer."
"I had high hopes for this beer but unfortunately the Boston Beer Co. didn't do it for me this time. The beer poured black in color with a condensed tan head that held together for quite some time. The nose was decent enough, very roasted. The taste however seemed very uninspiring to me. Quite watery in body. Roasted grains are noticeable and a definite coffee taste as well. Not much in the line of sweetness or creaminess which seemed odd given the name. A little bitter even. Quite a dry finish and forgetable as well. I'll stick with Mackeson."
"Drinkability: Probably my favorite SA product (I'd hazard their best bottled one, too). Damn this stuff is fine. I could see myself sessioning this beer. Probably the best _readily_ available cream stout made."
"Possibly the best beer that Boston Beer Company makes. A solid cream stout with a good lactose bitterness, and though I'd likely find others of this type before this one, I'd still have it again if someone handed me one."
"The smell was kind of plain for a stout. The taste was pretty good, with some cream somewhat apparent. It gives a nice mouthfeel and really opens up the drinkability."
"Sampled 1/15/04"
"Drink it at room temperature for sure. I started mine slightly chilled and was not impressed by the flavors. Upon reaching room temp it was a smooth beauty."
"I was quite glad to see this sixer at Jungle Jim's just north of Cincy. This beer is actually my favorite BBC product I've tried. It pours a deep rich black with a smooth tan head. Aroma was full of coffee/roasted malts. First taste didn't let me down. Tons of roasted malt was easily apparent, the fantastic flavor of coffee/toffee followed. A very very smooth stout that manages to avoid a thin mouthfeel. I feel this may be one of my favorite sessions beers if only it were easily available in Lafayette."
"this is one of the most drinkable stouts ive had...i could finish a 6pack of this pretty quickly..only complaint i have is paying 7-8 for a six pack for a low abv beer. it is a good beer to sit back and enjoy with a meal though."
"A very nice stout, good lacing the whole way. Good balance of sweetness without being sickening."
"Revisit: Maybe I got an off bottle, but I'm not seeing all the flaws I noted earlier in this brew. Still not OUTSTANDING, but not bad. Have to kick it up in mouthfeel and taste, I got some mild coffee and chocolate notes. Still a bit ragged and disjointed in my book though. There are still better stouts."
"Drinkability & Notes: Easy to quaff, by far one of my top stouts as I seem to have it around a lot. Also the fresh batches seem to have a bit more of a bite to them, try and find bottle of this when it is at its ripe point where the month is notched on the side  seems to be a bit more mellow."
"Notes: A very good stout. It's not too bitter and it isnt too sweet. it's just right."
"This is less aggressive than some of the outstanding stouts, but it is very well balanced and a pleasure to drink. It features a nice combination of medium/light black malt bitterness and medium creaminess without getting too buttery-thick or sweet. An exceptional """light""" stout, and session material all the way."
"It is black with a ruby tinge and a thin, tan head. There is roasted coffee and chocolate in the aroma. The body is fairly thin for a stout with chocolate, caramel, and coffee flavors. It sort of disappears in the finish. It is not a bad beer, but it is just average for a sweet stout."
"The beer as it splits from the bottle a deep black walnut color with some nice ruby high light, the head humongous, creamy in texture and a nice light chocolate brown with the lace forming a thick cover to conceal the glass. Lightly toasted grain aroma, sweet malt with hints of vanilla, quite a pleasant sniff, and start is sweet and thick with malt; top is middling to full in feel. Finish is judicious in its carbonation and the hops deliberate in their spicy bite, droughty aftertaste that is long lasting, a drinkable beer, but one I sample rarely as there are just too many great stouts and I sometimes forget that these are quite pleasing to the palate and worthy of a sample now and then."
"This wasn't a terrible beer, but not one I'll seek out in the future! I was disappointed, especially since I liked the Sam Adams Boston Lager I had last week so much!"
"Glad to see this getting some build up this year in the the Winter Classics and the Brewmasters Collection. I worry about this and Boston Ale getting neglected. You shouldn't overlook either."
"Overall, a good, drinkable stout - nothing really special, but one of the more available ones (that's also reasonably priced). It's no Shakespeare, but in this Bud Light/Miller Lite saturated world, it's good to have around!"
"sam cream stout, while still enjoyable, is not as big and bold as i once remember it. it starts out great, with a nice dark, dark brown colour with amber hints throughout. this is complimented by a big chunky tan head that's nice and sticky. the smell is quite thin here. chocolate and malt are apparent, but almost a backdrop to the main smell of, well, almost nothing. smells kind of watery at times. this medium to full bodied brew starts off smooth and a bit sweet and finishes dry with a smokey wood flavour that hints at a touch of coffee. nice. there is a tad too much carbonation here for a cream stout. this one is still good, but again, not as great as in the past, when it was seemingly a bit more adventuresome."
"note: Very sweet after a few sips and becomes more bitter."
"Sam Adams Cream Stout...when poured has a very nutty scent to it. At first this beer has a very strong coffee smell to it. But after a few sips, the coffee taste subsides and this beer is great! I am not a fan of coffee at all, but i dig this beer. Althought I can only drink one or two more of it before it would get to me..."
"I do enjoy this beer. It is flavorful and aromatic. I'd love to place it in a session with other cream stouts to see how it would compare side-by-side."
"Samuel Adams Cream Stout is decent, but I've never been a fan of coffee-dominant beer. Cut that part of the flavor profile back a few notches, bulk up the body a little and this would be a very good milk stout."
"Dark brown/black, creamy head, not too thick but inviting. Smells nice with big roasted malts with a hint of bitter chocolate and some charcoal. Flavors follow with roasted malts and another touch of charcoal. Mellow at first with a nice bite on the finish. A good easy drinking stout, one of Sam Adams better offerings."
"This pours a jet black with slight brown tints on the edges. There is a thick fluffy head with little lacing. The smell is a earthy blend of rosted malts and a slight coffee note. Taste is a burnt toffee with a creamy chocolate and mocha taste. Very nice blend of burnt malts and a touch of hops to round it out. The aftertaste is a sublte coffee taste with a milky smoothness. Very easy to drink and a nice silky brew."
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. I've come to have a rather jaundiced view of this brewery, seeing it as a macro with acceptance issues. I expected a really lame attempt at a stout. This is the first beer from the deep, dark recesses of my past that hasn't proved disappointing in the cold light of day. I guess I'll have to check out more Boston Beer Co. products (not the Light beer, though) and see if they surprise me too."
"Beef Notes: One of my all-tme favorites. This beer almost leaves me speechless. It's even one that many non-beer drinkers don't mind, and at $7 a six pack, you're not going to find better bang for your buck. I'll be drinking this for some time to come."
"As part of the the """Winter Classics""" case I can say that, along with the Old Fezziwig Ale, this is the best of the lot. A good daily drinking stout--not too heavy, sweet or complex; it still has enough going on to satisfy my stout cravings. Smoke, coffee, cocoa, a slightly bitter aftertaste, it would probably go well with BBQ and smoked sausages."
"Pours a mahogany brown with a thick tan head. Smells of roasted malts, coffee, baking chocolate, and ice cream. Tasted rich and creamy, the aromas follow up in the taste with soft, chocolate milk shake flavors and dry finsh. Good balance in the malt/hops and the carbonation is nice. This is a good drinking beer that hits the mark as advertised"
"Note: I think this is the only Cream Stout I've ever had, so I can only compare it to other stouts. I read that there are better out there, but this one is pretty nice!"
"Since quaffing this regularly in days past, I've certainly discovered far more appealing stouts. None-the-less respectable, and it's nice to see BBC is still making quality beer."
"Drinkability: As far as stouts go, this has to be my favorite so far. Goes down surprisingly easily."
"Poured into a pint glass, very dark, nearly opaque body, with a reasonable head, albeit not as dense as I would hope. Laces very nicely down the glass as contents empty. Thick coffee/malt essence, and the taste follows right along those lines. A good stout, but not a smooth as I expected from a cream stout, and doesn't quite measure up to a few other stouts I've had. Definitely worth your time."
"Pours a with a beatiful tan cascading head that holds up well. The beer itself black with ruby highlights. Strong sweet coffee aroma along with some roasted malt and chocolate. Taste is dominated by coffee & bitter chocolate. Some caramel maltiness pokes through as well. Not too complex here. This is thinner than expected, making this a fairly drinkable stout. Could use a bit more body but a fairly good stout."
"Enjoyed a 12oz bottle of this good Sam Adams brew. I was a little disappointed with the appearance. Poured a nice head but soon disappeared within a minute or two, but on the other hand, the lacing around the beer was there the entire time. Pour out a medium black in color. Smell consisted of coffee, chocolate, and some cream. Taste was quite good. Started out with some espresso/coffee then finished with some milk/creamy aftertaste, quite good. A good beer to sip on during the winter nights. I would recommend this beer."
"Go for it Sam, what are you waiting for?"
"burnt caramel with a fluffy coco head. roasted barley and chocolate notes on the nose. medium creamy body that stays full despite its lack of girth. soft roasted flavors accentuated with notes of chocolate. finishes dry and clean and very satisfying. this may be the most drinkable stout i've ever had. restores some of my faith in sam adams. my new favorite SA brew."
"Pours with a thick, namesake-y head, dark enough not to let any light through the glass. Excellent threading. Head is persistent, yellow/tannish and globby. Smooth mouthfeel and taste. Creamily thick but taste is a little thin. Tastes of malt (strangely, it says it uses unmalted barley...I have no explanation), coffee, and...I couldn't identify the sharp, dark chocolate until I checked the label, but it is there. Like I said, it is an excellent flavor but not exceptionally complex or rich. Very enjoyable, and I'd like another, but it is not one I'd drink to be overly philosophical about the taste. It's just good."
"A great stout that is full of flavor, very drinkable and won't knock you for a loop after a bottle or two."
"The beer pours a black color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is malty with a creamy finish. The taste is of roasted malts and black barley. It has a nice sweetness to it that tastes a lot like milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with medium carbonation. This is a fine drinking beer; a good stout."
"IThis is the second stout I ever had, way back in 1993 or 94....It is as good as ever today. I am glad they are still making it. A very good-looking stout that tastes great. Pours to a deep ruby/black color and creamy tan had that stays. Aroma is of sweet malt, roasted barley and chocolate malt with vanilla, butter cookies and maple. Flavor is a good balance of bitter and sweet with roasted coffee abnd dark chocolate and creamy flavors throughout. Nice full mouthfeel. Finishes roasty and bittersweet with a bit of dryness. A luscoius well made stout. I thought this was going to be mediocre. I was very surprised."
"The taste is very good. Full of dark and burnt malts witout being overly bitter. Big gobs of coffee, chocolate, and malt are followed by a nice cascade of slightly bitter burnt malts. Body and mouthfeel are on the medium-full side. An easy drinking stout and readily obtainable."
"Another from the 2003 Winter pack from Sam's. Poured a cloudy black in the glass and the head was healthy, large, and clingy. The taste was ...cream...coffee...stouty, if thats a word. Great brew from the BBC. Really smooth going down. One of Sam's better offering IMO."
"The head is medium-small, fast and tan. It collapses coarsely. The beer is pretty much black with dark brown/red highlights against the light. A very nice aroma of roasty, mocha chocolate. The light, roasty, bitter front passes through a fizzy yet thickish middle. Quite bitter on the finish, with a touch of metal. Bit of a smoky aftertaste. Overall, the taste was a bit of a let-down for me after the great aroma."
"Very dark brown, with a tinge of red if you hold it to the light. Tan head that dissapates rapidly. Aroma is fairly potent, comprising of coffee, roastiness and (to a lesser extent) malt and chocolate. Coffee is fairly evident to the taste, along with a rich maltiness. Hops are probably in there somewhere, but hidden by the malts. They balance out well. Goes down very smooth. Suprisingly good effort from Sam!"
"Notes: A fairly tasty stout, albeit a tad unbalanced..."
"It pours a brown-tinged tar color with a solid light tan head. The mild aroma is of smoke, sweet malt, coffee and chocolate. The creamy malt is loaded with a sweet coffee (with a good dose of Half & Half), chocolate and light smoky taste. A tea-like bitterness and a faint taste of limes offers a touch of citrus. This is a very drinkable stout!"
"Very dark brown pour with a medium beige head which collapses into a very rings of lace. Nose is bitterweet chocolate and roasted malt, but not very strong. Initial sip reveals a creamy and rich mouthfeel with just a hint of hops background. Taste echos the nose, and burnt coffee taste comes in at about mid glass. Seems a bit watered down for a stout. Finish is dry and somewhat bitter. This is one of my favorite Sam Adams offerings."
"Aromas of roasted chaff seem to promise some level of concentration, but on the palate it just sits. There is an adequate balance of roasted grain, sugar and bitter, burned coffee flavors, but they are dilute and uninteresting. The texture is watery."
"This is one of my favorites in the Sam Adams lineup... a soild black with a thin but persistent tan head... leaves behind a bit of lace. Aroma of chocolate and espresso. Rich flavor with roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a slight metallic note. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a medium body and low to medium carbonation. A good stout year after year..."
"a great beer!"
"Pours black with a just a hint of ruby color around the edges of my glass. Fluffy white head that settles to a nice ring of foam and some lace. Aroma of burnt grains and espresso coffee beans. The first sip is full of fairly intense roasted flavors. Hops play a supporting role here and are in the background. A fairly smooth and medium bodied stout. Much more of roasted coffee character than I remember and not as sweet. An odd flavor towards the finish that I can't express. Finishes dry and a bit bitter, with the bitterness coming from the roasted grains more than hops. Not as sweet a stout as it could be, but not a dry stout either."
"Dark brown/near black in color with auburn hues. Thick tan head that flattens out after the first sip. Aroma of chocolate malt, roasted barley and creamed coffee. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and carbonation is apparent. Flavors of roasted malt and barley add full flavor to the front. Hop bitterness emerges midway through. Finish has lingering flavors of coffee and a mild bitterness remains from the hops. Odd soy sauce like taste mingles with the flavors in the finish for an undesirable quality. Less sweet and a touch drier than I anticipated. With so many stouts available, this one doesn't rank as a favorite."
"Drinkability/Notes: Very drinkable for a stout; its bitterness and relatively light body make it almost refreshing. Maybe not summer barbecue refreshing, but it might be a good more-than-one choice for an après ski/cigar/fire kind of night. Not the heartiest stout out there, but quite tasty, albeit a bit bitter. At about 5% ABV it won’t last forever, but I might go back in a month or so to see if the hops mellow out a bit."
"it's even better on tap (sometimes available at Doyle's in Jamaica Plain - near the brewery)"
"Dark brown with small tan head and decent lacing. Smell is creamy smooth and slightly hoppy. Taste is same as aroma but it's much too weak. Mouthfeel too thin. This would however, make a good session stout. I'm just a little bitter because for 9$ a six, I was expecting more. Should have gone with their Double Bock."
"Drinkability: A solid stout, but not as creamy or soft as it should be, IMO. Worth trying at least once."
"pours with a fairly good tan head and an almost black color just a little hint of ruby brown in the bottom of the glass. sweet malty creamy aroma with hints of roasted grains and mocha. balanced taste and fairly smooth until you get the explosion of carbonation in your mouth. IMO this beer has too much carbonation and it takes away from the flavor and balance of this beer. some slight bitterness in the aftertaste, good but not one of there best."
"This used to be one of my regular stouts but I don't see it much in six-packs up here. A welcome part of the sampler..."
"One of BBC's better beers, I'd have to say."
"I've always been fond of this beer. My first favorite from this brewery and its status hasn't changed."
"This poured a black color with a caramel colored head that lasted for quite a bit. The smells of coffee and chocolate was evident, but not overpowering. The body was a little thinner than expected, but definitely had a soft texture on my tongue. The coffee and roasted malt jump out, and little bitterness is detected. Some chocolate flavors sneeked through after swallowing. A nice sweet stout, just wish the body was a little thicker."
"F"
"Deep, dark brown body, but paired with a very small, light brown head (bottle not 100%?). Smells of roasty-sweet malts, a little chocolate, and some hops. Taste is roasted vanilla, semi-sweet chocolate malts. Nice, slightly bitter finish. Creamy, medium-bodied mouthfeel, and very drinkable. The best SA product I've had so far? Yep!"
"A very nice and flavorful stout, that left me wanting more."
"Very small head very grainey intial smell a little cocoa on the 2nd very coffeeish on the third. First taste mocha like with a roasted coffee aftertaste, actually had sort of a thin mouthfeel, just thought there would be a creamier texture, texture even got a little harsh in the middle, settled down ok towards end. The names a little misleading but its a good enouh brew."
"Super dark brown nearly black color with a tannish thick medium sized head that retained well for a time, eventually fading to a solid skim. Lacing in ink blot patches and spots. Smell is roasty deep and sweetly and coffeeish with some chocolate and caramel overlays. Taste is more of the same, a smooth body with an overall sweetish dark roastyness with a dark caramel thats pretty nice and easy to handle. As the beer warms the chocolate tones appear more so towards the middle and finish with some coffee and hop bitterness. Feel is medium bodied with an overall creamyness that slides right down but has some carbonation along the way that doesn't fit with what flavors very well. A nice stout that would make for a good session beer."
"I tried this beer a long time ago and thought it was absolutely terrible. I bought the Sam's winter sampler pack, and my old nemesis was inside. I tried it again, and this time i thought it was a lot more palatable. I have never been a big fan of coffee, which this beer tastes like from sip to aftertaste. Still is pretty good, warmed me up on a cold Minnesota night..."
"This cream stout is completly black, some light will reveal a hint of amber around the edges. There is a nice sized tan head topping it off, with nice amounts of lacing coating the glass. The aroma is great, with strong chocolate/roasted malts doing the talking. As for the taste, it is dominated by roasted chocolate, with a hint of hops for good balance. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, fairly light bodied. Not a bad beer at all."
"Sam Adams Cream Stout. Yummm. This beer is excellent. I found a case on sale for 12.99 (yes, 24 bottles) that had an expiration date of NEXT month. Score one for the little guy! The beer pours a deep brown, almost black with a solid tan head that if poured correctly will last the entire glass. I find that this beer is much more enjoyable if allowed to warm up also. I reccomend keeping it in your fridge and then pulling it out about 30 minutes before to let it warm to a few degrees below room temperature. The beer smells of sweet coffee and chocolate. The taste is substantial, and there is a slight malt bitterness that gives it a backbone upon which it props roasted barley, choco, burnt nut and sweet sugar tastes. The finish is lengthy and full. This is world's better than Guinness and has a certain sweetness (not overwhelming in the least) that gives it a more full character. The best Sam A brew I've had to date."
"This might be an easier drinking stout than Guinness, as the roasted bitterness is much more accessible to your average drinker in this beer. I would see no problem in substituting this for Guinness while enjoying the classic stout accompaniment: oysters. My favorite Sam Adams beer."
"First, allow me to say that I drank this two months past its prime. Damn you Martignetti's! Nonetheless, this was a nice stout. Poured a black stout color with an adequate tan head. Aroma was of unsweetened chocolate, and roasted coffee. Not terribly strong smelling. Taste was of burnt malts, chocolate, coffee, and a bit of nuttiness. The burnt malts and hops gave it a bit of a zing. Still, this was a very smooth stout. The roasted flavor (almost like peanuts) remains on the palate long after. This is a really nice stout, and I wish I could have tasted it before its expiration date."
"This was actually a little better than I was expecting. Dark brown but not opaque with a medium thick and creamy beige head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is roasted coffee and is slightly smoky. Medium-bodied and creamy with a nice mix of coffee, chocolate and caramel in the flavor. It is a little on the carbonated side unfortunately. The finish is mostly bitter with coffee and hops. Overall this is an admirable attempt at the style by Sam Adams."
"I'm surprised it took me so long to try this and am even more surprised with the results. Poured from the usual SA 12-ounce bottle, it's dark brown with a tan head that lingers. Hints of chocolate and coffee make for a very pleasant aroma. The taste is full that wonderful roasted malt that lets you know you're drinking a real stout. This is a much better stout than I expected and one I'll happily drink again."
"Nice chocoalte/roast taste in it, with the right balance of hops thrown in for good mieasure. Sweet after taste. Feels great-creamy and smooth- in your mouth. Clean taste all around, very drinkable"
"I love this beer. Full of flavor. Rich. Creamy. Robust. Great dessert beer. I don't think I could drink this sittin' in my chair watching football, but I could easily drink it with some Rocky Road Ice Cream from Braum's. Mmmmm."
"Tasted: 09/19/03"
"Dark black color. Large foamy white head. Aroma is roasted malts and chocolate. A lighter bodied stout. Roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. Very smooth taste. The flavors do fade quickly. A very drinkable lighter bodied and flavored stout. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish in clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Wow, I am blown away. I never thought that this stalwart of the Boston Beer Co. would be THIS good.... where do I start? The amazing frothy, bubbly head? The insanely captivating chocolatey, roasted malt aroma?? The dense, balanced, and bursting with malt cavalcade of flavors??? Oh forget it - just go buy it. It's a no-brainer...a truly perfect stout. I had seven of these last night at the pub, and it's amazing that I waited this long to try something that has been out so long and is so widely available. I think I found my new favorite session beer. Excellent!!"
"The only thing I was not pleased with with this beer was the mouthfeel. It was a little less that I had expected. This was my first cream stout and it was great. A nice chocolate/coffe/creamy flavor. Much more mild than a normal stout but not lacking in flavor. Apperance is great with a large fluffy head that reminded me of a nice snowy christmas day. I think this flavor would go great in icecream."
"Beautiful dark chocolate color with lingering head. Nice coffee aroma with a taste that matches the aroma. Full bodied flavor with a decent, rounded mouthfeel, easy to drink.Suggests a good iced coffee with an excellent malt balance ...a nice brew to end the night."
"You will not be disappointed."
"Overall this is an amazing and often overlooked Sam Adams. It's not as astringently bitter as some stouts Extremely easy drinking with lots of full flavors. It almost reminds me of Mackeson XXX or Sammy Smiths Oatmeal, but taken down a notch. A must try, not your normal Sam Adams."
"Hmmm, roasty. Pours dark under a creamy fat malted milk head. Wonderful bouquet of black cherry ice cream topped with shaved dark chocolate, a couple espresso beans and a few black currants. Semi-chewy body transports a nice mocha flavor to the gut. A favorable black malt astringency stays behind to keep your buds company awhile. A tasty, easy draining stout and one of Sam's finest."
"Dark brown, nearly black. Head is light brown and frothy, but very small and runs away quickly. Aroma is bitter chocolate and espresso coffee, with hints of raisin. Flavor is of roasted malt and molasses, with a coffee finish. Not as bitter as the smell would suggest. Smooth mouthfeel with low carbonation. Uneven lacing comes down the glass. Reminds me more of a porter than a stout. Decent beer, but perhaps not my first choice."
"Pours out thick, black, and creamy...however, I was not impressed with the aroma. It smelled of bitter dark chocolate, but had an acrid metallic-ness in the nose as well. Nothing really seemed to stand out in the flavor. Decent chocolatey maltiness, but hops were tough to find. An average stout."
"Deep and dark brown color with a finely rising rocky head of 1/2 an inch and coating lacing properties. A sense of mocha and milk to the deep aromas rising on a swirl. Mellow and thick chocolate and toffee begin the malt assertion -- a roasty and smoky bite does most of the balancing here with little noticeable hops. Nice full finish with a broad and pleasant sweetness to the aftertaste. So, I STILL wonder what Lock thought was missing."
"Nice pour, velvety smooth in the mouth with a nice smokiness and a hint of chocolate. Eminently drinkable with a nice aftertaste. I tend to prefer my milk stouts a bit sweeter, but I certainly wouldn't trun one of these down. Nicely done. I just hope it sticks around..."
"Poured black as the ace of spades with a beautiful white head. Head faded quickly but lace struck on the glass. Rich malty flavor with an adequate amount of hops to balance. Very complex and drinkable at the same time. A pleasure to drink and one of my favorites from Sam Adams."
"I had in my mind , for some weird reason, that this would not be a good beer..happy to say I proved myself wrong"
"ABIA 2003: sweetish start, with some nice roasty coffee in the finish, medium bodied, lightly creamy texture, nothing extravagant, but solid, a very drinkable stout, in away i was surprised that the finsih had a bit of length, quite OK by me, and better than a lot of stouts from the bigger brewers."
"This was a really nice little stout. Poured a deep brown that, unlike many stouts, actually looked brown, not black, to me. About a quarter-inch of cream-colored head when poured in a pint glass. Light scents of malted milk balls (which reminds me, I should eat some Whoppers soon) and coffee beans. This beer starts with a creamy, almost chocolate-milk-like taste and feel and carries a roasted flavor to the slightly bitter finish. Pretty easy to drink, all around. It's not terribly full-bodied for a stout, but as a cream stout, you kind of expect that more milky texture anyhow. Very well-executed beer."
"Deep brownish red. Thin off white head and lace. Nose of roasted barley, coffee and hints of chocolate. Medium bodied, creamy, pleasant malts, caramel and roasted barley, hints of chocolate and coffee. Tangy hop finish. Careful, this stuff goes down like a milkshake, it's that smooth. This is not bad."
"Pours a dark dark dark dark brown with a nice big head. Nice roasty and burt malts. Hops balance the beer well so it is not overly sweet. Good creamy mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. It's nice to see an American macro like sam adams brew quality beer like this. A very good stout."
"This cream stout poured a velvety black color with a medium sized sandy brown head which dissapated to a thin film that stayed the length of the beer. Sweet roasted chocolate malt aroma, a little chalky and a tiny hint of chemical smell also. Very thick rich mouthfeel with low level carbonation. Awesome roasted taste, mostly mocha with toffee and unsweetened cocoa, with a slightly bitter finish. Lace clung to the entire glass all the way down. A very delicious stout that left my motuh watering for another."
"Very decent sweet stout. It poured black with a pretty fair sized tan head. The smell was dominated by a sweet melted chocolate and malt aromas. On first taste there was a fair bit of toffee and coffee as well with the chocolate becoming a little more bitter. My only complaint was this may be a tad too chalky in the mouthfeel, but overall this was a very drinkable stout."
"What a highly drinkable stout this is....pours pretty dark brown, almost opaque, and a moderate tan head dissappears quickly. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth with a chocolatey malt flavor. A slightly sharp bitter coffee comes in on the finish. I enjoy this stout very often, always a perfect session stout."
"This is a beer that I revisit a lot. A very good offering from BBC, in my opinion."
"The apperance is very nice! It's a nice dark black color, with a creamy head. The head tasted, and I know that your going to think that I am crazy, but it kind of tasted like blood. The actual beer itself was very nice too. It was a little bitter at first taste, but mellowed out quickly. Is this stuff actually brewed with milk? It kind of has a milky/creamy taste to it, so I would think so. The aftertaste was of a chocolatey origin and also, clung to the tastebuds in my mouth. Since it's a cream ale, it coated my mouth pretty good and left a lasting taste. It's my first cream ale, but I would rank it pretty high."
"Poured a very, very dark brown, on the verge of black, with a tan head of foam. The smell is of roasted coffee and chocolate that is pleasant to the nose. The taste was of a roasted coffee and semi sweet chocolate and a grainy malty flavor. This was a well balanced and complex cream stout. I will say, that this is one of the better cream stout's that I've tasted so far."
"Pours a deep, dark chocolate brown with a minimal tan head that fades to a spotty layer. Coffee and dark chocolate are the aromas jumping out at me. Taste is also coffee bitter. Notes of chocolate and toasted malts too. Smoky aftertaste compliments the other flavors well. A little thinner mouthfeel that I had hoped for, but smooth none the less. The best Samuel Adams offering I have had and I will buy this one again."
"Cheers"
"What an awesome brew! Poured a deep black color with an extremely fluffy cream colored head. The smell was of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. I even picked up on some maple syrup in the aroma. The chocolate and malts come through the most in the taste. With a coffee flavored aftertaste. This beer is especially smooth and creamy just as the name would suggest. This was the first time I've tried this great brew and there is no doubt it will become a regular."
"The color was rich and deep dark blackish-brown. Fluffy tan head rests attractively on top of brew. Aromas and flavors of sweet milk chocolate and coffee consume the senses. Very well balanced. Body is medium-heavy and carbonation is very very light. No discernable bitterness--just a smooth drinking cream stout that anyone will enjoy if sampled. One of my favorites from BBC."
"Nearly ink black with a little ruby red around the edges, clear with medium carbonation...forms a nice tan 1""" pancake head with a peak in my pilsener glass, leaving brussels lace with each gulp, despite thinning 1/2 way through (A gentle swirl brings it back). Aroma is cocoa powder, sweet butterscotch, caramel, and a subtle grain note. Hops are to the minimum in the nose, but this brew smells quite delicious. Taste starts out with espresso, malt, some mild flavor hops, and vanilla then works it way into a nice burnt, black patent/roasted barley bite with a long bittering-hop finish. Has a nice firm mouthfeel despite it's rather light body. Hadn't had this beer in over 5 years, so it's a pleasant trip down memory lane. Light body, lack of off-flavors, rich flavor and moderately-low alcohol contribute to this brews excellent drinkability. It gets even better as it warms...good for conversation! Sammy done good!"
"Dark brown if not blackish hue, a fingers worth of tan, rocky head, excellent retention, admirable lace. Powdery coco and sweetish malt represents the nose, inviting. A nice quaff, subtle (but not weak) roasted malt, day-old coffee, smoky-bitterness meshes with sweetness. A surprisingly acidic finish (nice!). Balanced enough. A thinish body is not a deterrent. Drinkable, Ill knock back this one again. This Stout is very enjoyable, granted its not World Class but try one!"
"This beer pours almost black with deep mahogany highlights, topped by a rocky tan head that fills my pint glass. The head slowly fades, leaving a thick, sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is of roasted malt and caramel, with a hint of hops. The taste is mild and sweet, with some roasted coffee notes and good bittering characteristics. A dose of caramel is in there as well. The finish is very clean, with just a touch of bitterness and sweetness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and a bit refreshing for a stout, yet on the thin side. This is a surprising beer from Boston Beer. One of their better offerings and well worth the price for a sixer."
"I had seen this beer on the shelf, but had never tried it until today. Pouring reveals a reddish brown brew that's finished with a frothy brownish tan head. After pouring, the appearance changed to a very dark brown. I felt it had a slight caramel smell and the first taste had a slight bitterness aftertaste. Each drink felt smooth, slightly silky, from beginning to end. I liked this beer and being a dark beer lover, I can definitely recommend this and I will make an effort to drink these in the future, and tell my friends of it."

"Pours a deep dark brown hue with a thick tan head. Solid roasted malt backbone with a little bit of sweetness and a little bit of bitterness. An old standby beer. Great for lovers of stouts & porters."
"Samuel Adams Cream Stout Special Stout borders on being superlative."
"Sam Adams does not miss with this one."
"Dark opeque look with a thin white head (not lasting or thick).  Roast cocoa nose.  The taste has upfront bitterness followed by a sweeter finish with cocoa notes.  The beer seems to be lacking (smoothness) slightly in the mouth.  The stout is good but not overwhelmingly impressive."
"edit: This brew matches exactly the BA description of this style: http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/82/"
"Dark ruby in color.  A slight beige head recedes to an edging rather quickly.  Pretty heavy powdered cocoa aroma.  Mild chocolate is right there as well.  Silky smooth in the mouth.  Very creamy.  Lacing sheets the glass nicely.  Taste is comprised of bittersweet chocolate, very slight lactic sourness and some subdued java tones.  A light coating of sugary residue is left on the palate.  Body is about medium.  Overall, this isn't a half bad stout.  Not as great as a Bell's, but nothing to pour down the drain either."
"Smooth on the drink, first impression is the chocolate and roasted grain, yielding in a few seconds to an initial coffee surge. That yields to a slight bitterness which doesn't really dry the mouth per se, just clears the way for this great resonating coffee finish, unlike the first. It's hard to explain, but the second coffee hit sort of combines with the olfactory after-processing of that first whiff. Sort of like the lingering smell of a freshly roasted bag of coffee beans, that smell is kinda in your mouth along with the taste, a great sensation I haven't experienced before. Maybe due to the reasonable alcohol level which doesn't clarify one taste component over another, but lets them meld happily."
"A far cry in style from Mackeson's....this seems more like a coffee stout...it is very good, but hardly sweet....brownish black in color....nice lacing along the glass as you drink...nice tan little head to start things off...nose is burnt malts and java....body has a nice bit of carbonation (about perfect)....the flavor parade starts with huge bursts of coffee....followed by some burnt malt....smokiness...and earthiness follow and it finishes with a nice dry bite from the burnt malts and underlying hops...this is a very good stout..just not a """sweet""" stout...."
"pours out black, nice foamy light brown head that sticks. smells wonderfully gentle....nice chocolate malts overtones with a touch of hops. very inviting. tastes great....more chocolate malt with a very light earthy/smoke tease in the background. a touch of hops. a lack of bitterness makes for a nice smooth velvety mouthfeel, although the body is a bit light compared to other """heavy""" stouts. due to the fact that you aren't hit over the head with huge and complex flavors and overwhelming bitterness (and relatively low ABV), it is extremely drinkable and i had no problem putting a six pack down over the course of an evening."
"Near opaque brown with a creamy mocha head that leaves abundant lace. Strong toffee and chocolate aroma, roasted malt and a hint of hops. Delicious aroma leads to delicious flavor! Intense roasted malt, almost a burnt flavor. Chocolate and coffee stand alongside this, with bitter and mildly fruity hops in tow. It seems that much of the bitterness is provided by the roasted malt, in a very coffee-like way. Hops provide an excellent reinforcement to this. This would be wonderful to use in chocolate desserts, and of course pairs beautifully with them. However, this fine stout needs no pairing to provide great satisfaction and enjoyment. A bold and impressive stout that is a favorite of mine in this style."
"Pours black with a tan head. Also, nice smell, sweet, malty, and a bit like warm milk, but in a good way. It tasted like malt, charcoal, toasted grains. Quite balanced with a little hops at the end. Very smooth in the mouth, from soft carbonation and firm body. Very good stout."
"Over all a good stout. Nothing spectacular, but good."
"Pours very dark brown with foamy beige head, and lace all over the glass. Roasted aromas with hints of chococolate and and coffee. Flavor is the same, roasted flavor with hints of chocolate. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel, goes down real nice. Delicious and more drinkable than other stouts."
"black as night with creamy brown foam jumping all over the glass. smells chococolatey and roasty. flavor is much the same. it is creamy smooth with a chocolate in the backround with an overall very roasty taste. it is simply delicious smooth and ohhh damn"
"Ed's Note: From my Christmas '01 Boston Trip."
"It is an okay no-brainer stout.  Availablity is a plus."
"Color is intensely dark brown with ruby highlights, topped by an impressive, dense tan head. Although it cannot hold, the head reduces to a consistent rim around the glass and produces some nice Belgian-lace throughout the pint. The aroma is welcoming, and full of sweet dark malts: dark toffee, bitter chocolate, fresh cream and honey, and a soft roastiness not unlike spent espresso grounds. The full mouthfeel and gentle carbonation separate this beer from the chaff.... silky-smooth, velvety, almost oily - similar to, but fuller and more solid than a nitro-beer. The flavor is not complex, and balances between the front and middle of the tongue - light and creamy coffee atop bittersweet chocolate; all the while backed by a restrained bitterness that caresses the back of the mouth. The finish is creamy and just slips away. Really a unique beer. Not confrontingly sweet as many milk / sweet stouts are. Quite the gentle, introspected, giant. Very well done."
"Sam Adams Cream Stout: Very thick, dark chocolate beer. Not much or lacing, barest hint of Irish Rings. The aroma is not unpleasant but is very much cocoa, as is the taste, with hints of sweetened espresso in it as well. It is very smooth, and somewhat easy to drink, although it almost gave me heartburn because of its sweetness. Long lasting tastes of coffe. Not my cup of tea."
"This stout is good, but rather mundane.  Pours out to a nice dark color with little to no head.  Taste is that of roasted malt, coffee and molasses.  However, there are so many brewers that make quality stouts today, so this one, while good, isn't the best."
"A fine beer. Whenever I have it I seem to find that one is enough, but that one is well worth having."
"Nice frothy head. Seems overly carbonated. Burnt chocolate, slightly sugary. Had hints of ~maple~. Nice creamy and smooth. A bit dry on the finish which was a suprise."
"Quite attractive in appearance-- the tan head exhibits good retention, and the brew is very dark and clear garnet in hue when held to light. The aroma is a combination of both roasted malted barley and sharper unmalted roasted barley notes. As the brew warms, hints of caramel and toffee become perceptible, but definitely aren't dominant. Sam Adams Cream Stout doesn't have a particularly rich and complex flavor profile, but all the desired roasted malts are there and well integrated. Medium in body. The fairly high residual sweetness is well balanced by a semi - sharp roasted barley bitterness and a welcome hop bitterness. This is another well crafted Sam Adams. The best (and only as far as I know) mass produced stout. It's got lots of flavor for a relatively low alcohol brew."
"Handsome black stout, just barely translucent at the bottom of the glass. Pours to a big fuzzy head which sadly dwindles to a thin layer. Not sweet at all in my opinion, nice burnt malt flavor with a very successful mellow hop balance. This is not as versatile as some stouts but is plenty enjoyable on its own. Not creamy either, but this is explained on the bottle. My only qualm is it is almost flat tasting - despite, or maybe because of, the big head at the pour. Also the flavor disappears after you swallow - no aftertaste. Some might consider this a good thing, but I like a tasty beer to linger."
"Has a great smell too."
"I actually don't have this anymore. It rang such a note with my particular tastes that I nearly burnt myself out on it. This review column might entice me to revisit. Slightly sweet with some nice roasty-ness and bitterness, hints of chocolate, very drinkable without the cloying stickyness of many sweeter stouts. Nice work ...worthy note: the beer remained very consistent too over the course of my """relationship""" with it."
"loved the mild sweetness,not to heavy and great head!Had no trouble drinking 6 of these wich is strange with me and stouts,again would love to have on tap!"
"I ordered this mainly because there was nothing else I wanted, and was very pleased with my good fortune. Beautiful, pitch black with a tan, creamy head (though it did not last as long as I would have liked). Smells of chocolate and espresso. Very creamy and smooth going down, with a complexity of mildly sweet flavors (caramel, molasses, chocolate), slightly balanced by a mildly bitter coffee taste. Fairly low alcohol, so it makes a nice session brew."
"Pours an opaque brown with a rocky head that sticks before eventually dwindling to a nice lace.  Smells of coffee and chocolate.  The taste is great.  A mocha flavor that finishes clean with almost no aftertaste.  Smooth mouthfeel as the beer rolls across the tongue and palate.  One of my favorites.  I can drink this anytime with anything."
"A nice mildly-sweet stout.  Prominent coffee notes with an Irish-style smokyness in the finish.  Perhaps a little too much biscut at the very end.  Overall it is fairly reserved, but lends itself quite well to smooth drinking."
"This brew has a lot going on flavor-wise but they seem to blend extremely well. Sort of reminds me of Watney's (what ever happened to that?). Smooth and hearty. A nice desert accompanyment."
"Very deep dark brown color with a big foamy head that disappeared quickly leaving little lace.  Malty, big coffee and bittersweet chocolate aroma and taste.  Not too sweet.  Creamy and finishes great with a great aftertaste. For the price; this beer is a treasure.    Cheers!"
"a nice stout but the head retention was dissapointing. it dissapeared to a thing ring that left little or no lace. tastes similar to iced coffee."
"Label says """Specialty Stout," however this falls nicely into the sweet stout category, which also includes cream stouts."
