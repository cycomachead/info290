"This beer is one of Breckenridge's better offerings.  It's basically a milkshake with alcohol.  You definitely taste the cream and the chocolate up front, and it's pretty smooth too.  Seems like they do their best work with the darker beers, as I'm also a fan of the Vanilla Porter and the Oatmeal Stout.  This is a small-batch offering sold in 4-packs, so if you find it, pick some up if you like this style."

"3/3...pours very dark black, light ring of tan foam. Dark chocolate nose, espresso coffee too. Hearty creamy taste, bold coffee bitter swirls into creamy milky smoothness. Not unlike chocolate milk. Beyond smooth, loaded with flavor."
"Brew pours pretty close to a pitch black in color with just a hint of ruby-highlights near the top. Close to a 1-finger foamy beige head is seen. A good amount of ring-lacing is seen after each sip. The aroma is very nice and is of sweet chocolate and dark roasted malts for the most part. Bit more going on with the taste with some milk, sugar as well as a light hint of coffee in the mix also. Very smooth with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Medium-bodied with lower carbonation which most milk stouts have. Really tasty and would drink this again!"
" I wouldn't run right out and buy again, but glad I bought. Would like to try this fresh on draft."

"A solid beer, to say the least."

"Overall - This was a surprisingly good beer, highly recommended. There are a lot of good ones out there in this style, and I would highly recommend this one. Its worth your time and money."

"Good beer, worth buying to try it, but not worth $6 for 12 oz."

"Big flavors wrapped up and nicely joined together with a creamy smooth, velvety package. I'm not sure what kind of barrels were used for the barrel aging, but it seems like a bit of bourbon. Whatever the case, the barrel aging quality is subtle, adding to the basic sweet stout styling without stealing the show with too much alcohol heat and woodiness. Deep, complex, and well-balanced throughout. A very nice stout."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good. I'd likely get it again."
"Poured a black body with one finger head and some lace.  A chocolatey, milkey, aroma with some roasted malts.  Beer is light to medium bodied, smooth, a little sticky, combines some chocolate and roasted malts with a milk presence and retains a good amount of sweetness and balance.  Pretty solid milk stout."
""
""
"Tons of sweet chocolate, honestly it's like dessert beer. Perfect at the right time and place."
""
""
"Sweet stout with a little chocolate bites. Awesome beer if you just want to relax after a cold day."
""
""
"On tap at World of Beer. Thick, luxurious and very dark. Smell is dominated by sweet mocha and cream, coffee and a mild roast note. Taste is similar, sweet, creamy with a bready, roasty finish. Mouth feel is superb, very thick and velvety. Fits perfectly with the style. A great desert beer, all aspects in balance and not overpoweringly sweet. Thumbs up!"

"Totally surpassed my expectations. Light body, but a great beer overall"
"For drinking multiples at a party?  No.  For sipping after dinner or as a nightcap?  Hell yes."
""

"The reviews are not accurate for this beer; I've had just about the best stouts out there, this stout taste almost like Founders Breakfast Stout. It's great."
""
"I really like this. There is coffee and some nut at first, but ends with a very sweet taste. The smell is superb. It certainly is sweet in the finish, and I couldn't see myself drinking these back to back. But it is a great sipper, for sweetness rather than strength. It's wonderful and smooth; a dessert beer. I'd certainly drink it again."

"Very dark with a strong 2 fingers of surprisingly light head. Smells a bit sweet, almost malty. Taste is way sweeter than I was expecting...and almost nothing else. Almost too sweet by the end of the glass. Feels thicker than it should be. Finish is actually a very nice coffee taste. Looks good, smells good, finishes good, but the taste is a bit lacking."

"on tap at the brewery, i was really impressed with this one. a deep dark stout, not overly sweet from the addition of milk sugar, and not overly chocolaty, but the contributions of both make this beer unique. i like that its not overdone there, lets me drink a stout first rather than a flavored beer like their vanilla porter is, the accents are subtle, and the beer is rich without being too sweet. dense matte black brown in color with just an inch of tan head in the stubby tulip. the nose is dark roasted malt with a hint of cocoa and coffee there, but definitely grain first, the flavor is similar, but instead of a dried powder cocoa on the chocolate side, its more of a melty dark chocolate, still bitter, but much more silky and decadent. the body here is only medium and the alcohol doesnt show through at all. i really like this one in a holiday context, think its far better than some of the other breck beers, and would rank it up there with the best chocolate beers around right now. sturdy without being filling, very well put together here."

"Great look to this beer. Completely black with no light at all. Finishes with a chocolate taste and hints of coffee overall. Poured a 2 finger head. Surprisingly has a slight spice feel on the mouth but still remains smooth."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good beer. Nothing to rave about, but it's good. Not sure I'd go out of my way to find it, but it it's there, I may pick some up."

"Pours an opaque brown black with a frothy mocha head that lingers. Chocolate and cocoa counter nutty and roasted malt in the aroma. There's a touch of dark fruit tartness, and a hint of tar. Flavor is on the sweet side initially, with chocolate melding with light tart cherry underpinnings, finishing slightly roasty and a touch bitter. Nutty, toasted malt waves throughout, but chocolate sweetness rules the day. The tart character prevents it from being cloying. A little short on the roasty stout character and heavy on chocolate. Guilty pleasure of a beer."

"Mouthfeel: Clean up front, lingering sugar toward the back, and dry in the very back. Carb is fairly light."
""
"O: milk/sweet stouts are not a style I often go for, but the idea of an ""imperial chocolate cream stout"" was very inviting. Great body and feel, perhaps a little too sweet, but then again, I knew to expect that; decadent sweetness and chocolates in creamy black ale - like an ice cream float. Great dessert ale."

"It has a richness to it and has the body of an imperial stout, big and full. It's thick, but not terribly heavy. The robustness is felt as well as the roast, as it leans toward the dry end when wood and underlying roasty effects kick in more strongly than sweetness from middle to finish."

"This is a very simple beer but it's good, lives up to the supposed style, and yields a satisfying drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Like I said new to stouts so this was a new taste for me. Not my favorite but not the worst I've ever had. The smokiness up front was different but had a nice subtle chocolate taste to finish off."
""
""
"O - Amazing stout, as it warms it surprises every sip. Amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - My opinion is semi-biased, I loath licorice with a burning passion, any trace of it, which it is potent in this one, ruins my palate. Aside from that its too sweet, a little boozey, and lacking on balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very good beer that exceeded my expectations...Didn't think it was going to be as ""sweet"" but you adapt very quickly to it. I would pick it up again but to have more than one in a row is a real question to ask yourself. Salud!"
"Pours a near-black with minimal chocolate covered head that disappears quickly, leaving no lacing. A surprisingly muted aroma of roasted chocolate malts with coffee tones. The flavour is more robust, with a nice blend of chocolate milky creaminess and coffee grounds' bitterness in the finish. Roasted dark and chocolate malt tones in the body transition nicely from caramel sweetness to hop bitterness. There's enough dark and milk chocolate flavours to suit the name without being cloying. Mouthfeel is oily, as befitting the 7.2% ABV, but increased carbonation would help my personal enjoyment of this bottle."

"O - This is a good beer. Cheers!"

"O: This beer is a decent representation of the style. It has a good amount of lactose and some added flavors of roasted malts to lend complexity."
"This is a creamy, tasty stout that would taste great all by itself or with a chocolate and/or nutty dessert. The sweetness isn’t overbearing and the flavor offers some good contributions from several complex tastes. It’s a little more alcoholic than its taste would lead you to believe, so you do need to take this one seriously. It’s a solid, tasty stout all- around and one that should satisfy the stout lovers and others among us."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark black with a light brown head. Smells of coffee, vanilla, and slight chocolate. Tastes of chocolate and coffee, nice balance, with slight berry and vanilla. Beer is carbonated well, and for its full body, it goes down smooth. Overall, a very good beer."

"Poured into a 12 oz tulipish glass. Pours a slick black, with a half inch of tan head, that leaves nice place and takes its time settling. Smell is dark chocolate, coffee beans, hints of tobacco, and maybe a little leather. Taste is mainly chocolate and coffee. Body is medium, perfect carbonation, a little dry, and awesome drinkability. This was really nice, a fairly session able flavor able stout."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"This was probably the beer I was looking forward to the most. It pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, cocoa powder, sweet coffee, and a hint of vanilla bean. The taste brings in more of the same, though the cocoa is a tough more bitter now; it's not quite dark chocolate, but it definitely seems to approach that designation. Meanwhile, the roast takes a stronger role, and the vanilla nearly vanishes. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a solid stout, one that doesn't overdo it with the chocolate and yet still maintains a healthy dessert-like quality. Good times."
""
"Taste is nutty chocolate with a dusty finish....wierd. Roasty for a milk stout and does not have enough sweetness to call itself a ""Chocolate Cream Stout"". The flavors are all over the place and never really come together coherently. Mouthfeel is not an issue here as it displays a full body and low carbonation. Not sure what it is, but I do not like this beer very much. I am going to have trouble finishing my 4-pack. Wont buy again."
""
"The taste is good, with immediate chocolate and sweetness, but more than anything there is booze. For only being 7.2%, this tastes incredibly boozy, crowding out some of the flavors that should be there. You get hints of cream and vanilla, but I would like them to be winning the battle with the alcohol, which they are clearly not. The feel is good, and I would drink this again, but I think I would wait a little bit for the alcohol to mellow."
""
" A very delicious stout, sweet with the taste of a dark chocolate"

"O: I really liked the aroma here - wish I could say the same about the flavor profile and palate feel. While it's not bad, it doesn't come together nearly as well as it should."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Complex and a bit messy. Don't need my beers this sweet. Want some heavy cream cheeses, and smelly rind to go with this. Dessert beer - yes! Winter - beer - Yes! Tastes like an aged stout…. Not as good as Youngs Double or Imperial Stouts I have tried."

"An agreeable enough milk stout, the alcohol well sublimated, and thus a certain balanced attained. However, there just doesn't seem to be that certain complexity that might carry this higher and farther into one's good graces."
"Surprisingly good chocolate beer from Steve in Warren. He added this one in July 2012 and I received in December. Really nice chocolate pudding flavour, that went well with my chocolate brunch. Dark chocolate bodied with a nice head. Very drinkable. One of the better ones I have had from them."
""
""
"This brew has a slight tan head. Color is dark brown with crimson edges. Has a distinctly vanilla and milk chocolate aroma with black coffee and plum playing lesser roles. Tastes of palpable dark/milk chocolates, roasted nuts and dark fruits. Has a nice bitter finish that was a bit unexpected, but quite welcome. A subtle, contrary woodiness is noticed deep down, and the rebel in me digs it. Medium to heavy with a full on creamy body that lives up to its name. Has an abundance of alcohol heat but smooth overall. Mikey likes it."

" The flavor is good with nice chocolate notes and some caramel malt backing with a mild hint of spice or the impression after the carbonation washess over the tongue. This is a pretty decent flavor of stout with mild creamy sweetness from lactose I am assuming. The finish is semi-dry from the sugary almost syrupy aspect. Overall this is a good beer, not the best, but it has nice flavor and it hides the 7% + abv well."
""
"O - A tasty one, sweet but not annoyingly sweet. Tasty chocolate notes and dessert-like thoughts. Still a good stout body and slick feel."
""
"O - worth buying again but not the best CCS I've had."
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a good example of the style, it had pretty much all the things that I look for in the style and the added chocolate aspect was nice and true to it's name. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth and the flavors held my attention well, I could drink a couple of these, but this isn't the type of beer I would session, it has good drinkability for the style. What I liked the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, it was just what I want and expect from the style and it had good balance, the appearance was also pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad, but it would be nice if it was just a little thicker. I would buy this beer again when looking for a nice Milk Stout, I enjoyed it and it was priced right so I would buy it again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the style. All in all I was happy with this beer, I've been let down a couple time by Breckenridge, but this one turned out pretty good and I would for sure be interested in trying more of their brews. It's not a favorite Milk Stout, but I think it's good and an enjoyable example of the style. Good Job guys, this beer was better than I expected."
""
"Very dark pour with a tan head and a burnt sugar nose. The taste continues the burnt sugar, but also cocoa, caramel, roast coffee, more sugar and dark chocolate. All of the right flavors for a dessert stout, with a silky mouthfeel, but almost too sweet. Nothing to make it stand out, although it's a good dessert stout that would probably be fun to pair."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into stout glass. Clean brown pour, jet black in the glass with visible carbonation, lets no light through. Fizzy dark tan head which dissipates leaving lovely lacing and film. Smell is sweet, smooth, coffee and chocolate, all in balance. Taste is similar; coffee and chocolate bitterness predominate up front, with a sweet silky finish that goes perfectly with the velvety mouthfeel."
""
""
""
"Glad I tried this, but it probably won't be anything I seek out again unless I'm having a Milk Stout tasting. I was hoping for more but overall very decent."
""
"Pours a dark brown with a finger and a half of beige head. The head retains for quite some time. The nose is mildly roasty. The consistency is creamy and the flavor includes mild chocolate notes. The finish is slightly astringent and includes a note of alcohol presence which is odd considering that this is a relatively low ABV imperial."
""
""
""

"An above average stout, rich flavor, on the sweet side, with decent body. There are a few better stouts out there for sure, but this one is still worth trying and quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark and black. Cream colored head and good lacing. Aroma is strong sweet chocolate with dark malts. Flavor is consistent with dark malt flavor up front, vanilla in the middle and finishing with the chocolate. Nice vanilla-chocolate balance. Fairly low ABV for an imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice drinking beer in one of my favorite styles. Wouldn't go out of my way for it as I don't see much chocolate resemblance as stated in the label however a decent stout regardless."
""
""
"This is a fairly direct stout with constant sweet tones that work pretty well. Not blowing me away or anything, but what's there is nice enough. The beer nerd in me would certainly like more complexity, but it is what it is. A pretty easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really good dark beer from Breckenridge Brewery. After their IIPA, I had not really found a lot of their packaged beers to pack much punch, but old '72 does with a tight package of chocolatey stout goodness."
"O: I like this beer because it's an Imperial cream stout, and I haven't had too many of those. Tastes like an above average stout."
""
""
"The alcohol in this was well-hidden and only at the end could I feel the buzz kicking in. This was not that ""sweet"" but certainly fit the bill of a Cream Stout, while keeping a thinner-than-expected body and mouthfeel. The carbonation could have been a bit higher since there wouldn't have been a lot for it to compete it. As it, this was a decent beer that would be fine in its own as a dessert, but almost calls for something more bold and tart to counter it and help kick the subtle flavors up a notch."
""
""
""
""
"Overall an ok beer, nothing amazing. There are better beers in this category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? For the price of the four-pack... No. There are much better stouts available, but definitely worth a grab for something new to try."
""
""
""
"overall, it's OK. i didn't have to choke it down but nothing i'd trip over myself to obtain again. too many other better takes on the style out there IMO."
""
"Lots of darkened toast flavors up front, bordering on burnt. Slightly sweet, but there is no real chocolate flavor here. Well-balanced presence of hops--they take the back seat, but prevent the beer from being to coy. Think porter with a higher level of hop. Smooth aftertaste of toasty, darker malts. Rich body with a spritzy level of carbonation."
"Overall this is a good beer but as a Hop-head I don't have much to compare it to but I would call it a good beer. Nothing is bad at all. A style that I am just not used to but I appreciate the complex tastes that comes along with it. This beer showcases all the good things a stout brings to the table."
""
""
"Overall - An okay beer.. there's something about it that just doesn't seem right. I feel like I can taste a bit of cheap booze flavour, but maybe I just have a bad bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not bad, the elaborate, compound named description implies something a bit more complex than what you get, but it is still an enjoyable beer. Really just a slightly smoky chocolate stout."
"Overall: just the right amount of sweetness. nice amount of coffee and cream although the coffee is mild and not too bitter. certainly a nice combination of drinkability and flavor for the style."
""
""
"Draught @ Headkeeper: This one pours a very dark opaque brown color. There was a dense tan head that lingers and leaves some lacing. The aroma is lighter than expected. Chocolate, some roastiness and a hint of sweetness. Some milkiness also. The taste is nice. There was a milky/silky mouthfeel. The taste has chocolate malts, some roastiness, a hint of citrus malts and a bit of lactose. Nice."
"Good choice if you like milk stouts, which just aren't that common around here."
"O: Not the best chocolate cream stout, but a solid one that is worth a shot. If you like some sweetness and chocolate but don't like to be overpowered by it (say for example, Choklat would have these overpowering characteristics for a lot of people) then this is a stout for you. Definitely an enjoyable stout, especially for desert"
""
""
""
"Bottle pours creamy, dark, and rich looking with a small brown head. Aroma with big chocolate notes, light roast, and definite lactose presence. Flavor follows with massive chocolate and lactose--like some chocolate milk--but with a nice roast that balances this out and keeps it from cloying sweetness. This could be a dessert beer, but it really doesn't have to be. Nice all around."
""
""
"Deep brown with a ring of tan head, some lace as well. Smell is quite roasty with lots of chocolate bittersweet and milk, coffee grinds, some milky/lactic notes and very light hop. Taste is sweet and roasty, big chocolate flavours, coffee, lightly bitter, some lactic flavours in the finish, roasted aftertaste. Lightly carbonated, medium body, smooth creamy/milky feel. Solid stuff, and went down quite quickly, something I could revisit gladly."
""
""
"Not too shabby...rich and decadent, but it would certainly be better if it were just fermented with cocoa powder instead of chocolate. I would also ferment it with a yeast that has more esters, just with a high mash temp to ensure enough residual sugars."
""
""
""
""
"A friend of mine had a car like this back in the mid-70's. We thought it was ugly, but it was built like a tank. This beer is not really tank like. It's a little thin and watery with not much carbonation. It has a slightly boozy aroma (and taste). It is a very well balanced taste - hoppy, maltly, not very roasty (but a bit). Very nice. A bit pricey."
"M - Medium body. Creamy and smooth. light to moderate carbonation."
"OVERALL: A solid brew from Breckenridge. Boozy, but not without some nice chocolate and cream notes. Maybe it was an aged keg? Still was quite drinkable."
"This beer is right up my alley. It might be too sweet for some, but for others it would make a great dessert beer. For me, I could drink it in any weather at any time of day."
"Overall, I very good sweet stout from a brewery that I usually enjoy."
""
"O - This is a really good milk stout. Not my favorite style but this one I would go back to."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, bread, and dark fruitiness. Ok aromas, but are quite muted and overly fruity. Taste of milk chocolate, toast, biscuit, roasted malt, caramel, raisin, prune, and light herbal. Lingering notes of chocolate, toast, caramel, roasted malt, dark fruits, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Pretty good flavor balance, but not as roasted as I was expecting; with a bit too much fruitiness. Minimal cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish noticed. Overall this is a decent cream stout. Was not anywhere near what I was expecting in flavor profile for a stout(and I just looked on their site and there is no roasted malts whatsoever, so there is my answer). A fairly enjoyable offering though."
"O-not a bad sweet stout. I think I prefer southern tier's version but I will still get this again"
"The dark cereal grain, red fruit and alcohol interplay actually balances fairly nicely for the second half of the beer. It feels like a lot more than 7.2% though, I could easily guess this as 10%. A bit of a drop in the carbonation could go a long way to bring this from good to memorable."
"Smooth, full bodied, lightly effervescent, almost creamy texture. Warming with a hint of dryness at the finish. A medicinal note shows up in the aftertaste. A nice brew."
"Very easy to drink and a delicious beer that does this style justice."
"Tasty chocolate stout. Aroma is lacking, flavor makes up for it."
"Bottom Line: A must try in my opinion!"
"Poured into a snifter served at cellar temperature. So black that no light would shine through with a slightly brown layer of head. The aroma was full of caramel and chocolate malt. I was a bit apprehensive that it was going to be insanely sweet but the guys at Breckenridge do a great job making beer first then adding the right amount of flavors that won't over power what it's supposed to be. Great flavor with a ridiculously smooth almost velvety feel. On the aftertaste you start to taste the lingering flavor of dark chocolate."
""

"A nice milk stout, this is easily one of the better beers from these guys I've had in a long time , fairly good drinakability for the style & ABV"
""
""
"Solid milk stout that boasts some great roasty character and suggestions of things sweet, sticky, and rich."
""
""
""
"O- Overall, not bad but I thought this was a pretty average beer within the style. Nothing I would purchase again."
""
""
"This is a great looking stout. It pours out black with a thick mocha colored head. The head retains and laces very well. The aroma isn't doing it for me, it's a bit faint, and I'm mostly just getting garden variety roasted malt. The taste is excellent, this is really a superiour milk stout. It has great creamy lactose and malt flavors that pair nicely with the smooth milk chocolate and roasty coffee. The finish is just like chocolate milk. The mouthfeel is light and lightly carbonated, and the drinakbility is very good. Overall, this is a great milk stout."
""
"Pitch black body smooth creamy light beige khaki head, forms thick with fine bubbles. Even speckled lacing left behind, aroma comes off a bit muted with shades of dark chocolate and cream. A bit of toffee and caramel with dark roasted malt base this smells balanced not too dessert like. Sharp sweetness cream based, with roasted malts bringing dark chocolate and hints of mild coffee. Smooth balanced and drinkable flavors are well coordinated, it's a very nice beer especially as it warms up a bit even more flavor bursts. A hint of sourdough tartness or yogurt like quality is in there, and it actually works with the sweet and lactic notes that come with a good cream/milk stout. Impressive beer from Breckenridge, I'm glad I didn't give up on them their imperial series typically doesn't disappoint. Mouthfeel even flowing carbonation creamy textured, medium to full bodied. Not a harsh bone in it's body, smooth all day very nice impy cream stout. Overall a beer I would recommend to friends and dedicated beer drinkers alike, excellent quality from first to last sip."
"O: On the whole, this is an enjoyable, well done beer. I'm not the biggest fan of milk stouts, but this was a winner."
""

"This is an opaque inky black beer with 1/4 inch creamy tan head that was short-lived. The predominate smell is roasted chocolate malt, coffee, and dark fruit. The taste is moderately sweet, creamy, mocha. The mouth feel is surprisingly thin for a stout and probably the weakest aspect of this beer. The 7.2% ABV is well hidden. There is no bitterness. I much prefer Southern Tier Chokolat or Mocha to this effort by Breckenridge."
""
""
""
"This was a nice milk stout where I enjoyed the milk chocolate instead of dark chocolate flavor. Sweet, but not too sweet, and a light mouthfeel made this a very easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
"Brewery says it is brewed with chocolate, Fuggles hops, California ale yeast, and several malts: Pale, Munich, Caramel, and Victory. One of the better offerings from Breckenridge, I think. From the 12 oz single bottle bought at Grapevine Liquors in Denver."
""
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that doesn't stay around for too long. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, milk chocolate, and some dark fruit and coffee. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also the addition of some molasses. However, for a chocolate stout I was expecting more chocolate in the flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and goes down easy. It's a decent enough brew overall, I think it's worth trying. Single bottle purchased from Liquor Barn."

"A beer that is not as interesting as the name makes it out to be. Give it a try if you enjoy cream stouts, but do not expect to be blown away."
""
"O: Severely disappointed with this one. Although, I've experienced the lack of aroma and flavor with other Stouts/Porters and I haven't rated them as poorly because I wasn't as realistic with my rating system as I am now. 3 is average and this is an average Milk/Sweet Stout."

"Nice beer for Breckenridge, but it doesn't really stand out for the most part. There are still qualities I liked and is worth a shot if you see it."

"Overall, a pretty nice sweet stout that got a little too sweet in my opinion. A little more attenuation or more hops would have went a long way in making this a better drinker. Would go well with chocolate desserts. I'd love to see this bourbon barrel aged with some booze and vanilla addedin the profile."
""
"Taste-Coffee and cream, cocoa, a bit of a hop profile leading to a dry finish for a sweet stout. Not too bad overall."
"Overall an enjoyable milk stout with good chocolate taste. Worth a try but not something I would buy a 4-pack of. With the added ABV they could have added in some more flavor."

"This beer pours a medium bodied dark chocolate brown in color with a one finger dark khaki head. The nose is roasty with a moderate bitterness. There isn't much chocolate but there is definitely a moderate amount of coffee. As it warms to room temp there is a tad bit of cola and slightly chocolate syrup. The flavors are initially a lot of chocolate syrup and cola with a light roast in the finish. It certainly is a sweet stout. It drinks medium in body and very smooth, leaving behind a sweet milk chocolate flavor in the aftertaste. It drinks nicely and isn't cloying. It's a solid beer. It's worth a try but I prefer the ""drier"" Bell's Special Double Cream Stout."

"All over the board with this brew... Great nose and appearance. But the flavors are a hot mess of chalky flavors. Recommended at the right price of around $3.5/draft; $1.5/12oz...But, I paid $2/bottle and I over paid"
"O- A very good example of a milk stout. Nothing Earth-shattering, but definitely one of the better offerings by Breckenridge."
""
"O - Enjoyable flavor. Wouldn't be my first pick for this style. Give me a Founders Breakfast or a Terrapin W&B over this but I'd be glad to have it served to me anytime."
""
"(Overall) This stout does well for me. My biggest complaint is in the carbonation which goes a bit too far for this beer. Otherwise, this is an excellent offer from Breckenridge and worth a shot for any milk stout lover. 4"
"Pours black with a 3/4 thumbs width mocha head that completely disappeared before I had a chance to put my glass down. Little if any lacing. Rich and semi-sweet aroma of chocolate, cream, and some coffee, though the chocolate does not shine like I would have hoped. Kind of a weird flavor profile to this, throughout the sip there is this thin but sharp sweetness that hits you alongside the regular flavors of some roasted malt, liquorice, and coffee. A mild chocolate shows itself in the after taste. Thinnish mouthfeel like I have come to expect from Breckenridge's dark beers. Overall, an alright beer that probably isn't worth buying again. Better Breck beers to choose from and far better milk stouts to choose from."
"Overall, it goes down deliciously smooth, and makes for a great sipper."
""
""
"O – Very nice and very drinkable. I was worried by the smell it would be overly sweet but it is not. Nice balance of flavors and very tasty. This is a well done milk stout and one of my new favorites."
""
"As with many of the earlier examples of chocolate stouts and porters, the chocolaty flavors seem to come from the use of darker roast grains and not from actual chocolate additions themselves (newer examples typically use actual chocolate extracts for dominant chocolate flavor). This beer favorably competes with Young's Double Chocolate Stout and Rogue's Mocha Porter."
""
"Comes out of the bottle a deep, warm sable with a thick and frothy tan head. Aroma has a strong overtone of sweet chocolate plus notes of licorice and molasses and a hint of quality roast coffee. Flavor has firm chocolate, licorice and molasses notes plus undertones of caramel and coffee, and is rather sweet but not too sweet for a beer. Firm, smooth body has a good amount of fizz. Worth a drive to the package store!"
"Overall: very nice indeed. Soutern Tier has perfected the chocolate imp stout IMO, but this guy gives me a run for their money."

"12oz bottle i picked up for $2.99. Dark balck color, thin brown head, looks like a stout to me. Smells very, very faintly of chocolate. Tastes more like a cream stout and I'm not sure the chocolate is even noticeable. I am glad I only bought a single because this was mediocre. I just can't get into Breckenridge brews at all."
"Overall: This is a pretty good milk stout, but by no means is it an imperial stout of any kind. Note to BA, '72 Imperial is the car on the label, not a description of the beer. I'm rating it as if it were appropriately placed with the milk stouts."

"Overall – This was a nice roasty-more bitter stout. It has nice chocolate flavors and a very nice mouthfeel. Not to shabby."
""
"Overall: Breckenridge is a brewery that, well, often fails to satisfy, but this 72 is pretty good."
"Well crafted and quite enjoyable stuff. Happy to get to try this one on draft and in nice shape."
"Ale pours black with a huge, dense, brown head that leaves all kinds of lacing on the glass. I felt like I had to break through the head upon first sip. Aromas of dark chocolate and cocoa fill the nose, while sweet dark chocolate, cocoa, fudge, and creamed coffee cover the palate. Mouth is thick, chewy, velvety smooth, and super creamy. Overall, very well done! Maybe a little more ABV would have been nice? Not complaining though. Try it if you get the chance."

"Overall this beats both the Samuel Adams Chocolate stout and the Penn brewery Chocolate meltdown by a mile! Flavors are balanced and complexly layered. It's a shame this isn't brewed all the time."

"Bold but not pushy, complex but the smoothness makes it sooo drinkable. Damn good."
"Full-bodied with minimal carbonation. Goes down smooth. More of a ""dessert beer"" due to the heavy nature of it. Very tasty and recommended!"
"Notes: Nice beer with big chocolate flavors. Nose is disappointing but the taste makes up for it. Good amount of milk chocolate, but it doesn't get too sweet. A well executed chocolate stout."
"Medium, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice chocolate beer."
"Pours a black color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight chocolate, hint of oatmeal, hint of hop, and hint of bread. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, chocolate, hint of oatmeal, and a hint of hops. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"Barring all the negatives, it still was an excellent beer. I would still recommend it to a friend, and perhaps with a knowledgeable bartender, its full range could be enjoyed."
"Poured into a pint glass, a dark, opaque black, disappointingly with no head at all. Deep aroma of dark malts, dark chocolate and a touch of smooth coffee. Complex, malty taste, with lots of creamy chocolate, as the name would imply, dark malts, a bit of coffee, vanilla bean, a definite essence of plum detected, and just a touch of smoke. Heavy-medium body, and quite nice overall."
"Oa. Like it a lot. I like choco stouts and crean stouts, choc cream is awesome."
"overall a good beer; put it next to their vanilla porter and it may be a nice counterpart"
"Pours an opaque black with a 1/2 inch khaki colored head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. Nice distinct rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark bread/biscuits, and chocolate chip cookie dough. Taste is of the dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and dark cocoa powder. This beer has a good level of carbonation and is very crisp yet smooth in the mouth. Overall, this is a great stout that I would drink a lot of if it were offered in CA. One of the best beers I was able to try in CO."
"The mouthfeel was solid, the body was very creamy and easy to drink. Overall I enjoyed the beer and though it was on the sweet side it was a very enjoyable imperial stout."
"Nice enough beer, but Max's happens to have the Youngs Double Chocolate on tap as well, and this beer is no where close to that great beer."
"Had this one on tap tonight at the Breckenridge BBQ location at 471 Kalamath in Denver. Poured an opaque black, with a little slightly off-white head. Aromas of roasted malt, bitter chocolate and coffee/cream. Medium to full bodied, creamy, with flavors of roasted malt, chocolate and freshly ground coffee. Wish I had had time to stay for another."
