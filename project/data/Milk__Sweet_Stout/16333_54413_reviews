"So surprised by this beer...I almost didnt think anything about it as Ive walked by it off and on for a year or two.  I grabbed some finally, WOW...Amazing beer!  Two thumbs up, great flavor, well worth the money!"
"very good beer slight chocolate taste creamy smooth hope I can find it in town"
""
"Super underrated cream stout. This is without question the best milk stout to pair with fried food on the planet. Love stouts and sports? This beer is perfect to pair with your game day faves."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : this is why I drink beer. This feeling, right here. Yes."
""
""
""
""
"Solid stout but nothing too memorable imo."
"Fantastic oatmeal milk stout. For 5% this beer is spot on fantastic. Silky mouthfeel, a light sweet oat and chocolate nose, and a nice sweet chocolate and cream taste."
""
"Had this at a local bar after a couple rounds of fireball. I asked if they had any stout and this was recommended. I really enjoyed it after pouring from can into 16 oz pint glass. Has a sweet taste."
""
""
""
"Great taste and the smell is really nice like roasted coffee with chocolate. The mouthfeel was pretty thin, which was really disappointing, but expected with a lower ABV oatmeal. Overall this was a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really fine example of the oatmeal stout, from the big head to the gently sweet roastiness and the full smooth body. The savory soy notes are a definite bonus. I would happily pick this one up again."
"Overall: An enjoyable milk stout, all maltiness and sweetness, with just hints here and there of more bitter flavors. It's an easy drinking brew that doesn't necessarily encourage sipping so much as drinking. Anyone criticizing this for being ""too sweet"" is confusing milk stouts with some other kind of stout. Will repeat."
"O- very drinkable and plenty of flavor in a smooth milk stout"
"This was sweet and disgusting. I love stouts, but this one was very gross-tasting. This is the very first beer I have every poured down the drain. Everything else they make at Tallgrass is quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch. Smell is strong of chocolate, sweet. Taste is of chocolate, a good bit of coffee that was not apparent in the smell, slightly sweet, tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall a quality beer worth trying."
""
"O: This fit the hallmarks of a decent oatmeal stout in terms of the body and fullness, though a little less body that I had hoped. The coffee and vanilla paired well balancing any bitterness from the coffee roast. From the website this stout is brewed with cream sugar, so that may explain it."
""
"Tried this at a local beer expo. One of my favorites for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Creamy and delicious. Bitter end, but not too bitter."
"Can pour into pint glass. Pours a pitch dark color with a thin and reedy off white head. Nose is milk chocolate and filter coffee. A very smooth cream stout with a great lactose feel to it. Solid."
"Great beer. Great taste. Had with a prime rib dinner. Paired well."
"Was on tap..."
"Thin for a stout.  No head retention.  Drinkable, but forgettable"

"Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat has a thin, fizzy, quickly-dissipating head, a dark brown appearance, and no lacing left behind. The aroma is of creamy, chocolaty, dark-roasted barley malt, coffee, and brown bread crust. The flavor is of that, with a touch of char, sugar, and very mellow bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and velvety, and Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat finishes semi-dry and highly drinkable. RJT"

"Very Smooth Stout - But very ordinary.  If somebody would give me one, I would drink it.  Purchasing  - I will take a Left Hand -Milk Stout any day of the week."

"O - Great beer.  I'd call it the perfect transition beer from summer to fall.  Very drinkable, nice complexity to it.  cant wait to pick it up again"

"A decent stout. Rich chocolate taste, thick, and smooth."

"Smell: Unassuming beer in scent. Notes of milk, cream, and oatmeal, with just a hint of alcohol. Taste/mouthfeel: Incredible. Creamy dark oatmeal and roasted barley. It is so dark and thick that it felt almost chewy in texture and taste. Notes of chocolate and slight caramel come through part way into the glass. The creaminess lingers in the mouth long after I expected. Overall, spectacular beer; one of my personal favorites."

"O - very well constructed creamy oatmeal stout/oaty milk stout? I'll buy this again at the right price. It is always available as a mix 6 ($9.99) at my local grocery store, which is nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little thin and very straightforward, but a pleasant and easy-drinking beer. It doesn't particularly stand out in any way, however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black in color with a head that was minimal and rapidly faded entirely. Delectable aroma of oatmeal,chocolate,and dark malt. There is plenty of oatmeal, chocolate,and dark malt in the flavor but the oatmeal clearly dominates. The mouth is a bit oily and thick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-  Pretty good milk stout, but I'd prefer there to be more roast/coffee to compliment the sweetness.  There's also a werid watery/milky finish that lingers a bit on the tongue and the top of the mouth, which detracts for me.  Worth a try especially if you like stouts on the sweeter side. (82/100)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The bar is lowly lit, but the beer appears near black and opaque with approximately a half inch of beige head. Big chocolate aromas with some milk presence. Chocolate milk flavor throughout. Elegant and light on the palate, but by no means thin. A tad sweet, complimented by some bitter chocolaty tones in the finish. Really tasty."

"On tap at Bernie's in Waukesha, WI. Pours a pitch black color with a light brown foamy head. Sweet malty aroma with a hint of vanilla. A smooth easy drinking stout that is perfect in texture. A must try, very delicious and a nice find from a state that's not as well known for their craft beer."

"A lot of Tallgrass fans, which I absolutely am, swear by this beer as their favorite from this great brewery, I am not one of them. A nice beer, but just not enough body in my humble opinion for me to give this as outstanding rating. To date, I think Tallgrass' Pale Ale (8-bit) and their IPAs (Ethos and Oasis) are better. Don't get me wrong, the taste itself is great, the whole minus here is the fact that the overall body is thin.. perhaps a bit more of a transitional stout."

"Pours a very deep reddish-brown which is almost black in color. A thin beige head is seen that just settles to around the sides of the glass. Spotty lacing is seen but doesn't last long. The aroma is very pleasant of roasted malts right up front with oatmeal, vanilla and chocolate. The taste has even more great flavors with some black coffee and milk chocolate. Very tasty and is a easy drinker. Perfect carbonation. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Overall a GREAT Oatmeal Cream Stout!"

"I went easy on my ratings because perhaps I'm just not a fan of this type of beer. Way too much carbonation, nasty smell, and taste that was just not something I enjoyed."
"No one ever accused me of being a beer snob. At least not yet. In fact, I'm new to craft beers and am still learning. I've only kegged my second batch of home brew just today. What I do know is what I like. This beer, along with the vanilla counterpart are my current all time favorite brews. I'm sure that nobody would fault me if this Valentine's Day I took my woman to a private place and enjoyed a little Buffalo Sweat. In fact, I highly recommend that you do the same. You won't regret it!"

"Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a spectacular example of the style. It's not for everyone though, and the sweetness can be overwhelming if you're used to other styles. If you can find it, pick it up!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty awesome example of the style. Dark, sweet, balancing bitterness, and easy to drink. I would like to see this cranked up to an imperial level with a ton more malt and booze, then we would be talking about a downright awesome imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I feel like I had this too soon out of the fridge, as it was lacking some of the creaminess I was expecting. Foam disappeared quickly after the pour, and it had a definite oatmeal nose, without being as strong as I thought it would. Smooth tasting, creamy without being rich. A solid beer, but cold it wasn't as great as it could have been."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is a very good beer. Not outstanding, but I think the BA score is pretty appropriate."

"Overall: Pleasant enough but a bit too sweet; not something I would want to drink in any quantity"
""
"This was a surprisingly good, and very smooth, stout; as a bonus, it clocks in at only 5%."
""
"O- This beer has a great aroma that really reminded me of Founders Breakfast stout. So I was a bit disappointed when the taste did not match it. Too much tobacco for me and really reminded me of the way an ashtray smells. The finish was quite pleasant however."

"Descent stout. Would definitely hit the spot around the holidays or as a dessert beverage. It's worth a try."

""
""
"First and foremost...love the name!!! Secondly...this is a decent stout...for the abv to be where its at and the taste to be where its at...it just works....well. The beer pours an opaque black with nice offwhite head that is leaving a spotty lace. The scent is milk chocolate with hints of mocha. The taste is a creamy almost nestle start then finishes slightly bitter to leave an espresso flare. The mouthfeel is medium body with smooth carbonation. Overall...very nice sessionable stout!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable with a good taste that doesn't over do anything but leaves you wanting another drink."
"O - this is a revisit and decided to review. Solid effort here from Tallgrass. I really like the ""lighter"" feel to this stout. I could drink this several times a day!"
""
"Overall: Damn, I really liked this stout. All of its subtleties really add up to a really damn fine stout!"
""
""
""
"overall its a spot on oatmeal stout. vanilla bean one is better, though this one is very very drinkable and sessionable!"
""
"3.5/3.5/3.75/4/3.5"
"Overall, a very decent stout, though perhaps a bit more like a porter in body. I like the fact that the beer comes in an aluminum can, which is much easier to recycle. Besides, I like tangy, metallic ambience provided by the can...."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A little disappointed as it looked great coming out of the can. Feels more like a porter than a stout. If you want to knock a few back, this is a good beer, but if you want something bold and palateable, look elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
"After finishing the beer from the glass, the glass had a nice aroma of malt and chocolate. NO cola smell present."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm very disappointed in this beer, and it all is from the mouthfeel. It drinks like a soda, just way too carbonated and light, I wouldn't get this again unless it was on a nitro tap"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer I bought in cans and poured into a frozen mug. Could hardly see any light through the mug pretty dark color, It smelled pleasant. It had a medium texture in the mouth for a stout beer. lots of flavor as soon as it hit my tongue chocolate, coffee, and malty. But didn't leave any strong aftertaste. Overall this is one of the best balance dark beers I've ever drank. Can't wait to get more of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Buffalo Sweat may seem menacing based on it's can's artwork and black appearance but this lower-in-alcohol stout is full-flavored and robust, delicately balancing between it's smooth seductive side and it's aggressive roasted qualities. Try and tell me you could put a few of these delicious brews back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Buffalo Sweat is a delicious cream stout with a mild profile, smooth feel, and balanced profile. The flavor is a mild roasted grain stout flavor which is deservingly overshadowed by the creamy texture and smooth quality of the beer. Many ""cream"" beers are just a little ""wetter"" tasting than their non-cream counterparts but this one definitely has a genuine cream feel. A well crafted and easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Buffalo Sweat pours a black color with a small lacing head. Their is a very creamy malty, slightly smokey and sweet aroma. The taste is very creamy and rich. Just hints of coffee and cream, and there is a subtle sweetness to it. Very nice full flavors, nicely carbonated. Overall a fantastic milk/sweet stout, very well built together."
"O-A pretty good milk stout. I personally liked Left Hand's better, as this one lacks complexity and is a bit too dry but I still enjoyed it"
""
""
"Consumed from Spiegelau snifter. Aroma is unexpectedly organic almost sugarbeets and cut grass dominating. Taste is pleasant but a bit hollow like something is missing. Almost feels watered down. More sweet than bitter. Thin mouthfeel. Easy to drink but overall bland and average for style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beers pours with little to no head. There's a slight brown skim across the surface. There's limited carbonation. The scent is coffee, roasted nuts, etc. I don't get a ton of the ""cream"" but it's a very tasty oatmeal stout. The biggest flavor is the roasty finish. Just a ton of roast flavor that lingers in your mouth. I wouldn't say that it's bitter though. It's a quality, sessionable oatmeal stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"O=Again, when poured, this is a decent representation of the style. If you buy a 4=pack in cans, I definitely recommend pouring the first one you try into a glass...if it is too bitter to your liking, wait a few months and try again...this last can redeemed the others."
"O - Loaded down with vanilla bean, this beer just pops and really one I would reach for time & time again. The regular is good in its own right, but man-o-man that vanilla bean is much better!"

"Overall- for an oatmeal stout I was thinking of something bigger to chew on"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall this isn't something to wax overly poetic about but yet lays down a solidly smooth profile typical of the style. enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fairly good. While light in the aromatics department, it was solid in flavor. A bit more carbonation than anticipated, not that I found that to be disagreeable."
""
"Dark brown, with clarity at the edges. Light brown head. Nose has a bit of dark chocolate, roasted grains, coffee and roasted nuts. Sweeter malt lending to a creamy stout nose. Taste is sweeter than the nose, roast grains, coffee grains and a light bitterness that rolls into the finish, but the sweetness prevails. Thin body, and lighter than I'd like but still serves the beer well. Low carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I can think of several stouts I would choose in front of this one, but I would certainly enjoy this one if it came as part of a Tallgrass sampler or something similar."
""
"D: not a bad stout from Tallgrass. would be really awesome if they could nitrogenate this brew/these cans. would add an appreciated dimension to the body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Fairly basic milk stout but done well. Very easy to drink. I really like all the firkins Tallgrass is putting out of this beer with different ingredients in each one. They have all been a nice surprise at a fest or bars."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very smooth, sweet, and drinkable. Meh. Won't have it on-tap again, but I can see it being popular."
""
""
"Overall not bad, nice malt flavors except a bit of burnt metallic acrid roast, but not a lot, nice mocha, nice creamy oats and plenty of lactose, and another negative with that charred powdered chalky gritty feel."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very drinkable oatmeal stout not overly complex but is very well brewed."
""
""
"O - Almost exactly what I would expect for the style. Complex nose, straight forward taste. Another good beer from Tallgrass."
"It's a little flabby, a little sweet, a little too bitter for me to really get on board with it. But pretty easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is not a complex beer, but the flavors that are present are well-rounded and very enjoyable. It's become my go-to stout when I want something familiar and available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and quite sessionable."
""
"O- nice stout with some chocolate and roast."
""
""
"Don't get a chance to try too many new milk stouts. This is a pretty good one, I'll say. Smooth delivery and feel with a flavor profile that fits the bill for the style. Not the most aggressive characteristics on the flavor, but all the lactic and stout tones are there. A real easy drinker."
"Drinkability: A solid, clean, oatmeal/sweet stout. The sweetness comes through but is never overly seet. Glad I picked up a four pack. I could have several of these."
"O: This beer seems like it would be amazing in nitro-cans or on nitro-tap (just the right body/mouthfeel that the nitro would be a pleasant edition). Very easy to drink and very enjoyable - I might even consider this one a sessionable stout which I do not find a lot of beers which qualify."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: This is a good stout. Definitely one to try! A good representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And the Buffalo Sweat name doesn't exactly get my taste buds watering. However, taking a closer look at our travel pic, the two tone color of the beer has a striking resemblance to an actual buffalo's coloration. I have no idea how Tallgrass came up with the name, so it's just an observation. Creative names are becoming harder and harder to find in the booming craft beer industry, but this one doesn't leave me dreaming about the next one."
""
""
""
"The taste is, well, the can is right. Theres nothing like it. heavy on the burned, charred malt for sure. Lots of coffee bitterness, with just a hint of overly bitter dark chocolate. All those flavors make it feel like black coffee bitter upfront. The lactose only really adds a bit, but too late to matter."
""
"Very dark pour with a medium sized tan head. Smell is coffee, chocolate, and maybe a little bit of vanilla and some brown sugar? molasses. Smooth and easy drinking stout with just the right amount of sweetness, not overbearing. Heavy lacing on my glass throughout the beer. Glad to have this stout around Iowa."
""
"The nose is heavy with toasted malt and milk chocolate. There is a bit of tobacco and toffee and just the faintest hint of coffee. The flavor is a pretty well-balanced blend of toasted malt and milk chocolate with the emphasis about 60/40 on toasted malt. There is not even a hint of bitterness. This beer is sweet all the way. The high carbonation makes this a decent session beer. It is not heavy in the least. Each sip is juicy and thirst-quenching and highly flavorful."
""
"The arrived, from the tap, a black color with the darkest brown hues on the fringes. A modest cap of tan foam floated above. The aroma is of reminiscent dark chocolate and coffee. Very little hops in the aroma. These dark flavors continue on the palate. The beer moves across smoothly. The flavor profile dwindles a tad through a slightly thin center. This is a nice stout and very good with dessert."
""
""
"Had it at Velocity Five in Arlington in a 16oz can for $6. It was a pretty good stout for it's volume and price. The usual description of stouts...coffee, vanilla. It's better than a Guinness. I even find it better than the gold medal winner, hoppin frog BORIS the crusher oatmeal-imperial stout."
"Overall: I will keep this one on the fridge!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good purchase, though mostly for fun than for actual wanting to try it. Despite the rather yucky name, the brew is pretty decent."
"M - Thick body. Very smooth, with mild carbonation. A bit drier than I expected in the finish for a milk stout."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on a sweet stout. Sweet, but well balanced by the roasted coffee flavors."
"Overall- If you like them sweet, you will find little to be disappointed with here. This is just a solid cream stout, and at 5%, it is one you can keep on enjoying."
""
""
""
"I found that the smell was ok, the lactose sugars remind me of the smell of a local dairy processor. The taste was nice and smooth, no bitter or harsh after taste. I found that drinking this beer a few minutes after sitting gave it a little more flavor."
"Drinkability: It is pretty decent stuff. It is not overly bold and has everything going for it."
""
""
""
"Can poured into Goose Island nonic pint. Appearance is dark brown with chestnut highlights at the edges. Tan head forms an retains itself in a thin layer. Minimal lacing left behind. The nose starts with a rush of roasted barley and creaminess from the milk sugar. Layers of oats, roast, and vanilla come to the surface. Very nice aroma, right on for the style. The taste is similar to the nose, starts of with the lactose sweetness. This is followed by a dry and sturdy punch from the roasted barley. This features loads of flavor and is exactly to style. The moutfeel is somewhat thin with mild carbonation. Overall, this is a delicious milk stout. The roasted malt profile is front and center while the lactose sugar features that touch of creaminess which joins the party of flavor very nicely. Definitely worth seeking out if sweet stout is your thing."
""
"Overall good brew, would give it a B+ in the creamy/milk stout category…worth trying."
""
""
""
"This is very good beer! Served at a good temperature with a nice tan foamy head that soon settled and some lace. Color is actually a clear obviously very dark ruby red (thanks to my trusty iPhone flashlight), but opaque seeming black brown. Arina us roast, malt, treacle, caramel, toffee, cocoa, coffee. Flavor's like nose, sweet comes out and is perfectly balanced by the bitter malt, hop, and carbonic tang. Body is very good and carbonation a touch soft. Finish is like flavor and tapers nicely with medium length."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew that is moderately carbonated. It has a slick feel about it that lingers inside the mouth with almost a filmy coating that I dont particularly care for. As far as the style goes, this one is not the sweetest I have had but it is on the higher end of the range. Not a bad brew but not something I would return to again if given choices."
""
""
""
""
"A very good-looking, mediocre stout. It just doesn't have much flavor. And having just drank a flavorful mild ale at the same ABV, I know it's possible to bring flavor without a huge grain bill."
"Overall- Very drinkable. I normally don't drink beer from a can but I will make an exception for this. My brother gave me a can to try and now I want some more."
""
"Overall an easy drinking stout with everything going right for it."
""
""
""
""
"O Overall a fine beer, for a 5% stout you can't ask for much more. I probably wouldn't buy it again, but its by no means bad."
""
""
""
"On a lot of levels, this is a very likable milk stout. It does lack the punch in the initial taste to make this a really good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is really smooth, great mouthfeel, nice bitterness on the finish from the roast, a nice milk stout for sure. I""d have this again, both my wife and I loved it. The lead off is this mild sweetness and the finish is this wet bitterness and roast like coffee, the midpalate is the creamy smooth beer. well done."
""
"this is a perfect session stout. light feeling, light on abv, and very tasty. it was a bit too mellow for my liking, i like my stouts to be robust, this one just had subtle hints of everything."
""
"Overall a great easy-drinking stout."
""
""
""
"Thanks to Duff27 for this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a pretty solid stout, give it a shot"
""
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, a slight coffee roast. In the taste, a sweet to dry coffee roastiness. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry coffee presence in the aftertaste. A nice coffee roast, yet thin for what it is."
""
""
""
"Overall: My first beer from this brewery and its a dandy! A session stout in a tall boy can! Awesome stuff here from Kansas of all places. This Buffalo sweat and Redband stout are my two favorite picks for stouts in a can. I am impressed by this beer! Geez, I am really not sure why this beer gets such low ratings..."
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty darn good beer. The look, smell, and taste are all really nice. The drinkability of this beer is also really high. I could see myself kicking back with a few can in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Buffalo Sweat is a balanced, smooth milk stout that is definitely worth a try. Good beer."
""
"O. A solid stout. Nothing terribly complex, but might make me rethink my overall opinion of milk stuts."
"O: An interesting beer that is not one of my favorites but is not bad. The feel and flavor is similar to a porter gone wrong. Not a bad beer but one I will easily forget."
""
""
"All in all, a superb beer, best enjoyed on a cool fall/winter evening with a fire handy. Full bodied, this beer wants you to keep your fingers warm and snuggle up with a book and/or loved one."

"D: A great alternative for the Guiness Crowd."
""
"Somewhat fizzy carbonation with that milkiness and a medium thin body. Makes for an unusual but effective mouthfeel."
""
""
"Black coffee with a mocha head of soft foam that leaves some trace legs on the glass. Fresh dark roasty malt and java in the aroma. Charred malt and sweet cream with flavors of cocoa and fudge. A little light bodied even for a 5% alc. stout with effervescent carbonation. Tasty beer for an everyday kind of stout."
"Overall an easy drinking easy to appreciate and enjoyable milk stout."
""
"O: Overall an easy drinking smooth stout. Tasty, normally I don't go too much for this particular style of stout, but this one is just fine.."

"My first taste of a Kansas brewed ale, and it was a good one. We need more tasty beers that are 5% ABV. And more beers in 16oz cans as well."

"Flavor balances sweet with bitterness. Didn't pick it for a milk stout, although it is light of body and quite smooth to drink. Airy carbonation and full body. Chocolate and coffee prominent in the flavor, but little acidity. Sweet but not sickly. Bomb stout."
"Overall this is a very well balanced, very enjoyable brew, an excellent sweet stout."
"O-not bad but I just dont get much else for flavor other than the chocolate"
"Overall:	This is a good just chilling in the evening or with a few friends type of beer."

"Pours a tar black with a two-finger coffee cream head. Solid lacing throughout. Aroma of delectable sweet chocolate and roasted coffee notes. Super sweet chocolate notes up front in the flavor profile. Tastes like out of the bag semi-sweet chocolate chips. A really creamy caramel flavor on the back end with the slightest touch of tongue tingling hops at the finish. Nice soft mouthfeel. A great sweet and silky beer without being too much. Great chocolate milk substitute."
""

"Overall this is a nice stout to enjoy with a chocolate desert, as it warmed the sweetness dominated."

"Tallgrass has tall cans. Pours out that nearly black variation of dark brown that we all know and love our stouts to be. Two fingers of fluffy sand colored head leaves behind some really nice lacing and has decent retention for a stout. Smells (and tastes) appropriately true to form of a milk stout as well: Roasted malts and dark chocolate mixed with a very light mineral tone. The flavor starts out on the more roasted bitterness signature of a normal stout and transforms into the sweeter profile of a milk stout while held in the mouth. Medium body, very smooth and creamy in texture.. in a can! Just a normal can, no gas cartridge to be found. Color me impressed."

"Easy drinking stout. Would work even in hotter weather."
"O-This is my first taste of Tallgrass and it aint bad. Good representation of a sweet stout. I think i'd still reach for Left Hand's rendition, but this guy has some nice roasty flavor and a killer smooth body."
""
""
"O - Great brew from Tallgrass, it is a really chocolatey beer and embodies what I think a good Stout should taste like"
"Finally a Kansas beer (not a sentence I figured I would say). I do however loves me the sweet stouts, so I have been looking forward to this one. The appearance is that of a dark brown ale or perhaps a lighter porter, It has a deep caramel color, but not much more than that. The aromatics have a very sweet corn/maple syrup aroma with some raisins hanging around in the back. The taste is quite enjoyable. A good mark for the first thing that I've ever had from this brewery. The taste mirrors the smell with an addition of what seems to be toasted malts and oats. The body is rather thin, but the flavors do a good job of helping with that. It goes down way too easy especially considering the high level of sweetness that this beer gives off. Overall, impressive, something for the Sunflower State to hang their hats on."
"Buffalo Sweat pours a super dark brown w/ an amazing two finger chocolate head. The head is super dense and pillow like, and really looks fantastic. Very good lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is a little sweet, with coffee and chocolate being the main things I get out of this. The taste is wild.. It's very creamy- almost like a beer cream soda in consistency. Definite chocolate, coffee, and something else I can't quite put my finger on in the taste. Feel is smooth, creamy, and super smooth, w/ a slight hop bite on the aftertaste. Overall, this is a nice beer. Not great, but a good session lager. Definitely worth trying. Cheers."

"overall, a pretty simple beer, but done very well and very nice to drink. sessionable. the reminds me more of an american stout, rather than a milk/ sweet stout, still a very good stout whatever you want to call it."

"Poured into an Irish pint glass. The beer is a nice charcoal black with an oatmeal colored head that dissipates to a light film. Random sticky lacing stays on the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts and smokey charcoal with hints of vanilla. The beer tastes of charred grains with a creamy sweat milk finish. The mouthfeel is smooth. Not too watery. Overall, a pretty decent stout from my home state."
""
""
"Starts dry and roasty and then tries to get sweet and chocolaty, but never quite gets there. It somehow manages to be somewhere in between an Irish Dry Stout and a Milk Stout. It even has a slight sour-ish twinge that many dry stouts exhibit. Moderate hopping leaves the finish tight and quick. Not bad, an interesting quaff to say the least...a four-pack of this could disappear pretty rapidly in the fridge. Tallboy cans are a good package for a tasty stout."
""
""
"D: This beer tastes like it should be higher in ABV, but it's not. I like it a lot, very drinkable, but I like to enjoy it over the course of an hour."
"Overall, this didn't do much for me. The body is the culprit. Its harsh carbonation really hampered my enjoyment."
"D- drinking this one doesn't feel right. almost like i'm drinking a chemical or something, i don't know. judging by their website's description, i'll assume that they were going for a lighter bodied stout that would be easily drinkable and more appealing to non-heavy-dark-beer drinkers. real stout fans however may find this one to be seriously lacking."
"Serving type: On Tap at the Blue Door Pub, St. Paul, MN"
"Hits the spot for a milk stout. Easy to drink and really good."
"Love this beer, much preferred from the can ... a real treat to drink. Quaffable for sure but it begs to be paired with some chocolate ... the obvious choice."
"Of the 6 sampled, this was 2nd best, behind the Abyss and in a virtual tie with Odell Bourbon, slightly ahead of Brooklyn Black Chocolate and Bells Expedition. Didn't offer a lot of aroma, little cream, a little chocolate, but was a big surprise in terms of flavors, great mixture of lactose, sweets, roast coming in behind. As a milk stout I'd expect it to be cloggingly thick, and Buffalo Sweat did not disappoint. This is good. It does kind of coat your tongue, but a swoosh of water addresses that. Very good stuff."
"O- I liked this, much more than who I shared it with. It was easily the creamiest, milkiest, milk stout that I've had. Wouldn't want a bunch of them, but enjoyable from time to time. Bring out a little more roast and this will improve greatly!"
"Slainte."
"I really like this beer. The only issue with a solid milk stout is that often the first sip is the best bc it soon covers your tongue and dulls my palate. Try this beer."
"Overall – A easily quaffable stout. Not bad – better than I was expecting."
"O: Goes down very easy, tasty, not too filling, mild kick, very nice representation of style. I highly enjoyed this brew and will definitely snag it again!"
"A solid offering in a style I pretty rarely drink. I'd imagine that this would be absolutely delicious on nitro."
"Picked up a can to try, I didn't realize this was classified as a milk stout otherwise I would have been more disappointed. I thought this was more of a straight-up US stout than milk stout. It is very drinkable--more drinkable than flavorful. Maybe a good substitute for Guinness--less bitter than that. Worth a try."
"This beer does everything it's supposed to do. Transcendental and delicious, while avoiding being cloying and remaining quite drinkable. Simply put, this is awesome."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees not knowing what to expect from a beer with a name like this. The beer poured really black and had a tan head. However that did not hang around for long. The beer had a nice subtle smoke hint to it but was not overpowering. I liked the beer and will buy again."
"Finally making my way into the Kansas beer scene. Taken me long enough... This stuff pours a deep garnet-brown topped by a finger of bright dirty light cream-tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate, light roasted malts, light maple syrup, and a general oatmeal-raisin cookie vibe. Very pleasing to the 'strils, indeed. The taste pretty much follows suit, with a touch more roast, more chocolate, a hint of molasses, and a vein of vanilla bean. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, a very tasty and enjoyable stout, one of the better beers I've had recently. Were it slightly darker and just a smidge thicker and heavier, this would be fantastic. Still, it's pretty damn good now..."
"Overall this was a fairly easy to drink, sessionable milk stout. Only ordered it because it was the only beer I hadn't had on the lackluster beer menus at Dave's Taverna during homecoming this past weekend."
"This beer is what it is and only what it is. It does what it is well... if, that is, that is what you it to be. Bottom line: give it to your buddy who is petrified of anything darker than an amber and watch him raise his brow at how easy it is to drink."
"Poured a almost blackish body with semi-tan head that died quick but left lace going down the glass. Mostly toasted, roasted and bitter chocolate on the aroma although some sweetness comes off as well. Somewhat thin and not so sweet for a sweet sstout but it is good. You get some sugariness and dark chocolate; just a little too dry and roasted for my pleasure as it is not as smooth and sweet as others in this genre. Finishes dry w/ a very lowkey hoppy crisp and I enjoyed this beer and it is cheap so no complaints."
"O - This is a pretty good milk stout that doesn't stand out in any particular way. The thinness detracts from the flavor profile."
"O- I think I'll pass on this one the next time it makes around to me."
"overall- it's okay, but I'm not sure I pick up any sweetness, is it really a Milk Stout?"
"Overall - Good beer to drink while putzing around the house. Doesn't require and doesn't really deserve a lot of concentration, but it's still a decent drink."
"Overall a solid beer. I enjoyed it. Wouldn't mind drinking it again."
"Overall - a nice beer. Not outstanding but tasty, especially for warmer weather."
"O: Meh, I don't think this is really all that bad, but its not all that great. I would rather have Left Hand's Milk Stout over this. Could be a decent stout for people looking to expand their horizons a bit."
"O- It reminds me of a less deep Sierra Nevada stout with a cream and vanilla character. Glad I tried it and would drink again, but I'm not sure I'd seek it out again."
"Part of the Labor Day round the pool tasting session like the previously reviewed hoptimus prime."
"Poured brown-black with a small but sturdy tanned head. Aroma of dark roasted malts, as would be imagined, bready, with some chocolate notes. More of the same in the taste: bready, malty, roasty, semi-sweet chocolate, nutty. Heavy-medium body, smooth, tasty, and quite nice to drink."
"I would drink a few of these rather easily. I think I found my new favorite milk stout in a CAN. Easy drinking that would be a easy dessert beer for many."
"Overall: Just an average stout. Would have liked the flavor to be a little more interesting. Not a lot of depth in taste."
"Taste is disappointing - much like the nose it is full of coffee, and without a whole of balance. Maybe a little chocolate, but not particularly smooth, it has a full body. Was hoping for a more enjoyable drink, but its not bad, particularly as a winter stout."
"Nice body on this milk stout. It is a medium body with very smooth carbonation. Overall, this is a very solid milk stout. People tend to go cray-cray over Left Hand Milk Stout, but I think this beer is better."
"Mild and creamy, watery gas station coffee and nutty malt sweetness. Flavors are similar, toasted marshmallow and watered down coffee. Mild sweetness and very mellow bitterness. Smooth and creamy, light bodied. Easy to finish the pint, didn't want another. Thanks for the beer J&R!"
"Overall this is a stout that I might try again. As I remember it on tap, it might be a bit more lively in flavor an mouthfeel. I'll look for it drought for more review."
"Pours a very dark brown with a dark mocha head that fades quickly and leaves lacing. Smell is dominated by roasted and smoky malt and coffee, also has sweet notes of chocolate. Taste has the smoky and malty backbone with all the coffee and chocolate notes coming through. The aftertaste is full of the smoky flavor. The flavors come through big, and deliver a great beer. The mouthfeel is a light medium, the beer is smooth but could be thicker. I would really enjoy trying this one as a nitro can. Since it isn't too heavy it is one that you can have a few of in one sitting without getting full. Overall a beer worth checking out, a great big stout flavor done well."
"Beautifully balanced and easy drinking stout. Slightly creamy and smooth."
"cheers."
"I'm not so sure I really like the name of Tallgrass' Buffalo Sweat (yuck!), but I sure do like the beer. It's smooth and sweetish, but balanced; and I love how the berry-like yeasty-fruitiness stands out against the caramelish, nutty, and fudge-like maltiness. And it's also very toasty, like darkly toasted bread crust. It's not particularly roasty (although it does have a coffee-like edge), and it doesn't have any of the biting, dark-malt acidity that can sometimes be detracting. The bitterness is limited but it somehow holds together without ever hinting at becoming cloying; and the hops are kept to a minimum, allowing the malt to be the main focus. I do get some of the ""milk stout"" sugary sweetness, but apart from that it's almost like a porter, or a darker and more malty brown ale. It's a little bit unique; and readily drinkable. Well worth trying."
"Decent stout. Not the 'dry Irish' kind, which works for me-- not too remarkable, but not bad."
"Not a bad milk stout. Pours a very dark brown with a thin head that fades away to a ring. A little light and sweet in the nose, but with a touch of nuttiness and a light roastiness along with the characteristic creaminess. The taste is quite creamy, with a delicious nuttiness and some light roasted notes following. A bit like an eggcream on the finish, and all around very pleasant. Very smooth and easy to drink, just a very pleasant beer."
"Overall, I think it's great. Smooth, not too big, bold and well balanced flavors. I'm a fan!"
"This stout is slightly above average for the style but I must give it bonus points for drinkability. It has a low abv and even drinks light for a stout. Unlike most stouts, it's one I could have a few of without feeling like I ate a loaf of bread."
"O: Overall, a decent milk stout that's quite drinkable and low enough abv to be nearly sessionable. It's nice to have an easy drinking stout out of a can."
"O - I could brink this as an all-nighter."
"M: Not quite as smooth as some stouts, has the right amount of carbonation though."
"Pours a dark coal color, with hints of brown at the edges. Creamy tan head. Smell is of chocolate ice cream. Taste is a hint of charcoal up front, followed by a nice mild sweetness, followed by some dark chocolate, and just a hint of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is good, although the carbonation is a little weird, almost seems like nitrogen, honestly its weakest point. Overall a very good beer, the strange carbonation or nitro is the only detracting factor."
"Overall I really enjoyed my second offering from this brewery. A very nice, refreshing light styled stout. Only measuring up at 5.00% if this was readily available to me I would probably make this my session Stout. Thanks to McNuts for this freebee!"
"O - A wide variety of flavors, that kinda works."
"Pours a midnight black body with a puffy khaki colored head that slowly fades. Aromas of dark sugar and black malts. Slightly moderate carbonation with a lightly silky mouthfeel. Flavor is somewhat weak given the appearance, aroma and name of the beer! A very accessible stout."
"This isn't a classic example, but it has some good flavors and hits some spots nicely."
"Nice cream ale finish. Easy to enjoy as a single, or through the course of an evening."
"A decently-flavored, roasty stout, though it needs a bit more body."
"Taste-Black coffee, dark chocolate. Very dry finish, faintly sour and astringent. Tastes more like a dry Irish stout than a sweet milk stout. A bit confusing, but an o.k. brew nevertheless."
"Comes off as a mass market attempt a producing a proper stout."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, a little thin but that wears off the longer you drink. Combined with the taste...just right for either quiet enjoyment or a session. At $1.99 a pint can....a very inviting experience."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking, yet favorable enough brew. Not sure I would specifically seek it out again, but all in all not bad."
"Overall, this beer just looks amazing! I can no say I have tried every Tallgrass I have found, and it is a great brewery."
"This isn't stellar for what it is, but there's certainly nothing wrong with good. I like it and would pick it up again."
"Overall: Like the other 3 in the variety pack, this beer is barely above average or just average. The 16 oz. cans are cool but that doesn't help make it a better beer. Until I hear differently about the quality I, likely, won't buy Tallgrass again."
"I would recommend that you seek this stout out it will never be in the same category as a DL or KtG but it should be a stout that any BA will enjoy."
"o - nice and complex for a milk stout."
"Deep dark pour here, black as night with a big head of foam on top reaching a height of around two fingers before settling back down to earth. Nice lacing coating the sides and making it super sticky. Aroma is coffee and sweet sugary notes. Hints of chocolate coming through now. It was an odd coffee aroma, almost a dark, french press kind of smell, which played off the sweetness in the milk stout extremely well. Really impressed here as even as it warmed it seemed to never dull. Rich, creamy feel, almost as thick as a milk shake. Creamy chocolate and rich velvety coffee notes slide together perfectly and leave the palate soaked in sweetness that is simply wonderful, and that is an understatement. Each sip becoming richer then the one before. Long lasting flavor of coffee balanced on the tongue and left a slightly dry finish soaked in vanilla notes."
"This and their DIPA are the only beers I've had from Kansas, but I'm glad to discover this brewery, particularly since they are canned."
"Pint can poured into pint glass. Appears typical stout color with a poor head and 0 lacing. Aroma is nearly non-existent although pleasant. Taste is flavorful however weak. There are next to no hops in this thing, and surely not quite enough malt either. Kind of watery and bland. This beer is certainly better than many macros, however needs more ingredient to make a proper beer. It tastes good, however it doesn't taste enough. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy."
"Overall, it has a bunch of taste, but some issues. I do not intend to buy it again."
"O: Overall it's an alright beer but it's a bit bland. The malt character doesn't stand out much, the head is very substantial but it looks way too large for a stout. It is sweet which is expected, but there's no real bitterness to counter-balance it. I would not buy it again if getting a sweet stout, but it's not a bad or awful stout by any means."
"O- Pretty good. Drinks really easy. Pretty much what I hoped for out of this beer"
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, a bit thin but relatively smooth. Drinks pretty easily but I wasn't too crazy about the flavor profile, everything felt a bit muted."
"Hate the name though."
"16 ounce can, 11 238 stamped on the bottom side of it. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is roasted malt, bittersweet and milk chocolate, and some coffee. The taste is just like the aroma, with a good balance between the sweet and bitter flavors. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a little on the thin side but also a bit coating with moderate carbonation. It's smooth and very easy to drink. I think it's a solid overall brew, I'd buy this again."
"Pours a very dark brown with hints of a deep dark red when held up to the light. Initially, had a two-fingered glistening tan head that slowly faded to a thin ring with some lacing. Smell is stronger than the taste. Strong aroma of chocolate with some coffee and roasted malt. Nice flavor, again chocolate dominates with some coffee and roasted malt and something that I can't quite identify, but something pleasant. Smooth, medium-bodied, but not watery. A little different take on the style. I enjoyed it and would buy it again."
"Overall a very nice milk stout. Does not have the heavy body I expected, very light drinking beer."
"Drank from the can while out on a little camping trip and when I opened the bottle I was loving the heavy coffee aroma coming through but I did see something I didn't like... The beer seemed a little watery (not the tast but the thickness of the liquid) and I prefer my stouts to be a little thicker but the actual taste put that to rest... This reminded me a lot of a toned down Breakfast Stout with the heavy coffee aroma and flavor taking and up front and center part in this beer and the sweetness and smoothness was outstanding... Would have liked to gotten this when I had appropriate glassware available for use but it seems to be readilly available near me so we will meet again...."
"Body seems a little light, and there is not much of a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is a bit higher for the style. Alcohol is hidden, making this very easy to drink. Enjoyable."
"Leaving the driveway the other day, my wife and I passed a Tallgrass van and became instantly curious as to what was soon to be. Seeing the 4 pack on the shelves yesterday, we now know. Poured a good black color with a small ring of light brown foam. Aromas of milk and bitter chocolate, coffee and cream. Light to medium bodied, with flavors of coffee, chocolate and roasted malt."
"Appears deep dark ruby tinted black with a light beige tan head forms fine even lacing down the sides of my standard pint glass. It's nice to have a tallboy of a Kansas brewed sweet stout. Aroma has sweet creamy dark chocolate and coffee notes going on with each sniff, no real herbal hop profile just nice sweet dessert like notes from the dark roasted malts and lactose additions. Drinks very sweet with hints of dark chocolate(cocoa) and mild coffeee notes, a bit of herbal hops and a tad more earthiness would help dry out the overt sweetness a bit. The lactose additions give it a super creamy factor, enjoyable flavor just overtly sweet compared to most of the stouts out there. Mouthfeel is again not to be repetitive but this beer is super creamy on the mouthfeel, carbonation is ample but works well with this medium bodied session stout. Overall thoughts thus far are best of the lot from what I've had, I enjoy IPAs and DIPAs with the best of the beergeeks out there, however this is one rockin' cream stout."
"Pitch black colored beer with a slowly fading creamy head.Aroma is light smoke.Taste is chocolate,smoked malts and light cream.Flavor is very light and watery,although it does go down relatively smooth.Overall it was nice to try once but I doubt I would ever buy again."
"This stout pours out nicely into a Guinness pint glass. The color a very deep brown with some burnt orange highlights. The head was a light tan color. The aroma was of some heavy roasted malts and a slightly soft aroma of some chocolate milk in there. The taste of this beer is enjoyable, it's got a big roasted malt base and the aftertaste bring in a little bit of a creamy buttery flavor. Pretty interesting stuff. The mouthfeel was decent for this style of beer. Pretty good though overall."
"O - Overall, a good beer. Nothing special, probably wouldn't buy it again, but did enjoy drinking the 4-pack i had"
"This is a solid sweet stout, simple and highly drinkable."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Light, smooth and sweet. Not bad for a Milky stout, but tastes too much like cola for me. I believe the description on the can that reads, 'Dangerously Dark', is a little exaggerated. Easily drinkable and light bodied."
"D: Great! Try one! Love how different the flavor profile is...pushes the limit of what this style dictates."
"Drink- About average for the style. The only stout on the menu to pair with dessert so I went for it. Probably wont go for it again in the future."
"One dimensional. Its a nice beer for a little while, but a lack of balance and depth sapped my enthusiasm. Gets boring pretty quick. Probably best to enjoy when you already have a buzz going and are no longer as descerning as you were earlier in the evening."
"Overall, Buffalo Sweat, despite the can, which some people just can't get past, is a decent sweet stout but nothing to sweat over. Can't say I don't still prefer Samuel Adams Cream Stout, but I enjoy this one."
"O: Not really a sweet stout, although there is plenty of lactose to go around."
"d - Overall a nice sweet stout. Lots of sweet milk chocolate in the nose and taste, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Would like to have again."
"Pours a dark brown color with a thin off-white head and not much retention or lacing. The nose is nice and creamy with a bit of chocolate and coffee. The sweetness comes through in the nose, and then hits a bit harder in the flavor. The chocolate and coffee interacted better in the nose, and the flavor lacked that complexity. Feel was nice and creamy with a medium body. Overall, pretty nice and enjoyable."
"M - Most interesting of any sweet stouts I've had, the carbonation isn't crazy and it is rather light, not creamy. A ""watery"" mouthfeel. But it makes it much better for a session beer."
"Very dark brown, tiny bits of lighter tinges around the edges. Head was a nice two fingers of medium brown head. The head must have been late, late for a very important date, as it dwindled down before I made it back to the computer, leaving practically nothing in it's wake. No matter, the aroma was brilliant, and I quickly stopped caring what the damn thing looked like. Not a coffee stout, but fresh dark roast coffee filled my personal space. Big roasted notes and bittersweet chocolate vie for limelight as well, along with sweetness and brown sugar. Quite intoxicating. The taste didn't disappoint either, though didn't wow quite as much. Coffee tastes were not as prevalent, giving way to more of the chocolate sweetness, roasted malty notes and sugary bits. The feel brings it down a notch. Felt a bit too watered down, and lacked a bit of substance that would have aligned the planets and knocked this out the park. In the end though, it doesn't detract too much from this brew as a whole: It's an amazing smelling, very tasty stout, worthy of keeping at hand."
"O: I enjoyed this brew and it compares well with some of the mid-to-upper-tier of the style. A little bit more body and smoothness and this would challenge the best sweet stouts. The 16oz tall boy is a nice change and welcome."
"Cool name, tasty beer, that makes this a solid purchase if the beer is available in your area."
"(D)- A decent stout. Kinda straightforward but easy enough to enjoy."
"An easy-drinking sessionable stout from Tallgrass though a bit on the thin side for my taste."
"D: very easy to drink, flavors are mild and not too strong, almost leaves me wondering how this would be on cask or nitro-tap"
"D: Very drinkable"
"The mouthfeel is a little on the light side for a stout. But, the good overall mix of flavors and relatively low abv make this very drinkable. Not too sweet which is a plus to me. Good brew."
"Personally I expected a little more from this ""Stout"" i.e. flavor, body, and carbonation. I must note that I didn't know this was a Milk Stout when I bought it and have not had too many of this style."
"Overall a good example of the style compared to the few others that I've had. It would probably be better on cask or at room temp."
"Overall, not a great stout."
"Pours dark brown, small white head, light lacing. Fantastic aroma, mostly roasty malts, and lightly sweet. Taste has a wonderful balance between the bitter roastiness, the sweet malts, and the nice malty background. Light chocolate and some lactose presence keep everything in balance, but I like how the roast is the star but not overdone. Body is medium-full for the style, which I really like. Incredibly drinkable. I think I've already gone through a case and half of this stuff only a few months after it became available here. Fantastic beer from a can and I can't wait to try their others."
"I thought this was a pretty good Milk Stout, with lot of creamy sweetness, robust roasted flavors, and some fresh hoppy character that added complexity and balance to this. There is a nice easygoing drinkablility to this as well, considering the heft of the flavors at times. Another nice effort from Tallgrass."
"M/D - light bodied, watered down, light carbonation, easy to drink but lacking any strong flavors."
"D - Easy drinking stout. Flavors are smooth, well integrated. Workable ABV. Palette is not overwhelmed by the flavors. A sessionable stout."
"Medium bodied, low carbonation, very smooth, and easy to drink. This beer is not as full or creamy as it could be, but at 5% abv, I think the folks at Tallgrass did a nice job. Not every stout has to have 10 % abv, and I like this one quite a bit the way it is."
"Light roasted malt flavor up front. Slight cardboardy edge. Carob and graham cracker sweetness percolate through the palate. Light coffee flavors as well. Tobacco and milk chocolate near the finish. Faint bitterness in the end, but this is a mainly sweetish stout. Moderate body with a slightly thin feel. Pretty good, but could be better."
"D-,,nicely drinkable more like a winter warmer to me lots of b4 mentioned flavor..recommend this one"
"Thanks Barrett for bringing this brew to town!"
"This beer pours a nice oily black with a small tan head that quickly evaporates into just a inkling of a line around the inside of the glass. No lacing and no head retention. The aroma is interesting. Astringent coffee, a bit of chocolate, and tobacco smoke. Whats interesting is that I've read tobacco as a descriptor but never had experienced it. Now I have and its a bit distinct. The flavor is a watered down version of the aroma. The chocolate is there but its weak. Coffee flavor reminds me of the work coffee where people only use about 1/2 of what they are supposed to. The aroma is enjoyable but the flavor is just weak. The mouthfeel is also rather watery. No body. Overall, its a decent beer but not something I would pick up again. I'll stick with their IPA or Oasis next time."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Would I buy more of it? - definitely. I've got one more can and I will be said when I have to say goodbye."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: The body is a little thin and there is probably a bit too much carbonation. Not the best feel, but it is a very drinkable beer overall. I think this is Tallgrass' best selling beer, and I can understand why. Very enjoyable."
"Still, solid brew"
"Pours a very dark, almost black color. Big bubbles dominate the head with little retention. Strong coffee and chocolate flavors dominate the beer, with a more sweet flavor than other stouts. Finishes mostly smooth, with a little harshness. Very easy to drink and is good cold."
"Despite me sounding negative, This is a very good budget stout, and especially a good one for bridging people over to stouts."
"This was an OK beer for me. Not too good and not that overly bad either. I would purchase it again, but definitely not on a regular basis. Great beer Tallgrass Brewing!"
"Value: 6.85 for four 16 oz cans. A good deal."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Tasty but light bodied, it goes down quite easily. Definitely better the name."
"Medium body, tastes a bit watery. It has hardly any carbonation. This really kills the beer in my book. Maybe I got a bad can (if that is even possible)... but I don't know if I would bother trying this one again."
"Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat Stout pours a thin head over an opaque black brew. Carbonation seems relatively active, though, as is always the case with stouts, it's hard to tell, inky blackness being inky and blacky. The nose is pretty typical too- roasty coffee and bitter chocolate mostly, with notes of molasses. The flavor is also pretty typical- charred ends of fresh baked bread, a note of baker's chocolate off the back, a little herbal hop in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and crisp- maybe a little too light for a stout, and semi-dry. Just a tad one dimensional, this beer might be better thought of as an introduction to stouts, or even as a session beer, since It doesn't seem that alcoholic. Not bad, but not that distinctive- I do like that this is one of a growing number of canned craft beers."
"Very sweet milky smoothness, but ends with a bitter finish. Much drier than any other milk stout I have ever had. Chocolate and roast on the palate. Not bad for a 5% stout. They pack a lot of flavor in it."
"This beer pours an opaque black color. The head is one inch of rocky light tan foam that recedes into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and roasted malt. the taste is of roasted malt, and burnt malt. There are some nice coffee and chocolate flavors in the finish with a moderare bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very nice beer. It isn't overpowering, but it doesn't try to be. It is complex nonetheless. I will certainly drink this beer again."
"If you were to give us the object 'beer' to go with the comfortingly one-dimensional nose and flavor Tallgrass might have a massive winner here for drinkability. This is a Sweet Stout that I could drink on a fall or winter weekend, all weekend. Even with some major flaws, I gulped this one down and really want another."
"Drinkability: This lacks the depth and the balance of maltly/lactose sweetness that other top milk/sweet stouts have. None the less it is still an easy drinking stout."
"All in all, a nice, easy drinking stout. Could be fuller, could be richer, but this is what it is, and it's pretty nice. I'd have one again, but I don't think I'd seek it out. There's richer, fuller stouts that'll grab my dollars."
"D: A pretty decent sweet stout. The best part about it for me is that it isn't too sweet like some others I've had. Unfortunately some of roasted malts give too much of a burnt characters at times. Otherwise, this is a solid sessionable sweet stout."
"D-Maybe the best Sweet Stout I have had. I could session this for awhile as I despite the sweeter flavors I think it drinks fine. I'll have to give a few at a time a try because I do plan on drinking a lot more of this one. Would love to a side-by-side tasting with left hand."
"Hey kids, what time is it? Nope, not Howdy Doody time, sorry. It's Crack & Glug time! Yay! I initially got a finger-and-a-half of mocha-tan head, but it was fading pretty quickly in the face of tonight's humidity. Color was an inky dark, not quite black thanks to the deep-brown at the edges, but dang close. Nose was ... what did I say about chocolate? This was like a liquid milk chocolate bar. Save the Reese's for a dry stout. This would be at home with a simple Hershey's bar. A quick diabetes reading and I am good to go. I CANnot take too sweet a beer as a hophead. Mouthfeel was full, almost creamy and now I am shaking the CAN for the presence of a widget. Nope, just naturally that thick. Zounds! Finish was equally creamy and sweet, like a chocolate milkshake. Winner! I probably would not want more than one, but this would be a great accompaniment with dessert."
"May be a new standby for me, replacing Surly Bender since it is about $2 cheaper per 4 pack. Glad I have 3 more to enjoy."
"Solid black color with a small tan head that hangs around for awhile. The head settles to a thin cap. Light spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is just what I would expect a stout of this style to smell like. Balanced between the roasted malt and the lactose sweetness. The flavor is a little sweeter than almost any other stout and that is what I guess the brewer was shooting for. Some bitterness from the roasted malt but overall this is a rather tame stout. The body is also just a touch thin. In my opinion a little overcarbonated as well. A very approachable stout that is nicely crafted. Just a little too sweet without enough malt character."
"Drinks well and represents the style nicely. This is an enjoyable and well done milk stout. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: A solid, malty and drinkable Sweet Stout. Good session beer overall, even if there is no ""wow"" factor. Probably would be better with a slightly bigger body and a touch more bitterness."
"Pours a black body with a decent sized brown head. However, it ""fizzes"" away. Not what I'd expect from a milk stout, buy only a minor flaw. Nice aroma. Chocolatey and roasty. Body and mouthfeel are very weak. Watery and thin. Hardly any body at all. Not very creamy. Very little carbonation. Flavor is pretty dull as well. Baseline roast and coffee, but pretty weak. This one does not impress me. The other two I had from this brewery did however. Their Canned IPA and Canned English DIPA."
"Overall an easy drinking beer, but not somthing I can see myself buying again."
"Drinks easy, but was better in the bottle, seemed creamier"
"Smell is a blend of milk chocolate and cappuccino aromas. The taste brings out more of the lactose milk sweetness. The body is lighter, like the consistency of 1% milk. It still has a creamy texture and goes down very easy."
"A dark black color with a fair chocolaty tan head and decent lacing. The aroma says goodly malt and charcoal with deep grass, decent. The grass holds on to dominate the flavor with more sweet molasses malt. There's lots of charcoal with meager carbonation, smooth and medium-plus bodied and reasonably drinkable. There's some red wine and charred oak. Qualities of the aromal dominates but the taste is decent. A nice try at a stout, worth sampling for sure."
"D: Not something that I could have many of in one sitting but still drinkable."
"Overall this is a solid milk stout."
"Pours a black color. 1/2 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, slight oatmeal, yeast, slight coffee, grain, slight hop, hint of pale malt, and a hint of earthy malt. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and creamy with an average carbonation level. Tastes of oatmeal, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, yeast, slight hop, hint of wood, hint of coffee, and slight alcohol. Overall, good aroma, blend, body, and complexity."
"Poured into a pint glass pours a jet black with no head. Smell is roasted malt profile with hints of chocolate. Taste is just like the smell nice roasted flavor with a slight thin mellow finish, very high drinkability. This beer goes down very smooth and would be a nice session brew, overall no to bad."
"Drinkability: A wonderful, enjoyabe, drinkable stout. This is a great brew from the Tallgrass Brewing Company that I would definitely have again. Would be great on a cool day, still good on a warmer day."
"Buffalo Sweat is more flavorful than say Yuengling Black and Tan but the texture keeps it in the same vein."
"Pours a light black or very dark brown, light tan head that looks good enough to drink. Aromas of chocolate, vanilla, oat, and husky grains, I dig it. Tastes of chocolate malts with lots of bread and doughy finish. Some phenolic band-aid-like off-flavors. Medium to thin for a milk stout, though nice smooth lower carbonation. Overall I like this, especially the aroma, though some minor off-flavors hindered my enjoyment."
"A good beer. I look forward to more from this brewery."
"A nice little milk stout. A good nightcap paired with a chocolate or vanilla dessert. My only real complaint is that I'd like the mouthfeel to be a bit chewier."
"Pours a standard black with a respectable tan head about 2/3 of an inch thick. Head settles to a fine ring within a minute. Smells of deep roasted chocolate. Light amounts of alcohol mingle with creamy vanilla also noted. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, carbonation is good, soft. Roasted malts dominate the palate but not too aggresively. Light amounts of sweetness noted. A touch of creaminess. Aftertaste hangs around for a while but doesn't bring anything new to the table. Very easy drinking. Was pleasantly surprised by an unknown brewery out of Kansas. Would drink it again and am willing to try the IPA."
"From the pour, it is a very thin beer, especially for a stout. However, the smell is unbelievable. This is definitely a dessert beer. It has a nutty caramel smell. It tastes like a caramel milk stout...yum. I could give up junk food for good if I just had this beer to drink. For an average drinker, they would probably not want to drink this beer all night, but I sure can."
"Thanks, Geoff, for the chance to try this one."
"Very good beer especially if you like the taste of coffee the only improvement that could be made is to tone down the coffee flavors allowing the sweet maltiness to stand out a little more"
"Drinkability - I can't get enough of this one, again might be too much for some, but man I love this beer!"
"D: It's easy to drink, but I do not think I'd really want to have this one again. That said, it gets bonus points for a very creative name."
"12oz bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of dark tan head. Lots of chocolate and cocoa in the aroma. Lactose sweetness and chocolate malt dominate the flavor. Medium bodied and smooth. Some hop bitterness in the middle. Long dry finish of roasted barley/black patent. Just a hint of burnt flavor in the finish. Solid beer. One of the better Tallgrass offerings."
"Mouthfeel is offputting. Very thin and uncomfortable on the tongue."
"Drinkability? I wouldn't drink bottles back to back but it's definitely an easy drinker for the 1 bottle. Good stuff."
"Incredibly drinkable for a stout."
"Enjoyable for sure, I just prefer a bigger, rounder, more assertive stout."
"I've enjoyed the beer, and it's a step in the right direction for the young brewery. I'll be looking forward to new beers as the brewery grows."
"Roasty and toasty brew, glad to have the sixer brought to me by my niece from Lawrence, Ks."
"D - This tastes and drinks more like a dry stout. Still it is a pretty good and easy drinking/sessionable brew."
