"Glass- Snifter"
""

""
""
""
""

""
"The flavor profile is world class - intense, somewhat complex and nicely balanced.  It begins with a burst of espresso that slowly subsides to reveal a rich underlying malt sweetness with chocolate notes.  The middle has  a slight roast bitterness that fades allowing a nice burst of lemon to come forward.  The finish is a slightly sweet lingering espresso flavor that is slightly tart.  The 7.5%ABV is completely hidden."
""
"O: A good overall brew, nice coffee flavor but not as unique as I imagined it to be. Does not compete with many other coffee stouts."
""
"Served on tap into a pint glass, looked almost exactly like a flat glass of Coca-Cola, right down to the thin spotty head. Roasted coffee odor. Tastes of espresso, roasted malt, faint notes of brown sugar, finishes with quick flash of lemon peel. Mouthfeel fairly thin with a bit of creaminess. Alcohol almost completely disguised, but you start to taste it (and feel it) a few sips in. This is a beer without many flaws and without many memorable features either. I can't help but feel that pouring an splash of iced coffee with a twist of lemon in a milk stout might end up with the same result."
""
"I enjoy the beer but find it to be one dimensional."
""
"12 oz bottle poured in a snifter. Coffee flavor was just not as enjoyable in this one for me in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"The lemon peel (possibly because of something I drank before it) added a bitterness that made this undrinkable for me."
"Base flavor of corn and wheat.  Hefty amount of dry espresso.  Lemon peel is faint.  Finish is dry with some grainy texture."
"I'm not getting a lot of espresso, but it's a great tasting beer, so I really don't care!"
""
"Decent brew definitely something different but a one and done for me"
""
""
"FEEL: Full, though not rich. Not memorable. Fit the stout profile."

"This is a very interesting and unique beer.  I think it would be much better with 35-40 IBU's.  I may have to use this as a starting point to create my own.  The lemon and stout go together quite nicely, surprisingly.  1 bottle is plenty for a while, but recommended if you want to try something decidedly different."

"Big coffee and toasty dark brown malts for the most part. Comes short on the body and roast for me a bit but cant complain on the fresh espresso tones. Lemon peel doesn't do much and I fail to seen the point in using it."
""
"Yes, the taste.   Taste like beer."
"Well constructed beer and enjoyable on a wintry day."
""
"Deep dark brown in color.  The nose has definite coffee notes.  The flavor profile includes both roasted malts and coffee.  The finish is nicely roasted and with a bitter cocoa essence."

"Overall, not bad.  It is much different from most of the stouts and porters I've had, but maybe not one that I'd seek out going forward."
""
"O - one of my biggest letdowns to date, this is the third craft beer in 10 years that was a drain pour for me, I just couldn't muscle thru it. However it was my first time drinking it and I am hoping it was just a bad bottle. I will be giving it another try and if its any better review will be adjusted, highly disappointing considering Southern Tier really impresses me otherwise"
"Pours to a thin, cream-colored head with minimal lacing.  The color is black and opaque.  Held up to the light, slight reddish brown hues become visible from the black.  The aroma is mild, with a malty, chocolate type of odor.  Creamy in texture, with a malty, chocolate type of flavor up front and a moderate coffee bitterness finish.  Pretty full-bodied, especially for a beer with such low carbonation.  Good price too.  Purchased for $1.59 a bottle or $8.99 build your own 6-pack."
"Taste-Full-on great coffee flavor, subtle citrus/lemon note. Too-thin body hurts the score here. A fuller, more rounded body and better mouthfeel would help greatly. Still a solid effort."
"Chocolate malts, lactose, strong coffee bean, espresso, lemon peel and a peppery jalapeno or habenero meet the palate in a touch too thin presentation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good, I like this better than 2X Stout. Nice coffee flavours and a good deal more complex."
""
"Black with khaki head. Roasted coffee bean aromas. Coffee flavor up front, roasted malt. Medium mouthfeel. Coffee flavor is cloying."
"Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a hint of burnt astringency that lingers for a bit."
""
""
"A unique """imperial""" milk stout. Coffee and lemon well-used. Rich, robust and enjoyable."
""
""
"Poured in terrapin tulip. Dark black with little head. Taste was moderately bland with slight notes of coffee. Definitely expected more from this."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth: Medium body. Creamy and soft. Low carbonation. A high bitterness that's just perfect for this stout."
""
"Overall this was an okay beer. I probably exaggerated about how bad it was above. Truth be told, as I progressed through my glass, it grew on me. Still, won't get it again."
""
""
"Overall, a good winter seasonal that stops short of really hammering down on any one particular flavor. I would have loved more coffee."

"I was very excited to try this beer, as I have never been let down by a Southern Tier offering (so obviously I enjoy the sweetness they add to their beers).  This one is interesting enough, but I see it as nothing more than a creative recipe that is fun to try, but doesn't exactly leave you wanting more.  The taste of the beer seemed very artificial to me.  You can definitely taste all the flavors advertised, I am just of the opinion that it's not very well done.  The coffee is definitely there, as is the lemon peel, they just feel fake and the thinness of the beer does not help the cause.  Overall, this is just an average beer to me, but fun to try if you are sick of traditional style stouts/porters."
"O - A very interesting beer, with strong black coffee roots, but enough malt, caramel, and chocolate notes to keep things varied and interesting.  A touch more bitter than my favorite coffee brews, it still works well and offers a nice contrast to other stouts."
""
"12 ounce bottle, looks like the bottled on date is 12/04/14.  Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch light tan head.  Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  The brew smells like coffee, caramel, chocolate, lemon peel and lactose/sugar.  I think the taste is just like the aroma, with the coffee, chocolate, lactose and caramel flavors being the strongest, but with the lemon peel/citrus definitely noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation.  I wasn't sure how the lemon peel/citrus would work with a milk stout, but I think it turned out good.  It's worth trying at least once, I know I wouldn't mind trying this again.  $1.84 for a single bottle."
""
""
"Well it's noon so about time to try a breakfast type brew and this has espresso in the name so let's give it a whirl.  Popping the top I get a waft of sweetness of malt and a roasted malts.  Pours to a barely tranlucent motor oil with a three fonger multi-size bubble tan head.  On the taste this brew has the bitterness of coffee upfront with the sweet roasted malts and a solid middle of a nearly balanced cocoa and earthy hops, finishing with a slight alcohol twinge and a fading chaulky bitter finish.  Tasty indeed.  More hop twangy than I expected in a good way.  Great mouthfeel.  A spot on brew for brunch."
""
""
""
"My only complaint is that the coffee tastes burnt to me. The slight lemon in the finish is quite refreshing though."
""
"Purchase Value â€“ (A): I was able to secure a bottle of this for a fantastic price of $1.99, which is well worth it, according to our grading matrix. A six-pack was being sold for just under $10.00, which is a steal considering the quality of this brew."
"O: awesome  beer. the nose could use some work IMO."
""
""
""
"Wow, this has become one of my favorite brew.  Smooth, love the coffee stout taste."
""
""
""
"Pours dark and creamy. Coffee in your face. A bit on the bitter side. Nice and delicious."

"Overall it is quite a good beer much better than their standard 2x stout. I would get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Enjoyable, but not really what I was expecting.  The coffee should compliment the lactose and the lemon peel should compliment the coffee.  Too much acidity from the coffee is a bit of a turn off."
""
""
""
""
"Just wasn't alot of coffee to this one!!!"
"Not heavy enough on the coffee and just to much bite."
""
""
""
"The coffee flavor is off, semi burnt.  It does not mix well with what little chocolate flavor is present.  And how this is a milk stout I do not know and it was watery and not very sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't wait until a little later today when I will have another of these."
""
""
"Enjoyable, a nice sweet take on the style, well worth a go"
"O- Much different from your typical coffee stout.  I wasn't sure if truly enjoyed it at first but, after making my way through most of a six-pack, this is a great beer that offers a different approach from the usual."

"O - This is a good coffee stout. Lots of strong roasted flavors throughout. Nice beer."
"not bad but not awesome.  Would drink again if it was sitting in front of me."
""
""
"O:  This is relatively fresh and the coffee is going strong."
""

"Nice beer. Not really a milk stout. More a regular stout. Great nose that leads to an equal amount of coffee. Nice robust loads of it. I love coffee beers, but most just don't come off quite right. This is pretty much what you want out of one. I don't get any lemon peels though."
""
"Looks like a coffe stout, smells like a coffee stout, and tastes like a coffee stout.  Tastes of coffee and roasty malts.  Very little sweetness for a milk stout.  It's not very bitter as you are drinking it, but leaves an unpleasant bitter aftertaste on the back of your tongue... kinda like if you get soap mouth bitter.  The lemon peel, which I looked for and looked for with both my nose and my taste buds, is so well hidden that I only knew it was there because the label told me so.  Mouthfeel was a medium body with a pleasant level of carbonation.  Overall it was OK, but not worth seeking out again... many other better coffee porters and stouts out there."
""
""
""
"Deep brown/black into the snifter. Literally no head. I've seen prettier stouts. The aromas however were spot on, BIG bitter and roasty coffee nose. Dark roast coffee to a t. Lemon peel, check. As advertised. I love bitter. This beer brings the bitter big time. Nice balance between roast and lemon peel. Coffee. Nice, coating mouthfeel. Nailed the coffee aspect. My only question is... aren't 2x brews supposed to be double/Imperial? Just asking. Excellent brew."
""
""
""
"Really bitter coffee is about all I'm getting here. Didn't detect the lemon at all"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor: meh. Very lacking, no pop, wheres the roast malts and sweetness, heck wheres the bitterness from the coffee or esspresso?! Pretty damn bland even after warming for a good half hour, lame yet again. S.t. The only thing you do consistantly well is make me curious and let me down hard! Thanks for nothing again S. T. !!"
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a huge fan of this type of beer but I tried it at the brewery. It was drinkable. Tasted like coffee with a lemony after taste. Good if you like this type of beer."
""
""
"Overall: A really good Coffee Stout. Big roasty taste of coffee and chocolate with a nice light touch of lemon."
"O: A very nice iteration of 2xStout, with plenty of coffee and extra roastiness.  Far from an imperial stout as well, really bringing out the lactose and coffee in full force. Kinda wish this was year-round along with the regular double stout"
""
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/10/2014. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, lemon peel, caramel, toast, cream, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, lemon peel, and light herbal hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, lemon peel, caramel, toast, cream, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, lemon peel, caramel, toast, light char, light herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, lemon peel, and light herbal hop flavors; with a good malt bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice coffee milk stout. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, lemon peel, and light herbal hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"My favorite beer is Founder's Breakfast Stout, so I tend to buy any stout I see with coffee in it. If you like FBS, I would recommend this beer. Strong coffee flavor. Thick and syrupy. Just like I likes m'stouts. Really, it's probably the closest thing I've tried to FBS that wasn't actually FBS, which is nice because FBS sold out incredibly quickly at my store this year. Basically saw it, bought it, came back two weeks later and they were already out. This beer is also considerably cheaper since it comes in a sixer, which is nice, though it's also a """mere""" 7.5% ABV, which may be good or bad depending on the situation."

"Good stuff from ST, but Breakfast Stout remains my go to coffee beer."
""
""
"O: The sweetness of it eventually overtakes the coffee roast, but that isn't a bad thing. It's very drinkable, and enticing especially to those with a sweet tooth."

"Overall: When life gives you lemons, make lemon...coffee...beer. Okay admittedly I wasn't fond of this flavor combination. This is one instance where I would have preferred to have one of the flavors that is listed on a beer label not come through. But the lemon flavor and aroma is really in there in force! If you're the type of person who thinks """do you know what would go good with coffee? Lemonade and beer!""" then this one is for you. For a coffee stout it is decent. With the flavor combination as a whole, I would not buy this again and I would not recommend it."

"This is a very nice coffee stout. It's basically Mokah Lite. Nice brew, and it's one of the better brews in the 2X series, in my opinion. Recommended."
""
"Overall I very much enjoyed this beer, most milk stouts are too sweet but the lemon helped cut the sweetness"
""
"Very good coffee milk stout, smooth and creamy. The citrus is not overpowering, but present."
""
""
""
""
"This was much better than I thought it would be, one of the better new beers from Southern Tier lately."
""
"O: very pleased with this offering from Southern Tier. Not a big fan of their other stout offerings, I'm not sure how those fans will respond - this is lighter and less heavy-sweet, with a bright lemon character to lighten the stout."
""
"The coffee and lemon peel got to be very acidic. Gave me heartburn. Tasty beer, but the lemon was way overpowered by the coffee."
""
""
""
"As the fullish-bodied stout trails to suggest dryness and roasted angles, another type of bitterness emerges from the roast and is gentle of grapefruit, orange and lemon. Though the stout celebrates its lemony tone in its description, its actual taste is hardly more than it achieved by pacific northwest hops."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an interesting concept for a beer, and overall it's solid. However, with all of the phenomenal coffee stouts out there, I probably will not be purchasing this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and I think it's a decent example of a Coffee Stout, but in the end I found it to taste more like regular black coffee than a espresso and the aroma made this beer rough around the edges.  This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, a little creamy, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention, I think one would be my limit, any more than that and I might start to get bored with it.  What I like the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both good and to me they were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't good and it had some off aspects to it.  I wouldn't buy this beer again, it was nice to try once, but it isn't something that I feel the need to revisit any time soon.  If you really like Coffee Stouts it might be worth a try, but i wouldn't recommend it as a standout example of the style.  All in all this wasn't bad beer, but in the end I just wasn't a big fan of it and I found the off aromas to be a little surprising.  It's not a favorite beer from this brewery and it's not a favorite for the style either.  This beer just wasn't for me and I think it could use a little bit of work, better luck next time guys."

"F- Well carbonated  despite head dissipation.   Rather thin feeling though."
""

""

"Comes across with a very bright flavor, a slight bit of booze on the back, and finishes with  dark chocolate and vanilla.  For some reason I also got a slight hint of pepper, but maybe that was just the alcohol or the lemon finish.  Easy drinking, and very very good.  My staple brewery hasn't let me down again."
"One of my highest ratings ever. Excellent stout, huge on roasted coffee flavor with the espresso beans very forward in the profile, not subtle. I loved this beer and could drink it all the time. Probably my new favorite stout."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a coffee colored head. The smell is full of coffee and espresso beans that liven the palate quite easily. The taste is very rich and sweet from the toasted malt giving off a creamy sweetness of dark chocolate and then a rush of espresso flavors brightens up the finish. It was heavy in mouthfeel although had a very clean aftertaste. Would definitely try again and hope this stays around."
""
""
"Pour into a tulip dark mahogany with 1/2 inch head that laced the glass nicely. Sweet nose with a bitterish coffee finish. Smooth, well carbonated...tasty."
"The taste has plenty of coffee yet still enough base of dry roasted malt to anchor the slight bitter flavors with mild acidity from the beans and light earthy flavor -it is really a coffee-dominant taste wtih slight alcohol in the finish. I would not be able to tell you it has lemon rind in it except for the label but perhaps that adds to some of the bitterness from the coffee in the roast flavor that lingers. Overall a good stout with lots of espresso -very good but more bitter than it needs to be -somewhat dry for the style and medium strength."
""
"Extremely good. Very balanced, the espresso comes through quite mildly, fuller at warmer temperatures, I'm sure would be more pronounced on tap. The lemon peel must just be enough to stimulate the flavors, much like lemon zest in cooking, so don't go looking for or get put off by the prospect of coffee lemonade.  Personally I would like a more intense coffee experience, nevertheless another superb brew from Southern Tier."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor reveals roast malt and coffee, slightly acrid and bitter, with raw bean notes. The finish is harsh. Sweet lactose saves the day, along with that characteristic chocolate from southern tier. There's a touch of lemon in the aftertaste, but I wouldn't have picked it out of a lineup."
""
"Between that weird chemical-like flavor I'm subtly getting, almost nonstop coffee, and """sharp""" sweetness, I'm left with a pretty mediocre beer. Some coffee heavy beers are excellent ... this just isn't one of them. Worth a try, but that's about it -- it's just too """eh""" with too much of a three-packets-of-sugar-in-a-black-cup-of-coffee vibe."
"This is a very good beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells of malts and coffee; pours dark- almost black; delicious, very happy to see a coffee stout offering from Southern Tier. Best I've had since SixPoint's 3Beans a couple years ago."
