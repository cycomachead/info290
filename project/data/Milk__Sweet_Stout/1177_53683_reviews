"O- Great beer. It doesn't overpower you on the coconut front, but delivers plenty of it to make any Mounds lovers happy."

"I dont like sweet stouts. I dont like coconut in my beer. I LOVE 3 hour tour. They nail this beer. Its like drinking a mounds bar, but not too sweet, not overwhelmingly coconutty...I honestly didnt think I would like this beer, but loved it. It was only 1 of 4 that I had multiple pours of.  Worthy of hype."

"O- super smooth and sweet a delight to drink"
"Served with a thin finger of beige head topping off a dark brown brew. Aroma is first and foremost coconut, followed up with sweet chocolate. Dessert is served. Taste is like the aroma, all I can think of is this is a like a liquefied Mounds bar, with minimal sweetness. Absolutely delicious. Each drink is as exciting as the first. An amazing beer. Carbonation is light which works well for this beer, body is silky but not at all overpowering. This is easily the best milk stout I have had. Well worth the hype. Too busy enjoying this beer to take good notes. This is an easy one to rate-I know I'll be getting at least one of these every time I find it on tap at one of the Town Hall locations."

"Coconut...coconut....with a trace of coconut. I would choose this beer over Proprietor's every time."

"Overall - Good, but I'm clearly missing the hype."

"O- This was a great milk stout that found the perfect balance between sweetness and creaminess. After being in the growler for almost a month, this beer held up fairly well in every aspect except the retention of the head and a slight loss of carbonation but other then that it tasted and smelled fantastic. I would love to drink this beer and I would highly recommend it especially if you like sweet milk chocolate that isn't too rich."
""
"Overall. Unique and absolutely delicious. Probably the best feel I've come across, and that coconut, fantastic. Thanks again Ryan!!!"
"Perhaps my favorite part about Three Hour Tour is how the roast feels like it melts away into a coconut taste. Worth tracking down. Thanks for shipping Gord!"
"Big thanks goes out to caSSino for sharing this one during the One Year Anniversary of My Wreck Tasting and to MBrausen for sending it to him! Served from growler into a Crooked Stave ‘Crooked Line’ tulip. Poured pitch black with a one finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, coconut, and cream. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk, cream, coconut, subtle roasted malt, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. As stated in a few other reviews including aasher who was drinking off the same growler, think Mounds. That pretty much nails the aroma almost exactly. The flavor was very nice as well with a very nice sweetness aspect going on. Loads of coconut going on in both areas. Wish it would have been a little thicker on the mouthfeel to take it up another notch. Very well done brew that I would suggest to any craft beer veteran or n00bie alike."
"Been after this one for a full year, finally landed a growler and was disappointed across the board. Aroma lacked depth, showing minimal vanilla and only traces of coconut. Taste is similarly shallow. Begs for more lactose, coconut, and overall depth of flavor. Last Snow puts Three Hour Tour to shame."
"This is one heck of a beer. Loads of coconut, but not so much that I can't taste the rest of it. A stunning, delicious dessert of a beer. I don't even really like coconut that much, but it's so fine and gentle in this beer that I can't help but enjoy it."
"Cost: $18 for a 64 oz growler."
"M: Medium bodied. Drinks easy."
""
"Absolutely wonderful, I could easily take down two full growlers of this for myself. Great balance in the flavor and the mouthfeel is a dream. Wish I could get more of this one and this rates up there with the best in the style."
""
"This one pours a medium bodied dark chocolate brown in color with a slight beige lacing around the glass. The nose is full of coconut and milk chocolate with an ever so slight roast. Wowzers, so much coconut. The flavors too are full of chocolaty coconut aka Mounds. It isn't complex but damn is it effective. It drinks kind of light in body with an off dry finish. It's a really easy, light yet sweet stout. Overall this was an excellent beer. I'm glad it was as advertised."
""
"O - Not sure here. I think this one went bad, but I have nothing else to compare it to here. Barely drinkable."
""
""
"Pours black with a thin off-white head. Smell is roast malt, chocolate and coconut, quite good, but given the way some people have raved about the smell, not quite up to that level. Flavor, however, is quite fantastic. I absolutely love coconut and this is incorporates it into the roasty and chocolate flavors so well. It manages to taste like a candy bar without being too sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer is damn tasty and doesn't disappoint. It manages not to be a gimmick beer despite the fun flavors."
" Overall, a very interesting and well made beer, worth seeking out if they make it again."
""
"O: If you like coconut and chocolate, you will love this. Not the best drinkability since it is a dessert beer, but it's pretty tasty and smells amazing."
"This beer is quite sweet. Maybe not something for everyday, but a very tasty treat."
"Overall: A very good milk/sweet stout. A sweet dessert beer that is big on flavor but manages to keep the sweetness in check. The coconut brings a nice kick."
"Draft at the brewery. Black pour with a tan head. Aroma is up front chocolate and coconut. Flavor is just blatant coconut with a bit of lactose and chocolate behind. Finishes too sweet, extremely cloying, yet good carbonation. I couldn’t finish even half of my pint. This beer is far too sweet. I have a feeling a 5 ounce glass would have been a much better serving size, but even that might be a bit much even for a dessert beer. I wouldn't want to eat a mounds bar and I sure don't want to drink the liquid form of it."

"O- One of the best beers at ABR. If you like coconut beers, this is a must try. Not sure if I could consume this is large amounts due to how rich it is, but still one of the best Milk Stouts I've had."

"Overall I thought it was a fantastic beer. After being somewhat disappointed with Mango Mama and Czar Jack I was hesitant to trade for any more of their special beers. This one however really wowed me and I loved that it was so unique and unlike anything I've ever had before. The coconut was so good in it and complimented the sweet stout flavors perfectly for the style. I'd definitely say that this is a new favorite of the style for me. Not being a big coconut fan I was completely surprised at how much I liked this one."
"O: A really nice accomplishment with the coconut milk on this one. I'm not the biggest fan of coconut, so the fact that I enjoyed this beer speaks volumes to how well it was crafted. The blend of flavors here is expertly done and this is one of the smoothest stouts I've had in recent memory, especially considering how complex it is. Very good."

"On tap at Town Hall Tap. This beer arrives an opaque black color. The head is a solid inch of brown foam that recedes slowly leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is of coconut, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and graham cracker. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a silky texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer. It is like drinking a Mounds bar, but better. I will make it a point of finding this beer whenever it is available."

"O: This beer was really great. I wouldn’t want to polish off a whole growler of it as the beer is pretty sweet, but this is the best use of coconut I’ve seen in a beer yet. Very flavorful. Highly recommended."
""

"Body was light to medium, surprisingly so for a milk stout which I though would be a bit thicker. Some decent carbonation from the growler pour, decent for a porter without being excessively bubbly. Very easy to drink and tasty if you enjoy a nice toasted coconut."
""
""
"O - I would give a lot to try this one again...I would not have had a problem finishing the entire growler myself...this one is a step above Maui Coconut Porter...there was so much going right in this beer...it was sweet, milky, creamy, chocolately, coconuty, everything a Mounds Bar is...thanks again Josh!"
"Pours a very dark brown with an off-white head that looks the part. Coconut fills the glass and really brings out the light chocolate flavors as well. Smells really enticing. The taste is fantastic, especially when it warms a bit. Strong coconut is well integrated into a light, slightly chocolatey stout. This has much more coconut flavor than Maui CoCoNut Porter. Delicious. The mouthfeel is disappointing - really thin and light. I think this beer would be an epic homerun if it had some of the creaminess that really brings around the style. Moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer is really fantastic that suffers from only one flaw. That said, I could absolutely drink a ton of this beer."
"Pours a dark dark brown. Nice light brown head. Looks great. Smells sweet and malty. Not a lot going on on the nose. Tastes very very coconut heavy. A nice chocolatey sweetness. Smooth but a bit thin. Well carbonated. Overall the coconut is phenomenal. Very enjoyable brew"

"I don't want to bust up anyone's trade bait, but this is a good, well-crafted beer with a very pretty twist. Very good, but not elite. Glad I finally had a chance to try it."

"What's great about this? No holds barred. Doesn't hold back, but neither goes too far. Perfect balance. Not subtle in the cocoanut flavor, delivers it all in just the right amount. Just about perfect. Yu, um."
"O - Awesome beer. The sweet milk stout body works well with the coconut and dark roast to form an awesome beer. This is easily the best coconut beer I have ever had."
"O - Really enjoyable and glad I was able to try this one. Thanks to Mike for sending this one down to me! Looking forward to having this one again in the future. Another winner from TH."
"This is a medium bodied brew with an exceptionally smooth feel. It is lightly carbonated and easy drinking if sweet brews are your thing. There was seemingly no alcohol heat here, just a faint twang of alcohol flavoring. Not really roasted or grainy, this was seriously a beer version of mounds candy bars. If you enjoy that sort of chocolate candy approach to this style, this is an absolute must try. This was one of the more memorable and unique brews I have had in awhile. While it was very enjoyable, I couldn't see myself drinking very much of this before the sweetness got to me. Diabetics beware."
"Overall-Probably my favorite beer of all time now. Town Hall IS the king of coconut porter and I have had Maui Brewing as well."
"O- A delicious beer. The lack of body was somewhat disappointing, but if you like coconut, this is a must try."
" The taste is everything you expect after smelling the coconut after a quick swirl of the glass. There is a nice nutty element and toasty tinges which give a sweet vanilla backing to the coconuts almost floral flavor, very clean and has a moderate level of sweetness to achieve a nice balance. This is more about the coconut than the base stout which is a little lost in all the coconut flavor, but I enjoyed the way it came together and this is definitely a great beer, worth trying if you enjoy coconut."
"O- I’ve been wanting to try this for some time, I was not let down, this beer is so easy drinking its scary, I could drink this all day long, huge coconut and chocolate flavors come out. Perfect dessert beer."
"Point blank. If you don't like coconut I suggest passing on this. If you do like it, I would say this is like a liquid Mounds Bar. Truly wonderful."
"o - a mos def must try, very good beer. You must like coconut, cuz its a coco nut punch to the mouth."
"This is a very good beer that is extremely smooth and silky! The lactose makes a nice heavier body and definitely adds some stickiness to your lips. Very well crafted, but I could only have one pint per sitting - the coconut flavor would become too much for me."
"What a great beer. I finally opened my growler from Oct and it let out a nice little hiss as it opened. Pours jet black and viscous with next to zero head. I had this one on tap when it came out too and I don't remember it having much of a head at that point either. Smells of sweet coconut and a bit of roasted malt. The flavor is an explosion, yet so smooth. I think it was even better out of the growler with a couple of month on it. The coconut took a small step back and allowed the chocolatly malt and roasted flavors to take a stronger part in the flavor. People describe it as drinking a Mounds bar and it's not too far from the truth. This thing simply coats your mouth and envelops all of your senses with a roasted chocolate/coconut/vanilla smootheness. I could drink this on and on - it's sweet but not overly so. A growler might be a bit much in a day but I didn't want to waste any of this delicious treat."
"The chocolate and bourbon characteristics come out really well in the flavor. Ultra smooth and tasty. Good notes of vanilla and a bit of roast as well as some light cherry and toasted coconut. Really enjoying this. Very nice feel between the bourbon and a bit of booze. Perfect carbonation level. A really nice brew that grew on me as it warmed up and as I went through a few small glasses. Well done, TH."
"D: Having only a sip of this would be like only eating one ""M & M."" Who the hell does that?"
"d - Very easy to drink and a nice milk stout. Not as much coconut as I expected but I liked it. Glad I got to try it and would like to try again sometime."
"Personal note: At the time of this review this beer is a milk / sweet stout and not on the top sweet stout list due to lack of reviews."
"D: Terrific stuff, but probably best enjoyed in small quantities."
"D: the drinkability on this beer is wonderful. It goes down so smoothly and every last sip is delicious. This is worth trying. Get it on draft if you can, I had a growler that was a week or two old and the brightness of the flavors dropped considerably."
"Overall I wasn't expecting to enjoy this beer nearly as much as I did. A very good base stout is key here as is the fact that the coconut influence isn't overpowering. A huge flavor profile in a relatively small ABV that is well worth a shot."
"The palate shows a touch more complexity, though it's still dominated by sweet coconut and milk chocolate. The finish brings flavors of licorice and roasted malt that help balance the initial blast of sweetness, but it's decidedly a dessert beer. That said, it never became cloying, even after several pours."
"Worth trying, and quite unique."
"D: This is an amazing beer. It really is a testament to what flavors you can get in a beer. I felt that it was very well balanced with nothing too overpowering. I can't give it a 5 on drinkability only because I could never see drinking more than one or two of these in a sitting. I will buy it again and again if I can find it. I only wish it came in bottles rather than a whole growler."
"Wow. Pretty rich stuff. Can't say I've had anything similar and glad I was able to grab one of these. Would rate this a bit higher if it wasn't so mouth-drying, but a standout for the style. If you like coconut and chocolate, this should be high on your list of beers to try."
"A great tick, awesome for a second to try the coconut but this is way to sweet to be anything than a 4-6oz sipper."
"D - Highly drinkable for something this dark and sweet. A great beer that was very nicely done."
"On-tap at Town Hall Tap. Yup, it sure does taste like a Mounds bar. The coconut character was richer with mild toasted notes over the sweet candy flavors. I don't get much milk stout here. There's a chocolate character in the background and a small but distinct taste of lactose. The body is fairly thick and frankly I had trouble finishing the 20 oz pint. It's a great dessert beer, if you like a good Mounds bar or just like coconut. I would have liked a touch more flavor that wasn't coconut-based. Still, it's easily the best coconut beer I've ever had."
"Overall, this is one of the most drinkable stouts I have ever had. I am having a hard time putting my glass down. It is incredibly drinkable. One of my new favorites from TH."
"5.0 D: This goes down super easy. I wasn't sure about coconut and stout, but it worked out well. I shared this with four other guys. A portion of me wishes I just drank it myself."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a decent milk stout with a nice twist with the coconut. Still, bit more complexity and less sweetness would suit me, as is the case with most of their beers."
"Tap. Ahhh, 3 Hour Tour, so we meet again. I have been craving this beer ever since i had it last year. Pours a nice dark brown with a tan 1 finger head. The aroma is coconut right off the bat and in your face followed by mild dark chocolate and vanilla. The taste is liquid Mounds Bar through and through! The coconut flavor is present the entire time but you also do get some dark chocolate, vanilla, and roast coffee notes. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Some people I talked to have said 1 is enough as it can be a little sweet but for me, this by far is the best coconut beer and I could drink it everyday, all day."
"This is just an amazing beer that I could drink nearly all night. Never had anything like it. If you like coconut, you must try this beer. Can't say enough about how much I enjoy it."
"Very good."
"D - Way too easy. I could mix this in with my ceral. I drank my glass so fast that I almost felt bad, and but again, almost, because I have 32oz to drink. Should seek out if possible."
"D: Awesome one of the tastiest beers I have come across."
"Incredible dessertbeer. Wish they would bottle this. Many thanks to BA Beerloco for bringing this to the tasting."
"Overall, top 5 beers I've had from Town Hall easily. Great stuff."
"D - I must have been about two-and-a-half sheets by the time I reviewed this, because my notes indicate that this is ""some yummy ass shit!"" Not exactly overly verbose or scholarly, but definitely the truth! This is easily competition for Maui Coconut Porter, although I find Three Hour Tour to be even more smooth and milky."
"D-This stuff is Maui Coconut Porter turned up to 11! Man o' man this stuff hits home with me and rocks my world! Thanks so much to Adam for sharing!"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied with average carbonation. Overall, this beer is extremely quaffable- a real treat to have. This beer is one of most expertly crafted beers I have come acrossed."
"Drinkability??? If you want an incredible cocunut stout this is it.."
"Overall this was just simply one of the best beers I have ever had, no question in my mind. I would drink this everyday if I could, it was just perfect."
"Drinkability- This beer is insanely drinkable. As I write this review on my iPhone I've almost finished two and that's definitely a first. I'd bathe in this beer if it was socially acceptable and money wasn't an issue. This beer is what Maui Coconut Porter should be. Freaking amazing!"
"Had this on tap at Town Hall yesterday. Pours a very dark brown color with a small off-white head that was gone quickly leaving little lacing. Aroma is deep, in your face, chocolaty-coconut goodness. Definitely sweet in the nose, plenty of sugary caramel and nuttiness. Taste is perfect for what they were going for. I asked if they had used toasted coconut, but the bartender assured me it was fresh, but there's something about this brings out a nice toasty edge to the coconut. Milk chocolate is the first thing to smack me across the tongue, and it's followed up by a nice coconut finish, roasty, nutty, sweet, but not cloyingly so. I'm even picking up something that tastes a little bit like cinnamon or nutmeg. So damn delicious. I give this a 6 out 5 for tastes. Creamy, soft mouthfeel, viscous and lightly warming. Great beer here. I had two pints of it, and that was enough for me, as the sweetness did become a bit much after awhile, but the first pint went down super easy and quick. Fantastic stuff."
"Black bodied beer with a creamy deep brown head. The head recedes to a collar in about a minute. Spotty lace is left on the glass as I drink. Aroma is incredible. Milk chocolate and very light roasted malt. Toasted coconut is very subtle on the nose. I doubt I'd pick it out if I didn't know it was in the beer. Hazelnut and mocha and coffee accent as well. Fantastic! I pick up the coconut a little more on the palate with my first sip, but it is in no way overbearing. It REALLY blends nicely with the milk stout base. The base flavor is chocolatey and roasty and sweet. The toasted coconut accents beautifully and leaves a nice lingering toasted coconut/ coconut milk flavor long after. This beer is lightly carbonated an about medium in body. Very easy drinking and VERY flavorful. A one of a kind."
"Distinct coconut meat/milk flavor, lightly toasty, backed by some chocolate milk sweetness. Ultra smooth with the consistency of chocolate milk also. More than a pint would be overindulgence, but one is just right. Well put together, and far more than just a novelty. This was exceptional, despite my hatred for grated coconut in foods (a texture-based hate)."
"The best coconut beer I've had to date, but the sweetness makes it a little hard to drink a ton of it. Thanks to d0b for the chance!"
"D - The sweetness gets a little overwhelming, but the thinner texture and great taste make it pretty easy drinking. Still I can feel my pulse quickening from the sugar content, so this is a one pint kind of brew."
"I'm drinking yet another gem from the guys at Town Hall. They can brew some beer up there in Minneapolis. I wouldn't hesitate in buying a few pints of this if I was sitting at the brewery right now on a chilly night. Have to give it up to those guys and their constant ingenuity with each release."
"D= Good. Really tasty beer. Smooth and delicious. Great taste and reminds me more of a cake than any beer I've ever had. Great dessert beer."
