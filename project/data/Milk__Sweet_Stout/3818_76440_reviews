"O - The elements for a great stout are all here.  The main issue here is that the acridity is dialed a bit forward, the sweetness a bit too far back, and the end result is a beer not quite as good as the sum of its parts."
""
""
""
"Had the nitro version, on tap. Alcohol very present in the nose with the toasted malt."
""
""
""
"Honestly should be a lower ABV beer like most other milk stouts, leaves an alcohol taste, not bad, but not what I want from a sweet stout, other than that good beer, not great but not bad"
""
""
""

""

"Super easy to drink and a really tasty beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good coffee taste on the front."
"Had a draft of this at lunch today. Not sweet at all. Very good!"
""
""
""
"Overall. A bit too thin, toasty, hoppy. Out of balance to the hop dry side."
"O- On the sweeter side, but it has all the """dark malt""" flavours that you could want. A bit bitter as well. Not the greatest, but you could do a lot worse."
""
""
"Great. Feel and taste. Consistently excellent not crazy alcohol, so can enjoy a few. Readily available in Pittsburgh area."
"Tasted too high alcohol without enough other flavor for me"
""
"Mm mm this beer tastes like espresso."
""
"Decent finish, reasonable intensity."
"Delicious sweet burnt chocolate taste with a great coffee aftertaste. Great coffee-like smell."
""
"Was a very weak stout way two thin for a double milk......I didn't care much for it"
""
""
""
""
"Strong stout with substantial dark & lightly sweet flavors.  Strong dessert."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is another great milk/sweet stout, and another great beer from Southern Tier.  Great flavors of roasted malt, coffee and caramel, all wrapped up in a creamy quaff.  Delicious!"
""
"Ok.  No better with age."
"Another great beer from STBC"
""
""
"Nice smooth taste with just the slightest hint of milk.  Well above average beer that I would purchase again."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is by no means bad, but the dominant coffee flavor drowns out some of the enjoyable complexities found in many other milk stouts. If you're a big fan of coffee flavoring in your stouts, this may well be the brew for you, but others may want to look elsewhere."
""
""
""
""
"Very good milk stout. Enjoyed it."
""
""
"Aroma-Boozy jusy plain. Lighy head that disappears  in minutes. Heavy and lacking flavor. Creamy and just overall a boozy plain beer. Not a fan"
""
""
"This was far too sweet for me, but pretty typical of the style. Not a big fan of Milk Stouts. This one was had too thin of a mouthfeel and the aroma was almost non existent."
"O - I would drink this again.  The smells and the flavors weren't overpowering and there didn't seem to be anything dominant, only primary (roast coffee).  I didn't care for the mild bitter finish, but it wasn't a deal breaker"
""
"On Tap: Creamiest damn beer I've ever had."
""
"A really good dark roast coffee with a slight espresso flavor. I like this."
""
""
"Good milk stout, but not my favorite. Think if I had it on a nitro line it would really help smooth it out. Would recommend or drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely one of the better milk stouts out there.  The color is great and all the elements come together nicely to make a solid product.  It finishes nicely and has a nice lingering taste."
"Nitro. Sweet, slightly roasty, creamy. Just a little above average."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a good beer. Not my favorite milk stout."

"only got a few swigs, my girl drank most of it! Pretty smooth, nice feel, and fairly stouty"
"Overall: Straight simple and to the point, my review that is. I'd like this stout to be a tad sweeter, but overall, a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours opaque, near-black mahogany. Perhaps the labeling set my expectation, though I'm sure the aroma hints of sweetness. Flavors of dark roast and sweet milk from the teat of a goddess. Smooth and strong, the drinkability portends to danger."
""
"Served on nitro. More bitter than sweet or smooth. Mild chocolate  finish."
""
""
""

"This is not a real """big""" stout and I like the creamy sweetness of this one."

"Some chocolate in the malt and maybe to much coffee.   Not what I would consider creamy but I wouldn't consider it thin either.  Overall a nice little stout that was enjoyable but nothing special that I would seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but not a great one.  I certainly wouldn't turn it down if I were offered one, but  I don't see me paying for another one either."
""
""
""
""
"Dark chocolate brown cow appearance and light mocha head. Not that sweet in presentation, but has some nagging cloying properties. The lactose is definitely there, but the roast coffee flavors predominate, and it finishes with a nice char. Very bready-dark german pumpernickle and barley. Flavors are spot on, a little weak in the nose but the too thin, too sticky mouthfeel hurts."
""
""
"Bitter coffee and chocolate up front. It has a smooth creamy middle with roasted malt notes. Smooth to the finish with slight bitter herb and floral notes."

"had this from a nitro tap at southern tier and it was the best i've had in some time. Creamy, smooth and a perfect balance. i'm certain it isn't as good from a bottle but if you have the chance to get it from a nitro tap....  get it and enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"Wife loves it for its lack of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
"I tried this from a Nitro-pushed tap, which adds to its creamy character. This is not a Hop-head beer, and I wouldn't recommend it to my friends who like those burnt coffee tasting stouts. This is just a well made American version of a not quite traditional Irish stout."
""
""
"Lots of roasty chocolate in the nose, some lactose sweetness as well. Pretty on dimensional but I like it. I tasted a little milky sweetness but it was definitely in the back round. Hugely sweet chocolate and plenty of roasty char dominate this one. Again, not much in the way of complexity, but I thoroughly enjoyed my bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Another mediocre offering from Southern Tier.  The burnt taste is pervasive and has a long hang time.  Fortunately the sweetness makes this tolerable.   Incidentally I like stouts, just not this one – the burnt taste is just too overpowering in the absence of any chocolate or coffee flavors."

"Black pour with a tan one-finger head. Aroma of sweet chocolate and roasted malt. Creamy and sweet flavor with a light roasted malt, vanilla and milk chocolate flavors upfront. Also has a slight bitter coffee/espresso flavor on the backend. Medium bodied."
""
"A bit too bitter IMO, but not bad. Great if you want to get buzzed quicker!"
""
""

"Overall, this is a decent beer that is fairly easy to drink, but not something that I would seek out. I prefer my Milk/Sweet Stouts to be a bit fuller in body, and a have a little more sweetness from the lactose."

"O: I’ve always enjoyed ST’s stout offerings and never had one let me down.  What we have here is a nice, sturdy “double milk stout” that hits all the expected notes while clocking in at a higher ABV than what is apparent.  And all while remaining remarkably smooth and easy to enjoy.  I would put the 2x Stout on par with the likes of Sam Adam’s Cream Stout, LH Milk Stout Nitro.  Nicely done."
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into my large frozen beer mug. Bottle has DOB of 6/27/14 stamped below the label. Pours a deep brown with sparks of light coming through. Delicious sandy head with an okay lace. Taste is of chocolaty malt with a good hop aftertaste to balance. There is a slight creamy mouthfeel. I love stouts but the hops make this one the best of both worlds. I can't see myself getting bored of this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good, but not outstanding. I would be more interested in trying it without the nitro, I was unaware it would be on nitro when ordering. I think the nitro may have steam rolled some of the flavor"
""

"A good taste and good value if you want to both drink a stout and catch a buzz"

"This beer is a staple in my house... my wife is head over heels for it. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my snifter. Pitch black body with a very minimal brownish head that was gone in an instant. Def. what a stout should look like in my opinion. Smelled of cocoa, molasses, a hint of coffee coming thorough from the dark malts (with a bit of agitation). Very coffee-forward taste (which might explain my wife's obsession), and some nice deep dark malts. Just enough bitterness to offset. Rich and creamy mouthfeel, and low level of carbonation that kept it from being to viscous. Very excited that I will be able to grab one of these out of the fridge every once in a while when she isn't looking. Nice stout."
""
"Pours a very dark brown that is a few shades lighter than black, fairly opaque it doesn't allow much light through but does throw some highlights on the edges. The head is about a finger thick, light tan bubbles that fall to a thin layer in some time. The smell is a touch of roasted malt combined with lactose sugary sweetness and dark caramels or light chocolates. The taste is similar to the smell as the lactose sweetness leads the way bolstered by the chocolate notes and finished with a touch of roasted malt bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor is nearly nonexistent, there may be just a touch of bitterness coming from hops with the bulk from the malt. Trends a bit towards the sweet side, especially up front while the body is incredibly creamy and smooth both due to the lactose and a high level of fine bubbled carbonation. Overall a good stout, I'm not the biggest fan of the style so personally I"""m not thrilled by this beer but would say that it is well done and should be liked by fans of milk stouts."

"O: Great drinkability. Delicious American Milk Stout"
""

"Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted 8/24/2013."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - A good stout, but the bitterness can overpower the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: I love coffee forward stouts and this one is that delivers. This beer has coffee and a slight bitter - but there are no other flavors to build it up. Also I get almost nothing on the nose which is strange. I like this one, and will drink it again, but it is not my favorite coffee type stout."
""
""
""
"Pours dark black. Fluffy brown head of foam. Sticks noticeably. Lots around the edges. Nose is milky with a faint coffee underneath. Taste opens burnt bitter but quickly overwhelmed by a milky creamy smooth layer. Little fizz has a pop and a close that pokes the hop through. Better bite than many lactose stouts. Well done."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty great stout in my opinion. Fairly light bodied for a stout, but at 7% ABV this beer is pretty easy to drink. Would be GREAT with ice cream or cheesecake. This is a nice flavorful stout; although it does not have too many sides to it, so it might not stand out too much against more complex stouts."
"Rich and sweet, though not cloying. The roast character was somewhat overbearing for me. Though stronger and more flavorful, I didn't find this as enjoyable as """lighter""" examples like Sam Adams Cream Stout or Left Hand Milk Stout."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A good beer from Southern Tier. I like their creme brulee better but this is still very enjoyable."

"Black in color with dark brown hues on the edges. Poured with a thick beige foam that quickly reduced to thin wisps. Rich, roasted malt aroma with sweet dark chocolate and dark fruit notes. Creamy smooth up front followed by tight, rich carbonation in the middle returning to creamy smoothness to the end. Sweet cream flavor up front with roasted malt beneath that intensifies through the middle. A touch of hop bitterness and dark fruit flavors toward the end as this finished semi-dryly with a lightly charred, roasted coffee, and roasted malt aftertaste. Very accessible, affordable, and enjoyable. Southern Tier is one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is the first beer I have had from Southern Tier Brewing, and they haven't disappointed. A fine stout, well worth it when I can afford (not cheap in Aus)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Reminds me of a Sam Adams cream stout, which is a compliment. Not as creamy, but a solid stout. Do not be scared off by the 'sweet' title."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black, just about opaque. The hops and grains unexpectedly dominate the smell, though the typical chocolate stout scent is found just beneath. The semi-sweet chocolate becomes the most obvious to taste, with a grainy, bitter hops lingering in the finish. It has a very light mouth feel, with an appropriate amount of carbonation. A decent stout, however there is nothing that makes it stand out in stand out in a crowd."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent milk stout, great dark color with noticeable head even without an aggressive pour, head is dark and lingers well with a strong lace as the glass empties. This is a milk stout and if that's what you're after it will not disappoint. ABV is 7% so I found it very drinkable. Nice creamy vanilla overtones but the maltiness (roastiness) is a slow to arrive. Wonderful mouth feel - well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Somewhat of a disappointment. A fairly mediocre effort. Lacking in body and the flavor profile comes across as watered down and uninteresting."
"A very good milk stout. Will look for it when I am craving a milk stout."
"Very good double stout, not quite great, but it would make an excellent go-to stout for a daily drinker (pick this instead of Guinness). Very, very flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer in general is lacking in flavor, but with assertive bitterness. It could use more robust malt character or sweetness."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very tasty. Nicely balanced between sweet and bitter. Went well with butterscotch cookies. I could easily have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very earthy and spiced Stout. A Milk Stout with character without being too sweet. I liked it."

"There are few breweries that offer such an extensive array of stouts as Southern Tier. I honestly wouldn't have thought they could come up with another for the portfolio but, lo and behold, they have; this can definitely hold its own alongside the classics like Choklat, Jah-va and Oat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is dark brown in color with over a finger of head that enjoyed really lengthy retention. The nose has light roasty notes. The flavor profile combines roasted malt with sweet lactose. The body is pretty standard for style and the finish is semi-dry."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours pitch black with a half inch light brown head. Smells slightly sweet. Tastes very slightly sweet with nice mouthfeel. Tasted like your typical stout. Nice and fairly thick and creamy. Was expecting a more softer taste and feel what with the lactose sugar advertising. Overall a nice beer."

"O: A great milk stout. I loved it and will be buying again."
""
""
""
"o: Not as sweet as anticipated since it is called a """Double Milk Stout," but a good solid balanced stout."

""
""
"This beer really grew on me. The taste made up for the bad start. Yummy."
""
""
""
""
"Not as good as I thought it would be. Just an okay beer."
""
"Overall: a little bit on the sweet side, even for the style, but still a tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - An easy drinking stout. Sweetness gives way to bitter in the end. Char flavor dominates and hop bitterness makes an unexpected and oddly placed appearance. No sign of the 7.5% ABV. Overall a good milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours and inky black with some head and decent retention. Nose is mostly chocolate and sweet dark roast. Taste follows with chocolate and sweet dark roast. Mouthfeel is great, really smooth. Overall a fine beer. I haven't had much experience with milk stouts, but I thought it was very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 650 ml bottle. Pours a dark chocolate colour. Huge notes of chocolate on the nose. Tastes of dark fruits, smoke and bitter chocolate. Ample sweetness, but dry on the finish thanks to a strong dose of hops. Full-bodied for sipping and savouring."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was my first milk stout and I am impressed. It pours black with a small head and smells of malts and a hint of coffee and chocolate. The taste starts out good but gets even better as you drink it. Overall I am happy with this choice as my first milk stout and yet another great beer from southern tier."
""
""
""
""
"The Southern Tier 2X Stout is good...the beer poured an opaque black with a thin ecru head that is not lacing much. The scent carries some chocolate and a bit of earth. The taste is a nice easy drinking stout with smooth chocolate base with touches of coffee and earth helping out. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a decent stout and should be enjoyed by all."
"2X Stout pours a black color with a small head. There is a sweet and lactose enriched aroma. The taste has strong lactose flavor, with a bitter and sweet aftertaste. There are strong but still watery taste. Overall its a nice bold flavored sweet stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, a touch of coffee. Taste is lots of roasted malts, smoke, some bitterness, a small hint of chocolate. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Overall- Above average but a little bit of a letdown for me. This is a style I really enjoy and this just didn't represent the style. I would try this if you try it with the knowledge that it won't be milk stout you crave. It's an okay stout but it's not a milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"--i really couldn't identify any chocolate at all in this beer. since i don't think chocolate is required flavor in milk stout, i have to believe the brewer left it out on purpose. this is a serious stout, with a decent ApV. I would get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too carbonated for the style. Stain is mild."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Something I could drink but not buy again over and over"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" O- overall this turned out to be an enjoyable beer. Made for a good better than average beer that I will be happy to order again."
""
""
"'Whoa, what a beer! Take me to the river. Served at a perfect temperature with a colossal, very light tan, thick, foamy head that just sits there and loads of lace. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is mainly malt, roast, and caramel, hint of toffee. Flavors like nose, mild also, roast, easy bittersweet. Finish is like flavor, incredibly easy drinking. Choice beer."

"I let this beer warm up before finishing as others had suggested and they are right. New smokey flavors develop to add some nice complexity."
"A good beer, but there are a lot of stouts out there that I prefer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aromas of sweet cream, chocolate, and lightly roasted coffee beans. The beer is not as smooth as I'd anticipated given its nitro-backing. Still a nice bite to it. Easy to drink though. I had no problem putting the gulp to this one. Creamy chocolate, roasted character, light vanilla on the back end. Easy finish. A nice beer."
""
""
"All in all, a decent beer. I wish I didn't have a six pack, but because it is so subtle we'll have no problem drinking it. Probably wouldn't purchase again unless it's the only decent stout available at the time."
"Finger plus of uneven, frothy foam, lots of larger bubbles to mottle the surface but good head retention and covers the surface for some time, the lacing is thin on the whole but sticks well. Very dark brown colored liquid, not quite black, opaque nonetheless, no filminess, you don’t seem the bubbles until they break the yellow tinted surface. Forceful but not heavy nose driven by chocolate powder, mocha and just a strong general maltiness, blends in anise, vanilla and a little whiskey like booziness, vague plum fruit, the breadiness is akin to scones or raw oatmeal, not devoid of hops but no single descriptor jumps out at you about this part. Medium-bodied, neither too dry nor too sweet, just full of malty goodness, chocolate, caramel, cocoa, vanilla, licorice, brown sugar, needs to warm up to get any coffee grounds. It isn’t that milky though. The carbonation is tight so it isn’t too fluffy and it is about as crisp as you’d want without it getting too dry. Here the hops lend a mild bitter touch at the end with citrus and a hint of pine more than grassiness, maybe even peppery. The thing is, it’s subtle in all the good ways, making it an enjoyably sessionable beer rather than lunging for the “wow” factor."
""
"Overall: I would have liked a bit more lactose sweetness to this beer, but I am still very satisfied with this delicious beer."
""
""
""
"Had on tap at the Limp Lizard in Liverpool, NY. The beer had a great head and awesome mouthfeel. I would definitley get this beer again. I will say as the beer warmed up the flavor was much better. So i would recommend drinking this at room temperature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a beer you should finish with, by any stretch, but if you want to begin your evening, or perhaps even have only a single beer, this is a warm, encompassing beer you will not regret."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D-I wasn't particularly impressed, so it was one and done for me, but its lack of complexity and decent flavor could allow someone to drink a few of these in a setting."
""
""
""
""
"O - It has the typical stout aftertaste, with a lot of hop flavor in the end. This review is on the bottled beer, but I had it on tap and I thought it was amazing. On tap, I would give it a perfect score because it was so creamy, which complimented the flavors of the beer. I would drink this on tap again for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely happy to have this via nitro-tap! My husband was so intrigued by the visual the nitrogen provided, that he took a video of the beer's """lava lamp""" antics. The mouthfeel in particular benefitted from the smooth, airy nitrogen qualities. Otherwise, the beer was standard for a solid, well-made milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this would pair nicely with dessert, especially something like vanilla ice cream with some cracked black pepper. Might make a good beer float even. For savory courses, maybe some Texas beef ribs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Summary - Ok, they mislabeled this, right? It's a stout, not a milk stout. No sweetness, no milk or cream, it's not smooth and malty like a chocolate malt. Wow, my first taste of Southern Tier, and I'm super disappointed."
""
""
""
"D - ;( NOT to be purchased. I'll force this one down rather than waste - but under protest!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it is just an unremarkable milk stout. I love Southern Tier, but this one can be left on the shelf."
""
"O: Not as milky as I hoped it would be. The smokiness was a turnoff. Not bad. Just not great."

"The Rest: Quite good, no hint of any booze in here. I'd love to have a bottle of this the next time someone says, Oh, Guinness is like a meal in a can. This would make their head spin."
"O- a very good, just short of great, stout. Not complex but what is there is good and well made."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is pretty much as would be expected by the smell except with a hint of dark fruit. Very smooth and not a 'hoppy' finish as might be expected. Well balanced flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are many other choices in the style that I would choose first."
""
""
"Better overall than all but 3 stouts I recall, and Guinness isn't one of 'em."
""
""
""
"Overall: A strong example off Double Milk Stout, but I like the ones which attempt to rein in the sweetness a little more. Still, a tasty, luxurious brew."
""
""
"O: Overall this was what I was hoping for, the smell of it was astounding, love that early morning coffee smell. All around this was great and I recommend."
""
""
""
""
"O- Not very impressed with this one, expected more from what the aroma gave me. Didn't care for the over powering burnt coffee taste. All other aspects of this were good though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly rich, slightly drying finish, a bit more than medium bodied. Faint effervescence. Nice and smooth, well rounded aftertaste that just slowly fades away. Easily a sippable beer, it just lends itself to that role without being a huge ABV brew."

"Flat black color with nice, dark-tan foamy head. Ok retention and pretty good lacing on the glass. There’s not much in the aroma, save for a little maltiness and some sweet lactose. The beer is quite sweet with bitter malts and bittersweet chocolate as well. It has a very nice roasty flavor that pairs well with the sweetness from the lactose. The best part is it’s mouthfeel - nice and thick on the palate, deliciously creamy and smooth. At the end the hops become more evident and they complement the sweetness with a nice bitterness. There’s not a lot of depth or “oomph” in the flavors, but it’s a very drinkable milk stout."

"Nice stout here, good deal and not that ridiculous sweetness of the backwater crap(I mean series) Give it a go if you see it. Live, 2xIpa, IPA, Pumking and now this, I am really starting to like this brewery. Besides the overly sweet backwater series I have liked everything I have tried from this brewery!"

"D: A decent brew, but not excellent. Seems like the latest thing for milk stouts is to pump up the ABV...and this one handles it well."
""
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours pitch black with a fine one finger light brown head with awesome retention and lacing. Aroma dominated by chocolate with mellow roasted malt; sweet. Flavor is chocolate, nuts, mild roasted malt. This is sweet and viscous, very reminiscent of a stout with whipped cream added; there is a detectable whipped cream element to the flavor. Nice medium to heavy, creamy body with a mouth feel that wouldn't be out of place from a nitro pour, although this is fron a bottle. A very nice mildly sweet stout. In my opinion, Southern Tier is the master of sweet stouts and this is another winner in their line up. A must for those who like the sweet stout style."

"O- This beer has a mellow but nice roasted black malt flavor but the lactose sugar taste is a bit too strong for the rest of the flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A very nice double take on the style. Its a little bit to astringent from the roasted malt which cuts into to the sweetness. But a very nice beer that I've returned to a few times."
""
""
"The Stout hides its strength and power well. The senses are easily seduced by the nitro infusion. Yet it mutes aromas and offers some give-and-take in the mouthfeel department."

"Taste is lots of dark Godiva chocolate with a hint of roast and more hops than meets the eye. I would lean more American Stout than Milk Stout if I guessed blind, but it definitely has some sweetness going on...nothing like the Blackwater series though. This is a very good beer, I like it quite a bit. Southern Tier certainly knows how to do a stout. I'll be buying more of this in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Perfect as a dessert beer, this one is sweet, somewhat roasty, and very smooth and creamy. This was better on nitro tap than it was without."
""
"B-"
""
""
""
"Pours a solid dark brown/black color with a smallish tan head that dissipates to a ring on top. Smells of light roast, chocolate, and caramel with hints of vanilla and light fruit. The flavor is roasty and smokey with lots of chocolate and caramel as well as vanilla and dark fruits. Wow I wasn't expecting such a complex flavor based on the aroma. Medium body with a moderate level of antiabortion and a sweet almost sugary mouthfeel. Nice stout, I'm glad I picked one up the other day."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty good beer that lacks that certain something; not up to some of the gems in Southern Tier's portfolio, but still pretty good."
""
""
""
""
"O: There's nothing horribly wrong with this brew but something is lacking to pull it all together. packs quite a punch and tastes okay."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good milk stout. Goes down easy. Good dessert beer, but be wary of the abv."
""
"This is a decent stout. I've had many stouts that have a lot more roasted, toasted, coffee, nutty and other flavors. This is more one dimensional with a single flavor of sweet molasses. This is a good stout, but I've had many that are a lot better."
""
"That's also because the alcohol wasn't that present here. By itself, this was a good beer but with the bar being set so high for Stouts in general, this just fell short a bit. As a mellow alternative to the more aggressive examples of this style, this would be as good a choice as any and was if it was a little more sticky, this would have reminded me of a fancy cola like the ones that are coming back into style now. This was as unassuming as a Stout could get without feeling watered-down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"From a bottle, poured into a snifter. Beer's black as night as it should be. Smell is of coffee and milk, very mild. Taste is an outstanding mix of chocolate, toasted coffee, mild hops mixed with sweetness. Good mouthfeel with mild carbonation. Excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
"I've had Left Hand Milk Stout, which is supposed to be one of the best Milk Stouts out there, but I have to give it to Southern Tier. While Left Hand's Nitro Milk Stout wins in appearance (what a shock...) and aroma, 2x Stout is better in what matters most -- the taste. This is a beer worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"A new one for me but love the style and pours a very dark kola hue with a creamy two finger khaki head that stays and leaved heaps of nice lacing here and there,the smell is milky coffee,brown sugar,milk chocolate and herbal hops,the mouthfeel is full bodied and has tastes of milky mocha,brown sugar,creme brûlée and finished with a herbal bitterness and overall it's not bad and quite enjoyable for a night like tonight cheers."
""
""
"Overall a tasty full bodied stout."
"Southern Tier is known to produce great beers overall so wanted to try this one. This is a deep brown, heavy bodied beer with a sizable tan head. Not as dark and thick as your typical motor oil stouts. This is a very complex beer in terms of flavor. Great sweet, chocolaty smell. Nice sweet, malty, dark chocolate and earthy coffee taste. A good blend of sweet from the fermented lactose and bitterness from the dark chocolate and roasted coffee. A dark roasted malt taste with a good amount of hops to it. I would say better if warmed to room temperature and served as a sipping stout. A very pleasant beer to drink. Real smooth hops with medium carbonation. If you like coffee and/or coffee-tasting type stouts, you should definitely give this one a try. It's definitely not one to disappoint in the taste department."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- nice milk stout with good amount of hoppiness, which I like."
""
"Overall: This is a phenomenal milk stout through and through. I've had this bottled and on tap, and find myself utterly pleased. It's hard to find on tap. I only know one place: McLadden's in West Hartford, CT. This brew is a real treat. And, with 7.5% ABV at the same price as many inferiors, it's well worth the investment. Southern Tier has never disappointed me. They really know how to make dark, rich beers teeming with complexity."

"Overall liking this one very enjoyable tasty sweet and smooth."

"Pretty damn solid milk stout. Growing on me each time I have one."

"O- this one was pretty pretty good, but hard to live up to their blackwater series beers. Worth a try, but probably won't buy again."
"Pouted into a goblet. Color was a very dark brown, that was almost black. Opaque, with a thin brown bubbly head. Aroma was slightly sweet up front, mixed to a bit of smokey, then finished with a hint of alcohol. Flavor had the lactose sweet up front as I would expect it to be, but then shifted to a bit of bitter alcohol acidity. Coated very well, not overly thick, needed perhaps a tad more carbonation. Not bad. Up front, great flavor profile, but didn't finish very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours with a one-finger head that dissipated fairly quickly. The color is a virtually opaque brown. The aroma was not outstanding: some toasty notes but not as marked as expected. The taste did not disappoint in delivering a rich, toasty chocolate deepness. This beer has a strong malty sweet character with an underplayed hoppiness that accentuates toward the end. The characteristics of the sweetness and hopiness are characteristic of this style. But the sweetness may be overplayed. The carbonation was at a medium level, and the body was full -- almost syrupy. Overall, I would have this beer again, even though I prefer a somewhat less sweet version of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of my favorite milk stouts out there. A pleasurable beverage to sip on for a night. Would recommend giving it a shot."
""
""
""
"2X Stout pours out black with a finger of mocha head. The aroma is sweet and roasty, with lactose cutting a current straight through the roast. The taste brings in a strong amount of coffee flavor that works very well with the milk stout aspects. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with just a little bit of carbonation prickle on the finish; and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, Southern Tier 2X Stout is a great milk stout. The stronger coffee flavors helps it stand out from the pack."
""
""
"A very good stout, hits all the right notes, doesn't do anything exceptionally different, but does what it does very well. Would definitely have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
"O: Overall a good beer, but seems to miss the marks of a sweet/milk stout. Seems closer to an American stout or perhaps an RIS to me."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz """pint""" glass. Pours a dark black with a small amount of brown head that dissipates very quickly. Smells of coffee, chocolate, and caramel, very nice mixture and very inviting. Tastes of cream and coffee with a very sharp coffee aftertaste. Beer is carbonated right and goes down smooth for its medium body. Overall, a very good beer."
"While I am definitely not a stout expert, overall i found this to be very good. Looking forward to the rest of the six and would come back to this one."
"O- Definitely one that I will look for and pick up again."
""
""
"O: I had very high hopes for this one. I don't think it's a bad beer, but I was not a fan of the alcohol intensity and the roughness of the Mouthfeel. However, I will say that as I drink it, it is starting to grow on me."
""
"O - This is a nice stout. Not my favorite, but a solid choice for sure. I would buy this beer again. To be fair, I am a little biased since Southern Tier brews two of my favorite stouts."
""
"I really liked the cleanliness of this beer's flavor. My one complaint is the hop bitterness was a bit assertive at the very end, and finally the taste lands on an acrid roasted grain note. But overall the drinking experience was smooth and satisfying. Tantalizingly close to being a straight up clone of a Wendy's Frosty, only the hop bitterness pulled it back from greatness. Would love to have this same beer with a lingering malty chocolate finish, just let up on the hops a tiny bit."
""
""
"This has two hop and three malt varietals. There is a clear hop influence noticed as an accent and a pretty decent sweet tone, as a milk stout. The hops do seem to grab a little more attention than I would expect for the style, but it works. A different interpretation of the style, but a nice one."
"Really enjoyed this beer, not too sweet with the lactose working great throughout without being too overpowering. One of the best milk stouts i've had."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a fairly good stout...for those who don't like it too strong or too weak this is a beer for all. Finds a perfect middle ground among stouts. I will definitely be having this beer again and will recommend it strongly to friends."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of Southern Tier's best stouts, which is saying something, because they make some great stouts."
""
""
"15 Minutes into the brew offers a small lingering cosmic star designed head, slight lace, very light chocolate malt aroma, and rich flavors of dark roasted malts with bitter chocolate notes. Overall very full bodied and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good milk stout. Nothing about it screams """2X""" in any way, but I guess I felt the same way about Southern Tier 2XIPA. It's sweet, which should be expected, and the 12oz format works for this reason. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Try it if you like, but you've been warned."
"Despite not having as much head as I would like, this is a pretty solid milk stout."
""
""
""
""
"A super solid milk stout I bought as part of a mix-a-six. Definitely not regretting it. As far as milk stouts go, this fella is full of flavor and drinks easy. I could see having a few of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: In a word full of great stouts 2X falls somewhere in the middle."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice, chocolatey, with sour notes, """sipper"""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not as good as I was hoping, but an easy-drinking, well-constructed stout nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This tastes more chocolatey than most milk stouts I've had. Almost tastes like chocolate milk beer."
"Pours a khaki, three-finger head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Black color, no highlights. Strong carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Chocolate/coffee nose. Flavor is sweet chocolate and coffee, hops balance. Decent double stout. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Tully’s Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
"Overall: This is a very drinkable beer…the lactose compliments the variety of hops and malts making a delicious blend…there is no head which would have been nice, but I definitely could drink a couple of these while watching the daily show…(3.75/5)"
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug. Beautiful jet black with hints of deep red/brown in light; fizzy dark brown head that dissipated quickly. Smells malty, with chocolate and roasted notes. Taste is surprisingly good; it goes all over your tongue with chocolate and roasted goodness. The sweet chocolate tempers the bitterness of the roasted malts. I was already expecting to like it, and I was still surprised by how good it tasted. Mouthfeel is relatively light, but the taste makes it seem fuller. Overall, this is a delicious stout, easy to drink. One of my new favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"May not be the best stout I have ever had but probably the most easily drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Saw this bad boy at TW. I love stout so hey 2X stout must be twice as good, so let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get nice roasted malts and a definite heavier ABV than your average stout. Some licorice and somehow a hint of cinnamon. Pours into my trusty SA perfect pint like a chocolate milkshake, thick and heavy classic motor oil. Nice tan head with multi-sized bubble groupings. Taste is large and in charge with a very sweet roasted malt with some toffee up front and a slight bitter middle, still under the sweetness then a sweet and chaulky bitter fade at the end into a pleasant charred dry bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy a good assest with the flavor. Sweeter than I expected but it is a milk stout so it is actually spot on. A very tasty brew. I recommend."
""
""
"Pours an opaque very dark brown with a short-lived light mocha colored head. Smoke, cherry, and coffee on the nose. Mouthfeel is remarkble for the style. It's like carbonation fizz encapsulated by a slick, thin-membraned bubble. Some coffee up front. Cherry appears at the finish. Very drinkable. I'm drinking Edmund Fitzgerald along with this beer and have found 2X Stout to be the better beer, in my opinion. Ed Fitz is too heavily carbonated."
"decent milk stout. the pour is a shiny black obsidian color, glassy and smooth looking, with an inch of dying tan head. the nose is definitely sweet from the milk sugars, but not tooth rotting sweet i dont think. syrupy dark malts and a generic yeast round out the aroma. flavor has a lot of cocoa notes, which are great with the residual sugar in this beer, but i find it just a little too sweet, even for the style. its not like the creme brulee, but i can see similar properties and they scare me. alcohol is very well hidden though. thick feel, velvety in texture all smooth and everything, but a little sticky and tar like with its lacking carbonation. wouldnt want to do more than maybe two bottles of this. not my favorite southern tier beer, which have always been really hit or miss for me. worth a try though as there just arent that many milk stouts out there anymore it seems..."
"If this were a bit thicker in the mouthfeel and less hoppy, it would be stunning."
""
""
""
"*from notes: 12-5-12"
""
""
"overall: Definitely better then when I tried it earlier, idk what cause the difference, but anyways its worth a try at the right price (I got it for $2.19 a bottle). However I wont be buying it again, and its probably not worth getting a sixer of."
""
""
"Milk chocolate and heavily roasted malts. Burnt coffee beans mix with the milky chocolate in the middle of the palate. I think the alcohol thins out this oily palated beer. Their's some warmth, but it seems to go along with teh flavor pretty well. Not a bad sipper."
""
""
""
"It's fine to drink - warming in the winter months. Just not as enjoyable as others I've enjoyably enjoyed in the past."
""
""
"Overall this was a miss for me. It just comes across as an American Stout and lacks the Milk/Sweet stouts elements that I look for in that style. Is it good, yes. Does it stand out from any other generic American Stout, no. A milk stout is a nuanced style which needs more sweetness and creaminess; the concept of a 2x Milk Sout is self-deprecating."
""
"Pours a dark brown capped with a beige one and a half finger head. Average retention and noticeable splotchy lacing here and there. Pleasant roasted notes greet the nose, sweet bittersweet cocoa power as well. Opens with roasted malt some dark chocolate that transisitons to milk chocolate as the sweet lactose sugar joins in creating a semi-sweet chocolate milk notes. Finishes with mild roasted malts and some lingering cocoa. Medium bodied, smooth, some creaminess-moderate carbonation. One of the better readily available milk stouts available, very well-balanced, never overly sweet. Recommended."

"Taste is a very bland chocolate milk, heavy on the milk. It seems like mild muddle of milk and chocolate. It brings back (very bad) memories of afternoon milk snack in elementary school in the late 50's. (Qualifier: I don't like or drink milk unless it has cereal in it.) This beer isn't bad, but it comes close enough for me. I'll pass."
"Well done, Southern Tier."
""
""
"O: I like this beer. Its very easy to drink down and loaded with chocolately beery goodness. Absolutely nothing to complain about here."
""
""
""
""
"O- An enjoyable beer. Though it is a little too much on the coffee-side for my preferences I think anyone that enjoys a nice sweet stout or dark brew in general will be pleased. A very smooth feel and goes down extremely easy - which says something to me for a beer that has a higher alcohol content than most. It may not be a favorite but I could see myself picking up another 6-pack in the future. Southern Tier, good job!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good milk stout, very solid offering."
""
""
"This was a very nice Milk Stout. I would have expected nothing less fro ST."
"O - When I drink a milk stout, I expect creaminess, sweet, and a lot of chocolate. This one didn't deliver quite as much on the creamy side as I would've liked. Left hand milk stout, to me, is the comparative piece for a solid milk stout, and I think this beer falls short of LHMS. Still a well-done stout though, and I highly recommend it."
""
""
"Once again Southern Tier has brewed a beer that I like. This may not be world class but it's damn tasty and I'm glad I have a whole sixer of it. I will definitely buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Just ok. Wishing for more."
""
"OVERALL: If you want to find a dangerous beer, this is it. It is super easy to drink, but at the same time very tasty and full of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'd be interested to try this on tap. I'm glad it's in six packs, but there are better chocolate/milk stouts out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've been wanting to try this one ever since it came out and have no excuses for waiting this. An straightforward and enjoyable stout that goes down quite easy."
"O: A pretty well-done double-milk stout from Southern Tier, ringing in at a dangerously drinkable 7.5% ABV. It's good and certainly worth a try, although you couldn't session it for several reasons. It's pleasant enough to have one or two over a meal or with dessert and I'd definitely have it up again."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is a very creamy beer like a milk stout should be a bit of the heavy bodied side but rather easy drinking and flavorful brew."
""
"Comes out of the bottle dark-chocolate brown with a fairly thick and rather persistent frothy, fine-bubbled wheaten head that leaves fairly thick lacing. Aroma has a core of roast, slightly burnt malt with notes of molasses, licorice and coffee. Lip-smacking flavor has notes of roast malt, mocha and molasses, with nutty and earthy hints. Smooth, firm texture has a decent amount of fizz and leaves a nice smoky, slightly sweet finish."
"I give it a near perfect 4.5 every time"
""
""
""
"O: it’s a nice brew, very basic, decent drinkability but dont think it resembles this style very well. the milk is very subtle as well as the sweetness."
""
"Overall a pretty nice beer. It's not mind blowing and that alcohol is the star player which isn't what I was looking for. Maybe worth checking out but not crazy about it."
""
""
"Needs more roasty-ness and a heavier dose of dark chocolate for my liking."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a delicious, nicely balanced stout. Drink it for dessert, or to accompany dessert."
""
""
"This beer is full of delicious and distinctive flavors considering there are no actual flavorings added, but I'm left wishing it had a more substantial mouthfeel."
""
""
"Overall not what I was hoping for. While not bad, it is a bit lacking for style or for the expected ST strong-flavored brews. Alcohol is a bit evident in the taste and is noticeable by the end of a couple. Will finish the sixer but not sure I will be hunting this down again any time soon."
""
"Overall, it was cocoa, sweetness, and little body. No alcohol taste at all. Carbonation minimal and a little minor bitterness at the end. Not complex at all. Not one of my favorite Southern Tiers. Considering I enjoy milk stouts, I was just not impressed."
""
""
""
"Pours black, no head. Light carbonation. Smells of roasted malts. Taste is coffee with light bitterness. Good stout. This poured a dark brown, almost black body with a modest brown head that soon reduced to a film. The aroma was chocolatey with a quiet roastiness light floral scents. The roasted malts increased in the flavor and the chocolate became bittersweet. There was a roasty, hoppy bitterness that blended with a hit of alcohol. Dry finish. Not bad."
"O - Initially, I loved the smell and taste of this beer and thought it was damn good. After a second beer I am noticing some flaws. The taste fades to more or a robust porter. The coffee and dark chocolate seem to lose their grip. It is very good, Maybe I am being too nitpicky."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very tasty stout. The body could use smoothing, but it brings good flavors to the table."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Found this on tap at My Place in Newtown, CT. It's a solid black stout with a modest tan head that breaks quickly into a ring and fair horizontal lacing. The aroma is a pleasant malt coffee bean bite with some nutty nuances. Not very strong but very solid. The flavor is a no nonsense green malt and bitter coffee with a sweet pear/vegetable hint. Really nice, in a medium-plus bodied brew with very little evidence of carbonation and a silky feel. A classic milk stout that goes down easily! Yet another triumph from Southern Tier."
""
"O: Was very excited to try this beer and now that I have, I am very satisfied. This is a big beer at 7.5%, but you can hardly notice the alcohol with all of the rich, roasted malts, and creamy chocolate. Very good stout by Southern Tier!"
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A solid beer, but I wouldn't consider this anything special, especially after trying Southern Tier's imperial stout lineup. Good beer with some nice flavor, but I'd reach for their bigger stouts ten times out of ten."
"Quite unexpected how much I'd enjoy this. Maybe it's just been awhile since I've had a bigger stout. Seems to go well with an early fall cool damp September night (yes it's getting dark early now). Nonetheless, I'd recommend this. Lactose seems a little light except in the aroma. Smooth and flavorful drink."
""
""
""
""
"I'm a real fan of milk stouts, and this was my intro some time back. It has an excellent aroma with a bit of coffee and chocolate. The head is OK. It has some foam but doesn't seem to have much of a cling throughout. The taste, though, is excellent. As I said, it was the first of this type. So, it's been my measuring stick against all other milk stouts...and quite a high bar it sits."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty much a good any-time stout that has a solid lactose sweetness as well as some coffee and chocolate notes. Easy enough to drink (it is technically almost an imperial) and satisfying. Definitely worthy of a try if you're into the style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"The beer pours a dark black-velvet with a thin white-tan head that fades quickly leaving only a ring of thin fanged lacing on the sides. The beer is very dark and opaque but a couple of bubbles can be seen clinging to the sides of the glass and there are plenty of bubbles peppering the surface to showcase a solid amount of carbonation. The beer smells sweet and roasty with the sour lactose sugars enveloping everything in their odd candied embrace. Malts are rich and creamy with chocolate and roasted flavoring. The beer tastes rich with burnt coffee and slight chocolate tinge. There is a faint sour from the lactose sugars that plays nicely with the coffee flavor and an alcoholic pucker that resonates in the aftertaste as the coffee and roasted flavors die down. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little thin for the style. It leaves the mouth with a ghost of saliva and a very slight roasted dryness to the tongue. Overall this is a solid milk stout with nice coffee taste that does not show up in the nose. This beer is worthy of a taste."
""
""
""
""
"This beer has just what you want in a sweet stout. Highly recommended for fans of the style or for those who want to explore the dark world of stouts but don't yet feel up to a big imperial stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"yet another ST that tastes of extracts or concentrates - sort of a spoiling-milk lacto thing pervades (oxidation sours?) - interesting and arguably noteworthy"
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the robustness of flavoring, and the nice balance it struck throughout. The flavorings are creamy, smooth, and sweet on one side, while the other side shows a hearty roast and char. Neither side really butts the other out too much, and we are left with another tasty brew from a great brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - supremely drinkable and enjoyable. for my money, this is an excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
"O: The first """double""" milk stout I've come across, this is similar to many other offerings but more potent in both flavor and alcohol. Thick and dark enough that I think it will be a good winter beer, but easy drinking enough that I could have a few no problem."
""
""

"O - it's a bit on the sweet side meaning its a little too sweet for my liking. However it is a solid brew from an excellent brewery. It's very easy to drink if you can overcome the heavy dose of sweets. It's a pretty well made stout all around though. Something that I'll probably go after again when the weather cools off. It's not a good as other southern tier offerings, but still worth a try."
"Tastes very similar to the aroma.  Thinner than expected with lots of overly roasted burnt malt flavor.  Overpowering dark chocolate along with burnt coffee and smoke with hardly any sweetness for balance.  Very faint lactic cream presence with a touch of  lighter, sweeter chcolate but again the overly roasted dark chocolate notes overpower everything.  Lingering dry acrid finish.  Pretty disappointing coming from a brewery that usually nails dessert beers."

"Almost black in color with a finger of off-white head. The nose is heavy on the roasted malt and chocolate with a nice touch of lactose, too. Maybe even a touch of vanilla? A fairly sweet nose, but quite nice. The flavor is not as nice. A little too much roast which comes across as harsh on the palate. Good coffee flavors and a moderate lactose sweetness, though."
"This is a very good stout, would great for dessert. It's milky, creamy and coffee like."

"A nice looking beer- pure black with a creamy white head. Smells lightly roasty and creamy, with nice notes of vanilla and cocoa. A little light on taste, and with a slightly burnt bitter finish. The heart of the flavor, though, is a milky cocoa and vanilla taste layered on some light roastiness. Quite pleasant, but not seamless. Could be a tad silkier in the mouth for the style. The slightly burnt tannic notes on the finish are a bit jarring. Overall quite solid if a bit flawed in parts."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma features a lot of chocolate and a good bit of roasted malt. The flavor is very similar. The chocolate and nut notes really come through, as does some roasted malt. I also get some oats and lactose and cream notes in the flavor. Thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 3/5/2012. Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense tn head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big milk chocolate, caramel, coffee, roasted malt, cream, toast, biscuit, and slight herbal hops. Very nice aromas with great strength and balance. Taste of milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, cream, toast, light pine, and citrus. Some decent pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, cream, and toast on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of roasted flavors with the lactose; and a good bitterness/sweetness balance gives this zero cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming after the finish. Overall this is a very nice milk stout. Nice robust and balanced flavors; and quite smooth to drink. Maybe a bit too much hop character for a milk stout, but a damn good offering nonetheless."

"Overall - Pretty good stuff.. the taste is nice and fairly well balanced. The booze also seems well hidden. Nothing really ground breaking, but still glad to have tried."
""
"Not the best Milk Stout I have tried, but a good representation of the style and a tasty beer."
"Aromas of boozey sweet chocolate and roasted coffee malts. Taste is sweet roasted coffee malts. Some slight dried fruit and chocolate and vanilla flavors. Its a bit overly sweet, but otherwise a good above average stout. As true with most if not all stouts, let this one warm up. The flavors really come out as it warms..."
""
""
"Overall: A very solid offering and far better on nitro-tap. Definitely worth seeking out and a solid all-around beer from Southern Tier."
""
"Pours a nice dark color with very little head. Almost no lacing Taste and aroma of coffee and roasted malts. An excellent bodied brew. You don't notice the higher alcohol content. Going down very easy with not much of a hint of bitterness. I wish there was a little more bite to this beer but it is above average none the less"

"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and I thought that it was a good example that was pretty true to style, it highlighted the roasted malts and the sweet lactose just like a good example of this style should and it was easy to drink without being too filling. This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth and the flavors kept me interested, I could drink a couple of these but after that I think the sweetness would wear on me. What I liked most about this beer was how true to style it was, it was everything that I expect from the style and it looked damn good in my pint glass. What I liked least about this beer was nothing, there wasn't anything that I felt was out of place with this beer. I would buy this beer again, it was priced right and was just what I want in a Milk Stout, I will be buying this again when in the mood for the style and I highly recommend giving this beer a try if Milk Stouts are your thing. This turned out to be a good and really solid Milk Stout, I don't think of this as a double Milk Stout, to me it's just a good example of the style and not a double version of this style. I didn't like their Porter too much, but these 2X beers have impressed me, I am sad to see there are no more beers in this series, it would be nice to see a 2X Red Ale or a 2x Pilsener. Good job Southern Tier, I will be on the look out for more of your beers and I would love to try the barrel aged version of this beer one day."

"Pours deep dark black from the bottle with very little head. Smells a bit of wet dog and a little roasty chocolate. Meh. Flavor follows with some mild chocolate and only a hint of roast. Slightly disappointed here. Syrupy stout with one dimensional mild chocolate flavor. Decent, but I'll stick to Mokah and Choklat."
"A nice milk stout that impressed me. I will buy again & would love to see how a fresher version compares"
""
""
""
""
"Multiples because of the medium alcohol and the good balance of flavors."
""
"In comparison to the other milk stouts, it had a nice balance that seemed to be more alined to a sweet stout than the milky desert beers that I usually run into in the milk stout side of life. The price is right as well, but only when you need to fill the last slot in your average mix six."
""

"Overall: Honestly, the dry finish, inoffensive sweetness, and prominent roasted malt flavor makes this a satisfying stout fix. It's nothing spectacular, but if someone showed up at a party with a 6pack, I'd be happy to have one."

"Mouthfeel is decent, but for a milk stout it's not that creamy or smooth."
"This is a stout. If that sounds like an understatement, let it be known: this is a stunning milk stout. Southern Tier continues to impress me. By far, it is one of the few breweries I have seen that tries to push boundaries in terms of flavors, profiles, and concepts with their brews. Their 2X milk stout is no different. I poured it from the bottle and let it invite itself humbly into my glass. As a friend of mine would say, it is a quiet drink. It's thickness became easily apparent to me based on its silent pour. It is remarkably opaque with just the slightest twinges of mahogany around the edges of the glass. The head of the beer is a sultry cream color with a tint of a caramelized sugar hue. It even smells amazingly creamy, with enormous waves of malts churning dark murmurs of milky chocolate froth upon themselves. The taste is a sweet savor on the tip of my tongue. There is just the slightest flavor of a light coffee roast-- perhaps of the Colombian variety. The taste is clear though: big roasty, creamy malts. But wait, I do believe I capture a brief snap of a hop presence at the very end of the finish. Now, that is impressive. Considering that this is a milk stout, it coats the mouth pleasantly, but briefly. My recommendation: enjoy this on a cool summer night, with the music of your choice and feel its comforting, yet seductive embrace. Cheers to Southern Tier for another great beer."

"O: A very good milk stout that's not overpoweringly sweet but has a nice balance. Kind of a baby brother to Southern Tier's line of big stouts in bombers."
"355ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on apr´12. Pours very dark brown in color crowned by a creamy, thick layer, foamy head. Lasting froth with nice rings & collars. Toasted malt & subtle bready yeast with a chocolate touch aromas. Gentle toasted malts & low bitterness at first sip followed by an involving sweet sensation. Lactose sugar creates a pleasant sensation on to the palate. Drinkability results flavorful without fat or cloying mouthfeel unfortunately associated to many spots of the Milk Stout Style. Perfectly covered ABV. Of course I´d have more than one!"

"On Tap from Joe Canal's. Pours dark brown with a long lasting, thick, beige head, good amount of lacing and carbonation Aroma is of bready, toasted malt and dark fruit. Body is full and creamy. Taste is toasted malt, bread, roasted grain, dark fruit, cacao, brown sugar and some earthy hops. Long, somewhat sweet finish. Nice, complex brew."

"Overall: Very drinkable, so the score goes up. Nothing spectacular but fine. Like it better in a bottle."

"This beer pours pitch syrupy black with a brow/tan head. The smell is light but matches the taste. This beer is quite tasty but not super flavorful. Flavors include chocolate, roasted malts and a creamy maltiness. The lactose sugar is definitely detectable and I actually quite like what it provides, I have never been big into lactose sugar. The brew is pretty syrupy but smooth. Its like having a desert in a drink. This beer doesn't stray too far from the pack but its quality speaks for itself. Good stuff"
"O: Pretty decent. Pretty much what you'd expect from the style, but with just a little more oomph. It's more of a sipper due to the higher abv and chewy body. Esters get a touch distracting."

"A nice beer, although the strong Vegemite nose is a flaw which certainly detracts from enjoying the beer."

"O-This is pretty good. Nothing exceptional. Nice sweetness to it, lacking a bit of flavor, but nice to sip on."
""
""
""
"Overall, on the sweet side, as with all southern tier stouts I've tried, but the acrid roast malt and coffee flavors balance well."
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color stout with a nice large off-white foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt notes with some lactose notes is pretty impressive. Taste is a nice balanced mix between some light dry roasted malt notes which are offset by loads of lactose with a subtle dry coffee finish. Body is quite full with a nice creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Very well brewed with great drinkability factor."
""
""
"One suggestion involves lowering the level of carbonation to lessen the sting of the alcohol. Otherwise, a solid brew here."
""
"O: This was pretty good, but it paled in comparison to """Choklat'""" ""Oat," and """Mocha.""""
""
""
"The palate opens with an enjoyable, creamy, chocolate flavor that's surprisingly bold. The sweetness of the malt bill makes this taste closer to a 35-40% cocoa chocolate compared to the nose. Some sweet coffee flavor is present as well. All told, a little sweeter than it needs to be with the caramel/sugar notes dominating the lactose flavor, that's also present. A very smooth roasted malt flavor is present, lending a mild bitterness in an attempt to balance the sweetness. Lactose lingers on the finish, leaving sweetness, a little bitterness and some coffee. Medium in body with a moderate carbonation, this feels quite nice on the palate. Ultimately, it could use a little bit more roasted malt flavor to balance the sweetness. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"This brew hides the ABV very well and is similar to a Starbucks bold that’s been sitting out all day. Definitely a nice desert beer that’s worth trying."
"Overall: It's not the creamiest, most smooth milk stout on the block, but it's still fairly solid. I enjoyed it well enough."
"O - Reminds me of a Terrapin Wake N' Bake with some lactose sugar and tart cherry skins thrown in. I enjoyed it but would rather have a Founders Breakfast Stout."

"Flavorful stout, more sweet chocolate and milky notes on the palate. Sweet but not near cloying. Quite enjoyable offering. Nice with any sort of chocolate dessert. Worth giving a try."

"Overall: Second milk stout, and it is honestly notch below my previous, I was expecting a bit more. Regardless a good beer, salud!"

"Overall, very solid brew that gets better as it warms. Nice lingering sweetness and pretty solid bitterness."

"ABV7.5 but ,by taste, you wouldn't really know it."

"The roasted malts really meld nicely with the bitterness and is a unique stout because of how tasty it is yet not very thick like a traditional stout. Definitely a good beer in my opinion."

"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a chalice. 1 finger head, dark brown, but able to see through beer when backlit. Head lasted approximately 10 minutes before disipating. Smells of faint smoke mixed with some root beer. Subtle malts shine through with a deep waft. Complex and creamy, with mild roast and mild smoke, balancing each other nicely. Finishes a little sweeter with some caramel lingering, but not overpowering the bitterness of a stout. Smooth mouthfeel as a cream stout should be. Very nice!"
""
"D - Not bad, the aroma is a bit weak but the flavor profile is full and complex. It is unusually dry for a Southern Tier beer and this seems to suit it well, giving it a drinkability that you would never get in most of their other stouts."

""
"O: This was a solid stout – smooth flavors and aroma with enough alcohol to make it interesting."
""
""
"I guess this is a bit of a hybrid style, but one can certainly appreciate what ST was trying to accomplish and they did a darn good job in my opinion. This beer is delicious and offers the best of the milk stout with the best of the imperial/American double stout."

""
"Overall: A pretty solid stout. Nice hop presence for a milk/sweet stout."
"O: I'm not the biggest fan of the milk stout style - they tend to be thin and uninteresting - but the 2X Stout is an excellent, enjoyable beer."
"Overall: You can tell this is a Southern Tier beer, with the sweet and chocolate tones that have become the trademark of their stouts; I find them enjoyable in small quantities and this is no exception; glad it is is a 12 oz bottle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and although it has an added kick with the extra strength, the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. It doesn’t have the creaminess compared to other beers in the style but it has lots of chocolate flavors."
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours opaque black with a thin light brown head that holds little retention and leaves no lacing on the glass. Aromas are sweet milk chocolate and roasted grains. Tastes are sweet and creamy with milk chocolate and roasted grains, slight prickle on the tongue from the alcohol that is non-existent, with a bit of hop bitterness on the finish. Mouth-feel is creamy and smooth, while being full-bodied. Overall, good take on the style, especially with the extra ABV."
""
""
"Way different than I expected when I saw """2x Stout""" but this is not necessarily a bad thing. The unique property of this beer is the mellow roasted flavor which allows all the underlying flavors to come out. Don't let to color of this beer trick you, it is a very mellow and drinkable brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is on the heftier side of medium, perhaps verging into heavier, with a carbonation that is appropriately light while making for a bit of creaminess. There's a good smoothness to this beer as well."
"The nose had me excited but the flavor has a kind of burnt hoppy oxidized feel that just doesn't blend out to well."
""
"I find Southern Tier beers to be very hit or miss, and this one is definitely a miss. Poured a dark mostly-black color with a thin, wispy off-white head that dissipated almost completely; no real lacing to speak of. Not much on the aroma, some roasty malts, touch of cocoa. Taste was really very bland and one-dimensional, with simple dark roasted malts, and distant notes of cocoa and mild hops; tannin astringency abounds; dry finish with no flavor lingering. Thin and watery, light-bodied for the style, and really nothing here that would inspire me to order the beer again."
"O - a decent enough stout to enjoy every once in a while."
""
""
"O- nice milk stout with good amount of hoppiness, which I like."
""
""
""
"Great brew here. I love the flavors, the mouthfeel, the drinkability. Only get a little bit of the abv in the end. Almost like an imperial milk stout. Great brew here."
"Mouthfeel is good. Not too heavy for a stout, but certainly not too thin, I'd go with medium bodied. Good carbonation level with a nice bitterness at the finish. Well balanced and full flavor. Nothing not to like. A solid offering from Southern Tier."
""
""
"O/D- this is the type of beer where one aspect ruins all the positives. The hop bitterness of this is not only out of style but it's off putting and clashes with the sweet, chocolate and toast characteristics. Not something Id get again."
""
""
""
"not as sweet as i would expect a """sweet stout""" to be. it is a mighty good stout though."

""
"O - This is a really tasty double milk stout. I was skeptical but now I'm glad I bought a six pack."

"O-Not a bad stout but not the best from southern tier. I would get it again but not my favorite."
""
""
""
"O: Enjoyable but not my favorite stout offering from this brewery. Nice flavors but just not as exceptional as some of the others, enjoy the dryness in the finish of this one. Easy to drink and sessionable, just not sure I would have more than one of these myself as I prefer some other stouts more."
""
"O: All in all, this is a great milk stout. WOW! This is so drinkable it's crazy! It's like drinking chocolate milk. Definitely try if you like a sweet stout that is incredibly drinkable."

"A really tasty milk stout. Alcohol well hidden, seems more session than imperial. Recommended."

""
"Another good ST brew."
""
"Overall: easy to drink. I could see myself drinking a couple of these in an evening."
""
"Overall (4.0): More subdued than I was expecting, honestly, considering how sweet some of Southern Tier’s beers are. Especially the higher-ABV brews—I think the only really dry one I can think of is 2XIPA. This is better than I was expecting, and I’m glad to have tried it. A nice, well-put-together stout that any lover of dark beers would enjoy (even if they’re not blown away by it), but also a very good place to start for anyone looking to develop a greater appreciation of stouts."
""
"Another quality offering from a superb American craft brewer. Tough to disagree with most things Southern Tier."
""
""
"O- about part for the course, but still very good. The ABV is hidden very well in this one, and you get a nice bang for your buck with it. Most milk stouts cost roughly the same about per sixer, and have much less alcohol"

""
""
""
""
"This was the last of my six pack, and overall, it was a very enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The 7.5% abv is very hard to notice. Just a slight warming in the finish and in the belly. Another solid example from Southern Tier."
""
""
"O: This is actually kind of bitter for a cream stout. There is a good roasty quality to it along with some light tones of milk. Not bad."
""
"O- A decent beer, but my feeling is this beer is going in too many directions. The hops tend to throw off the overall roast and sweetness a bit. I wouldn't mind if the body was just a bit fuller too."
""
""
"Some detectable alcohol on the swallow. Wouldnt know it was a milk stout at all by tasting it."
""
"The palate is smooth; lighter than a regular stout would be. Coating the tongue are rich malt flavors. Dark chocolate, caramel and roasted malts all take center stage. Brewed with 2 hop varieties, the finish releases the perfect touch of bitterness with a hint of smoke."
""
"2X Stout is a pretty good release from Southern Tier. It’s not among their best, but it is okay. The biggest issues with this one are the odd dark fruit flavor and the strong burnt flavor on the tail. If those two things were addressed, it’d be improved. It’s really not bad as it is though. Worth checking out? Yeah, it is."
"O- A decent offering from Southern Tier. Was hoping for more having tasted several of their other stouts. Perhaps I am judging this brew to harshly."
"Mouthfeel is like other cream stouts- not very much carbonation, medium bodied. This tastes fantastic in a cask."
"Overall: a decent milk stout that has a nice flavor profile. It is not as big as the 2X IPA but it is satisfying."
"I enjoy this, it's deep, heavy, good chocolate flavor that doesn't taste fake that is paired with a slight acidic componnet. I also like the alchol being slightly noticeable. But while I enjoy it, I also find it distracting. Interesting take for sure though"
""
""
"2X sout is an OK milk stout, but it's too big and too hot for me, especially considering the actual ABV isn't huge. I tend to think of milk stouts as being smooth and light on the alcohol flavors, which I like. I'm guessing that just isn't what Southern Tier was going for here, and it reminds of one of their big flavored stouts without a ton of sweetness. It's worth a try if you're interested in a big milk stout (which Southern Tier does a lot of, and does them pretty well)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this one but this is a two in a sitting max due to the sweetness. One of Southern Tier's better smaller bottles. I really hope they continue with producing quality beer in small sizes. I will look for this again."
""
"O-this actually reminds me of a pure old time english stout. i like this a lot. its well balanced and extremely drinkable. i could drink this all night long. in fact, a case of this might not last long. if you get this, don't plan on being blown out of the water, but i bet you'll be impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I liked the 2XIPA so I knew I would like this. Wonder if a case of this is around 40 bucks (like the 2XIPA) since it might be the best stout buy in town."
"A good stout that is on the lighter side of stouts. I'd drink it again but like the Blackwater series much more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well next time I see the thread """best value""" or """best bang for your buck""" or """best cheap imperial stout", this one will definitely have to be mentioned. At under 2 bucks a bottle for this flavorful and high octane stout, I encourage you to try to find a better deal. I am very pleased with this series thus far from Southern Tier and would like to see more variations."
"O: This is a nice stout that is not overly lactic, and has good hop presence as well. The alcohol is very apparent in the taste and mouthfeel, which detracts from it somewhat. Overall, a drinkable stout that I would have again."
"O - I won't buy this one again. I head good things, so maybe this was a bad bottle? If I run into it at a bar I may ask for a swig to give it another chance, and if someone has a free one for me I'd give it an honest mulligan but boy was this glass bad."
""
""
"Pours a dark brown bordering on black. Off white, tan head forms and leaves behind a creamy wall of lace. The aroma is of chocolate, coffee and charred malts. In the taste, lots of sweet lactose, brown sugar, milk chocolates, coffee and cream. There is a light smokey component, and a bit of alcohol comes through. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy and oh so smooth. Overall, this is a very nice big milk stout, worth checking out."
""
"Pours jet black with a tan head. In the aroma, coffee and a sweet lactose sweetness. In the taste, sweet lactose/ milk flavor, with notes of coffee and chocolate. A smooth and medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a dry coffee and small sweet lactose in the aftertaste. More an imperial stout with coffee than a milk stout, but it is nice nonetheless."
""
"Pours a lightly chalky dark brown, thin cap of khaki froth, reduces to floating spot, little lacing. Scent brings strong chocolate and roast notes with faint kiss of powered sugar sweetness. Taste a little more in depth than scent dictates, but still more roast and chocolate and only a moderate sugary sweetness. Fuller side of medium bodied, smooth with faint chalkiness. Overall, a little unbalanced for the style, but still a very nice and flavorful beer."
""
"Medium bodied with slight carbonation, this beer is a little harsh in the swallow. The body is nice and light while allowing the flavors to come through. The carbonation is a bit lacking and definitely does not help this beer's drinkability."
"12oz bottle. Pours a deep dark brown/black color with very little head. No lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, smoke, chocolate milk, and dark chocolate. Taste is smokey roasted malts, chocolate milk, and earthy. Some sweet dark chocolate near the end. Very little carbonation with a silky mouthfeel. Slightly sour. Overall, a decent milk stout worth grabbing."
""
"Poured a deep black, with just a small amount of tan head. Really sweet smelling, with lots of chocolate and milk, imagine a hot chocolate. Awesome taste, a good deal of milky sweetness with some malt that's balanced well with the coffee/chocolate malt flavors. It leaves a nice sweet finish that lasts a little longer than you'd expect. Great beer."
"O: Not a bad offering, but really not my favorite representation of the style. I preferred terrapin moohoo and riverhorse oatmeal milk stout."
"A decent big milk stout, but the alcohol does not hide very well in it."
"O - Interesting take on the style, with more bitterness to counteract the sweetness than I would expect. Very drinkable and satisfying. Not as wonderful as some of this breweries other offerings, but it outdoes the Blackwater series in the area of balance. Those beers are entirely one-noted, even if they are delicious!"
"black appearance, very short khaki colored head with weak retention. Heavy cream, milk chocolate, with mild hints of ground coffee and vanilla bean. Sharp raw espresso flavor with vanilla and cream on the initial sip. Caramel sweetness with some even, balanced hops. Relatively flat, simple overall body. Some touches of cherries and sugared dates reveal themselves, following into a strictly coffee & cream aftertaste. Creamy, sweet, bittersweet. A great example of a milk stout."
"O: Good stuff. Creamy and tastes like a milk stout should. Score bumped up here to reflect overall impression."
"It's a full bodied beer with carbonation more on the low side, with a surprisingly slightly dry finish which I didn't expect considering it's a milk stout. Drinkability was alright considering it's 7.5% ABV. Overall, I really liked this beer and compared to other milk stouts, I'd wager this was one of the better ones that I've had."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but some room for improvement. Inceasing the mouthfeel, reducing the smoke/acrid notes and upping the lactose would improve this one. I was let down a little, but had high expectations the quality of this would mirror something like Choklat or Mocha, but alas, it does not."
"4.0 D: Very nice beer. Worth a purchase or two. Solid all around."
"O: I had high expectations for this after my friend's recommendation. Though I wasn't turned off by it, the beer didn't quite do it for me as much as I'd hoped it would. B-/C+."
""
""
"Taste-Milk chocolate, coffee with cream, subtle hop prescence in the back ground. Very smooth and sweet but not overly so. Well balanced. Recommended."
"All in all, a good offering that I may go back to from time to time if it comes out again. I think one bottle in a sitting is plenty though."
"Overall, I think this is a good, solid stout. Definitely worth a try and is a stout that I would surely recommend."
""
"D - Really nice! I enjoyed this one a lot. I won't hesitate to have it again either."
"The mouthfeel is leaning towards the heavier side and pretty creamy. Carbonation is moderate. Overall it was a pretty good beer of the stye. The sweeter, creamy, lactose was a very nice compliment to the bolder, roasted malts. Very flavorful and drinkable beer and a very nice one of the style."
""
""
"O - overall this is a decent stout. not too heavy but heavy enough!"
"Overall: the amount of vanilla and cream was well done but still not all that memorable for me."
"i want to love this beer i want like this beer i read the reviews , man im in a slump , ita a milk stout why does it leave a boozy aftertaste in your mouth . oh but what a frist taste and going down is mighty fine dont know what else to say at 7.5 that too high , drink and enjoy it dark nothing finer then that"
"All I need ot remember is Southern Tier 2X - that = great."
"I'm expecting the sweetness to come through loud and clear with a milk stout but it's not happening for me. It's got more hopiness taste than what I'd expect in a milk stout or maybe that is alcohol coming through . I'd call it a 'big' beer and I pretty much like anything in that category. I'm not picking up what I'd call a refined smell. Kind of rawness about it to my nose. Contrary to some other posts I'm not finding this to be high in smoothness. I'm getting a lingering hop / bitterness aftertaste. If this was a style that would get better with age then that is what I'd recommend to make it better. Bottled on date 12/29/2011"
""
""
"new st 2x series entry. A nice aroma, body with a bubbly head, a decent mouthfeel. A good malting,some chocolate malts, and a very good drinkability. Solid stout, no off-notes. Not too sweet nor bitter nor too roasty. This should prove popular. Hoppy taste is rather subdued."
"overall - a solid example of the style."
"overall i'm impressed with this stout. the sweet and sour lactic notes are muted, it certainly has a double stout taste and feel to it, and it never comes across as cloying or syrupy. after being underwhelmed by previous southern tier offerings, i would consider this a definite must try and would highly recommend for winter time consumption."
"Overall-Very impressed with this beer, not your everyday stout, has a great drinkability. I will be seeking this out again."

"All together I think this is a decent milk stout, but the bitter finish sort of threw me off. I would have liked to have kept the sweetness throughout. I did it in enjoy this though and hope that Southern Tier continues to make more beers in this 2X series. I’m currently drinking this the day after a snow-storm and it’s doing a good job of hitting the spot."

"Pours a deep chocolate brown with a very thin beige head, not much lacing at all. Smell of Chocolate and roasted malt on the nose, toasty and nutty. Medium bodied, nice and creamy, but just a touch of hops. Nice chocolate sweetness, the lactose is nice with the bittering hops. Seems like a dry finish, but how can that be with a sweet Stout? It works."
""
"Overall impression: A big, roasty milk stout. Seems a little hop forward for the style and definitely too big but enjoyable and well crafted."
""
"Overall, the flavors didn't do it for me. I guess I expected a little more from Southern Tier. I'll pass on this one in the future."
"Poured into an overshaped chalice, I get deep dark abyss absorbs all visible light in the body. Big mocha tan head forms thick like a barista just made me something special with extra froth. Fine even lacing between sips pretty nice looking effort from upstate NY. Arom I get dusted cocoa, creamy milk chocolate candy offerings, with some dry roasted malt notes. Flavor is super sweet coats the sides of the palate rushes you with a sweet chocolate syrup notes, enough dark roasted malt character to balance it out to keep it from becoming sickeningly sweet. Dark chocolate dry finish with a hint of creamed coffee, herbal hops barely linger in there. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied definitely sweet to round out the palate but it's not cloying in anyway. Overall it's a 12 ounce offering from Southern Tier that represents something different than their mainstream diabetes inducing blackwater series which started out amazing as a beer called IS that to this day stands out as an amazing Imperial Stout that they've never recaptured since the first year I tried that beer. This is a step in the right direction away from Creme Brulee, Choklat, Jahva, and Mocha."

"Capping the day off with a new brew to the area. It pours a dark black-brown topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, cocoa, vanilla bean, and the lightest possible touch of molasses. Everything's kinda laid back, not wanting self-expression to get anywhere close to out-of-hand. The taste brings in more of the same, with some darker roast, some sweeter cocoa, some bitter dark chocolate for the sake of it, a touch more vanilla bean, and a stronger (though still relatively subdued) vein of molasses. Right on. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a nice little cream stout, something I could actually see as a go-to milk stout (along with Left Hand and Young's). Good times."

"Definitely sweet, and definitely better on draft than in the bottle. More carbonated than I would have expected, but terribly so. Chocolate flavor mixed with a slight roast. Finishes fairly smooth with a hint of bitterness. Overall a solid stout but not up to par with Southern Tier's other bombers."
""
""
"O: Not bad, just a slightly stronger milk stout than most. Lactose is a bit overpowering but not unpleasantly. Like drinking chocolate milk beer."
""
" the taste is a little more dry than expected with light toasted flavor and gentle cocoa expression with a mild caramel tinge and slight woody taste with light hop accent and tinge of coffee roastiness w/ a semi-sweet note as it finishes. Overall this is a better than average stout but it loses me on the 2x concept - I understand it is bigger than most sweet stouts, though. It is good for the style but could use more body to be more 'stout-like' IMO."
""
"Lighter to medium body, with lower carbonation. A thin, creamy feel. Alcohol is hidden well. Not bad, until you get to the finish. I was expecting better."
""
"O-The sweetness needs to be toned down a little bit. ST usually hits the mark with their stouts but this one seems to have way too much sugar."
""
""
"O: Not one I will be going back to -- sweet but not much depth of flavor and the tobacco/ash really has no place in this style."
""
"O- Not quite as sweet as a lot of stouts that I've had. Nowhere near as sweet as the Southern Tier Creme Brulee. Overall not bad, would consider drinking again but definitely not my favorite milk stout that I've had."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall - The taste of the brew makes of for some lacking in other catagories. A nice stout to try."
"O: A really solid milk stout. I'm glad I got to try this one it was very enjoyable. I wouldn't turn it down but there are much better beers made by Southern Tier."

"Poured a dark brown/black with an off-white head. Little retention and a tight collar. Nose has some coffee grain, dry and chalky dark chocolate notes as well. Taste has dark toasty grains, bran (?), light smoke, coffee and some toasty/chocolate notes. Medium mouthfeel, medium-low carbonation. A good but not great stout. Lacks any substantial complexity or thickness in the body - left me wanting much more."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking dark brown color with a moderate mocha colored head on top. There wasn't much lacing, the retention wasn't too bad though. The smell of the beer has a nice mellow roasted aroma with a bit of chocolate on the nose also. The taste of the beer was sweet upfront with a solid bitter roasted dark chocolate finish. The mouthfeel was creamy, medium amount of carbonation and smooth. Overall this beer was pretty good in my opinion, I liked the mouthfeel the most I think. I can definitely see myself having this beer again one day."
"Overall:Not as sweet as i'd expect, not as thick as i would have liked. Not what i hoped for, but still good. I've heard really good things about this brewery so i'll keep trying their brews out."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown color with a thick light tan head. Slight roast and chocolate in the nose but nothing over the top like some of their other beers. Medium, velvety mouthfeel. Slight roast with a dark chocolate sweetness. Almost has a little smokiness to it as well. Ends with a lingering bitterness and leather taste. Overall, not as good as I expected from them."
"O: A solid milk/sweet stout that I wouldn't hesitate to order on draft but once from the bottle is enough for me."
""
"Notes: Overall a very tasty an drinkable beer start to finish. Cheers."
""
"O - overall, a good offering from Southern Tier, glad I tried it, not sure if its one that i wlll keep in my regular rotation though"
""
""
"Overall I'd say it is a fairly good stout, very drinkable, though I usually prefer a stout with a bit more character."

"O/D- God, the metallic taste won't leave. My palate refuses to adjust to it. Really surprised to dislike this beer as much as I do. I love their 2X IPA, but this 2X bothers me. Makes me glad to have only purchased a single. I rarely, rarely drain-pour, but this one is close."
"kind of a different take on a milk stout, but not all bad. IMO this could use some more body and less of a grainy taste. but drinkable. im sure ill be drinking more of this sooner or later."
""
"Pretty monotone. ST says 2 hops and 2 malts and it shows. Simpler is not always better, I'd like more depth."
"This is not your typical milk stout. Heavy on the roast and chocolate and a little lacking on the sweetness. This is a tasty beer, but I think it missed the style a little too much."
""
""
""
"Wishing I would have tried this before buying a six pack."
""
"Overall not bad but not quite my style and not great either. Some OK flavors but some not quite what I was expecting. No real off flavors just not very pleasant flavors."
"This is a pretty solid milk stout. The flavors mesh well and there are enough hops to cut the sugary sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable throughout which detracts a little bit from the overall flavor, but adds body so maybe it evens out. In the end I enjoyed it."
""
"nice, easy drinking yet flavorful milk stout. would definitely drink again."
"Some things are lacking like the aroma and appearance. The taste is good, quite complex missing a little something, can't put my hands on it. Otherwise, not a bad brew at all."
""
"Pours a pours a deep brownish black, with a 1 finger head that thins to a tiny white lace around the top. Sweet black licorice on the nose with bitter bitter coffee bean aroma. Toasted robust malted scents with a a sweet chocolate and toffee on the finish. Sweet chocolates, toffee, caramel and a touch of vanilla on the tongue, followed by a roasted nut and coffee bean touch that ends the sip on a bitter finish. Smooth and creamy in the mouth, medium to full bodied, bitter sweet, complex flavors all melding well together. At first sight i was weary about this beer, But wow what a taste. This has big nut and coffee elements to it that just explode in the mouth and a sweetness that only Southern Tier can do right. Im a big fan of this beer for sure."
"O - very solid stout, I really enjoyed it"
"O: try it out."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Good, but I had higher hopes for this one. Pretty tame, and just a little too sweet. I couldn't drink too many in a row."
