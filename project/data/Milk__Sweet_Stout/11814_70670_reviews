"Smells better than it tastes. Kinda a weird fake strawberry aftertaste."

"A truly sessionable dessert beer. I could enjoy 1 or 8, either way would be fine."

"chocolate and strawberry stout! definitely worth trying if you get a chance. nice sweet milk stout that might appeal to even those who don't generally enjoy stouts"
""
"Verdict: Quite the interesting beer, definitely a unique and spot on interpretation of Neapolitan ice cream. It's a bit sweet for me and the oddly roasted quality at the finish doesn't seem to fit, though it helps to balance the beer at least. Lovers of a dessert stout will find this right to their liking."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark black with nice head retention. Smells of roasted malt aromas with hints of milk. Taste is complex. Starts out sweet and smooth, then the taste of roasted malts and bitterness in the back of the throat. Overall a pretty good milk stout. Recommended for a try."

"This beer is one the rise in the Midwest,  it is an up and coming stout"
""
""
"I guilted my cousin back in Michigan to send me some. I am currently nursing the last of a six pack. Smell this stout. Breathe it in. Then put the cap back on and mail it to me..."
""
"Its so so so sk"
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a lighter effervescence. Come off as more of a porter but that's picking nits, really. Good stuff."
""

""

"Overall: If it were feasible to have my blood replaced with this then I probably would - it's absolutely amazing. Sadly, it was a 'chance' inclusion in a mixed case of American beers that I bought recently, and the folks that I got this from don't list any Saugatuck ales at all, which is a pity. I suspect that this is going to take some hunting down, but given the chance I'll have it again."
""
""
"Amazing Beer! I couldn't get enough!"
""
"The beer gets silky as it warms"
"Balanced coffee, chocolate and raspberry.   Only tasted on tap.  Small brewery. Great effort."
"Overall, the more the beer warms, the more I enjoy it, and the feel becomes silkier.  An interesting beer you should definitely try once for yourself (warm)."
""
""
""
"I like this beer and it does smell and taste like Neapolitan ice cream, but artificial flavor and color added?  Really?  I guess the ice cream is probably artificially flavored also, but this is supposed to be craft beer and this just feels like a shortcut. Scores would be way higher if they could make this naturally."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great aroma. Must drink at 45-50 degrees in order to pull out the strawberry and vanilla flavors."
"O - a great dessert beer,prob couldn't have more than 1 in a sitting."
""
"Pretty fresh (12/01/14 if I'm reading the second line of the code correctly.)"
""
"I can see having one of these every so often as a nice alternative to a desert."
""
""
"It's relatively light, in taste and body (I have no idea how to rate ""look""--it looks like stout, duh). Not a lot of head. Anyway, yes--I thought the label (which is gorgeously retro) and the name were a joke, but no, it really does taste and smell like Neapolitan. It has a chocolatey-strawberryy taste and a feel in the mouth of dairy/vanilla, and it is fun, really fun to drink. I don't think I've ever had a Milk Stout before, and I suppose I expected something stronger and heavier, but this was fine and I would certainly drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"It looks like a stout with a nice thick head that laces the glass as you drink.  This truly smells like neopolitan ice cream!  The taste follows with a light strawberry creaminess blending perfectly with the roasted malt/""textbook"" stout flavor that dominates but doesn't overpower.  Smoother and less bitter than most stouts.  Mouthfeel is very creamy,  and balance is perfect.  Wow!  Is this my new favorite stout?  Very well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"very sweet desert style milk stout... overall too sweet for me, but coupled with some cheesecake or similar desert would be good."
""
"Delicious, full bodied stout with hints of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla - just like the label says! There is a slight bitterness to the flavor but it's not enough to detract from richness of the stout itself."
""
""
""
""
"O: For a dessert beer, or as a stout refuge away from the relentless and unending array of hop-forward beers out there, this is quite tasty. Will repeat."
"Creamy taste, smooth finish. One of my favorite milk stouts."
""
""
"Poured from a chilled 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. Pours a very dark  brown with minimal head.   Aroma fits the spirit of the beer perfectly although the stawberry is a little on the artificial side.  Tastes of a wonderful mixture of chocolate,  vanilla,  and strawberry.   Again the stawberry reminded me of freeze dried stawberry ice cream instead of fresh strawberries but i think this plays into the neapolitan theme.   Wonderful beer that lives up to its name."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow....great beer saugatuck! Pours an opaque with ecru head and no lace.  The scent carried hints of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. The taste was a nice medium bodied stout with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a solid offering."
"Artificial strawberry in the smell and taste. I don't get the high rating."
""
""
"Good sweet stout; not cloying or overpowering sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not too bad, the strawberry comes through the most and the chocolate is more of a coffee but pretty decent."
""

"Overall, this is a bitter, synthetic mess that isn’t worth the time to try."
""
""
""
"just caught the end of the keg and the 2 ounces I had was pretty good.  will look forward to a second chance with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This starts off rough around the edges at first, but everything basically comes together at the end. This is a unique beer to say the least. I went into this thinking I would love it, but I ended up just liking it. It even had moments when I was questioning it, but I give them credit for this one. They basically deliver exactly what they advertised. It ultimately reminds me of Neapolitan ice cream."
""
"Quite weird. I think this is actually what they intended, but it truly tastes like icecream. Not convinced I like it, but it's definitely something to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the adult version of neopolitan ice cream. While it leans heavy on the strawberry there is enough balance to make this an above average milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was very surprised at how much it tasted like Neapolitan Ice cream."
""
""
"O- Sure it is gimmicky idea for a beer, but this beer exceeded my expectations,  It tastes exactly like a neapolitan beer milkshake.  The strawberry flavor is definitely reminiscent of the the little ice cream cups with the wooden spoons, but in this case I don't mind that artificial taste."
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to my buddy Mike for this one, a pitch black pour with a finger or so of creamy dark tan head. Aroma is indeed as advertised, milk chocolate, vanilla, red berries, and caramel with a whiff of ash. The sweet cream and berry notes become more prominent as one sips, although the opposite is true on the palate, with the chocolate and roasted barley notes increasing in salience. This crossover effect between nose and palate added to the experience to me ... Perhaps the strawberry is overdone, although the sweet cream, vanilla, coffee, and caramel elements gave me something else on which to focus and there was a robust charred barley note poking out that prevented things from becoming too sweet. I am reminded of dehydrated astronaut ice cream rather than the stuff in the big yellow bucket. Wonderful mouthfeel, silky smooth and rich but not overly thick. Finishes with faint grassy hops and light ash. Quite tasty all told, with some childhood nostalgia thrown in for good measure."
""
""
""
"It's true. You can smell and taste a hint of strawberries. Fun labeling on the bottle too."
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes exactly like it should.  Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and sweet.  Nice little stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smells like if you mixed together all the flavors in the carton of ice cream, dominated by the strawberry. Artificial strawberry up front, with a lingering chocolate bitterness in back. This is just ok. Couldn't drink a lot of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pleasant enough rendition of a milk stout, one which well captures the essence of that youthful ice cream treat.  Too bad, then (like many of those 4L pails of yore, I'm sure), that artificial flavours are listed as an ingredient."
""
""
"A most excellent effort."

"love it"

"Had this beer at Sierra Nevada Beer Camp in Chicago and was extremely surprised at how complex the flavors were in this beer. It tasted just like the ice cream... had to get a few refills on this one!"

"Overall- Didn't expect it to be outstanding, and would call it so. I am a beer snob and brewery owner who is not ashamed to say this ""novelty"" beer is a great one."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 1/9/2014. Pours lightly hazy nearly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big fresh strawberry, milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, roasted malt, toast, light coffee, vanilla, cream, light floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast malt, strawberry, and cream notes; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toast, strawberry, vanilla, cream, light floral, and roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, strawberry, vanilla, cream, light floral, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/roast malt, strawberry, and cream flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very creamy, smooth, and slightly slick/chalky moutfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent milk stout! All around great balance and complexity of dark/roast malt, strawberry, and cream flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O-decent milk stout, the strawberry flavor is a little bit too artificial"
""
""
""
""
""
"This stout had just the right amount of the fruity strawberry and vanilla that I expected. Perfect color on the head. I had it at about 50 deg. F. The fragrance was exceptional. The finish was nice - not too malty or hoppy. Carbonation was just a bit too much. It is one of my top 10stouts. I even liked it better than Bell's K'zoo stout."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A very tasty take on a rich chocolate milk stout with the addition of the strawberry in there. This was a very tasty brew and makes for a wonderful dessert beer."
""
""
""
"Poured a dark brownish black, seemingly undercarbonated, with only a small ringlet in place of a head; minimal lacing. Mainly cocoa and dark malts in the aroma, light notes of berry-like sweetness. In the taste, again dark malts and cocoa were dominant, moderately roasty with a bitter twinge, lactose sweetness, but nothing that really came out as ""vanilla," and a artificial strawberry syrup sensation in the background. Medium body, a little wacky/novelty-ish in the flavor department, but I guess it was enjoyable enough to be drinkable. It probably would have been a fine sweet stout without the strawberry flavoring."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tastes exactly how it's described. Well done, not fake, like many other sweet stouts. Recommended."
"This one's worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - a very nice experience though one that i do not need to experience for a while. i would recommend this beer to people who like sweet stouts, especially novelty stouts such as this one."
""
""
"O-The sweetness dominates, as do the somewhat cloying flavors of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate. It was definitely drinkable but nothing I will buy again."
""
" If you see this beer, absolutely buy the hell out of it. This isn't just a sort of novelty beer -- it's a well-crafted one that any adventurous craft beer fan needs to try out. I especially recommend this brew if you like the taste of desserts, but don't so much care for the excessive sweetness they provide -- Neapolitan Stout has an excellent balance that's sure to please... it truthfully offers everything it advertises, and MORE."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet and roasted and almost burnt. It's good, but the roasted malts and sweetness don't ever really come together. Still, it's better than average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I see where they were going here, but I'm not so sure it delivered. Still a pretty good stout regardless of the Neapolitan effort."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I lost track of this beer among my three refrigerators or I would have had it sooner. It actually reminds me of Neapolitan ice cream. It is pretty good, and I would definitely buy it again."
""
"Overall- Really liked this beer as a single show bottle, while I could definitely have more, it's something to sip and savor as if it really were the frozen dessert"
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown to cherry red with a minimal amount of lacing and scant head. Aroma is very nice --some notes of milk chocolate along with the distinct aroma of fresh strawberries. The taste, however, doesn't quite follow. Dark chocolate/coffee bitterness dominates here, with some strawberry sweetness blended in. With every sip, I wish there was a little bit more lactose or milk flavor to balance with the bitterness. The bitterness lingers and confuses the palate a bit. I wouldn't shout off the rooftops about this one, but it's worthwhile to give this one a try--it's pretty unique."
""
""
""
""
"O - Interesting beer that picks up the flavors of the ice cream. It smells just like the ice cream. The only knock I have is the chocolate is slightly bitter / overpowering and it has a slight chalk / artificial taste"

"Saugatuck Neapolitan Milk Stout ---4/5."
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is a big rich milk stout that has lots of nice depth and a Puerto Rican Calle Café flavor to it while still being very sessionable. It went down fast and it was delicious."
""
"If Southern Tier brewed a Neapolitan beer however.."
""
"Who cares what part of Italy this thing came from? It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger-and-a-half of cream-ecru foam. The nose comprises dark chocolate powder, mild (and slightly artificial) strawberry, very light coffee, and light vanilla bean. Well, dammit, it smells like Neapolitan ice cream. Nice. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger contingent of strawberry and a light addition of roasted malts. Things aren't as close to the namesake ice cream as before, but it ain't too far therefrom, either. The body is a lithe medium, with a pleasant nitrogenation and a consequently silky-smooth feel. Overall, it's rare when a beer both delivers on a seemingly pie-in-the-sky promise and also doesn't end up tasting somehow worse than expected. This one does both, and I feel I'm better for it today. Good times."
""
"D - The best beer I've had so far from Saugatuck; evocative of the ice cream I had in my freezer during childhood (I always left behind the chocolate to be honest). Would drink this one again, although a six-pack might linger as it's a bit gimmicky. Delivers what it promises, but if you're against 'fake' flavors this might not be up your alley. All that being said, I had no problem with a 12oz bottle and I was up for another one afterward."
""
""
""
"It pours a thick black color with light cocoa foam. The aroma is all about a milk stout’s sweetness with a combination of chocolate-strawberry and a light cocoa note. The flavor is sharply sweet, and becomes overly cloying as it opens. There’s a strawberry-tinged harshness with a lactic tartness and a sharp finish. It definitely does taste like a Neapolitan ice cream cone—only melted down with the flavors mixed together."
"Flavor starts with a light strawberry, fruity flavor. Then is taken over by dark chocolate, coffee, a little vanilla , and some caramel. This beer taste pretty unique to me. I LOVE IT! The strawberry makes this unique. A great desert drink...makes you want some vanilla ice cream with it. Also a good Stout richness."
""
"Not bad, but I wonder what this would be like with a little more hop presence. The nitro tap gave a nice, creamy head but the beer wasn't quite as robust as I would have liked. Overall, a decent beer, but something I probably won't revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only downside to this beer I see is a thin palate, the palate is watered down oil in my opinion. Not bad by any means, I just wish it had more body."
""
""
"Flavor also has a similar artificial, medicinal strawberry note to it, though the base stout seems good enough. Mildly roasty with a medium level of sweetness, slightly dry and bitter finish. Medicinal note lingers throughout unfortunately, marring an otherwise decent base stout. Just plain weird. Not sure why they released this, it struck me as odd right off the bat. This is a brand new arrival to the market too, doubt it would already be infected."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like the idea behind this beer, but I really wish they didn't have to use artificial flavoring and coloring to make it a reality. Still, it is fairly enjoyable. Makes me think I might actually like a real cherry stout."
""
""
""
"O: This was a pretty good take on a milk stout - not usually my favorite style. To me the coffee flavors were so forward they tended to overpower any of the ""Neapolitan"" that the brewer was looking for. Overall a decent beer."
"M - Medium body with some chew. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one is a bit over the top for me. It does live up to its name quite well, but at the sacrifice of making a good beer. In actuality it is kind of a sweet mess of a beer, but that is what you expect so you kind of just ignore it."
""
""
""
"Pours out a black hue with little retention and sparse lacing from a hard pour. The aroma has a nice smoke and dark chocolate aroma with a hint of strawberry. The taste starts out with a nice burnt, smoke flavor with a slight hint of vanilla and strawberry in the middle along with some walnuts that seem to overtake the strawberry and vanilla and finally the dark chocolate overtakes everything in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly dry, and chalky, but overall a really yummy experimental beer that makes a nice desert drink after a meal or when you just want to relax."
"An interesting experimental brew. Nicely done, although they could stand to tweak the recipe a bit to achieve better balance. Recommended. As an aside, I think it's pretty cool that they will let you use their facility to brew 11 gallons of your own beer for $250."
""
""
""
"O- A very tasty and unique stout. Definitely nice for a change of pace."
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice chocolate stout with some strawberry undertones. Fair warning, this stuff gave me a terrible headache. Might just be me."
"Pours black and viscous with a thin, light brown head that hints at overcarbonation for a stout. Smells of dark toffee and a bit of pine perhaps. Carbonation up front on sip, but gives way quickly to thick body. Strong alcohol flavoring with hints of raisin or prune and chocolate malt. Well balanced. Carbonation does come in a bit at the end. No bitterness in the finish. Taste lingers well on the tongue for several seconds after."
""
""
""
"Wow. Saugatuck is really a tier-3 Michigan brewery that I've had before but in general not paid much mind to. But this here is a winner that makes me think differently about them. Right on the cusp of A/A-. I am sure this is seasonal, but they've really hit on something and should make it more readily available."
"Bottle. Looks good; black with a litttle lacing. Smells good too; chocolate and malt. Solid taste. Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberries. Mouthfeel is great; super-smooth and creamy. Overall, a great brew that I'll definitely be buying more of in the future."
"O - This was pretty enjoyable, all of the neapolitan elements come together pretty well. Not something I would want very often, but I would have this again."
""
"Overall - I was hesitant about this one. A neapolitan milk stout sounds about as bad as it could get, but this tastes pretty damn good. Quite enjoyable and something I would definitely like to drink again."
"O = Keeping the stout style in mind is evident as the beer finishes like a nice traditional sweet stout... A real treat! Really like this beer a lot. One of the best winter seasonal beers available anywhere! Got to drink it while it lasts."
"o - would be great, but the chemical flavors kinda ruined this one for me. i wish they had brewed this with real strawberries and aged it on vanilla beans instead of using a bunch of flavorings. probably not returning to this one."
""
"Overall this is a pretty tasty beer and a nice twist on the style. It loses some points for the use of artificial flavorings, but they worked fairly well in this beer. I would definitely think about getting this brew again."
""
""
"I'm surprised how much I liked this beer, it's pretty good. I might have to help myself to a couple more from my buddy's fridge when I am over there next. Whether you like this beer or not, it will be both unique and memorable."
"Flash of roasted malt up front. Sweet mix of dark fruits, caramel, and milk chocolate quickly follow. Definitely shows some berry/strawberry flavors (but they aren't cloyingly sweet). Hints of vanilla, tobacco, and peat as well. Light coffee bitterness gets a bit lost in the fruity, chocolatey sweetness. Lingering berry in the finish. Medium-full body with a slightly chewy feel. Very well executed and it is what it says it is! Very impressed!"
""
""
""
"This is a solid offering and was worth the try."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty damn good experimental beer, this is the kind of beer that if I tasted it blindly I would think that only Short's can produce a beer that tastes so similar to the food it is based off of, but Saugatuck shows that Short's isn't the only Michigan brewery who knows how to make a damn good experimental beer. This beer has good drinkability for what it is and I would drink another if I had one, it wend down smoothly and it also makes for a perfect dessert beer. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, this beer is pretty much exactly what it says it is and that's how an experimental beer should be, it also look and felt really good. The only thing I would change would be to add a little more strawberry flavor but it does show up a little more when it warms up so it's nothing to complain about. I will for sure buy this beer again and will be going back for some more. I highly recommend this beer if these kinds of experimental beers are your thing, it really does taste like the ice cream. I am really glad that Saugatuck decided to bottle this beer, when I had it at the beer expo I was told it was draft only so I was really surprised and happy to see this beer at the store. I did think the daft version was just a little better, the flavors seemed to pop a little more. This is my favorite beer from Saugatuck and is up there as one of my favorite experimental beers. Saugatuck really did a great job at making this taste like the ice cream while still keeping it drinkable and not to overdone, this shows that you guys have some serious talent when it comes to experimental beers and I would like to see what other crazy beers you guys can make, good job."
""
""
"O- It's a fun beer, as these experimentals should be. It's a good reminder that you can enjoy something creative and outside of style guidelines. The strawberry takes a bit of a back seat to the chocolate and vanilla after a while, but it's still really cool that they could get all 3 components to come together so clearly."
""
""
""
"Rather sweet. Good for a taste, and definitely worth trying for the novelty factor. However, I don't think I could make it through a pint. Fortunately my wife liked it. Needs food to go along with it."
"O: This was such a surprise. Thanks Heath!"
"Stopped at the brewpub only since it was on the way between two other more prominent breweries, glad we did for this gem. Hope they do it on nitro, would be like a milkshake!"
