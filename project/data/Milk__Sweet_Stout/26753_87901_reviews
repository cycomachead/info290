"Overall, a fantastic variant on the GBS even though the new notes are frequently buried."

"OVERALL: Like the base beer, this is no better than okay. The adjunct character is interesting enough, but the base stout is rather weak and the barrel aging is pretty mundane. Still, these pairs are always fun to try and I’d say this one was slightly more interesting than the base beer, so that’s something at least. Cheers again for the brews SiddFinch!"

"Wow though, it tastes great. Soft chocolate. Hints of dead yeast. Also a bit of booze."
""
"I love this beer!! Not much from Hardywood that doesn't make you say """WoW"""!  A perfect winter stout! Slight hints of bourbon and a gingerbread finish."

"It drinks incredibly smooth and viscous. This seemed to  lose a bit of luster from the base beer, which is unusual for anything in a barrel, but maybe I love the original too much."
""
""
""
"Fell short for me in the Taste category...wished there would have been more of a Bourbon presence vs. an undertone"
""
""
"Wow!  Spectacular from start to finish. No bitterness, but a great deal of flavor."
""
""
""
"I gave the regular GBS a 5 and this is just a little better with a little more of an alcohol kick. But this is not an over the top bourbon barrel beer, still very drinkable and not """hot""" at all. Ready to drink now no aging required."
""
"Like hunahpu a lot, surprisingly. Very spicy from the cinnamon"
""
"Had on tap at CCB milkmaid release. I had the regular GBS and the got this on tap. Pour is deep brown, not quite black and gingerbread spice is still present in the nose. The main thing to point out here is that the bourbon is not overwhelming or present up front. It's just slight on the back end. For most people drinking Bourbon BA stouts I could see this being underwhelming but as person that doesn't love bourbon, I thought this was great. The BA added a nice compliment and didn't go to far. Not a 100 but something I'd ISO in the wintertime"

"Flavor is far more melded. The bourbon counters the ginger nicely."
"This is Christmas in a bottle. It's more mellow than it's regular cousin. I like it a lot more and the fact that the bourbon become a flavor not the dominate force is it's strongest attribute."

"Very impressive.  Quite similar to the unbarrel aged version, but the barrel process just adds an extra layer of complexity.  Rich, complex, and subtle barrel character that is not overwhelming.  All the Xmas notes of the regular with maybe a touch of mint coming through.   Big thanks @ AlexHW for this trade."

"One of best beers I've ever had, the ginger is amazing."
""
""
"D: This was a nice brew, with relatively simple but really enjoyable scent and taste. The body was weak, but the finish was super smooth with no alcohol noticeable. So it was all too easy to drink. Not sure how it would age, but it's already so mellow, it doesn't need it. Wish there was a bit more complexity, but this was a solid drink."
""
"Overall-an outstanding beer, the original GBS is excellent and they found a way to improve and enhance it without changing the classic tastes you except. very impressive."

"Review is very similar to the regular GBS review except that the bourbon barrel aging knocks off some of the sugar and sweetness making a much more complex and flavorful beer.  I prefer this over regular GBS.  You can smell and taste the bourbon.  Not overpowering but just enough to calm the sugar down appropriately.  Very smooth and drinkable."

"In response to GreesyFizeek: This SHOULD be medium bodied!"

"This is a really decadent and tasty treat."
""
"Everything about this beer was pleasing.  It had a great nose, beautiful balanced flavors, and a really nice medium carbonation that played well with the spices in the beer.  My only knock was the mouthfeel.  This beer felt a little thin.  Overall, I would seek it out again!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Second chance at this beer, and enjoyed it more the second time, which is less normal these days.  Glad I have one in the fridge at home."

"Really nice beer. Hardywood does it right!"

"O.  In years past, I've criticized this variant of GBS for not adding anything to the base beer.  I stand corrected.  The subtle complexity added by the barrels here makes this an improvement over the original, albeit a very slight one.  Bourbon GBS is a remarkable beer, derived from a similarly remarkable beer from a brewery that knows it has a golden goose on its hands and is squeezing every penny they can out of it.  And they should, as this is utterly unique and inspires years' worth of sentiment and fond feelings of Christmases past, present, and to come."

"Fluffy and velvety.  A vast improvement over the regular to me."
"Very good, better, bigger, creamier and boozier than the base. The bourbon flavors only come out in the finish, but it definitely added a smoothness to the whole experience. My complaint about gbs is that it's a bit to thin, but that problem has been solved here."

"Sugary, gooey goodness; real gingerbread in a glass all mixed in with bourbon and there's hints of vanilla sprinkled in there. Nice and sweet but never cloying. This one delivers on its promise. Very, very good stuff."

"really nice beer."
""
""
""
"What really gets me about this beer is how hugely drinkable it is. Very sweet with nice complexity but at 10.6%, this drinks like its about half of that. Feel is rich without being overwhelming and the thinner body actually works great here. A pretty under-the-radar stout... and definitely one to seek out!"
"Pours a clear super dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, gingerbread, Christmas spice, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with dark gingerbread and spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a great gingerbread and barrel aged presence that comes across much better in the smell to me."

"Overall, about as big as a milk stout gets it seems, and quite tasty.  Much better than I had in the past too.  Very nice."
""
"Overall - The slighest of barrel characters. Wish there were more, but it's still very good."
"Very tasty, and a beer I never thought I'd get a chance to taste. Much appreciated, and quite tasty."

"This is absolutely fantastic. My favorite offering from Hardywood to date."
""
""
"Was quite dissapointed by the standard version - upon popping the cork, you can immediately tell that overcarbonation wont' be an issue here. Not a particularly robust aroma - hints of ginger cookie, bourbon, spice. The flavor profile opens up a bit with clear defined notes of ginger, molasses, chocolate, coconut, bourbon and the like. To me, the intended flavor profile works a lot better in this version. Not without its flaws though - a bit thin, and 12 weeks in a barrel seems a little rushed."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a damn fine brew.. I like the addition of the bourbon, and I like the subtlety of the bourbon as it plays with the ginger, and dances around the chocolate. Fine work."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very delightful beer. I enjoyed the base, but felt it was overcarbonated. This one hits on all counts. I could drink plenty of this one without getting tired of it."

"Poured from bomber into snifter glass. Pours a dark brown along with a thin lacing head that lasts slightly throughout. Aromas are cocoa, toffee, gentle roast and toast. Mellow cinnamon, ginger, and spice. Touches of oak, vanilla, more gentle barrel experience, but it still covers up the spice a bit. Initial is sweeter, darker, cocoa and vanilla, gentle spirit. Ginger, cinnamon, some vanilla life. Middle is sweeter, cinnamon and ginger presence, some creamy vanilla and nice sweetness at times. Spirit, toast, toffee. A touch sweet. Cinnamon and spice assert into finish, nice flavors, gingerbread, some spirit, vanilla, gentle spiciness lingers with mellow heat, toffee, and creamy sweetness. Overall, a fine beer and cannot go wrong this one or the regular although I do prefer the latter."
""
"O: Overall this is a good beer, slightly more complex than the standard GBS, but not notably better. Vanilla flavors by far poke out of this more than in the standard version and the nice heat from the bourbon gives a notably good addition to the total package here. Glad to have tried this."
""
""
""

"This is, without a doubt, one of most amazing stouts I've ever tasted. It will leave you feeling in a state of utopia until you've crashed and yearning to have another taste. Let's see if Hardywood will do it better next time! Oh, yeah, the first line was nearly two hours before I got my limit of two bottles. Who knows what it'll be like next season?"
""
""
"O - As this beer has aged, the overall flavor has really bumped up a notch. The complexity of the original GBS is starting to fill back in while the BA falls off, but is still present."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I enjoyed this version much more than the original version which tasted way to ginger-forward and almost like a messy homebrew. The barrel aging has imparted very little bourbon flavors (which is good IMO for this style of beer) and adds a pleasant vanilla and maple sweetness with a light ginger spicing in the background. Glad I didn't dismiss this after not loving the original."
""
""
""

"O - I enjoyed this, but expected more after having had the regular version recently. Barrel was very subtle and didn't add to the base the way that I hoped it would"
""
"Mahogany brown pour, deep and slightly hazy, with a small tan head that receded to a ringlet, and left a little lacing on the glass. The bottle was open well before I got to it, and thus had a few moments to breathe. Sweet aroma, caramel, cinnamon, ginger, booze, more like flavored vodka than bourbon. As in the regular version, there was a definite cookie taste going on, like a Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pie, but it wasn't as pronounced as I would have hoped, and in this version it was also competing with the vanilla/bourbon/booze flavors. Regardless of that, I do think that this version tasted better, and the bourbon aging improved it, though there was still a bitter, woody unpleasant aspect to the beer. Again, like the original, my main beef with this beer was the body. It's quite thin for a stout, and leaning more towards an English stout or brown ale. It would be interesting to see if they tweak GBS and try to improve it in the future, but considering the hype over it, it's probably not going to change. I definitely wouldn't turn it down if someone offered it to me, but it's not worth standing in line for however many hours to get it."

"Beer is medium in body and has this odd coconut flavor to it that grows with every sip until it is all I can taste. I heard this tasted different on draft and I would be interested in trying it but ultimately the beer was not ginger enough, too much coconut or whatever that was and too thin, not a repeat for me."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark brown with almost no head/lacing. The nose is a pungent nutmeg with none of the other spices or notes of bourbon that I'd expected. The taste brings a lot more ginger and spice forward, but the bourbon still doesn't make an appearance. As I'd expected from the beer's appearance, the mouthfeel is rather thin and mild-medium bodied, but does have a lot more spice, specifically ginger, that lingers in the aftertaste. This beer is quite tasty with great spice and the ginger I was hoping for, but the nose didn't pop with the Christmas season or bourbon as I'd hoped."
""
""
""
"Overall, this was about on par with the regular version, not really better or worse. The bourbon added a nice dimension to it, but I expected a lot more to come through. Also some of the flavors from the original beer were just a tad muted."
""
"Overall: Hardywood makes another crazy awesome beer. Honestly, I hope that GBS and BA GBS are going to be a Winter tradition for the brewers at Hardywood. GBS & BA GBS are the best christmas beers that I have ever had and no other beer even comes remotely close! The barrel really complements the beer; it still lets alot of the flavors of the base beer shine through and accent all of the regular GBS flavors!"
"Very unique, solid. Hard to describe better than that. Thanks for the share egrace84!"
""
""
""
"Truly outstanding. A great example of an already fantastic base stout being taken to new heights by bourbon barrel aging. If you can get this, DO!"
"O - My anticipation was high for this beer as I was curious as to how the gingerbread flavor would react to the introduction of bourbon barrel character. I'm actually pretty floored in how well this turned out! Sure, the ginger flavor is no longer in the spotlight, but a good bit of complexity takes its place to take this beer to a completely new level. If sticking strickly to the holiday theme, the original GBS is probably the better choice. Overall though, I think the Bourbon GBS brings the best overall package/complexity, and is no doubt a fantastic bourbon barrel offering."

"O: This beer is outstanding. One of the better barrel aged stouts I've ever had. Perfect beer for Christmas day with the family. I will seek out more Hardywood in the future."
"Overall: I prefer this to the regular version. The balance was spot on. The spice level was great. I'd definitely have more."
"O: Blown away by this beer. It is a lot better than GBS, in my opinion. While some of the spices have been lost to the barrel aging, the bourbon has added more than it has taken away. Enough of the base beer remains to be appreciated, which is a key for me with barrel aging. You've outdone yourselves Hardywood. 5"

"The bourbon version of Gingerbread Stout reminded me a lot of the 2011 version of the regular Gingerbread Stout, but with some oak and bourbon taste to it. The spices are a bit subdued after 12 weeks in a barrel. The mouthfeel, smell, and taste are all great from the bottle. I tried the draft at the release party and didn't like it as much as the bottle version."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is opaque with a thick beige head. The head lasts for a few moments before fading to nil. The aroma offers cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, oak barrel. The flavor is a step up from the aroma. Lots of holiday spices with only a touch of bourbon. Silky smooth on the palate. Beautifully balanced. Like eating a gingerbread cookie. Sweet but never cloying. A great beer for the holidays."
