"Nitro can into stout glass. Half finger pillowy tan khaki head. Dark body. Opague  black. Smell is roasted malt and yeast. Super crazy smooth. Creamy. With a very so slight tingly zip for feel. Slight bitter dark chocolate and roasty malt taste. Excellent brew. Almost borderline Guinness to me but this is thicker and a bit heavier."
""
""
"I had mine from a can. mmmmm. nom nom nom."
""
""
""
"Supersmooth, taste is very rich, but not as intensive as Pale Ales or Strong stouts have. You feel like it's quite heavy, but you can easily get 3 pints without a being too drunk or full. Great experience, I tried nothing similar. You'll love it or hate it, but you do need to taste it!"

"Mmmm...comfort in a glass. This beer looks, tastes, and feels like an immaculate conception between stout and chocolate. This is, without a doubt, one of the very best beers I have ever enjoyed."
""
"I could get used to it"
"more chocolate, more sweetness and density."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is solid for a light tasting chocolate stout. However, Samuel Smiths blows it away"
""
""
""
""
"Had this twice, first time (about two years ago, craft beer beginner) I loved it!!! Now I honestly am not really impressed, nothing too bad about it it's ok, but i honestly can't say I would buy it again"

"The smoothness you expect from a nitrogenated stout. Great chocolate aroma, very light body despite the appearance in your glass. I prefer a more robust stout than this style, in general, but this is an easy drinking stout that would be worth introducing to people who believe that stouts are """too dark and heavy""" to session."
"O: This is a good example of a double chocolate stout that you can find at the super market here in Mexico. You can find much better chocolate stouts in specialty stores."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great chocolate flavors. Very easy drinking and delicate with a great nitro-can."
"Looks great, smells great, slightly underwhelming taste. I may be biased towards other chocolate stouts but this was a bit disappointing."
"Stouts always throw me as an ipa drinker.  It looks heavy and goes down like water.  Taste with this one is outstanding."
"Looks great, smells great, even tastes great for the initial hit to the tongue. Aftertaste on this is not my thing though. Mouthfeel is only so-so. Still a solid stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First quarter of the beer was tolerable. After that it was an overwhelming Hershey syrup like taste."
"Excellent beer I recommend it"
""
""
"Very dark brown to black.  Very nice foamy head, cappuccino-like.  Started around 52 degrees.  Chocolate was most present in the aroma, but not dominating, with some roasted malt.  Taste was consistent with smell, but with a bit of coffee, too.  Was semi-smooth, wish it was creamier. Alcohol was a little more present than I would have liked.  Feel was on the thinner side, but not too bad.  Different strokes for different folks.  If you like chocolate and a smoother ride, I suggest, for example, Samuel Smith's over this one, but if you like your chocolate tamed by a more traditional beer/ale taste, then give it a try."
""
"Try in cans it has a much smoother taste."
""
"(Nitrocan) Malt and chocolate aroma. Black body with a creamy tan one finger head that coats the glass. Creamy dry chocolate taste with a touch of sweetness. Light bitterness. Feels thick and silky. Clean smooth finish."
""
""
""
"O: Good beer. Not quite as good as some others I've had but definitely worth a shot."
""
"I don't like chocolate but for some reason really like this stout. You can taste the chocolate but it isn't overwhelming."
""
""
"My favorite pub has this on tap and I must say that it is definitely one of my favorite stouts ever, nice and chocolate-y."
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer plenty, but I can't say it was everything I wanted it to be. Too little body and a slightly underwhelming taste experience left me wishing I had grabbed a bottle of Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate Stout instead. "
"Just not really my kind of beer. I prefer to enjoy the chocolate and beer separated."
""
"Good, but not exactly a milk / sweet stout in my opinion. Too toasty."
""
""
"Solid brew, no complaints about this one.  It didn't blow me away, but good all around and a good rep for the style.  Chocolate and coffee on the nose, chocolate and coffee going down.  Nice black pour and creamy enough.  Will definitely drink again and will probably recommend it as a starting point to the style if asked."
"Reasonably priced double chocolate stout, always makes me feel good as it is accessible where I'm at."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – One of the two beers (Bourbon County Stout being the other) that led me down the path to embracing and appreciating craft beer, this is still my favorite sweet/milk stout.  So easy to drink, yet fairly complex, rewarding at different layers."

"DATE TASTED: January 30, 2015... GLASSWARE: Samuel Smith tulip pint... OCCASION: Shark Tanking it up on a Friday... APPEARANCE: pitch black body, as expected; rocky, creamy, substantial three-finger brown head; lacing webs and spreads like camouflage; handsome... AROMA: beautifully milky, creamy chocolate with some almond and vanilla; extremely peaty and toasty... PALATE: smooth as silk; a bit slick; mellow and purely drinkable--a nice, creamy stout that ends with a slightly gritty finish...TASTE: as chocolately and toasty as this is, it is the secondary flavors of hops that inject a nuanced dimension to the stout; lactic and chocolate, back at the end...OVERALL: having binged on this all night in a Brooklyn bar some years ago, I can attest first-hand to its sessionability; drinking a singular bottle in the comfort of my own home, I can attest to its deservedly solo treatment.. the only downer could be the price: $4.99 for a 16oz.er is a bit much, but if it's ever on tap and on special ..."
"This is the type of chocolatey stout I often crave, and this one delivers big time.  In a word....outstanding!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hope they remove this bad artificial flavouring, and return to what this used to be, a great brew."
"This was a beer that holds true to the English styles: nothing over the top, yet very high quality. Was expecting a little more mouth feel as the bottle claims oats were used and the word ‘double’ is in the name. Either way a solid brew for a nice treat during the cold winter months here in the Mid-Atlantic."
""
""
"Creamy stout with hints of chocolate, small head from the tap at """The Pub""" at Perimeter Mall in Sandy Springs north oh Atlanta. A bit flat for my tastes but still very palatable. Distinct coffee on the front. Yummy!"
""
""
""
"Nice creamy head, smooth, and tasty. As stated; pure luxury!"
""
"The mouthfeel is fine carbonation, but with a nitro pour it is like silk. This is one great beer."
""
""
"Overall: For me, Sam Smiths make the perfect chocolate stout - this runs it fairly close but doesn't quite match it in my opinion. It's probably worth pointing out that I'm definitely a stout fan and, along with the Sam Smiths Organic Chocolate Stout, this is going to become a regular on my shelf."
"Nitro can.  Color as expected, lackluster head (thin to non existent).  Slight stout scent. Mild taste, think guinness lite...hint of chocolate.  Not a bad beer but  something I won't go out of my way for."
""
"I made a float with Ben and Jerry's with this stout and it was delicious. I had about 16 oz left in the bottle and by itself its delicious."
""
""
""
"Amazing....PERFECT chocolate flavor. Definently buying again..."
""
""
""
""
"This has taste like few others! Smooth, yet upfront tasty."
""
"Nice chocolate malty aroma and ours with a nice coffee coloured head but it doesn't last long. Good mouthfeel with a balance of carbonation and stouty fullness. The rich malt and fruity chocolate flavours come through well and I thoroughly enjoyed this but just felt it was missing a little something to be really great. Hard to describe but a little bit thin in some way. That said I really enjoyed the sweet aftertaste and while chocolate stouts aren't usually my thing I would definitely have this one again."
""
"Underwhelmed with this one, I've heard the nitro can version is much better. Perhaps I'll give it a try and re-review at a later date."
""
""
"The best chocolate stout. Bar none."
"One of my favorites. Amazing beer. Love mixing fruit crafts with it."
""
"awesome beer. very smooth. tasty"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: frankly this stout could use more backbone, it's not living up to it's name..."
""
"D: Smooth, drinkable and well balanced"
""
""
"Very creamy from the nitro.  Flavor is most definitely dark chocolate on the back of the palette, but no lingering sweetness that would come from actual chocolate.  Enjoyable."
""
""
"An average beer with a treacherous smell. I find it hard to drink and tasted better local chocolate beers...Disappointed!"
""
""
""
"It's ok. More dark fruity than chocolatey though."
""
"Newly introduced in the local market and glad to have it available"
"I was disappointed by this beer.  Tasted bland, and barely noticed any chocolate flavor or aroma."
"Surprised that this beer is so highly rated.  It taste like beer and chocolate tin cans.  Perhaps only because of the broad availability and rated as a comparison to other stouts?  Compared to the quality microbrews of this variety, I find it inferior."
""
"At the strong end for chocolate notes with a nice sweet-bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Nice attempt at a good beer just came away lacking something."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, in my opinion, I like this milk/sweet stout. I'd have it again as dessert."
""
"Had a very outputting smell and taste."
""
""
""
"Pours near black with a brown head that doesn't trail the glass. The smell is full of sweet cream and chocolate, very heavy. The taste is equally heavy with chocolate being the star of the beer with lighter notes of coffee on the end."

"Pours near black with a brown head that doesn't trail the glass. The smell is full of sweet cream and chocolate, very heavy. The taste is equally heavy with chocolate being the star of the beer with lighter notes of coffee on the end. Very decadent but overall a nice after dinner beer. For more fun, make a black and tan with this and Well's Banana Bread Beer for a chocolate covered banana black and tan, really tasty."

"On nitro tap, had this twice in a couple of days. Strangely, on the 2nd visit, this seemed to lack all the chocolatey goodness - to the point where my gf and I both questioned and received samplers of this and other stouts on tap to compare. Seems others have noted some inconsistencies as well. Anyhow, I love chocolate and I love stout, so this really puts it together well!"

"Wow, A self-brewing Canadian friend recommended this beer. So I drank it right now. I bought this beer at Fonthill's LCBO in Pelham, ON, Canada. Its colour and look seem very strong but it is not. Usually I feel stout is little bit strong to me, but this is not. very drinkable and nice taste. Like everybody here said, it has sweet chocolate smell, too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: It's very easy to drink and goes down very smoothly; this is definitely a sessionable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very creamy, smooth stout. A bit on the sweeter side, with bitter chocolate, and again, lots of cream. Carbonation is a little too high, distracts from the smooth overall impression. Chocolate becomes very flashy in the end, mingles well together with coffee notes. Metallic carbonation is still a little unpleasant. Creamy, bitter, long lasting aftertaste."
""
"Overall: extremely pleasant, can be enjoyed with a variety of foods (I drank mine with french cheeses and a salad and it was fitting perfectly). Definitely will drink again."

"Draft.  Pours medium chocolate brown.  Lots of carbonation.  Takes a few minutes to settle.  Aroma of slight chocolate and coffee.  Not good coffee.  Maxwell house.  Ready light for a stout.  Barely any chocolate or coffee taste.  English stout.  You can drink a bunch though.  Like my stout more robust and thick.  This is not either.  Football stout."
""
""
""
""
"An excellent stout. Not as dry as I always like but definitely excellent in its own way."
""
""

"Delicious, rich, smooth, and chocolatey as you'd expect! Great aroma as well."

"O. Not very good especially for the price of $12 a 4 pack. Good buzz for 5.2%."
""
""
""
"old reliable, mixed 1/2 with banana bread"
""
""
""
"A very solid chocolate stout. A bit thin on the mouthfeel but overall great and definitely worth a try."
""
""
"Like a Guiness but thicker. Meaty was the first thought. Cocoa flavor but not sweet. Kind of flat mouthfeel. Expected it to be phenomenal per a friends recommendation. Not what expected. I was expecting the strength of a Founders Breakfast Stout but this it is not."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Simply waving a Hershey bar over a can of Guinness doesn't make it a """Double Chocolate Stout.""" The closest this comes to double anything is a double of Guinness, which I like. The poor rating is because it **pretends** to be something else. Do yourself and wallet a favor and just have a Guinness."
""
""
""
"40/50"
""
""
""
"Poured into a tulip glass, this semi-thick and very dark stout is very tasty. The name is not a misnomer; you can really taste the dark undertones of rich chocolate underneath a very complex landscape of roasted malt. Head retention was decent, almost a quarter inch that remained for the entirety of the glass. Very drinkable, not incredibly heavy on the alcohol content. Very highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  A solid beer.  Will have again."
""
"Overall: A fantastic winter evening beer which is great accompanied with a mars bar! Not a session beer as its quite heavy but 1 or 2 go down a treat."
""
"Aroma and taste have hints of coffee, but really this is all about that dominant dark chocolate taste. It's pretty one-dimensional, with a thick, sweet, chocolate malt and minimal hop contribution. For chocoholics like me, though, this makes for a wonderful dessert beer."
""
"11.2 oz. bottle. Pours dark brown with long lasting, creamy, beige head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of toasted, bready malt, coffee and some dark fruit.  Body is medium and smooth.  Toasted malt, bread crust, dark fruit, herbal hops, coffee and double chocolate fill the mouth.  Finish is long and dry.  Tasty brew."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.08) : I'm glad I bought this and if they stock more, I'll go back again. This is a nice, potent, lovely aromatic and full-flavored stout. There's not a whole lot of chocolate like the name suggests, but it's a damn good beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice and smooth and a great milk stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"However, this stuff is foulness personified. People can moon on about the composition and characteristics but what matters is the taste. This beer should be poured down the drain. You couldn't pay me to drink this crap."
""
"Harmonized with bonbon milk. Appearance: black, opaque, no foam perhaps be stupidly cold; Aroma: very light chocolate, roasting; Taste: I felt more chocolate in the aroma than in the flavor, but helped enhance harmonization, hops this full bodied. With the chill last night fell well!"
""
""
""
"Very nice chocolate and coffee aromas. Pours black with tan head. Medium to heavy bitter taste. Full bodied with creamy texture, soft carbonation, and bitter finish. Pretty good, but slightly to bitter for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has smokey taste with chocolate notes.  Very smooth finish.  Very much a dark beer."
""
"O: 4.3 - You get what you pay for with this beer. You buy this expecting chocolate and that's exactly what you get. Very tasty beer that I think mostly anybody could enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: a tasty beer with a subpar mouthfeel"
""
""
""
"Was told I had to try this, so here it is. Pours a light black, unable to see through. Nice tan head that holds on for a long time. Aroma is of light barley and hot chocolate. Taste seems a little watery, but overall, a good flavor with highlights of milk chocolate and a hint of bitterness. Nice and crispy and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Almost tastes like an actual cup of bittersweet hot chocolate with some marshmallows. Nice brew but anything that could be drunk in multiples. Glad I tasted"
""
"This is a well crafted and absolutely beautiful beer, and I appreciate the low-ABV, but I was definitely expecting more of a dessert stout with this name. Actually, it might make a much better breakfast stout."
""

""
""

""

"Awesome flavor and full bodied.  Goes great with a splash of Kahlua or other Coffee liqueur."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice, malty stout with just a touch of bitterness. Despite the big nose and roasted malt flavor, the beer is relatively light and easy drinking. The beer reminds me, a little, of a German Doppelbock."
""
"revisiting this beer after about a year still one of the finest , stouts on the market, the double chocolate in name is a little misleading, chocolate is natural and faint. much better in the Nitro can ,than in the bottle. Just picked up a case yesterday and the only flaw in this case is, that they tend to disappear fast than any other beer I buy."

"I had this sitting in my fridge for 5 days while I went out of town. While I am impressed with this beer , I may have hyped it up a little in my own head, maybe a touch let down. Don't get me wrong, this is a very nice beer. There is a little aroma of chocolate but man does it ever come out in the tasting. I also probably served it too cold; I really should set up a dedicated beer fridge. Even still, the aroma only intensified mildly as it warmed. Was not overly sweet and was certainly indulgent, just as the label claims. Would make an excellent dessert beer. I also think that it would be a fantastic beer on nitrogen, just to amplify the creamy texture they were trying to achieve. Overall I was very happy with this superb beer."

"Youngs double chocolate stout surprised me in a very pleasant way! The appearance is that of a dark stout. Smell is roasted malts with very strong scent of a bittersweet chocolate. Taste is by far the best part, with bittersweet bakers chocolate coming up front along with the malt, with a slightly bitter hit at the end. The chocolate stays with you throughout the entire experience. Excellent beer for desert or with a hearty meal."

"This is quite possibly the best sweet stout I've ever tried and I give it very high marks. It is hands down the best chocolate beer I've tried. Purchased as part of a four pack of 440 ml cans for right around 9-something. I want to pass on some kudos to Hennessey Market in Butte, Montana for bringing more variety in all good things, most especially in beer. Cheerio!"

"Pours a super dark black color with a light cream colored head. Leaves a nice thick lacing on the glass. The smell is awesome, very sweet and chocolaty. Taste is very good. I taste lots of rich dark malts with the chocolate flavor really coming thru in this brew. Easy drinking and full flavored. A well balanced brew. One of my favorites."

"Pours a pitch black in color with a good 1+ finger beige head that stays around for a bit. Lots of lacing is seen with each sip and clings to the sides of the glass in layers. The aroma is very nice of chocolate (cocoa powder) and roasted malts. The taste is even better with LOTS of good chocolate flavor flowed up by the roasted malts flavor Very smooth and easy to drink. A really great brew overall."

"Pours pitch black with brown, thick foamy head. The lacing on the side of the glass never goes away, like it is stuck there. Aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malts and perhaps some black licorice. Thick, roasted, malty taste. I can definitely discern the dark chocolate and perhaps some raisins. Very smooth, thick taste, almost like a milkshake but not sweet. Slight bitterness at the end. This is my first foray into milk stouts. It definitely doesn't disappoint. The beer is more filling than any IPA I have had."

"Dark chocolate clearly dominates the profile in this luscious, silky brew with some herbal, coffee and spicy undertones poking through. Palate wise the beer feels very 'clean' even if some Diacetyl can be detected (denouncing its British pedigree). Overall this beer feels and drinks like a classically British, complex stout. It's biggest flaw is its lack of any real wowing factor or unique spin to set it apart of the other great stouts of the world."
"Heard good things about this one... Looks good, smells good and has a pretty decent taste... A little light on the foam and carbonation though... My only problem with this one is the somewhat flat mouthfeel-- I personally believe that a beer that walks and talks like a stout should have a little more presence than this. Still, pretty good though."

"Overall - Solid brew, more of an oatmeal stout than a """double chocolate""". If it were more chocolate rich it would be a best-in-class brew for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, you win some and you lose some. With this one, I lost. Very disappointed. With a name double chocolate, I was expecting a real deep chocolate taste. Won't be picking up another one of these any time soon."

"O: A drinkable beer but not my favorite of this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Falls a little short of the """pure luxury""" promised on the label, but a drinkable enough chocolatish stout. Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate Stout is superior, and in the same price range."

"Wow. Creeping through one of my local LQ stores to find...How didn't I know about this before? An average stout ive had before but wait is that a NITRO can? Different beer altogether on NITRO. Dark rich color, Creamy mocha head, smooooth, creamy, dry, chocolate, not to much but just enough, to smooth.... Have 3. I did just before I reviewed this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a big fan of English style beers, always kind of watery and lacking a fuller flavor to me. It is well made and easy to drink but I prefer a little more heft to my stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Smooth, smooth, smooth. Creamy and with just enough sweetness, this is a good stout. I’m not sure about the addition of mineral water though, as the minerality can be distracting. Just a bit more body and more full flavor and this beer would be fantastic, but as it is, it’s just pretty good."
""
""
"O: Good overall. I like it, but I don't love it."
""
"Overall: This beer is not overly complex, but it is very enjoyable. There is nothing objectionable about it. Some people hate on nitrogen being used in place of CO2 when serving beer, but I am not one of them. I think it serves relatively straightforward stouts like this one very well, by adding an extra dimension to them. Obviously not quite on par with a good milk stout served via nitro tap, but as good as one could expect. I won't hesitate to enjoy this one again."
"O – I like this beer and I’d buy it more often at the right price. However for this to be a beer which really blows me away it would need to have a sweeter aspect, more intense flavour, heavier body to balance the smoothness of the carbonation which all in all would probably also involve a higher abv. A beer which I definitely recommend trying as it represents a more unusual style (milk/sweet stout) and format (nitrous can). Nice."
""
""
""
"Otherwise it is still a good mild stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I know this is a classic, but I was slightly underwhelmed. I wouldn't turn one down if offered though."

""

"O: It may be fairly commonplace, but this beer is delicious and a great example of the style."

"overall - love it. always a treat. great dessert beer. my girlfriend has made brownies with this beer and those are also awesome, i would recommend it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Huge head that lasts a couple of minutes. Nice dark color. Bits of dark particles came out of the bottle at the end of the pour. Not much chocolate taste or smell at all compared to Smith's. However this is a very drinkable beer and I could have easily had 2 or 3 of these without any fatigue. The lack of any real chocolate taste or sweetness was the only letdown for me. The label was right when they say that this beer is not meant to be overly sweet. Was not sweet at all. More of a coffee beer than chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid stout by any standards. Recommended."
""
"The legendary Young's Double Chocolate Stout has always been a favorite of mine. It pours pitch black with little to no head, but I had it in a bottle and not the draft can which would give it a nice creamy head. There is a chocolate aroma and a taste almost of chocolate milk but with a slight bitterness in the end. The bitterness lingers on the palate to give it a dark chocolate finish and keep it from being overly sweet. The bottle is not as creamy as on draft or out of the draft can, but it is still a great beer."

"Had this award winning beer at my local craft beer bar. Pours a solid black color with a thick mocha head. No carbonation detected. Head sticks around for a few minutes and leaves good lacing all around the glass. Smell is of course chocolate and malt. The first taste is like an explosion of chocolate flavors. Really has that gourmet dark chocolate balance of sweet and bitter. Leaves a sweet bitterness lingering on my tung to savor. Really enjoyed this beer and if anyone thinks chocolate and beer don't mix, Young's will prove it does."
"Overall: I have enjoyed this beer a bunch over the years. Smooth and delicious."

"Maybe try a stout float??"

""
""
""
""
""
"O- Ive only had a few chocolate stouts, but this one so far was the best. It was in a bottle dated 10-12 and this is 10-13, maybe the extra ageing added to the balance and flavor, because I did not notice any bite or alcohol burn, and It had quite a chocolate character. Quite good and will be going back to see if I can snatch up some more of the """12""" year. Excellent desert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very average. Aroma promised something that the flavor couldn't deliver."
""
""
"O - this is the beer that got me hooked on stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-What a nice dessert beer. It is sweet, but not syrupy or sugary, and the double chocolate is similarly dry and milky, without verging into bitterness or coffee flavors. This is not some massively complicated barrel aged monster, but it is a pretty delicious and easy-to-drink beer. This would pair well with more chocolate or other dessert foods."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Wow - finally got to try this and it is a must have."
""
""
""

""
""
""
"Overall: Not what I was expecting, but not in a good way. I was hoping for a choco beer and turned out with a normal stout. Not bad, but I feel like it is almost incorrectly labeled. I will try not to let my disappointment affect the scores too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An old favorite from time spent in England, this is first time I've had this from a can. Seems less chocolately than I remember it being on tap at The King's Arms in Oxford, but still an enjoyable and easily drinkable sweet stout."
"O- Youngs Double Chocolate Stout joins a short list of my go-to stouts that I would encourage people to try. An excellent beer that will be in the front of my mind until I come across something better."
"Huge difference in taste and body between bottle, can and draft. Draft by far the best, followed a ways back by bottle, and the can was outright nasty. Not sure that many more words are necessary. Most reviews ramble on and seems like most people just want to hear themselves babble. Get to the point."

"young's such a beautiful beer with its frothy mocha head. prevalent chocolate notes are a trait i value in stouts. unfortunately, the body of this stout is too thin, almost watery, and always leaves me wanting more. an above average milk stout that remains a sentimental favorite."
""
""
"I love Youngs now Wells and Young. My first truly English Beer. Pours beautiful foamy head that never stops. Looks like a geyser. Heavy mouthful, smell cocoa, taste cocoa with a hint of coffee. It is very sweet, I wonder if there is some lactose in it. A typical English Sweet Stout, one of the first English brews. It holds a soft spot in my heart."
""
"This is my perfect beer. Dark rich beer that carbonates to a full rich head which delivers a strong and rich aroma of a proper stout. Its appearance also delivers on taste. A rich stout with a subtle chocolate taste if not also coffee. I have introduced many to this beer and have never had any complaints. Some have said upon their first taste that they usually don't like dark beers but particularly like this one."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - very enjoyable beer that I would come back to again and again. Had this as a dessert some time after eating Chinese hot pot and it proved to be a nice contrast to the spice I had earlier."

"This is just an okay beer. Definitely wouldn't buy again. I guess I could drink it again if offered. Again, nothing special."
"Overall- Above average milk stout. Nothing that amazes but still a highly drinkable beer. Give it a try; just don't expect a whole lot of chocolate- it simply isn't there."
""
""
""
"O: A change of pace, but was wanting more from a stout. The lack of any head made it look like flat Coke. Not bad, but found myself wanting more complexity."
""
"Overall: A fantastic winter beer or surprisingly enough an excellent evening summer beer. Fantastic if paired with heavy pasta dishes."
""
"taste was excellent - the dark chocolate really stood out with great balance overall and not too sweet as some stouts in this category can be"
""
""
""
"It was smooth with a great texture, color and feel. It was perfectly """stout.""" The chocolate flavors blend nicely. It's a milk stout, so it's creamy and kinda sweet. A perfect after dinner beverage."
""
""
"This milk stout was awesome. I am a chocolate fiend and really enjoyed this beer. The smell was excellent and full of coffee, caramel and chocolate. Not as much chocolate as I anticipated though. The pour was extremely smooth and the consistency was thick. The color was very dark, almost black with virtually no head. The flavor was great, again not as much chocolate as I would have liked but great none the less. It is not very strong but great flavor with great consistency."

"Double Chocolate Stout pours a black color with a large lacing tan head. There is a slight roasted and malty aroma, but rather weak. The taste is strong with chocolate flavors, very creamy and some roasted malt flavors make it through as well. Nice and creamy, just a tad on the watery side. Overall a very nice chocolate stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- very eay to drink, not overly bitter, would make a great compliment to dessert but does just find on its own. This one is a classic"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The chocolate pairs well with the stout base. The touchstone of chocolate stouts and one that sports wonderful chocolate notes without being overly sweet."
""
""
"T: The chocolate stout that sets the standard for others. I highly recommend trying this from the nitro-tap if you get the chance. Seems even silkier than I remember from the can or bottle."
"Aromas and flavors make you feel like the beer should be sweet. While there is some residual sugar in the beer, the light hop bitterness balances nicely against the richness of the beer and keeps everything clean."

"550ml can. Pours a rich thick black with a medium beige head. Has very good head retention and lacing that last throughout. Aroma of dark chocolate malt some caramel. Taste is sweet dark chocolate malt some mild roasty flavor with light bitterness. Palate is a full rich creamy, slightly oily mouth feel, mild carbonation. Has a nice dark chocolate malt. mild roasty lightly bitter ending. A very rich, creamy and flavorful brew, very enjoyable."
""
""
"O: My Favorite beer"
""
""
""
"Overall: I was disappointed to be honest, but my expectations were high. It is not a bad stout, that is for sure, however it falls short of the mark in too many areas. The aroma isn't nearly strong enough, the chocolate taste isn't nearly prominent enough, there is not enough sweetness for a sweet-stout, the body was too thin, and subtle but weird harsh aftertaste. As mentioned by a few other less-than-positive reviews, maybe it was just an old bottle?"
""
""
""
"I love the chocolate in the smell, but the taste just doesn't follow up on it. I think it's a good stout... just not great."
""
""
""
""
""

"I recommend it like a Mack 10 back yard boogy. Yep!"

"O-good tasting chocolate stout, smooth to sip and la ABV"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a great beer when had in the proper format- I'd highly recommend the nitro-can, as it's an entirely different brew (seemingly) in this format. The beer is drinkable and finishes with a curious bitterness and almost a pinch of red-wine like acidity, which really round out the complexities and make it an intriguing drinking experience with each sip. Would highly recommend, especially on nitro."

"Overall: Would love to try this on tap. Great chocolate stout."

"Not sure if there was something wrong with the bottle since I had this one on tap before on London, but the bottle was definitely a disappointment."

"O--I loved this beer. I wasnt expecting what I got and I wish I had bought more. Not a beer for a long session, but would be great with a piece of cake or a brownie for dessert."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is rich with baking chocolate and smoke. Mild bitterness toward the end but the chocolate lingers on as well. This is the definition of a chocolate stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is extremely well-made and one that is going to be hard to resist when shopping at the store. Give it's availability, I can only think that this is consistent on a regular basis. Don't pass up for as long as I did!"

""

"O: Reminds me of a much more flavorful Guinness in a nitro-can. Not a huge fan of nitro infused beers because it takes away from the flavor. However Wells & Young's made this work. I won't rush to seek this out again but would recommend it to someone that is on the fence about stouts."

"I was excited at first, but the taste brought my hopes down, and the feel dashed them. I could probably drop my numbers more, but the look and the smell were both quite impressive."

"O- Pretty good, would be as nice after meal drink. Not complex but its a straight forward milk stout and its right where it should be. If your looking for it to stand out big time than you might be disappointed."

"Young's Double Chocolate Stout pours out a dark brown with small tan head. Has wonderful roasted malts and chocolate aromas with a thin mouth-feel and sweet taste mixed with dark chocolates. In comparison to other Stouts from the UK it gives off similar complexities with that of Samuel Smith Oatmeal and Imperial stout. Note that there is a difference from the cans and bottles. The Nitro-Cans have less bold flavor and more creaminess that works as a session beer. The Bottle has bolder flavor that puts it back in the big leagues. So in short, if there was a scale of 1 out of 10 I'd put the bottles at a strong 8 or 8 1/2 and the cans at a solid 7."
""
""
""
""
"O - While the flavor wasn't quite as robust as I hoped, I'd love to re-review this in its bottle form. Maybe the nitro stole a bit of the flavor's thunder...I feel like there was a potential here that was somehow cut short. All in all though, very good indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Rich, malty chocolate and a dry graham cracker taste meld well. Hints of coffee help to make a delightful after dinner drink. The feel needs to be slightly more thick and viscous to make this a true post supper sipper."

"This is the real deal and a treat any time!"

Feels like an indulgence when I drink it (truthfully I have no idea if it has any more calories than any other dark beer, but it feels like it... but then if I was watching calories, I wouldn't be drinking a Double Chocolate Stout to begin with)."

"This beer is completely opaque and black. Smells like a nice marriage of dark chocolate and ale. This beer transcends the chocolate stereotype of a sweet chocolate milk """beer""" and offers something truly unique which is an almost marriage of great chocolate taste with a quality ale. This isn't your kids' chocolate stout. Notes of smoked roasted dark chocolate. The chocolate malt definitely plays a center role. This beer sets the bar for a chocolate beer."

"Lighter medium body, well carbonated, sticky and lightly creamy on the tongue. Well-priced, well made benchmark for the milk stout without sending anyone into diabetic shock with cloying sweetness. I should remember how tasty this is more often."

"Dark, dark brown pour, almost pitch black but not quite. Produces a medium mocha colored head about 1 finger high that doesn't last long but leaves some nice patchy lacing. Outstanding aroma, semi-sweet chocolate with just the right hint of coffee. Takes a moment for the carbonation to settle before the taste of chocolate hits the palate followed by burnt toast with little bitterness on the end. Medium bodied. An excellent stout."

"Pours seal brown with a healthy mocha head. A decent amount of patchy lacing clings to the glass as the beer recedes. Aroma smells of both dark and milk chocolate. I don't know if my senses were just quick to acclimate, but the aroma doesn't seem nearly as present in the glass as it did right from the bottle. The front end brings a heavy dose of roast with dark chocolate. Milk chocolate steps up in the middle and lingers into the finish. A roasty haze lingers well after. Just enough hops are present to lend some balance. There's also a touch of alcoholic warmth that exceeds what its pedestrian ABV would suggest, giving this brew a bigger character than it would otherwise have. Mouthfeel is just right for the style and complements the flavor profile nicely. Warming certainly does this beer a favor, as the roasted chocolate elements become deeper and more present. Overall, Young's is a very solid chocolate beer that offers some depth and never becomes cloying. Certainly worth having again."

"O- A decent and drinkable stout, but not as much chocolate flavor as the name would indicate."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A really tasty beer. Pretty hard to set down for too long, has a good offsetting bitterness to avoid the sugars taking over. Chocolate is somewhat of a complimenting flavour rather than the whole beer itself. Works pretty well, certainly interesting."

"O – This is a really tasty beer. I’m not usually a fan of milk stouts as I tend to think that they’re too sweet and one-dimensional, but this one just seems to work very well. For once, I’m not scrambling to try to find more in an aroma and taste than chocolate milk. I’ve been sleeping on this beer for too long. This is a really nice and sessionable stout."

""

"Yum! Great beer. Poured from 500ml bottle. Nice appearance! Descent head retention. Nice roasted malt aroma. Great taste, chocolate, roasted malts. Fantatic moutfeel, smooth, full, velvet, almost creamy. Quite impressed with this stout. Enjoed te maestic look of bottle as well."
""
"O: Overall it is a good beer. It is a little monotone but still a good beer. Also, a little too carbonated feeling for me. I would definitely like to see and taste the difference in the can."

""
""

"This is a great beer, and one of my favorites. I give it a slightly lower grade simply because as a Milk/Sweet Stout it has more chocolate to it than the guidelines specify, and not enough of the dark, roasted malt character that this style should have. Still, this is a fantastic beer."

"O - smooth and rich, sweetness is perfectly subtle, a very good stout"

"Not wowed by this but it is a solid dessert/nightcap kind of beer that will find its way into my fridge from time to time. For a taste of heaven, try it fused with Wells Banana Bread beer. Offered at Doherty's here in RI."

"The beer pours a murky milk chocolate, with sheets of fine bubbles cascading up the glass and slowly turning the beer from a milk chocolate color to a more proper fine black, almost like the black of a tuxedo. The head appears on the beer at a good finger and a half width, and has no intentions of leaving. It is also the most uniform and beautiful head I have ever seen on a beer, with deep tan coloring, and a creamy, buttery texture, this beer is a looker, and most certainly a beauty in a glass. Lacing is thick, creamy, and sheet-like, covering entire portions of my glass. On the nose, the beer smells sweet and roasty, almost like a well milked mocha coffee. Roasted nuts play beside (what I assume are) lactic sugars and sweet milk chocolate, and caress the nose beautifully. The sugar does dominate the light roast, but they play together perfectly. The beer tastes surprisingly light, beginning sweet with light cloying lactic sugars before pulling strong milk chocolate as the beer opens and eventually turns to dark chocolate, black coffee bitters, and a wonderful hazelnutty taste that marries the flavors perfectly. The aftertaste is of French roast coffee and light chocolate. My only complaint with the taste is that it tastes almost watery at the beginning before the flavors build, and this does sometimes sit on the tongue beneath the flavors as you sip. On the mouth the beer feels medium to light in body, and creamy, with no carbonation on the tongue. The nitrogen nicely creates a satiny blanket with this beer, but it does suffer from being a little too thin. Overall this is a tremendous English Stout, with superb flavors of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, hazelnut, sugar, and everything else. It is highly worth trying, and though it suffers in score due to its initial weakness in body and flavor, it is a superb beer and a wonderful example of the style. My favorite chocolate beer so far, though Rogue’s Chocolate Stout does give it a run for its money. Try this beer!"
""
"O - Overall, this beer would be hit or miss with most people. It's unlike any stout that I have ever had, And I'd have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was very pleased with this stout. It flows smooth as glass, has just the right amount of complexity, and stays on the tongue just long enough to remind you it is a stout, but it never seems to overpower itself. I would most certainly buy again, and I think it would be fantastic paired with perhaps spicy Italian food."

"This is one of my favorite nostalgic beers. Had this at a bar in sommerville after a day full of drinking. It was my last beer of the night and I fell in love. I think I named it dessert beer! It came in a can poured it into a glass. creamy rich flavor.. a little foamy.. full flavor. To me it had notes of a chocolate espresso it reminded me of having a piece of tiramisu. yum! have it as a romantic dessert beer cant go wrong ;)"
""
"Surprised when poured into mug. Almost looked like milk at first. Very dark almost black in color. Less carbonated than I thought it would be. Full of chocolate hints and some nutty flavor as well. I really couldn't even taste much alcohol. Very easy to drink. Now, I like these beers, some don't, but if your into a dark stout, I think you will enjoy this. excellent finish. ABV is still 5.2 so they do a bit of a kick but not overwhelming if you have a few. I enjoyed it and would buy again. I would really like to try it on tap. Enjoy!!"
"dark brown, near black in colour, one finger of tan head, good amount of lace here as well. Smell is full of chocolate and roast, some liquorice, coffee with more milky chocolate to end on. Taste is also full of chocolate flavours ranging from bittersweet to lightly sweet milk chocolate, roasty with some coffee flavours, mid palate bitterness, not as sweet as I expected. Medium carbonation, light-medium body. Reall a great chocolate stout, nice amount of flavour with a low ABV that makes this easily drinkable."

"An outstanding example of a heavy stout, packed with chocolate nuances and malt/hop goodness throughout. Ecstasy in every sip!!!"
"Pours deep black with just a bit of red glow around the edges when held up to the light. Nice layer of creamy tan head. Aromas of perked coffee, butter, mild cocoa and sweet cream. Palate is smooth, but a bit on the thin side. Roast and coffee flavors with some burnt toast. A little sour. Chocolate is very subtle up front, but has a growing presense. Some chalky bitterness in the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of the best imported stouts that I have had in a long time. A little watery, but still has a nice thickness to it. Far superior to a nitro-can, but no where near as its tap brethren. Would buy in the future."
""
""
"Nice contrast between the creamy head and dark body. Nice chocolatey smell. Otherwise, nothing special at all about this over rated stout. The taste is thin and bitter and the mouthfeel is watery, especially for a stout. The chocolate barely comes through, and then only as a bitter top note. Meh."
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly light beer, smooth, creamy with brisk carbonation. Not as much chocolate as one would expect but rather a nice balancing bitterness. This is actually a pretty nice tasting stout with nice roastiness incredible drinkability and awesome bitter balance. Just the right touch of sweetness I'm even getting a touch of smoke or oak. This beer not all reins supreme in the sweet stout category, but is an awesome stout in the stout universe."

"A wonderful tasting beer and one that came rather out of the blue, I picked this up at the last second leaving the shop a few weeks ago and it turned out to be a lot better than I was expecting. It was bursting with flavour and had great balance. This one turned out to be on of the better stout I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
"I got a 22oz glass of this at Hollywood Stadium inside Hollywood Casino in Joliet, IL. This pours as black as can be with a light brown head. It smells of robust malts and sweet chocolate. The texture is like most English beers, very light and full of air to the point it drinks lighter than water. The taste of course is full, complex, sweet, and robust. This beer is quite renowned, but I would like it better if it had a little heavier texture to it. Drinks smooth and finishes with a slightly chalky after taste."
"Overall, one of my favorite beers that is widely available."
""
""
""
"O- The chocolate is such a good flavor in this. Minus the booze of the nose and with a touch more body and bubbles this could be a perfect beer. Makes for a very nice dessert as is though."
"O - 4.0 - Between the char-forwardness, the not-very-sweet chocolate note, and the thin chalky crispness, this is a totally different beer than the thicker, round, mild, sweet chocolate confection I was expecting from and English beer called a double chocolate stout. I'm glad it turned out this way instead though. It's a good one, almost sessionable, and full of robust flavor. I'd give it about a 3.9 in the overall category if I could."

"Poured from a bottle into a mug, the beer is a dark, opaque, near-black coloring with a thin, dense, creamy, off-white head that coats the top of the beer and clings to the glass. Aromas of milk chocolate, with a deep roasting in the background and a touch of bitter dark chocolate highlighting. Flavors are rich and deeply roasted, with a light, dry body typical of a Milk stout. Smooth, rich, creamy milk chocolate flavors on the forward tongue are followed rapidly by a touch of bitter, dark cocoa nibs underlying flavor profile. Very dynamic whilst remaining in the realm of chocolate throughout. A hint of coffee/mocha comes in as the transition is being made to the aftertaste on the palate, which is mostly the dark roast and slight bitterness. Smooth, dry finish, with a touch of roast linger. Very tasty and very easy to drink, I have found that this beer does well transitioning newbies into the world of the Stout."

"The only reason I'm reluctant to give it 5's across the board is one that echo's another review from a fellow advocate; It's not that chocolaty....Appearance wise, it's a stout, so it's dark...really dark...but the thin, brown head gives it a pleasant appearance. The smell plays a huge role in the taste of the beer, if that doesn't sound strange, and the taste is very roasted and chicory with a hint of chocolate. Don't get me wrong, it's one of the best stouts I've ever drank, but it's not a double chocolate kind of stout. Very well balanced and delicious though."
""
"O: Good Stout with a load of really dark malts, the chocolate tends to be rather low in the taste, not as sweet and chocolatey as the smell would suggest"
""
""
"Very smooth and silky, not a knockout flavor-wise, but still extremely enjoyable."
""
"The flavor is a little more understated. You get more of the coffee roastiness. I like the way the chocolate is there, but it is not overwhelming. There is very good balance. This is one of the easiest to drink stouts that I have ever had."

"I just bought a bottle of Young's Chocolate Stout from a pharmacy-type store, and poured it at about 30 degrees into my pint glass. The beer has a very pleasant, though not particularly strong, chocolatey smell. It looks pitch-black, like you'd expect. The mouthfeel seems less creamy than you'd might expect (which I like). It tastes great, not too chocolatey. Overall, I'd give this a 4.5 because I think it'd be better with a stronger smell and taste. It's the best stout I've tried thus far (only had around 8-10 brands)."

"Lovely rich tan brown, one finger light cream head that quickly disappears, leaving little lacing. Faint yeast and sweet, meaty smell. Gingery sweet overtones with light carbonation that lasts. Toasted chocolate flavor lingers. Smooth, great beer that holds up well on its own, and accompanying a pork stew."
""
""
""
""
"Came to the table a solid dark brown/black color with a huge tan head that slowly dissipates to sticky lace. Smells of bitter roast, dark chocolate, chocolate syrup, caramel, and earth and minerals. The flavor mimics the aroma quite well with a heavy emphasis on the dark chocolate and chocolate syrup. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy oily mouthfeel. I've had this quite a few times and I'm surprised I haven't rated it before now. I remember more chocolate from the bottle, but I could be mis-remembering. It is good I would drink it again."
"Overall good example of light ABV stout"
""

"Poured from tap in a Guinness pint glass. Poured opaque almost black with brown highlights. Head was foamy, khaki colored and stuck around leaving some fine lacing when it finally went away. Nose was roasted malt, coffee and sugary chocolate. The taste was almost chocolate milk, sweet roasted malts with a touch of bitter hops there for a complement. The mouthfeel was slightly creamy, but lighter than I would have expected; bordered on watery. Overall very good and tasty."

"I can't say I'm all that familiar with 'milk/sweet' stouts, but this seems pretty darn good to me. It pours almost exactly the same colour as Coke, except much thicker. Despite this, it still looks quite good. The head is almost medium brown - quite dark actually. I'm sure anyone can guess what this one smells like - chocolate, plus the normal stout malty goodness. The taste isn't sweet - thank god - but it does definitely have a hint of chocolate, along with a bit of coffee, molasses and malts. Very dry finish. Overall, great beer."

"Poured from a 14.9 oz nitro can, received in a beer of the month six pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, into a 14 oz """pint""" glass. Pours black with a good sized creamy white head. Smells of a normal stout, not as much of a chocolate smell as the name would lead you to believe, but still pleasant. Tastes of a weak stout, but with a chocolate overtone, which is very tasty. Smooth finish for this light bodied beer, perfect carbonation. Overall, above average beer."

"O: A really nice chocolate stout, very rich and tasty, with just enough extra going on to prevent it from being totally straightforward."
"Poured from a nitro can beautifully. The pour is so sexy you can't wait to sample it. It's a jet black with a lighter tan head. The nose is all chocolate, the taste is all chocolate. There's not much more to say than that. It's a fairly regular stout with an extra dose of chocolate combined with some nitro, so the pour and mouth feel are rather creamy."

"440 ml nitro can into imperial pint glass. best by 6/10/2012. Pours almost pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger super creamy light tan head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lasts forever. Thick and soapy lacing all over the glass as you drink. Aromas of big creamy milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, and light coffee. Nice and straightforward aromas with good strength. Taste of big creamy milk chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, slight bitter coffee, light biscuit, and light herbal hop. Almost no bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, and light coffee for a good bit. Great pleasant flavor balance and smoothness. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with an extremely velvety, creamy, and slick mouthfeel as expected for nitro. Alcohol extremely well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a delicious nitro stout. No real complexity present, but it is extremely enjoyable and smooth. Very straightforward tasting as advertised in the name."
"It's definitely a classic example of a milk stout that brings the chocolate."

"Overall – The nitrogen pour fits this beer perfectly and I would always recommend it over the non-nitro version. Great flavors and smooth body make it a great drinking experience. Delicious and smooth. Wonderful!!"
"Overall: Pretty good, but not my favorite. A good way to get a sweet stout fix though, as it is easier to find than most milk/sweet stouts. I feel like nitro is a good application here, even though I can't tell you for sure what it is like without it."

"O - Really solid beer all around, advertised as a double chocolate stout and it delivers as promised"
""
""

"Overall I really liked this beer and I thought it was a very good Milk Stout, it had just enough chocolate flavors to stay true to it's name and the aroma and mouthfeel really put this beer over the top. This beer had really good drinkability, it went down really, smooth, wasn't too filling, and the taste really held my attention, I could drink a few of these in a session without getting bored. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel, they were about as good as gets for this style of beer. What I liked least about this beer was that the flavor wasn't as chocolaty as the aroma was, it wasn't a big deal but if the flavor matched the aroma it would be perfect. I would for sure buy this beer again, it's not too expensive and is a real nice representation of a proper Chocolate Stout. Even if you remotely like Chocolate Stouts this is worth a try and is a true representation of the style. I was really impressed with this beer, I have passed this beer up many times, mainly because it's so available, but after trying it I for sure won't be passing it up again. I think some brewers need to drink this beer to know what a true Chocolate Stout should taste like, lately I have had a few that have not been that chocolaty, when you claim your beer is a Chocolate Stout, the chocolate should be the main focus, and that's exactly what is was with this beer and that's what makes this beer so special. Lately I haven't had great luck with English beers, but this beer broke the trend and reaffirmed to me that there are some great beers coming out of that country. This has to be the best Chocolate Stout I have ever had, a new favorite and it made for a good first impression of this brewery, this may finally inspire me to bite the bullet and try that banana bread beer. Good job guys, this is one great beer."

"A great beer and one of my favorites. Has a great taste, very enjoyable. The beer sounds thick, sweet, and syrupy but it is rather smooth, clean, and medium-bodied."

"I could gush about this thing all day but I should really just not and crack open a new one instead."
"If you like stouts like me, you will love youngs double chocolate stout.. It has the stout part, and doesnt have the coffee like part to it.. Also i have tried many chocolate stouts and they are just too coffee like... Youngs double chocolate stout has great great hints of chocolate and stout nothign else but its not too much chocolate to tolerate.. IF YOU LIKE STOUTS I RECOMMEND THIS ONE ID GIVE IT AN A"

"Poured into a pint glass dark brown/black with the traditional nitro cascade and foam. I don't really get much aroma. It's a very light milk chocolate. Taste is primarily chocolate with a bit of malt. More milky at first then darker as it warms. Medium creamy mouthfeel. Overall nice beer. Somewhat one dimensional, chocolate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thick two finger head on a dark black body with a little light passing through. Nice lacing. Aroma is robust with lots of roasted malt and a nicely represented chocolate aroma. Flavor is similar with a stronger coffee bitterness mostly in the finish. Thickening and thick bodied, one could drink this nonstop with how drinkable this beer is."

"O: As mentioned, I have wonderful memories of this beer and must thank it for assisting in my palate development (thus the perfect score for the overall rating). I even bought a couple of cases of this and had it as a side beer at my wedding back in 2009! A solid beer all-around that is so smooth and well balanced you can't help but enjoy it no matter what time of the year it is."

"Overall a solid milk stout."

"D - Its a really good stout, but I find it to be just too mild to be great. With a little work, it could be world class."
""

"O- Good. It was enjoyable. Glad I tried it, but not something I would rant and rave about."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would recommend this beer to anyone and everyone. Amazing brew and I am ashamed that I had waited to try it."
""
""
"The beer appears dark brown, nearing blackness. The tan head is enormous, encompassing the upper half of the pint glass, leaving a thick sheet of lacing stuck to the walls of the glass. The aroma is pretty straightforward, with chocolate malt leading the way, followed by hints of vanilla. The flavor also delivers a healthy amount of chocolate, as promised. A nice roast character is present throughout, and pleasantly lingers in the finish. The body is pretty thin, bordering on watery. This beer is easy to drink, and well suited for one who enjoys both chocolate and beer. Best is smaller quantities, I enjoy returning to this beer on occasion."

"Overall: A very sweet and tasty beer that I would happily buy again."

"Overall, I found this to be an enjoyable, sessionable stout. I don't think it would be my first chocolate stout choice, but it wouldn't be too far behind in the pack."

"Poured a beautiful inky brown with a thick tan head. Just gorgeous to look at. The scent is subdued chocolate and cocoa and the taste follows the scent. This is more subdued than I would expect given it's appearance with just a hint of coffee. The mouth feel is cream goodness. Overall a very pleasurable experience. Would have rated it higher if the taste match the gorgeous appearance."

"A smooth and solid black appearance with a 4 inch beige head. It's got a strong chocolate milk laced with alcohol aroma which would be a lot nicer if the alcohol level was lowered. Initial taste is of chocolate milk and a healthy dose of alcohol. Some roasted coffee flavor follow and lingers in the after taste. I much prefer the second half of this flavor profile. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied, just as one should expect from a nitro can. Overall, the strong alcohol presence in this one severely limits its potential for me. I know I should like it, everyone else seems to, but I just do not get what everyone else is getting. Had it a couple times and each experience has been the same, whether in the can or om tap."

"3.5 D: Admittedly one of the better nitro beers out there, but it's still a nitro beer and thus the nose and taste take huge hits."
""
""
""
"Not too impressed with the nitro version of this beer. It shines in some areas and lacks in others. Average overall. I look forward to trying the bottled version."
""
""
"Not real sure what everyone sees in this one. If this is double chocolate, im scared to see what the single version is. It honestly tastes like Guinness with double the dark chocolate. Same body, same feel. Really forgot to add the milk part of the milk stout."
""
""
"O: it was what i had expected, chocolate from the nose to the tongue, it was there all the way, right where i wanted it, very nice"
""
""
"Overall a very good chocolate stout. It is chocolate not just in name but in practice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really good beer that isn't super expensive like a lot of premium stouts tend to be. Very solid beer that i'd reccomend to anyone who likes sweet beers."
""
"O-flavors are good and fairly well balanced just not a lot there"
""
""
""
"O: This beer looked fantastic, but the nose and flavor were too mild, and the beer wasn't creamy enough in my opinion. It's a tie between this and Cocoa Loco."
""
""
""
"Overall, I was a little disappointed that this one didn't have more dominant chocolate flavors. The chocolate that was there was very dark and good, just wish there was more of it."

""

"A pretty pour, intriguing and pleasant aroma, decent taste, but then the lack of carbonation and watery finish in the mouthfeel is so drastic it affects the taste."
"If you can get this fresh it is the best Chocolate stout! If you get an old one It's still OK. but with that said I am tried of places over charging or having old ones in stock! If you can find it at a Bev Mo or a grocery store go for it, if it is at a ghetto liquor store please pass. Beer Knowledge."

"O - I have had this before and remember it being better, wonder if I did myself a disservice by getting the nitro can."

"Overall: An excellent stout. Strong flavors with very slight bitterness."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A surprisingly well balanced stout of high quality and fun experimentation. Not as """chocolaty""" as I expected it to be, but definitely a good brew recipe. Any fans of stouts should try this one. Especially since it's nearly seassionable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Likewise, despite the slight changes I note from my impressions of past samplings (and I now see that I've reviewed this on Nitro as well!) it basically hasn't changed: I recall selling several case-loads of this per week at retail, and just because I'm not so impressed with it doesn't mean that others are not!"
"pours jet black into a stout glass with a 2 inch or more tan lacey head. smells heavenly, dark chocolate, sweet roasted malts, and a milk candy creamy feel. flavor is great, very very chocolatey, but not gimmicky. its incorportaed into the beer. the first time i had this i was amazed, because i was expecting a double stout, strong. but what i got was a double chocolate beer, which caught me off guard in a good way. there is also a gentle hop bitterness in the finish which is a nice contrast with the candy sweetness in this beer. mouthfeel is a little thick and syrupy for me, not as carbonated as i usually like in these beers, but i always go back to this. i find it much better in the nitro can than the bottle too."
""
""
""
"Overall: Well put together, easy to drink and above all pretty damn good. Might be little sweet but this isn't a soda, I would better classify it as a lighter porter. Regardless hope you all enjoy, Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is the first time I've had the bottled version of this beer, and the truth is I like it more than the can, which is perfect. This is a perfect holiday stout (I'm reviewing this on Boxing Day) and if you like stouts then this is almost flawless in my opinion. Even the artwork on the label looks like something from Willy Wonka. Amazing."
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice chocolatey stout; maybe better than Rogue Chocolate stout."
"Overall - Very drinkable for a stout and full of nice flavors - this should be a crowd pleaser!"
""
"Pours an almost jet black colour with just a hint of ruby. Thick, dense, two finger head with great retention and lacing. Smells heavily of barley and chocolate. Bit of cream and coffee as well. Tastes heavily of chocolate, some licorice, tad of dairy, and big malt profile. Mouthfeel is thick, dense and creamy. Medium carbonation. Overall a beautiful stout."

"This is a fantastic chocolate/sweet stout and probably the best one I have ever had. I almost always snag a bottle of this when I see it for sale. I always enjoy it and it is consistently delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Watery thinnish body, some creaminess from the nitro, still fairly flavorful though. Hershey kiss milk chocolate, mild coffee with cream and sugar, somewhat sweet though not overly so. Some mellow roastiness, though overall it's a bit flabby and watery. Where's the bitterness, where's the body? Not something i'd revisit, more of a novelty due to the can."

"Overall: Wells & Young Ltd really nailed this style. What a great sessionable stout. I could easily see having a few of these in one sitting. Much better than Guinness in every way. I've had it on nitro-tap, nitro-can and in the bottle. On tap and from the nitro-can is the way to go. Much better than the bottle version. Enjoy..."
"Been drinking this beer forever, and finally decided to sit down and review it. Dark black-brown pour with two finger tan head with decent retention and good lacing. As you would expect, lots of roasty dark chocolate and cocoa in the nose, along with hints of espresso, vanilla and caramel. The taste is much the same with the chocolate definitely the star, but not to the point to where it's too much. The roasted malt becomes even more prominent as it warms, with an almost smokey hint to it. Reminds me when I toured the old Ram Brewery outside of London and they had us taste the roasted barley. The mouthfeel is creamy and thick and oh so smooth. That, coupled with the low ABV, makes this incredibly drinkable. A classic and dependable beer."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is super creamy and is desert like...this would be a good beer to move non-craft drinkers into that direction."
""
""
"Overall - This is a delicious beer, not thick and mouthcoating which makes this highly drinkable and enough roastiness to be refreshing and nearly palate cleansing. The 5.2% ABV also makes this one very sessionable and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a nice blend, quite inoffensive, pretty nice. I'm not a stout fan but this one is alright."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very disappointing. I remember having one of these on tap and enjoying it immensely. And, after pouring this beer and taking a whiff, I thought it would live up to my memories. But the first sip was an immediate letdown, and it didn't get any better. I didn't even bother to finish this one. I'm hoping it was just a bad batch...it wasn't even in my fridge that long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dr: They should just brew a cream ale and be done with it. The emphasis here isn't on the chocolate - contrary to the epithet. Very drinkable but also quite forgettable (at least out of the nitrocan). I won't be purchasing this again."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was very enjoyable. Very smooth and delicious. A good desert beer."
""
""
""
""
"Nice looking pour with a giant head. Classic black and tan. Aroma is a faint smell of chocolate milk. Taste of bitter chocolate powder with coffee tones and chicory. Mineral presence is evident in the hard water metallic aftertaste on the tongue. Mouth is creamy and thin. Overall a decent example of a milk stout. Although this could be sweeter and heavier for the style, It is very drinkable and pretty tasty. Nothing really offensive or outstanding, but a good stout and great value."

"This is a very nice stout with a subtle hint of cocoa flavouring, with prominent notes of malty caramel and coffee. It has a thick, creamy mouth feel and a very slight touch of sweetness. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to friends who wouldn't normally appreciate beer."
""
""
""
"The stout came out in a normal pint glass with a two finger, dense, and medium tan head. It smells of you guessed it! chocolate, some coffee, toffee, and roasted malts. Hops aren't overly present in the overall taste, main tastes are chocolate and coffee. It's a fairly sweet beer with a pretty bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth like it should be. I definitely need to get this again!"
""
"As I'm fairly new to the craft brew world, I'm not as up on my beer """lingo""" as most of the reviewers on this site. Thank you in advance for my unprofessionalism. I do know what smells and tastes good to me. I am a chocoholic and have tried just about every well reviewed chocolate, oatmeal and milk stout on this site. As I understand this is the macro brew of the bunch, sometimes, things are more popular for a reason. This is the case here. This beer is smooth, easy to drink, sweet without being overbearing. The Double Chocolate is certainly not just a market tool. I prefer beers of this style to have low carbonation. I'm not sure if its the nitro can or not, but this is very low carbonation. Has a very cool Guinness cascading effect when poured. Allowing the beer to warm a little does great things for both the taste and smell. Exactly the beer I hoped to find for the style. Nice little bit of dark chocolate and malty bitterness to offset the overwhelming milk chocolate."

"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. While the look and smell are nice on this, the taste and body are lacking. I have had this beer a good amount of times in bottles and this is my first nitro-can, so I am not sure if my memory of this beer is skewed or the different vessel, but I will have to try this again out of a bottle to refresh myself."

"Overall this is a good chocolate stout but not the best I've had. It lacks complexity, just a little boring."
""
" It was wonderful. Like an unsweetened chocolate phosphate. This is what I thought Guinness would taste like the first time I tried it. Holy chocolate cow. This beer is the frickin' bomb. I expect to gain weight exponentially in the near future. Thank you Well's & Young! Fabulous."
"Overall I really like this beer. I nice alternative to guinness when it comes to nitro stouts."
"O: A good beer; does everything well."
"O: Very tasty stout without some of the roasted bitterness seen in other stouts...good choice for someone who may not be totally keen on that type of beer"
"Nitro-can poured into a pint glass. Nitro is a novelty and gives the appearance a boost. Nice black/opaque pour with lots of action leading to a 1 finger tan head. Some lacing remains. Smell is rather mild. Some coffee notes mixed with light chocolate, underwhelming however. Taste is not as strong as I hoped. A bit of watered down chocolate, but smooth. A bit one dimentional. Didn't pick up any malts and just mild milky quality. Feels a bit watery on the tongue as well, wanted more of a creamy/silk feel. Overall- A decent stout that was good, but not great. Needs to be more complex with fuller body and taste. Perhaps the nitro zapped the taste?-"
"I really had no real expectations for this beer, but it was surprisingly good."
"bad can? is it cause of the nitro? i dunno"
"O: The first time I had this drink it tasted as if it had a powdery chocolate taste, baking chocolate. This time around it's still good, but still not great. I won't go out of my way for this drink, but it's still definitely worth trying."
"Pours an enchanting multi-colored, lively celebration of bubbles and foam. Smell is light but relatively inviting, cocoa powder-ish. Taste: cocoa powder, bitter chocolate, touch of alcohol (sucked from inside a liqueured chocolate novelty). Mouthfeel is a little watery; a big letdown from how it looks. Much better as it warms. Good but that wateriness is a huge detractor from its better qualities."
"Pours a dark opaque brown-black with a solid finger of tightly laced foam sitting atop. There’s a sweet chocolaty aroma, obviously, but I’m also picking up something akin to the smell of stale, burnt coffee. If I wasn’t concentrating I would have never noticed it, and it’s not present enough to be off putting, but it’s not the welcoming roasty coffee and espresso notes I associate with a stout, especially one I enjoy so much. Interestingly enough I don’t pick up on the bitter coffee when I drink it, only the chocolate sweetness that’s smooth and sippable, without being overpoweringly strong. Dessert has been poured!"
"Benchmark for chocolate stout."
"I don't think I would order this one again, however I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it. I expected a little more sweetness, but that is my fault not the beer's. Good beer."
"O: A real treat, don't drink many but always enjoy them when I do."
"Stouts are in my top 5 style choices, but Young's isn't going to make my top 5 stouts. It isn't hatable, but not lovable either."
"Final Grade: 3.98, a solid B+."
"Overall: I hadn't had Young's Double Chocolate for almost 2 years up until I had it today. It's easily one of the best stouts out there, and one of the most flavorful."
"Price point - $4.49/16.9oz"
"tastes of milk chocolate & cream. like a milkshake. toasted marshmallow in the aftertaste. creamy and smooth in texture with medium carbonation. medium in thickness."
"Carbonation is light and this beer starts and finishes smooth. Simple, but very enjoyable and very drinkable."
"O: Superior Chocolate Stout! Very smooth and malty."
"Very very dark brown/black colour. About one finger brownish head looks really exciting. Smells like black coffe with milk. Milky chocolate taste at first and slight coffee bitterness aftertaste. After first sip, it is felt like not ordinary beer, at the end of the bottle i felt little tired of that coffee/chocolate tandem. All in all, this ale is great and worth your try on it."
"Overall...This is amazing. You must try this if you haven't yet. It's special."
"Light in body with a nice full flavor of both dark and milk chocolate. Dark roasted malts give it a good baseline for the chocolate malt and dark chocolate flavors to come out and shine. They give it a creamy sweetness that is somehow refreshing in feel. A light touch of coffee or hop bitterness resides in the back and tingles a little, giving it a crisp finish that actually does really well with this style. Creamy in feel, but with a higher carbonation level that increases drinkability, which is very also high for this beer. At 5.2%, it would be extremely easy to knock back a few of these. Very nice little beer, probably will be back for more when I'm in the mood for a good stout."
"O: One of the finest examples in the stout class, in my (not very) humble opinion!"
"O: Although with all the pros it falls slightly flat though, it feels a bit on the basic side. But it's very, very tasty and anybody who enjoys milk stouts will love this one."
"Overall: I wouldn't say it beats the nitro-can (or, if you can get it, the nitro-tap) but it's definitely still got some spunk here."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, average carbonation, but not quite as smooth as I had hoped. Goes down pretty easily. Overall, a nice Milk Stout. Not too sweet like these usually are for me. Very enjoyable to drink on a cool evening."
"Does not have a chocolate scent, more caramel instead. Pours opaque brown/black with good beige head. Laces the glass well. Taste does seem to be a dark bitter chocolate, not overly sweet. Nice bite in the aftertaste. Improves as it warms!"
"Overall an awesome beer for my first stout. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who likes beer, chocolate, or both. I certainly could not drink more than one at a time though."
"This beer is a style benchmark, but will remain only a occasional beer for me."
"My opinion on this beer is it was served way too cold. I've heard nothing but good things about this beer but I think where I was served it must have been on ice? I didn't get much of the aroma and just a hint of the chocolate flavor... it was very smooth and enjoyable but not what I was hoping. I will review again once I let one warm up a bit."
"D - Love the dark chocolate element here, very nicely done. The drinkability is good, and works perfect as a dessert beer. Overall it's a great brew."
"Overall: This is by far the smoothest beer I've had. Personally I would prefer a bit more carbonation. The taste is good, although I definitely prefer the bottle over the can as far as taste goes. The can kicks ass in appearance, smell, and mouthfeel though, so I think the ultimate young's double chocolate stout would be one with the taste of the bottled version combined with the mouthfeel, appearance, and nose of the nitro-can version. Either way you cut it, this is an excellent beer and certainly worthy of a comparison between the versions. I can't believe how different the two beers are--it's hard to believe they are the same beer. I would definitely be interested in trying out this beer on tap/nitro-tap as well to compare with these versions. All in all, a superb brew!"
"If they made a bottle conditioned version I would be in heaven and probably buy my dad a case."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and velvety smooth but always a bit odd coming out of a nitro-can. Overall, Youngs is always a good treat to have every once in a while. Nothing fancy here but solid nonetheless."
"O: It wasn't as sweet as I initially thought it would be, but in spite of not meeting my expectations in this aspect, it was still a very good stout that I will certainly revisit again."
"Thin body. I would like this to be a bit thicker and sweeter with more flavor. Overall though, it's a decent beer."
"O: As chocolatey a beer as you'll find this side of Choklat; however this beer showcases the dark, roasty, bitter side of chocolate and isn't ad sweet as other chocolate stouts. A good beer overall, though I'm not a fan of the nitro."
"Overall this is a textbook beer on this style: every so-called beer drinker should taste it to see what a sweet/milk stout is supposed to be: light, drinkable, creamy, with lots of flavor and balance."
"This beer pours a really dark brown color. It has 2-figners of light-tan head resting on top. The retention is so good that I could go to sleep, wake up in the morning, and it would still be there. It looks like a wonderful layer of cream. The smell has a nice roasted bitterness to it. There are also some chocolate and coffee aromas to it. The taste is roasty and dry. There are flavors of chocolate and coffee flavors just like the nose. The finish is roasty and slightly dry. The mouthfeel is excellent. It has a medium body and good carbonation. It has a super creamy feel to it. It is roasty and a touch dry. This has great drinkability. I could easily down some pints of this. Since the head never goes away and it is so smooth it is like having a layer of cream on top. wonderful. Overall, I enjoyed this much more than I thought I was going to."
"O - Overall, very tasty. I really like this beer and would surely try it again if given the opportunity."
"overall, I had read such great reviews on this brew and I was a little underwhelmed. not a real complex or bold beer. drinkability was high, but wouldnt go out of my way to pick it up."
"in my opinion there are better offerings out there but overall this was still pretty good."
"O - a very to the point chocolate stout that touches on all the flavour elements you would expect, a must for stout fans"
"A decent chocolate stout, but there's certainly far better examples readily available. I have no desire to drink this again."
"Couldn't tell you where I first had this, but I've had it in the nitro-can and on tap at various venues. Pours...like a good stout: a creamy, opaque black, cascading bubbles culminate in a solid beige head. Aroma of chocolate milk with some coffee notes. Taste is, well, look, it's not gonna taste exactly like chocolate milk as the name might imply. But it's still very smooth and chocolatey, with notes of coffee bitterness. Not much in the hop department of course, just lots of chocolate, malts, and roastiness. On the heavier side of medium-bodied, and not only drinkable, but also good for making car-bomb cupcakes (with Bailey's icing of course)."
"O- One of my favorite stouts. Very easy to drink, and very easy to find. I would of course highly recommend it."
"Overall: Good stout. Lacked complexity that I enjoy. I am fairly certain I sampled this before on tap while travelling in Atlanta and I remember it having a much fuller body than what I experienced from the bottle. The bottle was good, but my hopes were higher. Very enjoyable chocolate flavors that I'd definitely go for again."
"Overall: I really have not developed a taste for this style yet much to my own frustration. Though the flavors go deeply and are well balanced, its just not lively enough for me. Whenever I return to giving milk stouts another go, I'll pick up a bottle or two of these for sure."
"Pours a really dark brown w/ a one finger cocoa head that quickly disappears. Average carbonation and lacing. Beer is incredibly dark, almost black- impossible to see through. Nose is chocolate, malt, coffee, and some hops in the background. Nose is fairly weak, and somewhat thin. I'd like it to be a little more present. Taste is lighter, but a really nice chocolate/malt/sweet/bitter combo happening. Zero alcohol noticeable when drinking. Feel is really silky smooth w/ some hops in the background. Fairly low carbonation and medium bodied, medium malt feel. Fairly dry finish as well. Overall, this is totally solid for the style. Enjoyable. Good session beer, and recommended if you like the style. Cheers!"
"Pours a dark cola like color with a three finger creamy chocolate milk looking head which gives way to gobs and rings of lace all over the glass. The aroma is of milk chocolate and sweet malts. The tatse is of milk chocolate and some sweet malt flaovrs. The end has a coffee and roasty taste. The mouthfeel is sliky and creamy a very nice feel. Overall this is a great beer, the aroma is inviting and the flavor is big and bold. This is an easy drink and a flavor that leaves you wanting more."
"O: Smooth chocolate ale. Definitely worth trying. I highly recommend it at least once."
"O: This is a pretty good chocolate stout, but I've had better. Still, I don't regret buying, but as far as buying again, things like peche mortel and southern tier choklat/mokah or others are better choices. Wouldn't refuse if offered, though."
"Rich and flavoursome. Plenty of dark flavours going on, with the chocolate blending nicely into the mix. I sort of expected it to dominate the flavour profile, but it matches the overall character well. The only quibble is a slightly insubstantial body, but a solid effort nonetheless. Tasty and well worth sampling."
"Overall a very good desert beer. a must try!!!"
"D"
"O- IMO, the best chocolate stout I've had, with plenty of cocoa flavors, good sweetness, a creamy texture, and a superb dark chocolate finish."
"O – This needs to be paired with a sweet dessert as it is not as sweet as I anticipated, drinkable and a beer I will have again, good but not exceptional to me 4"
"Haven't tried making a Black and Tan with it yet."
"O: I can see why this is such a classic. Nothing over the top, just a well done staple of a beer. I may have done myself in trying this on nitro first, it may be a little plain from the can; I guess I'll have to find out."
"4, 4, 4, 3.5, 4"
"UPDATE 8/27/11: I would not suggest the nitro-can. It some how mutes the flavor of the beer to a point where it is like a watery stout. I hoped it to make the beer even more creamy, however it made the beer lackluster."
"Medium to full bodied with creamy carbonation, this beer will always be one of the most drinkable stouts on the market. The body has a good thickness to it but is not sticky or coating in the least. The carbonation is not fizzy at all (except for the foam from the head that sticks to my upper lip) and gives the beer an excellent creamy, easy-drinking mouthfeel. Young's Double Chocolate Stout is like drinking 5.2% ABV chocolate milk."
"Overall: This is a decent brew but the chocolate needs to be a lot stronger. This is ok but if I really want a chocolate forward beer I would go with Rogue's Chocolate Stout or Southern Tier's Choklat. I would be interested to try this out of a bottle to compare."
"Pours black with about an inch and a half of frothy, foamy, cream/brown head. Smells of chocolate, caramel, a bit of roasted malt, and a touch of vanilla. Taste is rather thin, consisting of chocolate, malt, some grain, caramel, and water. Mouthfeel is thinner than I remember, and seems thinner than many other nitrogenated stouts. It finishes sweet and dry. Overall, a decent stout for a nice change of pace from the typical offerings."
"Also, the mouth feel could use some fine tuning. Other than that, feel lucky to be able to try such a wonderful beer. And one more thing, let this baby warm to almost room temperature. You will not regret it."
"overall - perhaps a bit more subtle on the nitro, very drinkable and certianly not a bad beer, but its likely my last time knocking at young's door."
"D: without a doubt, an A+ beer in my opinion. from the initial pour, the appearance, smell, and certainly the flavor/mouthfeel a great brew. best milk/sweet stout ive had to date and what beers of this style should strive for. i do give credit to the nitro, and if i were them i would only serve it on nitro taps or in nitro cans. makes the beer what it should be."
"O: I can definitely see myself coming back to this beer. It's classically delicious, with more than enough complexity to satisfy me in many different situations. This is what I think of when I imagine a traditional English pub beer: smooth, light, and uniquely bitter."
"Overall. Fantastic. Just what I would be going for if I were to create a chocolate stout. Great with desert!"
"The appearance for a novice was very good,exactly what I imagine a stout should look like. Reminded me of when I left motor oil laying around in containers until I could take it to a recycling center. The smell to me was too much. I like chocolate,but to me this was a cheap Kahlua imitation. Very hard to bring this to my lips. Forturnately the taste was much better,a nice balance of sweet and bitterness.If only the odor was different. The bottle date was 3/19/11."
"O - Overall this is a delicious milk stout. While I love the look that nitro gives a beer, I would rather have an average head but some legitimate mouthfeel. Still, would gladly buy again."
"O - Probably the best of this style and a great stout for food. It is an extremely drinakable stout and perfect for a stout drinker looking for something in hot weather and other situations where a heavy stout is not ideal."
"M. Full bodied, this beer is a mouthful. Although carbonation is noted on the glass, it has absolutely no bite. The beer isn't sticky at all, and isn't overly drying either. It is very creamy though."
"O: this is a good one, but nothing that gets me going crazy."
"Very chocolatey taste, as one would hope, with a little bit of bittersweet and a little milky sweet, but there are plenty of complexities in the beer to make it fun. Very creamy, thick mouthfeel. A 20oz. of this can go down pretty easily but it's thickness can sink in your stomach pretty well and one is definitely enough."
"M - A little bit too much carbonation for me and a slight watery finish."
"O - Overall a pretty solid beer, I would definitely buy it again. Very drinkable though I'd prefer a little more chocolate considering the name."
"O: I am not a huge fan of brews on nitro, but this one was tasty. A great example of a milk stout."
"Chocolate aroma is present and seems to dominate, but the roastiness is there, with some minerals. The taste is quite good, perhaps a little loose. I feel the nitro also thins it out a bit. Good dessert beer, or perhaps a beginer beer prior to some stouts"
"O- a delicious stout thats full of flavor. very well crafted"
"Overall this was a pretty good beer. Nothing outstanding and I was hoping for a more full filling beer for a chocolate stout."
"overall- extremely impressed with this beer a good chocolate malt beer, easy to drink, and extremely enjoyable!"
"Overall: A solid example of a Chocolate Stout the right beer for the right mood or perhaps time (dessert)."
"It's possible that this is the first time that I have tried Young's Double Chocolate Stout, which is surprising considering it's the type of beer you can find in a lot of places. Maybe I've been hanging out in to many beer bars that think it isn't exciting enough to have on tap. Whatever the reason I haven't tried this one, I'm glad that I did. Pretty good beer."
"O. A very nice stout and definately up there with the Meantime and Saltaire chocolate creations. A bit disappointed, expected a bit more chocolate for my liking. I have 7 more bottles to get through, perhaps my review will be altered by that time...looking forward to them all!"
"O - Love it. Wouldve been incredible I think with a slice of mudcake and a dollop of ice cream. Pair with a desert and dont drink it too cold."
"O- Perfect for a winters night. Tastes fantastic and highly drinkable. I am truly impressed by this. I suppose the weak mouthfeel is the only discernible hiccup."
"Overall: Like I said before, this is one of my favorites. The body could be a little thicker, but not a lot to complain about. Of course I'll have another."
"Unfortunately the stout is very thin and it left me wanting something with a richer creamier texture to complement the flavor."
"A very delicious stout. I'd like to see how the bottled variety compares to a nitro-can or on tap."
"Cheers"
"Overall this is a different but good take on a chocolate stout with good cocoa and chocolate flavors as the main charactors, a little thin but.... it has sone good points. worth a try."
"O: Out of the bottle this thing is atrocious but from a nitro tap or nitro can it's wonderful. Amazing how good carbonation can save a super thin stout. I'd like a bit more from the flavor and aroma areas but they are no where near bad."
"EDIT: I just tried it in can form again. It's got a widget, so there's a really impressive nitro feel to it. Unfortunately, it does rob a good portion of the flavor. Good, but too watery."
"O- A classic that you can never go wrong with, great for dessert and a good way for me to convince my girlfriend to try some beer."
"One of the ultimate dessert beers on the market today. This beer poured out of the nitro can as a milky brown color that surged into a deep blackish brown color. The head was creamy and thick like a Guinness typically looks. The smell is of some roasted malts and a ton of rich chocolate. The taste is full of chocolate too. The mouthfeel is creamy and very smooth. Overall this beer is kickass when drank at the right time."
"D/O: Very drinkable, surprisingly well even on a hot summer day. Overall, this beer doesn't """punch you in the mouth""" like some stouts but is just super sweet and simple. Genuinely enjoyable."
"D: An excellent stout characterised, but not dominated, by its nuanced chocolate flavour without it feeling too sweet or like a novelty. Quite drinkable despite the full body, it's a twist on the usual meal-in-a-bottle stout: instead, it's dessert."
"This pours a black color with a light brown finger width thick head with tiny nitro induced bubbles. The smell is of roasted malts and chocolate, the smell is pretty mellow though. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy as expected from the nitro can. The taste is more watery that I remember (an effect of the nitro can or the past best date beer?). The main taste is of chocolate and roasted malts with a smoked / chocolate after flavor with a slight bitterness which lingers for a while. This out of a can is smoother and more session like than I remember from the bottle but its also more subdued and not as tasty. I'll stick to the bottles from now on. (I'll also edit my can review at a later date when I get a fresher can)"
"Overall, very good. I almost feel like its a snack, rather than a drink."
"A very tasty treat, and easily among the best couple of chocolate brews I've ever had (right next to Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout)."
"Overall - You really can't go wrong with this Choco Stout. It might just be the best one I've ever had. Pardon me, but I have to go and finish my glass..."
"O=I enjoyed both, but the first one was much more flavorful than the second. Will probably buy again after this 4-pack, which I will test for black and tans."
"O: Really well crafted brew, I can see why this remains firmly in the beers of fame list. Really nice beer."
"I haven't had this one in a while but I'm impressed. Seems to lean more towards coffee than chocolate but still is a damn fine brew."
"Easily sessionable, available everywhere...a great choice for a tasty stout."
"this beer pours a dark brown color with a pillowy off white head head. the smell is slightly slightly roasty and has a hint of sweetness. the flavor is watery and smooth with barely any hints of malt. the mouthfeel is super thin, overall this beer was a pretty big let down compared to how pepople review it."
"Overall: One of the best in it`s style, great chocolate taste but not a sweet beer, excellent balanced."
"Mouthfeel: This is a sweet stout I can say will go over well with any sweet tooth!!"
"O - Not as much noticeable chocolate as I'd expected despite the fact that it's listed in the ingredients! Coffee being the truly dominant force in this beer, not bad regardless."
"Overall this was a pleasure to taste and review. I wouldnt know quite where to rate this on the list of best chocolates out there, but it probably would rate on the upper end of the spectrum. Young's got it right with this one."
"O - What a brew. This is top notch for sure. Great sub-up for Guinness or Muprhys. I'll return often. Another PLEASE!"
"Overall: This is a great beer. I had my reservations- a lot of folks don't like these nitro-cans, but what's not to love? You get the yummy richness of a nitro pour and all the flavor. Plus the alcohol is low and the taste is great so you have an off-the-beaten-path session beer here!"
"Overall, Young's Double Chocolate Stout is nice sessionable stout. One of my go-to beers when I need something that won't put me to bed. The perfect winter day drinking beer. I have mixed it half and half with Wells Banana bread beer, which is an excellent anytime after dinner beverage."
"Nice black color with a small head and spotty lacing. Smell of dark roasty malt and cocoa. Delicious milky chocolate and malt taste. Dark roast, coffee, but not sweet. Mouthfeel is both carbonation and milky. This stout is really good and I drink it often."
"Drinkability/overall- this beer was not quite as good honestly as the last time I had it which i believe was out of the regular bottle and not nitrocanned, i wonder if the non nitro version has bit more flavor despite not as good mouthfeel and such, the beer was quite drinkable but not something I would go to all the time as was just kind of more simple then i remembered, all said and done though this is still pretty nice beer"
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch tan head that fades to a small cap that lasts. Thin legs of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and chocolate syrup in milk. Taste is of roasted malt and chocolate syrup. Mild cocoa bitterness on the palate quickly fades. Due to the nitro-tap this beer is very thick and creamy. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but not one I would get too often. I am glad I got to try this one on nitro-tap."
"Don't get me wrong, I feel that I've had better milk stouts, but very few."
"O: Dominated by chocolate but not overly sweet."
"O - very good chocolate stout - always worried with beer like this - never know of it will be unbalanced due to the unique flavor - but they nailed it here."
"Overall: decent, but not extraordinary. I think this beer is best on tap. The remaining beers from my 4 pack of nitro cans will be reserved for their original purpose; cooking. Cheers!"
"O: I wasn't very impressed with this brew. The flavors were there but they didn't grasp my taste buds and linger like I want a beer like this to. Still ok, but not my favorite."
"SO GOOD"
"D- Very drinkable w/o too high ABV, could have easily had another. plan on drinking this again as it's easy to find on draft and in can/bottle at my WOB. Not so sweet even though its chocolatey."
"Light to medium-bodied, grainy texture. Great drinkability."
"Taste is wonderful. Coffee, chocolate, malt are all present. Mouthfeel is a little watery for a beer this dark, but oh well. After a few beers at a place with a good beer menu, this is a great way to end a night."
"Decent beer, especially considering this is out of the can. Definitely need to let it warm so that the taste can really come through."
"I’ve had this before and simply doesn’t recall it being this good. Maybe it is the larger bottle, maybe this one is fresher, maybe I’ve gone mad. Either way this just really great beer and worth of the praise. 5.2% has simply never been this dark and this good (please read a beer this dark has never better this good at that abv, not that this is the best 5.2 or less abv beer, it isn’t). Price on this is a touch high, but we’ll ignore that aspect."
"Overall: This is one of the better stouts that I have had and would drink this again on a cold night."
"Think cool, creamy, flat - CHOCOLATE MILK! Delicious! I have had this in both a bottle (in England) and a can (in the US)...the can being 100% better. For some reason, it looses something when bottled that is captured when canned. This has a slightly sweet, milky and definitely chocolatey flavor. Pour it into a thin pint glass and let it settle out (similar to a Guinness)- sip slowly and savor, worth the time to pour and wait to sip and money investment for a 4 pack of this."
"O - Would be great if they packed a bit more flavor into this brew. I did enjoy it though."
"O – A great meal-time stout. Paired well with steak and char-grilled veggies."
"Overall: First time I have had it from the nitro can and I do prefer it to the bottle. You do not get this creamy head with the bottle but the smell does suffer a bit. Amazing dessert beer I will be revisiting!"
"D - No reason not to try this if you're a dark or strong beer fan. packs a punch but apologizes with some sweetness"
"O: A very nice dessert beer that I will keep readily available. What a treat!"
"I prefer this nitro-can version over the bottle for the better mouthfeel and appearance even though the aroma suffers a bit. A very tasty chocolate stout!"
"O: The chocolate sweetness is sometimes too much but all in all this is a good, session chocolate stout; great for desserts or on a cold evening in front of the fire"
"Overall....Damn good stout. Hits the spot."
"Notes: I am glad to finally buy, drink, and rate this beer as it is one of the most frequently rated here on BeerAdvocate and I must admit that I was curious."
"O: Outstanding! Very impressed with this brew, which was unexpected. I thought the chocolate would overwhelm the flavor profile, but thankfully it did not. Very well done overall. A bit pricey, but would be well worth buying as a treat every now and then."
"Overall a delicious stout that makes a great after-dinner drink. This is one that I have always put off trying for some reason. It was worth the wait."
"Overall- A very good stout, looks sexy, smells sexy, and the taste is there to match. Very good carbonation for a stout as well, I was pleasantly surprised by that not to mention the whole experience itself. When I first got this I thought it was going to taste like a watered down stout aka guiness but once I tasted it I was almost shocked, this rivals a lot of quality stouts that I have tasted before, my only gripe is the low ABV which is kind of unusual for stouts."
"The beer pours the expected blackish brown color with this beer's customary fabulous, mocha colored, creamy pillow on tap. Head retention is exceptional, with considerable sticky lacing all around. The nose is attractive, but this is really the only place this beer falls off a bit. Nevertheless, I get an attractive nose of light vanilla, milk chocolate and coffee. However, on the palate this beer once again flirt with perfection. The beer has something of a burnt toast flavor, which is quickly overwhelmed by cherry vanilla and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is as good as it gets. This beer is light, soft and creamy, with a nearly endless, smooth finish. Drinkability is just stunning. The alcohol is not at all noticeable, and yet it's nothing short of astonishing how much flavor this low abv. beer delivers. An absolute benchmark, especially on the nitro. Just excellent...."
"O: Sort of straightforward, but very delicious. A great desert beer for any occasion."
"poures a nice black color, no head just a khaki ring with a little lacing. smell and taste are both the same with chocolate, sweet malts and slight roasted bitter coffee. mouthfeel is a little thin but tastes more carbonated than the lack of head would suggest. overall a good beer."
"Try it as a chocolate truffle. approx. 2oz Lambic Framboise to 12oz Youngs Double Chocolate Stout"
"O: Huge fan, but not as up to snuff as it's draught brother. The utter smoothness of this brew combined with it's outstanding flavor make this one to come back to again and again. Worth the cost."
"O - Overall a good stout, not my favorite however. A bit strong on the chocolate taste, especially going down. Smooth just as I like my stouts, but I'd find some better ones out there before trying this again."
"Overall: A nice beer to drink on any occasion, and because of the low ABV one does not have to worry about getting overpowered by this beer. The price is also a plus!"
"Pours a small one finger light light brown head. The head is super creamy and isn't going anywhere, as would be expected with a nitro beer. The body is pitch black, no hues of red or anything, completely dark, completely non-see through. Overall it looks pretty damn good, but it is a nitro beer, so it should look good. The smell is very nice, sweet chocolate on the nose, I also get a noticeable deep malt smell and perhaps a sour smell, like there would be in a Guinness, so I don't know if that has to do with the nitro or not. Overall the smell is chocolaty, it's a pretty good smell all around! I've had this in the bottle and I think I like it more, the nitro version has that Guinness sour taste to it, kinda an unpleasant taste, I mean it works in Guinness because it's not a Guinness without it, but I don't know if it works in this beer. It's very smooth and creamy, but the sour just interrupts what would be a huge chocolate flavor. I wouldn't mind having a big chocolate punch and then a mild sour taste, but as it is now it's 50% sour, then 50% chocolate. Overall I get a nice malt taste, and a nice chocolate taste, but unfortunately a decent sour taste. Overall, the taste is ok, not a good as I was expecting though. Mouthfeel is hard to describe, because anyone who has had a nitro beer knows that it is a unique mouthfeel. It's a very thin beer, but at the same time it's really creamy and smooth, with almost no carbonation. So it's not a bad mouthfeel, in fact it's good, just not as big as you would expect with a stout. The drinkability is actually pretty high, the beer goes down pretty easily Overall on this beer, good beer, and it's actually gotten more chocolaty as the beer has progressed, but still not what I was hoping for. Good beer, but not great."
"O: Very nice stout with a strong chocolate/coffee and even licorice flavor hidden there somewhere. Roasted malt supply a fair portion of the bitterness."
"Nice roasted malt, rich chocolate and classic stout flavors all combine to make an excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"D- 4 This beer looks good, smells good, and tastes good... Yet there's something missing that has me lacking excitement over it. Regardless, it is solid overall. I'd be able to drink a few of these for sure because it has as light feel to go along with its good flavor."
"D - I like this brew, easy on the palate, very tasty."
"O - I was immensely pleased with the nitro-can version. It's everything it claims to be and more! It's too bad we don't get it in my area."
"There are plenty of other decent chocolate beers out there, pass this one by and pick another one up."
"Overall I did not like this one bit. Lots of people seem to like it, but not me. I didn't like it the first time. Then a few months later I picked up another bottle and got the same result. This beer has too much of an artificial taste to it. I love me some chocolate stouts, but this was a drain pour."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied plus but could be more viscious. Still, this is a great, creamy feel and a wonderful brew overall."
"O - This beer is much, much better from the nitro can than it is from the bottle in both taste and mouthfeel. The chocolate seems lost and the lack of the creamy mouthfeel doesn't help the cause."
"Overall this is a tasty stout but seems a bit more subdued in most categories than I was hoping for. Still a really solid beer though, now just wishing I had some dessert to compliment it. The price of the four back is a bit more than I would want to pay again but I hear this is phenomenal on tap so I will keep an eye out for it."
"Overall Drinkability - One of the best stouts I've had."
"You could suck down the four pack of cans easily. Alcohol wasn't noticeably present. Decent, but I wouldn't buy it on a regular basis."
"O- Great beer there are better ones but glad that i finally bought one and gave it a try"
"O - this is a very enjoyable stout."
"Overall an excellent beer that has never disappointed."
"O: Smooth. Delicious. Dark. Chocolatey. Great brew."
"O: Good. Delicious beer that is not too sweet, plenty of flavor but not overbearing. I'd order this over a standard Irish stout anyday."
"O: Not something I would drink often, but well worth it on special occasions, or when the craving hits you. Very drinkable."
"This is not an every day beer, but it was enjoyable and a fun treat. I would have another one, but maybe just on Christmas or a special holiday."
"O- Total turn off by the mouth feel. It takes away from the flavor and is extremely disappointing. Could not finish it. Will not buy this one again."
"I would call this especially chocolatey, much less double chocolatey."
"O. Overall this is a nice chocolate stout. Not the best I have had, but good. Great beer to have a couple of on a cold night."
"Overall taste is delicious and a great go to winter time stout...on my top 10 list and an easy go to selection."
"Pours a nice one and a half finger mocha head, very creamy looking, black body. Only a small amount of lacing remains, kind of disappointing. Smells of chocolate, roasted barley, sweet malts, some yeasty funk. Tastes is dark chocolate, toffee, coffee, crystal malts, some funky yeasty after taste. Light carbonation, medium bodied fitting for the style but I'd prefer more body. Overall it's descent, but a touch too roasty for my taste and a bit thin. $10 a 4 pack."
"Sampled from a bottle with a 4/11/11 best by date. Black in color with a thick beige head with good staying power. Foam very slowly reduced to a wispy cap and light lacings on the glass. As the name suggests, prominent chocolate aroma with hints of dark roasted malt and a light hint of coffee. Smooth and creamy feel, with light carbonation, but a little thinner than I had expected. Dark chocolate and dark roasted malt flavors with an underlying coffee flavor. Finished with a bitter hop edge which added to the character and complexity of this stout. A very good stout that I thoroughly enjoyed."
"delicious all around."
"O - Great stout. Very good for the style, and works beautifully with a lambic."
"O - at first I wasnt sure that this was a great beer, but the more I drink it the more i love it and truly get the chocolate taste and smooth finish."
"O: I am a big fan of Young's but usually only on cask in the UK, for the most part bottled British beers pale in comparison to their cask equivalents, although this one's on CO2 it's very, very enjoyable"
"Has a great smell and taste, a very rich taste and hence could probably have more than 2-3 in one sitting as it is basically like a meal in a bottle, however it was a great drinking experience!"
"O - For a session stout, this is a wonderful pick. Not super chocolatey but sweeter than the traditional stout and just as creamy and silky smooth as the rest."
"Had this beer on tap this beer was great, black creamy off whte head with exceptional retention and lacing the beer taste like bitter sweet chocolate and is very well balanced and refreshing there isn't a very stong hop aroma that doesn't over power the rest of the beer it has great body and mouthfeel overall this is just an exceptional beer and I would have it over and over"
"Drinkability- I thought this beer was really nice, though the lack of chocolate notes was a bit of a disappointment, I think that the overall smoothness of the beer as well as the interesting mix between the coffee and mild citrus flavors were really interesting and made up for it. It was a really nice beer to drink really slowly, I had a 500 ml (more or less a pint) size bottle and was still finishing it off when we were practicing (it took me about 3 hours to drink) and I really enjoyed it."
"D- This beer was overhyped for me, it was pretty much just another stout, much like Guiness, and was easy to drink."
"A decently drinkable low abv stout, very similar to Guiness but sweeter and less bitter. Easy enough to drink and worth a try. Not fantastic though."
"If you have the option to try it in a bottle, go that route. I enjoyed it more. You just miss out on the creamy head."
"Drinkability: There is only a tinge of bitterness in this but it is what ouns out all the flavors. A truly delicious beer"
"Chocolately, but super drinkable. I want to inject this into my veins when I'm sad."
"Complements freer jazz very well. I recommend Sonny Rollins trio recordings in Europe 1959 or watch a Tottenham free flowing soccer match!"
"This is a mighty fine stout. There is plenty of chocolate flavor and it's multidimensional. I don't know that I could really enjoy the sweet, roasted, chocolate flavor all night, but it's great for a pint now and then."
"Overall I like this beer quite a bit."
"It's so tasty, reminds me of the days of being a kid at school & getting chocolate milk instead of just milk. Treat yourself to some. Drink up!"
"D-Heard this beer talked up a bunch so i was kinda let down. It was good but really muted flavors and just wasn't the sweet goodness i was looking for. Will give this beer another try sometime and see if i feel different"
"This ale deserves the high BA ratings that most have given it. This is a choclate lovers, English dark ale lover's dream. Full of complexity, richness, and warmth that is perfect for a winter's night cap, It is also perfect for a desert ale. I think this will go perfectly with German Cheesecake. For $4 a pint it is a steal."
"D: The metallic component completely ruins the beer for me. I will have to try another one to make sure this isn't a pervasive problem."
"WOW... pours an opaque very dark brown/black with an off-white creamy lingering head. Smells wonderful; of relatively sweet dark chocolate and dark roasted grain complemented perfectly with a hop feel in the nose. Feels incredibly smooth...just wonderful. The head is soft and the body is silky, a sexy beer really. Tastes of a delicious dark stout, dark and coffee/toffee-like with a strong hop presence which is balanced with the delicate flavor of dark chocolate to provide just enough sweetness to make this beer a great late-night/ after dinner beer. Wonderful and absolutely enjoyable!"
"The mouthfeel is creamy and hearty. This beer slides down my throat, makes me feel it then makes me want more. My spouse and I often have this as a desert instead of chocolate or cola."
"The CpJ"
"Poured a muddy black with a large light brown rocky head with average retention and good lacing. The aroma was of burnt chocolate malts and a light doughy yeast with strong notes of dark chocolate and coffee. It tasted lightly sweet and quite malty in the beginning and finished about the same but with a strong bitter/sweet chocolate flavor that stayed on the palate for a very long while. Mouthfeel was medium in body and creamy yet watery in texture with a mild carbonation. Overall a brew with lots of chocolate flavor but not much else."
"D: Great example of this style! Definitely a beer I would pick up again!!"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable stout and light ABV makes this a good session stout if that were ever possible."
"A really great beer with a good smooth mouthfeel."
"I could drink this all day! Yum"
"This was a pretty good beer. With a name like Double Chocolate, you would expect this to be a chocolate explosion, but it is not. There is a hefty amount of sweet pipe tobacco going on and it is the primary flavor of the beer. I don't think this is a beer that I'll frequent, maybe something on the odd occasion."
"Taste was very similar with chocolate being very noticeable. It was sweet but very cocoa-ish. Roasted coffee added a nice finish that was also a little bitter (coffee bitter). Roasted malts brought some sweetness to the finish as well. I would have liked to have had a better middle to the body but in all this was a decent stout and the name says it all with the pronounced chocolate flavors."
"D- Very smooth, almost a creamy texture. kind of a milk chocolate."
"D-Mmmm i want this all night long!! its so tasty and disappears so quickly! taste stays and is so easy to drink."
"D- Exceptional. Not refreshing, but lovely anyway. Not a session beer for me, but nice to drink over a long conversation with friends."
"Great beer and one that I would not hesitate to drink or offer one to anyone who likes a bit of chocolate with their beer!!"
"Overall: I love this stuff. It gives a little more than a standard Irish Stout. Not a ton....but enough. Found the bottle 4-pack for $7.99....so I stocked up. One of my favorites!"
"Drinkability: Like I said, it goes down easy, and stays down without a problem."
"Notes-I really cant say this is the best chocolate stout i have had,since this is my first time having one.So with that said this is a damn good beer,it is everything it says to be.I also look forward to trying this again and again!!! Also i highly recomend this for everyone who is a fan of chocolate stouts!!!"
"Not what I expected. Could use a little more flavor and depth. Pretty easy drinking and satisfying in a way."
"The body is solidly full without being heavy. Drinkability is very good, but that may depend on your tolerance for sweetness. Overall, a very good brew that's worth your time. Grab one soon."
"I feel like this is a little wimpier than I remember, experiencing a lot fo things being a little more """washed out," though that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nice to have a flavorful stuff that's in moderation, not overdoing it. I could have another, for sure."
"Somehow I've had this a few times and have never taken the time to review it. That ends here. It pours a clear dark sienna topped by a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, chocolate powder, and a light air of coffee. The taste simplifies things even further (somehow), highlighting the roast and the (now dark) chocolate. It's tasty, but -- and I hate putting it like this, but I can't think of a better way -- still kinda boring too. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish. Overall, a pretty good stout, nothing amazing, but eminently drinkable and enjoyable."
"D- This was a good drinking lighter stout. As far as chocolate flavor it does deliver but I was looking for a little more to it. A little one sided at times in the mouth. The ABV makes it a muti-beer drinker. The overall feel to it doesn't make you feel full so having a couple would be no problem."
"Drinkability - I must say that this beer is very good and very enjoyable and very easy to drink. However, considering all the hype that surrounds this beer and all that I've read about it, I was expecting much more. Some reviews put this on par with the Rogue Chocolate Stout, but for my money, this doesn't even compare to the overall satisfaction of the Rogue. That being said, this beer is still very, very, very good and is worth a try."
"D: A wonderful specimen of a stout with a flavor that demands to be tasted again and again. Not at all cloying, even for all its chocolatey goodness, and with a low 5.2% ABV, approachable enough to enjoy that flavor several times in one sitting."
"D: This does go down insanely easy, tons of milk chocolate, almost no bitterness, and a light body. A perfect session beer by definition, but I'd rather a stout with more body."
"Mmmm, stout, with your stouty stoutness. Nice chocolate flavor without being overwhelming. Would pair well with chocolate anything, and stands up well on its own. I'd be interested to see how beer is out of the nitro can. Definitely will be revisiting this one in the future."
"Very nice pour on this one. Head quickly settles to about a half an inch of creamy off white toffee color. Body was nearly black and basically opaque. Looked delicious and I couldn't wait to try some. Aroma was somewhat disappointing. Slight chocolate milk odor, but very faint overall. Taste proved much better than the smell. Started off nice and sweet with nice chocolate and maltiness. Finished dry with a more roasted flavor and hints of coffee. The finish was nice and kept the sweetness up front from becoming too much. Mouthfeel was excellent, smooth and creamy. For as rich as this beer could be, the drinkability was good as it did not feel super heavy, and the flavor was balanced enough to keep the sweetness from catching up. Overall, I don't have a ton of experience with stouts, but I really enjoyed this one and I feel like it sets the bar fairly high."
"Overall: This is a great starting point for stouts. Guinness fans and sweet beer fans will both enjoy this, as well as anyone who has an affection for chocolate milkshakes."
"CHEERS"
"D-Like the Wells Banana Bread, I can appreciate it for its success within the style."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth, incredibly rich and creamy beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall great Stout."
"I give a Schlitz for Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout. It is quite tasty but it is also pricey. If I could buy it without the import price I could see myself drinking this regularly."
"I really enjoyed this stout, it is one of the best I have ever had."
"Poured from bottle (no date) into an english pint glass. Pours a dark black opaque color with a huge tan head. Very sticky lacing that coats and hardens in the inside of the glass. Very chocolatey of course- aroma is slightly nutty- with a taste of milk, chocolate and almonds. Very mild carbonation, otherwise a nice drinkable beer."
"D: Very flavorful and really easy to drink. Balance sets me up for drink after drink."
"with the 5.2 abv, i could see drinking this one for an evening, or at least have one with anything called death by chocolate."
"Mouthfeel as mentioned above -- thick and chewy, but amazingly light and fluffy at the same time. Very good, very enjoyable beer."
"I didn't think anything held a candle to Youngs Oatmeal Stout, but this brother is definitely on the same page. It's extremely drinkable and is one which I thoroughly enjoyed."
"It contains actual chocolate, and sugar, so the taste isn't a surprise, but it isn't excessively sweet."
"I had a high expectation of this beer but it's quite disappointing as per the above review to be honest. I hope this is a bad bottle."
"A very delicious, fun stout, that will be enjoyed by novice stout lovers and as a novelty by serious stout lovers. Stout lovers will probably crave something with more depth, power, and complexity but you can always enjoy this as a sort of """stout light""". Pretty yummy really."
"D: good example of a milk stout that I stumbled across at my local brewpub/beer bar but I have not heard of it before. I'll keep my eyes open for it but wouldn't pass up another new one if I had the chance."
"Drinkability - creamy chocolates with enough balance of toasted malts make this a very drinakable beer - as it warmed the chocolate flavors really showed through- nice aftertaste in the finish."
"This is an amazing brew. Chocolate smell and taste. The appearance was nothing spectacular but everything else measured up. ( I have decided now that a beer REALLY look bad to receive low marks in the appearance category.) Will be buying this soon again!!! GREAT BEER WELLS & YOUNG"""S LTD!!!!"
"D - A pretty easy drink, but I expect that at it's abv. Again, this wasn't quite as good as I expected it to be, but it's a relatively good beer and one I'll enjoy again. I think I prefer it from the nitro can."
"Could easily substitute as a dessert at the end of a meal, probably not a beer you would drink back-to-back, as it is very filling."
"Unbelievably creamy, never had a beer this creamy, I have to say it inhibits the drinkability of the beer. Neat beer something I could get every now and again but not to often."
"Drink - This is a highly drinkable chocolate beer that is very tasty. If you're a fan of the style it's worth checking out for sure."
"Great stout!"
"D: Good drinkability but sweet could drink them every night with a nice big piece of chocolate cake or browies with a drizzle of warm chocolate sauce."
"Overall I'm glad I finally made it around to trying this beer - better than I was anticipating and well worth a shot."
"Note: i used this to cook a corned beef in my slow cooker and it was wonderful!"
"D -It is not sweet at all, which is great. Well balanced. Excellently done."
"Still not the beer I'm searching for but the closest thing so far. Does anyone make a stout that delivers real chocolate flavor with a velvety mouthfeel? Am I looking for an alcoholic chocolate shake? Yes! Is that too much to ask? :)"
"d. its drinkable."
"D: its alright, not the best, but certainly not the worst. If this were thicker/creamier, I would probably love it."
"D- This beer is smooth and creamy but unremarkable. At about $3.50 a bottle it is much more affordable than other superior chocolate stouts though. I may buy this one again."
"The foam was a dark beigh color, smooth and very lacy. The color was 90 percent opaque with a brown highlight. The smell was a deep malted barley overtone dominated by a artificial chocolate aroma and hints of cinnamon, licorice and hazelnut. The taste was a very deep and robust combination of roasted malt barley and chocolate underlined by hints of cinnamon, hazelnut, flowers and nuts. Mouthfeel - heavy and full bodied and viscous. Drinkability - It definitly lives up to the stout name. It was full of complex aromas and flavors, but the chocolate taste had a artificial tones. Ok session, but in my personal taste, I'm not to fond of the beer and chocolate combination."
"Notes: For me a lot of iconic imagery rides on this one, good brew but ultimately not that exciting or pleasing for me although I can recognize the general merits."
"D: Very, very good. Slowly enjoyed this beer throughout almost the entire second half of the Packers/Eagles wild card playoff game. Controlled ABV, settles easy on the stomach, and a lot of chocolate flaor going on in this one."
"By far the best beer I've tasted thus far. My journey has not been long lived so there may be others that step in it's path. As for now, this is definitely my beer of choice."
"D - excellent cold weather sipping beer to introduce to friends, wish I had another one to enjoy, but these are only 17 oz."
"D - Just about everything is right on with this beer, and an extremely reasonable ABV to boot. Rich, delicious, and complex."
"Drinkability: It's an interesting beer, but something that I'd drink all the time. I think it sticks to the style, but I don't think this is the best milk/sweet stout."
"I fairly enjoy this beer in a bottle so I figured that I would also enjoy this same brew on nitro-tap. I was wrong. I had this at McNellie's in Tulsa on New Year's Eve. The beer had a rather nice appearance. Dark black with a never dissipating off-white nitro head floating on top, the Double Chocolate Stout was immediately inviting. The taste was another story. Sure I'm aware that the name of this brew is a Double Chocolate Stout, but it seems like this barely even qualifies as a beer. The overwhelming chocolate flavor is, of course, the first and predominant taste one gets when sipping on a nitro fueled chocolate stout. There's a slight bit of bitterness and malts that let you know that this really is a beer, but for the most this is just a glorified milk shake. Trust me, the best way to drink Young's Double Chocolate Stout is poured from a non-nitrogen induced bottle."
"D - The only thing that would make this better would be a higher ABV, but at its current level its easily drinkable / poundable. Highly recommended to any chocolate ale fan, you won't be disappointed."
"On nitro at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a deep not quite opaque black with a nice frothy khaki nitro head. Aroma is mostly roasted malts with just a bit of chocolate. The taste is a smooth blend of roasted malts alongside slightly bitter cocoa. The beer is quite light and smooth, as you would expect on nitro. This is a respectable beer, one I should have a bit more often than I usually do."
"A covworker suggested Youngs Double Chocolate, and I'm glad he did!"
"Overall a pleasant choclate stout - but with pesonal bias, as I'd far rather enjoy an APA..."
"D: Goes down easy. I could drink one of these every day without getting bored of it."
"D- heavy but easily drinkable this is a must try"
"This beer has a surprisingly complex flavor and reminds me of Hershey's Chocolate Twizzlers. I'm usually not a fan of sweet stouts... I know it's not the same but usually I drink my coffee black if you know what I mean."
"D - with a bit of a stronger taste, drinkability could have been higher, but it is still an easy drinker"
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style Sweet stout."
"D: it is really good over all and will buy more"
"D- For mr, one by the fire. But I could have one every night by the fire. Really good milk stout."
"A very dark, unique beer. I got it to stretch my borders and this beer did that. A very drinkable, non-traditional beer. It has a great appearance and aroma upon initial contact. The flavor was very unique and the chocolate hints make it a beer worth testing. It's perfect as a closer or for something sweet and different. I'm glad I got it and feel confidant in suggesting it as a. beer to test the boundaries."
"Treat yourself and have one of these."
"Don't want another one."
"drinkability; This beer goes down so smooth and refreshing. It's rich without being over the top, can't be any better IMO."
"D: This makes for quite a wonderful dessert."
"Pretty tasty blend of chocolate and malt. No doubt, the most chocolately brew I've ever had and pretty darn tasty. Good for dessert."
"Honestly, this reminds me of a cross between Dieu du Ceil's Aphrodasiaque and the Peche Mortel. Certainly not a bad thing. Good as a desert, not so much for general drinking."
"Overall - I'd give it a B+ or A- because it's pleasant to have tried this, but stouts are not my most favorite style of beer, but it seems to be of high quality and thoughtfully made."
"This is a wonderful stout that drinks a little like you would expect milk too. probably the most impressive part of this beer is its lacing. you can see lacing throughout the entire drink of this beer. I would love to try this beer on tap"
"Very drinkable and very sessionable brew. It's particularly good in the winter season. Reminds me of a now retired beer called Snow Plow from Widmer. I miss Snow Plow."
"I had this beer at the yardhouse. the guy didn't pour it very well but it still has a minimal creamy tan head which tasted great. The beer was dark brown smelled vaguely like chocolate and a little more malty. The beer tasted very good...like bittersweet chocolate with a nice lingering chocolate finish. Nothing too heavy or too sweet and not too much carbonation. I would definitely drink this beer again."
"Had this on nitro-tap at the local pub. The tan nitro-cascade effect head was two fingers thick and stayed. The aroma is malty with hints of chocolate initially but with time and as the beer warms up, chocolate takes over completely. So is the case with taste, initially when the beer is cold, the taste is predominantly malty, with hints of chocolate and a dry finish, but as it warms up, the chocolate takes over. Rich, creamy mouthfeel, a delicious brew. Drinkability is very good. This is one stout I can have anytime, anyplace. Highly recommended."
"D: clean dry chocolatey finish and low abv begs another sip."
"D- pretty great I could drink several in one sitting"
"D: Its a stout true to form so after half my bottle, I'm getting full. If it were a lighter style, I would be downing them like no one's business, but then it wouldn't be a stout."
"M: Soft and creamy, but not heavy on the mouth. Almost no carbonation can be felt in the mouth."
"Classic nitro driven cascade action on the pour. One finger of off-white head. Deep brown. Nose of barley malt, chocolate, and black licorice. Malt flavor balances well with chocolate and only a slight tinge of anise. Very sweet stout. Medium body. Highly quaffable."
"D - Good drinkability. I can imagine throwing these back around a poker table with my friends in winter. Nice. Overpriced a bit though. Might be because it's imported, but $9.00+ for a 4-pack of these is way too much for this beer."
"D: Easily one of my favorites. As it warms the tastes come out a lot more so drink it closer to room temperature to enjoy it the most."
"Overall, the best thing about this beer was strong delivery of chocolate throughout the taste, and the pleasing, creamy mouthfeel. The beer looks great when you first pour it, with the head shooting up, and lingering for a bit. If there is a category in which the beer lacks, it would be aroma. There is a tinge of slightly unpleasant metal, which does smooth out as it warms up, but it could have been a bit stronger and more complex."
"This is as good as a beer can get. Of all the chocolate and oatmeal stouts available, there is no equal. This beer has a beautiful ebony color, gorgeous rich foamy head, an aroma to die for, and a taste that is superior. I am in love with this beer. If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, give me some Young's."
"Also, I've had TWO friends get stuck with the moo thunder, and I will bet that that's far worse. I hear its epically rough. I want to do a side by side comparison and I will modify my review if necessary. If not, a 40oz backup plan is fairly cheap."
"As the brew slothes down the gallows of my awaiting throat I begin to realize I have officialy arrived in Youngs Double Chocolate Stout heaven."
"Finally tried this on-tap at the Blue Monk in Buffalo, NY. Pours a deep dark brown with a foamy tan head, leaving a tremendous amount of lacing on the glass. Smell is a beautiful roasty mix of malt, caramel, and chocolate. The taste is also very good. Slightly bitter, but still easy to drink. Great beer."
"D - At 5.2% I was surprised to see alcohol here, so I knocked it down 0.5 point. Dangerously drinkable for it's flavors but I wish those heat esters would mellow out a bit more than they are. Maybe some age would do it well. Nonetheless, this is still a decadent milk and chocolately stout."
"Drinkability: Not too high of an ABV so could potentially drink quite a bit but a bit too sweet to have more than probably 2."
"One of my all time favorite brew!"
"I love this beer! The chocolate, lactose, and roasted balance is perfect in this beer, and I make sure to pick it up as often as I can. I could drink this beer all night long (and have)."
"D- Very easy to drink. Not overly sweet. Heavy enough to make a sipper, but only 5.2 on alcohol so no burn."
"Mouthfeel is nitro fluffy like a Guinness. Very drinkable."
"This beer was delicious. I felt like i needed to modify my rating slightly."
"Overall, this is a fun beer, and I'll probably drink more in the future. I see myself making a sweet black and tan with this. I also would be very interested in trying this in the bottle and on-tap instead of nitro can."
"I could have a few of these, it's pretty good."
"Draft. On nitro at Town Hall Tap. Poured into a pint glass a dark brown/black color with a nitro style tiny bubbled tan head. Chocolate milk and vanilla dominate the nose. The taste is oh so good chocolate goodness, not overly so, but for sure is the dominate flavor. Nice vanilla flavors as well. A total desert beer. Smooth, velvety, creamy medium/heavy mouthfeel. Semi sweet. Good overall but not sure how much I could drink."
"Definitely taste of chocolate and more chocolate, feel is very creamy and some chewiness as the malt flavor comes through. Finnishes with a slight bitterness and evasive fruitiness - blackberry."
"D- This is definitely a beer that must be consumed on it's own as it tends to detract from any non dessert foods. It's uniqueness probably limits it to one per sitting for me. I did find it very tasty and if you want chocolate drink this one."
"Drinkability - good, but again, I expected more from this beer. It's one that I would drink on someone else's nickel, but there are chocolate stouts out there that drink better."
"Edit: Some three years later I finally got around to sampling this from the bottle. As expected, I'm enjoying it quite a bit more. On nitro the milk chocolate character of the beer is played up a lot. in the bottled version a lot more roasted barley character pulls through. Espresso and a light acidity are more apparent."
"Overall: I know I'm repeating myself in saying this stuff is chocolate, but hey, a spade's a spade."
"The aroma and taste are (naturally) severely muted here compared to the regular drafts I had previously. The biggest casualty perhaps is the decadent dark chocolate flavor, unlike any other brew. A good bit of hoppy bitterness and the soft roasty/toasty biscuity malt remains, but without the chocolate, this is hardly the complete package. But for it's style, I'm happy to find only the slightest sweetness (in either of the servings I've had so far), whereas I've come accustomed to tasting a more sour, sugary sweet character taken from the lactose. They've crafted a fine ale indeed. Just avoid the can."
"I am not a big stout drinker, but after sampling this brew at a nearby restaurant, I HAD to have my own pint! Everyone at the table was impressed with this one. It is a beautiful black mocha color with an impressive lingering head. It smells toasty and chocolaty. This beer is like drinking creamy chocolate beer without the sweet...yummy! Drinkability is good, but it IS a stout. One was plenty for me, because it is so rich and filling. I normally go for pale ale's, and I loved it, so this one is definitely worth your time!"
"a great style for the nitro can and a wonderful chocolate feel of creaminess. look is eye candy out of the candy and has a delicious tasting head. nose of carob and cocoa. this is in the palate obviously with a cocoa added quality to it. not extremely thick and rich though. besides the noted chocolate the beer as an interesting toastiness about it. a tad sour licorice smokey. and a mild mineral chalk feel."
"D: Nice stuff, and easy to drink as a draft. No more than one pint of this will do though, it's just a little too sweet and chocolatey for too much of this."
"Do yourself a favor and let the last half of the beer warm to 60 degrees F or more, brings out the texture."
"I'll drink this every time I have a chance! I'll need to come up with some stout rotation though!"
"D- Love this beer. I try and savor them, though they go down so smooth, it makes it hard."
"Drinkability is good. I could easily have another of these and they go great with coffee and breakfast."
"I can see how if you're used to Guinness and Murphy's, and haven't tried a lot of richer stouts, then Young's might seem more familiar and easier to take. If it's on tap and there aren't any other microbrew stouts on the menu, I might do it (I also remember the tap version being MUCH thicker). However, the fact that so many experienced beer fans have rated it so highly baffles me. Young's is also a little pricey; why pay more for a mediocre beer?"
"d: Perfect. I'd drink this a lot more if it was more available in my area, but the secret is out about how great a beer this is."
"D- Enjoyed drinking this one. Because of the low ABV for a stout could session these. Looking forward to drinking this one again."
"I drank this on a night where much beer and many varieties of food had been consumed, and still found this to be very flavorful."
"I have not revisited this beer in some time so I bought a four pack of nitro cans. This stout is jet black with a white head that dissipates slowly into a thin line. Chocolate is the smell with a hint of lactose and some hints of roasty malts. The taste is pure chocolate in the center that is coated in coffee or roasted flavors. The mouthfeel is very disappointing to me. I did not remember the thin watery feel of this beer. The thinness distracted me from the perfect flavors."
"D - Rich and complex, while still staying smooth and easy to drink. An amazing stout that keeps body without sacrificing drinkability."
"Pours a dark coffee color with a tan head, pretty much what a great stout looks like. Cocoa armoa was definitely there, as well as some roasted malts. Very low in bitterness, somewhat of a mix of dark chocolate and black coffee. Good thickness, could be a tad thicker, but I won't complain. Great desert beer as it's easy on the pallet , but it's also pretty pricey. Best for semi-special occasions/meals."
"Pours a dark brown colour with thick tan head. Tons of lacing around the glass. Smells of mild sweet chocolate and some roasted malt. Flavour has a nice bitterness, balanced with the sweet chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel. For a low alcohol stout, this packs a ton of flavour. One of my go-to stouts when I don't feel like drinking an imperial one."
"D: This one is very drinkable, and it's because it leaves me craving the chocolate flavor after each drink. The low alcohol content (5.2% ABV) means you could drink this for a while before feeling the effects. It would make a good holiday beer when not wanting to get overly imbibed but retain the chocolate stout flavor."
"Drinkability: Simply a delicious, session-like Stout. Surprised it took me so long to try this."
"Drinkability: I could drink this beer everyday! The alcohol and body are not too substantial making it a very easy drinker. This is one of the best stouts out there!"
"Pours a deep brown color with a tan head (that never leaves) and insane amount of lacing. Smells wonderful, like a chocolate milk shake with coffee notes. Tastes of milk chocolate with chocolate malts and a little coffee bitterness to lessen the strong sweetness. Mouthfeel is great with a thick oily body. Drinkability is high."
"D -- Very easy to drink, but more than two would probably become filling. Rich and satisfying, nonetheless. An eye-opener for people who think beer can't have character."
"Served from tap into a SweetWater 420 shaker. Poured dark dark brown with a one finger off-white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. The flavor was of roasted malt, cream, coffee, slight caramel, and a nutty note. It had a heavy feel on the palate with no carbonation anywhere to be found. Overall this was a nice brew. However, the flavors were kind of light at least to me. If they would have been a little more intense this one could have been great. But still very nice regardless of this fact."
"D : A fantastic dessert beer, like a good glass of chocolate milk but not as sweet. Imagine Guinness, with chocolate added, and it's about right."
"D - Definitely a beer that is excellent down to the last drop, pretty filling though."
"500ml bottle poured into an oversized tulip. Pours pitch black with a big tan head. The head does not stick around but leaves thick sheets of lacing behind. Aroma is weak, some roasted malts, chocolate, a bit of coffee...and something metallic. Taste of coffee and chocolate, nothing too strong and the chocolate is neither very bitter nor sweet. Leaves a nice aftertaste of more bitter chocolate and again, coffee. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is light which I prefer for this style. Not too heavy so drinkability should be okay. That being said, I much prefer the Black Oak approach of using cocoa to Young's """natural chocolate flavouring"""."
"Pours real thick and creamy. Great nitro-effect with the rising bubbles. Head settles at about 2 fingers. Aroma is of malt, smoke, some bread and light chocolate. Taste is really subtle with the chocolate, malty and full. Beer is a good thickness, not to light but not overly heavy. Great for desserts and stand alone. Best as it warms up a bit, don't drink it cold! Overall a great stout and definitely a must have."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink. Really enjoyed this beer, very drinkable for anyone."
"This is very easy drinking, but also very rich... one is plenty! Definitely a stout for chocolate fans to check out, big chocolate flavour without being overly sweet."
"D- Very delicious. Not something that I could drink all the time but definitely a wonderful treat"
"drinkability - oh man, this was awesome. best beer of the night, of which ive had 3 (porter, stout and IPA) i can drink this over and over at dessert time, the head was so thick I want to scoop it onto some chocolate ice cream with a spoon. It would also go great with a steak. Almost no bite and goes down so easy. This 16.9oz was gone too quickly"
"This was a pretty good stout, there was pretty good flavor though not really as sweet as I would expect from a milk stout. Though tasty it was very filling and not very easy to drink."
"It is very drinkable, but not something I would want to open more than one of in a given night. The flavor is just too rich, it would be like eating a big dinner, then following it with cheesecake, and then, for some reason, following that with tiramisu. Unthinkable! Savor this one."
"D: Overall a good beer. I would definitely try this one again. I am curious how the beer holds up in the cans compared to the bottle, but that is an experiment for another day. Overall this beer's a good solid brew: Not overly complex, great look and mouthfeel and it delivers double chocolate just as promised."
"D/O- I'd say for what it is this guy is very drinkable. A little disappointed given it's BA rating but enjoyed none-the-less. Would be a great beer for a """beginner""" beer drinker who only knows a stout called Guinness."
"Drinkabilitity would be higher if it wasn't so rich. However, I would not change anything about this beer. It is not a session beer, but it is one hell of a good dessert beer."
"Overall: a very light and refreshing stout with a decent amount of chocolate. Nothing special and I probably wouldn't seek out again. Worth a shot though."
"Dark black appearance. Thick creamy lacing on glass. Pleasant Chocolately aroma. Very thin In feel. Extremely easy to drink for a stout. Clean finish. Awesome chocolate aftertaste, like drinking a well balance cold hot Chocolate. Extremely clear. Perfect carbonation for style. All out awesome beer. Characteristicslly much lighter than you would expect, but still awesome, especially for a beginner stout drinker."
"Overall, a delicious tasting chocolate stout. Iv'e already returned to it several times and will again come the winter season. Great for after dinner."
"D: First taste is a little bitter but by the next sip the chocolate starts brewing in the pie hole, yummy."
"Pretty light for a stout and enjoyable overall with good and easy drinkability. This is the rare stout like a Guinness that I could drink all night."
"D - This beer was absolutely delicious. The head was thick enough to eat with a spoon afterwards. Very clean brew, and nice balance of chocolate with the malty stout character."
"I am really into this beer as a great winter time session beer. I stepped out of my IIPA and Experimental beer repertoire and was really glad I did. Well recommended."
"This doesn't hold a candle to the best chocolate stouts: Rogue's Chocolate Stout and their Double Chocolate Stout."
"All in all, I found it quite good. Definitely redeems stouts for me, seeing as my first stout was guinness."
"Drinkability- For a stout this is quite drinkable, but definitely not a session beer. The heaviness of this beer, gives it the characteristic of being a meal in a glass, and therefore one needs only one of these."
"D - If you love Guinness you are going to love this and want to drink it every second you can lol Guinness is one of my favorite beers of all time but I am thinking this may have replaced it"
"...I'm curious as to how this tastes from the can, for this review was done from the bottle."
"If you like dark beers and chocolate, you'll probably love this."
"D:very drinkable i could drink this all day and would buy agian when i had the chance."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel, with a bit of carbonation that complements it nicely. Nice drinkability as well, fairly low abv with a good amount of flavor and a nice mouthfeel."
"D-Decreased over time. First few sips were great, but as I reached the end, became harder to finish the beer."
"D - The sweetness with bitterness of this beer keeps it from being good anytime. But it is undeniably fresh and refreshing."
"a damn easy beer to drink and an excellent one."
"Almost black and opaque with tan, but rather decent for nitro, creamy smooth head with nice lacing throughout the glass. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. Bitter dark chocolate taste. Consistency is watery, but howbeit beer is medium-bodied with slight sour aftertaste. Drinkable for all the seasons and times. Excellent stout!"
"I am very pleased with this beer, I will certainly be trying it again."
"Cheers"
"Youngs Double Chocolate Stout it pretty much black, and had a nice creamy nitro head. It's pretty much the same as Guiness in appearance maybe a nano shade darker. It has the aroma of semi dark chocolate with a bit of coffee as well. The flavers pull through really well on draft. It is smooth as can be and can be over indulged pretty easily. It always remains as one of my top stouts."
"Drinkability: I was expecting this beer to be super heavy like many chocolate stouts are. Instead its actually somewhat light and very easy to drink. Tasty and simple, a great beer."
"This is the king of chocolate stouts as far as I've tasted. Very tasty."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Just a solid all around beer. This one has got my wife wanting to look at beer more and more now. Gotta love that!"
"The Double Chocolate Stout is with no question a game changer for me; it's one of the early beers that convinced me that real beer can force your palate out of hibernation, and it's one of the first beers that I offer to newcomers who are looking for excitement and to be entertained by their beer. I can't wait to find it somewhere on draught"
"A decent chocolate beer and the original but it fails to excite especially given some of the other chocolate beers now on the market."
"Drinkability - This beer gos down to easy. Its a very mild stout with a super chocolate aftertaste. This beer is a desert beer. I could pour this over any chocolate or coffee flavored desert and go to town! Also, i like the can better then the bottle. The widget flattens this beer and makes its smoother, were the bottle has a carbinated flavor that doesnt work"
"Ive had this in the nitro can version before a few times never really enjoyed it like that i dont like the nitro effecting the carbonation. This is a vast improvement for me really a classic that everyone who's a BA should try."
"D= very drinkable, would be a great solo for dessert, drinkable in session if in the mood (and can afford it!), probably nice with roasted red meats, dark desserts or for the holidays."
"very drinkable milk stout and has lots of flavor to be hovering at the 5% abv. I would always cap off an evening with a pint of this if I catch it on tap."
"Excellent stout. Was more than pleased with this and I am looking forward to enjoying the other three in the pack in the future."
"Fantastic beer, then, now and hopefully, always. Rich enough to satisfy a stout craving, but drinkable enough to be an everyday beverage."
"Pours a near black with an impressive brown head. Pretty good lacing and decent head retention. Aroma is of coco beans with a hint of alcohol and roasted notes in there as well. Taste follows the double chocolate name. Sweet, chocolate syrup taste to start. Not too strong, but doesn't have many other flavors to compete against. A more unsweetened/dark chocolate malt is present at the end and faint roasted flavors. Simple chocolate stout, but tasty and not overdone. Creamy mouthfeel and good drinkability."
"Poured a rich black hue with a creamy off white two finger head. The stout featured good head retention and thick lacing. An overall nice and tempting appearance. The smell consisted of a slight chocolate aroma with hints of caramel and a unpleasant metallic. The taste was average and muted. The flavor did not jump out of the glass like in the case of an imperial stout. However, it was pleasant and suprisingly dry. Mouthfeel, however, was a bit thick without the pleasure of a thick, rich taste. It coated the mouth with a dull sensation which lessened the desire for the next sip. The poor mouthfeel and dull taste detracted from the beer's drinkability."
"D: Good"
"I don't know whether it has come across in this review, but this beer is really quite nice."
"Rating based on the draft I had at Closed for Business... Pours a beautiful black with a thick, light brown head. Looks so damn good! Smell is of brownie batter with some roasted grains and malt sweetness. Taste is chocolate-goodness all over the place, with some roasty / light coffee notes and an underlying sweetness kind of like an extra kick of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is thick, full and creamy. So delicious, one of my favorite stouts... highly drinkable and pairs well with desserts / as dessert."
"D: A nice relaxing dessert beer. The can nor the bottle compare to this brew off draft but this is a fine showing as well."
"With the low ABV this would make a nice session beer, if you like drinking liquid chocolate all night. Too much chocolate for me to make this a good session beer, so I'll have to knock it down a few pegs on drinkability."
"Almost a bit too dry, need some smoothing dessert to come to full right."
"D - Extremely drinkable"
"D: Very drinkable. Sessonable beer, easy to drink 5 or 6."
"D- Eh. Only in the absence of stronger alternatives."
"M and D: The feel is good. Very creamy but with a slightly thinner finish than I'd like it to have. As for drinkability, I'd stick to one or two. It's not that it doesn't go down easy at first. It's just that it is basically a meal in a bottle. Not a session beer at all."
"For a sweet lover not really impressive."
"wonderful beer, highly recommend it"
"D - This a unique beer that is better paired with a desert course. It goes down smoother than expected and is an overall great beer."
"Notes: Honestly, not as good as I remembered it being. I think the nitro-can makes all the difference for this beer. Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer and a real deal too with how """cheap""" it is, but it's not as full and rich as I'd like it to be. I miss the nitro-cans. Haven't had them in VT in over a year."
"Note that this tends to be a little more expensive in certain areas, I typically see it for $9-$10 for a four pack of nitro-cans."
"I poured into my glass to a rich, creamy tan head that cascaded like a waterfall. This is a beautiful beer. It is almost black in color. The smell is dark chocolate. The taste is also rich, dark chocolate. This is the first """dessert""" beer that I ever tried and have loved it since. The mouthfeel is creamy but a bit watery. I have also tried this beer in a bottle and in my opinion tastes completely different. This is just a great, easy drinking beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a brandy glass. With a relatively aggressive pour, it filled the glass and the one-inch head just topped over the rim of the glass. It was a beautiful sight. Smell and taste are underwhelming for what I expected from the title, but it's still a good beer. It's more bitter than expected and the chocolate taste is muc more subtle than expected."
"M - Medium body and not as thick as expected but still very good and nice CO2. Very drinkable."
"Drinks down easy, not nearly as heavy as you'd expect for such a thick and creamy beer. I would definitely recommend it to stout lovers, and will certainly be drinking this one again."
"Final Statement: Started off ok, but ended up being poured out. No drinkability for me at all."
"O: Was a bit disappointed that so little chocolate flavor was delivered, but disregarding the name it is a solid stout."
"D: Super smooth and creamy, great roasted malt and chocolate flavor. This is a really easy beer to drink and enjoy. It doesn't sit heavy in your gut like some stouts can. Very refreshing for a dark beer. This has rocketed to the top of my list of exceptional stouts."
"BOTTLE"
"Oh, and really reminds me of whisky, but I like whisky so it's okay."
"Milk stouts aren't my favorite style, this one to me wasn't much better than the few others I've had."
"Found on tap at the Fredericksburg Pub in Fredericksburg, VA this creamy looking beverage is a thick black color with a big, finely constituted tan head and very nice lacing. The aroma brings out a very tasty chocolate malt and just a hint of leafy hop. The flavor is a very chocolate malted clone with a subtle charcoal aftertaste. This stuff is velvetty smooth and medium bodied for a very sensually creamy experience. Sweet but balanced with a pleasant grass/leaf/citrus hop background. With all it's creaminess it offers a bit of an aqueous touch, with minimum carbonation, that adds to the decided drinkability of this nice brew. I've had this in bottles before, it seemed more syrupy and intense than this, but this may be better, and more sessionable. Very nice, a great desert follow up to dinner without being too sweet."
"Overall, one of my favorite sweet stouts. Would like a bit more chocolate as the name alludes, but still can't complain too much because of the overall experience this offers. Exceptional in my mind and this beer shouldn't disappoint anyone who can appreciate a sweet stout..."
"D - Very very drinkable. The best Stout I've drank so far."
"pours an opaque black color with good off-white to tan frothy head and good lacing that remains. dark chocolate smell and smooth chocolate taste. full bodied with a creamy texture. long flavor duration, chocolate flavor lingers for awhile. light sweet finish. exactly what i expected out of this brew. very good."
"Nitro can poured into a pint glass. Deep, dark brown (might as well be black) with a centimeter of nut brown head after it finishes cooking and excellent retention but not really any lacing. Malty sweet scent with distinct milk chocolate notes and hints of coffee. Creamy mouthfeel but light bodied and very easy to drink. The taste starts out with a fairly straightforward malt sweetness and quickly matures into rich dark chocolate flavors. Great balance between the sweetness of the malt and the bitterness of the dark chocolate. A definite winner and good session beer."
"Drinkability is a little above average, I drank the first pint can in about a minute, but slowed down and got full considerably after the second pint."
"Not very complex but a great beer nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoyed this review. My only complaints is that the mouthful was a bit watery. Other than that, an outstanding stout."
"D: Not bad but not the best sweet stout I've had either. Just a bit to bitter and the mouthfeel was slightly more watery than I was expecting."
"Overall a very solid English stout that deserves a try from any serious beer advocate, as over 1,800 of us already have."
"Drinkability: A very good stout. I would definitely drink more and would definitely recommend this."
"Wow this beer is everything that it says it is. Pours an opaque black with two fingers of off white head. Smells of malt and chocolate. Taste was the same as the smell nothing but malt and chocolate. The mouthfeel was full and silky. Extremely easy to drink. My girlfriend actually enjoyed it and she really doesn't like stouts at all. Guess I'll have to keep this one around."
"D- I enjoyed this with a molten chocolate cake, and they paired well together. I do not know that I would drink this repeatedly or by itself."
"Drinkability- Good drinkability but probably wouldn't more than two though."
"This is a sipping beer that you would only drink one, maybe as a night cap. Very sweet and a nice desert beer. The Yard House serves it as a desert poured over vanilla bean ice cream. A nice spin on a beer float."
"Drinkability: Easy to pass the time drinking a few of these."
"More chocolate in the taste, and really, that's it. A little bit of roasting, not a lot of malt heft though. Even smaller amount of hops. A high degree of sweetness. Mouthfeel is good, but a feeling this would be phenomenal if it was thicker. Drinkable, cost effective, yet a tad too sweet to get itself out of the sipping/desert beer category."
"I'd recommend this beer, especially if mixed with a Back Road Brewery Blueberry Ale. The two mixed together form an """original black and blue""" which is delicious."
"D- I could smell this all day, but drink it.... Lets just say if I could choose to drink one beer a day for 356 day before the day of my death, I don't think I would be choosing this brew. Great price point, 3 bucks at the pub, you cant beat that."
"Drinkability: I went with the 3.5 here -- overall it's not bad, but the taste isn't nearly as good as the smell; the ABV is moderate enough to allow for a couple, but the sweetness and overall weight wouldn't really make me want more than that."
"Pretty much the standard stout taste right away. What makes this stout special is the chocolatey undertones that carry the taste through to the end. Extremely sweet and drinkable, it's like drinking chocolate, but it doesn't overpower the beer as I expected it to. I love this beer, and I'll try it out of the bottle as soon as I can."
"D- Very drinkable. It is well balanced between the bitterness and the sweetness and I could find myself in trouble enjoying a few of these. This is a perfect dessert beer and would also be a great ingredient in a beef stew. I don't even notice the 5.2% alcohol. I will definitely be buying this again and plan on getting some friends to enjoy it with me!"
"I was really excited to give this stout a go and it lived up to my expectations. Poured into a 22 oz glass with a very dark consistency and a light brownish head. Had an excellent aroma of sweet chocolate. Dangerously smooth and addictive. Can't wait to have another."
"D: It started out very interesting but then it was only choholatel I don't know how I can be dissapointed with the dominationg chocolate in a beer that's called """Double Chocolate..."""; but I am..."
"D: Incredibly drinkable, refreshing and smooth. Great beer to drink with meals or to round out the evening."
"In summation, this beer was like the movie Cloverfield. We had been on a stout drinking stint for about a month or so, when we finally decided to end it with, what we figured, would be the ultimate stout. We weren't looking for the strongest, but the chocolateliest. The pour was great. The smell was good as well. However, once the beer hit our tongues, it was less satisfying than Cloverfield was after all the hype. While this beer was full, we found the flavor lacking. The complex and intricate flavors of the drink were a debater's wet dream, but in the end lacked """umpf""". The taste could be best described as subtle at first, with a malty, chocolately flavor, that grows to a fuller stouty flavor that still has chocolate and malt infused. However, the taste is extremely mild, and even takes a bit of concentration to notice, making it a bad drink for nights where one has little moderation."
"One of the best, if not the best, pure chocolate beer out there. It's really only suited as a dessert beer or nightcap. I don't indulge in it often, but I can always count on it for a sweet treat before bed."
"Rich but not to creamy. Head retention was disappointing but probably better if had on tap. Smelled of deep dark chocolate. Tastes like dark chocolate and espresso, with a hint of orange zest and caramels. The espresso lingers. Overall, I really enjoyed the beer and it was very drinkable. they set out to make a double chocolate stout and they pulled it off very well."
"Drinkability - nope, not for me. Let me clear this up - I love stout's - I MEAN LOVE!! but this one is just too much chocolate for me. Would be a great after dinner/dessert type deal but not a session beer for me."
"Drinkability - Pretty drinkable. At only a hair over 5% abv, this is an after dinner beer you can drink for the entire rest of the night. I will for sure seek this out next Christmas for my whole family to enjoy...and enjoy it in large quantities. I should not have put off trying this beer for such a long time, but I'm glad I finally was able to have it. Will buy again if in the mood for such a type of brew."
"Pours a beautiful opaque brown / black with a light tan / mocha head. The appearance though suffers due to a lack of lacing through out the drinking. The beers smells wonderful with aromas of roasted malt, but dominated by chocolate. The body of the beer is fantastically balanced, so perceivable bitterness, but enough there to remove any residual sweetness and let the creamy chocolate flavours come through. Rich and creamy. Great looking and tasting."
"I think I was more disappointed by the fact that I was EXPECTING a chocolate explosion but it was more like an espresso bean only half covered in dark chocolate. I think I was psychologically thrown off by the false advertising. I liked it but I was hoping for more chocolate. The other thing that threw me off was the over carbonation. The body was lighter because of it and it was weird for a stout. It did pour beautifully though. Waterfall cascade of small bubbles like Guinness poured from a nitro tap. Once I got over the labeling though I really liked it. It just wasn't what I was expecting. Highly quaffable, low abv for a session stout."
"This was a good beer to try once, but I don't think i'll be in a hurry to get another one. A nice beer to sip in the evening."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark opaque brown with a very thin light brown head. Aroma was milk chocolate, a la Hershey bar or hot chocolate. Taster alternated between milk chocolate and dark slightly burnt chocolate. Neither was overly sweet or bitter. It felt a bit thin in the mouth and slightly over carbonated. Very easy and pleasant to drink."
"D - Not my favorite. It has quite a few good aspects, unfortunately taste is not one of them."
"D: It's very easy to drink and goes down very smoothly; this is definitely a sessionable beer."
"Young's Double Chocolate Stout is a good chocolate stout. It isn't my favorite but it is a good one. It pours very dark, with a light head that laces the glass. Smells of chocolate, obviously. Taste is bitter, like dark chocolate, but I like it. I don't like this beer as much as Founders Breakfast or Bent River's Uncommon, but this is a very decent beer."
"Dark black/brown in color with a foamy head that lingers nicely. Nice notes of roasted malt with dark and milk chocolate on the nose. Surprisingly thin body, but the malt and chocolate are still in perfect balance and the chocolate finishes well at the end."
"Generally this brew shows the chocolate taste, but it reminds me more of a coffee stout. Didn't really get the sweetness you'd expect with the style - instead it was exceptionally dry, and not particularly flavorful. Body was thick and meaty, but dry, and that made this one a tough one to enjoy much of."
"Da: This was my 3rd beverage after a Founders Dry-Hopped Pale Ale and a Founders Double Trouble DIPA. It fit perfectly at the end of that little session, and would be great with a stogie and a campfire."
"Excellent stout. Able to drink at all times of the year, but better in the winter months. A good summer tip is try serving this stout with a couple of scoops of good vanilla or chocolate ice cream. makes an excellent Stout Float. Friends have thought this crazy, until they tried it."
"Consumed from a tulipesque Aventinus man-glass."
"D: amazing beer!"
"The drinkability takes a bit of a hit from the mouthfeel and slightly weak flavors, but it could definitely be good if it picked it up in those two areas. I think I'm going to have to give Young's another shot, but in the bottle next time. It's a looker as a nitro, but I don't care much for the mouthfeel. The beer has potential, though, so I won't give up."
"D - This is the perfect dessert beer, that's about all I can say. A perfect finish to a nice dinner. Delicious!"
"For how light it is in alcohol, Young's Double Chocolate Stout had the potential to be a new stand-by stout. But the lackluster mouthfeel makes for a fragmented, unfocused brew."
"Beer is smooth and medium to full bodied. The flavor is primarily sweet with tons of chocolate. Its not as bitter as you'd expect a chocolate beer to be. It finishes cleanly and drinkability is high. I expect some roast from my stouts or some bitter from the grains or in this case the chocolate. I know this is a sweet stout and they achieved the sweet for sure. I really enjoyed this beer and I would recommend it to everyone."
"This is such a great, classic, session stout. This will totally be kept in my kitchen."
"d - A very enjoyable stout. Light body, cheap, and easy to drink with a low ABV, this is a great buy, definitely worth checking out."
"D- very drinkable. it isn't too heavy and has a very nice taste."
"Drinkability: Young's Double Chocolate is very drinkable, especially from the nitro-can. We buy this regularly for use in stout floats, but it's good enough on it's own. This stout won't leave you feeling heavy, buzzed, or bloated."
"D - For being called double chocolate its not that strong of a chocolate flavor. Its a nice low ABV stout."
"Very easy to drink. Goes down easy with only moderate alcohol."
"D - I may have this a lot now. Now that I love chocolate stouts this one is right in the middle. It's cheap and has flavor yet not too much alcohol so you can drink plenty! Proust!"
"Thinner than I expected, not creamy at all, not very smooth either. The carbonation also seems off. Not very enjoyable."
"Overall Impression: If you love chocolate the way I do, than this is the beer for you. If you get it in the Nitro Can, it is even smoother, creamier & more decadent - Uber Good!"
"A very drinkable beer I would really like to talk to someone who doesn't like stouts and doesn't love this bad boy. Such amazing texture and taste it's crazy."
"I am not a big fan of the heavier stouts. But I really like this one. The chocolate flavor really comes through the minute it touches your lips. The beer is extremely drinkable. It's got a tad too much carbonated taste, but the chocolate favor and the smoothness of the beer overcome that. I definitely would recommend letting the beer breath a little bit in the glass before drinking it."
"Notes: Very nice beer that combines the bitterness and sweetness of chocolate well. A little too thin and watery, but it has enough creaminess and flavor to compensate for that. Very nice beer, especially if you like chocolate."
"D: Very drinkable, tastes great, definitely would have another."
"D - Not good enough to do more than this one can, not getting it again."
"Pours from the can a very dark brown with a pretty cream head that lasts for a short while. The smell brings forward roasted chocolate, but not too much else. THe taste is quite similar with a bit too much of an astringent bitterness, which I assume is from the chocolate. The mouthfeel is somewhat saving, being a nice creamy ale; however, drinkability is fairly low as a result of the almost tannic dryness and bitterness to this."
"The aroma has chocolate, coffee, burnt malt, and cream. The appearance is black with a nice nitro foamy head. The taste is like the aroma with the chocolate hitting you at the end. The palate is smooth but not as thick as I would like for the style. Overall a nice beer."
"D - good as a desert beer in small amounts. The amount in the bottle is good to split between two people. You can feel the texture of the particles from whatever was added to enhance the flavor (chocolate)."
"~Cheers"
"Great chocolate stout. Very drinkable, though I'd say it's a little too heavy to session."
"D: best beer i've had in a while. should have bought 2. more like a dessert than a typical beer."
"D: An easy drinking sweet stout. It's sort of a novelty with the huge chocolate presence, but it's a cool treat to have from time to time, especially paired with dessert."
"Went down smooth though. This beer's a great ride."
"D: It's easy to drink and tasty, but not really worth getting again, tough call."
"Unfortunatly I didn't get much from this beer. I do understand other people love this beer, but i guess it wasn't for me..."
"Overall, an excellent beer, perfectly enjoyable on every occasion."
"Mouth/Drink: Silky smooth. Light bodied, insanely drinkable."
"Pours nearly pitch black with a mocha colored, one finger head. Not a very strong smell, but the cocoa is there. Tastes...actually kind of bland. I don't taste any sort of hops whatsoever. Its just muted chocolate. It feels really weird in my mouth. However, its ridiculously drinkable because it doesn't feel like you're drinking beer at all."
"D- This one just kept on getting better with the more I drank. I think this would be an excellent beer for anyone looking to try a darker beer, hell this would be a good choice for anybody looking to convert a BMC drinker."
"Drinkability: Wonderfully drinkable stout and one i would drink often if it weren't for the price - $US 5.00 a bottle..."
"d - could drink this all day (and have a few times)! great on cold winter afternoons, though it's light enough to be had most any time of year, or as an after dinner treat. near the top of the style as far as i'm concerned. a must try for any stout lover."
"D - All nitro-can brews taste this good, right? If there was ever a session dessert beer, this is probably it. Your waistline may not appreciate that though. :-)"
"The taste is light, so I would score the bottle higher overall. That being said, it's still wonderful and enormously drinkable out of the can. I've always been a fan of this beer."
"This is a wonderful treat of a beer nonetheless. It would pair superbly with a dessert, or as dessert itself."
"SKÅL!!"
"Notes: beer may have been somewhat past its freshness, also, the taste changed a lot with temperature. The colder it was, the more chocolate I could taste (I had it in a glass as I took notes and drank what as left out of the bottle later, it was more chilled then)."
"Fairly disappointed, though I will remain a devotee of the draught. If anyone has a suggestion on how to bring more out of the bottled version - please let me know!"
"Drinks well-definitely a good car bomb beer for its creamy body."
"D- Not bad, would I have another, of course, but I prefer Rogue's Chocolate Stout over this one."
"d - i would like to but a bottle next time i make a beer run. i cant believe i have past this one up over the years."
"Pleasant beer."
"If a """double""" chocolate stout could be a session beer, this would be it. Young's Double Chocolate Stout is easy to drink, refreshing, and as stouts go, would be enjoyable on a hot summer day."
"Very easy to drink, shame it's so dang pricey. Well with seeking out and trying."
"D - it is so thin that it almost seems like a light beer. Maybe as a mild dessert drink... but I will probably pass"
"D: been meaning to try this beer for some time and, admittedly, underwhelmed, decent but probably won't return to it"
"500ml bottle from the LCBO. Black in colour with brown hues and a ring of dark tan head. Speckles of lacing on the nonic. Smell is barley, baking sugar, milk chocolate, and cocoa. Excellent roasted malt flavour, charred and smokey, touch of chocolate, toasted oats (nutty), dry hop finish with some spice and chalk. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied, a little bite followed by a parched and malty aftertaste. Very low bitterness. Sweet, dry, chocolatey, roasted. Ultra tasty stout. Nothing to dislike here, just a classic session brew."
"well if you want chocolate this is a pretty decent beer well worth trying with little doubt"
"D: A satisfying, one-and-done dessert in a bottle. Very well-balanced. Takes the phrase """I'm like a chocoholic, but for booze""" to a whole new level."
"D: It's a bit too sweet for me, but I know many people who would drink several of these in a session."
"D: For what this is, it is great. A nice chocolate beer which goes great with desert. I prefer a nice stout which has coca in there as well, but for the style not much to complain about here. I think I still prefer the Brooklyn chocolate though. The best thing about this beer is the head."
"really disappointed w/this brew."
"Very smooth and drinkable. I could sit and take in the aroma for a while, but the comparatively disappointing taste means I probably won't be having these too often."
"D: Slightly chilled, this stout is a bit more drinkable than at room temperature. Not to say that it isn't drinkable at room temperature; it certainly is. Chocolate lovers, however, will find that the alcohol flavor is nonexistent if it is chilled, and that the chocolate flavors are enhanced. The light mouthfeel may be a plus for some chocolate fans who are more concerned about the rich chocolatey taste. The light mouthfeel makes this an easily drinkable, chocolatey ale. I'll be trying it chilled on a warm day to see if it is as drinkable as it is now in February."
"Drinkability and mouthfeel is great."
"Dark brown with a tall sticky head of large tan bubbles. The nose is somewhat muted, with notes of bittersweet chocolate, iron, and brew salts. This is a pretty sweet Sweet Stout, with very little besides lightly sweet and moderately bitter cacao flavors. Just a hair on the light side in the mouthfeel but I like it more as it approaches room temp. Not the finest stout in the world but a very drinkable sweet stout."
"Well, I'm sold, this did the trick, a lovely chocolate stout out of England in a CAN. I think I found a contender for a case pick up for the rest of the winter. The 5.2% helps things for the drink on this, either two or three a night."
"I personally like it at the same temp as a properly tapped Guinness. The richness of the flavor seems to decline with the as the temperature drops. If you pour this from a nitro-can, I recommend allowing it to settle, and then let it sit another couple of minutes. Why? I can't say exactly. If nothing else it just seems more professional !"
"Overall- A very eye opening experience. I always thought that sweet stouts and chocolate stouts were kind of girly and prissy beers but this is so good I wouldn't care if someone made fun of me for drinking it. It is so good that my girlfriend (who only drinks Bud-light and Corona light) said it was definitely interesting which means she kind of likes it usually when she tries a beer of mine she makes this face like a kid taking medicine. That is a huge step and I think that I can start weening her into appreciating good beer with more complex concoctions like this she is by nature a whisky and wine girl. This was like I said my first experience with a Chocolate stout and it has made me want to seek out more examples of this style. If I find this in Nitro cans out here I will definitely try that because I bet this stuff would be awesome with nitro!"
"Wow, this pours into a beautiful cascading foam dark liquid. Just beautiful. Wonderful chocolate smell as well a a nearly perfect chocolate taste. Goes down very easy but is a rich drink so not one you can drink lots of in one sitting. I perfect desert beer. Something to finish a good meal with."
"Taste is like a chalky and mineraly version of a Hershey's dark chocolate bar. Not a whole lot of sweetness here and has some roast and mild alcohol flavors on the aftertaste. Pretty dry for a chocolate stout, but fairly tasty. Very easy to drink and before you knew it, two or three would be empty. A good beer and definitely a classic."
"I ate a nice big chocolate brownie while I was quaffing it, and it was a very nice combo."
"First off the apppearance is perfect. Dark black with a finger width cream colored head with great retention through the whole drink and heavy lacing. Exactly what a stout should look like. A beautiful beer. Strong chocolate taste with coffee notes. A delicious beer. My only negative would be its a little too creamy and because of that I wouldn't want more than one. That being said its a great beer and I will definately drink it again."
"Poured pitch black with probably the thickest head I've ever seen on a beer. Tan and creamy and clung to the glass throughout both servings. Loaded with the smell of dark chocolate and oatmeal and some dried fruit notes. Great taste pretty close to the aroma with a long, semi-sweet finish with a touch of brown sugar on it. Very smooth without a trace of alcohol makes this very easy to drink too quickly, but definitely one you want to savor."
"Drink: Surprisingly smooth, only a hint of bitterness at the end."
"Taste is very roasty and chocolaty without much bitterness. Not as much chocolate as southern tier choklate but it's still a good beer for what it is."
"Tons of chocolate, thin body and low alcohol make this too gulpable, like the aforementioned Ovaltine. My 3-year son would love this."
"It's a fine beer, but not one I'd be having unless I had the crave."
"D: Not very drinkable at all. Had with lunch (so I should have been thirsty, right?) and almost left half the glass on the table. I thought I'd try this one though it hadn't jumped out at me to buy in the store, and I guess my initial instincts had been correct. I'd heard that this one was supposed to be decent, too. I wonder what went wrong."
"Thick, bready mouthfeel. Smooth, endlessly drinkable. Nothing else I could want from a stout. Simply the best stout I've had and superior on tap."
"Nitro-can, to me, provides a different texture & mouthfeel, but from bottle or can, the Double Chocolate is good stuff to satisfy a combined beer & chocolate craving."
"D: Nice smell and flavor with a creamy finish leads to good drinkability. It's not a beer I would drink every day, but good none the less."
"A thin but creamy mouthfeel makes for an easy drinking experience as this pint disappeared in a hurry. This stout is a good choice on a cold winters night."
"I just don't think this is an excellent brew (deserving of an A). I can't bring myself to. A for average in my notebook."
"I would probably drink it again but based entirely on the price and convenience in getting it. Overall a decent stout."
"All in all, this is a great crossover brew. If you are trying to convert from a mainstream beer like Bud, this might be a good choice. If you currently enjoy craft brews, then I would not recommend."
"D: Yes. And lots of it. Relatively low ABV mixed with superior flavor and that KY-caliber mouthfeel makes for one serious repeat offender."
"[Drinkability] - Very drinkable due to the thinner mouthfeel. This is however, a turn-off for the stout style. A slightly bland chocolate stout. Sounds english to me."
"This brew is almost like a dessert in a glass; awesome chocolate flavor. This brew is a top notch brew. Maybe the best of its style I have had. One of the best stouts I have had for sure."
"D: I don't there is anything exceptional about these beer, but it is well made. Price point is also good."
"Notes: A superb beer because of it's chocolate qualities, but also a great beer simply for its genuine and well-done stout characteristics. It's a fine dessert beer, to be sure, but don't relegate it to that purpose alone. Think of it too when you just want a good stout, chocolate or not."
"d- great drinkability, this is a nice dessert beer, i can only imagine what this beer would be like in a milkshake. the flavors are all here, although more subdued then i thought they would be, i'm still really enjoying it though. this was a nitro-can, i have a bottled version in the fridge that i will have to compare and see which i liked better.."
"Overall, rather impressed with this humble brew. Had it two times from the bottle and wasn't impressed. From the nitro-can, I let it warm up a bit and the beer really came through for me. Good stuff."
"Artificial tasting, lame, and unappealing. Not a horrible drainpour, but, at least based on BA ratings, way overrated. Read a blog on the net recently where Raspy Anniversary Stout was compared to this. What planet was that guy on?"
"O: A beautiful beer that was ruined by overly strong carbon flavors which mask any of the desirable flavors of the Maillard reaction. I love this style and can see why some love this beer, but the carbonized flavor makes this a deal breaker for me."
"This is a delicious beer. This is what I would call the epitome of a """dessert""" beer. That is, a beer you have FOR dessert, not with it. It's only downfall is the lack of complexity, relying instead on sweetness to satisfy."
"OK this beer has been reviewed 1000+ times now and believe me nothing i say can really add to what people have already said. That being said if you are really still reading this my only real thoughts are that its a good chocolate stout, just not as good as rogue. Though the price is tantalizingly good."
"It's a very reasonably priced bomber $2.99, and I enjoyed drinking it, but it's not my personal preference. That said, I can easily seeing myself in the mood for this one on occasion."
"M/D - The mouthfeel is quite thick and rich coating the mouth and tongue. This is as drinkable as a thin milkshake. Some have the stomach for it, some don't."
"Final Thought: I can understand it's popularity but don't see it as """upper echelon"""."
"great beer!"
"D: Could definitely see myself going through a couple of these without even realizing it (except for the grabbing of a second bottle aspect). And wouldn't feel bad for the price..."
"Drinkability: An exceptional stout. This one is certainly a treat to have and goes great with dessert."
"D: I was thinking I may find this stout TOO sweet, but the chocolate and slight bitterness came together perfectly."
"D - Drinkability is (almost) through the roof with this beer! Very affordable, with a pretty low ABV, and as good as it tastes...I could drink it all day long. If you haven't had it yet, get it!"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a wonderful black color, completely nontransparent with a 3 finger light brown head that slowly crawled back down the glass leaving sticky goodness down the sides. The aroma was first full of alcohol, then some hints of roasted chocolate malts and a slight burnt caramel and doughy finish. The taste was smooth, with mild carbonation. The finish makes this brew. Dark chocolate, raspberry, warmth from alcohol, and a nice bitter balance. This is a tasty brew! Bonus that it comes in a 1 pint 9oz bottle, worth the $2.99 a bottle."
"Drinkability pretty high i wouldnt want this to be the only beer i ever drink. But I would drink a few in a night for sure."
"Drinkability is great! Definite session beer as I feel I could put away quite a few of these in short time! Avery nice example of the style. I'll have to try it in the bottle to see if I find difference but for now quite a nice brew."
"D - Pretty high. I'd have this again for sure. Maybe wouldn't want it all night but it was a great finisher and went really well with a burger too. I'm gonna try it in a bottle next time I see it just to compare... I suspect it shines on nitro much more??"
"D: A strong beer (taste). The taste was good but it almost felt a little artificial at times."
"Served clean not so carbonated and definitely a small head after the pour. Great aroma of chocolate reaffirms the great taste in this stout. Slight bitterness in the end of every sip but overall a great drinking beer."
"Thoughts: I have had this beer in the bottle and in the nitro can. The bottle has a much better flavor but just doest have the same creaminess. I still like this beer, and will recommend it to anyone."
"Poured a dark mahogany/near-black into a dimpled mug, with one finger of khaki-colored head, and great lacing. The smell was dominated by bittersweet chocolate and cocoa powder, but roasted malts and a hint of espresso were also evident. The taste was very good, but very one-dimensionally dominated by chocolate, with just a hint of roasted malt and coffee. The mouthfeel was the best part: silky smooth and creamy thick; a perfect accompaniment to dessert. Drinkability? Definitely not a session beer; even this one can I shared with a friend."
"D- Very drinkable, not thoroughly enjoyable though. I was expecting a little more """umph""" in the flavour department--whether that's due to the nitro, or just the beer I am unsure."
"I was really let down by this brew - and I didn't even have any, let alone high, expectations going in. Poured well with a solid, yet quickly receding head. Smells like burnt nesquick. Tastes like chemical chocolate powder in water. WAY to thin of a body for the style. Overall, it seems like they went for some chocolate powder flavoring instead of properly malting a beer of this style. Would not return to again, especially at $6 for a bottle - I could have had 3 Victory Storm Kings for that!"
"Overall - Nice brew but I could really use some more body here. Also, more chocolate malt and less chocolate flavoring would be nice. IMO Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout is a way better chocolate stout."
"Mouthfeel was creamy but somewhat thin. I will return to this one."
"Drinkability - Too novel for common consumption, but worth saving for special occasions"
"D: easy dessert beer, worth picking up a four pack or two"
"Just a terrific beer, one I will get again and again. Although I was worried that the beer would simply taste like chocolate, I was most happily corrected! A real winner (the only drawback being that I doubt I could drink this brew for too often at a time)"
"D- My favorite stout. Very rich but not too heavy. One or two of these is plenty, even as good as it is because of the richness."
"O- This is a good standby chocolate beer. Wonderful for a chocolate craving."
"Poured darkest of brown, like one shade from black. There is a lot of chocolate in the nose. It's a very milky, cocoa chocolate. The taste is supreme, nice chewy mouthfeel with little bubbles. Very silky texture. Fudge in the taste with cocoa nibs, Swiss mocha and Hershey's milk chocolate. Very drinkable as a beer but the sweetness and overall character make this a 1 bottle at a time type brew. Not the kind of beer you would want to drink 2 or 3 of, still very drinkable for the style though."
"A brilliant coffee cascade and the brew carbonates. The chocolaty head caps a nice black brew and sticks to the top of the beer 'til the end. The aromas are really quite absent, which is surprising given the representation of flavors. The bitter chocolate notes are married well with coffee, toasted nuts, and mild malts. The coffee aftertaste is very pleasant. This offering is a nice comforting winter choice that is not too heavy for the style and is overall a very good beer."
"If you haven't tried it, try it!"
"Cheers!"
"The mouth is thin and wet. I expected this to be a bit thicker. Carbonation level is moderate. Flavors of chocolate milk, vanilla, white bread, and a bit of nutty finish. This is pretty good and unoffensive. Not a bad beer to help convert some to darker brews. Chocolate not as predominate as I thought. I'd have it again, but it's not as great as I assumed."
"This beer is a great looking pour. Dark, dark brown in color with 1 finger of creamy head that hangs around all day. Smells very sweet and creamy, like a milkshake, with subtle hints of roasted malt and malted milk balls. The taste is initially sweet and creamy before fading into a slightly bitter, roasted finish that is slightly lingering. Body and balance are good, although the sweetness boarders on excessive and hurts the drinkability a bit. Other than than minor complaint, this is a very tasty beer."
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - Indeed, if I'm in the mood for a chocolate stout, would definitely think about this one again - I preferred the nitrous cans over the bomber."
"Overall: Got the indian shooting the star on this one, liquid tootsie pop that tastes quite good but don't over indulge because the flavor will weigh on you unless you have a severe sweet tooth when it comes to beer."
"D- Not a bad chocolate flavored stout, is really nice with some pretzels; makes a sort-of chocolate covered pretzel."
"D: A good sweet stout with heavy chocolate which unfortunately loses some of the creaminess with the chocolate addition. A good but not great brew."
"Drinkability: I would say this has a high drinkability especially for the novice beer drinker because of the sweet chocolate taste, it can be very easy for them to branch out from piss water light."
"D = Overall, a very tasty beer that I am enjoying very much as I write this. I would definitely come back to this one on occasion. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: This stuff is OK. At almost $5 a bottle, its not a great value. I expected a sweeter chocolatey stout. Its very English."
"D- Drinks just as smooth as it pours. I enjoy my stouts warm which i personally feel attributes to the smoothness of the drink."
"Completely unimpressed. This is one of my favorite beers when it's from the bottle, but the nitro can serving just completely ruins it."
".5 L bottle poured nearly pitch black. Tan foamy head that settles quickly and leaves scattered lacing. Smell is mostly of chocolate and a little burnt coffee. Taste is similar, the chocolate dominates but still some bitter roasted notes in there. Very carbonated, this intensifies the bitterness. Medium bodied and still smooth. Goes down quick but does not really quench thirst. Overall a good quality stout,but nothing too interesting or anything to write home about."
"(D)- A good chocolatey stout that is easy on the palate. Would never turn this down if offered to me. A decent session stout"
"500mL bottle, Nov. 3, 2009"
"Summary: One of the best stouts I have had in quite awhile. Incredible mouthfeel and drinkability. I would reccomend this to anyone who appreciates a sweet stout that's not yet imperial strength.. Perhaps a little to decadent to have frequently, but overall, great. I'll buy again."
"(need more beer experience)"
"The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and the body isn't too heavy. Drinkability is good. All in all, this is good chocolate stout, but nothing really seems to stand out. After having had Southern Tier's Chocolate and Ommegang's Chocolate Indulgence I would recommend those over this. But if this is easy for you to pick up and you're in the mood for chocolate and beer, then I say go for it."
"It's pretty good overall. I prefer other milk and sweet stouts to this, but won't hesitate to try it again."
"altogether one damn fine beer. deliscious chocolatiness, nuff said."
"D - Good drinkability, rather tasty, will definitely have this as opposed to the can."
"D- I actually liked this beer. I wouldn't think that I would like it since it sounded super chocolaty and sweet at first but now I see it is balanced fairly well. Will pick this up again next time I am in the moon for something creamy and chocolaty. Maybe next time I will get it in the can since it seems that isn't bad either."
"Considering how thin this beer is it goes down real easy, so I can easily see myself drinking 2 or 3 of these... if I liked it more."
"Overall it is just slightly better than the bottle, a nice smooth and rich dessert brew."
"Not the best value as an import, especially compared to Rogue Chocolate Stout for example - still, worth a try."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Its a good stout, thick and creamy."
"Pours beautifully into a standard pint glass, dark as tar not much head, but incredible lacing. Smells of chocolate and not much else. Tastes like dark chocolate, very rich, smooth and creamy. Perhaps not an ale for everyday drinking, but a very nice one for special occasions, perfect for pairing with deserts."
"Has a fine carbonation with a very creamy medium body. Overall this is a pretty nice little treat. Food for thought, the nitro-cans cost around one-third less than the bottles."
"Drinkability: Full bodied very smooth and sweet stout with the significant chocolate aroma. Very delicious."
"FOLLOW UP: as this warms the chocolate flavor Really comes out."
"Young's Double Chocolate stout pours super dark with an excellent thick tan head that remains until the beer is gone. Head has good creamy flavor and smells like chocolate(no surprise there). It's reminiscent of """dark""" chocolate flavors. Best if drank very cold IMO. One of my favorite and consistent stouts."
"Very thin and light not a thick feeling ton the tounge at all. Goes down smooth as silk."
"Drinkability: Avery good stout. Decently sweet, smokey, and “chocolatey”, but not as much as a milk/sweet stout should be. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"The beer benefits from being on nitro. Has the wonderful looking cascading head that settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The beer itself is very dark. The aroma consists of dark, chocolate malt with hints of floral hops. Rather timid with its aromas. Definate chocolate qualities in the flavor. Roasted malt compliments the chocolate as well. It is sweet in the front with hop flavor and bitterness in the finish. Love the English hops. Not as chocolaty as I was expecting but rather a nice sweet stout with a lot of balance. Even with the benefit of nitro this beer feels thin but it maintains a nice soft texture that is pleasing. Not every stout has to be an ABV monster and this is a perfect example of less is more. Very easy drinking."
"D- Drinking the whole bottle is not a problem. The flavors and smells get better as the beer warms. I hope I can find this beer around my area so I can drink it again. Next time I'll pour it closer to room temperature."
"Drinkability: You know a beer is good, when my girlfriend will try out a """dark""" beer and actually like it. Score one (hell, make it two) for Young's. Only wish i had the ability to buy this more often. Can't go wrong with this one."
"D: this beer is ritch and smooth also i can drink many of these no problem yum"
"In the end I would recommend this beer on Nitro tap. Offering a much preferred texture and clarity of flavor."
"D: Rock solid brew that I was glad to have finally tried. Have to admit I'm a much bigger fan of Bell's Cream Stouts (Kalamazoo and Double Cream) but this chocolate milk/ low carbonation take was interesting. Not a must try but definitely worth a shot for its uniqueness if you're a Stout lover like me."
"Normally I find that it is difficult for me to drink sweet beer in quantity. Perhaps it is the stoutness of its character that makes this one an exception. Yes, it is chocolate, and in that manner there is a sweetness to it, but the focus seems to be more on the savory qualities of chocolate and there is just enough bitterness to the stout to keep the palate fresh. On more than one occassion have I put several of these away, one after another, in the course of an evening. Definitely a treat, and definitely a good one to have on hand for dessert, for the holidays, or for a cool evening."
"This is very dark...basically completely opaque. There is a dark mahogany on the bottom edge of the glass...and this is when held directly in light. Rich and creamy looking tan head. I didn't really notice any appreciable lacing. Smells of sweet chocolate. Bitter cocoa taste is most dominant. I also get some smokiness along with a hint of coffee. Has a pretty dry finish. I had the 16.9oz. bottle and thought it had a little too much carbonation. It gave it the illusion of being thick and creamy, but I would have prefered it just be a thicker viscosity. Still this is a really good beer."
"I could probably down an entire four-pack of these puppies in a sitting, but I think that it might get just a tad old by the end. Damn good beer, though."
"Poured into my st bernardus chalice,poured pitch black about a one finger head from a slightly aggreesive pour,smell was of malt dark chocolate and coffee,taste was very smoth with little carbonation,due to the nitro can,would like to try it in a bottle,taste was of coffee and bitter sweet chocolate,with a nice roasted and smokey after taste,as it warms I get a lot more of the chocolate,overall a pretty nice and very drinkable stout!"
"Drinkability: Very good session beer. Very drinkable almost like a chocolate milk shake."
"Overall, an excellent stout. Perfect amount of sweetness and a pleasant dry hoppy finish to balance. They didn't try to make it overly sweet which is the downfall for me in most stouts I've had. Seems like an excellent dessert beer."
"All around a very pleasant stout and dangerously easy to drink. For what it is, it's delicious even if it leaves me wanting just a little something more."
"Drink: The light body makes it very drinkable, and the interesting flavors make you want to drink more! A preferable stout for sessions."
"I love this beer, I can get it cheap at a local bar. The look of it is extremely dark with chocolate head. Decent lacing, this one looks good. It smells like smei-sweet chocolate-covered coffee beans. It tastes even better, with a nice balance of dark chocolate, a bit of hops, and some coffee and smoke notes. Delicious with a coating, medium body, this one goes down smooth. It lingers nicely, makes for a good night."
"Drinkability - This is one to have with food. I had it with a burger and fries for an adult version of chocolate shake with the meal. And it did not disappoint. However, given the price of the beer this is one for special occasions, not a routine brew - despite it's high quality. So while I greatly enjoyed it I can't rate it highest on drinkability."
"D: Very drinkable beer. I could drink this all night if I could afford to."
"Drinkability - Drinkable, very filling."
"Overall this was a better nitro experience than some of the other beers I have had on nitro. The chocolate flavors hold up, and although they are decreased some, this may actually make the beer a bit more drinkable. I would try this again, although with 49 other draft selections at the bar I was at, it may take awhile before I get to it again."
"Awesome creamy smooth mouthfeel from the nitrogen, very drinkable, this beats the bottled version hands down."
"I would drink this beer with icecream! Excelent"
"Drinkability: Nice and creamy, this along with ST Choklat are my two favorite chocolate stouts. I could have two or three before I would want to move on. If you like a complex chocolate dessert, this is a great beer for you."
"Conclusion: Highly drinkable and tasty milk/sweet stout; the chocolate is nice and clearly present but not overpowering...years ago this was one of my favorites...now after getting a taste for much fuller/heavier/richer stouts this doesn't seem quite as killer, but it's still damn tasty...paired this with some English toffee and it was great."
"This is a beer that was meant to be enjoyed on-tap. Night and day between this and the bottle version. This tasted much richer and fuller. Nice chocolaty taste, without being too sweet. A little bitterness and some roasted qualities. However chocolate is the main component here, as you would expect. Don't pass on this one if you see it on the tap list."
"~ Purchased this bottle at Shoreline Beverage in Huntington, NY. Chocolatey, smooth, rich, and creamy are the best words to describe this classic stout. I wonder how much better this would be if the 5.2% ABV was bumped up a couple notches? Still, a real pleasure to drink, and I see myself revisiting this one again really soon! ~"
"I could drink these all night long--and in fact, I did. If you can find this on tap anywhere, please give it a try!"
"This beer is completely opaque. It's just black, and even held to the light, no colour highlights show. It pours with an enourmous tan head. The head has good retention, but doesn't leave a whole lot of lace. It smells of sweet chocolate and roasted malt, with a fruit character coming out as it warms. This beer has a nice subtle cocoa flavour to it, balanced nicely by bitter black coffee. There's a touch of sweetness to it, like molasses. As it warms, the coffee bitterness becomes a bit more forward. Chocolate? Coffee? It's damned near perfect and sublime and so much greater than the sum of its constituent parts. Like cafe mocha, chocolate covered coffee beans, or chocolate cake paired with coffee. Unless you don't like either chocolate or coffee to begin with, it's impossible not to like coffee and chocolate together. It feels smooth, but somewhat light in body. It doesn't leave me feeling full. This is a good thing, because it means you can easily have more than one. Trust me, you'll want more than one. I'm conflicted though, because I'd still love it if it were a bit chewier."
"D - Pretty good. It's smooth and has a wonderful flavor. I had to knock it down a little bit since it's not the type of flavor that I can drink a few of, but it's very good."
"D: A very nice sweet, chocolatey stout. A good stand-by."
"So easy to drink and be satisfied. This one hits on all cylinders. Dry and refreshing. Nicely carbonated. Enough weight to keep from being water but light enough to quaff and session."
"I wasn't at all impressed with this beer. It looked very promising, poured thick and black. It smelled fairly decent as well, chocolaty, as the label promises. The taste was a disappointment to me. There was no chocolate taste and little malt. It was very watery and not at all satisfying. I gave it a good drinkability because its easy to throw back, but neither I or my roommate finished our glasses. It's just not worth the space in my stomach."
"M&D - Smooth, thick rich as it foams up in my mouth. Went down very easily and went wonderfully with some soft oatmeal raisin cookies."
"Served in a standard pint. Poured one shade shy of black, with a dense, unblemished, tan-colored cap. Thick, consistent sheets of lacing were revealed during the session. Nose was roasty, cocoa and a little nutty. Taste consistent with nose, but a little more watered down. Mouthfeel fell between light and medium with a very creamy texture. Really nice and sessionable and even better on nitro I have to say."
"Superbly drinkable and excellent combined with coffee ice cream with dark chocolate chips. Still, the carbonation detracts a little from the overall impression as opposed to the nitro version, which is much more dessert-like. Overall, though, this remains one of my favorite stouts, and is a wonderful dessert beer and perhaps a great intro to good beer for those uninitiated out there."
"Drinkability, for a stout, is dead on. Enough complexity of flavor to make it a rewarding sipper, but light enough and low alcohol to render feasible an entire hot afternoon, cracking can after can after can of this delicious, fantastic, amazing brew! Great job, W&Y's!"
"Good beer but one sided for me and it would be hard to have more than one of these unique pint sized bottles a sitting."
"Overall, it's an awesome stout that smells and tastes great. I can easily see myself drinking two or more of these in one session without getting that filled-up feeling that Guinness typically gives me."
"Cheers!"
"D: Other than it seems filling, pretty good. Friendly."
"While it is being poured, it looks and smells reminescent of dark chocolate milk. As it enters the glass, it has a much lighter brown color from the nitro that is not yet released from the liquid. After it settles, it takes on a nearly black color with dark brown around the edges. Boasts a 1 finger silky cream head that is slightly tanned. Leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass after every sip. The head remains solid until the very end. Mouthfeel is very light and carbination is somewhat tingly. A very easy drinking beer. Taste is somewhat lacking when compared to the presentation given by everything else this beer has to offer. However, the taste does have very minor hop bitterness with traces of burnt barely and chocolate."
"This beer is definitely a very good one, from first sip to last. However, my experience with this one is that it not one to have too often. Very flat tasting, low carbonation. Dark and oqaque when poured into a glass. Think dark chocolate, molasses and black, black coffee taste, very in your face yet SUPER drinkable for some reason. Try it out, I recommend!"
"D - It tastes like nothing and could drink a lot of this because of that, but it's not a good beer. This gets so much love and this is the second time I've wasted money on this beer. Weak as a chocolate beer, weak as a sweet stout, weak as a beer. Avoid."
"A very nice dessert beer."
"*- WOW! I've been a fan of Irish dry stouts and have wanted to try this for a long time, and I'm glad I did! I never knew a stout could have such a interesting and decisive character and profile like this beer did."
"D - Probably to sweet to drink lots, I love it with chocolatey desserts."
"This is an easy drinker, great for desert or paired with vanilla ice cream in a beer float (i speak from experience). I found this one a bit more rich and chocolatey on-tap than from the can. On-tap it tastes like a hershey bar. Still an excellent sweet stout."
"Summary, a good stout. Wish I grabbed a couple more before I left to go back home."
"Overall, I love this beer, just in small doses, which isn't a bad thing. Decadence is something that is great to enjoy, just better when moderated."
"D: solid sweet stout that's easy to find and not too expensive for an import. Bottle is definitely a step up."
"The dark chocolate taste is apparent but balanced with the lovely roasted malt flavors. The beer has a nice consistency in the mouth with the thickness and bubbles coming together nicely. The carbonation virtually dances on the tongue. I could drink this beer everyday, but not en masse."
"The mouthfeel is quite thin and light-bodied. A decent amount of carbonation going on in the mouth; thought I'd be a bit thicker and chewier before trying, but no complaints here. The drinkability is very, very high. At least two bottles per person, pending on their enjoyability. Very smooth and great drinking. Consider it for a night's session."
"The mouthfeel is good and it is very drinkable. This is a really good stout."
"I could drink this all day and all night."
"This stout pours jet black in colour with a thick marble tan head with good retention and leaves some very pretty sticky lacing all the way down my glass. Smell is is rich milk chocolate malts with a touch of minerality and slight grassy hop twang. Taste is, indeed, full of beautiful milk chocolate flavours with just the slightest hint of dark fruits in the background (raisins). Mid sip reveals some roasted espresso with a good amount of bitter hops taking over on the finish. The linger is crisp with a touch of oily chocolate that pleasnatly soothes the palate. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy with tiny little bubbles that give the beer a crisp mid-palate, making way for an oily, mouth-coating finish. This stout is immensely drinkable. A good amount of complexity for a milk stout with a manageable 5.2% ABV makes this a very enjoyable session stout. Despite it's weight, I feel that I could easily throw back a few of these. A very well crafted stout. Highly recommended."
"Overall, a splened brew and a fine represetation of style."
"I am just amazed at how good this beer is. Dark and sweet. Great tastes of chocolate with such great aroma. A friend first gave me one of these a year or so ago and what a friend indeed. A little on the pricey side.. about $10 for a 4 pack but well worth it."
"I have to say, this is still one of my favorite sweet stouts of all time. Still the beer I have in my fridge most often. Still my go-to session stout that I can have a couple of and not worry about feeling worse for wear. I wish I had a tap of this at my house. Good thing I can find it on tap at 2-3 locations locally and for reasonable prices."
"Dark black with a typical creamy nitro head made of tiny bubbles. Smells more like chocolate milk than milk chocolate, very sweet. More bitterness and alcohol in the taste, but still very sweet with some cinnamon and vanilla in there as well. No carbonation bite due to the nitro can, I know its typical, but its not desirable to me. Drinkable enough, if this kind of beer is your thing. Its fine for me every once in a while, but I won't go out of my way."
"Tastes like a sweet stout and you notice he alcohol but it's not bad. Like the name says tastes like chocolate and a stout. I like this. I think I like sweet stouts alot. This is very drinkable. Mouthfeel is really smooth like a stout usually is. If you like guinness try this."
"Notes: This beer is far less impressive in a bottle or when propelled by CO2 on draft."
"taste is thick, very chocolaty, a touch of vanilla, a little roastiness in the back, some coffee, and sour malt, ends a little dry and bitter."
"This by far is the best stout I've had to date and I simply find it hard to believe that it gets better. On my next stop though the liquor store I'll be picking up another for a nice quiet night home."
"Drinkability: the bitterness of the finish detracts a bit from what would otherwise be a well-balanced beer. This reduces the drinkability a bit in my opinion; perhaps paired with a relatively non-sweet dessert this could work quite well."
"As much as I was surprised to like this sweet stout, the second one didn't go down as well as the first... just too sweet for more than one, I guess. Like drinking a second milk shake. But I know I'll enjoy this one again...just one at a time."
"I would recommend it to someone that what to try different beers once in a while, but its not one that I would drink on a regular basis."
"It was drinkable; probably would be great with fish n chips or a burger or a contrast to a strong salad dressing, and great alternating with a sweet pop like Pepsi."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. At least, the first one is. I can't imagine having another one after this though. Definitely a good beer to end a meal with."
"9-27-09 I have to give this beer another look. I give the appearance and extra 0.5 and the taste an extra point for the chocolate taste which is there (but still weak)."
"drinkability- not a bad brew. it's not bad for what it tries to be, but overall it could have used more chocolate, or more stout flavor."
"even if i didnt have the cake, i dont think id be able to drink too much of this beer."
"Its amazing how us as beer lovers always want to try new things but sometimes quite simply forget about old favourites that you havnt tasted for ages until you see it again and think ill give that a go as i just cant remember the exact taste of it and when you taste it you think why havnt i been buying this lately this is one of those beers,it pours a lovely jet black burnt engine oil colour which leaves a prominent three finger coffee like head and slowly dissapates to a big frothy mound in the middle with heaps of nice sticky mocha looking lacing all down the glass,the aroma is overwhelming chocolate notes with a subtle hint of vanilla and roasted malts very lucious,when tasting this beer it leaves you with a very thick mouthfeel of lucious chocolate and malty flavours and can definately not taste any bitterness or alcohol at all almost a choc milkshake so beautiful and smooth,i hate saying that i think a certain beer is the best of its category but so far for me this is definately heads above the rest and will be buying again for those nice cold winters nights next to the fireplace."
"This is certainly not a bad beer at all, just a bit of disappointment. Maybe my expectations were too high."
"Poured from a nitro can into a weizen glass. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Very mild chocolate smell, not much aroma. Flavor is also very mild with hints of chocolate and coffee. Creamy in the mouth and decent drinkability. My first chocolate stout, maybe not the beer for me."
"D - Smooth, low ABV and minimal sweetness equals an excellent treat"
"D - Very enjoyable beer with a nice chocolate presence that isn't too overpowering. Smooth-drinking and not overly filling. I could definitely enjoy a few of these in a sitting."
"d- this is definatly a great brew and i appriciate it for what it is but it is definalty a little harsh on the back of the palate and almost hits the gag reflex as is warms, imo. med priced but i wont look for this beer again."
"It's got a nice dark appearance similar to Guiness. It has a coffee smell to it as well. It tastes like Coffee too mixed with Guiness. It leaves a very strong coffee like aftertaste after every sip. It's very easy to drink and it is a good beer. Though, it's not a beer I would hurry up and buy because it's not my favorite and it's pretty pricey."
"the beer, with one slice of pizza was quite filling. I wouldn't have a second right after, but that doesnt make it a bad beer. Enjoyed it. would've rather had it on its own or with dessert or just simply after the pizza that with it."
"mouthfeel is a bit grainy, full-bodied, but it's not astringent like you would get from other similar beers. it's drinkable."
"It's funny, in my younger days, this was still a bit harsh going. Now, it is easier for me to drink than chocolate milk (and tastes about the same). Kind of thin for a stout, but the nitro-effect gives it some appearance points. Also, the head lingers very nicely - and some cool lacing. A bit of cocoa-pebbles style chocolate on the nose, but that's all. Taste is a thin but sweet stout - makes for a decent session. Good in lieu of anything else in that you can easily drink a lot of it. Smooth cocoaey notes, but a bit watery. That fact is made up by the fact that it is super creamy and smooth. And very drinkable - it does make a nice alcoholic substitute for chocolate milk."
"3.5-4 a very middle of the road stout plus mediocre chocolate aroma and relatively faint chocolate flavor. i like the idea of a chocolate porter or milk stout and this is very easy to drink, but i don't think this is quite the one for me."
"Creamy body and carbonation. Perhaps the carbonation is a bit prickly for the style?"
"Pours black with a fluffy biege colored head. Smells like chocolate and roasted coffee malts. Smells great, but I was hoping for a little more intensity in the aroma. Ver nice smooth, creamy chocolate flavor at first that gives way to a bitter coffee chocolate finish. For me there was a slight tang that kept it from being perfect. Great flavor, reminds me of yoohoo which I used to love as a kid. Carbonation is good but I can't help thinking how much better it would be with a nitrous kick. Very drinkable, but the sweet chocolate and coffee might get too much after a few."
"D: I don't know, this is pretty tasty. I have rarely seen a nitro tap of this let alone the purple label double chocolate on tap. Good stuff!"
"Served on tap at Novare Res, poured into my Uprising chalice. As one would expect from a stout, this is a very dark beer with a slightly off-white, creamy head. The aroma is of chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is of chocolate and coffee. I first wrote that there wasn't much bitterness, but as the beer warmed the bitterness became more pronounced; it never got very strong though. Also, there isn't as much sweetness as you'd expect. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a good amount of carbonation. It is near perfect in my opinion, thanks in some part to the nitro tap. In summary, I recommend that you try this beer. Don't let the Irish control the market for European stouts. The Young's Double Chocolate show that there is some strong competition from across the Irish Sea."
"Extremely recommended, and, enjoy your chocolate."
"Tried this on for the first time the other day... the beer was surprisingly chocolaty smelling to the point of smelling like it belonged in Hershey Park. It pour chocolate syrup brown with a thin tan head up top. Taste was matly and chocolatey but not so much as to be overly sweet but sweet enough to make it pleasent for those looking for sweet. Was pretty thick and smooth going down. Overall I'd say it was really drinkable. A good beer"
"D - Being lactose intolerant, I will be an unhappy camper tomorrow. Damn you britons. Good beer, will be happy to suffer. Go Lakers!!"
"overall - A very pleasant treat. Milky & malty sweet combining with stout flavors to make something totally appropriate for dessert. now to seek out some chocolates to pair it with."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I don't know where to start, this beer is so decadent, so overly indulgent, such a treat, such a dessert! This beer pulls off a wonderfully rich chocolate aroma & flavor, and just like the bottle says ( It's never to sweet!) I wouldn't mind having a pint or two for dessert, nearly flawless flavors aroma, I would of appreciated more body though. Still, an indulgent treat, who needs chocolate cake? Not me, this is my chocolate cake! Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I mean this is a pretty good beer, but I was expecting something thicker and a bit less creamy. I think it might be the nitro can that didn't make fall in love with this beer. It is smooth, and drinkable, and at a lower abv. I just didn't love it."
"This is a great choice for an after-meal beer. Good, consistent chocolate flavors and not too heavy. I will certainly get myself some more of this."
"Drinkability: Smooth and not as stomach occupying as one might thing for a beer as dense is this. However a pint or two of these might be a bit too much for me because of its dessert like sweetness. A stout I will go back to though when I want some creamy smoothness."
"From a bottle, pours a really dark brown not quite black with a decent sized light tan head. Seem to pour pretty thick. The head starts to slowly go down within minutes after pouring. Little lacing is left however. Smells like chocolate which wasn't surprising. The smell at first was pretty strong, not only the chocolate but kind of roasted malt smell and it had me wondering if it was just going to be like a strong stout. After tasting it though the taste was quite different then the smell. Taste like chocolate for sure, almost like chocolate milk just with a beer kick. Really nice taste though, and has a nice creamy mouthfeel. I poured it from a bomber so the first glass went by pretty fast and I will have no problem finishing it off right after. This is one I've been interested in trying for a while and was glad to pick it up finally, and it won't be the last time either."
"Overall: I thought this was decent. I may have served it too warm, but there didn't seem to be a very strong body to this one. Chocolate came through the most, but it lacked bitterness. On the other hand, it seems to be a more refreshing type stout. Not too heavy, but not a lot too it."
"drink-- amazing beer for a low abv%. Can drink a few of these and barely get a buzz. Much more suitable than an after dinner drink. Really like this beer becasue of its drinkability. Unlike other milk stouts that leave too heavy or too much milk. Right amount of sweet, with right amount of bitterness."
"I love the design of the ale vessel--fantastically dark glass with logo in relief on front, beautiful color scheme of dark purple, silver, and orange, and a stunning logo of rams heads menacing each other with an accent mark above. Please, try this with your favorite dark chocolate in whatever amount you deem proper, as I did. As you can guess, the two were made for each other! It took my a long time to find this stout, but it was worth it."
"D - A solid stout with a nice chocolaty taste. To me the body comes up way to thin and a little watery. A decent beer overall, but not worth the $4.25 a bottle price tag when there are better and cheaper stouts to be had."
"D- i could literally drink this bad boy all day. A tremendously great brew and i would love to age one to try in 6 months. One of the best milk stouts i have ever had and i highly recommend."
"Very pleasent and textbook sweet stout. I will be cellaring a few of these."
"D: Takes some time to drink, but that's ok. Very tasty nonetheless."
"All in all a little disappointing... I'm not going to write this guy off yet, but if the next one isn't better, I might."
"velvet smoothness with a dry finish makes this very drinkable."
"With a more than reasonable ABV, this goes down oh so very, very well, even in the absence of a nice dessert. And of course, the chocolate essence becomes even more prevalent as it warms."
"Verdict: Young's Double Chocolate Stout is popular for good reason - it's a solid, sessionable Stout with a nice focus on chocolate flavors. As for whether it's better carbonated in a bottle or nitrogenated in a can, it's a tough call for me. While I certainly appreciate the smooth mouthfeel here, and feel that it compliments the flavor profile well, it just seems a little too flat to really top the carbonated version. It's pretty much a toss-up - but if forced to choose, I think I'd go with the carbonated bottle. I certainly didn't expect that!"
"Overall a very nice stout. Very solid contender that hit the mark."
"Poured to a big 3 fingered head. Head was caramel in color. Brew itself was almost black in color. Had some decent lacing that left thick rings around the side. Smelled of chocolate, a little hint of alcohol and burnt malt. Tasted like chocolate and burnt malt. The sweet of the chocolate was on the edge of being over powering. Left a sweet aftertaste in your mouth. Didnt feel thick in the mouth as you might expect. Carbonation I thought was good. This wouldnt be a good session beer. But in the right mood, it tastes damn good."
"Drinkability - Not a session beer for sure. To much flavor in there. A great dessert beer. As someone said it is much better as it increases in temperature."
"Tastes just like it smells, with an addition of uber rich malt. Mouthfeel is moderately thick and fairly viscous, coating your mouth. Mine had very little carbonation, more carbonation would have definitely helped me enjoy this more. One was plenty enough for me."
"Finish is sweet, almost too sweet. Good dessert beer."
"Few beers can procure flavour like Young's Double Chocolate Stout. It isn't complex but it need not be. If you have a sweet-tooth (or bittersweet-tooth) for high-quality Swiss milk chocolate then meet your match. There is something about this chocolaty biscuit profile that I seem to never tire of. I feel it deserves a spot right up there with the world's tastiest."
"Very drinkable. You don't have to have a sweet tooth to appreciate chocolate, and this beer delivers on exactly that; CHOCOLATE. I've always been a porter/stout kinda guy, and this beer would be a great way to end a day."
"Clear dark brown with a big light-brown frothy head. Aroma is cocoa powder and roasted malts with a touch of milk chocolate. Flavor is dark chocolate up front and slightly acidic roasted barley in the finish. Moderate bitterness. Smooth albeit a little watery. High drinkability. A good intro chocolate stout."
"D: This is a decent beer, and it comes at a decent price... That's about it."
"This is a very good beer, and one I will purchase again in the future."
"Quite a sight with that ginormous, rocky, tan head. Great lacing too, all the way to the end. As you'd expect the chocolate is there on the nose, but not in an excessive way. Quite subtle with a bit of coffee in the background. Medium-low carbonation, supremely smooth and silky. Soft bitterness with long finish. Good beer. If you haven't tried it, do. If you have, do it again."
"Pours with a big head that sticks around forever. Beer is silky smooth looking and tasting. It is lightly chocolaty and very sweet and creamy. The chocolate flavor is rather subdued, it is certainly there, but does not hit you over the head with its presence. Absolute silk on the palate, a definite one to pick up again and again!"
"I feel this stout hit's its name pretty neatly on the mark and it lives up to the product the bottle is trying to sell. Bravo."
"D - The chocolate, though wonderful, is not an all night affair."
"A little dissapointed with this beer. Would like to try another w/ a different batch date."
"D - Far too good. I could drink this brew exclusively for the rest of my life without a doubt. However, I will admit that the bottled version of this brew does not even remotely compare to the nitro-can. Truthfully, if bottles are the only Young's available, I will choose the oatmeal stout over the double chocolate every time. This is because that in the bottle, double chocolate gains a bitterness that I dislike. Nevertheless, this is my all time favorite beer. Period."
"This beer is VERY drinkable. It makes for a nice treat, and it's suited just right for a perfect desert type brew."
"Since I have a huge sweet tooth, I tend to gravitate to the sweeter stouts, like this and milk stouts. This did not disappoint. Now, I just need to find it on tap somewhere."
"Maybe it's the astingestry of the chocolate, like malted milk balls combined with matalic steel taste - not to my liking - chalkiness at the finish, dry, not bad just not my style - otherwise ok on all accounts not for me though. Good dark no see through look, metalic"
"Pours standard dark, with nice head. Strong chocolate smell, malt also in there. Taste is pretty good, with chocolate absolutely dominating the palette; probably the strongest chocolate taste I've had in a chocolate stout. Eminently silky smooth and creamy, absolutely fantastic to drink. Low ABV makes for good repeat consumption over the course of an evening."
"Drinkability: Very smooth, and very easy to put this one down. It's a great beer for people who don't like beer. An excellent standby that I like to always have on hand."
"easy to drink. if i were in a mood for it, having more than one would be no challenge. dinner reservations probably were the only thing holding me back from getting another."
"Overall: I really liked it. I would choose this over a Guinness any day as I seem them as being marketed in a similar way. Very nice interpretation of a stout."
"MF/D: Very nice texture the whole way down, finishes exceptionally smooth. A definitely session beer for stout lovers"
"One to come back to - whether you could have several in a sitting remains to be seen, but this is not that kind of beer. One to enjoy for its unique taste and complexity."
"Notes: This one is just too sweet and one-dimensional for me. I do understand that this was probably what they were going for, but it's just not my cup of tea. I thought the Rogue Chocolate Stout I just had on-tap was much better."
"D- Not a bad brew, but I think the sweet flavor would get to me after a while."
"This beer blew me away as far as taste goes definitely a dessert beer."
"I'm actually very impressed with this one."
"nitro can poured into my tulip glass. Pours a dark black color with a beautiful gelatin looking creamy tan head. I've never seen a head like this, this is beautiful! Smells of stout.. malts, toffee, coffee, and a subtle chocolate. Mouthfeel before taste, the mouthfeel is sooo smooth. Wow. It's so soft and silky. The taste also follows suit, and is very chocolaty. This is one delicious beer. A good session beer, until you get tired of the sweet chocolaty taste. But, drinkability is definitely high. I need to try this with some icecream!"
"Drinkability: Yes! One of the best chocolate beers I've had. Could easily have two or more in a sitting."
"D: A little on the sweet side to throw a lot of this back, but I'd love to drink this as a dessert beer. Really sweet and tasty. Lots of good things going on, I can't believe that I had passed this beer by so many times. Quite nice. I'll be getting this again."
"D: This could be a welcome session stout for me, one big bottle was not enough, I'll be going back for more."
"I would have this beer again but would not go out of my way for it. I would like to try it on tap though."
"Great taste if you're a chocoholic. I don't eat chocolate but decided that it'd be worth a try. Wasn't dissapointed but didn't WOW me. I like what Wells and Young are doing with their beer, taking it to a whole different perspective! They are doing great when it comes to taking food elements that you wouldn't see in a typical beer and making it into one. Great beer/stout (but not stout enough)!"
"44cL can. Pours opaque ebony with a light beige foam head. Typical nitro cascade effect and resiliency. Smells like watered-down chocolate milk with a hint of bitterness. More malt in the taste, though it's still predominately cocoa. Quite sweet, becoming astringent towards the finish. Not very pleasant. Smooth, nitrogenous feel that isn't appealing. Lacks any real depth--just a mediocre stout infused with chocolate."
"Goes down ballanced and smooth, was a housewarming gift and I'm wishing I had another."
"A little let down by this selection."
"I have had this a few times in all forms, Can, Bottle, On-Tap. And I have discovered that drinking it on-tap is by far the best. Pours super black with a creamy dark tan head that last for a good while. Good lacing. Smells very chocolaty. Taste very chocolaty also. Almost like a toostie roll. Very creamy mouthfeel. super drinkable @ 5.2%"
"Overall, I really didn't like this beer. It seems very simple and not at all what I expected."
"Rich, dark color with a tan head that melted down leaving slight lacing. Smells of chocolate and roasted malt. Light in the mouth with not much carbonation.Taste Is superb, with some hops at the front and rich chocolate throughout. Not too bitter. A beer you can drink all night if your up to it."
"I don't even like chocolate, but I think this is the best dessert-appropriate beer I've ever had. Love it with spicy food."
"The mouthfeel is great: malty thick, amazingly smooth and rich with great body. Carbonation ends with less than it began with but gives a good feel overall. A prime example of a stout in itself with rich complexity. A must try."
"It has a pronounced chocalate element, but this is not overpowering and the beer has good balance of sweet and bitter, chocolate, toast, and rich, caramelized fruit, especially prunes. The body is rich and thick yet amazingly lively and the finish refreshingly light but tasty and complex. The chocolate is noticeable but mostly adds a richness with a little chocolate element to the overall chracter, and thankfully does not overpower the drink. It thus retains a well-rounded, complex character with nice subtle notes."
"Final Thoughts - I think this is pretty much the best dark beer I've ever had thus far, be it stout, porter or dunkel. I find it even more pleasant then old engine oil. This drink I would recommend to anyone who isn't a big fan of darker beers but wants to try something new and give them a second chance. Thumbs way up on this one."
"A super dark brown color with loads of light tan head,and lots of lacing when it finally receeds. Aroma of dark chocolate and almost burnt malt grain. Flavor is dominated by chocolate, both milk and bittersweet, with some coffee behind that and again the echo of roasted malt. The mouthfeel was ultra-smooth, the body slightly watery and the carbonation delicate, a slightly sweet coco aftertaste. Very sessionable and fun to try."
"this beer pours a pitch black color with only minimal highlights when back lit, the off white head is creamy and smooth as only the nitro can could produce, and seems intent on sticking around. the aroma gives a nice bit of chocolate malt considering the head, that said there isn't a lot else going on there. the taste follows with great chocolate flavor and a nice sweet finish. the full body and nice carbonation make this a beer I could drink to excess."
"Nice smooth stout, I'd drink more, maybe not in a single night."
"D: Not bad at all. A bit too much to be sessionable, but still nice to have on a semi-frequent basis."
"Overall this a great delicious stout that is like dessert in a nitro-can!!!"
"Taste, is crap, its like water with a huge chocolate blast at the end. This is one beer that I would never push on a friend, maybe a girl-friend, but only if they LOVED chocolate."
"Feel is good, though a bit thinner than I expected. It's more oily than creamy. Overall a good beer that just isn't quite great."
"D - Afraid this is just average at best for drinkability. Nees more oomph!"
"Notes: Years ago, before the advent/discovery of Rogue Chocolate Stout, Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence and, the ultimate, Southern Tier Choklat, I would've felt this was a great chocolate dessert beer. Now, my tastes have evolved to the fuller-bodied RISes and the more highly chocolatey goodness of those beers. As a result, this one's been knocked down a peg or two in my book. Still a good beer, but just too thin and a bit too burnt to be a top chocolate beer for me."
"Beer with chocolate as additional ingredient, Look: Almost black color and coppery tones; Smell: Strong with essences to white chocolate, candy and nuts; robust body; the foam taste like chocolate ice cream, besides that is creamy and dark; the flavor is exquisite, of the one that chocolate is appreciated, coffee, milk and figs, with very tasty end of sweet chocolate; you feel like drinking """chocolate Grannie""" with alcohol; enjoys itself more without food."
"-RR"
"D - I wanted to say perfect, but realistically it's not as drinkable as other beers and other styles (but certainly among the best as far as stouts go)."
"Overall, impressed, but dry malt aftertaste could be refined slightly"
"D - Very enjoyable. I bought the cans thinking it would be gimmicky, but one of my favorites."
"D: Drinks a lot like a dark, dry red wine. Great complements on the flavors, but with a bit more body or maybe even a bit more alcohol, I think this beer would have the potential to be outstanding."
"drinkability: goes down pretty easy...it's just not something i would normally have with food or as a session beer. goes well with lindeman's framboise if you're into sweet fruity beers. hard to detect any alcohol in that mixture."
"Pours a dark black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and god lacing. Smells of alcohol up front, sweet chocolate, and some roasted malt. Fits the style of a Milk/Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with a low carbonation level. Taste of slight grass first, sweet chocolate next, and roasted malt in the finish. Overall, not bad, but a little less quality than I expected."
"MF&D - the feel is too thin, the bottle was thicker, and more of a sipper than this. this is like a sweet guinness, with out any of the (lame) dryness. along that line, the beer is really easy to drink. the only thing that keeps it back from being a chugger is the sweet flavour, nor would i want to have more than two of these, I think."
"Decent drinkability. Not overwhelmingly good, but still a solid beer."
"All together a nice brew that will be enjoyed for a long time. Try it as Half Young's Double Chocolate and Have Lindemans Framboise and it gives it this raspberry chocolate flavor that is very good."
"D: An all-around tasty beverage. Great with raisins. Healthier than a milkshake, and it tastes like beer! Great semi-sweet chocolate flavor balanced with hops. Not a session beer though. One is satisfying."
"D: Good, but not amazing. Not something I am going to buy a lot of, but good for something different."
"I still prefer this on tap, but the nitro can is the closest I've tasted to tap. It's almost too close to call."
"Drinkability: This is an outstanding beer. It was my first experience with a """chocolate""" beer. I expected a highly viscous, goopy, overbearingly sweet mess, but this was very delicious and surprisingly drinkable...I could easily have 2 or 3 in succession."
"Overall a great milk/sweet stout, not over the top chocolaty as Rogue and Chokolat."
"Overall I'd say this was a solid beer. Could be sessioned if you were craving chocolate and beer. I would pick this one up again. Made for a great dessert after a light meal."
"Good beer, I would look for it again."
"D - This beer is extremely drinkable. I found it hard to put down and with a low ABV, I didn't have to."
"This review is from notes on January 2009. Purchased what I thought was a fresh bottle out of the Craft Beer cooler at The Liquor Stop in Highland, IN. I always wanted to try this offering by Youngs but might have to try in the nitro-can the next time because i was not impressed with the taste, mouthful or drinkability. It did look very impressive on the pour and the smell had me thinking, MMM Goood! But it tasted like a watered-down Nestles Quik. I found it to lack character and I struggled just to finish the bottle."
"D: Highly drinkable; This would make a great session beer if not for the fact that it's slightly outside of the definition of """session beer""" (this one is slightly high ABV and doesn't have a clean, crisp finish)."
"Overall - I tend to like the nitro cans and bottles. It is as closed to being on tap as you can get without being there. This is a good beer."
"[fifty characters short?!, really, two hundred and fifty is a bit much, two hundred seems a bit more reasonable to me]"
"Good atmosphere. Nice combo in the nose. Balanced flavor with a good mix of malt and chocolate. Pulls it off without really even being sweet. Hearty feel, but not too heavy. Very good quaff."
"I think this is probably better for making custard. Solid but unspectacular."
"Wow! And did I say Wow!? Young's Double Chocolate Stout could accompany any occasion. Let it flow. It's even thirst quenching."
"One is all I wanted. Sooo happy that I got a 4-pack in DE instead of a $50 case in PA."
"D- it drinks fine. i wouldn't buy another one, but i could drink another if given to me."
"Poured this from the 1 pint bottle. Poured a jet black appearance with a decent light brown head. Smells like what the label says, chocolate. Taste is sweet, defenatly get a good taste of the chocolate flavor, with about no hint at hops. Mouth feel is decent, a bit thinner that I was expecting but good. Great drinkability, goes down smooth. Mark this as a beer I will be getting when i am trying to get friends into better beer."
"D- Wow, just a fantastic beer. Putting one of these down is effortless."
"mouth is thick and smooth, such a creamy body that is unmatched. drinks quite well for such a heavy brew."
"J"
"Overall great drinkability. Nice body, but not too heavy or filling. Good after dinner type beer. Easy to drink a couple."
"I do not see myself picking up this beer again, it was good but nothing special."
"A great change every once in a while. It's just an all around good tasting mouthfull of a beer. This is one,that when perplexed what I want to order next, can sit and enjoy while I think about it. Nothing complex here, just nice full body and chocolate goodness, always a favorite...it helps that it's one of my wifes favorites also."
"I can have one of these before I'm ready to move on but it is a very nice beer that I enjoy as often as I can."
"Easy to drink due to the mild flavors and low ABV. Pretty balanced and flavors are quite tame."
"Overall, its a tasty beer. The chocolate is a bit strong for my taste, but I would still go for this one again."
"I drank it straight from the bottle, so I didn't see how it poured. Not sure about its head but the taste was wonderful. Tasted like a very strong red ale or amber with hints of chocolate coffe. It has a great distinctive taste. It smells a lot like chocolate and black coffee. A very great stout."
"D..Easy to put away since the ABV is only 5%. I could make this a short-session beer. If you've never tried a chocolate beer, this double chocolate stout is the place to start."
"On-tap at my favorite bar, the Old Toad. I've had Young's out of the bottle and on-tap, and there's absolutely no comparison. It's creamy and rich and not at all """watery""" like I've heard other people say. Sure, it's not as heavy as a typical stout, but that doesn't translate to a let-down. We've come to expect a more roasted or unsweetened-chocolate taste from our chocolate stouts, but Young's is a bit gentler, more rich and creamy. This is a great beer, both for experienced beer tasters, and for your friends who want to try something different."
"From a 0.5L bottle purchased locally poured into an imperial pint. Aroma has hints of chocolate, coffee, figgy plum and a little roast. Color is a jet black with a creamy tan head that is leaving nice lace as it subsides. Bittersweet chocolate is in the front with a touch of sweetness that fades into the roast. Bitterness is firm but balanced. Thick creamy mouthfeel with a lingering roast/toast/bitter chocolate aftertaste that fades dry. An excellent stout that is complex and satisfying."
"D - Could put away a few of these, but im afraid the calories may be high (though I can't say for sure as I havent researched it.) Definitely tasty, and if you are looking for REAL chocolate taste, definitely pick some up."
"D- more of a novelty that I would try to convert some non beer drinkers with. Its not terrible, I just have been spoiled by beers that tackle the chocolaty as hell thing much better than this one. I doubt ill have purchase this one again, but im glad I tried it."
"Overall, I don't think it's the premier dessert/chocolate brew. It has great flavors and smells, but I think it has been greatly overshadowed by the likes of Southern Tier Chokolat and Redhook Double Bock."
"This is a fantastically drinkable beer, especially for a double chocolate stout. Very light and low in alcohol content."
"Drinkability: Definitely a keeper which I can and will comeback to again and again when in the mood for a nice chocolate dessert stout in the evening or after a meal."
"D- this is a repeat beer for the simple reason that it is afordable, available and delicous. give it a try!"
"Off a nitro-tap at American Flatbread this beer was an opaque brown. The head was two fingers large and receded down to a perfect cap that left nice curtains of lacing down my glass. The aroma was purely of chocolate with only a hint of roasted malt behind it. The flavors were similar, dominated by huge chocolate, both milk and bittersweet, with some coffee behind that and again the echo of roasted malt. The mouthfeel was ultra-smooth, the body slightly watery and the carbonation delicate. If you like chocolate in your beer you have to try it, there are few better examples if any and it's rightly one of the best milk stouts in the world."
"This is really a unique one. A nice dark brown color. The smell is heavenly. It has a wonderful very chocolate smell. The first sip was just what I expected. But then the mouthfeel kicked in. It actually feels a bit too watery for my taste. After a few sips, it starts to taste and feel like a really nice ale... with chocolate milk flavoring added. You know, I really wanted this one to be a wonderful stout. I expected to absolutely love it. But I would pick a porter or an oatmeal stout over this one when I want a chocolate flavor. It's GOOD, but it's just not my taste."
"Pours dark brown/black with a big creamy head. Smells of what you would expect...chocolate. Taste is very good with not being overly sweet, which is good IMO. Medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Finishes creamy and smooth. Very drinkable beer that I will enjoy again and again."
"Mouthfeel - heavy body yet smooth and watery. Medium-low carbonation as expected for a stout."
"drinkability: probably one of the best stouts I have ever had."
"A really enjoyable drink. As crazy as it sounds, there is a bit of Yoo-Hoo in the flavor. Not enough to scare anyone off, it is good. Quite drinkable."
"Pours a dark burnt umber with a decent one finger mocha colored head. Moderate, but lasting lace. As much as I tried to detect the smells of roasted malt, nuts, etc. mentioned by other reviewers, all I got was chocolate...heaps of it. And this is a good thing for a """double chocolate""" stout. This is a smooth slightly sweet stout with no bitter aftertaste such as what you get from a Guinness (yeah, I know, a different class entirely, but I'm trying to draw a comparison of sorts). Youngs is, for want of a better beer word, delicious. One of my favorites. BTW, I prefer the bottle to the nitro can, which tends, after the initial burst of head, to be rather flat and skim milky."
"This is a good light stout. Would recommend as a starter stout for people just getting into the style. Would have liked to see more pronounced flavors but it will do just fine as a session stout"
"Highly recommended to those who normally find stouts too strong for their liking, as I found this a little mild for my taste, but still a fantastic beer."
"I've had this on tap before although this is the first time from a bottle. It's not bad, certainly quite drinkable, but it's almost a bit too light. It's good, but not great, although I'd certainly have it again."
"I'm not sure I'd be drinking these at just any random time of day but it certainly makes a good dessert beer."
"Very drinkable beer, with a low abv, it makes this delicious treat a perfect beer for a nice dinner with family and I may have to try stewing with it (just like the famous Guinness beef stew)"
"I would session this in a second, probably at top of it's style's class."
"This is a highly drinkable beer, so long as it's being enjoyed at the appropriate time. This is a phenomenal after dinner dessert beer. At 2:30 in the afternoon, I doubt it's as drinkable."
"I haven't had a Young's DCS in a while, so I ordered one a few weeks back at a local pub (Cornwall's). It was so sweet, it tasted like vanilla syrup. Almost too sweet to drink. I thought, did they change this beer? So I picked up a bottle more recently to compare. The version on tap must have been messed up, as the bottled stout tasted more like I remembered. So the bottle is what I will review. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark brown color, bordering on black. Decent tan head, some lacing. Roasted barley smell. Very rich, dark chocolate stands out in the flavor. Dark and bitter to the point that it subdues the sweetness, in a good way. I like the fact that it's not overly sugary, but has a nice mix of sweetness and roastedness. Also a bit dry on the palate, so I would not describe this beer as creamy. Easy to drink, and low in abv. A perfect before or after dinner beer."
"I expected a lot more chocolate with this and, though that was present, it was more the balanced distinction of Young's Double Chocolate that caught me off-guard. A fine, unique beer, I recommend YDCS without reservation. Well done."
"D: Yum, very chocolaty and appealing. Easy to drink and just very tasty. This is the best nitro stout I've tasted."
"Taste is a milk chocolate. At first I got a metalic taste, which believe what coming from the foam... seemed to go away after a couple of drinks. Mouthfeel is silky as it moves through the mouth. Drinkability is great as this beer goes down with ease."
"Goes down easy, a perfect session beer and tastes very, very good. Not as chocolate tasting as one may expect but still an excellent stout."
"Very drinkable, and at 5.2% ABV...it could be possible. Awesome brew!"
"Overall: I tried the beer in a nitro can and I feel that there is a night and day difference between the nitro can and the bottle. The bottle provides a rich chocolate and malt. The nitro can is creamy and watery. The mouth feel of this beer is coating and creamy. The finish is slightly bitter and it lingers on the palate for a few moment, giving the drinker a chance to savor the background of the beer. I love this beer."
"Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with low carbonation. If you like chocolate, as I do, drinkability is very high."
"pours up super dark brown with a small tan head. decent lacing too. the nose is dark chocolate, very dry, dark roasted malts. the taste is the same as the nose. the chocolate I taste is very dry and not sweet at all. crisp hops in the finish, med to full bodied, low to med carbo. a classic brew..."
"Additionally, the beer was creamy in its texture. This beer really wasn't my style, and a bit hard to finish, but nonetheless, it was relatively enjoyable."
"Overall - Surprisingly tasty and silky stout. The sweetness is not cloying in any way. A nice coffeelike bitterness with dark chocolate makes for excellent balance. A great appetizer beer or a dessert beer. I could probably see it as a session beer too. Reviewed from notes."
"Pours dark brown, almost black with purplish red highlights around the edges. One inch tan colored head and some nice lacing. There's a lot of carbonation bubbles sticking to the glass which gives it a cola-like appearance. Aroma is slightly sour at first, but notes of chocolate and bitter roasted malt bring up the back end of the nose. Taste is metallic, slightly sour, and only hints of dry dark chocolate, and some underlying roasted malt. I'm not sure how they call this a """double chocolate stout""" as chocolate seems to be the furthest thing from the front. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. This is just not a good beer. The best before date is 6 months away and there was a nice hiss when I opened the bottle, so I don't believe it has gone bad. I think it's just not good. Maybe I'm just not crazy about British stouts in general. I would not buy this again, even though I only paid $2.50 for it."
"D: Very smooth. Could easily drink a few."
"I really want to give this straight fives but I know that there is probably something better out there. Now I just need to find it!"
"Taste: The taste is much like the smell except that the roastiness comes through a lot stronger in the taste. Mouthfeel is fairly full but desperately needs some carbonation."
"Those crazy Brits have done it again."
"Not too thick with moderate carbonation. The drink changes a bit as you drink so it keeps it interesting. As said before its not too thick and not overpowering make for a very drinkable beer especially for the price! A no brainer to buy again."
"I really enjoyed drinking this. I could tell from the aroma when I first crakced open a can this beer was different. It almost smelled like candy. The whole nitro stout thing is very similar to the Guiness beer, but the taste is even creamier and the aftertase is kinda similar to milk chocolate."
"This brew is aptly named, as it comes across about as chocolaty as you could imagine. It's an attractive beer, deep brown to black with a nice thick foamy light brown head that persists remarkably well and forms a solid layer down the sides of the glass. The aroma is chocolate. The thick mouthfeel helps to spread the sweet chocolate over the palate, but there is a nice slight hop finish that clears the palate a bit. Moderately drinkable, but I could not go for more than two at one sitting. Great brew for cold weather."
"In general, I like it. A nice beer worth trying for sure."
"In all, a lovely beer that is all it claims to be. Definitely something I'll have again."
"I could easily see this being a session beer as it was not too much of anything, not too sweet, not too bitter, not too chocolatey, not too """roastey.""" Overall, a well balanced stout with a moderate amount of chocolate. I look forward to drinking it again."
"a wonderfull beer."
"Enjoy!"
"mouthfeel is good as is drinkability"
"Maybe the best palate of any beer I've ever tasted, just creamy chocolate with a hint of coffee and malt behind it. Tastes like a candy bar or maybe hershey syrup. I bet this beer would be outstanding over vanilla ice cream and think I should probably try that soon."
"This had a really nice flavor and feel but was filling so probably would be best in small amounts after a meal."
"drinkability was very high, definitely recommend"
"Mild carbonation allows this to coat your mouth. Nothing cloying or off. Again, a well made brew. Overall, you can kill a 6 of these and enjoy each to the last drop. Fine brew overall."
"Tasty, filling beer, I would recommend it as a dessert to any meal!"
"Drinkability: I would drink the crap outta this beer. Perfect for the cold weather, and perfect paired with desserts and i would probably pair it with some duck even!! Its got a nice backbone and its delicious."
"Always mean to try it in the can for comparison, can't go wrong with the bottle though."
"7/5/6/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"D - very tasty and creamy stout"
"Very drinkable chocolate stoudt that you could session with. The flavors open up a bit more as the beer warms. I gotta try this on tap. Very nice stoudt!"
"Drinkability: a tastey stout for lovers of hearty beers. This would also be a great intro-to-stout-beer for an inexperienced beer drinker due to the creaminess."
"This beer was exceptionally smooth. It poured with a creamy head and had a great chocolate/coffee malt aroma. The taste was not overpowering, but instead was more of a creamy, almost candy-like flavor. I would recommend this beer to any dark beer lover..."
"This beer is better than I remembered. Do yourself a favor and pick some up. Very well crafted and great for people that have only had Bud and say they """don't like beer.""""
"(rated Apr 17, 2007)"
"Pours a near black color with brown highlights, nice fluffy brown head that quickly settles into a sparse cap with some lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of chocolate syrup, sweet but not too sweet. Plesant aroma not too overpowering. Nice smooth chocolate malt with added chocolate flavor, sweet and creamy but in balance. A little bit of roasted bitterness in the end. The feel is a tad thin for a stout but has an excellent silky texture, carbonation is soft. The stout is sweet but not dessert sweet. This is an insanely drinkable beer. Very smooth, a bit sweet but not sugary sweet, good subtle chocolate flavor."
"Different beer. Pours dark brown with no real head, just randonm bubbles. Aroma of cream and Cocoa Puffs. Taste was like Bosco. All chocolate, but milk chocolate, not real chocolate. It was like a melted milkshake, but really watery. If they made """dessert beers""" this would qualify. Very sweet, very chocolately, almost like a milkshake. Not really my style."
"D - Good for one, would bore me after awhile."
"Drinkability: Always a favorite, this beer is just begging to be made into a float."
"D_Taste very little alcohol, nice and easy"
"Not drinkable."
"D - This is one of my favorite beers. Makes for an excellent dessert. Out of the bottle, this was delicious, but I enjoy it even more on cask at Llewellyn's Pub down the street. It is not as chocolaty as the name implies, but of course there is a lot more chocolate than a normal stout."
"Pours pitch black with tan head that leaves sheets of lacing. Smell: milk chocolate. cocoa, caramel, roasted malt undertones. Taste: hot chocolate, unsweetened/bitter chocolate, roasted flavors, just enough earthy hops to keep from getting too sweet. Medium bodied, creamy, dry oat+cocoa-like finish."
"Great! Have had out of the tap and can and enjoy equally both ways. Slightly smoother out of a nitrogenated tap. Some might say it is not a session beer, but if you're a stout/porter fan it can be done:) Murky brown pour, roast malt with mostly choclate aromas. Mostly chocolate with a velvety mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: This is a stout that is light enough to have a few, with a flavor that would expect you to. A good tasting stout, and definite props on the smooth chocolate taste."
"Drinkability - if I had more than this one, I would probably drink them."
"I took off some points for drinkability due to the sweetness but thats just me. Very good beer."
"Nitro cans are so cool, this is fun to crack open and hear the nitro bubble. Its better ontap, but this is still quite good."
"Drinkability: This is overly drinkable, at 5.2 ABV it's a low alch stout thats tasty enough to satisfy even a big Stout drinker. This brew has a nice chocolate taste I haven't had anywhere else in a choco stout, pulled off perfectly and gets my props!"
"Notes: Great session beer, something I could drink all night long. I know it's a different style, but I session Guinness often, and this kicks Guinness's ass. Not watery at all, actually tastes like a stout with chocolate added to it."
"The feel is, sadly, a bit thin. There's not enough creaminess to it. I would love to have one on tap at some point for a point of comparison. The drinkability mostly suffers for me because of the feel. It's just not something that I really would ever want a second glass of. It's not bad, but it's definitely dessert beer and not dessert flavors in a main course beer."
"Bottle. Pours very dark brown with a thick tan head. Weak aroma of bitter chocolate. The taste was like chocolate coke or doctor pepper with chocolate syrup added. Both the aroma and the taste was somewhat lacking. It seemed to have very high carbonation. The entire experience reminded me of drinking soda."
"This is a great tasting and drinking beer."
"D - Great drinkability here, but the richness would probably limit me to no more than 2 per sitting. I didn't think I'd like this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised, and I'll be drinking more in the future."
"The beer is drinkable. It's not offensively chocolate-y and I could drink a couple of these, not a ton of them, but really good drinkability, especially with mexican food or barbecue."
"mouthfeel is silky and easy to drink, loads of great flavor"
"Good, but I was expecting something grand. The prominent bitter, sour, and sweet seamed to combat each other rather than unify the taste."
"Pours an almost pitch black with red highlights. A creamy tan head that is about .5 inch remains. Smell is slightly of coffee and sugary malt. Taste is as the description says, chocolaty. There is a nice toasted malt flavor as well. I actually expected this beer to be sweeter, but it is quite nice as is. A hint of earthy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat of a disappointment, I really do not like nitro, the beer tastes rather flat. Drinkability is good though, an entire 16oz can is nice, but I personally find that to be enough, as the chocolate does begin to tire you. Overall a nice ale, I would definitely get this again."
"not something id drink in session but drinking one is no problem at all."
"Great dessert beer with warm chocolate cake and raspberry jam on top!"
"amazing!"
"D: Goes down very easy, reminds me of a warm/melted chocolate milkshake. Doesn't come across as """heavy""" or filling. This would probably be a great introduction to stouts for someone who """doesn't like dark/heavy beers""". A great sweet stout, highly recommended."
"Overall, a very solid chocolate stout. Really glad this one is on tap. Definitely will be having this again."
"D: Overall, this is a decent beer. It's a little too sweet to drink a lot of, but still well done."
"D - Tastes too smokey for my liking. Probably won't have it again."
"I poured a 16 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. It pours nice and dark with a thick white head. The smell is like fresh baking chocolate. I am a little disapointed by the taste. It was like a dark chocolate melted in beer, but I was wanting more. The beer is smooth and drinkable. I think I my expectations were just more than this beer had too give."
"Poured an attractive dark color that was almost black with a nice tan head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma is of chocolate and coffee. Taste is also of chocolate with just a touch of coffee. It is sweet with not as much hop character as Rogue's offering. I thought the mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side. I liked it, however, and it was pretty damn drinkable."
"Pours a black colored body, pitch black, with big head, tan colored and big bubbles good lacing. A strong aroma of dark chocolate & coffee. Good taste of chocolate, not bitter at all, no coffee taste. Kind of a watery mouthfeel. Pretty tasty."
"Pours an inky black with a decent caramel head that sticks around. Good lacing. Smell is of chocolate, lactose, and a very slight roasty smell. Taste is of more sweet chocolate, lactose, not much hops whatsoever. Big, malty, and sweet. Reminds me of Rogue's chocolate stout...especially the aftertaste. Slick, silky mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"This is a great beer. As a craft beer enthusiast whose gateway beer was Guinness Draught, I particularly enjoy this beer since all the characteristics it shares with Guinness are enhanced. Great as a dessert beer, as my father-in-law delighted in pointing out."
"In my book, beats Rogue Chocolate Stout hands down. Not as sweet. More complex."
"Thoroughly enjoyable!"
"Future outlook: Easy to find, dependable, and delicious. Barring premature death, repeat business 100% imminent."
"Overall: po man's Rogue"
"Outta the can, (equipped with widget ball and all) pours a stoic black color. Beautifully active stationary head with cascading microbubbles. Immediate heavy chocolate aroma with strong vanilla notes which remind you of whole milk chocolate milk. Which is funny because this brew reminds you of a heavy milk stout. It's actually a sweet stout with very tame malts that makes for great drinkability. One of my very favorite chocolate stouts. Could possibly considered a desert beer."
"It's got a really nice taste to it, and just like I was hoping for, a big hit of chocolate. Creamy, smooth, roasty bitterness like a good stout, and then that sweet chocolate and coffee taste. I was expecting a big, thick milkshake-level mouthfeel, but it was actually quite thin. The plus side is that it makes it very drinkable, as I could see myself easily pounding back a few of these (well, if they were more widely available around here). Still, I could have hoped for more thickness and creaminess to make this into a real treat."
"The beer pours a thick rich brown-black with a dense creamy head that stays to the bottem of the glass. The aroma is rich of chocolate and malt with a slight hint of sweet milk. Minor vanilla notes come through towards the end. Flavor is ultra rich chocolate with a toasty roasted malts tht give way to a slight balance of hops that dry out the sweetness just a bit. The balance is dangerous because its not so sitcky sweet like some of this style that it impeed drinkability. Super smooth in the mouth, thick and creamy all the way to the bottem of the glass. It goes down so smooth its easy to keep drinking this beer. 2 of my favotite things: beer and chocolate."
"D - I found this beer extremely drinkable, very very light, and pulling me in for further sipping. Great beer."
"D: For a stout this was a good lolly drink, very easy to have more than one, light & not viscous. I imagine this is aimed to attract non-traditional stout lovers, with its dessert like characteristics."
"Mouthfeel starts out great, full, creamy and thick. For me it finishes watery though, with a twinge of alcohol. Not nearly as good as it looks or I expected. I wish it was a little thicker and creamier at the end."
"Had this on tap at Mcnellie's Pub, midtown OKC. Pours black with shades of brown barely coming through. It's topped with a two-finger creamy tan head that lingers and lingers, being kept alive by the insane carbonation bubbles that rise from the middle of the pint glass to the head. This goes on for about 3-4 minutes until finally the head starts to recede but sticks around somewhat even as you drink the sucker down. Thick stripes of lacing are left when all is said and done. Damn, it's a beauty, but there's not much going on aromatically. Some roasted malts are noticed. Tastes of dark chocolates, but not as bold as expected, being a """Double""" Chocolate Stout. I might have approached this expecting something else. Some cinammon and nutmeg are involved though, with some redemptive hop goodness in the end. This is a very full-bodied brew, that just happens to be drinkable as well. Not much more I can say."
"D - the sweet charecter of this stout, i imagine, could be distracting after a few. Don't get me wrong this beer is extremely drinkable but i could never see myself buying a case, its a bit to... dare i say... decadent? Even at a low ABV i can only see myself sipping one of these on a cold winter night by the fire."
"Not a terribly complex beer, but I guess that isn't what I go for when I grab one, and it is still delicious."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and a little too carbonated initially. Evens out greatly as it warms."
"Had this beer a few years ago before I was a serious beer advocate. Didn't like it at the time since it was given to me and I had to drink it out of a can. I walk by this beer every time I am in the beer store. Went to the store with my fiancee and she asked about it. I told her what I thought and she asked if we could split it anyway. So I went ahead and picked it up. We split the bottle at her apartment. This beer is much better than I remember it. Pours a deep brown with a creamy head. Smell is exactly like sweet chocolate. Taste starts off pretty sweet and turns into a slightly bitter cocoa chocolate. Very creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. This beer might be too sweet to have more than one, but this is much better than I remember it."
"The intense chocolate is really impressive! This beer just keeps you craving another sip. I will be after this all fall and winter long."
"My first try at a nitro-type container and it didn't go well. This beer looks great appearance wise, when you pour it's a tan color but then a dark color cascades down like a cloud and turns the beer all jet black.. pretty cool. I just couldn't get over how flat and watery the beer was. It was a fresh can, stored well and all, was I not pouring it right? Either way, it was so flat it made it almost drinkable.. nice lacing and all but its hard to taste the flavor when you have trouble swallowing it."
"Have this with dessert, or even instead of dessert. One of my very favorite beers, ever."
"D: A restrained chocolate taste profile and luxurious mouthfeel make this chocolate milk stout highly drinkable."
"This beer is smooth, creamy and fantastic! What a fabulous stout. Beer pours a jet black with a tan head that has great retention! Lacing throughout. Nose is of chocolate and roasted malts. THe flavor is a great blend with the chocolate flavoring not overpowering. The chocolate flavor does not hit until the end. A bit dry in the middle but evens out in the end. This is one that I hope to find again soon!"
"This beer pours black with a nice tan head. Huge caramel malts and chocolate smell. The taste is creamy, chewy and smooth with a roast chocolate flavor. Drinkability is good, I could have a couple of these. A little pricey at 3.59 but I will definitely be trying this again."
"DRINK: The chocolate is there and it tastes exactly what you think it would taste like, but it's not overwhelming. Very drinkable. The second bottle was better than the first, but they were both good enough to make me go back and buy a few more. I would and will definately go for it again."
"this beer is heaven. it is to this day one of my all time favs. a very rich slightly heavy stout. very frothy and thick head. and they balanced it to perfection with a hint of dark chocolate. i have drank this beer many times and will definatly drink many more. youngs oatmeal stout is excellent as well.."
"The mouthfeel is soft and pillowy when warm but thin and watery when cold. Again, serve this beer near room temperature for best results. The finish is smooth chocolatey and the best part of this worthy stout. At 5.2% this beer is highly drinkable."
"A good dessert beer or to accompany snacks. I would have liked a bit more richness though."
"To each his own and this was not for me."
"D--Could take two at a time, as it's not sweet so much as richly good. Drink this with a plate of gravy and some steaming Yorkshire pudding."
"All in all this is obviously extremely well made, I just happen to find it slightly underwhelming. But if you're looking for a subtle, easy going beer this is where it's at."
"D- The whole pint went down exceptionally fast. I could go for another"
"D: It is a nice medium bodied brew with pleasant flavors and a low ABV making it a decent candidate for a session brew. However, the sweetness might cause one to cut the session short in favor of a less milky sweet beer."
"D: I would try this beer anytime, I am not sure what kind of food I would drink this with. The taste of chocolate makes it feel like you are having dessert so I wouldn't pair it with a dessert myself. I loved it."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Since it's not incredibly heavy, this beer goes down quite easily - even for a stout. The brew is easy to throw down at both cold and room temperatures. It's obviously more enjoyable at the warmer temps, but it's hard to be disappointed."
"Opaque looks with creamy dark head makes this brew very appealing. Sweet chocolate aroma is welcoming after a filling dinner. A beautifully delicious dark chocolate flavor that is rich and a bit creamy. This is a wonderful Godiva swamp that feels amazing to dive into at the end of a day. The essence of mouth-watering dark chocolate is captured wonderfully. This is a fantastic dessert beer that is as rich as it is satisfying."
"Sipped it like a port during a late movie. Not bad."
"It's hard to find something wrong with this beer. It's a little less heavy and thick than your standard stout, but the flavor, balance, and drinkability more than atone for any shortcomings. This is an excellent beer that really warrants your attention if you haven't tried it already - try it as soon as you can."
"Drikability is very high , I really enjoy this beer."
"D- Overall, I enjoyed the taste of this better in the bottle, but the appearance really was better in the can. If I were to buy again, it'll be in the bottle. Regardless, this beer is pretty drinkable."
"This poured pitch black with tan head. It smelled surprisingly mild and earthy, like bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. It tasted like dry cocoa powder, bittersweet chocolate and earthy malts, and a bit of pine hops. It was watery with a bit of carbonation, and had an oily and sweet aftertaste. Overall this was very much a dark ale with bitter chocolate flavoring, rather than a thick and rich stout. However, this dry character allowed for more subtlety, and made it very clean and drinkable. Not as delicious as I hoped, but very well constructed."
"Black pour with a thick dark brown head. Slight cocoa smell. Milk chocolate is all over the taste. Still, not overly sweet. Mouthfeel could be creamier, but drinkability is still excellent. If I could get this on tap locally instead of Guiness, I'd be killing this stuff. Very enjoyable. Can't wait to try on tap."
"Pitch black with a thick tan head that was quite persistent. Awesome aroma with a chocolate/Nutella thing happening. I immediately wanted a Ferrero Rocher. Flavour is a cocoa blast with enough bitterness to prevent cloying. A bit roasty and also some coffee/Mocha...goddammit it's a double-choc explosion with some cream on top. Trez Yum. I couldn't have many, though."
"Mouthfeel is really my only complaint about this beer. Very, very watery on the palate. However, it does have a milkshake-like finish to offset the thinness. Drinkability is way high. A cold winter night with 3 or 4 of these before bed would be awesome."
"d: One bottle for the night is good for me. I tend to want to drink it to fast."
"This is one of the better stouts I've tried to date, but I don't think I'd feel the same if I drank a bunch of them. Pours a black color with a nice thick tan head. Quite a bit of lacing on the glass too. Aroma is quite a bit of chocolate with a nice burned malt scent as well. It's a surprisingly smooth beer with chocolate, malts, and a nice roasted flavor in there. Slightly bitter and dry at finish."
"This has made me a very big supporter of Sweet Stouts or Stouts altogether. Go out and buy one or four today."
"d: dessert in a can. a world-class sweet stout that delivers the chocolate in spades. This is one beer that deserves it's reputation. If it wasn't so chocolaty sweet I would drink it all day, but that's what makes it so good in the first place."
"Nose was chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is a mix of roasted malt and sweet malt with dark chocolate and a creamy, vanilla note. Nice finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Nice choco stout but I have had better."
"I wouldn't drink more than one of these in a sitting, and probably won't drink one on its own anytime soon. I may try and pair this up with a desert, nothing with too much chocolate though, as that might be a bit of overkill."
"POurs out a dark brew with dense nitro foam,,also has the cascades. Actually its a black beer. Smells of mostly espresso with hints of chocolate. Taste,,wow ,this is a good beer!Roasted barley,,slightly sweet,,hints of espresso and chocolate all come together really well. My only complaint is the mouthfeel is kinda watery. Besides that this is a kick ass brew."
"Pours a five finger light brown head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Totally black color. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is sweet milk chocolate, you can taste the """real dark chocolate""" the brewer puts in; smooth finish, very drinkable. $4.10 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Overall, it is a great drink. It's pretty widely available for me here in Indy, so bottoms up."
"D - I love drinking one of these at the end of an excellent dinner, but a stout is too heavy for me to have more than two."
"On tap you get what this beer was intended to be, and I think pretty close to what you get from the nitro can. Bottle is good, I actually think there's a bit more of the chocolate taste but it heavily lacks on the creamy mouthfeel/smoothness. The beer is much more watery from a bottle."
"Dark brown colored ale that has thick creamy foam head that fades to half an inch.Aroma is malt and chocolate.Taste is cream and sweet chocolate.This is probably the best brew I've had in years.It is creamy and smooth as silk.I'm glad I got a four pack of these they'll all be gone tonight.Excellent!!"
"Very easy to drink. Creamy and smooth. Medium body. Minimal carbonation."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't drink this one too often with so many other choices, what a spoiled dork I've become. That said it's definitely in the rotation and will be a good introductory beer for sure."
"This beer pours very dark nearly opaque with a 1 finger tan head. The smell is chocolate, malts and alcohol. The taste is smooth, very creamy with some chocolate flavor but nothing compared to rogue or ST. The malt flavor is very nice in this beer, and I don't get a taste of hops @ all. The mothfeel is nice and creamy my only complaint would be the dry feeling I get after I swallow, wierd for such a low abv beer. It is an easy drinking beer, just not something I could see myself drinking as a session beer."
"This beer is very smooth and, much to my enjoyment, not too overpowering with the added chocolate."
"D- It goes down easy, but it's almost a little too sweet."
"Drinkability: This beer is super smooth. This is a great beer, especially for being so available, but it is not my favorite style. I would probably only have 1 a night, or split one with my girlfriend after I had an APA or 2, which is usually the case."
"D: Although this is probably one of the better stouts i have tried I still cant sit there and drink stouts. Comparatively to other stouts I give it a A- or B+ I guess, but Overall compared to everything else..."
"poured from a nitro can, figured that it would be beter from the can, i realy loved the pour and the seteling of the beer, i also liked the chocolate smell but i realy was disapointed when i tasted this one, it was thick and rich but sweater than i like, i will try this one in bottles and then diside if i like this one. still figuring it out?"
"A unique stout bursting with dark malts and strong chocolate flavors. This is a well made beer. Pours nice and dark with a thick mahogany head. The aroma is pleasant, and it drinks extremely smooth. The chocolate flavor really hits you after you have swallowed which leads to a great stout experience. I was afraid that this one would be too sweet and chocolatey but the balance is perfect. Finally I can enjoy dessert with my beer."
"Have had this before but never bothered with the tallboy can, thinking it might detract from the beer. Not so, and if you haven't had this go and buy it and drink it as soon as you get home (there's no need to literally drink and drive). Poured into my pint glass and received a thick, black body with a two-finger tan head that left a ring of lace down my glass the whole time. A good malt smell, mostly chocolate (of course). Extremely smooth and creamy, this has an immense chocolate flavor. If you have a sweet tooth then this will wet its whistle, as this beer is almost akin to a chocolate milkshake when it comes to the taste. Goes down with the chocolate riding the whole way as it sails over the tastebuds and down the throat. An excellent beer to either kickstart the night or for dessert, one is all you need to enjoy."
"Flavor is a medley of dark roasted malts, a nice oat smoth moutfeel and a almost shocking sweetness. I jus about wanted to say cloying, but the astrinency from the dark malt and the firm hop bitterness brings balance to this stout. A nice chocolate finish adds well the sweetness of this ale."
"D: Despite being a heavier beer I could drink many of these and I find them relatively refreshing though probably not a great sit-outside-on-a-summer-day-brew."
"T/M/D - delicious, with an up-front chocolate taste blending perfectly with the stouty goodness. This is an outstanding beer!"
"An excellent dessert beer, but not one you'd typically want more than one of. Does work well to blend with, especially with some raspberry lambics"
"Taste is more complex than the nose. It's dark and very cocoa-y. Rich and ever-so-slightly bitter on the back palate, but man that bitterness is just there to emphasise the rich potency of the brew. It's rich, wonderful, powerful, sweet and just a brilliant late-night ale. Really brilliant. Forget chocolate sauce, pour this all over icecream."
"If you're on a stout kick but don't want to dabble too much in the realm of chocolate, try Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout or Sam Adams Cream Stout."
"Could drink these till I pass out on the floor."
"This stout poured black with a medium light caramel head. Smell is a strong balance of chocolate and chocolate malt with roasted, espresso-like malts. It borders on chocolate milkshake. Nice chocolate flavor with toasty malts; bittersweet. Mouthfeel is smooth with some acidity and an odd sort of powdery feel. This is a very rich but drinkable stout."
"Greeted by a screaming widget as I cracked open the pull tab. Nice. Wonderful reverse cascading bubbles. Color is Black topped with a creamy white collar that is 1/2 inch in depth but settles to about 1/3inch. Smell is amazing!, like rich hot cocoa but without the heat. Rich and dense but not over the top. I can smell it as it sits on the table in front of me, amazing. Mouth feel is light, maybe more than I would like, and finishes a bit dry. On the tongue it is fairly mild, upon swallowing the chocolate comes into play. Not as big as the nose, more like a watered down cocoa, but still very respectable. Head and shoulders above the bottle version. Why would I ever drink Guinness again if I could have this glorious nectar?! A must stock from now on."
"This is the favorite beer of my wife. I like it but I need something that features chocolate, not showcases it in my beer."
"I was pretty disappointed with this one actually. Based on the good things I've heard about it I thought it would be better. It was alright, but I think it was just too much chocolate for me. Obviously it's supposed to be that way, but I think I just prefer a regular stout. I'd rather just eat a chocolate bar."
"I can often appreciate lesser beers packaged in nitro-cans, but in the case of this beer, I don't think it works as well. The lack of carbonation really screws with some of the flavors going on, and for that reason I'll be limiting myself to purchasing bottles of the stuff. Much better in my opinion, but still a fantastic beer."
"D. Good stuff. Get it by the case."
"There are already so many reviews detailing the experience of this fine beverage that I couldn't add anything that would better express it's greatness only to say that this is my current favorite stout. It's definitely not the kind of beer I would recommend to a person inexperienced with stouts as they would expect it to be like a typical dry stout a la Guinness. If there is a better chocolate stout out there, I haven't tried it yet."
"Very tasty and memorable beer. I could see this being paired with multiple foods/desserts or alone for a nice nightcap."
"Medium body, with moderate carbonation. Chocolate is evident, but is not overly sweet. Well-balanced...this is a beer where everything melds together, and nothing dominates. Slightly creamy, but not really coating. Might lean towards a desert beer for some, but still sessionable."
"If you are going to have a stout, have this one."
"500mL bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours black with a small white head. Excellent lacing. Weak aroma. First taste is a bit tangy from carbonation and I can tell that I need to leave this beer to warm a bit before reviewing further. Now that I've let it warm, it is better, but not signigificantly so. Slightly creamy, hints of chocolate, but not a particularly strong flavour. As it warms even further (1.5 hours out of the fridge), it does improve and the flavours become more pronouced - particularly the chocolate."
"1 pt 0.9 oz bottle: Pours a pitch black with a big fluffy tan head. Aroma is very malty, a nice hoppiness to it too, chocolate of course, coffee, and s slight Pale ale scent to it. Taste is very chocolaty almost like a fudge, big roasty maltiness to it too, sugar, very creamy, almost a bread type note, subtle hops backing, and a faint coffee texture. Palate is somewhat dry, sticky, full bodied, quite long lasting, and a little carbonated. Overall, This is really good for a sweet stout. I think that this is probably my second favorite of this style. A very solid Stout!"
"This is a good beer to finish a meal, a good dessert beer. I could see the sweetness getting to you after one beer. One at a time is enough for me, but very drinkable."
"D- a good stout, but i'm not really a chocolatey kind of guy. it's a good dessert drink or something for a cold night, but it's almost death-by-chocolate. not sweet at all, it really captures the essence of cocoa."
"D- At times I think this could be my favorite beer. Great taste. Its not what I would drink more than a couple of since to me its kinda of a special beer and want to limit when I drink it."
"A good beer to drink on a cold day - which today it is not. Wonder if this would be an interesting backdrop to some hot chocolate."
"I think it was a 16oz bottle I poured into a snifter although I'm not sure of the exact amount. Anyways, a vigorous pour generated a very rich, brown head of about 3 inches. The beer itself poured a jet-black color with ruby edges. Overall lacing is pretty sticky and the bubble patterns in the beer are kind of cool to look at. There is plenty of bittersweet aromas, roasted malts, dark chocolate....and the faintest metallic smell. I'm not sure what that last one is all about, but the rest are pretty damn good! Oh wow. This one tastes like a (not so) hot chocolate! Upon my first sip I'm met with cocoa, lots and lots of cocoa, which are at first very sweet, but then gives way to a nice bitter chocolate taste. Smooth mouthfeel with little carbonation, which I am surprised with due to the massive head."
"D: Fuller body would help flavor hold up better, hence increasing drinkability. The body is still light, so it's easy to get down, but the flavor and feel are lacking."
"D - Pretty clean flavors...I can definitely appreciate the chocolate. I'd like the mouthfeel to be a bit heavier and creamier; I'd enjoy it more. Low abv and light. Good drinkability for sure, but not my favorite sweet stout."
"D - Interesting and highly enjoyable... I would drink again, but couldn't imagine drinking more than one in a sitting..."
"D- I've tried this one twice now and nope I don't care for it at all."
"Pours dark brown nearly black with thick fluffy, chunky milk chocolate head that leaves hefty amounts of 3-D lacing as it slowly falls,damn this looks good!Smells slightly of coffee and bitter chocolate,some dirtyness on the nose.This for me was more coffee than chocolate although there is a ton of both in this gritty stout!I enjoy sweeter chocolates for the most part and this to me is overkill on the more bitter/dark chocolates.I really did enjoy this,it just was'nt what I had expected.The body was very full,with lots of gritty texture,semi-dry finish and pretty nice chocolate aftertaste even more suiting than the upfront bite.I look forward to trying other brews by Youngs."
"overall, i really enjoyed this beer its very tasty, not too expensive and very sessionable...but i bet its not the best for the belt line"
"D - This is one of the best stouts out there great taste and a creamy smooth mouthfeel this beer is worth finding to try"
"Overall a great one, would definitely recommend this one."
"Come to papa... Yessir, this'n is a fine beer. A true delight. A mastery of brewing prowess. Poured with a very fine creamy tan head. Opaque almost black color. abundant chocolate character. Fine carbonation. Everything is in superb balance. Good finish, but perhaps not really a session beer. Still, it's one of the best of its class."
"This ones worth it."
"This remains one of my all-time favorite beers. It can be enjoyed on a special occasion, as a dessert beverage, or as a session beer (at least for me, personally, it can)."
"Overall, a delicious beer that I wanted to try for some time now. I now feel like I need to keep a few of these around. Would be perfect with dessert."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not as filling as most stouts, mild kick, very good representation of style. To be honest, I had lost some faith in how god stouts could be, but this beer has restored it to a certain extent. This is definitely one of the better stouts that I've had."
"I liked this beer very much but I cannot see this as the type of beer that you have in your hand the whole night. But to serve it as a complimentary beverage along side a dessert or something sweet is the way to go. Overall a good drinking stout that has a specific place."
"Overall: I really enjoyed it. Always do when I buy it. I would like to see how this, poured with an Innis and Gunn Oak Aged Beer would do as a Black & Tan."
"it is medium bodied. not malty or creamy. chocolate shows up more in aftertaste. there is a slight bitterness to it. there's nothing too special here."
"Definitely will have this again, and definitely will buy more than one next time!"
"D- A very nice drink however one I could not put too many away at a time, Excellent for an after dinner beer."
"D-near perfect dessert beer i'll be honest here folks i poured a little into a small glass and dipped and oreo in it and it was amazing."
"I expected a good dessert beer and that is exactly what I got. I had a choice between a bottle and a nitro can and went with the nitro can for the extra smoothness. Served it slightly chilled in my Samuel Smith pub glass. Poured a dark, baker's chocolate brown. Smelled like the inside of Willy Wonka's factory with layers and layers of decadent chocolate. Taste was that of fresh chocolate milk with a silky smoothness from the nitrogen bubbles leaving a creamy film in my mouth. I could definitely have one of these after every meal to calm my sweet tooth. Next I will have to try it in the bottle to see if there is any significant difference (I heard the can gives a metallic aftertaste sometimes.)"
"I think it is a beer that almost anyone can enjoy, with most loving it. It seems almost fitting to have it for desert as it has such a sweet and robust flavor that will end any night with a smile. A truly exceptional brew that I always enjoy."
"I had forgotten how good this was, I'll try not to do so again!"
"D - Could definitely drink this pretty regularly"
"Poured a really dark chocolate colour with a coffee coloured head that was thick and creamy and left lacing down the glass. The aroma is very chocolate caramel with a hint of coffee. You can really taste the chocolate and the malt with a slightly coffee taste as well. It is so incredibly smooth and creamy with a light carbonation. This has got to be the most orgasmic beer I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. It was quite expensive for the bottle but in my opinion worth every penny. I'm kicking myself that I didn't buy a few more bottles. I will most definitely be buying more of this."
"I have had this beer before from the bottle. Decided to try from the nitro can this time. I open the can and notice the immediate aromas of chocolate. I can also hear the nitro start to release. I feel the same as that dog when the dinner bell rings! I need to taste this right away. Pours into a tulip glass very nicely. I feel like a child on Christmas eve. I can't wait to taste this. Color is dark and head is a nice ream color. First sip, WOW! So smooth. This is the feeling of true beer love. I can taste the chocolate malts with a tinny bitterness. it just gets better and better with every drink. I'm now to the last drink. I should have purchased more!"
"Not a cheap beer, but well worth every penny"
"I typically do not like Chocolate Stouts but this one was really good. It had more of a deep belgian choco/espresso taste. It had a great color and head. The creamy textured really opened up the taste of the beer where many other stouts are flat & heavy!"
"Overall - Very good, but I think I prefer regular stouts."
"Tastes of sweet/bitter chocolate and roasted malts. Balanced and drinkable."
"WARNING: In my opinion the bottle version is rubbish and the nitro-can is the only way to enjoy this. The proof is that you there are times when the canned version is sold out but there are still bottles."
"Tasted in a Chimay goblet on 3/31/08."
"A good chocolate stout and will probably try this again."
"And excellent dark beer to give to a new-beer drinker.... not overwhelming.... Just delicious"
"I have friends who absolutely love this and consider it their favorite beer, but I think my tastes lie more in the cream stout and dark chocolate stout flavor than this milk chocolate variant. Regardless, it's an excellent, excellent beer, but for the ABV and price, I'd probably pass on this less I really had a craving for this milk chocolate flavor. Highly recommended anyhow, and I'd love to try it again with ice cream or dark chocolate truffles."
"D: Alcohol is lower than expected and makes this a drinkable beer. It is sweet but not too (once again as the bottle claims). You can definitly drink this."
"This beer is a experience. Appearance of a typical draught stout black with a fluffy chocolate cream head. Smell of dark chocolate, milk, light roasted malts. Taste is delicious chocolate malts fresh cream. Highly recommended beer nice beer to enjoy for dessert. Mouthful is smooth and creamy highly drinkable and recommended."
"Drinkability? Well, this is hands down the best stout I've tasted. Actually, I've never really liked stouts before (prefer ales and lagers) but this could easily become a staple for me."
"This is a yummy beer. I like the creaminess the nitro gives. I was not expecting to have as much chocolate flavor. Although I was kinda wishing for more. I've been told it is tasty with ice cream from the bottle. I will have to give it a try that way."
"D-When it comes to beers with chocolate, I think some people go with what kind of chocolate they like. This beer will probably not appeal to those who like dark chocolate. It just doesn't have that kind of flavor. But if you are a milk chocolate lover, I doubt there is anything else you would want than this."
"D: The relatively low ABV and the delicious taste make this beer very drinkable."
"D - A rich beer for the 5.2% it contains. This has excellent potential for drinkability like sessionable stouts, not just as a dessert but as something not overly sweet I could drink a pitcher of this ale. This is world class and the blend of chocolate is really well done. Deserves the reputation as one of the best chocolate beers out there."
"Pours a deep black with beautiful ripples out of the nitro can. Huge creamy tan head that stays for the entire glass as well as some amazing lace. Smell is dark chocolate. Taste is a malty dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is amazing. Smooth, creamy, would love to try this on tap. The drinkabilty is scary, downed two cans in about 30 minutes and could keep that pace going for some time. To bad its 9.99 for a four pack of 14.9 ounce cans, but no doubt its worth the money, at least for special occasions."
"Prost!"
"Pours close to black with a big tan head, leaving sticky lacing on the glass and falling to a ring soon after the pour. Smell is light and subdued. Sweet maltiness abound. Taste brings the chocolate to the table. It's pretty good. Sweet, a hint of dark chocolate, but mostly sweet and rich. A touch of bitterness but just a touch. Nothing too complicated but it's pretty good. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter in body and thinner than most but if you're considering as an English version, it's fine. Decent drinkability but not something I'm looking to try often. Just not quite what I'm wanting in a Stout of any sort."
""
"D - It's ok. Probably, it's more good than mediocre, but still a little lacking - A little light in body and a little light in flavour. The clovey-ness is intriguing though."
"As the beer warmed, it became smoother and more drinkable. But overall, I was really unimpressed with this beer. I would definitely give it another try and hope that this bottle was just a bad example."
"Thin mouthfeel, little to no carbonation. A bit watery, I felt like it was lacking some complexity. I'd say it's worth a try, a little too sweet for me, but it is decently drinkable."
"More bitter and burnt than you'd expect from a milk stout, but still nicely balanced and very drinkable, especially when enjoyed with the dark chocolate truffles I busted out with my second pour."
"Young's Double Chocolate Stout is what would happen if Guinness and chocolate milk had a child. Served in a pint glass from a nitro-can, the first thing that strikes the drinker is the thick, chocolaty pour. The smell parallels the chocolate character of the pint. Excellent mouth feel...smooth, creamy, very little carbonation. Young's Double Chocolate Stout is an excellent dessert beer that I can't see myself getting sick of."
"What a great beer! Genuinely pleasant, sweet and rich. It may not look like a magnificent stout, but that's certainly what it is. Maybe milder than the riproarin'est stout you can get, but this is a supremely drinkable brew that I'll be seeking out again for sure."
"Drinkability - I could drink a few of these, though the richness would be enough to limit me. I'll certainly be coming back to this one when I can afford it again or when I'm in the UK."
"The pressurized can gave off a hissing, wheezing noise when I cracked the seal, causing me to give off a hissing, wheezing laugh. The cascade was not as pronounced as in some of the lighter-colored beers that I have tried of late, but it could still be seen as it occurred. It settled into a thick, deep-tan head like the top of a milkshake. The beer itself was a deep, dark brown with cola highlights. The nose was very chocolaty. The first sip that I took filled my mouth with a milk chocolate taste along with a powdery feeling, like I had inhaled Quik or something like that. The mouthfeel was thin, but the chocolate taste was amazing! The finish was also deeply chocolaty and I wished that I had a dessert to accompany this beer. This was quite good."
"Great Beer, only ashamed I waited so long to try it."
"Perhaps I'm being overly critical here. I could drink this stuff for breakfast, lunch, and dinner..."
"Pours a very opaque black, with brown sugar-coloured head. The head is quite substantial, lasting for nearly the whole glass and leaving lots of lace. The aroma is roasted malt, molasses, hot milk chocolate powder. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth and thick, but a bit dry and chalky as well. The taste is unsweetened chocolate bitterness at the back (funny enough, a bit like eating a mouthfeel of cocoa powder), with a slight kick of fancy molasses. I find it somewhat astringent. The aftertaste is pretty well the same as the aftertaste from eating darker milk chocolate. Let me stress that this is more milk chocolate than dark chocolate despite the bitterness. I find this stout well-rounded and robust. I'd have this again without argument."
"D: I think it's a bit overwhelming, and after two, I was ready for another type of brew."
"For a beer this rampant with chocolate it's surprisingly drinkable. I'm going to have to refill this bowl of butter pecan ice cream to finish this pint off."
"I find this stout well-rounded and robust. I'd have this again without argument. One of the best I've had, and the best to come out of England (which wasn't all that tough, really, considering my vast disappointment after my trip through Kent)."
"Must have more."
"From a bottle into a pint glass. It was as dark as night with an inch of a mocha colored head. Some lacing and decent head retention. Love the nose on this beer. Filled with massive amounts of dark chocolate with malts in the background, specifically hints of caramel malt. Simple but great. Taste like really dark chocolate. They made sure this beer wasn't on the overly sweet side. Finishes with a slight bitterness. Good carbonation. I expected a creamier/thicker mouthfeel. I think this would make a good session beer, but an even better dessert beer. It begs for some chocolate cake."
"Highly recommended"
"This is definitely a must-have, particularly to share with friends who haven't tried it yet. Bravo."
"Beautiful looking pour - a jet black body with a bubbly mocha head. The aroma of milk chocolate wafts upwards with a bi of coffee. Taste is very chocolatey, with the roasted notes coming through in the middle before swinging back to the chocolate. The chocolate taste comes over a tad artificial, and I can't help but think a dark chocolate profile would go better with the roastiness of the stout rather than the milk chocolate they seem to have gone with. Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth, carbonation is low, but present. Its a little too sweet to be a supremely sessionable beer."
"Drinkability = Sorry but I didn't really like it at all. The slight, off metallic flavor, added to the watery feel of the beer wasn't enjoyable to me. Can't say I'll try it again."
"Amazing drinkability. I would highly recommend this to someone who wants a nice winter or spring stout."
"I'd like to try this on tap or in a bottle. a very good stout."
"The beer poured with a deep black body and a big fluffy latte-colored head. This beer is a delicious treat. It smells of roasted malts and dark chocolate on the nose. The taste is a pleasant and dense blend of nutty bitterness and chocolate sweetness on the finish, remaining well balanced and never cloying. It has a surprisingly thin mouthfeel, but it is not overly so and it only adds to it's incredible drinkability. A great dessert beer."
"Very dark, not too chocolatey but a bit too much vanilla in both the nose and the taste. Something to drink after dinner or with a big bowl of ice cream. Good for an adventure or for a change from your usual dark beer. Would go well with a summer evening. Smells sweeter than it actually tastes, and is rather light in texture."
"This brew is almost completely black, very opaque, with a lacy light tan head. Aroma lives up to the name, lots of cocoa and cereal with some caramel. Taste is big-time milk-chocolate, but the hops keep it from being oversweet and cloying. I wish it were a bit richer and more alcoholic, but this is an easy drinking stout most will love."
"The body is smooth and although has a light feel, is still has a presence to it. Overall, I don't get it. This is not a good beer and what some perceive as nitro, I feel is more of an off slick/oily feel. Not a fan."
"d - all said, this is a good stout that is very easy to drink."
"I like this beer...very nice"
"MF&D - The only downside to this stout was it was a little thin. I would have liked it to be a little heavier. The thinness does however make it a little more drinkable and easier to session. This is a quality product and I highly recommend it."
"M/D: Smooth and filling good mouthfeel and decent drinkability as long as you do not take a whiff of the beer."
"I'm a big fan of the coffee/chocolate stout beers, and this was about the best I've had."
"M&D: Creamy and chewy texture that just envelopes the tongue with solid complex flavors. A long pull is most enjoyable, with great mouthfeel and satisfaction. Highly drinkable, especially with the moderate ABV. This is one fantastic brew!!"
"Beer pours out an opaque black with a finger and a half of brown sugar colored head. Beer has dark chocolate smell with coffee as an undertone. The tase was superb, with the creamy chocolate coming through nicely and a taste that lingers long after finishing the beer. The beer was very creamy and smooth, almost has a rich feeling to it. I could probably only drink one or two of these in a night due to its heaviness. I will definitely be drinking another one of these in the future."
"D: I've had this many times and see myself going back to it many times. It is just not a beer I could drink all night, a bit too heavy."
"Although rather filling, I couldn't put my glass down until it was finished."
"The flavor is heavier on the dark chocolate than I can recall from the bottle & tap. Excellent bitter finish, not quite as smooth as the other mediums, but still excellent. There might be a slight tinge of metal in the aftertaste, but the nitro-can is a great way to experience Young's claim to fame. Although I do believe I'll favor the bottle next time, the nitro-can of Double Chocolate Stout is not a disappointment."
"Color is a deep, opaque sable with a decent, fine-bubbled tan head. Aroma is delightful, strong and smoky with firm undertones of chocolate and coffee. Flavor is rich, smoky, with strong chocolate component and coffee undertones - delicious! There is a hoppy undertone, and the aftertaste is hoppy and chocolaty. Highly recommended to all stout/porter fans."
"Awful."
"A very drinkable stout. The best I have ever had from this category. The definition of a dessert beer. Not made for mass consumption but 1 or 3 wont hurt."
"D- Due to the light mouthfeel, and exceptional taste, i feel like i could drink a few of these easily."
"The highest recommendation!"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: I am quite surprised at the feel of this beer, it is much lighter and less smooth than I expected. I was expecting something very velvety, but this is not quite there, sure its smooth, but I think that higher levels of carbonation take away from it. All in all feel is a bit rough around the edges. As I also mentioned it is much lighter in body, it feels a bit weak, like it should be heavier than the medium-light that it is. Though I think it may need work in appearance and mouthfeel this is still a great beer, I recommend it to everyone. This is one of the big boys out there, you should try this before you die. I could sit around and drink this all day, though I feel that my appreciation for it would become much less if I did so. This is a brew that I'll not hesitate to buy again. However, I am wont to buy sixers over single bottles...at the price of about $3.50-4.00 it is getting towards pricey, I think I'd rather buy a sixer of Kalamazoo, in fact I know I would. On the other hand, when I'm in the mood for something with extreme chocolate flavor, this is where I'll turn. Very satisfying, very refreshing, if you love chocolate than this is for you."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I've had this on draught, it was truly an exceptional beer from the tap. In fact, they should probably not do the money/market share grab and only offer this on tap instead of sullying the name with inferior canned and bottled product. (Same could be said for other notable import stouts!)"
"I wasn't impressed however with the nitro-can (I never know how to pour properly with those things) and the mouthfeel and level of carbonation suffered because of it. It was an excellent dessert drink however, and one that I would definitely recommend."
"Deep and dark brown color with ruby highlights and a 1.5 finger head with a deep khaki color that leaves very little lacing.. Smell is fantastic! Very sweet. Smells like a fresh mug of hot chocolate, but better. I'm almost getting a sugar rush just whiffing the thing. Taste is a lot weaker than the smell and offers different perspectives. It's a lot more bitter than the smell, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Tastes a lot more like baking chocolate than hot chocolate. Mouthfeel is a lot lighter than I was expecting from a stout. Carbonation was kept to a minimum. All in all, not a bad brew, but a far cry from what the look and smell indicated."
"D: Flavor is solid but not nearly as smooth as I'd like from a stout. Easy drinking beer with modest alcohol. Not really a warming beer, and I think it could be drank pretty much any time of the year. I'm more a fan of imperial stouts, but I think if this had a bit less carbonation and a bit more body, it would be a really nice session/relaxing beer."
"Started a few rainy mornings during vacations with this one. Love this beer!"
"Nitro cans suck."
"D: This one is nearly perfect. I could go at least half the night on these. They get better as they warm in your glass. So you can take your time."
"D - Desert beer? Technically yes. Delicious? Absolutely so."
"Such a tasty, chocolaty treat. Basically a desert in a pint glass. To bad I only bought a single. Next time I will try the nitro-cans."
"Drinkablity: Great balance, a pleasure to drink. I could pound these all day long."
"D=For as thick as this beer is I feel like I could drink quite a few."
"Pours like you would expect for a stout out of a widget can. Jet black, rains up, creamy head. Nose is slightly alcoholic, but overall smells almost exactly like a murphys or beamish with a the tiniest bit of bitter chocolate waft. Taste is very creamy stout roasted malts with some dark chocolate flavors. On second taste I pick up more of the chocolate, but it seems sweeter. The mouthfeel is good a fake creaminess that you would expect from a widget can. Drinkability is good, but to be honest I would much rather have a murphys or beamish. Enjoyed this one with some good old wisconsin babybels."
"drinkability is great. this is a smooth and easy drinking stout, with a bias towards the chocolate lover. stout fans will find a unique example here, with a refined quality that produces a solid brew. cheers!"
"Though a solid brew, there are much better examples out there."
"M: A little light, milky creaminess. Could afford to have a little more body, but it's quite smooth and very easy to drink back."
"Pours black and no ruby edges in the light of this stout. Buck hide 2 finger head quickly forms and recedes to a circle lingering around the glass. Smell is sweet. Like chocolate brownies! With almonds! And chocolate syrup! Taste like... chocolate milk poured in chocolate cereal. Very faint hint of bitterness follows after the swallow, but this is all about the sweets. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and desert! This is a great beer, but I really can only have one in a sitting, at the end of a night. A great standbye in my fridge!"
"full bodied beer. good carbonation. left some lace. i really like this beer. have not had it in quite some time. had it once at a bar i used to frequent back when i had time for that. could not do session. will drink again next year maybe. great stout. follows style."
"One more note, the bar I had this at last night was doing some kind of Valentine's special and mixed it with Raspberry lambic. I had one of those and I will not be repeating that. If you are a lover of sweet beers, you might give the concoction a try, but I just stuck with the stout straight for the rest of the night."
"An interesting drinkable beer. Probably a very good desert beer. I would like to try this with chocolate in the future."
"This beer looked promising in the glass. Very dark black pour with a chocolate head that thinned out nicely. But as i went into smell it, all i smelled was beer. Dont get me wrong, the hoppy, malty beer smell is ok, but in a flavored beer, i need to smell the flavor along with the taste. Very nice mouthfeel, not watery, not too thick. Alas, the taste leaves something to be desired, for a chocolate beer. Still a great tasting beer, do not get me wrong, just not the chocolatey taste i was hoping for in a double chocolate stout. Now if it were a double stout chocolate, id get it. Too much of a bitter taste in the foreground for me, but the aftertaste does make up for it. There are other chocolates out there id buy first, but id take this one if it were there. And the price was much better than the 6 i paid for another chocolate."
"Poured from a nitro can into a pint glass. A glorious massive tan head emerges, no hills, no valleys, no peaks, just perfectly topped off my pint glass to perfection. The liquid is an oily inky black- sleek and watery, almost like a guiness. Smells of cocoa and malts. Tasted just like a heaping of dark black chocolate, mild roasted malts- clean and balanced. Slight carbonation, nothing overwhelming. This is one of the more easy beers to drink that I have ever had. I also feel as this beer could surely bridge someone into the world of craft beer. Awesome brew, will buy again."
"Pours a nice black from the bottle with a thick, creamy tan head that laces the glass very well. It smells of roasted malts and chocolate. The taste is excellent - a nice roasted malt base with a good sweet creamy chocolate taste at the end that is very pleasent. The mouthfeel is excellent - velvety and not alot of carbonation, just the right amount. The drinkability is pretty good but I wouldn't have more than a few of these because of the thickness that it is."
"d: Pretty tasty certainly, but we make plenty better in the U.S."
"D: When I'm not in the mood to try something new, this is one of my standbys. It goes down very smooth and easily."
"In the end, Young's DCS finishes moderately dry and the overall experience is pleasant. Next time I'll grab a bottle rather than a can."
"D: Again, fun stuff. This is a very drinkable beer. I could see myself drinking several of these in a night. The body is light enough that it doesn't weigh you down."
"D: very good drinkability and enjoyable. one of the better by style."
"d:one of the best chocolate beers i've ever had if not the best; a prefect desert beer"
"Drinkability: Very good. Excellent with a chocolate dessert after dinner. With an ABV of only 5.2%, you can have more than one in a session. I much prefer this to other stouts I've tried (Guinness and Murphy's)."
"I'm not a stout drinker for the most part, but boy, was I ever floored by this! The beer was nearly pitch black and the head was a color like chocolate ice cream. The head didn't leave much for lace, but it was the first thing I drank and the last thing, too. The first smell was overwhelmingly of chocolate syrup with only a little bit of roast to off-set it. The taste was much the same--it seemed identical in flavor and mouthfeel to chocolate milk. There was no hint of the alcohol (until I stood up) and the carbonation was nil, which really worked in its favor. I was floored, but and for /1000, I was not disappointed. I would definitely split a six pack of it with my girlfriend on any quiet night in."
"Pours a rich dark brownish black, with a light brown thick, medium lasting head. Smell is of Rich semi sweet chocolate. Taste is very smooth, creamy, with some light roastiness, and of course some rich bittersweet dark chocolate flavors. Not overly thick, but still very full bodied, and just what I'd want in a stout. Finish is of bittersweet chocolate. Overall, a great beer that is well balanced for my taste. Would recommend."
"feel is ever so slightly watery, but easily made up with the nitro smoothness."
"This is possibly the smoothest and most easy drinking beer I have ever encountered. Young's uses relatively quality chocolate, which I beleive is crucial in this style. There are absolutely no off flavors. Perfect with salty pub cuisine or as a cure for kottonmouth."
"Pours a black color with very little head, only a little lace that clings to one side of the head. Not much smell here, a little sweet malty aroma is about it and no sense of chocolate. Goes down smooth, lightly carbonated, and minimally bitterness. The taste is unbelievable though. It's almost like chocolate utopia in a bottle. The hops and malts are perfectly balanced. There isn't a chocolate stout out there that beats the flavor in this one, IMO. Although, there is basically no head and smell, this is still by far my favorite chocolate stout."
"D- I know that it is categorized a sweet stout but I think it is a dry stout with chocolate flavor. Good drinker for sure though."
"Poured this from a nitro can. Formed about a one inch creamy head and as was brown black in color. Could smell a hint of chocolate. The taste was initially of a stout but then the chocolate really came through. This beer is very enjoyable and drinkable and i am looking forward to trying it again very soon."
"Verdict: A beautiful example of the milk/sweet stout category. Tastes even better from a nitro-can than a bottle. It also beats out comparable stouts in nitro-cans that I have sampled."
"The chocolate comes through wonderfuly. Added to the roasty notes of the malt, it had a cappuccino-like taste without as much bitterness (though there is enough bitterness for good balance)the malt comes through nicely. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk and excellent. I found it to be a bit less heavy than some other stouts and feel like I could drink a few at a sitting. All in all, a very superior stout."
"Young's Double Chocolate Stout pours a nice robust, dark, brownish black. The smell is pleasantly mild of chocolate and malts. There is very a evident smooth chocolate malt taste with a silky texture. This brew is complimented nicely by its taste/mouth combo making it an enjoyable drink well worth the affordable price."
"this is my favorite beer right now. i can't get enough of it."
"If you love chocolate, this is a beer worth trying."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very well brewed beer, nice balances on all fronts, feels fantastic on the tongue, and a thoroughly satisfying experience. More please!"
"D: Great after dinner sipper that is not too sweet for a couple."
"D - Light compared to it's appearance. An easy drinker. It doesn't fill you up and is nice enough to drink more."
"D - Very easy. Smooth and satisfying. Even great with vanilla ice cream!!"
"Smell of Chocolate Ovaltine Powder Mix, with hints of roasted malts and coffee. Very smooth, sweet and creamy, with some dark chocolate and coffee bitterness, on the finish. Very easy to drink, reminds me of Yoo Hoo. Nice dessert beer. Yum!"
"I could drink it again. Whether or not I'd pay for the so-called privilege is another question. :|"
"Drinkability was good for a late evening desert beer. It is perfect for letting friends try and good if you want something that you can savor for a while."
"Poured from bottle into mug. Pours virtually black but some mahogany highlights around rim of mug. Thick, very thick, mocha colored rocky head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is lackluster. Really not much here, some baking chocolate, very powdery, other than that there seems to be and off smell, almost yeast like. Taste was much better. Chocolate, as expected, is rich and full, almost syrup like. Some roasted grains and malt, but mainly chocolate. Somewhat bitter taste left in mouth. Thick and full mouthfeel, low carbonation. Overall a good beer once I got over the smell. I like the lower ABV, it makes this easily drinkable."
"Pours an opaque black. The entire glass was one unsettled bit of stout that had to calm, which took a minute or two. Thick tan head. Nose is a mild chocolate with standard strong malt characteristics in the mix as well. Flavor is smooth with a subtle chocolate tone that lingers and gently caresses the palate. Feel is thick with a decent carbonation. It is drinkable, sure. But for a double chocolate stout, I am not blown away. I had this before in the bottle and wasnt entirely wooed by it and wanted to give it another shot since I figured my palate might have not be en mature enough to appreciate. But yet again, I am just not getting it. I know this is an extremely popular brew, but am I missing something? I love stout, and especially chocolate ones, but this isnt really doing anything for me at all."
"Because it's so smooth, I could I drank it faster than I normally do with a stout, but because it's so rich and full, it's hard to drink more than one or two at a time."
"This was a pretty strange beer... copped a single 16.09 oz can at wine and more in west orange... pours a very odd, opaque color with a huge frothy head seen in layers... dark - black... chocolate is definitely noticeable in the smell... thick, rich chocolate... taste was pretty bitter... not to my liking at all, with a bittersweet, cocoa-espresso finish that was too rich and thick to be truly enjoyable... a little plastic ball was in the can, I guess to shake up the chocolate... wouldn't want to drink more than a few sips of this... wasn't into this brew at all... Not recommended... Young's winter warmer was great but this one didn't do it for me..."
"This is the perfect beer to go a long with a slice of chocolate cake, which I had when I first tried it a few months ago."
"Nice deep brown color with a one finger reddish brown foam head. Lots of lacing all the way through the drink. The smell is a strong chocolate as is the taste. Good mouth feel and aftertaste, but overall not that impressed. The taste of chocolate is overbearing to the point it doesn't taste like a stout should taste."
"This is not a session beer or one that I would have a when I wanted a beer. It's a dessert beer and a fine one at that!!"
"D - Not a fan. This is really watery and thin and the flavor is really light."
"I've never had anything like it before. Incredible chocolate presence (tastes like cadburys) - but it still manages to be a stout somehow. Other notes are present in the taste, such as raisin and coconut. The drinkability is exceptional, I would have expected it to sit in your stomach. Nonetheless I probably would not have more than 2 of these in one sitting. The stout is very lightly carbonated. Ive also had to slightly reduce my rating to compensate for the novelty factor I was experiencing!"
"This is a very solid beer."
"Drinkability? Not difficult to drink this on its own. When you blend it with an Impy Stout, though, be prepared to get toasted."
"Very strange thing to say, but this """milk stout""" does in fact remind me of milk. It's almost the consistency of milk. And given its mellow taste and pleasant mouthfeel, it would be nice to have a glass of this before bed."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a two-finger tan head. The smell is of some chocolate, of course. I also detect some roasted malts. The taste is nice and starts out with a hint of coffee and some roasted grains followed by a big creamy milk chocolate finish. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, and I was surprised by how drinkable this was for a rich beer. I can see myself picking it up again in the future."
"D - depending who you are this could be pretty drinkable or not. even in spite of my liking this beer quite a bit i notice that at times it can be a bit much after the first couple of beers. but on the other hand i've had occasions where i could keep drinking it past several."
"Although I wouldn't consider this a favorite, I'm glad I bought the four pack."
"drinkability - Nice beer, enjoyed this a lot. Have seen it around and gave in to try it. A must if you like chocolate or stouts."
"Nice stout that I will definitely try again when it isn't so cold."
"I have to say that this stuff is absolutely awesome. It is like drinking a Starbucks mocha mixed with a fine stout. Two things that I love so much! It is very sweet with hints of grains mixed with malted chocolate. It is a beer that you really want to enjoy slowly from a nice pint glass. I wouldn't want any more than two of these in a sitting. Make sure it isn't too cold, because you won't taste all of the ingredients."
"Drinkability - An exceptional stout, but too rich to be a regular for me."
"Widget cans provide the best pours. Viscous pour capped off by a creamy, thick head. The appearance of these beers is a thing of beauty. Young's is no different. The smell is a nice mix of chocolate & roasted coffee with some slight fruitiness in the background. Taste follows with a nice sweet chocolate flavor that is extenuated by the coffee notes. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy - very nice for this style. This is an easy drinking stout. A perfect dessert beer. Highly recommended."
"This beer is a good dark chocolate stout. It pours with a darker head than most beers, and is dark as expected. But this beer actually does smell and taste like chocolate as well. If you're looking for a beer to abuse, this isn't it. This is a beer to drink with dessert or if you want a good tasting beer."
"I find this beer extremely drinkable and and enjoyable. You have to like chocolate to like this one."
"D: A very good tasty stout from Young's, I forgot how much I liked this one, haven't had it in a few months. A really tasty beer, any fan of chocolate will enjoy this."
"I'd had it years ago, then had it again recently, and I know now why I remembered it fondly. It's got the fresh, homey feel of some real comfort ingredients. It's almost like sipping a cup of warm cocoa, except not quite. It goes down smooth, finishes clean, and makes the next one an expected pleasure. It's a testament that not every stout has to blow one's doors off in order to make a strong impression."
"Drinkability: Very good, but you might get tired of the chocolate after awhile. However, I wouldn't consider it a chore to go through a nitro four pack (or two)."
"Probably the most drinkable beer I have ever tasted. It goes down so easy it should be illegal. I have had a few stouts in my day, and a few chocolate stouts and none so far have had the drinkability of Youngs Double Chocolate Stout. I will seek this one out again, and its recommended to any stout lover or chocoholic. Not the cheapest stout you can buy but well worth it."
"This beer was tough to talk about other than it was just chocolate everywhere."
"Drinkability - this has been one of my favorite beers for several years now. I took some to a father-son campout and everyone who tried it loved it. I'll be bringing more to share around the campfire next year."
"Quite a tasty beer that is smooth and easy to drink. Perhaps too rich and chocolatey for everyday drinking, but definitely nice to have."
"A highly recommended brew."
"The mouthfeel is really the highlight of this one."
"D = After the high marks I have given the other aspects of this beer I almost feel guilty only giving it a 4 for drinkability, but the truth is this is so rich, it is hard to imagine drinking too much of it. Definitely worth a try and a nice thing to have on hand for guests who appreciate good beer, but not necessarily for a normal relaxing after work sort of drink."
"D: For the style this is a really refreshing and drinkable beer. I always seem to have a few of these in the fridge because my gf loves this beer. The best desert beer I have ever had. I have heard of pairing this with chocolate or strawberries. That is pure hippy crap. This beer stands on it's own. I would recommend people get this in the nitro can instead of the bottle. I have had both and for once the can wins."
"Pours black with a creamy tan head. Aromas of sweet cocoa and chocolate, as well as a roasty malt. In the taste, just as it smells, a sweet cocoa/ chocolate and a roasty malt. A smooth, full body mouthfeel and dry malty chocolate aftertaste. Big chocolate flavor and smooth. A very nice stout."
"I like the fact that even though this beer is huge on flavor and smoothness, it's not got a huge ABV like a lot of these kind of flavored stouts. You can feel like you're spoiling yourself without having to deal with a huge buzz."
"D: Exquisite, rich, and chocolaty, but not so sweet you'll wish you hadn't had the whole pint. Very drinkable after a hearty meal."
"Overall: I have been drinking this beer sporaticly for years now, and was surprised to see that I have never reviewed it. Now I have. Good beer."
"From a four pack of nitro cans. I really love the ever-present head that comes from nitro. It also has a really smooth carbonation. I'm not a big fan of chocolate shouts with actual chocolate added, but if I was, this might be my favorite. The first sip is really when it hits you...the chalky chocolate mouthfeel really dominates this ale. About halfway through the glass I couldn't taste the chocolate anymore, and only then could I detect a tiny malt and hop presence. This one goes down really easy even though I like to savor each sip to see if I was going to get malt or chocolate."
"D- This is definitely one of the sweetest beers I have come across. I was taken back at first by this but it slowly grew on me. When held in the mouth the bitterness and roasted characters are more prevalent and bring more balance to the brew. My 16 oz. can was definitely enough for one sitting but this is something I will certainly have again."
"Easy drinkability. Surprisingly not to heavy for a stout."
"On tap in a pint glass. Dark chocolatey brown with a thin layer of medium brown foam. Smells of chocolate and not much else. The primary flavor is chocolate, with a bit of vanilla and some nuts, but nothing reaches out and grabs you except for the chocolate. It's not over the top though, and not bitter. Very smooth in your mouth, not very carbonated. I don't know that I'd want to drink more than one of these, but that's because it's so rich and one is plenty and I don't consider that a negative."
"This beer drinks great. Love it when I want desert!"
"500 ml bottle. Pours an opaque dark brown with an ample dark tan head that dissapated slowly. Aroma was faint and sweet milk chocolate like. Flavor was chocolate liquor like with some coffee and a distinct dusty earthiness. Just a touch of hops, more would have been welcome. The palate was was medium full and fairly clean, just a slight stickiness in the aftertaste. Finished short with sweet chocolate liquor lingering. Overall: An interesting beer; recommended"
"D- It is a little too much for me to want to drink a lot of these in one sitting. However, it is a good beer and definitely pleasing to me in small quantities."
"This is a great chocolate stout. It pours smoothly and when it finally settles you have a glass of sweet black goodness. Correction, sweet black chocolaty goodness. It smells slightly sweet and has a distant chocolate whiff, not over powering. The taste is just as smooth as pouring the beer. It coats your mouth with its beer mojo. The chocolate flavor follows is there but lasts long into the after taste. Now thats a tasty beverage."
"Damn enjoyable. I honestly don't know how anyone couldn't like this. This would be a great transitional beer. Its like drinking dessert! That said, this might be one of the best dessert beers I've had. Chocolate is obvious, but also anything with nuts, caramel, coffee, cakey, etc. It might also (this will sound odd) work with a really creamy, smoooth cheese. Could be sessioned like mad. Again, what's not to like about this? One of the easiest to drink, smoothest, sweet beers I've tried. Definitely recommended!"
"Pours black with a big tan head. Nice lacing Aroma is mostly dark burnt malt with notes of chocolate and hops. As I drink the beer the chocolate aroma becomes much more pronounced. Taste is at first like sweet milk chocolate becoming a bit bitter from the roasted malt. A touch of hops provide balance. Pleasant light lingering bitter chocolate taste. Mouthfeel is medium. Pretty drinkable. Very nice chocolatey stout."
"The best part of this is actually mouthfeel. This has a smooth,silky, somewhat oily texture that sits on the palate and is very pleasing. Medium body and good drinkabilty."
"Overall, one of the best milk/sweet stouts I've had. Big chocolate flavors make this the definition of a dessert beer. It makes me look forward to winter."
"Appearance of this beer is outstanding. Almost black, very little light, if any can pass through it. Nice creamy tan head, with great lacing. Smell of this beer is a mix of sweet and bitter chocolate. The taste is very much roasted malt and chocolate. The stout flavors and the chocolate mix very well together. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. The drinkability of this beer is very good. Goes down a lot easier then I thought it would. Overall, I love this beer. I didn't think I would, but the balance of the chocolate and beer flavors are perfect. Not overly sweet, but very tasty."
"Pours black with a tan head that is comprised of bubbles of varying size. The aroma is mostly chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is big on the chocolate, with not much else behind it. Lightly sweet and hardly bitter at all. The mouthfeel is somewhat watery with a nice bite from the carbonation. This beer is very easy to drink. No offensive flavors at all, but not much complexity either."
"Overall, very enjoyable. This is unique in many ways. Perfect if you are in the mood for something a little more adult than chocolate milk."
"Overall- A great representation of the style. I'll continue to come back to this as an after-dinner beer or something to serve with a chocolate dessert."
"D - This is the perfect desert beer..and with a low ABV makes a great after dinner beverage. I truly wish I had bought more than just the one bottle..I think I would've had another tonight"
"Pours a deep dark black with light caramel colored head. No light gets through at all. Smell seems pretty subdued to me but some deffinate hints of dark chocolate and roasty malts. The taste of this beer is where it's at. Dark chocolate, sweet roasty malts, coffee beans. Strong roastiness finishes. No real hop bitterness, just from the roasted malts. Velvety smooth mouthfeel. This is one of the few beers my girlfriend doesn't proclaim to be """too bitter""" in her words and is very enjoyable on a cool gloomy day like we're having here. Excellent!"
"Just got done drinking this beer and wow! I picked it up tonight from a store on a whim and I'm glad I did. It poured a nice dark shade with a thick fluffy tan head that faded away until it was just a coating on top of the beer that remained until the end. The nose is a light chocolate smell. Not overpowering and very nice. Is silky and smooth with a chocolate taste with a nice dry finish. Very refreshing and now I'm wishing I had purchased more than one!"
"Taste is very rich with lots of chocolate and caramel in the forefront with an almost rye-like graininess coming out as an afternote. Lactic sourness helps to balance things out a bit, roasted malt is subdued but there. Finish is fairly wet and musty again in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with a medium carbonation, just right for the style. This is a well-balanced and extremely enjoyable example of a style that can easily get too sweet for my liking. Well done."
"This beer pours jet black, with an average sized tan head which disappears quickly. The smell is out of this world -- coffee, chocolate and caramel. The light carbonation gives it a very silky feel, and it goes down nicely. All in all this is a great tasting stout. Not bitter at all, and extremely flavorful. Even my wife, who hates stouts, absolutely loved this one."
"Re-review: on recent drinking, I don't like this beer as much as I initially did. Too much of a chocolate topping flavour and aroma, could stand to be a lot more subtle. Still good, but not great."
"One of my favorite beers. I really enjoy drinking this with a piece of chocolate to nibble on. If I had to choose one keg to put into my apartment, this would be it. It's got a great pour, doesn't sour at all and finishes really smooth. I'd pay twice as much for this beer!"
" This is actually very light at 5.2% and the nitro can only adds to the smoothness."
"The nitro can is a nice touch, the beer came out wonderfully with a nice thick head. Has very nice chocolate overtones, what I thought of as dark chocolate, compared to other chocolate beers that had more generic chocolate scents. Very nice taste, a nice sweet stout, with nice swirls of chocolate in it. Goes down smooth and easy, it would be very easy to drink a few of these in one setting if they weren't so thick."
"Drinkability: Awesome. I love smoothe, drinkable stouts that are low in alcohol and have plenty of flavor to offer. While not the most complex of beers, this definitely holds a niche and I will certainly try again, maybe in bottle form. Nicely done."
"D- a solid sweet stout"
"D- A very unique experience. I was not sure how i felt about it at first, but by the end I was really enjoying this."
"D - Average for flavored stouts. Not something I'd have more than one of per night."
"This poured very dark, which to no surprise, gave a rich brown but light head that reminded me of Chocolate Mousse. It gave a slight chocolate smell and had me curious as to what the taste was going to be. I was let down here. There was a chocolate taste, but it was somewhat an empty taste. I didn't want an overpowering chocolate syrup taste, but this was just disappointing. It needs a little more sweetness, although I still would not want to see it too rich. It was more like a Mole' sauce than rich sweet chocolate."
"Overall: Nice chocolate stout. I like Rogues version better, but this one is very good nonetheless. If enjoyed as a dessert beer in moderation it is really quite enjoyable."
"Delicious, but despite what you may expect, it's not that drinkable (surprising, I know ... but a beer this chocolate flavored exhausts you after a while)."
"Could not drink many of these mainly because they are like a meal in themselves"
"Drinkability: As good as this beer is, and as much as I love the flaovr and the aroma, I couldn't drink a lot of these due to the sheer heaviness of it. I'll keep this one as an after dinner treat"
"This brew is a winner people.Pours very dark, just as a stout should.Lovely creamy frothy cocoa head that stays the whole way down.( This is a nitro can ) I'm not a coffee drinker but if Juan Valdez made this i would drink coffee non-stop.Of course the choclate is there in the smell as well as a nice dark malty carmel note. The flavor in the mouth is a cocoa lovers dream. It's so creamy and smooth as the chocolate flavors carress the mouth and bring lingering caramel malts to the tounge. This is a fantastic brew brought to us Americans by the founding fathers from mighty England. This beer is one of my new regulars."
"The carbonation is medium, almost lively."
"A very enjoyable beer, especially after dinner or a late evening relax mode drink.This one is actually quite easily to drink,but to me,it does not taste as good as it smells,hey...it still tastes good,don't get me wrong,but the aroma is...appetizing,delicous..Top Notch...very good beer,,well worth trying."
"After enjoying the wonderful sound the nitro insert makes, I poured into a 18 oz pint style glass. Poured similar to most """in the can""" stouts. Really active and fairly quick cascade that left an incredibly smooth and uniform tan head... Smell roasted barley and coffee with undertone of the chocolate to come... Tastes pretty much as expected. The choclate comes through nicely, more than is hinted in the nose... Silky, smooth, but not cloying. quite drinkable for a sweet stout. I'll buy it again this winter."
"Very sexy-looking brew- deep dark brown pour with the nitro head which is lighter in color than i expected. Huge roasted malt aromas along with some mocha. Big chocolate flavors- king of like hot cocoa made with water instead of milk- but not bad. I like the slight bitterness which come through the slightly sweet chocolate flavors. There is a tannin like astringency in the finish- like bittersweet chocolate and a hint of tobacco. Extremely smooth creamy mouthfeel; the brew slides down so very easy. Nice and refeshing stout with good strong flavors."
"Pours an opaque almost black brown with a HUGE tan head that dies slow and leaves behind sheets of lacing. Smells of chocolate and roasted malt. Taste is very malty and a lot of chocolate. Very tasty and what I expected and wanted. Creamy in the mouth, little carbonation and very drinkable and not too filling. A tasty treat."
"No false advertising here. The chocolate is highly noticable from the get-go. A very dark brown to black beer with a nice tight tan head. Looks heavy, but the taste aint. Smooth, balanced, and, of course, chocolatey. All in all an extremely tasty beer. And, if that's not enough, bottles are quite reasonbly priced and easy to find, at least in my neck of the woods."
"Pours burnt brown color (nearly black) with a very creamy light brown head that hangs around for the duration. Aroma consists of sweet toasted malts, mainly chocolate with hints of coffee and caramel. Taste is creamy chocolate up front, with smaller notes of coffee and caramel, but also a nice subtle hop presence before the finish. Very easy drinking and light on the palate, not quite the heavy mouthfeel and bold flavors that I had expected, but I am still pleasantly surprised. I am not so much of a stout guy, but this is a very nice beer, and one that I will buy again."
"It pours out black. My pour was a little rough, and it gave me nearly four fingers of light brown head. It slowly dissipated, though, and some lingered. A little lacing. The aroma is chocolate - sweet and creamy, with a note of licorice, too. However, the taste isn't as rich as I was expecting, although it's still good. I can't quite place it - the dark, roasty, chocolatey notes are there, but they're subtle. It feel light and clean, for a stout - there's no strong alcohol to punch you in the face. The hops come through in the finish too, although I couldn't detect them in the nose. It somewhat creamy, and mostly just nice in the mouth. All these features make it easy to drink, too, although not intensely compelling."
"D: Definitely a drinkable beer. The bartender claimed that this stuff filled her up, but I could have drank it all day long. My friend will drive 30 minutes just to go to the bar where this stout is served. Definitely an excellent beer."
"The smell is overwhelmingly chocolate. The taste starts off like milk and then the chocolate hits the palate. It finishes in the back of the mouth with a little malty overtone. Very interesting style and was quite impressed with the beer overall."
"So far it has been a good one but I know their better ones out there so I might get back to this one."
"D - This beer is absolutely fabulous. I recommend ANY stout lovers to try this. This is now one of my favorite beers of this style."
"Drinkability: Once again this drink is fantastic. It goes down very smooth and is not overly sweet and taste liked a iced chocolate milk. Wonderfully smooth and not overly malty so you can enjoy quite a few of these."
"Personally, it reminds me of slowing drinking one of those ominous shots that involve Guinness, Bailey's, and Jameson. As long as you haven't had too many unfavorable experiences with that one, you should be fine."
"This beer delivers what it advertises. It tastes and smells like chocolate. I poured it into a glass and it was about the color of cola with a thin, almost burgundy-to-brownish head. You can really pick up the chocolate aroma. There was a strong presence of chocolate flavor as well. Not sweet milk chocolate but more of a Hershey's Special Dark kind of semi-sweet chocolate. Normally I like beer that just tries to taste like beer but this stuff was pretty good. I liked it. I wouldn't drink it all night, though. I'd drink one of the large bottles then switch to lagers and/or pilsners. Definitely worth a try."
"This beer smells and tastes like baker's chocolate. If you've ever tried to eat baker's chocolate thinking you're getting a sweet treat, you find that it's bitter, but still pleasant. That's how this is, but you're expecting bitter since it's a beer, but this is sweet as well, so it's awesome. The head was completely present the entire time which was pretty cool. I could see myself drinking a couple of these, but they are pretty rich, so a point off drinkability. It looks dark black with an off-white head, which is great."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this stout, especially for the taste and it"""s exceptional drinkability. If You see It, try it! Whether you a stout man or woman, I think you will enjoy this beer. I highly recommend this stout, and can"""t wait to try it again."
"Great all around milk stout. Nice smell, nice taste, and definatly very drinkable."
"D: With a great taste and an alcohol content of 5.2% its easy to have a few and still function. Very drinkable, but I can't help but think (I had this after killing myself in the gym) that this is probably loaded with calories. I suggest bringing this one to the next family function, bring a bunch, it'll be popular!"
"This is a great beer, even if you're not a huge chocolate fan (which I'm not). Easily consumed year-round, in my opinion, although I'll be more inclined to buy more of it when the weather cools off a bit. Relatively mild ABV is nice too. And it's light enough in texture that you won't feel like you're drinking a loaf of bread as happens with some heavier stouts at times. Try this beer and enjoy."
"Drinkability: A beer so good, that I suspect someone will soon come barging in here and try to disrupt all the fun I'm having. That's how good I think it is!"
"It's frothy and creamy. The head retains and laces well. A perfect nightcap. I can't see having a lot of these but there nice to have around."
"D: Great if you want to get drunk off chocolate or chocolate milk and there's none to be found - but it's awfully expensive for chocolate milk."
"D: All around an excellent night cap. Not so much a session beer because of the sweet factor, but a delicious single anytime. This is the staple chocolate stout for a reason."
"I've had this beer before on tap at a local Mellow Mushroom restaurant. At the time, I was bowled over by its rich, creamy, bittersweet chocolate flavor. Just tonight, I revisited this classic example of the Milk Stout style, but in a can. I can't say it lived up to the earlier experience. While the brew exhibited most of the same characteristics as its on-tap kin, it just didn't have the same intense flavor profile. The beer poured its dark, dark brown color into my Sam Smith pint glass. While pouring, I heared the """widget""" bouncing around in the can. This certainly provided a full, dense head and a nice creamy texture to the beer. The aroma was mainly of dark malts; there was very little else to be noticed here. My memory of the taste was of dark malts with a bigand I mean bigdark chocolate flavor. In this version, the malts were certainly present but the chocolate was subdued. It felt as though I were drinking Guinness with a bit of chocolate added. I definitely noticed an improvement as the beer warmed. The creamy mouthfeel of this beer is fantastic, even with the flavors stunted. I'll have to try this again on tap to see if an anomaly has occurred or if there is a real difference between the two."
"This beer would be close to the top of my list when Im thinking of an aromatic stout."
"To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of the milk and sweet stouts I've tried but this is my favorite. I like a more bitter, hopped, drier stout. Despite that, this is a quality beer that lives up to its name, my tastes aside. Perhaps part of the reason is that it's hard to pair a beer like this with food for me, except maybe as or with dessert."
"I grabbed a 4 pack of pint cans at premier gourmet in Buffalo NY. Got home and chilled a bit, not too much. Poured black with extremely thick bodied head that sticks to the glass the entire session. Smells of roasted coffee and chocolate. The chocolate taste and feel is reminiscent of a milkshake or chocolate milk. The slight coffee bitterness afterwards, leaves you wanting more. Definately a perfect end to anyday."
"Picked up a 4-pack of bottles from the store where I work and drank from a wide-mouth pint glass. This beer poured pure black with a rich head that clung to the sides of the glass all the way down. Held up to the light, it was totally opaque, nothing came through, no glow even. It smelled like dark chocolate as its name implies with the hint of biterness that goes along with dark as opposed to milk chocolates. In the mouth it felt full and velvety and coated the throat as it went down. A delicious dessert beer, maybe it was because I had worked all day before putting it down, but when I was done, I was sleepy! I couldn't see drinking these all night, but it was fantastic as a one-off to end the day."
"Pours black with a nice fine grained tan head that mostly fades and leaves some spotty lacing. There are aromas of vanilla, cocoa, dark chocolate, sherry, and a slight roastiness. The taste is smooth cocoa up front ans a sligght bitterness on the finish. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a reasonably substantial body. Good beer, but a little one dimensional to consume much of."
"D: Medium Low. I wouldn't want more than two of these. The chocolate is very rich, but luckily not very sweet."
"D-As always this is a great dessert beer. It goes well with any sort of dark chocolate. I have always loved this beer, it is definitely different in the nitro can."
"D: This beer is a good dessert beer as it is super sweet. It would be difficult to consume a lot of unless you were doing so with another flavor that was really bitter and salty to cancel out the sweet chocolaty taste."
"A few years ago I tried quite a few Young's beers in England, and didn't think they were anything out of the ordinary (at least by England's ale standards). This one is the exception - I will look out for Young's more now, even though there aren't too many that make it to my part of the world."
"D - A very nice beer indeed. Perhaps not to everyones liking but if your into stout or dark beers in general this is a must."
"D: Highly enjoyable; the chocolate is almost overwhelming at first, but as everything else comes to the palate, it becomes a wonderful beer that will have me coming back for more."
"D: A nice desert beer. Creamy and rich without being to heavy which makes drinkibility high. Recommended."
"Young's Double Chocolate Stout pours a rich brown black with a thin head. Extra points for filling my Samuel Smith pint glass perfectly to the top. Aroma is sweet, creamy chocolate and astringent roasted malts. Taste is more chocolate, nice and creamy with dark roasted malts apparent. The bitterness seems to come largely from the dark malts. I like the flavor, I think it could just use a little more sweet malt background to complement the roasty chocolate flavor."
"Drinkability: This is easy to drink, and is fairly low alcohol. If I had more, I would perhaps have another."
"alcohol by volume of only 5.2% quite sessionable as well."
"M: Incredibly rich, chewy, thick and silky smooth, like drinking a well-blended shake."
"D - Keep in mind this is a nitro-can from across an ocean. I wouldn't think the bottle is better, or even as good, but would love to have a shot at this brew fresh from the source. This is not a sipping beer, it is a pub beer t go enjoy in a group, and maybe in high quanitities. That's the place for this, because most people can't have 10% ABV beers and make it more than an hour or so of lively company. So, there is a great place for this stout, and I think they did hit it on the head here."
"I like this beer but my expectations were much higher. If the aroma and taste matched the drinkability would be an outstanding beer."
"The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for a stout, but the drinkability is pretty good."
"I coud definately drink several of these, its definately great with deserts or just by itself FOR desert. I looked for this the moment I got back to Albany and found it at Oliver's Beverage."
"D - Overall a very nice dark session beer. A little light compared to its big brothers in the field, but a fine brew none the less. It was nice to be able to put it down with feeling too full and falling down at the end which was definatly a plus."
"This was my first experience with YDCS and it was very good. As I've said, I bit sweeter than I expected. Definitely need to take this into account and decide if the time and/or pairing is right."
"Drinkability was fine. At 5.2% ABV... it is a good beer to enjoy all evening long. You can probably toss back 5-6 pints over the course of an evening without feeling any ill effects. PROST!"
"Overall, I like it and I will have it again sometime, though next time I will split the bottle with a good friend. A good Beer for a small, quiet social gathering, because it's a tasty sipping Beer."
"Drinkabillity - Tasty. I'll definitely take another. Nice treat that I've been picking up more than passing up when it catches my eye at the liquor store."
"I'd like to try it on tap or at least from the bottle."
"D: An excellent dessert beverage! Not so heavy that it'd kill you at the end of a meal, and nicely sweet to complement the final course of the night."
"I was drinking the 500mL bottle, I remember it being better in the nitro-can - more creamy."
"Drinkablilty- Like most heavy stouts, I wouldn't drink this one to get drunk. Never in my life, however, could I picture myself turning one of these down at any point in the day."
"From the 14.9 oz can into a glass. Pours dark brown with a chocolate milk shaded head. The head is nice and lasted the whole time I was drinking it. Smells of chocolate and a bit of cofee, not to strong or complex, but nice. No surprises in the taste. It feels very milky and silky and goes down quite easily. I like it, but it lacks a bit of complexity, but it's a very, very drinkable stout. And you can't go wrong for the price."
"Quite drinkable...one glass, that is. Another? I'll pass for tonite."
"All i can say is wow... poured black with a creamy off-white head that stayed with the beer until the very end. rich creamy chocolately flavor and smell but not overpowering. finished smooth and left me wanting another one. highly recommended. by far, the best beer i've had yet"
"** I only don't rate the drinkability higher because it is so filling I do not think I could drink more than 2 in one sitting and not feel full!"
"The beer pours a rich dark brown color. The head cascades up the glass arousing the sense of anticipation. When the bubbles finally settle they leave you with a rich, smooth, tan head. The aroma is filled with chocolate, vanilla and coffee. The taste follows along those lines. The chocolate is subtle, vanilla envelopes the palate and you're left with a toasted coffee aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth, and rich. The carbonation from the nitro can is perfect for this style, not too much but just enough so that it is not flat. The drinkability is good, but I'm not one to drink too many of these in one sitting."
"Bottle. Yep, chocolate. Double chocolate. Poured dark brown with big tan head. Despite the chocolate, the hops still are clear and good. Great palate. Good nose. Good all the way around. I have laid in a stock of these now that Youngs is gone. It is going to be hard to drink the last one. Sort of like eating the last Passenger Pigeon."
"I have had this before in the UK, and several years ago in the US. I was expecting it to have a stronger flavor. It must be the recent Imperial Stouts I sampled recently."
"The sweetness and roasted malt of this beer went very well with my meal. I preferred this to the Bayhawk. I would have liked to compare it to the Young's Oatmeal Stout that they also had on tap. I had had taster size portions of both before and am glad I came back to this one; I'll definitely come back both Young's Chocolate and Oatmeal sometime again."
"This was definitely a sipper as it was very rich and creamy. Still an enjoyable brew although i was a little bit let down i was expecting a little more from this brew. But the first chocolate stout i had was rogue's, so that puts the bar pretty high"
""
"D: Phenominal! Milk stouts don't get much better than this."
"Fond memories of this guy on tap. This bottle was not quite as good as I recalled. Still tasty though, so much chocolate."
"Drinkability-meaning could I drink a few of these at anyone time? No-I think one of these will be enough. I enjoyed this beer and would like to taste this and a Mackensons back to back"
"Drinkability - this is delicious and hearty. This is good ale, and quite sessionable."
"Great job with this one. Young's really has it together."
"I got this in a nitro-can at the Franklin Market of Choice, Eugene, OR. Poured into a pint glass with a thick (1-2 cm) and very long-lasting and very creamy head that's off-white in color. The color is black, with some hints of red-brown under a light. Smells fantastic of sweet milk chocolate - like you stuck your nose into a bag of good milk chocolates - that's the dominant smell - hardly any roasted malt or smoke smell. There's some lacing, but not a lot. It has a great mouthfeel - creamy and delicious and hardly any bubbles - like drinking a glass of milk. The taste is really just like chocolate milk without much of an aftertaste. It smells stronger than it tastes - very drinkable. I'll definitely be buying this again."
"Straight 4's, a good beer."
"Not my favorite chocolate stout but certainly not a bad one. I think the bitter chalky aftertaste and the slightly syrupy quality throw me on this one. I prefer Sam Adams Cream stout."
"Thanks to Wasatch for this sample!"
"the best about this brew however is how it pours: almost crude oil dark with a finesse of liquid gold ... pure simple beauty ...."
"Grabbed a pint to sip, although it took a minute for it to warm up. Really, this stuff tastes just like Guinness when its cold. Let it sit and a mellow dark chocolate flavor comes out. This beer looks great though. And you're really into appearance, the thick lacing and head on this can't be beat. Still I think this beer is a little over-rated. While the flavor is nice, I dont find it very complex or worthy of high marks."
"Now there's only one ray of hope left-- drink it on tap..."
"Very dark chocolate in color with a nice creamy healthy head. Smell is mostly hard candy chocolate with a hint of vanilla. Taste is lightly roasted malts with chocolate with a earthy flavor. This is med - full bodied thats creamy with just the right amount of hops to round it out nicely, makes for a nice treat."
"Wow.what a fun beer to pour from a widget can. It is dark with the tiny nitrogen bubbles  looks very thick. The smell is great  almost like a chocolate shake. It tastes like chocolate as well. This is almost like a beer flavored hot chocolate which is served cold. The mouthfeel is chewy, but not oily. While this is a delicious beer, its thickness and sweetness make it almost like a dessert beer  so not drinkable in the since of more than one."
"Overall tasty and easy to drink, great light session stout."
"Overall a very mild stout that is easy to drink. Not as chocolatey as I expected for a double chocolate stout. I had expected a little more robust flavor as well. However, although the flavors are mild they do meld well."
"This is one fine beer! The nitro-can gives it supreme creaminess, however I enjoyed the flavor a little better out of the bottle. Nevertheless, both are great, it just depends on what serving vessel you prefer."
"D:Anyone who enjoys stouts would most certainly enjoy this offereing. Has all the qualities of a great stout, with a much bigger chocolate kick."
"Drinkability: This is incredible! This almost reminds me of enjoying a mocha latté for breakfast. I believe I have found a new favorite sweet stout. Still amazed."
"D- It covers your mouth in milky goodness as if you had a sample creamer. I was suprised at the low ABV in this beer you could definatly session this beer, although it is a bit pricey. The bitterness could be a bit more present but I think that it works for this genre."
"Germans may have their lagers and wheats but the Brits have stouts and no one, and I mean no one, can top this one!"
"I'm happy that I gave this beer another chance. Overall, it is quite drinkable with a nice chocolate flavor that lends itself well to the style."
"The phrase Double Chocolate on the can should be all one needs to know about this beer. Take chocolate milk mix powder and thrown in some coffee beans. Mmm, good! Needless to say it's dessert in a glass. But I was still a bit dissapointed because I was waiting for that big rush of flavor which never came."
"I've had this in a nitro-can before and enjoyed it, but I thought it might be even better from the tap. Let's see...None of the reverse-cascading head effect so loudly touted on the sides of nitro-cans, but what we have is decent nevertheless: dark chocolate brown body with a modest but sticky, crater-marked dusty tan head. Soft cocoa aromas along with some slightly sour black roasted malt scents. Reminds me of chocolate flavored licorice whips. That soft, chewy cocoa flavor is present at various points throughout the taste, but it is also interspersed with some dark-roasted graininess that borders on burnt. Some mild dark berry notes are in there, too, along with some well-placed and well-restrained residual sugars. Just sweet enough to remind you that it's a lacto-stout, but nothing too overbearingly sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth enough, remaining full-bodied while never feeling too heavy on the palate. A high-quality session stout that I imagine must rarely fail to please."
"Drinkability- Pretty damn good.."
"Highly recommended if you are looking for something new and different."
"A great afternoon sipper or winter warmer. Low abv alows for sweet long sessions."
"drinkable brew but do not make the misstake of drinking it too well chilled or it will taste a bit thin."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Appears a deep, dark brown with about two inches of nice creamy, tan foam. Smells of bittersweet chocolate and dried fruits. Tastes of milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and sweet malts. A little thin in the mouth but smooth enough to satisfy with a medium body and carbonation. A pretty drinkable stout, but one I personally would enjoy at the end of a meal."
"Poured into a Ayinger glass a nice clear black color, nice carbonation, tiny tan head which left quickly, some lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, vanilla, and chocolate/caramel. The taste is very nice of malts, lots of vanilla, and some chocolate/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice stout, makes a good session brew."
"It's definately a desert sipper, but not one I'd esspecially go out and purchase."
"Other comments: Really damn good! More balanced than some of the American versions I've tried."
"D - It's very good, although initially I wasn't really feeling it; both the taste and smell kind of creep up on you, but once they hit you the sweetness in the flavor it delicious; very drinkable, especially for a fairly heavy beer"
"I've had this on tap, in a bottle, and from nitro-can, and I have to say its been the best so far from the nitro-can. Poured from a nitro-can, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark brown, almost black, forming a thick 1/2 inch creamy head that never let up, with a nice cascading affect. Thick rings of lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is of nice chocolate, just like chocolate milk. The taste is very creamy, sweet, and chocolaty. Nice roasted malts all the way from start to finish. The mouthfeel, IMO, is just right for this style of stout. From my experiences, milk stouts, normally have a lighter mouthfeel, than you would expect from a stout like Sierra Nevadas or Saint Arnolds. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer. I'm not sure I could drink several of these at a time, but I would love to keep a pak of these in the frig at all times."
"D: Exceptional for the stout category. Not many stouts can be had in volume, but this one fits that occasion."
"Not too bad, but not a huge fan of nitro cans and bottles."
"Since I don't want to sound like most other reviews of this beer, I'll add a few things I did not notice from other reviewers. Like hints of Toffee. Head started strong then dissipated quicker than I wanted. Very easy to drink for such a dark beer. I would recommend this especially to the drinker who wants to venture to the exotic but really doesn't care for super heavy brews."
"Drink-Ability: I picked this one up at brawleys not to long ago in Charlotte and I really enjoyed it.But I wish it did not cost so much $$$"
"overall a beer worth buying over and over, but it may be a bit too heavy for regular use."
"bottled. dark pour with a thick consistency. This tasted a bit flat to me, maybe an old bottle. the chocalate flavor was nill considering the """double chocolate""" label and only a mild hint of coffee. I would not buy this again at this price."
"This is a very dark beer that looks completely black even in bright light, and the only thing that breaks up the darkness is the tan head on top, this is a very good looking beer.it has a heavy, dark chocolate smell to it that slowly calms down after pouring into a glass. It has a smooth feel to it but it still lacks something, it simply doesn't caress your mouth like a some beers do; it feels cold and leaves you longing for something more. It does have a good taste to it sort of sweet with a good bittery aftertaste."
"Drinakbility - 4"
"This stout pours a nice deep dark brown with a very creamy head. The head retention is excellent, lasting the whole glass. The smell is clearly roasted malt and chocolate, with a bit of coffee. The taste is also of roasted malt and sweet chocolate, very smooth and tantalizing. Very good mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"This was a nice dessert beer to round out a great night of tasting."
"Drikability: A beer this flavourfull couldnt get much easier to drink. But the sweetness / bitterness is of extreemes and would eventually get too much."
"All in all a great stout. Like a meal in a can!"
"pours a black color with a very dense one finger head and very thick clinging lace. smell is chocolate with a hint of coffee. taste, semi sweet dark chocolate and burnt coffee. surprisingly light mouthfeel with a very weak carbonation. its not my style of beer but an occasional one or two would be fine."
"Poured out of a nitro-can. The cascading head is the one of the coolest things ever. Once the beer settles you are left with a creamy light tan head of supper fine nitro bubbles. The beer itself is pitch black. When they say Double Chocolate they mean it. Smell is of milk chocolate. This is the sweet chocolate too, many times a chocolate beer has the bitter bakers chocolate smell and taste but this is very sweet. Some roasted dark malts peek though. Taste matches the smell but gets just the slightest knock in score for just being a little too sweet. Mouthfeel is velvety (according to my wife). I would have just said very smooth. All in all a very drinkable beer. It is certainly the most chocolately flavored beer I've ever had."
"D - It's an okay stout. I don't know if I would buy this one again."
"The fist time I drank this stout a couple of years ago I was kind of dissapointed. This time I was caught offguard and boy did this beer have it's revenge big time. Really nice taste, excellent aroma. One for cold winter nights."
"Pours rich and velvety out of the can, with a thick, cascading, choclatey head and a dark body that allows no light to pass through. Looks great. Smell is pure milk chocolate with a hint of coffee beans. The taste is only slightly disappointing. It is to be sure 'double chocolate'. In fact, it practically tastes like a chocolate milk shake. At first, it seems thick and satisfying. Definitely sweet. But somehow it weakens as it warms, and becomes more and more watery...somehow...? This is one that gives a great first impression, but loses character over time. Not the best chocolate stout in the world. Good mouthfeel, and relatively drinkable. Worth trying."
"D - I thought i could drink this forever at the beginning of the glass, but, by the end, i wanted to pour it out. it's the sweetness that makes this beer hard to finish. like cream soda, i'm always excited for the first few sips, but then i get sick of it. quick."
"Nitro can: This pours from the can with a Guinness type cascade. The beer is a dark brown with a good sized tan head. The aroma is nice. A bit of a chocolate sweetness comes to the top. Body is medium. Taste has a slight sweet chocolate note to it. Fairly silky texture. Nice."
"Overall Impression: Very well crafted stout, Chocolate sweetness. This beer is for sure worth a try. Great winter stout!"
"D- Gets tastier at a warmer temperature. Would drink a couple, but no more, would have only every so often due to the chocolate creaminess could prove to be sickly. A beer to savour!"
"Beer was extremely dark, with a thick, coffee colored head. Smell was vaguely reminiscent of chocolate, with a definite bitter aroma (though not at all unpleasant). Taste was very dark, slightly bitter, yet still with some sweetness to it. Perhaps my palate just isn't refined enough, but I didn't really notice much chocolate flavor. Slightly nutty with extremely vague hints of cocoa. Mouthfeel was very heavy, not syrup-like, but close. This might turn some people off, but I didn't mind it. It was certainly enjoyable, but I found it a little hard to drink. I wouldn't mind drinking it again, but it wouldn't necessarily be my first choice."
"The pour from the half liter bottle into my Fuller's nonic raises a two finger medium tan head, significantly darker than its nitro brothers. The head settles slowly, leaving impressive lacing as it does. The body is a virtually opaque brown-ruby. The nose is like smelling a milk chocolate bar with stout spilled on it. There's a hint of roastedness, and a good bit of sweetness. Perhaps just a bit of coffee, too. That lovely sensation comes through so well in the taste: creamy just like a cadbury bar. The chocolate fully dominates the flavor, with just a little bit of acidity. I feel that more flavor comes through than on nitro. The mouth manages to be quite smooth without the nitrogen, and has a very fine but noticeable acidity. A fine beverage, even better than nitro."
"Drinkability: goes down easily like a melting chocolate bar. While the alcohol is rather mild, I wouldn't drink many of these at any one time. Could get chocolate overload. Definitely a great dessert in itself. Chocolate residue remained on bottom of glass!"
"Overall, my wife and I really enjoyed this brew. The chocolate aroma is very intoxicating. We could not stop smelling this stuff. The flavor is right on cue with what you are smelling. You can have it with dessert but my wife and I had it with homemade tomato soup and a grilled turkey and cheese sandwich. It felt as if we were drinking a yoo-hoo. I know strange but what can I say. Pick one up and enjoy, it should not disappoint."
"D-MUST HAVE! This stuff is heaven and its a delight.Its great and really taste well,it taste so good my girl may like it.Thr 4 pack wont last long in my house! I highly like this stuff and recommend to anyone that loves stouts."
"Was served this out of a nitro-can into a pint glass. Dark, dark brown with brown, fluffy head. Looks like dessert. Smells like dessert. Tastes like dessert. A wonderful, creamy, yummy experience. Obviously lots of chocolate flavor and it tastes better than others I've had of the style. I want this one with some tiramasu or chocolate chip cookies."
"There must be something wrong. I love stouts and this was not up to par. I will drink more froma tap and get back to you all, but beware that there may be bad bottles of this floating around."
"This is the smoothest, most drinkable chocolate stout in memory. Flavor is gigantic, full of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Finishes surprisingly dry, which helps with finishing it. As with real chocolate, which was probably used in the manufacture, the vanilla brings out the fullness. Perfect carbonation and flavor make this one very drinkable. Had at the same time w/ a Brooklyn choco, and this one was hands down better."
"This is one of the best chocolate stouts, and one of the best stouts period. Not as overpowering as other chocolate stouts (like Brooklyn), and better for it. A great beer, especially in the wintertime."
"Drinkability: Not a beer I'd want to have more than one or two of at once, but definately something I can see myself craving again. Well worth having, and could find its way on to many stout-lovers' list of favorites."
"Not exactly the most intense or layered of stouts, but the pure sweet kick makes for one hell of a desert beer."
"one of my favorite chocolate stouts, from a nitro-can it pours a glorious cascading avalanche of velvety goodness. smell is strong of chocolate and roastiness. it also gets by without being too syrupy as many chocolate stouts can be. i could drink a ton of these and its also good to finish off a good night on. it leaves a pleasant after taste."
"Once it passed my lips I got the same feeling. It should be called chocolate beer. Smooth, light bodied with soft carbonation, this stuff is SOO drinkable it could be addictive. I want more!"
"Overall, I'm glad I picked it up. I'm enjoying this 1 bottle better than the whole 6 pack of macrobrew that I last reviewed..."
"I had not had this one in a while, and last time it was in a bottle. I'd say the bottle brings out more sweetness and chocolate than the can version. A very good sweet stout."
"Mmmm Chocolate. If you're looking for a chocolate beer I would recomend this as an appetizer to Rogue's chocolate stout."
"Pours a deep black with faint brown tinges at the edges when held up to a light. Big, spumescent cocoa head floats on top eventually dropping down to a thin, bubbly cap that holds up well. Smells like chocolate. Real chocolate. Sweet, rich, and creamy. Dark, malty flavor doesn't quite match the smell in richness, though its still good. Plenty of bittersweet chocolate. Silky mouthfeel but it isn't as heavy as I'd like it to be. Even so, this is a tasty and highly drinkable stout."
"(first BA review, hopefully this will suffice)"
"The drinkability is ok, one is enough. MK"
"I think that next time I will get this in a bottle. It seems that other reviewers feel that the bottled version is less thick and sugary. IMO those are the exact qualities that I feel are overdone in this brew."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle with a best by date on the back label. Was a solid black color with a thick, brownish head that stuck around for a long time. Also had pretty good lacing throughout. The smell was excellent and strong of bittersweet chocolate and chocolate malts. The taste was also excellent. Was chocolaty throughout and had just a little bitterness in the back. I would rate it higher if it had just a little more bite to offset the sweetness. Mouthfeel was good - just a little watery. Would rate higher if were a little more creamy. Overall, a great beer that I would never turn down and would definitely have in avail on tab. For home consumption, a good quarterly treat. Highly recommend and probably the best in category for me. (4.5, RR, T,Y)"
"Drinkability: This is tremendous. It's actually better with nitrogen than it is in the bottle. I still don't get it, but I'd rather drink it then ponder the mystery. Don't pass this up if you see it at a bar."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. It would make a good session stout."
"D - Not a huge fan of sweet stouts, but this is my favorite of the style. My girlfriend will drink a 4-pack of this in an evening and go looking for more."
"And don't worry about the expiration date on the can, I've had one's that were two years past that date and they were still excellent."
"D: Would definitely order a few more of these. This one seemed like it would start off decent enough, but really kicked in with the flavors and mouthfeel, which were quite delightful."
"Nasty undead nitro mouthfeel. Despite being something of a novelty brew, it's fine for matching with not too sweet chocolate desserts, which is the context in which I had it. I wouldn't want two in a sitting though."
"From the multicolored can to the mysterious sound of the nitro-capsule I was expecting the unexpected. I was not disappointed. A liquid dark chocolate poured into my glass. It's appearance, aroma, and taste fully reinforced this initial image. My fiance, who is not in any way a beer fan, insisted on trying this one after the smell drifted in her direction. Our mutual assesment of this brew is that double chocolate is no gimmick, but a straight up statement of what's in store. Very smooth and creamy, sweet with a heavy aftertaste this full bodied stout is one we'll enjoy again."
"Medium body, definitely lighter than you would expect, but that also increases its drinkability. I could easily have three or four of this delicious beer."
"I'd certainly order it again, but if I had a choice between this one and a Young's Oatmeal Stout, I'd go with the oatmeal (Alas, I think the oatmeal has been discontinued)."
"d - Like I said, easy as shit to drink. Really disappointed, I wanted to sweat trying to finish this."
"Drinkability is also good, but you may not want to go all night on it... unless your regular dessert is """Death by Chocolate""". Check it out."
"This is indeed a tasty brew, I think I'll have another!"
"Not bad, definitely drinkable and enjoyable. Coffee bean finish leaves this one a little dry at the end, but mouthfeel is mostly watery. Creamy foam head leaves me with a little bit of a much welcomed illusion."
"I found it very drinkable, other than the fact it left me feeling bloated and full. I found myself wanting another one the next day. I don't think its the perfect beer but I really, really enjoyed it. I couldn't believe that two great things could be mated together so well."
"I may prefer the bottled version a bit more simply because of the mouthfeel difference. Still is a very nice beer."
"Poured from the bottle to an opaque jet-black with thick tan head that lingered for most of the glass, then left good lacing on the glass. Excellent aroma of walking into a candy shop with the sweet smell of fresh chocolate and caramel in the air. Taste was more muted than the aroma, but still very much sweet chocolate. Finish was a little watery, but overall, a stout beer well worth drinking."
"Poured in the light, this looks like dark coffee or root beer cascading into the glass. Once there, it seems pitch black and has a substantial foamy head that is a gradient from nearly brown near the beer fading to a tan near the top. The head retains well and leaves droopy lacing that eventually settles back down into the beer save a few islands along the edge of the glass. The smell is of chocolate and deep malts from well roasted barley. There is anise and plum and herbs and rooty confectioners chocolate all up in my grill when Im smelling this. There is just so much in the nose here. The taste is so balanced and fantastic, I dont know where to begin. It rich and creamy and properly carbonated with chocolate very pervasively, but not overly strongly exploding across the palate. There are deep rooty essences and a non-descript fine bitterness throughout, nothing floral. It tastes like powdery chocolate, but totally no artificial. And I want to gulp this beer; dangerously so. This is a superb after dinner beer. The mouthfeel is creamy and crisp, soft and dark, but very present. This is an exceptionally drinkable beer; exceptional all around."
"D: This is a very drinkable stout. One of my favorites."
"If you've ever walked in to a real chocolatier's shop, this brew offers the same olfactory experience. In the glass, it looks like strong coffee with a creamy two-finger head -- quickly subsiding. The flavor is. . . wow! It's like I've raided the fridge and started eating chocolate sauce by the spoonful. Absolutely delicious. The finish is something I could get used to. . . chocolate coffee with a slight hint of bitterness. But it's fairly clean, considering the style."
"Pours a black thick beer with a fluffy white head. Smells of chocolate and malt. Tastes basically the same. Not nearly as rich as I was expecting it be. Tastes more or less like a slightly alcoholic chocolate malt shake. This isnt my favorite. Could only drink one of these and would prefer to split the bottle with someone. Think it would go really well with some vanilla ice cream though."
"Pours dark with a creamy head. Smell was very appealing with hints of the chocolate. Was very smooth and the chocolate taste came through very nicely and finished well. A very easy beer to relax with and drink  its worth a try if you haven't already."
"Pours a dense opaque black with a frothy head. Chocolate malty smell that carries over in the taste. Smooth and drinkable, with a mocha finish brought out with the bite of bittersweet chocolate. This one is a winner and one that is good to relax with anytime."
"Young's Double Chocolate Stout is most definitely a comfort beer for me. Upon opening the can and pouring it out I can already sense my body relaxing and am anticipating its smooth texture and sweet taste. I know it's been stated many times before but it has the appearance of Guinness Draught. The aroma is similiar to a malted chocolate milkshake (of course). Upon initial tasting, you palate is overwhelmed by the silky texture and chocolate taste. It really does remind me of a milkshake. As it warms in the glass, the chocolate fades and the bitterness comes out more. The smooth mouthfeel changes to a more traditional average to thick viscosity of a stout. The aftertaste leaves a mild roasitness behind mixed with faint semisweet chocolate. After a glass of this, there is no need or want of another. This is great for a dessert beer!"
"Drinkability? I sipped (and I stress the word """sipped""" because this is a beer that you'll certainly want to take your time drinking) and finished two in a little over an hour. You'll want to pace yourself on this particular beer, savor the chocolate and mocha aromas and flavors, and let your palate have a little bit of fun."
"A must have beer if you enjoy stout type beers... Drink and enjoy."
"D: I've never had more than one chocolate stout at a time, and so I don't know if I would get sick of a beer if I overdid it. I wouldn't mind trying with this one, though."
"Overall, holy shit, somebody threw some vanilla ice cream in my beer and it tastes like a chocolate milkshake beer float and I think I like it. Then somebody almost ruined it all by throwing too much water in there and the boldness of the taste went away. Still perfectly tasty though."
"Looked pretty good with nice dark clear color and a creamy head. Smell was definite chocolate with coffee as well. Semi-sweet taste with definite chocolate overtones but this one had a slight musty taste that was hard to place. Not much in the way of hoppiness. Goes down real smooth, very drinkable."
"Im certainly not a chocoholic, but this beer certainly cracks the top 5 beers Ive had. Its combination of a bitter stout and sweet chocolate is certainly worth trying."
"I am ranking this a bit lower than usual because it was bottled... and like I said, I prefer the nitro, but still tasty. But not a beer I like to drink all the time."
"Just tried this with some chocolate ice cream. Just ridiculous. Just...damn."
"This was on nitro-tap... amazing. Served with about a finger of thick creamy nitro induced vanilla head on top of a very dark stoutlike body. It smelled of chocolate, and coffee and tasted the same. It was like drinking the best guinness in the world, and chocolate at the same time. I found it quite drinkable, and could easily session this."
"I could drink a few of these at a time. Very nice indeed."
"Drinkability: I rate this pretty high and like to grab a few whenever i can!"
"Drinkability: Went down easy but it is kind of filling, I doubt anyone would really want to session this but it is nice to have one for a treat. I'd take this over a typical dessert any day."
"definietly recommend with an interesting mix of hot chocolate feel to it, but the beer is cool and drinkable."
"As I had it straight from the bottle, I can't report on it's appearance, but the nose and flavor were quite good. It's first and foremost a very solid stout with a nice roasted malt character, hints of chocolate in the nose and more in the aftertaste. Exhale through your nose after taking a drink and you'll really get the full effect. Overall it's a well balanced brew and the chocolate notes are a nice touch without being overpowering."
"Very dark, nearly black with a dense, light tan head. Chunky lacing and good head retention. Super chocolatey aroma - dark chocolate, a little milk sweetness, just like cutting blocks of chocolate when baking. There's a hint of roasted malt too, but it's quite subdued compared to the caramel maltiness. The flavour has a lot more malt in it, some caramel, that complements the chocolate. On the bittersweet side more than milk chocolate. Fairly quick finish with a bit of cocoa. On the creamy side, medium bodied with slightly lower than average carbonation. Also a bit dry. This is tasty stuff. The chocolate is right up front, but it still tastes balanced and not at all like this is just a dessert beer."
"*Note: I paired this with Ghirardelli """Espresso Escape""" premium dark chocolates made with 60% pure cacao and finely ground espresso beans. I reviewed the beer as accurately as possible omitting characterisics of the chocolate. I consumed most of the chocolate after the review."
"Tried this gem last night for the first time and I must say it was an extremly pleasant surprise. Nice aroma of dark chocolate. Nice creamy sustained head. A very smooth stout beer. Not too sweet or not too bitter. Pleasant after taste. The aroma and flaver improve after warming in the glass. This is a highly drinkable stout and has moved to the top of my list as one of my favorites. Highly reccommended."
"Get my buzz on- y"
"Very, very nicely done. A great twist on the style. It's a sweet stout to begin with, so why not add something that most people think of when they think of """sweet", like chocolate? Truly worth seeking out."
"Overall, it's a wonderful dessert drink. It's nice in a can, especially the appearance. But, I personally think that it is a bit richer/fuller in the bottle."
"I could drink one of these every night after dinner for dessert, but wouldnt want to session it."
"Very pleasant aftertaste, sweet. Suprisingly smooth, not bitter, and very drinkable. Your perfect celebration beer. Will try this again within the best before date."
"D- very easy drinking, goes down tasty and very smooth"
"Black, completely opaque body with rather thick light tan head. Smells malty, caramelly, and chocolatey. Tastes malty and chocolatey. Very very good. Glad I bought two bottles, and Ill definitely be buying more. Im very impressesd. All the hype was not for nothing. One of my favorites."
"You wont need dessert if you drink one of these. And I don't need more than one because they are 20 ounce bottles, and it is rather expensive."
"Notes: I like this sample from the nitro can about a million times better than the bottled one I tried a few months back. I hope to find this on tap soon."
"D: Delicious with dessert or by itself. Probably not a beer you'd have more than one of at a sitting, but with a low abv (and great taste) you could if you wanted to. A very agreeable, palate-pleasing stout."
"Drinkability: Everyone else seemed to like it more than I did, but definitely not bad."
"This is among my favorite beers. Very rich, dark color, with a positively delightful cocoa aroma. The beer is smooth, almost velvety, and rich with chocolate, cocoa, and hints of coffee with cream. An important high point in this brew is that its very rich without being overly sweet, making it a bit more drinkable than many other rich beers. Still, it is very rich and very filling....I couldn't see myself enjoying more than two of these before switching to something else, which is the only reason I rated the drinkability below the 4.0 mark. This is simply an exceptional beer, and one of the brews I most frequently recommend to people who claim to not like beer (when they've only really tried bud light and miller) or to not like dark beer."
"A very dense, dark pour with a very thick (3 finger) tan head that shrinks a little but does not disappear. You will notice a wonderful, sweet smell of malty chocolate and coffee. The same sweet chocolate and coffee are tasted, but they are perfectly balanced by bitterness to avoid making this overly sweet. The aftertase is of more chocolate and coffee. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with light carbonation and goes down very smoothly. This is a very drinkable beer, and one of the most drinkable stouts that I have tasted. A delicious treat for dessert or any other time you want to enjoy a great beer."
"D - The mouthfeel really helps the drinkability. A very good beer."
"Someone brought this one from Texas for me since it is not available in Louisiana yet. I was very excited at trying it, and I was not disappointed. It poured very dark with a nice tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate almost jumping out of the glass. Very agreeable. Just enough carbonation to fizzle in your mouth. Plenty of chocolate there too!! But I must say, not as thick as I thought it would be. Definitely a dessert in itself! If you're both a chocoholic and a beerholic, this one's for you."
"After drinking this lone bottle, I longed for another. This beer will definitly find its way into my normal beer rotation."
"Hersheys chocolate to the point. Squeeze some hershey's on a batch of vanilla Ice Cream and you have Young's double chocolate. That being the very rudimentary version it is more comples than that."
"a bit too much in summer, and it only makes you think you are putting on 20 pounds per glass."
"Poured this beer out into a pint glass, beer was a very dark chocolate brown color, with a very nice head on top. The head stuck around for several minutes, eventually leaving a small creamy froth on top. The smell was definitely of chocolate malt. Sweet and pleasant like a candy bar. The taste was also nice, although not as strong as I had expected. The mouthfeel is very creamy; the beer has a healthy body and a smooth finish. Overall, this beer is definitely drinkable and I would recommend it."
"The mouthfeel is excellent, as this drinks like a draft beer. Nice, thick, full-bodied and creamy."
"D: Watching the head form on this is definiatly it's strongest point . Taste-wise it was a decent stout, but I really can't stand how flat and watery it was. If it had at least some carbonation, and maybe a fuller body I would like it a lot more."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch creamy tan head that stays around for a while. It smells like sweet milk chocolate, and also some roasted malt and nuts. It tastes like both bitter and milk chocolate, with a little bit of coffee taste too. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, it finishes great. I have to say this is one of my favorite beers. It's great on-tap, and it's great out of the nitro-can as well. Not quite as good out of the bottle, but this review is for the nitro-can. It is more of a dessert beer, but I can drink this all the time. An excellent beer!"
"The taste is fairly light, and could in fact use a bit more creamy, mouth coating heft to it. Lightly sweet, with a chocolate note up front that quickly moves to a light-roast black coffee note. Some lightly spicy bitterness is here, but most of the bitterness seems to be contributed from roasted malt. The finish has a burnt grain acidity to it as well as a lightly burnt bitterness. Chocolate flavors are definitely noticeable and even linger long into the finish, but seem to not be at the depth that my memory of this beer remembers. Really a touch more body would help to round things out immensely."
"Overall, a good chocolate stout, but I really think it is better on tap, the can is ok though."
"From the nitro can, pours an opaque pitch brown. I never get tired of watching the head form on a nitro stout. Beautiful! 1-1/2 fingers of tan nitro head with tiny bubbles. The head fades slowly down to about ½ finger and sticks around until the very last sip. Good lacing. Damn fine looking beer. Nose is of chocolate, sort of half dark and half cocoa powder like Nesquik. Theres some malt there as well. Taste is a lot more mellow than I expected, milk chocolate flavor with mild coffee. Mild malt dominates. Overall the flavor is mild and not bitter. Finishes on a nice slightly bitter coffee finish. Mouth is very good: fully, creamy, and fluid. Drinkability is very good. This is a great mild, creamy, and enjoyable chocolate stout. Highly recommended."
"Pours a nice dark cola black appearance with a nice fluffy carmel head that stays the entire drink with strong sticky fat lacing. Taste is of strong coffee with hints of chocolate espresso with a nice carmel touch, also tasted hints of vannilla and malted roasted almonds. The sweet melted choclate marshmellows with a coffee back drop. This is highly recommended and one of Young and Companys finest."
"Im not certain what benefits the nitro packaging produces on this beer. The nitro packaging seems to effect the same results as with the other similarly packaged beers Ive experienced."
"Drinking this out of an imperial pint glass. A nice chocolate-milkshake colored head formed with the pour and fell to a thin film on top of the brew. Color is that of the darkest chocolate bar and opaque when held to the light. The aroma is well presented, and dominated by the sweet unfermented sugars left in the brew. Chocolate is very present as the name suggests, but there is a creaminess and roastiness also present. The taste is very fit to the style, sweet. Nice and creamy, possibly due to lactose used in fermentation. Flavor is dominated by the creamy flavor, followed by a hit of chocolate malt, and comes together beautifully with a bit of roasted malty bitterness. mouthfeel is thick, almost like whole milk, leaving a film inside your mouth. Drinkability is mixed for me. I would definitely buy this beer again, but it is not a session beer. I don't think I could drink more than a pint of these in one sitting, but this is not a bad thing. I definitely suggest giving this beer a try. If you've had it and want another beer like it, try Bell's Special Double Cream Stout. It is very similar in many ways."
"I love this beer. Have since I tasted it. Will always have a spot in my fridge."
"Eric"
"Poured from the nitro can into a clear glass, this beer is a deep brown color, completely opaque. It has a creamy tan head that lingers indefinitely. It smells malty, nutty, choclatey (as it should)! It tastes like a sweet chocolate milk, at first and then ends with a bittersweet chocolate bite. It is like biting into one of those dark chocolate bars that is 80% (or more) pure dark cocoa. Makes sense, since that's what this beer is made from! The feel of this beer is smooth and creamy - meant to be sipped. It leaves a nice aftertaste of chocolate after it goes down. It makes a nice after-dinner, desert-like treat. Delicious!"
"Mouthfeel was rich, creamy and medium to medium-light bodied for a stout."
"Good beer, not great. I was expecting a little more chocolate flavor as this beer is brewed with real dark chocolate, but was left wanting. A good sweet stout, but not something that I would seek out again. For chocolate stouts I'll stick with Rogue."
"Overall it tastes exactly like an A&W Cream Soda. I thought this was beer? Sickingly sweet."
"Adam"
"A nice treat but, not a beer you can have a lot of at one sitting."
"D: I would order this over and over. Makes for a great after dinner beer."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability: I could drink this with my morning cereal."
"Pours a jet black with a slight tan head. Smells strongly of chocolate (I bet you were suprised by that) sweet tones and notes, a hint of burnt runs through. The taste has a great very subtle bitter to match the chocolate sweet, great balance. The flavor is wonderful, not overpowering but great to keep sipping and wonder where it all went. A medium to full body with a good balance in carbonation to fully round out this great beer. This beer has something for everyone and I recommend it to all. A wonderful brew!"
"This brew pours heavy and dark with strong a bittersweet chocolate flavor. It is has an ultra smooth flavor and is very drinkable. Considerate Young's Double Chocolate Stout as a dessert beverage. Hats off to the brew master for creating this black anomaly. This is another beer for those who are, afraid of the dark."
"An nice, thick and smooth stout. Drinkable if you're a fan of stouts or chocolate."
"Imagine yourself licking through a block of ice for some burnt choco pudding on the other side of the frozen wall and actually liking it. Then imagine that you do this in repetitions until it's been expired and you are left with a chocolate fog on the roof of your mouth. Maybe my beer mug was too cold but this wonderful cocoa flavoring seemed to be teased in after some delayed anasceptic numbness. Not bad but I wished that I had the whole flavor at once."
"Very easy to drink this beer, but you probably wont want more than a couple."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Note: this is my wife's favorite beer on draft."
"All of that is much more muted and almost diluted when tasted in the bottle, so don't pass up the chance to have a fountain pour if you can."
"d - very drinkable, I could sip on this all night"
"Overall, an excellent stout. One that is widely available. Check your local stores and grab some of these, you won't regret it."
"Drinkability: Love it. A great stout."
"It seems like you can get it just about anywhere, but I had this one at the Mercury Lounge, a beerbar in Goleta, California."
"Admittedly, a can is probably not the best means of delivery for this beer, which I initially tried from a tap, yet the experience was not significantly diminished. I found a four-pack of Young's at Trader Joe's in 14.9 oz cans, each stamped at the bottom with a freshness date of February, 2007. In short, I have great affection for this beer. The pour is exceptionally creamy with a brown mocha color. After it sat a bit the thin rich head separated from the dense black below. Strong scent of porter and chocolate. The chocolate taste is very present, followed by a pleasant stout bitterness that effectively leaves the mouth feeling somehow cleansed and ready for another sip, althouth the former did seem to diminish as the beer cooled. The creamy, silky mouthfeel and the flavor makes it perfect to drink with a chocolate dessert. In all, a unique experience in beer."
"I've been wowed by this on draft a few years back...either my memory is going or this nitro-can doesn't hold a candle to the brew on tap."
"I guess I'm glad I got this, but it wasn't what I was hoping for. Overpriced, I think."
"Pours pitch black with a 1 1/2 finger mocha colored head. Smell is of sweet chocolate and dark malts. Mouthfeel would be better if it had a bit less carbonation but overall pretty good. Taste is dark roasted malts with a small touch of chocolate. Chocolate is not as prevalant in the taste as it is in the smell. Overall a good stout even though I was let down a bit by the lack of chocolate in the taste."
"A nice dessert-y stout that actually isn't too heavy to session or enjoy with a meal."
"D: Very pleasant chocolate. A very situational beer. I gave it high drinkability because in that situation, be it after dinner or as a snack, this is fantastic. At the end of the meal how many do you want to put a way? It's a desert, it's a great desert. But you can't have chocolate all of the time. I dunno, maybe you can. I suggest complimenting this beer with cookies or cake."
"i have to rate this NITRO CAN version of this amazing stout as substantially lower than the bottled version. this nitro can just did not deliver the amazing pure chocolate decadence that the bottle so fully conveys. i dont know. i just know that the bottle is an absolute let down compared to the bottle. now, i am FULLY AWARE that the nitro can produces a better head. absolutely true - the head on this can's pour lasted pretty much the entire glass full and tastes terrific. but, all in all, the bottle version has a MUCH BETTER flavor through and through. i mean it. start with the bottled one. have one and realize the greatness. if you the have a nitro can you will see the difference clearly. the can pretty much delivers a DULLER version of the same great beer."
"This beer retained a slight amount of foam head at the top for quite some time and it is incredibly complex and choclatey and stout and bitter and sweet and awesome. I highly suggest it. If you don't try it yourself, you don't know what you are missing. GO TRY IT!"
"Beer poured black as night with a great tan head leaving generous lacing. Nose was of sweet chocolate malts. Taste was malty with a very sweet finish. Mouthfeel was smooth but kind of thin for the style. Drinkability was sessionable at 5.2 abv. An enjoyable beer that one has to try."
"Overall. I was hoping this would be one of those, """oh my god, i love this beer!""" beer, but it's not. However it is still a very enjoyable beer. I like it in the bottle rather than in the nitrocan"
"Drinkability: This is a really flavorful but not aggressive brew, sweet but not sugary, and light enough to work into the middle of a session. Pair with brownies!"
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, although the flavor is not as interesting as the bottled version"
"Pours a rich, very dark but clear burgundy under a one finger dark tan head that settles fairly quickly to thick film, then lingers forever. Not much in the lace department, though. The nose is strong of rich milk chocolate, with a touch of coffee behind. The mouth is thick and luxurious, with moderate carbonation. The taste is sublime: the chocolate is readily noticeable right up front, but is nicely balanced by espresso and a touch of caramel. I had expected more roastiness, but I'll settle for bathing in the sweet and the bitter that make this brew so enjoyable. The chocolate wins out in the aftertaste, although even here there is enough of the coffee to keep you thirsty. Very nicely balanced, wonderfully tasty brew."
"Young's Double Chocolate Stout pours almost jet black with a tan head from a 14.9 ounce nitro can. I've had the bottled version before, but this is my first try of the nitro version. It smells good, particularly for a nitro beer. Chocolate malt is apparent in the nose. Taste is interesting in that it is different than the bottle in my opinion, chocolate and coffee notes still dominate, but yet this seems like a different beast than the bottle. Mouthfeel is typically nitro smooth. Highly recommended. I'd like to try the bottle and the nitro can back to back."
"Beautiful nitro thick creamy tan head over a black body. Has a lovely way of settling to a creamy solid chunk that won't spill out of the glass if you tilt it. Smell is generic mild hop and roasted malt. First sip is almost all head. Similar to Guinness cans in that respect. Actual beer isn't that impressive - seems a bit flat, even compared to Guinness nitro. Flavors are all very subdued. The chocolate is very subtle in the aftertaste, hop bitterness is pretty low, and there's not a lot of malt flavor. Watery consistency overall due to the lack of bitterness, dryness or sweetness. I'd call this an interesting alternative to Guinness if you can find the cans, but not a very interesting beer. I imagine the bottled version has much better in the aroma & mouthfeel and possibly flavor as well."
"super smooth; i can' tell the difference between the head and the beer below it. reminds me of when i used to eat swiss miss out of the packet, plus a slight roasted character. excelleny after dinnner beer"
"Those nitro cans are just great. The perfect creamy head topped this beautiful stout. A nice strong chocolate scent on the nose. The roasted malt is very evident. Coffee, chocolate, and a hint of alcohol on the palate. Clean finish with a touch of hopiness. Very drinkable. I was a bit worried that this would be too rich for the middle of the day. However, I could easily down a couple of these at any time. It's good to branch out and try something other than Guiness, Murphy's or Beamish."
"Quite a good beer and solid all the way around. A favorite beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"Pretty big in body, smooth mouthfeel with the alcohol burried by the rich flavor of this tasty brew. While being easy to drink, I'd recommend this as an after dinner dessert beer, as in one or two would be fine."
"You know this beer is good if it can get my homeboy Lee laid."
"It was a little dry in the mouth and rated fairly well in the drinkability category."
"The poor mouthfeel and dull taste detracted from the beer's drinkability."
"Drinkability: Fine flavor, goes down easy, but not quite as complex as I would have liked. A greater diversity of flavor would have me running back for more."
"Do I want to drink a lot of these? Wouldn't turn my nose, but there are others of this ilk that I like more."
"I was excited when I poured Young's Double Chocolate; it is a very dark, very thick beer that almost looked like oil. The aroma was incredible and I was fully expecting a thick, creamy chocolate beer...Maybe it was just my usual expectation for something that's chocolate, but there is a definite bitterness to the beer that turned me off. I cringed a bit every swallow, and to me, that's not what I'm looking for in a beer. I think if Young's made this beer a bit milder, it would become an excellent beer."
"The bottled Young's is ok. The nitro-can is better. But if you try this beer on the proper nitro-tap setup at the right temperature...wow. Much like the mainline dry Irish stouts it has a tremendous """floor show""" in the glass. Cascading creaminess. It had a extremely rich and thick head that added that finishing touch to the beer. The beer itself looked almost like blackstrap molasses in color. Wonderful undertones of chocolate malt. I got a hint of coffee on the nose. This beer goes down like a chocolate malt. Yummy for my tummy."
"Minimal carbonation save a bit of zip, a very slight tartness from the alcohol, but very smooth, very cool-feeling in the mouth even at an appropriate temp - it tempts me to drink deeply. It can be appreciated just as easily in deep gulps as in lazy sips."
" stouts."
"Cheers!"
"Very drinkable goes down easy and is very tasty."
"D - If it wasn't so sweet, you could drink them all night."
"Meh, not really what I had expected. I personally wouldn't buy another bottle, but if the chance to try it on-tap arose, I probably would take it."
"Being honest, I poured it out. There are more interesting things here to taste than a sour stout which is no inspiration."
"D: This is a good beer, but probably not one that I would make an effort to find. I've had this once mixed with a raspberry ale in the black and tan style, and it made a very good chocolate raspberry beer."
"Poured a dark black with a half inch dark brown head that recedes but does not disappear until the beer is gone! It was full of a sweet chocolate aroma with the hint of bananas in there as well, very interesting. A very chocolaty taste that gives way to bitter malt after a little while in your mouth. After you swallow this bitterness is much more pronounced but not overbearing. This is a very smooth drink that would compliment a good chocolate desert after a hearty meal, or perhaps it could be the desert. I'll be looking to try this one again on tap. Give this one a try, enjoy!"
"All in all a great beer."
"Bottom line...I really enjoyed this beer. It would make a great desert on its own but begs to accompany some fresh berries."
"Taste is a lovely smooth blend of fine aromatic dark chocolate with some milky elements too as it should be for this style. A real fine example of the milk/sweet stout. It holds up well for a longtime too. Mouthfeel is quite pleasant. A fine beer---definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: Oh, man, I wish I had had another 20 minutes to wait for a second to be poured...I could have drank them all night."
"The mouthfeel is rich and tingly all over the tongue. It's got a nice roasted malt and chocolate aftertaste, and not at all sour as some stouts turn out. This is a rich, filling and creamy brew. Second to Rogue's Chocolate Stout this is the best I've had, but being as Young's is cheaper, I may just be drinking more of this...."
"Opaque black color with a small, fizzy tan head with good retention. Maybe it was just the bottle I got, but I could barely pick up an aroma off this beer. Very faint roasted malts. After being unsatisfied with the aroma, the taste came and saved the day, bringing the malts to the foreground. The flavor of chocolate and roasted barley malts coat the inside of your mouth and it all ends with a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Drinkable for a stout, but not my favorite so far. I would like to try it out of a nitro can, however, as I can see it's potential for being a different beast out of the can."
"If dark is your pleasure, than pleasured you will be. Unfortunately, as in most imports (especially from the UK), the bottle drank in the US, as opposed to one poured in downtown London, loses something in the translation, but is still well worth the price of admission...enjoy."
"Super drinkable. Great as session brew or with a bowl of spicy food or some dark choclate, highly recomended"
"Pours a deep dark opaque black with a very luxurious looking thick, creamy tan head. Roasted maltiness in aroma with strong hints of chocolate as well. Tastes the same, except this time the roastiness takes a back seat to the chocolaty flavours. Extremely smooth and creamy. Drinkable? Thats quite an understatement. I can't get enough of this stuff and I've already had four cans. Good thing I bought two 4-pint can packs. Damned tasty brew!"
"Thanks to the nitro widget, this pours into my glass a velvety milk chocolate brown of cascading bubbles, after a few moments of settling, this becomes an opaque black with a very thick creamy light tan head. Some subtle toasty chocolate notes are present in the aroma, but not much else, no hops to speak of. Sweet milk chocolate flavor, mocha latte, smooth bittering with no hop flavors, sweet finish. Nice creamy mouthfeel, very smooth nitro-carbonation, medium bodied and leaves a light coat on the palate. I remember days where I would be excited to find this on tap at a local pub, its definitely lost the excitement factor as my palate has matured, however this is a nice throwback to the guinness days."
"Poured pitch black with a healthy, khaki-colored head. Smells of black malt and dark chocolate. Nothing too exciting. I'm not going to wax poetic about this beer: tastes like a tasty milk stout with chocolate added. with a finish of some noble hops Good enough for me. Mouthfeel is fairly silky, but with a combination so decadent as beer and chocolate, I hoped for a richer, chewier beer. One of these is good for a nightcap, but it's a bit filling to reach for another."
"Served in a 14.9oz nitro can. Pours a dark brown color with a dense creamy off-white head. Has chocolate aromas. Taste is smooth and well rounded with hints of coffee, chocolate, sweet tones and with a slight hint of alcohol. Light in the mouth. Goes down good."
"Drinkability: excellent, it is rich, but I could definitely drink a few of these."
"Excellent beer for the style. Huge dark, tan head on this one. Very heavy lace that followed. Only thing that really threw me off on this was the nose. Usually I get a ton of chocolate aroma, but on this one I didnt really pull anything. The chocolate flavor is good and well balanced. I get more of a dark chocolate flavor, rather than the normal light brown."
"D - If bitterness is what you are looking for this is it."
"I liked this a lot, but I don't think I could drink a lot of these in a row. It would be an excellent choice with dessert."
"D - I decided to try this one after having Young's Oatmeal Stout. As mentioned earlier I'm not a big fan of stouts but after these two, I'm starting to have a change of heart. I guess I can thank Young & Co's Brewery for the eye opener! I would definitely buy this again."
"Just for kicks I poured some over vanilla ice cream and the flavors complimented each other nicely."
"Pours opaque black, with ruby highlights. The magic of nitrogeneration creates a super creamy, pale tan head that holds a half inch to the finish; lacing will coat the glass. Malto dextrin, roasted barely, and chocolate malt are strong in the nose, with a faint molasses aromas in the background. Sweet dextrin and a huge roasted flavor upfront, followed by a soft wave of unsweetened bakers chocolate. The aftertaste is a touch dry, with some creamy dextrins holding on, but lots of roasted bitterness that creates a good balance without any need for hops. The carbonation is flat, the body like whole milk, and the mouthfeel is very...very creamy. Some residual chocolate and dextrin sweetness is matched by roasted notes in the finish, but the drinkability still reaches session caliber."
"Pretty drinkable....but I probably would not want this with food."
"This classic brew pours deep and dark -- almost black -- with a dark tan head. The heady aroma is composed mostly of chocolate and espresso, with no hop aroma. Not a lot of complexity there, but what is there is most delectable. The flavors get a little more complex. There's bitter chocolate, expectedly, and a ton of sweetness in the malt. This beer really sets up on the front of your tongue and stays there. Although there's not hop bitterness too offset the sweet flavors, there's plenty of malt bitterness that does the job perfectly. Overall, a smooth, tasty beer. Not for everyday consumption, but definitely a nice treat now and then."
"Notes: An old standby by that I often pick up when I go to the store. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Guinness fan. They will never go back."
" This is way drinkable. I must admit that allowing it to warm was a bit of a challenge. I will buy this again and recommend to others."
"Pours dark black, with a thin, dark tan head that quickly turns to film. The smell is mild. It is sweet with chocolate and coffee notes. The taste starts out like marshamallows, kind of dry, and then more coffee and chocolate flavor comes through. Slightly toasty. The mouthfeels is semi-thick, very smooth, with nice carbonation. Nothing exceptional about this brew, but it is so well-rounded that it is highly drinkable and recommended."
"This beer was a little more carbonated than I would have liked and I found it sitting quite heavily by the end. A nice beer, but a niche beer. If I wanted to sit around a quaff a few pints of stout, I'd have a hard time topping good ol' Guinness."
"This beer poured an opaque black with a one-finger thick head. I could not detect any significant aroma. the taste was very delicate smooth and bittersweet, light overtones of chocolate. It was a pleasant stout but somewhat dissapointing in its depth of flavor. I found it remarkably similar to Guinness though with a more chocolaty overall flavor."
"Dark dark dark, opaque, even. Rich looking with a pretty head. Smells chocolatey and espresso-like with a hint of toastedness. A little lacking in my opinion. Taste is kind of watered down chocolate coffee with a shot of espresso. It's... okay. Tasty but not nearly as good as I'd hoped it would be. Mouthfeel is on the creamy side but too thin. A nice dessert beer, but... there are better ones out there."
"Bitter dark chocolate flavor. Quite smooth. Just a hint of black coffee... like a mocha espresso loaded with chocolate liquor. Aftertaste of a lighter chocolate... like coco. I am liking the balance of smooth, subtle sweetness of the chocolate malts and the harsh bitterness of the dark chocolate."
"The mouthfeel was quite light and chewey. Overall, this was a nice brew that I could drink in moderation, not something I could sit around and drink all evening. Nice with chocolate or fruit dessert."
"Watery at times, could use a little more character in the aroma and taste."
"taste: bitter, dry, pure chocolate, blackberries and cherries. Not a lot of carbonation. I was surprised to find the taste of pure chocolate, but the taste did not blow me away. The expectation I had from this beer were higher."
"This is the first chocolate stout I have tried. It is a wonderful brew!"
"The beer poured dark brown to black with a light brown head. The aroma is of dark bitter chocolate. The taste is quite amazingly chocolate, very much like a bitter chocolate drink, it also has a strong bitter chocolate aftertaste. The feel is heavy, smooth, and dry. This is quite an amazing beer, and I enjoyed it. However, this is one of those occaisional brews as the taste is something you have to be in the mood for."
"Young's Double Chocolate Stout is an excellent beer and one of my favorite stouts, but I have to give 1st place to Rogue. Using real chocolate is the key that gives it the edge, I believe."
"Poured from the tap, the rich dark head formed and then slowly settled. The head is extraordinarily thick and creamy in appearance, texture, and taste. I had to push through the head to get to the black richness beneath and found the familiar roasted goodness. At 5.2%, it is rather easy to drink. One would expect a heavier beer, given the color, but this is one great sessioner. The aroma was exceptionally clean and slightly toasty. This beer is simple and very good, much richer in flavor than other stouts. And the chocolate tastes are just out of this world. I could have easily had several of these at one sitting, despite the thickness and meal-like qualities. Overall, a very good beer."
"I think I'm going to give this a second shot sometime soon, and go a little easier on the chill!"
"It's drinkable, but there are better sweet stouts out there. This was fantastic on tap about a month ago, but I guess the bottles just don't hold up as well."
"Drinkability: Quite easy drinking, the smooth chocolate flavor makes it go down real easy."
"Kind of thin mouthfeel, but carbonation is pretty nice and this makes it fairly drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"D - Quite good. I enjoy this beer. Not the best that I have had, but good none the less."
"Opinion: I really like this beer. I especially like to drink it on tap mixed with a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale like a """Black and Tan""". This beer by itself is a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but still a very nice beer that I am glad to have around."
"from the bottle.poured a dark brown to black with a tan head that left a little lacing .aroma, roated malts, chocolate, molasses, some hops, sweet. flavor, medium dark to dark chocolate, malt, hops. I have got to say I was a little disappointed in the flavor on this beer, compared to the aroma it was a pour showing, the chocolate tasted likecheap chocolate."
"drinkability: it's good for a stout. I've never been the guy to really want to session a stout, although this is coming close. Suprised there haven't been more takes on this style here in the states."
"Great beer with a meal or as a meal."
"Appearance id a super dark black which is not translucent in the least bit. My pour gave me a little creamy head which didn't diminish at all as I sipped this for a good thirty minutes.The head may have something to do with this beer was drank 7+ months past its best before date. Smells of roasted barley and a little chocolate are easily detectable. Mouthfeel is creamy and light with no carbonation at all. I've drank this one many times in the past in both bottle and nitro can and must say I enjoy the bottle greatly for some reason. This is also a beer I've used as a gateway to introduce some BMC drinking friends. Now, if I could only find a bottle before its best before date."
"Pours a great head and holds a good lacing. Has a dark crisp look to it. Sweet smell with dark roasted barely malts. Taste's good and strong with definate coffee flavors accompanied by chocolate undertones. Mouthfeel is lacking a bit, but still ok. It fills you up quick, so another beer would be a task. Sipping this beer is good idea."
"Poured the expected color from the style, all but jet black with a creamy tan head which receded after a short time leaving a light trim ring and minimal lacing. Nose was straightforward and somewhat uninteresting with basic roasted malt notes. Taste is a deluge of roasted malt flavors, like a mix of gas station coffee with hershey's syrup more than a mocha. For some reason this beer is just not treating me quite right, being a lover of good stouts I simply expected more I suspect. I think I'll be looking elsewhere to get my chocolate stout fix....rogue chocolate stout here I come!"
"D: Truly exceptional. I think I could drink this all night!"
"robust coffee/chocolate taste. they could make a nice starbucks drink out of this. finishes with a rich bitterness. clean and smooth throughout. not as sweet as something like the mackeson XXX stout, but still sweet enough that i wouldnt want to make it a session beer like a dry stout. relatively light on the tongue and smooth, even from the bottle."
"Feel: Feels OK in the mouth, but not remarkable. Not a great session beer. Like a Hersheys chocolate bar, I can only take one or two. But for sheer taste it is very good!"
"Finally without nitrogen and finally understood, this is a great session stout. I don't know what I was expecting, I think the nitrogen is a major minus for my funny palate."
"For once the writing on the bottle does not lie- this beer is a silky luxury."
"This is my second Youngs beer and I like it a lot. This is a great stout which is very rich and creamy and would go great by itself or with dessert."
"Good drinkability, but like most dessert beers, I'd probably be fine with just one. Plus I don't see the taste reward for the volume I'd be drinking!"
"Flavor is sweet, roasted malt, chocolate and a sharp lactic acid aftertaste."
"The can says to serve cool not cold. I let it sit out for about an hour an I think it might have been a little too long, my stout was a little undrinkable. The aroma was definately dark bitter chocolate with malt undertones. To me it also smelled earthy. The mouth feel was very smooth almost milk-like, not really what I was expecting but still ok. The taste was great. it tasted just like it smelled, aslo some honey and hops. It would be hard for me to drink this all the time but it makes for a nice treat every once in a while."
"The beer poured a very dark brown color with a finger of tan head that dissipated to a thin, bubble film and left fine lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is very solid with a nice, big dark chocolate nose. The flavor has the chocolate again, some alcohol hints there (with only 5.2%?) and some faint fruitiness. This is a full bodied brew, but this beer's drinkability is drug down by the sweetness and body. I don't know how many of these I could suck down in a sitting, but what a pleasure it is to drink to drink just one. Going to cupboard to grab a chunk of dark chocolate now..."
"Pours a dark brown with slight orange highlights. Smells of chocolate and espresso with some citrus. Tastes of cocoa with a nice malt sweetness and a white grape sourness with a pure chocolate finish. Its full in the mouth but slides quickly across the tongue with light carbonation."
"Can't say I was much impressed with this one. Poured out to a dark black coffee color that seemed much thinner than other Milk Stouts i've had. Lower carbonation yielded a small cream colored film on top of the beer. Aroma was chocolatey and sweet, with some roasted malt afterthoughts. Taste was average; some chocolate mixed with roasted wood notes and some heavy malt character toward the finish. Mouthfeel was too light for my taste, but had a touch of a chewy element to it. Overall, an average brew. I've had better, but this one isn't a bad example of the style."
"Pours with two fingers of lattecolored foam. The color is thick, dak brown,almost black. A distinct chocolate aroma with some flowers too. The taste is pretty straightforward chocolate with a bitter hoppiness in the end (or perhaps dark, bitter chocolate?). There is a note of coffee beans there as well. Maybe not as full-bodied as I had expected but surprisingly refreshing. Great stick your head out beer! I don't like the new, ugly bottle though."
"Typical nitro-can pour, looks great, black beer with a tan head. The aroma was mild, with hints of grainy maltiness and chocolate clearly present. The flavor was mild too; there was a hint of roastiness and a bittersweet character but not as strong as some bigger porters. There was some hop bitterness at the end with a stronger bitterness from roasted barley. Overall the beer wasn't as heavy as expected, it struck me as maltier than a Guiness Draught but not quite as roasty-bitter. Thanks to my buddy Brad for setting me up with this one."
"M&D: silky smooth and even creamy on the mouthfeel with a healthy kick of tiny fizz in every sip; the body of this stout is ideal, ever so light that the semi-rich chocolaty maltiness receives a sort of balance in the overall structure, and makes it all the more incredibly easy-drinking, even like a session stout! At 5.2%abv., this beer is a true winner in terms of balance and drinkability. A very solid brew!"
"Pours a solid deep brown color with very light ruby hues to let me know its not black. Nose is cocoa, slight creamyness, light roast. Solid. Flavor followed that same path, dominated by cocoa and sweeter chocolate. Feel is moderate with a moderate to active carbonation. Just shy of thick. This is a solid beer all around, but drinkability is not as high as I would expect. Should be smooth and easy drinking, but the cocoa keeps me from being able to drink it like I want. Still, very nice."
"This is pretty mint. If you like stouts or chocolate, you will likely enjoy this."
"Appearance was nice. Very rich looking. Smell was nothing too spectacular but definitely a little above average. Taste is quite pleasent. Strong chocolate flavor and a good amount of sweetness, but not too sweet. This is one I would recommend to just about everybody. Nothing is too overpowering or strange about this beer so I think many people will like this beer regardless of their favorite style."
"I was presuming it to be thicker, but it is nice. Not as sweet as I expected, but again, nice. It is overall a much understated beer considering what the makers could have done with it. I could drink it for an entire night because it is very smooth and not too pungent. As you can see, I came into this beer having many expectations, the wrong expectations. This shows you that you need to have an open mind and dont judge a beer by its label."
"Less bitterness than St Ambroise and less alcohol than most stouts of this caliber."
"Overall - An excellent stout. Highly recommended !!"
"Drinkability: I could sit here all night and drink this beer. Very drinkable. However, those who do not particular enjoy stouts in general might not be into this beer. For the rest of you, enjoy!"
"I have tried it out of a bottle as well as a nitro can, which I recommend because it leaves a nice thick medium-dark head, and it is really good either way. The color is pitch black with a chocolatey aroma. Tastes great, again with a chocolate aftertaste. It is smooth on your tongue. I recommend this stout to everyone."
"Overall, a very enjoyable brew, worthy of its well-deserved accolades. I'll have another, please."
"~Don't know that I'd sit down with a case of this, but it is a solid beer, very fun to drink, and generally puts me in a good mood."
"This beer was lightly carbonated, and poured right down my throat with the consistency of silky chocolate milk. If only I knew as a child how good the adult version of """chocolate milk""" would be!"
"This is definitely not the beer I thought it was going to be. A meatier body with a touch more sweetness would have helped its cause, but as it stands it is not overpowering and eminently drinkable."
"Therefore, the drinkability is quite low in my book. Just too rich. However, the chocolate taste was good; just take this beer in small samples."
"This amazing brew pours black, but when held to a light reveals a dark ruby hue. A light brown nitrogenated head about 1/4 inch deep persists for the duration of my imbibing. There is ample lacing. The smell is the only ordinary thing about this beer, for it is minimal and hints of chocolate. The taste is complex, with a strong chocolate presence, competing with brandy, vanilla and malt. There is even a faint hop presence on the tip of the tongue, which never manifests as an overt flavor due to the sweeter flavors which predominate. The beer is silky smooth and feels rich but not overpowering. It is very drinkable and is one of the very best beers anywhere."
"Pours black from the bottle with practically no head. Roasted coffee beans and chocolate almonds dominate the nose of this brew and there is understated sweetness to the finish. Goes down somewhat smooth with only a little bite. Lacks a little something in the mouthfeel, would like it to be a little heavier. A great stout when I can find some!"
"Drink ability is above average. Very smooth, toasted flavors go down easy. Good balance between the cocoa flavors and the bitterness created by the roasted malt."
"i should add, i prefer it in the nitro-can."
"This pours a ink black color with a little smallish head.The smell is not very strong with a little chocolate and some coffee.This does have a very chocolate taste.It's like carbonated chocolate milk.It's not bad,but it's not as good as I thought it would be.The m/f is full and flavorful,but I would have to say if you want a chocolate stout buy a Rouges."
"This brew pours an opaque black color. The head is large, and fluffy with a color of white speckled with tan. The aroma has the classic English notes, with some chocolate in the background. All in all, it is rather light in aroma. The taste is somewhat metallic with chocolate in the background. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little too much carbonation for a stout (not so much that it ruins the beer though). Overall, this brew doesn't live up to its name. Single chocolate stout, maybe, but not double. It is not a bad beer, but if I want a real chocolatey beer I will stick with Rogues."
"Overall this one is great, very drinkable. It would make a great after dinner drink or a good dessert beer."
"Beer is medium-bodied, silky, and smooth. It is quite drinkable for a stout, although I prefer my stouts to feel more like a meal after I have downed a pint."
"It's sweet characteristics limit it's ability as a session brew (one was good enough for me), but I can't help but admire this one for it's bold and satisfying taste."
"MF&D- To me, it's pretty rough on the palette. Too much carbonation and bitterness don't mix well with the chocolate, here. Maybe cask-conditioning would even everything out, but all in all, I think there are alot of breweries here in the US making much better exmaples of the chocolate/sweet stout style"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a nice full bodied stout very drinkable. I wish that I had another. The good news is it is easy to find and at a reasonable price."
"An amazing stout, so tasty and goes down so easily."
"Yeah. Tasty, smooth. Not a BIG stout but a good one."
"The head on Youngs double chocolate stout was fantastic with a dark tan color and left exquisite lacing. The body was dark brown and rich. The aroma was of faint brown sugar, roasty coffee and of course, chocolate. It had the common aromatic and taste components of a stout, but had almost a perfect blend of them balanced with the chocolate I expected. It was creamy on the tongue and finished with slight bitterness and moderate carbonation. Overall an exceptional chocolate stout and a damn fine beer."
"Well, what can I say? This isn't a bad beer, but given the reviews on BA I expected more. Part of it, I am sure, is that I just finished a nice bit of Islay scotch so my tastebuds were dulled but. . . I mean, where is the malt? Stouts should have a certain amount of unfermented sugars lingering. Sugars that provide a texture, the produce a mouthfeel. It was silky, there was a nice chocolate bitterness, but, but, but, why? No, it wasn't nearly good enough to make me want to try it again. Not bad, but frankly, if I want a stout, there are better examples out there."
"Hints of both espresso and dark chocolate remain in the palette until your next sip (which I would delay enjoying the rich warmth of the alcohol)."
"Appeared dark as night with a healthy foaming head. Initial aroma was delightful  a cocoa scent that reminded me of a robust chocolate liqueur. A pleasing flavor of malts and chocolate throughout the pint. Most notable was the superb integration of the flavors. This chocolate stout did not possess the beer+ added flavorings characteristic of some flavored brews. Mouthfeel was smooth but not especially creamy. Light carbonation helps the flavor remain pronounced. I may wait until I finish sampling the other Youngs products that a local distributor is now handling before returning to Double Chocolate Stout. A nice beer to end the evening with."
"I love this beer!"
"I really liked this one. I the beer an apologie for a bad pour....therefor I cannot comment on the head of this beer only to say that the consistancy was creamy and full and that the lace was nice sticking to the glass during the entire session. The beer is an opaque brown nothing earth shattering here but a nice looking beer in the glass. The smell is very prominant, sweet malts are almost exclusive with some hop presence to sting the senses. The taste is sweet and there are not just hints of chocolate but full blown taste at the outset. A very nice balance of sweet and smooth/dry and bitter. The finish is a nice bite to balance the smooth cream of the initial flavor. Very creamy feel nicest part of this one I would say. I like this one as well as any I have had so far from the sweet stout class."
"I had higher hopes for this beer. Albeit good, I was expecting more. The beer exhibited good roasted barley qualities with solid bittersweet chocolate aromas with a twinge of lactose. The flavors were solid, but mellow. Not as rich in the lactose and chocolate as I expected. The body is where this beer really fell short with me. It wasn't as silky or smooth as I expected. The texture was a bit grainy and bitter (not from hops) and became watery into the finish. The chocolates never stood out enough to earn the name """Double Chocolate""". Nevertheless, a good beer, I just expected more."
"D: a good treat every now and then, but not an everyday beer. too expensive and too chocolatey for that."
"D- This is a very nice stout. The taste is a bit watery but the smell and mouthfeel really make up for it. This is worth drinking again and a must if it is in cask or aged in barrels"
"Overall, this is a decent beer, but the appeal of Young's beers in general eludes me."
"Notes: Bought for $2.50. Not bad at that price. I'll try it again I suppose, but there are other stouts higher up on the list."
"It is silky smooth (yes, true to the label) and very sweet. I will definately try again."
"Well, when I saw what it looked like, I was sure I was going to love it, but not so. Beautiful, thin, and boring--Young's Double Chocolate Stout would be popular in high school."
"Dont be scared off by its name if you are not a fan of super sweet stouts. I passed this one up many times due to its name, but now I see the error that I had made by ignoring this one. Definitely worth checking out."
"This beer poured out a very dark brown. Not quite black but dark enough. It had a three finger head when poured with good retention. The mouthfeel is fairly good too. It has a little bite to it. Not as smooth as some beers but I would buy it again. The smell is sharp as well. I really like the thick, creamy head. The drinkability of this beer is somewhat decreased by the bite but overall I would recommend it to a dark beer type of person."
"The taste is chewy toffee with a burnt malted flavor and bitter chocolate. There is a slight aftertaste of hops. This stout is very good."
"Drinkability: A wonderful milk/sweet stout that you can drink all day, due to the low alcohol content. The price was also reasonable at a little less than $2 for a 14.9 oz can of this delicious beer."
"Pours a dark, opaque color with a lighter head and good retention. I detect aromas of different varieties of chocolate and cocoa. Very pleasing. My first taste is a blast of chocolate and expresso. As the brew warms, the other characteristics become apparent; a slight nutty flavor with more distinct coffee undertones. I get a rich, bitter-sweet aftertaste that leaves me wanting more. The lower alcohol content for this beer prevents the 'warming' sensation typical of this style. Overall, a very good beer with reasonable complexity and a taste that can be overpowering at times, that's why I'm not scoring it as high in the taste department."
"Overall very good."
"Very balanced for a nitro and seems some what light for the nomenclature however has a balanced finish and good for a session."
"Overall a very flavorful and definitely chocolaty stout. There are no coffee flavors (maybe mocha latte) in this stout, just layers upon layers of chocolate. I remember having this on tap a couple years ago and liking it more than this nitro can."
"Although I think my words are not capturing the moment very well, this is a really great beer that would be welcome in my kegerator any time. well, more so in the fall and winter, I think. It is a little rich and thick for the Florida summer."
"A good drinkable stout. I prefer it in the bottle, but the nitro is an interesting change of pace."
"Recommened, and readily availble."
"This is wonderful in the mouth, with a smooth-as-silk, creamy texture. The taste is layered, with a bit of up-front sweetness and alcohol over a strong roasted-grain background, creating an overall impression of a strong coffee with a shot of dark chocolate. Finishes much drier, with a perfect lingering bitterness again reminiscent of good coffee--it makes the mouth water for more. I was sad to see the last of this go down."
"This is one that I will definitely go back to when I am in the mood for a chocolate stout and after trying this, that may be more often than I have in the past!"
"All in all, quite inoffensive and drinkable, but I'll stick with the Choc. from Rogue.... a bit more complex IMO."
"I forgot how good these things were from the nitro-can"
"Drinkability: Perfectly poundable. Not too heavy but a nicely done beer. A good cross-over beer. Recommended."
"Pour reveals very impressive cascading effect, to form a thick tan head that sticks like nothing else, and a nearly opaque black body...definately a beauty. Aroma reveals subtle hints of unsweetened dark chocolate, roasted malt and a slight hops presence. The taste is a lot blander than i remember, it may be the can or this sample may be old, but this is watered down and not as chocolatey as i remember it. Taste begins with a light cocoa powder taste, followed by a slightly roasted barley flavor and a clean and lightly bitter roasted finish. Mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth with low carbonation."
"This is a great beer! I always seem to like the stouts from a nitro can... this is worth a try for sure, and maybe a second and third try!! haha!"
"overall: a decent chocolate stout. i do prefer others, however. if this is your style, then a must try."
"Overall I enjoyed this stout and would drink one again after dinner sometime."
"Drinkability: This is outstanding, leaves me craving another. I imagine this would be outstanding with any number of deserts, or as desert itself. Just a nicely balanced stout that was really enjoyable, recommended, especially for serving after a nice meal, or as a stand alone night cap."
"Pours black with amber highlights when held to the light. Huge head, almost like it was shaken or something, took a while to pour acutally. Smell was subtle at first - malty, a little sweet, with failt chocolate/coffee notes at the end. Nothing spectacular...until it warmed a bit, and it got amazing. Authentic chocolately, coffee-infused mocha. Taste followed a similar pattern - subtley malty with hoppy balance and choco/coffee notes that became so much richer as it warmed. Detected some slight alcoholic notes, but nothing major. The heady pour made me worried about over-carbonation, but it was perfect along with the smooth creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability is stellar, I could drink this all night for sure. Impressed by this brew, a nice subtle take on a chocolate beer, even better than the Rougue Mocha Porter in my opinion."
"An easy drinking sweet stout, although (thankfully) not quite as sweet as I was expecting. Very dark brown in colour. Very heavy mouth-feel. Could be longer on the finish. The chocolate becomes more apparent as the beer warms up. There is a very minor caramel flavor note as well, and hardly any roasted grain or hop quality."
"What gives with the utter lack of scent on this beer? Pours dark dark brown if not black, frothy light brown head that lingered at two fingers and laced all the way down. Good unsweetend dark chocolate on the tongue, some werthers-like caramel, a bit of cashew or something similar. Very good mouthfeel, perhaps one of the best. The lack of smell bothers me a bit but otherwise quite good."
"Pours black, jet black. Not even a bit of light makes it through my glass. Small but lasting foamy tan head. Nice roasty aroma with a good amount of creamy chocolate. The roasted flavor is strong but not overwhelming or overly dry. The chocolate flavor is of pleasantly bitter baker's (unsweetened) chocolate, not too heavy and not at all cloying. Medium hop bitterness picks up at the end for a lasting dry finish. A nice creamy mouthfeel, and surprisingly drinkable for a beer than I expected to be rich and filling. Always enjoyable in the bottle, but I'd definitely like to try this on tap or in the nitro can."
"Poured into a pint glass with a nice, milk chocolatey head which slowly dissipated. Color was dark and inviting and had hints of amber around the edges when held up to a light. Was highly disappointed with the smell - it had an overpowering yeasty odor, and not in an inviting way. The smell carried over to the taste - yeasty - which did however mellow out over time into a smoother, richer, roasted malt flavor. I couldn't picture myself drinking many of these but will purchase again to give it another try to confirm my initial tasting."
"Pours a very dark black with only a little light coming through at the bottom of the glass, two fingers of beige head that quickly fade to a long lasting cap. Nose isn't very strong, milk chocolate and roasted malt. Taste is excellent--strong roasted flavor to start giving way to a huge chocolaty taste and ending in mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was a tad thin, but very smooth and velvety. I love this beer--it's the best chocolate tasting stout I've had."
"drinkability woudl have to sit somewhere around 4.0. It is so rich that i'm not sure what i'll think of it by the 22nd ounce."
"This was disappointing for the high aspirations I held ,however a reasonable stout all the same"
"A deep brown-black ale with a frothy brown cap and modest carbonation. Delishious aroma of cocoa, nuts, coffee and sweet malts. Rich creamy texture, malt biased with layers of chocolate, coffee, burnt treacle and light grassy hop tones. Finish is long with a fruity fig like decernment that turns dry and bitter in the after taste...a very nice stout , very drinkable but there is a phoneyness about the choclate tastes that you cant get past...other than that it would be one of the world best stouts."
"Black, opaque, with hints of lighter tones at the edges. Small head, lasts for a couple of minutes, then a residual ring. Nose is milk chocolate (vs. a more bitter smelling dark chocolate) with liquid coffee (vs. bean) odors. Taste is mild watery chocolate with the coffee bitterness balancing the sweet. Finish is again more in the coffee realm and doesn't last too long. The mouthfeel is a slight disappointment, not full, not really medium, and thin on the sides. Yet, this is a highly drinkable stout. Have it for desert. Or pour a glass of this and a glass of, say, a Lindeman's Framboise and enjoy with a french vanilla ice cream."
"500 mL bottle, best before the end of January '06 - served chilled in a mug. The pour leaves a big 3 finger tan head that lingers awhile and leaves moderate lacing. The body is black with ruby/brown coming through at the edges when held to light. The smell has chocolate, coffee, a roasted character, and a milky sweetness along with a bit of hops. The taste follows this but with hop nuances - mostly pine and floral - and a nice bitterness that lingers. The flavor isn't too strong but it is strong enough. It has a medium body with a nice carbonation and is somewhat creamy. Delicious."
"The taste follows along the same lines as the nose, malty upfront with chocoalte joing in midway and taking over into a rather dry finish. Nice velvety mouthfeel. I could drink this one all night. Good after dinner drink as well."
"A nice looking brew that's just a few steps away from perfection. A lovely jet black stout color, with a decent froth, though the carbonation is rather light. The scent is probably the worst feature, being a tad astringent, which carries over slightly into the taste, but not too badly. For the most part, the taste is wonderful, a nicely toasted stout flavor with a hearty amount of chocolate. It lacks the harsh bite that comes with most dark stouts, and goes down remarkably smooth, making it really about the most drinkable stouts I've had in a while. Highly recommended."
"The chocolate/buttery richness is delicious but hurts the drinkability slightly, as one bottle is plenty filling."
"Drinkability: Average for me. I probably would pick some of the other/local beers I've reviewed rather than getting this based on price, but this was a good stout."
"Not a bad beer."
"I think this beer really does a great justice to the Milk / Sweet Stout style. I would recommend it for those who are interested in trying a Stout for the first time and want a little sweetness as well. It also would go well with food. Perhaps it's better on tap or in the bottle. I'd recommend those styles before the nitro can, but this isn't bad by any means."
"Dark black body, nearly completely opaque, but not quite. Decent head, stuck around some, no lacing. Huge roasted malt aroma, very nice. Sweet, creamy cocoa comes through as the glass warms. Some hops in the nose was well, but just a hint. Only drawback is the mouthfell. It is quite thin for a stout, a little dissapointing. Sweet and milky, chocolate is obviously in the forefront. Clean bitterness balances the beer nicely. Worth a try, but lots of other stouts I like better."
"Very drinkable stout, I enjoyed this one after dinner while watching Band of Brothers for the third time. Very nice beer from Young's and probably still my favorite English brew yet."
"I'm going to try this beer in bottles first chance I get, and I think it might be better on-tap. While the nitro-cans improve the overall experience of Guinness and others, I suspect that this one would be better in a bottle -- when I have a chance to try it, I'll review it."
"A nice and different stout."
"Overall a nice drink. Just wish the flavor would match the other aspects."
"Thumbs Up!!!"
"This is one of my favorites, and I tend to keep at least one bottle around at all times to treat myself."
"Drinkability: I had heard that this is a good beer to go with desert, and I agree that it would go well with a brownie or chocolate chip cookie, but I think it could qualify as a desert itself. I enjoyed it, but prefer a heavier stout, but that's just a personal preference, so I guess I need to take that into account when rating it."
"Creamy creamy creamy, just the right amount of nitro carbonation. Overall very good and pretty drinkable."
"I will have to find a fresher example of this and see how different the age makes."
"Pours deep black with a nitro-powered creamy white head. Chocolately, creamy, aroma, along with that nitrogen smell. Overall, the taste is very smooth. Lots of sweet chocolate jump out in the taste, along with a little roasted grain. Some hops are apparent in the finish, but definitely take a back seat to the sweet creaminess. The mouthfeel is similar to other nitro-powered stouts - smooth and creamy. However it is fuller than some others I have tried."
"A great desert/after dinner drink."
"Hard to get head (huh?) on this one (may have been somewhat old). But the dry, almost powdery chocolate/coffee quaff with some bourbon undertones made up for it. Excellent medium body with a carb tingle  smooth and savory all the way down the glass. Could have drunk many more than 1 pint of these babies."
"poured a dark, almost opaque black color with minimal head. Smell is of roasted grains with a hint of chocolate. The taste is of coffee mixed with dark chocolate. (a chocolate bar in a bottle ??). Tastes great. a very drinkable stout without being overly sweet"
"Pours moderately viscous black with a foamy and creamy tan head and minor amounts of lacing. Smells of deeply roasted coffee with lots of sweet grainy malts and a touch of dried cocoa. Flavors are quite good. Sweet and malty initially, building toasted coffee flavors, and finishing with sweet powdered chocolate and a slight hop bite. Creamy smooth in the mouth and incredibly easy going down.. A nice session or after-dinner stout."
"Pours like gravity into a black hole. BLACK. Beautiful, thick, rich head with admirable staying power. The nose has all the requisite stout aromas, but I detected a sort of burnt cookie aspect to it, hence the lower score. The taste is pure heaven. It really is chocolatey with excellent bitter counterbalance. Tried with a slice of chocolate decadence at dessert - a great combo. In the mouth it is like a tailored jacket for your tongue. Almost too rich, it would be too filling to drink more than one."
"Pours pitch black with a bubbly tan head with great retention. This beer is a looker. Coffee, some nuts, and milk chocolate in the nose. Nice initial roasted malt followed by some bitter chocolate notes and leading to a nice bitter finish. This is a tasty chocolate stout. Mouthfeel is good although a little on the watery side. This is a very nice sweet stout. Makes a lovely pairing with dessert or just on its own."
"Bottle. Looks great, poured dense black with good sized light tan head which lasted well and left some lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate, hints of milk, treacle (sweet malt I guess) and rum soaked raisins. Not so much sweetness in the taste, more like dark chocolate with a little extra bitterness thrown in. Slight burnt taste towards the end as well. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy as expected, but became a little watery as the beer warmed and the carbonation receeded. Will come back and re-rate this after my beer tastebuds mature a little."
"Larger bottle sampled, with freshness indicator notched onto the label. Pours the expected chocolaty tone of black, tiny bubble film and minor lacing. Nose is all about burnt malt, rum soaked raisins. Soft and smooth mouthfeel, some alcohol peeking through the dense roasted malt flavor. Finefbrew to go with dessert/food or as a flavorful and warming sipper."
"Pours black, with dark ruby red edges. Short brown head quickly recedes and leaves big soapy bubbles on the top. Hardly any lacing to speak of. Delicious smell of strong milk chocolate and roasted nuts, cafe mocha. Taste is less sweet, more bitter dark trouffle, than I expected from the aroma. Smooth creamy texture, pleasant full body. Gets better with every sip as it warms. A special treat."
"Verdict: Overall, this is a nice, roasty stout. The sweetness in the finish ruined it a little for me, though."
"Pours black with a redish purple glint above the stem of the glass when held to strongest available light. Creamy light brown head that laces well. Sweet milk chocolate aroma with a chocolate malt note. Some pear adds to complexity. Medium to full body. A well blended combination of real chocolate, chocolate malt, roasted barley dryness balanced with hop bitterness. So drinkable I have nothing written down. I remember wanting a little more complexity from the stout side and being well satisfied by the chocolate not overwhelming the stout. Thanks to Dereck for sharing a fine milk/sweet stout look forward to another tasting session (hopefully with something to pair with freash trout)!"
"A very enjoyable beer. Chocolate was pleasant, I was worried it might be overbearing. Not at all. Would be great with a fudge brownie and ice cream, maybe even barbecue."
"UPDATE: I tried this brew in a bottle, and it was very mediocre. Get the nitro can..."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and oily, with nice carbonation. Just the right amount of bitterness on the tongue. Drinkability is good for a stout, but for me, I really cannot have more than two of these without wanting for a change."
"Drinkable? Need you ask? an aperitf? a digestif? ...Superlative!"
"Overall impressions: Dessert in a bottle! This is a great stout with some rich chocolate flavors mixed in. Perfect combination to any dessert, and thick enough to be a meal in itself."
"Not much body to it, but a nice balance and an easy drinker."
"Rich and yummy. Can't get enough of these nitro-cans lately. The pour was very interesting. The first third of the can came out chocolate brown, but then it switched to midnight brown. The aroma is a bit smokey, but very chocolatey and surprisingly slightly hoppy. The flavor as also very surprising. I was expecting more smooth and chocolate milk-like. But I got more dark chocolate with a very nice hoppy kick at the end. There were also slight burnt malts happening. The mouthfeel is rather heavy and very rich. I am not sure I could stomach more than a couple of these."
"Black liquid, no highlights at all. Nice thick creamy tan head, which had great retention. Roasty aroma, along with milk chocolate. Flavor again is roasty, but not over the top. Bittersweet chocolate flavor. Not much in the way of the hops. The chocolate flavor is certainly present, but not enough to be cloying. There seemed to be a slight sourness to it. Creamy mouthfeel, medium to full body, with low carbonation. Great dessert beer, or a treat from time to time. Very enjoyable."
"I love this beer. If there is ever a crowd pleaser this is it. The malt is huge with hints of, well, chocolate. On nitro it looks beautiful and out of the bottle the flavor can't be matched by any stout. Oddly enough it brings back childhood memories of Count Chocula. It is that grain and chocolate blend that makes everyone ask for another. It couldn't be more drinkable. Big, big cheers."
"One of my favorite beers of all time...If you are a connoisseur of stouts, this is one for you."
"a fine beer that, unlike many, lived up to my expectations."
"Draft, Exchequer Pub, Chicago Loop. A great beer to find, and even better that they have a sign in their window to promote it. Though tapped by CO2, still had a nice pub pour with a cascading head. Tan foam starts off the very creamy taste & texture, and coats rather than laces the glass. A great smooth taste with a definite but not overpowering chocolate note in the swallow. Less harsh roast notes than a Guinness, with a nice hop note, too. Nice whisky or peat smoke notes in the finish."
"Slàinte!"
"Comments - This beer is a winner. It has a great rich flavor that does not have to hit you over the head to get your attention."
"This brew has some chocolate flavors but it's not sweet by any definition. A very nice Stout."
"As with most nitro beers, this is pleasure to drink with a very high drinkability level. I could drink this all night long with no problem."
"I'm more of a fan of lighter beers, and only drink a few stouts, but this beer is so well-crafted that I become completely enraptured with every time I drink one, and forget my normal prejudices. Truly wonderful."
"Poured from a 440 ml nitro can. This beer is nearly black. The tan head is quite large. You know how you can tell a beer has a nice head? When it is 2 inches high when you pour it, and there is still 2 inches of head in the bottom of the glass when you finish. Aroma is chocolatey, and it improves as the beer warms. One of the best chocolate flavors I've experienced in a beer. I could not detect any hop flavor. The creamy mouthfeel brings out the flavors in this beer, and also makes this beer go down so easily."
"Deep brown to black color with a creamy tan head (nitro tap). The pour led to a thick creamy sheet of lace down the side of the glass. All chocolate roast malt aromas, a mild hop aroma (accenting the cherry) appeared in back. Taste is dominated by chocolate and cherry with the slightest bit of hops. The roasted hops used in the brew definitely combine well to bring out a berry aroma and flavor. Creamy, velvety mouth feel. Give me more!"
"God I love this beer. So does my girlfriend. Don't know if that's good or bad."
"Very easy to enjoy, though also rather filling. Despite this, I could have easily enjoyed more than the 500ml offered from the bottle. A great stout and a great beer that I will be sure to have time and time again. Would be perfect with a chocolate dessert or alone as a dessert in and of itself. IMO as chocolate stouts go, perhaps only surpassed by Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, save for those who are repulsed by the taste of coffee, as my mate was."
"Pours very black, with a tan head about one finger thick head. The beer laced well throughout the glass. Smells roasty, with some coffee, and chocolate notes. Taste was lighter than I expected, malty flavour with a nice chocolate note at the end. Really thought it would be a lot more chocolate like, but the double chocolate name is quite deceiving as its a quite subdued chocolate flavour. Has a nice and smooth mouthfeel with a little bitterness. Beer has pretty good drinkability, could see myself downing a few of these. Good beer but i was a little disappointed in the chocolate content."
"Reflection: WOW! This is what a chocolate stout should taste like. They didn't pull any punches with the chocolate and they still made a very refreshing and drinkable dessert beer."
"Appearance is black with light-brown head. A nice layer of cream resides on top and remains throughout the pint. Smell isn't very strong, but fairly rich. Aroma is more of real chocolate than chocolate malts. Taste is rich and smooth. Dark chocolate tastes are the strongest, though I think they should be even stronger. Mouthfeel is very creamy and enjoyable. Drinkability is great for such a dark beer, this isn't as heavy as I predicted. I really enjoyed Young's Double Chocolate, I think it could be beer nirvana if the chocolate flavor was even stronger. A great beer for dessert!"
"Nice for a dessert. Black liquid - very little light gets thru, with a tan brown head. Aromas of coffee and chocolate is present - like a bitter, baking chocolate. As it warms up, the chocolate becomes even more pronounced. Amazing smells. Can really taste both chocolate malt and and dark chocolate or cocoa as well. Creamy, with a full body, smooth as velvet. Dry and slightly bitter aftertaste, like dark bitter chocolate. Not an every day drink, but awesome for a special occasion. Two thumbs up."
"mouthfeel was somewhere between guiness and storm king. not as thin as Guiness but not near as heavy as storm king. all in all a very drinkable and enjoyable stout. i will definitley drink this again"
"-Mouthfeel is silky and smooth, with a surprisingly light body. Overall very good and drinkable. Probably too sweet for mass-consumption, but great for dessert."
"Pours black with a little light peeking in. Very dark and rich looking. Thick head that has very good retention. Smells of faint malts and chocolate. Heavily carbonated, could do with less (took some points for that in taste, it left me gassy the rest of the night). Otherwise, is an almost bitter, heavy malt flavor with significant chocolate tastes that become more prominent as you're finishing your sips. Very nice, true chocolate taste. Goes down alright, except for the extreme carbonation causing you to almost regurge. Overall, I'd get it again, but I'd have to prepare myself for the bubbles. Also, was expecting a little extra sweetness."
"I had this on tap at Smokin Joe's in the Southside of Pittsburgh. Beautiful black body with great tan head and excellent cascading action due to the nitrogen tap. The smell was of toasted malt and dark chocolate. The flavor was nice and malty with a subtle dark chocolate aftertaste that became more apparent as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. Man, this is an excellent beer! Not quite as good as Rogue Chocolate, IMO, but it is still a top notch brew."
"Drinkability: Very tasty. It's like Cadbury's and Guinness got together and had a kid!"
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass. This beer has a big frothy head with creamy glaze to it. The color is an ice dark brown to black with no light coming through. The nose is full of dark chocolate, alcohol, and malty sweet scents. The flavor is a bit sour and very roasty at the beginning. Notes of raisin, tangerine, and caramel. A big contribution of chocolate malt gives it a good base for other flavors. Unfortunately I found that this beer had an unpleasant sourness to it that hurt the overall flavor. It is a bit watery at the end as well, not as creamy as expected for the style."
"A staple sweet stout that I will return to many more times."
"Deep dark brown with chestnut and ruby highlights. The widget did its work - the beer cascaded for a few minutes and left a half-inch cap of thick finely bubbled foam that hung around for the duration. Aroma is light and reminds of sweet malt, some chalky cocoa, a bit of roastiness. Flavor is thin at first, but gathers pungency as it travels. Cocoa yes, but it's light and allows other flavors to rise up like raisin, cherry, bitter coffee, and smoke from a smoldering fireplace. As the glass warms, resinous bark flavors and hints of whiskey arise. Like it says on the can, drink it cool, but not ice cold."
"Notes: A wonderful chocolately stout that never disappoints. I usually drink it on nitro-tap or nitrocan. I feel that the bottled version has a thinner body, leaves a slick mouthfeel, probably from the lactose or dextrins, . Nitro and the non-nitro are both very good, but I think I like the nitro a little bit more."
"Great bottled aswell as nitro can, two different experiences, more pronounced flavour in the bottle"
"One of my favorite stouts overall. A 4-pack of the cans is surely worth it if you're looking to try it. Never had it in the bottle, and knowing how delicious it is in the can I don't know if I really want to."
"This stout may not be for everyone, but the sweet chocolate is so dominate that nothing else is exactly like it. Long after the beer is gone, one can still imagine EXACTLY how it tasted. This one I hightly recommend."
"If this stuff wan't so expensive I would buy it all the time. At $3 for a pint bottle, it's better than just about every stout I've had on tap."
"Pours black as midnight with some auburn highlights. Luxurious milk-chocolate head that sticks around for good. The smell is creamy and chocolaty with an underlying alcohol aroma. The taste is sublime with an oatiness right out of the gate followed by a nice astringent alchohol and bitter hop note. The finish is absolute creamy chocolate bar supreme. Mouthfeel is big and creamy and envelopes the whole palate with its broad range of texture and flavor. Drinkability is good but the sweetness becomes a little too pronounced upon warming. Fantastic stout, this is, and a true rival to the Rogue Choco-Stout."
"This beer's got more chocolately goodness than a bag of Hershey's Kisses. The head is the same off-white, creamy head you get from a Guinness or any other nitro can, but the color is definitely a few shades darker. The nose, taste and aftertaste are all dark, rich chocolate, with some espresso and faint alcohol accents. The mouthful is rich and creamy, and the lack of carbonation makes this stuff go down like a warm glass of milk. A tasty alternative to Guinness Draught."
"I'll get the 22oz. next time, if you like the stout's this one's for you."
"Pours a nice dark head that has staying power. The brew is so dark you can't see through is even when held up to a bright light. Good rich chocolate smell that over powers everything else. Taste as expected, like drinking a chocolate covered cherry. More alcohol on aftertaste then I might have expected. It's real clean on the tongue. Leaves the mouth quickly. I expected it to hang around longer. All and all a real treat. I can't recommend a case, but a six-pack or a bottle or tow from time to time is well worth it."
"Consumed in October 2004 from a 16 oz bottle purchased at Trader Joes. Well, I expected much more from this beer. I'm not a huge stout fan, so maybe I need to try a few more in line with this beer. I have had a few other chocolate stouts and enjoyed them more than this one. It poured with a nice head and very nice lacing alnog the sides of the glass. Smells of deep dark chocolate. The carbonation ruined it for me though. Way too much for my taste. It was still good, but I'm used to the smoother ones. This one was rich and creamy, but the fizz was a bit too much for me. I also drank it a bit too cold I think. Just took it out of the fridge and drank it. Maybe I will try this one on tap if I can find it and re-rate."
"This was a very enjoyable stout. It poured a deep and dark color, with a beautiful tan foamy head which lasted for the duration. The smell was of sweet malts. The taste was smooth and sweet. Everyone should sample this fine beer. The closer this approaches room temperature the tasty it becomes. Enjoy!"
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy at the start and ends smoothly. Feels like your tongue is coated thickly and the chocolate flavors last long into the aftertaste. Extremely drinkable and would go great with a nice chocolate dessert."
"Just had another one of these last night and wow. I was blow away. I have found a new love for Youngs after years of advodance. I was a beautiful pour and smelled on point. The chocolate taste mixed with the roasted malt and barely to make this a great stout. Delicatly balanced bitterness and nice sweet follow that is not over powering considering that it is a milk sugar sweet. I was sad that it was the only one I had, I will definatly be adding to the usual rotation."
"Drinkability: Very easy to sip, very satisfying, not so unique that the flavor would slow you down after a few. A great rendition of stout, not as full of flavor as some, but immensely drinkable and enjoyable."
"Nice dark opaque body with dark beige hefty head. The emphasis on chocolate was not as present as I was hoping for. Granted this was a nice overall stout, but I was looking for a little bit extra from the chocolate. Nice roasted tones with chocolate backing and a smooth finish to round it out."
"A beautiful black beer with a very chunky tan head. It smells chocolaty and malty...A liquid dessert... It has a very sharp flavor...chocolate followed by a bitter dark roasted/chocolate malt kicks the whole experience into overdrive. This is a very drinkable beer if you like mild stouts. I love Young & Co's Brewery and I hope they continue to make their awesome beers for a long time."
"A thick, malty beverage with a sweet, almost syrupy taste. More malty than hoppy. Not much head. Fairly filling; the 16.9 ounce bottle is perhaps just a bit more than I'd want to drink at one sitting; a great beer to share with a friend! I liked this stout quite a lot, and would recommend it highly to any beer lover who's willing to try something new and different."
"Drinkability  This is a nice, low-ABV stout that can be enjoyed several times over in a night."
"Drinkability: One of the better stouts around, this is just as drinkable as any other."
"Very smooth mouthfeel and moderately thick body which blends well with the creamy head as you drink. Just a bit of carbonation is apparent. Very drinkable for a sweet stout."
"This is perfect to any desert that's based on chocolate, to a chocolate cake or just as a desert itself. Perfect double chocolate, really love it."
"It's a fairly smooth drinking beer, one I've had repeatedly and will have again in the future. The chocolate is much more noticeable than in other stouts & I really like that. Also, the coffee is not so heavy as in others and I like that too. A really well balanced beer. Although not the finest example of the style, a consistently good one."
"This beer is opaque black in color with a thick tan head. The head is long lasting, leaving a lot of lace behind. The smell is mainly of chocolate. Upon tasting there again the chocolate and a hint of coffee. It is kind of sweet, but not overly so. The mouthfeel is full and creamy smooth. This is a very drinkable brew. This beer is an dessert in itself."
"this is a good beer i get on occassion when i just feel like having something relatively simple tasting that is unique. i think the mouthfeel for this beer is really wondeful with the nitro-can, and is truly a beer that benefits from that."
"Jet black body, light tan towering head. Smells of sweet chocolate, roasted malts. The name is not being clever, this is really double chocolate. Like a glass full of chocolate frosting in beer form, with hints of espresso beans. Body is silky smooth, with light carbonation. Excellent dessert beer for sure."
"While this is a nice tasting brew, I can't imagine having one very frequently. It's a bit of a novelty act - chocolate flavored beer - and it pushes the boundaries just a bit far to be something I'd want to drink on a regular basis. Being the confirmed chocolate addict, I'll certainly keep one around for those rare moments where a chocolate stout would compliment a meal."
"-Oelergud"
"drinkability: very good, it is a beer that you would want to drink again, also a beer that you could drink more than one of, very nice!"
"For the price this stout is pretty impressive though it definitely falls short of other Milk stouts like the Bell's line (Kazoo & Double Cream) and Mackeson."
"A very nice treat of a beer. Not something I'm going to go out and buy on a regular basis though. Actually my non-beer appreciating girl friend brought home a 4 pack of these beers one night because she thought chocoate beer might be nice. She had one and really liked it. She likes Youngs, she likes me...what can I say? The girl has good taste."
"Very good, one I would definitely recommend and will be getting again."
"Quite an interesting brew. An alcoholic chocolate milk with stout overtones. Bizarre but yummy at the same time."
"One complaint was that the carbonation was a bit much. Made this stout a little less creamy than it could've been. But overall, very finely crafted."
"Pours a midnight black with a big fluffy brown head that falls to a finger size cap that leavves a light lacing down my glass. Aroma is roasted malt some coffee aromas and chocolate of course along with some citrus from the hops. Taste is great and stouty roasted malts lightly sweet with a touch of chocolate and lightly bitter coffee flavor and a dose of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is great smooth and creamy as it rolls around your mouth like drinking velvet. Drinkability is wonderful just a touch of chocolate to complement an already wonderful stout unlike another chocolate stout that seemed to be all chocolate. I would highly recommend this stout could drink these all night."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Creamy mouthcoating mouthfeel with tingly but restrained carbonation. Absolutely delicious chocolatey finish that lasts a while. This beer was way better than I expected. Very rich."
"The mouthfeel was smooth and extremely creamy, rather rich than thick, quite enjoyable. Slightly floury, nicely warming. The label says it all: """silky, rich, creamy and smooth""". However, I would enjoy more chocolate and less of that alcohol feeling."
"This is a gorgeous, gorgeous stout. Deep ruby black with a thick, dense, rocky, tan head. That baby sticks around for the whole show as well. The aroma is largely chocolate and not a lot of roast or burnt aromas. The same goes for the flavor with the chocolate being dominant and not a lot of burnt or bitterness behind it. Nicely sweet and a great after-dinner sipper."
"Wow. I love this stout. A dark thick brew with a creamy tan head that lingers. Decent lacing as it settles. Smells so sweet. It taste just like it is named, chocolaty. Although this is very sweet there is a small hint of hops lingering in the aroma and taste. A find this not as drinkable as other stouts, even though it is only 5.2%abv. It is rather heavy for me to consume too much."
"this stout is tasty. huge head, all the way to the bottom. defining taste is the chocolate. the smell is chocolate. the whole goddamn is chocolate. mouthfeel is heavy....will fill you up fast. three is about my max but, just so good may have another against my better judgement. wha the hell i'll have another. one of the many fine brews at nahabinghi in youngstown. oh"
"($2.79 / 16.9 oz.)"
"A very big, dark, tan, solid, foamy head leaves lots of sticky lacing. Sweet, dark, black chocolate and an illusion of coffee in the nose. Dark chocolate again in the front, of course, but some nice surprising fruit, too. It persists through the full, thick, milky middle. Finish is light, fresh cocoa. Excellent. This is proof that you should revisit the classics from time to time. I remembered this beer as pure sweet chocolate... a little too sweet for me. But this time it was just right. Maybe I was remembering the nitro can."
"Wyll-"
"This is a highly drinkable beer. Very smooth and mellow, but flavorful."
"The palate didn't live up to the aromas, yet it was still a classy drop from start to finish, and went well with desert."
"A fun, nice beer. Not the richest or most complex stout you'll run across, but it's one almost anyone can enjoy. I liked it a lot."
"Highly drinkable."
"And Lord, it doesn't disappoint. Big mouthful of bitter chocolate supported by the sweet malt beneath. Mouthfeel is thick, smooth and silky, and finishes in a tight bittersweet kiss of smoky chocolate. This one lives up to its name. You'll almost want to pour this into a brandy snifter and sip it by the fire on cold nights. This is not something to drink every night, but when you want something dark, rich, and extravagant, you'd do well to try this one."
"Try it, you'll like it."
"Sampled on tap at Nathans in Washington DC. Poured a classic nitro stout black with white creamy head. Smelled a tad sour, I am wondering if this maybe had been around for awhile. Taste was good... sweet, chocolatey with a touch of maybe hazelnut. Not one of my favorite stouts because of how sweet it is, but definitely a nice beer to relax with for a nice conversation after dinner (what I was doing at the time)."
"Can: Poured a dark black beer with a nice foamy head with great retention. Carbonation is very good with a lighter body then expected. Taste is very smooth with some roasted malts and chocolate taste with a light dry finish. This is a very refreshing beer and easily drinkable. I remember having that beer about five years ago from a bottle and the chocolate taste was more pronounced. Overall, this is an easy to drink stout."
"Overall Impression: Only thing that slows down drinkability is the weight of the beer. It is filling and satisfying. I went to the fridge asking Dessert or beer? I had both with this gem. Try, and share. This is a great gateway stout, especially for the ladies."
"Purchased in an elegant looking 0.5 liter brown bottle with a regal purple label that exudes an upper crust, classy quality. When poured into an imperial pint glass, the body is deep brown in color and borders on the verge of being completely black, but indicates chocolate colored highlights when held up against the light. Other than the highlights at the edges, not much passes through the dense liquid. The head is a towering layer of foam, at least two inches thick initially, and has the color of a chocolate milk shake. After it dies down, it leaves a rich brown lace around the glass. The aroma is pretty mild, and the chocolate smell is clearly present, but does not overpower the other roasty aromas. Taste is sweet, but not cloyingly so. The chocolate is supplemented by flavors of raisin, rum, and dark roasted coffee. The aftertaste is dry, and has a bit of bitterness to it. The beer is a bit thin on the palette for a stout and has an earthy to chalky mouthfeel. A dark, mild beer, which pacifies your soul as it touches your mouth."
"If I could find them more often, this would be my fall back <and> session beer. This is good stuff."
"This beer pours quite dark and leaves a mid-sized tan (or khaki) head that gets smaller within ten minutes. The aroma is actually quite excellent, smelling malty and a little chocolatey. The taste doesn't quite live up to the beer's billing, though, because it seems a bit too sweet and the alcohol taste is not covered up by the malt. A bit more effort with the malt and this could be an excellent beer; however, it is still a relatively good beer and comes recommended to stout fans."
"Solid black body with a moderate tan head that quickly dissapears. Aroma is sweet and chocolatey...wow, shocking huh? Taste is crazy, sweet malts lead with a bittersweet chocolate middle gaining sweetness before a slightly bitter finish and powdery cocao end. Mouthfeel is spot on. This beer went down like a french prizefighter, I can't believe its gone already."
"Drinkability: It is hard to project just how this outstanding brew would play over the course of four or five...but I am willing to give it a shot!"
"Beef Notes: A great beer and one I would love to find on tap. This is the third most chocolatey beer I've ever had behind Rogue CS and SACB. I've had it in the can and the bottle seems to be better. I'm sure I'll be drinking it again sometime."
"I should have gotten the bottle. But the nitro can worked out OK. The beer pours a black with nice off-white head. The head stayed around until I finished the beer. The nose is mostly cocoa. The taste is mellower than the nose. Very smooth and drinkable. Somewhat bitter finish. This is a fine tasting beer. I like the strong Imperials better; but this is a top notch beer"
"This is a beer I like, but would only drink one of, preferably the last beer of the evening. Drinking more than one accentuated the bitterness and lost the sweet maltiness that I initially enjoyed."
"This particular brew is much better (IMO) from the can rather than the bottle."
"Pours a near jet black that has ruby undertones if held to the light. Nice fluffy tan head. The smell is of rich chocolate with a little coffee and brandy thown in . Taste is quite similar to the smell, nice rich chocolate with just enough bitter to keep it balanced. The chocolate definately comes out more as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is good as carbonation is low, and this helps the creamy chocolate flavour come through. While its a tasty treat I dont think I would have more than one in a night. A good dessert beer, but not something I would drink any other time"
"This one did not impress me as much in the bottle as it did on tap. The beer poured a usual stout black with fizzy brown head that faded quickly into nothingness. The smell was much weaker than the tap version I had but still had hints of chocolate and coffee. The taste is what really suffered though. The chocolate flavors and the roastiness were still there but were quite subdued compaired to the tap version. Maybe I just got a bum bottle? Either way I think I'll skip the bottle from now on."
"Widget can, thanks piscator34 Dark brown with a full off-white foamy head, ultra-sticky. Aroma is very malty with rusty crystal malt tones lifting almond, brown chocolate (nutella?), and vanilla flavours. It's actually unpleasant to me when fresh, but at room temperature, it gets tolerable although definitely not a beer I particularly enjoy. It's very sweet, nutty and with honest chocolate milk peaks, but rather tart and cloying with metallic astringency. Pretty thin bodied although quite creamy and smooth."
"warmed up a bit...The chocolate is more pronounced and sweet. Also some black currant type flavors showing up. Noticeable buttery diacetyl taste here. This is somewhat complex once warmed up, but still tastes alot like a beefed up Bass ale. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with tiny bubble carbonation. Medium bodied. Drinkablity suffers from the heavy diacetyl flavors, but still quick drinkable. Not the best stout I've had, but worth trying for sure."
"Even as a dessert brew I'd find this drinkable only within the category. Just personal preference I guess."
"500ml gone in 15 minutes with nothing to show for it. No wonder they do not brew smaller sizes, I cannot imagine how fast 330 ml would disappear. This is the first stout I ever enjoyed."
"Overall: Good after-dinner beer, very dessert-like with the chocolate tones."
"Overall - Wow. This is one excellent brew. Give this a try."
"Young's Rules!!"
"--Joey"
"This beer is an excellent way to cap off any good night."
"Pours like coffee and cream! Cafe color fills the glass, then settles out slowly and beautifully in waves of white and tan to a pure black with a thick white head. It looks like a chocolate shake with whip cream! It does smell slightly of chocolate, but I found the smell to be masked by the intense thickness of the head. Initial taste is quite flat and slightly thin, with pronounced bitterness. It is silky smooth and creamy however, and the bitterness is balanced and slowly melted away by a strong milk and dark chocolate aftertaste. I did not detect any alcohol taste. The mouthfeel was severely damaged by the thinness and lack of carbonation. Is this the nitro coming through? The head did stay intact at about 3/4""" till the bottom of the glass. Overall it was ok - nice dessert drink but I will probably not try it again anytime soon."
"Overall, I think this would make a terrific dessert drink. It's probably not something I'd drink a lot of or frequently though."
"Despite the dark chocolate assault on the senses, this is a decent beer that I would try again."
"IMHO: A great, thick full flavored stout. Well balanced and easy to drink."
"Probably one of the best chocolate beers out there. I'd take this over Rogue's Chocolate. Great dessert beer that pairs naturally with chocolate desserts or a fine treat all by itself."
"I love watching the cascading effect on these nitros. When all is settled this beer is a deep brown with a tan color head. I could not detect much aroma on this beer, just subtle notes of chocolate. I love watching the cascading effect on these nitros. When all is settled this beer is a deep brown with a tan color head. I could not detect much aroma on this beer, just subtle notes of chocolate. Once you dive in and taste this beer the chocolate smacks you in the face. This is basically a chocolate milkshake in the guise of a stout. The taste definitely lends to this beer being consumed as a dessert. The mouthfeel is typical of a nitro beer: smooth and creamy. Drinkability is lacking as I would not want to have more than one of these in a night. I'd like to call this a niche stout, it serves it's purpose well when looking for chocolate and it is interesting, just not one of my favorites."
"pours midnight black with a creamy brown-tinged off white head, which subsides to a collar that manages to stick around a bit. light roasted barley with hints of chocolate on the nose. light to medium (read: too thin) body, sparse carbonation. still somewhat smooth, light roasted flavor with subtle hints of chocolate. light bittering hops provide an easy finish. not very in your face, which makes it quite quaffable. i think this beer would be helped substantially by the nitro effect. i'll try it in the nitro can next time. still, a solid easy drinking flavored stout."
"I can't believe I've never reviewed this one before! I always have it a couple of times a year at least, as it is such a treat. Anway, dark and opaque when poured, the overflowing head quickly dissipated. I thought the aroma was more coffee-like. Basically I find the taste to be smooth, and reminiscent of a tootsie roll, although one made with darker chocolate. A wonderful treat that chocolate lovers should enjoy. Good stuff."
"The King recommends drinking this beer with a salisbury steak (extra gravy)."
"An extremely easy drinking stout. I'd recommend this for anyone that's a novice to to the style, as the chocolate and nitro softens up the roasted bittersweetness considerably. Not something I'd want every day, but it's worth a pint when available."
"It's probably not something that I'd have more than one of in a row, but I'd say that if you like the style, you will probably enjoy this."
"Of all the nitrogen-delivered stouts I have had, Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout ranks at the top. It's an amazing brew from start to finish that just pleases so many senses. (I highly recommend pairing this with chocolate: the beer takes on a wonderful new complexion when paired with it.)"
"A fine showing from Young's. Pours a dark black with some reddish elemnts if held up to the light. Moderate to mild off-white head. Smell is ok, nothing especially worth noting. But taste is quite good! Malty and sweet, I taste hops, sugar, dark chocolate, and coffee flavors. Good carbonation. The mouthfeel lets you know that they really used alot of dark chocolate in there, as my mouth feels like I have just eaten a really dry dark chocolate bar after swallowing. What seems like cocoa particles resides in my mouth. Very tasty and very drinkable, an excellent chocolate stout."
"Taste: Taste is more of a mocha cofee taste that anything chocolate. I find it great however as this is my favorite and my wifes favorite. Great to must out on Valentine's day."
"Beer is good. Happy brewing."
"A fantastic stout. Everything a good stout should be. Almost black in colour with a thick frothy tan head. It had a strong chocolate aroma with a slight coffee scent. The taste reminded me of Ben and Jerry's Coffee Coffee Buzz Buzz. It was a fantastic coffee flavor with strong chocolate tones. It is a true desert beer with a hearty dark chocolate and coffee taste."
"For some reason I can't find the bottle verison of this anymore, did they all change to the nitro-can? Well anyway, who cares I guess, this is down right terrific. Nice thick head on this beer that lasts all the way down to the last drop. Smell consists of chocolate (duh) and some some malts underneath. Taste was super. Nice chocolate flavor with a little hop bite. Quite creamy, but just a little thin but that's ok. A little bitterness aftertaste and can still taste some of that chocolate at the end too. Very nice coco stout."
"Elegant 25 oz bottle pours a dark and opaque black with an enormous cocoa head. Globs of cocoa lacing are left down the glass. Aroma screams Chocolate, with burnt dark grain in the background. Velvety smooth, rich, and creamy in the mouth with adequate, but subdued, carbonation. Sweet, dark chocolate kicks off the taste. A complex mix of roasted coffee and more chocolate seem to be the backbone, but some fine English hops bitterness never let this become overly sweet. Very tasty, and finishes with a bittersweet chocolate note. A very well crafted stout that has lots of character."
"My fridge is too cold to keep beer as I barely smell or taste much at first, and the body seems rather thin for a stout. Crystal and dark malts sneak up on my palate only after a swallow. Then the roasted barley bite keeps me trying for a while, but no I'm sorry. Lost interest about a third of the way in."
"The beer is a highly flavorful one, but remains pretty light. The body is medium with a cream like buttery texture to it. Roasted bitter finish. Im a sucker for the nitro can. This is a real beauty of a beer, nitro or not."
"Black pour with a generous tan head. The nose is nicely highlighted by cocoa and mild chocolate. The taste is of cocoa and light, un-sweetened chocolate. Semi-bitter finish. The mouthfeel was very light and lacked body & richness. As for being a """double chocolate stout""" i would say that Rogue and Storm King live up to that name sake more so than this beer. The drinkability is poor b/c if i want a stout, i don't really want something this light and easy drinking."
"This is a thick and rich beer. It would be an excellent dessert beer, perhaps going best with some strong cheeses."
"Very drinkable for so hearty a brew."
"The Double Chocolate Stout is certainly easy to drink, but it was not as thick and balanced as I'd hoped - and I didn't really detect much chocolate. As a dessert beer it was interesting, but overall a bit too sweet as well."
"Drinkability I find would be limited due to the sweetness and the body."
"Most excellent."
"Mildly bitter to drink, malts, a hint of licorice and a savory lingering chocolate aftertaste. A delightful glass of beer."
"Almost four years later, I had this on tap at Cole's and while it is thick foam that coats the mouth and there is chocolate and coffee there, it paled the new Ommegang chocolate and Rogue imperial porter. Beautiful chocolate black."
"A fresh bottle of this stuff....for about a buck 50....awesome! This is a jet black colour with a lovely beige head. The aromas are of chocolate, and roasty toasty malts. The taste is chocolatey and caramely with some lovely roasted malts and light hops in the mix as well. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and oh-so-excellent and the drinkability is simply out of this world. Awesome stuff!"
"Plainly, I love this beer. This being my preferred taste, I can drink these all night long, and I think I'll do just that."
"it finishes like godiva liquor, sweet and chocolatey"
"Drinkability: Not something I'd want to drink more than one of at a time, but a very nice offering nonetheless. I suppose if I were having a chocolatey dessert, this beer would match quite well, but sitting here drinking it and eating a piece of sharp cheddar cheese, it's not quite the same."
"Incredible head, amazing staying power, as expected. Super malty nose, dark look like you couldn't believe, smoothness to die for. Get if possible, on draft , draft can, or plain old bottle, whatever you can..."
"A nearly black and opaque brew with a very thick and creamy head of creme-color. Beautiful beer, and that everlasting nitro-head is a pleasure to look at, but not as much so as to sip and get the incredibly creamy mouthfeel. Huge toffee in the aroma along with a good deal of cocoa and some mild hops. Roasted malt greets your taste buds, and of course the generous amounts of chocolate and toffee. A nice mild English bitterness complements these perfectly. Again, wonderfully thick and creamy mouthfeel. Light to medium body, but rich for an English beer. Quite drinkable, would make a great session beer if you're in the mood for good bittersweet chocolate, and a great dessert beer on the same note. A pleasure on tap. Looking forward to having it again."
"I loved Young's Oatmeal Stout, so, thought I'd try their offering in the gorgeous purple and orange can. It soon became a favorite. I recently tried it on tap at the Yardhouse in Denver - and it is even better on tap than in the nitro-pack can. Especially in a tall ½ yard glass! Talk about a creamy, solid foam head - it never goes away! The massive clouds of foaming brew forms slowly as the soft brown cascades of carbonation struggle to the top. When the beer settles down, it is an opaque coffee brown  and the aroma contains coffee. And chocolate - with a hint of vanilla. But surprisingly the taste is more of a stout experience than sweet. Just right. Amazingly good. Okay, perfect."
"This has been my second tasting of this beer and either the beer has improved a lot (which I doubt) or my palate has improved a lot. We will go with number 2!"
"I had the pleasure of this on tap at the Blue Nile in mpls.Dark sultry with medium off white head.The smell is dark chocolate malt and sweet sweet milk chocolate.I sip and its like a candy bar in a glass, yet not cloying or too strong.I have had this from a bottle and it was not nearly so balanced or choco good. It fills and coats the mouth nicely, so smooth and gentle.After dinner , as a snack, this one is so nice. Some gentle hops hover in the background as I ponder how nice to be alive and relax with Youngs D C S"
"This beer has dethroned Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout and Rogue Chocolate Stout as my favorite chocolate brew. At $6.99 for a four pack, a bit expensive for a college student, but I'm sure I'll be buying it again and again."
"So smooth and creamy, it was almost like having a serving of malty choclate mousse. This is an oustanding, exceptional brew. Buy some now and enjoy!"
"Overall: Definitely a cold weather beer, it reminds me of a good cocoa and a warm blanket"
"My first sip brings a silky malt taste. It's smooth, roasted, and enjoyable. The label says """double chocolate""" yet I find myself searching, reaching for that hint of chocolate. A mere kiss will do. This is a very fine stout however I'm a bit disappointed in my over-anticipation."
"I have to admit to a bit of disappointment with this brew. Don't get me wrong, it's very good, as my rating suggests -- it's just not as good as I'd hoped. It had a wonderful appearance and a nice smokey/roasted taste, followed by a truly delightful chocolaty aftertaste. But it was a bit thin in the mouthfeel department for me. I guess after some of the wonderful American micro brewed stouts I've tried, I'm just partial to a """bigger""" beer."
"Fast becoming one of my favorite beers, I am looking to try this on nitro-tap."
"Poured from a classic brown Young's bottle with the purple label, it's very dark brown, almost black. The head was minimal at the beginning and gone after a few sips. The aroma is mostly chocolate with just a hint of ripe fruit. The taste is quite chocolatey but somewhat on the bland side: inoffensive but not outstanding in any way. The mouthfeel seemed slightly thin for a stout. If looking for a chocolate stout, I'd pick Rogue over this any day of the week."
"Black in color, almost opaque, big foamy tan head. Chocolate is first to the nose, slight fruit scent. Taste is wonderful, bittersweet chocolate and chocolate -- the lable doesn't lie -- but there is some complexity there. Great dessert. And sum-mooth, oh my. This is becoming a staple in my diet and the taste really grows on you. It's my comfort beer."
"One of the best nitro stouts that I've ever had. A rich and delicious chocolate make this a real treat. Quite good, and certainly one that I'll have again!!"
"I'd be very hesitant to call this strictly a desert beer, as it would go well with hearty meals too. It's very drinkable and will probably find a permanent home in my fridge."
"This is one of my favorite beers. As the title suggests, its a dark, warm chocolate malty beer. Pouring it into the glass, a tan/ brown head rises graciously to the top of the glass, leaving plenty of lacing as it generally runs down into the glass forming a dark black beer. At first taste, this beer might seem too sweet, especially for non-stout drinkers. However, the aftertaste has just the right balance of hops to make this otherwise 'all malt' flavor very drinkable. Although it is a very heavy beer, it is easy to down about three of these...especially since the ABV is pretty low."
"Notes: My favorite beer period, and I'm sure there are tons of better beers out there, but I haven't tried them yet. Heh. This is an awesome beer to introduce to people who think that Budweiser is the be all and end all of beers, even people who hate beer love this stuff."
"Pours a midnight black with light tan head. First thought with the aroma was mint chocolate chip ice cream in a glass. Further aroma noted was some light roasted coffee notes and touch of hop profile. First taste was milk chocolate with a little bit of roasted coffee taste. Definitely real chocolate in there. Mouthfeel is good but the chocolate somewhat detracts from the other flavors that are in there. Simply too sweet for my palate but I'm sure it is the classic example of this style."
"An additional note: I've had this in both bottle and can form and personally feel that this stout is better from the can. Not only do you get the nitro charge, but the taste out of the can is better."
"Creamy, Smooth, and Rich feel. Incredibly drinkable, especially after a day of shoveling snow."
"Poured a deep black with a hint of light coming through here and there. Nice frothy head that held and laced well. Aroma was not released until the beer warmed a bit. I then could smell rich chocolate and roasted malts. Hops were present but barely detectable. Taste was roasted chocolate and coffee and a nice hop finish. Beer was a lot thinner than I had imagined. This is very drinkable stout and not as intimidating as one might think."
"Highly Drinkable."
"Young's Double Chocolate Stout is a pretty good version. I'll definitely have it again. Note to self: next time, let it warm to near room temperature for maximum enjoyment."
"Tastes smoky and creamy. Smooth and milky with underlying sweet chocolate flavors. Milk chocolate is what I am tasting. Slightly bitter as it warms. A dry finish and the bitterness lingers after the swallow. easy drinking for a stout. Very smooth and sweet. A really good stout and that's always a good thing."
"ng"
"Notes: Far from the """decadently""" or """sickly""" sweet after-dinner beer some would make it out to be; highly drinkable and well-balanced."
"This beer is rapidly moving up my favorite beer rankings. Its so very easy to drink and goes great with a variety of desserts. A superb beer."
"A good beer that I am glad that I finally got the chance to try. Maybe I was expecting too much from this brew, but it let me down a little. Don't get me wrong, I'll buy this beer again now that it is regularly available here in Wichita. But it really didn't bowl me over like I was expecting it to. The mouthfeel was lacking and the flavor had too much tartness for this type of beer."
"I have paired this brew with vanilla ice cream and coffee very nicely as a dessert. It is a very good brew to convert non beer drinkers."
"Although not one of my all-time favorites, this stout ranks high on my list. The flavors, scents, and textures are right. This beer needs a kick of hops or something to make it truly incredible. Hand the recipe to Larry Bell and he would make it perfect. Just my opinion."
"Good with pastries, etc. Not the cloying chocolate of some similar beers."
"This was definitely not what I expected. I expected a lot of chocolate but did not find that. I got a lot of burnt coffee flavors and some sweet malt but no chocolate. It wasn't even in the nose. The apperance was wonderful. Nice Head and dark color. Drinkablity was not very good since the flavor was off. It had an almost metallic taste that really turned me off."
"One of my bigger disappointments in tasting new beers. Color was ok small head malt aroma, with the smallest hint of chocolate. Taste was about the same, and that started drying out pretty quick. I would never have guessed this was a chocolate beer, let alone a double.In addition to that, it seemed highly charged with carbonation.I had two bottles of this and both were the same."
"Drinkability: Quite intriguing, but not for me. The """real dark chocolate""" both enhances and takes away from this one IMO."
"Classic nitro pour with a huge, lasting tan cascade that settled atop a viscous looking black body. Smell was a cross between sweet creme and the inside of a chocolate chip package. So much sweetness. The taste was astounding. It was like drinking a carbomb without worrying about the alcohol at all. It had huge flavors of caramel drizzled cappucino, extra sweet chocolate milkshake, no astringent grains at all. This was pure velvet and a perfect after dinner drink. Drinkability is a little low as the amount of this I could drink is very small before I develop a major cavity."
"Drinkability: Smoothness and low ABV make for an easy session. If I had the bucks, I'd make a long winter evening of it - this is just an outstanding chocolate stout!"
"s.d."
"Dark as motoroil, definitely darker than their oatmeal stout. Nice thick cream colored head. Its got a kind of coco powder and roasted barley smell to it. Wow, it really is chocolaty. I had this one on tap a couple of months ago and couldn't taste any. This is like the Godiva of beers, silky smooth (nitrogen) and creamy milk chocalate goodness. Doesn't have any bitterness to it, making it that much more drinkable. This in one fine beer, so smooth and rich. It has more flavor than the oatmeal stout that I just drank. You might not want to drink this right after a big meal, but thats about the only bad thing I can say about it."
"pours black and thick with the beautiful cascade action. smells of chocolates roasted goodness. big chocolate taste, slightly sweet and very creamy. balanced and delicious, very smooth and tastey. its a deadly combo. i prefer the can over the bottle, and it isnt too expensive for a high quality brew being 1.99 a bottle/can or 6 bucks a 4 pack. good stuff!"
"there is one other thing this beer is good for in addition to drinking. i make mud cake with this in it and let me say, it rocks!"
"Black color, a medium sized cascading head. Aroma is chocolaty. Nice a chocolaty. Like drinking a chocolate milkshake, except it a beer. The sweetness of the chocolate malts is intensified by the additions of real dark chocolate. Sweet and malty, yet there is some hop bite. Very smooth, creamy tasting stout. Great desert beer, or a great stout on a cool winter evening. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Sampled this last evening at a local restaurant. Big chocolate looking head and aroma, roasted malt and some English hops. I liked this one alot due to its somewhat unusual taste compared with my usual standbys (I.E - Victory Storm King, SN, etc.) Very malty and semi sweet - very tasty and bold. Hints of dark roasted malt and chocolate all over. Goes down so easily it's scary. Be warned - this one will quickly become one of your standbys if you are into stouts. A fine example of the style. Nice semi-dry finish, leaving you wanting more. Hmm, I think I'll have another one real soon! :)"
"Poured from that hardy 500 ml Young's embossed brown bottle, it is a velvet pitch black, creamy tan head that gracefully falls down to a thin cap. Nose is of powdered cocoa and baker's chocolate, with a foundation of roasted malt goodness. Flavour is a silky combination of chocolate and roasted malt, no more or less. Creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable, it will cure whatever ails you. Probably the easiest way I've ever known to convert nearly anyone over to stouts or beer in general. There are angels in heaven earning their wings from the production of this double chocolate stout."
"Pours a nice black (red comes through when held up to light) with a lovely thick rocky/frothy tan head. The very persistent head leaves lacing behind on the glass and greets the mouth in taking a drink. As expected from the name a fairly strong aroma of chocolate malt comes forth as the glass is raised. Tastes of chocolate malt with some very pleasant sweetness--not overly sweet as one might expect from """double chocolate", but well balanced. Some flavors of """roasting""" are also present. This is a very smooth beer which feels slightly oily in the mouth. While not a beer for consuming following working outside or perhaps even on a hot summer day, it is highly drinkable as an after dinner desert type beer, and is an outstanding accompaniment to """Chocolate Cream Oreos"""."
"Nitro can pour black with a creamy head looks good. Smells of chocolate and some roast malt. Taste is exceptional with a sweet maltiness subdued by a somewhat bitter coco chocolaty flavor. The malt sweetness and the bitter chocolate are balanced perfectly with the chocolate taste coming out as the winner. Almost like drinking a cold hot chocolate without all the sugar and some alcohol dropped in to boot. Smooth and creamy this beer could be enjoyed all day."
"Ya cant miss the purple lable."
"The aromas that came from the glass were of roasted chocolate, roasted coffee, dark chocolates, cocoa powder, and had some musty appeal to it as well. The tastes were creamy and rich. Flavors of chocolate milk hit me first, then slowly the roasted coffee came to the front, as well as some bitter hops and bitter chocolate, then roasted and slightly burnt chocolate came in as well as roasted dark malts, I also detected some faint fruits in the back of the throat, but taste was mostly dominated by chocolate and coffee - roasted. The aftertaste was on the bitter side – coffee and chocolate and slightly dry. This beer was light to medium bodied. Over all a good combination of sweet, roasted, creamy flavors in one glass. I really enjoyed this beer, and it represents its style well. Only thing I would have liked to see in this beer, is more body, alittle thicker. I would definitely get again, plus I like the idea that it is in a can, so that it can go almost anywhere."
"Pours a dark brown with a creamy white head. The initial smell of chocolate hits right before taking that first sip, already bringing a smile to my face. The head tastes just as creamy as it looks. The slightly sweet cream is then followed by a bittersweet chocolate that works very well together. I had a tough time keeping it in my mouth due to the big goofy smile this beer put on my face. To much fun to drink."
"Black in color with a nice size head that has a cascading effect. Both the aroma and taste is all chocolate. The mouthfeel is very thick and it actually has a way of coating the mouth with chocolate. I'm not a big fan of using chocolate in beer, but this is outstanding."
"A nice stout."
"A fun beer."
"It feels crisp and watery with a fine drinkability. I like this stout but not on a regular basis."
"And I did...over, and over, and over...."
"An excellent Beer! Its thick and dark with a big brownish head that hangs around throughout the pint. The aroma is inviting with its sweet, chocolately , coffee aroma. It has a nice sweetness that complements the robust chocolatiness of this stout. Once the sweetness wears off there is a nice bitter aftertaste from the hops that seemed almost non-existant during the beginning of the sip."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick light tan head. The nose is of chocolate malts and not much else. The taste is good. There is a good balance between base and specialty grains. The chocolate taste is present, but not overpowering. The thick head adds a creamy finish. The mouthfeel is great. This is a medium bodied beer and a real drinker. An excellant stout."
"What a great looking beer. Big head but not out of control and a dark chocolaty appearance (hence the name). Taste is dominated by chocolate (name, again). But other flavors are there. I detect roasted grains in it along with a decent amount of hops. It seems thin for a stout but it is also creamy which I like. A good beer for dessert or any time a chocolate craving hits."
"Dark black beer poured with a nice head that subsided quickly. Aroma is very mild with roast malt and chocolate the most apparent. Taste is very intriguing yet seems to lack the luxury the label proclaims. Rich chocolate with roast barley and a touch of hops, this beer should be on nitro to showcase the flavors. For the bottled version the carbonic acid produced by artificial carbonation fights the smoothness and makes this a rougher beer than it should be."
"This stout poured from nitro-tap a jet black color with creamy, light brown foam that coated the glass. The smell was a modest but distinct dark malt with a hint of chocolate. The taste was lightly sweet malt with some chocolate and cocoa, and a low hop presence. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-full body and low carbonation and a dry finish. This was a very nice stout."
"Tastes of burnt grain, fruity hops, and a chocolatey finish. A bit perfume like as well."
"This nice stout pours out of the nitro can a light brown color, but fades to an opaque black color as the head slowly builds like a reverse waterfall. Atop it is a 1/2 inch creamy tan head. It has a nice chocolate aroma. Its a very smooth, creamy tasting beer, with loads of roasted chocolate flavors. This is a damn good beer."
"A very nice chocolaty aroma arose from my pour of a brown head full of large bubbles and a opaque dark brown body that left a clinging lacing as it receded down the side of my glass. Ultra smooth initial taste followed by a mild chocolaty sweet aftertaste. It was extremely smooth and very much to my liking. Wow"
"Don't plan on tossing back a lot of these. Its really more a desert beer. Best to open this one at cellar temperature. I had mine in the fridge. When I opened it, it still hadn't warmed up to the right temperature yet, and took until mid-glass for the flavor to be appreciable. It had a nice tan head with good lacing. Not much scent beyond dark malt (it was still a little too cold.By mid glass, you could notice a chocolaty scent in the background). Creamy mouthfeel, as one would expect with this kind of beer. When warmed up to proper temp, has a nice toasty malt flavor and there is a very tasty chocolate flavor in the background and in the aftertaste. There was a hop presence, but it is relatively subtle. Reccomended after a nice, satisfying meal."
"I like this beer, I happen to like Rogue's chocolate offering better."
"This is as close to a candy bar as beer could be. Not much in the way of bitterness, and the mouthfeel is a bit watery. For overall effect, this is a bit thin for a stout. On the other hand, the taste is excellent, and the drinkability high. If you like 'em sweet, this will do."
"Originally sampled on 3 May 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. Thiss starts out w/ all the right intentions, but disappoints at the end. It starts w/ a nice chocolate nose, tan head w/ a dark body and some up front chocolate flavor, but finishes a bit thin an watery. The body of this beer is too thin to make it work."
"Sidebar: Blended 60/40 with New Glarus Raspberry Tart: A reddish black brew with purple head appear. Aroma is Raspberry with hints of coffee and chocolate. The full body supports a chocolate covered raspberry flavor that finishes with sweet roasted malt. To make a dessert beer better- fruit + chocolate= delicious. Highly worth the effort."
"Smuggled a couple pint bottles into Utah two weeks ago, and finally drank one last night. Had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed! Pours a dark brown with a medium creamy tan head. Smell is dominated by chocolate [shocker]. Wow. A little too cold to start with; not much carbonation. Taste is also dominated by chocolate and sweet roasty goodness. Very smooth--exceptionally smooth. Surprisingly drinkable for a such a sweet, chocolatey beer. I could drink a few pints of this. I would love to try this on tap. One of my favorite stouts, but not quite as good as the Kalamazoo and the many imperials I love."
"This stout pours a deep brown, almost black color with a creamy tan head that settles into a small ring. The nose features notes of caramel, roasted malt, and surprisingly, chocolate. As the beer warms up, the taste is divine, albeit somewhat one-dimensional. Dark chocolate is the main event here, although notes of caramel, cream and sugar run their courses, as well. Drinking this is almost reminiscent of sipping a chocolate malt. The feel is incredibly smooth and velvety. Only minimal carbonation is present here, and it's hard to detect. For a stout with so much chocolate character, I thought this might be too much to handle, but upon review, it's quite drinkable, and a real treat overall. Luxurious, indeed."
"This beer was a true treat! It was a creamy beer and went down very smooth. The taste was exceptional and lasted all the way through the drink. The chocolate flavor added a lot to the beer. I'd drink it again anytime. The price wasn't too bad for the size of the bottle."
"A most drinkable stout..very nice stuff indeed."
"I had to put my two cents in as far as this beer is concerned (with respect to the nitro can.) This is one of my favorite beers, belittled by the medium in which it is served. The draught can version of this classic stout, has far less character than the bottled version, so much in fact that I would recommend it as a baby step up from guiness. I tried this twice at my local pub to be resolute in my decision--I am. Try this in bottle long before you bother with the nitro can. I respect the physics of the nitro can and belive it should be reserved for guiness and mass-marketed english pub ales."
"Pours a deep dark brown, with a frothy head that lingers and leaves delicate lace on the side of the glass. The aroma of chocolate and malt dominate. The taste! Now this one goes down smooth with just the right combination of hops, malt, & chocolate, with just a hint of sweetness in the finish. One of the best stouts i've had."
"I had this in a .5L bottle poured into a Young's pint glass. The color is a deep black with a nice 1 finger of tan head. After a few minutes, the head dies down a bit. There is a tad bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is a delicate mix of chocolate and roasted coffee. The taste is a bit chocolatey in the middle of the tongue, with only a small bit of hops in the back. There is a bit of a coffee taste to the finish. The mouthfeel is a little bit soft for a stout. The drinkability is pretty good for a stout though. This really makes a great dessert beer!"
"What an awsome stout this is. Beautiful dark choco-brown body with tight fluffy beige head. Smell is immediately chocolate and roasted malt. Smooth as silk on the palate and clings to the inside of your mouth. Taste is bitter chocolate with hop overtones. This is by far one of my favorite stouts."
"Cool cascading effect. Very smooth and tasty with a creamy head. This pours a very dark color with a small head and moderate lacing. The chocolate is very evident in the flavor - which I love. I would like to have this beer again and again because it is so drinkable and smooth. I love it."
"Pours to a dark brown color with ruby highlights. It forms a thick, creamy, light brown head that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma just hits you with a huge fudge, dark chocolate smell. There is a bit of roasty malt and alcohol in the end. The flavor is wonderful, with a bit of roastiness up front, then quickly you are hit wit the sweet, dark chocolate flavor. This is a full-bodied beer with smooth, silky texture, and a dry bitterness in the finish. I found this to be an excellent beer. Would be great with desserts."
"This beer pours a clear very, very dark reddish brown with a very creamy (luxurious?) moderately large tan head. The mouthfeel is very silky and oily- quite nice. The smell is a tempting chocolate and roasted malts. The taste is very pleasant chocolate and roasted malt with a very mild hoppy finish. This is a very enjoyable stout that makes a wonderul drink after a meal yet I could probably(though I have never tried) drink it all night. One of my all time favorites."
"(I've had it in the nitro-can, too, and it was not enhanced by that gimmick!)"
"I could drink this for a while as long as I didn't stick my nose in it to smell it...overall ok...not bad...but not great"
"Color of this yummy chocolate is deep, brown, almost black like a dark chocolate candy. Nice tan head, frothy foam about a finger high, fades a little leaving patchy lace. Smells of very sweet and rich chocolate with a nice creamy lightness, notes of ginger spice and nuts. Taste echoes the smell, its got a good amount of chocolaty flavor thats sweetly bitter but not overbearing. It stays nice and silky smooth the whole way through with a good chocolatey twinge thats quite nice in the finish and feel. Some faint notes of hop presence and ginger and is medium to heavy bodied. This is a great stout for having around Halloween and the winter Holidays when everyone starts eating more sweets. Super yummy stuff."
"Overall, it was definitely an intensely enjoyable experience. The chocolate was pleasantly present in both the aroma and taste, without overpowering the malts. After a few bottles, I've come to enjoy it even more. This beer has entered my regular rotation as one of my favourites, and I expect it'll stay there for quite some time."
"This is such a great and complex stout. Pours a deep, dark brown color with about a 1-inch head. The head slowly fades down leaving a nice, sticky lace on the glass. Aromas are full of roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. The taste complements the aroma perfectly. Theres a slight bitterness upon first taste, but it matched exquisitely with the roasted malts and chocolate. This beer is exceptionally smooth, creamy, and easy to drink. It's absolutely delicious."
"Feels nice and creamy in the mouth. Very drinkable, just not too many at once. I'll be getting a sixer next since the one I tried was just a pint bottle."
"Black (actually very dark ruby) with a good tan head and nice lacing. Aroma is all chocolate and roasted malts. When you expect something cloyingly sweet (chocolate in beer - """uff da"""!): Surprise! - a perfectly rounded and well balanced flavour, loads of chocolate but never sickly, just the right roasted bitterness in the aftertaste. This beer is a real treat - I would be happy to drink it each and every afternoon, but just one bottle a day!"
"Pour is deep black, large medium brown head, slowly diminishes to leave good lacing. Aroma is strong on the chocolate, and some roasted malts in the back. Flavor starts almost like hot chocolate, ends with some mild roasted bitter maltiness. Body is full and strong. Not something I would drink every night, but quite a tasty brew."
"Eh, this was ok. The look was great, the smell was great. Then there was the taste. There was no taste what so ever. I got nothing out of this. Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but I was very disappointed. It was kind of waterd down tasteing, but had some hints of maltiness. Other than that, I don't have anything else to say."
"Very deep dark reddish brown appearance poured from an equally dark and beautifully shaped and labeled bottle. No head to speak of, but what little was there was tan and thin. This is a very chocalately beer as would be expected from its name. The label boasts silky smooth, rich and creamy, and that is no overstatement. This is very rich beer with a clean chocolate sense in both taste and smell. The unexpected finish comes from a strong final rush hop bitterness. Much less than expected aftertaste. We drank this after a nice meal and found it to be a perfect desert finish to the evening. Surprisingly enjoyable after an initial sense of being too sweet."
"Taste: Again the roasted malt flavor and a bit bitter after taste. Some coffie flavors did come out but I was hoping for more of a chocolate, roasted flavor. Not bad in taste but nothing worth buying again. It did go down smooth. Over all a O.K stout. After reading the other reviews, maybe I had a bad bottle. I will try it again to be fair."
"On another happy note though, my father-n-law enjoyed it. What does that mean? Well to put it bluntly he's a """Bud-man""". I try to get him to taste beers with me but he normally sticks to the norm. Maybe with this there will be some hope!"
"Youngs Double Chocolate Stout: A deep black stout. The head is tan, not very tall but thick and long lasting. The aroma is very slight, it takes a lot and huffing and puffing to get a sense of the beer. The chocolate taste is there, but to me this beer is dominated by a smoky, almost burnt malt taste. Not as smooth as others of the style I’ve had, with some prickly carbonation. The aftertaste is there, but not a whole lot different than the first sip. Not worth the price I paid."
"Easier to drink than water, and if I could breathe it, I probably would. It's extreme chocolate flavor is it's savior and it's lone problem. There are simply times when chocolate doesn't go with what you're eating or times when it gets a little too sweet for taste. But make no mistake. This is one of the better chocolate stouts available."
"A creamy dark beige nitro head sits regally upon an opaque dark brown/ black throne, and refuses to abdicate all the way down to the bottom of the glass. The aroma is dark roasted malt, with a hint of sweetness. The taste is a Solomon-like balance of dark malt and semi-sweet chocolate, with fleeting notes of cherry, raspberry, and burnt metal. The head leaves clingy tendrils down the glass as you drink. As it warms, expresso flavors join the malt and chocolate. Mouthfeel is thin, almost watery, with little carbonation. Some other reviewers think this brew is too sweet or gimmicky, but I am not one of them. One of my current favorites!"
"Personal notes: I expected this to be too sweet for my liking but I was pleasantly surprised. There is nothing really in excess here but rather lots of flavor in the right amounts."
"I already reviewed the bottle. This can obviously makes the nitro cascading effect and a wonderful thick off-white head. The liquid is opaque. This stout is so super smooth. I yearned for stronger chocolate in the bottle, and I yearn for it here too. The bottle seemed to have more overall flavor in it. This can seems kind of bland in a way. But it's not bad by any means. Nothing about this beer is """strong""". And that is definitely a plus when it comes to drinkability. I could easily and probably will drink the three other cans right after this one."
"A great stout to have with desert - or AS desert."
"The smell is rich of chocolate (of course :p), coffee and raisins. After the first sip I noticed it had a pleasant bitterness in it too, not TOO surprising was it? :) The sweetness is not overpowering either, it's very balanced in this matter. The most significant tastes is chocolate and coffee. Very thick pleasant mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Since this is such a well-balanced beer, it is very drinkable. The combination of the chocolate bitterness and the alcohol complement each other nicely. Overall, just a notch below the Imperial Stouts in my book."
"Love the look of a black stout as it settles, and this brew does that nicely. Thick tan shaving cream head and deep brown black body. The smell, not surprisingly, is of chocolate. What is different about this chocolate brew and others is that neither the smell nor the flavor goes overboard with the chocolate. The other noticeable characteristic in both flavor and smell was malt, again not over powering in either. The only weekness for this brew is in its mouthfeel - I like a stout to feel thick in the mouth, and this brew seemed slightly on the watery side. This, however, is overall a very drinkable and solid stout."
"Cheers"
"This is a terrific chocolate stout. I find myself thinking of this beer often and can remember its chocolaty flavor days later. It reminds me so much of chocolate milk that I forget I'm drinking a stout."
"Pours black with some ruby highlights. Has a thin but persistent head that leaves a fair amount of lace on my glass. Aroma is rich and malty, with an abundance of chocolate... almost smells like malted ovaltine. Flavor is a wonderful mixture of malty sweetness and slightly bitter chocolate... very smooth and rich. Hops play a role of balance... barely noticeable, but doing thier job. Has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and is full bodied. An excellent dessert beer."
"A Guinness with some chocolate flavoring is my overall impression. Nothing fancy for a stout, but drinkable on a cold winter night."
"Pours a somewhat opaque dark brown to black. Nice brown head. I detect dark roasted malts and chocolate in the aroma. Smells like chocolate milk with alcohol. Taste is not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated. Tastes much more like dark bitter chocolate although some milk chocolate sweetness is present. Malt sweetness is well balanced by the hops although the sweetness edges out the bitterness in this battle. Good mouthfeel. Not overly sweet with good drinkability (I'd actually like to see a little more sweet milk chocolate flavor in this one). Overall, a good beer."
"Vertical pour of this slightly less than ruby red/jet-black liquid forms a beautiful yeasty thick meringue pancake of a head. Beautiful to watch the downpour of thin bubbles sheet down the glass. Low on carbonation (or should I say nitrogenation), as most nitrocanned ales are. Aroma is suprisingly close to Guinness nitrocan, with an added dose of sweet milk chocolate. Mmmm...velvety smooth texture, amazingly rich pillow-soft mouthfeel, crisp clean finish with a hint of grain, freshly shelled walnuts and cocoa powder. Hops are only there to balance, never becoming intrusive. The only downside to this heavenly brew is the subtle metallic and cardboard notes in the aftertaste. These become more prominent as the brew warms, but don't really become a bother. Thank god they are only subtle, for this brew is highly drinkable."
"Pours an almost black color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that fades into a nice sticky lace that coats the sides of the glass while drinking. Nose is fresh coffee, sweet roasted malts, and milk chocolate. Smooth, creamy, thick, and chewy in the mouth with tastes of bitter dark chocolate and a sweet maltiness. A very nice stout that goes great with dessert."
"Pretty nice pour. Deep brown, almost black in color with a dense velvety mocha colored head. The head hangs in at about 1/4 inch and doesn't change until I drink it up at the end of the glass. Smells like Bailey's Irish Creme--chocolate milk with an alcohol kick. Tastes of semi-sweet chocolate, some malt character too. As the beer warms closer to room temperature, the tastes intensify a little. Mouthfeel was pretty thin for such a rich looking brew and carbonation is low. A good dessert beer."
"It was incredibly silky in the mouth, a real pleasure to drink. The beer was more like chocolate soda or Yoo-hoo then I remember. The last time I had this one was early in my days of drinking good beer. It seems my memory of this one are better than the real thing, but thats fine with me. This was still a different, enjoyable stout."
"I recently tried Rogue's Chocolate Stout and was really impressed, however this one blew that out of the water. The main reason for this was probably the nitro charger in the can which gave the beer a """icecream-ish""" mouthfeel, and also lended to quite a show while waiting for the head to form in the glass (which remained the entire time and was very creamy). Definite chocolate taste, especially in the beginning. Slight bitterness showing towards the end but overall quite a treat. As one user described Rogue's stout as """chocolate milk for adult""" I would describe this as the chocolate shake for adults."
"Pours almost completely black with just hints of ruby/amber on the edges. A substantial foamy, tan head with some lacing. The smell is dominated by creamy chocolate scents with a hint of underlying roasted notes. Taste is quite sweet throughout the drink, starting rather light-textured and even a bit hoppy. A rich taste of chocolate truffles comes through toward the end, culminating with some dryness. As in the smell, roasted grains are present but somewhat muted. The light but rich taste and dry finish lends itself to a nice mouthfeel and a better-than-average drinkability for a stout."
"Double chocolate? It has chocolate, but I always want more. Beautiful black body and chocolate aroma. Taste is rich and smooth chocolate with just a little bitterness at the end. One isn't enough, I'd like another."
"The nitro can version of this stout was purchased along with the bottle for comparison and review. There was a distinct difference in taste with the nitro can version. There was much less of the luxurious mouthfeel with a nice chocolate taste. The can version was good in its own right but drier and of course, more like a pub poured pint. It also seemed less complex in flavors."
"The archetypal stout color Ebony, the head planetary in size, creamy texture and the lace fine sticky sheets to cling to the glass, a nice light chocolate color for both. The aroma of coffee, toasted grains, chocolate and sweet, as can be, quite a pleasure. Start is sweet, the top thick and chewy, the finish passably acidic, the hops pertinent to the style, dry long lasting aftertaste, and a World Class Stout in my book."
"You can smell chocalate and really taste it with the first sip. Great not real sweet some hops in the finish. """Velvety""" smooth, with a nice creamy silky feel on the palate, very chocolatey but not overdone, this is a wonderful stout, I always enjoy it."
"Smooth, creamy and silky. What a great stout. Not an overpowering chocolate flavor as it does not come until the end. Very dark in color with a beautiful tan head that lasts and lasts. I am sure that this would be even better on tap. A bit dry in the middle but evens out in the end. This is one that I will go back to."
"This is a very black beer. There is a 1/4 inch of creamy, tan head. The aroma is dominated by cocoa and roasted malts. This beer tastes just as it claims to be, Chocolate, Chocolate, and more Chocolate. Its almost like drinking a chocolate silk pie. Very rich, but not sweet. This is a light bodied beer for a stout. Nice lace goes down the bottle. I could drink quite a few of these."
"Just the name of this beer makes you want to drink it. Luxury Double Chocolate Stout pours a deep brown colour topped by a dark tan head. The aroma of this beer consists of chocolate malts. Taste couldn't be anything else but chocolaty. Chocolate malts dominate the taste. Excellent, luxurious brew"
"I'd say that this is a complex yet polite stout. It would make a most excellent choice for a dessert beer with its pleasant, """chocolate cake""" after taste."
"This beer is enjoyable and Id recommend it and drink it again (most likely)."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a white/tan head, aroma of dark roasted malt.  Nice malt flavors with chocolate and caramel tones, a little bit of hops.  A very good stout.  I would recommend this as a very solid stout."
"Pours black as night, no light can come through. Big creamy tan head that heaves wispy lacing all the way down. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Some sweetness that goes with a slightly burnt/roasted flavor. Big chocolate flavour, not milk chocolate but dark. Some hop flavor to balance the malt with a slight hint of licorice. Finishes slightly dry. Very easy to drink. Incredible."
"The stout pours inky black with a moderate tan head that lingers and then drops back to a generous collar on the inside of the glass.  The aroma is mild chocolate, from both the chocolate malt used and the actual chocolate added to the beer.  The taste is smooth and silky chocolate with a slight hop bite in the finish to balance the wonderful sweet flavors in the beer.  This is a highly drinkable specialty stout for cooler temperatures and when you are looking for a beer to sip and enjoy."
"Just love the way the nitro-can beers seem to have the head cascade down through the beer and back up to the top.  The head on this beer takes well over a minute to settle out from the nitro can, and it stays thick and creamy throughout the entire time you drink it.  When it is too cold, there is very little flavor.  As it warms, the chocolate and earthy hops aromas arise.  The flavor exhibits a bitter, dark chocolate or cocoa taste with roasted malt and a very thin yet creamy mouthfeel.  It has a nice bitterness on the finish with a hint of sweetness and that dark chocolate note.  A good beer with not as much chocolate as I presumed it would have, which is a good thing."
"Beautiful chocolate beer here. Just made for a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Not sweet, except for a supple slither of alcohol sweetness in the mid-palate. The chocolate is of the Hershey's cocoa variety. Who can argue with chocolate in their stout? Especially when it isn't over done..."
"Tried this beer three time and have been dissapointed every time. I could not taste anything to do with Double Chocolate or infact, any kind of chocolate flavor or aroma. It was lacking in just about everything. Is there something I'm missing? Just a blah brew! Where's the chocolate? Double!"
"This is really good stout. Very rich appearance, nice head and less milky than other stouts. A strong cocoa aroma sets the drinker up for the chocolate and toffee flavors that this stout is named for. Very smooth, glides across the palate. This is great all around stout for die-hard fans or first timers."
"Outstanding head … all canned nitro brews are like this right? Smells of powdered hot chocolate, hint of alcohol, kiss of roasted grain and some sweetness. This pretty much goes the same for the flavour but add a vague fruitiness, a bitter twang from the hops and roasted malt, and a remarkable smoothness. I prefer this on tap so much more but this is not too bad."
"Great color, that's the first thing I noticed. So dark it's black, with a great head, tannish white, about an inch, that stays almost to the bottom. A true bishop's collar. Just a light presence of malt and chocolate in the aroma. A little more noticeable in the taste. Lace throughout, with a pretty good finish. A good example of the style, much more enjoyable than a Guiness."
"This pours with a nice looking tan head over deep, deep brownish-red liquid. Nose is predominately roasted malts with some tanginess noted. Taste is roasty, a bit of chocolate, and slight coffee notes. Not as full-bodied as I had hoped for...but nice nonetheless. Finishes a bit more chocolaty than malty, no real hop flavors come to the front. A nice beer, but that's about it."
"black as night with a delicious chocolate aroma. goes down rich and smooth just like a stout should with a creamy goodness. then you get a blast of chocolate that just hits the spot."
"There's a real danger of over-doing it on the sweetness in a drink like this, but Young's managed to balance out this beer quite nicely.  The chocolate is wonderful, and something you won't find in many other beers, but the body is fairly light (perhaps a bit too light for a stout) and the finish is dryer than one would expect.  Perhaps a bit thin for something billed as a luxury double chocolate stout, but it works!  Very drinkable."
"I was looking forward to this beer all night.  I have been looking for a good solid robust stout for a long time and I figured Young's wouldn't let me down.  Was I ever right.  The deep dark color and thick foamy lasting head were the introduction I was yearning for.  The first taste of this heavy bodied brew was just liquid heaven.  The smooth roasted tootsie roll chocolate flavor is jsut what I was hoping for and made my day.  The mellow latent bitterness helps balance out the sweet to create a fantastic stout."
"Toasted, but not so intensive. You can found in the smell the chocolate... but you must drink it for tasting the real soul of this beer! Dark and bitter chocolate. The smell is not particular as taste, but when you drink it, you can find the same flavour of the taste. Pure chocolate! Great!"
"After looking for a while, I finally found myself a good chocolate stout. And this one is quality. The appearance is what you would expect, black with an enormous brown fluffy head. For some reason, I found the smell to be a bit off, and IMO it certainly did not fit with the thick sweetness of the beer. This stuff tastes delicious however...the chocolate is clearly present as is a sweet flavor of coffee and vanilla, but none overpower the beer. And its smooth as silk. Oooh mama."
"A local resturant has this beer on their menu, and it's become one of my favorite after-dinner beers.  Pours nearly black with a respectable, lasting head that produces a fair amount of lace.  The taste is very smooth and rich...like fudge.  Unquestionably a desert beer.  Complex and enjoyable, but not for every occation."
"This dark ruby colored brew pours a huge brown head, foamy and rocky.  Aroma is of cocoa bean and java.  You can actually taste the chocolate in this brew (maybe because they actually use real chocolate in the recipe).  Can taste baking chocolate.  Bittersweet is predominant.  Coffee and vanilla bean tones also surface.  Pretty light in body for a stout.  Maybe medium at best.  I used to think more highly of this beer years ago, untill I started getting a taste of what the truly high quality stouts taste like (i.e., Kalamazoo)."
"After a bad experience with Breckenridge's chocolate beer I was a little apprehensive about trying this, but I am glad I did. I can't wait to try the bottled version! This had the perfect hint of chocolate in my opinion. The coloration was also perfect and conveyed what to expect in the flavor exactly. This is a great example of bold flavor with subtle accents to make a great brew."
"While stouts are not my fav. type of brew I loved this one.  From the dark brown appearance and thick foamy head, to the sweet choc. aroma.  Had a good mouthfeel and I can see why they call it double choc.so smooth and sweet tasting.  Great color of cans also Clemson colors (orange and purple), try this beer its great..................CHEERS"

"Black with moderate tan head.  The aroma was of coffee and chocolate.  The flavor was more of roasted coffee and the chocolate faded to the background.  As the beer warms, the chocolate flavor lessens and becomes more roasty with maltiness coming through.  A good stout, although I do not like it as well as my drinking buddy Bigemail."
"Very deep, opaque brown/black color with a thick tan head that holds up well and gives some nice Belgian-lace. The aroma is of a slightly sweet dark malt like bittersweet chocolate. The medium body and restrained carbonation level give a soft, creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is very lightly sweet with just a touch of roastiness against a light bitterness. Well balanced but somewhat lacking in character for it - not very much punch. The finish is light and leaves a pleasant, lightly dry and roasty aftertaste. Immensely drinkable. I once felt that I preferred the nitro-can version because it has such a soft, silky-smooth and creamy character, but I now feel that the bottled version is more enjoyable as it appears less sweet and slightly more complex."
"Now we're talking. Great deep dark color, chocolate malt scent. Like a Guiness with Hersheys syrup. I LOVE this beer. Very smooth as well. Not something you want to drink all night but a few do the trick."
"ChocoLOT man!  Dude, where's my chocolate.  Dude it's in my beer.  Sweet!  Pours a very very dark color (maybe black...but hard to tell in this low light).  The head started out at 2 fingers and with a rather dark color for a head and dissipated fairly quickly.  The smell, well there's definitely chocolate in it.  The taste, well there's definitely chocolate in it..and surprisingly, it is rather good.  It isn't the most balanced beer and as rich as the chocolate is, I would have to stop with this one after a couple or four.  It was a pleasant experience for a change.  Choco-Cheers!"
"I feel like the Grinch on this one. This was a very sweet-tasting beer and reminded me of Guinness with Hershey's syrup mixed in. Great aroma and appearance so I'll score it high there, but the sweetness was a bit overwhelming on the palate. If you like chocolate or sweets, then you might like this as it offers a range of tastes that run the gamut from bitter to sweet."
"By and large, this is one of the best stouts on the market. The chocolate aroma is apparent from the very get-go. The head pours nice and thick and stays there for quite some time. This brew is very smooth, sweet, and and cream-like in its consistency. This is what I like to call a knife-and-fork brew...it is the beer that drinks like a meal. I agree with the Advocate review in that there was a hint of licorice towards the middle of the glass. If you like this brew, and even better, if your wife likes this brew, invest in a case at your local beer emporium, like Shangy's here in Pennsylvania. This is a must-try. Bottoms Up!"
"Frothy tan head. Black body, with just a hint of ruby. Excellent lacing. Wonderful aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, licorice, and a tiny bit of coffee.  A hop tingle joins in the mouth, while the coffee and licorice fade away, but it is the roasted malts and chocolate which dominate the taste. An outstanding dessert beer or nightcap."
"Chocolate anyone.  Downward cascading, interesting to watch.  Dark brown with creamy brown head and lace.  Rich, creamy, chocolate malt. Almost too smooth. The nitro can I had produce a beer that was slightly weak and flat.  Nevertheless it was still delicious."
"inpenetrable black color, big foamy head that died quickly.  nice chocolate malt aroma, like chocolate cake in a bottle.  higher than expected carbonation makes it slightly less smooth than i anticipated.  not very complex in taste, just a slight roasted bitterness on top of a big bittersweet chocolate malt profile.  not too sweet, with a hop bite in the background.  this didn't knock my socks off,  but very solid nonetheless.  especially if you are a fan of chocolate and beer, which i am.  would be delicious as a dessert beer with a hershey bar."
"Just a great beer. I wish I had another one. This could turn me into a chocoholic."
"Although there no real chocolate is used in the making of this flavorful stout, plenty of chocolate malt is. Starting with strong roasted flavors and a good balance of dryness and malt, the chocolate becomes very apparent in the aftertaste."
"I am always on the lookout for good stouts and porters. I am not a big fan of chocolate flavor in a beer, but I still found this to be a good beer. Wonderful dark brown almost black color and a medim tan foamy head, plus an interesting smell of chocolate that was almost overpowering. The body was a bit weaker than I would expect for this type and the flavor was overpowered too much by the chocolate in my opinion. I thing Rogue's version does a much better job of maintaining a balance."
"Lots of chocolate and malt flavours, a good beer from Youngs, which makes up for all there bad ones, quite rich, not too complex, but damn tasty, if you've got a craving for chocolate, look here."
"Another downward cascading """creamer", cool """curly maple""" pattern. Tan head, warm brown beneath, dark brown at the bottom. Chocolate malt (as in the soda fountain drink kind) aroma. Very creamy and slightly chocolatey taste, silky, thick, and malty. Zero hop cut to my tongue. One of my favorite Sweet Stouts but a little limiting when you're seeking out complexity. More non-beer drinkers need to check out brews like this."
"Presentation: Package reviewed was the 14.9 ounce can with the gas generator, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"(bottle version) Jet black with nice tan head that is gone in short time.  Strong chocolate smell apparent upon opening bottle.  Nice chocolate taste.  Very smooth with good mouthfeel.  Chocolate flavors are enhanced as it warms."
"I had this one in the 14.9 oz can with the widget. I thought it was great. Pours deep jet black, with a nice big creamy tan head. The head stayed on mine until the end, falling down the glass perfectly. Big chocolate flavor, didn't really notice much else. Unbelievably smooth and creamy. Remember when Homer Simpson made his deal with the devil, the first of his 3 wishes were """chocolate beer !"""  Well this is it. The smell was average, other than that, this beer gets my highest compliment """magic in a glass.""""
"Pours a very nice black w/ a nice fluffy tan head that doesn't last that long. The aroma as well as the flavors suggest a light fudge creaminess that balances the sweetness out with nice bitter chocolate notes in the finish. Overall a excellent brew!"
"77"
"When held up to light this brew is as dark as a stout can be without being pitch black. It's actually very clear with no haze and exhibits a very deep garnet hue. Beautiful creamy light brown head with excellent retention. Sweet (real!) milk chocolate aroma is nicely combined with a chocolate malt note. The Young's signature yeast pearish fruitiness of course adds to the complexity as well. Medium to full body that is almost oily. Although the aroma may suggest that cocoa may dominate the flavor profile, the combination of real chocolate, chocolate malt, roasted barley dryness and hop bitterness meld well. This is a flavorful stout and is highly drinkable like most of Youngs brews. I do feel, however, that this brew has been dumbened down in the last couple years. It could be my imagination or changing palette. In any case, get it in the bottle. The nitro/ CO2 widget in the can kills the taste."
"On tap. Amazing. Unbelievably creamy and smooth. Delectable and tempting, like candy. A sweet, crisp, milky and wonderfully balanced brew. Alcoholic kick nestled comfortably within the chocolate. Dense head, thick lustrous body like the best the UK has to offer. I got some surprisingly fruity sensations that I couldn't quite identify, but loved anyway. Some beers just make you shake your head and say wow; this was one of those for me. (I later tried the take-home versions. The bottle's good, but the can is a disppointment.)"
"Black opaque color, malty aroma, soft semi-sweet chocolate taste, malty aftertaste.  Full bodied, satisfying and smooth but not great.  I agree with the other reviews that it was like a tasty chocolate milkshake."
"Mmmm..  Gormet chocolates and a bit of roasted nut.  Malty & smooth.  Burnt cocoa flavors balanced with alchohalic notes.  Very filling."
"Young's best stout in my humble opinion.  Great tan head and almost black color.  Roasty, chocolatey smells and flavors with only slight dryness in the finish."
"Smooth and luxurious indeed."
"This is a crazy yummy beer! So damn chocolatey, rich, creamy and smooth ... the complexities are making me drool.  And on top of that it's an outstanding stout. A perfect pairing with any dessert, chocolate or on its own. Now available in cans."
"Make no mistake it is not the Chocolate Barley malt giving it that flavor, they throw in chocolate bars in the boil and add essence after filtering. It is a tasty specialty brew."
"This is a smooooove stout!  Chocolate malt gives this beer the taste of a dessert... that you can begin the night with or end the night with.  Smell strongly of caramel, with a chocolate malt finish.  Medium body.  A delight.  Can't wait to try the Young's Oatmeal Stout!!!"
"I revise my opinion which was given under anonymous previously.  This is the second best stout, giving way only to the incredibly smooth delicious Oatmeal Stout from none other than Youngs. Very pleasing to look at as well as drink. Leaves solid sheets of lace on my Young's glass.  These two beers have made me love winter time.  Love it on a cold winters night after dinner, with chocolate peanut clusters"
"Very rich, almost like a milkshake.  Best as an after-dinner drink."
"Notes: Hands down, and incredible stout and deadly in its drinkability. Unfortunately a bottle goes for about $3-3.50, making it a brew for special occasions."
