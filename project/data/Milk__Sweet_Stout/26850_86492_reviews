"Great milk stout. Has kind of an Imperial taste. Tastes more alcoholic than it is"

"O-great beer with a great mixture of aromas and flavors"
""
"I would call this a chocolate stout before   I would a milk stout.. it's definitely tasty and easy drinking not overly sweet and not complex .. I would recommend this and will buy it again I've really enjoyed their offerings and look forward to finding more of their brews"
"Picked up a growler of this over the weekend. The color was a dark brown, not as thick or as dark as some other milk stouts I have seen. The flavor is sweet, definitely some cocoa taste...but not overly so for the genre in my opinion. Mouthfeel again was not as heavy as many milk stouts, but still smooth as you would hope. I really liked it."

"O- Decent milk stout, but lacking a bit in the milk department. It drinks like a generic stout for the most part. [3.5]"
""
"Overall - Just too sweet."
""

"Pour is black with a good bit of mocha colored head.  Nose has a heavy roasted malt, lots of berry sweetness and residual sugars, a fair bit of vanilla cream, and faint notes of milk chocolate.  Taste has a lighter roast up front, milky vanilla cream, less sugars, a bit cleaner.  Body is very creamy and soft, lower carb, a touch slick and thin."

"Pours a deep black with brown head, some lacing. The nose starts with heavy roast and chocolate along with some cream and mill sugar. Taste starts with considerable sweetness. Notes of cocoa, carob, and heavy roast. Finish has a decent balance. Mouthfeel is medium with somewhat high carbonation. Overall, this is a very straightforward and to style milk stout. Clean flavors, decent roast, and plenty of cream stout sweetness."

"Pours a black color. 1/2 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, slight chocolate, yeast, hint of hop, and alcohol. Fits the style of a Milk / Sweet Stout. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, hops, slight yeast, hint of chocolate, and slight alcohol. Overall, a really good stout, but very little milky sweetness."

"O: Very nice milk stout. I would love to see this in 6 packs and in much wider distribution."

"O: An all around great milk stout. They could really give Left Hand and Duck Rabbit a run for the money if they could get it into regular distribution at a comparable six pack price."

"22 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle date, but was recently released. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, cream, light vanilla, herbal, woodiness, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, lactose, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, cream, light vanilla, herbal, woodiness, and roasted earthiness. Slight herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, dark bread, light vanilla, cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, lactose, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice sweet stout style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, lactose, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Extremely dark brown; appears jet black in the glass. Pours with a HUGE tan head. The head dies down and leaves an uneven layer foam on the surface of the beer and sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Sweet smell with scents of coffee and chocolate. Rich, sweet taste with hints of coffee and malt, and a velvety smooth finish on your tongue. Delicious. Medium body, smooth and velvety mouthfeel. Overall an excellent stout that I would gladly purchase again."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is jet black, with a foamy, tight bubbled, fizzy, tan head that quickly settles out into an uneven surface coating. Aromas of coffee and cream were pouring out of the glass as soon as the beer hit it, and upon further inspection, there is a heavy dose of coffee and cream on the nose, as well as some milk chocolate highlights, and hints of booze. Smells delicious! Flavors are roast forward, with a heavy bitter coffee and baker's chocolate backbone, solid lacto overlay, creamy highlights, and hints of smoke and wood. This is a deep drink, more layered than your typical milk stout. Pleasant and weighty. The body is full, robust, and smooth, with a dry undertone to remind you this is still a stout. The aftertaste is more of the roast and bitter, but hints of cream linger. The finish is smooth, clean, and slightly dry. This is a very well balanced, well put together beer, and it tastes damn good at the same time."

"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch tan head that sticks around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like milk and bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and a bit of vanilla. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some molasses, cream and dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good brew, definitely worth a try if you come across it!"

"Overall this is a very solid stout, but at $18.99 I will never purchase again! I bought this over the phone and had my brother pick it when he was at Redstone Liquors. Didn't bother to ask the abv when he told me that price. Once again good, but wanted to be floored for that price tag."

"Poured dark brown, almost black, body with minimal head and lace patches. Both roasted and milk-like aromas greet my nose as I smell and then same flavors greet my tongue as I drink. I found the beer to be medium-bodied, smooth, even silky, with good balance as the roasted malts are in the background and the beer has a light, not overpowering, milk and milk chocolate like sweetness. With the sweetness being the major taste sensation, not to minimize the other tastes, this might not be a beer for everyone but I really enjoyed it as it pleased my sweet tooth."

"O: An enjoyable brew. True to style and easy drinking."

"Poured into a glass, produced a huge 3-4 fingers of an off white khaki head. Smell up front is smokiness, chocolate, roasted malt and milk sugar sweetness that usually accompanies a milk stout. Taste up front is all smoke. then it starts to mellow out into a nice flavored classic milk stout. Mouth feel was silky smooth, slight carbonation. I'm not sure if this was intended to be a smoked milk stout, but that s the impression I get. Along the lines of there Bo & Luke, only creamier and not barrel aged."
"Easy to drink, an interesting take on the style. Best beer I've had from Kentucky, so far"

"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours nearly pitch black with a thick brown film and healthy ring around the glass leaving lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, lots of chocolate and light coffee, hints of vanilla. Flavor is sweet toasted malt with light lactose, hot cocoa, hints of charred coffee; finishes somewhat thin with pleasant light milky cocoa and a mild hop bitterness. Medium bodied. A nicely made milk stout that starts out rich and creamy, but finishes a bit lighter, but well balanced. Pleasant aftertaste of milky cocoa."

"O: Compared to other milk stouts, the taste of this beer didn't seem to be as sweet and have as much flavors of lactose. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable stout that has nice smoothness in the mouthfeel and a blend of lactose and roasted malt flavors."

"Pitch black with a khaki head. Surprising for a beer this strength. Sweet dark chocolate on the nose with hints of char. The flavor is roasted dominant. With burnt wood flavors and burnt sugar. A lot of chocolate in this beer, very dark and earthy, dry aftertaste reminiscent of coffee. A good bitteerness rom the dark chocolate balances out well. Drinks really easy and has a thick, creamy mouthfeel. Awesome stuff from ATG."
"Overall, a really nice representative of the style. It has all the features one looks for: bitter flavors from the roasted malt and some nice creamy sweetness to balance it out. Hop character is fairly nonexistent. This is about malt and roast. Excellent after-dinner sipper on a chilly evening. I wish it came in 6-packs (instead of pricey bombers)."
"This is a spot on rendition of an English Milk Stout, whether that's your cup of tea or not."
""
"O. I consider this a thin stout. I'm not sure of ABV but it's well hidden if it's high. Great nose and taste. Very coffee forward and smoothed out with the lacto. A session stout."

"Overall- Above average to good, but mostly good. I would give it a try but it falls toward the lower end of all the milk stouts I've had lately. I would probably rather have a Guinness and definitely a Murphy's. Still pretty good though."

"Glad to see Dave is grabbing some of those AtG kegs floating around out there. This one pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of brown foam. The nose comprises darkly-roasted malts, light coffee, and very light dark cocoa powder. Despite the seeming ethereality of some of those elements, things come across rather pleasantly. The taste brings in more of the same, with the roast comeing through a bit milder, the cocoa coming through more powerfully, and a bit of lightly-toasted oats tossed in for good measure. The body is a hefty medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth, nearly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice milk stout, one that AtG somehow managed to not go too crazy with, allowing a tasty beer to shine on its own. Good times."

"Smell is sweet sugary malts. Taste is sweet lacto malts...not much roasted flavor but very sweet and sugar forward. Its very sweet and a definite ""lacto"" flavor is obvious. I like a good sweet stout, but this was VERY sweet...but i guess thats the style. Its a good sweet stout - one is good but its a good one,"
"It seems that I'm quick to detract their more experimental beers because of the unusualness of their creative spirits and the unsettled palate that's then created. Though they didn't go ""against the grain"" here, I kinda miss the game of ""what's new"" in this glass. Perhaps I just need to turn the brain off and simply drink the damn beer!"
