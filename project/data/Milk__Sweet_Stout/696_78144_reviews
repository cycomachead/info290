"O: flavor isn't very complex; aroma is the best part;"
""
"O - Pretty nice chocolate flavor (particularly in the scent) which gets a little overtaken by the roastiness when it comes to the taste, wish it was a little more harmonized there but a solid stout overall."

"Pours a very dark brown with a khaki colored head that was pretty thin. The smell was great with chocolate being the center star and then the earthy scent of truffle started to come through. The taste was heavy with milk chocolate and a bit of vanilla came through strong in the start and then the earthy spices making for a mellow finish. Very good but a little filling to have more than one at a time."
"Strong chocolate aftertaste. Not bad! Thanks, MMA! Love the New England (CT) beers!"

"Super good, great chocolate flavor"

"Hot/milk chocolate is the dominant aroma. Roasted malts, a little smokey/burnt, chocolate ruffled that is present but not over-powering. Finishes with a light body, medium to light carbonation and maybe a light hop bitterness on the aftertaste. Usually not a fan of the Hooker line but this one was tasty and I would buy it again."
"02/20/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Top notch. The bittersweet elements of the chocolate used are fantastic with the sweetness of the stout. Big fan."

"o: A very good chocolate stout. The inclusion of Munson's cocoa adds a nice touch to an otherwise decent stout."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled 12/10/13.Pours near completely black with a half of inch tan head, that leaves behind some webs of lace. Smell is bakers chocolate, coffee, vanilla, biscuit, and caramel. Taste is all of that, but chocolate dominates and isn't that aggressive, still a nice milf flavor. Body is on the thin side for a stout, nice amount of life, mildly dry, and extremely drinkable. This far from earth shattering, but it is a pleasant almost session able stout."
"Dark brown and clear with faint edges and a fine tan cap. Thin head that stuck around for a while and left some spots on the glass. Roasty aroma, coffee and cocoa, kind of like chocolate cake. Sweet lactose up front, cocoa and semisweet chocolate, slight hop character with mild to moderate bitterness mostly in the finish. Medium plus body with medium to low carbonation, a bit dry with a hint of alcohol, decent texture. Pretty good, but it didn't feel completely melded together. I'd hesitate to let it sit though, for fear of losing some of the rich character."

"Bottled in Nov. 2012 and opened in Sept. 2013. Poured a dark brown, almost black with a very small brown head. The initial smell was nice, dark malt with a little bit of coffee, but as it warmed up I started to notice a little sourness. The sourness definitely came through in the taste also. I think I must have gotten a slightly infected bottle, unfortunately. It seems like it would have been a pretty nice stout otherwise. I didn't really notice any chocolate, but that could have been related to the infection. I look forward to re-reviewing this beer if I find a good bottle."

"Pretty ho hum. I don't like the tiny metallic flavor. Not out right bad, just average and nothing I would recommend."
""
"This tasting experience started out terrific, but ended as a downer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, there are good notes in here, but they seem to clash with each other, as if too much is going on. The beer is also slightly watery in mouthfeel, and the flavors weaker than they could be (especially those of the underlying stout), both of which contribute to the cola-like overtone."
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Finally a beer that I can smell! Cocoa (obviously) and burnt toast on the nose. A slight bittersweetness on the fore with hints of orange or lemon-peel. A great silky-smooth moutfeel that really coats your mouth and lingers on the tongue. The chocolate or cocoa, rather, doesn't really come in until the very end of the finish. It's truly a bittersweet chocolate flavor only a few full seconds after you swallow."
"Overall: a tasty enough good, not great effort. Glad I tried. Might pick up again, might not."

"Flavorful sweeter stout, with more dark chocolate and a moderatly dry dusty hop finish. Chocolate lingering on the palate. Well done and well worth a try."
""
""
""
"I have recommended this one to others and think you should try it to as it is a winner as a stout in my book."
""
""
""
"Poured a dark brown color, deep and nearly opaque, with a thin cap of tan head. Aroma was pretty chocolaty, lesser notes of caramel and cream. Taste was similar, sweet chocolate, caramel creme candies, cappuccino...overall a pretty sweet beer, with a touch of roast in the finish. Where this one suffered was in the mouthfeel. It was nice and tasty, but quite thin in body, definitely more of a porter than a stout. The beer was served somewhat chilled, and I actually think that was a good idea. I liked it overall."
""
""
""
""
"This is a sweeter stout, but there's an element of sourness I hadn't expected. I'm noting a bit of dry raspberry as well. Thin bodied and highly carbonated. Semi-sweet cocoa finish."
""
"So far, my # 1 chocolate beer!"
"Very enjoyable and makes for an excellent dessert beer."
""

"Alka-Seltzer touch that leads to a slightly grassy bite and cherry sweetness. The grass bite carries an herbal hop sort of quality that I like very much. It's nearly full bodied yet has a low carbonation, somewhat aqueous feel. It's all good with this flavorful brew."
""
""
"Love the after taste. It was a chocolate lover's heaven. My only criticism, is that since I do a lot of cooking, I could not detect any truffle in this brew. Truffles have a distinct odor and taste, but I did not get any of that here"
"It is a nice beer, better than most chocolate stouts I've had. It could have more body, but it is pleasant. The actually chocolate flavor is impressive, as so often there is a hint of cocoa flavor or a light chocolate scent at most. I recommend this highly."
"In terms of alcohol, this was one of the lightest Stouts that I've had, but there's just enough here to make its presence felt. It was nice to have a beer that was easy to drink but still dark enough to be a Stout, without being full of booze, licorice, or lactose. It wasn't enough to warm me up tonight but certainly put a smile on my face as I kicked back and enjoyed it. This is a subtly enjoyable beer."
""
"Overall: A nice stout. The Munson's chocolate adds a nice feature to this stout."
""
"O/D-Would have liked this a lot better via a beer flight than a whole pint. It was just too concentrated. I can see why this would be a hit with someone who craved such a chocolatey brew."
""
""
"Bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt up front. Some milk chocolate sweetness and a little caramel fill in. Peaty, and even a bit smoky (flinty), especially toward the finish. Light roasted coffee and dark chocolate bitterness into the finish. Semi sweet chocolate and vanilla bean linger. Medium-full body with a slightly syrupy feel. Nicely done!"
""
""
""
"O - This is a novelty sort of beer. I like Munson's Chocolates and some of the Thomas Hooker beers, but this is not their best showing."
""
"Cheers!"

"O: This beer has a good amount of chocolate flavors without really having any sweetness. It is quite easy to drink."
"O: Certainly the best offering I have had from this brewery and it is definitely enjoyable. I would get this beer again but it is more of a sipper than a session beer. Nice complexity of different chocolates in the taste and smell."
""
""
"Overall it would be really nice if not for the burnt acrid roasted flavor. Nice chocolate, creamy, drinkable, nice malts other than the acrid roast."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall A perfect chocolate stout, even if it is out of season. Compared to other chocolate beers I have had, this one is on the tops. A great anytime dessert beer!"
""
"In a new world full of chocolate beers this one stood out for me and I will certainly be back for more!"
""
""

"O: Another chocolate beer. It's good but the field of choco-beers is filling up pretty rapidly, and I can't think of any way this separate from the pack. A nice dessert beer, but I don't see it catching on permanently and am willing to wait for winter for Sam Adam's Chocolate Bock to get my chocolate beer fix."
"Overall, likable, with a decent balance and intensity in the chocolate department. I think a six pack would get old fast, but still worth a try."
"The beer poured a rich chocalot brown with a creamy tan head. The aroma was chocalot malt. The taste was a bit more coffee than chocalot, which given the name, disappointed. The feel was light and a bit watery. A decent chocalot stout, but the name promised a bit richer more chocalot taste than was delivered."
"Another new brew from Dino! Poured from bottle to pint glass the beer arrives a rich deep brown with a nice 1.5 finger khaki colored head, nice retention and lacing. The nose is rich and powerful: milk chocolate,cocoa, dark chocolate, roasted malt, nice. More approachable than expected. The flavor is more of the same. Likely the richest beer I've ever had! The roast and chocolate blend terrifically with a gentle sweetness and mild bitterness. Creamy and smooth the beer finishes with a lingering milk chocolate flavor. Wee carbonated, very nice. Overall, this is a serious treat! Very enjoyable!"
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid chocolaty stout that is worth drinking for a long time."
""
""
"Another reminder of why I've avoided this local brewer for so long. Have a bottle of Liberator to review later that could very well be redemptive, but Chocolate Truffle Stout isn't getting my hopes up."
""
""
""
"O: Finally, a stout from Hooker, Munson's Chocolate Stout is a nice dessert beer option at a deceptive 5.9% ABV. Its a relief to see them take on a style they were albeit willing to conform to their standards. That is to say, the brewery is probably not going to be launching a ""big beer"" series anytime soon, so it's nice to see their offering for this uniquely Americanized style done well."
"Chocolate truffle stout eh? How can I not give this one a try? Picked up a six pack for $7.99 back home in CT. Pours jet black with a nice tan head. Taste is medium bodied, smacks you with chocolate malts upfront, nice hoppiness on the back end. Super smooth and drinkable. Not too sure about the truffle part.. but one of the better chocolate stouts I've had, solid beer."
""
"Good taste, not at all hearty for stout. The chocolate is nice, but the finished product is just ok."
"Notes: Surprised that this one didn't hit our market sooner, with all the other chocolate beers conveniently arriving around Valentine's Day."
"O: Not a style I ordinarily go in for, but this is an enjoyable beer. One does the trick though."
"Overall: Like opening a box of Valentine's Day chocolates. One of the better chocolate beers out there because the chocolate is so complex and rich. Yet the beer element here is also nice and complex. Due to its richness, I only want one or two per sitting, but would get this again. One of the better beers coming out of Connecticut."

"After a somewhat aggressive pour this beer turns out very dark brown, just a shade lighter than black, with a light khaki head of about one finger. The foam falls to a thin layer of bubbles with a bit of lace on the sides of the glass. As the name suggests chocolate is in the smell but it isn't alone as there is also a standard compliment of dark and roasted malts typical of a dry stout but overall everything is a bit subdued. The taste is a bit of chocolate both from the added chocolate and chocolate malts along with a good deal of bitter roasted and black patent malt. Hop flavor is nearly non existent but it is still somewhat bitter to astringent due to the malt. The body of this beer is quite light which surprises me for a stout of this style, I'd expect something a bit fuller. The finish is slightly bitter and rather dry as astringent bittering from the roasted malt comes through, again I'd rather something a bit sweeter for this stout. Overall this is slightly above average. It is an interesting concept but suffers because the stout isn't right too best accentuate the chocolate. A sweeter, fuller and more complex (maybe higher alcohol?) base would have benefited this one."
"As a child, I grew up eating Munson's Chocolates during the holidays. I find it funny now to be drinking a beer made with chocolate from this family-owned, Connecticut-based company. All in all, a nicely done stout. Hopefully this is only the start of Hooker Brewing's attempt to add some long needed diversity to their current lineup of beers."
"O: Overall a great stout... with chocolate. Hooker built a great flavored beer without skimping on the base style. Very drinkable. I was surprised how easy drinking it was. Now that I've tried it alone, I want to try it again pairing it with various foods. Well done!"
""
"A light and friendly chocolate stout as opposed to a dark an indulgent version. Would be great if the base beer was improved upon."
""
"Overall, this is an average to slightly above average chocolate stout offering whose flavor is terrific, but it's scent and appearance are nothing special."
""
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped: 2012-02-09. Sampled on March 6, 2012. It pours a very dark, rich chocolate black with a moderate, short-lived mocha head. Brewed with seven malts you get the chocolate, oat, and dark malts right up front on the nose with this acidic hop bite around the back. The body was thin the medium, which was a slight letdown. The bold flavor begins with sweet chocolate and cocoa then goes bitter and ends nearly dry. Its name sounded much more enticing than the experience but it was still a decent enough beer."
"12oz bottle with a Born On Date of 2012-02-15. Pours a blackish dark brown with no head. No lacing. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate truffles, and some coffee. Tastes chocolatey. Flavors of vanilla, coffee, some marshmallow, and truffle. Mouthfeel is a bit light and thin for the style but it still works. This is an easy drinking stout that isn't so chocolatey it slows you down. Overall, an interesting collaboration well executed. Worth seeking out."
""
"O: Not a bad chocolate stout. Pretty simple, surprisingly heavy on the bitter coffee and roast (given the name) but the chocolate is there to help balance it out decently."

"O: This beer was great! I am really into my coffee/chocolate stouts, so this was perfect for me. A nice change from my regular Sierra Nevada stout I usually get. I had only had Hooker's Watermelon Ale (yuckkk), but when I saw that they collaborated with the delicious Munson's chocolatiers, I grabbed a six pack of this, and was found that Hooker can make a great beer. I ended buying 2 more 6 packs (one for the girlfriend for valentine's day) since they were flying off the shelves If you like stout (especially chocolate stouts) then this beer is for you. I hope to see this again next winter."
""
"pretty good. I've had much worse chocolate stouts by more highly acclaimed breweries. Good job, Hooker! Make this regularly."
"M&D - the body is much thinner than I expected, it honestly seems more like a porter to me, or at least porters I have had, It has a mild acidic bite a tasty brew, but not the bomb I had expected. Regardless, a delicious well-brewed beer."
"Great brew! Not sure if I'd want more than one or two in a sitting but definitely something you should try if you like chocolate to any degree."
"O - I went in with high expectations and I have to admit this beer was a success. The body is a bit thin, but the nose and flavors capture the awesomeness that is Munson's chocolates. Its listed as a spring seasonal on Hooker's site so hopefully this will return next year."
""
"O) Great beer which is slighly sneaky on the ABV!"
