The best milk stout I've ever had is Left Hand Brewing's Milk Stout from the nitro bottle and that is really something special. This falls well short of that. I can't say it's a bad beer, on the contrary, I rather enjoy it's company. But if I'm ever in the mood for a milk stout, this will not be my first, second, or third pick.","BigC88","May 09, 2014"

It makes it more of a stout you'd sip on on a hot summer day, but it's more simple. Solid chocolate flavor with a good roastiness... it does about everything you'd want in a milk stout to a tee, but it's a bit thin, and I just didn't enjoy the flavor quite as much as Moo-Hoo.

However the smell is somehow a bit nonexistent, the mouthfeel is creamy and sweetly malted. the head on this beer lasts about as long as it takes to drink, although not a very high ABV%, very satisfying, drinkable beer. it does have a lactose content so its not for everyone but it is surely for me. and 2. because its only about 50mins away from my house!!","beerded_drunk","Oct 10, 2013"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer appears near black with a half inch of beige head. The aroma offers a strong lactic presence, with additional notes of chocolate, vanilla, roast. Milk chocolate is the dominant flavor. The beer finishes with a hint of bitterness and toasty bread. Creamy at first, with some zesty carbonation mid to late palate. A solid example of a milk stout.","Huhzubendah","Nov 09, 2012"

I LOVE the sweet, subtle hint of milkiness that resides on the palate long after you've taken a sip, it literally tastes like you just took a drink of milk. I also enjoy the up-front malty-ness that I tend to get. This is my favorite beer from LBC.","darktower","Oct 02, 2012"

Not much lacing either. Smell was very heavy on the cocoa powder. Taste was very good, but extremely sweet. It's really chocolate milk in a beer bottle. Not heavy in body at all, so the lactose gave it a creamy yet thin mouthfeel. Certainly a good dessert beer, but not one that I'd have more than one of in a session. Too overly sweet and thus one dimensional for me. Paired tonight after dinner with an assortment of chocolates.","morebeergood","Mar 27, 2012"

3.68,-5.2,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"A rich mocha brown color is the color of the beer with an abundance of rich brown foamy head. It's fast fading leaving some spotty lacing on the glass and some surface foam. Aroma is lite on the nose with hints of lactose sweetness cream and roasted malts. A good roasted malt flavor, condensed milk, cocoa, and nuiances of licorise. Feels thin on the palette but smooth and soft. A pretty good stout in my opinion but probably a lot better out of the tap. The bottle version seems weak and watered down a bit.","micromaniac129","Dec 03, 2011"

Its a nice back-up beer for sure, but not my first choice. Its hard to not give it a better score, but that carbonation was a real killer for me.","donssword","Dec 02, 2011"

Smells of toasted bread, chocolate milk, and cinnamon bark. Something about the smell is super appealing to me. Taste is of roasted coffee beans, cocoa powder in milk, and dark malts. I get a slight cinnamon powder on toast taste on the finish with a slight cocoa powder bitterness. A good level of carbonation while still being smooth and creamy.

This is a light to medium stout in terms of heaviness. Sweet chocolate taste dominates. Just an all around, great tasting English sweet stout and this is due to the good choice and balance of roasty and sweet malts. A brew that has easily become one of my quick grabs because each year it is a reliable choice.","mindlucent2007","May 15, 2011"

Some chocolate, coffee and roasted malts in the nose. Palate is nearly flawless for a sweet stout. Subtle sweet chocolate malt flavor is balanced with a roasted coffee flavor in the finish. None of the flavors are overpowering and everything works together seamlessly. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth with a slightly dry finish.

Lots of sugar and some vanilla as well. Somewhat of a vanilla mocha scent. Taste is very interesting...this is my first ""milk stout"". Somewhat watery, but definitely more ""milky"" than any stout I've ever had. Initially I get a watery (soda water taste), followed by chocolate milkshake, and then some great vanilla/espresso notes at the end. Still kinda wishing the soda water taste wasn't there though. The mouthfeel is a little to watery for my liking (in stouts), but not terrible. The drinkability is very high... I really enjoy this beer (although it has its downfalls)...I could see this being a stout that I could almost drink a whole six pack of (not too rich).

The nose comprises molasses, roasted malts, and a hint of cocoa powder in the background. The taste is very similar, though the molasses is toned down slightly, and the cocoa has transmogrified into a bitter dark-ish chocolate flavor. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a decent stout, but not much in the way of lacto sweetness or creaminess...just a normal dry stout.

It really feels like the consistency of milk. By feel alone you can really imagine this being milk but the aroma subtly suggests some chocolate charcoal and just a quiet hint of citrus hop. The flavor favors the charcoal with a much more muted chocolate idea, nicely blended in this milky feeling brew, as advertised. It has minimal carbonation but it works nicely as is. Very drinkable for sure, a tad sweet but there is some roasted grain and caramel mixed in for a very nicely blended end product.

Slight citrus hops in both the aroma and taste. Flavors mostly of burnt grain bitterness blended with the hop presence. Light feel and lightly carbonated. Lingering taste of bitters via burnt grain and hops are left clinging inside the mouth.

3.65,-5.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours an almost complete black with slight ruby outlines. A one finger tan colored head rests atop the darkness leaving sticky spotty walls of webbing on the sides. Smell is a nice combination of smoke and sweet; roasted malts, coffee grains, milk and dark chocolate. Caramel and toasted grains in the nose as well. Taste starts off pretty watered down but seems to improve a bit afterwards. Midway the roasted malts, lactose, and espresso flavors emerge. Aftertaste is pretty one dimensional with weak chocolate and wet earthy flavors. Medium body with a slick and greasy feel. Carbonation is a bit above mild and could settle down a bit, especially for the style. Pretty run of the mill stout, not bad but nothing I would go seek out.","BeerTruth","Feb 02, 2009"

3.95,1.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Thanks to my friends at FSRI for their generous gift. Served at 53 degrees in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque brown, two shades shy of black with a dense, khaki-colored cap that sizzled and popped as it quickly receded before eventually settling into a skim of foam and a tight band around the perimeter of the glass. Some lacing, but no legs. Scent out of the bottle was lactose and cocoa. Taste follows nose, but also picked up a coffee milk flavor. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and watery with a mild and consistent background effervescence that tingled on the tongue between quaffs. Easy drinking and flavorful; a nice session stout.","Jwale73","Jan 07, 2009"

Taste is roasted malts and sweet malt with a hopping detected at the end. Not bitter at the end but the hopping cancels out the sweetness of the malt to leave a balanced finish of cocoa and a hint of semi sweet chocolate. This is the bullseye on the brew style.

Comes off more like a full American or English Stout (Middle Ages' Black Heart). The grains don't taste like coffee so much as just black patent malt. There also seems to be a missing complexity to this beer, or rather, the flavor might just be too plain. Still it's a stout to enjoy with a meal or after.","tempest","Jul 08, 2007"

More chocolate, coffee, light molasses, and a touch of vanilla. A nice mildly-nutty finish, very slight sourness and a silky-smooth mouthfeel keep me coming back for more. Wow this beer was good. IÂ’ve had this beer many times out of the bottle, but this was my first trial of it on tap.

There seems to be something missing in the flavor profile, yes you get the little bit of a chocolating sweetness and a bit of coffee thrown in but it seems that is could use something more. The roasted malts in the finish makes this in my opinion. A decent beer but not one that I will be clamoring to get in the future.

The nose on this one gives notes of very solid roast with lighter chocolate and a really nice lacto character that gives it an edge, but is not too strong. I dig it. The flavor is also nice. It is dominated with the lacto character, definately letting me know this one is a sweet stout. Behind that, there is a solid roasted character. I'd like a little more chocolate character in this one, but it is still a good brew. The mouthfeel is on the thick end of moderate, with a light carbonation. Overall, this one is a nice brew.

This also affected the mouthfeel, which was too thick and clingy (not sweet). Very odd milk stout- I get almost none of the sweetness from this variety, but plenty of creaminess.

Just a splash of bitterness in the finish, but almost entirely sweet. Halfway through my pint, I lost interest in the beer as the sweetness became too much. A bit unbalanced and rather lacking in complexity or texture. Somewhat oily in my mouth without a creamy or smooth finish. Not nearly roasted or smoked enough to be a stout, and not creamy enough to be a milk stout. An average beer all around.","jaluria","Jul 07, 2006"

It has a light, highly carbonated body that evens out quickly, becoming almost creamy, and reveals roasted malts, faint green hops, coffee, and a milky acidity, all of which combine to make it taste almost like a coffee/milk concoction you'd find at a cafe.

Milky lactose characer is minimal for the style. Caramel/toffee is also mild, but is present. The flavors in this beer are disjointed.

4.3,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"tasty, tasty stuff. much moreso than i expected. it pours a dark brown colour with a nice pillowy tan head, which hangs around for a while and leaves a nice residue on the glass as well. the smell is a nice balance of sweetness and coffee, with malt and maybe some caramel present as well. the flavour is just spot on. the coffee notes are just subtle enought for my liking and the sweetness is effective but not overpowering. there is some burnt malt flavour and a touch of chocolate scattered thoughout as well. the finish is earthy and surprisingly dry. mouthfeel is rich and creamy and seemed to me to fall between a stout and porter in terms of body, which is right where i feel it should be. i could easily drink this one again, and often.","SixpointJMH","Nov 17, 2004"

With the picture of a cow on the label you get the taste of milk as if the put some in the stout (they might have I know homebrewers who do crazier things). The darkness of this beer is a beauty but it offers little head but it might off a tap on with nitrogen. The roasted taste is followed imediately with sweetness with a hint of sour notes. It reminds me of the smell of sour milk, but not in a bad way. It does taste like soured milk only in the after taste is it lingering but not strongly. I found this beer enjoyable and could drink a few here and there.","Higravity","Oct 06, 2004"

Other flavors were roasted malt, coffee and a bit of sweet caramel. Mouthfeel was standard with about a medium body and good carbonation.

Milk coats the back of my mouth. IÂ’m quite impressed by the balance of beer. This is my first of the sub style and I was a little hesitant. As I continue drinking, I notice the great lacing that surrounds my glass. Well done. The beer has a slight sweet taste, reminding me of the cream ale I had last night, but this sweetness comes from a very subdued chocolate infusion. The nutty flavor may be hazelnuts.

Sadly, there arenâ€™t enough genuine milk stouts around anymore, so it is wonderful to have the opportunity to try this.

The luxurious darkness of this beer made the appearance very pleasant. Heavy malt tones dominated the smell, with lots of roasted and chocolate malt characteristics. The taste had an interesting sweetness and a smooth, creamy texture, probably due to the lactose. A nice mild coffee aftertaste, with a smoked features lingered for a while. Mouthfeel was very soft, and a bit thin but did not detract from the overall quality.

The aroma are soothing tones of mild chocolate, and dark roasts creating a warming sensation like taking some freshly cracked coffee roasts in very nice and mild aroma, there is a bit of a huskiness there in the finish of the aroma. The taste is well balanced between bitter sweet creamy textured tones and the harsh dark roasts that leave such a great flavor on the palate. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied, but not heavy or cloying in any way very creamy textured mouthfeel making this one very good stout.
