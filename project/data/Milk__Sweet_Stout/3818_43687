The nose is strong butterscotch which would be quite nice if it were toned down a bit.  It's just too sweet and strong.  The taste is similarly overloaded to the point that I finds self just trying to get it down instead of spending any time with it.

Very minimal head (probably due to the temp). Smells GREAT, smells of vanilla, Carmel, brown sugar, malt, and coffee. Most notable is the Carmel to me. Tastes good at first, like vanilla and Carmel, but the after taste is very alcoholic and medicinal, nearly ruins it. The carbonation is slightly less than what I prefer, and it seems a bit thin for a stout. Overall it's nothing that great, but the smell IS remarkable.","anthony23cippy","Beers"

The aroma?  Well, creme brulee almost says it all.  It smells just like the sweet vanilla/custard/caramelized goodness you'd order as a desert.  The vanilla bean really comes across in the nose.  The flavor's are like nose but more hidden behind huge sweetness.  It would be too sweet if not for a nice touch of bitterness and some mild alcohol heat.  The full bodied mouth feel is quite surprising at first because of the thickness, but it's very creamy and smooth.  Glad I bought this.

Pours dark as a good stout should, but almost non-existent head despite aggressive pour. Scent is wonderful; pronounced sweetness of vanilla, caramel, burnt sugars. To be honest, it not only smells but tastes remarkably like Bailey's Irish Cream; just minus the thick, creamy mouthfeel. As with all other flavor-specific beers I've had from Southern Tier, it pretty much nails creme brulee in flavor. I'm really enjoying the finish of caramelized sugar. Feel is not quite full-bodied, nicely carbonated, and not nearly as astringent as you'd expect from an imperial. This is a delicious milk stout that I would highly recommend for dessert. Well done.","LouZ","Jan 11, 2015"

First beer I ever had at a bar, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but it will always be my favorite. Very thick and very dark, but doesn't have much of a head which is why I docked a bit on look.

3.75,-3.8,3.75,4.25,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Overall - Okay, so which camp do I fall into? Well, I do find the flavors interesting, and I definitely pick up the creme brulee flavors, but I will not be purchasing this one again. This gets a 3.71 from me, as I understand and appreciate the brewers intentions, but this is something to have as a desert beer during the holidays, with 3-4 guests getting about a 6oz pour. I will finish this bomber myself, but I will also return my glass to the freezer a few times to keep the temp down. It is still a fiercely sweet stout, there are some nice roasted and charred sugar flavors here, but the sweetness seems to intensify with each sip, and becomes a bit of a chore after half the bomber - and the alcohol becomes hot, making the roast and char flavors become almost astringent. I love a subtle sweetness that just balances, but this is the opposite - I find my palate desperately searching out and clinging to the roasted flavors, and the dried vanilla bean, but the next sip just coats everything with another layer of sweet vanilla custard. So while my grade is generous and understanding of the flavors, I will now officially join the camp that will never purchase this beer again - but I will not bash it as some members of ""this camp"" are apt to do. Try this if you must, but I strongly recommend Oat and Choklat, they are excellent.","blackcompg","Jun 21, 2014"

First aroma and most pronounced is the vanilla. If there is any others I'm not getting them. Well, I guess the milk/cream aspect is quite prevalent too. Tastes like a very sweet, vanilla, creme brulee; as it should. The carbonation is quite decent for a stout and the smooth, creamy texture is pleasant as it finishes. Warming from the alcohol is a yes and the alcohol content is hidden considering all you taste is sugar sweetness. In the end, this was a delight to drink though I only could do half the 22oz cause it was so rich. I really enjoyed this stout but the high-level sweetness is probably not for everyone.","dpgoblejr","Jun 05, 2014"

I figured it would be too sweet, or like melted ice cream with a bit of a malt taste to it. The balance of the beer really struck me. It was beer-first, though by no means was the creme-brulee a minor flavor. It didn't taste fake like some chocolate stouts or gimmicky like Voodoo Doughnut. It just tasted like a better than average stout with some very natural-tasting flavors added in. It would make the perfect dessert beer, but really it's not so sweet that it couldn't be enjoyed at any time. I'll likely buy again!","AlpacaAlpaca","Apr 25, 2014"

Boozy notes also begin to peek through as this warmed. This honestly smelled like a pastry, maybe tiaramasu. Incredibly smooth, slightly thick feel, with rich, tight carbonation up front and a milky stickiness at the end. Creamy, sweet vanilla flavor up front that slowly tapers as a tangy bitter hop bite rides overtop. Charred malt flavor beneath that slowly intensifies to the finish accompanied by smooth vanilla. The feel and candy-like sweetness is reminiscent of Pumking. ","IronLover","Apr 17, 2014"

This stout pours an almost black mahogany color with almost no head and very little silky lacing. The nose is delicious; butterscotch, vanilla, coffee, and just a little booze. It is actually one of the most satisfying smelling beers that I've ever had. The flavor follows the nose but unfortunately the butterscotch flavor overpowers the coffee flavor that would of perfectly balanced this stout. It is still very tasty and satisfying. The mouthfeel is a little thick and sticky but this is actually a good thing because the lingering flavors of butterscotch and the small amount of coffee that lives just in the tail.

3.67,-5.9,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"This beer poured a deep dark black with about one finger of light tan creamy head. Minimal head retention but a little lacing all the same. The aroma is sweet and strongly vanilla. For me it's almost too sweet. The taste closely matches the aroma and I was wishing for more stout and less vanilla. The vanilla is almost too much and overpowers the subtle milk stout. It has a nice feeling in the palate from the lactose. Overall it's just a little too sweet for my taste and I wish the bottle notes had more prominently highlighted that this was strictly a dessert beer.","delta490","Mar 10, 2014"

The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is that it is a bit too sweet on its own for me. HOWEVER, if you mix it with a coffee style stout, it's UNBELIEVABLE (like Starbucks made a beer). I will absolutely buy this and serve it as a dessert beer or to mix with various stouts or porters. And, FYI, I think the ladies with a sweet tooth would love this one too (especially the ones who say they ""don't like beer"").","Mrlhodson","Mar 09, 2014"

4.32,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/9/2014. Pours dense pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, vanilla, butterscotch, cream, custard, brown sugar, toast, light coffee, and light herbal hops. Fantastic aromas with very authentic creme brulee character with light-moderate hop presence; with big strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, vanilla, butterscotch, custard, cream, brown sugar, toast, light coffee, and light herbal/pine hops. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, butterscotch, brown sugar, custard, toast, light coffee, and slight herbal/pine hops on the finish for a while. Incredible robustness and complexity of dark malt, lactose, and vanilla flavors; with just enough hop bitterness to cut out any cloying sweetness on the finish. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding imperial milk stout! All around awesome balance of dark malt, vanilla, and lactose flavors with moderate hop balance; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 07, 2014"

4.31,10.5,4.25,5,4,4,4.25,"I had this beer on tap at a local place with an amazing selection of micros. Appearance is very dark which I was not expecting. The smell is amazing. Truly smells like Crete brûlée which was a pleasure. The taste was very good and more surprising since some beers smell like the targeted goal but taste does not always follow. Definitely a dessert beer so I would not be able to drink too much of it. Mouthfeel is creamy and pleasant. My girlfriend bought a bottle and we plan to drink it tonight. Read another review in which they mixed it with Southern Tiers Pumpking. I happen to have two 22oz. Bottles of that so I will try that as well. Very good beer in small doses. Highly recommend at least a try.","Jamey61","Jan 02, 2014"

The smell reminds me of a Duncan Hinse yellow cake mix being poured into a pan and baking, which for me is fantastic. The taste is sweet at first but then turns sour and bitter, like pure vanilla without any sugar. Faint chocolate and coffee flavors. The bitter and sour flavors do linger, like chewing on a hunk of Baker's chocolate. The alcohol is nicely hidden, and it warms very well. A bit too much carbonation.","kaufmaal","Dec 21, 2013"

As for the Creme Brulee on it's own--22 ounces is just too much for it to be enjoyable. What I mean by that is, the first few sips seem good enough. You get the sweetness and the taste of Creme Brulee. Then, the alcohol flavor hits. And keeps hitting. By the time you get halfway through the 22 ouncer, which it is only sold in, it is just overpowering and the beer becomes a bit harsh. Amazingly, however, when mixed with Southern Tier's Pumpking(also available only in 22 ounces) it becomes what is known as a Creamy Pumpkin and it is outstanding. One of the best beer mixes I have had, to be honest. But, unfortunately for the Creme Brulee, I am rating it mostly on its own merrit, which is subpar at best.","scanny24","Beers"

The nose is like having a German chocolate cake smashed into your face, coconut, caramel, butterscotch, chocolate, only a slight roasted edge, some candied oranges, this has a “take no prisoners” approach. Full-bodied, same story in the mouth, unbearably sweet like a hose force feeding you toffee, caramel and butterscotch. This almost makes it hard to register the vanilla and chocolate. The carbonation is super soft and adds to the fluffy character. Heavy on the Maraschino cherries and again candied oranges. Does an odd bitter twist at the end.

The flavors on this are pretty nice and it really does taste close to liquid creme brulee. However, the sweetness becomes cloying very quickly and drinkability is extremely low. It'd be nice to have in a 4-5oz serving, but anything beyond that is too much. This has no business being sold in a 22oz bottle.","Jonada","Oct 08, 2013"

When I had this with vanilla ice cream as recommended on the bottle, the bitterness really came out and complimented the ice cream. Sweet aroma with bitter roast compliment to the ice cream. Once I finished the ice cream and let my palate rest a bit, then all the sweetness in this beer came out. Even then, the sweetness was tempered by the roasted malt and hop bitterness. While I want another bottle to crack open right now, I know I should not have a second one of these in a sitting. That being said, a big glass of this beer with dessert is fantastic.","damndirtyape","Sep 01, 2013"

If you’re a fan of roasted characteristics in a stout over sweet characteristics, you might want to stay away from this one. If you have a sweet tooth, definitely check this one out. I think the thing that puts this one above other very sweet stouts (eg. Imperial Biscotti Break) is that the alcohol is nowhere to be found. This has nearly 10% ABV and is immensely sweet but is still very, very drinkable. I think Southern Tier has a winner here. Cheers!","BlackBelt5112203","Aug 28, 2013"

This beer had pretty bad drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little filling and the flavors did a decent job at holing my attention, but the sweetness was so high that there's no way that I could every drink a full bomber of it, half the bottle was a bit of a struggle and I think that splitting a bottle between four or five people would be good. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty good and worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, it was just way too high and it's up there as one of the sweeter beers I have had and that really hurt the drinkability. I wouldn't by this beer again, maybe if I was going to a tasting and I thought some people would like, but other than that I won't be buying another bottle anytime soon and I don't think age would improve this beer. I would recommend this to anyone who likes sweet dessert beers. All in all I liked this beer a lot at first, but the more I drank it the more it wore on me, the flavors were nice, but I wish more of that stout base come through and that the sweetness was really toned down, I felt like i may need an insulin shot after i drank half of the bomber. I appreciate the effort it took to make this beer, but in the end it just didn't come together as good as it could have, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Aug 18, 2013"

Totally nailed the smell of creme brûlée. I'm blown away. That vanilla aroma is mixed with caramel and is-absolutely amazing with undertones of dark roast. The caramel flavoring dominates, but the vanilla sneaks in to the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy. This is dessert in a bottle. Very rich and decadent.","Franziskaner","Aug 17, 2013"

I can easily smell its overpowering vanilla scent sitting several feet away from my glass. The flavor is slightly less objectionable. The taste is somewhat more subdued than the smell as it blends with the sharp chocolate/mocha flavors of the roasted malts in the stout. Medium bodied, a bit chewy (good things), but a bit too carbonated for this style I felt. Mouth feel would probably improve on nitro. Overall, not my 'mug of beer'. Southern Tier went for something insane but got something ludicrous instead. It's just a little over the top for my taste.","Kevin73","Beers"

The best description for the flavor is dessert in a glass. The vanilla from the aroma is present in the flavor with chocolate, toffee, and coffee like roastiness.

This is pretty much the very definition of a dessert beer -- sweet, tasty, awesome stuff. The ABV doesn't come at *all* in the aroma, and it may only be traceable in the taste due to a very slight warmth.

Dark brown pour, black in the glass with toffee-brown around the edges and a thin brown head that dissipated rapidly with spotty lacing. Smell is huge caramel and toffee, with malts hidden in there somewhere, and a tiny hint of alcohol. Taste isn't as heavy on the caramel/toffee as the smell, but it's definitely there. Sweetness explodes up front with the trademark bitter coffee/chocolate of a stout only coming in to finish off. Leaves a bit of sticky aftertaste; mouthfeel is full and creamy. It's a slow drinker because of how sweet it is; this wouldn't be an every day beer, but it would pair amazingly with desert or as a nightcap.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Apr 21, 2013"

This beer caught me off guard at first, I was expecting a roasty sweet stout, which it is but it's more different then you may think. This beer has a good roasted malt flavor and a dry feel that lasts all the way through. There is a lot of chocolate and a possible hint of vanilla. Some coffee notes and a lot of caramel and toffee. The strongest flavor in this beer is unlike anything I have had in a beer before, Imagine a liquid form of Oreo Icing, mixed with coffee and served on a hershey bar. An extremely sweet beer, Its best in small portions because it is so sweet. The beer is not too thick but has a velvety smooth feel. This beer does not go well with a meal and is sure to be the only thing you can drink in a single setting. A great desert beer so treat it as such.","TwelveOunces","Dec 04, 2012"

4.09,4.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"i should start by saying a bomber of this for a single person is more than challenging. its downright difficult. however, this is a clever one, totally distinct from anything else ive ever had out there. the pours is inky black, just a little brown left visible, with zero head, just a think mocha colored film. the nose is brilliant, burnt sugar, scorched chocolate malt, brown butter, brutal sweetness, this has all the elements of a delicious french dessert. the flavor too is very akin to the genuine article, although it is a diminishing marginal return really, as the sweetness starts to rot the teeth and the gut after about a third of the bottle. vanilla beans heavy through the front end, while the brnt sugar custardy component comes in later. the dark malts last throughout. alcohol also becomes quite potent as it warms up. the feel is thick as any beer ive had i think, super dense, quite custardesque really, as it well should be. minimal carbonation exacerbates this feature. overall im glad i got to try this, because it truly is yummy and unique, but this is not a beer that can be consumed with any kind of efficiency or regularity, it is indeed a monster. the sugar just makes it gnarly to drink much of. the label is brilliant, and the beer is just as good. a must try, but proceed with a couple of buddies!","StonedTrippin","Nov 20, 2012"

Head retention is pretty good and there's a decent amount of head retention. The nose has lots of vanilla and some burnt sugar, but not much else and not much in the way of aromas from actual beer. The flavor is a bit of a letdown, as burnt sugar comes to the forefront and is a bit acrid. Vanilla is also still there, and as the beer warms, a little bit of roasty coffee and dark chocolate becomes apparent. The body is nice, full and just a little bit creamy, and paired with a nicely subdued carbonation. Creme Brulee is an interesting idea for a beer, but in execution the flavoring is a bit over the top.","axeman9182","Aug 21, 2012"

The taste is very creamy, and starts sweet, with lots of vanilla taste, then it finishes with a boozy and bitter taste. Very easy to drink, and overall a very nice and unique beer. Fantastic for dessert as the name suggests.","vette2006c5r","Jun 22, 2012"

3.83,-1.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark auburn-to-black coloring with a dense, foamy, beige colored head. The supersweet caramel aromas waft off the glass while you pour. On closer inspection, there are layers of cream sweetness, roasty notes, and rich caramel. Flavors are rich and uber sweet. Dark, roasty coffee backbone supports a rich ribbon of darkly sweet caramel and sugary sweetness. This is a rich, extremely sweet brew. Tons of flavor packed into a smooth, light bodied stout. The aftertaste is hard to discern initially due to the abundance of sweet flavors, but it is a mild bitter, roasted blending. Rich, slightly cloying finish. This is one for those with a large sweettooth, that is for sure.","GarthDanielson","Jun 18, 2012"

The taste is a bit roasty with a bit of vanilla at first, but goes quickly to the super sweet burnt sugar, milk, and caramel flavors. I can't really fault it on taste, it really does taste like creme brulee. The mouthfeel is thick and lightly carbonated. The drinkability is strange here. It absolutely does mask the alcohol completely, yet the beer is so sweet that it is still rather difficult to drink. Overall, this is really what the label says. It's a creme brulee stout. It's a good dessert beer, just don't go into it thinking you're going to be able to drink all 22 ounces, because you won't be able to.

The nose was insanely sweet, but perfectly attuned to all of the flavors, with butter, white sugar, vanilla, and a crispy char. At the same time, coffee and chocolate flavored malts crashed throughout, giving a depth of flavor, and a seriousness to the palate. The nose was crazy sweet, and made the drinker cautious at first, but the following sip was excitingly bold, and fitting to the beer, and the desired flavoring goals. This is definitely one of the best within the Southern Tier Imperial Stout series.","TheBrewo","Apr 27, 2012"

This beer smells absolutely incredible, with an aroma of vanilla and caramelized sugar that is as close to actual creme brulee as I can imagine. The flavor is likewise dominated by vanilla and caramel, which isn't as pleasant as it is in the aroma, and there is also some earthy, dark roasted malts and an undercurrent of booze that don't connect well with the decadent sweetness. The texture is pleasant enough, with a light carbonation to help break up the dense, sweet flavor profile. In the end, though, despite the unique flavor profile, the distinctive, potent sweetness is just too much, and I likely won't be picking this one up again.","devilben02","Nov 05, 2011"

Really remarkable - exceptional, really - is the aroma. The sweet, dessert-like aroma is unlike almost any other beer. I was afraid that the aroma would be artificial, with too much vanilla, but somehow this strikes a wonderful balance between the creamy, malted-milk qualiities of a milk stout and huge proportions of vanilla. It's intense, sense-grabbing, and fantastic. I love it. It's like a chocolate malt, woody-vanilla, and cream pie....creme brulee, indeed. Some toasty, roasty scents are present as well. It's one of those beers that you get a kick out of just sniffing. The flavor is strong, with a firm bitterness that provides some balance. Sweet on the lips. Thick and intense, but not cloying. Huge, hefty body. Spectacularly satisfying!","Suds","Oct 28, 2011"

4.08,4.6,3,5,4.5,3,3,"Pitch black pour with a minor, flimsy tan head that forms and disappears. Nose is assaulted with caramel, butterscotch, toffee, and booze. Taste consists of caramel and toffee piled upon some roasty and chocolate style malt, a touch of bakers chocolate and a hefty dose of butterscotch. Sweet caramel makes its way out again towards the slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel was light and slightly watery with an average carb presence. Overall, I wish I would have split this one with somebody, it was a challenge to finish the entire bottle. It smells great and the taste follows suit with the label, but this beer just wasn't for me.

Smells like dessert and gives me a craving for chewy caramel candy. Tons of sweet caramel, toffee, and brûlée. Taste is just as sweet. German chocolate cake with toffee and vanilla. A TON of caramel. Hints of overly sweet chocolate. Sugar bomb. Slight warming booze as it warms. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very rich. Drinkability...now this is where this beer fails.

3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Right off the bat, this brew reminds me of the dessert that this brew is aimed to be like. Black as night with minimal tan head and oily lacing. The nose is definintely smelling like creme brulee. Toasted malt and marshmallow, cocoa, and sweet vanilla. The taste is like a liquid dessert with alcohol added. Toasty, sweet, and pretty damn tasty, in much needed moderation of course. This beer is sweet and beastly. The mouthfeel is creamy and sticky, not super thicm as expected but enjoyable.

Not surprising for a beer this size. Smell- Worthers original! Butterscotch, a candy-like vanilla. Some faint coffee aroma. Vanilla bean prominent. This is the biggest candy smell I have ever had in a beer. Taste- like I am drinking vanilla extract with a Worthers in my mouth. Borderline overpowering candy. I think I miss the chocolate mocha taste I like so much in stouts. This one is 90% vanilla extract, 10% chocolate. I'm a little dissapointed...they could have done so much more with this beer. Its just too one-sided. I can see this be disgusting if it really warmed up (I opened it up out of my cellar at 55 degrees).

A super strong vanilla aroma hits you before even getting your nose near the glass. Let there be no mistake…this is the most vanilla filled aroma nose I ever whiffed. First sip has all the vanilla the nose had plus some chocolate, caramel, and roasted malts. There’s a touch of coffee bitterness that tries but fails to offset and balance the vanilla sweetness but is welcomed nonetheless. The dominating vanilla tastes pure like Breyers ice-cream. In fact if I had some Breyers I would drop a scoop in without hesitation. Body is a tad thin but still rather creamy and along with proper carbonation, mouthfeel is quite good. ABV is super well hidden. I’m glad I only have a bomber to kill and not a growler or a keg.","ATLbeerDog","Sep 18, 2011"

The smell is overwhelming of sweet vanilla and carmel with a little hint of coffee. Initial taste is strange to me. More sweet than any beer I have ever had with burnt tastes at the end that i generally don't enjoy but balances this beer out with the sweetness. With the burnt tastes comes the bitterness which i do not enjoy the more i drink it. The mouthfeel is very smooth with nothing objectionable about it. I enjoy this beer but not more than a bombers worth. Gets old quickly and has the most simply complex taste i have ever had. By that i mean that there are a lot of flavors but they are the same throughout and never keep you guessing. Overall a good beer.

The 'Trouble Brewing' comic entitled 'Choklat' basically says it all. I digress, on to the beer at hand... Creme Brulee pours a deep brown hue, and is obviously borderline syrupy, although it does sport a persistent cappuccino-like head. The smell and taste of this beer is fantastically decadent, in-league with the richest deserts conceivable. Basically, its flavor is similar to its namesake, or to, say, a Werther's Caramel-flavored Monin Syrup, except a Stout version of the aforementioned, and it is about as syrupy-viscous as conceivable. This is, however, beer we are talking about here, and so the hugely confectionery element that this brew brings to the plate requires an adjustment of parameters to enjoy.

A lot going on in the aroma department, lots of sweet caramel smells; toffee, butterscotch, some nuttiness, and subtle vanilla cream comes through in the end. Tastes just as it smells, a whole lot of carmel maillards. It really socked my taste buds with toffee and butterscotch at first, then a creaminess settles in that finishes with a slight bitterness that lingers on the tongue. After my palate recalibrated itself to the initial intensity of the caramel flavors did the vanilla come through. The mouthfeel is what I might describe as molasses, it really coats the mouth, I can still feel the sugars on my lips as I write this review. It is good, and clears the mouth relatively well for such sweetness, but it is a lot to take in. I shared a bottle of this with my wife for dessert, definitely glad I did not have this one to myself.

It's sweet but not cloyingly so, at least to this drinker, although others may and definitely have found this one to be way to much for their palettes.

Sure, an imperial stout has all the makings of a rich dessert, but can it capture the flavor of the classic European custard? I bought it, I poured it, I sniffed it, and I was halfway convinced. It smelled remarkably like the real deal. I was only slightly surprised that it bore no head even with a slightly vigorous pour. With extreme agitation I managed to whip up a mocha colored head. With that, I sipped upon this brew-lee with great satisfaction. The mouthfeel was quite pleasant and the taste was remarkably like creme brulee and less like the straight vanilla bean. A slight booziness lingered on my tongue as I took in a light stout flavor as the almost saccharine vanilla began to subside. Is it perfect? No. Is it a fantastic endeavor? Indeed, yes, it is.

I can neither fathom nor adequately describe the amount of sugar in the brew, nor can I stress enough that this tastes nothing like beer. I've tried dozens of beers-that-taste-like-something-else, but none have been so complete and delicious as this. No doubt some will criticize this stout for not tasting like beer, but I think it's marvelous.

Taste is a bit different than I was expecting. Up front there is a pretty bitter roasted malt taste that develops into a sweet cream, vanilla, and caramelized sugar aftertaste. The bitterness fades after each sip leaving the creme brulee flavors on the palate. This beer is definitely less sweet than it smells. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer that smells and tastes very similar to the creme brulee dessert.

4.92,26.2,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Creme Brulee Imperial Milk Stout is an excellent dessert beer, NOT a session beer at all. I've only seen this available in large pint bottles and is a seasonal summer release brewed by the wonderfully creative folks at Southern Tier. Pours a dark brown with decent clarity and a negligible head. The smell/nose is INCREDIBLE! The second you pour this your slapped in the face with overwhelming aromas of real vanilla beans. A first sip confirms what you smell and the back notes are full of toffee, java, and roasted nuts. The [mouth] feel is very common of other milk stouts; creamy with an appropriate amount of carbonation. The only downfall to this is that it is overwhelming after a while(as any real creme brulee is). If you like vanilla and good coffee I highly recommend this, I also recommend that you split it with some friends as the ABV is around 10% and finishing a whole pint yourself will leave you feeling a little gluttonous.","RashyGrillCook","0"

Very good smooth stout, however it becomes more harsh as it heats up. Definitely serving it at 42 like described is a good idea.

The added sweetness by lactose is fantastic, as lactose is an unfermentable sugar, so you're definitely drinking sugar. The taste of caramel and vanilla carries right over, and the sweetness hides the alcohol content. You expect this to be a dark beer with mysterious ingredients, but I can't smell or taste anything that isn't labeled on the side of the bottle, as hard as I try to believe they have a secret ingredient. The carbonation is there, but very light...almost creamy like a nitrogenated beer, so big plus for that. I wouldn't even say it's quite a medium-bodied beer, and doesn't stick to the inside of your mouth -- which is a feel of beer that I prefer in darker beers.

The flavor pretty much followed the nose only some of the flavors were much stronger than the others. This one hides its alcohol very well.

I feel like I'm drinking a glass of caramel, after a few sips this will be a bit much. I also wish there was a little more to this.

It wasn't the heaviest of stouts and was medium bodied as far as stouts go. I split this 650ml bottle with a friend and even then it was a little much. It is too sweet and drinking one of these would be pretty hard to do. It's very much like toffee and butterscotch and I'm not a huge fan of those flavors, but it does taste good.

As I poured the hazy dark red/brown brew into the glass a finger width carmel head appeared. As the head dissipated and laced its way around the glass, I noticed that light barely penetrated through the ruby red haze. The smell was intoxicating. The Aroma of Creme Brulee dominated along with a hint of caramel. The taste of caramel sweetness hits the pallet along with a heavy dose of malts followed by pronounced hop bitterness. The taste of alcohol is present as all the flavors blended together like Creme Brulee mixed with rum! The unique style, American Double/Imperial Stout has been brought to fruition! The mouthfeel was rich, heavy and sticky. The thickness of the beer adds to the dessert like experience. The dessert, Creme Brulee is never served in great quantities due to its richness. Just like this beer, rich in character, is meant to be savored in small quantities. Drinking this beer was a great experience, one that I would highly recommend.

When enjoyed in too large of a quantity it starts feeling and tasting unpleasant. It is so sweet that it starts cloying. But I'm ok with this beer. If it is supposed to invoke creme brulee then it should be enjoyed in moderation like its namesake. Generally it is served in small ceramic dishes...so I'll stick with just a small snifter full of this beer to sip on.","dpodratsky3","Jul 27, 2010"

I find it somewhat hard to judge the taste since it's very unique and complex - but it's just overwhelming. It is medium-thick-bodied and seems somewhat syrupy, but this might just be a result of the mental association with the sweet taste.

You know, sweet breads and whatnot. If I could literally eat smells, this would near the top of my list in terms of desireability. Happily intrigued, a taste must be had. A lot of the sweeter notes are still there, but are subdued, allowing some light roasted malts to come through, ensuring a more well-rounded, if somewhat weaker, tasting experience. The body is a rather hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rich, velevety feel. Damn, I enjoy this brew.

Vanilla and caramelized sugar hit you smack in the face. Extremely sweet nose that also carries just a hint of chocolate, but not really any roastyness. It really does smell like crème' Brulee' . Taking a sip reveals a beer that has a lot more going on. Still plenty of vanilla and caramel flavor, but also a chalky chocolate flavor that is not present in the namesake dessert, but works well with the other flavors. This is an extremely sweet beer, but unlike other cloyingly sweet stouts, it really seems to work here. Not picking up any hops at all, but there is an interesting sort of coconut flavor in there. I have to say, this much tastier than I was expecting. The body is quite full and sticky without the smoothness that often times help such sweet beers. It is not that bad though and I don't think it detracts too much. This is definitely a dessert beer, and is very drinkable when keeping that in mind. I cannot detect a hint of alcohol either.

It tastes to me like somebody pureed some creme brulee and added some alcohol. A 22 oz. bottle seems a bit extreme for this one, a bit much for one person to stomach quite frankly.

This beer is so sweet. I had read other accounts of it, and they're not exaggerating. Luckily I have a pretty big sweet tooth, so I really enjoyed it, but I could definitely understand if others can't stand it. It's a polarizing beer. It actually reminded me more of tiramisu than creme brulee, due to the hints of coffee. Still, despite the sweetness, I thought it was surprisingly complex (many different types of sweet) and enjoyable. It hid the alcohol super well, but this beer definitely needs to be sipped.

Thats all I really got out of it, there may have been a hint of coffee but the vanilla really stood out to me. Taste was the same though the coffee came through a bit more. Really sweet tasting, and honestly had a cream soda like taste to it which I'm not completely sure I'm down with haha. Overall not a bad taste just not what I really want to enjoy in a beer. Pretty good mouthfeel however, thick, which is what I want in a stout. Drinkability is average, above average at best. At leas the alcohol is hidden well. Not something I would drink a lot of in one night or even often. I may pick it up again but most likely I would pick up other Southern Tier products instead.

Could definately session this one if I had more of an alcohol tolerance as I once did, and the ABV is completely hidden @ 11.00%. I feel the thinness for the style helps in this aspect.

For some reason, when I first smelled this, I thought: pancakes with extra butter and syrup! It hints at creme brulee, but not quite an exact match. After smelling, the taste was a bit of a letdown - again, heavy on the vanilla with some light hints of coffee and alcohol. Its pretty sweet up front with a relatively lackluster finish. The mouthfeel is actually not as heavy as I thought it would be - actually a little thin in spots, and unfortunately doesn't lend to the idea of wanting to drink more (its just way too sweet for me).

Whereas the bottle begins with a flavor and aroma which are so robust and sweet that it may excite and entice at first then becomes a bit cloying and artificial, on-tap I immediately found these unpleasant qualities. There is a chalky quality to the taste which contrasts the sweetness but doesn't add any enjoyment to the drink. Drinkability suffers from these unpleasantries in the flavor and aroma. Overall, though, I'm willing to grant it 3.5's instead of below-average numbers because its certainly a better option thana lot of things and if you're in the mood for something very strong or generally enjoy sweetness it may be quite enjoyable. Like other ST stout offerings I'm finding the sort of artificial quality to the flavor shows through more on-tap. Its fun to try but I wouldn't want to drink a full pint's worth.","BirdFlu","Jul 20, 2009"

At first there is a pretty decent chocolate and dark malt flavors. However, those are quickly met with a harsh butterscotch and caramel. The artificial vanilla tasting hits you throughout, and the booziness doesn't help. I was hoping as it warmed, the tastes would become less harsh, but alas, it didn't. This is a heavy body, lighter carbonation, with a thick and creamy feel to it. I am generally a big fan of Southern Tier, but this beer was far off the mark for me.

The first sip hits like a ton of bricks with huge vanilla/butterscotch notes mixed with a light hint of alcohol. It really does taste like creme brulee. It's a thick beer, almost chewy mouthfeel. The finish is pleasant with the alcohol sneaking up at the end to finish off the almost too sweet taste. There is definitely no need for dessert if you're drinking this beer, it borders on being too sweet, but would go great with a slice of vanilla cake or custard pie.

Smelled of vanilla beans, birthday cake, and obviously of creme brulee. Southern Tier does a great job with using great aroma type hops in combination with unique add ins, which in this case saw Columbus hops paired with vanilla beans. Taste was candy sweet with a delicious vanilla and fudge after taste which seemed to linger on the taste buds. Detected a nice hidden bitterness, undoubtedly from the Horizon hops used. Mouthfeel was in the medium range. With sweet stouts, I would say that the mouthfeel was not quite as thick and creamy as Youngs Double Chocolate, but not as thin as Mackeson or Lancaster Milk Stout. In regards to drinkability, I would not have anymore than one of the 650 ml bottles that Southern Tier puts this in for several reasons. First of all, not only is this stuff 10 percent, but as with many other Southern Tier stouts (Oatmeal and Choklat) the alcohol is very well hidden beneath the sweet, candy like flavor. In short, this stuff will knock you on your butt if you are not careful. Secondly, one would probably not want to drink too much of this because of the intense sweetness. Being a stout drinker, I generally have one of these and follow up with a nice hoppy stout or porter like Guiness or Victory Storm King. Overall, the more and more I drink Souther Tier beers, the more I appreciate their craftsmanship and orginiality. It is a shame that this is a seasonal as I just happened to luck out and find a bottle at a local liquor outfit. The new batch comes out in June and I plan stockpile!!! I may even try and save a Choklat and mix the two together! A great sweet stout...highly recommended","scott27","Jan 29, 2009"

Taste was amazingly like the actual dessert, huge caramelized sugar, vanilla, roasted malt, wow. A party for the taste buds, but perhaps a touch sweet for some? Mouthfeel was great, with much carbonation to coat all surfaces. Drinkability is a little limited, first due to the very high ABV, but also this can get a little much with the rich taste toward the end of the glass.

The taste is similar, with an even more burnt aftertaste, and big, rich vanilla and cream flavors. Very sweet, but an uncanny replica of creme brulee in a glass- with a shot of brandy.

The 10 ounce glass was probably just the right serving, as it is sweet and any more would have been just a touch too much. It's really a dessert beer, although I enjoyed it right at the bar none the less. Massive amounts of vanilla, caramel, and sweetish, cocoa-accented malts are found in the nose. It actually kind of smells like cake! And that carries over into the flavor. Vanilla. Caramel. Cocoa. Sugar. Butter. Chocolate. And just an edge of roastiness underneath. It's sweet but it somehow manages to keep from becoming cloying, and that's at least due in part to the roasted malts. Remarkably smooth. Creamy. Utterly (pun intended) remarkable. That said, this is a very special beer, and would be perfect for special occassions. Valentines day. Christmas. And it makes an undeniable eye-opener for women who ""don't like beer"".

Very milk, and vanilla like with some light hops that quiver at the onslaught of malt warriors overtaking their feeble vines. They fight valiantly, but the Maltacians rape and pillage their weak cones leaving them tattered, vulnerable and succeptible to disease. The hops are crying and the malts continue to shower them with more sugar bombs, oblivious to their screams. NOOOO!!!! I literally saw a hop cone beheaded by a caramel square that jumped out of this beer with a maltsword. Very artificial and gimmicky and tastes more like melted caramel and vanilla extract that creme brulee. Cloying in the smell alone. What the fuck is going on here?!?!?

Needs to coat and hang on the tongue, IMO. Leaves the mouth vacant with woody-like grit on the tongue. Gives a perception that the earlier flavors were empty.

The taste continues the sweetness and is pretty one-dimensional in that respect. There is the milk and malt background but it's really about the huge caramel, butterscotch and vanilla tastes which overpower all else. The mouthfeel is very sticky, chewy even, with the sweetness just sticking to the mouth. This is an OK stout but I'd put it near the bottom of the Southern Tier Impy Series.

It's not that it's bad, and the aftertaste is very enjoyable. It's just that it is WAY over the top sweet. Mouthfeel is very thick and oily, not too much carbonation, very slick. Coats the mouth.

As the beer warmed, the butterscotch taste became more pronounced and almost artificial in taste. It was nearly unbearable. I like big off-beat beers, but this one misses the mark for me.

Smell is pretty extreme (a bit much actually) vanilla extract, Werther's Original candy, with a touch of smoke. Coffee and butter (blah) with lots of sugar in the nose as well. Taste begins pretty boozy from start to finish with similarities to Amaretto and Bailey's. Lots of lactose and carmelized sugars midway with super sweet white chocolate. Aftertaste is slightly bitter with more vanilla and sugars. I really don't want to know the calories in an entire bottle of this beer, may be quite scary. A big full bodied stout that's silky smooth in the mouth. A surprisingly medium carbonation which I could use less of. This beer is just insane, plain and simple. No way can I finish this bomber tonight, I'd rather not gain a few pounds. Southern Tier makes pretty outrageous beers and this is no exception. This a beer to be shared, hopefully future BA's read these reviews and understand that down the road. Choklat is still the Black Water Series champion in my eyes.

Vanilla is overwhelming. Subtle hints of toffee, custard and a bit of heat from the alcohol. The taste is vanilla custard. Sweet lacto, coffee and a hint of caramelized sugars comes through on the tail of the beer. I found it really interesting that they got the caramelized sugar aspect of crème brulee to come across in the finish of the beer. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and honestly, astringent.

There is more graham cracker, and milk chocolate. There is also the addition of a lingering roasted malt bitterness in the finish.

The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, with a strong vanilla aftertaste. If I was a big vanilla fan I'd give this beer 5's across the board, but it's a flavor I can only take in small portions.

It tastes pretty much like it smells, but with the addition of some roasted/burnt malt and a bit of chocolate. The tastes starts off sweet, but there's some bitterness in the finish. With that being said, it's still a mostly sweet brew by far. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's very creamy, rich and smooth. Alcohol isn't very noticable. Drinkability is pretty good too, but I don't think I could drink more than a bomber of this at a time.

The aroma definitely satisfied any dessert fix that I might have wanted, but ""strangely"" I find the flavors not quite rich enough as this could use more roast malt flavors and a thicker, more complex malt base. That strangely in that last sentence is important, because if I was not ready for the overbearing vanilla and sweetness here I likely would have found this beer a sickly sweet, train wreck of an Imperial Stout; properly forewarned & with the right occasion, this beer, while overly simplistic, is not quite half bad and is even enjoyable if had in small doses.","Gueuzedude","Aug 01, 2008"

I can appreciate how well crafted this is, but the chosen component to highlight (vanilla) is not one that I care for in this quantity. For me, it just doesn't work terribly well. In fact, I think this is a huge miss. I think I may have to put a stopper in this bomber and revisit later, because there is no way I can finish this in a single evening, if at all.

This is like nothing I've ever tasted. I could swear there's a vanilla bean floating in my drink. Very creamy and smooth on the tongue. Carbonation is low, but that's good for this desert beer.

It's pour was absent of a head. It does have a very distinctive nose, that of sweet caramel(how did they do that?). Taste, well it as close as can be to handing you a spoon to crack the burnt sugar crust from the top of the glass as one can get. The question begs to be asked; is that really a creme brulee nose or have we gone way over the top with vanilla?, is it aged in wood giving off the vanilla?, is it extract?, or did they dare to use vanilla bean? Which ever this beer has a sweetness throughout that I thought the alcohol would balance off. All I get, almost all the way though, is that singular taste of creme caramel, with a sweet vanilla taste that leads into the finish. This beer is a one trick pony, I was looking for balance but got one flavor, yes a very good flavor and one which I personally like for it's named after one of my favorite desserts but, Is this what a beer should be? Shouldn't it be like a great piece of literature, a beginning a middle and an end? This beer has a beginning the nose of sweetness, a middle of creamy vanilla custard, with no end.

The taste is of butterscotch but has more of a vanilla presence, perhaps a touch of rum flavor. Some woody roasted malt flavors peek through towards the end. Does it taste exactly like creme brulee, no, similar, somewhat. This is more butterscotch than vanilla and caramlized/burnt sugar. The taste is similar to that of Kahlua, somewhat like a white russian. The feel is big and well bodied with soft carbonation that gives it a silky texture. The brew finishes sweet and bitter; a tad sticky. A big bold brew for sure. Plenty of huge aromas and flavors. Its sweet, almost cloying if you have too much.

4.52,15.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Edit: Have sample this several more times, and have found the drinkability scale to have gone down for me a bit. Just finding it too rich to really quaff well. Also, the flavors have risen on the sweeter scale for me...changing palate I suppose. Still wonderful stuff!","Nickls","Jul 17, 2008"
4.27,9.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Another winner in the series. ST definitely hits a home run here after a little bit of a letdown for those who thought that the Imperial Cherry Saison should have had bolder cherry tones. Upward and onward to Pumpking!","Beerisheaven","Jul 17, 2008"
4.72,21,4.5,5,5,4.5,4,"Creme Brulee pours a beautiful dark dark brown color with some red highlights. A sticky, quickly dissapating head fills up a bunch of the pint glass when I pour. The aroma is overwhelming, really beautiful. Huge vanilla and cream smells, as intense as the Jah-va and Choklat Black Water brews before it. A rich, intense beer drinking experience -- no real hints of the huge ABV here. Pretty easy drinking mouthfeel and carbonation wise, but the flavor is so intense that I would be shocked if someone could drink two of these in a row. Kind of like eating two creme brulees in a row -- why even try? A wonderful beer with a lot of killer qualities that could easily be cloying and terrible but just isn't. Another winner from ST.","brewdogmrb","Jul 17, 2008"
4.32,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Taste is just like the smell. Almost like caramel ice cream, deep, rich vanilla notes, with just a hint of dark malt. Very slight carbonation and a rich and slick mouthfeel. Definitely a sipping beer which gets better as it warms up. Southern Tier is going into uncharted waters and making some damn fine beers.","kirok1999","Jul 17, 2008"
4.75,21.8,5,5,5,4.5,4,"Going into my top three, along with Ommegang's Chocolate Indulgence and Lindeman's Framboise.","mirdreams","Jul 16, 2008"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"I took my time with this guy as I wanted to savor it, and it took me nearly two hours to get through the whole bottle. I wasn't struggling by any means, it is just such a rich flavor profile that I really had to slow my pace.","ColForbinBC","Jul 15, 2008"
4.57,17.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Lower carbonation with a flavor that completely coats the palate. Almost viscous without the cloying qualities. This is what extreme beer is all about. Not to be consumed with dessert, but as dessert.","brantadid","Jul 15, 2008"
4.4,12.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"S--Smell is absolutely outstanding butterscotch, tons of Vanilla and a faint tootsie roll smell. T&M--Taste is fantastic. Loads of sweet vanilla, burnt sugars, chocolate and a tad of butterscotch round this out with a nice alcohol creaminess on the finish. As far as drinkability goes I gave it a 4 , This beer is a little rich and very sweet but it is also quite drinkable considering it's hefty 10% ABV. All in All, another fantastic beer from Southern Tier's black water Series. I would recommend anyone to buy this one as soon as they can, because I'm sure there will be a ton of Beer trekys stockpiling it in the next few weeks.","ABHatter","Jul 15, 2008"
4.77,22.3,4.5,5,5,5,4,"As long as you have taste buds you'll enjoy this. Its like no other beer I've ever had. Has to be the best desert beer out there. If you can drink more than one of these though you are my hero. Its a very filling beer. Job well done Southern Tier.","dick783","Jul 13, 2008"
4.67,19.7,4.5,5,5,4,4,"D: This may be the most ""tastiest"" beer I've ever had. It ranks right up there w/ Utopias because of its uniqueness. But I have a feeling one (okay two) and done - it had to rhyme right? How about two and thru.","gkatsoris","Jul 11, 2008"
4.56,16.9,3.5,5,5,4.5,3.5,"Pours black, with the faintest brown highlights at the edges, small tan head fades pretty quickly and doesn't leave much in the way of lacing. The smell? In all likelihood, this is the most impressive smelling beer I've ever had....the vanilla bean is just exploding out of the glass, sweet melting butterscotch, and just a tiny bit of milk chocolate trying to claw its way through the vanilla bean. Taste is all about the bean! Crazy amount of vanilla bean flavor, just overwhelms the palate with its sweetness...this truly is a dessert beer. A touch of alcohol taste on the back end, nothing overt. Silky mouthfeel, not too sticky given all the sweetness. At 10%, this one is perfect for sharing. Really just a fantastic effort from Southern Tier. Wow!","corey0212","Beers"
4.62,18.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"edit: had on tap at sunset bar and grill and flavors were pretty different. the sweetness was much more mild and the maltiness came out a bit more. it also had a drier feel to it. still good but a good drop off from the bottle.","ph2001","0"
