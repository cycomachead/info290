Marshmallows, malted milk balls, and nuts.  Nice mocha flavor with plenty of deep coffee bean roast and less chocolate than the aroma.  Chocolate, nuts, and lactose sweetness that never gets cloying, finishing with some lingering berries.  Feels a little better than medium, fluffy in texture, drying out in the end.  Very nice.  A quality blend of fresh dark coffee and chocolate syrup.","wedge","Dec 28, 2014"

Amp up the body a bit and this one would really stand out for me.  I have enjoyed most of the Terrapin limited releases lately and this is no exception - actually probably towards the top of the list for me.","portia99","Nov 26, 2014"

I wouldn't drink this again, but glad I had the chance to try it. It's well crafted just not all what I thought it was going to be. I say, try it. See if its to your liking.
