"So bold and full flavored. Great pour and rich taste."

"Pours a very dark brown that's settles with a black body and a frothy mocha colored head. Aroma is roasted malts, milk chocolate, sugary vanilla and a dash of coffee. Taste includes flavors of sweet malt, milk chocolate and hints of bitter coffee. Mouthfeel is creamy and frothy with a medium body. Very good example of the style with pronounced flavors for a 5.6% abv beer. Well done."

"My first taste of Tree House beer. A delicious milk stout. A surprisingly full mouthfeel for such a low ABV stout."

"Overall- Really good milk stout with a surprising amount of roasted malts and coffee flavors, but which are balanced nicely by subtle vanilla and chocolate.  Well worth picking up when at Treehouse brewery."

"I am sucker for Left Hand's Milk Stout and pretty much use that to gauge the style. This is definitely the best local example of Milk Stout I have had and perhaps second best to Left Hand so far for me. That doesn't count beers like Life Is Like and Xocoveza because those are pretty much Imperial Stouts with some lactose."

"That's What She Said is an amazingly tasty and immensely quaffable milk stout. Leave it to the folks at Tree House to take a typically pedestrian style and make it awesome."

"I prefer a more """standard""" (not """sweet""" or """milk""") stout but the sweetness is not overpowering here.  It's a meal with a gorgeous head, no complaints, quality stuff."

"As far as a milk stout goes, this is near the top. Certainly very drinkable and one of the best in the style."

"O - Overall, not a bad milk stout. Nice lactose and chocolate notes, easy drinking. Would be a fine stout to drink in the warmer months."

"Pours black with dark brown highlights around the edges. Soft, khaki head. It's a thick blanket of small bubbles. Great lacing, good head retention. Lots of chocolate in the aroma with some gentle roast. Nice lactic edge. Loads of milk chocolate. The taste is similar. It's medium sweet with lots of cocoa flavor. The relatively mild lactic note keeps the beer from getting cloying. Plus, there is very little of the cola flavor that I tend to find a bit overbearing in other examples. Mouthfeel is creamy and gentle. They filled this growler right up to the top, leaving nearly zero head space, and the beer kept very well. Pretty much perfect for the style. Very impressive stuff. I'm not the biggest milk stout fan, but this is just how I like them."

"The taste is big on the coffee. Almost like a cafe au lait. Mmmm"

"Poured from a 750mL growler into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, ruby highlighted, blackish color with a frothy, light, creamy tan colored head that quickly settles into a chunky, sparse, surface coating. Aromas of dark roast coffee, sweet caramel, smoke, dark chocolate, a touch of char/campfire, and a hint of cream. Smells like a bitter, robust, rich beer. Flavors are cream forward, quickly underscored by a bitter roast coffee character. Chocolate and caramel blend in the backbone to sweeten the brew a bit further, but the scales still tip to bitter and smoky. This is a campfire beer, and a very drinkable one, at that. Tasty. Light, smooth body that is slightly dry to remain within the style parameters. The aftertaste is cream and coffee, with a touch of the campfire smoke still present. Slick, slightly bitter, dry finish. This is a good, solid, drinkable beer."
"Excellently crafted. I love this beer and will drive the hour from Boston again soon."

"O: This is the essence of a Milk Stout. Outta bounds. So delicious. Everything that you want is there and more. Great name for the beer, too. Tree House....stop it! This is the style...nailed!"

"I had this again after a long while. Wow!  I dare you to name me a better milk stout."
""
""
"O: All in all, nice light flavors as expected from a lower ABV brew, but lots of flavors bouncing around each balanced very well. Great introduction to this new brewery."

"O: It's a pretty classic milk stout. Solid enough, but a few minor tweaks would go a long way to enhance the drinkability. Stiffer carbontaion would provide the lift that the body needs."
"Overall pretty nice, very creamy lactose, a bit of choc/cocoa, decent malt profile, nice light but noticeable hops, tasty and very drinkable."

"A well made milk stout with a unique spin highlighting roast/coffee over top of the lactose sugar. This works really well and I can see why this is so popular."
""
""
""
"O- I really wish I bought to growlers of this stuff as the 750ml was definitely not enough. This was very tasty and had an extremely nice balance to it. I could easily drink multiple glasses of this and it is definitely one of the better local MA beers being produced. I definitely recommend checking it out as well as other beers from Tree House."

"Taste follows the nose, coffee and sweet chocolate, closes lightly bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy. Another good one from Tree House."
