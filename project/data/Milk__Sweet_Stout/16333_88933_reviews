"liked this maybe more than snow drift,but it is a little bitter,(only could get at guus a local tavern)"
""
""
"I LOVED this beer. It was pretty thin and drank more like a session stout, but the nose and taste was spectacular. Really strong notes of vanilla and coffee throughout. Very enjooyable and drinkable."
""
""
"This beer was a major disappointment"
"Poured from a tallboy into a glass. Nice dark body. Sweet slightly roasted aroma. Tasty beer. some notes of coffee and chocolate with a lot of vanilla flavor."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very tasty sweet stout that does not overdue it. The 16oz can is a cherry on top of this great dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Seek this one out if you want something that is sweet and enjoyable but definitely not cloying. Very cool beer. Thanks so much for sending this one as an extra!"
""
"Regular Buffalo Sweat is a very good stout, and the vanilla bean variety does not disappoint. I wish I had regular access to this; delicious!"
"Overall: Thus far, I've been in areas where this beer sees distribution twice, and I brought some home both times. It's a rather refreshing adjunct milk stout, almost what one could term a """session dessert beer""" as far as drinkability is concerned. I'm a fan."
""
""
""
"Overall:  I’m conflicted on this beer.  The base Buffalo Sweat Stout is fantastic, and this beer has all of the fantastic, base Buffalo Sweat Stout flavors, however, because this is billed a vanilla bean variant, brewed with vanilla beans, and because there is very little vanilla in both aroma and taste, this beer comes in more than a little disappointing.  It needs more vanilla."
"Overall - Condor recommended and approved. For a small brewery located in essence in Nowheresville, Kansas, Tallgrass really has some solid offerings, anchored by the Buffalo Sweat line. I also enjoy the 8-Bit Pale Ale. The have carved a niche out for themselves, I hope to see them do well and expand their product lines before too long."

"Not as sweet as most which is not a bad thing."

""
"Overall a very nice brew although I still prefer the original Buffalo Sweat, this was enjoyable."
"Smelled the vanilla in this one, which can be hard to pick out of a stout.  The flavor was nice, very close to a peanut butter to me.  Better than the regular version imo."

"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, chocolate, some vanilla. Taste is rich, chocolate, vanilla, a bit of malts, somewhat sweet and very flavorful. Feels creamy in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"O - A solid sweet stout to say the least, and an improvement over the standard Buffalo Sweat (which I also enjoy). The vanilla adds a lot of sweetness and though I wouldn't drink this regularly, it's a very nice change of pace from heavier, boozier stouts out there"
""

"My go to winter beer. creamy smooth perfect balance of coffee and vanilla"

"O- The vanilla kills this beer. It was poorly done, overly sweat and destroys any balance."
""
""
"(O)- A solid variation with the vanilla added. Not overly sweet yet with plenty of richness."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Had a tallboy of this in a wine shop after a nice plate of chicken vesuvio at the Italian restaurant next door, and it really hit the spot. A fine stout that I hadn't had before but will definitely try again."
""
""
""
""
"This pours a dark brown color with a foamy, light brown head. The aroma is sweet with malts, coffee, and molasses but not much of a vanilla smell. The taste is smooth, sweet, and robust. The texture is lighter and not as thick or heavy as the regular Buffalo Sweat. There is a slight hint of vanilla, but it’s not as evident as other vanilla stouts in the market."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice stout; so rich and roasty and the vanilla plays well of the roastiness; I just wish the flavors came together a bit better with something to balance the sweet finish of that vanilla"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its alright."
""
""
"Complex yet easy drinking ale works fine with me."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a very disappointing beer. I really tried to give this one a chance, it was initially chilled and as I drank allowed it to warm to see if it would change in flavor depth and complexity... all I got was a vanilla chocolate fizziness. Perhaps I had a bad batch? But I'm a little afraid to try it again when there are so many other outstanding beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fits the stout family nicely, very dark, very smooth, a creaminess to it, the chocolate/coffee taste is there, the overall flavor is wonderful, the only thing lacking in this one is the same as the regular Buffalo Sweat is in the body, it's a bit thin. Imagining this beer as an imperial stout makes me dream, it would be world-class I think... hopefully someday such a version of this from Tallgrass will exist!"

"This is an excellent, easy drinking stout with good vanilla flavor.  Low abv means you can enjoy multiple of these at one setting.  My favorite from Tallgrass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bitch black in color, and is darker than their oatmeal Stout. A thin beige head is seen with some spotty lacing. The aroma is of roasted malts, oatmeal with a hint of vanilla and coffee. The taste is about the same and is like a vanilla latte even. Very smooth with great flavor and creaminess. Goes down easy with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. Here is another great brew from this company."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark as night and impenetrable to light. A good half inch head of khaki colored foam rests on top. Aroma of oatmeal with a hint of vanilla. There's a bit of a coffee note present. The body seems a bit thin for what I'm looking at. The taste is initially dark malt and oats and then it quickly fades. Perhaps it needs a bit more body or bittering hops to get to the next level."
"$9 for a 4pk of 16 oz cans"

"You wanna end a drought with a solid beer, you wouldn't be alone to choose a variant of the fantastic Buffalo Sweat. This one looks just like its progenitor, a garnet-tinged brown topped by a finger of slate foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild cocoa, sweet coffee beans, a stiff vein of vanilla bean, and a touch of heavy cream. The taste brings in more of the same, with the vanilla doing what it's supposed to do and serving as an extra topping, rather than o'erpowering the base. The coffee shines through fairly strongly here, but in a good way, playing quite nicely with the vanilla. The body is a staunch medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a smooth feel, and a nearly drying finish. Overall, a damn fine beer, one I hope to have plenty of in the coming months."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Accessible, not expensive, and a nice vanilla bean presence in an otherwise solid stout base. Would definitely be willing to drink again if I see this on tap."

"Enjoy"

"O- Overall, I would definitely drink this one again. Love the amount of vanilla in this bad boy. Quite tasty, just how I figured it would be."
""
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this beer. I rated it pretty high. It is outside of my zone, but if I saw a four pack (not sure how they sell it) I would buy one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this should be the standard for sweet stouts. Primarily sweet, yet with some dark flavors thrown in there, all without being an imperial makes this a beer I want to drink several of in a sitting."

"O: Fantastic beer from Tallgrass. The original Buffalo Sweat is great but the vanilla bean adds more great character to an already solid oatmeal stout. Glad I've got three more of these bad boys!"

"Mouthfeel is good. Body is on the lighter side for a stout but it's not claiming to be imperial/double and it really showcases all the decadent flavors while still remaining sessionable and drinkable"
""
""
""
"Dark brown color, nice head. Smell is IN YOUR FACE vanilla and not much else. Huge, huge vanilla aroma here. The taste of this beer is also massively infused with vanilla, but it doesnt taste artifical like a lot of beers with vanilla added, it tastes legit. The chocolate is also there of course, but the vanilla is what really stands out here. Extremely creamy beer as well, the body is not heavy whatsoever. That may be a detractor in some cases but here it works very well. Very much recommended if youre a fan of vanilla."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really dig this offering from Tallgrass. If this was readily available in my area, I would have it in my regular rotation. A very easy drinking, enticing stout. Absolutely love the smell of this one. Recommend if you are a fan of vanilla and stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice stout with some vanilla to add complexity. I'll have to try the regular Buffalo Sweat stout at some point."

"Pours out REALLY dark brown/black with really healthy head that was REALLY light brown/whitish that had really good retention. Smell is of dark fruit and some sweetness and a tiny bit of vanilla. Taste is pretty mellow as far as a stout but quite tastey. Definitely taste all the things from the nose but quite a bit more vanilla really makes it tasty. Mouthfeel is pretty thin as one would expect from a low ABV stout - right on for the style. Really a good beer. It's hard to not like something with vanilla."
""
"I'd never even heard of Tallgrass before moving to StL, but I must say I've thoroughly enjoyed pretty much every offering of theirs I've had. As I noted up top, I appreciate their base Buffalo Sweat, and I like a well done vanilla brew (personal preference: I prefer the flavour of vanilla bean to... extract or whatever the other ways of presenting it are. It just seems rounder, creamier, oilier... I don't really know how to explain it, just that it appeals more to me). This is a combination of a good base beer modified well. I don't know if you can get it outside of their variety 8 pack, but even if you can't it's well worth it (I mean, Ethos, 8-Bit and regular Buffalo Sweat are also super delicious, so there's no filler there)."
"Tallgrass Vanilla Bean Buffalo Sweat ---4/5."
""
"Neither terribly filling nor high alcohol could make this a fairly sessionable brew. Balanced and flavorful but not over the top. Despite my normal dislike of this brewery, this one met my expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
"High B-"
"Overall: A definite improvement over the base beer. Now how about a Double version?"

"If you are on the fence about getting it, I would, its not bad by any means. Cheers!"
""
"The vanilla bean has sweetened up this already good stout. However, the vanilla character is not nearly as robust or decadent as one could imagine. And that roasted quality of Buffalo Sweat is in no way diminished by the addition of vanilla. If anything, it takes away slightly from the experience. Still, VBBS is a fine beer."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. Somewhat creamy. A very enjoyable beer."
""
"A worthy addition to all the stouts I have tried."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"O-interesting stout, lacks body and depth of flavor, but enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty low-ABV stout. My biggest complaint is that it's all vanilla, and no stout. If it were called """vanilla beer", that'd be okay. But as a vanilla stout, I'm a little disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another solid beer from Tallgrass. The vanilla might be a little much for some, it was pushing the threshold with me, but delivers what it claims."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - While I really enjoy the quality and flavor of Buffalo Sweat, the vanilla bean version doesn't add enough beyond the aroma for me to get jazzed up over. The interwoven aspects of spice and fruit to the aroma are exceptional but the incredible subtlety of flavor evolution leaves something to be desired. Certainly not a bad beer by any means, it just doesn't advance Buffalo Sweat in any significant way."
""
"It's significantly better than regular Buffalo Sweat."
"I am starting to dig Tallgrass anything. This is one beer that I could drink to try and get fucked up and enjoy it for ten minutes and then pass out."
"This is still though Buffalo sweat, a dry stout, which I don't know if this jives with vanilla."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Vanilla Bean Buffalo Sweat pours a black color, with a small lacing white head. Their is a nice roasted malty aroma, with hints of vanilla. The taste is the same, a nice sweet roasted malty backbone, with nice hints of vanilla. Good full flavors, and the vanilla is nice and mellow. Overall a nice vanilla flavored beer, enjoyable and easy to drink."
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a thin creamy tan head. Aromas of freshly prepared oatmeal and brown sugar. A little bit of coffee aroma in there as well. Taste begins with a slight smokey flavor, then some caramel, after that a hint of vanilla, then a big milk finish. The aftertaste is rather smoky. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a very nice sweet stout. Plenty of flavor in a relatifvely low ABV."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: A good Milk Stout with a nice hint of vanilla. I'm not sure if it's the cool logos on the cans or the low price point but TallGrass brews always seem to catch my eye in the store. I'd be interested to try this one next to the original Buffalo Sweat. Would I drink it again? Sure."

"O: A solid beer overall. Most low abv stouts are bland and watery, but this one is enjoyable."
""
"Overall: A very good milk/sweet stout. The vanilla beans add a nice shot of flavor."
""
""
"O: I wasn't a fan of the regular Buffalo Sweat, but this one made me a true believer. The vanilla beans smooth out the rough edges of regular BS and intensify the chocolate flavoring. A new favorite."
"'tis good!"
"O - Loaded down with vanilla bean, this beer just pops and really one I would reach for time & time again. The regular is good in its own right, but man-o-man that vanilla bean is much better!"
""
"Adds a nice dynamic. The coffe gets muted a bit, but th vanilla is good."
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light to medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Pretty good. Overall, I definitely prefer this to the original Buffalo Sweat, and I like the original. This is a pretty solid milk stout, and I will definitely look have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, not bad. Poured at a good temperature with a mammoth, foamy, brown head that quickly settled and no lace. Color is a very dark, dark brown. Aroma has very little vanilla, but does have hop, roast, malt, and a bit of earth. Flavor's like nose with hop more subdued, vanilla coming out a bit more, well balanced in kind of an odd way. Body is chewy, but despite the huge foam upon pouring, a little flat. Finish has an off vanilla thing that isn't an asset, longish and on one hand intriguing, but on the other, not. Curiously, weirdly - drinkable. Still trying to figure this out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good, and easy drinking. Love this one!"
"O- This beer is smooth smooth smooth. It's smooth in flavor from the vanilla as well as smooth in the feel. Everything about it is just smooth. That, coupled with the lower abv make this a very drinkable beer. I'm not completely sure if I like this better than the original or not, but I'm leaning towards a """yes""". Just like the original however I still feel like it leans more towards an oatmeal stout rather than a milk stout (although I definitely understand why it's classified as a milk stout.) This is a great beer if you enjoy vanilla."
"Overall: I like milk stouts and sweet stouts so this hit the spot. Nice vanilla flavor without being too sweet, nicely complementing the stout. Easy to drink and always good to see the cans."
"O - This is a very good beer. Love the addition of vanilla beans!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice head formation over this stout, though it settles down and doesn't leave much lacing. Very inviting aroma, sweet milk, molasses, and cocoa. Taste is on the lighter side but very drinkable (5%). Smooth and sweet, this milk stout goes down easily, and the addition of vanilla is a perfect touch. Subtlety done too. I was expecting a heavier hand with it. This is a light, easy-drinking stout. At the moment, I'd like more flavor, but if I had a few more in the fridge I'd probably enjoy it just fine. I would like to compare it to the original to see how different it is. Overall worth a try."
""
""
""
"This a nice iteration of the style, that hits most of the marks. Depending on my mood it would be a toss up if I drank this or the regular version, which I enjoy profusely. What I'm really hoping to see: Imperial Buffalo Sweat!"
"A good drinker and one that I could enjoy quite a bit, but nothing that strikes me as outstanding. I could see the original being aged in bourbon barrels as a preferable alternative."
""
""
""
""
"D/O- At 5%abv, the drinkability is through the roof, packs the flavor. Very good beginner stout in my opinion. One negative is that I don't find it too much different from the regular Buffalo Sweat, minor complaint though."
""
""
""
"Overall: Yeah they did exactly what they set out to do. Its buffalo sweat with more vanilla flavor. I think I like buffalo sweat and vanilla bean buffalo sweat equally. I am not sure that the addition of the vanilla beans really made buffalo sweat any better."
"O-just like tallgrass buffalo sweat this is a very creamy and richly flavored milk stout. Well done"
"Overall, I like it a lot because they get the vanilla down perfectly. But it's watery. Still worthy, and very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall, it goes down easily. It could use more aroma and have more body. I will buy more, but only because it is a limited run."
""
""
""
"The base Buffalo Sweat is in my opinion a greatly overlooked beer. High hopes for this one. Looks great, smells something like a boozy Nilla wafer. Tastes...like the inside of a can. The metal fades somewhat as it warms, but what rises up in its place is somewhat bitter. The vanilla gets lost in the shuffle. The beer has a lot going for it but comes up short where it matters most: Taste. Merely an OK beer, worth having at a reasonable price."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really easy drinking tasty beer. I was worried that the vanilla would be too prominent, but it blends really well with the chocolatey notes, without being too sweet. It would be quite easy to take down a full 4 pack in a night."
""
""
"So much flavor for a 5% beer. I just might drink the whole four pack. Truly a terrific milk stout offering here. I highly recommend this one."
