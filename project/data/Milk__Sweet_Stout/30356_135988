3.81,6.4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a thin, almost black coloring with no head. Aromas of roasted coffee, hints of cream, caramel, and toffee sweetness. Decently balanced aromas, with hints of smoke in there, too. Flavors are roasted forward, with a sweet blend of cream and caramel to follow. The backbone is bitter roasted coffee, supporting all the sweetness and making this a layered experience on the palate. Fairly smooth, light, dry bodied, with a sweet cream and caramel-chocolate mocha aftertaste. The finish has a subtle lactose linger on a dry feel. Not bad.","GarthDanielson","Monday at 05:53 PM"

Aroma is decent; sweet and slightly roasty with lactose sugars, milk chocolate, and some caramel. Probably the only good thing about this beer. Flavor tastes like water with milk chocolate mixed in.  Mouthfeel is offensively thin and prickly. If the watered down flavor didn't kill the beer, this horrible mouthfeel certainly would. Overall, I don't know what happened here but this one is no good. My impression is that this is the product of bad brewing, not a bad recipe. It will be a struggle to get through this 4 pack, and 2 of the bottles (if not 3) will likely be drainpours.","denver10","Mar 06, 2015"

The brew smells like milk and bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some dark fruit and a Nestle Quik/chocolate syrup mixed with milk flavor noticeable too.  Just too much of an artificial chocolate flavor.  I liked this when I first started drinking it, but unfortunately it only got worse after the first sip.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, seems a bit watery and thin to me.  This isn't a bad brew at all, but I expect better out of Prairie.  However, at $2.99 a bottle I guess I shouldn't complain too much.  Worth a try once, but I won't be trying this again anytime soon.","bluejacket74","Mar 04, 2015"
