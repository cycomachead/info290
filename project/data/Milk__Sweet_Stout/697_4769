3.09,2,2.75,3,3.25,3,3,"Sweet Stout has the black and visibly bubbly appearance of Coca-Cola, as it fizzes vigorously on the initial pour, and its head vanishes only a moment later. For the aroma, I pick up caramel and only an inkling of coffee and chocolate...Unfortunately there's what can be described as a metallic off-scent present. The taste however, is quite a bit better. It has a light, milky chocolate flavor, similar to a 'Three Musketeers' candy bar, but it comes with a slightly chalky finish. I don't really mind how it is thin, because I knew that by the ABV % and I happen to like sessionable stouts & porters. Overall though, I expected more from the Kiuchi brewery. I am going to try their Espresso Stout next, as the reviews are much more favorable. In regards to this one, reach for a Guinness instead!","Neorebel","Sep 11, 2013"

Mild, malty aroma with roast and biscuit malt and hints of chocolate and dry grass. Light flavor of malt, slight roasted malt, light chocolate and a hint of coffee. Light bodied. Light and attenuated flavor, which is expected from this light ABV stout. A pleasant, lightly flavored stout. I've probably moved on past this light a flavor in beer, but this seems nicely made for its intent. Closer to a light porter than a stout.","LiquidAmber","Dec 21, 2012"

The coffee notes are a little more prominent with the chocolate notes receding into the background. The malt notes add to the slight roastiness of this beer. There's some slight sweetness here too. The body is light with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and very drinkable. It's a bit thin for the style, coming across as more of a porter. It seems like this beer accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's a good beer that's worth trying if you don't mind the price tag.","acevenom","Nov 18, 2012"

Its only at 4 percent alcohol and the flavor does not seem to suffer much from this at all. Overall this was more then I would have been expecting from a Japanese stout.

Lots of acid on the tongue with lemon juice flavors and lactic acid. I pick up some tobacco in the flavor somewhere. Finishes dry with more roasted grain and some black berry that sticks in my mind on into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is kind of light and lively. OK.

3.4,12.2,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Im sampling a cellar temp bottle poured into a snifter. the beer pours a clear but dark brown and allows no light passage. A small fizzy tan head foams up for a second and leaves quickly leaving no evidence. Aroma is a little bit of chocolate and brown sugar but is dominated by a tangy funkiness. First sip reveals a silky smooth texture and very fine tingly carbonation. Flavor starts sweet with brown sugar and caramel allows some roasted malt in the middle and also a bit of lactic funkiness as well. The finish is tangy funk and I am not sure if this is normal or if the beer is just a hint past prime. the other beer flavors are enjoyable and are still easily discerned and I have heard that hitachino brews tend to be funky. This isnt really similar to most sweet stouts I have had, and Im not sure I like it but I know I dont hate it.","sulldaddy","Mar 20, 2007"

Like a number of Hitachino beers, I got some cedar notes (like being in a humidor). I thought this beer was highly drinkable for a sweet stout, even more drinkable than a number of dry stouts (like Guinness). Color was dark, but not inky black like some other stouts. Aroma was a bit like condensed milk.

However, the lactose sugars are very strong, making the beer overly sweet and a little oily. I often get a grape Kool-Aid flavor from milk stouts when over done.

This beer has notes of dark chocolate, a bit of lightly acidic espresso, and even a bit of milk chocolate.

1.79,-40.9,3,1.5,1.5,2.5,2,"ok first off this is the 24oz bottles and i was totally hyped on the bottle, it looks cool as hell. it pours dark brown, not black and with really no head to speak of. the smell is somewhat modest and contains cocoa, malt and has an odd spoiled milk smell. taste wise? ugh. talk about a let down. it honestly tastes like crap. sure theres malty chocolate notes but theyre smashed by the odd taste of rotten milk. it grossed me the f**k out. i mean im always one to finish a beer no matter how bad, but 3/4 of the way through this, down the drain it went. it was crisp but thin and not what youd expect from a stout. total bummer and expensive. not gona hit this one up again, ever.","DESTRO","Nov 24, 2003"
1.54,-49.2,3.5,2,1,2.5,1,"Drinkability: I'm sorry to say I finally poured this beer out (I do that maybe once a year, tops). I gave this tasting numerous chances, letting it warm up, etc... but for my taste, this brew is nearly offensive.","DagFishHead","Oct 26, 2003"
4.02,32.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Thin, dense, espresso crema-colored head. Sweet Stout is very, very dark brown in color and smells a bit like Kahlua, with chocolate and cafe latte notes. The taste is creamy, with strong coffee and cream flavor and a touch of dry cocoa. The influence of the lactose is easy to detect, as it makes this brew creamy, sweet, and a touch sour in the finish. Nice, full mouthfeel. This beer isn't at all oppressive, especially for a stout, and is surprisingly easy to drink. Overall, it reminds me very much of a slightly smoky Kahlua flavor. I'll have this one again.","RockyTopHeel","Oct 02, 2003"
3.4,12.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Had this at the New Bukowski's in Inman Sq. Served in the ceramic Hitachino Nest glass so I couldn't get a good look at the color. Head is the color of a chocolate milk shake. Smell is distinctly of caramels. Really smells of caramels as the beer warmed up. Taste: creamy and milky similar to 1% milk consistency, can taste the lactose and the sweet caramel and malt flavors, finishes by coating the back of my throat like a glass of milk would. Interesting offering, worth trying but not drinking on a regular basis.","chaduvel","Aug 14, 2003"
2.98,-1.7,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Although it's quite dark, it has a hint shows a hint of mahogany when held up to the light. The heady was bubbly but disappeared almost immediately without a trace of lace on the glass. The smell is light, with just detectable notes of chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is also a bit underwhelming. Nothing about it is particularly offensive; it just doesn't stand out in any way. It's undoubtedly watery for a stout. Although it's only 3.9%, it doesn't lend itself to session drinking. I'll pass on this one.","mickeymac","Aug 06, 2003"
3.91,29,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This stout poured black as soy sauce with a creamy, tan head (typical nitrogen foam). The smell was sweet and malty but modest. The taste was sweet but also somewhat tangy (almost a hint of tartness). Tastes of malt and cocoa were evident. The mouthfeel was smooth, creamy, and clean. The body was medium, and the carbonation feel was low. There was an initial tartness on the tongue which gave way to the sweetness. This was a good stout on tap. I liked this sample better than the bottle I had sampled in the US.","UncleJimbo","Jun 23, 2003"
2.13,-29.7,3.5,3,1.5,2,2,"Pours a deep ruby brown almost opaque, with a moccha highly carbonated fizzy two fingered head, and from my pour is leaving no lace at all. The aroma is a sharp slightly acidic sweetness, this is my first time grappling with a milk or cream stout so here it goes. Underneath of the harsh sourness are light coffe tones and dark chocolate from the dark roasted barley malt. The flavor at first seems a bit offensive from the rush of acidity, but I think it's growing on me after my fourth sip a little. The light flavors in the background from the dark roasted malts are definitely overshadowed from the sourness in the flavor creating an unbalance that doesn't form a happy experience with me. Nice to try a stout from a Japan micro, but I will try the Hitachino Nest wit and wheat before I count them off as bad brewers. The overall mouthfeel is a bit thin for this lucious style of a stout, and I just can't get down with this beer on any level. Drinkability is low due to the fact that the sourness overbears the rest of the characteristics of the beer therefore ruining the pleasures this beer has to offer.","WVbeergeek","Jun 15, 2003"
2.38,-21.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,2,"Pours a dark mahogany color, topped by a rather thin, tan head. The aroma is faily modest, sweet with notes roasted malt. The taste is odd, initially presenting a slightly sweet roasted taste, immediately followed by a tinge of sourness. The dry roasted flavor comes back for the finish, and last into the aftertaste, but it is rejoined by the slight sourness. The mouthfeel is rather light, not having much more body than a typical lager. Drinkability is not great, because it's just not that enjoyable. I guess they all can't be good beers, right?","aaronh","May 27, 2003"
2.81,-7.3,3.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,"I found this odd since a lot of my Asian friends are lactose intolerant, which (and I may be misinformed) is common among Asian folk. But anyway, on to the beer. It's a nice looking stout, with carbonation galore and a nice head. Boy, I think I smelled a sweet cider smell initially, but then I could detect a slight roasted malt, chocolate aroma come through. Bubbles dance on the dance which is washed away with a milky consistency. A sweet, milk chocolate flavor and kinda ends with a tinge of sourness. Each sip finishes with a milky feeling. This was a hard beer to finish the entire bottle.","BigHead","May 21, 2003"
1.93,-36.3,2.5,2,1.5,3,2,"Remember when the Japanese could mimic any current or new technology and then figure out a way to make it cheaper and better? Well, it didn't happen here. What the hell were they thinking? Milk sugar in a beer? Was this an attempt to bring back distant memories, or should I say Â“mammariesÂ”, of our early childhood? This tar colored concoction is really weird! A sour off kilter chocolate taste stands out followed by a hint of camphor and pasty malt. There are hops somewhere but if I'm not mistaken, tastes like old apple juice. The smell is strange as well - a cross between chocolate and sour balls candy. The head disappeared too quickly for me ponder their existence, but I was distracted trying to contemplate what the heck I was drinking.","BeerResearcher","Apr 14, 2003"
3.48,14.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I did a double take when I tasted it. It doesn't FEEL like a stout at all, but it looks like one. So it's something of a neat trick. The word "lacto" on the bottle implies that they're going for milky feel and taste, and that's what they get. So kudos to them on that alone. Not entirely what I'd hoped for though since I generally think of stouts as a bit more robust and, well, ballsy. Easy to drink because it's so thin. Not a terrible beer, and it is certainly unique, but I wouldn't drink it a lot.","marburg","Mar 17, 2003"
2.41,-20.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Dark but not completely opaque. Nice chunky tan head starts off nicely but fades fairly quickly for a stout. Not very big nose, but some cream. The flavor is some roastiness and chocolate but it's dominated by the sourness. It's also fairly sweet. The flavor is way too thin for a good stout. In fact, more malt would probably balance out the sourness, after all Bell's can make great stouts despite the sourness. The body is also on the thin side.","aracauna","Jan 22, 2003"

4.18,38,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours an almost completely opaque black with minimal hazy brown highlights at the rim. A short but creamy dark tan head soon drops to a collar. It does, howwever, last throughout the glass. The nose is somewhat limited but offers a thin roastiness and a mildly tart fruitiness. The body is light with a very fine and mild carbonation (from bottle conditioning) that's silky smooth and lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor is quite intriguing, and not at all what's normally expected of a sweet stout. It starts lightly fruity - turning gently tart - and warms to reveal some dark toffee and baker's chocolate followed by the promised sweetness before finishing with a lightly dry and mildly roasty finish. It's quite unique, as are all of the Hitachino Nest beers, with an interesting twist on the style. Refreshing, fairly complex and interesting, and quite enjoyable. Certainly worth trying for those who seek unusual beers!","NeroFiddled","Jan 04, 2003"
3.05,0.7,3.5,3.5,3,2,3,"This maybe the best Japanese stout I have come across. Although, it is a bit watery, it has a lovely dark chocolate aroma. It has a high acidity which I believe makes it refreshing, which is not a characteristic found in stouts. It is definitely brewed with the Japanese consumer in mind as I have not had beers from other countries with such high acidity. Other reviewers stated they noted sour taste. Acidity is often mistaken for sour taste (in drinks such as wine and sake) especially by drinkers who are sensitive to acidity. I challenge you who think this is a sour brew to reconsider you position. Cheers!","Naerhu","Dec 21, 2002"
3.55,17.2,4,4,3,3.5,4,"My bottle may have been a bit off (maybe a few too many warm closet days), but its sweet-stout heart is still strong.  Sweet, toasty and earth stout.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","Sep 15, 2002"
3.43,13.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Aromas of chocolate skim milk and soy. Decent retention of the latte-colored head. Wispy, watery, chocolate flavors surround mild bitterness, Mexican mole (moe-lay), and water cracker notes. Not heavy.","putnam","Sep 12, 2002"
3.25,7.3,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"If it was not for the addition of lacto sugar this brew would be nearly undrinkable. This is a beer to sip with a hearty meal and perhaps too full of a brew that you would want as a session style beer. Not a bad stab at the style.","Jason","Sep 08, 2002"
1.96,-35.3,4,3,1.5,2,1,"Notes: Kiuchi Brewery produces some outstanding beers, but this is not one of them. There's nothing "sweet" about this beer. It's horribly balanced and the use of lacto in this beer is abusive and overwhelming to the point of making it nearly undrinkable.","Todd","Sep 07, 2002"
3.03,0,4,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,"It poured a very dark brown color and formed a medium bubbly tan head that receeded quickly and left some lace.  The aroma was of malt and some chocolate.  The flavor was of malt and chocolate.  The lacto may account for the sour taste and finish to the beer.  Any hopes of this beer to be enjoyable are hurt by that aspect of the beer.  A weird concept to try with a beer.","Wildman","Aug 31, 2002"
