4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle date, but was recently released. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, cream, light vanilla, herbal, woodiness, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, lactose, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, dark bread, cream, light vanilla, herbal, woodiness, and roasted earthiness. Slight herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, dark bread, light vanilla, cream, herbal, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, lactose, and light earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very creamy, smooth, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice sweet stout style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, lactose, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 15, 2014"

Aromas of coffee and cream were pouring out of the glass as soon as the beer hit it, and upon further inspection, there is a heavy dose of coffee and cream on the nose, as well as some milk chocolate highlights, and hints of booze. Smells delicious! Flavors are roast forward, with a heavy bitter coffee and baker's chocolate backbone, solid lacto overlay, creamy highlights, and hints of smoke and wood. This is a deep drink, more layered than your typical milk stout. Pleasant and weighty. The body is full, robust, and smooth, with a dry undertone to remind you this is still a stout. The aftertaste is more of the roast and bitter, but hints of cream linger. The finish is smooth, clean, and slightly dry. This is a very well balanced, well put together beer, and it tastes damn good at the same time.","GarthDanielson","May 27, 2014"

Both roasted and milk-like aromas greet my nose as I smell and then same flavors greet my tongue as I drink. I found the beer to be medium-bodied, smooth, even silky, with good balance as the roasted malts are in the background and the beer has a light, not overpowering, milk and milk chocolate like sweetness. With the sweetness being the major taste sensation, not to minimize the other tastes, this might not be a beer for everyone but I really enjoyed it as it pleased my sweet tooth.","clayrock81","Apr 29, 2014"

Smell up front is smokiness, chocolate, roasted malt and milk sugar sweetness that usually accompanies a milk stout. Taste up front is all smoke. then it starts to mellow out into a nice flavored classic milk stout. Mouth feel was silky smooth, slight carbonation. I'm not sure if this was intended to be a smoked milk stout, but that s the impression I get. Along the lines of there Bo & Luke, only creamier and not barrel aged.","Davepoolesque","Apr 14, 2014"

3.99,1.8,3.75,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours nearly pitch black with a thick brown film and healthy ring around the glass leaving lots of lacing. Aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, lots of chocolate and light coffee, hints of vanilla. Flavor is sweet toasted malt with light lactose, hot cocoa, hints of charred coffee; finishes somewhat thin with pleasant light milky cocoa and a mild hop bitterness. Medium bodied. A nicely made milk stout that starts out rich and creamy, but finishes a bit lighter, but well balanced. Pleasant aftertaste of milky cocoa.","LiquidAmber","Mar 23, 2014"

With burnt wood flavors and burnt sugar. A lot of chocolate in this beer, very dark and earthy, dry aftertaste reminiscent of coffee. A good bitteerness rom the dark chocolate balances out well. Drinks really easy and has a thick, creamy mouthfeel. Awesome stuff from ATG.","TwelveOunces","Mar 02, 2014"
4.03,2.8,3.75,3.75,4.25,4,4,"Overall, a really nice representative of the style. It has all the features one looks for: bitter flavors from the roasted malt and some nice creamy sweetness to balance it out. Hop character is fairly nonexistent. This is about malt and roast. Excellent after-dinner sipper on a chilly evening. I wish it came in 6-packs (instead of pricey bombers).","deadonhisfeet","Feb 28, 2014"

4.08,4.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Glad to see Dave is grabbing some of those AtG kegs floating around out there. This one pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of brown foam. The nose comprises darkly-roasted malts, light coffee, and very light dark cocoa powder. Despite the seeming ethereality of some of those elements, things come across rather pleasantly. The taste brings in more of the same, with the roast comeing through a bit milder, the cocoa coming through more powerfully, and a bit of lightly-toasted oats tossed in for good measure. The body is a hefty medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a smooth, nearly chewy feel. Overall, a very nice milk stout, one that AtG somehow managed to not go too crazy with, allowing a tasty beer to shine on its own. Good times.","TMoney2591","Nov 26, 2012"
