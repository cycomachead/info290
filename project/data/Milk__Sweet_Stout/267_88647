4.57,12,5,4.25,4.5,5,4.75,"This is a solid chocolate milk stout. It's not as exciting as I thought it would be but it was still extremely satisfying. Odell is a solid brewery and this is a solid brew. It's really smooth and not overly carbonated. Great mouthfeel, and thought its strong for a stout (8.5%) it's not overpowering. In fact, there wasn't a the alcohol bite you normally get from an 8.5% beer. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a stout that won't disappoint you.","Grant_Satterthwaite","Mar 25, 2015"

Taste is chocolate, light roast, and maybe a hint of coffee at the end.  Mouthfeel is medium to medium-thick, a bit thinner than some stouts but that by no means takes away from this beer.

Nice sweetness, toeing the line nicely between clean and cloying—and aided in this by the very detectable presence of the chocolate notes and their attendant bitterness. Not much nose, outside of dry malty sugars and the faintest hint of lactose carried though out of the tulip's curve. Very dark, and slightly mahogany-brown when held to light, this somewhat still, light mouth-feel stout seems to fairly well achieve its ends—though I think, given the sweetness, it'd pair much better with a hunk of meat than a dessert.","OrestesMethuon","Sep 11, 2014"

Chocolate isn't as strong as the nose as I would have expected. This beer is SWEET. Too sweet for me. Nice chocolate flavor, but it needs some bitterness (either from roasted grain or hops) to balance it out. I get a kind of jelly fruitiness from the yeast, that I'm not fond of. Mouthfeel is moderate-full and sticky. This beer isn't bad, but it isn't my cup of tea. Does an exceptional job of hiding alcohol. Needs more balance with the sweetness.","goochpunch","Apr 25, 2014"

It's decently carbonated, too, so to have the effervescence playing off your tongue and still have an overwhelmingly creamy experience... it's a good 'un. The flavours are as you would expect: sweet creamy chocolate dominates everything else, with the sweet being bolstered by a definite lactose... sweetness. I figured this would be dessert, and it fits that bill quite well. There's some general roastiness and a hint of the thought of considerations of coffee perhaps, though that could just be a Pavlovian response to expecting to find it in dark beers. milky, syrupy goodness through and through.","kemoarps","Mar 09, 2014"

No real chocolate, but some coffee, lightly. Taste is an odd thing- initial taste is of vinous fruitiness, like grapes. Not what I'm expecting from a self-declared chocolate milk stout. Throws off the whole beer. There is some light pseudo cocoa tates, but the overall impression is of apple sweetness, herbaly hops and an odd finish.

3.7,-9.3,4,4,3.75,3,3.5,"This is Odell's winter Milk Stout made with chocolate. Overall, the beer smells good and taste decent, but it's the flabby, wet finish that really leaves a lot to be desired. Not a bad beer by any means, I just prefer my stouts to finish a tad more dry. For being 8.5%, the beer is very easy drinking, but at the end of the day, it's just not really my style.","flayedandskinned","Feb 18, 2014"

I like the flavor profile: it is sweet, rich, and complex as hopped for and of course you can sense the alcohol at 8.5% abv. However, all other aspects of the beer fall short: the aroma isn't particularly inspiring and the carbonation is way too fizzy. Not only does this give the beer a head more reminiscent of a soda than a craft-Stout, but the mouthfeel is no longer creamy. Perhaps doing this on Nitro would correct that. For me this is a solid brew, but not quite good good enough to warrant purchasing another premium-priced 4-pack in the near future.","Bockrules","Sep 24, 2013"

Aroma is mostly dark chocolate with a tinge of stout Flavor is more chocolate, cocoa powder, alcohol. Slightly sweet. I've read lots of comparisons to chocolate milk and while this is indeed chocolate heavy I really don't agree, its just chocolate beer. Honestly, a glass of Horizon chocolate milk tastes better than this does.","ArrogantB","Jan 13, 2013"

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"not quite what i expected, but it does taste like chocolate milk, so i guess i should have had different expectations? in any event, this is a tasty brew, if a bit odd. pours a dead sexy dark chocolate color with a tall foamy head the color, believe it or not, of nesquick chocolate milk, a few inches tall and really bubbly. i smell sweet chocolate and lactose sugars, as promised. its not sugary though like a normal milk stout, its just balanced out like a bar of semisweet chocolate of the finest quality. i would have liked to see a little more earthy dark malt character, maybe some dark german malt would have rounded this out a bit, for now its just really chocolate heavy. the feel though, itsnt heavy at all. the alcohol is invisible and the body is quite light for a big stout. plenty of carbonation also keeps it light, but id like to try this one from the bottle before i make any permanent judgements. overall a clever new odell brew, who can really do no wrong as far as im concerned.","StonedTrippin","Jan 13, 2013"

Appearance and aroma are the only things lacking. A great brew with a great logo/label. Another home run Odell, keep it up","chugalug06","Jan 07, 2013"

4.05,-0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a dark, deep brown with a nice mocha head, not much if any lacing though. A sweet, mildly rich aroma of some melted milk chocolate, lactic sugars, and just a touch of some roasted malt. Flavor is very sweet and chocolatey;starts off with the sweetness from the sugar, the chocolate builds and midtsream it is coming at you full bore like the taste of a melted milk chocolate bar sitting in your mouth, and a kiss of vanilla in as it finishes. There seems to be a hint of some roastiness there as well. The alcohol is dangerously hidden in this one. This is pretty much chocolate milk for those older than 21. A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, Odell with another winner that shines as it warms up a bit. Having tried a few of the pilot batches that lead to Lugene, this was definitely not my favorite overall variation (thpugh it is certainly up there). Chocolate Oar, with it being roastier and not as sweet, was my favorite and I'd have loved for them to have kept that type of sweet/roasty balance for this one. That said, I am certainly happy with what they did finally come up wih and its about time Odell has a nice bottled stout on the shelves. If you like sweeter milk chocolate, if you like beer, you should like this.","denver10","Jan 03, 2013"
